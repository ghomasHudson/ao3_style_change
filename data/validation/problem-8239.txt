She asked as Steve tried to readjust a few her bandages. When he pulled away and sat back against the wall, she leaned into him, wrapping a little arm around his own. Her hands were cold. Steve scooted closer to her, wishing they’d pump some warm air into the cell.
"You saw that, huh? " There was a long pause, Tony stared off into space. Steve moved on the the next stage of sandwich making. He looked behind him, the Kid was watching something on Clint's phone. His heart leapt when he saw her place a hand on his forearm. He saw him jump a little, then smile and nod.
“For a second there I thought you was gonna do it,” the man said, breathing hard.
“It’s been hours,” The man in the coat started. He turned on the screen. The Kid was on it, ankles and chest strapped to a table, her arms strapped  over her head. She wasn’t conscious.
“Do you ever second guess it?” Pepper stood and took the files from Tony’s hands. “Do you ever think that maybe he really did kill-”
Tony couldn’t speak. When he tried all that came out was a shuddering sob. It had been so long since he’d seen her. God, how he missed her. He saw a lot of her in Morgan. Every day she got older and every day Tony wished she had been alive to see that he’d done some good with his like.
“I’m fine, Tony. It’s what happens. I can’t punch a guy and expect him not to punch me back.” Steve said, wincing as Tony ran his fingers lightly over his bruised eye.
“Why’re you doing this?” the guy rasped, blood bubbling in his mouth, head lolling as Steve dragged him over to the edge.
Tony jumped, so far in his own head he didn’t hear Bruce even walk in.
“Yep. Not the most exciting, then again I don’t exactly want it to be..” Steve said, rocking on the balls of his feet. He looked Tony up and down. “It’s good to see you. I haven’t gotten the chance to catch up with anyone since graduation.”
The walk to the pool was a nice one. It was disgustingly hot, his weather app told him it was one hundred and seven degrees. Tony didn’t mind the heat, though. Everyone was tucked away in their air conditioned houses, the neighborhood was eerily quiet and still. Even the squirrels seemed to be hiding from the heat. The pool was pretty deserted too. Tony found himself almost nervous as he unlatched the gate, he slid through it easily, each step closer to the lifeguard’s chair making him want to turn back. What was he supposed to say?
“Hey, come on. Pay attention. I know it’s hard.” Did he really? “What can she do?”
“ No, it’s alright. I live nearby. I've missed the neighborhood.”
here right now, jesus...” Tony trailed off as he watched his mother open the bag she’d brought and pull out a set of clothes.
“Well…now there not much of a choice but to get her trained-“
“Since my boyfriend got a potential brain injury.” Tony said, lifting a brow and taking a sip of his coffee. Steve frowned, then winced, then tried to pretend like it didn’t happen.
He made his way back to her and sat down slowly. She grabbed one of the bars and started eating immediately. Steve counted the rest of them. They’d ended up with thirty six.
“Jesus Nat, what the hell is wro-”
It's then Tony decides he’s going to do something, contacts or something that could take a picture for him, just by blinking. Because he wants to see Steve like this every damn day.
They were dangerous together, and while Steve missed that, he wouldn’t trade Tony for the world.
Tony swallowed thickly and turned away from Steve’s grasp. Tony wanted him, he did, but sleep was inevitable, and he was barely keeping his eyes open as it was.
“Christ,
Tony kissed Steve hard. He pressed their hips together but didn’t do much more than that, offering no friction. offering no relief. Steve made a sound in the back of his throat that sounded like an unarticulated
"I need to know more. Her vocal folds are mutilated, her ovaries have been removed...there so much more I don't understand. That means I could be missing something, and that's dangerous in any situation. Especially here. I need to know the conditions of birth-if she even was birthed-"
Tony thought with a smirk.
“Oh, you’re scared alright. Listen to that. There’s something going on- tell me Steve...Rogers isn’t it?” Steve moved Matt from the post, only to slam him on the ground and furthering the backward angle of his arms. Steve pressed a knee to the middle of his back, letting all his weight rest on it as he leaned down to speak quietly.
She said, and Steve felt a pang of sadness. He wasn't sure if it was his or hers.
Steve pulled out of the driveway too quickly, and Tony worried for him.  Alone in the shower, cleaning himself up, Tony came to two realizations that he’d first come to when he was eleven years old. It was nothing new, but somehow every time he thought them his chest ached like it was the first time. The first being that he hated himself. More than anyone else in the world ever could. More than his father had. More than Steve did- but Tony wasn’t so sure if Steve hated or if it was his own self hatred leaking out as paranoia.  The second being that he was head over heels for Steve Rogers, and that scared the everliving shit out of him.
fantasy.
“What’s going on? Why’re you wet? You were at  The lake again weren’t you?” he asked accusingly. The Lake was a bad place to be. Addicting. It drove people crazy.
“Why’d you have to go and do that?” Steve asked, throwing another punch, right to the side of the head. He took a step forward. “ See, now that’s gonna bruise, and I’m gonna have to explain to my guy why I’ve got a shiner.” Which meant he’d have to lie, and that just pissed him off. He took another step forward and struck again, and again, and again, until the guy and wobbling on his feet, weakly holding his hands up. “Aren’t you gonna say anything?”
” An involuntary shiver ran down Steve’s spine.
“You keep doing that to me not sure if I’m gonna be able to stay standing up.” Tony huffed, feeling weak in in his knees, putting a little of his weight into the hands he had resting atop Steve’s head. He leaned over a little, and couldn’t help the floating thought that he could fuck Steve’s mouth, just like this. His cold, wet mouth with the warm throat beyond it. It would be good too good-
“Why, what did I say?” Steve asked, and suddenly his entire posture was different. Where he’d been sleepy and relaxed he was suddenly rigid, standing up straight. His eyes were almost scared.
that actually  made him wince.
“I’ve got a shift at five,” Steve said, his face unreadable.
“ Are you alright?” Steve asked, frowing. “ You look…..pensive.”
“I can tell by the bars,” he mused aloud.
Steve took a deep breath and bit his lip.
Now, Tony didn’t know what to do. There was something wrong, he could feel it. So, he grabbed his tablet and turned it on, turning down the screen’s brightness so he would bother Steve, who’d started snoring next to him. Quickly, as if being afraid of getting caught, Tony searched for therapists in their area. If he could get Steve to go..to maybe talk out his problems...talk about things he couldn’t tell him. It was worth a shot.
“Dreamin’ about me Precious?” Tony asked, scooting closer to Steve so he could run his lips along the line of his jaw.
"Bad men?" Natasha asked. Morgan nodded.
“I thought that was a given.” Steve said, sliding his hands in his pockets and rocking on the balls of his feet for a moment before starting for the bedroom door.
“His secretary. Assistant. Hell, I don’t know what she does, really. “ Steve said, once again throwing the comforter over the bed, adjusting it so equal amount of it hung over the sides.
There was a long pause. No one spoke.
“ Steve,” he said in reply “ Are you gonna tape your hands or…” he trailed off and waited for a reply as Matt took off his glasses and jacket and set them to the side.
“Hope you’re not having too much fun without me,” he said, closing the bathroom door behind him and walking over to the sliding glass of the shower. Tony jumped a little and looked at him wide eyed, and Steve laughed. “ Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you.” He stepped under the hot spray and placed his hands on Tony’s hips, kissing the side of his neck.
He stepped onto the elevator after a long moment of assuring himself he’d calmed down enough, and when the doors opened again he was home. It was funny. Thinking of Tony’s place as home. It was much more a home than his shitty apartment ever had been, but Steve was sure that was just because Tony Was never at his shitty apartment. He walked through the living room and to the bedroom, disappointed when he saw that Tony wasn’t in the bed. He smiled when he heard the water running in the bathroom, though, and quickly peeled his sweaty clothes off and put them in the hamper and went to join him.
Steve  wasn’t anything like the man who’d left him in bed in the wee hours of the morning for a mission three years ago. He was thin and pasty, his hair was too long and disgustingly matted.  His eyes were never still, and took on a near wild glint. There was something there Tony’d never seen before, and he was frightened of it. Steve was a stranger. He’d fought so violently the moment agents tried to separate him and the kid for detox and quarantine you’d of thought they were trying to kill him. Had he thought that? Had he thought anything at all, or had he just reacted? Withered away as he was it still took two decently sized agents to muscle him into the quarantine cell.
“Just didn’t know why I was surprised.” Steve said simply. He was moving quickly and with intent. There was no fanfare as Steve worked his first finger into Tony’s body, nor the second. He seemed to have done this several times before, because he found Tony’s prostate immediately and relentlessly swiped at it with his long fingers.
“  You’re just a little tense is all.” Tony pushed him back against the shower wall. He grazed his teeth over Steve’s shoulder, and Steve let out a small moan. His dick was interested, and it pleased him to know that Tony had been hard before he’d even stepped into the room.
“Don’t even try and play dumb. It’s too late anyway. And we’re not doing anything with your eye like that.” He said, moving to the dresser and taking off his suit jacket, setting it to the side. Before He could start unbuttoning his shirt, though, Steve wrapped his arms around him, pulling him to his chest and kissing just behind his ear.
“Mornin’ babe,” Tony said, making a show of sitting up and yawning, rubbing his face and eyes. “Sleep alright?”
“That was my plan for you.”
“ Hey, hey, don’t make that face, there was a guy in the gym who got me good is all. We were sparring. You should come watch next time, it’s fun.” Steve said, moving to the kitchen. Taking the shirt away from his face-his nose had finally stopped bleeding-  and washed his hands.
“You know?” Tony asked curiously, a smirk playing at his lips. “How so?” Tony wasn’t looking at Steve when he was pulled into the kiss. Steve grabbed ahold of his oily t-shirt and mashed their mouths together like his life depended on it. Tony lost air, it came out of him in a surprised moan as he scooted closer to Steve, arms moving to settle around his neck. It was a good kiss, Steve was a good kisser-Tony could just sit there and kiss him forever, especially with Steve’s tongue mapping out the entirety of his mouth the way it was. Tony let his arms trail down over Steve’s shoulders, hands moving to rest on his chest as he pulled away, dazed. Steve looked at him like he was ready to eat him-and Tony wouldn’t particularly mind that. He was just about the pull him in for another kiss when he spoke.
“Just be careful, alright?” Tony said finally, moving away from him and going to the freezer. He grabbed a bag of peas and tossed it to Steve, who caught it and smiled.
“What’re you asking me?” Steve asked. He sounded suspicious. He was still pulling on his clothes to leave, and suddenly Tony felt very vulnerable.
“ Your guy?” He asked, lunging forward and landing two solid hits to Steve’s middle, Steve doubled over, face red.
“What the
“Why’s that?” it was more of a grunt that anything, and Steve wasn’t satisfied. He pressed Matt’s arms back further, until he cried out, until Steve could see his shoulders starting to dislocate. He smiled, he couldn’t help himself. The asshole deserved it.
Things hadn’t changed much. Steve picked the Kid up as he walked, she was falling asleep on her feet, going too slow. He needed to see them. His team, familiar faces. It’d been so long since he’d spoken to anybody that wasn’t twelve or trying to kill him. He got in the elevator and pressed the button for the communal floor. It all felt alien to him. It didn’t feel real. He was prepared to wake up at any moment and still be in that windowless white room, sleeping on the floor, the Kid burrowed into his side. Maybe this was a next development? Maybe the last test they’d run had wrung out anther development in the terrifying power possessed in those tiny hands. That thought came to an end when the elevator opened, however. The common room was empty. Steve practically ran to the kitchen, when he set the kid down in a stool he was nearly out of breath. There was a pizza box on the counter. He opened it, there were four large New York style slices of cheese pizza. He tore off a piece of the pie and shoved it at the Kid, who had it in her mouth before he had a chance to blink. He couldn’t blame her, as he stuffed a piece into his own mouth he thought he might cry. It was so good. Who knew food could be so good? The Kid was just finishing her piece as he was grabbing his second when she jumped off the stool and clumg to him, cowering behind his legs. She raised a hand, and reflexively he shoved it down, turning quickly to follow her eye-line to see-
“I wonder if this...guy of yours know you like to fight dirty? I bet he doesn't even know the half of it.” he said, and something like cold dread seeped into Steve's stomach. He sprang into action in seconds, he had Matt’s arms twisted far behind his back and pressed him into one of the posts  of the ring.
Time stopped, and the only thing that mattered was Steve. That Steve was close, and that he kissed him again.
And then she was gone. Steve was once again left alone on the elevator. The doors closed and his descent to the lab floor resumed
“Oh, that’s interesting,” he murmured, when his hip brushed past Tony’s groin, and just for a second Tony thought maybe he’d stay…but then he was kissing him and getting up again.
“Would it be teasing if I asked you to fuck me?” He breathed, so quiet it was barely anything at all. He punctuated the question with a roll of his hips. He sucked on Steve’s earlobe, not a ole to his the immense pleasure in the deep groan that came from Steve’s chest. “You like that idea?” Tony asked. “I do. Been thinking about it all day. Had to jerk off in the shower with my fingers in my ahhh-“ He was cut off by Steve flipping them over and kissing him hard. He almost tore the button off his jeans pulling them off of him.
Tony wished he’d never told her that at all. He hadn’t even been fully awake, he wasn’t sure what he’d seen.
He went back into the office, grabbing his things in a hurry. He had everything in his arms and was ready to go off to the elevator before Pepper grabbed his arm, looking at him with such seriousness he stopped in his tracks, unable to ignore it.
“Jesus, Pepper. It was an accident. Don’t look at me like that.” The look on her face didn’t change, however, and Tony had to turn his back to her, he didn’t have time for this, and he wasn’t in the mood to have the discussion. Not again. “I know you don’t like him, alright? But he loves me. He’d never…he’d never do
“Who’s ‘some things’ then, and when exactly are we going to sort them out by?” She sounded eager. Steve could always count on that. The thing about Natasha was she didn’t really discriminate. She didn’t plan these things out like Steve liked to, at least not as thoroughly as he did. She liked the thrill of picking a target in the moment. She liked the chase, spontaneity. That, Steve couldn’t handle. It’d been part of the reason they’d parted ways. She’d cut it too close one too many times. He could only imagine what she’d thought when she saw him on television, handcuffed and in orange.
Steve took a deep breath and nodded, and with that he stepped inside the shop.
Pepper looked up, one brow raised.
“ Yeah…” Steve said, tilting his head, amused. “Listen, I’ve gotta go. You going to that party in the park tomorrow?” he asked, pulling his phone from the swim trunks pocket. The fantastic, amazing wonderful swim trunks.
Distracted, neither of them realized the kid’s eyes had opened.
“You-ah-you sure are t-taking your time.” Steve says, cracking an eye open. Tony doesn’t even reply. He just spins him around so he has to brace his hands on the wall, spreads his ass and sinks inside the hot, welcoming space. The both groat. Steve’s rim flutters around him, and Tony starts moving immediately, hard thrusts that jerk little ‘
“In the morning?” Tony asked, disgusted.
came from the kitchen.
“You know, if you ever need me I can take the day off work,” he started, and Steve sighed. Why was Tony so good to him?
“Hello? Huston to Rogers…”
“I know, babe.” Tony answered. He dropped his hand down to Steve’s cock and gave it a tug. “I was thinking of making up for that, though. If you’ll let me.”
“I’ll stay.” Tony called. Steve paused, mid step. Tension bleed from his shoulders and back.
okay? I’ll see you soon.”
“ You know you don’t have to,” Steve said, watching as Tony trailed kisses lower and lower, it raised gooseflesh on his arms. Tony looked up at him. Almost annoyed.
"You know, you're gonna have to pick a name soon." he said, changing the subject as they entered the kitchen.
“Coulda killed me,” Steve huffed squirming when Tony shoved a hand in his boxers, smiling mischievously at the erection he found there.
“We’ll talk about it. Take these. Get out of those death clothes.”
“Yes,” Steve, but it was more a drawn out groan than a word.
Tony left the office at six forty five, much to Pepper’s displeasure. He could smell the food as soon as the elevator doors opened, and Steve had even lit candles. He was already sitting at the table when Tony walked into the seldomly used dining room, but he stood, taking Tony’s bag and jacket and kissing him hello.
"Daddy?" Morgan's voice quivered. She wobbled as she walked to him, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. "I had a dream about the bad men." She said, sniffling as Tony picked her up.
"I know all this already." Steve interrupted. "We've already gone over this part. I'm doing everything I can."
“I lost my phone,” he said apologetically, looking down at his watch. “But I’m off at one fifteen…” There was a question in his voice, and Tony wasn’t entirely sure what it was but he was defiantly sure he wanted to find out. He looked down at his phone. It was twelve fifty. He’d just have to get his pancakes to go.
Tony walked over to the elevator and punched the button, taking out his key to call the penthouse elevator. It was right then, when his heart was beating fast and hard and his mind was reeling a mile a minute, that he realized he loved Steve Rogers with every fiber of his being, and he got scared.
“ Are you sure?” Tony asked, the question muffled in Steve’s side as he mouthed the glorious skin of his hip. Steve made a sound of frustration.
“How long do you think they’re gonna keep them in there?” Shield hadn’t told anybody shit, and it was getting increasingly frustrating.  It wasn’t like they were going to divulge any information to tabloids and news stations. Tony was convinced Hill was intentionally being a dick.
There was no response from the Kid. She was asleep.
He waited for a reply, but all he got in return was soft, wheezing snores.
“Stop being jealous. You know I love you best. I was just wondering.” She sat down in one of the chairs opposite his desk and stared at him, indicating that she wanted to have a conversation, and if he valued his life he’d put his work down and talk to her.
“ My day was...interesting. To say the least.” Tony said, shoving a mouthful of pasta into his mouth. “ You’re not eating,” he noted, nodding to Steve’s plate. Steve simply shrugged.
“Yeah, me too. The guy’s a mess. It was supposed to be my day off.” He climbed down from the chair. On his feet he wasn’t much taller than Tony was himself, not like Steve-
“What the hell?” he was too loud, she flinched and covered her face, and the reality of his situation dawned on him all too immediately. "I'm sorry. Why did you do that?”
“ Jesus Pepper, he’s got shit to work out. Nightmares and stuff. You don’t spend six months in prison without acquiring a few.”
Tony stood in a flurry of anger, snatching back the file and throwing it onto his desk.
something wrong with him, something that couldn’t be fixed- therapists wouldn’t be able to do anything, never had been.
“Is that so, Mr. Stark?” Steve asked, teasing. He looked more relaxed that Tony had seen him in weeks. He looked even better in the suit he was wearing, even though it was a cheap and state issued from Wal-Mart. Hell, Steve had even managed to make orange jump suits look good.
“Hey. I was wondering when I’d see you again.” Tony said, looking Steve up and down once more, this time making sure Steve could see him do it. This earned him a blush from Steve-as if Tony could be more attracted to him. Steve shuffled a little, a smirk replacing his smile.
Pepper raised her eyebrows. Tony knew for a fact she wasn’t a fan of him. From day one she’d seemed skeptical, but Tony was getting tired of it. They’d been together for going on three months. Steve wasn’t going to rob him and leave. Tony knew that for a fact.
That wasn't the smile Tony used to give him.
“ Well, you can make it up to me later tonight if you want.” he said, standing, and holding out a hand for Steve to stand as well. Steve took it and raised an eyebrow, a challenge accepted.
“I’m not here to hurt you.” he added carefully. “What did they do to you?” She just looked at him. Her eyes were glassy and her movements were sluggish. He wondered if she was still drugged.
Tony had to put a hand over his own mouth when he realized what Steve was doing. He’d been so entranced in watching Steve tease himself he hadn’t seen the big picture.
“ I think maybe you should come back with me,” he said swallowing hard. But Steve shook his head and Tony’s stomach sank.
This was good, this was better than good, because Pepper knew for a fact that this guy had information.
“ No,” He said, shaking his head. “ No, I hurt you, I was being an ass-” Tony shook his head and threw the toilet paper in the toilet. His nose hadn’t even bleed that much.
Tony had no clue how to tell him.
Flirting between them was just so damn easy. Everything between them was easy, Steve had never had that with anybody before. Tony was so….Tony. He wasn’t like a single person he’d ever met in his life.
“ Some crazy stuff happened last night,” he started, flicking an article, scanning it quickly. “Some guy was found dead a few blocks away. Suicide.Jumped off the roof of his own apartment building.” Tony swallowed as something cold settled in the bottom of his stomach. “Thing says he left behind a few kids.”
Her little hand was cold and clammy atop his. It made him shiver. A wave of nausea rolled through him.
“Can I drive you home?” he asked, tone anything but innocent. Tony was on his feet in a heartbeat.
“Steve.” It was Tony. His voice was almost pleading. “I need you to try alright? If you don’t answer me you’re gonna have to do this all over again with some asshole agent in an interrogation room. It’s going to be a lot less fun that way, and you won’t be able to take the Kid with you.”
“I asked,” Steve said, slinking across the bed, hand skirting beneath the covers and into Tony’s lap. “If you wanted some help with this.”
“I dunno, it’s anyone's guess.” Tony paused. “ Just...you know I’m here for you right? If you ever feel...if things ever feel-”
Tony scoffed.
“Fuck yeah, please,” Tony groaned, hips jerking up in the direction of that mouth, that mouth that he knew was warm and welcoming, that mouth that sucked so
“What?” Tony muttered, relaxing fully, the heat ant the post sex glow making him lax and sleepy.
“You’re up past your bedtime,” tony commented, shrugging out of his clothes. Steve was already in bed, shirtless and perfect, he looked tense and exhausted, and Tony’s heart ached. He loved him, every time the thought crossed his mind it was like for the first time, and his chest swelled.
“Really?” he murmured, trailing his lips down Tony’s neck. To his surprise, Tony pulled away and turned to look at him.
“I wan to see you again.” Tony said, covering himself with the blanket as Steve buttoned up the stupid uniform shirt.
“No.” He said simply, feeling defeated.
He looked down at himself for the first time. He was still dressed in singed, bloody clothes. He was starting to become confused. This was proof. What happened had happened. So where was he? Why couldn’t he get an immediate answer from his mother?
“Wow. It’s surprising that someone else is in here for a change.” the guy said, and Steve caught the bag he'd been using and turned to face the speaker. It was a blind man-Steve almost had to do a double take-boxing wasn’t exactly a sport for guys who couldn’t use their eyes-
It was that thought that lead to Tony dragging Steve home with him that night from Denny’s. It lead him to push Steve trough his front door, to kiss him while they fumbled down the too long hall of the too empty house to his bedroom. Steve hardly seemed to even notice where he was, he was so focused on pulling his clothes off. Tony took that opportunity to jump him, take him by surprise so he’d stumble back and fall on the bed, taking Tony down with him.
“What happened?” he asked softly, voice hoarse from disuse. He tried to edge near her, but she scuttled away. Steve put his hands up, not forgetting how easily she’d nearly killed him.
Tony couldn’t pretend like he didn’t see Natasha creeping back to the lake, and he worried for her, but hoped she might try to find something out. She'd probably know by nightfall.
"Morgan!"
By time that happens Steve’s a mess. His eyes are shut tight, hair soaked with sweat and stuck to his forehead. His head was tilted back, resting on the wall, his eyes were screwed shut, and he was trying to fuck himself back on Tony’s fingers, face drawn up in pleasure and concentration, mouth slight agape.
That wasn’t fair.
Tony was worried.
Steve paused a moment, then grinned. When he pushed the man it was like his whole body was on autopilot. He leaned over the edge to watch his decent, listened hard for the smack that meant he’d hit the ground. Steve stared down at the ground for a moment, watching as a dark glimmer of blood trailed down the broken asphalt of the alley. He stood there, doing his best to feel guilty. When the guilt didn’t come, he simply pulled off his shirt and went to grab his bag from the bottom of the stairs. His eye was swollen shut and his nose was bloody-He used the shirt to keep it from dripping anywhere. He didn’t need to leave a trail for anybody to find.
About halfway there, she sees something. There's people running in her field. She drops down on her knees so she's completely hidden by the grass. What if they're bad people?
“Not tonight, Tony.” Steve muttered. There was that distance again, he sounded so far away, something was bothering him, Tony knew it, but he didn’t know how to fix it.
“ Hello Pepper, it’s wonderful to see you too. I’m doing great, thanks for asking.” Pepper rolled her eyes and set another stack of files on his desk.
“Got stuck on something. Wasn’t gonna be able to sleep anyway.” it was more mumbled that anything, muffled by the pillow. “I’m sorry.” He added, doing everything he could to not let sleep pull him down. The hand on his hip slid around to his stomach and traced lightly up his chest. Tony groaned, but it was a sleepy sound.
“Stop teasing,” Steve huffed. He actually seems truly annoyed the next time he looked Tony in the eye-which was never something that’d happened before when they were like this. Tony could feel the hard line of Steve’s erection pressing firmly against his ass and had a wonderful, beautiful idea. He ran his mouth from Steve’s nipple, up his chest and to his neck, where he didn’t leave any hickeys no matter how badly he wanted to. They were chest to chest once Tony got to Steve’s ear, and he ran his tongue along the shell of it.
The Kid was looking between the two of them, head turning every time the other talked, a small panicked edge to her features and posture. She was still in survival mode. Steve really couldn't blame her.
“I’m fine Tony, nothing to worry about...just thinking about some stuff.” That seemed to be enough for Tony, because he nodded and reclaimed his seat on the counter.
“ When and where, solider boy?”
“You were awake when I came back?” Steve asked. The Kid stared at him for a long moment, contemplating. She nodded.
“Do I owe you money?” Sitting in the chair was Clint Barton, looking rather amused, eyes too bright. He was one of Steve’s friends, and looked incredibly bored and wildly sunburned. He seemed quite miserable.
"I did know. I saw the funeral. I saw the..the news. About everything after. I was just...It was a lot to take in." Steve kept on doing his part for the sandwich, but Tony stilled next to him.
Bruce looked for a moment as if her were searching for the best way to proceed. "Things aren't exactly good, Steve. That's not to say they won't be. A lot of these problems are easy things to fix but...I just don't have enough information." Bruce flipped open the file and started leafing through pages.
“To be in control, calm down. There’s only one question left for now.” Tony started reach across the table to take his hand. Reflexively, Steve dropped his hands to his lap.Tony paused, then turned off the camera. He didn’t say anything, he just stared for too long of a time.
“You gonna fuck me against the wall?” Steve asked, he looked almost dazed. His breath was coming in ragged huffs, and Steve could see he was
“Yeah,” He nodded, swallowing hard. “ Let’s go.” his face felt hot and he squirmed in his seat as Steve started the truck. It spluttered to life with a sound that was like daggers in Tony’s chest, an awful high pitched
Tony thanked god he didn’t have to answer, because Steve was already disappearing under the covers.
“Where are you going?” Tony asked as Steve opened the pool gate and let himself out.
“Oh, hey. I didn’t see you-“ Nice, Stark. Real nice. Steve really did smile then, and Tony thought he’d fall over. Who gave him the right to look like that? “Life Guard, huh?” Tony pushed his sunglasses up onto his face. He might as well drown himself now.
“ No, you were too far gone. I wanted you to sleep.” He kissed down, and down and down, and then suddenly he was on his back. Pressed into the mattress and he moan, because the feeling of Steve’s weight was so familiar, he knew what was going to come, and the anticipation was better, maybe even the best part of it all.
“No, no it was some druggie or something, I don’t know.” Tony said, shivering a little. He hated the news. He wasn’t sure why he read it every morning.
When Steve came, he didn’t make a sound. Tony could tell how hard it was for him, staying so quiet. His face was beet red, and he bit down on his bottom lip hard. Tony even saw him twitching,
“ Alright. If you say so, but I was saying I wanna buy. I more than owe it to you.” And there it was, that sincere puppy dog look that had Tony’s heart on a leash. He couldn’t say no to that, no matter how much he disagreed with it.
“Right,” Barns said, nodding and sitting back in his chair. “ Well fucking get on with it, what do you want?”
“I thought you lost that phone, Romanov.” he replied easily, voice low. He pulled the comforter over the bed, moving to the other side of the mattress to make sure it was placed evenly.
“I’m not trying to scare you, alright? I just...I don’t want to have to be the person who tells you this.” She said carefully. She cleared her throat. “Morgan’s there.”
“Yeah, if you could just fuck me that’d be great.” Tony said, fucking down on the now three fingers spreading him wide.
“You come here often?” Tony asked, immediately as he put the bottle he’d brought on the table. Steve looked over at him and then
“…Because people would have to be drown to-oh, ha.” Tony said, laughing dumbly, hating himself all the while. “I haven’t really seen anybody either,” he added, trying to save himself. It didn’t work.
“My pants, lube, faster.” Steve whines around his fingers, because he knows what comes next, and he wants it. He gets like that sometimes, impatient, not will to let Tony take his time, wanting the burn of the stretch-Tony didn’t supposed he minded that. He like it himself, but the fear of actually hurting Steve was both irrational and ever present, so Tony didn’t often like to indulge him.  Tony decides there no point in
“ I was in the military for a while.” Steve paused and swallowed hard. He was having trouble talking about it, and Tony was having trouble getting passed the part where Steve had been in the military. It wasn’t even in his files, there was no record of it at all. “ It was...top secret. Special services. Finding and infiltrating terrorist bases, fleshing them out from the inside it was...it was scary work. We did a lot of things..The Howling Commandos did a lot of things we shouldn’t of, things I didn’t agree with..but they were orders.”
“ No buts Steve, I shouldn’t have pushed like that. See, my fault. Not yours. You didn’t mean to hit me in the nose-it wasn’t even that bad. Don’t feel guilty.”
“Is that so?” Steve asked, rolling his eyes-and that was ridiculous, if anybody had to right to roll his eyes it was Tony, because that engine was literally screaming for help. As they pull out of the parking lot Tony tries to ignore the sad, uneven rasp of the thing. "What would you say if I told you I got it like this?"
“ I’ll see you there then.” Steve said, taking a few steps back winking  as he headed to leave the pool.
say he wanted to do it again. Tony was never one to deny him.
"I'm disgusted with myself." He said finally, looking back down at Morgan. "I'm so happy to see her. To hold her again." Tony cleared his throat and walked away from the couch to look out the window.The sun was going down. The sky was a fiery orange.  They'd gotten through a lot of emotional baggage, he and his mother. The thought of searching for comfort in her was still somewhat daunting. What if he didn't find it? What would happen then?
It was then Pepper realized there was no way she’d be able to convince Tony of the truth. Not on her own, anyway. She’d have to show him the video. It would break his heart. Maybe it’d terrify him, but she’d have to show him. He needed to know that he wasn’t safe, that
“Mmh, it’s cherry. My favorite.” He said with a small, seductive smile. His lips were stained red from the frozen treat and Tony knew if his kissed him right now he’d taste like The look on his face had turned devilish, and a familiar heat curled in Tony’s stomach.
“I’ve seen more than enough,” Tony responded, breaking through the tumbling stream of thought. Steve saw a visible shudder go through him. “That’s why I’ve got to ask the question in the first place.” That made sense.
“ Think about what? I don’t know what you’re getting at.” Tony said, not looking up. He knew exactly what Pepper was getting at, and it was ridiculous. Crazy, all kinds of crazy. Steve was the best person he’d met in his life, and he’d go to the grave defending him.
Steve looked up at him, and Tony could see pain in his face. He knew it wasn’t from the bruises, he knew that for a fact. This-this time in the military- The Howling Commandos, whatever Steve had called it- it was a bad memory for him. Tony didn’t know what had spurred the conversation on in the first place, but it seemed it was what Steve intended to dinner to be for.
Tony nodded and walked numbly to the car.
Tony gets home at three am. It’d been two and a half weeks since he’d been there, just long enough for things to be familiar and strange at the same time. You never realised how much you missed home until you spent two weeks hopping from hotel to hotel country to country. Tony was absolutely wiped, he was later than he was supposed to be. He’d told Steve he’d be home by ten pm. He was really going to have to make up for this one.
“ And why can’t you do this yourself? I mean you clearly have the money and the technology at your disposal” The man next to Matt quipped. He looked skeptical, untrusting.
“What are they going to do to her? For before?” That took Tony by surprise. Steve could still read him like a book.
“Could I actually get a to go box? Last minute plans, sorry.” Tony smiled his best smile, but she still looked like she wanted to strangle him. When he was finished boxing up his food he left her a fifty dollar tip before wondering out of the restaurant, sitting on the bench just outside of it. Ten minutes later, Steve was out in the night air, tilting his face up to the sky and closing his eyes. Tony watched him quietly. The moment didn’t last long, very quickly Steve’s eyes were on him. He nodded to a rusty blue pick up parked at the far side of the parking lot.
Steve Snorted and shook his head. “ So what now? Aren’t there papers I have to sign?”
“I texted you...” Tony blurted, feeling his own face warm up as he shifted in his seat, pleasantly uncomfortable. Steve’s smile faded, and Tony wondered if he’d done something wrong.
“ Because,” Steve said, quietly, shifting to hold Matt’s hands in one of his own and used his free one to press Matt’s head into the ground. “I’m not in all that great of a place right now,” he murmured quietly, trailing his fingers down the back of Matt’s neck. “ It’d be so, so easy to just-” he put a hand at the base of the guy’s neck and made a cracking sound. He started to struggle, but the more he moved the further his arms went behind his back.
“Thought you were gonna be up here by midnight.” Steve voice was sleep rough and low and absolutely dripping with intention.Tony sighed tiredly.
Tony nodded wordlessly, mind made up.
“Fine, Just trying to make this last a little longer, s’all.” Tony muttered, shimmying his pants down a little lower and squeezing himself hard, fingers wrapped around the base of his erection. The tip was nearly as red as Steve’s lips, and it was spit slick and shining. Steve stared at it a hungry man might stare at a plate of hot home cooking.  Then he smiled, finally tearing his eyes away from Tony’s crotch to settle on his face.
“ Tony? It’s Mrs. Gonzales.”
the head deep red-Steve was close.
This took forever, I'm sorry!
" Of corse she was-" Natasha put a hand on Steve's arm, and he once again shut his mouth, jaw clenched. "Sorry."
“ What did you do to her?” Steve asked. There was blood on her gown. It was too red on the pristine white of the thing. Her head hung low, her shoulders dipped forward, looking like they’d of dislocated had she been any heavier.
“I think I might. You know it’s not fair that you get me that fast.” Steve said, face a little red. He never lasted long when Tony blew him, and he was pretty sure that was the point. He was right, if the smug look on Tony’s face was anything to go by.
“ Steve, christ, you weren’t an ass.” The look in Steve’s eyes was horrible. He looked like...Tony couldn’t even describe it. It looked like he regretted literally everything in his life just because he’d accidentally elbowed Tony in the face. “Look, it’s already done bleeding. Let’s just get some sleep, okay?” Steve didn’t move, so Tony put his hands on his chest and moved him out of the bathroom himself. Steve finally got the memo and made his way to the bed, and when Tony joined him, he pulled him close and kissed him. It wasn’t like Steve’s normal kisses, though,Steve only ever kissed him like this when they were having sex-or about to have sex, and Tony pulled away shaking his head.
The pizza felt too heavy in Steve's stomach. He was going to lose it any second, he knew he was.
“ I guess we’ll see about that. I’m Matt by the way.” Matt stuck his hand out, and Steve shook it.
“Holy fucking
“Sure….I guess I’ll see you when you get back.” Tony sounded sad and disappointed, and if Steve were able, he’d of changed his mind and stayed in for the rest of the night, but honestly, since he’d told Tony about the Commandos and about Bucky, things had been different. Tony treated him like he was somebody to be tiptoed around, like he’d break at any second, and Steve couldn’t handle it.
“And after, Tony. after the day’s done and I finally take that plug out of you, I’m going to eat my come out of your ass. I’m goinna suck every little drop out of that pretty little hole of yourse so I’ll have room to fill it up all over again-“
“ Yeah,” Tony said, nodding once he’d realized he’d left Steve hanging for a bit. “ Yes, definitely Friday. What time?” Steve was taking a few steps backwards looking at him like he was some sort of...something special and smiled and held his hand up to his ear, thumb and pinky extended.
“I know. I was hoping to make up for it.” He said, propping himself up on Steve’s chest, looking down at him. “Think I did alright?”
Tony’d had his eye on the lifeguard for a long time. There was just something about him he couldn’t let go no matter how hard he tried. Steve Rogers was something of an enigma to Tony Stark, it made him wildly uncomfortable. And horny, but mostly uncomfortable. Alright, it was equal parts horny and uncomfortable, but who says Tony had to admit that to anybody but himself?
"Maybe we'll get you one. I'll have to talk to Steve." The Kid grinned, and Steve was about to turn to ask Clint what exactly he said the could get her when he felt Tony's hand over his. It was light, and only there for a moment and gone just the next.
Pepper sighed and pulled an envelope out of her purse.
“Think I’ll stick to the pool at home. Pools.” He winked and flicked Clint off, all the while wondering why he was doing it. He didn’t wait to see his reaction, too busy wallowing in his own disappointment.
wasn’t safe.
“You have a name, kid?” It’s been a while since he’d spoken to anyone aside from the man who’d come to retried the shield when he arrived.
“Really. I want you to rest. You could have a concussion, you know. If you got hit hard enough for it to bruise like that. Maybe you shouldn’t go to sleep anytime soon...we can watch a movie?” there it was. Tony worrying about him like he knew about the frail little shrimp he used to be. It was frustrating, but, then again it was Tony. There was no telling Tony anything once he had his mind made up, which he obviously had.
Not five minutes passed before Steve was looking at his watch.
"Don't give me that. I observe more than one should, that's true, but I don't make contact, I don't
Steve woke up five hours later, having fallen asleep trying to think of a way to tell Tony about the Howling Commandos. He got up with a sigh and looked in the mirror. He looked horrible, but he’d have to deal with it. He pulled on some jeans and a t-shirt and made his way out of the penthouse, taking the elevator to Tony’s office floor. The elevator opened and Steve stepped into the modernly decorated office and walked through to the main waiting room.
Once he had his bag he went out the back of the building, through the alley were the guy was laying dead. Nobody would find him until morning, it was too dark, the alley was too small for any cars to go down, and then somebody would have to actually turn their head and look, so Steve wasn’t worried. He had plenty of time. Steve made his way to the boxing gym, and from there he called a taxi. He was exhausted, as he always was after he’d finished...doing his thing. He didn’t really like doing it in the first place, but he didn’t have much of a choice. He would’ve stopped, or at least tried to stop if it hadn’t been for Tony. Steve loved him, he didn’t even want to chance hurting him. He was quick to anger, and all it took was one argument. One lapse of control for him to fuck up and ruin the best thing that ever happened to him.
Once he was alone in their bedroom, he shut and locked the door. He grabbed Tony’s bedside tablet and opened it, looking through the notes, and when he didn’t find what he wanted, the history. He didn’t find anything, so he pulled up the search engine and looked through the search history there. He froze when he saw the search for therapists in the area. So that’s what it was. Tony thought there was something wrong with him- he wasn’t wrong, really, Steve had no hard time admitting that. There
He’d been anxious for nothing. The door clicked open. Warmth seeped out of the doorway.
“ Love you.”
“As long as it takes to finish testing. They’ve tested negatively for everything than can be tested for without actual blood work.” Bruce let out a long breath and turned his back to the cell. “The rest of the clearance tests are going to require a few samples.”
Tony.” Steve said, making Tony blank out completely, because Steve’s voice has gone higher, and he’s got the palms of his hands pressed to the wall behind, despite the fact that he was practically writhing with the effort not to touch himself. It was beautiful, really. Steve was standing there, practically glistening, His chest heaved, and when it did little droplets of sweat caught in the light. Tony was sweating too, but he highly doubted he looked so damn good doing it.
“ Do you remember last night? What you said to me?” Tony’s heart was beating fast. He had to know. Steve hadn’t said anything about it, and Tony couldn’t just assume…
When Tony opened his eyes again he wasn’t sure how much time had passed. It was still dark outside. Steve wasn’t in bed next to him. A quick glance at the clock let him know it was 4am, which meant Steve was already off on his run. He sighed and sit up, pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes. It hadn’t been more than a few hours but there was no real hope in falling back asleep now that he was awake.
“Please don’t tell me those poor kids found him” he said, trying to read over his shoulder.
Tony ignored his snickers as he let himself out of the pool gate.
“Fuck,” Tony muttered, running a hand through his hair, smoothing it out. He readjusted his sunglasses and tried to pretend he wasn’t looking at Steve over the pages of his book, but it was hard. He was just so damn…there wasn’t even a word for it. For a while he’d decided to ignore the crush. It was pointless. He’d been Steve’s tormentor for too long. He’d been the one who’d given him the nickname ‘Wheezy Stevie’ in grade school. He’d been the one to exclude him from games, the one who wrote rumors about him in the bathroom stalls. Why the hell would Steve give him the time of day?
"It's fine," Bruce said, but something about him was off. Steve didn't like the way he was looking at him. Natasha either, for that matter. She didn't say a word, but he could see it in her eyes. Something was wrong.
she was. It was hard to tell. Bruce said he'd tell him more when the Kid wasn't sitting there, staring at him. Walking down the hall Steve felt weird without her next to him. He was surprised to see both Bruce and Natasha waiting for him in the living room.
They came at the same time. Tony said Steve’s name. Steve cursed and bit his lip, face red, hair stuck to his forehead with sweat. He rolled over next to Tony and sucked in a few deep breaths. Tony could feel come dribbling out of him, and wished he could some how record the sensation. Sure it wasn’t his first rodeo either, but it was different with Steve, it was all different with Steve. Steve, who was already reaching for his shirt.
Tony pressed the button for the elevator she’d just stepped out of, then stepped on, offering he a smile and a small wave as the doors shut.
"Anthony, come back to the present dear, there's only so much time in a day." Maria said airily.
Tony smiled something evil and trailed his mouth along Steve’s collarbone.
He put a winky face next to his name.
“Fine,” Steve said, moving to pull off his undershirt. He’d have to be more careful next time, he had Tony content on his story, but if anybody came looking they'd see the bruise and they’d know for a fact what he’d been up to. Steve tossed his undershirt in the trash and pulled on a clean sleep shirt. He pulled off the exercise shorts he’d been wearing as well and climbed into bed in his boxers. “You can pick the movie.”
“ I don’t know if it’ll be all that much of a fair fight-but sure.” Hitting a person always felt better than hitting a bag, but Steve figured he’d go easy on the guy.
Pepper held her hands up in mock surrender, which was funny. Pepper never gave up on anything.
“I’m removing the medical ports from her chest and abdomen and back. I think they might be infected.” There was a pause. ‘Things like these are normally and properly used to help treat cancer patients. And usually only found in the chest…I’m not sure why she has so many. I haven’t found any signs of cancer in her body yet, though. The tests are good.”
"It's fine. You didn't know-"
,” her voice in his head again. “
“ I love you too,” And this time, this time it was real, this time he could feel the words, spoken in time with his heart beating in his ears, with the feeling of Steve’s lips on his, lips that curled up into a smile, because it was true, and Tony knew that. He’d known it for a long time. Steve loved him. And Tony love him too.
“ And Tony? Thanks. For everything.”
Pepper nodded.
“The jury finds Steven Grant Rogers not guilty of two counts of first degree murder.”
“Tell me you’re not gonna lay a hand on those kids again, and I’ll let you go.” Steve said quietly, leaning the man further over the edge. The guy rushed to repeat him, but all that came out of his mouth was a desperate, strangled bunch of sounds.
“ No, no no no no-You don’t get to say something like that and
“ You don’t have to worry about that, Tony. I wouldn’t do that to you.” Steve spoke so quietly, so earnestly, that Tony could feel his heart melt. He felt Steve kiss the side of his face and heard him mutter something about going back to bed, but Tony didn’t process it until he was almost out of the room.
He was being watched.
“What did they do to you?” he asked, but Steve knew he wasn’t really to answer. He supposed maybe that question was the hardest of all of them to answer, because he really didn’t know. It wasn’t this hard to talk to the Kid. Hell, it wasn’t even this hard to
“Guess you could say that.” Matt said, and Steve could see him about to move again. He moved out of the way of a swift punch that was aimed at his head and grabbed Matt’s fist, holding it tightly.
“I wan’t to suck you off,” Steve murmured in his ear, voice low. “But I’m not gonna do it if you’re wasted.”  He kissed Tony again before he could speak, he could barely react-just those words in his ear made him feel like he was going to cream his jeans right there. He swallowed thickly. When Steve pulled away, Tony chased his lips.
“It’ll be nice to have a partner in the ring-I mean if you’re willing.” Steve turned again and gave the guy a withering look, but nodded anyway, after a moment of slight confusion, he spoke up.
“Sure thing Steve, be careful, you’re gonna make Tony sick. He worries about you.”
“Daddy?” Morgan said, looking genuinely confused. She stared at him for a very long time. Tony could see the cogs turning in her head. It tilted to the side as she studied him. And then she smiled. There were gaps in her teeth. She was so big. Emotion tore at Tony like a hungry dog. He was happy to see her. He was happy to hold her when she launched herself into his his arms, but if she was here with him that meant she was for very certain-
“ So what happened?” Tony leaned forward and put his hand over Steve’s and Steve grabbed it and held onto it tightly, like it was a lifeline, like Tony was the only thing keeping him together.
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled. “Blueberry pancakes, please. And coffee. A pot of coffee. Thanks.” he handed the waitress the menu with a smile that wasn’t returned and went back to his people watching, entranced by the way the stoners were putting away their food when a loud
Tony paused. He looked like he'd been trying to sneak away before he was seen. It made Steve's heart sink to his feet. Tony had his back to him, Steve couldn't see his face, but he could see the tense line of his shoulders. Tony turned, smiling the fake smile Steve absolutely
So when Natasha comes banging into the house he’d long since built for himself he’s surprised. The shock of the sudden noise made him jump and drop his coffee mug. It shattered, splattering coffee everywhere. Natasha was out of breath, her hair was soaked, she looked like she’d been running for a long time.
“You’re not the only one.” Bruce agreed, rubbing at his face. “Are you alright? I know it must be…a lot.” Tony shrugged off the question. Him being alright wasn’t exactly what was important.
“Nat you’re really starting to scare me-”
“You’re not the first person I’ve done this with. Lube. Where is it?” Steve asked, hand around Tony’s dick, stroking lightly. There was a lot in that statement to unpack, and Tony’s brian wasn’t completely able to hang with it due to the blood lost to his already too hard cock. He wasn’t the first person Steve had done this with. Who was? Why the fuck was he jealous?
“It’s just a bruise, Tony. It doesn’t even hurt that bad.You’ve seen me in worse shape. I’ll put ice on it if that makes you feel better.” Tony pulled away from him and stared. Steve could see the resilience in his eyes. He didn’t say anything for a long moment, and Steve wasn’t really sure what to do.
Steve was a sensitive guy. Once, Tony put a pair of vibrating nipple clamps on him and left them on him for three hours. Steve came eight times. Tony was well versed in his sensitivity and how he felt touch-so it was odd when Steve’s cock seemed
"I have to go, Nat. It's the right thing to do."
“ I wonder why he did it,” Steve said quietly, his voice didn’t sound right. It sounded too far away, too absent. Tony figured that had to be the drugs kicking in, but it worried him anyway.
"Morgan!"
“I know. I’ll see you in an hour, Tony. Try to get some more sleep. You worked late last night.” And like that he was out the door. Tony muttered to himself and pulled the blankets over his head. He knew from experience he had exactly ten minutes until Steve’s side of the bed got cold, so he had to fall asleep in that time or it wasn’t happening at all. His thoughts drifted away from Steve and to the work he had to do that day.
“No time for that, Pep. Gotta get to the conference room. I’ll head down, you clean up—and don’t think you’re not telling me what’s going on. I want the details-“
Steve was pulled out of his thoughts by a warm hand on his shoulder. He was standing at the sink, washing the dishes, a large, stainless steel kitchen knife in his hand. He scrubbed the last of the food off it then set it down, turning to face Tony.
“Just thought you might want to take a break, is all.” He explained, shrugging his shoulders. “You’re working too hard. I was hoping this could be sort of a vacation.” There’s an odd glint in his eyes as he bites down on his popsicle. For all the years Tony’d ever known and loved him he wasn’t sure he’d seen it before.
things got back to normal. They worked in silence for a bit. The way they used to. Steve spread the mayo on the bread slices and handed them off to Tony, who placed the roast beef and slid them back to Steve, who placed the cheese while Tony cut tomatoes and so on.
“Hello? Are you going to order something or not?” Tony’s head snapped forward, and he was face to face with a very disgruntled waitress.
“ What can you tell me about the Howling Commandos? Particular Steve Rogers?” There was a pause, during which Pepper found out that James Barnes had a glare that could send mobsters running with their tails between their legs.
Steve made a small sound in sleep, and Tony looked over at him. His face was swollen and bruised. The only other time he’d seen Steve look like that was a few weeks into the trial. Steve had been jumped by a few guys in the shower. Steve had said they’d thought he was guilty, and had known the men who’d been killed and wanted revenge. It’d broken his heart to see him like that, both eyes black, and his lip split. It wasn’t fair. Steve hadn’t thrown a single punch back. He’d just taken it, waiting until guards came and pulled the attackers off him. When Tony’d asked him why he hadn’t tried to protect himself, he’d told him he didn’t want to give anybody a single reason to find him guilty.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked, watching as red juice dripped off the popsicle. It was dripping down Steve’s arm, a bit even fell on Steve’s chest. The sight of which implored Tony to stand and take a few steps forward. He could feel sweat trickling down his back, but he didn’t care now, because Steve was standing there in front of him, want nestled deep in those too blue eyes of his. He was smirking around the popsicle, letting it melt all over his hand and his chest, trailing little red lines around the muscle.
There was a ding from the elevator, and Tony rushed to the office door, all but ready to tease Pepper about how the tables had turned. That was before he caught sight of her.
“ Sorry, yeah. Dinner. Tonight. Be ready at seven?” Tony was normally back from work much later than that, but Steve wasn't going to torture himself and further. He already was going to force himself to talk about things he didn't even want to think about, he didn’t need to freak himself out.
“Feel good?” Steve breathed into his mouth, all Tony could do was groan and close his eyes, because Steve’s hands were on him, pushing up under his shirt, strong hands greedy for skin as Steve moved to mouth over the erection that was straining painfully against the zipper of his jeans.
“What?” Steve asked following, interest piqued. “What plans?”
“ You know,” Foggy said, as she gathered her things. “ I can’t help but feel like what we’re doing is illegal.”
Tony knew something. He wasn’t sure what, and he wasn’t sure how, but he knew something he wasn’t telling him, and it made Steve want to rip his face off. Paranoia crept up the back of his neck, he knew it was there, but he couldn’t acknowledge it due to the thick veil of tiredness the painkillers had tied down over his brain.
“I’ve had these before,” he said, taking a bit of one, closing his eyes, glad to just have something to chew on “They’re supposed to be for emergencies…” high in calories and nutrients, they tasted like dirt. It was better than hunger pains. “How long have you been here?”
sensitive it could hardly be touched.
“You should call me sometime,” Steve said, pulling back. Tony saw him run a hand through his hair, pick up the frisbee, then start on his way back. He just left Tony there, weak in the knees, breathing hard, dick hanging out. Tony just stared at his retreating back, incredibly confused.
Pepper fiddled with the paper in her hands. She was nervous, but her voice was strong.
Steve hoped she’d forget she’d even asked by time she woke up.
“Only when I want to get stabbed to death by freaks in the woods,” Steve said casually, taking a long drink from his cup. Tony saw a shiver roll through him from the taste, but he put the whole thing down in two gulps. “Or drunk.” he added, setting the newly empty cup back on the table, filling it again.
Pepper plugged the camera into her computer and breathed a deep breath out. She needed to work quickly. There wasn’t much time.
Tony looked down at his phone. Upon unlocking it, he saw that Steve had taken the liberty of adding himself to Tony’s contacts as Steve Rogers (;.
“Tony?” Steve was sitting on the edge of his bed, looking at him. Tony realized he’d been asked a question.
“When’d you get here?” Steve asked, but the inquiry was only met with a kiss. It was seductive, slow and calculated. When Tony pulled away, Steve mindlessly leaned forward to chase his lips.
Steve looked at him, smirked, really. He was more than amused, if the light in his eyes was anything to go by.
“When did you stop working at the pool?” Tony asked, confused. He’d already figured that Denny’s had to be why he wasn’t there today, and then apparently there was the Starbucks now too.
“Hey, you feeling any better?”
“ God, Tony, I’m sorry, I’m sorry I didn’t mean-” Tony grabbed so toilet paper and held it to his nose.
They stayed in the coffeeshop until it closed, at which point a tired looking college student walked up to them and jangled the keys, and Tony gave him a big tip as they walked out, leaving the kid stunned.
They’d been in school together for years, and for years Steve still managed to confound him. He hadn’t always been the beefcake sitting up on the lifeguard chair. If he had Tony wouldn’t of gotten away with half the shit he did to him when they were younger. Tony wasn’t exactly proud of it, the bullying, but he’d been a child. All children are assholes, it came with the description, right? Right?
“You’re back kinda-” Tony looked up mid sentence and gasped, Steve took a few steps back and laughed.
Later that night, Tony took Steve to bed and worshiped every single inch of him. He started at his neck, just behind his ear.
“Just relax and and keep thinking about baseball, handsome.” The voice in his ear sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. Mostly because he hadn’t been expecting it, sitting half asleep on the couch watching ESPN. It was late, he’d been doing his best to wait up for Tony while he finished up in the lab. He hadn’t intended to doze off, but was glad he did. Waking up being straddled by Tony, with his hot breath tickling his ear was the best way he’d ever woken up in his whole life. Including after the ice.
"You've been to the lake?" Tony pressed gently. Natasha wouldn't talk about it. She liked to deny she even went most of the time. Most of the information he had on the place was through hear say. Information didn't travel easily when people mostly kept to themselves.
“I don’t know why you don’t just do what you want to, I mean you’re successful enough as a lawyer, you could probably drop it all now and start working on projects and still be fine.” It was true, sure, but Steve didn’t really understand. Tony was obligated to run the law firm, and that was that.
Dodgers caught up but-
“Not much of a dancer,” Steve commented, hands in his pockets, he stood on his toes, glancing at the tree line. “Hey, my friends are here. Find me later, huh?” Steve said, and he smiled crookedly put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, letting it slide off as he walked past.
“Come on big guy. Let me at least get you a coffee first.” Tony got out of the car and smoothed his shirt down. They were far enough away from the courthouse that they could breathe freely. It had been a big case- Seeing as the deaths of two local business owners were involved. Truthfully Tony was scared. He saw the crime scene photos. Those men weren’t only murdered, they were ripped apart. Whoever'd done it had had something against them and a more than serious problem. Whoever did it was the exact opposite of Steve, who was kind, bright and so good Tony was afraid of tarnishing him. Whoever did that was still out there, and likely to do it again. Tony wondered if that meant he was in danger. He’d cleared the name of a man who could of taken the blame-that was more than enough reason for a person to hold a grudge. Suddenly there was a hand on his shoulder, and Tony turned to look at Steve, who’d been talking. He hadn’t even realized.
Tony shifted a little, trying to hide growing erection. It didn’t work. Steve, who’d resumed the attack on his mouth, paused. He was breathing hard. In the dim light provided to them by the full moon, Tony could just barely see his eyes.
she asked. Steve didn’t know what to tell her. She looked angry. She
“Captain, I don’t get tired of this. I can go all day, and when it’s time for me to go I’ll find someone to take my place. It’s that simple.” The man in the coat. The one with the accent. The sound of his voice was sudden and jarring, Steve was startled into opening his eyes all at once. He couldn’t turn his head, it was strapped the the table, as well as his check, arms and legs. His shirt was cut open down the centre, there were perfectly straight too red lined running up and down his chest and abdomen. Some were crusted and black, others were still wet and shining. He couldn’t even remember why he was here in the first place.
“You’re the worst,” he grouched, acting like he hadn’t been looking when Steve stood up again. Steve shrugged and went for the door.
“Seducing you. Is it working?” Steve asked, reaching out with the hand not holding the popsicle and dragging Tony to him but the collar of his shirt, eliminating the space between them.  He smirked and wiggled his hips against Tony’s.
this beautiful engine. I won’t have it.” Tony crossed his arms over his chest, shaking his head.
“If I wanted to kill you I wouldn’t have to do it myself.” Tony responded, voice a low purr as he looked Steve up and down, trying to decide what he wanted to do to him. An odd smile played across Steve’s face as he looked up at Tony. He wasn’t sure what it was. There was something odd in his eyes, something he’d never really seen there before. Tony traced Steve’s muscled cheek with a finger. He was rewarded with a shudder when it passed over a nipple, and that alone made his dick twitch. He looked back up at Steve, gears turning in his head so quickly it was dangerous.
Pepper took a deep breath. And nodded, then she realised that Matt wouldn’t be able to see it, so she cleared her throat and spoke up.
There it was, this Bucky guy again. Tony wasn’t sure, but he thought maybe Steve had loved him. Really loved him. Tony was terrified that when and if he found him, he’d leave.
“ Right. I’ll be there.” Tony said smiling and sitting forward. He opened his mouth to say something where there was  a knock at the door, and Pepper popped her head in.
.” She knocked him out of his thoughts. He looked down at her. She was soaked, shaking visibly. Her little arm looked more like a stick poking out of the sleeve of her shirt. He knew that he had to do this for her. His own interests weren’t what mattered anymore. He had to take care of her. She had no one else. Steve stepped up to the door. His hand shook as he wrapped it around the handle. He felt the familiar minute vibration as it read his finger prints. For a moment cold dread filled him. Had Tony taken him out of the system? It was certainly a possibility, especially since he was presumed dead.
“ Dinner, huh? Sounds nice. What time should I be there?” Tony looked stunning. Steve wasn’t sure how he did it all the time. Maybe it was the way his hair sat, messy from Tony running his hands through it. Maybe it was the looseness of his tie or the crookedness of his collar-whatever it was, it was wonderful, and Steve couldn’t get enough of it.
“Are you finished?” His mother called.
“ I think most the credit goes to you, you’re the law guy here. And you agreed to take my case.” Steve said, sitting back and closing his eyes, suddenly exhausted. He would never of been able to afford Tony’s fee, but for some reason he’d reviewed his case and thought it would be good for his firm. Steve owed him everything. He hated that.
“It’s telekinesis, I think. Everything else is just…she’s got good senses? I don’t know, she’ll make you feel things. Whatever she feels. All she’s gotta do is touch you. It’s how she talks.” He felt almost dirty divulging the information without the Kid there to hear it, without her permission. But she had killed for people. Four good people. They’d have to talk about that.
“What?” he asked, shifting, swallowing hard, trying to think with his upstairs brain, but it was pretty much offline.
Tony exited the elevator and shuffled to their bedroom, taking a deep breath in, enjoying the smell he associated with home. Irish Spring and clean sheets and leather. Tony sighed as he got into bed, pulling the warm duvet over his shoulder and up to his chin. Steve’s body heat made their bed an oven, and he
“Trained?”
“And you know I want to.” Tony said, his voice something low and husky. His breath was ghosting over Steve’s dick now, and when Steve looked down it was to see Tony on his knees, it drew grunt out of him, and Tony tsked. “You don’t have to stay quiet, Steve.” Tony said, taking his dick in his hand, stroking it a few times. “I actually kind of like hearing you.”
The week following the party Steve disappeared. To be fair, Tony’d buried his head in the workshop for a solid three days, but not without shooting him a text, asking him if he was free anytime soon first. Work was an alright distraction, and he had more than enough to do if he wanted to have his AI fully coded and functional before he went to MIT, but that wasn’t going to happen if his focus kept breaking as he looked down at is woefully dormant cellphone.
Maria walked some paced away and turned her back to him. Tony changed quickly. It was odd to see smooth, unmarred skin under the charred clothes. He pulled on the simple t shirt and jeans and folded the clothes he’d been wearing. He had the odd urge to keep them.
Pepper smiled and held up a video camera. “ I’m going to ask you some questions now. I’ll record it, if you don’t mind.” Barns blinked.
“And what’s that?” Tony asked, his voice was hoarse and husky, positively sinful. He was playing dumb, returning to suck hickeys into Steve’s neck that’d be gone by morning.
“ What happened to you, Steve?” Tony asked quietly, his stomach sinking. There had to be a reason why he wasn’t still in the military now-something had to of happened.
“How’d you find me?”
“No, actually.” Tony said putting his arms behind his head. “You and I are going to go and have a coffee.” Tony watched as the corners of Steve’s mouth quirked up, and his heart fluttered a little bit. He supposed it was wrong, wanting him. Steve'd been in a vulnerable situation, he still was. Tony knew he shouldn’t be taking advantage, he knew it, but there was something about Steve that made him unable to help himself. Something about the blue of those eyes, or his gentleness despite the fact he was a literal adonis. Tony wanted him, and he hoped to god Steve had somewhat of a similar feeling for him.
She doesn’t answer him, her eyes moved to the wall where the food was dispensed. The chamber was overflowing. There were a few of the shrink wrapped packages on the floor. The button stopped working long ago. Now the meal replacement bars only clattered from the dispenser three times a day. There was always four of them.
“What’re-” Steve shook the guy again and he slipped, one leg dangling over the edge.He slapped a hand over his mouth as he heard a drunk staggering down the sidewalk. It was getting late. Steve was grateful for the cover of night, but he’d have to explain that to Tony too. It wouldn’t be hard, he was already thinking up lies that wouldn’t be too far from the truth.
“Anthony?”
“ I said not tonight, Tony,” He moved to turn over, but his elbow smacked Tony straight in the face. Pain erupted in his head, and Tony could feel warm blood dripping from his nose. Steve’s hands were on him in a second, dragging him to the bathroom.
Steve had to resist the urge to shake the Kid off when she grabbed his hand. Her anxiety shot through him like a hot knife through butter. He was barely managing his own. He hadn't known it would be this hard. He'd readjusted to this world once before, but something about this time was so different. Being in one place for so long...it'd become almost comfortable. Knowing every corner of that room, every sound and and possible option as to what it could potentially mean? It'd been a comfort, even in that hell hole. He couldn't imagine what it was like for the Kid. She clung to him practically every second of the day, which made it difficult to discuss the results of the tests that'd finally been finished. The fact that Bruce wouldn't discuss them in front of her made Steve incredibly nervous.
“Why?” Steve froze, mid chew. His eyes narrowed, the suspicion on his face clear as day. He wasn’t going to let her stay a weapon. He wasn’t going to let anybody hurt her like that again. He owed that to her in the least. He’d die if he had to, he’d come to that conclusion a long time ago. He looked back at the screen, watching Bruce remove the tubing in the girls chest he’d never really known was there. He’d seen the port sites, but never knew what was beneath them.  He was so engrossed in the mildly bloody task that he missed the next question. He didn’t even realize there was still food in his mouth until Tony snapped his fingers in front of his face.
"I really am sorry. I didn't mean to make you jump." Clint said, extending his hand in truce. The Kid simply looked at it, then at Steve's back. "You shake it. Like this" Clint took her hand and shook it. Steve watched from the reflection of the toaster, smiling a little. She was learning. Slowly but surely.
" Let's get on with it then," Steve said, knee bouncing. "How is she?"
.” Her tiny voice in his head. Her little hand palm down on the skin of his shoulder. This is how they’d communicated for the past three years, eleven months and twenty two days.
Morgan sat up, a worry settling into her gut. She slowly stood and looked down at herself. She was still in her pajamas. The purple ones with the flowers on them. They were dirty and bloody from when she's fallen down and scraped her knees and palms, but when she wiggled her finger into the hole all she felt was a normal knee. NO scrapes. Upon careful scrutiny, the scrapes on her palms were all gone too. Was the cave real? Morgan stood up, barely able to see over the tall grass on her tip toes. She couldn't see anybody or any thing for as far as she could see. Just the tall yellow grass, white flowers and trees offering sparse spots of shade.
“Uh uh,” Tony said, his voice was low, almost a whisper as he kissed Steve’s neck, sliding oh so slowly down his body, running his tongue  along the curve of the collar of his t-shirt.  “The game. Who was playing?” Tony asked, now on his knees on the floor. He ran his nail lightly along the outline of Steve’s erection tenting the soft pajama pants entrapping it. A groan slipped out of Steve's mouth at the light touch, he bit his lip trying to quiet himself.
It was hot. Not the fun kind of hot where you threw water balloons or went swimming to cool down, but the kind of hot that you hid from, the kind that had the weatherman on KTLA radio warn people against traveling unnecessarily. It was unbearable, and there was no real escaping it-especially with the power out. The light breeze felt more like the air from a hair dryer and did nothing to alleviate the exhausting heat. Tony could feel sweat in his eyes. It stung, but he didn’t blink it away, too focused on his task, screwdriver clamped between his teeth.
“Well, now I’m here too, I guess. The good thing is, I’ve got friends who’re gonna come get us out. We’re not gonna have to wait too long. They’re smart people.” As soon as he said it he wished he hadn't, because she really looked like she believed him, smiling for the first time. She had a good one. It went all the way up to her eyes, reminding him of Tony.
"Is this really happening right now? Am I really getting this from
“ I was dishonorably discharged and the Commandos were...I don’t know where they are. Bucky’s out there somewhere. We’re not on good terms. Not after that. He thinks I should've just followed orders.”
After three days went by with no reply, Tony started to worry. Was he getting ahead of himself? Had Steve just been drunk when he told Tony to call him? Was he ashamed? Questions whirred around his mind, each more deterring than the last. Finally, Tony gave up. He’d just have to talk to Steve in person.
“You gonna dance?” Tony asked, two shots in. Steve’s mouth did that thing again, where it twitched like he was having a hard time not smiling. It was Tony’s turn to look Steve up and down. He was wearing a button up shirt and shorts-not exactly what Tony would wear to a party but Steve looked good in just about everything. It was entirely unfair.
“Where’s Steve?” Pepper asked, walking into his office. Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes, dropping the file he’d been looking at to look at her.
Steve looked at him and sighed, and Tony gave him his best puppydog eyes. They worked. Steve grumbled something about cheating and took the pill bottle from him, reading the label.
“I got a way to pass the time.” He said, mouth already latching onto Tony’s neck, hands roaming his body. Tony arched into the hickey Steve was sucking into the skin just below his ear, and found himself moaning when he thought of just how hard it was going to be to hide. Steve’s hand moved to cup his ass below his waistband, his mouth moved to mash against. Tony feels the fait graze of teeth on his bottom lip, then a finger circle his hole. He shook his head.
No. He was just being paranoid. Steve Seemed almost absentminded as he pulled a popsicle out of the freezer and unwrapped it.
It happens two or three times after the night in Steve’s truck. Tony catches him at the pool the first time, just as it was closing. Steve shoved him up against a shower stall and kissed him so hard he has a bruise on his shoulder blade from being pressed into the tile. The next time Tony went to Denny’s again-but they never managed to make it out of the parking lot. Tony refused to pry himself from Steve’s wonderfully sculpted body for even a second, and would’ve been embarrassed about the way he ground up against said body had Steve not been moaning like a porn star. Each time it ended the same way. They’d get each other off, and there’d be a quiet moment when there was nothing but just breathing as Tony’s upstairs brain came back online and urged him to ask Steve to dinner, to coffee, to anything, because quickies in parking lots and pool showers weren’t  enough. Tony wanted him in very sense of the term, and it was awful. He was a sadistic fuck for it, because he knew it could only last until he left for MIT. And there was Steve. Steve who was literally working three jobs back to back every day, who spent the small amount of free time he hardly even had with his mouth on Tony’s dick and a hand on his own. That had to count for something, didn’t it?
Steve was laying it on heavy, Tony can see it in his face. He’s intentionally pushing every button he can reach-but he scoot’s back immediately at Tony’s request worry just barely breezing through his features.
"Pops?" She called worriedly, voice wavering. Something in her told her he wasn't there. She decided she wasn't going to call for him again. She was a big girl now. Six years old. She was good at figuring out how to get out of trouble.
“He didn’t invite you to go?” She asked, it was obvious she was getting at something, and Tony was starting to get frustrated.
Steve grinned.
“You got a condom?” Steve asked, sitting back on his feet, stroking himself lazily as he looked down in front of him, fingers still pumping in and out of Tony’s hole.
Steve didn’t even realise when he got back to the tower-it had been a good hour and a half, but all he could think about it what he’d done by leaving the guy breathing, what was going to happen-if Tony found out it would be over, if Tony knew Steve would lose him forever, and then there was no point. He’d keep running for sure, but he’d stop being careful.
him, Natasha-" Tony snapped. "I'm just going to tell him Morgan's-"
“You’ve been at that for hours.” Steve said behind him, the heat somehow made him quieter too, like even the sound was reluctant to move through the thick air. Steve seemed practically unbothered by it all. He didn’t even act like he felt it, but it was clear that he did. Fantastically. There was nothing better than a sweat glistened Steve Rogers, Tony was positively certain of that. He stole a glance over his shoulder, Steve was in the open kitchen behind him, sketching lazily and listening to the radio drone on about the heat, begging those without power to get to the designated schools and libraries. The sun shone down through the window illuminating still floating dust-he hadn’t been to the house in years, it’s sat still and unused in all that time. It all made the light around Steve seem somehow more golden. It played off the bare skin of his back-he hadn’t even bothered putting on a shirt upon waking up that morning- and Tony wished he could take a picture. A real physical picture so he could remember this peace forever.
“Tell me,” Tony said. leaning up to bite at Steve’s shoulder. There was something hot about Steve being naked over him, hard cock pressing into his thigh while Tony was fully clothed. He was probably getting a precum stain from the weepy head of Steve’s cock. Steve ruted against Tony’s leg and pushed his blazer jacket down over his arms and started working on his shirt buttons.
"We know you care, Steve. If you didn't we wouldn't be asking you to do this in the first place." She said, repositioning  herself so she could look him in the eyes.
and when Steve turns his head Tony can see that his mouth is upon and the vein on the side of his head is standing out but not a damn sound is coming out of his mouth as he paints the wall in front of him with his release.
Not for the first time he considered going to the lake himself.
“ I know,” Steve said quietly, still moving. “ I know that, Tony. I like making you feel good.” At that Tony smiled and did his best to move with Steve, to maximise the friction.
“Oxy? Really, Tony?” Steve asked, opening the bottle and shaking out a pill. He popped it in his mouth and turned on the tap, bending over it to take a sip of the water directly from the faucet.
“ There’s things I haven’t told you,” Steve started, and Tony froze, fork halfway to his mouth.
“ Night Steve. See you in the morning.”
“I’m sober enough to want to know why you stopped,” Tony said, grabbing Steve by the collar of his shirt and pulling him down, this time taking the chance to dominate the kiss, to make sure Steve knew just what he thought of him. Steve pulled away too soon. He shifted, pinning Tony to the tree by his hips. Tony didn’t have to see him very well to know that he was smiling. He felt a tongue run up his neck again, teeth on his earlobe-Tony had to bite back the sound that threatened to come out of him. Steve’s hot breath over his ear went straight to his dick.
“I’ll call you alright?”
“Jesus christ,” Tony breathed into Steve’s neck, smiling. He stroked Steve a few times, removing his hand only to spit in it and return it to Steve’s throbbing member. He twisted his hand on the pull, just the way he liked it himself. A little vein throbbed just under the pink head, Tony could feel it, and desperately wanted it in his mouth. He lowered himself down, moving so he was on his stomach on the car bench. He ground his hips a few times, delighting in the friction of the seat against his dick.
Upon seeing the kitchen empty Steve felt the Kid relax.
"She's got wild amount of nutrition related health issues. Her cardiovascular system is weak, theres dystrophy in the muscles in her legs and arms-"
“They won’t.” He knew that for a fact. They’d killed every last one of them. Every single one. That was the way it had to be. There was no chance of surviving if any one of them had remained alive. “We’re almost there. We have to keep going.”
Tony couldn’t do it. Steve ground down again and he came like a dry humping teenager.
“We’re going to have a feast,” He said, grinning, tearing open a few more packages for the kid before opening several for himself. He didn’t think they’d ever tasted so good. Once there was five of them in him he felt a little more alert. He was able to assess his injuries, and the Kid’s, for that matter. He was in the middle of just that when her tiny voice floated into his head.
Steve was knocked out on the bed on top of the covers, one arm under his head, the other sprawled out, extended towards Tony’s empty side of the bed. Steve was also naked as the day he was born and
Steve didn’t look down at her
Tony wasn’t sure why he was so surprised. Actually, he was. Steve was so please and thank you apple pie. He said yes Ma’m and yes Sir to teachers, he wore button up shirts to school. That didn’t change the fact that his tongue was in Tony’s mouth, that didn’t change the fact that he had his knee slotted between Tony’s legs. He didn’t pull back until Tony started to feel sort of light headed. For the life of him he couldn’t figure out how they’d gotten here. The frisbee. That’s what it was. Tony could barely see the neon yellow on the ground just to their left, but was incredibly distracted when Steve’s hot mouth was on his neck. He’d been doing well up until then, but how was he supposed to
“Go to hell.” Steve  rasped. He could hear the man in the white coat pick up something metal. Then then something… rolling? There was an electric whirring and then the table was tilting up, so he was in an upright position. Steve grunted from the discomfort of it.
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed together like that. Tony atop of Steve's chest, his head resting in the crook of his neck-but sooner or later, Steve got up, and Tony, despite the uncomfortable stickiness of his thighs, wished he hadn’t. When Steve returned, it was with a warm towel. He wiped Tony off, then cleaned himself, the pulled the covers back and tucked Tony under them. He got under himself, and held Tony close. Pressing a kiss to the side of his head before leaning over him to turn out the light. Before Steve laid back down, he leaned over Tony and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
The coffee mug shattered on the ground.
It was dark in the bedroom when Tony finally emerged from the workshop, asleep on his feet. It was late, much later than he said he would be. He showered in the lab bathroom, not wanting to bustle around in the room too much while Steve was sleeping. The high pressure and hot water was for once more than enough to get his brain to start slowing down. He was on auto pilot, not thinking about much of anything. He might of fallen asleep leaning against the  wall of the elevator had JARVIS not prompted him that he’d reached their floor.
“...no. I’m not kidding. Nothing to kid about. Why would I kid?” He was talking too much, but that was just because he couldn’t really hear himself over the sound of his heart thumping in his ears.
Nothing happened for a very long time. Long enough that he thought maybe she’d gone to sleep. He was heading that way too when she finally stood. There was something wrong with her gait. She walked with an odd sort of limp, and Steve’s stomach chilled as she got closer. If she decided to hurt him there wasn’t going to be much he could do about it. She didn’t hurt him. She sat down next to him and tentatively, slowly, laid a hand on his own.
There was a long moment before Natasha said anything. For a panicked second Steve thought she’d hung up.
The past four days had been a whirlwind. Tony wasn’t sure what to do, how to feel. There weren’t exactly words that described the emotion predominantly cloaking his brain. There was nothing but confusion. Relief, but mostly confusion. He stood behind the glass quarantine cell currently containing Steve and the kid. The kid who stuck to Steve like a tumor. The kid who’d killed four people in the process of detainment. Tony wan’t sure what to think of that. She was dangerous, that was obvious, but also obvious was the fact that there was no way in hell she’d be parting from Steve anytime soon, if Steve’s behavior had been anything to lead by.
Steve spent a lot of his time on the phone when he got back to the penthouse. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to find her, but he needed to do it soon. It was possible she wasn’t even in the country, and it’s been a long time since they’d seen one another, let alone spoken, but they’d left off on good terms, despite it all.
By time the conversation was over, they’d reached the tower,and Steve thanked the guy and paid, then got out of the car with a sigh. He didn’t really want to face Tony, but he did a lot of things he didn’t want to do, so he pressed the button and waited for the elevator.
She looked at him like she was deliberating, and for a moment Tony worried he hadn’t covered the bruise well enough.
The rest of his run was truly uneventful, and he made his way back to Tony’s unnecessarily expensive penthouse house through back alleys and streets to avoid anybody getting in his way. He took a little longer than usual to try and calm himself down. What’d he’d seen had been all too familiar. There was no way in hell he was just going to let that happen, not if he could help it.  Tony didn’t need to see him like that though, all puffed up and angry. Steve refused to let Tony see him like that, so he pushed himself harder and ran until he was exhausted to the point that all he could think about was going home and getting in the shower. When he got to Tony’s building and walked past the reception to the elevator he stopped. He could still feel it, simmering under the surface. The frustration, the anger. He wanted to punch something. He’d go to the boxing gym later in the day to see if working the bag would fill his need to...whatever it was he needed to do. Steve wasn’t even sure himself.
“Eh, it wasn’t that hard. I mean you obviously didn’t do it, and I’m kind of a genius.”
And then there was the heat of Tony’s mouth and Steve couldn’t, he couldn’t stay quiet, a moan tore out of him as he let his hands settle in Tony’s hair, doing everything in his power to keep his hips from snapping forward as Tony worked his magic. Tony took him all the way, and Steve could feel the head of his cock brushing the back of his throat-and that did it. That was all it took. He muttered a choked off warning and tried to pull away, but Tony held onto his hips and sucked the whole thing out of him.
“ Steve!” It was Pepper. She was sitting at her desk, rummaging through sheets of paper. Steve put on a happy face and turned to look at her. “ Oh, god what happened to your face?”
“You can’t stand there forever.”
“Hm,” Steve hummed, kissing Tony soundly, effectively straddling his hips. “I’m gonna make you feel good.” He said, voice low and husky, Tony made a small sound of disapproval.
"It's hard, seeing your child here." Maria said into the silence of the room. Tony had been caught up in Morgan's face, in the ways it'd changed and the ways it'd stayed the same. He looked up at his mother, eyes misty.
“ I won’t-I’m not gonna touch em’, ever again, you got my..you got my word.” Steve pulled the guy off the ledge and smiled. “Good, that’s good. See, that wasn’t so hard, was it?”  he asked, straightening the guy’s shirt and hair. The guy nodded and laughed nervously, standing rigid and still. His eyes flicked to the door behind Steve.
“Fuck,” he breathed, pulling away, leaning sideways so he slid off of Steve’s lap and onto his back on the seat, and Steve followed him, sealing their mouths together again and rolling his hips, grounding down hard.
Steve hadn’t even heard him.
“Y’ need sleep.” He murmured, “Jus got t’ sleep.” Tony snickered a little and pulled the blanket up wiggling closer. He laid there and waited for sleep to come to him. He set a number in his head and started counting back to zero. He was almost asleep when Steve spoke again, surprising him.
He was still the same as he was when Steve had left. He still moved the same, spoke the same. He still took his coffee the same and made the same sound when he was frustrated.
“He’s out at some boxing thinggy I think. Said he had some stuff he needed to work out.”
“Yeah, well the world isn’t fair, babe. Now turn around so I can wash your hair.” Steve sighed and did as he was told, ecstatic to find the back under complete control.
And then he woke up, gasping and cursing, putting a hand around his cock and squeezing before he even knew Tony was there. Tony, in the meantime, had slipped his hand into his pants to rub his thumb back and forth over the head of his cock, watching every twitch of Steve’s body as he cools down, maintaining the firm grip on the base of his cock until his erection began to flag.
They’d taken his uniform, when had they taken his uniform? In it’s place he wore what appeared to be a light green scrubs. It’s rough fabric was like sandpaper on his wounds.
“Who?” he asked, stacking the remaining uneaten bars in the corner. There were twenty nine of them left.
“I think we’ve established that. You sound tense. Looking for some fun?” Steve let out a breath, looking at the bed. There wasn’t a wrinkle on it. It still wasn’t right. He pulled everything off of it, starting over from square one.
He’d been strapped to the table for a long time. Three days? Maybe it was longer? He was bleeding. Had been bleeding. He could feel his blood saturated shirt beginning to stick to his back.  Steve cracked his eyes open, wondering if the too bright overhead light was still on.
There was already about thirty people there. Tony was late, but only by about forty five minutes. He’d tried to be his usual fashionably late self, but it seemed impossible. He spotted Steve almost immediately, standing at a table with a hodgepodge of hard liquor, beer and mixers set atop it. Tony made a beeline.
He thought, with a small smile. He liked that. He really liked that.
“You…” Tony couldn’t breathe. He huffed and tried to catch his breath. He turned over and closed his eyes. A moment later, after cleaning up, Steve moved to curl up behind him and wrap an arm around his middle. Tony could feel his mouth on his shoulder. It wasn’t the only thing he could feel. Steve was hard still, his dick trapped at the base of Tony’s ass. “ You didn’t have to do that, you know,” Tony said, moving to press his ass firmly onto Steve’s dick. He smiled when he heard him gasp and felt Steve start moving, taking advantage of the position of his dick, which was now between Tony’s thighs. “I don’t want you to ever feel like you owe me anything- I know I joke, but I mean it Steve.”
“I guess we’re both caught then. To what do I owe the pleasure? It’s been a long time. Saw you on TV. Didn’t think I’d be hearing from you again.” There was something in her voice, Steve wasn’t sure exactly what it was. He wished he could see her face. She was hard to read, but he’d always found he could do it. They were the same in that way, and many others.
“ What’re you talking about?” Steve asked, voice low, Matt stayed still.
“ Steve, stop, don’t be sorry. You said no and I kept pushing. I shouldn’t have.” Steve looked absolutely tortured.
“ Fine, fine,”
What the fuck just happened?
“ Foggy,” Matt said in warning-he clearly thought there was something valuable to her request. “ If you’re telling me that finding this guy will get you closer to arresting this...this killer, I’ll do it.”
“I told you,” Steve moaned, like he was embarrassed, but not ashamed. “I wiated for you. Didn’t…didn’t touch myself. I didn’t make myself come. I wouldn’t even fuck myself on my fingers,” from the look on his face it seemed like Steve had really wanted to. From the state of his dick Tony knew he wasn’t lying.
“Why’re you doing this?Why are you hurting people?” Steve shook his head and got off him and pulled him to his feet so quickly the guy was reeling.
"I'll do it." he said simply. There was a look between Natasha and Bruce, as if they hadn't expected him to agree so easily. " Are we done here? I gotta get back. If she wakes up and I'm not there it's not gonna be good."
Tony sat upright so quickly he nearly lost his balance. He looked around wildly for the sound of the voice. It couldn’t be who he thought it was.
him. His eyes moving up and down, shamelessly taking in Tony’s well fitting clothes. There was a light in his eyes Tony’d never seen before. He finished up pouring his drink-Tony could smell it from where he was standing. Tequila.
Tony stilled. Steve said it. They hadn’t said it yet, and Steve just said it, like it was no big deal, like they said it every night, like it was normal, and Tony had no clue what to do. He swallowed thickly and took a deep breath, trying to regulate his breathing so he wouldn’t freak Steve out. Well, he had to say it back, he had to. Steve had said it, and Tony felt it too, he loved him, more than anything he loved Steve Rogers, but when he opened his mouth to say it no sound came out. Finally, Tony cleared his throat.
, so he let his hands roam down Steve’s chest, his sides he gives Steve’s dick a squeeze and takes it in hand with his own for a moment, only touching lightly, his hand too dry for much more. He brought his fingers back up to stick in Steve’s mouth.
And then he was gone, turning down the street and into the darkness, and Tony was once more left alone, wondering not what the hell had just happened, but
Tony woke before Steve and turned off his running alarm. He spent a good five minutes staring at his face. The swelling had seemingly gotten worse, or maybe it was just the fact that the bruising had darkened. He tried to go back to sleep, but it was useless, so he got up, showered and got dressed for the day. By eight o'clock, he was up in the kitchen, reading the paper from a tablet, sipping on his coffee. The early morning hours had a certain unique quietness to them. Tony wasn’t sure how he’d never noticed it before. Maybe it was because normally at this hour he’d be hung over-but that was before Steve. To be completely honest, Tony wasn’t even sure if Steve knew-
“Are you okay? You seem kind of...out of it, I guess.” Tony noticed. Tony noticed, and Steve just wanted to punch something, because he was supposed to be doing better than this, he was supposed to be keeping things under control. He hadn’t been out to take care of business in almost a week, and his skin was crawling with frustration.
"Morgan!"
was more like it. Tony moaned, pulling Steve into a messy, teeth clicking kiss. Steve didn’t indulge him for long.
“I don’t like that. I’m not sure I really want to know.” Tony said, shaking his head, taking a few steps back, feeling suddenly very unsafe. He watched as the kid laid a hand on Steve’s bare arm, an arm much skinner than the one Tony was-had been used to.
“I’m here, Tony.” he said at least, but voice hoarse and airy.
“ I wouldn’t dream of it.” Tony said, turning in his hold and leaning up to kiss him. Steve deepen it, needing the contact and needing the closeness. Tony pulled back, breathing hard. “You alright Steve-o?” God, he could tell. He could tell and Steve had to swallow the flash of anger that came from his own failure to compose himself.
Natasha scoffed.
“ I missed you today,” he murmured, trailing his lips down, kissing Steve’s shoulder and across his chest to the other. He kissed down and latched onto a nipple, making Steve cry out. “I came up during lunch and you were sleeping like a baby, I couldn’t bring myself to wake you up.” Tony sat up a little and looked down at the expanse of naked skin below him. All the little scars and blemishes made sense now. Tony had always thought they were just from boxing-but now, not that he knew...he spent more time kissing them, running his tongue over them, doing everything he could to take the pain out of them.
Steve kept his mouth shut. He knew what was happening, he knew exactly what was happening.
Tony doesn’t remember the mad dash to the field. His mind only checks back in once he’s actually there. He can’t see her. Had she gone in the mere minutes it’d taken them to get there? He calls her name, and nothing happens. Some birds take off from a random tree. The wind blows. Tony looks back at Natasha, who nods to Tony's three o' clock. A little head peeps above the grass. Tony feel weak in the knees as he walks slowly in her direction, despite his every last urge being to run. He approaches her carefully, remembering his own disorientation on arrival.
"How's Steve?" Tony asked. Nat grimaced and shook her head.
“I would’ve stayed with you if I could-”
Tony frowned and shook his head. “And I had plans, too.” he muttered, patting Steve’s jaw and moving away towards the bedroom.
With shaky hands she pulled out the camera. She sat down at her desk, looking around the office, eyes darting from Tony’s office door to the modern space around her. From the waiting room couches, to the the mini fridge stocked full of water, juice, soda and coffee. It was all familiar, yet in no way comforting. She opened the camera, taking a steading breath. She knew she couldn’t go down to the consolation with Tony. She knew now would be the only time she could prep the video file to show him. She had an hour and a half. Maybe two hours before he came back up here. He’d be angry, that’d be hard to work around. He wouldn’t want to listen to her. She’d have to figure out a way to force him.
“Don’t call me that.” He said, but it sounded way more like ‘fuck you.’ Before Tony had any sense to apologize, though he wasn’t exactly sure what he’d be apologizing for, Steve was pressing into him.
teve unintentionally jerked his hips up into Tony’s mouth. He started to pull out so he could apologize, but Tony just hummed around him and put his hands on his hips to keep him in place.
He left the room, shutting and locking the door carefully. Not having her in his direct sight wasn't hard when he knew she was safe, and that she wasn't in any position to unintentionally hurt anybody else or herself. They hadn't talked about the four men she'd killed on the night of their arrival. How does one explain a thing like that to ten year old? At least that's how old they
“I want you to stop for a sec,” Tony grunted, doing everything he could to actually catch his breath, to focus, because
Steve grunted behind him and kissed the back of his neck, still thrusting, Tony knew he was close, he could tell by the way he was breathing.
“Such a boyscout,” Tony murmured, standing back up slowly, running his tongue along the trail of one of the drips from the popsicle. It’s mingled with Steve’s sweat, but the salty sweet of it is positively intoxicating. So much so that Tony doesn’t stop when he’s got his first finger in Steve, or the second. He licks and suck until it’s all gone.
get hard with Steve doing that to him?
He finally managed to get ahold of himself by time they reached the courthouse steps, which was a blessing, as cameras flashed at him from every angle and microphones were shoved in his face, Tony simply pushed him forward into a black car with tinted windows. As soon as the door shut, Tony let out a huff of air.
Had they waited a few seconds longer, They'd of seen Steve stir and slowly wake. They'd of seen the kid point exactly to where they had been standing.
“What the fuck did you dream about?” Tony asked when words finally came back to him.
“No? A pity. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
Was the next thing that came from the kitchen, and Tony sank back in his booth at the sound of the too angry voice, the image of his father coming to him for the first time in a long time, since the funeral.
Morgan was very confused. She was looking up at a bright blue cloud filled sky. One of the clouds looked like a fluffy white cat, which was sort of funny until she realized this was not the place she fell asleep in. She'd fallen asleep somewhere dark and damp. It smelled like wet rock and the walls made a sound like breathing. The floor was cold and wet and lined with tiny, pointy rocks.It was a bad place to be. She doesn't remember why she was there, as there was no way her Pops would even let her out of his sight.
" I was actually--" Tony squinted. "Roast beef?"
. His cock was hard, straining against his stomach, a little sticky wet spot under the head as it twitched and pulsed from whatever the hell Steve was dreaming about that had him so wound up.
“Do you know—“ he paused, reassessing his approach. “What are they trying to do here? Do you know that? Can you tell me?”
“What’re ya doin’ up?” Steve mumbled, sitting up and squinting at him sleepily with his good eye. Tony smiled at all the Brooklyn in his voice, it came out the most when he was tired or not paying attention.
“It’s alright. Maybe you can make it up to me.” Steve murmured, breath hot in Tony’s ear. He shifted, and Tony could feel a length pressed to the back of his thigh. He was hard as a rock. Hard like he’d been that way for a while. “I was dreaming about you.”
“ Yeah. Yeah, I’ve known him for a while.”
Steve was flushed, red creeping all the way down to his chest. His eyes were screwed shut tight, his back was pressed flush to the tiled wall of the shower. He was jerking himself off slowly, so slowly it was frustrating Tony. A small sound dropped out of Steve’s mouth, and Tony stepped back a little, not wanting to be seen just yet. He watched as Steve rolled his hips into his hand, his head tilting back until it was resting against the tile. He rolled his hips again, so achingly slowly-Tony gaped as Steve slapped a hand over his mouth, trying to cover up the breathy sounds that trickled out of him.
Steve laughed lightly and sat forward. “ Who says I’ve had practice?” They were close now. Steve was taking up the open space in the car, and Tony could feel his breath on his face. For half a second he got lost in those eyes and how bright they were, in the laugh lines next to them-but the car stopped and he was pulled out of his trance. Tony cleared his throat and opened the car door.
Steve woke with a sudden gasp and the intense urge to vomit. When had he been placed back here? When had he lost consciousness? For how long? Steve put an hand over his mouth, scooting up to sit up fully. He looked down to his side. The Kid was there. She wouldn’t look at him, but she was awake, her fingers just brushing the skin on his shoulder.
“Because I think ahead. I’ll need an alibi. I’ve already got a record. You don’t.” he stepped back from the bed, studying it, deciding it was passable before moving through the penthouse to the kitchen, knowing there would be a mess there. He glanced at the doughnuts sitting in the box on the counter. He’d bring them up to the office as soon as he was sure Natasha was on board. If she wasn’t, he wasn’t sure who else he’d be able to call.
“Thanks. I’m fine. Gotta go to work in three hours-“
“ A little bit? That’s why you can’t breathe through your nose, right?” Tony asked, hopping off his stool and moving to one of the cupboards. From it he took an orange pill bottle. “You’re taking it easy today. Eat something, take one of these and go back to sleep.”
“ I think she can hear us,”  Bruce muttered, brow furrowed in interest. “…Do you think she’s human?”
He’d struggled to no avail. Things had been bad then, but an agent tried to grab the child from his arms, and that had been then end of it. The little girl had flung an arm up, palm out. The agent touching her went flying, and hit the wall with a sickening crack, a bloody stain on the wall where his head had hit. Things pretty much just went to shit from there, and Tony was more or less forced to leave the room. He saw the footage, though. He saw how with just a clench of her tiny fist the kid crushed skulls and ribcages from feet away. Nothing good would come of power like that.
After some time, and some time distracted by a grasshopper, Morgan decided she should climb a tree. She'd be able to see everything from there, so she set off all the way across the field to the tallest tree she could see.
“ Who the hell are you? How did you get in here? Jarvis? How did these two-“ Steve couldn’t speak. Tony looked tired. He stood there, in a grease stained shirt, chipped coffee mug in hand, fury in his face. The features smoothed, then wrinkled again. This time with confusion.
“Nah, I think I’ll be fine.” Steve watched with no small amount of shock as Matt easily made his way across the floor to the ring and hoisted himself up inside of it.
Without the AC the house became an oven, and the generators hadn’t been used in so long they were fried. He wondered for a moment why they’d never been replaced-but the question was answered when he himself attempted to remember the last time they’d actually been needed, or that last time he’d ever thought of them, really. The only reason they were staying in the San Fernando house in the first place was to lay low for a couple of days, it was the only reason he ever went to the San Fernando house-who the hell would bum it in the valley for funsies? Tony laughed to himself and shook his head, flicking his sweat damp hair out of his eyes every five minutes.
“ no-” That voice was cut off and an older voice interrupted. Strong and defiant.
“ I...it was a while ago. A year and a half, maybe.”
Tony wasn’t ready to think about it all yet. For now, she was there with him, and she was happy and falling back to sleep in his arms as he walked her out of the field.
“I thought I saw you.” Tony whirred around to come face to face with-well face to pectoral, rather, with Steve Rogers. He was looking at him oddly, the corners of his mouth kept twitching, like he was trying to refrain from smiling. Realizing he was just standing there stupidly, Tony ran a hand through his hair, doing his best to be cool, looking at Steve over his sunglasses.
Tony wants to know more than anything. He wants Steve to come more than anything, the thought of him not having done so for the entirety of their separation was almost distressing, so if this was what was going to make Steve go off Tony was by all means for it.
Holy cow, I started this when I was seventeen and haven't touched it since. I'm working on editing the story as a whole, and I'm planning to stop being a literal piece of garbage and actually finish it.
“Tony you have to go to the field now, we have to go right now I’ll explain-”
“You didn’t have to do that baby,” Tony said, dipping his head down to lick a stripe along Steve’s cock. Steve’s hands shoot to Tony’s hair and his hips cant up, looking for more simulation from Tony’s hot, wet mouth.
Tony hardly waited for Steve to put the truck in park outside of his house before he was on him, sliding across the bench into his lap, bracketing Steve’s thighs with his knees. Steve arched up to meet his mouth half way, and Tony let his hands tangle in that blond hair. He picked up where he’d left off, licking into Steve’s mouth, sucking on his bottom lip as he ground down, allowing himself the friction he’d so badly wanted from the moment they’d gotten into the car. Steve let out a little grunt, his hips canting up, attempting better angle. Tony could feel how hard he was, how
“ Yeah, you gotta problem with that?”Matt took a few steps back and put his hands up, and Steve took that as his chance to get a couple of punches in. Matt staggered back.
Tony faltered only for a moment.
“Tell us about Rebirth.”
licking into Steve’s mouth, sucking on his tongue, biting at his lower lip as he pulled away. He got a moan for that, and already half hard Tony wasn’t sure how much of this he could take without having Steve actually touching him.
“ I’ll take it you come ‘round here often” he commented, waiting for Matt to throw the first punch. Something was off here. Something didn’t feel right-Steve wasn’t able to figure out what it was, however, as one of Matt’s feet hit him square in the chest. He stumbled back a little, no longer hesitant.
“ Well,” Steve said, punching him in the face hard while he was disoriented, he fell back, having lost consciousness. “ It’s a long story.” He said, jumping out of the ring and grabbing his things quickly, more or less running out of the gym. He didn’t even wave down a taxi, his heart was racing to quickly, he just ran. There was something wrong. This guy, he knew too much. Steve didn’t know how he knew or how much, but he knew things that could ruin him-and he’d left him alive.
“ Really? Where’d you go? Which gym I mean. I haven’t seen many around.” She was digging. To the outside it had to sound like polite conversation, but Steve could tell when someone was trying to get information from him.
It was getting closer. Morgan stood up slowly, too scared and intrigued to move.
There was a dildo stuck to the shower wall with a suction cup, sheathed deep in Steve’s ass. Tony’d never seen it before. They had a couple of toys in a box in the closet-but Tony knew nothing about a suction cup dildo. There was something Tony found incredibly hot about that fact. He swallowed hard and pulled his hand away from his mouth. Frozen to the spot, he watched as Steve really started going out it. He placed both hands on the wall behind him started to fuck himself in earnest, pulling all the way off and slamming back hard, grunting as he swiveled his hips in tiny circles when he was as full as he could be. Tony could tell he was close. He could tell by the way his hips started stuttering, the way his abdomen rippled and flexed, the way his hand returned to his  dick, thumb messaging the head in rough back and forth strokes over the slit.
“No,” She said finally, shaking her head, her mind finally pushing through the fear. “No, not in a bad way, at least. A girlfriend from college came into town last night. You know how it goes.” She laughed, and to her credit it sounded real.
"I thought you were hungry," Steve said, almost forgetting she'd said anything. That was happening a lot lately. "Food's in the kitchen."
“Do you know, exactly, the extent of what she can do?”
“I think I’m almost done. Don’t worry about it.” He reassured, unable to tear his eyes away from Steve eating the damn popsicle- because now it was apparent he had intentions. The way he was eating the popsicle could only be described as lewd. He swirled the tip of his tongue around the top and let it trail down, then back up to the top, which he popped into his mouth with a small moan.
“ Well, there’s this fella I’ve been talking to,” Steve said, running a hand through his hair, smiling crookedly. Tony felt his heart flutter. “ He’s been real good to me through this whole ordeal. Been figuring I’d ask him to a movie or something- seems he’s beat me to it.”
“You won’t let him see this right I don’t need him comin’ for me. We ain’t exactly on the best of terms.”
“I gotta go. Habit you know.” Steve said, bending over quite purposefully to pull his socks on, Tony cursed under his breath.
“Does this have anything to do with the case Stark worked a while back? The double murder?” the blind one, Matt asked.
“I don’t have time for this shit, Tony.” Steve huffed, and he was on his way again. Panicked, Tony blurted out the first thing that came to mind.
"Be careful." is all she said. Tony could tell she wanted to say more, but she didn't. "Ring me when the little one wakes up."
The room was dead quiet. Steve could feel a drop of sweat rolling down the back of his neck, and he had a golf ball sized lump in his throat. He watched carefully as the judge was handed an envelope , and held his breath as it was opened. He balled his fist at his side as the man leaned forward to the microphone and opened his mouth to give the verdict.
?" Tony asked, annoyed. Natasha put her hands up defensively.
“ I don’t know who you are, or what you think you’re doing, but I’d heavily advise you to stop.”
“Nuh uh. You get my dick this hard you’re gonna use it. C’mere.” Tony spins so Steve the one with his back to the wall, and the sound he makes when Tony presses him there is positively pornagraphic.
“Get your shoes, we have to go to the field.” Natasha said. She sounded desperate. Nat, even after all this time, wasn’t a person who could be read. She kept a stone face at all times, but now? The stone was broken, she looked close to tears, and that made Tony afraid. So he put on his shoes, and he and Natasha set out.
Tony shrugged. “ I’m fine. I’ll be even better after a cup of coffee and some good conversation.” He pulled open the door to the coffee shop and held it for Steve.
from Steve’s chest as he does his best to push back to meet Tony’s thrusts.
“This better? You want me to fuck you harder? Make you come all over the wall without me even having to touch you? This what you wanted all along?” Tony asked, his mouth completely dislodged from his brain running on it’s own accord between groans he bights into Steve’s shoulder as he picks up the pace, relishing in the sound of sweat slick skin meeting sweat slick skin.
“Alright, it’s fine just try for me, okay? Focus.” There was a camera on a tripod next to him. Tony pressed record. “Okay. Does the kid have a name? Anything she answers to?”
“ ha ha,” Steve muttered- he was in a bad mood, but Tony had always been able to remedy that easily.
So he kept it up. He was more careful now, planned out his victims, made them look like suicides rather than having any fun,fun was what nearly got him caught in the  place, but it was enough for him. It worked, so he was thankful. When a taxi finally stopped for him, he got inside dragging his bag in after. They made small talk about boxing, the guy remarked that Steve looked too big for anyone to be landing any hits, and Steve made up some garbage about helping a guy train and letting him get a few licks in for the hell of it.
“Haven’t you seen enough?” Steve asked after swallowing. He wanted to talk about everything else. He wanted to talk about how he’d seen the funeral. About how he’d seen the news reels about Tony and Pepper sometime after. At the time he’d hated that they’d been shown to him, knowing the only purpose was to break him, but now he was quite glad. It wasn’t something he’d have to find out on his own.
The Denny’s was actually quite busy when he walked in, and Tony certainly wasn’t disappointed. One table was packed with boys he’d certainly gone to school with, they hardly spoke as they demolished huge piles of food, reeking of weed. Tony had half a mind to ask if they had any left. Another group was sitting to the right with two tables pushed together with about twelve people sitting around them, all holding Magic cards. There was a man in the far back who sat alone, if it could called sitting. He was slumped so far back in his booth one could mistake him for dead. Tony felt buzzed just looking at him.
“I’m glad too, it smells amazing.” Tony said, sitting down, waiting to grab his fork until Steve sat down too. He was actually starving, he hadn’t eaten anything all day-there was no better first meal than Steve’s fettuccine Alfredo.
There was a long moment where all he could really do was lay there and catch his breath. Tony tucked him back into his pants and tied the drawstring again, then returned to his spot in Steve’s lap kissing up his neck to his mouth.
“I think it’s my turn,” he said, sitting up. Tony took a moment to look at him. Steve’s chest heaved, and momentarily Tony wondered if his nipples were sensitive. Tony reached out, fingers dancing at the zipper of Steve’s work pants as he sat up properly, training his mouth down Steve’s neck, sucking a hickey there, living for the sounds Steve made as he did so. While he busied himself with Steve's neck, Tony worked open his pants, popping open the button and sliding down the zipper, too eager to tease his hand went immediately inside Steve’s underwear, closing around his dick.
He’d never felt so loved.
“M’not telling you shit. That’s classified.” Barns shifted uncomfortably, but he seemed interested. “ What do you wanna know for anyway? Thought Steve was in jail.” That made him look sad, and Pepper wondered what exactly the relationship between Steve and this man had been.
"You don't know how it happened?" Maria asked, her voice hushed. Tony had nearly not gone to get her, afraid that Morgan might wake up to find him missing, but she was the only one he could really get advice from.
“I need your help finding someone.” Pepper said. It was odd, being in this part of the city. It wasn’t the daily norm she was used to, but Hell’s Kitchen had it’s charm.  "He might be related to something? Um, the Howling Commandos. It might be a secret military team-I’m not sure. There’s notes there. I took the liberty to print a copy in braille as well.” Pepper said, biting her lip. Pushing the file towards the men sitting across form her. She was sat across from Neslon and Murdock, the only law firm who’s likely be able to help her. Not because they had the means, exactly, but because they were the only firm crazy enough to call her in for a meeting after being contacted at two in the morning.
If only he knew then what he knew now.
Steve lets out a particularly loud grunt. His hips move, ever so slightly, like he’s trying to break the confined of sleep and fuck the air. His cock is actually
“No. I’m worried she’s putting her nose where it doesn’t belong. She might know too much. If anyone can convince him of it it’s her. She’s got to go.” Finally, he started placing the pillows. He arranged them exactly the same as he had before, smoothing out their corners so they were wrinkle free.
“You want me to fuck you against the wall?” Tony asked. Usually it was the other way around. Usually Steve would lift him up, and Tony’d wrap his legs around his waits and let gravity get Steve as deep in his as he possibly could. Tony knew he wouldn’t be strong enough to pick Steve up like that, but-
At least for the moment.
“You gotta talk to me about it. Tell me what happens.” Tony said quietly, sitting Morgan down on the kitchen table, fishing in the freezer for an ice pop. He found one. He always found what he was looking for when he looked for it, an odd property of the place they now found themselves in together. Morgan accepted it without a smile. The little girl just looked tired in a way no child had the right to.
Almost.
Steve didn’t turn. He pressed the button for the elevator and stepped on, letting the doors close before he turned and selected the lab floor. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, hating the enclosed space, feeling like his chest was too tight. The doors opened, and he was surprised to see Natasha.
- - - - -
Tony shifted Morgan in his arms.
“Everything alright?” He asks, but his voice is still all low and dripping with sensuality, he looked like he was actually making a physical effort to sit still, to not lean forward and talk Tony’s dick right back into his mouth. That was a lot for a guy to take in-and Tony mind took it and ran with it, thinking of just how nice it was that Steve was so eager to get those pretty popsicle stained lips wrapped around his cock.
Tony was talking to him, but Steve couldn’t hear him. He was laser focused on the screen on the table between them, watching Bruce examine the Kid. She was out cold, entirely defenseless. He didn’t like it. It made his entire body vibrate with anxious anxiety.
“Did he do that to you?” She asked. She looked scared. Tony knew why. He didn’t exactly have the best track record when it came to picking his partners, men or women. There had been two separate occasions, things had gone that way. Too far that way. Tony’d been wearing concealer for weeks before anyone had noticed. Pepper had cried when she'd found out. It had taken him a long time to convince her that it wasn't he fault she hadn't noticed. That was done now, and frankly Tony was pissed she’d assumed Steve was another one of those types. Her personal opinions of him be damned.
“ No, Pepper. Steve had nothing to do with those murders and you know that. I don’t see why you’re so bent on proving he’s not a good guy-he’s never been anything but sweet to me and I don’t appreciate you talking about something you know nothing about. Now, if you could be so kind, I need you to file the paperwork on Mr. Gonzales's auto accident case.Her hearing is tomorrow at eleven” And with that, Tony grabbed his coat and left the office. Pepper worried about him, he knew that. She was worried about him taking the case in the first place, and worried about him no matter what. Tony loved her for that, he really did- but accusing Steve of something he hadn’t done-something he’d had to suffer for...that crossed the line.
“Since when are you up this early?” Steve asked, shuffling into the room. He was all sleepy and bed ruffled, Tony hid a smile behind his coffee cup.
“Yeah, well he doesn’t have too.” The elevator doors closed, and Steve took a deep breath. His heart was already pounding at the aspect of dinner.
“You could stay here, you know.” Tony started, propping himself up on his elbows, watching Steve in the orange light that came in through the window from the driveway lights outside.
“Everything we’ve done to you. Every refusal means-“ He stopped talking and waved at the screen. A prod came into view, it buzzed as the  thing was pressed to the Kid’s middle. Her entire body twitched.
“Shit, I’ve got to go, Tony.” He said, tucking himself back into his pants and tossing the soiled shirt onto the floor of the passenger side.
“Well Tones, I’m gonna fuck you. Fuck you so hard you won’t know your left from right, you want that?” Steve asked, mouthing at Tony’s neck. Steve’s breath was hot in Tony’s ear as he talked, well,
"That's it then, I'm going to go down there." Tony muttered, thinking out loud.
“And what do I get outta this?”
" Sorry I'm late," He said, scratching the back of his head." She didn't fall asleep as quickly as I thought she would. "He sat down on the couch next to Natasha, adjacent from Bruce, who set down the mug of tea he'd been sipping from. There was a folder in his lap.
Tony bent his head slowly, blowing air on Steve’s cock, watching as it filled out again, standing proud in front of his face. It took everything Tony had not to take Steve until he choked.
“I’m clean, just go. Come on, move it, Rogers.” Tony said, gritting his teeth, rolling his hips. Steve removed his fingers, but nothing else happened. Tony looked up at him annoyed, but found hard eyes and a hard pressed mouth.
They carried on with their dinner, the conversation moving away from Steve’s time in the service and to idle chatter. If either man had been paying much attention at all, they’d of seen Pepper Potts standing just outside the door behind the wall, A pile of unsigned files at her feet. They would’ve seen her scribbling ‘Howling Commandos’ on the inside of her arm. But, as it happened, both Tony and Steve were far too involved in each other and the conversation to notice anything outside of it.
“ Hello? Earth to Steve?” Tony leaned forward and waved a hand in front of his face, Steve grabbed it and kissed it.
“Tell me what you want, babe.” Steve asked, breath now warm over the head of Tony’s twitching dick. Tony watched as Steve watched a bead op pre come well up there, watched as he leaned forward and lapped at it with the flat of his tongue.
“ What?” He asked, setting his fork down, the feeling of cold dread rising in his stomach. This was where Steve was going to tell him that there was someone else, that he didn’t want to be with him anymore. Tony knew it would be coming, but he didn’t think it would be coming so soon.
the hell could they do it again?
"They are," He corrected. "but nobody here's ever going to hurt you. They're happy you're here." Hungry himself and impatient with their pace, Steve gave in and hoisted the Kid up into his arms, finishing the walk in only a few moments. The Kid put her little hand on the back of his neck.
“Steve?” Tony asked, looking away. He swallowed thickly and looked Steve up and down, enjoying the view, generators completely forgotten.
“How the hell are they going to do that? I mean you saw-“ Bruce cut him off with a wave of his hand and a shake of his head.
“But the Mariners got another run in the-“ He was coming before he even knew it was happening. He hadn’t even been thinking about it, too focused on focusing on talking so Tony would keep going. And he did, Tony didn’t stop bobbing his head as Steve came, sucking him dry.
