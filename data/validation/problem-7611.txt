“Mr. Stark. That was quite a demonstration today.”
Steve frowned. “How much back-up did you bring?”
“And pray tell, what exciting activity would I enjoy more than a nice dinner with you, with the possibility of you naked in my bed?”
The door flung open, Raza stomping into the room. Yinsen stepped in front of Tony who was struggling to get up. “Leave him alone!” Yinsen cried. “You’ve asked too much of him already; his body needs time to recover.”
“I was doing my job,” Phil grit out.
When they reached the lab entrance, Steve looked down at Tony. “Now are you gonna behave or am I going to have to carry you up these stairs?”
He slunk away from the door, footsteps quiet in their temporary home. Bucky rounded the corner, reaching for the door when he was stopped by Clint.
“Then you’re going to have to be a little more specific, Buck,” Steve sighed. “Because I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.”
Tony gave a hollow chuckle. “Well that’s too bad for you, honeybuns. You dragged me into this, so it looks like you’re stuck with my pompous asshole. Now step aside, and let me work my magic.”
“See! There you go again. What work could you possibly have right now? We have no leads, no raids, nothing. Steve, you’re running on fumes. Go home and take a day.”
“Why the hell would you do something as stupid as that?” Pierce laughed.
“But I should have,” Tony retorted. And he really should have. His file compiled on The Ten Rings had more than enough proof of the games they like to play. Tony should have known that they would have eventually shifted their tactics to try and get them to comply.
“Well, what the fuck do you want to want to hear, then?” Clint shouted, throwing his arms in the air. “You clearly have all the answers, so why bother fuckin’ asking.”
“Of course we will,” Steve confirmed.
“Not yet,” Clint answered, jumping out of the car heading over to Phil.
“Yea ok, how about no. Actually better yet, just leave now.”
you, let’s sit down and talk about this.”
he thought to himself. “Nah, I’m alright, J. I just need to make a quick call to Pepper.”
Steve saw the wave of surprise that washed over Tony, quickly replaced with a small smile. Steve returned the smile easily, slowly rolling his hips.
Fury eyed Tony with curiosity. “Is that so?”
Lunch had come and gone, dinner as well, but Tony hadn’t even thought about going back home. Usually, when needed to get away, he would lock himself in his lab at the tower. However, seeing as there was still a possibility that it was still being overrun by an aggravated World War II relic, Tony had opted to hide out in his lab at the Avengers base in upstate New York.
“Unbelievable,” Steve sighed. “Fury is not stringing me along to do some recon as a stripper.”
know better. Everyone tried to stop him, but did he listen? No. He’d failed again.
JARVIS’s words had Tony tearing down the other side of the hallway, hoping to reach Obie before he’d descend the stairs. Steve was right – Obie couldn’t know that he was harboring The Commandos in his basement.
A glass shattered. Clint cringed.
“Hunting,” Bucky smiled.
innocent. I’ve never been convicted,” he said proudly.
“I talked with Pepper,” Tony started. “When I was taken, it took them a while to declare me as missing because my company apparently didn’t even know I was kidnapped.”
From: Natasha
When the door finally opened, Tony was not met with mobsters, but with what looked like a very pissed off policeman with-
“Some foreign exchange student from England. All the kids call him ‘the Vision’ for some reason. What a nerd.”
He froze when he heard Tony step behind him and clear his throat. Sighing softly, Steve pushed back from under the desk, leaning back on his knees. There, standing above him, was Tony, snickering as he twirled the pencil between his fingers.
stuck on the amount of red that would show up in their bank accounts for something that seemingly had zero return. But Clint was persistent, and his enthusiasm was infectious as always, chipping away at them until they caved.
Tony smiled.
But Tony stepped in front of Steve. “Like hell you will. You will not lay a single fucking finger on him. I won’t let you take him.”
Clint walked out, back down the stretch of hallway and, after noticing that the receptionist had slipped away, pocketed a handful of hard candy she had sitting out on her desk. Popping one in his mouth, he stepped over to Tony’s office when a sharp voice coming from inside stopped him.
“Shh,” Tony hushed again. “Sorry, sweetpea, but you’ve lost this one. Nothing you can say or do is gonna get me to leave. I’ll handcuff myself to the kitchen table if necessary.”
“How did this happen?” Hammer snapped, looking at his lackey’s lifeless body.
Steve was ready to ask again before Tony shook his head vehemently while pushing closer to Steve, as if burrowing further his chest. “No,” came the muffled reply. “I don’t want it.”
They were silent for a few moments, Tony syncing up with the deep breaths echoing out of the chest he leaned against, Steve’s calloused digits sinking into his hair.
To go help Natasha.
Tony’s breath stuttered in his chest, as if reality all came crashing back on him at once. The looming dread that the morning brought, the uncertainty of all their fates.
Which is why, almost a month later, Pierce found himself losing it. They had done nothing.
“Phillips had a lot of faith in you. Get the job done.” Steve gaped at the other man.
Tony sighed again, leaning into Steve’s chest before pushing away. “I’m not doing a very good job at explaining this.”
Steve flicked on a light, and opened the door. No one was there. The pounding started again, and Steve turned to find that the sounds had not come from the door, but from his window.
“She said she’ll see you,” the receptionist said, finally hanging the floor up. “Forty-seventh floor,” she said with a gesture to the elevator.
Steve was running towards the door before Rhodes had finished talking.
Tony grumbled in annoyance, opting to burrow further into Steve’s chest when the other man found quite amusing. “Tell them to go away,” Tony groaned.
"Anything?"
There was. Out, towards the middle of the river, stood a single man. Warning bells shot up in Steve’s mind, but he ignored them as he carefully stepped onto the ice. It didn’t matter. Nothing mattered until his family was safe.
Steve leaned up on one elbow. “You mean the press conference? Shutting down the weapons division?”
“I think I’ll get over it,” Steve argued, already trying to push up from the hot tub, already eager to see the rest of his family. But Tony pulled him back down.
The Captain gave a small smile. "What makes you think that I won't kill you right here? You got the jump on me once, but I don't make the same mistake twice."
“Natasha?”
“It was either me or them, Tony. And I chose the family. It wasn’t a hard decision. One that I’d happily make again.”
- hey, what's Fury been up to?
Steve took one of Tony’s hand and pushed it into his chest. “Come on, Tony. Breathe with me.” Tony felt the slow rise and fall of Steve’s chest, his own body trying to match it.
Another bullet flew past the two men taking cover behind some shipping boxes.
Tony leaned forward, reaching for the suitcase that had survived the whole jounrey, now blackened and dented from recent events. With shaking fingers, Tony carefully unlocked the clasps, sighing in relief when he saw the computer inside with a light blinking, indicating it still operational. Even if Tony didn’t have a phone, he might be still able to reach out to The Captain through the computer.
Tony collapsed against his chest, Steve’s arms automatically winding around the smaller man’s chest. “What do you want to do today?” Tony whispered.
Bucky wasn’t exactly sure why. He could scream himself hoarse with all the reasons that he should just run. He didn’t know where he would go, but it didn’t matter. Each step out there was one step closer to finding the rest of his family. Any punishment the FBI could dole out would pale in comparison to the long days he spent in an empty house, wondering if everyone he loved was alive. He’d been so angry with Tony, with
Loki shrugged nonchalantly. “Karma’s a bitch, isn’t she?”
But it wasn't. All that preparation, all that hard work.
Steve watched as Tony took everything in. Worst case, Tony would look at the camp like he did the mailbox – and well, anything they stopped to look at today. However, Tony’s face was carefully blank, like the wires in his head got crossed, and he wasn’t sure what to feel. The silence was deafening, and it kept getting longer. Steve swallowed around another bout of uncertainty. “You’re making a fella nervous,” Steve laughed anxiously. “Do you like it?”
“What more do you want me to do?” Steve asked loudly. “My question of the week can’t exactly be hey, are any of you murderers?” A woman bustled past him, but didn’t give him a second glance after his outburst.
A warm hand fell onto his shoulder. Tony barely managed to meet Barton’s gaze. “You saved him. You saved Steve.”
“I thought you said this shit was safe!” Barnes shouted at him.
Bucky’s chest clenched, already picturing the pair of them walking back out the door, leaving him behind.
blaring in his ears. Steve looked away, ashamed. Thor had warned him - they
The cop was obviously a rookie, his fresh face pale and drawn, eyes as wide as saucers. Steve couldn’t pull his eyes away from the shaking gun. The kid was like a scared rabbit. One wrong move and everything could go south.
“Listen,” Rhodey continued. “You wait right there. I’ll see if I can find you something to eat. Try not to do anything stupid while I'm gone.”
"So?"
“No, you listen, asshole. You can damn well keep your opinions to yourself, because I could care less what you think.”
“Witness protection,” Steve answered, being met with resounding groans around the room.
“What’s this?” he grinned. “I thought the Rubik’s Cube was below your pay grade?”
“I’m not asking you to like it, I’m just asking you to trust me.” And wasn’t that a knife in the gut. Clint was convinced Steve was destined to be a superhero with the very useful powers of constant puppy dog eyes and the ability to make anyone feel guilty for anything. Clint hadn’t been to church in decades, but talks like this with Steve had always ended up with him wanting to go to confession. Seriously, dealing with a priest might be easier than facing a disappointed Steve Rogers. And Steve's strength? Clint would be entirely convinced the man was on steroids if he didn’t know Steve personally. Clint had once seen him rip a log in half.
Tony bent down to pick up the sketch book, idling flipping through the pages. “I was in the neighborhood, thought I’d walk through the park. I remember you mentioned at the hospital once that you like to draw here.”
Natasha took off her other slipper, placing both in the canvas bag she brings with her. She could keep her shoes here – while the community instructors all shared a singular office, they each had their own locker. Unfortunately, one of the community theatre directors was a vile, sloppy man with a pallet to match. Her first Saturday here, Natasha left extra clothes and slippers in her locker for her class on Wednesday. Community theatre has practice on Monday nights, but the slimy Mr. Wells uses the office all day as his personal bachelor pad (as much of a bachelor pad a balding, overweight, middle-aged man could have), as there’s nothing else on the schedule that day or the following. While Natasha heard warnings from other teachers of toenail clippings and leftover trash, what she discovered that Wednesday was a stale chicken kiev that had been left baking in the sun on the shared desk. It seemed that Mr. Wells had forgotten to finish his dinner. At least that was her first thought, until Natasha saw him walking the halls later that day, munching on the same meal. Turns out he was just saving it for later. Natasha shuddered at the smell that had hit her when she first walked into the office that day. Even now, she could still smell the faint remnants of the rancid chicken. Since then, Natasha carted everything she needed too and from her place. She’d already lost one good pair of slippers to that stench; she wasn’t going to risk another.
His dashboard shrieked red as Steve could make out the faint outline of an elderly woman waving him down in the middle of the road. With instincts quicker than lightening, Steve stomped on the brake, the car jolting from the sudden decrease in speed. A car screeched to a halt a mere few feet in front of the citizen, the woman herself seemed unfazed. Conscience getting the better of him, Steve leapt out of the car, immediately heading to the woman.
“But Pops said our powers are nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special!”
He could hear Clint’s faint whining response to Bucky's question, no doubt muddled by the food he was still shoveling into his mouth. Steve chuckled to himself, throwing the plastic cartons and forks into the trash bag he held in his other hand.
“So bringing your fancy foreign friend overseas to rub in my face wasn’t your fault?”
Tony shot him a curious gaze. “Wendy?”
“Why did you think this was a good idea?” snapped Stark.
He saw the camo sweatshirt and cursed under his breath. Looks like that asshole customer had found out where he lived. Fuck whatever Sparky would have to say about this, this guy was trespassing on his property and he could totally spin this as self-defense.
Sam snorted, picturing the man stuck in exile in a sea of swamps and tourists. “Pretty sure he doesn’t.”
“You could have slept,” said Steve.
“Agent,” Tony quipped in response, already looking at his son, who was very blatantly trying to become one with the chair he was sitting in, refusing to meet Tony’s eye.
“They were,” Stane hissed. “Tony hid out for a few days after the news spread about The Captain’s name, and then as soon as he came back, he’s been doing nothing but working out of the office. I never even saw him go home. We must have missed something.”
The team needed him on this one, draining Bruce completely. All he wanted to do was sleep. Maybe some of the pain would go away. He knew it wouldn’t.
Steve didn’t even wait for further reason. He tore out of the briefing room and down the stairs.
His old boss had entered just a few minutes earlier, and ever since then, he and Clint had been having a staring contest.
Bucky groaned, shoulders slumping at the shrill tone. He sucked in a deep breath before turning to face the street. He jerked his hand in some semblance of a wave to the older woman across the street. “Good morning, Mrs. Danowitz,” he grit out. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Steve’s shoulders shake with laughter.
“Please, I only bribe people with class,” Tony said with a wave of his hand. “No, I prefer to use technological warfare.”
Not that it’s any sweat of Tony’s back. He didn’t need The Captain. He didn’t need them. Tony would do it himself.
Not waiting another second, Tony swept a leg under Barnes, causing the other man to crumple to the ground. He hopped over him easily, racing back towards his car when he saw The Captain pull out from the shadows, eyes locking onto Tony’s immediately. Tony ran faster, trying to beat the mob boss to his car. He scrambled for his keys in his pockets, sobbing in relief when he saw that he hadn't dropped them. Throwing the door open, Tony jumped in, narrowing missing the bullets that sprayed over his head and broke his windows.
Of course, all their arguing didn't really seem to matter in the end. All that bickering and all they had to show for it was another dead body. And no answers.
“Well, I can’t exactly help that your boss has kind of a possessive streak.”
Steve tightened his hold on Tony’s hand, squeezing reassuringly. “That’s right, sweetheart. I’m here.”
Tony sped past to the last door, but opened the door softly, trying not to scare Steve.
“You used to be a better liar,” Steve chuckled. “I remember once you decided to make us all ‘something quick’ and we ended up with homemade ratatouille.”
She slapped the sandwich out of his hand. “I just got back from class; I wanted something quick,” she shrugged.
“Still hoping, apparently,” Tony grumbled, shifting into a more comfortable position on the bed.
“Uhh. I- well…”
The assistant pulled away. “Your friend is strong. He will pull through.”
Despite everything, Steve found himself smiling at the man. “I’m still mad at you,” Stark mumbled.
It wasn’t as if he wasn’t interested; Tony had wasted countless time in the shower or in bed, imagining Steve pound into him from behind. But still, traces of fear lingered. Being here, Tony had never felt more exposed, the idea of bottoming feeling like giving up the last bit of power that he was clinging too. It was subconscious, he was sure; Tony trusted Steve with everything, would give him everything.
Barnes rolled his eyes. “How about we skip that and we just get to the part where you shut your mouth?”
Dugan calls him, much to Bruce's chagrin. Steve couldn't help but agree; it seemed that every time he ran into Bruce in their home, the man was in the middle of a different task, grumbling the occasional complain, but doing it all the same. It had been over a year since their first meeting, and while Steve had talked with him multiple times about sending him somewhere else, Bruce always just laughed him off.
“Easy, Steve,” Clint said, pushing away from him. “They have nothing to gain by lying to me!”
“But I’m not wrong.”
Clint could feel wood dig into his hand as it clenched around the now open door. Natasha just stared back at him as unfazed as always.
“Tony!"
“I wouldn’t count on it,” Natasha replied with a sharp smile. Not with Sam on the loose upstairs. “It’s over.”
Steve tensed, letting go of Tony’s mouth with a wet pop as they both turned to see Rhodey leaning back into the room, bowl of soup in his hands.
He walked into the dusty room, already finding Loki leaning against the far wall skinning an apple with a knife. Even in such a causal state, the man looked almost regal, with a perfectly tailored suit, lanky body and slicked back hair.
Steve blushed again but Rhodey just scoffed. “Fine. You don’t have to hear it from us. You’ll just hear it from Pepper, then.”
He was moving so quickly, so caught up in the battle, trying to beat a record set by Thor, that he didn’t hear the Captain’s orders.
“Alexander Pierce is the current head of HYDRA. He wears the red mask but still gets to bask in the sun,” she sneered. “He is reason for everything happening. For how many people we’ve buried, for how much he lost. Think about our family. You really think that you’ll be satisfied knowing that all he got was life to waste away in prison?”
Pepper continued to shake her head. “Tony, I-I really don’t think that- ”
“How- ” Steve started.
Steve reminded himself. It had been months since he’d been sick, and Tony could more than handle himself in a fight. But that nagging in the back of his head just wouldn’t leave, no matter how many times he shooed it away.
Sam stared blankly at the other man, lamp still raised behind his head. Another second went by and Tony Stark peeked out from behind Steve. “What, you gonna brain us with the lamp?” he asked with a smirk, giving the light fixture a once over. “Actually,” he continued, “that thing is positively atrocious, maybe you should give it a good whacking.”
Tony shook his head. “Mine don’t have enough power in them to take out the foundations, but Obie’s do. If we wait, he’ll bring the whole building down on top of us.”
An old nickname, one he hadn’t heard in a long time. Many in the criminal community called the ever elusive SSR files held more secrets than the lost Library of Alexandria.
Tony snorted. “Steve, the kid is nine months old. He’s not gonna remember if we go on a picnic or not.”
The large blonde crossed the room, not even hesitating to engulf her into a strong hug. “Where the hell have you been? Jesus, I’ve been going out of my mind trying to find you.”
Steve felt himself reach for his shield, but there was no point.
“You are special, Pietro. But everyone else is special in their own way.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I suppose I should check in on everyone.”
“We’ll have to worry about that later,” Tony sighed, redialing Pepper’s phone number. “Stane needs to be stopped, now. Head to SI’s office. No way Stane wouldn’t stop by and immediately try his new toys with my reactor.”
“Undoubtably.”
“And how do you suggest that!” Sam cried.
Every second, every breath – all he could think about was Steve. He knew he loved Steve.
It wasn’t long before Steve found himself getting strapped into the chopper, Sam starting the short flight to New York. It was quiet in the cabin, Steve staring blankly out the window while his head churned like an impending storm.
Of course, being able to stay three steps ahead of any other rival gang, as well as the entire NYPD, didn't exactly come from luck. Of course, with some of the stupid ass decisions their man-in-charge was delegating, maybe there was more luck involved than he thought.
Clint sighed, leaning against the outer wall of the shawarma shop. “I’m just trying to help, Phil.”
“You’ve been alive this whole time and what – didn’t think to stop in and say hi?” Tony fumed. “Do you realize what you’ve done to us, to
“You drove us hours out of the way to see a mailbox.”
Dear God, did the man look horrible. His face was tight and drawn, a white pallor fixed behind red rimmed eyes. His clothes were rumpled, covered in blood and God know what else.
he thought to himself - and held his own with The Commandos just fine, thank you very much. He even managed to save The Captain's distracted ass.
“I can’t,” whined Clint. “I have to pee and we’ve been sitting here for like,
“Steve?”
“Not how you ended up in my backyard, dumbass, how the hell did you end up on this side of the country? Last time I checked this was a big no-no.”
“You really should let us tend to you.”
he thought to himself.
Steve sighed. “Okay. We may have a problem.”
Tony just nodded dumbly.
Yinsen shot him a dirty look, but dutifully walked over to the computers. “I’ve got the algorithm all set up,” Tony continued. “Start the virus and it should get into every bit of tech they own: computers, cameras, electronic locks, you name it.”
He saw Steve pale.
Steve snorted. “Next time?”
Steve sighed, shuffling under the covers as he stretched his arm out to Tony’s side of the bed. It was cold, undisturbed – the way it had remained all night.
It was him.
Sam couldn’t help but follow. What did he say to the man? What could he say?
Bucky leaned forward in his chair. “An email? When did he send it?”
“It’s Loki,” Bucky grit out. “Of course he’s scheming. Loki doesn’t hold allegiances with anyone. He’ll work for whoever can sign the biggest check or who can give him the most power.”
“No,” Steve interrupted. “Natasha brought these men here. Someone could have seen. We’re not safe anymore. After I finish with Loki today I want us gone.”
This time it was Tony who held a finger up to stop Steve. “What do we get it we tell you?”
The smaller man patted Steve’s shoulder before continuing on his way to find blankets. “Someone’s gotta keep you guys in line.”
Maybe by sheer luck, Tony would already be in bed by the time he’d get home and serum would take care of the rest, erasing any evidence before morning came.
He could see him laughing, schmoozing with the reporters like he usually did, but Tony couldn’t wait. He grabbed at Stane’s shoulder and yanked him around, showing him the photos out of any camera’s eyeline.
Of course, it hadn’t helped when The Captain started flirting. Tony had taken it upon himself to try and get the man to blush at every instance he could. It was pretty easy; for a mob boss, The Captain seemed to turn beet red at almost anything Tony said. Who knew that one lewd response from the blonde would send Tony about two seconds from bending over the man’s desk. If The Captain’s voice had dropped any lower, Tony was sure that he would have creamed his jeans right then and there.
Tony huffed out a laugh, dragging Steve's mouth to his. Oh, how Tony could write odes to that man's lips. How despite that they belonged to a hardened shell of a man, the lips always remained soft and smooth, always inviting. Tony sighed, trying to push deeper when Steve pulled away, Tony giving a small noise of disapproval.
“What do you think?” The man grinned, obviously proud; a smile that suited nothing but a dragon, showing off his horde.
“He says that if you can’t be bothered to pick up your phone, he doesn’t have to listen to you.”
Steve leaned forward to snatch the drawing out of his hand, but it was futile as Tony’s quick hands kept it out of Steve’s reach. He watched as Tony’s teasing glance turn soft as he looked down at the sketch. “Well, I’m not sure how you did it, but somehow you’ve managed to make me look even better.”
And they would. He'd only caught a glimpse of it while he watched the fire burn, but the broken screams of his Captain would haunt him for the rest of his life. There was no telling what Steve would have done when the tears dried. There's no telling what he would have done if Phil never called him. There's no telling how long before the rest of the city was burning with them. But those were thoughts for a different night. Right now, he needed to find the rest of his family.
“Alright, then. Let’s get started.” Barton bounded over to him. Loki prepared himself for another punch, but nothing came. He looked up to meet Barton’s eyes, only to find the man staring angrily down at him.
“So, just some movies?” Bruce asked slowly.
Steve found himself in another club, shooting himself up with more serum. A lot of his money had gone to stacking up on his stash, making sure he would have enough for the next thirty years.
“I haven’t heard from Hammer since the explosion. Dumbass probably got himself killed.” Stane shot Pierce another glare. “Oh, come on,” Pierce continued. “If anything I did you a favor. Hammer wanted you out of the way just as much as Stark. Besides, I’d already gotten all the information I needed from him anyway.”
A hand pushed him back down onto the mound of pillows. His chest heaved in short pants as he tried to breathe around the pain. His chest ablaze, as if hot coals were dancing around on his insides.
“What the hell is wrong with you?”
Bucky held his hands up, trying to calm his friend down. “Steve, HYDRA, already knew your name. What’s one more mob?”
Steve grabbed at the bottoms of his thighs and suddenly Tony was air born, the brunette wrapping his legs around Steve on instinct. Steve walked slowly and blindly, his mouth never leaving Tony’s, moving them back over to the bed.
“And what’s your personal agenda? Tanking this whole operation?” Stane snapped.
“I need you to call Bucky,” Steve replied, not bothering to respond. “Get him and Tony home, and then go and sober Clint up. We’ve got a problem.”
Tony snorted. “Your virtue is safe, darling. I’m a taken man.”
“Okay, so all the way the down there will lead you back up some steps and to the bedrooms. Apparently the owners of the speakeasy bought the next building over just for rooms so their customers can spent the night with some of their lady friends,” Tony joked, pointing further down the hallway. “But don’t worry, they’ve all been refurnished and modernized; there’s more than enough rooms for everybody. There’s also a door that leads down another level, most likely used for beer storage. Right now, I’ve got a lab down there for weapons testing. I’m also currently finishing up a gym down there because apparently you all have a hankering for hitting things for fun.”
Clint heaved a sigh. “Fine. But that’s it. I don’t want him caught up in this.”
Steve sighed. “Now really isn’t the time for this, Buck.”
Steve rushed over to Tony’s side, immediately pressing down on Tony’s wound. “I told you to leave,” he said, brushing Tony’s sweaty locks out of his face.
Stark let out a small sigh. “It’s not like I’ve put you through the same hell. You just didn’t realize it. I used your crew to get to HYDRA; I didn’t really care who made it out or not. I just wanted them gone; you guys were dispensable to me. But…things got complicated. You lost your arm, half your mob just up and left, Steve’s crazy. Part of that’s on me. Gotta clear the conscience somehow.”
He could have cried along with her, but there was no point. He had to pick up where his dad left off. His father had gone off to war for the wellbeing of this family and had died for that as well. Now, it fell to Sam to further the tradition.
But if Tony only knew one thing in this world, was that he’d never see Steve again if he said yes to this man.
She yanked the door open and lo and behold, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark were stood in her hallway, backs facing her.
“Alright then,” Steve said, giving Tony a nervous smile. “If you insist. Where are we going that’s got you all nervous? You look like you’re going to drop Bucky and I off at the docks for someone to take care of us,” he tried to joke. Tony was throwing up miles of red tape that basically screamed ‘
Tony didn’t miss the faint flush that appeared on the blonde’s cheeks. A worthy sight, indeed.
Steve relaxed, his defenses dropping. Tony raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "You gonna tell me what all of this is about?"
Tony finally used one of his hands to grab at Clint’s face, forcing him to make eye contact. “Clint, what the hell?”
Side note, (and of course I thought of this when I have like a billion other things I need to finish first, but that's my brain for you) I am thinking about making a Stony Mad Max AU. Thoughts?
The sound echoed again. A small whisper of a breeze.
Wanda huffed. “Fine. What can my brother and I do for you?”
“Where are you going?”
“No, it doesn’t,” Bucky agreed. “Make sure Steve doesn’t leave,” he continued, pushing the door open and walking outside.
He heard the shot go off and felt a force crash into him.
Bucky, of course, moved to help Steve, giving Clint the time to escape down the street.
Rogers sighed when nothing happened. Iron Man wasn’t Bruce Banner.
Clint heard Tony enter the briefing room, but his eyes never left Fury.
Thankfully, the hulking blonde appeared, looking just as pale as they did against the fire. “Take him,” Clint snapped, Thor quickly hastening to respond. “I need you to get him out of here,” Clint continued, watching as Steve flailed uselessly in Thor’s arms.
Tony rolled his eyes. “What am I going to do with you?”
“Good,” Tony retorted. “Keep me updated.”
Steve wasted no time before pushing a finger into Tony’s hole. Tony arched into him like a cat, gasping for air. Steve started to push in farther, distracting Tony with lingering kisses. Feeling Tony loosen beneath him, Steve added another finger, swallowing Tony’s whimpers.
“No! Get the hell off me!
“Wait,” the officer cut him off. “They got away?”
“Okay, new plan,” Tony answered, mind already moving a mile a minute. “See over there?” he asked with a point. Barton nodded. “It’s my other repulsor. I’ll distract him, and I need you to go over there are get it. It’s already armed, so you just need to put it on.”
“Pretty much,” Steve agreed.
-------------------------
“What did Fury want?”
“Yep,” Tony said slowly, popping the ‘p’.
Tony narrowed his eyes, glaring into Obie’s knowing ones.
“I lost my life because of this man. If I kill him, I get it back. So yes, I’ll stop him.”
he whispered in a rough voice. Before Tony could respond, the mob boss was crossing the room in large steps, engulfing Tony in a hug.
Barnes stuttered to a halt, his eyes comically wide as he stared back at the marksman.
“Glad we’ve established what we already know.”
Tony shook his head, rubbing at his eyes with his hand. It was that kind of thinking that got him in that situation in the first place. How the hell did he end up like this? Tony used to pay people to go out and get shot for him. Now here he is, sitting on some ratty couch in the boondocks of Brooklyn, nursing his own bullet wound.
“But are you in good conscience? Do you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth?” Obie retorted, finally turning to look at Tony. “Listen, I can’t imagine what you’ve been through these last few months. You need to take some time for yourself. What happened today – you’re pushing yourself, and you’re clearly not ready to jump back in. You’re making rash decisions that- ”
Steve scoffed. “You didn’t know him. No one did.”
Silence descended between the two. She could tell he wasn’t happy, but were any of them? This was a call that she’d made last night; it was something that needed to be done, regardless of whether or not everyone else was on board with it. Funny, how Steve and Tony had sat in this very room to barter for all of their lives, and her she was, not twenty-four hours later, potentially undoing the whole thing.
It had been three days since Tony had last met with The Captain in his overcrowded Brooklyn hideout. They had both agreed that the best way to find their mystery HYDRA man out of hiding was by drawing him out; orchestrating another ‘meeting’ between the two of them seemed like their best option. Of course, this time, The Captain brought his lackeys; The Commandos hiding within the shadows of the alleyways, waiting for action.
During those times, Clint had seen ‘the Captain’ disappear behind Steve Rogers, leaving nothing but a lost kid from Brooklyn, nothing but a broken shell of a man.
“Nope,” Tony said, lips popping.
“Key word: bodies. How many of those people actually talked before you blew their brains out? Your way is too primitive; the whole ‘let’s just beat the shit out of them until they talk’ thing is old fashioned, and it doesn’t always work. I mean, look at this guy,” Tony said, gesturing to their unconscious guest. “You really think he’ll start spilling the beans if you slap him around a couple times? You’ll just waste time and ruin some clothes. Let me take care of this.”
Steve narrowed his eyes. There was something seriously wrong with Clint.
Another century passed by the time Tony bottomed out, but he found he didn’t mind. The dull aches had receded, leaving only the satisfied feeling of being full of Steve. If fact, meeting Steve’s groin was almost a disappointment, Tony immediately shifting upwards to start the process over again. He wished he had Steve’s patience, but it was like there was an itch he couldn’t stretch, and it wasn’t long before Tony had a steady rhythm, bouncing on Steve’s cock.
Pierce snorted. “Stane convinced me to wait. Probably just an excuse to hold us off until he could take care of them on his own. Well, screw him; I run this show. I’ll take a few of my boys down there, wait till it’s night and torch the joint. You in?”
“I can’t keep this secret for you,” Tony replied. “I don’t want to! Why even bother showing up and blabbing your mouth to me just to turn around and say that I can’t tell anyone!”
Tony hummed. “You’re right. Maybe the bed posts then. I can probably find a way to be kept entertained there.”
“Closet,” he said, nodding a head in the direction. Tony walked away and Clint looked back at Steve, who was still on the floor with Lucky. “While you’re in a good mood,” Clint said slowly. “There’s something I should tell you.”
“Yes,” he finally answered, staring back at Hill. “Yes, you can.”
But this?
Minutes later, days later, years later, Tony found his way back into consciousness. Steve was behind him, peppering kisses along his back and shoulder. Tony found himself leaning into it, loving the feeling of warmth and security.
The pair piled in the elevator, listening to the hum of the machinery as they climbed to Ms. Pott’s office. “I looked at her calendar,” Bucky started. “It had Stark listed as unavailable starting the day you two went missing until next week. Did he say anything to you about taking off?”
“There isn’t anyone who knows more about this than me, so therefore, there’s no one better than me to do this. And it needs to be done. Getting this out of the way without Steve here is the only way, and you know it. That man wouldn’t let me get anywhere close to this lab if he knew what I was planning to do. ‘Too much risk’ he would say. But there isn’t any more risk in this than there is in any normal surgery. And Barnes, I need this. You know I do. This one can’t hold up much longer, and with everything else that’s going on, I don’t want to take that chance.”
Tony ignored the long sigh on the phone.
But while the abandoned groceries weren’t his problem, the reason for the lack of purchase of said groceries certainly was.
Curling his hands around the steaming mug, Tony strolled through the rest of the kitchen and opened the door onto the back patio. The first step into the open air always came with a blast of frigid air – his second alarm clock, he liked to call it. There was no snow on the ground – the chance of that was few and far between – but even the South was not immune to the cold grip of Winter’s fist. And in the mornings, before the sun could start to peek out behind the wooded surroundings, the breeze was a merciless as it was in New York.
Natasha cursed. She had been so close. “What do you think you’re doing?”
He really should leave. The Captain didn’t know where they were. Tony could just slip out of their lives forever, building up the walls be had so carelessly let down to work with The Commandos. He could move on.
“Steve, don’t you dare.”
“Well, I’m game,” Natasha answered, smiling at Steve’s affronted look.
Tony shrugged. “J couldn’t hold the whole thing by himself; just thought I’d lend a hand. Relax, mother hen, I’m
Steve shook his head. “Does he?”
“No, you’re not giving up yet.” Sam sat down in front of him, forcing Steve to meet his eyes. “You’re not thinking clearly, Steve. You know this isn’t right.”
Steve hummed. “So you’re leaving.”
Emerald eyes narrowed. “Is that so?” she asked. They both knew he was lying. “You should have said something. We would have been quiet when we got here this morning if you wanted to sleep in.”
But it didn't. Steve doesn't date.
Tony leaned away, rolling his eyes. “I could be convinced to take another one,” he responded, the hand not holding his mug trailing down Steve’s bare chest. “Or, if you’re up for it,” Tony added, “you could help me break in the hot tub.”
Steve shook his head. “Not them. They didn’t deserve that luxury,” he answered coldly, staring at the limp bodies before looking at Clint. “Pack up. We need to move again.”
Steve hummed, but otherwise ignored his friend. He knew he was right, he
“It’s over, Tony!” Stane yelled, struggling to get to his feet. “There’s no way out for you!”
Steve balled his fists, no doubt trying to rein in his anger. “Check the rest of the base. He could have made off with some of our stuff.”
“Part of the reason it was so easy for us to bomb Stark Industries was because I used to work there.”
a Tomas Veres,” Bucky snarked back.
Tony thought, venomously.
Steve nodded numbly, looking down at his hands. Of course he would be.
Is that you?”
A new feeling flittered across his chest.
Tony thought viciously. Now Tony was back to where he started, alone.
he had said.
“No,” Steve argued. “The SSR never stored any of that information on computers. Computers can be hacked, paper can’t. If anyone ever caught wind of the paper trail, we could always just burn it down.”
It hurt, of course. Having Tony Stark on board for good would be a huge game changer for Steve and the crew. But Tony had never gone monogamous with a single mob before; Steve knew it was a lot to ask.
As he felt knuckles crash into his cheekbone, pain radiating from the blow, he couldn’t help but laugh. Of course, of fucking course. Where there’s one, there’s the other. He blinked up, similarly to how Tony did with him, at a furious Steve Rogers, looking like he was ready to rain down hell. At Tony’s cry of
“I didn’t say that, did I?”
he thought to himself. He heaved out a heavy sigh and crept over to him desk, sitting in his own chair silently.
“Well, don’t worry about that, ma’am,” Steve answered, grinning mischievously. “We can’t stay, so Seb here is free for bridge tonight. It’s very nice of you to invite him over; he really does need to get out more.”
The birds had stopped chirping; their daily routine of keeping Tony from wasting away in bed now completed. It would be clear skies today –
“The Captain.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, pushing her down, watching as she hit her head against the wall.
Tony shrugged. “That may be true; I’m a loose cannon, but I’m one of the most dangerous people you’ll ever meet, so you should watch your tone.”
“Yes, we did,” Natasha sighed, rolling her eyes. “You just don’t want to admit you’re wrong.”
Bucky nodded, clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder for comfort before heading down one sewer way, the pair disappearing into the dark, the slapping sound as their feet hitting the water slipping further away.
Respecting Tony’s unspoken wishes, Steve claimed his mouth in a teasing kiss again, bringing Tony out of his bad memories. Steve broke the kiss with a quiet moan, as Tony cupped his erection through his pants.
Tony thought. “Then what are you suggesting?”
Tony shook his head. “Not while they’re still out there.”
It wasn’t like he didn’t have anything to do. With Obi-
“You," Tony gaped. "You went to see Pepper. Steve, she knows who you are!” After flubbing out the last sentence, Tony cursed, slapping a hand over his mouth. “I mean,
It was mainly Phil’s doing. He caught on to it pretty quick; then again, he always did. He was always so sharp, so bright. It didn’t take him long to see through Clint at all. That every time he tried to push away, it was a silent plea to never leave. He was never overbearing. Just simple things – a cooked dinner here, a foot rub there. Just small reminders that he cared; that Clint always had a home with him.
Natasha ignored him, stepping around him gracefully. Her eyes tracked the small building, the redhead offering a small hum. “Nice place.”
“Afternoon,” Tony returned suspiciously.
Do you know who these people are, Cap? These people are the lowliest scum of the Earth. Honestly, I’d be less insulted if you worked with Hammer.”
The computers were gone and cabinets were overturned, clearly emptied.
Tony smiled softly at the still pristine memories. At least he could use this as an
The other man nodded, already dashing back to his computer. “As long as it’s still on, we should be in business.”
-------------------------
“Tony had no pulse,” Steve hissed.
Tony’s thoughts zoomed through him, his brain working overdrive as shock set in. Screw the arm; Tony needed to get the out of there
Sam shot him an unimpressed look. “Well, we may have to wait on Hammer, considering you basically beat him within an inch of his life.”
“Well isn’t that just
Steve’s heart stopped. Tony never talked about Stane and Steve never asked. Steve had a general understanding of what happened in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t until late into their friendship that Tony had come in and thrust the file into Steve’s hands.
“I don’t know. I seem to recall a few occasions where you’ve seemed to like my troublesome mouth,” Steve replied, lips trailing over Tony’s neck.
“Drop it, Sam.”
Steve stared into the cavernous room, the flickering lights flashing evidence of disaster right back in his face.
And Tony?
(See the end of the chapter for
speech?”
Clint picked up his phone and dialed Hill. “Send a med team down to the interrogation room. Our guest slipped and fell.”
Steve woke up alone. Reaching out to the other side of the bed, he felt Tony’s side was cold, meaning Tony had been up and about for a while.
"You could be calling five families," a voice filtered in from down the table.
Barton moved his arm to aim at Wilson, but stopped when a shrill alarm sounded.
Pietro pushed Wanda off of him, getting up and speeding around the table, only stopping long enough to slap her in the back of the head. In the background, Peter was giggling manically, but Tony could barely hear him over his own shouts.
Tony stood next to The Captain in the depths of his base, staring at the man Barnes and Barton brought in. The man was still unconscious, so The Captain wasted no time in making sure he was properly restrained in the chair.
Fury looked at him from where he sat, his eye as blank as the rest of his face.
Tony’s head snapped up, finally giving Steve a good look at him. His eyes were sunken, skin clammy; Tony looked utterly exhausted. He was still shaking from his burst of power, tears flowing freely to mix in with the cuts that Tony had gotten during the explosion.
-------------------------
“Where’s Phil?” Clint pleaded.
Steve liked to think of these movements, these reactions, as a personification of Tony’s brain. His thoughts, his ideas. His ingenuity was always flowing, his genius always turning gears.
Tony didn’t hear the man respond, but saw blue eyes crack open again. He could do this. Tony could keep them safe. He scanned the road, praying that help would be there soon. He wasn’t sure how much longer Barnes had before he went delirious again or just plain bled out. Feeling his heartbeat slow down, Tony’s brain caught up with him, finally begging the million dollar question.
There were small signs that it would be, with Steve yelling at Bucky with a familiar crazed look in his eyes, pleading with him to find Tony. But soon after he collapsed unconscious, whether being from distress or the concussion he suffered in the blast. When Steve finally woke back up, it had taken him one look around the room for him to realize that Tony was still missing. And from then on, just silence. Deafening silence.
Steve crossed his arms. “I’m not following.”
frustrating Steve to no end. Day suits, that were meant for meandering down the Seine or whatever bullshit the tailor had tried to spin when selling them. Tony, of course, did nothing of the sorts, but still wore them occasionally when Steve wanted to go to the farmers market, always making the blonde blush. He had suits specifically for his board of directors. Dark colors and sharp lines that looked more like a suit of armor, making Tony seem enough of a predator that made Steve want to do nothing but fall to his knees every time. And Steve couldn’t forget the ones for black tie events. The ones that made Tony look positively ethereal under the gala lights, and the ones that slipped off so smoothly when Steve undressed the man like a Christmas present when they got home. No matter what kind he had on, the way Tony could wear them always made Steve think that he was modeling an art piece, rather than getting dressed for the day.
Rumlow startled awake, his hands already clutching his side in pain. He had been lucky, how he had survived Rogers onslaught was a miracle.
“Didn’t know what?” Bucky replied.
It took Tony an alarmingly long amount of time to figure out The Captain was talking to him. “Ahh-what?” he asked eloquently. Since when was he a part of this meeting?
“Oh, and I suppose you have the best guns?”
Steve sighed, looking back up at Tony. "Have faith. The team will come for us."
What stood before Steve was a monstrosity of a building. If a building is the correct term for it. It was more like a palace; a towering fortress that was all shine and flash. It fit in perfectly with this century, but brought so much more to make it stick out in the New York skyline.
There was silence for a long time, Tony’s heart rate jumping with each moment passing.
Steve had been against it for the longest time; he’d seen it kill enough people. When he became a Looper, however, things changed. The serum gave the user heightened abilities. Faster reflexes, impressive strength. Perfect for work. It wasn’t too long before Steve found himself depending on the small vials to get him through day to day.
“You sure about this?”
“Not to me,” the other man snapped in response. “Not about our little business deal.”
It was almost ironic, feeling this type of fear. It was the same type of fear that the SSR had used all those years, just to make sure people stayed in line. Now it’s come back to bite him in the ass.
The man was cut off by Tony swinging the suitcase around, clipping the man on the side of the head. He crumpled to the ground, Tony easily snatching the phone from him. Through his blurry vision, Tony managed to type in a number he was loathe to call again.
Romanoff pulled away, waiting for the man to respond. Tony shifted uneasily against the wall. Maybe it would be better if he waited outside. It seemed that Romanoff’s interrogation style was not that much different than The Captain’s. However, Tony thought that she could probably get much more creative. Tony never really had the stomach for all that. Sure he could handle a lot, but even he had his limits. Another hit and muffled grunt got Tony’s attention.
“Nothing my ass,” Obie grit out in return. “Come on, we need to talk.”
“Gets it from his mom,” Bucky answered. “No dirty room was every worth the wrath of Sarah Rogers.”
Tony spun in a circle, looking for anything that –
Stark snorted. “It could. Or.”
Steve shot him a lazy smile. “Where else would I be?”
a cabin – Steve had wondered how they would make the switch into a more stagnant schedule. He waited for the growing tension. Sure, he and Tony had already been living together, but each day was another job, another fight, and was more than enough to keep them busy. And it wasn’t as if he and Tony had a lot in common, or shared life experience for that matter.
“Cap!” Sam’s voice sounded, jogging up next to him. “All the floors below us are clear. Listen, I think we should- ”
“Relax, big guy,” Tony quipped. “JARVIS is an AI. I had him outfitted into the mainframe a while back; he runs the place.”
A kiss brushed across his hairline. “
And that shirt? Tony almost wanted to throw out Steve’s entire wardrobe so he would be forced to wear that tight shirt around everywhere.
Tony hummed beside him. “Na,” he replied softly. “I’d be more worried if you did. That asshole deserves every hell imaginable, not free meals for the rest of his life.”
He ushered a child into a house, when the mother snatched the kid out of his hands.
“Tony!”
Bucky rubbed at his eyes. It didn’t matter. None of that mattered as long as he reminded himself that there would always be one person who knew he made the right call.
“Ugh, no,” Tony moaned, grabbing at his stomach. “I’ve been eating nothing but gas station food for days now, and I think my stomach has shut down.”
Clint thought. The Avengers were used to dealing with aliens and gods seeking world domination. Now they had an insane cult of regular humans trying to drag them through hell and to their annihilation.
Steve stepped between the two of them. “Alright, let’s calm down.” He turned towards Tony. “You know he’s more valuable to us alive,” he said calmly, trying to soothe Tony’s bristling anger. “He’s not exactly my favorite person in the world either, but we can still use him. Besides, someone once told me that blowing people’s brains out isn’t always the answer. I reckon he was right.”
is that what you wanted to hear?!” Tony shouted, suddenly explosive. A few people on the street paused at the outburst. “I don’t have to be there if you don’t- ”
But he was.
” Steve groaned with a small laugh. “Everyone is fine, everything went fine. Relax.”
“This is bad.”
at Tony.
Tony just sneered back. “Likewise, sweetheart.”
“Real keeper, he is.”
“No, sorry to disappoint.”
Natasha froze.
Natasha snorted. “No he doesn’t. The woman he got off the phone with is Pepper Potts. Stark named her the CEO last month.”
Steve hissed, before turning to look at Sam. “Can I use your bathroom?”
A loud groaning sounded above him, and Tony only had a few seconds before more ceiling crashed down to where he had just been standing. He gasped in pain as fresh embers splattered against exposed skin, his head still pounding, lungs constricting for a fresh breath.
Clint rolled his eyes, grabbing everyone’s discarded mugs to bring them to the sink. Steve came in behind him, placing the leftover coffee cake on the counter. He paused, giving Clint a soft look. “It really is good to see you,” he said. “And, I know what I said, but- ” he sighed. “I’m glad Phil’s here. You deserve to be happy, Clint.”
“We all do,” Steve responded. He followed Tony out, but pulled the man back before he could walk up the stairs. Tony looked at him with wide eyes as Steve stroked a thumb over his hand. “Thank you,” he said softly. “This means the word to him that you did this.”
Steve nodded. “He’s rounding up a few friends for us to meet.”
Steve huffed as he got out from under him. “Well, hopefully with proper counseling, you’ll come to forgive me.”
“Tony!” he screamed, pounding against the glass.
Tony put his arms up apologetically. “Alright, that was shitty. But, I know you’re with me on this one, Barnes. I can help;
“Let me guess. You’re pregnant.”
Natasha scoffed. “Of course I know that James is still alive.”
Strange had brought
"I like her," Steve blurted out.
Or Tony could just rid of everything, so Steve would have to walk around without a shirt on at all.
“Are these your friends?” she continued, blatantly ignoring his tone, taking another step across the street. She was wearing yet another atrocious outfit, a horrifying tracksuit with an equally vile print to go with it. He knew that she was probably getting ready to stomp down the street to pick up the rest of her gang, the gaggle of ladies swooping through the neighborhood like a pack of Botox-ridden wolves.
“Fine.”
“We won’t be gone long,” Steve placated. “Just a few hours to check on the files and put my mind at ease. I’ll be back soon. Okay?”
“Relax, Cap. Besides, you don’t want to see anything on there. Natasha dumped all of SHIELD and HYDRA’s files on the internet. The media’s tearing you guys apart.”
“It’s alright, it’s been a big day for you,” Steve responded, kissing his forehead gently. For the first time, it did nothing to help slow his racing thoughts. “Come on, let’s get out of here before anyone realizes you’re still in the building.”
,” Tony grumbled. He made a mental note to talk to Happy later about adding more trackers. One's that couldn't be found by blue-eyed mob men.
“Loki,” Steve responded, reaching behind him slightly just to make sure that he’d brought his gun.
He had missed this. He had missed him.
“According to the company’s website, the UroClub is a discrete, sanitary way for your urgent relief. Created by a Board Certified Urologist, it looks like an ordinary golf club, but contains a reservoir built into the grip to relieve yourself. The UroClub is leak proof, easy to clean and stops any more embarrassing moments.” A pause. “Shockingly, this product is only seen on early morning informercials. Rarely, at that.”
There were a few muffled movements from outside before two booted feet steeped into the foyer. And that’s when Tony saw him. Broad shoulders tightly wrapped in a thick sweater, the fabric only loose around a tapered waist. Ruffled blonde hair stuck out of an honestly atrocious, and most likely handmade, wool cap. There was a backpack slung over his shoulder, but it barely made a sound when he dropped it on the floor, so there wasn’t anything likely in there. Clear blue eyes tracked around the room until they locked with his. A bright grin spread across pale skin and flushed cheeks, rosy from the wind.
He heard Pepper sighed softly next to him. "But he came back. Just like he always does."
Searching the inside was fruitless; Clint had not been back there after leaving the first time. He was still out there, somewhere.
Steve scoffed. “Absolutely not. You’re going to see the doctor.”
Steve pulled Bucky aside. “Buck, this is our only chance to get answers. Believe me when I say that I want nothing more than to squeeze the life out of him, but I won’t. We can’t let ourselves get carried away until we get everything we can out of him.”
“I don’t need to sleep,” pouted Stark.
To: Sam Wilson
He reached the main entrance of the building, only to see it blocked by rubble. But the trail of blood led out the back exit.
A light flickered somewhere above him but Tony paid it no mind. He sat there, like he had for the past few hours, picking idly at the blood caked on his hands.
“Don’t do it for me. Do it for The Captain,” snapped Tony. “He’s about ten minutes from getting his head blown off, so cut the shit and give me a location.”
He heard Tony snort softly. “Classic,” the man whispered, no doubt only intending for the comment to be heard by himself.
Of course he wouldn’t just vanish. It was Coulson-
“Tony,” Steve murmured, pulling the man off to the side. “You don’t have to do this. We’re working together now; I’m not going to lose that chance again. I trust you, which means I trust your people. Yinsen can know my name.”
But did The Cap-Steve know that?
Bucky cast a quick look over his shoulder, making sure none of the agents were watching as he stepped over. “What’s the plan?” he asked, voice low.
But he’d gotten nothing. The only thing he did get, which gave him a semblance of grim satisfaction, was his first handler putting in his two weeks.
“Steve, please, it’s okay!”
It was Rumlow, Fury’s personal blood hound.
“I don’t think that’s really accurate- ”
“Tony?! Are you ok? What’s wrong?” Steve’s eyes were wide open with fear as they darted over Tony’s form, his chest heaving.
The Captain narrowed his eyes. "You can't seriously still be denying it."
Enjoy your gift; you guys definitely deserved a nice mellow chapter after all the craziness I've already dragged you through.
Clint sighed and looked back up to Thor. “I can never forgive your brother for what he did to me, the team, the world. But the least I can do is thank him for being part of the reason you’re still here today.”
“Steve?”
“I did. For you. For the crew.”
he thought to himself as he started the walk of shame back to his apartment. The need for a second job seemed to increase with each passing day, especially with the increase in rent and Bucky’s therapy bills.
Happy had been attacked and Tony knew who did it. He wasn't going to sit around and wait for
Tony screeched to a halt, grabbing Clint by the front of his vest, slamming him into the nearest wall. “You didn’t.”
"I'm not following."
“Sure you didn’t,” Barnes sang back at him as he waltzed back where he came from, no doubt to pick up where he left off.
Tony wasn’t even sure how they’d made it to the bed. He’d planned on only coming up for a quick change of clothes, but Steve had followed him up and well – here they were.
“Will that be all, Miss Potts?”
Clint was from Iowa; he knew his way around a corn field. Last Clint had heard, some yahoo had reached out to symbologists to see if they could decipher what had been drawn. Clint had been going for a slice of pizza, but hey, he never said he was an artist.
" he replied quickly, looking down at Steve's uniform.
Even after he was defrosted, it wasn’t until Tony came into his life that Steve finally felt alive. Like it was Tony who had finally saved him from the ice. And Steve knew, of course, how little the man thought of himself. And Steve had told him, had
“Really?” Sam asked unimpressed. “You’re gonna to walk all the way to New York?’
No one saw metal the way he did; not as an inanimate object, but as a living organism. The metal would whisper to him, would teach him how to use them.
“What?” Pierce didn’t even bother turning around to face who was addressing him. His worker’s nervousness screamed bad news.
Do you have a fucking death wish?”
He was gone.
You did come and get me. You guys brought me home.”
“Go check.”
“Yea. Why?”
“You brought me six members of the Ten Rings?" Steve gaped at the other man. "How the hell did you even manage that?”
“I could say the same for you,” Steve said with a small smile.
Steve smiled sadly. “Somethin’ like that, yeah.”
JARVIS had confirmed that Tony had locked himself in his lab, overwhelmed by grief. He
Hearing Steve’s voice made the brunette crumple, both him and Clint falling to the floor. Another voice shouted to get Bruce, no doubt seeing the blood leak out from Clint’s head.
Steve rolled his eyes, intertwining a hand with Tony’s gently tugging the man to walk forward.
“What the hell is wrong with you?”
Steve finally looked up at the other man. “Is this your way of asking for more vacation days?”
“You gonna let him go?” Bucky asked.
“So we run instead?”
Steve surveyed the people that were left: Tony, Clint, Bruce, Thor, Natasha, and Sam. Maybe Bucky.
Steve leaned down, catching Tony’s lips again. “Worth it,” he said, before swallowing Tony’s laugh.
Steve would protect him. He would keep him safe. And if Steve was here, then the rest were as well.
Loki had already confirmed that he was a dead man, so why keep him alive? In fact, it seemed that The Ten Rings were doing everything in their power to keep him alive, if the medical supplies given to Yinsen and the lack of continued violence were to mean anything.
No, it wasn’t a good reason.
Bucky brushed Sam off. “I’ll deal with him later, Sam.”
“Easy, Katniss. I only was in critical condition last month. But you’re right. Wait a second, what the hell am I doing?”
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
Tony gave a small laugh. “This seat taken?” he asked, pointing to the bench.
“How could you do this to us?” Steve gasped. “You murdered your own family!”
"No," Tony laughed in honestly. "But I don't really have time to sit back and think about it. It’s time to buck up, soldier, shut your goddamned mouth, and let your engineer help you.”
“Another fifty-seven minutes sir.”
Tony and Steve had made the decision to take the brunt of the fall in order to deal with Fury. With both of them together, they should have enough to entice the him to come to some sort of plea for the rest of the family. But after heading to bed last night, Steve had tossed and turned at the thought of Tony in an orange jumpsuit. It was a recurring nightmare, popping up ever since Tony had become more involved with The Commandos. Tony had spent years riding coattails and hiding in the shadows, dabbling in the criminal world just to satisfy his appetite. But he wasn’t an accessory anymore, By Tony jumping on their bandwagon full heartedly, he’d become more desperate, sloppy even. Now, he’s backed into a wall like the rest of them, facing down the barrel of a full life sentence.
He hadn’t left his lab again; he knew that it was going to be a bad night. He didn’t want to be a danger to Steve or the team.
“And Patriot!”
“Look,” Steve sighed. “We can play this game all day, just sitting around trying to one-up each other with what we know. But this is a waste of all of our efforts. You know that we wouldn’t be here if we didn’t need something from you,” he continued, looking at Fury. “Just as we know you’d never agree to having a meeting with you us without immediate arrest if you didn’t need something from us.”
Clint nodded, and then the other man was gone, tearing down the steps. It wasn’t long before Steve was racing up to Clint, panting, obviously caught mid workout. “You know where he is?” Clint could hear the slight wobble in his voice.
“Why?” he pressed, eye glaring at the redhead.
Maybe Obie was just trying to help, trying to bring Stark Industries to the next stage. But there seemed to be no payoff, and it would put thousands, if not millions at risk. Tony knew that Obie and his father had pulled some daring stunts back in the day to take control of the market, but this was just bat-shit insane. Even with Obie's comments - he couldn't see his dad doing this. His dad had been like him, a consultant, an
Tony laughed as he took off down the hallway, listening to the pounds and shouts of The Captain trapped in the other room.
Of course, that didn’t mean much if Fury was planning to have Pierce on his way down to the station before that. They needed to move fast. “Is there a bathroom in here?” she asked loudly.
Steve couldn’t help the laugh that escaped his lips, but he quickly muffled it when he saw Stark’s jaw tighten.
Sam groaned, but dutifully turned on the car, tired squealing as they gunned it down the road.
“So, you’re saying that I can’t have stressful days?”
"Tony?" Tony startled, head snapping to the mob boss. The blonde smiled slightly, nodding encouragingly.
Also. The UroClub is 10000% a real product. A real product that real people own and definitely use. Just something that I'm sure that you wanted to spend your Sunday night thinking about. You're welcome.
His head pounded as he raced across the room, checking behind chairs and couches.
“Are you okay?” he asked anyway.
“Or.”
“He says he’s driving, Tony,” Natasha laughed. “God forbid he gets pulled over for talking on the phone while operating a vehicle.”
Until he heard Romanoff speak up. “Clint? Where are you going with him?”
Stark just waved him off. “Please, like this is putting a dent in my wallet. And I’m pretty sure that refusing to house Captain America is an act of treason. Also, Mr. Stark was my father. I’m just Tony.”
The Captain snapped into action. A quick text to his phone, which Tony assumed was to collect the rest of his mutts, and the man was on the move, looking completely opposite to how he was just moments ago. He trailed Tony into the meeting room, heading straight to the computers.
But was he mad at Tony?
But he knew he wouldn’t. It he did, it would be yet another concession. Another reminder of his past life that would slip away, and here, alone, it was all he had.
Tony quickly snatched an orange from the shelf and lobbed it towards the family. The fruit was right on target; it crashed right into a display of canned green beans, the cans going flying in each direction.
Fling.
“Excellent,” Sparky said, seemingly satisfied.
“We believe so,” Hill replied. “Pierce started a task force a few years ago to crack down on drug trafficking. We now believe that he’s using it as a cover for his dealings with HYDRA. The task force is operating out of a small warehouse just south of Midtown, covering as a small packaging company.” She handed Steve a file folder containing some pictures of the building. “What do you think?”
Tony nodded distantly, his brain no doubt already locking the beginnings of a solution locking into place.
“I don’t want to talk about him. I wanna talk about Wendy.”
Tears slid down his cheek again and he twisted in the sheets, worrying his face between an already tear-stained pillow.
Tony thought, looking back to Sitwell as the man played a tape from the camera.
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Steve answered with an eye roll.
“Already on it,” replied Tony.
Natasha thought again.
Tony blinked the tears away from his eyes rapidly before grabbing Peter to lay him down in his crib. Ensuring that the doors were locked and everything accounted for, Tony took one last look at the empty dining room table before stomping down the stairs, locking himself in his lab.
“You know there was a time when I would have taken a bullet for you?”
he thought to himself. Steve gave Tony a small, private smile before turning back to the newcomers. “Friend,” he agreed, with a nod of his head.
Pierce breathed in deeply. He had to keep his cool, had to keep in control. Usually Pierce wouldn’t reach out to outside parties for assistance, but the revival of HYDRA had not been easy, what with The Captain and now Tony Stark standing in the way. Getting Hammer and The Monger on board was pretty easy, with the end of The Captain and his crew being a common goal they all shared. And now, with the added bonus of offing Tony Stark as well, Pierce seemed to have his hands full of allies. Of course, Pierce still wanted to run the show, keeping his cards close to give him slight leverage. Pierce and his closest HYDRA companions were the only ones who knew about The Captain’s true identity.
“Maybe I had the decency actually pick up and tell you no.”
Steve flinched again at the sound, but felt no pain. He blinked his eyes open as he felt the weight on his back leave him and fall to the ground, making a solid thud sound. Steve spun around again, cocking his gun, only to be met with-
Steve didn’t answer, just grabbed his arm, his other hand reaching for the cream. He stopped when he heard Bucky’s groan. “Other one,” the brunette said.
Steve narrowed his eyes, glaring at the different types of cereal in front of him.
He didn't need more time. It was time to spread his wings, as the phoenix that had clawed his way out of the ashes, out of the sewers. Let them look. Let them see him, truly see him for who he is. He will not cower, not bend, nor break. He will stand before them today not as a broken man, but as one reborn. Obie was right. They will be talking about this for months.
The way The Captain looked away was answer enough. “H-how did you- ”
“They took someone for me too, you know.”
It wasn’t long before he was slipping in the passenger seat of Coulson’s police cruiser, still eyeing the officer warily. Coulson didn’t seem to notice Tony’s staring, just starting up the car instead, heading back towards Midtown.
be focusing on the very attractive and very willing man who's underneath you.”
He heard Yinsen rush over to him. “Is everything ready?”
Pietro hissed, glaring at Tony.
“Don’t you ‘Jasper’ me,” Sitwell snapped, turning towards Coulson. “This little rat is guilty!”
Steve was just another soldier from WWII. He sat in the bloodiest trenches, fought through the dirtiest battles. He killed Nazis.
the whole dating scene. You love me – well, actually not too sure about that right now – and I love you, so what more do I need?”
Weekends were always the worst. At least during the week, he could work his frustrations out by banging around in the scrap yard he worked at. If he could appreciate anything about this prison sentence, it was his job.
Pulling up his sleeve, Barnes found the words ‘
“You really must be off your rocker if that’s the best you can come up with.”
Tony brought Steve’s hands to his chest, wiping as much blood as he could on the underside of his shirt before gathering Steve into his arms. Steve all but collapsed into him, his face jamming into Tony’s neck as his sobs started up again.
Which is how Steve found Tony Stark.
“What’d she say?” Bucky asked, unable to keep his curiosity at bay. Stark sighed, walking down the final steps to the landing, heading straight over to the bar. “Wilson was right,” he shrugged, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Steve wants them to check the rest of the stock piles.”
It was a short drive, but tense; the air was almost cackling with tension from its inhabitants. Sam pulled up in front of the warehouse, the windows already lit up from gunfire. The van was barely in park before the team piled out, charging for the entrance before a spray of bullets had them diving behind large crates.
Phil cursed. “No, no, sweetheart, calm down. They’re not dead. Do you hear me? They’re not dead. Bucky’s alive!”
Steve’s heart threatened to leap out of his chest as he stood back up.
“They saved me.”
“I didn’t ask for help,” Tony whispered.
Thor reached out and grabbed it slowly, confusion written on his face. “I don’t understand. We did not find Loki’s scepter today; there is no cause for celebration.”
“Yea, head of the whole operation. I know, the codename is kinda weird, just all of ours. Guy’s kind of a whack job. But the things he’s got planned, I’m convinced he’s a genius.”
It was there that he saw it, simple black lettering burning right back into his retinas.
“Come on, Phil- ”
Wait.
Bucky adjusted his pants as he walked, waddling to the door. “I knew that would bite me in the ass one day,” he responded.  “Come on,
“Can you or not?”
“How do you plan on accomplishing that?”
“Fury will be pissed,” Tony replied when he finally pulled back for air. Steve just hummed, not looking up from where he was licking up Tony’s ribs. “He’ll throw us in prison,” Tony gasped, throwing his head back as Steve glossed over his nipple.
“The package was from Bruce Banner. I just assumed it was safe.” Sam looked away with a quiet sigh.
They had survived.
“Patriot!” the boy protested.
“Go berate someone else,” Steve scolded. “I’m busy.”
"Oh, we can't let him out, can we?" Stane smiled.
“Oh, that’s the least of my worries,” Tony laughed.
Tony huffed softly. “I need to go in to the office. HYDRA’s hit everything in the New York area. I gotta talk to my people, see if I can prepare them for if HYDRA starts attacking on a national scale.”
When he was met with even more silence, Tony continued. “Nothing to say? You were all about talking just a minute ago. Unless of course- ”
“What now?”
Obie shot him an unimpressed look, before walking over to the bar. “Meds, huh?”
Rogers rolled his eyes. “I don’t have time to explain all this time travel bullshit.”
And with that, Tony veered away, racing out of the warehouse lot and onto the road, leaving The Captain and his problems in the dust.
No, this man was not a Commando, not a US soldier. Steve had never met this man. And yet he had ruined his life.
“Well, yes, but,” Phil sighed. “In order for me to talk about his offenses, I had to explain why I had the knowledge.”
“Alright, listen closely,” Steve started, reaching down to grab and pen and notepad, showing it into his client’s hands. “But I can’t. I’d like to tell you to take a copy of your policy down to Norma Wilcox on- ”
He stood up abruptly, finally grabbing the sketch from Tony’s hands. Making sure Tony was watching, Steve walked over to the far wall after grabbing a pin from his desk, and tacked Tony’s picture up along all the other art. “Because,” Steve said, turning to face Tony again. “You’re one of us now, a Commando. Like it or not, you’re stuck with us.”
“Possibly think that you’re acting rationally? No, no I cannot.”
Tony had seen the pictures. It was almost an art form, and Tony was, needless to say, impressed.
“Well he was here at some point; this meal looks fresh.”
“Besides, we need you here,” Steve tried to reason. “This might just be one big bust. You’ll need to keep looking for other locations, just in case. HYDRA could be hiding somewhere else, too. You’re the only one that can find them. Everyone has their job, Tony. I need you to do yours.”
Tony pulled Coulson closer, almost shoving the man into his embrace. He could feel the other man tense up and well, it wasn’t surprising. Hell, what was surprising was that Tony went in for a hug at all. He and the less-than law abiding cop had never been close; they barely interacted. In fact most of their dalliances consisted of snarky comments and dull sighs. The only real coexistence between the two was the time Coulson sprung him from jail and in return, Tony played a role as a key player in the arrangement of his murder.
“Alright,” she agreed, voice low.
"And you pushed it with a threat to my crew," retorted Steve. "You can't expect me to be in a very cooperative mood."
Tony watched Barnes slump, defeated, before moving to head out of the room. When he got to the door, he shot Tony one last final glare, which Tony responded with a winning smile.
Steve sent the man his best press conference smile. “Just here to help,” he said with a small salute.
to most,” he continued, ignoring Bucky’s sniggering. “But that doesn’t mean anything if you’re shit in bed! I mean, I haven’t always been this way, and I don’t have a lot of experience, and- ”
“I’m in.”
“But not for you,” Tony croaked.
Rumlow started to talk again, but was cut off as an opening door whacked him in the back of the head. Rumlow gave a shout of surprise, causing him to fire his weapon. The shot bounced all around the room, getting the attention of everyone in the office.
“Closets are clear!” boomed Thor.
“You did it in 3.81,” Hill corrected softly.
But he ignored himself, opting to open the door that was thankfully unlocked. Walking in, he saw the room was pitch dark except for the sliver of light he brought in with him. Although he couldn’t see anyone inside, Tony knew that he was being watched anyway.
“Yes.”
Tony just smiled. “I’m going to have so much fun with you.”
Steve nodded, gesturing to one of the side bedrooms. “Is he?”
Tumblr: just-another-tinker
Steve frowned, poking at Tony. “You’re pretty grumpy for a man that just got laid.”
“Mr. Stark.”
The man pushed the last guard away and thrust the office door open.
“Why, thank you,” Tony said as he spun around. “You know, nothing but the best for my- oh fuck.”
Bucky huffed, grabbing his coffee mug from the kitchen table before stepping outside. He ignored the fresh wall of heat that he was met with, walking over to his garage. He yanked the door open, the aging metal groaning in protest, the familiar sight of a rundown Chevy meeting him. He wasn’t sure why he was so enamored with this hunk of junk. He wasn’t anywhere near Tony’s level of expertise, and while he enjoyed the occasional tinkering, he wasn’t sure why he ended up messing with the vehicle almost every day. It wasn’t as if anything really needed to be fixed – as least, anything he could handle on his own. He would just take things apart and put them back together, his hands itching for some level of familiarity he got when he cleaned his guns.
“I do trust you,” sighed Steve. “It’s me I don’t trust. Look at all the shit I’ve caused already. I didn’t tell Tony who I was, I left you in that warehouse. How long before I make the wrong decision again?”
Thor smiled at her. “Go, child. Your mother is waiting for you over there.”
“Please, Captain," Yinsen interrupted. "It’s alright; it is of no consequence to me that I do not know your birth name. In fact, it is probably better that I do not. After all, you have your family to take care of, and I have mine.”
Clint choked on his coffee. “I’m sorry, did you say Tony Stark?
The whole team stared at the newcomer.
Steve looked about, dumbfounded. He glanced at Bucky’s equally confused face to make sure he hadn’t missed anything. “What surprise? A trip to Brooklyn?”
“What do you want?”
Pepper dug her fingernails into the side of his neck. “You are walking a very thin line, mister, so you better watch it.”
“Of course, Sir. Scanning now.”
“You could have said you heard it on the street! You could have pretended you had a CI, Phil!”
Tony stretched over on his back finally meeting Steve’s sparkling blue eyes. “What can I say? I’m a miracle worker.”
Sighing, he started to walk towards the lab. It was just a little over 3 a.m. No one else should have been up. Key word: should.
“I listened to a few of them on my way up here,” Fury continued. “I was particularly keen of your bonus episodes.”
“Jesus Christ! I’m not drunk!”
She chuckled at the thought of James batting off horny, menopausal women. “He’ll survive. It’s a shame, about Florida, though. I was hoping that he’d end up further north, maybe by some mountains. Somewhere where he could fish in peace and quiet.”
“Show me your hands,” he stated, watching as Pepper raised them slowly, distrust already clouding her eyes. Smart of her, considering the laundry list of tasks that Tony had asked of her, most of them unseemly.
Tony sighed, tossing the phone back to its unconscious owner. With any luck, the man wouldn’t remember their interaction at all. Even if he did, Tony knew that he and Barnes would be long gone by the time that he came too. For as much of a pain it was to deal with Strange's people, Tony knew that he had heard nothing but the best about them. After all, they ran a monopoly in a market that they created themselves. New York was teeming with criminals, and criminals were teeming with chaos. And even criminals need doctors.
Fury raised an eyebrow. “You asking for protection, Stark?”
Pierce walked up to his man in the driver seat. “Wait for an opening and then finish them.”
Sure enough, Bucky Barnes stood on the other side of the glass, face pale and eyes wide. Steve opened the window.
“It’s my job to lie to people,” Pierce answered.
“That’s exactly what you’re going to do. You’re done with this. You’re out. I’ve talked with Pepper. She’s going to take you to Malibu for a while.”
“Shut up,” she hissed at her brother.
“Oh my God,” Tony gaped, looking at the box with wide eyes. “This is real?”
Steve groaned when Tony’s fingers brushed against his pulsing length, hips thrusting into Tony’s grip. “Please,” he whispered again, lips dragging along Tony’s neck. He grabbed at Tony’s hand holding his erection and dragged it lower, fingers brushing against his opening.
“It was your plan!”
“I sent Laufeyson in first. And, since he hasn’t returned yet, it’s safe to say that I was right and The Captain left men there to stop him. Hopefully they’ll be too distracted by his mind games to keep a watch on it. They'll let their guard down and we can sneak in this week and take it all before they decide to move the files.”
The base that had just blown up.
Steve sighed, reaching in his pocket for his wallet. “Alright, Barnes. Let’s get this over with.”
“So what now?” Romanoff cut in. “What’s our play?”
He bit his lip, hoping that maybe he remembered that as well, but to no avail. Apparently, she wasn’t worth remembering. By the look in her intelligent eyes and her cruel smirk, it finally hit him.
“We need to talk to Steve,” Sam sighed.
Steve had hissed in return.
Her body paused at a viscous reminder from her brain.
The main floor was completely empty.
Hell, Steve hadn’t even told Bucky about the locations for years. It wasn’t until he had found the frail blonde in some dive bar in Hell’s Kitchen drinking himself to death that he’d first heard about it. Peggy was dead. She was the last of them, but more than that, she was Steve’s tipping point. The final crack that shattered his armor.
“I mean come on, this is the 21
Steve spun around quickly, ignoring the way the world tilted slightly, the man tripping over himself to find where the bullet had gone.
“That’s not funny,” the blonde grit out.
There were a few callers that would share their experiences and tips. Steve’s favorite was Sam Wilson, a vet working at a VA office down in Washington D.C. He was a regular caller, and always offered words that seemed wise beyond his years, as well as helpful programs to get them back on their feet. Sam had even promised to stop by and record with them in person this spring, when he’d come up to New York for a friend’s wedding.
But he would have to deal with that later; there were other notions that had started to plague his mind, starting right as he shut the door of the blonde's office, his mind finally breaking away from thoughts of The Captain's mouth, only to focus instead on the words the mouth had formed. It was like a flick of a switch. One second, Tony found himself more content than he had ever been in his life, and now he was nervously twitching in his chair, biting off all his nails.
“What the hell is wrong with you?” Steve hissed.
Steve’s blood froze over. They knew it wasn’t his real name. “You think anyone’s falling for that parlor trick anymore? The name that Tony Stark released to the public doesn’t mean anything when you are still allies with the man.”
No, Tony couldn’t get any closer to HYDRA by himself, just like The Captain wouldn’t get anywhere without Tony. Or, at least, that’s what Tony had thought. It was Thor’s arrival that tipped him over; the influx of a new variable in an already unstable equation, making Tony nothing more than a constant: so small that he became obsolete. Thor had resources, had the money to do whatever Tony could do.
“Sorry, but I don’t feel comfortable talking to you over the phone.”
“Well, for one, we can’t go through with this job.” Steve ignored the resounding groans he got from the other occupants in the room.
“I’ve seen some pretty sad things in my life, Mr. Stark. But you went down faster than a flower bows to the wind,” Yinsen smirked.
Shaking fingers punched the number into the phone.
Steve sobbed into his hands.
Steve nodded. And wouldn’t that be a knife to the gut. Steve and his men turning to an energy company for guns rather than an actual weapons dealer. But Steve and Thor go way back. Steve had first run into the hulking blonde years ago, when Asgardian tech started making its way across the pond. Asgard usually did business over on the eastern hemisphere, so when Steve heard that Thor and his father were coming over to globalize their market, Steve thought he had hit the jackpot. Not being a native to the area, Asgard’s security were no match for Steve and Bucky, the two easily breaking in to their storage. Steve and Bucky planned on stealing the weapons and tech they had brought across with them. What they hadn’t planned on was running into Thor as they were leaving.
risk that again.”
Fury’s voice sounded in his head.
Steve walked over the left, dumping Stark into an available chair. “Sit. Stay,” Steve snapped while pointing at the chair.
“The other names on the list,” he started.
She shrugged again. “I wanted zucchini.”
Clint’s voice laughed in her ear.
Clint snorted. “Like you’d even know where to look.”
“Leave? Where the hell are you going?”
The doors swung open revealing a spacious common floor, complete with the full treatment. Long couches adorned the room, lying on top of an expensive rug. The modern kitchen to the left was fully stocked, not just with food, but with machines Steve had never even seen before.  Along the back wall were floor to ceiling windows, giving Steve a wide view of Manhattan. A view he didn’t recognize.
When he finally spun around, he paused, taking in the woman in front of him. She was beautiful, crystal eyes with blonde hair pinned perfectly, dressed in a glittering gown that accented hear deadly curves. She was exactly the type of woman he would usually go for – for a time that seemed like an entire lifetime ago. In fact, by the way she was looking at him, the more he thought that he had already make a move in the past. He peeked down at her manicured hands and –
“Sorry, Tones,” replied Bucky, patting the smaller man’s ass lightly. “I can’t risk being on Pepper’s shit list.”
“Yes, Sir,” Clint said with a sigh. He watched as Steve retreated, no doubt back to the back room, anyway from everyone.
Phil’s blood ran cold. “What?” he asked quietly, caught completely off guard.
Tony snorted, sharp laughter escaping his chest as he wrestled in bed with Steve. “You’ve been hanging around me too much,” he giggled. “I’ve ruined you.”
Bucky both. You won’t admit it, but I know you’re terrified of something happening to me. I take one extra breath and you’re about ready to ship me off to the ER. I understand,” he continued, cupping Steve’s cheek. “Lord knows that if our situations were reversed, I’d be the same way.”
“How long do we have to wait?”
No. This wasn’t right, this wasn’t
Tony had acquired many enemies over the years, whether it be from his past weapon dealings, or his new superhero persona. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to forgive himself if Pepper got hurt because of him.
“Maybe we should shack up here for the night, get some rooms,” Bucky said, eyes blazing. “I’m sure we’re all beat.”
-------------------------
He looked back up shyly, hesitantly meeting Steve’s gaze again. Steve looked back, his mouth parted as he tried to from a response.
Once alone in the elevator, Tony leaned against the hand railing.
Barton was silent for a long moment, the arched tearing his eyes away from Tony. “I understand, you know. Why you can’t trust us. Hell, I never thought I could ever trust anyone like I do with them. Growing up in the circus, there was no trust. You were always on your own. I was only eight when I started sleeping with a dagger under my pillow because I didn’t want people to come and steal my things.”
It’s how she was taught; what the Red Room forced into her brain. She didn’t know any better. This was how she survived. Natasha felt a tear slip down her cheek.
Steve shook his head. “This whole time you were alive? Why didn’t you- ” he broke off, a chill spilling over him. He glared back at the screen, staring back at the not-so dead man. “It was you,” Steve whispered hoarsely. “That whole time, it was you. You were the mole.”
“Don’t shift the blame.
“Oh, please, Pep. You know I wouldn’t ever schedule a meeting myself,” Tony laughed, finally catching up with their current situation. "Nothing more than a social visit, right Grant?” Steve gave the group another smile as Tony continued. “Well then, Grant. This is the lovely Virginia Potts, my PA, and probably the only reason he head is still screwed on straight. And this,” Tony gestured to the man,” is my business partner, Obadiah Stane.”
“Leave us, won’t you, Pep?”
“You killed them all,” Steve realized. “They were our
Rogers clenched his jaw. “They’re aware of where I came from.”
Steve rushed forward, pushing Stark against the hard table, pressing his gun against the hard plane of his chest. "I'm done playing your games. What I
“Well,” the man answered, “you’ve definitely seen better days. Don’t worry; the bruises will fade. You managed to avoid breaking any more bones, so you’ve got that going for you.”
“No, no, please,” Steve whispered at the scene unfolding in front of him.
the bed, as the mob boss had over half of his weight on the bed while still managing to sit in the chair he’d pulled up alongside Tony’s bed. His position was almost hilarious because, knowing Steve, the man had probably spent hours trying to find a position where he was as close to Tony as possible without actually touching him for fear of injury. The only point of contact was Steve’s hand, which was threaded gently through one of Tony’s, limp from sleep, but still warm and alive.
Rumlow smiled down at the screens. After being removed from the case by Fury, he decided to take things into his own hands. He called old contacts from HYDRA, hoping they would come across anything.
“Tony?!” Steve tried more desperately.
Steve returned with a small smile of his own. “By all means,” he said, gesturing to the blubbering mess tied to the chair in front of them.
Steve looked at him fondly. “Tony, I know you have JARVIS hack the cameras wherever we go. You know exactly how it went today.”
Steve was just a coward.
“No. Went off the grid. Couldn’t take a chance of anyone finding me.”
“He knows who you are.”
Steve remembered how his mother had lamented when he first came home from basic training, back before he even knew what the face was. But she had seen the beginnings of it, even then.
“Excuse me?”
“Bucky, I- ”
Steve snorted. “Screw you and your wife. None of this concerns me.”
Clint gave a small nod, but Steve could tell it wasn’t enough. Steve sighed. “Why don’t you go out and shadow him? Just until he’s out of uniform. You’re not going to be of any use here; might as well give your mind some peace.”
Tony shot him a dry look. “You do understand how dating works, right?”
“Calm down. Yes, there was a bomb. But we got everyone out; we’re on cleanup right now. But isn’t Steve with you? When he heard there was a second explosion, he tore out of here like a bat outta hell.”
“I’m serious, Tony.”
“But he was an asset!” Pierce hissed. “With Stark gone off in the wind, The Captain is keeping his cards close to his chest again. The people he considers his family are the only things to draw him out of his cave, now. I could have used him.”
“Where’s Steve?”
“No kidding. Owing Fury one favor was dangerous enough, but another one? I mean, he went way out of his way to set all of this up for us. He needs us for something, but for what, I haven’t the foggiest. That’s what worries me the most.”
Now Steve was just another name, but this? Tony looked back down at the sketch of his father. A simple name of Steve wasn’t just any other name anymore. Tony’s heartbeat escalated once again, feeling his brain take off in a torrent, processing the new information.
“You’re no fun,” Barnes snapped at the blonde.
“It didn’t have to be this way,” Steve said.
I didn’t fight back anymore after that; I couldn’t risk them sending something down that belonged to any of you.”
“Oh, I do
So no, Tony did not go back for them as a business move. Tony had to show The Captain that he still
“Wake up,” Steve whispered in Tony’s hair, letting his lips linger to place a gentle kiss against the brunette’s forehead.
“They were married, you know.”
“We have listeners,” Steve snapped in response.
Tony nodded, following Obie as the man got up from the bar, heading towards the door. “I’ll get you something.”
Steve!”
Bucky rolled his eyes, crossing his arms. “Really?” Steve didn’t have time to apologize before Bucky was snatching the gun out of his hand, smacking the butt of it against his head gently. “You haven’t slept in God knows how long. You shouldn’t even be allowed to
Clint gasped dramatically. “Why, Phil, I never! The food is just a nice bonus.”
“That settles it, then,” the engineer continued. “Come on, Barnes, let’s get this done.” He followed Stark up to Steve’s office, watching as the man carefully started to take down each of Steve’s sketches. He wanted to protest, but it was obvious he was doing it for a reason. He shifted from one foot to another, watching as Stark examined each photo carefully.
Steve shrugged. “Oh, I don’t know. Education is important.”
Natasha grinned, shifting further into the couch and closed her eyes, listening to the pair bicker over her. She gripped the phone tightly in her hands.
Barton nodded. “Makes sense.”
Steve puffed his chest out. “I can, and I will.”
Pierce slammed a fist down on his desk. “
he whispered in between sobs.
The apartment wasn’t much, more like a loft. Since the building had been abandoned for a few years, all of the furniture was cleaned out except for a some chairs and a small table littered with whatever food Nick Beattie shoved down his throat before fleeing.
Steve thought to himself.
“But you can relax, mother hen,” Clint continued. “It’s been months, and no one’s suspected anything. I even got the slip on my handler because I have an alibi,” he grinned. “I was at work.”
“Save it for someone who cares. Because this,” Tony said, gesturing between the two of them, “is over. I’m done with you. I’m done with your lies and your secrets. I know what happens to people who get caught in your web, Steve Rogers. Because I don’t know if you remember, but I almost died yesterday. I almost died because of you and your lies. Well I’m done. I’m out.”
“We still have our work cut out for us. There was an explosion at Stark Industries as well. But with the second attack here, it’s no question that whoever’s behind this is after the whole team,” said Steve.
Soon, Steve found himself pulling up to base. Almost falling out of the car, Steve breathed deep when he found the building just as they left it.
Steve’s mind was racing. Two explosions in one day, let alone in one hour was no coincidence. Tony was probably at Stark Industries now, but since he didn’t call, who knows what happened. But Steve trusted Tony. If anyone could handle an attack on his company, it was Iron Man. His team needed him now.
Tony shrugged. “Personally, I don’t think so, but I have a feeling you’ll want to do this more.”
“It’s one thing to put them there, it’s another to say they were there the whole time,” Fury countered. “To the rest of the force, the physical files don’t exist. Why?”
Tony snorted. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”
“What does this have to do with me?”
“I got a call about some suspicious activity. That wouldn’t have anything to do with you, now would it?”
Pietro pouted at him, running a hand through the silver that had already sprung up on top of the brown. “It makes me look more mature,” he replied, his faint accent filtering through the breeze. “Women like mature.”
“A place for ourselves,” Bucky said slowly, frown blooming on his face.
Reasons like that were more than enough to call for more layers, maybe even shoes, but Tony couldn’t be bothered. Each morning he’d stumble out in whatever threadbare shirt that he’d collapsed into bed with, ratty pants, and worn socks that started to bear rips and holes from his walk outside from the days before.
“Rumlow. Brock Rumlow,” whispered Coulson.
“You’re alive,”he whispered.
Phil thought. Clint wasn’t answering the phone. That did not mean good things. “He’s got his own life to lead," he tried to play it off. "He’s probably busy.”
“Look what I found,” she hummed, sounding completely unperturbed by the struggling man in her grip.
“We had a fight before he was shot,” Steve replied softly. “I said some things. Hell, I basically told Tony that he was a bad father, Clint. Why would I say something like that? How could that thought ever cross my mind? This whole time I’ve been sitting here thinking that what if that was the last thing he thought about? I mean, he’s a great father Clint, and I just- ”
Steve walked through the cemetery slowly, taking in the silence.
Tony rolled his eyes. “The serum! When was the last time?”
Steve had known that there was a good chance that Tony would never come to bed, but he still couldn’t help but feel upset, a small gnawing grief that sat in the pit of his stomach, that Tony chose to lick his wounds in private rather than share them with Steve. It was irrational of course – it wasn’t as if Steve had always been forthcoming with his issues. But Tony had remained by his sides anyway. And if that’s all Steve could do, that’s all he would.
Normally, Tony would just say screw it. It would probably be less hassle for him to just snag another computer from his place than head back into that shit storm. But that computer had all the locations that JARVIS managed to weed out as potential HYDRA locations. And even though Tony was saying sayonara to The Commandos, there was no way that he was stepping out of the game.
“I couldn’t finish anything,” Tony shrugged. “I had so many things buzzing around in my head, I couldn’t finish one before I found myself starting on the next. It’s just,
Each brush of the washcloth seemed to bring up another scar, another bruise that Tony had to suffer through alone. Steve had sat beside Bruce and helped him clean each one, taking a chunk of Steve’s tainted soul with each one. He felt himself turning the other way when Bruce had to tear out the stitches to replace the crude string that was currently keeping Tony whole. Steve barely managed to hold it together when Bruce had to re-break two of Tony’s fingers that were healing incorrectly. Steve didn’t think he’d be able to describe the feeling of seeing Tony like this; the once well-oiled machine barely able to keep running.
Steve found himself nodding again, unable to process the numb feeling beginning to engulf his body. Of course. Of course it wasn’t just Bucky that he’d broken. It wasn’t just Tony. It was everyone. Steve had left every last member of his crew out to dry. He’d promised them, promised
“What the hell?” Barnes yelped, jumping in the air as his clawed robot snatched the device from his hand, DUM-E scurrying over with the tech clenched gently in his claw.
“You remember Rumlow? Well, when The Captain and his boys picked him up, Stane had installed a tracker into his tooth; we’ve already got a potential lock on where The Captain’s base is stationed. I say we go and light up the place.”
“I’m sorry, but that’s rich coming from the man that came all the way over here to stamp his feet and whine.”
Natasha. The Chief of the NYPD. The same NYPD, might I add, that Phil is currently working at!”
“Who?” Steve found himself asking.
“I didn’t. I made it last night. I needed something to do.”
“Tony, you were
Steve pressed a kiss into Tony’s forehead. “Yes. I’ll always love you. Until my last breath.”
"I need to head over there. Obie?"
He should hate it. But he couldn’t. Not if it was with Steve.
“Sorry, sir. But for this business, I’m going to need to come inside.”
“I promised you that you’d get your revenge on The Commandos, did I not? They’re weak right now; they’ve been weak since their home burst in flames. I have total confidence that their downfall is near.”
The pair locked eyes, both looking for answers they didn’t have in the other.
have stopped this if Bucky hadn’t-
“Yea, yea, all accounted for. Actually, more than all,” Tony said with a glance at Clint. “But I heard there was an explosion at base. We all good? Where’s Steve?!”
“I don’t expect you to tell them anything.”
“What the hell are you doing?” asked Tony, turning to watch Barnes strip off his winter coat.
“We need to leave.
“Why the hell would he- ” Tony handed Steve the picture that Christine had given him, cutting off Steve’s reply. “What is this?”
And Clint ran.
he snarled.
He could vaguely hear Clint yell at him, but Steve continued to pull forward. Bucky was in there.
He was safe here. He didn’t have to be faced with those heartbroken eyes. In fact, Tony would have been perfectly fine to just stay there indefinitely. But, if Steve knew him, which he did, then the blonde knew exactly where Tony was. And if Tony knew Steve, which he did, then he knew that Steve had known the whole time, and was just giving him time to cool off.
I failed and let hundreds of people die including, as you seemed to have forgotten about the blood spray behind us, my other best friend!”
He could still see Tony’s face as he saw the bomb land at their feet.
“What did he do?” Tony snapped, but Bucky could hear the underlying fondness. “He’s making a face, isn’t he?”
“I’m saying, Tony,” Steve said with exasperation, “is that you need to be there for our son.”
Bucky snorted. “Yeah, well that’s Stevie for you.” The other man continued when he saw Tony wince at the name. “You’ve got quite a lot of beef with Cap, don’t you?”
“And why not?” Tony argued, unable to stop the vicious thoughts to pass through his head. “I’m sure you’ll so just fine.” Steve could adapt anywhere; he
Clint heard Nat give a small scoff next to him. “The only understanding that’s escaping me right now is why you think I’m going to cooperate with you.”
Tony snorted. “Oh, yeah? Why is that?”
“Now,” Fury sighed. “Tell me about this smoking gun? What do you have, that will get me to let you all off scot free?”
Tony could almost feel the tension skyrocket in the room, everyone in it freezing, no one daring to say a word. “Pierce, you said? I can have JARVIS run a trace. I mean, there’s probably hundreds of options in New York, but we can probably narrow down a few- ”
The blonde was frustratingly patient, even when Tony saw him screw his own eyes shut, sweat starting to bead on his red forehead. Even like this, he was still stunning. Tony could see him shaking, the teasing pleasure driving his insane. But yet, he forced himself to hold back, letting Tony chase his own enjoyment first. It wasn’t enough.
“Please.”
“What a waste,” she heard him say.
“Well, I’d like to think you could manage the meaning of the word ‘no’,” quipped Tony, not even looking up from whatever he was working on.
JARVIS had apparently been running back-traces through all of SI’s servers to find potential leads at some point, but from what the AI had told Tony, he had stopped about a month in and was ordered to by Ms. Potts to focus all efforts on finding Tony. Now that Tony was back, JARVIS was back on the grind, transferring everything he already had over to Tony to look over. Which he did, for about ten minutes. One second he was over at his desk, typing away like a madman, then the next he was sitting with Clint, smushing his feet, sans shoes, underneath Clint’s thigh for warmth.
“Because that’s not all the photos he gave me,” Bucky said tersely. He pushed aside the photos of Steve and Loki. “Because Loki has been meeting with someone other than Steve.”
Seeing that the coast was clear, Natasha stood, stretching her back before walking over to the desk. She immediately deleted the notification for the new email on her phone – Mrs. Barkley was a future problem, one that required a lot more patience and a lot more alcohol. She walked over to her discarded ballet slipper and considered putting it back on. She taught every Wednesday and Saturday in the local community center, but on Saturday’s, there were a few hours gap before the next teacher came in to teach yoga. When she first started this job, Natasha stayed as long as she could, dancing in solitude, pushing per body to its limit in order to have something to focus on, something to feel.
Apparently, Tony was working with HYDRA.
Tony reacted immediately, jumping over his deck and reaching to an extra handgun he taped to the underside. This sure as hell wasn't The Captain's work. If he'd decided he was done with their partnership, Tony knew the man had no qualms sending Barnes to pop him in the street. And if it wasn't The Commandos, it had to be the looming doom of HYDRA, coming back to finish the job. He looked at the door, bracing for action.
Tony kissed Steve’s forehead. “But yet, you’re thinking about it in your head. You are, aren’t you? I bet you’d like that, tying me down and- ”
Tony swallowed around the lump forming in his throat, ignoring the pain throbbing just behind the arch reactor, opting to continue with his daily routine.
A mop of dirty blonde hair stepped around The Captain, leveling Loki with an icy glare. “That would be me.”
Tony looked back up at the door. Whoever was out there, wasn’t Steve. Taking a deep breath, Tony flung the door open.
“I said that he got the jump on me, and managed to escape.”
Tony jerked away, galking at his CFO for not backing him up. The balding man just stared back, and Tony could almost hear the look say,
This shouldn’t have happened.
“If you had the choice to do it over,” Bucky started. “If you could go back in time and stop yourself from giving up your identify. If you could stop yourself from dropping everything to be someone new just to stop HYDRA, would you do it? Would you go back, change everything, so you could keep your name and just walk away? Start a new life far away from New York City?”
“You won’t make a very good Commando, then.”
“Told them what? Another file drop? Steve, that shit isn’t a top priority anymore. We’ll work it out, just like we always do.”
Steve barely caught Bucky mouth a
Then Steve was laughing, a deep rumble from his chest, and leaning forward, catching Tony in a deep kiss. “I love you,” he smiled, eyes crinkling.
She watched in horror as the man jumped from the building and towards the street below. Without thinking twice, Steve backed up, took a running start, and jumped across the abyss catching the falling man. The two crashed through the window of the building, Steve twisting their bodies to try and prevent the man further harm. “I think you broke something,” the man moaned.
even. She could have any investor emptying out his pockets with a few words from her; she could have this this entire room waiting on her hand and foot by the end of the night is she wanted. It was if she was destined to end up here. Tony had always envied that – Pepper always seemed to know what she wanted, and when she wanted it. Tony had spent too much of his life bouncing between doing whatever the fuck he wanted or riding others curtails to get by. He was always stuck out in limbo and rolling with the punches, doing what he needed to stay ahead of the other guy. In the moment, he thought that was all he needed, just living the high of proving he was the smartest person in the room. But in the end, after the rush had gone, and he was left alone, he was always left floundering. Floundering to a point to where he’d make his next bad decision only to start the cruel cycle over again.
Enjoy!
“Don’t bother,” The Captain sneered. Tony shivered - he'd never heard the man sound that way, even when they first met. “There’s nowhere for you to run anymore.”
Pierce narrowed his eyes. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
tried. They all had. Steve was on a slippery slope, and they all tried to pull him back to safety. But did he listen? Of course not. He thought that he was helping, that he was protecting them. And look what happened to him. Look what happened to them. If Bucky had looked that haunted, there was no doubt in his mind that the rest of his family was carrying the same weight.
“That good, huh?” Steve answered, stepping away, his hands trying to straighten out the deep wrinkles in his shirt. “Well, I guess that’s what you get for spending a few nights in the car.”
Steve stopped the complaint with a kiss. “Want me to teach you how to make a S’more?”
“Can I talk to you for a second?”
“Tell me what you know.”
“I’m getting sheets for our bed.”
“And I thought it was just another thing I would get used to because Jesus, Steve, I’ve been crying like crazy. I had to put my mask down for a bit yesterday because I just about bawled when I handed those kittens over. And sometimes it’s not all bad! Like last night –
“And this?” Tony laughed wetly, as he wiped at one of his fallen tears with his other hand. “This is the pièce de résistance.”
“Well, we’ll have to coordinate then,” Fury “You take your people with Hill to the warehouse to collect the files, I’ll go and arrest Pierce. We in agreement?”
Barnes snorted. “You didn’t come back there to save our asses; you’d probably be happier if some of us got killed off.”
-------------------------
“You talk to DUM-E when you’re replacing his parts,” said Bucky. “I don’t even think you have to maintain him as much as you do, with how quality the material is, but you do anyway. You replace his parts and oil everything up by hand, like you’ve been doing since you were a kid. You give him crap a lot, but I know you see him as your own child. I love that you can find love in anything, even a washed up, brainwashed assassin like me.”
"Only? You make it sounds like it's okay that I have four employees dead after today," Tony snapped.
“What do you mean, that’s it?”
“Hush, Steve, the adults are talking,” Tony snapped over his shoulder. “With what he saw,” he added, looking back at Barnes, “with, you know. If it were me, all I’d want would be Rhodey. Even if I stayed, we both know you’d still be in here.”
They should have killed each other.
“Christmastime last year, Steve volunteered for a rummage sale at a local church and asked us to donate some items in support.”
He could heard Barton’s sigh, the lump on the bed shifting slightly through the released breath.
“Steve,
“Okay.”
“Steve, you’re a janitor.”
“No, you don’t get to do that,” she snapped. “Every single time I bring them up, you brush it off as if it’s nothing, and now it’s been
The man closed his eyes, before nodding slowly. “You’re right, Buck. There are always other options.”
Steve didn’t bother with a response, just ending the call and returning his focus to the long road in front of him. The site in New Jersey was a bit of a drive, but the thought of that archive being cleaned out had his insides twisting in knots.
Steve smirked. “Don’t you get it? Iron Man will never exist, meaning the monsters he created won’t exist either. I have a new future. And it’s not you.”
“I know, I know, Pep. I’m trying.”
Steve injected the serum into his blood, feeling his senses come alive.
With that, he slammed down on the gas, the car lurching forward as he gained speed. Hitting the underside of the steering wheel, a hidden console appeared, Steve’s fingers masterfully dancing over the panel to lock the car into auto-drive. Another series of taps and Steve felt his seat fall back, his tux already being pulled away until only a familiar suit of red white and blue remained. Smiling down at his costume, Steve reached behind him and pulled up his cowl before grasping back at the steering wheel.
“Okay,” said Rhodes, slapping his hands against his thighs. “This is what we’re gonna do. Pepper, you stay here, keep the radar low. I want this door locked and that gun loaded at all times, do you hear me? If there’s a mole running around in here, I don’t want to leave you unprepared. You,” he continued, pointing to Steve,” are going to call on any criminal and street rat you can think of. I want every possible pair of eyes looking out for Tones. If you get anything, and I mean anything, you are going to call me. You understand?”
“God, you’re insane," Tony laughed.
“Bucky. Buck, calm down.”
Steve lowered his shield. Just then, his target showed up. Startling, Steve stared at the man in front of him. Unlike the others, this man was not bound, and there was no cover on his head. He stared back up at Steve, with the same steely blue eyes.
"Are you so sure?" Pierce replied. "Last I heard you wasted your one phone call on the man, and he couldn't even be bothered to answer."
Rotting six feet under with the rest of them.
Steve placed the table down while Pietro zoomed around the room, picking up the fallen dishes. Tony snapped the gauntlets off as Wanda lifted the chairs back to their rightful position. Steve nodded to his older son, Tony noticing that the man had inched closer to the closet that contained his shield, just in case. Pietro walked over to the door quietly, peering outside as he opened it.
“Uh, sorry,” Steve smiled like a schoolboy. “I guess we had the wrong apartment?”
Steve stared at the ceiling. Natasha walked over to him, and straddled him. She tried to take off Steve’s shirt, but he stopped him.
“No, not that. It’s Delmar.”
He turned when he heard a gun cock.
Bruce grumbled slightly before strapping in.
the owner always says, and continued through the back door. Steve traversed a long hallway, to reach a bolted iron door, with a camera staring down at him.
I didn’t know what to do, so I just let it happen, and it was
“I’m not here to talk to you about The Winter Soldier.”
Steve placed his shield on the ground and turned around slowly.
Steve looked down at his son, seeing that Pepper was right. Peter was wearing a face almost identical to Tony’s; one of fierce and grumpy determination, as the child tried to force himself to stay awake. His eyes were red rimmed from his earlier tears, no doubt matching Steve’s, and the Avenger onesie that Clint had gotten for the boy was almost unrecognizable with the dark stains that now blotched that cloth.
“No,” Bucky replied. “But then again, I didn’t ask him anything.”
Clint had laughed. He didn’t really think that part through, but he knew that Phil knew that. There was a part of him that thought he didn’t need to bother because no matter what he did, he’d never see Phil again. A part of him that Phil constantly proved wrong.
Steve nodded. “I’ve thought about it many times. The SSR has been done for years, sometimes I find it ridiculous that I’m still guarding their mysteries. But every time I think about it, I just – I can never bring myself to do it. Honoring their memory, I suppose. Continue to hold the line and keep at my job that I swore to all those years ago. But I refuse to use it, either.”
He turned around to face the island in the kitchen, stumbling when he laid eyes on the sight in front of him.
But today wasn't a compete victory for them. Last time, Steve hadn't seen the full picture until it was too late. He hadn't seen what HYDRA was truly capable of until it was too late. But this time, they'd shown their hand too early. If this is what they're willing to resort to, then the storm coming is far worse than what he'd imagined. But at least he's seen it coming, this time. He could protect them, this time.
Tony flinched at Pepper’s shrill tone before pressing his face farther onto the bag of frozen peas.
Steve was still pushed into his shoulder, simultaneously trying to pull away and burrow closer into the familiar body. Clint could barely hear, as both hearing aids had flown out from the brunt of the explosion. Even without them, however, he still managed to hear Steve’s screams.
“No,” Steve interrupted. “It’s more than that, more than the fight. Something’s wrong with us. And I know you know. But I don’t. Bucky and I clearly have done something wrong here, or maybe said something that’s got you acting strange. Whatever it was, I’m sure it was just a misunderstanding, so just tell me.”
The Captain laughed. “If you were going to do that, you would have done it already. Besides, my bullets are faster than your words.”
“A flight?”
“You comin’ in?” Clint asked.
“Phil, I- ”
“You… broke into my house?” he asked slowly.
“If I let little comments affect me, I wouldn’t have made it very far.”
Pepper smirked in response. “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
Steve eyed her shirt again. It was Clint’s; at least, he was pretty sure. Not that he ever remembered Clint wearing it, but he didn’t know anyone else who owned clothing with that many holes and stains. Didn’t matter, it still looked good on Natasha. Even after all these years, he’s never figured out the full extent of their relationship; Bucky knew about as much as he did. Of course, both were too chicken to ask, more than content to be left with their questions.
She leaned against the back wall as the elevator started to descend to the ground floor.
“Well, it wasn’t too long before even New York City got too small for the number of mafias crawling around in the gutters. It was pure anarchy – people were killing each other left and right as they fought over territory, contraband, anything, really.”
Tony looked up at Steve, smiling softy when Steve pulled him into a kiss. “I’m not going anywhere. Not without you,” Steve said against his lips.
“You need money? I can get you funds! What about weapons; you need a new haul?”
Tony’s eyes widened as he saw what was staring back up at him.
And again; thank you, thank you. Serious kudos to you guys for keeping along with the story; hope it will live up to your expectations!
Rumlow scoffed. “Why does it matter? We’ve got this one right here! Let’s just call the doc and finish this right here. I’m gonna bring him up to see- ”
“Listen, I don’t have time for this bullshit- ”
“Of course I know. But since when does HYDRA care about ‘right’?”
The man in the chair still ignored Romanoff, opting to take a look around the room. His gaze met The Captain’s, and then Tony’s. Tony couldn’t help but smile when he saw the man give a small flinch. “So it’s true then. You guys are working together?”
Thor obeyed immediately, throwing a bag over the man’s head before fireman carrying him out of the room.
It was understandable, as the group of them stared down another, consisting of Fury, Hill, and a few other FBI agents he wasn’t acquainted with.
"I shall keep trying, Sir."
After a quick look to confirm no one else was in the elevator, she raced back over to Fury’s office, ripping the door open. Sam was grappling with Ward, the men trying to land a hit on the other. “You can’t win,” she heard Ward say. “HYDRA will always survive. Cut off one head, two more- ”
“Pietro,” he murmured. “This is the third time this year you’ve been sent to the office. You need to find a better outlet, kid.”
get off my best friend who, might I remind you, is laying in a hospital bed after being held captive for three months and is still recovering from collapsing in the sewers not just three days ago?”
“For whatever reason?” snapped Pierce.
Steve rolled his eyes, trying to play himself off as carefree. “Yes. Now go on, get your beauty rest.” Bucky patted him on the shoulder before walking out, finally leaving Steve alone.
Steve shuddered, thinking back to those toy soldiers. Happier times. Steve had always thought, ‘third time’s the charm’. He’d started his life over for a third time, taken a chance with The Commandos. He thought’s he’d finally found it. The colors that made him happy; the ones that made him a masterpiece.
“You own a speakeasy? Of course. Of course you own a speakeasy,” Clint said, rolling his eyes.
“Will you survive?”
“I would hold my tongue if I were you.”
“Here, I have something for you.” They were curled around each other, two halves making a whole that Tony was loathe to pull away from. But he knew he wasn’t going far, dipping out of bed long enough to pull the present from his pants before he was retreating back into Steve’s welcoming arms. Tony opened his palm, pressing the object into his grip.
to them. But the last time he and Obie had talked about The Commandos, Tony and The Captain were… less than friends. At least in the public eye.
“Steve,” Tony sighed, wanting to push more, but let it slide. Trying to get Steve to accept forgiveness was like talking to a brick wall.
Steve shook his head, his hand tracing Tony's beard. "I mean us. What is this? What are we doing here?"
First of all, thank you to everyone for such kind thoughts; they really meant a lot to me and always managed to put a smile on my face as I read them through the week. I am happy to report that I am in tip-top shape and ready for action! And when I say action, I mean doing what I always do, which is curl up in my snuggie and waste away on the internet.
“I can name thirteen other incidents that your description of ‘fine’ has landed you in the hospital.”
"And so can I. Don't worry about it Rhodey, I'll deal with it."
“We need Tony,” Rhodes replied.
Two silver bars for one vial.
“-right, Steve?”
“He’s not my friend,” Tony said on impulse. “Do you have a phone?” he asked, but the nurse had already walked back into the other room.
“Sam, hold on a second,” Barnes muttered, watching with disgusted fascination at Pepper kept reaching down his chest.
“No, no, no,” Tony started, shaking at Barnes’s shoulders. “What you need is to stay awake, okay? Help is coming I promise, just stay with me a little longer.”
He stuffed the items in his suit jacket, trying to think of a way out of the store when he saw it.
Barnes shrugged. “I’ll be fine if he’s fine. But I can’t protect a man who doesn’t want to be protected.”
He felt the jet touch down, and Steve’s shoulders slumped, the weight of the mission and journey home slipping away. Like with any other job they had, there was always a feeling of instant relief when they landed. A feeling of
Bucky stormed to the other side of the room. “Well, it sounds a lot more interesting that living in this prison!” he shot back at Steve. “You need to cool your jets, Steve. Just because I don’t want to hole myself up in some room all damn day doesn’t give you the right to be pissed at me.”
“Tony,” Steve said quietly. He couldn’t recognize his own voice. Tony said nothing. “We need to talk,” Steve continued.
Steve bit his bottom lip, thoughts trailing back to the news clips he’d watched earlier. A video of a funeral procession and a photo of a girl who would never smile again. “Yes,” he answered, finally. “I’m familiar.”
“Yep.”
“I’d like to think you’d make an exception for me,” Steve continued.
“So it’s true then? They’re back?” Dugan asked.
Suddenly, Rhodes groaned, his head falling against his chest. “Because it was a distraction.”
He’s supposed to be dead! I should’ve known this was your work, Cap. Who else do you have running around in here, Elvis?”
“Damn,” Natasha murmured.
Tony gave some sort of response, but Steve was already drifting. He felt a warm weight push through his hair, leaving too soon for his liking. Steve made some sort of noise and tried to follow the warmth, but it never came again.
Well, Tony was going to kill him anyway. Clint had accepted the fact that he was already on everyone’s shit list, and probably will be for all eternity. He hadn’t even called Laura yet. That was one conversation that he was not looking forward too.
This must be Anthony Stark.
Tony gave a small chuckle. “I couldn’t let you have all the fun.”
“I need to see that everyone’s okay,” Steve admitted.
Natasha curled up beside him. “I’m sorry,” she replied, reaching around him to get to his crotch.
“You we’re protecting yourself.”
Steve Rogers was a prize crop. He knew people, he knew things. The SSR held records on probably every different mob that was running through New York, probably even other major cities. And that’s not even getting started on their connections. The SSR had people all over the country, all over the
"If you say so. Who are they anyway?"
Tony opened his mouth, but no words escaped.
“You do understand that Nat’s killed someone with a stiletto, right?”
“You have to. You have to be the one to look after them now. Keep their noses clean and their heads down. Do it for the last wish of a free man.
He stomped into the kitchen, throwing the broken plate and ruined meal onto the island in front of him, his gaze returning to the newspaper.
But now, all he could focus on how quiet it was. There was no murmur of the TV, no glasses clinking, no comforting sounds and smells of guns being cleaned. He couldn’t hear the faint tones of jazz coming from Steve’s office. They were all gone now, off to face the beast of HYDRA.  He wanted to be there; he
"Given the poor clarity of the CCTV cameras, the shadows from the building, and the man’s distance from the cameras, I have been unable to construct a complete subject for facial recognition."
“Clint, you don’t have to do this,” Steve pleaded, walking up to the other man. “We can find another way.”
Stark grinned. "See? You're learning!"
Clint placed the aids in his ears, feeling his knees give out under him when he heard, well,
She chatted him up for a while, slowly inching closer to him. He deflected about work, but she felt him cracking under her. She would get that information.
Clint stilled. Delmar watched as he closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.
Fury gave a small nod. “Thanks, Coulson.”
“No. I don’t want to hear anything from you. Come on. I have a quinjet waiting.”
“No,” he moaned. “Oh God, please no.”
Steve Rogers knew that with each passing day, he learned more about Tony Stark. But if there was one thing that he knew for certain, was that the man loved to talk. Steve had seen him both start and finish a conversation himself before he could even get a single word in. It seemed to be his go-to no matter what mood he was in. A happy stream of babble when he was happy, awkward rambling when he was nervous, viscous barbs when he was angry.
Tony paused for a second, and Steve barely caught the quick flash of remorse dance over Tony’s face before it was gone, replaced by stone. “I can’t,” came the quiet reply, so quiet that Steve wasn’t sure it was meant for him to hear. With that, the helmet closed over Tony and he was gone, blasting off into the sky. People that had started to gather, drawn to arguments like moths to a flame, started to clamber around them, phone appearing to try and catch a picture of Iron Man in flight.
Rogers spun around to find Steve with a gun pressed to his head.
“It was your job to know! Funny how you’re the only one who survived. Maybe you were the mole. Got sick of taking orders, didn’t you? You wanted to be in charge; decided to take out the SSR yourself.”
for you to get home."
Tony hummed in agreement as he downed the rest of the water, placing the cup of the side table before he got a whiff of his clothes.  “Jesus,” he whispered, taking another smell. “You know, that sewer was rank. Why the hell do you even use it?”
“Clint?”
“You’re still here,” he murmured.
Steve watched as Thor walked up to Hammer’s man. “Now, I've been told that in your country, the saying is ‘do first, ask questions later’ is very popular. With that in mind, which one of your fingers do you like least?”
It was hard to even tell if he was still burning or not. The air on his face felt cool, but he could feel the fire still dancing in his veins, sizzling under his skin and shooting down his arm.
All Pierce needed to do was stir the pot a little more. His men would wait for The Captain to leave base, and then Pierce would blow it to smithereens. Some Commandos would be lost, of course, but all for a good cause. The Captain would blame it on Stark, bringing the two back to blows again. Then, all Pierce had to do was to sit back, let the two trade punches until they both slipped up, and he would come in for the kill.
This was all his fault.
Looking back up, Tony’s heart stopped. Across the sprawling lawn, he thought he saw someone over by the trees. Dropping his latest invention, Tony picked up his repulsor, and started to walk over to the back forest.
“A place that I kept telling you I didn’t want to go,” Steve groaned. “Thanks, Phil, you definitely saved me from that.”
Not that Steve would ever know.
“You got it, Cap.” He pulled away, Natasha quickly filling the empty space.
"Steve, I- "
“Th-the Captain,” Carl managed to choke out before a gun shot rang out, and Matthew Drumm found himself covered in his friend’s blood, the man falling limp in his arms.
Sam nodded. “He was just where you said he’d be. Bastard couldn’t resist not going after the SSR’s secrets. And don't worry,” he added, looking to Steve. "He didn't get a single thing."
“Ignore him, he’s been watching way too many cop shows,” said Steve.
“Nat, come on- ”
“Good man,” Tony beamed. “Come on, gang,” he continued, pulling on Steve’s arm as he led the group past Yinsen to the back of the shop. “The real fun’s through here.”
“Guarding the golden egg,” Zola answered with a slimy smile, gesturing the stacks of boxes around them. “Still so much information to go through. Our old employers were very diligent.”
“I’m sorry,” he choked out, his hands gripping Bucky so tight that he was sure he’d leave bruises.
“Wait, what?”
“Did you tell him anything?” Steve asked again, softly this time, eyes welling as they stared into Tony’s.
This was the beginning.
He could sit there and be furious about his current life, but it sure beat what he thought was going to happen. Steve and Tony, they’d gotten them all out, they’d gotten them all out
The Captain stomped over to Tony, puffing up his chest. Any weaker man probably would have wet his pants but Tony wasn’t buying it. “I don’t take orders from you,” hissed The Captain.
The steady beat of the heart monitor pierced through Steve’s ears. He looked across the bed, watching as Tony Stark flipped through the channels on the small hospital TV.
Steve finally peeled his eyes away from the wall, glancing over at the other man. He looked tired, but then again, they all were.
He’d sent out a list of everything he needed, pulling scraps and basically bullshit out his ass to get where they were today: an almost finished miniaturized arc reactor and a huge pile of crap that Tony had convinced everyone was the start of the Jericho missiles. “Keep taking this shit apart,” he said, gesturing to the pile of discontinued Stark weapons. “We’re going to need some of it soon. Besides, I don’t want our friends to think we’re slacking off.”
Steve smiled again, but a sharp rap at the door stopped him before he could reply. Without further permission, the door was opened by Natasha, the redhead leaning around the door, smiling mischievously as she caught them mid-embrace.
Tony had agreed. Steve had welcomed Pepper and Rhodey in, working tirelessly alongside them while Tony was in captivity. But to Steve, Obie was still an outsider. And with everything going on with HYDRA and now the Ten Rings, Tony was more than happy to hide their allegiance in the shadows. Keeping Obie in the dark was most likely the best way to keep him safe as well.
Natasha snorted, leaning back against the door and letting gravity take her weight until she slid to the floor. She shivered slightly, the coolness of the tiles bleeding through her thin tights, but she didn’t bother moving. Whatever silence Natasha was hoping to get was shattered by the sound of sneakers squeaking across the linoleum.
But, he knew that Obie was right. He needs to placate the board somehow –
“Claims,” he answered in a monotone voice. “Steve Rogers.”
There were a few mumbled answers. "HYDRA? There have been whispers about them," one said loudly enough.
“It wasn’t easy,” Steve said, ignoring Tony’s remarks. “But, I think we managed to get the best offer we could. I told Fury about the files and Tony’s promised to supply any information he collects from SI on Stane. In return, the FBI will use our intel to take them both down. Fury confirmed that it should be more than enough.”
Steve stepped into his office, relishing in the quiet before the door reopened for Clint and Bucky.
It's not that he didn't get it. From the pieces of relayed information he got from Bucky, the situation between Stark and Steve was a hell of a lot more complicated than what he first thought. Hell, if he were Stark, he probably wouldn't want anything to do with them either. Clint just had to hope that Stark was a better man than the rest of them, and would fly a white flag with his head held high. They definitely couldn't fight a war on both sides - they obviously couldn't even fight one on the one side. Bucky was right; they we're going to need Stark. Steve was out of control, the whole family was breaking apart. They'd all agreed that they could swallow their pride and crawl back to Stark - now, they were just hoping that he could do the same.
Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. He didn’t care. He absolutely did not care that Rogers was basically taking on a suicide mission. Nope. Not at all. “Good for him.”
“I guess so,” Tony answered, looking at Bucky for guidance. Bucky just nodded in confirmation.
Bucky nodded, agreeing, before turning to face Clint. “You got this?”
Of course he did. “Hard to forget,” Phil grit out.
the man responded, his mousy face giving a smile.
“Alright, no need to get sappy,” Tony admonished, shifting around on the mattress. “Hop to it, soldier,” he added, gesturing to Steve. “Let’s see what all the rage is about.”
“But that’s just it. The cops aren’t looking for him.”
“I fail to see how this is funny, son,” sneered The Captain.
“Think about it,” Bucky continued. “HYDRA was always one for playing dirty. Assuming Hammer is working for them, they tell him to leave a tip that a whole new shipment of his weapons is just sitting around for the taking. We catch wind of it, unable to resist free guns, they catch us in the act and boom. We’re all dead.”
Not a second later, the criminal’s car smashed into the front, the police car able to stop safety alongside it. The officers apprehended the men swiftly, the men too dazed from the crash to put up much of a fight. Making sure everyone else was standing clear, Steve hoisted the tree up a final time before returning it to its original position.
Tony woke slowly, his mind muddled by whatever drugs he had been given.
“It seems Stane’s plan didn’t have the ending we were hoping for,” mused Hammer. Maybe if he pushed Pierce in the right direction, he would just drop Stane and kill both him and Stark.
“Not me, per se.”
Drumm squinted. “Carl, that you?”
“What?” Tony interrupted. “How is it your fault? Was that what you were going to say?”
“By using my sources?”
Hill glanced nervously at the window, staring blankly at the bright day outside. “When you finally managed to get a lock on the third helicarrier, you….. well, you were late.”
Unless he didn’t want to piss the FBI off. Unless his family was still out there,
That thought made his pause for a moment, looking down at his hands. Did he want this? Here he was, sitting with the people that had, last month, aimed loaded guns at him at the very same table. Was he ready to break bread with them?
“What’s the situation over there?” asked Hill.
“I didn’t say that. It’s just,” Steve sighed, “nothing’s working. I can’t sit around and wait while HYDRA continues to destroy New York. I’m getting desperate; I need to protect the family I have left.”
“Looks like a high-tech glove to me, but what do I know. What I do know is that it gave Stark enough fire power to blast out of the sewers.”
The Captain's eyes widened. "I didn't squeal."
“No need. Just dropping by for a little reminder. I talked to your boss. You’ll be starting again next week. In the loading dock; no more sales for you.”
“Oh, and that’s supposed to make me feel better?” Bucky huffed. “I distinctly remember that fucker telling me how nicely my blood would stain on his floors.”
“He shouldn’t,” Tony replied. “I certainly didn’t tell him where it was.”
“AKA, you’re going to have a surprise house visit today by your handler, and we can’t afford to stick around,” Tony added.
Tony looked away, head dipping back down to his lap. Steve could see the other man bit down on his lip, so hard that the skin turned ashen white.
They exited through the restaurant’s entrance, Steve frowning at the darkened room. “Where’s Yinsen?” he asked.
He frowned, reaching for the picture that Stark was handing him.
Tony flopped against the mattress and looked up at Steve hovering over him, chest already heaving. Steve stared right back, blue eyes burning like the center of a flame. Strong hands trailed across his chest, and Tony could almost feel them twitching for a pad and paper to capture the scene forever. The movements were gentle against his skin, but Tony watched Steve’s muscles shift as he continued his path down Tony’s ribs, a clear reminder of how much power lay beneath the surface. To have Steve like this, to have him look at Tony like this – it was indescribable.

“And yet still so much smarter than you.”
Steve gave a small smile. “Steve Rogers.”
"I've been thinking about that, these last few weeks. On what I should do. How I should move forward."
Eventually Phil sagged, almost crumpling against Tony. Tony just tightened his arms, frowning at how quickly his hands were able to join on the other side of him, Tony basically engulfing the man. He was so small, so

“Don’t speak unless spoken too, do you understand? Hands above your head, like mine, alright? And don’t do anything stupid.”
Thor’s face turned grave. “I do not think you should interrupt him. He’s having a chat with Hammer.”
“Well, we can’t exactly leave,” argued Tony. “If The Commandos disappear, how long before Pierce and the rest of HYDRA run rampant through the rest of New York. We’re the only thing standing in their way. It doesn’t matter if we’re in over our head; we don’t exactly have a choice anymore.”
He was laying in bed, staring up at a too familiar ceiling when he heard it. At first, he thought it might have been a bug from outside, but he turned in time to catch the screen lit up. Bucky scrambled across the mattress, getting tangled in pillows and sheets as he reached for the phone.
It had been over a month since that day. Over a month since Tony died; since he failed. Over a month since Clint had been able to shut his eyes without hearing Steve’s screams.
And then suddenly, everything was coming back to him.
He reached into his jacket for the post it that was left in his mailbox today.
Yinsen’s voice sounded in his ear and Tony hit the deck, ducking right as a grenade launched right by his head. He could feel debris pierce his skin, but Tony barely had time to react before he snapped straight back up, facing Raza.

to you. They’re alive. I just got off the phone with Stark.”
“Shame about Maria,” Obie continued, almost sadly. “I really liked her.”
Clint couldn’t help himself. He swept Tony up into another hug, sighing in relief when Tony’s arms squeezed him back. “I’m still here, buddy. I’m not going anywhere.”
Walking up to the house, Steve opted to go through the rear. Steve slipped into the back door, closing it slowly, the lock clicking quietly behind him. When he turned, he was met only with the dark silence of the house. Creeping slowly on the tiles, Steve shucked off his jacket, walking towards the bedroom.
Steve stepped out of the car after the short drive, and into a closed down gas station. While Steve had originally thought that he would be meeting Loki at one of Asgard’s locations, he was surprised when Thor presented him with such a discrete spot. Apparently, Loki wasn’t in a very good standing with Thor’s father at the moment. He wasn’t in a very good standing with anyone, really. But right now that didn’t matter. If there was one thing Loki could get, it was results. And at this point, Steve would do just about anything to protect his crew.
“I don’t know, I don’t care!” Clint responded, getting hysterical. “He can’t be here. The cops are coming and they’re going to ask questions. He’s gonna do something stupid like get himself killed, or worse, get himself arrested.”
Steve shook his head. “I don’t think so. If HYDRA knows about the SSR files, I don’t think they’d have blabbed that information to everyone else. It’d be a bloodbath.”
“Don’t let her hear you call her that,” Tony mused. “She’s more useful that you think. Besides, I needed tiny hands, and I sure as hell wasn’t going to ask Romanoff.”
And of course, there was always part of him that prayed that maybe one day someone would see them, see the
“I-I don’t,” Steve started, but yet again, found himself lost for words. Tony couldn't be here, he
He’d curl up in the little nook he’d made for himself, leaning over the tall structure and watched. Looking down, Steve could see everything. Men in suits sprinting down the street to try and catch the bus. Mothers pulling their small children along the street to get to school. A man with a guitar singing broken notes to get enough money for a hot meal. A couple laughing as they entered the coffee shop down the road. A tired policeman waltzing along the curb as he scoped the road for parking violations.
Tony looked as Yinsen questioningly. “What do you mean?”
“We even said that we would help Steve bring them to the church,” Bucky added. “You know, like the good God-faring people that we are.”
He used some of his money to huge a sprawling flat, one with the huge view of the city.
Emily nodded enthusiastically, jogging over to where her dad was waiting, the brunette already gabbing about everything that she’d learned that week. Natasha chuckled at the dad who listened with amused attention, nodding at the exuberant explanations and rushed demonstrations. It reminded her so fiercely of Tony and Steve, the engineer talking a mile a minute while Steve just sat and hummed at the right time, staring at the other man with a lovesick expression on his face.
“Clint, the man has been monitoring us for weeks, mostly Steve. You should have seen him when he shoved the pictures in my face. Despite everything, Stark’s worried for Steve. I told him the only way Steve is going to find out about Loki’s double cross is if he tells the man himself.”
Giddiness bubbled in his cheat, Clint biting down hard on his lip to keep it from escaping. “Of course, you do. What’s not to love?”
Barton pulled him up from the chair and over to the door. “I don’t understand. They never mentioned you,” Loki continued. He and Pierce were no where close to friends, but they had a mutual respect for one another. But where Loki was illusive and vague, Pierce was narcissistic and proud. He couldn't help but boast about his achievements. How he had been the one to rise HYDRA back from its grave, and how he would be the one to finish Rogers off for good. But yet he hadn't mention anything about Barton. Something like this would have been their crown jewel.
“That’s the problem, Tony. It was rehearsed. I didn’t think people would have fallen for our act, that’s all. Catching you with real surprise seemed to have worked much better.”
“It means that the FBI is interested in what’s happening between The Commandos and HYDRA. And we know a lot more about it than Phil sure did.”
Hill and Sam shared a look, no doubt debating all the reasons why a trip to New York was a horrible idea. But Steve didn’t care. He wouldn’t care until he saw Tony standing in front of him. He wouldn’t care until he knew he didn’t fail.
Only to crash into The Captain’s chest.
Clint balled his hands into fists. “Why do you care?” he hissed venomously. “You obviously didn’t before.”
Everything was so impersonal. So detached. The ‘melting pot’ that was America was nothing more than a lunch tray now, with dividers separating everyone by their differences. Anything could be considered racist, hell even sexist, now. Someone was always offended, someone was always unsatisfied.
Steve furrowed his brow, praying to God he hadn’t missed an anniversary or something. “Is it?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You’re supposed to shake it, asshole!” Steve jumped at his tone, sticking him hand out to firmly meet Tony’s. His hands were callused, hard from labor, yet they were still gentle into Steve’s hand. “Tony. Tony Stark.”
“Not the time, Cap. The rest of Hammer’s men ran upstairs. We need to move.” Steve watched as Stark expertly changed clips, reloading both his and Steve’s gun with practiced ease. When Stark caught him watching, he responded. “What, didn’t think I knew how to hold a gun? My family company manufactures weapons; my father didn’t exactly give me Legos to play with growing up. Now, can we go?” Stark gestured to the stairway where gunfire had picked up again.
Steve pulled Tony against his chest, pushing his nose into Tony’s dark locks. “I don’t know. We’ll find him,” he promised, kissing Tony’s head.
