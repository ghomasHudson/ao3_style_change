"Hey, honey," Red Velvet said, turning her eyes to Steve. "Want to feel how smooth I am," she purred, taking his hand and slipping it under the robe, his palm resting over smooth, heated skin near the inner thigh area.
Morning was a whole different story.
"Thanks!" Steve beamed more, "I have to set up some details now, I will send photos to your phone of who to expect."
"Ladies and gentlemen," Loki's mellow voice announced through the speaker, "please welcome our first performer of the night, the sweetest cake in town, Miss Red Velvet."
Tony waved back and walked to the teenagers and patted his son on the shoulder on his way. He sat on the couch, just right between MJ and Ned. "So, how it is going?" he asked friendly, feeling that Steve could hand the Peter problem on his own.
Steve had an idea.
“Now let’s see where you are the most ticklish,” Tony hummed out, fingers wriggling in the air.
"Nah, man. It is all about the love you put into your baking," Sam replied, smiling gently and Steve was sure that that smile wasn't for him, but for the dough. "Mixers don't give love."
They would pay for this. Stone turned to the blond, still seeing a fist raised in his direction, while the brunet teenager had Hammer in the same position. "This isn't your business, get out of here!" he yelled out, curling his fists and throwing a punch at the blond. In a second, he was knocked out, landing in the mud, blinded by another punch.
“Oh,” Steve blinked, sitting down on the sofa.
"They released a new collection?!" Tony asked, widening his eyes in surprise. He usually was more up to date with the cosmetic market. Just like that, he found himself a new conversationalist for the game.
“Just remember to gently coat the skin, don’t work it in,” Tony said, showing on his face to which areas apply the mask. “Fifteen minutes is plenty of time to let it sit.”
Tony looked shyly at Steve, almost as if asking what happened and if it was all okay, and Steve pulled Tony more to himself and squeezed his shoulder, hoping to give his boyfriend some reassurance and smiled encouragingly. For him, everything went fine and he had a very promising feeling about this evening.
“You should,” Steve repeated, rolling on completely naked Tony and kissing his lips, “write on your,” a kiss on the chin, “Tumblr,” Steve finished, blowing a raspberry into Tony’s neck.
"I care! Just let me- just a bit- hold still!"
“That’s the one that doesn’t like me, right?” Steve squinted his eyes, pointing at the last comment. Tony laughed and nosed Steve’s cheek playfully.
"And this is yours," Tony walked to Steve, putting the bracelet out for Steve to take it. "So, what do you say? I know I kinda overstepped without consulting you first, but-"
Sarah laughed embarrassedly, something Steve inherited from her. "So, you noticed, huh?" she asked back, looking down at her knees with a small smile. "I am just trying something new."
"Um. Yeah, so?" Tony asked, sounding amused. He was always loud. Being quiet and being Tony Stark never went in pair.
"Son of-" Tony cursed, drawing away suddenly. "Sorry, Steve, I have to handle this!" he said, nearly running out of the office. "LOGAN! How is it going, my friend?"
"It is alright," Tony smiled, sitting on a swing in a playground in the nearby park, Steve next to him as they both were swaying gently. "For a moment it was rough, but dad started to finally listen to me and I shared with him some of my ideas. I think we will be okay," he said, trying to not sound too proud.
"Steve. Where the hell are you?" Tony asked, growing more and more worried. He heard enough of heartbreaking coming out stories and he would never live it down if Steve would become one of them.
"Only the best team this side of the globe!"
"Pleaaase?" Tony whined, putting his hands together in a pleading gesture, the pumps bumping into each other with a soft sound. "I need them for my nearest show and it will take ages before I break them in, with your shoe size it will just take a day-"
“Aren’t you full of surprises,” he purred out playfully and put the samples away. He added the rose lipstick into the basket and that made Steve feel a bit proud. Steve hoped that it would be the end for today, but Tony just trotted away to find more products.
"Buck, what are you doing here?" Steve asked, watching Bucky yawning and snatching a fluffy bun from the display, hearing Sam's hiss to not touch the bread.
That was Steve’s favorite thing. The way Tony’s whole face scrunched up, his body tried to fold in half, but with Steve holding him down, Tony could only laugh, his belly shaking with every touch.
"Hi, Kamala," Steve greeted the dark haired girl behind the counter. He took a deep breath, smelling all the frosting and sweet toppings and some earthy notes of a good, real bread. It was a special smell.
"Eat up," Tony encouraged, putting the tray in Steve's lap, while he sat beside him and leaned over Steve's shoulder.
"Better."
Sam nodded in understanding. “Maybe you should ask Tony to lend you one of his facial masks,” he added in a playful tone.
"Happy birthday, my Steve, happy birthday to you."
Maybe it was way, way worse.
“Okay!” Steve jumped off the sofa and trotted to the closet to get the box, careful to not knock anything over. He tapped his knuckles against the wooden door and it opened slightly.
"Ah! Ste-Steve! Ah-ah!"
"Aaah, I don't know," Steve said, awkwardly. He was happy for Sam, and anyone who found their calling in drag but wasn't sure if it was for him, even if Tony subtly tried to convince him to wear drag, even once. And well, he already wore high heels. And used facial masks. And waxed. Was that the next step? Just to see how it is to be 'on the other side'? "Maybe? But I am not getting married in a dress," Steve said quickly before anything could pop into his friend's mind.
“All of them, babe,” Steve assured, smiling broadly. He had remembered some of the things he read and gifs he saw, and could easily imagine Tony on the receiving end.
"Hi, honey! Did you miss me already?" Tony asked in a flirty tone, waiting for a reply that didn't come. "Uh… hello? Steve?" Tony tried again. There was some uneven breath on the other side, and before Tony could panic, Steve finally spoke in a hollow voice.
“That’s an overstatement,” Red Velvet scoffed, “I had coffee— wait, where are you going?” she asked, not understanding why Steve moved away when everything started to be so good and close and intimate.
Red Velvet frowned, and it was her gentle frown, the one that was practiced to not crease her face too much. "You know that I don't eat before performing."
Steve wasn’t exactly sure for what. For something secretive. Something he wanted to hide. Things he didn’t admit even to Steve.
Steve heard a voice and stared when he saw Bucky, standing in the doorway leading to the backspace. Hair ruffled from sleep, some smudged makeup under his eyes, and a spare set of white clothes, shirt, and pants, Sam used while baking, all crumpled. Comparing to Sam's work look, Bucky looked like a total mess.
"You are Bucky!" Steve continued to call, sure of it.
“Well, there was this one guy— but it doesn’t matter,” Tony waved him off, not wanting to dwell on the topic. “I need to get ready for the show. Later, Loki!” she said, taking Steve’s hand and walking with him along the corridor. Steve followed, still feeling the calculating look on his back.
Steve's mouth opened and he kept looking at the screen, long after the commercial was gone. He really felt proud of Tony. And he felt stupid, for crossing out this idea so quickly. He should had known that Tony had some sort of plan.
Steve listened to Tony's explanation, feeling that he got anxious for no good reason. He should trust Tony more and know that everything his husband did was for the greater good.
Tony didn't remember the last time when he was so afraid. He wasn't so afraid, even when Tiberius once had brought a knife to one of their 'dates', much to Killian’s and Hammer’s amusement and Tony’s terror, threatening to carve his initials on Tony’s skin, just to leave a reminder of who he belonged to. Just one of the many stories Tony had to share when it came to his ‘boyfriend’.
Tony's vision got black for a second when a painful and strong punch was aimed at his stomach. He doubled over, and Tiberius stepped away, letting Tony fall on his knees and into the mud, clutching his stomach.
Tony laughed. "Yeah, sorry. I will get cleaned right away, there actually is a bathroom with a shower behind my office, so-"
“Hm? Hi!” Red Velvet smiled at another male approaching them. Sturdy, middle built, with short dirty blond hair, a nose that looked like it might have taken a punch. Bright smile. Steve could swear he saw that smile somewhere.
“He is?” Loki raised an eyebrow, looking back at Tony. “Always craving attention, don’t you, Velvet?”
He closed his eyes, breathing in the invigorating smell of coffee and maple syrup. It was early afternoon, and he was sat in an unknown diner, at the counter, waiting.
And the whining was back on. Steve honestly expected that.
“Yeah, just try to work it in the skin.”
Red Velvet tilted her head to the side, looking at Steve in a soft way. “I guess you were not the only one who wanted this meeting to happen.”
Steve had to contain himself to not jump up from the couch and yell out in happiness. Instead, his smile grew bigger, finally feeling at ease with himself. Everything was out, no more secrets and his mom accepted all and each of them. It was an amazing feeling.
After that, they didn't say anything more and kept gently rocking on the swings. Steve knew that Tony's heart was broken and he needed time before he could invite anyone else in his world. Steve decided to be patient. Tony was worth the wait.
"Uh, my what?" Steve blinked owlishly hearing Tony asking him a question. Not Tony, Red Velvet. Somehow he missed the entire transformation process and saw Tony, all dolled up in red material, sitting in front of her makeup station. She was putting some sparkling earrings on and watched Steve in the mirror, her eyes shining with mischief.
"Well, the music was nap friendly."
‘Where are you? Are you dead?’
“Steve!”
"Tony, you did so much for me, I don't think I can ever thank you," Sarah said, putting her manicured hand on Tony's cheek and smiling warmly. She didn't mean only the makeover, but it also played a role, helping her feel comfortable in her skin once more. The biggest change was in Steve - she saw her son standing a little taller and prouder, flourishing thanks to the relationship he had with Tony. Of course, she would prefer both of them to be honest with her from a start, but after Steve had told her Tony's story, his background, his fears, and the rejection, she knew she couldn't ask of him to confide into, after all, a stranger. The perspective of building a good, trusting relationship from this moment, was good enough for her.
A sound of soft paws on the carpet, made Tony look through his fingers. Figaro, with his tail straight up, marched into the baby room, going to the source of the commotion, which was Peter. Even from the distance, Tony could see that their cat was angry.
Tony never had his coming out story, never finding the right time for such talk and then being robbed of that opportunity by a car accident that took both of his parents away. Sometimes he thought about how his coming out story would look like. In the worst-case scenario, his mom had burst into tears, wondering what did she do wrong, his dad exploding with rage and yelling that his only son can’t be gay and it all ended with disowning and forcing him to leave his family house. The best-case scenario wasn’t any better, as there his mom still ended disappointed and heartbroken, but calm enough to keep her raging husband away from him, and managing to find a safe place for Tony, somewhere where he could keep low until his father calmed down.
Steve paused, looking at the text message. From what he knew, Tony didn't have a show tonight.
Steve took the tablet and unlocked it, searching for the Twitter app. Letter T on a blue background. Steve pressed it and skimmed over the screen, looking at the design of the app. Huh, it looked very different from the account owner’s point of view. He scrolled down the screen, seeing a lot of text, too much text because wasn’t there a limit of signs per tweet? Further, into the app, Steve saw more of things he didn’t recognize, didn’t see any posts from other Avengers, instead of images and gifs and -
“If you keep asking, it takes the surprise factor AWAAHHAHA!” Tony’s newly found boost of confidence was efficiently cut off when Steve latched hands to his sides and squeezed repeatedly. Tony doubled over in laughter and squirmed away, watching with a pounding heart as Steve followed him, smiling beautifully mischievous. “No, no, no, wait, Steve! STEHEVE!” Tony screeched in laughter when Steve ran forward, pushing Tony on the bed, and falling with him. “ACK! STE - hahaha! Waaait!” Tony wailed when fingers were going up and down his body tickling intensely. When Tony became pink in the face and a little breathless, Steve stopped, leaning in and kissing Tony’s smiling lips.
In the end, Steve had to admit that home spa evenings were not so bad. And bath bombs were pretty amazing.
"Uhhh... Steve..."
"I should be mad, that was once my title. Without the cat part," Steve smirked.
The further they went, the surroundings changed. It wasn’t an empty corridor, but a place full of light and racks with clothes and mirrors and music seeping from rooms. Steve read the signs, such as ’accessories’, ’shoes’, but also names of the other queens working in the club.
"Yeah - eep," Tony made a high pitched sound, feeling fingers walking down his heel. Across the sole, and Tony had to bite a laugh down, and then fingers hooked around his ankle, dragging him on the bed. "Ah, Latrice, sorry, I gotta go, fiancé fever, you know how it is, stay fabulous, love you girl, byeeee!" Tony squeezed many words into the short moment, in which Steve pulled him close, surprising Tony with a long kiss.
Tony made a thoughtful face, his eyebrows drawing together until a small line appeared between them. “I didn't know that you know what Zoom is,” he said in all seriousness, but the humorous spark in his tired eyes gave away that he was joking. Steve grinned, puffing his chest out proudly. Tony liked to think he had to teach Steve about every modern piece of technology, but after being introduced to basics, Steve navigated himself pretty well.
"Ow," Tony hissed with a wide smile when Steve smacked his bottom for encouragement. "Kinky," he purred out, reaching for his clothes. Maybe Steve's day won't be so bad after all.
Waiting for Red Velvet.
"Hi!"
"BRAINS!"
"That's great, Tony," Steve smiled, feeling something warm in his chest. "I am proud of you," he said, not thinking that he might be crossing some line here.
The fourth and final time when Steve woke up was after 6 am, when it finally became orangish outside from the slowly rising sun. It was the most pleasant of all four times, and he woke up to a sweet smell and a warm baritone singing a song.
Somehow, Tony didn’t share the enthusiasm and just looked confused.
“Do you want to be ’America’s sweetheart' or 'The Evil Queen'?”
“Not the point,” Tony answered in an offended voice, but still made his way to Steve and sat on his lap, straddling the soldier. He put his head on Steve’s shoulder, efficiently blocking the way to the documents, just like a very stubborn cat. Steve allowed that and leaned to the back and wrapped hands around his husband, putting them at the small of Tony’s back. It was so comforting and they both took a deep breath, feeling as if it was the first one today.
And then Steve got on one knee in front of her and took a black velvet jewelry box out of his pocket.
Steve shook his head.
“I think it is great,” Tony smiled, really enjoying the meal.
“Feels good?”
“Bye, Sarah!” Tony said, waving to Steve’s mom with a smile, as she began to walk away.
“Sounds great,” Steve said, liking the fond tone of voice Tony was using. It had to be great memories.
Something didn’t add up.
"Back to the club. I have an evening show."
"Oh yeah, Logan will come soon to get his bike, right?"
Tony laughed wetly and almost hysterically. They all were. It just seemed like one of those nights that crying happened for very little reason.
"Wow," Tony leaned forward, both hands on the table, "so this is how it's going to be? Every man for himself?" Tony asked, meaning Steve's unwillingness to even let him have a sip.
"Steve, the heck - " Tony laughed, observing the ridiculous situation. It felt absurd, but Tony couldn't stop laughing.
"Oh good, you're here!" Red called, turning around for a second, just to see who it was. Steve had walked on Tony in the middle of his transformation, he already had a face full of makeup, except the lipstick, hair hidden under the cap and was changing his clothes, already tucked in and in pantyhose and clearly struggling with a bra. It wasn't the most glamorous part of being a drag queen, but the view of Tony's shapely legs in sheen pantyhose caused Steve's heart to do a little flip. "Can you clasp my bra?" Tony asked, turning his back to Steve, holding the strap in each hand.
"Yeah. Can you call Billy here on your way out?"
“Um, sure,” Steve said, not entirely sold on the idea, but not wanting to shot Tony’s idea down. “You call yourself Spare Parts Man, right?” Steve asked and Tony nodded. “Soooo… How about you call me Iron Man?”
It was an eventful day for the director. Parents were walking in and out, together with their children. Tony's mom was crying, seeing her son's bruises, and not understanding how she didn't notice anything earlier. Tony's dad was fuming, breaking the deal off with Viastone, no matter how much negotiating and diplomacy Stone's father tried to use, the contract was out of the question. And Tony was in the middle of all that, forced to say his story, again and again, missing classes and after talking with the school's psychiatrist getting a week off for self-care, and it was the minimum Tony's dad demanded before suing the school for neglect. In the end, Stone and Hammer were expelled, Killian was suspended, and Steve was told to not fight and let go, without the incident going into his permanent record.
Steve’s phone beeped and he left the room, glancing at his mobile and seeing a text message from Sam.
"Bucky and Steve were inseparable," Sarah explained, shaking her head in fond exasperation, "they constantly got into trouble together, but it was expected when you think about how they met! Want to tell the story?" Sarah asked her son.
"My little rebel," Red laughed fondly, taking a cotton pad and pouring some blue liquid on her face, starting her makeup routine. "I taught her how to walk, how to apply makeup, gave her her first cincher to hide her hog body---"
"What?" Steve smiled, lifting himself and leaning his back against the headrest. Tony, still in his night robe, was smiling with love at him, his face a bit tired, lit with the glow of the sunrise. Some claimed that no one looked good in orange, but Tony presented himself flawlessly, almost as some divine creature out of this world.
Steve stayed still, looking from his bracelet and back to Tony over and over again. There was no way Tony would make him a suit that would leave him half-naked, right? It had to be a joke. Something Tony did to let go off the tension. Surely, it was a joke.
"Just some guys day out."
Steve read the address, putting on his helmet and starting the bike, making it roar beautifully. Fortunately, it wasn't that far and in all their dating time, he never properly asked what was Tony's day job. It was another step in their relationship and Steve felt privileged to take it, learning a bit more about his boyfriend.
Steve tightened his jaws out of frustration. There were plenty of rumors surrounding the seemingly hottest couple in high school. Both Stark and Stone were handsome, incredibly smart, and came from wealthy families. They seemed like a match made in heaven.
"Thanks, babe," Steve rubbed his nose, trying to cease the tingly feeling. "Where did we stop?"
The crowd laughed at the unusual joke but used to Red Velvet’s type of humor. Steve would laugh too if he was in the crowd, but he knew that the words were directed to him, so he obediently sat in the chair and hid his phone away, hoping that Sam would do the same. After all, the show was on, and when Red Velvet started to sing it was as sweet as honey.
"Oh, never again, huh?" Tony asked, looking at Steve, his eyes sparkling in humor, accepting the invitation to play. They both needed that moment of silly closeness. "And how do you plan to do that?"
Steve considered himself a calm person. Not many things were able to make him mad.
Steve stopped writing. Did he hear right? “Um, sorry, fish?”
“Tony?” Steve whispered, aware that he might be wrong and if that was the case, he didn’t want to disturb the other’s sleep. “Are you wearing makeup?” he asked, recognizing the blush color Tony used as Red Velvet.
"Well, it is complicated… Sam didn't really have a choice," Steve said, scratching the back of his neck.
. That line never got old, especially during mealtime.
“You know, not all drag queens are homosexual. Some are bi, some are hetero, some are pan, some are ace. I like to think that everyone is welcomed in the drag community, no matter if being biological female or male. Not all agree with that though.”
It didn’t take long until Steve was satisfied with his job and threw the smudged covers away, getting off the layers of foundation, blushes, and highlighters. What was left, was Tony’s skin, natural and tanned and soft, showing some laugh lines and shadows under his eyes. The whole carefully planned look was gone and yet…
“Bye, ma,” Steve said quietly, feeling like hiding into the floor. When his mom mingled with the crowd, Tony slid his arm under Steve’s and urged him to walk.
"You are the worst best friend, you know that?"
"Good evening," Red Velvet kept smiling and the applause dimmed. Red took the microphone in her hand and started walking on the stage, her dress swiping over the floor. "I know you all noticed something different about me today," she said in a playful tone, getting a small laugh from the audience. "But this is not the end of surprises. First, I want to tell you a story. Some time ago, I met this guy," some suggestive whistling from the audience and Red winked, "this very special guy. One of a kind, but I am sure you already know this story, a guy meets a guy, they fall in love, yada yada yada," she rushed her own monologue, wanting to get to the gist faster. "And everything is great. Wonderful. And then… it happens. Just like that," she snapped her fingers, building the tension. "So I sadly inform you all, that this is one of my last performances as Miss Red Velvet," she said in a sorry tone, nodding her head sympathetically and rising a disappointed whine from the audience. Before the sad mood could start for good, she shook the sleeve on her left arm, letting it slide down and putting it out for everyone to see. "Because very soon I am gonna be Mrs. Red Velvet, I am engaged, bitches!" she shouted with a big smile, a gold ring with a row of diamonds shining on her finger.
“We would love to accompany you! Right, Steve?” still no answer. “I know he would,” Tony decided in Steve’s name and took Sarah’s basket, handing it to Steve. “Make yourself useful, huh?” he whispered to Steve, and the sore tone he used grounded Steve back. Feeling that he screwed up, he quietly padded after his mom and Tony, holding two baskets, Tony already hooking arms with his mom like if they were best friends, as they were discussing makeup and skin care, and Tony was charming and polite, and Steve acted like an idiot.
“Your skin will thank me later.”
There was some triumphant laughter, and Steve tried to locate the source, holding his gun high and ready.
Another moment of silence.
A closed door. His biggest enemy.
"It wasn't so bad."
“Do you want more?”
“Good to know,” he said, “thanks, Beth.”
"Glad you like it," Tony smiled, "I tried to give you a pedicure too, but you kept kicking me away whenever I touched your feet. As for someone who is such a heavy sleeper, you can get very squeamish when it comes to your feet."
"STEVE!"
Dammit, she was beautiful. He was beautiful. How could one person be so beautiful?
It would lead in one direction if a low sound didn’t interrupt them.
"It's all hand made," Tony said proudly, showing Steve that with a bit of skill, you could take off the suits, and after some brushing with palm, the fur on the plushie cat was standing all fluffy and tall, just like on real Figaro. Figaro watched curiously the whole process and pawed at Tony's wrist, demanding to be showed the thing, and nosed at the fake cat playfully.
"Ooooh, slap it on me! HAAAAAH!"
"Is this the joint my daughter performs at?!" Bianca del Rio shouted in her microphone in her characteristic loud voice, everyone clapping at her and confirming. "Good, because all those bars smell the same to me," more laughter when Bianca displayed some of her typical sarcastic humor, "and where is my lovely - DEAR GOD, Red, is that you?!" she bellowed out, looking at the stage and at still shocked Red Velvet, "what happened to you?! You look TERRIBLE!" she added, meaning the lack of her trademark color.
"Oh, hi!" Tony, flat on his stomach and on the top of the covers, wearing nothing except his short, silk robe, lay in the middle of the bed, swinging feet in the air, his phone pressed to his ear. He turned to Steve briefly, smiling sweetly. "Yeah, my fiancé just walked in," he said, addressing the person on the other side of the line, "yhm. Latrice says hi!"
"Why not?" Red Velvet asked, crossing her arms and looking a little defensive at Steve's quick refusal. He better chose his words carefully.
“I am sure, you know I don’t eat before the show,” he replied with a carefree smile.
And then it happened. The camera zoomed on them, showing Tony and Wanda in a pink pastel screen, little red hearts floating around them. Wanda laughed shyly, and Tony froze, his hand still on Steve's sleeve. There was a cheer, urging Tony and Wanda to kiss, and, after getting a confirming nod from Wanda, Tony did the friendly thing and kissed her puffed out cheek delicately. It wasn't what was expected from them, and the camera didn't leave them, urging to a proper kiss.
“He will take the pastrami sandwich. And give him a refill, please,” he turned back to the waitress, moving from the bar area and taking Steve’s wrist to guide him. Steve followed, completely stunned. Hips swaying. Round butt. There was no mistake.
"I said no, Tony!"
“Sure,” Tony finally said and motioned for Steve to follow him. “Just don’t write down all of my tricks, some things should remain a mystery.”
"You are not fine!" Tony decided, batting Steve off of him and pushing out of the bedroom, "Claritin is the kitchen cupboard, take it!" he ordered in a firm voice which was a total contrast to the half-naked torso and loose tie. Before Steve could react, Tony slammed the door shut, needing to air the room out first.
“If you are ready, we can start now.”
"I don't know, a year or two ago? I didn't know you still live in New York."
"Yes, ma'am," Steve nodded with a grin. Somethings don't change, no matter how old you get.
The first time he had opened his eyes was a few minutes after 4 am, so almost an hour earlier before his usual wake up time. It was a very subtle sound that woke him up and light movement following, covers pulling away from him, before held back, kept in place on purpose.
"It isn't important what we think, though," Arrow said, flipping a page in the magazine, "what is important is what you think. So?"
"So…" Tony started, sounding somehow timid. Steve looked at him because Tony rarely was timid. "You like doing that a lot, huh?"
Just as he and the girl were discussing the eye makeup collection, there was a honk, indicating that the first half of the match ended. Steve sat down heavily in his seat.
"I wonder what happened to Bucky. You lost touch after his family moved to Ohio, right?"
"What brings you here? Want to try our new creation?" Kamala motioned to the small plate next to her, where some small cookie pieces were waiting.
"Red!" Steve hissed, a blush covering his face and he looked at the door, almost expecting someone to hear that. Red Velvet smiled dedicatedly, but there was some shadow of the mischievous smile Tony had from time to time on her face.
“Any wishes for breakfast?” Steve asked, putting one hand behind his head and making himself more comfortable. Just a slow morning while he was holding a person he could proudly and loudly call his boyfriend. It was a good morning.
Oooh. So that was the offense.
"How's the score?"
“You are worth the wait.”
"Girls from the Olive, so, Tootsie and Arrow, my friend from a different drag queen bar, Lady Mint -"
"Huh," Tony mused out, not expecting that reaction. He always knew that Steve's ears were sensitive but that was new. New and cute. Somehow reminded him of how puppies react to ear scratches. He brushed his fingers again over the sensitive skin.
Tony groaned, scooting away from the finger, pushing himself further with one hand, the other one pressed protectively on his belly. “You’re mean!” he complained, voice shaking with giggles.
“Mhm. I guess that’s why,” Tony chuckled and fluttered his eyes in delight when the kiss ended. Steve only smiled cheekily, proving his point.
“I was just so confused, I don’t know when I even found myself outside your building. I think I just got overwhelmed with it all.”
"You know, baby, I didn't know there was so much heat hidden in you," Tony purred, moving closer to the blond, and putting his lips to the other's ear. Maybe they could find some private corner and -
"Bucky!" Steve called suddenly.
"Yeah, it is," Steve agreed, moving his thumb along the lower part of Tony's spine, very gently and Tony hummed delightedly, a small, hitched-out laugh escaping now and then from the light tickle. It was nice. Tony was a lovely, warm weight on top of him, his softer belly was pressed to Steve's muscled one and it was a great contrast. The gentle touch continued, until small, regular puffs of air on his chest and the rhythmic, calm way in which Tony's belly was moving, told Steve that he fell to sleep, lulled in by the warmth. Steve smiled, continuing to brush his fingers over his husband’s back, letting him sleep as long as he needed.
Steve knew. He really knew. And he wanted everyone else to know it too.
“Oh, I would almost forget,” she suddenly said, taking a small jar in her hand. “It is better to apply them before the lashes. If you are grossed out by someone touching their eyeballs, I would advise you to look away,” she looked into the mirror and at Steve, who shook his head. He wanted to see the whole process. “As you wish,” Red Velvet grinned cheekily, pulling her eyelids wide open. A few quick moves later, and brown eyes disappeared, blue irises taking over their place. Some glue, some mascara and a pair of fake eyelashes later Red Velvet was looking at Steve.
"Oh my God, Pete, come on, it is okay, it is okay, little bee," Tony repeated frantically, pacing around the baby room, holding his and Steve's almost one-year-old son in his arm. Peter, red-faced and screaming, kept crying bloody murder, big tears rolling down his cute, chubby cheeks. For some reason, whenever Tony heard Peter crying, he immediately started to tear up too, and Tony looked like an absolute mess - he was ruffled from sleep that had been brutally interrupted by the piercing cries, eyes circled and wet and shiny and a frantic, panicked look in them.
"Don't worry, I will leave you this one," Steve said, pointing to the cigarette Tony already had been holding, "for goodbye. And tomorrow I am buying you a nicotine gum."
"Don't forget about her back!" Red Velvet called, grinning broadly. Arrow flipped her sister off and it was met only with a giggle.
One of the things Steve learned in the 21st century was that being late was in fashion, and Steve had a very good reason to be late.
One person noticed…
It was petty, Tony knew it was and that it won't change anything. "Fuck you," he ground out, his voice breaking with a sob, but eyes giving away his true feelings. There was so much anger in the brown eyes, a blazing flame, mixing with contempt, showing in the way Tony’s mouth twisted. Maybe once, there was something good between him and Stone, but it was all fake. Just a sugar coating, hiding what a rotten person Stone really was.
Tony took out one pump and ran his fingers over the shiny surface, and Steve saw the red sole of the boot. Then he took out the other one and held both of them in one hand.
"- freeze," Tony stared in shock as Steve sucked the whole tall glass of cold milkshake, basically on his own. With a satisfied smile, Steve sat straight, the straw dangling from his mouth.
“Come on, we have like forty-five minutes to get back before I have to put the facial masks in the fridge. Now when I think about it, we actually don’t have the time to eat, maybe takeaway?”
The upcoming days at school were not calm. It all started the next morning, when Tony was getting out his books, when a red-faced Bucky jumped to him, looking frantic.
“Okay,” Steve agreed, turning his eyes to many pairs of shoes and dresses, of course, red. Then, in the corner on a mannequin, he noticed something that made him blush from head to toes. It was a breastplate. Silicone, milky in color with raspberry red nipples. Red Velvet’s bosom. He would probably remain stunned if it wasn’t a buzzing sound of an electric shaver that made him peek out from the closet.
It was as happy as it could be, and Steve and Red were getting lost in each other when the final person and a very late guest showed up.
"It is a good spot. Comfy," Tony replied, rubbing Steve's cheeks playfully before letting go. He patted his lap back, urging Steve to lay down again. Steve's eyes followed the movement, and then he slid his gaze up, all over the expensive suit and white shirt with undone top buttons, no sight of the tie, his gaze heating up. Such a waste. It all could very well lead in one direction if it wasn't for a question burning in the back of his head.
Peter just stood there, not understanding. He could hear his dad, talking to MJ and Ned, and he felt that if Steve would lecture him in front of his friends, MJ would never allow him to forget about this.
"Mrs. Rogers?"
"Why?" Steve asked.
Everyone started clapping to welcome the performer, but it was nothing in comparison to how rapidly Steve’s heart started beating. Through the silver curtains showed a hand, and pushed the fabric open, letting it drape a bit over herself, and prolonging the moment. When the person walked out and to the middle of the stage accompanied by applause, Steve had to try hard to not stand up and start whistling.
"Ah, my daughter!" Tony called playfully, coming out of the kitchen and joining them. "Air kisses!" he said and him and still laughing Bucky leaned closer to each other, smooching the air around their cheeks with an exaggerated 'muah' sounds. "I think you can take them off now, Steve," Tony said, turning to his boyfriend.
"THE HELL ARE YA DOIN'?!" Steve suddenly sprung up, waving his arms wildly and Tony had to duck to avoid a hit. Okay, maybe it wasn't the right time. Steve clearly was deep in the game mode, and no matter how hard Tony tried, he couldn't reach half of the level of enthusiasm Steve was showing. He decided to occupy himself in a different way and scanned the crowd. He didn't have to look far, as the person on his left attracted his attention. It was a girl, looking as bored as Tony felt, sitting next to a guy around her age with silver hair (kids those days) and a dark goatee, who just like Steve was yelling at the poor players. But what really attracted Tony attention was the red blush on girl's cheek. It was matt finish, with some reddish brown tint to it. It would look perfect on him. The girl noticed him staring and turned in his direction, smiling insecurely.
The door of his locker was slammed with a loud bang, as soon as he managed to get his books out. Dammit. Too slow. He held back a shudder when an arm wrapped around his shoulders, hot breath on his face.
Tootsie made a confused face. "What?"
"Oh, you want me to do more?" Steve asked, and somehow Tony didn't like the tone of his husband's voice. The bathroom door opened wider, and Steve stood in it, holding his phone up and snapping a photo.
“It is?” Steve asked, looking confused at Tony.
"Tony!" Steve bit back a laugh, scolding his husband.
Steve took off his shoes and washed his hands, before preparing breakfast. Something simple and tasty, so he sliced some fruit and put on the platter, preparing the eggs and milk mixture for the French toasts. He sliced some thick pieces of the soft brioche, wanting it to soak nicely, but before that, he would have to call Tony over, so the brioche won't fall apart. Steve entered the bedroom, seeing Tony in the exact same position, still going on and on on the phone, not even noticing him.
“Where?”
"Stay where you are," Tony ordered, ending the connection. He didn't care to change and only wrapped a coat around himself and slipped bare feet into a pair of sneakers, not wanting to waste any time. He grabbed his keys and his phone, just in case, and ran down the stairs, ignoring the elevator and finding it too slow in such an urgent situation.
The guy smiled. It was a wider smile than the one he used to see on Red Velvet’s face, showing some laugh lines. Maybe that’s why Red Velvet’s smile was subtler.
What was stopping him? This time the feeling of moist, red lips against his was replaced with cold, pale hands with long fingers, and the imaginary pain of snapping his arm in two.
"He was always of smaller posture," Sarah said in a warm, motherly voice that showed how concerned she was for her son back then, "he got sick almost all the time. It was because he was such a picky eater! Nothing ever tasted right to him, he just wanted to eat white bread and cheese and ketchup."
"Come on, Pete! If you knock Steve down, I will triple your allowance!" Tony called with a huge grin, Ned and MJ cheering for Peter to do it.
It was a moronic move on his part and he still couldn’t believe that he did that. Scratch that, he couldn’t believe that Red Velvet actually agreed to meet with him. He closed his eyes going back once more to that moment.
"HYP!" Tony jumped when Steve used his thumb and index finger to knead around the middle of his stomach, catching the skin with light pinches. "HEHEHEY!"
"Huh? Why?" Red asked, genuinely surprised. She thought Steve was enjoying himself. "Are you still worried we will put you in drag? Don't worry, we won't-"
After the question, Steve looked at his boyfriend. At his unruly hair and dirty face and did Tony always had such muscled forearms and overall had a very nicely muscled body?
Peter froze. It couldn't be… He slowly turned around, a cold shiver running all over him in panic.
"It is a great idea, Tony," Steve smiled, really meaning it, accepting the bracelet. The wonderful thing was that Tony, probably expecting some kind of protest from the captain of the team, looked surprised for a split of second, before smiling back.
"Daddy will be out soon!" Tony repeated without a second of hesitation. Figaro sat his fluffy butt down under the door and when it seemed like a success, he meowed deeper and longer and resumed scratching.
“I wrote a new song and would love to share it with you all,” she said in her smooth, velvety voice, and Steve felt like melting. The crowd around him started to disappear and blend into the background. It was now only him and Red Velvet.
"Steheve!" Tony giggled, his giggles getting lost when time after time Steve pressed kisses to his smiling lips and then some more kisses to the bump, lulling Tony and their baby into a calm sleep. And in the morning, Steve would love them both all over again.
Steve laughed, wrapping his arm around Tony's waist and guiding him into the kitchen. "Jealous? Let’s go eat, you must be starving."
"No can do, Cap," Tony teased, using Steve's nickname playfully, just as if to show that Steve might be the Captain of the Avengers team, but Tony was the one in charge right now. "You fell in love with me being loud," Tony hummed, putting one leg over Steve's hips and moving to the center. "You married me being loud," he continued to list, leaning in closer, hands braced on the covers on each side of Steve's head, their lips almost touching. "And you fuck me loud," Tony whispered hotly, pressing his lips over Steve's, initiating another kiss, one that Steve could feel deep in his throat and sending a nice tingle down his body.
“I am serious, babe,” Steve tried again, gently poking his finger all over Tony’s bare belly, making him squeak funnily and curl up, “write on your Tumblr. Everyone has to be worried.”
It wasn’t a long distance between the kitchen and the bedroom, but with every step, Tony’s mind was bringing out numerous stories he heard in the past, ones that didn’t have a happy ending until many years later or even at all. Just would Steve have enough of will power to wait until that point?
’, whatever that meant. Steve tried to search for the text he saw on the previous page, but couldn’t find it anymore, instead saw more posts, where people seemed to be interacting with the author.
That was a reasonable explanation. Steve nodded, knowing that there was more to his friend than just the outer layer, of a seemingly tough guy who grew up in a problematic neighborhood. Sam loved to bake good, honest bread but also had a knack for decorating cupcakes and cookies making them look like something from a fairy tale land. It was a good name for him.
"You should go back to sleep."
"Oh, they were. You just need to know how to navigate through the crowd," Pietro said, red licorice already hanging off the corner of his mouth. No one even noticed when he reached for it. "Hi!" Pietro grinned, noticing both men looking at him. "I am Pietro. Wanda's older brother."
“Do what?” Steve asked innocently, planting himself more firmly and trapping his boyfriend, knowing he needed some extra support for what was about to happen. “This?” He asked, his thumb finding Tony’s outie belly button and gently rubbing over the sticking out bit of skin.
It was a brief, tense moment, and Sarah narrowed her blue eyes before her face relaxed. "Ah, you boys and your secrets," she said in a fond reprimand, "it is okay, Stevie, you can say gay bar - "
"Rest a bit, okay?" Steve said, kissing Tony's nape lovingly, as he moved away to discard the used condom and fix the covers around them.
"Woah, slow down or you will get a brain - "
“You’re welcome,” Steve said happily, already knowing that Tony appreciated that, but it was nice to hear him say the words. “Just for the record, you would be happier to see me than pizza, right?”
"Sup," the guy turned to Steve briefly and Steve raised his hand in hello. Wow. It was fascinating how such a bulky guy could transform his body into a perfect hourglass figure. That had to require a lot of padding. He also had strong facial features and a stubble, but makeup had turned his face into a rounder, softer one. Dark, shoulder-length hair which was usually hidden under frilly, big wigs. "Mom, aloe, okay?! I am dying!" she urged Red Velvet in a playful whine.
Tony really didn’t understand. No yelling, no screaming, no crying. Unless… Tony looked at Steve, guilt, and confusion written all over his face.
"Ah ah ah… Woah, that was intense. Thanks."
Steve smiled in apology. “It wasn’t easy, but I never expected it to be so. And ma - she was shocked, for sure, but she said that it doesn’t change who I am and she just wants me happy and - Tony?”
"Sounds good," Tony smiled, taking the unlit cigarette out of his mouth and standing on his toes to kiss Steve for goodbye. Their lips met in a quick kiss, but something else also took place during the short moment.
"Uhmm…" Tony just looked back at Sarah, unsure how to react. Subtly, he turned to Steve, looking for help and Steve had to hold back to not start laughing at his boyfriend's panic.
"Are you done talking?" Steve asked into the kiss.
Sarah didn't say anything. She frowned deeper, perfectly groomed eyebrows furrowing, eyes framed with dark long lashes narrowing, lips contoured and colored with a coral lipstick thinning. All the changes in her face where thanks to Tony, who guided her in the makeup and skincare world. Steve felt that the calculating look wasn't any longer pointed at Tony, but at him and his blue eyes met with his mother's. There was some confusion in his mom's eyes and a silent question if Steve was okay with all of this. Slowly, Steve smiled at his mom, hoping to communicate his thoughts properly - he was accepting every aspect of Tony, both his male and female side and couldn't imagine his life without Tony in it any longer. Sarah didn't have to approve of it, but it wouldn't change Steve's mind. No matter what, he was staying with Tony.
"Uh, but could you instead - " Tony said shyly, moving his head up and whispering something in Steve's ear, feeling too embarrassed to say it out loud.
"But that's a pity, right?" Mint jumped in, grabbing Rhodey by the arm. "He would make such a pretty girl!"
Steve only blinked.
"Um, hi," Steve smiled back, turning to the guy. "I am actually looking for Tony."
"Thanks," Steve replied meekly.
"Uh. I am not feeling well."
The rest of the vacation wasn't so calm anymore, but it definitely was interesting.
“We are good,” Tony assured, still not believing that everything turned out so great.
"How did you even reach it?! It is like your arms can stretch, I swear---"
"Hey Fig," Steve smiled, making room for Figaro, who tried to get to Steve's lap. Steve picked him up and lifted high in the air, looking at him. "So, you're an Avenger now, huh?" he asked, smiling at the new collar the cat had, blue, with a white print of '
Well, Steve couldn’t argue with this logic.
The answer should be obvious. Just Tony took a second too long to answer when he thought about the divine combo of melted mozzarella and spicy pepperoni on a thin crust. “Well - ack!” Tony yelped, suddenly knocked down on the couch, yelp changing into laughter when hands latched to his sides and quick fingers kneaded the soft skin. “AH! Waitwait hahahaa! I dihihihidn’t say anythihihing!”
“Yeah,” Tony shrugged, not considering it a big deal. “I understand. Really.”
No more secrets.
"Calm down, we have plenty of time!" Kamala said, taking the tray and putting it aside. "If you want to get it done, help me too," she said, pushing a cupcake holder box in his hands to fold.
"How can you tell if you never tried it before?"
Steve's finger slipped in with ease, Tony already stretched and slicked from his cock. He pushed in deeper, angling his finger and pressing on the tight walls.
"Um, not really, I just have some favor to ask," Steve smiled shyly, scratching the back of his head. "I will have some guests coming today, could you make sure they get to my usual table?"
"Thanks, ma," Steve smiled, taking his fork and watching his mom reaching her hand for his empty soup plate. "Please, ma. Leave it, I will clean later. Sit with me for a while."
Steve counted in his mind and when the time came, he put his hand through the silver material and waved, only for a split of a second, hoping that the rest of the crowd focusing on Red Velvet, didn’t spot him
"Sure, will drop to your place after I settle things at work," Tony said, taking a pack of cigarettes out of the inside pocket in his jacket and put one in his mouth.
(I know that drag daughters don't call their drag moms 'mom', but I thought it was a fun addition)
"Hm," Red Velvet looked at Steve, and she smacked her lips together delicately. "It… Is actually really good," she said, smiling in surprise. "Really good," she said, offering the rest of the cupcake to Steve, and Steve did the playful thing and took a bite of the cupcake while she still was holding it. Moist cake, a bit salty frosting. Sam did it again. "Good, right?" Red asked, and Steve gave an approving hum. "I thought your friend is miserable in his job, but his cakes don't taste like that."
Coming out was never easy and everyone felt ready in different stages of their lives. Tony knew young people, sure of themselves and who they were even before puberty had started, he knew people in their late seventies, allowing themselves to be who they were just now, after years spent on lying to themselves. And maybe Steve wasn’t ready yet. Kissing in public wasn’t the same as telling your loved ones the deeply hidden truth. And Tony felt so guilty, scolding himself for ever allowing Sarah to get close to him, beating himself up for the day, when he had heard someone calling his name on the street and saw Steve’s mom. He could have pretended he didn’t hear her. He could have turned away and mingled in the crowd on the busy street, disappearing from her sight. Instead, he had smiled and walked to Sarah, starting a conversation, that lead to phone numbers exchange and semi-regular contact. But most importantly, he could have told Steve. Steve, who had became paralyzed this one time his mom saw them together, Steve, who had got his tongue twisted out of fear of his mom connecting the dots. Steve, who he loved so much and never wanted to hurt him. Yet, here he was, standing in front of his bedroom, holding a jug and a mug, afraid to take the final step and see the mess he had made out of Steve’s life.
“Nah, not today. I will change in the bathroom, I don’t want you to see the next part.”
Dark bruises on his ribs and around hips. A bite mark near the waistline. Scratched shoulders and arms.
“Are you coming?”
"Fine," Steve agreed, taking his boyfriend's jacket and offering it to him. "If that is another beauty kind of talk, I have plenty of that back home."
Tony had been working a lot, slept a little and finally, it had to gain on him. He just hoped he won't get a bruise on his forehead because that wouldn't be an attractive look for the annual Avengers and friends Christmas party. Festive food, gleaming decorations, and the biggest Christmas tree they could fit into the Avengers conference room. Tony was looking forward to those few days of comfort.
"You think that Peter will be mad that we are crashing his Halloween party?" Steve asked, watching Tony rolling his eyes.
Steve watched in the reflection, as Red Velvet combed her hair to the back as much as possible and then used bobby pins to keep some strands in place. Then she took out a black, small net and stretched it, pulling it over her head.
"Captain."
Well…
"Watch your words, kid!"
"Dad, it is my science project, I know you want to help, but let me decide -"
"No," Tony replied after a while, getting even closer, so close, that Steve moved his hand to put on Tony's hip instead, drawing him into himself. "Just maybe not in front of the whole basketball team," Tony added, sounding timid again.
"Hah!" Tony shivered when Steve's hands moved to his back and pulled him closer, hands reaching down and resting on the round butt cheeks. "Oh? What are you planning?" Tony asked with a smile, and Steve didn't answer, just grinned back and let his hands do the talking.
Bianca shook her head in reprimand, but smiled in the end, her cheek dimples showing again. "Your lovely boyfriend invited me here! He can be a persistent one," she said, gesturing at Steve. Red whipped her head and stared at Steve in shock and he smiled sheepishly. Reaching Bianca wasn't easy, but he wanted all of Tony's friends to share this moment with him. "I guess he is not your boyfriend any longer though! So, just let me congratulate you both and I am just gonna sit quietly here and enjoy the show," she added, turning her voice down, pointing at the table where Sarah, Sam, Rhodey and Lady Mint were sitting at, Thor already putting another chair for her, between Sarah and Lady Mint. "Thank you, darling!" she smiled at Thor and turned to the people at the table. "Hi, I am Bianca del Rio," she reached her hand to greet everyone, "you must be Steve's mom?" she said looking at Sarah, who seemed stunned but pleased, not really understanding everything that was going around her, but delighted to be a part of it, "kids grow up so fast, right?" she sniffled exaggeratedly and sat down.
Steve groaned and rubbed his forehead. In minutes, Red would be called to the stage and Steve would have to scurry to the audience, taking his seat next to Sam at their usual table. The timing was wrong, but he knew he wouldn't be able to enjoy the show, without getting it out from his system.
"I like him," Red finally said, "a lot. I think I really like him."
“Actually,” Tony hesitated, rubbing at his shorter goatee. The skin itched a little bit after hours of being covered in latex. “I was thinking that maybe tonight I will take you to my place? Maybe we could spend the weekend together,” he added, suddenly sounding shy.
Figaro follows Tony around, but there are some moments Tony prefers to be alone.
And maybe visit one or two jewelry stores.
"Hey, come here," Tony demanded, not liking the sudden empty and cold feeling. When Steve leaned back in, Tony lifted his head and turned to the side, locking their lips in a kiss. Long and needy, lips overlapping and tongues rubbing against each other, lasting and lasting, because who needed to breathe anyway.
"Well, I didn't want someone else to swoop in and take you away from me," Steve teased, brushing his cheek over the top of Tony's head. He smelled like the soap used in the paintball place bathroom, which was a rather neutral smell, but there was some very Tony scent lingering. "People should know that such a pretty thing like you is taken."
"You have a daughter?!" Steve asked, his eyes wide as saucers. Wasn't that kind of an information he should know from the start?
“Mmmmhm,” Steve hummed, holding Red Velvet around the narrow waist, their lips pressed together. Somehow, the lipstick didn’t feel sticky at all and Red smelled and tasted delicious and Steve never wanted to let her go.
“Got some masculinity to prove there, pal?” Steve asked happily, just because he sometimes liked to tease his friend. Part of the being best friends deal.
"Tony and I started drag at the same time. The drag community was much smaller back then, all performers knew each other," Mint answered with a polite smile.
"Uh oh… Well, I didn't have time to eat breakfast so…"
"Sure I would," Steve confirmed with a smile. He had such visions many times, long before he and Tony started dating.
"I am in front of your building."
"I don't know. Maybe next time... you can try to be less loud?" Steve said carefully, mentally preparing himself for a hurt outburst of emotions, and being surprised when none came. Instead, Tony huffed out a laugh and lifted himself from the covers.
“Ready for your first bath bomb bath?” Tony asked excitedly.
"Mm? What's up, babe?"
Reluctantly, Tony did so. There was still a blush on his face and Steve was sure, it wasn’t makeup this time. A whole lot of insecurities in the brown eyes. This was so much different from when Tony was Red Velvet. Poised and strong and confident. And Steve loved them both. He wanted to be there for Tony in his strongest moments and his most vulnerable. All the time.
Steve gets the courage to ask Red Velvet to meet with him and finally sees the man under all that makeup.
"AH!" Tony yelled out when two hands shot under his arms and wriggled fingers into the, of course, smooth armpits, tickling viciously. "Stoop!" he managed to choke out before frantic laughter started to spill out. "You whihihiiill give mehehehee wrinklehehehes!"
"Uh, your engagement party went on and on, and by the time it finished, I was too tired to get to my own place, so Sam allowed me to crash on the couch in his bakery," Bucky explained in a bread obscured hum.
Steve shivered again, half expecting a severed head to roll out from a corner any second.
"Stop what?" Tony asked innocently, pressing the long stripe of material to Steve's back and smoothing over the sticky substance. Oh God, it almost started.
Steve and Tony make another big step in their relationship and Steve starts to understand that Tony is the only one for him and plans the biggest step of all.
"I decided that we didn't have enough of romance in the past Valentine's days and decided to make up for it," Tony said, sashaying over to Steve, his hips doing some magic movements. To cut the sugar down, Tony chose to wear a simple, black suit, that made him stand out nicely.
“I need to trim my beard,” she replied, putting on the trimming end of the electric shaver. “Then I cover what remains with a thin layer of latex and blend it all with makeup.”
"Fan of the Black Panthers?"
"Tony, let Peter make his own mistakes," Steve decided in a firm tone.
"Babe? You awake?" Steve asked, peeking into the bedroom, still holding the bag with bread in his hands.
“Ummm…” Steve looked away, curling in himself. “I— I think I need a minute,” he meeped out, giving off embarrassed vibes.
Sam waved the baguette in warning at this friend but smiled back. It wasn't something he ever imagined himself doing, but overall it was a fun experience. Maybe Parfait would appear in the Pitted Olive from time to time. Steve enjoyed seeing Sam like that, more opened and relaxed, the previous tension gone. Getting in touch with his female side did a great thing for Sam.
"Ah, ma! One more thing!" Steve interrupted this time, taking a step forward and standing next to his boyfriend. He took a deep breath and smiled, wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulders. "Ma, this is Tony - my boyfriend."
Tony already felt sick. He didn't want to make it worse and shook his head.
Tony’s lips twitched into a little smile. “Alright, thanks. So, I guess I will see you around? I hope you will let me know before the interview will be posted, I’d like to take a look at it before printing.”
“Ma?!” he gasped, suddenly finding himself in a new situation, one that had written DANGER all over.
“Thank you!” a hand snatched the box and the door closed again. Steve only blinked, noticing the pale arm and red nails belonging to Red Velvet, and not Tony’s tanned one.
"Yeah, I had a feeling you might want one," Sam nodded, turning to the shelves and taking off a perfectly baked brioche, light and fluffy, gold and shiny, and put it in a paper bag. "I have fresh baguettes too, will pack you a one. Anything else?"
“Steve,” Sam warned.
"I just can."
"Good, good," Sam smiled, taking a seat next to her and Sarah kept smiling, hearing that that deeply hidden tensed note that had always been in Sam's voice whenever he talked about his work was gone. Just like if something got unblocked in him. "Mrs. Rogers, what are you doing here?" Sam asked, not understanding.
“H-hey!” Steve giggled when Tony rubbed his stubble over the tender skin on his neck. It was a bit prickly, even if Tony used a special blend of oils to keep his facial hair smooth and healthy, but Steve’s neck was also really sensitive and soon laughter started pouring out of him. “Toohohony!”
"You have a private chauffeur who drives you to school, right?" he asked Tony, and the brunet confirmed with a nod. The chauffeur didn't pick him up after school, as it was well known that Tony spent afternoons with his 'boyfriend'. Steve felt sick just from thinking about this. "After the last lesson wait for me in your class. If I won't be able to make it for some reason, Bucky will come for you. Never leave school alone."
Steve snorted. Was that what Tony thought Steve wanted in his life? Sure, Steve could picture himself as a husband and a father, but it was way too early for that discussion. Having a dog was a different story.
And so Tony told Steve something he never said to anyone. Tony was from a business family, just like Stone was, everyone knew that. What was a secret, was that Stark Industries and Viastone planned to merge into one company to take over the market and wipe out any other competitors. His dad was about to sign a contract with the owner of Viastone, Stone's dad, and Tony had to do everything to keep good relations with Tiberius, otherwise, the deal might not happen and that would leave his family in trouble. And at the beginning, Tiberius wasn't so bad. Tony wouldn't say that he loved him, heck, he wasn't sure if he even liked him, but he was sweet and attentive and maybe with time Tony would learn to love him - until he turned manipulative and aggressive. And Tony didn't know how to end this to not jeopardize his family's company, so he suffered in silence, waiting for the day Tiberius would go off to college and their 'relationship' could break because of the long distance. He thought he had everything figured out, but then Steve had to interfere.
' and on the t-shirt was a cartoon print of Figaro, wearing Captain America's headpiece.
Steve bit his lip, his thoughts spiraling deeper and deeper. His dream woman would remain a dream. But… underneath all that makeup was a regular person. Oh, the irony. He had to listen to his own advice after all.
They both sat on the facing sides of the table in a booth, and the guy kept looking at Steve. The same sort of amusement he knew so well.
Tony groaned and hid his face into Figaro's happily purring form. To show love and support, Figaro brushed his face against Tony's forehead, gently head butting him. "Thanks, buddy," Tony said, imagining that the photo of Iron Man, sitting on a can, with pajama bottoms around his ankles and a lap full of a fluffy cat would become an instant Internet hit. Lucky for him, Steve decided to save him shame and kept the photo private, and by private, he meant himself and the Avengers group chat.
Feeling a nervous twist in his stomach, Tony peeked into the bedroom, just to feel if the situation was as bad as he feared. Steve was on the bed, forehead creased in thought, and was looking at the space in front of him until he spotted Tony from the corner of his eyes.
Breakfast could wait. Tony could call back. But their life as an engaged couple started right now and it was a moment Steve didn't want to share with anyone. Only him, Tony and Red Velvet.
It was great. It was sweaty and hot. It was... so loud.
Steve felt like the air was punched out of him and stared in shock at his boyfriend. This wasn't a part of the plan. Steve was perfectly aware that Tony's night job would be discussed sooner or later, but he had no idea his boyfriend would bring it up so soon. By the way, color drained off Tony's face, Steve could read that Tony didn't plan it either, it just slipped.
"Is Tony alright?" Steve asked, just needing to be sure.
The shop wasn’t big, yet Steve felt like it was enormous. He lost count of time and felt that his back and feet started to ache, and the strong smells were starting to irritate him. He considered asking Tony if he could wait outside, but he didn’t want to spoil the moment. It was just really getting hard for him.
Hence, Steve was encouraged to take a plunge into the world of social media.
Steve gets the courage to ask Tony a very important question,  all in a style worthy of his drag queen! Sam takes a new step in his life, friends gather and someone special makes an appearance.
And then it hit him.
Steve’s knee was bouncing in nervous excitement, not following the rhythm of the music seeping in the background, just pure nervousness dictating the rhythm. He had to be careful to not bash his leg on the underside of the table and cause the drinks to spill all over the red cloth. It wasn’t his first visit to the bar. In fact, since the first time he stepped into The Olive, as regulars used to call it, he became a steady customer. A steady customer with a very good reason to keep coming back. A very good, embarrassing reason.
"I said hold still!"
“No, please!” Tony giggled, kicking his legs, trying to wriggle away, as Steve’s menacingly moving fingers were getting closer and closer. “I cahahahan’t!”
"Hi, Billy," Steve smiled at the boy.
"Maybe," Tony said groggily, taking a deep breath. "Uh, Steve... Could you -"
"Good," Red replied with a smile, moving away, "because I am a little sore. It is not easy getting a full body wax."
"And what after I give birth?" Tony asked in a sad whisper, saying something that was bothering him for a while, but he never found the courage to say out loud. His body would change. Would Steve's love for him change too? "Will you find me attractive after?"
REUPLOADED - sorry, guys! something went wrong and this chapter got cut off in half! fixed now!
There were some grunting and huffing and sounds of a tape being stretched. Steve didn’t want to think about the details and tried focusing on something else. Just think of something else. He fidgeted on the couch, not able to get a very vivid image out of his head, one that made him feel ashamed. It was for the best that Red Velvet couldn’t see him, he had a feeling she would figure him out right away.
Steve laughed quietly, wrapping Tony tighter in his arms and smiling brightly. "No, you don't," Steve cheerfully refused the request, not keen on denying himself the pleasure of seeing Tony Stark struggling to keep his mouth shut.
"Actually, it is a drag queen bar," Tony said unexpectedly.
Red Velvet blinked and then noticed the strategic placement of the pillow. “Um, okay,” she coughed, trying to hide the smile. That was flattering in an odd way. “When you will be ready, you can stay at the backstage. You won’t see me, but you will still hear me sing.”
Someone called but Steve and Red already walked away from the chaos, Red watching Steve taking his jacket.
"Hey, ma," Steve said, taking a piece of the tender beef and mushroom on his fork and into his mouth. "You look different."
“Am I gay?” Red Velvet asked, walking behind a four-panel room divider, for a change, in black color. Steve’s face burnt a little at the forward question, he asked for in the first place.
"I need to tell you something," Steve continued, trying to keep the trembling out of his voice. Now or never.
"Hey," Sam smiled a toothy smile when Steve walked into Momma's Little Bakery. It was as pink and frilly as always, but Sam seemed much more relaxed, busing at the counter and stacking freshly made buns and cookies for the early customers, already in his white and pristine work clothes. "How are you feeling?"
“So… what do you want to know?”
“Hey, wanna go shopping with me later?” Tony asked, finishing his omelet. It was a fluffy heaven and Tony loved Steve for adding some chopped ham into it. Delicious.
Looking enthusiastic, Tony got to writing. Soon, Steve got up and leaned over Tony’s shoulder, looking at the screen.
"Yeah, looks good," Steve smiled gratefully, "thanks, babe. Does it mean I get to style your hair now?"
“Sure,” Steve lied, standing up. They said their goodbyes and he watched Tony leave, just to see him as Red Velvet this evening. Or…
"Tony!" Steve gasped when many days later he saw the brunet at the school gate. With a relief, Steve noticed that Tony looked much better. He wasn't slouching and his face had a healthy color and there was some beginning of sparkle in his eyes, something Steve didn't see before. "What are you doing here?" he asked, trotting to the teen.
"Aaah, it is good to feel smooth again!" Red walked out, stretching in her small, gold robe. "See you next month, Nat."
"But-"
"It will be fine, babe," Steve said in a low, comforting voice. It felt like he had repeated those words over one hundred times already, but he could understand and sympathize with Tony's nervousness. Tony was always so confident and full of bravado, and there was something incredibly sweet in seeing him so vulnerable. Or more, in allowing himself to be so vulnerable in front of Steve. No mask, no filters, just Tony.
“Steve! Keep up, please! We have a lot of things to buy!”
Tiberius just smiled in a more wicked way, enjoying the show. "Maybe later. And maybe this time I will give you to Hammer to play with. I recall he had a good time with you. Right, Hammer?"
"Hi! Nice to meet you," he said politely, trying to mask his confusion. When Tony managed to make a friend?
"Aw, babe," Steve cooed, looking at the contents of the tray and letting out a short, loud laugh. Freshly squeezed orange juice in a tall glass, a bright sunflower for decoration and a stack of steaming, fluffy pancakes, decorated with whipped cream and red, white and blue sprinkles, and fresh berries and a small American flag stuck on top. A truly patriotic breakfast on the 4th of July.  That explained the burnt smell from earlier and why Friday tried to keep him in bed. All to not spoil Tony's surprise.
Somehow Tony being a cat person didn't surprise Steve at all. Even with his goatee and groomed appearance he resembled a cat.
Steve just smiled, not seeing a connection why photos of a pair of kids in dungarees and with bruised faces could be so harmful.
It should be the ending statement.
"Let him go," someone ordered in a harsh voice.
Steve stopped laughing. “Now that’s just alarming.”
Sam just frowned deeper and for a moment, Steve sensed the tension in the air. He almost backed away, knowing that it was better to give his friend plenty of time to process, when it was Sam who first loosened up and lowered his shoulders, seemingly accepting what he heard.
"Braains," Steve muttered out in a hollow voice.
If Steve had to point out which piece of furniture he hated the most, it would be a couch.
It was supposed to be comforting, but something in the tone of Tony’s voice didn’t seem right.
"Uhm," Steve cocked his head to the side, temporarily distracted by Tony's gently narrowed waist and bubble butt. He really didn't need much padding with such curves. "A bit?" he answered, smiling sheepishly, seeing at least five blooming purple marks on brunet's back.
so, after over a month, here is part two. still a work in progress, but for sure there will be more chapters and I hope to keep it updated monthly. comments and kudos are welcomed and needed! ps. a cookie for a person who will guess who Tony's drag mom is :D
"I didn't ask for your help!" Tony yelled more, almost falling back into the mud. He felt so overwhelmed. He didn't want anyone to get into trouble because of him. He was fine with suffering alone.
"It is Buck!" Steve called, motioning for Bucky to come in and taking steps back, the clicking sound drawing Bucky's attention to his feet.
Steve laughed, wrestling Tony down and pinning his hands once again. If Tony was already getting this worked up, there was no way Steve would back up.
Then he heard a '
Tony whistled, but obediently walked to the bathroom. “You know, if I was wearing a dress, you wouldn’t use that tone towards me!” he yelled, reminding Steve of their first meeting outside the club. Steve was too stunned back then and it was no opening line to call someone out on smoking, but after almost a month of dating, he felt he earned the right.
"That's all I am asking," Red hummed, putting a headband on her head and reaching for the white foundation.
"Told your mom wha-" Tony's voice got stuck when he realized what Steve meant. Sarah was a sweet lady, but hearing that your child was gay was probably never easy, even for the most loving parents. Tony really feared what he might hear next. "Oh, sweetheart…" he started in a voice so compassionate, the only answer he heard was a chocked out sob, Steve tried to hold in. "What happened?" Tony asked, not hearing the answer, just the sound of a car zooming past. "Wait… Steve, where are you?"
"Aw, I missed you too - " Tony's voice stopped when instead of the anticipated kiss, Steve dropped on his knees and held Tony around thighs, burying his face into Tony's stomach. "What the - Steheheve!" Tony giggled when Steve's nose brushed all over the soft material of his shirt.
"Come on, let's go eat," Steve decided, smelling the pizza and feeling hungry. He let Tony go first and followed him. He was honest, and he really didn't like bullies. It was one of the reasons. The second reason was, that he liked the teen in front of him a whole lot more than he would like to admit to.
And he would end alone because Steve definitely was going to dump him.
The previous amusement immediately disappeared from Clint's face. He stared at Steve, eyes wide open in shock and at loss of words.
"Okay, stop, stop," Tony giggled, batting on Steve's hands when the touch turned more ticklish than soothing. He turned around and wrapped hands around his boyfriend's neck, standing on his toes and smiling.
Steve heard some hidden sadness behind those words. “Did you ever have problems because of your orientation?”
“Do what?”
“What?” she asked, stopping the kisses, cheeks flushed as she looked at Steve with glazed eyes. She did sound a little irritated, as if not believing that Steve was spoiling the moment for both of them.
Tony invites Steve more into his world and suddenly someone from Steve’s life makes an appearance.
Steve looked at the man, recognizing the voice from the intercom. It was a tall male, pale and with dark hair slicked to the back. He was wearing a dark suit, just like the blond bouncer in front of the club and eyed Steve with a hostile look.
"Oh. Did you eat something that could cause it?"
"Hmph," Steve huffed, when Tony moved away, straightening up with a self-satisfied grin and the tip of the pink tongue peeking out to lick at the corner of the upper lip. Back straight, relaxed belly and a smile that made Steve feel weak. A very tempting sight. "I am gonna buy you a gag ball," Steve joked, smiling back at his husbands, and holding to Tony's wonderful hips as Tony started to gently roll his pelvis.
"Steve, catch him!" Tony called, watching Figaro getting ready to jump into the crib. As for such a huge cat, Figaro was very gracious and easily jumped between Steve's hands, softly landing on the mattress next to screaming Peter. At first, Peter didn't notice the cat, but then Peter's brown, wet eyes met with Figaro's vivid green ones, and the full-blown crying slowly dimmed down into whimpers once again. Figaro didn't move, just looked at the baby, having some silent conversation. Steve watched cautiously, ready to interfere at any moment. Figaro wasn't an aggressive cat, but who knew if he wouldn't suddenly lash out. Tony ran to the crib, standing next to Steve and watching the situation unfold with a rapidly beating heart.
"Yeah, I remember," Tony said, resuming the washing.
“Mmmm, it’s when you can tell people’s sexual orientation. It is an intuitive thing, but we are mostly correct.”
“So, what does your gay radar say about me?” Steve asked, trying to focus on something else, then bare, tempting skin.
"What? Why?" Steve closed his book, frowning at the words. It wasn't like Tony to complain that he felt sick. Usually, Tony popped some pills and got back to whatever he was doing, claiming that he was too busy to feel sick. It showed in the way he had been standing in front of Steve, with a long face and hunched over, clearly out of his place.
“What, you waiting for a tip?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows.
“It is good contouring and a good bra,” she replied, squeezing her arms closer and pronouncing the cleavage. “See? All me.”
"Are you asking because you want me to…?" Steve didn't finish. Her smile was enough to confirm that thought. In less than a second, Steve was off the chair. "Oh no, no, no," he said quickly, walking backward and seemingly terrified. "No way. I am not wearing drag."
Looking back at his life, Steve would say that being in the army and a soldier was the easy part. He had orders, people to protect, he followed the orders, he saved people. Simple. Maybe sometimes it was brutal, some decisions more painful, but the goal was always clear.
Tony listened to the story, smiling warmly, his fingers positioned delicately at the edge of the photo. He was looking at a photo of two boys - both in dirty clothes and with red, swollen eyes, clearly from crying and stubborn looks on their faces. The dark-haired boy had a split, bruised lip, the blond boy a black eye. Bucky and Steve. His drag daughter and his boyfriend. Tony couldn't stop smiling.
Steve smiled crookedly, putting his hands on other man's hips and pushing him closer. Holding Tony in his arms did get some of the sting out from the previous offense. "You will like it. We will eat something now."
Steve smiled, remembering the song. It was mellow and more carefree than what usually Tony sang. Steve wouldn’t dare to say that it had a cheerful and subtle country note, but it reminded him a bit of that.
"I don't-" Tony planned to deny, but then he heard his own high pitched voice. "Oh God, I do," he said, sounding defeated and lowered his voice down to his warm baritone, leaning his forehead over Steve's arm.
“Okay!” Steve called, way too enthusiastic than he planned to and left some bills on the table, gaining on the brunet, his heart pounding with excitement.
"Hello. Can I help you?" a guy with a friendly smile approached Steve. He was dark skinned and medium built, in orange coverall. He was wiping his hands with some cloth, leaving car grease stains on the material.
"Family business?"
"What the hell is that?!" Steve shrilled, pointing a shaking finger at the bathtub. In the water, in soap suds, was floating an ominous mass of black hair, tangling and curling around each other, the bottom of the bathtub almost entirely covered.
"SON OF A -!"
“Don’t let his appearance fool you, I saw Loki breaking a man’s arm. Snapped it like a twig,” Tony said in a light tone, treating the story as an anecdote. Somehow it sent a cold shiver down Steve’s spine.
“I love you, babe,” Steve whispered, looking at his lover.
Watching Tony change into Red Velvet was a weird experience. Steve kept as quiet as he could, not wanting to disrupt the process, and taking it all in. He couldn’t help but stare in confusion as Red Velvet applied glue to her eyebrows, covered the trimmed goatee, and put a white foundation all over her face and down to the neck, hiding the tan. Then many layers of concealers and fluids, her face covered in stripes and dots. It looked better after blending with a pink tear shaped sponge and then, even more, makeup followed, bronzers and highlights, giving a softer shape and bringing out a female facial structure. The most mesmerizing part was the eye makeup. Black, sleek eyebrows. A perfect, dark cat eye, as Red Velvet used many brushes to blend and blend, creating a smoky look.
I think it was a bit risky to write this moment, but I tried to do it justice and respect the topic. hope you will like this chapter, if you do, remember to leave comments and kudos! happier moments will appear in the next chapter!
"No, it hurts!"
"Just Thor will be enough. I wish you a nice evening, ma'am," Thor smiled gallantly and went to resume his position in front of the club.
"Aw, you two are such frat boys, it is adorable," Red Velvet smiled. "But don't you have somewhere to be?" she said, looking directly at Tootsie.
"Hey, Red, do you have some aloe? I think Nat burned some of my skin," a male walked in, right past Steve on the couch, rubbing his armpit with a scowl.
“Heck yeah.”
"Please? You are closer to the door," Tony reasoned and while it was true, Steve grunted again, knowing that his boyfriend just wanted to torment him more. Dragging one foot at a time and walking in slow, wobbly steps, Steve had made it to the door, just in time as the person on the other side started to rattle on the doorknob impatiently.
"Um, yeah."
"Oh, and this was from one of the scariest days in my life!" Sarah said, pointing at one photo. Tony's eyes immediately followed there and widened when he recognized who was in the photo if he wasn't mistaken. "Steve, you remember this, right?"
"This isn't funny, Steve!"
"Hey, ma!"
"Hey, Steve," the blond bodyguard of the Pitted Olive smiled friendly at him. "Coming from the front today?"
"You can trust me on this one. Everything is fine."
Of course, when Steve seemed to pay attention to him, he still was just thinking about Tony's stomach.
Steve leaned to the front, grinning at the two rascals. "Oh, yeah, it's from the day I met Bucky."
"I honestly didn't know that. Why don't you use a stand mixer?"
“A drag queen? Yeah, he knows. We had this talk when I once wanted to wear an orange dress and he tried to talk me out of it. The whole joke is that, that he looks great in orange, just doesn’t know it,” Tony laughed, making sure that the road behind them was clear before he drove out of the parking and into the street.
"Hey, guys!" Bucky called from downstairs and Tony jumped nervously, wary of loud noises. Was it one more thing, Stone made him afraid of? "Pizza straight from the oven! Frozen. But I put extra cheese on it, should be good!"
Sarah followed the bouncer, feeling a little overwhelmed. The interior of the night bar was cozy, with nice, wooden furniture and subtly lit, giving a private, comfortable feeling.
"I am out," Steve said without any hesitation, wriggling out of the covers and standing up.
He was hiding half of his life. No more hiding.
Tony was running straight into the director's office having a very painful story to tell.
"Wish I could say the same about you, but there is an awfully lot of clothes on you for me to be sure," Tony breathed out. Steve wouldn't call a t-shirt and jeans a lot of clothes, but the message was well received. Their lips finally met, slow and passionate, and they stumbled together, falling on the, of course, rose petals covered bed, making them fly everywhere. Greedy fingers went into motion, peeling clothes of each other, lips wanting more and more -
"AH! Oh fu- yeah, like that, like that-"
Just get to the class. Get to the class and don't look back. He would be safe there.
