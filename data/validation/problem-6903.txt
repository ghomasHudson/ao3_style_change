“Please, Gamora,” Tony begged, slightly jutting his bottom lip out in a pout, “I fell asleep like a dead weight and my alarm didn’t work for some reason. The teach won’t even tell me if I ask him at this point, c’mon pleaseee–”
“Easy for you to say,” Clint said, his laughter still apparent. He wiped the corners of his eyes with the tips of his fingers, “You’re practically one of the most disciplined people I know.”
Bucky Barnes did a quick glance of the field with his eyes, double checking to see if Tony and his friends had left to the locker rooms inside the school building to change into their P.E uniforms.
Tony remembered changing Peter’s contact name to a moniker he coined for him. Underoos suited him quite well.
“God, I haven’t played that in ages,” Tony replied, proceeding to take a seat, “Are we stripping in this version cause it’s fucking cold out here.”
“Bruce, I can handle it. I call them and they come clean up the mess,” He replied, knowing what he was about to say, “And we have homework to catch up on, cause god knows we didn’t finish all of it.”
Once Tony was in his very short boxers, he hugged his chest with his arms. His form immediately shivering.
“If I pulled half the shit Stark pulls, I’d probably be in jail right now, if expulsion wasn’t enough,” Quentin retorted. He pressed on his electric screw gun a couple of times, carefully spacing the nails out on the dry wall, “Privilege, I tell you. It’s the reason why he gets to do this as “punishment” instead of having to move his annoying ass to another school.”
Despite his initial protests of not wanting to sleep, he was tired. His screwed-up sleeping schedule easily caught up to him and his bad mood just elevated his exhaustion.
After about fifteen minutes, Darcy stepped down a ladder she was on before heading over to where Tony and Steve were.
“Make sure the questions are super embarrassing. This one here looks like he hasn’t done anything too obscene, but you’d be surprised,” Tony said, nudging Rhodey on the arm.
“Yeah, I guess,” Tony could only say, “I’ll cook you guys up a fattening breakfast. It’s the most I can do right now.”
Tony stirred a few times before opening his eyes. He grimaced and clutched his head in pain as the harsh sunlight invaded his eyes. He furrowed his brows before shutting them back closed. His throbbing headache was persistent. He didn’t dare to move one bit; the pain was too much for him to bear. Of all the times Tony had thrown and been to parties, he had never drank so much at one before, now that he thought about it.
And he wasn’t disappointed at all. The more people, the merrier. If anything, it meant that the normally unoccupied rooms – there were many of those – would be put to good use for the night.
Steve begrudgingly closed his fridge and grabbed his coat. He was going to order takeout, lots of it. He was too tired and lazy to cook something from what little they had.
Tony turned around from his crouched down position, cellphone in both hands. He resisted the urge to let out a sigh when he realized the voice belonged to the timid yet overzealous Peter Parker. Tony stood up, leaning his side against his locker. He noticed that the hallways had cleared out, everyone else ready to go home for the weekend, just as he was.
“Sorry,” The other plainly said, placing his hands over top of each other between his knees. His posture was slightly relaxed.
Quentin’s mouth practically twisted into a snarl. Tony’s scathing tone, especially when he butchered his name didn’t sit too well with him, apparently.
“These are all of the referrals, detentions, the times you’ve skipped detentions, plus the single suspension you’ve gotten, since the school year started.”
Afterwards, all that Tony would have on his mind was his meticulous plan for what was to come tomorrow. He really needed to unwind. He wasn’t going to let a couple of pink detention slips get in the way of it and he wasn’t going to let it bite him in the ass.
“Like what? Getting blackout drunk with your friends? Vacationing over the weekends? Spending all day locked up in your lab?”
know what we’re getting straight into today, right? If not, we start installing the drywall panels onto the walls. Finally, huh?”
“…Good point,” Bruce replied, he saw the pained, hungover state of Tony, “You shouldn’t have drank so much.”
“We’ve been too easy on you, Tony,” His mother, Maria, spoke for the first time since he arrived. She was completely upset, it was as if she was almost on the verge of crying with a tinge of anger mixed in. Tony had never seen her so disappointed before and he didn’t like it one bit. “And we can’t keep going on like this, not anymore. We need to do better.”
“Okay, that’ll do,” Darcy said, she then beckoned Tony and the other two to join them, “Come on, you guys!”
Tony briefly pursed his lips to the side. He could tell that Steve was trying to keep it together, for the love of all things good and holy. This was probably a nightmare for him, but it wasn’t like Tony chose to do this.
“Wow, Quill really outdid himself this time, huh?” Clint said, eyeing the dried, high quality cannabis between his thumb and index fingers.
“Yes, the device you’re holding in your right hand,” Coulson as-matter-of-factly said, eyes on the iPhone Tony was protectively clutching, “There’s a no-cellphone policy in this program.”
“My neighbors aren’t the most social types,” Tony said, he stifled an irritated sigh while he stared at Clint’s doubled over position. Instead, he gave the blonde an annoyed side-eye, “I’m glad I could make some of you laugh.”
“Holy smokes. Has P.E already started?” Clint said, shooting upwards from his laying position and peeking outside from the corner of the bleachers.
“I think I’m too drunk to care,” Tony replied, now leaning against Rhodey, “Someone walk me with me. It wouldn’t make sense for me to be alone, y’know.”
The first one was for his persistent tardiness to school and the second was for his "conduct" in class. Apparently his “attitude towards the teacher” was what earned him that one, whatever that meant. He was just asking an honest question, wasn’t he?
“But I wasn’t even on school grounds when that happened!” Tony retorted, his leg rapidly bouncing, “You can’t punish me for something that happened outside of school.”
“Of course not! It’s just a little excessive. I have important things to do outside of school, y’know?”
“What? I’m taking the dare to new heights,” Tony said, his nonchalance heightened by his drunkenness.
Tony was able to get the hang of it quickly. He built things all of the time and used all sorts of power tools such as the ones the volunteers used to screw in the dry wall.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony sighed, sinking down in his seat, “It’s just…I’m not looking forward to working with Steve Rogers of all people. Four entire hours with him. I don’t think it’s possible for me to work with someone so uptight, boring, and up their own ass.”
“I did it cause I wanted to,” Tony interrupted, purposely stopping the boy from drifting into one of his endless rambles.
“It isn’t?” Tony said. He figured it wasn’t. The fact that he was called to Fury’s office and his parents being here clued him in pretty quickly. His heartrate was noticeably quicker. He tried to keep his voice neutral, cool, whatever, “…What am I here for then?”
“I’m sure she’ll have a good time, just cause she gets to spend some time with you. You’re one of the most kind-hearted people I know.”
Steve gave the other a pinched expression. The bitter exasperation in Tony’s one-worded response just irked him for some reason.
“Get ready guys, Tony’s about to put on his tinfoil hat,” Natasha said, walking alongside Bruce. The two made sure to keep up with Clint and Tony’s rapid footsteps. The crowds within the school hallways were ever so congested, making it a headache to navigate through. Students either loitered around, catching up with their friends in between classes, some would fetch extra supplies from their lockers for their next class, and others like Tony and his three best friends were starting their lunch period.
“Ms. Garrett is out to get me. It’s all some part of her calculated scheme to get me kicked out of this school,” The moment their second period class ended, Tony began his tirade, “Notice how it’s five detentions before you get a referral and once you get three referrals in one semester, you get expelled. These two slips add up to my fourth detention after getting two referrals. She’s counting down my days here as we speak...”
Steve’s jaw only twitched before he looked away from Tony and focused his attention on his friends again. He didn’t want to fall for the bait, not again.
Before Tony could say anything, he felt an object hit him square in the face. He briefly glared at Steve before eyeing the uniform that was thrown at him. It was a standard orange vest with a couple of yellow stripes strewn across it. They came with a pair of dark, durable work pants.
Once he regained his composure, he turned around, ready to head to the room he was told to go to. Instead, his phone vibrated. He fished it out of his pocket, almost staring fondly at the screen as he received a new text from Peter Parker.
Tony’s momentary happiness was immediately whisked away the moment he placed his phone back in his pocket.
After a good 15 minutes, he flipped over, lying on his back before pulling his phone out of his pocket. It was the first time he’d check it since Coulson confiscated it.  He got a text from Natasha, one from his mother, and a few from his group chat with Bruce, Clint, and Nat. Those were only among the many though. He decided to check Natasha’s first.
At that text, Tony hesitated, his fingers hovering over the touchscreen keyboard. Tony never saw it that way, he never considered himself “noble”. Or was the guilt he was carrying actually make that true?
Darcy cleared her throat, rather loudly, to put a stop to all of the side conversations everyone else was having around the bonfire.
He wiped his mouth and flushed the toilet before catching his breath and leaning against the wall. Tony walked– crawled, rather, outside of the bathroom. Before leaving his bedroom, he saw Clint, Natasha, and Bruce in the room. Clint slept on the other edge of his ginormous bed while Bruce and Natasha slept on separate sleeping bags. He must have let them sleepover with him, after everyone else had left.
“Oh, good, great,” Coulson was clearly relieved, “I wish I could be the one to do it, but I have a lot on my plate today. The construction manager is giving me a detailed rundown on things that are supposed to happen after winter break.”
Once the classroom was devoid of the other students, it was just the three of them alone. Tony was right next to Steve and the tense environment around them was never more apparent. The air around him felt thick and suffocating. This was pretty humiliating; this wasn’t how he wanted things turn out. Partnering up with uptight Steve Rogers was the last thing he wanted right now.
“Yup,” Tony popped the p, his attention faraway and inattentive. He absently but lightly swung his legs from the desk as they barely reached the floor. All he was thinking about right now was what time he’d get home, “I work on projects at home all the time; robots, engines, solar powered devices, all sorts of gadgets.”
Then again, Tony should have seen this whole situation coming. His carefree behavior finally caught up to him.
On the other hand, people like Tony Stark thought Steve’s do-gooder nature…contravened with his more nefarious behaviors. They would clash with each other with their limited interactions and Tony, being his wisecracking self,
Tony almost wanted to mock Steve’s words, but quickly concluded that would be incredibly childish. He eyed his whole uniform once again before speaking.
Steve, the blonde Tony had made a not-so-appropriate statement about a minute ago, had his full attention on him. A frown was etched onto his features. As predicted, he wasn’t amused. Tony could have sworn Steve’s frown would become permanent if he held onto it any longer.
“Tony preforming a strip tease before he streaks the entire neighborhood…this is going to end well,” Jane sighed, “This probably isn’t a good idea.”
Outside of the apartment complex, he took quick strides, his hands in his pockets. It was extra chilly today, at least chillier than he anticipated in the morning. He hated this weather. At least winter break was coming soon. He could wind down a bit as there wasn’t as much schoolwork and extra-curricular commitments for him to worry about.
Tony could hear Clint snicker not too far from him. Bruce and Natasha were probably rolling their eyes beyond annoyance right now. Tony couldn’t help himself; he liked rousing up the guy. It was refreshing to see that seemingly perfect streak slip up a bit.
After Coulson finished, everyone got up from their desks, the desk tips slightly scraping the against the floor and their steps quick and prepared. They were clearly ready to head outside to start yet another day of hard work. Judging by the enthusiastic atmosphere within the room, this type of project was unmistakably enjoyable for them, much to Tony’s surprise. He could see Darcy wait for him by the door. Before he could reach her, Coulson’s voice stopped him in his tracks.
As of what Tony currently knew, Coulson was the team leader or chaperone who oversaw the volunteers/students, that there were 31 high schoolers who were the considered the team of volunteers – all of them juniors or older, and that there was a large construction site not too far from the school that their work would take place in.
“I was wearing boxers…” Tony mumbled. Sweat pooled at the edges of his forehead. Now this was absolutely humiliating.
“Is this about my detention? Because I forgot about it. I was completely swamped in homework over the weekend and the thought of it just passed my mind–”
Afterwards, Coulson pulled Tony aside and told him to change back into his regular clothes. He him back to the classroom.
“I told you it was embarrassing,” Tony replied, then continued in a louder voice, “Oh, and Becky, it’s not streaking if you do it with underwear on!”
“No, genius, we take a small drink of this–” Clint said, wiggling a large bottle of Smirnoff Vodka by the top, “Preferably the amount of a normal shot, maybe more, that is, if you want.”
Tony, Natasha, and Clint were lying beside each other on the grass, staring at nothing in particular. The talkative trio retreated into a peaceful silence, the chirping of the birds being the only occasional source of noise. A thin plume of smoke remained above them even after they finished.
Coulson briefly described what was to happen today, keeping it to the point so everyone would have more than enough time to get a good portion of work done.
“I’m just saying, Nat. She punishes me for the dumbest things,” Tony replied, “Clint could talk up a storm in that class and she wouldn’t say anything, I utter a single word and she goes all Defcon 1 on me.”
“No, no you’re not,” Steve replied in a haste fashion, wanting Bucky to quash down the topic of Tony Stark or anything having to do with Tony Stark, “I’m just trying to keep my sanity intact before we graduate.”
“He says you ran around his property yelling like a madman while he was having a meeting with the district’s school board directors, at his home,” His father said, unable to look at Tony. He was furious.
.” One of the front office administrators said through the speaker, repeating her words for clarity.
“Clearly Home Ec isn’t doing you any favors,” Another kid, Bruce Banner, spoke up. He sat to the left of Natasha, keeping his voice low enough, only for the other two to hear.
“Hell yes,” She replied, plopping down across from him, “Never in my life did I think I’d ever see you wear a construction uniform.”
Unbeknownst to Tony, Steve was staring at him, now only realizing his presence. His stare was expectantly a befuddled one, his eyebrows pressed together and lips slightly parted.
Steve let out a stifled sigh, his irritation exponentially growing. Tony’s mocking voice didn’t help.
“Lucky for you, your father was able to pull some strings,” Fury said, absolute contempt lacing his words. The privilege just oozed out of this boy, it almost enraged him.
“It’s kind of funny,” Bruce shrugged. When Tony’s expression wouldn’t budge, he gave him an assuring pat on the shoulder, “At least you didn’t get expelled. Knowing Fury, I think he went really easy on you.”
The sad thing was that Quentin was right. Tony didn’t have his usual quips spraying out of his mouth in retort against Quentin’s words, because of that. An uncharacteristic guilt was bubbling within him, as much as he hated it. His scathing words were something that wouldn’t escape his mind.
“Guys, make sure not to blow it in my direction!” Bruce called out to them, keeping a far enough distance from the other three.
They all stood up from their seats, Rhodey making sure Tony could walk on his own two feet. Thankfully, he had his balance in tow. The alcohol warmed up his system pretty good, but he wasn’t completely gone yet.
“The rest of you can go start,” Coulson repeated to the others who were still in the process of leaving the room.
So here he was running on the neighborhood street, occasionally running across the lawns, waving his hands like a mad man, and wearing super tight boxers all while singing “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” at the top of his lungs. Several feet behind him, his friends gathered in Thor’s truck, driving slowly but keeping a close enough distance to watch Tony lose all inhibition in himself.
As Tony began to put on his clothes, Thor drove back towards the direction of Tony’s house to finish their game of “truth and dare, but without the truth”.
“Got it,” Natasha replied, in a knowing voice. Bruce wasn’t so keen on smelling like weed for the remainder of the day. His parents would easily pick up on it and he’d be in huge trouble.
From below, Tony could see their footsteps shake the Bleachers as the three other boys stepped up on them. That’s when he emerged out of the corner, stumbling on his footsteps after Clint playfully extended his foot. Steve, Bucky, and Sam were animatedly talking amongst each other as they took their seats.
Even in his inebriated state, the words, ‘what the hell am I doing?’ repeatedly echoed in his thoughts. Though, the part of him, without any inhibition, was looking for that new sense of thrill, something out of bounds that he had never done before. Maybe Pepper would have stopped him. Wait, why didn’t she stop him?
“I’ll go,” Clint shrugged. He glanced around the area thinking of something bold enough, “I dare Romanov to kiss Pepper. Right on the lips.”
Before it was time for the volunteers to leave for the day, one of the construction workers had Steve help Tony screw the edge of a drywall sheet that was hung. They worked closely with him in case the first timer would make any mistakes.
Pepper gently cupped the sides of Natasha’s face. Natasha held onto the other’s wrists with her hands, securing them in place. There was a whistle or two amongst the silence before Natasha leaned in and pressed her lips against Pepper’s. Seconds later, they removed their lips from each other, amused grins on their faces.
As the hours ticked by, Tony’s party became more erratic. Alongside his friends, Tony drank more and more, not taking into account of how out of control it was getting. Whatever was happening, he could deal with it eventually. He would have it under control tomorrow, if not today.
“Looking good, Gamora,” Tony spoke, glancing at the girl who sat to the right of him. He wagged his eyebrows the moment she faced him. Tony only gave her an innocent stare once she rolled her eyes.
“Hey, I’m just surprised you don’t know! Then again, it’s kind of embarrassing, so I’d prefer it stay that way,” Tony said, suggestively wagging his eyebrows.
The voice belonged to one the guys among Darcy’s group. Tony instantly recognized him as Quentin Beck, a senior who shared a class or two with him. He was a smarmy son of a bitch. Quentin’s father had a withstanding grudge against Tony’s own father, as the former got fired by the latter for releasing confidential documents outside of the workplace years ago. For that reason, Quentin took the lasting effects of that ordeal to the grave with him and created a longstanding resentment against Tony by association.
Tomorrow was his second day of the construction project and he’d probably need as much energy as he could muster.
Quentin’s words once again were in the forefront of his mind. That ingratiating fuck really did struck a nerve, to his own admission.
“Shh!” Pepper shushed him, earning more snickers and laughter from the others. She handed Tony his outfit, “Now put these on before you catch something.”
“So is there any other possessiveness I should be aware of so I can selfishly foster it?” He smirked over at Tony. “Maybe you haven’t realized but I have a thing for that.”
“I definitely want to show you my ass,” he agreed.  Tony sunk back into Steve’s grip with a sigh, tipping his head forward slightly.  “You’re so amazing.  I can’t believe how wonderful you are.  How lucky I am.” The elevator doors opened and he let Steve take the lead to the bathroom.  “Can I undress you?”
“Why would I mind it?” He asked confused. “It just tells me you’ve been hurt before, but it also tells me you survived something difficult and that I should never underestimate your ability to adapt. The fact we’re even here on your sofa despite this scar is testament to how admirable your strength of character is…” he met Tony’s eyes with his own.
Tony took Steve’s hand again and pulled him up the stairs, then used his handprint to unlock the door and moved through the mansion to his office to find the form. “Here, just. Sign and date here?” He hated that he had to make Steve sign this, wanting to be able to trust him, but at least he seemed to genuinely understand.
Bucky laughed.  “You’re such a sap.” He prodded at Steve’s shoulders playfully, making him squirm, which made Tony uncomfortable in a way he didn’t quite understand.
“She said as long as she never had to read about her godson’s skills with his tongue she’d be just fine,” Steve was still crimson from remembering the story. “She never let me live it down, the first time Bucky stayed round again, as she left for she told Bucky not to get too carried away in case I text her and told her about the experience too,” he laughed. “God, it was so bad.” He giggled a little before adding “You ever sext much? I was crazy on it for like years as a teenager. I have no idea why? It seems pointless now? I think I’d probably only ever do bdsm scenes over text as interactive sexting now. I mean if you’re gonna have a sexual relationship with someone surely it’s better to do rather than talk about it. I mean I know you’re ace but y'know maybe you’ve done those things. Some ace people have done a lot,”
“Tell me what your favorite piece of lingerie clothing is?” He asked, prying for more information to use when he excused himself to go and jack off in the shower. That was just going to have to happen at this point.
“I’m sure you can find a way to make it interesting for me.” Tony kissed Steve’s temple, then cupped his cheek and stroked it with his thumb. “Annyira elég vagy, hogy szinte mindennel beszéljen.”
“Did you need to be somewhere?” he asked, concerned he was hindering his partner without realizing. He wandered up to Tony, fluffing up his hair a little. “I promise he’ll do what he needs to. Just give us an hour to have breakfast,” Steve cut in, hoping that would be enough to satisfy this lady. She must have been important, her gaze even intimidated Steve a little.
“I’m really glad that it was satisfying for you,” he grinned, kissing Tony’s cheek. “It was… really hot. And you look amazing and you sounded amazing. Just everything about that experience was as sensual as sex so I don’t really feel like it’s that different. I missed having the feel of your skin when I came but maybe that’s something we can work on. When you’re ready to be around for the messy bits,” Steve reasoned nuzzling Tony.
“Really? You want me to meet your friends already?” He had been sure Steve would need to leave and go back to his life. The chance to go with him… “I think I’m up for that, actually, yeah. I really want to see your art. You said you wanted me to model. You still planning on that? You should do something of Dummy. I’ll pay big money for it and show it off to everyone.” He pulled Steve to the kitchen and got him a mug, then pointed him to the coffee machine, still sipping at his own.
As Tony moved away Steve put his mug down on the breakfast bar. Following, Steve latched onto Tony’s waist, walking whilst attached to him and sighing softly as he kissed the nape of Tony’s neck.
“And oh my god you were so hot.” Steve praised again with a chuckle. “You’re like a drug induced sex hallucination. I couldn’t imagine someone hotter,” he praised gleefully. “If our sex life is just that for the rest of my life, I’m fucking lucky. You look so good in lingerie,”
“I do,” he agreed. “And I was serious about that bit. I want you to claim me, honey, and you buying me or picking out my clothes… That’s such a sweet non-aggressive way to do that. And I am so game for being pretty for you and I’d wear something you bought for me every day no problem. I want to have little things I can do for you to make you happy.” Tony kissed his shoulder and up his neck again, then stole another, softer kiss. “You’re so amazing. Perfect for me. I want to do it this sort of way at least a few more times, then maybe I can go into the shower with you and just be there for you to touch? And then maybe after that, I can start helping with the messy bits. But this was really really good and I want to build up slowly to more.”
Steve looked down at Tony, his bright eyes sparkling. “Do you really gotta ask? I wasn’t letting you go ever and I’m still not. I’m so certain you’re my soulmate I’d get a tattoo of your name.”
“Skin’s so soft,” Steve murmured. He could feel himself twitch, hiding his face in the crook of Tony’s neck he ran his hands down over the softness of Tony’s stomach. The chiffon danced over the back of his hands. Being able to hold Tony so intimately had him moaning against Tony’s skin.
“Well done baby,” Steve praised as they finished.  He turned the shower off, before getting out, then he held out a towel for Tony.  “Don’t want you getting too cold,” he added, motioning for Tony to step out so Steve could wrap him in the fluffy towel.
“I dunno if you reversed it, but the horrible memory is fading. Everything since then has been pretty nice. Are you planning on keeping me too?” He craned his neck a little to look back at him hopefully.
“Sure baby. You take me to a dinner and I’ll take you to a movie. The stuff I like is usually quite dark though. You got any important visual triggers I should know of?” He asked, quietly freaking out that Tony had called back--and done it so quickly! The spring made its way back into his step.
“I… Think I’m cool with calling this sex, yeah. Though it’s really really so much better.” He gasped softly, then swallowed, squeezing Steve’s waist a little as well. “I want to try all of those things. I really do. But I think I might be edging towards orange here. This is a lot and everything’s been kind of a lot today and I think I’m ready to take my pants off and curl up under the covers with you if that’s okay?” He knew it had only been a couple minutes and he was blushing again, but he was getting pretty overwhelmed by stuff and slowing down would probably be for the best.
“Awerh, jesus!” Steve exclaimed quietly, the wet against his cheek made him realize Tony was crying. “You’re still my baby! I just didn’t expect
Tony happily gave him the kiss, cupping his jaw and stroking his hair as he did. “How about you ask your questions while we go on our tour?” Steve being so willing to adapt to him was confusing, but amazing. Kisses and cuddles and questions rather than the sex he probably wanted. He got up and pulled Steve with him and then showed him the kitchen and the dining room first, since there were plenty of surfaces to cuddle against there.
“Yes, please.” He squeezed Steve’s hand one more time, then buckled his seat belt.  “I’d like it if you played with my hair when we get back home.  Maybe even wash it for me? Replace all of that touch with yours? But I really don’t mind doing whatever you want to do.  And you can stay as long as you want.  You can even come into my board meeting with me, as long as you’re wearing pants.”
Steve leaned his head back against the headrest. “Tony this is so fuckin’ cool of course I want to go now!” Steve exclaimed, moving to look up expectantly at Tony. Once Tony had made his move for the driver’s seat, Steve found his way back into the passenger seat.
The kisses turning open mouthed wouldn’t have been a problem at all if he hadn’t been close enough to feel exactly how they were affecting Steve, but before he could call orange, Steve told him to ignore the arousal and that was, surprisingly, enough to get him comfortable again in the idea that this wasn’t going any further.  So, he nodded and then practically purred as he tipped his head forward to rest his forehead on Steve’s chest.  The way his fingers moved through his hair was so
Steve was still reeling from his argument with Bucky, he’d thrown his coat on and headed straight for the door.  Tony’s unexpected apology confused him.  “Oh Tony--I’m not even mad about that at all.  I promise its fine,” he pressed.  “Well, I mean you’re fine.  I’m not mad at you.” He shut the door before locking it after himself.
“Yeah, you might be right,” he agreed with Natasha.  He’d thought that he’d found the right thing to say in response to the first story, but clearly Steve hadn’t taken it as well as hoped, so although he didn’t stop looking back at him, he let himself be lead away from him to the living room.  Hopefully Steve would recover quickly and come cuddle him again.
Steve chuckled at Tony’s joke, “sure - I would be honored to visit your place. And if--at any point--you wanna back out of having me ‘round please don’t be afraid to tell me. Tonight has been emotional, I understand if you need any time alone,” Steve offered gently.
Steve smirked, he was about to make a joke but stopped short. He didn’t know if it would be construed as offensive. So he nodded instead, “well I’m most comfortable in my underwear, but I’d only want that amazing skin contact if it was reciprocated,” Steve nuzzled the side of Tony’s face.
“I’m really not,” he admitted. “And I will too. But we can do it again in two days? After the date you plan for us? If you’re interested.” He took the hint and shoved another bite of pancake into his mouth, then rested his head against Steve’s shoulder for another long moment while he chewed. “What art store are we going to?”
Steve laughed. “Uh. He’s my ex?” it was a question more than an answer, he hoped Tony would be okay with it. “We were in denial for a long time that we had soulmates. Then he met Nat.” Steve spoke tersely. “We still live together because I’d be homeless, but it gets hard at times. He’s been counting down the days ‘til my timer started ticking. Guilt, maybe? He was the first person to tell me soulmates might not be real. They are.” He stated with a heavy sigh. “It happens, surprised mine didn’t scar over after that. I thought I had no heart left for a while.” He shrugged. “Wanna ask me something happy to distract me?”
Steve noticed Tony’s slight falter, it was obvious that worship had been abused too especially if Tony was that uncomfortable with the mere mention of it. As Tony settled onto Steve’s lap he whimpered a little with the weight as it provided friction and the heat of Tony’s warm skin against his clothed erection.
“You know your ass looks amazing in everything right? I’m an artist; I know what a masterpiece looks like.”
. “I also have some white lacy stuff. Very form-fitting. Kind of transparent. That definitely goes with the holidays. Add just a splash of red or blue, depending on Christmas or Hanukkah… Alig várom, hogy szép legyek.”
“Aren’t you the romantic?” Steve teased, starting the car with a quiet rev, “We sure are, beautiful.  Since you’ve been working with its buzz all day why don’t we head out somewhere a little quieter? I may or may not have brought a late-night picnic.” He wiggled his eyebrows.  “I know it’s pure debauchery.  And about as original as all my other gifts to you.  Hopefully, though, my corny and predictable romance is tolerable for you.” He smiled over at Tony, noticing the nerves.
Steve wasn’t so sure now, though. You have to touch the person? He hadn’t heard that before, but then again, Bucky and Natasha had shaken hands. So maybe it was true. Within a few seconds Steve’s mind had raced forwards to piece together what Tony was saying. That just… didn’t seem right. This scruffy little ball of aggressive, dismissive anxiety certainly did not strike Steve as his soulmate.
“I just… I’m very passionate. I see sex as the closest or furthest away from someone you can be and I hate the latter. I prefer the former. I like getting to fully know my partner. I think sex reveals a lot about a person without them having to worry about finding words to explain themselves,” Steve clicked his tongue, “I say a lot about myself without having to discuss it. I talk with body language far better than I do with words. Usually. So all day in bed once the interest is mutual? Absolutely.” He laughed, blushing a little.
“I probably ain’t gonna use love, not for a while,” Steve continued.  “Only just stopped using it with someone else, but I feel it.  That intensity, I know it’s here and I’m wild for you too.”
Tony transferred them quickly, then deleted the originals, setting the phone down on the table, then happily sitting in the chair Steve held out. “Mm… Ön csodálatos.”
Tony was all set to protest until Steve said that both of them were too raw. If Steve was uncomfortable too, then he could go along with it. “Does that mean you actually will let me pay for the supplies? You didn’t answer very firmly on that earlier.” He did still want a chance to see Steve in his element and since his studio was in his house, it could be a problem to hang out there and expect to be able to avoid his roommates. “Because if I get to pay, I’m all for that plan.”
“Vegetarian. Gluten free base, please,” Steve stated politely, similarly unbuckling and hopping out of the car. “I know you can totally take care of yourself, doesn’t mean I can’t get protective over you baby,” Steve teased, he moved closer, slipping his hand into Tony’s. “I’m about as obvious as a brick to the face,” he joked, “but I promise, it’s all honest.” He laid it out on the table exactly how he saw it. He knew Tony was his soulmate, there was no doubt about it.
“I…” Tony stared down at the number thoughtfully. He knew how kids were and he was going to be teased endlessly for that. The idea almost made him smile.
However as taxi pulled up and an angry looking mass of short human walked directly into his chest he was taken by surprise.
Tony was a little more clear-headed than Steve was at this point, and he smiled gratefully when he heard that. “That’s perfect, Steve, thank you.” He kissed his jaw, then pulled away to go into the closet, changing as quickly as he could.
Tony Stark to slam into me out of a cab, that’s all. You know, people can look like celebrities without being them!” Steve tried to defend himself. “You would expect an ex CEO to be travelling by a limo or something! Look, I was dumb as fuck, please don’t let that be your lasting impression of me.” Steve pleaded, his hands coming to wipe at the stains of subtle eyeliner leaking onto Tony’s face. Tony couldn’t seem to find the energy to pull away from the gentle touch.
“That’s ridiculously sweet and thoughtful. But there’s a difference between being obnoxious and in people’s faces and just talking how you talk and sharing your experience of the world. What I’m saying is that you don’t need to desexualize everything because I don’t see the world through a sexual perspective. If you do, that’s just as important for you.” He stroked and then kissed his cheek again, then stood back to let him pick the car.
“It’s nice to meet you, Steve. I hope you and Tony have a nice day.” And then she left. Tony turned around and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, hugging him tightly. “Didn’t mean for the shouting to get you up. Sorry. Pep worries. You want coffee? Or more sleep?”
“You’re such a dork.  Yes, I have to go to work.  But I won’t need to leave you until ten.  I can get from your place to mine and then to the office just fine in an hour.  But I’m
“Bucky? Yeah, that’s okay. I don’t think we’re really gonna be able to avoid him even if we wanted to. Hit me with it.” He rubbed idly at Steve’s back and relaxed completely against him again.
“You’re a huge dork and I’m gonna go get dressed. But yes, I am beautiful and you’re lucky to have me.” That confidence was only half-fake, which Tony figured was good enough.
He couldn’t meet Steve’s eyes after that. He didn’t want to scare him like that. Tony had never… He’d never been like that, but he understood the fear and even knowing he was pushing, that might’ve been a step too far for tonight.
“Whereabouts on my body are we having this tattoo? Where everyone can see it or somewhere only you can see it?”
He crinkled his nose at the idea of Steve not brushing his teeth twice a day, but he couldn’t resist the unbelievable comfort of being pulled against him like that. So he let it go. Mostly. He might come back to it later. “Okay. Fine. But no more than one gross morning breath kiss. And wake me up when you inevitably have to get up in the middle of the night? I don’t want to wake up alone.”
“You don’t have to pay me to paint Dummy.” Steve tsked, “I’d do that myself as a gift to you. I can always paint the real Jarvis for you as well, from a photograph considering I don’t think I’d be able to paint your AI child. That is, unless he has distinct circuitry I could paint for you.”
“I can tell you’re freaked out. I always come on too strong, anyway. It’s a gift and a curse.” He paused, his bright eyes faltering a little. “There’s my number, if you feel like telling me your name and humoring me with a date. If not? You never have to see me again. I should apologize. For making you late to wherever it is you have to be,” Steve rationalized for a moment, hoping he hadn’t made too much of a fool out of himself.
“I’d love to do a double celebration of Hanukkah and Christmas. Traditional cross over huh?” He smiled, “A joining of the old and new testaments, even if one is just a good bit of fiction,” he winked, joking about the Jewish perspective that the New Testament was not valid scripture.
“Yeah, Irish Catholic born and raised,” Steve smiled, as Tony touched his cheek. It made his stomach summersault to have Tony be so honestly adoring over something as silly as color on his cheeks.
“I…” Yeah, he wasn’t going to touch the getting help thing. He should, but he really just wasn’t strong enough right now. He knew he wasn’t committed. But the question Steve had asked was easier, so he jumped back to that. “Yeah, I am. Asexual. That’s not a problem? Me not being attracted to you?” He’d come out publicly a couple years previously, but after a couple weeks of the media making fun of him for it and calling him a liar and an attention whore, it had stopped being interesting, and no one had really remembered.
“It was less creepy than it sounds.  And I’m more than interested.  I wasn’t at first, but I gave in and called him because what if? And then he proved he was serious and I’m falling hard.  Believe me, I want him attached to me.” He made the eye contact and didn’t even pull away from her hand in his hair.  “What was he singing?
“Sure sweetheart. Why don’t we have pancakes?” He asked moving down to kiss Tony’s cheek before moving opposite him. “I’m a working artist - yes. But I also control my art and I give it when it is done from the heart. This isn’t about money, I’m doing this for you because I care about you and your little magical creations you have here,” he smiled. “I don’t want money for them.”
“I am so fucking lucky to have you - you’re right,” Steve hummed gently, “I’ve only been with you a day and you’ve already made my life so much more interesting.” He stressed, refusing to let Tony leave his embrace. “Is it wrong to tackle you to the bed and not let you leave?” He asked aloud. “Is it so bad that all I want to do is touch you and forget about the basics like food and hydration?”
“I can’t wait to wear things you’ve bought me. I love that you’re possessive and want to claim me like that.”
“I have a serious language kink - so as much as part of me is chomping at the bit to witness that, it’s probably better left to my imagination for a while. I’ve managed to not get ridiculously hard for you so far - I’m determined to at least leave that for the second date,” he joked.
“Oh no. You’re gonna kill me,” Tony responded with a little laugh. “Baby, already. And no, I’ll… I’m good.” Dark or not, he didn’t expect Steve to jump to something with explicit depictions of abuse on the first date. “Are you, uh, free tonight? Later? I’ve got this thing, with kids, that I’m late for now, but I usually am. I should be done by six, though.” He could probably duck out to go plan their date by four or so which would give him time. Steve wanted romantic, so he could… this was probably a really bad idea, but he could get dressed up and bring flowers and stuff. “You have any allergies?”
Following Tony’s motions, he found the underwear, glad he had something to change into. Slipping them on underneath the towel he undid the towel to dry his hair.
Tony smiled happily and used his newly freed hands to reach out and touch Steve’s shoulders, sliding his palms down his arms before letting him go.
Tony was recognized less often than people would think when he was wearing jeans and t-shirts rather than a suit, and they didn’t have any problems in the diner. He smiled back at Steve and laced their fingers together.
At that moment a petite red head appeared by Bucky’s side.  She was wearing shorts and a crop top, her six pack visible through shadows even in the low light.  She smiled brightly.
“Steve, my body is dependent on it. Everything just kind of starts to hurt if it’s been too long since my last drink. If I really really go to long, that turns into hallucinations, seizures, and heart problems. It has nothing to do with you. If anything, I’m drinking less because you’re here and making me feel safe. I’m not drinking because I’m stressed or uncomfortable or anything like that, okay? I probably won’t need more than that tonight.” He was looking concerned now too and he touched Steve’s cheek and then his hair, hoping the touch would help.
Tony squeezed back with a smile and a nod and pressed a kiss to Steve’s shoulder before carefully tugging Steve’s shirt off and pressing his hands to his stomach.  He smoothed them up and around, just feeling Steve’s skin under his fingers and palms, then pressed a kiss to the dip of his collarbone before looking up and making eye contact again.  He was enjoying himself, but mostly, this was about showing Steve how amazing and wanted he was, so he wanted to make sure he wasn’t doing anything wrong.
Tony kept aggressively backseat driving and only changed the music once, but by the time they were pulling off the road, he was feeling a little better about Steve’s driving.  And he was having all sorts of happy thoughts about Steve and his future beard, which would probably be gorgeous and fluffy if his chest hair was anything to go by.
“Oh yeah, huh, a shoulder tattoo?” Steve mulled in his head. “I could get around to this idea. Well now I know what your valentines gift is going to be,” Steve chuckled, wiggling his eyebrows. He rolled over onto his back, pulling Tony so that he lay over his chest. “Is Spring your favorite season? I think I like Autumn most. Maybe it’s the colors. I’m very much into earthy browns and reds.” He grinned, brushing Tony’s fringe aside. “Like your eyes and hair, they’re such a beautiful rich brown. An artist can really appreciate these things you see,” he winked, knowing he was chatting shit he didn’t care. Tony made him feel at ease being vulnerable like this.
“Crying makes people uncomfortable and we’re not the only people in this diner. I’d really rather wait.” That wasn’t his only reason, but he didn’t want to give Steve any more reasons to be upset on his behalf right then. “I know it wasn’t a punishment but I… do appreciate you making it perfectly clear.” He gave in a little and leaned into Steve’s side again. “You’re sure this is okay now?”
Tony shook his head, but didn’t let the uncomfortable subject of Bucky’s preferences get to him too much.  “You know, your ex liking it short just makes me want it long even more, but I dunno, we can think about it.  You ever had a beard? I think that would be nice too.” His hair was already long enough to play with anyways, which was what was really important.
He prepared vegetarian lasagna for them both, he’d set the table up with a table cloth and nice cutlery and matching plates. He sacrificed time and effort to make it look picturesque and homely. The only thing missing was a centerpiece but there wasn’t much around to use. Besides, flowers were for tomorrow after they parted so Tony had something sweet to remember him by.
“Hey… hey, calm down, everything’s fine. Plans change. You don’t have to worry about my wallet or my budget, I’ll be just fine.” Steve tried his best to soothe Tony, “I can give you a great massage if you let me get some of my oils and a decent burner, you look like you could use a little TLC.”
Despite Tony’s plea he took his time in the shower. This was his part of the experience, the part that entirely benefitted him and he would need to indulge himself to survive. He prolonged the fantasies in his head - all fictional for the aid of his enjoyment. He’s never been so invested in masturbating and it had never felt so rewarding. Once he was finished and cleaned, however, he hopped out of the shower and walked out into the bedroom. His skin was flushed bright red, his eyes bright and an easy smile rested on his features and it wasn’t just because of the hot water.
Steve was walking back with a blanket tucked beneath his arm, it was as if Tony had read his mind.  Rolling out the blanket Steve sat down on the ground, patting the floor in front of him to signal Tony to sit.  “Well, we’re gonna have a coffee and admire the night sky, sure.  And cuddle a little, but I can’t keep you too late, can I sweetie? Do you have more work to do tomorrow?”
“What in the hell?” Steve muttered from the corridor trying to find Bucky. He was bright red. He’s had the biggest celebrity crush on this dude for a long time. Bucky was on his MIT scholarship scheme--the Maria Stark something. “Did you win a project or somethin?” He called out aimlessly.
“Well, it would be classed as intimacy but to me this is a form of sexual contact. I’m getting to show you how I feel physically - to me that’s what sex is. So we’re both happy.” He explained, his hands coming round to run back down Tony’s back. “I love that you’re asexual. Coming up with ways to make you feel intimately cherished is fun and is widening my understanding of human intimacy. It’s beautiful. Just like you.”
Steve paused before adding, “But he must be close to sentience right? If you said we’ll see? Do you know how genuinely amazing that is? That’s probably the most attractive thing I’ve heard you say to me.” He genuinely beyond excitement now. “If I end up friends with Jarvis tonight that is like… a life goal. I really wanna see what you’ve made Tony. They sound beautiful.”
“Aston Martin. One-77. She’s definitely a beauty.” He gave Steve a shaky smile, then asked, “Do you want to stop and grab something to eat on the way?” He’d had JARVIS cancel their dinner reservation already. He didn’t let himself ask if Steve was really sure or if he knew what he was getting into, because he figured he was allowed to be selfish for one night. And even if things didn’t work out at all, one evening of Steve looking at him like he was amazing and trusting him and calling him baby… He wanted that.
Steve laughed, “hell no it’d turn me on but I was just asking because it would be a different sensation to what you’re used to with me.” Steve explained.
Steve managed to find his way around the coffee machine, despite Tony’s upgrades. “I have a sketch book of portraits and intimate drawings. That’s where people go. Hopefully you’ll be in there soon enough. I wouldn’t advise rummaging through it, though. I have nudes of Bucky in there from a good five years ago when I started a new book,” he laughed a little. “I tend to only draw people I admire deeply or love. Bucky’s in there, Bucky and Nat have a few couple portraits because I went through a time of being slightly in love with them both. Yeah, it’s as weird as it sounds,” he hummed before adding, “Nat has a few pages, there’s a few pages from a couple of artists I worked with on some group projects…” he trailed off, stretching his shoulders.
The pizza was delivered to their booth, and Tony picked it and his drink up, then took Steve’s hand. “Give my thanks to Mario, Amelia. C’mon, let’s go watch the sunset.”
“I have an idea. For some asexual friendly intimacy, if you’re interested?” Steve asked, unsure. “I’ve never catered to asexuality before, I’m going to need feedback to get better at it,” he offered out. “If you are familiar with BDSM maybe we could use the traffic light system for intimacy? I know it’s just touching but I want to make sure you feel safe still,”
“Nat and Bucky might be around--their cars are here.  I’m honestly not sure.  The house is pretty communal; we all hang together frequently.  I’ll make sure they don’t pester you too much.” Steve smiled, fishing out his keys from his pocket.  He had a BB-8 key chain and an Edgar Allen Poe quote tucked around the ring of keys.  Jiggling them around a little, he found the right key and let himself inside.
“I like it because you chose it. It’s the first one you used. And you were very forward with it. Which I like about you.” He smiled at him for a long moment, then gave in and rested his forehead on Steve’s shoulder again. “Tell me a story? Something fun that’s happened to you.”
“Honey, as considerate as that is, this is our third date. We had dinner, breakfast, and this is dinner again. That’s three.” He grinned back and took another bite of food, feeling surprisingly good about things between them now. “Hypothetical question: Would you be comfortable if–let’s say around Christmas–I put on something very soft and tight and red for you? Possibly with glitter. Would that be too soon? No power exchange. No sex on my part. Just getting dolled up so you can look at me and maybe jack off?” It’s okay if you say no, but I really do like lingerie. And I’ve got some stuff I’m pretty sure you’d like. Seems kind of a shame to let it go to waste after you specifically mentioned lingerie.“
“Do you prefer cuddling a partner? In the event that I do want to orgasm do you have any voyeurism kinks or is exposure to sexual content something that makes you uneasy? Asexuality is far more complex than many people give it credit for. I feel I need to know more, but it is so personal, you don’t have to answer yet. Or at all, ever.”
Steve ordered the banoffee waffles and a hot chocolate. “I wasn’t talking about watching me with others; we’re exclusive,” Steve clarified stating it like it was the most obvious fact in the universe before leaning his chin on his hands in thought.
“Thank you, Master,” he said sincerely again at the praise.  Then Tony took the shampoo and washed Steve’s hair just as carefully as he had washed his, making sure every strand and every inch of scalp got attention as he worked it in and rinsed it out.  Then he massaged in some very expensive conditioner before moving onto the soap.  He got down on his knees to start with his feet and move his way up, using his hands rather than a cloth and getting between each toe, around each nail, and carefully up and into every crevice.
The house smelled amazing, Bucky had probably been cooking earlier.  He was right about expecting people to come investigate though, and he’d barely removed his coat when he heard Bucky.
“I care because this is your sexuality, Tony. That’s important. You can’t jump into BDSM and not know your own sexuality, if you don’t know, how is your dom supposed to know?” He asked.
Tony smiled at him fondly, then looked back through the windshield and grabbed the door handle a little tighter than necessary.  “Hey, hey, hey brake.  Red light.”
Tony was in a rush. He didn’t really have a reason to be rushing, but he was angry because nothing had been working in the lab that morning and then Pepper had guilted him into going to some kids expo thing. He didn’t even know what it was, exactly but apparently it was vital for the company’s PR. He hadn’t even bothered to put on a suit—or a coat, even though it was December-- still wearing the grease-stained T-shirt with a dragon on it that he’d put on to work in the lab that morning.
“Mmngf baby,” he purred tilting Tony’s chin so they could make eye contact. “Thank you for telling me, but I wasn’t planning on touching any personal part of you and I never will unless I have your direct permission to,” he hummed grazing his lips across the slope of Tony’s shoulders. His hands slipped under the chiffon robe, fingertips feeling each individual rib before moving round to run his hands over Tony’s shoulder blades.
“I’m sure we must be soulmates… I’m fascinated by the idea you’ve created learning algorithms and sentient life? That’s… like yeah ok your face is pretty but I’m way more attracted to the fact you just told me you have built an AI!” Steve shuffled a little to look Tony in the eye. “Can I meet it?” Steve asked sincerely. “As in can I talk to it? Does it have a gender? Oh Jesus if it has a gender I totally want to know why it identifies as a gender. Isn’t that fascinating?” It was clear that he was getting excited.
He chewed on the inside of his cheek, stared down at the number on his hand, and pulled his phone out of his pocket. It was going to rain soon. If he didn’t call now, the numbers might smudge and then he’d never get the chance. That was probably the worst justification he’s ever given himself.
“I don’t have the money to rent a studio, so I get what I can. For obvious reasons I try not to use oils. I’ve never really been much good with them anyways. There’s a couple of small frosted windows at the top which you can open up. I try to leave the door open too. It is what it is. I do miss the airy free spaces I used to work in when I was being taught.” Steve hummed thoughtfully.
Steve smiled, “Okay - who was your first guy crush and why?” Steve asked, hoping that was more entertaining for Tony to answer. “I’ll show you some when I take you to the studio, it’s basically the basement of my house. It’s pretty cool.” He continued to pet Tony’s hair, the soothing moments still working against his back. It was relaxing to just stop and take a moment to admire the colors of the sky and feel a connection to another human being.
Really, though, any positive feedback would be really appreciated by both of us. Kudos and bookmarks are amazing and wonderful and you guys are great, but even just a single exclamation point in the comments is a little more personal, and feels a little more special. And! You can add that to every chapter so we know you're sticking around! Questions are good too. Feel absolutely free to ask questions in the comments.
“It’s okay to mourn what you didn’t have. Has anyone told you that? But it’s also sometimes for the best that it happens the way it does. Your Butler and his wife have raised a beautiful person. I give them every credit for it, the same way I hold respect for any single mother.”
Steve jumped a little at the voice - not expecting it. “Hey JARVIS, Tony’s told me a little bit about you. I was excited to meet you,” Steve confessed. “You’re kinda a big deal. You know how special you are right?” Steve asked aloud, copying how Tony interacted with the AI. He was still staring at the ceiling not yet understanding that you didn’t have to see JARVIS to communicate with him.
Steve smirked, letting go of Tony, he let the other have space enough to get moving. They moved back towards the elevator. “I assume we’re going in here?”
“Woah! What the hell are you doing here?” He looked utterly stunned. “Bucky!? Bucky!? Are you expecting that clean energy CEO over? Oh god what’s the name. Stark! Are you expecting a Stark!?” He’d completely disappeared into the house.
“Anthony Edward Stark. But not a fan of being called Anthony. I like it when you blush.” He reached up to touch his cheek fondly. “How do you feel about Hanukkah? You mentioned Christmas earlier, so. I don’t normally do Christmas, but I’m game for celebrating both if you are. Are you Christian or... ?”
He frowned a little when Steve walked away, then his eyes went wide. “Steve, honey, can I kiss you? I love it. It’s amazing. Your amazing. I can’t believe you did all this.”
The store was across town, but it was a bulk place with good discounts. Tony spent most of their time there poking at and feeling the different papers and brushes, but he also talked Steve into doing a fairly large-scale piece and got him all new materials for the project, since he said his paints were getting kind of low and a little bit dry. Then they went home and Tony let Steve have the space he needed to get started. He went to his little sitting area where he could hardly see them and after a while, he wandered upstairs to have some time to himself to think.
Steve listened to Tony, taking in what it meant.  “That’s kinda poetic.” He hummed, “that you’re seeing the brightness of two stars, but it comes to us as one.” He appreciated them once more through the lens of the telescope before offering it over to Tony, who hummed his agreement.
Taking out his phone, Steve brought up the gallery. “Okay, okay - this is being deleted immediately in accordance with the NDA, and you can even delete it yourself. I just thought you’d die to see it first,”
Steve mulled between a cream and burgundy classic chevvy and a Ford 315. Finally deciding on the Ford, he pointed towards it. “This for sure.” He had to think about what Tony was saying to truly process it. “But if we don’t change language how would we ever desexualize the world to a point where someone who wishes to stay desexualized recognizes they have that choice? I don’t mean to be obnoxious… I’m just very big on bi visibility, right? And I’m seeing ace through those eyes, people recognize bi now – it’s in the big four, LGBT. But that’s only because we’ve insisted on establishing and continue to establish ourselves as an identity that needs to be recognized through language. It’s not a phase, I don’t have a preference… it’s not greediness to be sexually attracted to both masculine and feminine… so isn’t separating happiness and sex part of… ace visibility?”
“I’m bi. But. No one’s ever asked me. If I was… Yes. I’m sex-repulsed. I can do sex. I even like it sometimes, but it has to be all about the other person. I can’t… I’ve never orgasmed and not almost immediately vomited. That answer your question?” Anyone else would’ve ran or tried to talk him into sex to fix him by now. He couldn’t wrap his head around any of this. Which was saying something because his brain was his brain.
“I think that would make a real classy shoulder tattoo. So everyone can only see it if you want them to. At the gym or the beach or the pool… Or everywhere. Depends on how much you take your shirt off.”
“Or we can take the stairs. Up to you.” Tony squeezed his hand and leaned into his side. “You’re super cute, you know that? So so cute and gorgeous and amazing.” He leaned up to kiss his cheek, then went with him back downstairs and lead him into the workshop rather than the garage, punching in a code and letting him go in ahead of him. “Hey Dummy, why are my work rags on the floor here instead of in their hamper? Come here. Look at these. These belong here.” He picked one up and moved it to the hamper and then Dummy, instead of picking up and moving the rest of them, got that one out of the hamper and returned it to the pile on the floor. It took another three tries for him to catch on and clean them up. “So, uh, yeah. That’s Dummy. Butterfingers, honey, fetch your ball so we can play a game.”
“I’d love to.” Steve replied instantly. It was a relief that Tony wanted to see him so soon. Steve wasn’t sure how long he could wait to see Tony again. “How about I surprise you with something romantic?” He asked, “how do you fancy being wooed a little?” Steve grinned, taking a menu to leaf through it. “I must say I’m a sucker for traditional romance. I love to make the object of my affections feel special, if you’re into feeling special?” He inquired with an eyebrow raised. “It’s not everyone’s preferred approach,”
“Oh god, you’re a tease and amazing. And we’re already planning Hanukkah presents? Love it. That means I do get kisses after dinner though, right?” Tony started to eat too, and was very clearly pleased with what he put in his mouth. “This is as good as it smells. You’ve earned all the Hungarian you want. I can speak exclusively in Hungarian if that strikes your fancy.”
Steve snorted, “brutal,” he commented with a laugh. Well at least he knew not to do that unless he wanted to be spurned. Steve started purposefully tickling Tony. “I have lots to say in response, but I refuse to speak until you apologize for that brutal rejection of my declaration of affection.” He teased, “I mean it! I might be your soulmate but you’re not getting away with that!”
His breath hitched a little at being called baby again and he cuddled a little closer, soaking up the touches. He nodded at the question, and then said, “I think you’ve got me convinced too.” He stayed as close as he could, readjusting his position a couple times. “What’s your favorite color?” Steve was right there being perfect again and he couldn’t believe how lucky he was for the chance learn everything about him. He couldn’t just stop questions because it was dark and they’d had a bit of a disagreement.
“I didn’t really know my parents. They never wanted or expected me and I was basically raised by the butler and his wife. All four of them are dead, now. I have a cousin I never talk to who’s doing some kind of secret government research, and I have a not-blood-related sort of cousin, Sharon, who’s pretty fantastic. Then I have Rhodey. He’s my best friend. Been there for me since we were teenagers.
As six pm approached, he was loading his banged up, aged, hunk of metal car with picnic snacks and a couple of thermoses, one of hot cocoa and the other filled with coffee.  He’d stolen some hats, scarfs and gloves from the hall dresser and stashed them away.  He figured it probably wasn’t a good idea to stay again unless Tony really wanted him to.  As much as he enjoyed spending all his time with Tony he didn’t want to fall behind on his work.
He did smile at the end of Steve’s little monologue. “I don’t need a massage,” he insisted. “But a long drive might be nice. I’m just gonna,” he gestured towards the car. “You can go, uh, get anything else you need. I won’t run away unless someone else comes out to try to meet me. Promise.”
“What d'you guys want to know?” he asked with a forced grin.  “I promise I’ll only lie if I don’t want to tell you the truth.”
Steve held Tony tight, wrapping his arms around his lover.  “I feel it too Tony.  Maybe not quite love, not yet.  But there is a magic between us, one that makes my head so dizzy I’m scared it’ll fall off.  I really won’t let you go.  Believe me--you’re mine, for as long as we have left on this spinning chunk of rock,” he assured softly.  “Everything about you is beautiful.  I never thought I’d meet anyone who could complete me the way you seem to do.  I’ve learned so much whilst I’ve been with you - grown so much as a person in the space of 72 hours.  You bring out the best in me, make me wanna be all sorts of a good person.  Been thinking that timer was bullshit my whole life ‘til the day it started counting backwards.  I know now how real it is.” He took his gloves off, taking Tony’s off as well so they could feel each other’s skin as they held hands.
Steve laughed, his cheeks going bright red. “Guess you’ll just have to keep making a fantastic impression so I don’t get another random bout of amnesia,” Steve rolled his eyes playfully at Tony.
Steve smirked, he was so tempted to say no. He liked being able to have the power of touching without being touched, but he figured it was far too soon for them to be practicing powerplay. Removing Tony’s shirt from around his wrists Steve nodded, his fingers deftly running down the buttons of his own shirt before similarly throwing it to the floor.
“Steve, sweetheart. I don’t always know all my limits ahead of time. Sometimes I overestimate what I can handle. But you can trust me to use my safeword, I promise. We don’t have to not do anything because I’ve been hurt in the past. I want to do things with you.” He thanked the waitress for their food, then got up and slid into the other side of the booth to wrap an arm around Steve’s waist. "I told you I’d been in a long-term abusive relationship. Did you just not picture what that could mean before now? I didn’t mean to drop new and unexpected information there.”
“It’s going to take a while, however, in the short term I drew you something else. You could have it in your office or your bedroom or something,” he shrugged, “it’s no masterpiece but I wanted to give you something at the dinner table,” he walked over to the breakfast bar and held up his shaded sketch of the millenium falcon - “something told me you were a Han Solo fan, so I hope you like it.”
“I was thinking because you seem to like D/s dynamics maybe we could work the orgasm into that somehow, but if it’s the actually physical action of release rather than the emotions around it that you find disgusting I’m leaning towards us focusing more on my body so I don’t ever put you in that position.”
Steve nodded - he found it hard to keep a straight face when Tony told him he found sex boring. “It’s important question because I need to know these sorts of things to keep our intimacy interesting for you. I’d be horrified if you were ever counting sheep during any intimacy between us,” he smirked. “So no masturbation. No orgasm. Do you actively like to watch or are you disinterested?” Steve asked, a smile playing upon his lips. “I mean we don’t have to talk about this if you don’t want I’m just like, thinking about making you feel special in every way,”
“You bet it does, baby,” Steve reassured, but he was slightly surprised at Tony’s question.  Pulling Tony so he lay against Steve’s chest, Steve hummed, “This was amazing and we’re definitely going to talk about it tomorrow,” Steve replied.  “You did great, though.  Please don’t worry.”
“Okay, now let’s go,” Steve eagerly tugged Tony towards the door. “Formalities can be forgotten now,”
“Good. Because I’m committed to this now. I want this with you.” He nuzzled him a little and slipped into his lap. “You gonna keep calling me baby? Or have you given that up now?”
Tony choked back a little grateful sob and then leaned over to hug Steve again, as tightly as he could. “The two helper bots really are like puppies. They just like attention. I taught them to play fetch a couple months ago.” He reluctantly let go and threw the pizza in the back again, then started the car. “I really do have to get you to sign an NDA before seeing my workshop.” He was nervous and he didn’t want to have to, but even with the form, it would be hard to trust anyone around his newest inventions.
“You’re not damaged goods.” It was the only thing he felt like he could address after hearing all that. “Whoever did that? Seriously damaged and used you as canvas to express it. It’s not your fault. He betrayed you.” His eyebrows knitted together, a frown etched across his usually bright and expressive features. That was hard to process. Ignoring someone’s safe word sounded so alien to him. Being pushed past limits sounded honestly horrific - more like torture than fun. He hadn’t realized Tony had been the victim of domestic violence.
Tony smiled, but he also said, “Don’t do that. It wasn’t that bad. I never thought you were going to hurt me. I did think maybe you’d set me up for about four seconds there, but… I’m not worried. I don’t just carry around NDAs either.” He pulled out onto the street, then drove probably a little too fast towards the edge of the city. “Are you sure about food? We could just get a pizza or something. Bring it up with us. I don’t want any weird hunger noises in the car.” The having feelings thing was somehow more frightening than the stranger yelling at him on the street thing.
“Oh. Yeah, Édesem… I really like the sound of that.” He couldn’t help but feel incredibly proud as he watched Steve flush and refocus on his food. “You can buy all my underwear if you want to. I’ll wear it every day. We could start that on New Year’s. I could make a resolution to always be yours. I’m pretty sure I won’t have any trouble breaking that one.”
Steve quirked his eyebrow but when he felt Tony’s arm wrap around him he cooed, “Aweerh hey you,” he greeted, turning around in Tony’s arms to cuddle him back. “I’m giving you fair warning this is for greater comfort rather than sex,” he hoisted Tony up onto his office desk so that Steve could hug Tony tight to his chest.
Steve bit his lip, breathing a little labored now. Tony was being so incredibly sexy. It came out of nowhere but god, he loved it. Steve couldn’t focus on his food anymore, he was semi-hard and oh so desperate to just let go. Restraining himself, he managed to calmly reply.
Steve smiled at Tony, he seemed to be relaxing, which was positive. “I don’t tend to kiss and tell anyway, so you don’t have to worry about me. I’m honored you’re taking the chance.” He tried to be as encouraging as possible, he could sense that Tony spooked easily and was fairly nervous when it came to relationships. Steve could hardly blame the guy.
the kid was - but he seemed entirely harmless and keen to serve his king. He didn’t seem to be the mysterious Iron man figure those webs were meant to come from.
again, right in front of him. He presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead and grins when he feels Tony wriggle and laugh against him. He feels a desperate need to make Tony understand, so he mutters “I love you” again, and shakes his shoulders, concentrating on the miraculous puff of breathe he can feel against his neck.
“I’ll stick Clint on mornings,” she said, casual. “He’ll hate it. Teach him not to deliberately mis-spell peoples’ names.”
Steve squeezed his eyes shut, knuckles white on the edge of the shield, and concentrated on breathing through his nose.
Steve waved him off, already writing on the cup with a flourish. The amused exasperation on Tony’s face when he read “Tonie” across the side of his cup shouldn’t have been as adorable as it was.
Tony waved the question away. “Anyway, point is, wanna go hang out? I’ve got the morning free, you’ve got the morning free, let’s make it a date. I’ll pose however you like.”
There, in the middle of a magic maelstrom, the wind whipping at his cloak, he yelled the final word.
“We know the Winter Soldier was personally responsible for at least a hundred deaths, though the count is likely much higher. Such a magic load would likely be causing some level of sickness, and would give its bearer magic stronger than most of us have ever seen. Barnes, however, seems perfectly healthy. I do not believe he possesses any more magic than he did when he was first taken from us.”
One day Tony slumped forward over the bar counter, head pillowed on his folded arms, feet twisted in the legs of the stool he was sitting on.
Steve’s heart stopped. He moved without thinking, barely noticing the shards of glass-like crystal that littered the ground. They sliced through his clothing, buried themselves in his skin, but Steve couldn’t find it within himself to care.
- one of the birds fluttered down and inspected him with one beady black eye. It hopped closer, then closer again, assessing whether Steve had any crumbs to discard. Its mate twittered in the tree above.
. It’d been three days, three entire days since Steve’s future was stolen from him, and he could feel the stone beginning to solidify around him. His mind was still aware - but it didn’t matter anymore.
The grin he flashed wasn’t the most confident, but Bruce could see the effort he was putting into it.
Carol nodded, ignoring the murmur that rippled through the room as she glanced at her notes. “Do any here wish to represent the accused in his defence?”
If Clint was wearing his hearing aids, he would have been startled to realise that they had stuttered back into perfect working order seemingly without any outside intervention.
For a moment Steve imagined a brush of stone lips against his, and he sighed, leaned into the kiss, automatically releasing himself to it in a moment of weakness.
One of Bucky’s guards raised a hand. “Uh. That magic arm, Captain. We was sayin’ yesterday - he’s not used it once since we arrested him. Seems like he can’t even move the thing.”
He would have to be careful then. Make sure nobody caught him unawares, when he was sleeping or too tired to keep the magical disguise running.
Also: HAPPY NEW YEAR. It just ticked over an hour and 36 minutes ago where I am. I hope 2019 treats you all well. Come say hello on
He glanced up at Jane and flashed a brittle smile. “You’re a true hero, Jane. Don’t ever let Hammer think otherwise.”
A hush settled across the room as a woman moved toward the centre of the room, twisting the edge of her coat in her hands. Steve could see the moment she braced herself, the way she drew up her shoulders and straightened her spine as though to draw her strength inwards.
“You said your bed was empty. That implies it HAD been full.” She leaned forward. “I have a lot of money resting on this, so I must ask; was it who I think it was?”
Steve thought he should say something, but his tongue seemed heavy, and his throat didn’t work, and he couldn’t think of anything to say. He turned and stared at the clouds again, listing sideways until he was propped up against his friend’s shoulder. A pause, before Bucky’s arm slipped around his shoulders, and his check rested against the top of his head.
She sighed and let her head fall onto her crossed arms on the desk. “Why am I putting up with this?”
flowing away, Tony’s hand pressed to his neck, the statue’s eyes staring at him in wonder and confusion and something that seemed to be love. Steve felt an emptiness inside him growing, threatening to swallow him whole, and he reached for Tony’s shoulders and screamed his name, trying to ground himself -
Strange paced slowly around the circle, but Steve could only stare at the stone statue sitting perfectly still in the middle, slouched on the chapel’s front steps.
If he imagined Tony lying in the bed next to him - well, it’s not like anybody else could judge him for it, if they didn’t know. Right?
“It’s just- I thought he was Clint, and I figured it would be safer if a couple other people know how to switch it off, just in case.”
. “Four more attacks. One caught by the city guards, the other two by some of ours. They followed standard procedure,” - meaning, Tony knew, Iron Man’s signature marks had been left at every scene - “-but they seem to be coming more often. The last two were only a day apart. I don’t think the Crown even knows how many attacks there have been, what with you being missing…”
, that he cried and begged and grieved when it became clear that Tony was getting worse. That the curse was making him slow down, making him forget, slowly robbing him not only of the movement that used to
, let alone cared about him. The stone angel had a perpetual frown of confusion etched between his brows. Telling him he loved him would only confuse him more.
He recognised that handwriting. He tried not to think of Steve reliving Bucky’s final day and focused on the running total at the bottom of the page.
“What he means to say-” someone interrupted. The crowd startled and turned as one to find Stephen Strange stalking toward the front of the room, expression stern and fixed on the prince. “- is that he is innocent. So sorry I’m late. Last minute preparations, you know.” He paused, taking in the woman, and his face softened slightly. “I’m deeply sorry for your loss.”
There was a hole in Tony’s chest, exactly where he was meant to do compressions, and Steve choked back a sob, hands hovering. “Tell me what to do!” he begged. “What do I do!? How do I fix this!?”
He sat atop the castle walls, watching as the King stole quietly down toward the gate and was allowed in by Stark’s butler. Clint would have followed him, but he reasoned that even royalty were entitled to privacy now and then.
She shrugged, amused. “You’ve been trying to get rid of Hammer for years; I feel like my job is safe. So, is there any other reason you’re here, or are you just taking up my valuable sleeping time? Because let me tell you, if you’re about to ask me to take you down to the archives room I’m gonna be
He was struck with a sudden pang of nostalgia. He and Bucky had sat on these stairs together too many times to count as children, playing simple games and enjoying the quiet peace of the castle at night. Tonight clouds were rolling in from the horizon, an occasional flicker of light betraying an oncoming storm, but the sky above was still clear.
“I hid. I was too scared to do anything, just stayed behind the ship and watched him disappear into the night, and then I went onto the ship, and found bodies. Found her. She’d been trying to protect some kid, I think. The heir to a foreign noble’s home. The Winter Soldier had run her through. I… I tried to save her. I did everything I could think of to bring her back, but she was already gone.”
“Steve, hold on-” he tried to dart around him, but the king latched an arm around the armour and threw him backward.
Natasha eyed him suspiciously when he asked for a shift change, but he was a model employee who rarely asked for anything, so she granted it.
The other victims did the same, before they became solid statues entirely. Before they crumbled to dust.
Clint shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “Tony-” he said, but he grimaced, shook his head, and continued in sign. [Bruce says Tony made my hearing aids with magic. When he died, they stopped working. I notice it most when I talk.]
He had analysed this place a thousand times, and he did it again now; a strange field, filled with stones that read names Tony could remember with infinite clarity but couldn’t tie to any specific memory. Clean iron gates, and a cracked concrete road beyond; strange, sleek things hurtling down the road, tantalisingly mysterious and so ready to be taken
“Not necessarily. I can affirm that, up until very recently, he has been under an extremely powerful controlling spell. I would argue that Barnes and the Winter Soldier are two entirely separate entities that happened to temporarily share a body. I do not doubt that your witnesses have true stories to tell - but I would argue that a more useful line of enquiry would be to examine Barnes to see if he does, in fact, have the amount of magic we would expect from the Winter Soldier.”
He put it back in, and threw another handful of seeds, and told himself that he wasn’t angry at Stark for giving him something and taking it away without warning. That all his pain came from Tony’s death.
The woman looked at Bucky for the first time, assessing. “… No,” she said. “I’d seen the prince before, I suppose. Everyone has. He moved differently The Winter Soldier was… he was stiff. He moved almost like a puppet.” She hesitated. “The arm, though. I could never forget that arm.”
“Oh come now-” Hammer said, and as she slammed the door she imagined his head between it and the door jamb.
“I am a morning person. I like mornings.” He brushed their lips together, too blissfully sleepy to kiss him properly and so completely at peace that he couldn’t imagine ever wanting to go anywhere else. “I am particularly enjoying this one.”
He sighed, giving up for the day. There was no point pushing it. He put it with the others - the growing pile of works that were missing the
The makeshift workstation Strange had set up in his compound wasn’t elegant at all - it comprised mostly of mismatched arcane artifacts and instruments he and Banner had scavenged from the royal workshop, a mess of magic and technology that frankly ruined his carefully maintained aesthetic. It wasn’t meant to be permanent, which helped. There was the matter of urgency, too, of not knowing how long he had before it was too late and the slim window he had at his disposal to finish the ritual closed for good.
She scowled at him and pulled her notes back to her chest. “I’m not wrong. They’re a hive mind, I’m telling you-”
Tony trailed off, an odd tone to his voice. Steve reached across and took his hand. “Promise me you’ll stay in the city.”
It was another two days before the scouts announced that the approaching army was a single day’s march from the city.
“Of course.” He glanced back at the door as Bruce slipped through and held the door open. A woman carrying a heavy-looking box followed. “If you don’t mind, I’d really rather like to set the tone of our defense before more witnesses are brought forward. Our case may change court proceedings slightly.” He flashed an apologetic smile at the woman who had provided her account. “Though I’m sure their stories are vitally important, I’m not entirely sure they are going to be necessary.”
His eyes landed on the shield, glinting innocently where it had fallen after Steve’s last throw went astray.
It wasn’t until he banked hard toward the portal that he spotted the familiar red, white and blue armour. The king had made it to the rock platform upon which the portal’s machine stood, and was clearly trying to shut the damn thing off before he was discovered. It was a harebrained scheme, a suicide mission, and Tony swore to himself as he put on another burst of speed just as the portal flickered and disappeared.
“I’m sorry,” Tony gasped, trying to ignore the feeling of fire spreading under his skin. He dropped the device, momentarily alarmed at the way his hands were glowing a faint, sinister red. He concentrated, and the red faded away. “But I can solve everything-”
Bucky grimaced. “He’s torn between suspectin’ me of treason and thinkin’ I’m a victim. Not much conversation to be had between the two of them.”
“I promised,” Steve said. “I promise you, Tony, we will fix this. Strange said he’s close. Just… don’t forget, Tony.”
“Not a word,” she whispered, frowning a little. He pulled another box from the shelf and started leafing through that too.
And he remembered the curse. The first few victims; the moment they realised Loki was trying to copy a monster from a British TV show; remembered his search for the relic Strange had described that seemed capable of reversing the spell. Remembered diving in front of Steve to save him, taking the flash of light and the lethal blow, remembered crashing hard and almost bleeding out even before the spell could turn his flesh to stone.
Tony thought very hard, and a memory appeared, sharp and clear and somehow painful. He remembered a location, a place he had been to before, an object that he thought would solve everything, and it was that place that he thought of as he finally leant forward and brushed stone lips against soft ones. He let a hand caress the man’s neck; let a thumb brush along the man’s jaw; set a palm to rest under his ear, where it fit like it was meant to be there.
“Nuh-uh.” He rolled just enough to pin Tony between him and the back of the couch. Tony made a small noise that was somewhere between a laugh and a huff of irritation. “Staying.”
“That’s. Okay. Fuck. That’s bad news. Shit. That’s really bad news. Um.” Tony stared at the things he was holding, almost puzzled to find they were there. He climbed down from the ladder and let them tumble haphazardly onto the workbench. “Okay.”
“Let the court recognise,” Carol began, and paused as the last of the commotion fizzled away. She surveyed the room proudly, an eyebrow arched. “Let the court recognise that James Buchanan Barnes, heir to the crown, has been brought to trial for the following charges. Treason. Espionage. 132 counts of murder-”
Tony glowered and shifted back in his chair, the bandages that covered his chest shifting into view, the softly glowing sigils marked on them glittering in the firelight. “I shattered the core.”
Steve’s throat hurt when he talked, so he trailed off into a whisper when he asked Tony for just one more hint.
“So I keep telling people,” Tony replied. He put her notes carefully atop the desk and frowned at the top page. “But somehow, against all odds, he’s still here.”
, and suddenly he had them instead of me. He left behind the exact amount I had before. He musta planned it all.” Finally, he met Steve’s eyes. ”It would have killed him within hours. He knew that. But he did it anyway, to make sure I would be proven innocent.”
Tony’s breath stuttered, then stopped. Steve shook his shoulders, slightly, feeling the panic rising, but completely at a loss as to what he should do. There had been field first aid training at some point, but he couldn’t remember what the steps were - something about checking airways, checking breathing, CPR-
It shouldn’t have been endearing, but the almost child-like expressiveness behind the pose was irresistible, and Steve tried to commit it to memory so he could draw it in his break. When the place was empty he doodled on an unused paperbag, trying to capture the
he would be now. Oh god, Steve had only just started to recover from his last awakening. To think that Tony had put him through it again-
He knew that Marvel’s protectors were capable and strong. He knew that hundreds of civilians had volunteered to stay and protect their kingdom. He knew that all estimates of their and their enemy’s numbers promised an easy victory for Marvel, and that the refugees we was watching wind toward the city games would shortly return to their city-
“No.  Kisses are very intimate.  I don’t want to have to leave you and orgasm tonight, so we’re cuddling once we’re in bed.” He informed Tony, taking the towel from around him to dry himself off.  Once he was finished, he folded both the towels back up and hung them on the rail.  “Do you want to sleep naked together tonight, baby?” he asked as he tugged Tony through into the bedroom, their fingers knitted together tightly.
“I love the feel of you,” he whispered, moving forwards so their lips were close to one another’s. “I think my new favorite thing is to have you between my hands,” palms skimming forward to knead over the blades of Tony’s hips, Steve used his hands to roll over the shape and dimensions of Tony’s form. He was smoothing, caressing, worshipping every inch of skin he could find. This was their form of sex and he was making sure it was taken as seriously as sexually pleasing a partner.
Steve didn’t witness the blush in its full bloom as it grew on Tony’s cheeks. He did, however, feel the small tuck and cuddle Tony gave him afterwards. He watched Tony walk off the embarrassment, before getting off the bed, undoing his zip he popped the button of his jeans before wiggling out of them. He pulled back the cover of the bed peering into the mattress and throw pillow pile. It looked to die for. Rolling between the sheets he felt like he was swimming in velvet.
you won’t leave me. I need to trust you’re going to be able to read my signs too. If I say no, it’s a no,” he affirmed. “I would like to end this conversation here. This firm since it’s clear you are straining over sharing this so soon. I appreciate you’re trying to make communication clear but I am not ready to discuss my experiences the way you are. It may take me a very long time to do so.” He warned, trying to be as clear as possible. “I would rather choose when to open up to you, rather than be forced into doing so, I recognize that may not be the best for you so if a simple explanation of what I don’t like is enough can we leave it at that?”
Steve couldn’t help but laugh at the robot as it was learning. “Holy shit! Would you look at that!” Steve pointed at the robot. “Jesus it’s so cute, they’re like a less messy child,” Steve exclaimed, “and you made that, right?” He took a seat on the floor simply watching Dummy work.
Tony smiled at the reference, but was feeling a little too vulnerable to laugh. “It helps. With the trust. To prove you won’t run off at the first sign of trouble.” He took another bite, chewing thoughtfully. “I have meds,” he answered after a long moment. “But I don’t take them if I’ve been drinking. So that cuts down on the effectiveness. I’m an alcoholic too. And I’m not at all into sex for myself. I use it for the skin contact or making someone else happy and that’s about it.”
Steve snorted. “You like that pet name huh? How come?” He asked playfully, moving so that he could wrap his arms around Tony and pull him closer. “I just figured if I used it too often you would grow to hate it.”
Steve laughed at Tony’s stubbornness. “Sorry,” he apologized to Pepper. “I tried. He’s just too scary like this. I’ll have to give in or face some serious consequences,” Steve grinned at Tony, a playfulness sparkling in his eyes.
“Fuck, sorry, I’m sorry. I’m… I’m being dramatic. I swear I don’t mean to be, I’m just… I didn’t think… I’d ever have a soulmate. And then I convinced myself, but… Fuck, you start shouting at your friend like that when you see a celebrity on the street, too? That was… All kinds of awful. No, I don’t want to meet your friend. Especially if he’s gonna be Stark-struck too. Just… Let’s go enjoy the movie? Maybe we won’t miss it?” He looked mournfully at the poor trampled flowers and reluctantly pulled away from Steve. He did feel exposed, but he wanted to run–not hide.
“What do you mean you have to touch?” Steve asked incredulously, bewildered and confused. As Tony began to head off, Steve doggedly followed. “Did you just insinuate that you-?” He asked shocked. He’d expected a lady. He was sure that the man he could ever love was Bucky.
“Much smaller? Like how small are we talking? ‘Cause when he was sixteen he quoted Pulp Fiction when he orgasmed during our first time having sex.”
“Jesus, that’s so cute.” She leaned against Bucky’s side supportively, but her eyes scanned Steve and she could tell he was uncomfortable.  “Maybe embarrassing or adorable stories about Steve aren’t the best way to bond.  I’m sure you know about their history, right?” she asked Tony, before leaning out to take his hand.  “Come on, I promise this will get easier, we’ll go sit in the living room and you can tell Bucky and I a little about yourself so we can get to know you.”
“They like being close to people and being told they’ve done good,” he told Steve with a smile. “They really really are like puppies.” Butterfingers triumphantly brought back the ball and Tony rubbed her arm again while he told her how well she’d done. Dummy, curious and feeling neglected, beeped inquisitively and moved closer to Steve.
“Everyone I know with a soulmate touched before the timer ended. I’m pretty sure that’s common knowledge. It’s just how that works.” He was a little worried now, honestly, but he couldn’t very well go into a room full of kids like this--half-way to an anxiety attack with this guy following him.
“You’re not a mess. I mean, maybe a little. It looks like you got sprayed by a passing car. Happens when you stand right on the edge like that.” He wasn’t really sure he wanted Steve touching him like this, but he couldn’t bring himself to pull his hand away.
At Tony’s protests to Pepper’s wish to clean his clothes Steve smirked, “I don’t think he intends to have me wearing much today, but thank you,” he eased, trying to diffuse the tension with his easy smile and manners.
"You’re not going to lose me. I know it is going to take you time to understand that. But, you are mine. You said it before. Maybe part of the problem is because you don’t know how possessive I can be in return. I am not the type of person to dedicate myself to you, call you my soulmate and then run away at the drop of a hat. I see so much depth to you, I want to roll around in it and bury myself in it. I promise I am not going to ask you to jump into anything. I need to trust you--not that you won’t leave me. I
Steve hissed a sharp intake of air. “Oh god. I love tight jeans on beautiful men,” Steve half whimpered. “Mmm- sure I’m so down for that. There’s something really hot about having to restrain myself,” Steve laughed kissing the slope of Tony’s shoulder. “You’d look to die for in tight jeans.” Steve grinned making sure not to push too much in case it sounded like he was pestering for sexual contact. “So yes, I think jeans and a shirt would be fine.” Steve nodded.
Steve didn’t answer immediately. “this shouldn’t be about me,” he sighed. “I’m glad you’ve drank less today than you usually would, it means a lot to me that helping you feel better actually has an effect on the amount you need, that is good news.” He swept Tony’s fringe off his face, leaning forward to kiss the tip of his nose. “You’re doing good I promise, I’m just scared about you feeling pressured to do something you aren’t fully consenting to. My fears shouldn’t invalidate any progress you make though. I haven’t upset you have I?”
“We’ll definitely sink into it and it’ll be amazing.” He hugged Steve back and smiled against his chest. “Are you ready for bed? The bathroom’s through there. I probably don’t have anything that’ll fit you, but we can look. Not that I’d protest all the great skin contact if you just slept in your underwear.”
“Sure sweetheart, you’re welcome to transfer the files, I find it touching you want to keep them,” he kissed Tony on the cheek gesturing to his seat and then pulling it out a little for him before handing him his phone.
“It was… I’m just bad at names, I guess. But he won’t respond to anything else now, so it’s stuck.” Butterfingers rolled over with their ball, chirping in greeting, and Tony rubbed his hands down her arm affectionately before tossing it across the workshop. “Go fetch, guys. It’s over there!” He pointed, then smiled at Steve as they wheeled away.
“Oh, but those stories aren’t actually embarrassing they’re just cute.” Bucky replied, it seemed as if he’d been enlightened and as Nat stirred the teas for them, Bucky chose another story.
Steve knew exactly what was wrong. He moved round the table, reaching his hands out to pull Tony into a hug. “Okay, okay. I’m fine now but you’re not so come on. Just get it out of your system. Clearly you don’t really react well to me needing touch distance. You haven’t done anything wrong and it wasn’t a punishment. It was temporary.” His grip on Tony was loose, so that Tony could move if he wanted. “I promise you’re still doing amazing and its okay to cry in public Tony. I’m not going to shame you for it.”

“You have better things to do than laundry,” Tony clarified, though he smiled at Steve’s response. “I’ll get the stuff done tomorrow.”
He didn’t run late, mostly because he was too focused on that night to get distracted by the fun kids’ science that could normally draw him in. So he showed up at Steve’s place right at six, driving one of his flashier sports cars and wearing a gorgeous and expensive dark suit. He might’ve been a mess earlier, but everything about him looked smooth and put-together now, including the bouquet of roses he’d tucked under one arm so he could knock.
“Why would it be a problem?” he asked. “What about people being attracted to you? How do you feel about that? I’m bisexual… with a high sex drive. Do you get the impulse to have sex at all? Are you sex repulsed? What’s your romanticism?”
Tony watched him speak like he was some kind of savior and then nodded shakily, half-smiling. He was at least ninety percent sure that he was madly in love with this man he met eighteen hours ago. All those fairy tales with princes marrying their soulmates after an hour made a lot more sense now.
Steve was grateful that Tony didn’t push. He wouldn’t have been able to restrain himself much longer. Nodding to Tony he rolled his shoulders utter a gentle ‘fuck’ to himself in awe of how little it took from to have him hook, line and sinker.
“Some people don’t need a reason not to–they need a reason to.” As soon as the cameras started, the owner was out, giving the people a choice between leaving immediately or deleting the photos, and Tony remembered all over again why he liked this place.
Steve sighed contentedly.  It sounded wonderful when it was said by him.  “Mmn, thank you, baby,” he praised, his thumbs catching on Tony’s lace panties before pushing them down.  “I’m just gonna wash you, baby.  You don’t need to worry.” He moved away from Tony to start the shower head, adjusting the temperature so it was just right.  Stepping into the shower, letting the water roll over him, Steve held his hand out to help Tony in.
Steve soon woke up when he heard all the commotion. He wasn’t fully aware, still half away with the fairies because it took him so long to wake up. However, he sensed Tony was being reprimanded because of him. And as new as they were together, he suddenly got very territorial over who could talk to him and in what tone they chose to.
Steve burst out laughing, “Excuse me I’m always gonna be big spoon. No jet-packing allowed in this relationship,” there was a playful smirk to the edge of his laughter as he reached forward to switch the screen on. Searching for and selecting Back to the Future, Steve threw the remote down back into the basket, practically tackling Tony to the sofa. “My favorite cuddles always have me as big spoon, so that’s what we’re gonna do,” he sassed, positioning himself behind Tony, one arm holding his head up so he could see the television, the other resting over Tony’s waist.
“If I can’t share in your passions, would you share in mine?” He asked, looking over to Tony before back out of the windshield.
“Maybe,” Steve replied. “Moment’s gotta be right. Maybe wait for something cheesy to happen.” He gave Tony a wink. “I mean if you look up the definition of cheese, there’s just my face. Just don’t try to grate me onto any dishes you know,” he joked dorkily, placing Tony down on the sofa.
sexuality he was getting wound up about. He calmed himself down, centering himself, and he turned to Tony as he parked.
“I happen to think red would go amazingly well with your skin tone. Definitely a sight my eyes are interested in seeing.” He took another bite of lasagna. He focused on cutting the food with intense precision. It should be fine, he told himself, as long as Tony wasn’t actually in the lingerie in front of him he should be able to squash the feeling filling his stomach.
Steve chuckled, pulling Tony to him, Steve gave Tony three consecutive kisses to his forehead.  “You can have three,” he teased, moving Tony round so that when he crowded Tony far enough he fell backwards against the mattress.  Steve instantly started playfully kissing and nibbling at Tony’s neck.  It was devoid of careful attention and precision, but it was fun, to make Tony laugh and feel cared for rather than to bring him any sensual or sexual pleasure.  Finishing up, Steve nudged the skin he’d playfully mouthed at before wriggling under the covers.  Sighing, he took a deep breath.  He felt so relaxed, it was positively amazing.
“I’m Tony,” he said before Steve could give up on him and leave. He would almost definitely regret this, but he didn’t think he could stop now. “I really am sorry. If I’d known… I do clean up nice. You look like you really deserved something romantic.”
Steve nodded to Tony. He was used to orange, but now he knew Tony usually used yellow he could look out for that too in case Tony forgot. “People touch so often but they barely realize how much you can say with a soft caress,” he agreed. “I would like to kiss whilst we do this, is that okay?” He brought his hands to the base of Tony’s neck simply playing with the hairs and sensitive skin there.
“I’m excited to be here, sugar bean.” Tony grabbed his telescope because it was worth a couple thousand dollars and he didn’t think Steve needed his car broke into, and squeezed Steve’s hand back.  “Am I meeting people now, or in the morning?” It was pretty late, but if Steve’s roommates were likely to meet them at the door, he wanted a heads up.
Tony pulled away like he’d been burned before forcing himself to relax again. "Yeah, that’s okay.” He moved back to his side and focused on his food, eating with less enthusiasm than he normally would, but still trying to enjoy it. This was his fault for pushing just now but Steve said that he was okay with pushy and he probably just needed the rest of breakfast to adjust and come to terms with things before going and meeting his friends.
“I’m not denying that I’ve been raped, Steve,” Tony responded, more serious now. “I’ve been forced into things I didn’t want, I’ve been pushed past my limits, I’ve been blackmailed and emotionally manipulated, and I’ve had my safeword ignored. I have a different safeword now, which helps, but… I’m damaged goods. Trust is gonna be hard. I’ve used cages and rings. I prefer the cages, but it’s still something that I don’t want to do right away with you. I want the intimacy, but. I don’t know when I’ll really be ready for it.” He squeezed Steve’s hands. “Are you okay with that?”
