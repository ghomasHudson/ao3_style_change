It’s been an hour since his last orgasm, the time between waves lengthening as the Heat went on. Steve blinks owlishly at Tony, a quick glance and then a nod as he buries himself back in the blankets.
Clint sighs, and shuffles back just enough so that his back is touching Steve’s chest. Of course, Omegas seek contact whenever they’re hurt, which Steve takes as a good sign and wraps his arm around Clint’s body again.
“You’re very sweet. Too sweet. I can’t imagine where he might have picked you up. Tony’s not very good at separating business from pleasure. ” There’s biting realization when it clicks into place, the implications Pepper was pushing forth. It wasn’t odd, he should have expected something like this to happen, the stranger that he was. A week of heat wasn’t going to change that.
“Oh come on, don’t be like that. I’m your owner now, we’ll get along eventually, so why not start now?”
That night, Bucky finally clambers into his bed, tucking Steve right over his arm, with another wrapped protectively over him. Steve’s head still feels too heavy from the fever, but he smiles through the delirium. It’s a small moment of clarity, or at least, he can understand the words that are coming out of Bucky’s mouth.
He’s thought about it, for a while, why it was he was still here (alive). Why did people insist on helping him.
Tony shakes his head, his expression fond. “Nothing. Making sure you didn’t go feral on me again.” He says with such kindness that makes Steve feel warm.
“Don’t just stand there,” Tony says after a while, voice softer, a little more tired. Steve isn’t entirely sure how long he’s been standing, but he finds himself being pulled closer to Tony regardless, finding himself directed to the seat Tony motions to.
And it’s with cold realization, that Steve understands why Clint chose him. Because Captain America can keep a man like Hawkeye in check, can hold him down and get him subdued. Because Captain America has seen the way that Hawkeye fights, and knows he can overpower him if needs be. Because Hawkeye knows that Captain America can kill him, if he thinks he’s falling back into Loki’s control.
“You need not tease. I know why it is you wish me in this form.” Stevos admits with a sigh, shoulders slumping down in defeat.
"So sweet for me. Of course you are." Tony purrs, lifts his good hand to cup Steve's chin. He holds his breath, feels Tony's finger play with his neck, eyes wide as he looks into Tony's eyes, warm and kind. "How'd I get so lucky?"
It's hazy through the drugs, prickly and uneven, but he can pick out the summer breeze and sunshine that permeates through all that, still vibrant as ever.
The door opens for him without a knock, which is, huh? He would think that Tony’s security wouldn’t be so slack.
, even if he did only believe in one God, he can’t deny that both Loki and Thor aren’t from their world.
Steve isn’t ignorant. He knows that Fury has been testing him ever since he’d woken up. It’s a startling discovery as to how in depth they’ve studied his life, from where he grew up to his exact list of ailments. His life, or at least previous life, had been studied, investigated, re-studied, and then published in books.
Bucky laughs, all hollow and morose. “Y’think yer Ma woulda approved of this? Swear to God, Steve, she’d be rolling in her grave if she knew what you were thinking there.”
His body was going through pre-Heat preparation, having him pack in enough food to burn for when his Heat really starts. So that when an Alpha actually did come around, he would have enough energy and stamina to keep the Alpha interested. It also meant that, based on the amount of food he could consume, his heat would prolong, taking the sign of bountiful food as a perfect place to settle down.
“Well, he is half my age.” Steve provides, bemused. The nervousness had dwindled down somewhat, replaced instead by dread of what was to come next. Clint and Natasha do an awful good job of keeping his spirits high, clearly taking this
Steve knows that, if he were to try to break free from Tony's hold, he would be let go without another word. In the dim light of his room, there's a sorrow he can see in Tony's eyes, a mixture of sad understanding and concern. The hand on his chest isn't so much a warning, as it was there to remind Steve that he wasn't alone.
I feel the need to tell you all that this story is canon compliant, as I might have missed saying so. I wrote a particularly long comment on my view of Stony (at least in this fic) on chapter 4 if anyone else might be curious about it.
Grateful, Steve places a hand on Tony’s torso, a quiet thank you, tracing the smooth planes of scars and muscle before speaking.
“Who does?” Steve plays along, plucking the drink from Clint as he tries to get him to sit up straight.
“The one time she gets the easy job, she’s already complaining.” He grumbles as they take a flight of stairs deeper into the building.
But for now he smiles, and salutes, like a good soldier. Because whether or not Tony believes it, he is one of Steve’s men.
“It’s fine. Thank you.” Steve smiles back, with some fondness, knowing Ernie only means well, is soft at heart at most times and it’s just the way he is.
He crawls away like he’s been burned, suddenly taking the far end of the bed with wary eyes still stuck on Tony. There's a collar around his neck, dark leather of some kind, clipped to a chain that's shackled to the bed.
“Holy fuck, I take it back. You’re straight up the devil.” Tony gasps, eyes still on him but Steve can tell Tony’s brain is elsewhere. “Come here, lie down.”
“Just a reminder.” Tony shakes his head in some form of apology, but Steve can see a smile play up on his lips as the Alpha turns and heads off to do his project.
“Not unless you want to be.” Tony answers quickly. “Otherwise, I will defend your honor and stave away these dastardly fiends.”
“I know. I just thought I should remind you that I can take care of myself, even from jerks like Hammer.”
“I-I changed my m-mind.” He whispers. “I wanna stay with you, Mama. W-Why can’t I-I sta-a-a-y with you? I w-w-wanna stay.” He feels the tell-tale pinpricks in his eyes.
“Coulson probably thought you’d be comfortable with someone of some shared experience.” Natasha provides insightfully.
“I think this should be our last training session.” Natasha says while they’re doing their post-workout stretches.
Steve takes a couple bites of the food that Frank has ordered for the both of them, out of politeness, before he crosses his utensil and looks pointedly at the Alpha. “I’m not coming home with you to fuck.”
“I wanted to do this all night.” Tony groans, burying his head in Steve’s chest, nuzzling into his pecs.
words of annoyance and assertion, he had the Beta shaking in his palm. No doubt the man had been quaking in his leather shoes when Tony mentioned never coming back.
He’d been so sure that the Alpha would claim him, bite him, mark him, make him his. It’s what he’d expected when they’d brought him to that place, to that stage and showed him to all those hungry eyes. Tony had been no different, he’d seen those eyes when the man had told him he had won, there was hunger there too. He could tell in that small room where he’d been stripped naked and laid there for the Alpha, of what he was meant for.
Stevos at least has the capacity to look ashamed. “Your brashness will kill you someday. You know this and yet you charge in so recklessly.”
“Being gay is totally fine Steve. I mean, I’d hit that no matter my presentation.” Tony offers in counter argument.
“So what, you just hang around wherever?” This was all amazing and it fed Tony’s curiosity, unless Tony was going insane then he was going to have to start worrying about imagining all this.
Tony places his hands on Steve's shoulders, grasping and clawing, and yet holding back on the imperative to thrust into that delicious heat. So instead, Steve takes in his deeper, Tony’s cock pushing against the roof of his mouth in one fell swoops, slipping past his throat and gags on it.
“Oh please, if you’re calling this nothing then it’s the same as calling last night nothing. SO how about this. You tell me what’s bugging you, and I tell you what’s bugging you.”
It works, Phil sighs in defeat. Steve has to carefully maintain feeling miserable to make sure that Phil doesn’t catch on to his glee.
A high-level Alpha could in fact be entitled to two Omegas or more in certain cultures, provided that the Alpha could provide for them both. A scrap of information Steve had thought irrelevant, but now shed some light to the situation.
His surrounding turns cold, shards prickling against his skin as liquid turns solid in mere seconds. Suddenly there's ice all around him, pressing hard against his body, the water in his veins turns sharp. He's being torn, the ice trying to get in, and the ice inside him trying to get out, uncaring of the barrier of skin and muscle.
“I know.” Tony all but growls at him. “But that phone is only worth it’s weight in scraps to me. So keep the damn phone, it's better with you than with me.”
“Still a little feral? Do you understand what I’m saying?” Tony’s voice turns tender as he brushes his hand over Steve bangs, looking down at him with a softness that Steve has come to know these past few days. Steve nods, embarrassed that Tony has to see him like this.
He was picking out an Alpha from a list instead of meeting them because of who he was. Because S.H.I.E.L.D. wasn’t going to reveal him
The yelling only seems to get louder, they must be searching high and low for him, it would only be a matter of time before he is found.
That catches him off guard. The Beta must get it a lot from other Omegas because she continues on without so much as a look. “We’d like to know in advance, you see? Some Alphas don’t like having an Omega in heat, a lot more of a handful and finicky. They just come here for a good time. But some don’t mind having an Omega for a day or two, somewhere on the tailend when it’s starting to fade.”
Tony frowns at that. He resents Howard, always had ever since their first disagreements and when Howard would always say he wouldn’t understand anything because he was just a kid. Even when he grew up, following so closely to Howard’s footsteps, his old man still regarded him with such disdain that it was a while before he stopped blaming himself and started blaming Howard.
“Unfortunately, Justin, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Steve says, let’s the icy anger seep into his tone, a frown of disapproval at Justin.
But the god only seems to bristle, brows knit together. His eyes seem to delve deeper, looking at Tony but not entirely seeing in front of him, like he’s trying to parse his thoughts and connect Tony to them all the same.
“Sir was able to have a five hour deep sleep cycle after you had brought him to his room. Prior to that, deep sleep had not been achieved, resulting to an average of four point seven hours of sleep within a thirty six hour time cycle, normally broken between five naps.”
“You’ve found a cure.” Stevos says hopefully, dragging the large suitcase into the makeshift projection room.
Their hair, their skin, the color of their eyes. There was beauty in each of them, an innocence that makes them mystifying. Even Tony, and his limited attention to all and anything Omega, is captivated by the sight of them. He can almost imagine bringing one home for his beck and call. Having an Omega was a privilege that only Alphas had, a responsibility that eluded Betas, as such they were highly regarded possessions and flaunted an Alpha’s status over the general population.
be an actress.” She shoots right back, like a child who’d been promised candy. “It’s just taking some time. For the mean time, it wouldn’t hurt to
“Yeah, yeah, I know that. What I meant to say was that J told me you were asking if it was possible for you to have your own house. So, were you planning to move somewhere?”
Tony snarls at him, and Steve breaks eye contact. He knows he can take him, wrestle him to the ground if necessary, but this was Tony, the least Steve could do was try. So even when Tony presses his face to Steve’s neck without permission, Steve lets him, remains pliant while the Alpha performs his check on him. He can’t imagine what Tony would be like if he had brought his shield.
“Not about that, y’shouldn’t hafta do something like that for us.” Bucky just shakes his head, slumps onto a wooden stool that they usually use for painting. “Cus you’re worth more than that, Steve. It’s ain’t a decent living. And it’s dangerous.”
That stung. Enough to make Steve back down a step and allow Tony an inch into his space. “Am I one of those things too?”
’ but emphasized on permission and place, the do-er casting themselves to the lowest position and humbly asking. It was a child’s gesture, because children didn’t present yet, didn’t quite know what was allowed or not, so if they wanted to ask nicely for something, they’d have to do the gesture. As the child matures, they’d understand what was allowed and base their decisions from there, and thus abandon the innocent gesture.
Steve’s jaws tighten, hyper aware of the fact that Tony was halfway off his seat, trying to tower over him. Steve’s eyes go half-lidded, a frown on his lips as he sinks in his seat.
Phil seems to take his lack of complaint as a good sign. “Being taken care of. It’s a short-term renewable contract, with your permission. You have nothing to worry about, I will
“If you call for me, I will hear it.” Is all Stevos says, which isn’t a yes, but isn’t a no as well, and Tony let’s that be.
This is probably not the story that people want me working on, but I got so enraptured by this setting that I haven't really worked on anything else.
Tony strips Stevos’s cock efficiently until the god is also coming, semen spurting all the way to his chin, flecks of it covering his chest while the rest pools over his abs.
It makes him smile anyway, because now he knows a little better, and it was embarrassing moments that have built him up and rounded him off. Thanks to them, he wasn’t so green anymore, and he’s learned to deal with people with the patience his Ma had tried to instill in him.
He unpacks what little he has, resting his shield by the bed, and lays on the comforter with his hands to his chest.
The Agent (Phil) doesn’t exactly chase after him, a tight frown as he watches Clint take off, but Steve notices the little twitch in his body that might have meant he would have gone on after Clint if something weren’t keeping him here. So instead, he’s met with a steel-gray eyes of the Beta, looking as though he can barely contain his excitement.
“You weren’t suppose to do that well, considering this is the first time you’ve seen me fight. who taught you to move like that?” Her face doesn’t give her away, but he can smell the adrenaline and tightly controlled disappointment from her.
"There's a doctor I want to meet. Says she has tech that can help revolutionize medical achievements by leaps and bounds. And you know how I am with technological revolutionaries."
He’s mad, anger and frustration deep in his mind that he stalks off, screws open a bottle of scotch to get him through the night.
He grits his teeth when yet another simulation fails to show him viable replacements for the arc reactor. He’s had JARVIS running them in the background, whatever RAM he can spare that wouldn’t undermine the rest of his computations, but they’ve all come back negative.
“You wanted me to pick an Omega, right?” Tony smirks, all bravado still, looks to Howard. “Well, I pick him.”
Stevos's throat constricts around him, convulsing as the god takes him without choking. It’s all too much, Tony pulls out, coming all over Stevos’s face, rubbing the head of his cock onto that slippery tongue, until it feels like every drop of cum has been wrung out from his body.
“Oh, of course.” Stevos exclaims, but Tony can see that adorable little blush darkening the god’s pale skin. He wants nothing more than to see if that blush goes all the way down if it weren’t for his injuries.
The pair of Alphas play with his ass for what Steve feels like is for hours, alternating their movements so that Steve can’t expect anything, not with the way Andrew’s thinner longer fingers curl all over the place, curious and almost frantic, and Ed’s thicker digits are relentlessly getting him stretched.
Stevos answers by pinching him on the thigh, and chuckles when Tony yelps. “Even gods have to abide by some rules. You still have so much to do, you have so many plans already in your mind, and I would be too much of distraction to you if I was around all the time.” He continues while he washes Tony’s hair with shampoo, those fingers heavenly on his scalp.
“Oh.” Tony grins sheepishly at him. “I mean. Your heat and all. I thought you might have found someone else to help you with it.” The grudging tone goes noticed.
And it turns into just that, a marathon of how much they can shake Steve apart. He’s almost grateful that he isn’t required to speak during it all.
For him, it isn’t the same, the energy is there, pumped into his system at a moment’s notice, but unlike other people, he can go on for a couple more days, a sort of restlessness settles upon him when that is the case.
It all seems so trivial when he knows he’s going to die, but he doesn’t want to give them the satisfaction of being whittled down.
“It was fine. I turned out an Alpha, high-level, like he wanted. Heaven forbid I present otherwise. Alpha, leader of the pack, heir to the Stark throne. It was perfect, wasn’t it?” (Steve hates that word.
Instinctively, he runs a hand over the man’s hair, placating, comforting, the stink of Clint’s distress like a haze over them. Clint doesn’t utter another sound, but Steve can feel the wetness on his chest, where Clint hides, seeping onto his shirt.
The god, there’s no other word for it, keels over, a thin wrist thrown over his eyes, panting to catch his breath.
( JARVIS later informs him that this is what are called 'grabby hands’ and shows him several different clips when Steve doesn’t believe that it’s a real
Spidery black veins, similar to the ones Tony sports himself, crawls from Stevos’s heart. Long thin lines that are gaunt against his thin chest. There’s no arc reactor, but that only magnifies the problem. On the center of his chest is scarring and dark tissue, like it’s been scratched out and put back together by a blind man, puckered skin and scars that stretch across his chest. Almost like the edges of his arc reactor.
“Steve Rogers. Twenty-one.” He’d filled out forms earlier. His name, age, address, mundane things he doesn’t think they should know anyway, so he might have lied a little on them too. Mostly, he tries to answer the ‘sex’ questions as honestly as possible. Things he’d be willing to do, and things he outright didn’t want to.
pissed off Ironman.” Tony snarls. Steve can see a memory ghosting through his eyes before his expression turns into dark amusement. “They won’t be harassing anyone for a while.”
Stevos is plainly dressed, a smooth white shirt that is deviously stretched along the plains of his chest, and pants that do nothing to hide the perfect form under them. There’s a tired expression on his face, bags under his eyes.
When he makes it down the lab, Tony has his welding gear on, still working on piece of metal that resembles a hand.
The Stark Expo is his attempt to leave his genius as his legacy, a celebration of the technology that is, and has yet to come.
He’s reinforced his chest casing, modified it to be as airtight as can be but it’s not enough. The radiation leak is killing him, torturously slowly, and he’s running out of options.
It is pain like he has never felt before, always there, a constant jab at every moment. He tries to struggle, but he's helpless against it, the cold grasping at every limb until he can't feel the rest of his body anymore. Even his heart doesn't feel as if it's attached to his body anymore, it steady thrum replaced by the creeping cold, replaced with a pain that-
Tony didn’t need him, he was, at most, some pet project to the billionaire, the poor lost Omega that Tony deemed it worth his time for. Because that was Tony, he was nice and kind even if he tried so hard not to show it. Kindness, that Steve had been too desperate for. And he’d taken advantage of that, whilst providing nothing in return.
“I lied, you know.” Tony suddenly admits with a sigh. “Jarvis pinged me the moment it got a distance from your phone tracker. Those guys that took your bike? They got a visit from a very
The way the ‘god’ says it, without a condescending tone that sends a tendril of warmth in Tony. But there must be some kind of catch to this, if there was anything that myths and legends have repeated time and time again, it was that nothing was ever for free.
Steve nods. “We were off-base after a couple of days, but he sent out re-supplies for all of us, including a bunch of modified 1911, a new sniper rifle for Bucky, and coffee that didn’t taste like dirt when we set it to boil. Buck reckoned it was a pretty swell deal for a couple of kisses. Howard was always a little wary of him from then on, and the punk would throw out a kiss at Howard whenever they were in the same room. Made for a couple good laughs.” Steve lets the memory seep in, a stupid moment in time, Howard rushing out of the meeting room, the rest of the boys holding in laughter while Bucky throws them a look of utter mischievous intent and pride.
“It was… More difficult to get out of bed that day.” He’d never wanted to curl in bed and never leave than he did in that moment. Steve takes a shuddery breath to calm himself.
He rolls towards Tony’s side (the left) and lays his head on the pillow. Sweat and lingering scent, Tony can’t have been gone long, his body relaxes as reassurances of
Of course, Tony is covered from head to toe in bruises, his wound bandaged by Steve as best he could. Steve wasn’t entirely convinced that Tony wasn’t concussed but he’d been adamant about being checked.
“I’ll come around during my heat. Won’t know until a week or so though, when slicking starts. I’m not exactly… Regular.” Yet another thing wrong with him.
“My Dad always wanted me to be high-level.” Tony abruptly says, which brings Steve attention back to his voice, though he doesn’t withdraw from Tony’s skin, only turns his head to look at him, cheek firmly pressed to Tony’s arm.
“-awful fucking ass. Pride ain’t gonna do you much good when you’re dead.” Bucky mutters, making sure the blankets are tucked tight around their bodies. “Like hell you’re gonna leave me like this. Like
Tony ruffles the papers out of his hands, takes a picture of the bank numbers and surfs through his personal bank account. “There.” He says after a few moments, shows the Curator the amount and transfer confirmation. “It might take a few minutes for your end to confirm, but you wouldn’t doubt me, would you?” Tony grins.
They didn’t do anything too different today, another hand-to-hand combat simulation with a few other agents so that Natasha could step back to critique his form. He felt good today, looser, a warm ache in his bones that made him feel more intune with his body than he has felt in a while.
“It’s not always a bad thing.” Tony chuckles, touching Steve’s neck again, like couldn’t believe he was allowed. “And anyway, if we were following tradition, I would have been allowed to hurt any other Alpha that came onto you.” Tony growls, pressing his nose to Steve’s neck in a possessive gesture, sucking at a pulse point. It shakes a moan right out of Steve. “Could have marked you, drove off anyone who had bad intentions to you, would have been allowed to protect you.” There’s an extra bite in Tony’s voice, gruff when he speaks.
Loud, almost exaggerated theatre lights burst open, and a sheet of cloth falls to the floor and it’s…
Tony stares at him, a look of surprise. “He means well. Most of the time. No. Uhh. Take whichever side you'd prefer?” Tony lifts his shoulders up and then deflates. “I wasn't kidding though, I'm very busy today. I can't exactly, err, play with you today. Maybe later tonight. We can get the claiming going on just so that you aren't so antsy about it.” Tony adds.
Pepper was Tony’s equal, who could give as much as take, support the billionaire with his endeavors in the way that only she could.
“'M not saying it’s good. Already said it was all fucked up. I don’t have all the answers, can’t speak for people who're too proud to admit when they’re in the wrong but.” Clint frowns. “For other Omegas, it’s not the worst choice.”
It's not Malibu or New York, Steve realizes when he peers out the window of the plane. No bustling streets, no buildings. It's all sprawling meadows and mountain ranges, the thin line of dirt road near indistinguishable, looking straight out of a postcard.
The man is babbling. Excuses, he thinks. His focus still quite isn’t there. He catches words like Silly, Indecent and Omega. Tony is mad at him. Why, Steve can’t tell but he keeps his head low in a submissive gestures and allows himself to be pushed. And then another whiff of strong Alpha pheromones that isn’t Tony. There’s some more arguing, and then he’s being tugged away again, this time with less patience.
Steve just stares at it. He's never been offered a piece of jewelry before. Heat offerings were just that, a gift, some measure, a bribe Steve thinks ashamedly.
“For what?” Steve keeps his tone hushed. They’re out in public, which means there are gossiping ears everywhere, and he hated knowing that people were listening in.
Tony does as he’s told, shuffles his legs wider to allow the god more space to move. With a thrust, Stevos is all the way in, his hole stretched impossibly wide to accommodate his girth.
Steve had gotten a few when he was younger, a bracelet or a ring was common enough, something not too expensive yet the symbolic nature of the gift was there.
Stevos is used to it by now, the snark that Tony hides behind, but it still earns him a frown every now and then, like the god wasn’t sure how to handle him.
It’s for that very reason that he wants to tear Stevos apart, make him feel the pain and frustration that he feels. Make him hurt.
Steve snarls as the scent of another Omega wafts into the room, the soft click of the closing door sounds like a thunderous clap but that doesn’t stop him from baring his teeth to the door, fingers curled into claws.
Steve’s mouth goes dry at the thought of that much money. Money he couldn’t have possibly dreamed about back in the forties. It sounds like an awful lot for one person to have, but then he remember that Tony is a billionaire and it probably sounds like chump change to him.
“But it’s not equal.” Steve finishes for him, sighs in deep, breath heavy in his chest. “Is it still-? Are Omegas still payment?” He didn’t think they were anymore, but. Tonight was a leadup to all the information, of hoping and hoping nots. Omegas still treated like cattle, for trade and stock.
“Of course. Yes.” Even though he feels drained both physically and mentally, the news about Tony felt like a jolt. He leans forward, elbows on his knees. “I can leave first thing tomorrow.”
“One must first be a demi-god, of lineage to a god. And then. A great show of proof. An ultimate sacrifice.” Stevos says after a long time, his beautiful long fingers playing with the tumbler still in his hand.
Tony hears it. Hears years of being told he’s never good enough, not nearly good enough to be with. Too much, Tony, you’re just too much. Suffocating, really, don’t be so clingy. But he swallows that down, tries not to sound like a spoiled brat when he says, “Okay. Yeah, let’s take a break.”
“I know what you need.” His Alpha says, voice dropping a timbre that has Steve nodding for anything.
Not to mention. A killer jawline and tidy short-cropped blonde hair, blue eyes that should be impossible, and plump lips that tempt even the straightest man to kiss.
“No, I’m not leaving you in the mansion alone.” Tony growls, finally staring at him, tablet laid on the table.
Scenting was not an exact science. Even if an Alpha and Omega smelled good to one another, it did mean that they would get along, but at least their instincts knew that they were compatible in some way.
“He does not mean it. He loves you, you know.” Stevos calls after Dummy, pointedly giving Tony a look, which he ignores.
“Put in as much as you’d like. Go ahead. I won’t judge.” Tony chuckles, turning back to the stove, flames flickering off.
Everything feels too heavy for him to think, a dull ache at the back of his mind that demands he closes his eyes, wrap himself up in thick blankets that smell faintly of Tony and let everything blur out.
America, was never developed by anyone, and it was purely by chance that you’ve picked it up at all, isn’t that right?”
“Oh, I uh. I couldn’t wear the necklace all the time. On missions. Nervous I might lose it. Didn’t want to lose it.” Steve fumbles, feeling almost naked now that he was under scrutiny.
“I thought you’d like to decorate yourself.” Tony says, as if reading his mind. “Feel free to buy anything that you like and bring it around. Or have JARVIS buy it online and have it delivered.”
There's a distance between them, giving Steve the chance to settle in his own space, even now with Tony hand firmly on his chest, grounding in it's warmth, like he's afraid Steve would bolt the next chance he got. It wasn't untrue. There was restless energy in Steve's body, the need to assure himself that he was alive and well sat on the edge of his mind. The only reason he hasn't acted on it was because of Tony.
She nods, another scratch on the paper. “Not a problem, either you come here or not, you gotta tell us so that we can warn the others. How long do your heats normally last?”
He watches Tony’s face, waiting for the pity in his eyes, the judgement that is sure to come, readies himself to square his shoulders, tighten his jaw. Ready to prove that he doesn’t need that expression, or the pity. He can take care of himself. Steve’s been fighting prejudice his entire life, in different forms and shapes. How is this any different?
He considers taking Clint’s bed instead, but then Clint whines and Steve finds himself with a very handsy Clint who’s determined to pull him into bed.
“Ocean.” It pops right out. “Christ, your scent is like the entire fucking ocean. Alive and wild. Never smelled anything like it. Did you always have this scent?”
Water gets everywhere, enters his lungs, breaking past skin and clings to his bones. With each breath he takes the pain spikes, piercing his throat even as he remains unmoving. It feels like a moment, it feels like an
“You still haven’t answered my question.” Tone serious, Steve leans closer, as much as he dares. “Are you okay, Tony?”
“You need an Omega, my boy. Something to take care of you, and something for you to take care off.” Obie says, hand on Tony’s shoulder.
He’s craving for some donuts, and maybe a little hungover. It’s not the worst idea in the world to use the suit for an express drive thru, he feels like he owes himself some leeway and fuck all who want to stop him.
Justin leans over, just the slightest, enough that Steve can smell his thick perfume. Steve stiffens, jaw tightening. “Between you and me, how much is Tony paying you to play his sweet Omega? Trying schmooze his way back after that disaster of a convention of his? I’ll double it if you talk.” Justin’s grip tightens on his knee, his smile turning dark. “A guy like Tony isn't meant to have an Omega. I mean, look what happened to Potts! Thrown out for the newer model, by the looks of it. Can’t say I blame the guy, you’re gorgeous.”
“I’ll see the both of you back at base. Shouldn’t be more than a week at most.” He continues on, after a brief apology as to why there was suddenly a chaffeur in front of their AirBnB. Of course, Natasha had alerted them both of it’s arrival, ready to shoot if anything got too suspicious but Steve was quick to clear the air before Natasha could pursue.
“Hands on the arm rest.” Tony snarls, glaring at Stevos’s hands, ones that have been rubbing at his chest, torturing his own nipples with soft touches.
His entire body shudders in surprise, the dildo suddenly buzzing right up against his prostate, against his everything. It feels deeper than it was a moment ago, touching him in all his intimate spaces.
“What happened to Tony? Is he okay?” He asks immediately, shuffling his feet away from his and Clint’s room.
“What would give you that impression?” Steve smiles back, writing out the receipt. “That’ll be fifty cents. Let her eat this, twice a day after meals, and this to help keep it down. No hard labour for a couple of days, let the medicine do the work. If she’s not fine within three days, better to go see a doctor.”
“You can’t be with a Beta.” Bucky finishes for him, not even a hint of bitterness. They’ve had this talk, several times, and slowly, Bucky’s become more resigned. Steve just hopes that he’ll stop waiting. Stop putting his life on hold for Steve. He hates it, watching Bucky practically limp after him, pretending that he’s not.
Truth was, he’d been reluctant to be around so many people at once. As much as the future now excited him, everything was new and seen with curiosity, he realized that the people in it would have changed as well.
Steve shrugs. “Sure, I mean, I want to meet him. I know the circumstances aren’t the most pleasant. If we’re not compatible, then I don’t have to do anything with him, right?” The details were vague at best, someone still had to explain what Scenting was.
“Yep, computers are basically slaves to the whims of humanity.” Tony nods solemnly. “But see, it’s incredibly frustrating learning to code, and even more frustrating when something doesn’t work the way it should. And thus comes the rubbery ducks to the rescue. See, the only way to go through the errors of logic in the code is go through it step-by-step, looking for the piece you’ve gotten wrong. Sounds easy enough, but when you’ve got thousands of lines of code to go through, and no one to talk to. I don’t have to tell you it starts feeling insane.” Tony gives him a look that Steve equates to understanding what he means, so Steve nods anyway.
As always, thank you for all your comments and kudos. It makes me feel kinda guilty whenever you guys leave kudos when I don't post chapters, but keep leaving them because it keep reminding me that I have to write, lol. Enjoy.
“Thank you.” Steve chances a glance at Tony. There’s something almost accusatory in Tony’s eyes, mystifying and electric, before it’s swept away with other emotions, and waved off with a smile.
“I didn’t mean what I said, you know. Back in the lab.” Tony murmurs suddenly, eyes closed as Steve continues to run antiseptic on his side.
“It’s not going to finish in time.” Yinsen gasps, throwing a frightened look from the computer to the open door.
Tony rids himself of his shirts, grunts at the ache in his shoulders where the armor had pressed too far in.
“Sassy little bitch, aren’t you.” Tony slurs, eyes blown wide that Steve is both irritated and awed by the man’s self-control.
“You could have warned me.” Was his dry retort. He would liked it much better if he knew that the shield wasn’t going to hit him on the face.
Steve doesn’t regret it, they’d been at war, the men he’d killed had chosen their side, ideals that he couldn’t take sitting down. He’d pitied them, in a way, because they’d been lost and blind.
He hasn’t drawn in a while, there hadn’t been much time in S.H.I.E.L.D., and frankly he had been a little frightened with the idea of asking for more than what was given to him. Now, he realizes that he'd been silly to presume that. If anything S.H.I.E.L.D. had done everything they could to make him as comfortable as possible. Funny how it took him leaving to realize that.
The helicopter lands a few feet away, Rhodey disembarking and jogging towards him. Stevos sets him down on the sand and Tony excitedly hobbles towards his best friend.
“You are, aren’t you?” Tony chides JARVIS. “It’s a scheme to get me to eat! Collusion! Betrayal! Treason! I expected better from you, Jarvis. And Steve, you haven’t admitted that robots are better than live animals. No, I didn’t forget. Traitors. The both of you.”
She smiles at him, straightens out his hair and wipes away his tears. “Steven, we’ve talked about this, baby. You said you wouldn’t make a fuss.”
Steve lets out a breath when Tony’s far enough, tugging the collar of his dress shirt that is suddenly too tight. He can feel the gold necklace digging into his clammy skin, and readjusts it.
“Black Widow will assess your hand to hand combat skills, and teach you basic skills in espionage. Something I think you lacked in the army. You best listen to her.”
Maybe it was why he didn’t feel all too disarmed with showing Tony his works, unfinished and most of them hurried because he would never had had the chance to do them otherwise (Alpha’s gifts). And it only seemed fair, Tony had shown him his lab, it was the least he could do.
“Earlier. You were trying to leave the bed, you said you needed something.” Tony clarifies. “What is it you need, Steve?”
Happy is Tony’s personal driver, he learns on the way to Malibu, when he’s not flying the Iron Man suit anyway. Steve senses the fondness in his voice, just the tiniest scent of protectiveness on the Beta. The man is amicable, providing the brunt of small talk that fills the car for the rest of the trip. Happy likes burgers (and so does Tony apparently) and points out good places to eat as they pass them by.
“Does that mean I get snuggles?” Tony teases, nudging at Steven’s legs with his knees, but quickly sobers up when he feels Steve stiffen. “It was a joke, Cap.”
“I’m not a tool for you to use, to piss off some other Alphas or grab someone else’s attention.” It shouldn’t turn Steve on so much.
“Good?” Tony checks, wriggling just the slightest to adjust his position on the bed, his knees on either side of Steve’s thighs. Steve feels his cock shift inside of him, gasps when he presses in just right.
“Five to seven?” She repeats, looks at him like she doesn’t believe him. “That’s irregularly long. Have you been talk to a doctor about this?”
Again, thanks so much for the comments and kudos, really means a lot to me. Nearly late again, in fact I had to hangout at my favorite cafe to make the deadline this week. Work has been busy but nothing I can't manage.
“Alright. You’re not expected to talk to anybody. If someone comes up to you and starts asking questions, it’s better to act like you don’t know a thing and call for me instead. Call my attention, tap my arm, do a signal and I can handle the rest.” Tony says for the upteenth time tonight, as they escape the blinding flashes and enter the hall.
The rest of his time is preoccupied with 'cohabitation' as one of the psychiatrists had so plainly said when asked with what he has been up to. To Steve, it simply means leaving his S.H.I.E.L.D. assigned room whenever he is allowed, keeping to himself during meal time, and punching bags at the gym level of S.H.I.E.L.D..
He grows jealous of the other kids, who scamper up and down the stairs, through the halls, screaming and yelling without a care in the world, while he lays in his bed, his body aching from fever, wondering why life is unfair.
Clint flops onto the empty seat when Michael leaves, giggling madly and smelling like he’d bathed in beer, a full glass of something in his hand.
It’s a relatively minor mission, not quite for the likes of Captain America, but it holds a closer role to Steve’s chest, and Clint’s.
And now the urge is close to boiling, as he shuffles through his discarded things from earlier to give way to the itch. Pencil and pad in hand, he quietly carries over a chair and flips to an empty page to start.
Except, the sight of the god’s smaller form doesn’t leave his thoughts. In his mind’s eyes, he can still see the withered god on the couch, superimposed against what Stevos looks now.
There’s desire in Tony’s eyes, one that sends electricity racing through Steve’s spine and he knows he’d made the right choice. He half-expects Tony to take him right there, on bended knees. Steve would have gone willingly, his body would have reacted to the Alpha’s touches and followed suit.
“Very well, Adam. If you wouldn’t mind the wait, you can relax on the bed.” The way the older Alpha says it, it doesn’t sound like a suggestion at all. Steve lays on the bed, the rest of his clothes still on, propping himself up on his elbows, heart hammering on his chest despite himself.
Tony huffs, glaring at the door for a moment, before his gaze falls onto Steve. Steve can’t help but turn stiff, shoulders hunched as he waits for his verdict. He still isn’t sure what had just happened, it had felt like a whirlwind and a hurricane had a quick spat and then went their separate ways.
Steve has to wonder which one of them is more nervous. “And what would be the signal?” He asks in mock whisper, leaning towards Tony as they register their names for the night.
Steve’s not entirely convinced, eyeing the marshmallows even as Tony fills his cup with hot chocolate. The little marshmallows foam with the heat, rising with the drink until they coat the top perfectly, tiny lumps above the chocolate.
They get dressed, Steve awkward for a moment but then realizes that Tony doesn’t seem to care much for their nakedness, and places on clothes almost like the way he puts on the uniform. Efficient.
Steve knows that Clint’s joking, at this point he hopes that half the things that Clint says are jokes, but it still gets him upset from time to time. Steve admires him, truthfully, that he can turn his situation into a joke for other people, at the expense of himself. That’s what gets to Steve though. Clint didn’t have to do that, not for him anyway.
“Don’t get snippy with me, boy.” Howard’s voice stern in the hallway, walk kept to a brisk pace as they make their way to the viewing room. “I’ve talked to your mother about this, and she agrees that it’s time that you had a
“Well, it was a gift.” Tony turns it over again, so that the curve of the shield rested unstably on the table. “In the middle of the war, the government was trying to get as much help as possible. Funding, technology, supplies, anything to sustain the war and win. ” He tests the wobble of the shield, frowns, and motions for them to move away.
Steve chuckles and respectfully returns to his sketching, a half-done drawing of Dummy, mostly due to the amount of plating and wires on the little robot. Half-done because, for a robot, Dummy can’t seem to stay in one pose for longer than a minute, so Steve has taken to drawing him in freeform.
Steve grins. “Not exactly. Cos the next thing I know is, Bucky’s separating us and is holding Howard by the collar of his fancy suit. I still remember the look of confusion on Howard’s face before Buck plants a big sloppy one, right on his lips!” He has to let out a bark of laughter at that. “And it’s not a short one either, it musta been a whole ten seconds before they pull apart. Howard’s staring at Bucky, all flushed and gawping, and Buck just turns to the rest of us, shrugs his shoulders and says ‘My rifle could use an upgrade too. Be dumb not to take him up on such a great offer.’”
“Oh sweetie, I didn’t-” Tony bundles him up and pressed himself to Steve this time, the scent of distressed Omega bittering the air, offering his neck, a gesture that was too Omega, too submissive for an Alpha to lower himself into. But clearly Tony was no ordinary Alpha. “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
He’d read that the practice had died out, because Alphas started to protest that, if Omegas were vying for their equal rights, then why did Alphas have to play along with the stereotype of provider and present the token at all.
They leave only for pancakes, which Steve insists on if they were going to follow Clint’s guidelines, stuff their faces with stacks and an alarming amount of syrup.
“Amend section 12B. James Rhodes shall also hereby inherit the Ironman Mark 7. The Ironman Mark 7 may not be gifted, may not be considered as property, or otherwise undergo a change of ownership, and may only be held in the possession, and piloted by James Rhodes. Should the Ironman Mark 7 be operated through an external signal, or by anyone other than James Rhodes, Jarvis may and
Strength sapped, Steve can do nothing else but lay there, note the fullness of semen and cock in his ass and the occasional shift of Tony on his back. His mind veers at the thought of the other Omega just outside the door, ready to take Tony away from him-
Steve can’t help it. The scent of an Alpha on him, body still remembering rough hands and touches, wisps of Heat that he can still blame. He presses forward in a clumsy kiss, aimed mainly at Bucky’s mouth but he misses and lands on the corner instead. He snatches the moment anyway, a soft press of lips, warmth that flows through him in spite of the jacket he’s already wearing. Warmer still.
It’s a week before he can really sleep. Everything is new and scary in the orphanage. His Ma tells him that he’s not really an orphan. She loves him very much and she isn’t going to let him be taken away. He just has to stay there for a while because she needs to take care of some adult things first.
auction house name that Tony can think of, but even he has heard of the exclusivity of Omegas sold here, said to be bred and handpicked by a mysterious host who has an eye for beautiful and interesting Omegas. “I’m sure you will find one to your fancy, young Stark.”
It’s with shame when he takes Ed’s card and pockets it, an address and number, that will haunt his drawer until he can’t ignore it anymore, or until his heat comes along and option is there. Because, as much as it would hurt his pride, going through a Heat without an Alpha was still something he wanted to avoid.
“Well, they don’t.” Sounds like a touchy subject, and hey, Steve was happy to just stare down at the crumbs until he could start to understand the conversation again.
There’s a temperamental growl in the room that comes from Tony, who hasn’t stopped thrusting his cock into Steve but doesn't sound happy with the intrusion either.
“I’ve always wondered, was it your idea or Howard’s to paint it this red, white and blue monstrosity?”
Two weeks ago he would have smiled at anyone who would have asked that, tell them it wasn't really anything, just his confusion of the general prospect of the feature. The Psychiatrists had asked as much, and some things he had told them and some things he hadn't. He could tell almost immediately when they only did so to be polite, their eyes would glaze over or shift somewhere else in the room.
Steve fidgets. It used to be a bit of taboo to ask, usually only spoken between close friends or lovers. It would be rude to just go up to a stranger and talk about scent but that in itself Steve finds himself thinking. Clint
“Haven’t been sleeping well since the Chitauri. There I said it. Been so fucking keyed up. It keeps replaying, over and over again, the wormhole, the fleet. The Nuke.” Tony adds with increasingly panic. The shudder he can’t hide speak more volumes to Steve. He can finally place that tired look Tony always seemed to have.
“No. It’s not. Hmm. Dummy is. It’s complicated, our relationship.” Tony tries to explain while he plays around with a hologram of a device that Steve hasn’t asked about but it looks like a watch.
During the campaign, he’d travelled from state to state for brief stays with the USO gals in an attempt to rack up funds for the army. Someone had drawn up that schedule, cobbled together details on where they’d stay and what time they’d perform. There was a very set track he had to play to. And of course, all that careful planning had gone to the dogs when he’d rescued the hundred and seventh from Hydra’s prison.
His grip is vice-like on Stevos’s hips, uncaring if they mark or hurt, and snaps right into Stevos’s ass. “Holy fuck, you feel so good. How the hell are you this tight.” Tony moans, loses himself to the slick heat of Stevos wrapped like a glove around his cock. Each thrust is like chasing heaven, electricity through his veins. Each burn of friction is better than the last, every slap of his balls to Stevos’s ass is a jolt of desire to go deeper and harder.
Rhodey and the Air Force drones are on his tail, thankfully Ivan hadn’t had much time to put more weapons on his drone. The bad news, they still had weapons, and the ones
He presses it in, gasping as the lack of lubrication makes the entry tantalizingly slow, the burn of rubber against his walls feel alien, feels almost like it’s too much. Steve grits his teeth as he works it in himself, pulling and pushing the rod into his hole, a pleasurable buzz as his body concedes and makes way for the intrusion.
Alphas in Fight weren’t given much leeway, in fact punished more severely if it was a crime of instinct, sometimes with a sentence of life-time imprisonment, or at worst, Death.
“You will receive a knot, Omega, whether you like it or not. Andrew!” He barks, catching the younger Alpha’s attention. “Next time, when you feel yourself knotting, you push, even if the Onega might pull away. You grab them by the thigh if you must.” And Ed demonstrates by strongehandedly lifts Steve hips until his knees are off the bed, and fucks into him at the new angle.
“Don’t know. The guy with the eye patch said it would help, and that Dad was more than he appeared.”
It turns out to be difficult, choosing an Alpha under these circumstances. Natasha assures him that all the Alphas have been background checked and cleared to meet him if he so chooses but it still feels like choosing his own firing squad. No different from going to the mating blocks and hoping to hell that the Alpha who chooses him would know his limit.
Steve nods. “And think.” He adds, he looks much more relaxed than Tony has seen him, but no less guarded. “You bought me.”
He blushes at that, a sharp reminder, a sharp, embarrassing reminder of how stupid he was about this century.
“Excuse me?” Steve’s voice hits a peak, good-natured still but he shoots Frank a sideways glare just for good measure, just cos he knows Frank likes it when he thinks he’s surprised Steve somehow.
They stumble onto the bed, kissing and groping each other. There’s desperation, not quite like when Steve was in heat but he can feel it, coursing through his veins nonetheless.
“Maybe…” Steve ventures, curling his body protectively over Clint, a soothing hand over his to ease away his fingers from making him bleed any more than he has to. “Maybe living is our punishment. We know now to be better than we were, even if it means forcing ourselves to live with that guilt, we owe it to the world to be better.”
Steve looks back up to Tony (Did he really drop his gaze?), the Alpha looking at him like nothing was wrong at all. He was thankful that Tony had missed his minor panic attack.
Stevos hits his prostate almost with devotion, melting Tony into a blubbering mess within minutes. He doesn’t want to let go though, clinging to the god with his hands curled on Stevos’s arms, a hand burying itself in that mess of soft blonde hair, drawing him in close to kiss.
She had set him down one day, wiped away the tears from his cheeks and told him that it wasn't his fault. "If only I could have given you a stronger body." She told him as she hugged him tight. "I love you my darling boy, it isn't your fault. We can get through this."
Another breath, another shudder. He’s still slick. His cock has at least decided to calm down now. How long has passed? He’s not even sure anymore.
They take him in as a second thought, always referring first to Tony before they even look at him. Which Steve understands. Tony is the Alpha, and right now he’s an extension of Tony’s persona. As a sign of respect, they acknowledge the Alpha first before his Omega. It doesn’t exactly bother Steve, in fact, he’s more than ready to cede attention to Tony than take it from him. As it is, he’s not exactly expected to participate in the conversation, which suits him just fine.
, our government, the American government, during the height of the second World War against the Nazi’s was asking for funding and weapons from Wakanda, a highly secretive, relatively peaceful nation. Didn’t go so well, obviously. And for laughs, this is a hypothesis from my part because Wakanda is
He hadn’t gone into heat for the year, the missions were taking it’s toll even on his body, and it didn’t help that he took them as often as they came. They stretched from three days to  a month, though he thinks that SHIELD has figured out that he’s better with quick insertion maneuvers than actual stake outs, he’s honestly surprised that no one has argued with him yet.
Stevos doesn’t seem to mind that he’s laying on what must be a thousand dollars worth of gin, nor being stripped naked when Tony rips away the cheap fabric that covers his body. It’s soft and cottony in his hands, light and sinewy when he really clutches it in his fingers. It doesn’t make much sense, because if it were truly that fragile, it would have ripped a long time ago with how it stretches ridiculously over Stevos’s chest. It also doesn’t make much sense when he tosses the scrap of fabric and turns to look at Stevos, and finds him absolutely naked on the couch, shirt and pants gone, leaving him a dizzying display of flesh.
Steve doesn’t move from his spot, half-buried in blankets that Tony insists on covering him with, and a tanned arm draped over his body possessively. He doesn’t answer, or question the statement, his tongue feels heavy and unwillingly to comply, and he finds that he doesn’t have the energy to really care.
On one hand, he’s been coddled enough. He doesn’t miss the way that Natasha gives him the side-eye when she think he doesn’t notice, though she doesn’t say a word. Clint hasn’t been around, so Steve doesn’t have anyone to give it to him straight, and he’s left to guessing. His therapy sessions have been reduced to a month, at least some good had come from the Chitauri invasion. Credibility for his position as leader, and to ensure that he wouldn’t break under pressure.
“Everyone. Jesus, you are so hopeless.” Clint slurs, making a grab for his drink and missing completely, instead utters a groan as he splays on the counter.
“Plus, if your psychiatrist ever starts asking stupid questions again.” Clint makes a slicing movement below his neck and then winks.
“Y’know how many Omegas get invited to them? Near none. Unless you count a floozy hanging off an Alpha’s arm. Course, that means unmated Alphas take it upon themselves to
Tony has a face of comical horror, dropping into the couch next to Steve. “Are you saying-? Did dad-?”
Frank. The Alpha’s name is Frank. Andrew’s older brother, who has seen it fit to see the rest of Steve’s heat through.
It’s tricky, very touch and go, as Yinsen boots up the temporary OS into the suit, and helps Tony get in, straps down the metal to his arms and buckles his legs in.
I'll try to keep to a regular update schedule, as of now I'll stick to (my) sunday, within the day at the very least but I write whenever the mood strikes me or when I'm doing nothing.
Tony shrugs him off and keeps walking. The man was his godfather, but he’d always been too touchy for his own good. “I’ve already told Dad.” He shoots a look at Howard. “I don’t
It had felt easier back then to slot together, or Steve supposes it had been a much more terrible night and neither had cared much for comfort anyway.
“I kind of understand why you did it.” Tony mules over, not sure why he has to say it out loud except for the reason that he wants Stevos to know.
Mating block. An illegal one running under the guise of a registered business, the dark underbelly of it all. Unwilling Omegas, drugged and restrained, an underground market for Alphas and Betas who didn’t care if they harmed their partner or not. If they were willing or not. Sold to the highest bidder.
Brock Rumlow (Mid-Alpha) takes charge, runs the team with efficiency and skepticism, while Jack Rollins (High-Beta) keeps everyone in line for Brock, ensuring the hierarchy is well and stable, and Brock’s position isn’t compromised in anyway, which was the most common problem when it came to anything pack.
He’s the new kid, most of the others just ignore him for now. He would prefer that over this though. It’s already hard enough making friends without them picking on him.
“And this one?” Steve looks at the first armor among the display. It lacks the sophistication that the rest have, crude and battered. Color is also absent, while the three others are painted in shifts of red and gold, this one remains chrome. Oddly enough, Steve finds it the most telling. While the rest are in near perfect condition, this one wears all its gashes with pride. Scratches, indents (bullets?) and soot mar its exterior.
“Used to have your posters all over my room. Howard was a huge fan. There’s an entire warehouse full of his 'collection' of you.” Tony laughs. “He used to say things like you’d probably blush to your tips if you ever saw everything that they’d made about you, and that was his excuse for buying the most ludicrous shit. I’ll take you to see them someday, it’ll be a memorable trip.”
The god doesn’t say a word, but pulls back so that Tony is treated to the sight of the gods entire body. Stevos hoists up Tony’s leg and settles it to rest on his shoulder, the starts maddening pace.
For a man who Steve has seen parade around the gala for most of the night, acting like he owned the place, he looks oddly subdued in his own home.
The situation is bleak. Even with the suit on, there are too many men, too many guards to fight. The sun is blinding to him, after months of having nothing but a lamp to light the dark, it almost feels like punishment.
Tony is still muttering as they leave the door, (about betrayal and treachery, if his super-hearing is to be believed) and Pepper mouths a quick ‘Thank you’ to him. He returns it with a two fingered salute.
He nearly fires a repulsor at Stevos when he appears, vaguely wonders if it would even do anything to the god if he did.
didn’t you tell me? You let me-” Tony’s face sours, makes a frantic gesture at Stevos. “You let me just
They’re at the S.H.I.E.L.D. firing range. Suspiciously empty but no complaints from Steve. He doesn’t feel like being gawked at today, not after another grueling round of questions from the psychiatrist.
"You stopped texting me after a couple of days. I thought. Oh I don't know, that what we had in your mind was just something out of Heat." Tony looks disgruntled. "It was fine afterwards you know, so I'm all fine with that. It worked out well enough and we're talking again now but I was always curious as to the
So he’s surprised when Tony wrangles out a pot from the cabinets, takes out a brown lump from the cupboards, and retrieves a carton of milk from the fridge.
In which case, he spends the extra time back in his room, either continuing where he had left off from before lunch, or starting on a new topic altogether.
Steve mules it over for a moment. “Later. After work.” He makes a point to say. A chance, to let the Alpha say what he wanted to say and be done with it. And if he had the wrong idea then Steve could be more than rude enough to defend his own dignity.
Clint kept them normally on the range, but surprised him once by taking him to the mats and handing him a knife.
He looks to Clint, already curled in bed, sheets pooled at the end of the bed because of the heat, but not yet asleep, in fact, stares right back at him, as if expecting something of him.
Almost immediately he’s assaulted with Tony’s succulent scent, dizzying him as Tony covers him.with body, lathing kisses at the back of his neck that has him keening. Tony’s humping against him, rubbing his large cock against the cleft of his ass, growling in his ear.
“Okay, I think it’s time to go home now.” Steve chuckles, placing some cash for the drinks and then bodily heaving Clint to stand up.
“Surprisingly. I was suspicious of the marshmallows.” He says honestly, giving his own cocoa a fond look, nearly halfway into his drink already.
Happy got him a sketchbook (watercolor paper, 300gsm, much too good for him) and a small assortment of pencil. Now he’s reclined in his seat, snoring quietly with a sleeping mask on, leaving Steve with privacy with his new tools.
Guilt sways in his chest. He had ordered Natasha to close the portal before the Ironman was clear, the aftershock of the blast had been impeding through the portal and any longer would have come falling back into Earth.
When Tony’s knot deflates, Steve moans at the spill of slick and cum from his ass. Without the knot to plug him, it trickles out, running out to soak the bed, a dirty combination of their mess.
The Alpha goes very still, surprised first and foremost, but the energy seems to hum with more curiosity than anger.
“Upper it is. She’ll need something to help her appetite too.” He gets up to rifle through some boxes, trying to act as calmly as possible. Something must show on his face when he comes back with pills.
“Oh, thank god, my feet are killing me.” The man laughs, taking the seat. He has thick-rimmed glasses, sandy-blonde hair, and a smile that makes Steve be on guard. He’s also an Alpha.
“I’m not safe, okay? Fuck. I can’t be here. Not when everyone looks at me like they think I’ll explode or something.”
“They’re lucky to have each other.” Steve finds himself saying. Back when- Before the serum, he had hoped that somehow, some Alpha would look at him, really see him, and think that he was alright. It was a hazy dream, fed by the idle thoughts when the fever blurred his eyes and shook his brain. A silent prayer that someday, there was an Alpha kind enough to look past his physical weaknesses. With each passing year, his hopes had dwindled.
“Ah.” Tony supplies, moving past the machinery and brings out drinks from the lab’s cooler. “Celebration?” Tony inclined a drink towards him, a testing smile on his face.
Steve chases at the taste when Tony’s pulls away, calmer than he was a moment ago but breathing just as hard.
It had too damn lucky that Tony had survived at all, and he think that might haunt him for the rest of his life.
“I bet you regret making me your patron now.” Tony snarls, raising the faceplate up so that Stevos can get a good look at his face. And also to properly yell at him, that seems important in the grand scheme of things. “I’m not a good man, Stevos, I’m fucking broken. You chose fucking wrong, and when I die, you’ll die too.” And shit, he almost feels like putting the gauntlets to his head and blasting himself at a hundred percent. Close contact without the helmet. A quick certain death.
Steve moves, tips his head down to capture Tony’s lips, who responds in kind. His arm’s fall awkwardly to his side, while Tony’s hands slide to his hips, keeping him there. Steve has a good three inches on Tony, so he towers over him quite a bit, but that’s not much of a factor when Tony kisses back.
At the beginning, he had classified Tony as just another Alpha, one to get him through his heat, who’d just let him be when it was all over. Some Alphas were addicted to the high of an Omega below them, the natural domination that would come from heat sex. It was easy to take when the Omega was so willing to give, desperation running high during the period.
But he does reach the mating blocks, grateful for the meager heating in the lobby as he walks right up to the counter. Cos it’s no different looking than an inn, except he knows better.
The door opens again, making them both stop to look at the newcomer. Another Alpha. This one eyes him openly, grin on his cheeks that stretches all the way to his eyes. “What’ve we got here, Annie?”
They kiss and touch each other, heady with each other’s scent, Steve’s next wave of Heat not quite there yet but it didn’t matter to them.
“You pick fights like people’ve insulted your mother. You don’t care how big the other guy is, just that he’s wrong. You got all these big ideal, all trapped up in there in that beautiful head of yours. And you get these real frustrated look when things aren’t up to your standard, like you can’t even believe why people aren’t as crazy as you are.” Frank looks at Steve, a shine in his eyes that Steve doesn’t understand but wants to.
“It really was nothing. He said some very mean things about you and I didn’t appreciate them.” He grumbles, the memory of Hammer’s words still sending a irritant flash in his mind.
“First time, Hon?” One of the Omegas says, a smile on her painted lips. “No need to be so scared. In here, we’re all just co-workers, aren’t we?”
It earns him a hard slap on the face from Ed when he notices. “What a proud Omega. You were made for a knot, and you will accept it when it is given.”
The pencil Happy got him (2B Faber Castell) along with the sketchbook had quickly turned into one of his most prized possessions. And for a while, he worried of what would happen once he’d scraped the pencil down.
Steve can only laugh. “Okay, consider me intrigued. How’s about we do it when I get back? Make it an entire night. I’ll see you both by next week. Stay out of trouble you two. Captain’s orders.” They salute each other for kicks before Steve ducks in the car, driven off to the airport.
“Am not little.” Is all Steve deems worthy to reply too, chuckling as Tony falls back to bed next to him.
Clint lets go of a breath and looks relieved, even manages to look happy despite the tiredness in his frame.
“Damn, and here I thought I was being evasive.” Tony fidgets. “Can’t. Won’t. I have this thing about people touching me in weird places, dunno if you knew but doctors do bad touches all the time. Won’t subject myself to that, just won’t.”
It’s quiet exploration, lacking of the desperation that came with Heat induced sex. Every curve, every muscle, mapped out by inquisitive fingers.
There’s yelling, and Tony startles as the sounds get closer, curling behind the suit in some semblance of cover.
Dumbfounded, he flips the envelope open, thumbing through the papers. He takes out the driver’s licence and examines it.
If it weren’t for Erksine, who insisted on letting a ninety-pound, asthmatic, Omega into the program, Steve doubted he would have gotten anywhere in the Army at all.
The bit of hope that had started to grow in Tony’s chest fizzles out. “Oh… Is this like some kind of test again? Because swear to god, I hated the last test, it was terrible.”
"I don't like hospitals either." Steve mutters, he leans forward, half-draped on Tony's bed, making sure not to put his full weight on Tony's side but wanting the comfort of being close to the Alpha all the same.
Eventually, when the day has burned down, and the night has crept on him, he finds his way back to whichever motel they’re staying at.
So instead, he does what he can for the moment, and presses his entire body to Tony’s. Tony makes room for him, like he always does, and they cuddle in silence, broken only by Steve with two words.
It was awe, some boyish emotion that made Tony smile at him like he’d personally hung the moon. Steve smiles sadly, finding the sentiment too overwhelming to accept, pulling himself away from Tony’s arms.
“Oh yeah?! What?” Steve growls right back, stands as well, makes up for height by glaring at Bucky and showing teeth. “It’s been
Dummy clicks sympathetically, pushes his tracks right to the sofa and taps at the sketchpad on Steve’s lap.
It doesn’t always work, Clint puts up a fight, kicks, punches, screams and scratches at Steve when he tries to touch him, too lost in his thoughts to comprehend what’s happening.
“Well, he shouldn’t.” Steve says, brows knitted together. “And neither should anyone else. You are more than what people think of you.”
“You always say that like I ever did anything to really stop you.” Bucky comes back, work boots creaking the wooden floors. “Like I ever did you a great dishonor just cos you’re an Omega.” He shakes his head. “Fine Steve Rogers. Go prove whatever the
Even if Fury was hiding something, dangerous and foreboding as that sounded, Steve was determined to be within reach to stop the man if need be.
All it takes is a twitch of Tony’s fingers, a suggestion of what he wants, and they’re fumbling into another room, where there was wreckage and debris falling from the ceiling. The house is at it’s post-party state, broken vases and littered drinks that happened before Rhodey had arrived to take the suit.
"Well, yes I want to get married as soon as possible but not exactly now, sweetheart." Tony takes Steve's hand and presses the back of his palm to his lips. "You have a choice, of course, you always have a choice." Tony clears his throat. "This is me. Stating my intentions. This is my promise to court you properly, fitting for an Omega of your position." Another kiss to his fingers as if to prove his point.
The flashes are familiar, the vague shapes of cameras pushed from every direction into their faces, yells of questions and statements coming from this way and that. Steve tries to smile, but he doesn’t exactly know where to look.
JARVIS is apparently an AI (A really smart computer person?) and is in charge of the house and overall security. He had a feeling that there was more to it, but didn’t press, still amazed with everything around him.
The curator, now with an apt audience, smiles, and motions to a newly revealed box onstage, covered in thick satin-like the other boxes had been. “Our last auction piece comes from New York. A
“Okay. Just let me-” Steve pulls out his phone, to text Phil- He grits his teeth, sees the stain of blood on the wall of the helicarrier and quickly backtracks those thoughts into something more productive. He texts Clint instead.
Steve shoves him lightly. “Who’s fault do you think that is, jerk.” He grins anyway. It’s a strange twinge in his chest.
Honestly, Tony didn’t mind all the extra touches. “No. Well. No, no, no.” Tony says, in a burst of actual emotion. “You never came to visit!”
He sighs in the bath, scrubbing the rest of his body down, turning pink cheeked at the memory of earlier while he reaches between his legs. Tony’s eyes, dark and looming, promising wicked things while he touched him. He rubs between his cheeks, where the slick had gathered, and pinks further, his cock decidedly taking interest in those thoughts.
“Happy getting the rest of your things?” Tony breaks the silence, gesturing at the bag that Steve grips so tightly.
They discuss (argue) several things about Stark Industries that Steve supposes shouldn’t really be his business. He’s tried to get up and leave, a half-formed excuse on his lips, give them a bit more privacy, but Tony just yanks him back down and pushes a beer into his hands.
“If you say so.” The dark-haired boy replies with a shrug. “You got a name or what?” He suddenly demands, eyeing him.
Natasha and Clint are easy enough to wrangle up, SHIELD medics already loading them into a truck for transport back to SHIELD. Bruce Banner is nonplussed, and allows himself to be put in a car, with fair warnings to everyone to not touch him.
Really it's been a bad month for me. First of all, the Google Docs app, the app I usually use for writing, suddenly kept crashing on my phone. I tried to use the Microsoft Word app for a couple of weeks, but it was just too slow and clunky for my taste, and it getting bugging out on me. When the Google Doc app finally stopped crashing, I was able to get about half of the chapter written, and it was suppose to be smooth sailing from there.
This time, Tony laughs, though he knows it must be very rude to do so. “You know, a typical Omega wouldn’t ask so many questions. That’s why I want you. You aren’t typical, aren’t you? Just look at you, you’re the most
The lady, at least, has the manners to realize her mistake. “Oh, I’m sorry. I just assumed. We get a lot of couples who decide to adopt a pet together, it was totally my mistake.”
if he gets a fuzzy feeling in his gut when he sees that Tony is calling. Jitters, he thinks, but he smiles every time anyway.
Unperturbed by Tony’s lack of reaction, Jasper clears his throat and shows Tony a manila envelope. “I have all of your papers ready, Mr. Stark. All of his registrations are right here.”
But oh, imagination can only take Tony so far. Human, is the keyword to it all. Politely human, that is the extent of Tony’s imagination. He has had his fair eyeful of perfectly built male specimens, and has had the absolute pleasure of playing with them as well.
Clint and Natasha are away, official SHIELD business, is all he is deemed fit to be informed with. Though he may receive the occasional heads up from either of them, he knows that they can’t exactly tell him anything they aren’t allowed to.
When Stevos’s hand snakes up under his clothes, hands pressing to the front of Tony’s chest, Tony hisses as his fingers slide over a bruise.
He knows a thing or two about feeling trapped, mentally and physically, and Clint looked like he was ready to jump off buildings if it meant he could get the peace he was looking for. And wasn’t it a bit ironic that Clint would go to
As always, thank you for the comments, kudos and support. I love reading your comments, especially when added with insight for the story. The only reason I don't reply to them is because I don't know what to reply with but I appreciate them all.
Also, as a forewarning, the 'sex' part of this chapter contains dubcon for Steve. If you'd rather skip it, when Steve starts taking his clothes off, you might as well skip it.
There’s another stretched silence, which Steve takes to tightening his sketch with stronger strokes. “Mr. Stark has given you alpha access throughout the household.” Comes the answer. “Information on my data servers, access throughout Stark households, any and all services I am able to render are at your disposal. Sir has put a remarkable amount of faith in you.” The last one almost sounded hopeful.
Holy shit, it's been almost two months since the last update. I swear like half of this was written in a week, and the rest has been pitter-pattering for days. It's longer than usual, but don't let the length fool you. Thank you to everyone who's still keeping with the updates, I know I suck at keeping to a schedule but I swear I love you all for leaving kudos and comments throughout the weeks.
This wasn’t something he did in the war, not when every waking minute was spent tracking down information and then acting upon that information decisively, which meant destroying camps and bases in most cases. Any time they weren’t actively hunting down Nazis was spent sleeping, whatever precious few moments he could get before either Colonel Philips or Agent Carter could yell at him for another mission.
“Still so tight, even though you must have fucked yourself silly on that dildo.” His Alpha whispers into his ear, thrusting with practiced movements that have them both moaning.
Holy hell, it's been 3 months?!?!?!! I was so sure it hadn't been 2 but then 3 snuck up my ass. Same old same old, work has been tiring, just need time to write between all the fic ideas but this one was like a month of thinking, and then another month of writing. I hope people are still interested in this, I believe I should be building up traction for the upcoming chapters too.
Steve doesn’t know why James hates him so much, just that he does and he likes to make Steve’s life hell. Any attempt to try to talk to the older boy is met with a blatant remark of how he must be a dumb kid, along with a bunch of insults to get him mad. He’d tried to apologize, if he insulted James somehow, or did something wrong to him, but he still gets shoved around.
Anyway, I am incredibly sorry for not getting this out sooner. I tried to get it out last week, but I've been swamped with a lot of other things that I have to do on the computer. Half of this chapter was written three weeks ago, then the other half just whenever I would have the time, so it might feel odd as compared to other chapters sorry.
He might have cried a little, he will admit that his eyes stung from the effort of holding back those tears, but he takes the situation as best he can. Instead, he makes himself a small space in the living room. And after a quick query with JARVIS for a power outlet and the network password, he plugs in his SHIELD laptop and starts doing the report. He hadn’t had the chance to work on them on the flight over, too stressed out by the thought that Tony was injured. But now he welcomes the distraction, at least until Tony needs him.
By the end of it, Tony finally puts all his tools down and stands back, crossing his arms as if to criticize his own work.
They sit in Tony’s tub, big enough for six people which means it’s roomy enough for two, but Tony curls close to Stevos, and the god utters no complaints when Tony rests his body over his.
Clint stands there in a oversized hoodie, deep bags under his eyes and it looks like he hasn’t gotten a wink of sleep since he’d gotten out of medical.
“They’ve both been grounded from active duty until Black Widow deems you mission ready. Until then, they have got nothing better to do than to look after you. Are we clear?”
Tony groans. “Over an asshole Low-level like Hammer, normally I’ve got more poise than tah. Don’t ever remind me. We shall never speak of this again. Forbidden territory,
Tony thrusts inside of him, his ass giving way to the huge blunt cock that penetrates him. Steve shudders at the force of it, the rapid pace that Tony keeps up as his thigh slap against his ass. It’s the last day, and they both know it, instincts and pheromones running high as Steve reaches the end of his cycle.
Steve did say that he wanted the time to think about it first, to look into it further, even if he was too far gone on Tony to begin with. There was always the chance that it was lust, Tony’s body had been the first he’d been in contact with since awakening, it made sense that he would want pleasure from a familiar person. Or worst yet, biology. Since Tony was a compatible High-level Alpha, it would make sense that his own Omega instincts would seek him out.
He’s not ignorant. Half of the time Stevos doesn’t even come, and Tony can’t bring himself to care, which should bother him more now that he thinks about it. But he can’t, not when feels so sorry for himself. Even when there’s an actual god sucking his cock, very enthusiastically too, as soon as it’s all over, Tony’s either passed out, or is just too tired to reciprocate. There’s that sense of dread hovering on the edge of his mind. There to pry upon his thoughts if he lets it.
Steve visits the two scientists, only to be shoved back out because he doesn’t know he’s doing, Tony and Bruce Banner are certainly bounds more capable than him. The words sting,
Tony suddenly looks around the lab. “Where did I-?” He mumbles to himself, before darting away and looking through the other desks.
“Behind the spices, yes.” Steve answers, plating the rest as he carefully finishes making the sandwiches, and offers them up first to Brock even though he’s starving.
“Does a good job at it. It’s just a little… Off.” Brock grunts, but eyes Steve with open distaste than lust. Or was the distaste for the drug? “Never gonna be better than mine though.” The fellow Alpha grins. A running joke between them, every time Tony manages to bring someone home, Brock manages a snide remark about how perfect his Omega.
“It’s a cocoa bar, pure chocolate.” Tony answers in lieu of Steve’s questioning look. “Sort of like dark chocolate, only a lot more condensed. Jarvis, well not
“I never claim to know all. Only that certain events are made known to me, as your god.” He adds at the end, as if Tony could ever forget.
She seems to expect that kind of answer as she writes that down as well. “Good of you to be honest, Steve. But if you ever changed your mind, you can always have it.”
Steve understands enough that Tony doesn’t always spend all his time for work down at the lab. There’s a reason for the towering screens in the basement, projected into the air for Tony. Schematics for things, projects for both the company and Ironman. (“If I tell you, I’d have to kill you sort of deal, but not really because how could I possibly kill Captain America.”)
It is Tony who makes the first move, taking Stevos’s hands in his own as he inches closer. At the first touch of their lips, Tony feels the spark that zips in his body, like his body is awakened by that simple gesture and he runs his hands all over the god’s body, over every crevice he could reach.
He lets out a breath he didn’t know he’s been holding, and flinches when the arousal melts its way down his spine, feels the wetness between his thighs.
“Ma'am” Steve nods solemnly at the Alpha female, who smiles politely all the same, though he can't shake off the feeling that she's watching him for something.
Hollow laughter. “Then get your ass over here, soldier. Being stuck in bed sucks. Having you here would make it much
“You couldn’t just take a sick leave and let other soldiers fight for justice, peace and patriotism?” Tony wheedled, keeping up the gentle pressure, pressing into all the right places that makes Steve’s brain stutter to a halt.
It feels like Heat. But wrong. Different. Difficult. His skin itches, his head hurts, and his insides feel like they’re being churned in slow twists.
“C’mon fellas, we don’t want any trouble. I just need to get my friend home. He’s had a too good of a night.” Steve tries, but when one guffaws, he knows it’s no use.
A blush blooms on Steve's cheeks, he hunches into his seat and looks pointedly at the table instead, focusing on a crumb that’s fallen off the plate. Tony nods vaguely in Brock’s direction.
They move a little closer, some intimidation tactic no doubt, and Steve swears he hears the shuffle of cloth and metal.
After his run, he’d go for a shower, and spend the morning reading either books or web pages (approved by S.H.I.E.L.D.) until lunch time.
He’s placed a few bids himself, making the price increase about a thousand at a time, which really he does to agitate both Obie and Howard. None of the Omegas really catch his interest. Objectively, they’re all just… Too blank for his liking, he can’t possibly think of what he might do with any of them if he were to bring one home.
It feels good on his tongue, thick and heavy, a taste that is purely Stevos assaults his senses, and he likes the weight of it on his tongue.
“Not sure if I should be thanking the man who taught you to suck cock or feel jealous that I didn’t get to teach you myself. You would have been a wonderful student.” The Alpha looks at him now, dark-eyed and red-cheeked, hunger that Steve recognize, that must be reflected in his own eyes. “That’s it, sweetheart. I know you love sucking cock. Don’t try to deny it, you do it so well, so fucking earnest to please. Damn eager to have it down your throat.” Steve groans around the cock, sucking harder, bobbing faster. “What I’d do to have you in my office, definitely would make time there a lot more interesting. The number of times I’ve imagined you under my desk, blowing me in the middle of the day, just the threat of someone bursting in and finding us. Made me pop a boner one too many times. Just like that, baby. So good, making me feel so damn good. Would you like that someday?”
Clint snorts. “Yeah, right. I heard about your little outburst, scared that Agent shitless. Proud of you, kid.”
Like Seth who did construction work, and went home to his gal right after, except it was bar night and he and his boys would get borderline drunk before they dragged their sorry asses back home. He had a kid who just started talking, and wouldn’t stop saying 'baf!’ when he was excited.
His mom scrambles him back in her arms, hugging him until his ribs hurt. “Don’t ever say that, Steven. Of course, I want you. I love you. I love you more than anything in the entire world, baby.” His mom sounds like she’s about to cry too. She sniffles, holds his shoulders and stares him in the eye.
back his position, and the back to court trials regarding the Iron Man suit. Rhodey's back on his side and he’s pinned as a national treasure.
Still muscular, contrary to his initial glance, lean in a way that said of use instead of outright decoration. But it is still marred by scratches and black lines. Lines that Tony was utterly familiar with.
“Yeah well, we can’t all be super soldiers. Some of us do bleed.” He catches the way Tony’s eyes roam, settling on the cut on his side where a Chitauri had stabbed him with it’s spear.
“Not trying to. Just wanted to say I was sorry. What I did was wrong. And I’d do a lot more to make it right by you if you’d let me.” Frank says. Before Steve can protest, Frank brings out a small plain white box. “We didn’t give you this for starters. As much as my uncle wants to believe he’s a straight-edge traditional Alpha.”
Tony takes him through the motions, finally gets his boxers off of him as settles them back on the bed. There is no moment where they aren’t touching, aren’t connected in some way, reluctant to break apart for even a moment.
) enthralled by the Steve’s reaction, grabs a fistful of ass and presses in deep, plunging himself into Steve, inhibitions lost as the need thrives for the both of them. He only slows to change their position, forcing Steve onto his belly and moving his legs out of the way.
Hey look, it's sunday! Wrote half of this chapter on the train, and the other half while on beach vacation!
Thor on the top of the state building, the tip pierced right through his chest, his blood spilling out.
There was more to the story, Tony knows it, but he can’t bring himself to ask, not when he feels so tired himself, wrought in the battle that claimed his body.
Tony’s still too caught up with looking at the Omega, the hard look on his face. Was that the difference between those doll-like Omegas and an Omega who’s had an owner before? There was no innocence on this Omega’s face, not the blank stares of no doubt clueless Omegas, but this one held himself tightly, making his muscle bunch together, not quite curled up, but looked as though he would try to escape if given the chance. There was intelligence behind those blue eyes, knowing and perceptive.
He chuckles despite himself. Somehow, the thought that Tony knows just about everything about him scares him, much like when the psychiatrists had poked and prodded him within weeks of recovery. He’s tricking himself right now,
There’s a hot tongue on his nipples and Tony all but yelps, Stevos only needs to place a palm onto his hip to stop him from jumping off the bed entirely and that’s dizzyingly hot. Stevos lavishes his nipples with attention, twisting the other with his free hand.
It should feel reassuring, a sense of comfort to a space that was his. Except it’s also a reminder of Tony’s kindness.
“Yes, Anthony, there. Gods! There!” Stevos moans, thrusting back on his cock as he bows his head low on the bed.
“That must have been very difficult for you. Not being with him.” He pauses from his sketch, takes his time to look Tony’s sleeping form once more. There would have been no Tony to brighten the room, to throw insults at his robot pets, nor would there have been anyone to speak to JARVIS. The house would have been empty.
It looked handmade, a chipped blade wrapped in worn but sturdy cloth and kept in place with string. Shiv sounded like the more appropriate term for it than knife. It seemed so out of place as compared to the guns he’d been handed.
Steve guesses that Tony Stark was seen as useful, at least, enough of a use to be included on his list. It might just be the curiosity of it, but he wants to meet the man that was raised by Howard, maybe get some insight on how he’d lived.
Not much to say except it's a flashback scene. Some dissonance from Steve's initial memories but I blame Steve's stubborness in this matter. I'm still delaying Steve and Tony's reunion, one more flashback chapter to be done before they see each other again, but soon.
“Was this the ploy? Getting me cozy with a cup of cocoa and then making me spill all of my secrets?”
The Omega lets out a choked snarled, and all of a sudden, Tony’s on his back, arms pinned above his head, and a very
He doesn't really know what to make of that. Well-documented? The future was so strange. He'd have to make a list of things to ask about.
“Well, all I would do is provide you with more personal information about the Alphas.” So he could pick more than a pretty face and a knot, good. “But, if you would prefer to do it alone, I could give you slides with appropriate information and you may ask questions later on.”
Steve grins. “He shimmies up to me and says, he says to me.” Steve throws an arm over Tony’s shoulder, who is absolutely hiding a smile. He does his best impression of gruff Alpha. “Hey doll, you look about lovely tonight. What say you and me ditch the joint and have fun on our own.” Complete with head cock.
best. It’s just. I-” The Beta pauses and then calms down, an enlightened smile on his face. “I have just the idea, I’m sure you’d love it, Mr. Stark. I’ll bring you to your Omega instead.”
There's a silence where all Tony’s doing is massaging Steve thighs until he stops to the look at the door.
So JARVIS hadn’t exactly trusted Sergeant Rhodes of his identity, not to that extent, despite the closeness of Tony and the Sergeant shared (“Oh, you’re gonna love Rhodey-Bear. He’s a huge fan, he did his thesis on you but don’t tell him I said that, I wanna see him hold in all his fangirl-stares.”).
Steve knows that much, power play between Alphas, internal politics that strayed between the norm where normal Fight couldn’t occur. The Omega was like a bartering chip, a show of power, in turn could also show great disrespect towards another Alpha. To arouse an Omega in a room of Alphas was as good as any of that, especially when the Omega was not to be shared. It would have been Tony practically spitting at the face of the General, displaying an Omega just off his heat like a war prize. It was dangerous.
“Call my people.” Tony says, already uninterested. He’s looking back at Steve, a stern expression and pursed lips.
Controlling the shakes, Steve undoes his own shirt, placing it neatly over a chair, and does the same with his pants and underwear. He holds his breath as he joins Tony on the bed.
The glass gives way, but then water comes pouring forth, icy cold and unforgiving, forcing it's way into his mouth, blurring his sight. He tries to fight against it, tries to push back but his limbs feel like lead, against the roaring tide.
Steve checks it, and sees the photograph. It’s him, looking confused, with the drawing, sitting on the bed. Almost perfect. If only he wasn’t in it.
When he’d left Tony there in his penthouse after the Chitauri attack, left him there for Pepper, he promised himself that he wouldn’t get between them.
It’s three weeks before he breaks. Three solid weeks of being dead on his feet, trying to fix the expo and trying to make things up to Pepper and Rhodey.
schedules.” She answers in return, and Steve nearly flinches at the biting tone that Tony so easily ignores. She
Clint’s description of the Ironman doesn't quite capture what would first come to Steve’s mind. He’s seen picture of it on the internet, stolen photographs from running passersby, always at an angle that suggest that the Ironman was never paying attention.
By the time they land, Steve has painted a vivid picture of the situation in his mind. The last of the files was a detailed list of Tony’s injuries, no doubt meticulously compiled by JARVIS himself. A near fractures, lacerations and a drastic drop in his immune system due to the amount of shear stress and blood loss he’d had to endure to mention the lighter side of things, anxiety creeps over Steve, looming over him as they landed.
Steve takes a hold of his hardening cock, smooth and knotless, rocking into his fist as it fills. Every stroke is damn near pleasurable friction, pumping himself as pre-cum dribbles out of his tip. A sweep over the head has him mewling, the cool wetness slicking up his cock as it jumps in response.
juicy gossip.” Tony waves off, jostling Steve into moving, leading him with a hand on his back into the guest bathroom. The Omega goes willingly, steps unsure but doesn’t fight Tony’s direction.
Steve manages to stave off the flush from his face. He hadn’t realized his fingers had been twisted into his sheets like fists, poised and upset on his lap. “I thought things would have changed for the better. When I came out of the ice, they told me we’d won the war.” Which had sounded strange to him at the time, to simply awaken be told what he wanted to hear. “But they didn’t tell me what we lost since then. I thought that these things wouldn’t happen anymore.”
“Cara’s a Mid-level Alpha. Marlow is a Low-level Beta, which means, in ten words or less, that he is hormonally closer to being an Omega. As a point of reference, High-level Betas have hormone levels closer to Alpha readings.”
He would open his eyes, muffling the sounds of his orgasms, and more than once had felt disappointed that he wasn’t met with deep brown eyes.
Steve’s jaw tightens at the Alphaic display. Tony with his (gorgeous) puffed up chest, shoulders hunched forward to look intimidating, arms flexing like he’s ready to hold Steve down if he protested any further. Right, Alphas weren’t very keen on letting their Omega alone unless it was truly needed during Heat, instinct compelling them to stay close to a potential mate.
“Okay, you get to call me Bucky. And I get to call you Stevie.” Bucky announces, very official like with his hands over his chest. Steve has to wonder at his confidence, if anything.
Steve blinks. He's sure his mouth is agape. It was the last thing on his mind right now, worried to hell about how Tony was doing and his condition. At the same time he felt as if he'd gone deaf.
"Almost dying again has- I've realized how much I've fucked everyone around me. You were right, I'm just someone playing soldier without actually following anyone's rules."
There’s no wind, no sound, no indication that something has arrived. Like all the previous times, there’s simply arms around him, strong and sure. It’s near instinctive when he grasps at Stevos’s arm.
The god raises his hand, and a round shield flies to him, fitting into his palm perfectly. He moves faster than anything Tony has ever seen, moves with a grace that Tony would equate to the flight of birds, if birds could make killing beautiful.
“Apologies. It would have been done earlier if I wasn’t so… Busy.” Tony motions to the room, almost as if he’s inviting Steve to take a jab at the mess. But of course Steve knows better than to be taunted. “A few upgrades here and there, and an anti-theft system. If anyone except you tries to start it, it just won’t.”
Tony grimaces. “Didn’t think so.” He then pauses, and looked just about ready to explain but then takes a good look at Steve. (Perfect brown eyes.) “Are you sure you can understand?”
“Steve, I couldn’t give less of a damn even if you broke his jaw, whatever that asshole did, he deserved it if it was coming from you.”
maybe. Wakanda, when America was asking for guns, grenades, missiles tanks, airplanes. It sends.” Tony pauses for a effect, though Steve could already see where it was going. “A shield. Can you imagine that? A shield? Not even a
He curses Tony for his brashness, the Ironman flying ahead, as he himself fastens a parachute and goes after them.
He shrugs. “So? You never done sleepovers with a bunch of O’s and blabbed about Alphas you’d dated?”
He wakes and goes for an hour run. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t let him out of the compound, but the treadmill does it’s job.
It’s remarkably easy to bring him, but turns a lot more difficult when a muscular blonde with a red cape takes him.
“Well, he passed you see. Peacefully. And while most of his belongings had been attended to by his will, his Omega had been left out of it. The good professor had no heirs, and thus none to lay claim to the Omega.” Jasper frowns, but then perks up. “It just so happened that our wonderful host had picked him up, paid his dues, and here he is. Lucky you.”
It’s still a friendship born from a contract, one that Steve isn’t going to naively believe would change everything all at once. He can count on Tony as a friend, and he’s pretty swell, but Steve isn’t going to drag him into anything that he didn’t agree to.
His moans are muffled by the kisses, a second finger quickly pressing in after the first, pressing deliciously inside of him, his ass giving way to Stevos’s ministration.
’ and fusses over him, makes his lean against debris and then conjures a medical kit out of thin air.
He hadn’t thought he’d be turned into a training Omega here at the blocks, but it’s not the worst thing that could have happened. He's grateful that Ed had kept it utterly simple, and Andrew had been more curious than lustful when it came to his first Omega. He knew that there was always the possibility of getting unsavory characters here in the blocks, but neither had ill-intent on him.
The heaviness in his chest overthrown only by the need to get out of his skin, so desperate an emotion to claw out. The anger that demands attention.
As always, thanks to everyone who's been reading, commenting and leaving kudos for the work. Really, I started this, happy to have a hundred-ish readers, but with the number of views, I'm inclined to think there's a bigger number to it. Thank you <3
He blinks at Clint, slowly dissecting the feelings he had. A churn in his gut that's dissipating with every moment aftwe Clint assurance. It helps that Clint has settled back down, head on Steve’s chest, strangely feels like submission. Low-Omega, he’d scented that on Clint too, a softer taste on his tongue.
Tony is rattling off the Ironman’s capabilities. Flight, repulsor technology (Patent pending), core reserves, retractable weapons, and more than what Steve wants to know about every slip and catch than he thinks he needs to.
So yeah. I'm not dead yet. Mostly in a slump but I'm getting better mostly. A bit of rough going for this chapter, stretched out too long and I can't stand the number of revisions I've done it it so I think it's best I can do for now.
“Is it my age? It can’t be my devilishly good looks, or my exquisite charm that’s been putting you off.”
It doesn’t explain why he just can’t come home with her, no matter how many times he promises that he won’t be any trouble.
But then. The fantasies changed. At some point, on more than one occasion, the visuals morphed. At first, it would be the blonde Alpha, strong, domineering, pinning him onto the bed with his body while ravishing his shoulder, forcing his legs apart with his knee. He would throw his head back, stifle a moan while he fucked his own fist for completion. A moment later, the figure above him was leaner, surer, would slowly caress his cheek and a slow grind of cock on his own. There were garbled words of encouragement, said in a warm tone that made his chest squirm.
Clint taught him how to use the ATM machine (his pin had been one-two-three-four which Clint made fun of him about), and he’d been withdrawing money from the machine since. Food and lodgings were the prime expenses of their trip, but Clint had assured him that there was no way he’d use up all the money Tony had lent him even if they did eat at five-star restaurants (???) and stay at swanky hotels.
And that’s how he ends up flying a chest full of Howard’s thing back home sealed conveniently and utterly without any other instructions. Howard did always like his secrets, figured that even with helping Tony he’d give him a puzzle to solve first.
Eventually Commander Fury steps out of the room. Steve stands to greet him, stopping the knee-jerk reaction to salute. Instead he nods.
It’s the kindness that kills him, making him sob yet he clings to the god even more, throwing his arms around Stevos’s thin waist. He still feels so warm, solid and strong. All the while, Stevos holds him tight, run his hands over his nape, through his hair, continuously swiping away his tears. “It’s alright, Anthony. I forgive you. It’s alright. I know you regret it.” Stevos mutters non-stop, in one combination or another.
The last few hours have been exhausting, he feels like he’s been fighting for days, as compared to the actual hours. Steve’s stopped bleeding while they had eaten shawarma, but he knows that Natasha took a bad stab from the Chitauri, Clint still has been of glass embedded in his bicep, and Tony has a concussion at the very least.
He’s not sure what he looks like, his face won’t cooperate but it’s painful. He can feel his eyes crinkle, jaw tighten, lips pressed into a stressed line. Feels almost like crying but without the tears, just the awkwardness of it.
“Of course they’re perfect.” Tony snorts. “My engineering is always perfect, and my math is never wrong.”
. That's what he had felt. When he'd waded through all the walls and shit he'd piled at his feet. When he could list his problems and shortcomings in his head. That was how he had felt. A lost Omega. Not even knowing how to be an Omega anymore. Too caught up in an Alpha's body to figure himself out. Maybe it was why he hasn't had a Heat since then either.
“My sweet brave mortal.” Stevos whispers to his skin, breath hot over Tony’s nipple. “As your reward, tonight, I shall worship your body.”
Tony doesn’t say much about the first few pages, filled with dreary half-finished drawings of a Brooklyn he once knew. It had been the first on his mind when Happy handed him the sketchbook, the urge to draw had never felt so desperate.
Anyway, here we are, chapter 19 (already?!) which still serves as an in-between for Avengers and Ironman 3 and then next up is Winter Soldier.
Tony fake-gasps. “Why I never. I’ll have you know I treat him very well. He gets the best motor oil the market can offer, plus I’m his personal mechanic.” But his grin goes sheepish, pushing himself away from his desk in favor of settling himself next to Steve on the lab-couch instead. “Sort of. Not really. That might have been the original draft but then all the possibilities dawned on me. Rubberducks have nasty shifty beady little eyes, so I figured, what about something else. At first I put googly-eyes on a stick but then that didn’t really work out. But that gave me an idea. Say, something that could track eye movement, face tracking, could listen to audio cues. Something that could run away at the sound of danger, but otherwise stay still. Why stop there? Voice recognition, minor commands just- Why are you laughing?” Tony pouts.
His jaw tightens and sighs, feeling a little put off by the mention of classified information. It was one thing to mention things about his childhood and another altogether to mention Erksine's work. A man who-
Ed sets him down, knot releasing them both, and arranges him to lie on his side, Ed covering his back while Andrew warms up his arms, Steve’s head still on his lap.
Then my phone got stolen :\ Some ass plucked it right out of my hand and ran off with it. So I am currently stuck with a phone that lags all the time.  As I might have already said at a previous chapter, I usually write on my phone, I even got a bluetooth keyboard just for the sake of writing for longer periods of time. Until I can get a decent phone, I'm afraid I just can't promise any chapters on time anymore. I hope to get one within the month, but chances are slim.
and couple were driven into an Omegas mind. An Omega in Heat cared for only for one thing; to have the strongest mate around. Which was why it was considered dangerous for more than one Alpha to service an Omega. Chances were that the two Alphas would be driven mad by the Heat, and fight over the Omega in question.
“Of Stark Industries. Founded by Howard Stark, now owned by Anthony Stark, his son. They started as a weapons and defense company. For a long time, they were the leading manufacturer of guns, bombs, ammunition and weapons of mass destruction.”
“Believe me, that money is all yours, Howard made sure of it. You can do whatever you want with the money.”
For a split second, his mind goes to the knife wedged between his mattress and headboard, his muscles go tight with anticipation, battling against the nonexistent cold. Steve blinks dry eyes rapidly, the blurry figure next to his bed turns to sharp focus in the dark.
Tony nods, unaware of Steve’s thoughts, turns into a shrug. “Yeah well, like Brock said I’ve got things to do now, advancement of technology things. So that. Will be later. In the meantime, make yourself at home.” Tony waves his arms. “You’ve already made yourself comfortable around the kitchen.”
“Making you uncomfortable makes me feel better.” But Clint settles down anyway, an annoyed huff. “I won’t judge. Sometimes we get horny, it’s fine now Steve. It’s acceptable. We aren’t sexual deviants if we like a knot outta heat anymore.”
Shame catches up quickly, just the thought of disrespecting Tony makes his stomach clench, he swallows and hesitantly sinks back to bed. Tony's hand is warm on his chest, a small comfort against the sharp attention of his gaze.
Steve crosses the short distance, carefully dodging the wiring and wraps his arms by Tony's shoulders.
it. The thoughts stutter in his mind, but he extends his hand anyway, lets Frank put it on and looks at it when it's on his wrist. It's a neat little thing, the band thin and doesn't look ridiculously on his wrist like most other jewelry would.
And there he is, sprawled on the bed, with not even a blanket to hide his modesty. The room fades for Tony, his eyes set on the sight of the Omega, curled on the bed, the light of the room reflecting on the sweat that dotted the Omega’s body. He’s even much more magnificent up close, muscles heavily defined with every line of his body, wide shoulders and strong thighs. Tony licks his lips.
“Sir has performed several upgrades to the estate, which includes bioscans within entry ways.” Comes the crisp reply.
“Yeah.” He answers, mouth gone dry. Bucky had answered the same thing, and then went on a tirade about seaweed and fish smell, ending with a philosophical question about whales and the deep. Buck had always been keen on fiction.
He clears his throat, and pulls out a cue card from his pocket. “Stands at six feet two inches. Two hundred fifty pounds in weight. Fluently speaks English and German. Born in New York, in the United States of America from the Ceallach Line, known to be a very robust and malleable line, with easily adaptable natures and personalities.”
He flinches when she curses, and then she curses in a different language. In the background he can see Hawkeye smirking.
The lab is a marvel, nothing like what Howard had had back in the day. It had been more like a garage, a mess of parts they’d pilfered from the enemy and new or abandoned projects lay cluttered where they could be. This was a place of creation, each item had it’s place (though he could see a small pile in the corner), with names Steve couldn’t possible know and carefully welded metal and gadget and gizmos that worked without inspection.
“Cocoa. Chocolate. With milk and marshmallows. Steve, keep up.” Tony sighs in mock exasperation, smiling anyway. “Has no one given you Swiss Miss yet? Good. It’s terrible anyway. I’ve got something much better. Come on.”
he understanda but not really. “Have it your way, I will see you soon enough.” He tips his head to Steve and walks off, past the set of doors that Steve knows leads to the lobby.
“That's kinda sucks, Steve.” He honestly isn’t sure if Clint is kidding or not. “Everyone should have
He’d dismissed the pain in his chest, the tiny flairs that stutters to an ache, thinking it was just the shrapnel wiggling around in his chest, or ghost pains from the nightmares.
“Just Steve Rogers right now.” He breathes, finding it hard to concentrate with the way Tony is curiously touching his body, exploring the canvass presented to him.
“He’d also make a good companion for a new couple, someone to brighten the home.” The lady chimes in, all smiles.
Steve already knew that SHIELD kept its eyes on him, and Fury was especially interested in his personal being for multiple reasons. He just didn’t think that Tony would resort to the same thing. Thought that the alpha knew at least when to let him be and trust that Steve could take care of himself.
And now, Steve’s not even sure if he should be touching Clint at this point. Contact has always been an Omega’s language, and the small space between them is Steve’s way of saying that it would be left for Clint to decide.
before. Not while outside of heat anyway.” It hadn’t been appropriate back then, those matters should be kept between two mates, thank you very much.
“What troubles you, Anthony?” Stevos asks, in that tone that Tony both loves and hates. Filled with a softness that places him on edge, and yet the god has done nothing to make him distrust him. Too many people have tried to take advantage of him, figures that the one person (god) that might not have any hidden motives could make Tony’s senses go haywire.
He gasps for breath, but then Tony leans in to take his mouth in a bruising kiss, stealing his air away while he dizzily tries to respond, a hand still milking his cock.
The god never complains, no matter how long Tony might use his body as a pillow. To which Tony would use to his full advantage.
Steve sighs, shakes his head. “It’s probably best if you would let a professional look over you instead.” He tries, even though he knows Tony is too stubborn to listen to reason.
“So. Codes. Breaks all the time, there’s always going to a bug, or glitch or… Just something goes wrong, especially during testing phase. One thing works, another thing doesn’t, blah blah blah, it’s a disaster, everything crashes. Getting it so far?”
Jaw set tight as Tony gets into his space, he inclines his head just the slightest to meet the Alpha’s gaze. There’s mockery in those eyes, as well as attentive stare that makes Steve wonder if Tony still thinks he’s an imposter.
Tony shrugs, already motioning for him to bring his fist down. “Well, of course. Safety measure and all, it
Steve goes on. “I froze on the spot, never really been to that many fancy shindigs before, cos in a back alley I woulda socked the fella right off me, or at least I would have tried to. But I’m in dress uniform, with my guys around me and a ton of people around me just looking. I wasn’t sure what to do.” People didn’t look at him that way, he wants to say, they ignored him, because he was the runt, that piece of Omega ass that was too little to be bothered with. With the attention, he’d become aware of how people’s eyes latched on, expecting, hungry for something from him. Something he hadn’t figured out yet.
Omega instincts tell him that this is right, comforting the Alpha and providing him with physical support. This is a good place to be, covered in warmth and protection, away from prying eyes and outside threats.
Pepper sighs, and Steve busies himself with making breakfast instead of getting into the thick of things, pouring out pre-mixed pancake batter into the pan.
There’s still that bitterness that bites at his heart at the mention of his old man, lingering pieces of broken memories that deem themselves appropriate to dwell in his mind.
Steve knows it’s a stupid question, a rude one, morbid curiosity has him hooked on the suit that seems darker and darker with the passing moment. Tony looks at him, really
“Steve. Lovely to meet you, ma’am.” He answers dutifully, smiling at her. She’s an Alpha, and the tall man hanging off her arm is a Beta judging by his scent, though profusely covered with cologne that gave off an Omega tinge to it. He has to wonder about that.
“You do.” He finally answers. It feels like a confession but it also feel like a lie. His insides boil at the implication of his own words (“I don’t need your protection, Bucky. I’m fine on my own.”), an admittance that he has to shockingly acknowledge even when he doubts them. He’s not sure if he said it for himself or for Tony.
“Flatterer.” Brock grins at him, and then introduces him to Jack, who is his weapons expert and sniper.
Tony shuffles him into his arms, as much as the space would allow. “Oh baby no, hush now, it’s okay. You’re a big boy now, you can go driving and shopping by yourself.”
, anything but innocent on his desk. No doubt Tony’s doing, he pushes himself up to his elbows, eyes huge as he takes the dildo in hand.
It’s why he fondles Stevos’s balls instead, rolls them in his palm, smooth and hairless, taut with arousal. He yanks them sharply, Stevos sucking in a breath at what must be pain and pleasure too garbled in one.
Steve shifts on his feet. “I suppose? I’d say a lot of my becoming would fall under chance, yes. Howard had shield by the dozen lined up for me to choose from, but this one was the only one that had seemed right.” He thinks back to that moment, when Howard was bombarding him with choice after choice, confounded him with alloys, weight, density and more. Howard hadn’t even offered the shield to him, it had just laid there, unassuming and looking nothing like all the others. It wasn’t flashy, didn’t have all the contraptions stuck to it, it was plain and simple, and it had called to Steve in it’s humbling way.
Different now too, he reminds himself. A little bit more normal. His psychiatrist had tried to explain, that sometimes even a contracted Alpha would stay in an Omega’s home instead. A show of trust and respect, wherever the Omega would feel most safe. Except in his case, Tony had argued that Steve would feel better if he could have free reign rather than being cooped up in his quarters, or so Phil had explained.
. Tony was surprised that Steve hadn’t been pawing at Brock with how handsy he’d been becoming with Tony. Hell, Tony didn’t even think that Steve himself realized just how much he’d been clinging to Tony throughout their journey through the studio, naked thick body pressed tight, almost afraid to be let go.
“I was falling.” Gasp. “Couldn’t.” Gasp. “Too late.” Gasps. “Darkness.” Tony sputters in between breaths.
Ed clears his throat. “You were very lovely tonight, Adam.” The fake name rings in his ears, but it makes him smile nonetheless. “A little willful at the start but that’s normal for unmarried Omegas. If you’re ever without an Alpha during heat…” He places a calling card on the bed, just next to Steve’s head. “The boy is still wet behind the ears, but I’m trying to do good by his mother and teach him how to treat an Omega properly. We’d provide for you, of course, during your entire stay, and a little extra to help you along afterwards.”
“Best friends since. Still isn’t an excuse for how he acted.” It’s the chilly end of the year, not quite time to bring out his shabby coat but Steve shivers anyway. It’s an excuse to stick closer than usual to Frank, and as usual, the Alpha says nothing of it.
They fell into each other, slotting neatly despite their awkward first meeting. Even that felt so far away to Steve now, huddled so deeply in Tony’s scent that he cannot even remember how he manages to feel happy without.
After a big lunch (it was embarrassing to see how much he had to eat now but if there was anything he learned during the first few weeks of waking, it was that America had a
Probably not what you remember. Look, I’m shit at explaining, I wasn’t lying about that. You can check the internet for a better explanation.”
Finally, the dirt road curves and Steve is treated to a huge cabin, if he could even call it that. It was made of wood, that was for sure, but where Steve was used to cabin looking sturdy, relatively simple, the sight was anything but.
It’s the last wave of Heat. It’s nothing out of the ordinary, feels just like all the rest, the desperation seeps out of him in volume, and his skins is on fire despite Tony’s touches.
“Hon. First rule around here, never give out your real name.” She says. “Saves you the dignity of being called out in public.” And up close, he can see the thick powder on her face, carefully pinked cheeks, and fakeness of her curls. Wonders how different she would look if she wasn’t so dolled up, but maybe that’s just the artist in him.
He blinks back the tears and stiffens his muscles. Stop, he tells himself. He thought he’d be ready.
But for now, it meant that Steve would feel like his body was on fire as hormones flooded his system.
Tony lays on his bed, curled tightly around soft blankets and smooth lines, yet he cannot sleep. He twists and turns, fighting out thoughts and anxiety, until finally he lets out a sob.
“Sshh Shh Sshhhh, just breathe for me, okay?” Steve soothes, bringing a palm up to caress Tony’s cheek, smiling as Tony goes through the motions. “That’s good, just a few more. Perfect.
“A man by the name of Professor Erksine. He was a doctor of medicine, but had recently taken to teaching at Cornell.” How strange, Tony was enrolled at Cornell as well, and vaguely wondered if he’d ever met the professor. “Rest assured, Mr. Stark. We’ve confirmed that he’s a virgin.”
Stevos regards him, and then walks forward to sit with Tony on the couch. Instinctively, Tony nestles into him, warm and soft where Tony can curl up by Stevos’s side.
I’ve seen yet. Dunno where Fury could have dug you up either, but if he’s privy to that secret then maybe we would have something to talk about.” Tony levels him with a gaze, reading the confusion on his face. “You can’t
“You know what, nevermind. What you do with your life is totally none of business unless you go into heat.” Tony grumbles, and that stings.
The bidding is still going, three forty as yet another Alpha puts up his paddle, the highest amount yet for the night.
Steve knows he shouldn’t expect anything. He doesn’t want to bother Tony, not after he finds about his big project for the arc reactor, and he doesn’t bother with texts, not after the first few days, lets the chatter whittle away until the silence feels comfortable enough.
Sometimes he wakes up with Clint sitting up on his bed, his eyes dark and unseeing, then Steve knows it’s going to be a quiet day from Clint.
Part of him wanted to prove to himself that he could remember, from the orphanage, his old school, his art college, the skyline he so loved, Mrs. Monroe’s scrappy dog. He drew them as they came to him, there on the jet,
Natasha wins the glaring contest by default, Clint eating huffily into his bowl. “We can start as soon as you’re ready, Steve.”
Tony looks stunning in a black suit, perfectly form-fitting, bowtie and all, perfectly shined leather shoes, not a line out of place. Steve unabashedly stares for the first five minutes because, wow, Tony is
It doesn’t come. A man falls from the sky, crushing the terrorist with the force of his fall, the unmistakable crunch of bone and splattered blood.
“A magnet. A very high-powered magnet. The best part? It’s controllable. A recent discover of mine, haven’t patented it yet, wanted to test out uses first. Wanna try it out?”
“I had a friend. Bucharus. He was also a demi-god, a son of Hermes, the messenger god, though he is also sometimes known as the god of thieves.”
He feels broken and battered, in both mind and body, a tipping point where there’s nothing holding him together anymore. Nothing except Stevos’s sure hands, providing him strength, like a pillar. Reinforcement, he thinks through the tears. Like when a dam was about to break, reinforce it with wood and supports to stop a disaster. Like his suit, after it’s been shot, pierced and whipped, he rummages right through, change what needs to be changed, and reinforces it to be better and stronger.
But, important question for everyone currently reading. Should Clint and Steve do the sex or not? :) Of course, the main pairing for this fic is Tony/Steve, but I don't see why they can't have some fun. Still, I'm a bit torn.
Tony shakes his head. "Nothing too bad, right? Just your average run of the mill super villain out for revenge."
After a few short moments, Steve shyly embraces Tony, enjoys the way Tony sidles up to him, pressing his nose to Steve’s palm, and kisses his fingers. It sends a tingle all the way down to his groin, an Alpha acting submissively for him.
Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy this chapter. And oh yeah! As a totally vague question, as in don't think about it too much and no context given.
Tony’s smile wavers, before he settles back on his pillow, eyes never leaving Steve’s. “Yeah, fine. Other than the, you know, almost getting killed again. The body is kind of shit, but that’s to be expected with old age.” A bitter laugh. “I’m being ordered bed rest for a month, but I’d give it about a week tops before I start going crazy. It’s why I’m here in the first place. At least if I go crazy I can do so in my own land. Three hectares of private property.” Tony grins.
Tony at least seems to understand, and shifts uncomfortably away, letting go of Steve’s arm in a desperate gesture. “You know that’s not what I meant.” He says, voice too low and too calm.
There’s something like a snarl but Stevos remains quiet. From his scans, some of the drones are going offline even while he performs another summersault in the air while fending off Pepper’s hysteria.
For the next couple of days he buries himself in his drawings, unable to throw off the jitters that came with the hormones. His Heat is coming up in bursts, and he finds himself eating all the time, hungrier than usual.
He wants it to last forever, keep Stevos close for as long as he can, but his legs are starting to strain in this position, and his cock an angry red that demands attention.
“I did you a big favor: I have successfully privatized world peace!” He announces to the court of assholes who make it sound like it’s his
“I’m fine.” He’s more exhausted than anything. “M’ fine, get off me you lug.” When Bucky’s prodding turns more aggressive, flailing his arms at him to make him move back.
The pained expression on Stevos’s face shows for just a moment, before schooled perfectly into the usual cool gaze often worn by the god, albeit in miniature form. “I did not want to cause you any more distractions than necessary, it would have done you no service to know that I was siphoning some of your sickness.”
So while Andrew lies on one side of the bed, exhausted from fucking Steve, Ed positions himself right behind him again, places on a condom, and lets himself in Steve’s hole.
Steve remembers that, one of the first thing he’d asked JARVIS. The answer had been sketchy at best, since Steve technically didn’t exist, had nothing to verify that he was an American citizen, no identifying numbers, no mailing address, not even a P.O. Box to his name.
He’d stopped bleeding, but the dried blood irritated the healing scar, pushing and pulling against the scab. Steve itched to wash off, all the dirt, grime and sweat made him feel sticky and disgusting.
At the end of the day, Steve’s phone is filled with pictures of the different dogs, Clint posing with a few of them in wacky positions, and a few of himself with a couple of puppies too. They both smell like sweat, wet dog and drool.
He remembers the first time he'd gotten to his knees for Tony, bowed down so that Tony could present him the necklace, felt fragile and strong at the same time when he did. He regrets not bringing the necklace, it was in his drawer back in S.H.I.E.L.D. tucked away when he’d gotten tired of people asking about it. There’s an itch he hadn’t felt before, a want to have it on his neck as some offering to Tony, some symbol that he could show.
“Jarvis.” He gulps, decision made. “Do you think you could show me what happened to Tony after he came back?”
Steve expects some sort of machine, kind of like Tony’s coffee machine (He’d learned how to use it with Jarvis’s help), a press of a few buttons and it would grind, whirr, and pump out the drink that Tony so craved, but with chocolate
Tony slaps Steve’s ass, hard, wringing a surprised yelp from Steve. “Attention on me.” He hisses right into Steve’s ear, his Omega instincts quickly unfurling as groans in response and scents the heavy shift of Alpha pheromones in the room.
“Oh Anthony, that is good.” Stevos moans, breathless as Tony sucks his cock, his hand petting the top of Tony’s head in enthusiasm. He’d just found his rhythm, bobbing up and down Stevos’s length when he’s pulled off.
“It’s was months of tracking the beast, forging our way through mountains and fields, a trail of destruction wherever it went. A Hydra with eight heads.” Stevos says scathingly. “Many men died that day, good men, and many more died in the days after. But eventually we won it somehow, drove a pike right into it’s chest, and buried it in stone and gravel until we were sure that it was dead. Bucharus died, to make sure it wouldn’t rise again.”
Rhodey huffs. “Maybe later.” Steve doesn’t have to look at the man to know he’s being given the once over. “I’ll- leave the two of you to be reacquainted.” With that, he takes his leave, closing the door shut behind him.
Steve takes a shuddering breath. He knows that look. It’s the look his Ma gets when she’s made up her mind and there’s no arguing with her.
They’re so close together, pressed as Stevos cradles Tony like he’s afraid that the man would break apart if he let go.
They’re ushered into another room, this one larger and more posh, with lush seats and dim lights like a theatre. The rules are set. Bidding starts when the curator says so, each Omega’s floor price is different, and so are increments. To bid, all they had to do was raise their numbered paddles to indicate their bid. As Alphas, they were obligated to commit to their bids, and pay the amount at the end of the auction. Until then, there was wine, cheese, and fruit for everyone.
He crashed the plane, the last thing he had said to Peggy had been an outright lie and they both knew it. There was no date, no tomorrow, and he had known that the moment he picked up the radio. He’d let the plane submerge before he even tried to get out, at that point, even
Tony digs his fingers into Stevos’s hip, uncaring if the armor causes the god bruises. He’s so much more desperate to feel something real and solid, someone to blame for the sickness. Stevos is the perfect punching bag.
There’s a hitch of breath and Stevos does just that, spread his legs impossibly wide on the couch, cock standing proud while Tony’s fingers work their way in just under his balls. It’s a bad angle, Tony can’t get his fingers as deep as he wants but he can see Stevos’s wanton expression and that’s what counts.
He jumps when the door opens, a burly Alpha heading straight through the door, only glances at him before walking right past through another set of door. He shouldn’t be so skittish, it just reminded him of how very public it was.
Tony, surprisingly, does bring home some pies for them to share. Five boxes, because Tony’s learned his lesson when it came to sharing food with Steve.
“No. It’s very okay to 'geek’ out.” Steve laughs, though the reminder of Tony brings about mixed emotions. “It’s a fantastic phone.”
“You’re very desirable, don’t get me wrong. But I don’t think you’re going to remember much of this in the morning, and frankly I want you to remember every moment when I do claim you because I’m going to put you down on your knees and make you beg me to claim you. It will be because you want it, not because you’ve been drugged to the gills with sex juice and-” The room thrums with intention, and Steve’s eyes can’t help but be drawn to the bed in the middle of it. Tony’s room. It must be. It’s well-kept and decorated.
Steve feels bad for thinking that the operations are easy. Five months and ten assignments in, he can draw the obvious differences between his time in war.
There’s a hand on his cheek that brings back his thoughts, he smiles into it, seeking the small offered comfort.
“We don’t do that here.” It’s firm, no hint of doubt in his voice, and makes Steve feel relieved. That was one thing off his chest.
It's Tony. Of course it, God, who else would it be, his mind supplies uselessly. By his messy hair and greasy clothes, it's easy to guess where Tony had just rushed from.
The journey home is only slightly distracting. Tony lowers the hood of the convertible, lets the utter honeytrap of Steve’s scent burst through the New York air. Not that it’s any better but Tony would rather not test his own self-control while he has his hands on the wheel. It’s only when he’s stopped by a traffic light does he notice the shiver in the Omega’s body.
By the end of it, Steve is put into some clothes, Tony anxiously touching him through it. The Alpha shrills a
. “Most people would try to tell me something that my father would have told me about Captain America.”
“Terrible. CCTVs are on indefinite loop, I dare say you’ve got a clear shot to the basement with at most four guards in the way.”
“You need to act all concerned, needle me into talking, until I break down and admit how shitty and broken I am, that I’m not fucking fine and I haven’t been sleeping well, then we both burst into tears, do manly hugs, make vows of bestfriendship and then stuff our faces in the morning with pancakes! God, Rogers, get with the program.”
Steve gets out of the shower, feeling warm and cozy from the warm shower. That was something he’d forever be grateful for, at least unless the summer weather came. He puts on a new set of clothes, a bit tighter and
The mangled carcass of the beast that Obadiah deems to call a suit lays burnt on Stark Industries property.
There’s a rumble next to him, a hand dipping towards his neck, soft, almost fluttering as it yanks him away from his thoughts nonetheless. “Steve? You still with me?” A firm press to his neck, Steve stifles a groan as his eyes flutter in response, a pleasing shiver running through his spine.
Bucky is very adamant about sitting with Steve while he’s sick. Sometimes, he spends the night with Steve, sneaking out of his own room to take the spare bed in Steve’s room instead.
Steve shakes his head. “M-My mo-om’ll a-adopt me b-back.” He’s not sure how it works, but his mom is much smarter than him, so he’s not worried. “Y-You?”
“He’s very well-tempered, it comes with age, he’d make a very good companion for children and seniors.” Steve overhears her as he walks closer.
to his urges, eagerly thrusting into his greedy hole, growling appreciatively when Steve can’t help but clench around his girth as he came in spurts.
It isn’t long before Tony finds it comfortable to move, and Stevos bends Tony’s body into a position where he can fuck him deep, hands spreading Tony’s legs obscenely wide to push in further.
So Steve drew him now as he remembered, from a worm’s eye, slumped against the metal like he was used to it, lax in a way that Steve hadn’t seen Clint be before. His arms lined with bunched muscle that would have made his younger self jealous, at the same time he would have been unable to tear his gaze from them. The artist in him loved the human form, every contour and dip of muscle, fat and wrinkle was like texture and personality on the page.
Slow as molasses, he sheds Tony of his pants, pulled down just his thighs to reveal his cock because of course Tony wouldn’t have bothered to have underwear on, not in his own home. Nor, if Steve were to guess, while a wanted Omega was so close by.
He sighs as Natasha continues with the slides, quickly skipping past the rest of the military Alphas without so much as a word.
He’s aware of the scene he’s making, his entrance slick with fluids that run down to his thighs, his fingers pressed into his hole to entice the Alpha, submissive and pliant. His cock hard and aching, balls pulled low by gravity.
Stevos helps him get up, the god’s touch is warm on his hand, and scoops him up. He doesn’t look at all burdened by Tony’s weight. Tony takes the opportunity to wrap his arms around the god’s neck for balance.
“It’s fine, I can schedule a meeting for next month, recheck my blueprints see if there’s anything I missed.”
Steve snorts, nibbling on Tony’s nipple just to teach him a lesson. Tony only fidgets somewhat, scrubbing a hand on Steve's hair as if he’s a unruly pup.
It doesn’t take much, Stevos loops an arm underneath Tony’s legs, another on his back to keep him steady while he carries him off. There’s a stubborn part of his mind to wriggle free and plant his ass back on the couch, but then the rest if his brain complains that everything feels too heavy to fight Stevos off, and Stevos has never hurt him despite multiple opportunities to.
“Clint!” Steve hisses, definitely blushing now. “Is it really appropriate to talk about that right now? Right after the mission?”
It brings to mind what SHIELD might have in store for him. He can only believe that Director Fury is doing it from the kindness of his heart for so long, and eventually, he does have to ask what he might have in store for him. He knows the way the Director looks at him, calculating and patient. Knows it from his time in war and when Alphas when they’re trying to decide if he’s worth the trouble or not.
“I was just listening to suggestions.” Tony corrects, another kiss, this time deeper, knowing, builds and builds until they break away panting. “Go take a shower before you blame me some more. I’ll be here. And brush your teeth, your mouth tastes like dick!”
George shrugs. “My Nana said that this was better for me. Maybe she meant I should get adopted so that I can have a new mommy and daddy who will take care of me.”
Steve salvages what little of his schedule he can. He still runs on the treadmill when he first wakes up, and JARVIS taught him how to switch channels for the television so that he can watch anything he wants.
“Yes, Agent Rumlow. Very formidable on the field, commander of STRIKE.” Natasha adds, giving file a quick lookover as if she could find some discrepancies just by that.
Yet, he can’t help but feel bitter about everything, feeling about as much forced to be here as the Omegas are. Obie points at the ones that interest him, says something jovial and light-hearted. Howard silently views the Omegas, uttering minor compliments to the ones that catch his eyes.
He needs more time, just a little bit more time, to right his wrongs and undo the damage he has done to the world.
Tony doesn’t say much after that, Steve doesn’t really expects him to, but he doesn’t speak to Steve after either. They stare at each other, mere feet apart but separated by the nightmares of their past, until Steve moves forward.
Ed steadily pushing in, bare and huge, not even giving Steve the time to adjust, making his senses ring at the feeling of being stretched open. He’s wet enough that it doesn’t hurt, but there’s still that discomfort of suddenly being filled with more than he is prepared for. Ed only stops when his hips are flush to Steve’s ass.
“No, maam. It’s fine as it is. I’m still going to be participatin’ part-time.” Even if he knows it pays less, at least he can come and go as he pleases.
Through dirt roads, something country playing on the radio, Steve has trouble taking in the scenery. He fiddles with the necklace around his neck, the thought of Tony's condition worrying him. Would he find Tony hooked up to tubes and machines, struggling to keep him alive?
Brock shrugs it off. “Just so you know, you’re terrible at being an Alpha.” But he grins nonetheless and pushes himself off the table. “I’ll be at the gym if you need me. Keep the doors locked, windows shut, and leave all the cooking to Steve.”
“We do have beef shank, rib eye, ground beef and a cut of wagyu. Though I must warn you that steak has been putting Sir in a sour mood. ”
“Looks like I am up.” He smiles, and gets on his feet. “See you two some other time then.” And he pushes right on through.
“Out. Get out. You are officially banned from the lab until you admit that robots are better than dogs in every possible way.
Clint gives him a look, one that pulls his brows together in thought, lips forced into a neutral line, his body lax where he lays. But. But his eyes say it all, usually cocky full blue eyes are dim, even dimmer than they had been that night. Where that moment had been filled with shame and anger, this one is filled with depressing acceptance, of hollow defeat and estranged emotions.
With minute thrusts, he’s fucking himself deeper into Steve, the base of his cock stretching out Steve’s hole relentlessly, slow and steady so that Steve would feel his hole giving way to Tony’s dick.
“Well? Get naked. We ain’t gonna fuck with you bundled up like that.” Steve all but pouts, drags the Alpha right back up to wrestle away buttons and buckles. He owns this moment, Heat demands he does, impatiently pawing at the Alpha’s bulge through his pants, and there’s a lot of fumbling around, what with Steve’s hasty fingers and the Alpha’s own earnest.
Tony. Standing by the door, eyes wide at Steve. Hmm. Steve would have thought that Tony would have preferred to be naked during the Claiming, his mind blurrily processing the proceedings. Tony grabbing his wrist, hauling him up, pushing a blanket at him and when it becomes apparent that Steve doesn’t know what Tony wants him to do with the blanket, drapes it over him and proceeds to push him.
