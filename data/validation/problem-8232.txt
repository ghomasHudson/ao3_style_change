Steve couldn’t help it. They were sweet and pathetic, and he loved them dearly. He laughed and nodded his consent while they congratulated each other fervently.
“Is that the super serum or are you just happy to see me?”
Tony:
“You are the literal worst, Stark. A scoundrel!” He had to focus to breathe through Tony’s rich laugh, head thrown back in delight. “What about Tinder?”
Steve sighed. “Alright, alright, I’m going! But you need to promise not to be so quick to answer the door.” He got up and hugged her. “And you need to come visit me at the tower and meet everyone.”
“Fine! But we all want breakfast. This one’s been cooking it for hours and we weren’t allowed in here,” he said, gesturing towards Tony.
“It’s too easy,” Tony says, heading down to land on a rooftop. He sets Steve down gently close to the ledge of the building.
“Peter has been telling me all about you two, I’m so glad —“
His brain was so clouded, so full of contentedness and so busy filing all the ways in which Tony Stark had touched him, he had no strength to rationalise anymore. The worry was present, when was it not? But there were silver linings, materialised in the whispers and the kisses and the way Tony got him to open up. He would have been embarrassed, and in all honesty he was, but then Tony snuggled up to him and it was enough. He maneuvered both of them so he could pull a blanket mostly over Tony, and settled in for a little nap.
he shrieked. “Oh my goat!”
argued that he was Captain America even when he was a scrawny little shit), things were anything but calm. When he danced on stages that trembled under his weight, he was anything but calm. When he was fighting Nazis there was nothing calm, especially not the people around him. When he came back, when they went into battle, nothing shouted calm. Even in the domestic setting of their weird superfamily, calm was a very apparent and relative thing. Someone always had something going on, and they relied on each other too heavily not to empathize.
The hot water felt amazing. On the one hand, Tony had eased so much of his anxiety. What was left he’d pushed to the side, empowered by the man’s kind touch and heated kisses. The tension he felt had nothing to do with unfulfillment, and everything to do with the anticipation of being with Tony once more. He took his time indulging in Tony’s expensive toiletries, trying to formulate back-up plans to potential problems just in case.
“I would like to touch you now,” Tony asked slowly. “And if you’re not okay with anything I’m doing I want you to tell me to stop, okay?”
“You must be more tired than I thought if you’re not fighting me on this.”
“Funny,” he said cuttingly. “You’re real funny, you know?” There was a fake bite in his voice, and he smiled to chase it away. “What are you willing to do for a ban lift?”
“Oh, shut up, you started it.”
“Tony!” Steve calls, and the shield’s flying up towards him.
He tried not to groan because he was more polite than that, but after surrounding himself with infuriating people it was getting increasingly difficult to contain. It spoke volumes about the level of comfort he had reached, both within his team and with Mrs Williams, if he wasn’t even all that bothered. Not when she laughed wholeheartedly like that.
“Thank you, I try,” she said and got up for a small curtsey. It looked ridiculous and Steve loved it.
“I’m sure I can’t come again. For at least like,” he looked down at his cock, felt a jolt travel through his spine, “oh, I don’t know, say seven minutes?”
Steve shrugged. “It’s your tower, Tony. Maybe you should do it?”
“Bed, I’m not hungry for food,” he said shyly.
He opens his mouth to say as much, but he gets cut off by Rhodey’s, “No!”, and then by Bucky adding, “We were betting on when!”
“Keep being this annoying and I just might.”
Steve scoffed. “Bordering on harassment, you know. This objectifying needs to stop.”
Tony snorted and Steve kneed blindly towards his general direction to keep him in check. “Impressive doesn’t feed people, sir,” Steve offered.
“Stop. It’s – stop, Tony.”
Clint:
“You better be joking,” Tony told him. “I know you’re not entirely joking, but you better be.” He settled on jeans and a t-shirt, turning to show Steve.
He briefly entered his room to change into jeans and a sweater, and put his formal wear in a clothes bag, then he followed her upstairs to Tony’s room. As soon as he realised what she was doing, he stopped in the door. “I’ll just wait here,” he told her. “It’s not right.”
“I am,” Steve reassured him. “More than okay. Come on, you must be getting sore.” He was sticky and covered in spit and cum and lube. Definitely more than okay.
He inhaled right under Tony’s jawline, drowning in the smell of cologne and something unmistakably Tony. “Run away with me,” he said with a laugh.
“Hurry up, Stark, we’re not getting any younger here. Well, Steve and I will probably be fine, but I’m not so sure about you…”
The sparkle in Tony’s eyes was a solid promise. “Come here.” Steve went with no hesitation. It was too late to be embarrassed and he was too far gone. He let Tony maneuver him into turning, then almost keeled over when he felt lips on his ribs. Little pecks here and there, then a swipe of tongue, an open-mouthed kiss, fingertips on his knee. “You’re gorgeous. Beautiful. So beautiful. Grip your cock, darling – there you go, now turn to me, lemme see you.”
“Asshole,” Steve muttered. He got up to get himself a beer just to have something to do.
Steve took him into his throat, ignoring the ways his eyes watered or the uncomfortable pressure. He looked up; Tony’s mouth was hanging open, the flush spreading from his chest to his neck and jawline. His eyes were blown wide open, pupils enlarged. Steve moved. Up-and-down, up-and-down. When he needed air, he replaced his mouth with his hand, twisting it, then dived back in to focus on sucking the head into his hollowed cheeks. He could feel spit dribble down his chin, tears running down his cheeks, and amidst everything, the only sound he could focus was the frequency of Tony’s moans. He could feel his testicles tighten, the shaft pulsing in his hand.
“Oh, I’ll pass,” Steve said with a small smile. “The serum removed my gag reflex, it wouldn’t be fair.” He was happy to make his friends laugh, but he was still not going to slobber over some vodka filled jelly dicks. Even though he could. And he would probably win. Still wasn’t doing it.
Steve smacked his buttcheek playfully. “Go shower!”
“Tony -”
“You answer, you talk! I’m in the lab following your movements and the next thing I know you go quiet except for cursing, and the cameras on the CCTV stops working because Doom is an asshole, and I have no visual, my drones are far, and I have no idea what the hell is happening!”
He woke up with a start, jolted right up on Tony’s sofa. The blankets pooled on his lap, the man’s t-shirt clung to him like second skin. Dum-E whirred cheerfully at him from the corner where Tony had instructed him to patrol. He had no idea how long he’d slept for, all he remembered was Tony caressing him, his face above Steve’s own, gentle and kind and –
“Pivot!” Steve interrupted.
Steve did as he was told, too tired and spent to argue. He kissed the remnants of the most glorious blowjob in history off Tony’s face, the specks of come and spit that escaped as he was too busy
That seemed to make Steve focus. “What? No! I’m just… I’m okay now, it’s okay.”
“Actual harassment,” Steve repeated and took his top off, folded it, and crossed his arms across his chest.
“Mhm,” the scientist offered from his glass. “Chloe, sit down and get something to eat. And ditch the lump on your arm, he’s about as useful as a hole in a condom.”
The ceiling was white, then off white, then it disappeared and he could see the night sky. A door opened somewhere in the room.
Tony leaned on his elbows, bending the jelly dick so he could suck on it and also look straight ahead. His eyes seemed glued to Steve’s thighs. He figured, as a last desperate thought, that the scientist was staring at whatever was in front of him, and at the highest point he could without rolling his eyes. Steve wanted to ignore the way the man’s throat bulged as he relaxed it to accommodate the phallus. He really, really did. But he’d seen the Godfather, and there was a bit there where Michael gets hit by lightning when he falls in love and Steve had no idea why that was where his mind took him, but it damned felt like Thor unleashed his thunder god power right through his spine. Tony swallowed around the thing, and Steve would swear until the end of time that the bottle of tequila he didn’t realise he was holding most definitely
deep.” The entire room burst into laughter again.
“He’ll be there tomorrow, don’t worry,” she said kindly.
“That makes absolutely no sense,” Steve sighed.
“For one, I would very much like to know why you’re circumcised. Because holy shit, this is a beautiful dick!” He emphasised his enthusiasm with a well-gripped stroke.
“You got me,” Steve repeated with a slur.
The man smiled widely at Tony. “You know I don’t like to stay put for too long.” He turned to Steve. “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
He focused hard to see her through the bleakness of his thoughts. “It’s Steve,” he said as kindly as he could. He’d flown in, fucked their country up, spewed some shit about freedom and now he was gonna go and they would still be stuck there.
“What the fuck are you on about now?”
“Yeah, Margaret messaged to say they’re having a blast –”
A common topic every year when May rolled around. Or whenever someone had a birthday. A common topic overall, really.
“Morning, Captain Grumpy. Peace offering from the shit team,” she said and handed him a travel mug filled with blissful hot coffee.
He washed his dick in the sink, like the savage he was, and put on clean underwear and comfortable tracksuit bottoms. He walked out of his room with a heavy heart and a very loud mind, and even more annoying, more sexually frustrated than he’d been in a long time. Excellent. Christmas couldn’t come and go quick fast enough.
The entire process was awkward. He got on the floor next to the chair and contemplated the easier way to proceed. Full-on was the best option he could come up with, so he reached under the piece of furniture and lifted it above his torso. For a minute, everything was fine, but soon he felt Tony shifting and the next thing he knew, he was staring at the man’s face. As far as Steve could tell, Tony was kneeling on the chair, hanging over the back, watching him benchpress the massive thing.
“Bruce.”
Steve kept quiet as he ate the candy, meticulously avoiding both looking at Tony and answering. When the silence had stretched on for long enough, and he was certain he wouldn’t choke up if he started speaking, he finally did it. “Thank you, Tony.”
“Yeah.”
“Thank you, Tony. Fuck me now?” he laughed again.
Vision was quiet for a second. “Thank you, Captain. How can I help you?”
“Of course. I shouldn’t be long.” Vision was doing so much better with adapting his speech patterns. Contractions were the newest addition.
Steve pulled the blanket around them, then wrapped his arms around Tony to help warm him up. It was probably not the best time, but he was suddenly feeling very self conscious. “Was that alright?” he asked in a small voice.
On his part, Steve did his best to carve it as neatly as possible. It wasn’t like he had a lot of experience, or any really. Steve didn’t know a lot about a great deal of things. So he stood and tried to remember any circumstance in his life where carving a turkey had been a thing. If he’d known this was going to happen, he would have allocated three minutes to a youtube tutorial, risking the merciless teasing from Tony. In all fairness the scientist had been good with mocking Steve about his searches, but there was a knowing look. Maybe Steve was also paranoid on top of everything else he was discovering about himself.
“Yeah, yeah okay! You’ve got to be joking,” he whined, “how the fuck do you look like that?” he asked, waving frantically towards Steve.
“On his birthday!” Tony repeats unnecessarily, with exaggerated outrage.
Steve could hear shuffling, then steps. He heard the wheels of a chair being pulled closer, then he felt Tony tapping his shoulder. He opened his eyes, taking a couple of seconds to focus in the bright lights. The first thing he noticed was how close Tony’s face was to his. Then he saw the blue smear on the man’s cheek; it looked like frosting. Which led him to the logical conclusion that he should look down. It took some willpower, but he succeeded. Tony had indeed baked him cupcakes, covered with red, blue, and white frosting; he sat in front of him, biting his lips nervously.
Steve whined lowly, holding Bennu closer. “How did you even find that? Coulson promised.”
“Listen, I’ve been very dedicated to my flirting, okay?”
“Deadly,” she added over him. “
Tony rolled his eyes. “How did you even get in?”
Steve cupped his cheek, smiling at him. “Someone else?”
Steve shrugged the best he could. “I’m a big fan of consent. And I love the way your mouth quirks up here when I do it,” he said, touching a fine line that had formed as the man smiled.
“Okay? I haven’t even undressed yet.”
He didn’t stick around to see if there was any response to his swearing. He switched to airplane mode and shoved it in his coat pocket. He turned to Darcy’s roars of laughter and Bruce biting his lips struggling to contain his.
the entire Howling Commandos!” Steve told him, throwing the pillow at his face.
“I need – please!”
“He has that effect on people, don’t worry,” Steve repeated Tony’s earlier words.
“Okay,” Tony nodded.
“I’m going to take my shower now, stop being a little shit.”
It turned out everyone was excited about it, so Steve went with it. He volunteered to be in her line of fire, shield up for when she reacted to the surprise. It went as well as expected: she walked into the dim room, shot at his shield, and pretended to be very surprised while wearing a cocktail dress and high heels. Her smile was bright however, and Steve found it endearing.
“Tony.”
Natasha sighed. “Steve, I’m sure there’s someone we can send, some agent who’s on duty anyway -”
There was a chance Clint smashed his phone because every attempt to call him ended up going to voicemail. There was also the loud noise right before the line went dead. Tony had his tablet out in no time.
He was glorious-looking, beautiful with his left leg bent so he could push into the heel, with his toes curled in pleasure, with his lips swollen and red, spit trickling down freely. The arc reactor lit his chin and face, giving him an ethereal glow. It also lit the prominent bulge that had formed as he nestled Steve’s cock in the depth of his throat. Steve bent to touch it; he rubbed it affectionately.
Bruce:
“We’ll duck. She can’t shoot all of us at once.”
He sighed. “Bucky’s supposed to send food up, but he’s also a dickhead so I’m not sure what he’s doing.”
, not even a hug, and Steve carried the entirety of the blame.
“Shut up,” Steve pushed through clenched teeth.
Thor helped once more. “Loki, is that you?” he asked again, prodding Bennu gently. She bleated. “What? I don’t understand what — oh, wait.” He kneeled on the floor and shut his eyes, holding his throat with one large hand. It took a couple of seconds, then he refocused on the room. When he opened his mouth again, a soft bleat came out.
“I’m sure that’s somehow insulting.”
He was playing dirty, running his fingers on Steve’s sternum, where the skin was heated by his flush. In the blue glow of the arc reactor, he wasn’t sure it was visible, but he could definitely feel it. “I don’t suppose I can distract you from having this conversation?”
Steve groaned. “You wouldn’t.”
, but Tony was in danger so he scrambled to the doors, punched in his personal code and stumbled in. The music was blaring, a familiar tune by now. Steve was glued to the floor, frozen in fear and unable to move. He focused on finding anchors around the room.
“What are you, five?”
Steve frowned but the room dissolved again and when it put itself back together, Tony was sprawled on the desk, his head hanging backwards off it. Steve watched in horror and fascination as his dick disappeared in the other man’s mouth rhythmically. He saw his throat bulge again and again as Tony swallowed his dick.
“STEVE, FOR FUCK’S SAKE,” he heard, and it sounded like wind was rushing in his ears as well. He had taken off as soon as he saw the kid was in danger, even if he would not make it to him in time. He had to try. The remnants of snow under his boots didn’t help at all. He was thirty feet away when he heard Tony shout “duck, roll!” again and he did, throwing himself to the left and rolling away from the incoming aerial assault.
“And you thought you needed to dress up to seduce me!” Tony pulled him to his feet and out of the room. “Speaking of which, what’s this I hear about you seducing me?”
“Hey,” she interrupted him, “Christmas on the 25th is better than no Christmas. Pietro and I, our parents weren’t religious and back there it was religious for a lot of people. So it’s the thought, the family,” she told him, trying to keep the conversation private. It didn’t work at all, of course.
of sorts, like they were uncertain how to keep going. “Don’t mention Jesus when you’re in my bed. Why
The problem was, Steve decided, that the connection he was so fond of was mostly one-sided. Yes, Tony had been kind to him, he’d been supportive and helpful, he’d been comforting and protective, but Tony had also looked at him with clear pity in his eyes. So Steve’s love was fundamentally different than Tony’s. And it would have been supremely unfair to hold that against the man. At the end of the day, Tony owed him
His first thought was that Hydra had captured him. He could tell he was being watched, so with his heartbeat gone into overdrive, he listened for signs. There was a clear indent on the mattress next to him, and he tried to come up with a plan. If Hydra had him they wouldn’t get in bed with him, right? Was he even in bed anymore? He wished more than anything he could dive and reach for his shield. But its usual spot at the foot of the bed was empty in the name of diplomatic missions and Steve could have honestly punched something in frustration.
“I’ll ground you both,” Wanda says then, voice short.
“You were parallel with time,” she started. She held Steve’s hand in both her own while she kneaded his fingertips. “But not anymore. You are here, now.”
“Please don’t,” Steve said with a smile. “I don’t think the serum was meant to protect me from such things.”
“It’s too late to try and say that it’s nothing, isn’t it?” When Tony nodded, he continued. “It’s been… not great since we came back. I feel cold whenever… I don’t know how to put it.” He paused. “When it gets bad I feel the cold like… then. Like I’m freezing again. It’s mostly at night, but it hasn't been this bad since we were looking for Bucky. I thought it would go away by now.”
There was wonder in his boyfriend’s face. “You’re insatiable.”
Tony half-attacked him, kissing him hard as he pushed him backwards out of the elevator. He took a second to decide on a direction, then proceeded to move them to a sofa. He sat Steve down and joined him, immediately going to kiss his cheek and jaw.
Steve suppressed the shamed-filled shudder than threatened to run through him. He cradled Tony’s head with his other hand. The man was pressing his lips to the inside of his elbow, alternating short licks and sweet kisses. His fingers entwined with Steve’s, pulling his arm out to have better access. “Your mouth…” Steve started, but lost the focus to continue.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake. Fine, brace yourself.” Against his better judgement, he speeds up to where Rhodey’s annoying the bot. When he gets close enough, and Steve has his knees up behind the shield as well, he lets go of the man, launching him into the Doombot. “But if you get hurt I get to lock you in the tower, you can grow your hair and beard out and we’ll reenact ‘Tangled’ without the evil witch!”
Decisions were normally pretty simple for Steve. You know, get into a fight or not? Fly a plane into a frozen sea or not? That sort of thing. This was a tad more difficult. Either way, there was definite potential for humiliation and / or extensive over thinking for weeks.
“Woo! Dare please.”
“I have no idea. This woman kissed me, and then I saw… and then I couldn’t breathe, and then it felt like before, and I don’t have a clue,” he said shakingly.
“You made it!”
Natasha tutted and sat down on the arm of the sofa. “Wanda, where’s Pietro?” The young girl visibly bristled and a spike of magic lashed out from her fingers.
He can, it turns out. The bot is decommissioned by their joint efforts, now a pile of future scrap on the ground. Steve is sporting a cheeky smile when he stops next to him briefly. “You make it hard to focus, sweetheart,” he whispers.
Steve snorted. “Not yet.”
Steve was torn between a sigh, an eyeroll, and a heart flutter at the other man’s antics. So he settled for all of them. “So they brought in a new one for us. And it doesn’t work, excellent.”
He lifts the faceplate. “You’re the one that I want,” he sings offkey, smiling as genuinely as he can before he takes off once more.
“Called in some favours, talked to Peggy, the usual. Is it okay? I’m sorry if I’ve overstepped the line or -”
Tony snorted. “All those undercover missions as dominatrix really fucked with you, Natasha.”
“What?” It was Steve’s turn for confusion.
“What? I’ve never been to Madagascar, we weren’t deployed there and you know that seeing how you memorised my file.”
Tony fell on space next to her, and proceeded to tilt his head too, and pout a little, and somehow get his eyes to sparkle with wetness.
The song’s lyrics - he listened to them for the first time -
“What? No, no, this one I actually know. Bruce showed it to me on youtube.” Tony didn’t look convinced. “Really? I’m like… the epitome of honesty!”
The rollercoaster gave Steve the jitters. Not because it was scary – a medium sized ride with wooden tracks wasn’t frightening at all. But it looked old and it creaked when it ran, and Tony was out of the suit and not enhanced in any way except for that big brain of his, and what if he couldn’t catch him in time? Steve hated the idea, hated the visuals it brought. But he went on with it, sat behind Natasha and Tony, hands clenching on the metal safety bar, ready to act if something went wrong. Tony seemed to have a good time, all woos and unlikely shrieks and hands in the air. Natasha made sure to film the whole thing and send it to their team back home.
A woman in the cabinet took the stage, followed by another. They boastfully lauded the success of their government, the steps taken to ensure this and that and he distinctly heard Tony grind his teeth next to him. He listened enough to fuel his rage and know his enemies, so to say, but his attention was solely on his teammates. While they both seemed supremely calm and with the programme, their tiny tells stood out to Steve, who had put his life in their hands time and again.
“Shut up, shut up, shut up!”
There was a nasty gash running all the way from her elbow to her wrist. Her cheek was bruised, and he noticed the dark circles under her eyes. He was by her side immediately.
“Yeah, no,” he repeated her earlier words, and Steve couldn’t help but find it endearing. “I tend to kind of break things when I get out.”
“Good! You did well,” he said, and Steve couldn’t explain how, but it settled the pain in his chest.
“Not now, Thor,” Steve replied, refusing to let them know that his knowledge of Tinder was limited at best. Darcy once mentioned using it to meet people for casual sex, and he was more concerned with Bruce breaking a beaker at the time than finding out more. “Is now really the time?” Steve asked with a frown.
“Was this a good kind of shake-shake?”
“No, you bumbling buffoon. Everyone was cleared by me, including your sorry ass. Now move,” she said one more and Steve saw her hand clench on his shoulder.
The country remains unnamed on purpose, partly because I don't want to shift focus to an existing country, and also because I lack the patience to invent a brand new country in Eastern Europe. But! Fun fact: I am Eastern European, every bit of specific description is very much rooted in things that actually exist. The fish is real.
“Yep,” Bruce confirmed and took a sip of what Steve was sure was spiked hot chocolate.
“I thought it was a dream.”
Steve was tired. Perhaps the demons would be appeased and he wouldn’t dream once he fell asleep, but regardless, his last conscious thought before drifting off was telling them he was safe and warm and in Tony’s arms and honestly, they should fuck off.
“I spent time undercover in a frat house,” she shrugged. “That enough for you?”
There was a vague sound of Rhodey whooping and Natasha clapping and Bucky cursing softly and Darcy laughing and Clint patting Tony’s shoulder. It all registered in the back of his head, including the proud look Tony threw him, and Maria inviting them all to eat a bunch of dicks. Steve turned away and walked to a bottle of scotch, conversation with Fury forgotten.
Steve’s world was narrowing down, and he knew he had to act fast. Before the world would collapse and he would come to with his friends pitying eyes glued to him. So he forced himself to chuckle, trying to be convincing. “Don’t worry, Clint. I knew I’d have to face that one day.” He looked towards Natasha, and she seemed to know, as she was prone to do.
“Shut up,” Steve tells him.
“I believe you’ll find out,” she started, playing with a knife that had definitely not been there thirty seconds before, “that you have been laughing at our antics and failed to participate. Now that isn’t very nice, is it?”
Steve’s voice is grounding in his ears when he yells, “Vision, down! Duck!”
forgive him if he did.” Steve swore Bruce’s eyes flashed green before returning to the usual brown. “Now can we go before I sweat my skin off?”
But he had panic attacks. He had panic attacks every day. He mostly knew when they were about to happen - the way his pulse increased, the claw gripping his throat, the pressure in his chest -, so he made excuses to go sit in the toilet or his room, or any other room where surveillance was minimum or nonexistent. They left him weak, sweaty. He felt hot when he was struggling to catch his breath, but as soon as he anchored himself in the room he was in, he was left feeling cold and lonely. They asked him sometimes if he was okay and he nodded; even if they didn’t believe him, they let him be. He appreciated that.
“What did you see?”
“Thank you for saving my brother,” Sue said quietly, brushing off dirt from Johnny’s face.
, consequences be damned.
With a sigh, he turned on his back, shamelessly thrusting up into Tony’s hand. “What would you like to know?”
“My days of Starking people are over, I’m afraid. Casual sex just isn’t the same when you might be called away on a mission.”
He found Tony finishing a sandwich of sorts, sitting cross legged on the kitchenette table, wearing only pants and the blue glow of the arc reactor. “Your pal is an angel,” he informed Steve. Then he looked up. “Oh, fuck me,” he blurted out.
Steve focused of his coffee. “No idea what you’re talking about.”
So, Steve’s life was hectic. He was fine with it. There was a lot to be grateful for, mostly being alive, so he took it all as such and using Fury’s words compartmentalized the shit out of it.
He sighed and unbuttoned his shirt to do it up properly. “I can’t tell this 80 year old woman who barely has anyone left in the world, let alone in this hemisphere that I won’t go over to fix her lights and boiler.”
“Wanda!” Steve calls.
Steve had to clench his leg muscles to keep himself from walking up to Tony and kiss his face. This was new. This never happened in battle where Steve was focused solely on his team and their synergy. But Tony’s only body part that wasn’t obscured by flashy metal was his frowny face, and Steve had already established he was gone.
“But that doesn’t mean I didn’t want to do it,” Tony was saying when Steve focused once more.
, but he pulled his t-shirt up to cover his nose and he kept low to try and get away from the smoke and
He was so tempted to say something crude, but it would only further hide the real cause of his nerves, and Tony deserved better than a poor attempt at deflection. “It’s silly,” he started, and wow, now was definitely not a good time to observe once more how Tony could communicate solely with his eyes. “Ah, for fuck’s sake. I want to offer you a bargain for the birthday ban lift, and —“
The kids smiled and started shouting their names at him. He shook every single one of their little hands and accepted that Ben, who was almost five, wanted to hug him. He picked up the kid and walked back to sit down opposite to Tony.
Tony waved his words away. “Don’t worry about that now,” he said. “Actually, don’t worry about that at all ever. That’s what friends are for, right?”
Steve nodded, once more uncertain he could trust his voice. Tony pulled back, taking his body’s warmth with him. There was a moment when he locked eyes with him that made Steve think he was going to kiss him. His heart felt like it stopped, but then he kept going, farther away from him, and Steve could breathe again.
“Well, I am a spy, and there might be cameras so you might as well be right.”
The elevator dinged when it reached Tony’s penthouse. Steve swallowed heavily. “Yes.”
“She says she’s grateful for her new legs,” Thor informed them. “And that she thanks Tony for saving her life.” He listened carefully to Bennu. “And that Steve seems to be too sad, but that she’s here for him whenever he needs it.”
Bucky:
wanted to get drunk before he punched someone for being stubborn and impossible. Bruce. Before he punched Bruce and got him to Hulk out and Steve was going to stop that train of thought right there. Trains. God damn it.
Steve stopped eating. “Why didn’t you say something? It’s not fair to -”
Steve cupped his cheek. “Joke aside, I am sorry,” he said gently. “I was just…”
“Because he hadn’t slept and couldn’t entertain himself for another two hours or so,” Natasha answered and shoved the scientist a little.
“I feel like at this point there isn’t any point in even sighing, that’s how far gone you are,” he said and put on a show of struggling to get out of bed. “My age has finally caught up with me, I suppose.”
“Okay, who told you about the car?” the man asked turning around, hands on his hips, something smeared on his cheek.
The closest he ever got to being really drunk, he spent the next day not only violently ill, but also supremely embarrassed of how he’d acted in front of Bucky and a couple of others. He’d also witnessed Bucky time and again live with the next-day remorse, enough to know how it was by proxy. And that was exactly how he felt as the onslaught of memories hit him.
“Dare,” he sighed.
It took a while before he was able to leave the bathroom, and he spent way too much time choosing a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, all in the name of postponing leaving his room to find Tony and thank him for being a good friend the night before. When he was certain that short of going back to what would probably be a restless sleep, there was nothing else he could do to put it off, he finally braved the door.
“No! You?” Steve said with mock surprise in his voice. He was willing himself to be calm.
Steve grabbed his hair forcefully. “Every time I’ll see your hands I’ll be thinking of this, Tony. It was bad enough I was fantasising about your mouth before, but now I
“Of course. Dinner will be twenty minutes.”
The other “good” articles were along the same lines. There were a couple of opinion pieces he found on Medium and CNN that were articulate and polite. They pointed out the mistakes in his approach, but offered praised for his ultimate goal. In the privacy of his mind, he was humbled and allowed himself to feel the tiniest bit of pride.
The room felt stuffy even though it was cooled down to what Steve knew was a pleasant temperature for non-serum-fucked people. It still felt like it would soon envelop him and replace he air in his lungs. Nat touched his shoulder on the way to her seat, on the other side of Tony. Once she sat, they joined her and Steve smiled politely at the people sharing their table. They introduced themselves (potentially again) and he tried for his best diplomatic face. It seemed to have worked because they all turned to the podium where someone coughed a little to get their attention.
“This fight is yours, Captain. Maybe you will. Maybe you will not. There is fire in your future. You were cold, Steve Rogers. But there is fire in your future. Burning angry fire. Smoke. Danger,” she repeated.
“What I want is for you to take me in your throat and finger me until I weep,” he admitted with a sigh.
“Fucking perfect,” he mumbled. He started brushing his collarbones, then his shoulders. “I’ve always had a weakness for you, but I’ve been obsessing over your chest and arms for so long now. After your little bench pressing marathon, this has been all I could think about.” He bent to kiss his heated skin.
hated as the previous one, their diplomatic visit would weigh a lot.
Tony’s eyes flew open. “What? No, I’m just thinking of you tied up to my bed now, I needed a moment.”
“Yeah, when I was like six,” Tony deadpanned. “Steve…”
“I can’t possibly remember whose birthday is right after mine,” Tony said dismissively — and Steve knew that was bullshit, Tony liked to know
“I’m dismissing you, agent,” Steve insisted. “I’m going to text Pepper now and let her know. I promise you’ll still receive the extra pay for working today if you promise to hug your mother and not go too wild with your friends.”
Steve lets go and lands more gracefully than Tony thought possibly. He’s up in no time, rushing to help. “Vision, what’s Thor’s status?”
with pining and with acting like an idiot. Although this definitely wasn’t acting like an idiot, but at least they were communicating. “Well, we’re not communicating, I’m just shouting and actually making everything worse.”
“No! I watched him he can’t be his shield look I have –” He doesn’t. He doesn’t have the shield. He looks up at Bucky and his eyes are burning now. He forces himself to keep them open. To
“Captain Tantrum! You’re back!” Darcy shouted from Thor’s shoulders. “Come on, tell me what you need on this tree and I’ll sort it out for you on my mighty steed!”
“Will you be needing accelerated healing to walk tomorrow?”
She snorted at his exaggerated tone. “Truth or dare?”
“Promise?”
“Oh?”
“The liquid in her hot chocolate was bourbon, she’s been pretending Thor’s a velociraptor for fifteen minutes before she switched to a mighty steed just as you walked in.”
Steve turned on his back, rubbing at his face in defeat. “If I get up, is there any chance you’ll be less irritating?”
“Um, hi, Steve? Right here to your left? Hi, yeah, what do you mean
“Will you be hard in that wholesome Captain America suit of yours?”
“You’re annoying is what you are,” Steve muttered.
“I’m small again,” Steve whispered, unable to look away from Tony’s unmoving smile. The scientist’s mouth moved, but Steve couldn’t hear anything.
and so, so glorious when Tony moved another finger to join the first one. He was on full display, opening up to Tony more intimately than he ever thought possible. Then Tony began scissoring patiently, dragging his blunt nails on his way out, short-circuiting Steve’s brain mercilessly.
“Okay. Okay, I’ll let it go for now. But if this keeps happening you come straight to me and we’ll work it out, yeah?” Tony’s hand on his shoulder was so familiar now, Steve was actually surprised when it tightened in what he catalogued as a caring gesture.
Many more handshakes later, they were finally led to a ballroom of sorts, equipped with large round tables full of different sized plates and at least three forks. Steve almost sneered. He stole a glance sideways to both Natasha and Tony, both looking much more at ease within that set-up. He tried his best to mimic them.
“Tony!” The man’s name spilled out from his lips uncontrollably, need latching his strained voice.
“I only tried the first couple of them, wanted to –” He pumped some lube out, pushed it in his needy hole with his finger. The sound was obscene, arousing. The same finger in, out, just a couple of times to warm the lube up, and he made quick work of the first two beads. He clenched his hole on the small thin section, testing how it felt. Not nearly enough, but a start. “More,” he said mostly to himself.
“I’m not just gonna sit and hope everything’s cool.” She shrugged, then ruffled his hair affectionately. “Not when I could inquire a bit and nip any potential argument before it has time to form.”
“Rhodey…”
“Talk to me, Steve,” Tony said, and it might have been his imagination, but he sounded like he was closer now. “Look at me, please.”
“So?” he asked timidly.
Tony seemed to reconsider. “No, it’s too easy.” He looked around, then down at his phone. ”You know, these are really not bad photos of me. I’ve seen worse.”
bad… We could start our own country –”
Tony shook his head in disbelief. “Well, this is surreal as fuck.” Then he seemed to remember something. He disappeared for a couple of minutes and returned with a bit of cloth. He walked to Bennu and smiled at her. “You get a superhero cape,” he informed her gently. “You’re one of us now.”
Darcy:
“The Amaretto!”
A hand on his shoulder, but he can’t deal with it.
“Unbelievable.”
“I love you. Feels like –” Steve was floating. There was no other better way of putting it. He lost track of time, lost himself in the cadence of Tony’s voice. “Please,” he whispered in Tony’s ear.
–” He grabbed Tony’s hair, conscious of his own strength, much like he’d done in the dream. “And you insisted but –”
“Look at me.” Steve did. The fingers pressed on his tongue, moving up to settle in his mouth. “Suck.”
“What?”
“Get out,” Tony laughed.
“Captain America!” he exclaimed as he sat down heavily in the chair.
“What do you mean you’re not staunchly straight?” Tony managed to ask over his rant, but Steve was gone.
“We just want coffee, we’ll only be a minute —“
Honesty was primordial, none of this would work without it. “I don’t think I can focus with it on.”
“Oh, no.”
Clint was bordering on hysteria, Steve was almost sure. He actually felt bad; as the sober one, he should have reined them in. But they seemed to genuinely have fun. But Clint was distressed. But Tony was radiating with happiness. But it was at someone else’s expense. But. Fuck.
“He what?”
“Steve, you couldn’t possibly –”
“I am serious… and don’t call me Shirley.”
“Yes! I spent the last six months of my life trying to find a way to be close to you, and you go and do some dumb shit that I can’t even begin to understand.” She turned to Steve. “Like, how do you even name a star after someone?” Steve shrugged helplessly.
Steve’s therapist said it was healthy to have some distance, that codependency was dangerous for both of them. She’s said some more shit — Steve sighed, it was just the anticipation that made him think of it that way. In truth, he was slowly finding himself opening up to the woman — a gentle lady, somewhere in her 50s (Tony had her entire file memorised, he could tell him the exact age), with a distinct hippie look, who took no shit and sometimes made him laugh so much he thought there would be nothing else wrong, ever.
“Mhm, okay. So Monopoly’s out of the question as well then?”
And then there was the novelty of his plan. The exposure that came with the plan. The certainty of the plan’s success. The pleasure. The mental image of Tony’s hungry look. The plan itself.
Steve did. With a single finger, not really putting any pressure on it. “Is this enough?” he asked cheekily.
Tony was on the floor, wearing a Christmas hat and his Christmas sweater, surrounded by children who rallied around him. There was a little girl on one of his knees, and a little boy on the other. They both kept touching his beard and his face, as if to make sure he was real. Steve had a very distinct urge to do the same. Behind him, the tree was revolving slowly, and Steve checked around the room for Wanda. There was no one else there except for Tony and the children. Wouldn’t that be a great band name? Even a great superhero team name.
“I’m rooting for the both of you pretty hard, Steve.”
“Bench press that armchair for ten minutes.” She pointed to Tony. Okay, okay, this was not so bad. The man moved to get up, and Nat shook her head. “No, you stay on it, sunshine.”
Steve hovered over him, nuzzling his chest and pushing the pillow aside with his head. When he finally reached the man’s face, he kissed his cheek sweetly. “And?”
Things settled down for a bit. When Doombots attacked, Reed Richards called Tony and when Tony ignored it, proceeded to call Steve who also wanted to ignore him but was essentially a good person. It was just to inform them that they got it, and Steve really wanted to stay out of it, but the line went dead right after a horrible scream and he sighed, suited up, grabbed Wanda and ran out to help.
She tried bringing up the old fortune teller. Steve opened his mouth to discuss it, but decided against it. Whatever the woman had said, however much it seemed to fit with the immediately-after events, it was ultimately purely coincidence. Engaging with what he had been told, and even more than that, discussing it with another soul meant he would allow it to reside in the depth of his mind. And all he could associate with what Matilda had predicted was Tony and Tony and him together and Tony Tony Tony. So it was a staunch no from Steve.
in this thing?”
It was instantaneous. Tony was out of his chair, next to Steve, cradling his face in those calloused beautiful hands and kissing him before he had time to add anything else. “Where do you want me?” he asked.
“Ohhh! It’s the PSA videos, isn’t it? He’s doing one of the PSA videos,” Tony explained to Bucky.
Had he been paid to say what he said? Had he been paid by Tony Stark to say what he said? What were Tony’s interests with this emerging country? Why was it Steve who was sent there? Who decided? Who was Steve’s direct handler? Who would answer? What was Steve’s chest circumference
His face fell. “Oh!” He made to get up. “I’m sorry, I’ll go, you’re right.”
Steve bristled and took a step forward. A hand came down on Jones’s shoulder, a hand Steve knew. Natasha, bless her beautiful deadly smile, was there to help move the idiot away. “Come with me,” she said with a smile.
Steve sent a photo.
“You do?”
He must have looked puzzled, because Tony reached for his hand gently. “You okay, Cap?” He looked sinful, with his swollen reddened lips, the few fine bitemarks Steve couldn’t remember leaving on his collarbone, the way his leg muscles were defined by his position - on his side, toes wiggling restlessly. When Steve didn’t reply, he sat up straight and pulled a pillow on his lap. “What’s wrong, Steve? We can put our clothes back on and talk if you’d prefer that. We don’t even have to touch, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have pushed you to –”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Just a bit surreal,” he replied. “And what expression? I didn’t have any particular expression?” he scoffed.
“You don’t even know what—“
“I’d build it myself.”
“I’m ready to punch Doom in the face,” he says in a determined voice.
“Sure.”
Steve sighed. “Stark…”
“Like I’ve come three times,” Steve answered.
“Ah, I see. And Thor?”
Steve:
“Are you flirting, Captain Wonder?”
Tony was smiling now, a wide grin that reached his eyes. He turned to Natasha. “I love when he gets all righteous, makes my skin go tingly and my –”
“Shove it, Stark.”
Steve rolled his eyes. He didn’t actually remember. His best guess is he was agonizing in a corner about making Peggy like him. He tried not to choke on air when Tony’s hand went up following Rhodes’s. “You are going down. Literally,” he heard the scientist say. Pepper joined them as well, downing her entire champagne flute. Bruce ran his hand down his face.
“Take it up with HR,” Steve says, his voice fragmented by his breathing. Tony shouldn’t find it as stimulating, but he does anyway.
The movie was fine, Steve wasn’t blown away by it. He had seen enough 90s movies to pick up on the filmography and effects, the way people dressed, as well as the general disaster genre aspect of the movie. Rhodey was adamant he did not look like Emmit Reese, causing great amusement among them all.
“I started working for you,” she replied and pushed the box towards them. “Come on, grab a sweater, put it on, stand around the tree. Someone help Pietro, please,” she instructed quickly. “We need a photo of the official team - Rhodey go next to Tony, maybe some of your maturity will rub off on him. Photo for the auction first, and then we can take some for us.”
“Oh, come on!
“Bint,” Steve offered automatically.
“I’m Andy Martin, Sir. Technically, I was a SHIELD employee but after… yeah, I got a job for Stark Industries and Agent Hill vouched for me so now I work directly for Miss Pepper,” he explained in that clipped tone agents always retained.
Tony licked his earlobe as he replied. “Because I want to choke on it for hours, it’s so pretty and smooth and —” The ode to Steve’s dick was interrupted by its owner kissed Tony hungrily. He could imagine what that tongue would feel like on his oversensitised cock and moaned again.
“Or dare?” Tony continued, his head moving the other way to make them look even more endearing.
The more they spent stuck in this situation, the more time they would be going without sleep, the less time Tony would have to sober up, and the more Steve wanted to kiss him senselessly. So he pulled the man up and walked him to bed, tucked him in, and said good night.
“I’m here,” he told him with a smile and a kiss.
too old and his age was finally showing. He wasn’t certain he could still blush after the super serum, but it was a blushable situation. So, yeah, he had been in the army and they were all filthy and he wasn’t actually as much of a prude of people made him out to be. But it was still a blushable situation. There were things he couldn’t shake despite everything he’d seen. And jelly dicks on a tray was one of them, apparently.
“Because…?”
Tony scoffed. “You know when you have sixty tabs opened and three of them are singing and one of them is a pop-up telling you that you’ve won –"
“Why, thank you, darling!” Tony replied cheerfully.
“Tony?” he croaked, voice rough.
“Please,” Tony whispered. “I need –”
Tony chuckled, still chasing Steve’s palm until it rested on his head again. He sighed happily when the fingers were back in his hair. Only then did he twist his wrist, just a tiny bit, but enough to make Steve shudder when he felt the pleasure again. “Like that?” he asked cheekily.
Tony shrugged. “There’s a Norse god, The Hulk, and two enhanced kids who can kick as - butt! I said butt, Steve!” Tony yelped at the kick in the shin.
“It’s the serum,” Steve muttered, embarrassed by the way his dick twitched as Tony’s hand touched lower on his hip bones.
Steve sighed. “I think there’s a place in some afterlife where Howard just tripped and had no idea why.”
the serum hadn’t fully fixed that. “Uh…”
“Not until much later, no,” Clint replied. “Deepthroat competition!” he said and Steve wasn’t even sure who groaned the loudest.
“Why me? You’re the one he –”
Hammer threw his head back and laughed loudly. “Feisty! I like it! It’s a dangerous type to have, don’t you think, Stark?”
“Here,” Bucky said, and dropped the stand next to the tree. “Lift and to the right. Other right, Stevie, for God’s sake have you never put a tree in a stand before?”
my birthday…”
Steve snort-laughed, then realised how it came across. “Sorry,” he sighed, “I didn’t mean for it to sound like that. I don’t feel uncomfortable around you, I think I feel uncomfortable around myself.”
“Oh, yes,” Steve insisted. “I dare you.”
“Yes?” he answered cooly. It was unfair to take it out on Tony, but seeing how everything sucked, Steve honestly didn’t care all that much.
It took the better part of an hour, but they were victorious. After much consideration and measuring, they bought a twelve feet tall monster tree. Steve sighed at Darcy’s suggestion, but snapped a photo of her standing next to it for comparison. He ignored the four hundred something messages and sent the photo. It truly was monstrous. Steve loved it.
The vet - June, Steve had found out - had declared her healthy and almost fit to work, which Steve assumed was an inside joke of sorts, because Tony had laughed. It was a beautiful sound regardless of who had caused it, so he smiled in return. She left after recommending a balanced diet and ways to handle her in order to ensure she would not be hurt.
“She’s one of –”
“What if I ask nicely? Or if I really misbehave?”
“Good, evidence,” Tony said absentmindedly as he approached the flat screen tv. “Oh my god, look!” He tapped Steve’s forearm repeatedly until the latter reacted.
“Tony. Enough, it’s just us in a car in a foreign country. I already checked for bugs, everything has been cleared by SHIELD. Please,” she told him simply.
Steve went. He used all the self-control he had to lower himself back on Tony slowly, the anticipation building inside both their chests. When their dicks finally touched, Steve could swear he would come instantly. Tony’s moan reverberated through him. He moved his hips the tiniest bit, then encouraged by the way Tony kissed his collarbone, started moving rhythmically.
Steve nodded, certain that if he opened his mouth to speak, he’d just blurt out his feelings. And things had been going well, there was no reason to ruin everything by shouting about his love and such. He moved to the other side of the bed to get water, then he offered it to Tony silently.
“True.” He seemed to deliberate for a minute. “Then I’ll stay up and watch the tv. I’m not tired anyway.”
“Tony,” the man sighed.
Once they make sure the twins were settled in their new positions, Steve turns to Tony. “Can you take me up? We need to reassess.”
“You okay to tone the scene down?”
“This is so good, Tony. Gimme.” He pointed to the other party hat. It was spray-painted crudely, obviously in a rush. Steve loved it.
Clint pulled the cowl back, his hair sticking up everywhere. “How does your hair even
“Okay,” he exhaled. “Okay, yeah.”
Tony licked his lips and sipped his wine before replying. “You’re so beautiful,” he almost whispered. “So?”
“I should have known it was you who suggested it.”
They let him be, bless them. Back in his room, he realised he could feel his fingers hurting because of the cold. He knew that realistically he was safe and definitely not cold, but he couldn’t help feeling like he was freezing, extremities first. He took a scalding hot shower, teeth chattering even in the steam-filled bathroom. When he got into bed, he made sure he turned the thermostat up, then proceeded to put on sweatpants and a top and bundle himself up in at least three blankets. The cold was unyielding. He fell asleep accompanied by the sound of his own laboured breathing.
“You were tenting, it was too hard to stop myself. Shit, you know what I mean. Just call him already!”
Steve heard the Polaroid go off. He couldn’t see Tony properly, so he waited, trying to look as enticing as possible. His thoughts were focused solely on the man, on how he was going to execute the rest of his plan. How it would feel to be watched. To be allowed to come. God, to finally come. He felt Tony’s fingers gently prying the handle out of his mouth.
An aide came by all flustered and informed him he was going to wrap up the event with his speech. His. As if he hadn’t just been given the entire fucking thing to say on stage like a puppet. But that was a road best not taken in public, in a foreign land, without his shield and in a confined space. The anger at being used wasn’t new, but it was best left for sleepless nights and solitary overthinking.
Later Edit: I remembered to give even more thanks to Joey, as well as credit for bouncing ideas with me on the phone while we're traumatising the intelligence officer I'm sure is listening in on my conversations, shout out to him for staying sane. The nervous speech, unplanned and all came from personal experience - I fucked up a TEDx presentation back in March and it stuck with me so I think I needed to get it out. Thanks for sticking with this guys xx
“We’re not stealing any more goats,” Steve told him.
“Yours,” Steve mumbled, hidden in Tony’s shoulder.
The second time he was left speechless by how attractive Tony was, Steve blamed it all on Father Christmas and the stupid, very stupid revolving Christmas tree. The fairy tale-like snow didn’t help.
There were logic problems there, but it wasn’t worth debating them, so Steve took the statement as it was, and leaned in to pull the duvet tighter around Tony. “Me too,” was all he said, ambiguous as it was.
Steve spluttered. “How? I got everyone something.”
Steve stopped as soon as he disabled the Doombot. “How is flirting with me acceptable in the middle of a battle? I swear if we had a working HR that wasn’t an angry guy who disappeared off the face of the planet when he was inconvenienced…” Steve tried as hard as possible not to hyperventilate as he said the words.
Steve cuddled him, cupping his head to kiss him gently, unhurriedly, enjoying the time they had together away from the world. Eventually, it got heated again. They’d moved from innocent to hungry tongue-heavy kisses, to hips bucking uncontrollably, to Tony sliding back next to Steve and prompting him to continue talking. His hand resumed his previous action, providing too little to get Steve off, but enough to get him hot and bothered.
It was time. Both because Tony asked so nicely, but also because Steve needed to do something, anything before he burned up completely. He brought out a bottle of lube and the beads from the box.
He must have fallen asleep at some point because Tony shook him awake gently when they’d landed. He felt like he’d been through a grinder of sorts, there was restlessness gripping under his ribcage, the tingles rippling outwards. He clenched his fists. He was groggy, quiet as they disembarked and headed inside the tower.
The large man’s body shook in time with his vigorous head shake before she finished. “No, no,” he said, sans accent and as convincing as he could. “Miss Romanova, as beautiful and –”
Steve laughed. “I’m sorry too, Tony. I don’t know about the inferiority complex you mentioned, but I do know that I care about all of our slightly dysfunctional extended family so much that I become stupid at times.”
Steve nodded. “You?”
“Your instincts!” Steve barks. “Here’s a fire, here’s a bunch of superheroes. What do?”
“Tony, is that the tv fish?”
“I’ll tell you what you can quote—“
If Steve was a tiny bit honest - and he was! - her headmistress voice was fairly hot. Objectively, like how he always admitted she was a stunning woman with an even better penchant for caring about his sorry ass. “Uh, no?” he answered.
“All of it, I don’t know. To you being there for me, I’ll let you,” he whispered. The storm inside his chest was fading, but the aftermath meant that he felt exhausted. Perhaps Tony would let him sleep there for a while. Just this time, so he could get a bit of rest.
Clint:
If he were any more of a coward, Steve would have been afraid. Instead, a rampant giddiness took over, and even if his mouth was dry and his legs hurt from the way he had them propped up, he wanted it. “Wanna suck you off please.”
Tony snorted. “Steve, I’m joking! I’m a grown ass man, for fuck’s sake. Even if chaperones were still a thing, I’d have… I don’t know, eaten mine by now.”
Bruce sat next to him, and if Steve were to choose, the man was probably his safest bet. With his kind eyes and gentle demeanour, at least he wouldn’t get chewed for being less than subtle. Steve handed him the bottle and they shared it between them in companionable silence. When Bruce pulled a second one from seemingly nowhere, Steve nodded his thanks.
They walked to where Clint was standing proudly admiring his work. Steve counted fifteen identical phalluses in various colours wobbling on the tray. He had a sudden urge to just go to bed. Maybe he
Steve stalled, because this woman could read him like an open book. Pretty much everyone could, if he was honest. But Marjorie was particularly adept at that. So he sipped his tea and hummed noncommittally. “Yeah, nothing, just a quiet sort of gathering. But it’s really not that big of a deal or anything,” he said and he was perfectly aware he was babbling.
“You have no right to -”
“I’ll send you the stuff up.”
Clint:
He’s squinting now, desperate to get his bearings and go back to where Steve is. Barnes is pushing him down on the ground, coming up on his right side to pull him into his chest.
“Friday, for fuck’s sake, fucking fuck!”
Tony gave him a smoldering look. “Captain, I have a folder on my private server with photos of you and unintelligible plans I made for when I finally worked up the courage to see if you were actually into me or not. And research porn.”
They had totally bribed him with it, and he had been totally okay with it. They sat him down in the middle of the large sofa, flanked by Peter to his left, and Bucky to his right. They presented him with a large bowl of his bribe and he relaxed into the soft cushions, starting to munch on the offered snack. He didn’t know what they’d picked from the Movie Bowl - a system they’d implemented early on in their regular movie nights. It was a large bowl full of bits of paper where they’d written movies Steve and sometimes Bucky hadn’t seen when they were otherwise busy with the ice and brainwashing respectively, but that were generally considered must-watch either by them or by specialty websites.
“I don’t know, Cap. Will you let me?” She cocked her head to the side, flirty as always. The stars on her head dangled dangerously.
The man was grinning, so it was a logical assumption to think he knew exactly what he was doing. “You’re playing dirty, Stark,” Steve admonished lightly.
I can't give you a date for the next chapter, my mental health is fucking with me and my writing so it's most likely gonna be a while. Thank you for being patient.
The prime-minister started talking then, and they dimmed the lights to focus on him while servers brought out appetisers which made absolutely no sense because they seemed to be struggling in the half-darkness. The speech was passionate enough to captivate and full of crap enough to make Steve’s upper lip tremble. On his left, Tony seemed engrossed – he could have been asleep, it was a talent. Natasha kept her smile on as she picked at some cold cuts and Steve wished he could go for a run shirtless. In the rain. While the Bee Gees wailed in his earbuds.
Steve spent hours watching the ceiling after their casual party finally broke up around two in the morning. He got up and tried drawing, but his hands didn’t cooperate - it seemed a common thing these days. He tried reading the new book he got, but he couldn’t focus. He tried doing crosswords, but his mind was loud and eventually he gave up and waited. He could normally fall asleep as soon as he wanted, courtesy of years having to do it in various army settings, but it seemed not even that worked right. Steve was a downright mess.
Steve nodded, unable to fight whatever plan Tony had. The man scooped his nape with a steady hand, clenching slightly and pushing his head up. Steve tried to help as much as he could. He felt himself being lifted, then pushed down the couch. Tony moved around a bit, and when he lowered Steve back down again, the surface was different. Steve opened his eyes. Tony’s beautiful face was looking down at him; he had maneuvered himself under Steve’s head.
“Well,
“Honestly, I was just looking through footage of the attack.” He walked to Wanda and touched her shoulder carefully. “A job well done, kid,” he told her. “How about a shower and sleep? And maybe some stitches? I promise I’ll make them give you the nice local anesthetic and a lollipop at the end? Maybe an Iron Man bandaid?”
“Tony,” Steve says quietly.
“And the Avengers figurine collection,” Tony added patiently.
The chopper was there, tired pilot and all. Steve got in, secured his clothes and himself and signalled where he needed to be. It was a short ride, and he pointed out the nearest roof that wouldn’t raise too many questions.
“How is this my life? How am I part of a team that wants to ogle me?”
because Tony would have pushed through for him. For any of them.
“Ouch, Rogers! I’m wounded!”
Couple of things: the "stealing a goat is super romantic" came from the ao3 tag of the day blog. Joey sent it to me one night and the idea stuck, so meet Bennu the goat. I've read a post about the name of the foundation Tony opened in his mum's name, but I'm gonna go with Maria Stark for this series.
“You’re not my handler, Stark. I acted in the best interest of the endangered party,” he defended himself tightly.
Nat went first, shooting down all the little moving ducks with a ferociousness that was at least a little unsettling. The man cheered her on, pulling levers to drop more targets. They were attracting a crowd. Steve went next, adopting a much more relaxed shooting style. He was preparing for a second round of shooting when he felt Tony approach him and speak quietly not-quite in his ear, but close enough that he could feel the man’s warm breath on this neck.
“Don’t make me throw the plate next, Barnes,” Tony warned.
Tony moaned when Steve found his semi-hard dick and fondled it, desperate to reciprocate. “I remember looking at you then, your eyes… But I didn’t think that was for me.”
“Me, a person whose job this is, who has the abilities needed to enter these situations and help?”
The laugh that followed was worth the embarrassment. “Okay, I’ll take that for now.”
When she left them Tony was already on his phone. Bruce made a vague noise, gesturing wildly with his half empty glass. After several failed attempts at words, he nodded and followed her general direction. Once he was far enough, Steve turned and punched Bucky as he promised himself he would.
“Not a horse, Tony, a mighty steed!” he emphasised. “How about you bring the box of decorations over here,” he asked the kids, “and I can get you up on my shoulders so you put them in the tree?”
“Shush!” Thor whispered loudly. Then he spoke to Bennu again.
“Well, for one, we’re on my table. And also, you’re right. I apologise.
“Whoa, boy!” Darcy shouted and made Thor stop. “Well then,” she said with a smile, “come help us make this your tree as well.”
“Hmm?”
He was up next, once the loud applause calmed down and he was introduced and subsequently invited to take the stage. He had to act quickly. He leaned forward to get the others’ attention. “Natasha, truth or dare?” he whispered.
“Listen, it’s an important movie that has a good cast and most importantly, Tommy Lee is badass in it,” Pepper defended it.
Natasha called him back immediately.
“I wish drugs would work on me. Bye, Stevie!”
She scoffed. “You should know better,” she told him, wiping down the burns on his arms. Steve looked at her work. She seemed to be in her forties, and the motherly air around her comforted him.
“I’ve wanted you ever since I first saw you. Even before that, when I watched footage and saw photos,” he said between kisses. His hand went to cup Steve’s cheek, then pulled him closer so he could kiss him properly.
“Please,” Tony whispered.
He flies them towards the fire. “You’re making it really hard, Cap,” he says, smirking under the faceplate.
Tony smiled. “You’ve been so good for me, Steve.” He undid the clasp. “The belt stays on, yeah?”
Steve was many things, but not made of stone, and not a quitter. And focusing on someone else took his mind off his own shitty thoughts. Steve was many things, and even maybe a bit selfish. “So she’s younger than you.”
“I’m taking the goat.”
The leather was cold, a grounding point if Steve had every felt one. It fit snugly under his balls, then Tony pulled it up, encircling his cock loosely at first, then tighter until it was finally secured, and Steve
“No, that pet name doesn’t sit right in your voice, not to me,” he said thoughtfully.
Steve dives shield first into the bot, making it stagger. He proceeds to bash it repeatedly, ignoring the obvious difference in size . “I don’t know what that means,” he says as he uses the edge of the shield to peel off the plating on the bot’s back.
One. “Rhodey can beat anyone in the world at Mahjong.” Two. “Jane has the nicest handwriting out of all the scientists, possibly ever.” Shot. “Ugh.” Three. “Bruce’s smile can light up a room.” Four. “You’re the kindest person in the world - I will literally do twenty more pushups if I don’t have to drink this stuff.”
“What what car?” He paused, business face on. For a second, Steve thought he was actually serious. “I’m joking, I’m joking,” he laughed. Steve joined him. “I’d never get you a car.”
Tony’s entire body seemed to relax. “Oh, thank god.” He sat on the floor next to Steve’s legs, resting his forehead on the man’s knee. “You scared me good, Cap,” he said in a muffled voice from somewhere next to Steve’s leg.
It was Tony’s turn to snort slightly. “Yeah, I know exactly how that feels.” They were quiet for a while. “Anxiety is horrible, Steve. But again, if you wanna talk about it, I’m here. Up to you, soldier.”
“Oh. I…” Tony fondled his balls, licking his nipple at the same time. When his hand moved up to twist around the now-leaking head, he sucked on the hardened bud. “Fuck. Okay, okay. Uhm… the throat thing. Oh, yeah! Natasha’s birthday, you were sucking the jelly dick and at some point you took it really deep and – please, Tony!” When his request garnered no significant change in action, he continued, frustration obvious in his words. “And your throat bulged in the most obscene way. I thought I would go insane thinking about it. That was actually the first time you left me speechless,” he admitted through gritted teeth.
“Almost as good as Goatzilla,” Nat offered.
“Yeah?”
“I will,” Natasha said calmly, eyes not leaving her phone.
. The man was burnt, disfigured on his entire left side, body contorted unnaturally. From the walls, he could hear evil cackling, all around him the heat felt like it was melting his skin. When he looked down to his hands, they were just burning bones.
“Is that why you always seemed a bit unimpressed when Cap scolded you?” Peter nodded, absently following Bennu around ready to catch her. “I have no idea where you learned to defy authority,” Tony deadpanned, disbelieving eyes fixated on him.
“Justin Hammer, you’re supposed to be in prison!”
Tony sighed. “I really fucking hope this room isn’t bugged or we’ll be in for a viral surprise tomorrow.”
“Sounds great. You know,” Steve got up to stretch, mindful of the rush of blood as he did so. “I could eat.”
“I would personally pay to see that,” Tony’s voice cut in their conversation as they stood by the bar.
Steve was ready to come, he’d been ready to come since they got into bed together. He started fucking into Tony’s mouth. Slowly at first, getting used to how much he could push, how fast and how deep. On his part, Tony hollowed his cheeks and hummed around the hardness that was rhythmically fucking his mouth. Occasionally, Steve would slide down to his throat, stop for a second, and pull back out.
Tony’s eyes looked like they were welling up, so Steve cupped his cheek and moved away from the glowing light in the man’s chest. “No! I mean, I mean I don’t mind, I just… People aren’t overly fond of it, and I’m not overly fond of being an oddity of sorts, especially when I’m with someone I like so much. You’re free to touch it, if you want.”
Tony then moved to his thighs, massaging them as he caught his breath. “Look at you,” he repeated. “God, I want you.”
“The question or the orders?”
They had made it off the ride alive, which Steve was immensely happy about. Steve was distracted by the petting zoo and the children enjoying all the animals when he was presented with cotton candy. As soon as he saw the pink fluffy texture his mouth watered. He had enough brain left to check who was offering it to him.
“Not even if I ask nicely?”
“She’s really into you,” Steve said, not really caring at this point. “You should ask her out –”
“What? How did I not know that?”
“Shhh, none of that, Steve.” Tony was hugging him tightly. “I wanted you to come, it’s my favourite thing in the world. And down my throat, too, what a treat.”
“Aunt Peggy would have kissed you,” Tony said laughing. “I could kiss you!” Steve’s knees almost buckled. “Pepper texted and said it’s being contained, she’s issuing press releases right, left, and center.”
“Have I not embarrassed myself enough today?”
“Stark, you and I both know the only reason you’re against it is that you didn’t think of it first.”
“No! Please, in my mouth.” He kissed Tony. “You said if I’m good I can get a better reward, right?” He bottomed out, stayed still with Tony’s cock pressing snugly against his prostate. “Please come on my tongue,” he begged, licking at Tony’s lips.
“Now she tells me! You couldn’t have done that before I convinced myself Steve would never like me like that?!” Tony’s outraged but also amused, a good combination of giddiness to experience.
“Yeah, yeah I know,” he said, and kissed her temple.
Clint:
“Cap’s old, he doesn’t know any better.”
“Steve, I don’t know where your mind went, but I’m currently half-naked and hard in bed with you, about to take my sweet ass time ravaging you.”
More speeches as they were brought the first dish. He was mature enough to accept the food was good, but he was wondering how a country with
Wanda emerged from the lab wearing an old t-shirt of Tony’s and hair sticking out everywhere. She looked younger than usual, even with the bandages on her arm, and Steve felt a spike of endearment towards her. She walked up to them, fiddling with the hem of the top. “Pietro’s going to be alright,” she said quietly. “The last time we had a tree was when we were six,” she offered.
About two hours in, Rhodey lost to Steve at arm-wrestling for the seventh time. He was about to ask for a rematch, when Natasha asked to replace him. She sat down on the bar stool opposite him, smiling widely. On top of what Steve assumed was an actual crown, she now sported a plastic tiara adorned with large silver stars that bobbed whenever Natasha moved. Her eyes were as focused as always, but there was a subtle flush to her cheeks.
“Taking care of you,” he said simply. He started at Steve’s left ankle, massaging up on his calf before doing the same to the other leg. Then he took turns on his thighs, pressing methodically all the way up on one, then on the other. He rubbed and worked at the knots in his muscles, kissing on the trail of his fingers. “Look at this.” He handed Steve a couple of photos.
“I didn’t mean to –” he started, not knowing where to go with it. Around him, the noise had switched to conversations and movement. It was dizzying.
“Not to mention they would end up in a war, probably against us, and I’m too old for this shit, not nearly as old as Steve, who is also too sentimental for this shit, and you’d either kill them all eventually or leave on holiday cause you’re bored.”
“Shh, you’re okay, darling. I’ll go slow.” He kissed Steve’s sweaty hairline, nuzzled his temple. “I know you’re sensitive, I’ll be careful,” he said. His fingertips ghosted over his balls, then he moved up just as delicately. “I got you,” he whispered.
“I thought you were coming with me?”
The knot in his throat expanded all at once and he choked on thin air. He grasped at his throat and chest, feeling the soaked fabric under his fingers. The violent heat had replaced the cold and now he was burning up, he could feel it right under his skin. He pulled his top off, rejoicing in the momentary cool air. Through some sort of out-of-body experience, where he seemed to float above his stiff body that was still rooted to the floor, he worked to anchor himself.
“I’ve worked it out, it uses a fraction of its power and I have this really handy stand for these babies.” He grabbed a suit torso, dropped it in the middle of the oven and gingerly placed the tray on it. “Friday, nine minutes starting… now!” He shut the door and turned to Steve.
“I know, darling. I know,” he said, and moved away briefly to dribble more lube on his fingers. Then he picked up the pace, feeling more like what Steve wanted. He was almost there, he could feel nerve endings flare up every time the fingers were all the way in.
“Oh.”
Steve whined lowly. “Please, I’m so close!”
“Yours,” Steve gasped. His oversensitive cock was trapped between their torsos, the friction almost unbearable. He was full, nothing else existed other than the way Tony’s cock felt buried as deep as it could go. He cupped Tony’s jaw, fingers spread down on his neck. “Look at me,” Steve told him. “Tell me.”
Tony fake-gasped and slapped Steve’s arm repeatedly. “It’s too late! Quick, Steve grab her and run!”
“You getting jealous. He
Steve’s words died in his throat when the man took a testicle in his mouth, sucking it rigorously. Then he moved lower, and nothing in the world could have prepared Steve for what was coming. Tony had flattened his tongue and proceeded to lick his tight hole in broad strokes, holding his balls up with a hand and pulling an asscheek to the side to make room.
Steve let go reluctantly. He turned towards the door to see Peter with Shuri in tow, shepherded by a smirking Bucky.
“Objectively, yeah. Maybe, I don’t know. But it’s different when you say it,” he shrugged.
Vision was nothing if not efficient. Within minutes he was flying away with their Christmas tree. Considering it a small victory, Steve threw himself into the hordes of people, entering shop after shop. By early afternoon, they were finally done. Ladened with baubles, and hundreds of yards of lights and tinsel and ribbon, they finally hopped into a taxi and made their way to the tower. Steve made sure to not buy Bucky any burgers.
“Tell me about it,” Steve agreed, and let her get ready.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted. He then turned around, back straight and pulled up to his entire height, goat still secure in his arms. He rocked the scared animal in his arms to help it settle down. “Jones, is it? Back off. You’re in the way of the doctors and firefighters. And you’re overstepping all your boundaries.”
“I can do that,” Tony offered. “But that wasn’t the deal, was it?”
He understood the name, understood enough of the exchange to end it there. He caught Tony’s eye, but Tony looked on serenely, uncharacteristically quiet. It was disconcerting to say the least. Steve raised an eyebrow, Tony shook his head millimetrically and that was that. “Very well,” he conceded. “I will deliver the speech.”
Tony:
Steve forced himself to move. He turned towards the man, an abrupt jerk of his entire body to the right. He plopped unattractively in what he was sure looked like a dying fish. “I’m sorry! It’s okay, you can always hug me.” He shut his eyes when Tony’s face started to look pitying.
Bucky blinked a couple of times. “Beats a spanking, to be honest. Hah, beats! Get it?”
He can’t see.
Steve moved off, shuffling backwards to sit on his heels. He helped Tony up, then hurried to get his mouth on the man’s cock. He could taste himself, lube, Tony. “Have I been good?”
“Uhm... Fingering’s nice,” he finally said noncommittally.
“Coulson made me promise. You wanna be the one to tell him you upset Steve?” she asked Clint.
They pushed into the most outrageous suppositions. Like whether he was a cyborg or whether he was immortal. Whether he was a vampire. Whether he had been built in a lab - this one was often paired with outrageous compliments which should have made it better, but ended up making him cringe constantly. Darcy kept saying it was a good thing, she forwarded him countless “good” articles. He was grateful, but he also kept blushing and hiding under his blankets, even if he was in the solitude of his bed.
Tony pulled him closer to kiss and lick at his chest. “Love how you feel. Perfect and mine.”
“Let me finish! But don’t you have somewhere to be?”
“Stop, I’ll throw you down and ravage you.”
“You seemed pretty undercover to me when you kissed Natasha in that mall,” he said casually.
“Maybe,” Steve replied in a small voice.
“And a couple of really niche hotlines –”
Darcy:
“I’m sorry, Colonel,” Steve replies instantly. “Get me close to that one,” he points at a large Doombot.
!” She turned to look at him and leaned over the table to kiss his forehead. Pietro joined her in wondering at the traditional Russian dish while Wanda mouthed her thanks.
Pepper thanked him for the leather journal, and Bruce thanked him for his new fountain pen. Steve decided again he loved giving presents because it was never about him. He accepted the hot chocolate with a nod, and settled to watch his family rejoice in their gifts.
“Thank you,” Steve muttered. “You’re amazing,” he told him once more. He’d probably spend the rest of his life telling Tony how he saw him now that he’d opened that door.
He watches Steve fall to his death as a Doombot explodes, bringing down half a building on the man Tony loves. He hears Steve’s scream over the comm, outside of the comm, in his very soul. And then the world stops spinning. Time stops moving forward. Tony wishes he could stop existing. But nothing is ever that easy. He vaguely registers Bucky’s panicked shout, and Natasha’s repeated calls for Steve over the comm. He hovers, watching as rubble and dust spread out from the site of the crash. There’s a sort of perverted contentedness lurking in the shallows of his mind, unmitigated proof that he is a failure, just like he’d heard from his father, from Obie, from the fucking journalist who’d accused him of facilitating death. He tries to reject the feeling, but it takes a hold of him nonetheless and his entire being is screaming of his complete and utter defeat.
.” There was an undertone of playful mockery that Steve did not appreciate at all. He licked his dick once, then blew gently on it. “Fuck! You’re mean,” Tony proclaimed.
“Not now, darling. First, okay,” he started. One more kiss dropped on Steve’s lips. He brought a wet tissue to Steve’s hole, wiping it gently. Then he wiped down the cum splattered on Steve’s chest. “Let me just…” He moved Steve’s legs until he had his feet planted on the floor. Next, he brought a bottle to Steve’s lips. “Drink up, baby, go on.” The hand supporting Steve’s head was gentle, the touch loving.
He knows laughing is the wrong thing to do, he also knows that Steve is probably joking despite his impatient tone. He can’t help the guwaffs. “What would you have me call him? Mister Storm? He’s what, 20?”
“Rude. What is what?” Natasha asked from behind the curtains.
“Please!”
That settled it, he figured. His relationship was far from a battle, but he was grateful she still had his back regardless. Their backs. It didn’t do any good dwelling on who Natasha would pick for a favourite. Besides, he was pretty confident it would be him. Maybe. Perhaps not so confident. Either way, the important thing was that he had vast support from his teammates and friends, Tony was absolutely wonderful, he was head over heels in love with the man, and he was slowly but steadily learning to manage his angst and anxiety.
“What?” he asked. “Remember Jacques bet me I couldn’t stick a bottle of beer down my throat? I won that one.”
She graciously admitted defeat. “Fair and square. Well, ignoring the super serum and the days you spend in the gym.” She disentangled the plastic tiara and placed it on Steve’s head. “I still get to set you up on a date cause it’s my birthday and you owe me for the thing in the place,” she told him.
His mind flew to Christmas Day. It was probably one of the symptoms of losing his mind, because he had no explanation of what came over him. He turned to the left and stepped into Tony’s personal space. Slowly, mindful of everything - from implications, to Tony’s potential disdain for physical contact -, he lifted his arms and brought them around the shorter man. Just as slowly he let himself step closer and simultaneously pull the scientist into the embrace. The sky was quiet now, Steve’s mind was calming down, and he was happy to notice they hadn’t stepped into a parallel universe after all.
“Why are you stil here, Stark?” he asked with a yawn.
“Your dad,” Steve deadpanned.
Steve facepalmed. “No, please, come in! Got any friends who want to step into this reunion?” he asked sarcastically.
Steve slid lower in his seat. He let go of his poor hard cock with a twinge of regret. “I almost said it’s show time, but I don’t think I can seriously be this corny.” He moved his legs over the arms of the chair, pushing his ass out to expose himself as prettily as he could. He pushed down his embarrassment once more, unable to stop the blush from spreading on both his cheeks and his chest.
“It would have invalidated the pool, she couldn’t do anything about it,” Vision explains.
The exchange had him shifting on the chair he didn’t remember sitting on. Acutely aware of the box in his backpack, he chose to focus on finishing up a report before the next step of the plan. It helped minimise the attention he paid to how minutes passed. He must have been at least a bit of a masochist, and really, Steve, you absolute idiot? That definitely
Steve tried really hard not to be embarrassed by the video. He was clearly visible in the back, gentle smile on his face and an expression he could only class as loving. His saving grace was that he occasionally looked at Natasha the same way, but it was more than clear his heart eyes were for Tony. Perhaps the man wouldn’t see it – he was often uninterested in watching things sent of their various group chats.
“Tired,” Tony said with a yawn. “You ready to go?”
“That building should have never been authorised,” the doctor explained in English. “Assholes, they knew it was a risk.”
He paused. He couldn’t remember where in the speech he had planned to deflect this farce and rejoin his personal efforts towards a better world. He shrugged to himself, deciding this was a good a time as any. He folded the papers and put them back in his pocket.
Tony paused, resting his cheek on Steve’s sternum. “What happened on Natasha’s birthday?”
“Tony, remember when we –"
Steve’s nerves were multilayered. Which yeah, given the magnitude of his anxiety issues, was kind of an amusing statement. So he’d seen little of Tony that week. The man had been gone for a couple of days, then Steve had training sessions, then they’d had more crap to deal with, and all they had the energy to do was make out like teens and fumble in the dark, heated whispers before they fell asleep spooning. It was cute, Steve surmised. But he also missed Tony’s touch and having his undivided attention.
“Everyone who has ever interacted with me in any way, shape, or form, Steve.” He turned to touch Steve’s shoulder. “Besides, people are starting to catch on that you’re not a saint. Soon you’ll slick your hair back and ride a motorcycle. Oh, wait.”
Steve’s hips seemed to have settled on presenting to Tony of their own accord, and he pulled his knees towards his chest, lust overtaking self-consciousness. Tony kept at his frantic licking, alternating broad strokes and sharp-tongue incursions.
Steve hid his face in his hands in what has half a double-facepalm, half a please-God-make-the-ground-open-up-and-swallow-me. He looked up when he heard laughing.
Steve still couldn’t move his head, and he couldn’t ask any of the questions that were bombarding his mind. The hand moved again, and this time he felt the fingers pat the outline of his dick. His breath hitched. The room dissolved and he was now sitting at a desk, his wrists free, wearing a shirt and a tie, looking towards faceless people who were saying things he didn’t understand.
“Clint,” she started walking towards the marksman, “I know this is on you. Come, we’re doing tequila.”
He’d planned for this, so when he shook Tony awake he ducked, careful not to spill coffee all over the bed.
They hugged two more times before Steve heard the door lock behind him. His heart was heavy with the feeling that he would never see her again. It was her age, and also a first hand experience of losing people he cared about. It was emphasised by his job, and the way some of his teammates were more vulnerable than others. And while the thought occurred to him before, it was just in light of this that he acknowledged that perhaps Tony was just as affected by these thoughts. Sure, Steve had benefitted from the serum, and he was hard to take down, but to someone who had lost people before, this was not a factor. For Tony, whose parents were dead, whose friends betrayed him, who lost civilians before, this was not a factor. Steve had put himself in danger, and yes he could survive a lot more than the average person, but he could also die, and at the end of the day that’s what stuck with Tony. Tony, who had such difficulty showing his positive emotions; who relied on sarcasm, quips, and insults; who may or may not have flirted with Steve as a joke; who felt was responsible for the entire world and then more.
“You’re beautiful,” Tony said simply. Then he further lowered himself on Steve’s hips and thighs, snaking up in a sinful manner that meant Steve could almost feel the pressure on his dick.
“You okay?”
“Who showed him ‘The Godfather’?!”
Tony opened his eyes to look at him, then smiled warmly. “Feeling better, Cap?”
When he finally opened his eyes, Tony had a peculiar look on his face, and Natasha sported a devious expression. Oh-oh.
Tony:
Drop me a line and let me know how you found it. Remember, if you don't have anything nice to say, make sure it's at least constructive. If it can't be constructive, shove it up your arse. Thanks for reading, much love xx
Tony made to escape, but Steve was quicker and pulled him by the shoulder towards the edge of the bed. “Would you look at that, you’re actually awake right now and you’re about to get up, sort yourself out and come face the crowd of corrupt dicks we’re about to scare into being less corrupt.”
As soon as he assessed the situation, he was back on his feet, pulling the tree off Human Torch and carrying him away. Wanda kept a shield up behind them, and Reed slithered to where Steve was hiding both of them from the remaining bots while Tony hatefully disposed of them.
“Yeah, thank you!” Peter seemed to realise what had been said. “Hey…”
Steve nodded and handed him the box. “I don’t know how I missed it, I’m sorry.”
“Promise? I love watching,” came the reply and Steve was about half a wrong breath away from smacking Tony’s hands with the carving fork.
“My teeth,” came the quick reply and Steve burst into laughter.
Steve gasped in mock-indignation. “Thoroughness!”
The new rumble of thunder makes the hair on the back of Tony’s neck stand up. He’s ready when lightning hits him, and he channels it into a beam of pure energy, tearing a hole in the horde of bots.
“I’ve been curious since you walked in.” Tony had lifted his t-shirt to rest his hand on his hip, the strip of skin so familiar to Steve, a favourite place to plant kisses and rest his temple. “You wanna be good and show me?” The tender underlayer in that suggestion-order made Steve’s head swim.
“Tony Stark, you’re a vision!”
Steve nodded and let him guide him back to the sofa. He sank in the comfy piece of furniture, the tension in his back muscles now a dull ache. He shifted a little, found the best comfortable position he could and sighed deeply. “Thanks,” he said with another yawn. It sounded perfunctory to his own ears. “Seriously, I really appreciate it. You’ve been so helpful and so nice.” He would have liked to go on, maybe more poetically, but he could feel his feet getting cold and that could only mean one thing. He braced himself as subtly as possible.
“I want to, Steve. I’ve been thinking about it for months, but I need to know this is okay. Is it, darling?”
“Uh, he got you there old man.”
Steve laughed and turned to Bruce. “You sure about this? Lots of people aren’t really your favourite thing.”
Steve sighed. He was being silly, he knew that, but the scenarios in which Tony laughed in his face were flooding his mind. He also knew it was unfair to Tony, the man would never do that. “Remember when we got together?”
“Pepper, I don’t -” Steve tried, but got interrupted again.
Tony’s head shot up. “No! Don’t be! Please. It’s okay, it’s not your fault. I told you to come to me when you need to and I’m glad you did.” He got up, pulled a chair from a nearby desk and sat down in it. He gently lifted Steve’s chin. “Wanna talk about it?”
He thinks perhaps he’s finally losing it when the edges of his vision become reddened, and he’s floating now so maybe he’s only dreaming – a terrible nightmare, cause now he’s out of his suit, unable to – but then chunks of the building start moving out of the way, parting like the Red Sea and Tony remembers religion vaguely, on withered fingertips touching his forehead, his chest, then his shoulders. The softness of the prayer made him mellow and he doubted, as he always did, but he cherished.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he said through clenched teeth.
The marksman shot at him with what Pepper had explained was a nerf gun, the foam dart hitting him in the leg. He grabbed a chair, swung it around in place to face him, and Steve’s stomach sank when he realised where that was going.
“I know, I know. You can punish me later if you want.” When Steve groaned into his chest, Tony laughed once more. “Like that thought?”
“Oh, Tish,” Tony whispered.
“What train?”
“No,” Steve warned.
“Relax, what’s a new fully-automatised – I’m fucking with you. I did build an oven, however.”
“Hey! I’m romantic! This one time I baked cookies and shit for this guy.” Another pause, where he seemed to realise what he’d said. “Anyway,” he tried, getting up.
“Not throwing a tantrum,” Steve said.
“No idea what you’re talking about,” Tony said, cheeky grin on.
“Yeah? It should be safe, I mean it’s mostly for metal but you’re pretty much indestructible and I’ve already inhaled so much of this shit, I’m probably an addict by now,” he laughed. Steve made to get up, eyes still firmly shut. “I’m joking! I invented it, it’s safe. I think.” And laughed some more.
The imagined assailant was a lady who looked positively ancient; the hand grasping his forearm was bony, but strong. The most striking thing about her appearance was her cloudy eyes, framed by white tendrils that escaped the harsh bun she had her hair in.
“Thank you,” Steve replied in a small voice. He sighed again. “I had a really bad nightmare,” he shrugged, trying to say it as casually as possible. Tony’s distorted body flashed before his eyes.
Clint was moving around still tender from his wounds. Judging by the sluggishness of his movements, the pain medication he was on was working beautifully. He opened and closed the freezer several times, increasingly more agitated. He went as far as to check the cupboards and the oven.
“Did I have fun? Steve, are you serious? I think I fell in love with you all over again so hard, there’s a universe where we don’t even know each other and other-universe-me woke up hard and in love.”
“He’s your best friend, Steve,” he repeated his earlier words. This time, his voice was gentle and patient. “Of course he wants to protect you. I mean if you were going out with someone else — with someone, I mean I would want to meet them and see that they’re okay and…”
Steve grinned. “Because I bought us anal beads?”
Steve turned to see the man wearing a fluffy bathrobe held together by a loose sash. His mouth watered as he watched him towel dry his hair. When Tony called his name, he had no idea what he’d been told. “What?”
“What is?”
“They are on duty because they have a job. This woman used to be my neighbour, she remembers me from the war, every now and then she makes me a pot roast, and she is alone. And she won’t trust a stranger. I’ll just be a bit late,” he finished, trying to work out how to fix his sleeves.
The photo op with the ghastly statue (Steve was adamant there was only one they moved around despite both Natasha and Tony telling him there were definitely more than one, Steve just accept it) was shorter than originally planned, Steve was sure. If anything, at least they didn’t have to pose for an hour in the scorching sun.
It was disconcerting, how much these people trusted and idolized them. But at the same time, Steve’s resolve to be the best person he could was reinforced. This was beyond the American Dream, the way people back home saw them, the way they were liked there. To the people of this country, they were a – and he hated to be thought of that way – beacon of hope for better times. All he could do was make them proud. So he smiled wider on his way to the car, stopped to sign a baseball and some merchandise, and promised he’d see them all later before getting in and being driven away.
Of course he’d flown before. He’d jumped out of several planes and such. He’d used a parachute, he’d even flown with Tony. But nothing he had ever experienced, not even being reborn with full-capacity lungs and an imposing frame felt like this. It was somehow better than he’d ever imagined, as close to freely flying to his heart’s desire as possible. To be in Tony’s arms, whose words rang in his ears, accompanied by the howling of the wind that came with their speed. To be protected but liberated at the same time. To be accepted and to have his wishes granted. To feel the strength of Tony’s arms, even as they were clad in metal - the suit an extension of the man, not a replacement.
“Kid, you may have screwed up,” Tony informed him.
Clint shrugged. “Some dickhead posted it on Twitter, trying to mock Steve. It backfired massively cause now it went viral with old fans and new fans. And with a lot of teenagers, but I’m not sure why.”
She held on with surprising strength. “If you are true, Steve Rogers. If you are true you will win. And the fire will go away and you will get your loved one.”
Justin downed his drink and wiped at the corner of his mouth with a practiced gesture. Steve’s urge to punch something was rapidly concentrating on a singular target. “It wasn’t easy, I’ll let you know. I had to rely on a date, can you imagine? In this day and age to have to rely on a date?” He looked around, eyes slightly unfocused. “Ah, there she is!”
“Focus, Stark, god damn it,” Bucky urges, running up to where they’re collectively keeping Wanda safe so she can contain the fire. Pietro joins them, creating small air voids that help put out the smaller flames.
To Steve’s endless frustration, Tony anchored his hips down with his hands. He cupped them under Steve’s heavy testicles, pushing them up. “Tony, please!”
Tony grinned. “What about the throat part?”
“We’re gonna have so much fun,” Tony said as he pulled his boxers down.
Steve was quiet, because he knew that it would take longer. And on top of that and his lack of sleep and general lack of desire to be there he had to add deeply unsettling feelings of entitlement. Because Steve was aware of how this looked. Three white people, each with various degrees of success to showcase in their respective resumes. Yes, each fucked in the head in ways, but ultimately three white Americans who looked like they were on a saviour complex mission to bring Freedom to some unfortunate souls. Steve had never wanted anything more than to not be seen as such. He kept quiet, because Natasha would probably be understanding but eventually cutthroat in her reasoning that this was advisable over a potential power vacuum, while Tony would be mocking and defensive due to his unfortunate coping mechanisms. And Steve was mature enough that he could agree he shared some of said coping mechanisms.
Steve blushed. He was so
“Steve, don’t. We can sit here all night with me getting drunker by the minute, and you staying as sober as always, and I could be listing a thousand and one reasons why it wouldn’t work. And honestly, I’d rather have a drink with a kindred spirit and then go to bed.”
“What? Oh, yeah,” the man laughed. “I figured they wouldn’t miss it much. It’s so ugly, isn’t it?”
“To which part?”
(Will I ever write short notes?)
Steve smiled. “You were?”
“I did manage to hide this crush from you for months.”
Tony paused. “Yes, that’s it. Why do you even remember that?”
“You want me to put this on you, don’t you?” When Steve stayed quiet as a challenge, Tony gripped a fraction tighter, looking up at him. “Answer me, Steve.”
, “but we can double-celebrate them and that’s that.” He’d taken an apple, dropped a kiss on top of Steve’s head (he hoped the warmth he felt whenever his boyfriend did that would never cease), and left then in favour of science.
“So you’re okay with using a real tree? Do you know the rate of deforestation in this country?” Tony asked him from the counter where he was perched, drinking what was definitely something with alcohol in it.
“I mean, if you did see them it would have to be from way below as you fell to your death,” Steve said with an eyeroll.
“Yeah, no shit. Truth or Dare?” Tony clicked his fingers to rush him.
He’d handed out coffee and painkillers to his hungover teammates, laughed at Darcy flopping down on the kitchen island and growling at anyone who tried to move her, tried not to get too jealous at the easy way Bruce’s hand patted her shoulder when he sat next to her, aggressively suppressed the shudder threatening to escape when Tony walked in, hair sticking out, pyjama pants riding low on his hips, and laughed at Natasha threatening Bucky to cut his other arm off if he didn’t stop singing. You know, the usual.
Tony was quiet for a long time. His other hand joined the effort and together they caressed Steve’s temples and cheekbones. “My mom did that too. When I woke up from nightmares, she would sit next to me on the bed and tell me stories and pat my head. I figured it would help.”
“It’s okay,” he rushed to reassure the man, even though he felt it was not okay and it wouldn’t be for a while. His mind had been busy with the danger, but now it had passed, so Steve was back to hardcore overthinking.
“Mhm. Okay, we uhm.” He pulled Steve’s forehead to his own. “Captain Rogers, given recent developments, would you like to alter your plans and spend your birthday making out with me and maybe let me give you a filthy birthday present — OH!” Steve opened his mouth to answer, but Tony had already pulled out of his arms and grabbed the newspaper from the table. “Where is it? Okay, look!”
Tony seemed to be aware of it, so he focused on showing Steve affection in silence. Eventually, amidst the slow kissing and soft touches, he spoke again. “I broke the glass I was holding when I saw you kissing that woman,” he admitted quietly.
before I think you vanilla.”
“More like she adopted me,” Tony replies with a laugh.
“I thought —“
“Oh, no,” Steve said, as sarcastically as he could, and walked back to his room.
“Yeah, just a bit tired. I’ll be back to belting out Rudolph’s name in a minute.”
Steve nodded at Natasha and turned around, still rocking the goat. He took a step closer to Tony to shield him from view. “I’m sorry I’m in your face, I’m trying to minimise the coverage they get of you,” he said quietly.
Tony jumped up and pulled the cover off Steve completely. “I can’t promise anything, but you won’t know until you try!”
There was nothing else to do but follow. He tensed, then the relief washed over him as he came. He kissed Tony back fiercely, with everything he had. This was aftercare and love and togetherness. He belonged now just as much as he did when Tony had put the belt around his cock. Here, in the man’s arms, cum dripping slowly on his belly.
Tony’s eyes shone prettily in the bluish light. He kissed Steve deeply, grinding into him sharply once. “Later, please?”
“PSA stands for —“
Tony was alive. Alive and beautiful and holding a goat and Steve just
“Okay,” Steve said seriously. “Are you just as dedicated to kissing me?”
Politicians were slimy and disgusting everywhere, Steve knew this first hand, but there was something special about the rows and rows of corrupt members of Parliament, of state secretaries, ministers, just waiting for their turn to greet them. Some had ugly grins on, some sneered openly. There was great social unrest, and in light of the recent development under a government that wasn’t
“What’s VHS?”
He took to doing that in a South-facing room with large windows where they had added plants over the years. Steve sat in the sun and took whatever sleep he could there. Natasha asked if she could join him sometimes and he readily agreed, feeling safe with her next to him. They sat in companionable silence; Steve would watch her knit, mesmerised by the way her fingers moved, deadly effective. He knew those same hands were capable of soothing. He would fall asleep like that, warm and free and safe, and when his sleep stayed dreamless, he had a brief window of time when he was well-rested.
Steve looked up instinctively. Tony was looking straight at him, head cocked to the side, the sparkle in his eyes curious but not knowing. Steve felt a heatwave engulf him, toes to forehead, to extremities, and he had to cough just to have something to do, anything.
“No! It’s great, I don’t wanna stretch it and ruin it,” he said, kind of regretting the size of his frame.
“Wow, you have agents in my crew?”
Steve tried to help the chuckle that escaped him. He did, but then he turned the water off and heard Bennu bleat as Tony kept asking inane questions. “Fuck off, Tony.”
He knows darkness. He knows pain and worry. He knows helplessness and he knows regret. He knows shortness of breath. By his parents’ coffins. In the cave in Afghanistan. On the floor where he woke up half naked in a puddle of his own vomit. When Obie pulled his arc reactor out and he felt his heart ache like it never had before.
Bucky:
“Or!” he started, “or, I could come sleep in your bed.”
“Stop agreeing with everything I’m saying, Steve. It’s a low tactic.”
Even though he had a key, he chose to knock. Mrs Williams opened the door entirely too trustful for Steve’s liking. He couldn’t help his smile, however, when her entire face lit up once her assumption was confirmed.
Whenever he got in his head like this — not necessarily in a destructive manner, just… in his head is how he’d described it to Minnie The Therapist — he’d bring up the counter arguments too. It was a fairly new experience, to balance the bad out with good things as well. He was trying, okay?
Maybe Steve was really a teenager, like a very late side effect of the serum. Or maybe it was a being-attracted-to-Tony side effect. Maybe Steve was just dumb as all hell and he couldn’t manage his dumb emotions and his dumb expectations and maybe Steve was just dumb. That could have been it. He took a long hot shower, scalding his skin slightly and feeling it heal, and scalding it again, and feeling it heal. He didn’t know how long he was in there for, and when he emerged he was annoyed that it hadn’t worked. He had half a mind to walk down to the lab and shove Tony into a wall and strangle him, but also kiss him, and was Tony into that?
“Come on, Stark. It’s gonna be like that time we were stranded in Atlantic City. I remember you taking off your shirt and well, are we still banned there?”
“In medical, they broke his kneecap. I had to keep his bones together with magic all the way back.”
“Right.”
Natasha stepped in then, because Natasha was like a soothing breeze in the hot sun and started talking to the young woman. Soon they were hugging and she waved at Steve over his teammate’s shoulder. If he was still a boy, he would be sent to his room without food for such a cock-up, not smiled at and treated kindly. Slowly they moved towards their ride. When the officials exited the people booed them away, and despite everything, it was a more than a bit satisfying.
“Code green?” she asked with a small smile.
In his opinion, the only good thing to come out of it was that as stilted and unprofessional as his words were, they somehow empowered people to speak out against injustices. Investigative journalism took off once there was foreign involvement from NGOs and independent observers who had travelled to ensure the safety of anti-corruption movements.
“Doombots,” Steve deadpans. “I thought Clint was Legolas?”
“There is a cat in every corner of a room -”
“Fuck it, I’ll do it in the morning.”
Despite his muscles working at it, it wasn’t even remotely a struggle, but the entire thing seemed out of this world. Tony’s expression was unreadable. Steve’s traitorous mind, hopeful despite his best intentions, interpreted it as reverence, perhaps awe, perhaps a tiny bit of fondness. He could see Natasha taking photos, the loudness of the shouted Russian filled the room, but despite everything, seeing Tony above him, moving up and down at Steve’s pace brought to mind filthy things. Filthy, dirty porn he’d watched in the middle of the night, trying to familiarise himself with the current culture. Porn with dark haired men on top, bouncing slowly on a bare dick.
Tony lands next to his boyfriend, kicking a crawling bot away from them. “You don’t actually believe that, right?”
Steve moaned as the man pushed him down on the sofa. He went easily, distracted by the tongue currently flicking his left nipple. His hands flew up to gently fist in Tony’s hair. “I guess we’re even, I’ve been obsessing over that mouth of yours since Natasha’s birthday,” he managed to say through the panting.
“Yes, but do I randomly spin at high speed for no fucking reason?” he countered and Nat laughed even more.
“Oh, Steve. I’m only on J. We’ve got a long way to go,” she informed him.
man? He read about that new slang word on the internet, and he wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he felt cool using it, even if it was just in his thoughts.
“Thank you. Thank you,” Steve repeated.
The lobby was busy and he was painfully aware of everyone staring at him. His tie was slightly too tight, and while it would normally bother him, right now it kept him focused. He welcomed the change over the buzzing of the same thoughts over and over again. To further focus on something else, he arranged the car for the drive to the whatever gathering they were to attend – Steve ignored that part of the conversation with surprising ease. In hindsight, it wasn’t typical of him to not know parameters to a mission, regardless of its nature, but this entire thing was different than their usual work.
Bruce snorted. “Never happened before. I don’t laugh much.”
“How many do you know?” Steve joked.
“Yeah, got patched up downstairs,” he said and walked in to plop on Steve’s bed. “Fuck it, I’m too tired.” He reached over and pulled the duvet off Steve, swiftly making a cocoon out of it. He arranged the blanket around his head and sighed happily in his new nest. “Thanks Steve, you’re the best.”
“How else?” He bent his head to kiss the droplets of water off the man’s neck.
“What?”
Natasha was running behind him, barking orders in Russian. The closer he got, the worse the heat got. He swerved in time to avoid running into a couple of sheep. The petting zoo, Steve realised, was close to where the fire was. It smelled like burnt hay and melting plastic and his heart was pounding in his chest, trying to locate Tony in the mayhem. He paused to help a couple of young people evacuate some chicken, Natasha taking over so he could approach the affected area.
“What car?”
“There we go. Move your hands behind your back. Grab your elbows, push your chest out for me.” He bent to kiss Steve’s forehead, then presented him with the leash’s leather handle. “Open and – good. Now bite.” The leash was long enough that it was just about comfortably taut on Steve’s chest. “Lean your head back until – yeah, isn’t that better?” Steve moaned in response. I’ll be right back, okay? Two minutes. Don’t swallow, don’t let go of the handle, don’t loosen the pull on your cock.”
Tony hugged him then. Kind and gently, like a flutter of a hug. For someone who was usually so blunt, Tony was acting with the utmost of care. Steve’s body was treacherous and decided human contact was grounds for tensing suddenly. Tony started to pull back. “Oh, Steve! I’m sorry, I didn’t know what else to do.”
“I’m gonna go back to -”
“Not a fan of Christmas,” Tony said quickly and then continued to talk about some experiment of his, effectively dismissing the entire Christmas conversation.
Unfortunately, he was not wrong. Steve would have chosen a different word, but all in all, that was the closest term for the chaos that was outside. The mass of people was downright erratic, waving flags and to Steve’s utter horror, children. Fair enough, there were only a few and they seemed to be quite secure, but the sentiment baffled him. Tony waved, large smile on his face, sunglasses up to hide the dark circles and potential disdain. Natasha smiled at the little girls wearing red wigs, and he followed their cue, waving and smiling at the kids who wore homemade cardboard masks with his face dressed as Captain America.
