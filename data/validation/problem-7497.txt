Tony had been grappling over his heated exchange with Obadiah for hours. He couldn’t bring himself to talk to Steve about it, especially since that night was supposed to be about the team. But Tony could tell that Steve had sensed there was something bothering him, yet he attempted to divert attention from himself at every opportunity, trying to convince himself that Obadiah was wrong about him and Steve.
Tony sighed again as he looked directly at Steve. “Please get him out of here.” His voice rose in earnest, but that didn’t stop Steve from gently grabbing Thor by the arm to lead him out of the room, followed by Bruce who attempted to calm Thor down as much as possible. Tony waited for the door to close before inching into Loki’s personal space.
Steve handed Tony his phone back before heading toward the kitchen. He moved a few things around before he found the charger. He turned around and smiled.
Obadiah crossed his arms as he watched Loki reach the door to exit the office. “Anthony should be in Dr. Banner’s lab and Mr. Rogers is out to lunch…”
Tony laughed quietly before answering. “…okay, yes. I agree with you…” He shrugged with another laugh before pulling Steve back on top of him, “…I’m your boyfriend, Rogers.” He teased, but managed to convey his sincerity.
“Fortunately, my dearest Jane managed to find me. I don’t know where I would be without her. She had our compass!” Thor gave Steve the heartiest laugh from his otherwise banal story. He then slapped Steve on the shoulder.
“Hey, Tony. Are you okay?” Tony’s eyes widened as Steve’s voice materialized.
Steve kiss Tony deeply before propping himself up to look down at him. “Tony…we need to talk…”
“I suppose there’s some truth to that statement.” Tony grinned down at Steve.
“The device is generating the detonator!” Tony shouted as he and the rest of the group ran up to the helicopter; its propellers already whirling, “we need to get off this island now!”
“Earlier in the week we have the simulation presentation for the board, so please be ready for that.” Tony commanded to everyone else.
Steve had been debating with himself the entire ride from his law office to Stark Enterprises over how he should deal with Tony and Synergy.
It also wasn’t lost on Tony that that night with Steve had been the first in long while he had finally slept all the way through the night. The reminder made Tony feel even more sick with grief.
After a moment or two, Tony pulled away from Steve. “But, I kind of wish you said something before we came out here…maybe we could try when we get back into town.” He offered, but he was smiling to indicate that he wasn’t upset with Steve mentioning the idea.
“Steve! Are you awake? If you are, I’ve got breakfast!”
“Goodnight, Tony.” Steve whispered as he tried to hug Tony from behind.
.” He grinned back down at Steve, rocking his hips forward.
Tony waved for Steve to catch up. “Come on, Rogers! Let’s move!”
Steve also enjoyed spending time with Sharon, but they hadn’t gotten to that point in their relationship where Steve could see a future commitment. Sure, they always had a nice time whenever they met up and Sharon was easy to talk to, but Steve didn’t feel the same way around her the way he had with Tony, although Steve had been lying to himself that he would eventually get there.
A few minutes passed before a black car drove onto the harbor before driving toward the landing strip. Steve shielded his eyes from the sun’s glare, squinting to see a figure emerging from the car once it came to a full stop. As soon as he recognized that the figure was Tony, Steve smiled and waved, watching Tony talk to Happy who was in the driver’s seat before walking toward Steve. Steve could see that Tony was smiling back at him as he approached the plane.
“I…have…
Tony clapped his hands together. “That sounds great! Better coming from you than Fury or me, trust me. Because, you know, you got that ‘face’.” He joked.
He takes out the memory of Steve in his bed, one more time, two more times. The zipped files are safer from deletion. They'll last longer, but in the end, they'll all go. He puts it back to save it a little longer. He flies to Russia.
Tony's gaze followed Steve's gesture, and then, after a few seconds, he was grinning, wide and amused. He started to laugh. "Oh my God. That was why you handed me a gay book, wasn't it? I thought you were doing it for me, but
Iron Man tips his head against Steve's shoulder, and Steve wraps an arm around him and holds him tight. Iron Man can't feel him through the armor. He knows that. But in some ways, the armor is an asset -- he can hold Iron Man as tightly as he likes, with all the feeling in him, and he doesn't have to worry that he'll hurt Iron Man with his strength, because he knows he can't. Not like this.
Since the serum, Steve's hearing has been superhuman. And right now, it's even better than it usually is. There's a cacophony of voices. Tony has a lot of visitors. Carol. Thor. Scott. Tony's brother. He can't quite tell what they're saying. They're all talking at the same time. It's noisy.
Steve can't help but think about Iron Man's mysterious secrets, the things that both Mr. Stark and Iron Man have said should put him off Iron Man for good.
At least Tony knew how to play that up for him. He slapped the flogger lightly against his palm, feeling the weight and sting of the falls, watching Steve's eyes track every motion, hungrily.
think of him," she countered. "Do you trust him as you trust Iron Man? And if so, on what basis?"
"Tony!" Steve yelled, and there was real panic in his voice.
He sketched a few arrows, fliers moving ahead in a formation on a stylized map of a battlefield, and he sighed. He missed art. God knew he didn't have the free time for it anymore, as chair, but maybe it would be nice to get back to, someday. Tony had given him the tablet for his birthday last year and he'd probably thought Steve would have wanted to use it for actual art. Steve just hadn't gotten around to that, and this way it was a lot easier to send diagrams to the Avengers mailing list. Tony had looked happy that he was using the tablet for something, at least.
Steve reached back and grabbed his shield. He didn't think Tiberius was going to try anything, but he sure wasn't about to give him the opportunity. "Ready."
Steve smiles and closes his eyes again. He could get used to this.
He imagined giving his own cock a few good strokes, coming on Steve's ass, marking up Steve's bruises even more with his own come, rubbing it in and making Steve cry more with the pain of just a touch. God, that was a nice thought. Maybe next time.
Steve did this to him. Steve made him feel this happy. He thinks he never really understood the phrase
"You're his friend," Steve repeated. "So why in God's name are you doing this to him?"
Maybe he was just jealous.
"That's gorgeous," Tony said, admiring. "When I'm done with your ass I'm going to have to roll you over and slap you properly."
"Ty was there for me," Tony spat out. "He invited me over to his place so I-- so I didn't have to be alone. He helped me. He cares about me. He
"You feel so nice." Steve found that his voice was hushed, like this was something sacred. Maybe it was.
Steve turns back. Mr. Stark's leaning on the doorframe. His eyes are sad.
"Boy, am I ever glad that actually worked," Tony says. His voice is still raspy, but he sounds right. He sounds like his ordinary self. He sounds relieved. Of course he does. "Would have been more than a little awkward if it hadn't, right?" The laugh sounds a little forced, but it's the best sound Steve's ever heard. "I've had that particular countermeasure hooked up for a while, but obviously I've never gotten the chance to test it in real-world conditions. All the terminals in the building that can access classified data are wired up like that, because I figured Ghost wasn't ever going to stop breaking in."
Then Tony's gaze travels very conspicuously down Steve's body, over the disheveled remains of his -- probably designer, Tony bought it for him -- suit, down to the bulge at his groin, because Steve is, of course, once again visibly very hard, and he's a little less patient about it than Tony is. He doesn't like to wait for it, which he always feels a little bad about, but he doesn't feel all that bad, because Tony never, ever minds indulging him.
There was a horrible noise, metal screeching on metal, and then the deckplates below Steve  heaved, threw him into the air, and slammed him into the far bulkhead.
"Yeah," Steve agreed. He was pinned where he sat, nothing in him but desire. Tony was taking him apart, slowly, the way he'd study a machine; not to break him, but to understand how he fit together, to put him back together even better than he'd been. "Exactly. Just like that."
It's an easy explanation, at first -- the iceberg, the Avengers, joining the team. He explains the RT, since obviously Steve wants to know what the big glowy circle in Tony's chest is, even if he's too well-mannered to ask outright. Explaining how they found Bucky is a little more complicated, and Steve's face is more and more distressed, even as Tony assures him that Bucky is fine now. He's about to tell Steve he'll try to get in touch with the guy for him, when Steve interrupts the explanation and entirely derails it.
It was noon now, and as far as Steve was concerned, it was a perfectly good time for Sunday brunch. The reservation was an hour from now. Steve had automatic access to Tony's penthouse in Stark Tower -- he was pretty sure he had automatic access to everywhere Tony had ever lived -- and Tony never minded if he came by without calling first, so mostly he'd stopped calling first. Instead he dropped in, hauled Tony away from his armor or his paperwork, and got some food in him. And Tony had always, always been happy to see him. There was no reason that today was going to be any different.
Iron Man raises his free hand to try to stop him. The gauntlet is dented and scraped, the repulsor still dim.
Steve sat down on the edge of the bed, turning to face Tony. "It's okay," he said. "You're scared and you're tired. I understand. I just was under the impression that you didn't want anyone looking. And I don't want to do something you don't want me to do." That was worth spelling out, the way the rest of the night's conversation had gone.
"It's three in the morning," Steve pointed out. "Bars are closed. Liquor stores are closed. And there's no alcohol in the house. And if you're planning on visiting me again -- which you are welcome to do -- I'm happy to keep making sure there's none in the house. And I'm definitely happy to not drink in your presence, or if I'm going to be in your presence. Or ever, if that's what you need from me."
The noise Iron Man makes sounds sort of like a splutter, and then he looks away.
She looks at Tony once more, then back to Steve. She looks confused. Steve doesn't blame her. "IT, Captain. Data storage for special projects. Restricted access."
Jan shifted her weight. "Well, not
He glanced around the room with a critical eye. There were still a lot of his things here -- he'd have to make multiple trips -- but he didn't know how soon someone else might want the room, so it would probably be better to remove as many personal touches as he could. He still couldn't bring himself to pack the photographs of him with Tony. He could put them in a box. In the closet, maybe.
Steve had always thought the robot was beautiful too. It's not like his feelings for Iron Man came out of nowhere, after all. But he's also pretty sure that his level of aesthetic appreciation for Iron Man's armor is not proper conversational territory for a first date, unless the future has changed a lot.
But Tony just shrugged. "I didn't say I wasn't scared," he said, in a voice that had clearly been precisely calculated to sound nonchalant when he had to be anything but. "I am. But I think, in the end, it'll be okay. My name has been dragged through the mud so many times, over the years. No thanks to you." He tilted his head up. He was defiant. He was-- he was
"Well, yeah," Steve says, confused. "Of course I'm glad. If he hadn't told me, I would have tried to take his armor off, and, well--"
"All set?" Jan asked.
"Oh!" Iron Man blurts out. His filtered voice is laden with surprise. "Uh. Hi."
“Ready, when you are, Tony.” Steve fingers hovered over the device as he waited for data.
Tony chuckled to himself. Of course, he wasn’t going to send such a direct non sequitur that basically constituted sexual harassment. Although, now he couldn’t stop thinking about how hot Steve was.
Bruce nodded. The two then fell into absolute working silence for a moment or so before Bruce broke it.
“Awesome!” Peter high fived Tony before running over to the robot to tinker some more with its wiring.
Steve sighed as he looked downward before looking up at Tony. “I do care about yours and the team’s safety. But I think the Synergy device plays into that. It can do more good than harm. Much more. That’s the reason why I signed up for this in the first place.”
Tony felt that weird sob in his throat as he watched Steve walk toward him. He felt like running away; the feeling between them made him feel too exposed and he could feel the dull sensation in his chest again.
The comment made Steve laugh heartily, which then made Tony smile uncontrollably from making Steve laugh.
The team busied themselves like clockwork around the arena.
Peter nodded quickly before jumping out of car. “I hope he stays forever!” He shouted as he dashed to the elevator.
Obadiah grinned as if he were having an in-person conversation, but then his expression changed.
Tony grinned a little. “I asked him for dinner, not sure if it’s really a date, but it’s a start.”
“Let’s be honest…you and I both know this is probably
“That’s you.” Tony pointed to one of the figures, “I think he said something about Captain America. Something super patriotic, of course. Totally fits, doesn’t it?”
Tony moaned loudly as Steve held onto his body, pushing hard inside of him, moaning with every single push.
“Right. No secrets.” He glared at Tony before stuffing the croissant into his mouth.
Tony could tell that Steve was waiting for him to continue, but he felt paralyzed. He knew he needed to be honest with Steve about everything which was becoming easier the more time they spent together, but he couldn’t bring himself to really discuss all of his issues associated with his dad. The memories were still too painful to bear.
“We’ve been on a few dates.”
“Sir, it’s a quarter to six.” J.A.R.V.I.S. reminded Tony of the time. It was getting close to when Peter’s aunt would be dropping off the nine-year-old.
Steve was able to keep up the ruse the rest of the night before leaving earlier than he had planned to with Sam in tow. He wished a good night to everyone, except Tony; he was too mortified to even face him.
“…well,” Steve looked away from Tony before facing him again, “you’re my employer, Tony…of course it’s different…” And to Steve it was different; he had been embarrassed that people thought he was capable of something that was completely antithetical to his character. It had nothing to do with Tony, but he wasn’t sure how to articulate that.
?” He then used both hands to gesture toward himself.
Later that evening, the three of them cleaned up the kitchen together. Peter had begged Tony to play music while they cleaned which delayed cleaning by quite a bit as they danced and sang to one of Tony’s frequently played playlist. Peter had found Robyn’s “Get Myself Together” the most enjoyable, nearly breaking a dish as he tried to pass it to Steve who washed with Tony drying.
“Destroy it.” Tony firmly responded before Bruce could get a whole sentence in. Both Bruce and Shuri expressed their confusion at one another.
Peter dodged Tony. “I did last week!”
“No powers?”
The conference room rumbled as everyone’s attention was captured by Thor barreling into the space, dragging Loki behind him with Steve following behind. Loki, still tied up in the jumper cables, was trying to wiggle away from Thor. Natasha and Bruce lunged toward Thor to get him to let go of Loki: Bruce held onto Thor as Natasha grabbed Loki before throwing him in the nearest chair.
Tony sighed after he accessed the elevator to the penthouse. "Obie's a fucking douche, that's what's going on."
Steve only answered with a pleased-sounding noise as he viciously attacked Tony’s lips. Steve backed Tony up against the elevator, his hands wandering everywhere along Tony’s body. Tony couldn’t think clearly; not only was he drunk, but he was also enraptured with how nice Steve’s lips felt against his own.
Tony chuckled as he looked at Steve who just shrugged. He looked back at Peter, crossing his arms, pretending to be seriously mulling over the idea.
“Hey!” He ran out of the elevator to chase Bruce through the lobby.
Steve sunk further down into the bed as he heard Sam continue to call for him.
Tony scrunched up his face, still skeptical about the message. “J.A.R.V.I.S., read me the contents of the message, please.”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., show me the specs to the Synergy device, please.” Tony called.
Tony rolled his eyes as he groaned. “Ty, I really don’t need this right now…”
“Sounds like a plan.” He answered with a flashy PR grin.
“Tony,” Tiberius inched closer toward him as he lowered his voice, “I really do wish I could hear from you more often…”
Suddenly, Peter broke out into a sprint toward his bedroom, nearly knocking into Steve. Steve watched him scurry away before looking over at Tony.
“Thanks…” Tony responded with a timid smile as he accepted his plate from Steve.
Tony nearly groaned out loud.
Tony nodded with a sigh. “Doesn’t sound like I have a choice either way.”
Not only had Steve been exposed to his hotheadedness early in their working relationship, his lab mate was also aware of his personal struggles. Who knows what’s going on through Steve’s head now?
Thor sighed as he hung his head. “I thought I could reason with you before speaking with Fury…you doctored security tapes once, so I know you were capable of doing it again…”
Tony scrunched up his face. He wasn’t sure where the conversation was headed.
Tony wedged himself into Steve’s personal space. “Egg shells? You’re the one playing games, Rogers.”
Suddenly, Tony leaned sideways across Steve to grab a tablet from another nearby console, but in doing so, he brushed slightly against Steve’s hand. Steve didn’t physically react, of course, but the act felt more intimate than an accident. Or maybe he was reading into it too much.
Tony didn’t feel comfortable sleeping in his old room or his parents’ room, so he and Steve decided to spend the night in one of the guest rooms attached to the dining room through a small hallway on the opposite side of the kitchen.
“Nice job today, Steve.” Rhodey greeted Steve with a handshake, “you’re becoming a natural at this.”
Steve leaned back into his chair. It hurt thinking about Tony not being able to trust him, but he did think they had been good together up until that point. He could call, but would Tony even pick up the phone? Steve figured he should give himself some time to figure out the best way to approach Tony without their conversation escalating.
Loki made a gurgling noise as he tried to grasp at his collar to get Thor to let him go. But before he could answer him, one of the people sitting on the couch next to him jumped up and punched Thor in the face. Thor dropped Loki who crumpled to the floor underneath his brother and his friend. Steve ran over to try to grab the man who had punched Thor, but as he approached the brawl, a woman stuck out her leg to trip him and Steve went flying into one of the couches.
Tony could feel his frustration with the entire situation irrationally over taking his composure and he immediately took it out on Steve.
“I’m going to, uh…” Tony wiped his face as he braced himself with both hands against the console wreckage, “…spend some more time down here looking through this shit. I’ll see you later, okay?”
“…I thought maybe I could read to you for a bit before I need to pick up Peter…” Tony pulled out a couple books from the bag, spreading them out on the bed as if Steve could see them.
Steve waited, sensing that Tony had more on his mind.
“Uh, nothing…I’m just…tired…” He half admitted to himself and Steve.
“Okay, let’s get this data recorded so we can get out of here early, shall we?” Tony stayed put at his console while Steve did the same.
Can’t sleep. Can’t stop thinking about you.
Steve kissed Tony back as he let his hands travel up and down Tony’s backside. The movement of his hands caused Tony to moan quietly through the kiss, pushing his body more against his.
Tony grabbed Loki by the collar. “What the fuck is he trying to do?!” He exclaimed almost choking Loki. Natasha patted him on the arm a few times before gently pulling him off Loki.
Tiberius’s eyes widened with curiosity. “Well then…what if,” he wedged himself into Tony’s personal space, “the three of us went to that chalet out in the Alps? You remember the last time—"
“Leaking secrets? Mr. Rogers, I’m sorry to disappoint you, but this isn’t a spy thriller.”
cooler. In a different way, I suppose.”
“Rogers, let me get you a drink.” Tony offered before waving back at Thor and Loki.
“I didn’t think I would get to see you today.” Steve responded, still smiling although now his expression was reserved.
Thanos laughed to himself. “In the beginning, the point was to prove that Synergy was unstable, too unstable to justify your company, Mr. Stark, following through with a government contract. This allowed Mr. Stane to convince your board of such, thus delivering the device to me once the program was shut down,” he paused, “it
As Tony spoke, he accidentally locked eyes with Steve who was standing close to the stage. He looked like he was enjoying himself, sipping out of a glass as Tony gave his presentation. Something about seeing Steve’s face in an otherwise dimly lit crowd almost made Tony forget his lines.
Tony rolled his eyes dramatically. “Nothing,” he placed a hand on Steve’s arm before turning around to face the team who had been talking among themselves during the exchange.
Tony placed his hands on Steve’s face to look at him directly. “Steve,” he smiled as he finally found the courage to say what he had been wanting to say for the longest time, “I should have said this to you a long time ago, but I l—”
“Who else is involved?” Tony asked, fuming. He was expecting Loki to also give up Obadiah.
“Jesus, Sam. Let me buy you a drink.” Bucky looped an arm around Sam’s shoulder as he pulled him over to the counter.
Tony then motioned for Steve to follow him to the other side of the balcony where they could look at the cityscape. Steve looked down and out: New York looked so different from this vantage point; he had never seen the Chrysler Building this close and it looked breathtaking. He decided that the city would never look more beautiful than it did that night.
“Hey!” Bucky struggled against Steve, “what’s going on, dude?”
“Sir.” Agent Hill appeared suddenly in the room, “you need to see this.” She vaguely explained, yet sternly without acknowledging Loki who was struggling in his chair.
“Um, tell me if this is too forward…I’m not really asking for anything suggestive I promise…” Tony began.
They stared awkwardly at each other before Steve coughed uncomfortably. “We’re planning to visit him in the hospital later if you would like to join us?” He offered.
Tony nodded again as he pointed back toward the bedroom. “Okay, I’ll just close down what I’m doing and get ready.”
“Hammer.” Tony only offered as he settled into his chair.
T’Challa laughed heartily as he patted Sam on the back. “Not to worry, dear brother. You’re family!”
Fury nodded. “We found some chemical traces, but it appears that Thanos knew we were on to him.”
“Can I take this off now?” Steve smiled nervously.
Both Tony and Steve glanced at one another as Tony stepped toward the table, waiting for Thanos who appeared to be ruminating in his next thought, but remained silent.
invite him over. But he also seemed to be unwilling to talk about what had happened after Thor’s party. He also nearly lost his shit the morning after. Was he playing a game? Tony would be shocked—shocked!—to find out that Steve Rogers, Mr. Traditional, would be playing mind games with him. There was no way.
Steve interrupted Tony with a kiss. “I definitely want to. I miss you, Tony.”
Tony wagged a finger at Steve. “Don’t forget the 'old' bit. You squeezed that part in nicely.” He then jumped off and away from the bed.
Tony waited with anticipation, hoping Steve would just let the situation be. After a moment, he felt Steve nod his head against his neck before kissing his skin.
Steve smiled. “No, yeah. I’m looking forward to it.”
While weary of diagnosing Tony, Steve figured that maybe his friend was suffering from some form of post-traumatic stress disorder himself. There was a person in his group sessions who often mentioned their relationship with their mother as the source of their struggles with mental health and Tony’s mannerisms were similar to theirs. Steve reminded himself of how horrible and alone he had felt after his mother died, and the amount of help he received to overcome it.
“Would, um…” All that practice in the mirror that morning and Tony just ended up forgetting how to speak normally. He glanced upward at Steve and shuffled around a bit.
“I’m sorry, Tony…”
Steve nodded again as Tony kissed him. He eased as he kissed Tony back, repositioning them back onto the bed.
Steve swallowed as he shook his head. “Uh, n-no.”
“Tony…” Steve repeated, his voice wavering.
Tony had been berating himself every day for breaking up with Steve because he was terrified of ruining their relationship. But something about seeing Steve again gave Tony some much-needed confidence. He decided that he would go the friend route, much like he had the first time he got to know Steve until Steve became more comfortable with him again. Then Tony planned to ask Steve if they could start over and take things slow. Tony even managed to convince himself that he needed to be honest with Steve and finally tell him that he also loved him but was just too afraid to admit it when Steve confessed his feelings.
“Hey, Tone.” Rhodey greeted Tony with a hug before sitting back down in his chair.
He danced with Bucky and Sam for a bit as everyone else danced around them, dancing to a few more songs before everyone took their time walking back to their tables. As he walked toward his reserved table, Steve had noticed that Tony was no longer sitting at his table.
But before Tony could punctuate the end of his sentence, the crowd began wildly scurrying toward the exits, completely ignoring Tony’s previous call for a calm exit. Some people started shouting about getting to the tram before it left. Several people shoved each other out of the way, knocking all the displays down in their path. A few of the attendees jumped over and under tables, and at one point there was a toddler, standing next to a knocked-over display, crying from all of the commotion.
“You would be lost without me, Tone.” Rhodey smirked as he tossed Steve’s file onto Tony’s desk. The force of the toss propelled the file into Tony’s lap who laughed as soon as it hit his stomach.
Steve slid a hand along Tony’s chest to pull him in for a kiss. “We should probably get back to work.”
Tony groaned as he crouched downward to look for his phone. He stood up to sit back on the edge of the bed, tapping on his phone a few times.
“Are you policing my everyday actions now, Rogers?”
“…we had always been close, but there was a brief time in my life, when Bucky and I were in college, that I thought our relationship was something more since we’re so close…” Steve shrugged.
Tony chuckled as he slid a hand around Steve’s waist. Steve blushed as he tried to look away from Tony.
“Hey, Cap.” Sam greeted as he soon as he spotted Steve round the opening of the kitchen.
Clint chuckled, but then stopped, groaning in pain. “He’s
Tony was standing with Rhodey, Pepper, and some board members. He could see Steve on the other side of the lounge speaking with Fury, Natasha, and some other people.
He smiled again as he hugged Tony back. “Should…should I clean this up?” He asked meekly.
Although Steve’s face flushed even more from the offer, he could feel a tingly sensation in his body as he mulled over the idea. Sex with Tony was great, but the thought of having more than one orgasm right after the other with Tony was something he couldn’t possibly pass up. Also, Steve knew that Tony would take his time with him like he usually did and would stop if there were any sign that he was uncomfortable.
“You know, the nice thing about this device is that it’s durable, but lightweight.” Tony quickly changed the subject as Bruce sank even lower in his chair.
He then spun around to get back to the bedroom without hearing a response from Steve. Tony quickly saved what he was working on before finding something to wear. He could hear Steve’s voice draw nearer to the bedroom, telling him about their dinner plans, but Steve stayed out of the bedroom.
“Would it be okay then if Steve stays over some of the time during the week?” He asked.
Maybe. 😉 I’m going to try to get a few hours of sleep. I’ll see you tomorrow.
Steve nodded as he stopped a few feet in front of Tony. “…all of that time and effort needs to be put to good use somehow. The board thinks we should still try to use the device for emergencies, but I’m not too keen on the idea since we’re still trying to prevent security breaches…”
“Great minds think alike!” Clint nearly exclaimed before chugging a third of his beer.
“Tony…?” Steve tried again, but too paralyzed to articulate himself.
And, I hope everyone is taking care of themselves.
“I gotta say, I’m impressed with your punctuality, Rogers.” Tony attempted with a lazy smile. Steve only nodded but didn’t say a word as he began studying some data from the other day.
a humble man would say that about himself, Cap.” Bucky smirked as he clinked Steve’s glass. Steve could tell that Bucky was just teasing him which eased his apprehension.
Steve sighed; he knew this was going to become an issue during Bucky’s visit. Steve had hoped he would figure out the best thing to say to Bucky about his recent absence before his best friend arrived in town, but he was at a lost. Steve had been so busy with Synergy and trying to comprehend his feelings for Tony that he had neglected his friendship with his oldest friend. The two used to call each other at least once a week, but the last few months had been filled with infrequent updates and consistent failed scheduled phone chats.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Tony, are you serious? I really doubt playing music while we work is the most important thing.”
Steve was riding the subway back to Brooklyn. He needed some alone time before going back to the Tower to have dinner with Peter and Tony. Tony had sent Steve a message offering him a ride, but Steve declined; he knew he would end up confronting Tony and he was still struggling with how to cope with Tony rejecting him.
“W-what happened, Tony?”
Gamora left the office first, followed by Nebula. Nebula walked ahead of her sister, but Gamora stopped her as soon as they were a few feet away from the office.
“And,” Clint glanced quickly around the room, “what
“I wouldn’t ask you if I didn’t want to.” Tony answered quietly.
Tony nodded before looking away from Steve before gently untangling himself. He coughed a couple times, before turning his head to look at Steve, wearingly.
Bruce stared at Steve. “Tony didn’t tell you?”
Steve was too shocked at this point to contribute to the conversation. “You know what? I should probably leave. I’ll take a cab or car service of some kind or whatever.” He knew that he would end up saying something wrong; he needed some time to clear his head before talking to Tony about something he shouldn’t be concerned over.
Tony winced before leering at Steve. “Well,
“We need to keep an eye on this...I can feel it getting out of control. You know how he gets.” Gamora said coolly.
annoyed he missed a Tony Stark party.”
Tony was sitting at the little table on the edge of Steve and Sam’s kitchen. He was twirling around a beer bottle in his hands as he casually offered Sam a tour of the Synergy labs. Sam was sitting on the other side of the table, completely mesmerized by having a conversation with Tony Stark. Steve was standing at the kitchen counter, plating the rest of dinner.
Natasha and Clint ducked under and jumped over overturned cars, scanning the simulated victims of the crash for which equipment would be needed in the mobile clinic. Steve and Tony were inside the vehicle with Bruce and Thor, driving toward the scene of the crash.
“You know, I think I might just ask T’Challa if Peter and I could just live here…” Tony started, “this place is amazing.” He turned to look at Steve with a smile.
After some time, the uncomfortable feeling that had been between Steve and Tony when they first started spending time together again disappeared finally. Steve was beginning to feel the same way he had when he used to have dinner with Tony and Peter during most of the week and when he had stayed with them while he was recovering from surgery.
“Of course…” Steve smiled down at Tony, “I love you, Tony…and you would have done the same for me.” The way Steve was looking at Tony caused him to smile wide although his whole body was sore.
Steve tilted his head up and away from Tony. He couldn’t help himself from expressing how confused and a little embarrassed he was by the question.
Natasha shook her head. “None for me but knock yourselves out.”
“Nice job, Peter.”
known Romanov, I’m doing ‘fine’.” He motioned with air quotes at the end.
Peter’s eyes widened. “Dad!” He couldn’t contain how shocked he was.
“Tony! Your sense of humor always kills me.” The board member continued as he forcibly slapped both Rhodey and Tony on the shoulders before walking away.
Tony twirled the device between his fingers. “Okay, you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to.” He tried to convey with a smile that he was sincerely apologetic for frightening him.
Rhodey stared intently at Tony, seemingly on the verge of making Tony be honest with him right there while he was trying to enjoy breakfast. But eventually he backed off as his expression changed.
“Okay,” Tony laughed nervously, “maybe I went a
Loki appeared to sense Steve’s confusion. “My brother sent me a text as soon as he heard.” He clarified.
Steve’s eyes widened from the charge before his expression became harsh. He moved closer to Tony, his face mere inches away from the latter.
“Okay, don’t be weird, please, but I got the two of you something for your anniversary—”
“Fuck,” Tony swore as he pushed Steve up from his body then pulled him back down, “these are too difficult to open.”
Steve pulled away to look at Tony sweetly. “That sounds good, Tony.” He answered softly.
Steve sighed. He had accidentally overheard Tony’s conversation with Rhodey which led Steve to believe that Tony was close to going home before anything got physical between the two of them. Steve, through a surge of desperation, thought maybe letting Tony rest in his bed would lead to something, but Tony seemed awkward and timid.
“What…the fuck happened?” Tony groaned again as the music filtered through his suit.
Tony groaned loudly. “I, uh…,” he leaned forward as the volume in his voice dropped, “I…cried…after…having sex with Steve last night…”
“…I’ll leave a message if she doesn’t pick up, okay?”
“Loki…please…you can help us.” Thor pleaded once more.
Steve shook his head a few times; it wouldn’t hurt to ask, right? He wanted to spend more time with Tony that went beyond late nights in the lab or in Tony’s bed. Steve also wanted to get to know Peter; it would be weird to try to pursue something with someone without establishing a report with their kid.
“I don’t have the time or the energy to deal with this right now, Bucky. You can do whatever you want, but I’m not leaving this room until later this evening.”
Steve shook his head once more as he tried to get away from Bucky, but the latter had taken a firm hold of his shoulder with his bionic arm.
Thor shook his head as he reached out a hand across the table to stop Loki from leaving. “Then help us. If you fear for your safety—” Loki groaned, but Thor pressed on, “the best thing you can do is help us track Thanos down before he
“…uh, yeah…it is…” Tony lied before switching the conversation to Synergy and Peter.
Tony chuckled. “It seems like that’s easy to do.”
Steve took a moment before grabbing Tony’s hand. He held onto it before giving it a gentle squeeze. Tony smiled slightly upward at Steve, letting the other hold his hand until he pulled away a bit to sip out of his glass.
“…uh…maybe…” Steve looked downward, shuffling from side to side, “I’ll have to see how I feel…might need to go home to get a good night’s rest…Peter’s better about this now, but you know how excited he gets whenever I stay—”
Natasha nodded with a slight smile. Laura motioned for her to take the chair next to the bed.
After a moment, Steve finally hopped out of the bed before making his way to Tony’s kitchen. There, he found a plate covered with some wax paper on the island in the middle of the kitchen. Steve walked to the island and uncovered the plate to find an omelet. He smiled to himself, thinking about Tony cooking for him. Steve settled at the island, eating as quickly as possible. After, he made sure to clean up the kitchen.
Tony sighed before turning onto his back, pulling up Steve’s contact information which had migrated from his favorites then back within the last couple weeks. Tony inhaled then exhaled deeply before tapping on the phone icon next to Steve’s name. It rang once.
Tony was left staring dumbfounded as he watched Steve leave. Although the statement sounded innocent enough, something about it made this lonely Tony feel not so lonely in the moment. He smiled somewhat to himself before turning around to face the bar counter.
Steve looked around aimlessly, trying to convince himself that that was all there was to it before joining Tony and Peter in the kitchen again.
“I should probably keep this to myself considering that we
Peter shuffled once before he settled. “Um…Ned’s mom has a new boyfriend…and he said she’s happier now.” Peter looked intently at Tony and smiled.
Steve pointed at the device. “I didn’t realize you all were this far along…”
Tony tried not to eye Steve suspiciously. Remembering how he takes his coffee wasn’t something Tony was expecting from their burgeoning friendship.
"They still print newspapers?" He whispered.
time…but I’m sure Tony doesn’t have any issues there…”
“Tony, slow down. I’m still working on the second set.” He nearly raised his voice from frustration.
Steve flinched as Tony made a sleep noise, shaking the bed a little as he turned over some more. Steve propped himself up on his elbow to look back at Tony, but then settled back down on his side.
Steve saw him enter and waved with a smile. Tony waved back before walking over. Steve rose from his seat to give Tony a hug that was less awkward this time.
“Are you all right?” Steve asked quietly. He was leaning forward a bit, hands placed delicately in his lap.
Steve was enjoying the moment, but now he was angry with himself; he was upset that he had been so brazen, even if Tony sounded like he hadn’t been turned off by it.
“Who came up with the idea?” As soon as Bruce finished his question, Tony nearly choked on his drink, spilling some of the cocktail on his shirt. Bruce made a noise as he hopped out of the way.
Tony quietly groaned to himself as he tried to unbutton his shirt. Steve nodded before kicking his shoes off. He unbuttoned the first few buttons of his shirt before shuffling up the bed to lie against the headboard while Tony lingered at the edge.
“I packed last night, Tony.” Peter whined.
Steve then turned back to his workbag to get his tablet before walking over to a free console.
Steve watched Tony run over to a console, which was spewing a cloud of smoke. He gasped as Tony then sprinted to the other side of the lab, grab a fire extinguisher and put out a tiny fire that was near the console. Steve’s eyes widened as Tony slumped down to the floor in front of the console, freeing himself from his headphones before tossing them to the side. He pulled out a notepad but before he could scribble anything down there was another loud pop. Tony jumped up to retrieve the fire extinguisher again. He rushed over to put out a fire at the same console. However, this time he looked pleased with himself as he whipped out his notepad again and jotted down some notes.
“…we should get some sleep. We have to leave early tomorrow to get back to the lab, right?” He asked softly.
“…are you going to read it?” Peter looked down at the letter.
Tony breathed deeply before titling his head downward to kiss Steve. He used both hands to hold onto to Steve’s face while he bobbed his body upward and downward along Steve waist, but their bodies only faintly made contact. Steve repositioned himself as he used both hands to hold onto Tony as he moved.
“Relax, Rogers. I can carry my own bag.” Tony tried with a grin, but Steve could tell that he was most likely covering up how uncomfortable he felt.
Steve nodded as he followed Tony, taking the private express elevator up to the penthouse. As soon as they arrived at the level, Steve went to Tony’s bedroom to wait for him as the latter checked on Peter who was sleeping soundly. As Tony entered the master bedroom, Steve could tell he was still upset.
“He has a son—well, he’s adopted, but it’s the same nevertheless.” Steve coolly explained to Sam as his friend only nodded back as he took a sip of beer.
Tony was sitting next to Steve at a table that nearly took up most of the room. Their chairs were close enough for their legs to touch. Sensing Tony’s anxiety, Steve knew his lab partner’s sigh was mostly directed toward Obadiah and the board than at Clint.
Strange only huffed with amusement as he continued to check Tony’s vitals. He hummed quietly to himself.
Tony had his sunglasses on as he walked through the Morningside Campus of Columbia University. He waved at the student who recognized him but briskly quickened his pace to avoid getting caught signing autographs.
“Fine. Give it here.”
To be continued…
“Please don’t tell me you’re weird about sharing beds.” Steve chuckled. He leaned over toward his bedside table to grab a book. Tony continued to stare for a moment longer before answering.
Both Tony and Steve twisted around to see that Obadiah had invaded their very intimate moment.
Tony nodded before taking a moment to peal the covers back on his side. Steve shrugged before removing his pants and over shirt.
“I don’t know, Parker. Seems like a long shot.”
Tony looked up suddenly to see that Steve was awake.
guarantee that Synergy is safe? There was that explosion in New York not too long ago as well.”
Steve nodded. He could hear Tony through his headset, but most of his attention had been captured by the helicopter leaving the tower. He had seen New York from an airplane, of course, but it was nothing like seeing it from this vantage point, in a helicopter, and with Tony Stark.
“Nice to meet you.” Tony said with a smile.
“What would you like to hear, Sir?”
“Of course, Tony. I’m all yours.” Tony grimaced a little. He stayed with his back facing Steve so the latter wouldn’t see his expression.
“I’m not okay, Steve…before I met you…only two things made sense to me and that was working in the lab and taking care of Peter…” he paused as another cascade of tears flooded down his face, “…Steve, being with you scares the shit out of me—but not because you’re terrible…it’s because you’re wonderful and you just so happen to be really fucking hot,” he tried for a joke, but the seriousness of the conversation squelched any hilarity, “…everything about you makes me feel exposed and I’m not used to letting my guard down with someone…not like I have with you…”
Rhodey snickered again. “Tony. It’s all right if you stay over. I don’t mind.”
“Anthony.” Obadiah had stepped into the office.
Steve half smiled before turning to lean next to a table.
“Great presentation!” Happy shouted as he looked back at Tony, Steve, and Rhodey, holding his arms out against some very passionate reporters.
“Alas, until bedtime…” Tony concurred.
Steve waited before limping to the island. He rested a hand on Tony’s shoulder before rubbing it gently.
“Oh, well. I had no idea.” Steve attempted casually, hoping he hadn’t offended Loki.
Natasha sighed as she settled next to Steve. “How’s your night so far?”
He crouched down. “I think I see…a briefcase…?” He stood up slowly to look at the group.
“What an asshole. I can’t believe no one called him on it.” Sam shook his head back and forth with disgust.
Steve patted Rhodey on the shoulder again, thanking him before quickly walking out from underneath the canopy. He jogged toward the suite’s building, jogging through the lobby, and accessing the elevator quickly. As the elevator opened into the foyer, Steve searched around the space, finding Tony in the bedroom packing his clothes.
“I would like to, but that depends if it’s okay with Tony…” Steve meekly added before Tony could respond.
Steve rode in the passenger seat, listening to Tony, as they drove to the house in the Hamptons. Steve had never been to this part of Long Island before; he marveled at the rolling landscape as they drove along. And although Tony appeared calm, ever since they dropped Peter off earlier that day, Steve could tell that he was not at ease.
Tony slammed an open hand on the railing which unsettled Bruce. “That’s the problem with Steve. He always thinks he’s helping.”
“Loki!” Thor shouted again as he shook his brother around like a rag doll, “what have you done?!”
Steve smiled as he awkwardly hugged her. Natasha eyed them both, making Steve feel incredibly anxious. But instead of saying anything Natasha smiled at them before making a move to walk away.
Steve nodded before taking a deep breath. “It’s my fault…I don’t think I’ve ever really explained to you how much Bucky means to me, but it’s purely platonic, Tony…”
“This device right here will allow our team to help someone in need immediately. Using your specialized skills, the user will be able to program the device to assist effectively and sufficiently. And this—” Fury clicked another button which caused the device to collapse onto itself and disappear. The room returned to its normal light intensity, “—is just the beginning.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Because, Tony, I don’t want you to have to do everything for me. Or anything…I’m not taking advantage of you.”
“Rogers!” Clint appeared at the other end of the hallway, “we gotta go!” He waved for Steve as he shouted.
“How can I be both elated, yet
“Hey, how did it go?” He asked as he met Tony with an outstretched arm that landed on the latter’s waist.
Steve whimpered as he pushed upward sharply into Tony. Tony pushed back, both rocking into the other as their paces quickened.
“Uh…” Tony began, feeling that sharp pain in his chest, “maybe you should go home…” He finally let out quietly.
“I’m going to get some snacks and coffee from the café. I’ll be right back.” She rubbed Natasha’s shoulder before reaching over to kiss Clint delicately on his forehead. He nodded back at her as both he and Natasha watched her leave the room.
Steve nodded again as he pushed back into Tony’s hard cock. Tony smacked his ass and Steve heard the tube of lube snap open again.
Tony frowned at Peter before lying back down on the floor, groaning.
dating. They still needed to discuss their relationship. However, it felt like this dinner with Peter would either make or break whatever their relationship status currently was.
Tony shifted again to look at Steve. He grinned at him, but just enough for Steve to relax a little.
“I suppose we’ll need to go back in. We’ll practice creating the functions with the keys before the next simulation.” Tony kept his hands on his hips before turning around slowly to face Steve. Steve couldn’t help but stare intently at Tony; his change in tone was a little unnerving. Was this his attempt at apologizing?
Tony sighed. “The executive committee met with the board and we have two options: either we give Synergy to the government or bid for open contracts.”
“So, we’re good?” A firm pat on the back brought Tony out of his thoughts.
After a few minutes, the elevator chimed with arrival, opening the doors to reveal Steve. Tony waved at him, timidly, almost blushing from his nerves.
“…I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to get back to sleep.” Tony added, his head hanging low.
“Shut the fuck up, Rhodes.” Tony attempted as he sat back in the booth, but he couldn’t help being moved by Rhodey’s comforting comment.
All those years standing and smiling in front of cameras finally paid off because Tony managed not to look completely horrified as Mr. Beck described what sounded like the night he had made out with Steve on the way to his penthouse after Thor’s party.
“So…despite how Mr. Rogers looks right now…”
He then reached his hand out toward Steve. “Hi, I’m Tony Stark. A famous person.”
Tony walked further into the space, glancing around again before spotting Shuri. She waved at him as he walked toward her. She gave him a hug before introducing him to some of her friends, but Tony’s attention was divided: from his vantage point he could still see Steve with Bucky and Sam and Steve was still glancing in his direction from time to time.
“I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” Tony repeated. This time without opening his eyes, he turned his head away from Steve, holding his hand even tighter.
“Okay then. Let me know when I should come in. And thank you again, Tony.” Shuri waved before exiting the lab.
“No, we came all the way out here to protect Synergy and I don’t like bailing on something when I’ve already committed to it.” Steve said with resolute.
Tony would joke around with others, especially Bruce and Natasha, that occasionally verged on the flirty side, so Steve wasn’t sure if it was just his way of getting close with someone. Although it did feel different than what he had witnessed between Tony and others, Steve didn’t want to get his hopes up. He liked Tony and their working relationship; he was nervous he would ruin it with his personal feelings.
“…Steve’s lying in this hospital bed because of Synergy which makes it my fault…” Tony quietly countered Bruce, never taking his eyes off Steve, “…I knew this project would be a fucking nightmare…” He groaned as he leaned forward on the edge of the bed, fighting back another stream of tears.
. I asked you on this trip because I want us to repair—”
“Also…take your time, Tony. You’re great and you deserve the best. Just take your time.” He lingered, tapping his fingers a few times on the door before finally closing it.
Tony shook his head again as he tried to pry himself away from Steve, but Steve held onto him.
Obadiah let go of Steve’s hand with one last shake, his expression morphing back into that insincere smile, before walking away. Steve stood paralyzed, horrified by what had just transpired.
Steve leaned forward in his chair. “You think Loki will be in the mood to go to one of these things after having been arrested?”
“I know Steve sent you that letter, but…” Bucky started up again as it appeared that Tony was taking his time speaking, “…are you going to be calm enough to have a conversation?”
Yet, Tony was still incredibly terrified of fucking up his parental responsibilities. The day of the interview, however, he had forgotten that he needed to be at Peter’s school later in the day for a parent-teacher meeting, so his attention was divided while the others took control of the law student’s interview. Tony had felt somewhat terrible about not fully participating, but it sounded like the student knew what he was talking about and he seemed reserved and a willing team player. If only he had remembered where Steve attended law school…
“Ugh, forget it.” Steve let out quickly, lying down flat in the bed, trying to pull the covers up to his neck, but Tony yanked on the blankets as he continued to laugh. Steve then tried to turn over onto his side to face away from Tony, but the latter pulled on his body to turn him back around, still laughing although subdued.
Tony could tell from Natasha’s expression, which wasn’t easy to do usually, that something was bothering her. He motioned for her to continue.
It felt like the pit of Tony’s stomach dropped to the kitchen floor; now he was worried that Steve was planning to end things with him yet respected him enough to do so in person.
“So,” Tony began, “we have today and a good deal of tomorrow. Today, let’s finish in the living room and the dining room, then we can start on my old room and the basement. Sound good?”
Strange nodded as he crossed his arms. “Although the surgery went smoothly, we’ll need to keep him under for the next few days. We’ll see how he’s doing then. But if he wakes in the meantime, I think he’ll be well enough to go home.”
Tony shook his head. “You gotta do the basics first before trying to run, Steve. Otherwise you’ll wind up in the hospital again. Also, Fury said he won’t sign off on you rejoining the team unless you go to therapy. And, I don’t think I need to remind you that you were in a lab explosion not too long ago.”
“You’re going to get me into a lot of trouble saying that, Rogers.” Tony smirked before hopping off the table. He continued to watch Steve with the same flirty smile before arriving at a console where he manually changed the playlist.
Steve shook his head as he listened, making a move to respond, but Tony ignored him.
closer to Tony, but Steve wasn’t sure how to ask for it.
“Are you all right?” Steve hesitated before walking up to him.
Steve nodded slowly with a timid smile. “Uh, sure?”
Both Steve and Tony went silent as the traces of Tony’s reasoning hung in the air, building toward some tension Tony wasn’t entirely sure he was mentally or emotionally prepared to confront. Steve nodded slowly, but his expression was still very much concerned. He looked like he was about to reach out for Tony.
Tony nodded quickly. “Uh…Sharon seems nice.”
“This is legit! And there’s already food out!” He continued, waving an arm around at his friends before spinning around to head inside the plane.
“Well I’m only doing my best.” But Steve appreciated the insight. Although he tried to train himself not to bristle at criticism from others, he did value knowing he wasn’t on anyone’s bad side.
“Steve still talks about you
“What about that scientist tampering with the device multiple times?” He asked.
Tony let Steve hug him as he hugged back. They held still for a moment before Tony could feel the dull sensation in his chest again. He placed a hand on Steve’s chest before disengaging himself. He smiled as he patted Steve on the shoulder, turning around to face his console. He felt Steve rub his shoulder before letting go.
“No, I want to look through a few boxes just to give me an idea on how to go about appraising this shit.”
Steve sighed. He took his time, realizing that their conversation had escalated. However, Tony was pushing his limits.
Steve had his back facing Tony so he couldn’t see how pained his expression had become. He exhaled with relief thinking maybe Tony hadn’t picked up on how much he was looking forward to spending more time with him.
Steve smiled. “Whatever you get me will never be lame, baby.”
As more of his senses returned, he could smell smoke and fire. The moment felt too surreal; he tried to orient himself by turning toward the opposite end of the corridor toward his lab.
“Tony!” Tony tried to turn his body toward the voice, “are you all right?”
“I’m only here to get information on one of your former employees.”
Tony clenched the pillow underneath him, writhing in his sleep. He tossed and turned in the bed as his recurring nightmare about the night his parents died haunted his half sleep. He finally wrenched himself from the nightmare, sitting up in the bed, covered in sweat.
“Hey!” Hammer began to call after him, “what about lunch?”
Steve nodded again, but let out a painful sounding sigh as he joined Bucky at the table. The sigh was so distressing, it disturbed Bucky.
Steve lingered before trying to walk past Tony to the bedroom door, but Tony held out his arm again; he would only let go if it felt like Steve sincerely wanted him to let go.
Through his usual press daze, Tony finally entered the main part of the mansion, descending the grand staircase. He looked around, smiling for everyone as they noticed his arrival. His smile was on autopilot; he felt empty inside having to put on a show for the company and with Steve possibly present. For the presentation on Tony’s facial alteration device, the board had rented out space in the upper East Side in an historic house with a few restored balconies. The board had invited everyone in the industry, including members from the former Synergy project.
Sounds good! Looking forward to it also.
“Turn it up.” Rhodey sang along.
Sam grinned. “Oh man! Sorry I missed that. But I’m sure you were fine. Was Tony weird around you this morning or did you sneak out?” He sneered at Steve who rolled his eyes.
Steve struggled to join Tony standing. “So, I’m going to have to be the one who says no because we had pizza the other night?” He rested his hands on his hips as he looked back and forth between Tony and Peter who were both acting like they didn’t know what Steve was talking about.
Tony nodded with a grin. “I miss you so much, I’ll do whatever the fuck you want, baby…” his expression then changed as he was about to say something more.
“I’m sorry,” Tony couldn’t stop laughing, “I forgot to put J.A.R.V.I.S. on mute last night. I usually do when you stay over.”
“What?” Steve had asked as he joined Tony at his station.
Steve smiled; he looked downward before looking directly at Tony. “Okay, but I’ll hang out in the kitchen for moral support.”
“Ah, Mr. Rogers. Glad to see you again.”
Steve laughed. “I think we’re in the same boat.”
“Tony,” Steve was looking downward at him, holding onto his arms, “I understand where you’re coming from…and I’m on your side whatever you choose to do, but we can’t let whoever is trying to sabotage us win like this.”
Steve stopped rubbing Tony’s back, pulling away a bit to stare at him.
surprised; ever since returning to the lab from their outing, all he could think about was the possibility of having a quiet night in with Steve someday.
“Hey, Tony. Look at this.” He called, dusting the box off with one hand.
Steve squeezed Tony’s body before tilting his head to degree to look downward. “Tony, I forgive you, but I should have made it easier for you to talk to me…”
“Tony, I—”
Steve laid down in between Tony’s legs, and Tony held onto him even tighter. Steve moaned quietly as he pushed down into Tony, feeling his body with both hands as best as he could as they kissed. Tony moaned back, gasping for air whenever he could as he let his body push upward into Steve’s.
Steve winced as he tried to hide the bag more behind his back, but he was sure Bucky had already seen what he was hiding.
Steve’s face expressed his horror as he stared at the bedroom door.
“Shots?” Tony asked in the most polite tone with his arms out stretched.
Bruce nodded wearily after Fury finished. “Well…I guess if that’s it…”
“Bureaucratic nonsense.” Tony walked through the holographic image as the device pulled apart to reveal the vibranium core.
“Hey,” Sharon greeted Steve as he walked up to her and Natasha.
Tony laughed again but it was more subdued this time. He pulled Steve closer toward his body before gently caressing his face.
“…but may I quickly get your autograph?” The student held her notebook out open for Tony to sign.
“This is really nice, Tony.” Steve offered, smiling at Tony.
Steve nodded again, but slowly this time. He looked to be ruminating over the information.
Tony nodded with the hugest grin. “Oh yeah, I’ve definitively experienced that.”
Steve continued to laugh as Tony began wrestling around and nudging him. “Tony!” Tony had lightly pinched him, “Tony! Stop!” But he was laughing too hard to really do anything as Tony pinned him down in the bed.
After a few weeks of silence, Steve tried to call Tony, but he never answered. Steve was afraid to push communication even further without Tony responding; all Steve could think about was their blow ups in the past and he knew an argument over their breakup would probably end poorly.
“…I remember vividly when my parents died. I was twenty-one and they had left for a few days for vacation but had stopped in Roslyn Heights to visit a friend. Of course, the detour had been last minute…they—someone smashed into their car…they didn’t survive…”
Bruce squeaked, shoving the piece of paper into his pocket. “Of course, not.” He joined Tony at the console, “so, uh, the reactor…” he tried, pointing to a projection.
Tony and Steve hadn’t spoken to one another since that Monday: Tony kept to his office either at work or at home. Steve, too worried that he would upset Tony even more by trying to explain himself, stayed in the lab. Once or twice he thought about seeking Tony out, thinking he could try to talk to him either in his office or on the phone. However, the way Tony reacted to him keeping the diary alarmed Steve; of all their arguments and misunderstandings, Steve had never seen Tony upset like that before.
Even though Steve tried his best to be as open as possible with Tony, they never really discussed the state of their evolving, intimate relationship. Tony hadn’t attempted any other additional move beyond an occasional kiss or intense cuddling. Also, Steve wasn’t sure if he should make the first move; although he ultimately discovered some newfound courage to pursue whatever was going on between himself and Tony, Steve found himself reverting to his old dating habits. As mentioned before, Steve’s sexual experiences were also lacking, to put it mildly; he had only been with two other people before meeting Tony.
Steve smiled at Tony as he patted him on the shoulder before walking over to Bucky. Tony watched Steve leave, frustrated that another moment had been interrupted, and this time by Bucky. He scanned the bar, spotting Sam talking to one of Steve’s professors. He figured maybe he could ask Sam about Steve and Bucky. It wouldn’t hurt to ask, right?
Tony’s expression remained the same, but this time Steve could tell that he was trying to control his emotions from appearing overly exposed. Tony then patted Steve on the back before returning to finish answering questions.
At the press event before the conference presentation tomorrow, Obadiah planned to announce new plans for Stark Industries while Thanos’s contact was scheduled to picked up the weapon. The press event was the last move Obadiah needed to make before gaining majority control over the company.
He heard Tony sigh heavily, signally he had realized he had given Steve some incorrect sequences. Tony took a moment to review his solutions before reading the rest of the figures.
“It’s not that you’ve been with other people before, I know that, Tony.” Steve was now sitting back on his heels with his hands on his hips, “it’s the way you talk about yourself like you were the town tramp.”
Not only had his father kept from him how he truly felt toward him, Tony had never lived up to the image his father saw of him. What did he have to show? Pepper often deferred to him for serious company decisions, but she was the CEO of Stark Industries and he lost control of his dad’s legacy project. He had his own kid now to take care of, but how much of Tony’s baggage from his relationship with his father may have appeared in his relationship with Peter?
Steve cleared his throat. “…I have to be honest…” he sighed, “…I want this but…I’m not going to be good at it…”
Pepper shook her head. “Steve cares about you, Tony. He’ll talk…I bet he’s trying to give himself some time to have a productive conversation. You just need to give him the opportunity, okay?”
“Uh, hold up, Rogers,” Tony interrupted with a grin, “yachting with T’Challa sounds too good to pass up.”
Tony looked at everyone else before looking over at Steve who was on the opposite end of the helicopter. He sighed heavily as Bruce took his eyeglasses off to rub his forehead.
Steve cleared his throat when it became clear that Tony was still waiting for him to say something.
“Now, remember Steve’s accident,” Tony pulled into the private residence garage of the tower with Peter bouncing around in the passenger seat, “he’s not feeling well so he might not be able to do much for a while.”
Bruce shook his head a few times. “What would make you say that? Why don’t you ask him? You may be pleasantly surprised.” He tried, attempting not to make it obvious that he had already discussed the trip with Steve.
Steve unzipped his pants before helping Tony with his, removing both their shirts. Steve laid down on Tony, feeling his chest with both hands as he kissed Tony’s neck. Tony moaned as he squeezed Steve’s ass, spreading his cheeks a bit to rub him.
overboard.”
“Well, you’re my teammate. Your safety is important to me, Tony.” Steve’s expression was kind and innocent.
Tony laughed. “Okay, Parker. I’ll figure out what we’re having if you cook most of it.” He quickly looked over and downward at Peter.
Tony shook his head as he threw the diary across the lab. He then picked up his tablet to resume scavenging for parts. After another moment, Tony passed the diary again which was laying open, face down. He sighed loudly as he walked up to the diary, closing it shut before he could see any of the open pages. He walked it over to his work bag, shoving it inside, not really sure what he planned to do with it.
As Tony closed the door to Peter’s bedroom, he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. As he retrieved it, he saw that he had received a message from Steve.
Tony sat back in his chair. He looked at Steve before glancing over at Rhodey and Bruce, taking a moment to project an infectious smile.
“I’m glad I meet your standards.” Tony grinned at both Whoberis and Lupho before looking back at Steve.
“Fuck me, baby. You are
“Which is good because there’s a possibility that we’ll need to manufacture more of this thing once we figure out what its limits are.” Steve added.
Tony managed to wonder as he wiped his eyes.
Steve chuckled as he awkwardly got back onto the bed and handed Tony the lube and the condom. Tony pulled Steve downward and kissed him before turning him back onto his side. Steve heard Tony open the tube and his breath hitched as he felt Tony squeeze his body again; he could feel his body reacting with anticipation as Tony took his time feeling him before entering a finger.
carried away,” he winked at Steve which earned him a hearty laugh, “anyway, I forgot that my parents were planning to come back to the house before driving back to the city, so they found the living room and the kitchen nearly torn apart…I also won the competition, but I guess that's beside the point.” Tony grinned.
Tony thought to himself as he thought about that evening. And not only was he mulling over his past relationship failures, Tony was too traumatized now to tell Steve how he felt after the whole thing with his dad’s diary. His friends were right, he needed to take his time. Tony knew he needed to take things slow with Steve, so saying out loud how he truly felt needed to wait. Maybe just confirming the status of their relationship would be the best thing to do now.
Tony looked at Steve as he kept laughing, rolling from side to side on the bed. Steve scowled as he watched Tony laugh for a good minute or so.
explosive. If there is such a thing.”
Pepper conveyed that she understood Tony’s apprehension as she looked directly at him. “Then trust him when he says there’s nothing going on with his best friend.”
Steve shook his head a few times, still holding onto Tony. “I want to, Tony.”
Gamora looked down at the tablet before look back up at her sister, her expression becoming enraged.
Steve nodded, this time smiling, before walking ahead of Tony, but Tony stepped forward, looping an arm around Steve's waist to guide him inside.
Steve watched Tony slowly turn around. He looked surprised, as if no one had ever offered to share a meal with him before.
After some time, they finished eating. Tony announced that he needed to shower before resuming unpacking, so Steve followed him back to their room.
Tony grinned as he looked downward at Steve. “…historically, I’ve done it both ways. It really depended on the person, but…” he took his time stretching himself out on top of Steve who squiggled underneath to reposition them.
“Sounds good.” Steve responded without turning to face Tony.
“…I don’t really talk about my dad with anyone except the one or two times with a therapist I saw once…”
“Okay, so here’s everyone’s ticket.” Sam handed both Tony and Bucky theirs. “We should sit down and wait. After the ceremony, we should try to get Steve to take some photos before grabbing a drink somewhere.”
“I’ll make sure you get home in one piece, Rogers.” Tony offered, verging on the edge of flirty. Steve wasn’t sure how to interpret it, but he figured he owed his team another hour or so.
Tony sat across from Rhodey. “How was the drive in?”
Natasha nodded slowly, but her expression remained serious.
“So,” Pepper began as soon as Tony finished his last thought, “are you ready for later tonight? Finally figured out what you’re planning to say?”
After a while, Bruce could feel himself becoming more relaxed, finding himself laughing and opening up more.
“Well we need to do another test run after we show you all the labs first.” Tony pressed a button on his clicker before depositing it into his pocket. The image of the vibranium spun around before collapsing onto itself. Tony glanced upward and accidentally locked eyes with Steve. Steve looked over at Fury to avoid any prolonged contact.
“If you find anything interesting, just give me a holler.” He added without looking back at Steve.
“Tony, what happened?” Bruce called.
Steve expressed bewilderment before unzipping the pocket he kept the chip in. “This?”
Tony was staring at him, incredulous, like Steve was going out of his way to offer him something extremely generous, when Steve was pretty sure that not doing something in bed that your partner had explicitly said they didn't want was the actual bare minimum. But they'd established that Tony hadn't gotten even the bare minimum, hadn't they?
, "that since Wanda always works well with Pietro, we should just take the easy way out and-- Cap, are you even listening to me?"
And right now, it didn't seem like he could offer Tony anything he wanted at all.
"Yeah, Winghead," Tony told him. "I think."
. "I wish I could hold you."
How could Tony be in love with someone who was willing to murder him?
Steve takes a few stumbling steps forward, trying to follow Tony, and then his legs give out and he crashes to his knees. He crawls, just like Tony wanted. He realizes he's crying again.
"I'll handle this," Steve tells Tony, with a confidence he doesn't feel. "All you have to do is stay with me. If there's a shot you can take, feel free to take it, but if not, you don't have to do anything. Okay?"
As they entered Brooklyn, getting off the bridge, Steve braked, and Tony leaned into him. One of Tony's hands slid an inch or two forward, and he didn't move it back. Tony's thumb slipped just inside the leather of Steve's belt, and Steve forgot to breathe for a good five seconds.
When Tony figured out who this box's owner was, he was definitely going to need to ask them for some shopping recommendations.
"Come on, Shellhead," he says, softly, quietly, under his breath.
Steve looks up and meets Iron Man's eyes. "More?"
Steve wasn't about to let Tony get away with believing that.
Tearing his gaze away from Steve's body, he lets himself look at Steve's face. He expects Steve's expression to complement his actions; he expects to find Steve chasing his own pleasure, heedless of anything else. The tawdriness of pornography. But Steve is staring down at him, enraptured,
He's probably not fast enough right now, anyway. Ghost can probably fire before Tony can.
At least he's still got the drive. But this isn't a particularly great situation to be in.
A man's voice from somewhere behind Steve jarred him out of his reverie.
There. That was more like Tony. He was going to stand up for himself.
The word echoes, hollow and false. Steve knows that Tony knows he's lying. Tony was right when he said Steve wasn't good at lying, when he said Steve had to believe--
. All because of him.
Steve reached up and idly ran two fingers over the lapel of Tony's shirt. "And do I get to see you out of this?"
It was easier to breathe now, with Tony smiling at him, with Tony touching him. "So he goes to public school, and then he goes to Cambridge. And when he's at Cambridge, he and one of his classmates, Clive, they... fall in love with each other. He realizes he's gay. He's happy."
Had Tony forgotten? "I tried to tell you," Steve told him. "When the first story broke. I tried to tell you then." He knew he was getting louder, angrier, more frustrated. "You didn't believe me!"
"I'm sorry it has to be under these circumstances, Mr. Stone," Steve replied. It was an answer that didn't require him to say anything nice about Tiberius, and from the brief flash of annoyance in Tiberius' eyes, it was clear that he knew that.
Steve smiles at Iron Man, hoping to put him at ease. It's hard to tell with the armor, but he thinks Iron Man is a little more relaxed. "Well," Steve says, "here I am with you, so it looks like you're doing better than him already, huh?"
Tony takes another step back as Steve hits the floor, and right now Steve's just glad Tony's staying out of the way. He's got this.
Metal clicks beneath Steve's hands, and then splits beneath his fingers into two halves, chestplate and backplate. Steve eases the heavy panels away, half-aware of the shine of unpainted metal underneath, but he concentrates first on getting the bigger pieces out of the way. Then he looks up.
Steve was very conscious of the fact that his shirt was sleeveless, and if Tony continued on his path, there was a whole lot of arm for him to cover. And after that, Steve didn't know what Tony would do. It was an uncertainty whose every option was something he was going to enjoy. He couldn't remember being this far gone over just
But that was okay. Tony was still here.
The Teflon is a hard no, though.
. And that meant Steve knew who had put it there.
Carol probably shouldn't have been enabling him.
The Avenger on comms was Carol, though, and as far as he knew, Carol was still backstage. "Cap," she said, her voice taut with something that might have been fear. "Cap, you're really not going to like this."
"We were fighting," Tony gasps out, pathetic, still half-sobbing, choking on the words. "We were-- we were-- sometimes we don't always see eye to eye. It was bad. It was a mistake. I-- I shouldn't have done it--"
He'd tried so hard, but in the end, it was like the drinking, wasn't it? He could help Tony, but Tony had to want to be helped. And Tony had saved himself just in time, back then. He'd beaten the odds. He'd survived. But no more miracles were coming.
Steve takes a few strides forward, puts his hands on the workbench, leans in. He knows he's a big man. He knows he has
"More than okay, Shellhead," Steve breathed, barely whispering, so that the nickname couldn't be overheard. Tony's smile was brighter than the sun.
Under him, Tony shivers once, convulsively, and goes very still. He's holding his breath, Steve realizes. Steve's probably squashing him after all. Steve's usually scrupulously careful about not crushing Tony. Or anyone, really. He's so much stronger than most people that he has to care a whole lot about how he touches them. He's pretty sure he's never just... lain down on someone. Not since the serum, anyway.
"You're not required to--" Steve begins, weakly, but Tony's hand is sliding down his stomach and it's hard to think about anything that isn't the precise location of Tony's hand at this moment. Steve's world is a few square inches in size.
Tony's smile was a flash of white teeth in the half-light. "Not sick of me yet, huh?"
When Tony glanced over, Steve was very carefully not looking at him, eyes trained on the instrumentation. So much for Steve being his friend again, he supposed.
. Whatever this is, Tony's doing it. Relief floods through him. They've got this. It's going to be all right. It was all a feint. Tony isn't handing those plans over after all.
"Why do you ask?"
"You just stay right there," Steve tells him. "I'll call you a doctor--"
But another man called out, "Is Captain America up here? Captain, we were responding to a call from ViaStone security when we got another call from... Wasp? She was at Avengers Mansion. She said she'd been monitoring the police bands, and she wanted to let us know you were on an active mission here, responding to a supervillain threat. Do you need any help?"
"With me in the studio today," she said, "here to discuss the allegations against Mr. Stark and his bodyguard Iron Man, is one of Iron Man's longtime teammates and the Avengers' current co-chairperson, the Sentinel of Liberty himself, Captain America."
It would have been easier if Tiberius had been hitting Tony. It wouldn't have been better, by any means, but it would have been simpler. Steve would have had something to point to -- a scrape, a scratch, the shadows of healing bruises. He would have been able to show Tony a sign that something wasn't right. Tangible proof.
The emergency lighting is on on this floor as well. Cabinets of computers line the room in long rows, and their little lights blink. These aren't the main servers for Stark Solutions; as Tony's employee had said, this is the restricted stuff. Steve had looked at the layout. There's a bank of terminals at the other end of the floor, which is the only way to access any of this data. None of it is on the main network, or so the plans said. And that's where the cameras aren't working, by the terminals. It doesn't take a genius to guess what Ghost is doing.
Here was the awkward part.
He hadn't given very clear directions. Tony's other hand slid over his hip, up his side, a comforting, bracing touch. And it was a good guess, because that was what Steve had needed earlier, but it wasn't what he needed now.
Steve takes a deep breath. "Do you mean-- are you talking about a date?"
"Good," Tony told him, and Steve smiled. "Can you wiggle your toes?"
"Tony--"
special?" he asked, awestruck. "I-- I really mean that much to you? So much that you'd want to do that with me? You've been waiting your whole life for... me?"
He's always found it helpful to have a goal, a focus for his sense of determination, and he has a goal now: just keep touching Tony until there's no more tension anywhere in his body. When he thinks about it like that, it's basically the same goal he had at the start of the evening.
, obviously, Tony thought, as he admired Steve run -- was that they'd fought together so long that at this point they barely had to say anything.
Tony was practically nuzzling Steve's hand, apparently eager for as much of Steve as he could get. He seemed calmer. Happier. "Mmm. Can you say that part again?"
Tony laughs and kisses him. He should probably get up. He doesn't want to.
"What," Steve said, laughing, "in my bed?"
Jan looked up, past Steve's shoulder to the doorway behind him, and she breathed in, a sharp surprised breath. Her eyes went wide. "Tony?"
During the fourth or fifth episode that Iron Man puts on, Steve's eyes start to fall shut just as a man is slapping another man in the face with a large trout. He can feel himself start to list to the side, his cheek pressing against Iron Man's metal shoulder.
It's a terrible sensation, and it's also an oddly familiar one. Steve can't imagine when this ever happened to him before, though, and now is probably not the best time to contemplate it.
Steve's never done it. He's never bitten anyone susceptible, anyway; Blade didn't take. But he doesn't think it can be all that hard. He thinks he'll know how, if he tries. He still feels the craving for it, a jittery thrumming under his skin, sort of like hunger and sort of like desire, but not quite the same as either. He thinks he might like to bite Tony, if Tony wanted him to. He can't say that. That's weird.
It wasn't even all Tiberius' fault. Sure, his network had started it, but then everyone else picked it up. Everyone. Every station. Every paper. Every magazine. Every news website.
"You don't have to," Tony said, eyes wide and panicked, unfocused. Steve wasn't sure Tony was seeing him anymore. "I'll do whatever you want." He sounded like a hostage. "I'll already do anything you want. You don't have to bribe me, honest--"
Steve thrusts gently in and out of Tony's gorgeous mouth with a slow roll of his hips, and Tony moans again.
Fury chuckled. "Whose idea do you think it was in the first place?"
"I know." God, he wished there were something he could do. "But it's going to get better. I believe that."
"Yeah," Steve said, helplessly. "Yeah, okay."
was something anyone could hold Tiberius on, and even the police themselves hadn't known.
In fact, it was pretty much a straight shot of bare, cracked laminate flooring from the escalator to the far end of the floor where Mordo was. He'd left a makeshift barricade of light-up animals in a heap about three-quarters of the way down the floor, though, blocking their line of sight. It looked like even supervillains wanted to preserve an air of mystery.
"I'm good," Steve said. "I'm good." He took a breath. "I just-- can you-- I want you to--" He took another breath. "I-- I keep thinking about your hands. A lot." He felt like a string strung too tight, vibrating with tension. He wanted everything too much.
There's silence between them, then, like Mr. Stark is considering and discarding a dozen different things to say.
"I'm getting you something to believe. It's going to be okay." He smiled. "Trust me. It'll verify."
"Just figuring out the lay of the land," Steve said, which was true enough. He realized his other hand had come to rest on Tony's hip, an inch or so from the hem of the t-shirt Tony was still wearing. "I have a question, though. How far up does the no-go zone start?"
Tony was putting his entire heart in Steve's hands. More than that. This was every dream, every hope, every wish Tony had had for a decade, and it was all coming true. Tony could have this. Tony was trusting Steve with everything in him, holding nothing back. It was humbling and more than a little frightening to know that Tony was giving Steve everything he had. But he was going to try as hard as he could to be worthy. Maybe everyone else had broken Tony's heart, but that wasn't going to be him.
Oh, Tony. "And I don't need that," Steve said, gently, but firmly.
Damn him.
"I'm going to say this now, I suppose," Steve said, and Tony tensed. Uh-oh. Wrong move. "It's nothing bad," he added. "Nothing bad, I promise." He exhaled. "I just want to say that we don't have to talk about him. We don't have to talk about anything that happened tonight, or today, or this entire week. We can if you want. I'd be happy to. But only if that's what you want. I'm just saying that I'm not going to push you. We can talk about anything you want. Anything at all. If you want me to sit up with you until dawn and tell you about every movie I've seen in the past year, I can do that." He smiled. "Okay?"
He realized Tony was looking at him expectantly. Tony had asked him a question.
Yeah, that's a gun.
exactly this. Steve wanted him to want it as much as Steve himself did.
"Well," Steve says. There's a warm glow within him. "If you're sure."
Steve, brilliant tactician that he is, gets the message, and immediately rips Tony's shirt open. Tony's tie slithers off his shoulders and hits the table. Most of the buttons work free. One pops off. Tony can't really bring himself to care about that as Steve pushes the shirt off his shoulders and Tony pulls his arms free. Steve shoves a chair out of the way, backs Tony up against the table, and lifts him up, setting him down on the polished surface. Definitely also hot.
"That's because it's true."
Steve still didn't think Tony had made the right call back then, but he'd known that neither of them could take what it had done to their friendship. Tony had apologized. They'd made up. They were better. And surely Steve's opinion was the one that counted. Steve was the one who'd been hurt. And he'd forgiven Tony. It was over. Except it wasn't, because now news sites in search of pageviews were dragging it all up again, as if they thought they understood it all. They didn't understand a damn thing. They didn't even know Tony was Iron Man. And they sure as hell didn't know what it had cost Tony to do any of what he'd done. They talked about him like he didn't have feelings, like none of this had hurt him, and it wasn't right.
Steve's hands tightened on Tony. "I'm right here. He didn't ruin a goddamn thing. We won."
Tony Stark is Iron Man. It seems almost impossible to believe. Thirty seconds ago, Steve knew two distinctly different men -- one his best friend in this time, his teammate, his beloved, and the other a more distant acquaintance, a genius engineer, his team benefactor, his landlord. And now he knows that they're one and the same.
The door clicked shut.
"Oh!" Steve said. "Yeah, I passed them on the way in. I'll go get them."
"I want," he said, slowly, rolling the word around his mouth. "I want." He'd never been good at coming up with a vision of the future. Maybe that was why Tony was asking him to try. A life with Tony. What would it look like?
He knew he wasn't subtle and he knew he definitely wasn't suave, but surely Tony already knew what he was getting into, with him. And he also still wanted Tony, a hell of a lot. He didn't think -- although he knew some people might have -- that physical desire in any way cheapened what he felt for Tony, emotionally. It was all love.
He had no idea what to expect, and he'd never enjoyed going in blind, but he was positive this wasn't going to be the deadliest fight he'd ever been in. Tiberius was only a baseline human, and if he was foolhardy enough to try to take Steve on directly, he was absolutely going to lose. But Tiberius had spent the entire week demonstrating that he definitely wasn't stupid, so he probably had a different plan. Steve wished he had some idea of what it was. Everything he could picture as a worst-case scenario stemming from his own involvement was along the lines of Tiberius using Tony as a hostage once he figured out Steve was there. But, assuming that Tiberius still didn't know about Tony's secret identity, he was definitely going to be underestimating Tony's ability to get himself out of his own hostage situation, which Tony already had to do every few months. Not a lot of people knew how good Tony was at hand-to-hand; Steve had trained Tony himself. Plus, Tony could remotely summon the armor if he really needed it.
The box was metal, probably aluminum or steel, painted in that most favorite of kinky colors: black. It was maybe two and a half feet long -- just long enough for the crop -- and about a foot deep. Whatever blow had staved it in enough to split one corner had also broken the lock, and that meant Tony could lift the lid, which gave way with a screech of metal and the scraping of scratched paint. It didn't quite lift up all the way anymore -- the hinges were definitely busted -- but there was enough room for Tony to fish out the contents, one item at a time.
"I absolutely meant it." Mr. Stark's voice is gentle but fierce. He could practically give the Avengers lessons in how to comfort scared civilians. Steve's starting to feel like he personally could use some comfort. "So what's the matter, Captain? What's wrong?" He frowns. "Don't tell me that you and Iron Man are fighting. That would be terrible. I have a lot invested in the two of you."
"Of course I meant it," Steve said, a little confused, because they'd been over this, hadn't they? "You're still my friend, Tony. Nothing's ever going to change that. I'm glad you're in love. Doesn't matter to me if it's with a man or a woman. I'm just so glad you've finally found someone who's this good to you."
"So," Tony asked, letting desire purr into his voice like the hum of a perfectly-tuned engine, "you going to let me see you in a little... less?"
, okay? You are. So maybe I don't know your name, but I know who you are. You can't be someone you're not. Not like this. It doesn't work like that."
Steve stares in horror. "No one's
Steve turns his hand over, so now Tony's fingers lie in the center of his palm, and he closes his hand over them, delicately. Tony breathes in, short and sharp.
The expression that passed over Tony's face then was an odd kind of wistfulness. Steve didn't understand it.
Tony takes a breath. "It's Wednesday, December 5," he says. Another breath. "The year is 2012." Another breath. "And you have a severe case of amnesia."
The hair on the back of Steve's neck prickled, and he went dizzy, lightheaded with fear. "Tony," he said, very carefully. "Are you trying to tell me--"
He didn't pack any of the photographs of him and Tony. He wasn't going to need them anymore.
There was a sigh from Tony's direction, and then the whispering of fabric. Steve wondered what Tony was upset about now, and if it was something new. Probably not. He hoped not. Tony had enough to be upset about.
And Steve, heart in his throat, waited to hear the prognosis. He wanted someone, anyone to tell him that Tony was going to be okay. He opened his mouth to ask.
Tony's got one of his spare armors, one of the briefcase ones, all boxed up on his side of the bed, because sometimes the Avengers need to assemble in that much of a hurry. Right now Steve's glad to see it, because he winces at the thought of how much work it would be to get Tony downstairs to his armory. It's not Tony's newest, fanciest armor, but surely it ought to be plenty strong enough for Ghost, because Tony started fighting the guy at least ten armor redesigns ago.
Then he feels warm air against his skin, hears the quiet sound of an exhalation, and it hits him all at once: Iron Man's not using the vocal filters because Iron Man's
Tony was in the kitchen, and Tony wasn't alone.
"I'm not going to lie to you," he says. "Do I wish that events had transpired differently? Yes, of course. But I'm not going to hold it against you because you've found happiness with someone you love. I'm not going to hold it against Iron Man, either," he adds. "And I just-- I hope it works out for both of you. I wish you all the best."
He wondered what Tony was doing right now. Tony was probably seeking comfort from Tiberius. Steve hated to think of it. Tiberius had started this. Tiberius wasn't safe. It was just that Tony didn't know that.
Did Tony really think that he'd be here, right here, tonight, if he were a disappointment?
He waits for Steve to turn away, to condemn him, to walk out and take his chances in the future with someone safer, someone better, someone who hasn't become a monster.
because he needed to use his brain at least a little bit longer. "I kind of figured that out when I saw the riding crop."
He remembered the way Tony had hugged Tiberius when they'd met, the way he'd held him like he'd never wanted to let him go. The way he'd stared at Tiberius like Tiberius was the only other person in the room. If Tiberius had been a woman, Steve thought, ruefully, he'd have seen it in an instant. This was how Tony behaved with people he wanted. Hell, with people he'd slept with. The two of them must have been lovers before. Steve was certain of that now. But Steve hadn't seen it then, because he'd been so sure that Tony was straight. And he'd been so very wrong. He was an idiot. He'd thought he'd known everything about Tony, all of his secrets, but Tony had never told him this. Tony had never trusted him with this.
If Tony was willing to talk to him at all, he had one more chance to convince him to get the hell away from Tiberius.
Tony bit his lip again. "But you're upset with me," he said, quietly, and, God, he was a genius, wasn't he? "You're upset that I didn't tell you."
"Steve is Captain America," Tony said, with a sheepish smile. His face was still flushed.
There's a rattling, echoing laugh. "But I'm not like you." Iron Man pronounces this as if it's a settled fact, a law of the universe. "You're good and kind and honest and I'm-- I'm-- I'm a man in a mask. And some days I don't think you'd much like the man underneath it."
So much for his plans for the rest of the night.
? And
"Do you even know how you're going to do this?" Mr. Stark asks. "Iron Man has a secret identity. What are you going to do about that, exactly? Is he going to sign the marriage license as
"If you don't want to," Steve says, "then of course I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do."
Steve frowns. "Your... father?"
"That's a very interesting opinion,
what you want me to do?" he asked, and it was very clear what else he had in mind.
He shouldn't get angry. He'd lose. He was already losing. But Tiberius infuriated him. And Tiberius knew that he was, in fact, getting away with it.
"Steve," Tony said, low and desperate. "Steve, please. Look at me."
And of course, that was the moment that Steve chose to... well,
Tony looked up suddenly. His lips were parted in surprise.
If Steve hadn't been half out of his mind with worry for Tony, his attention focused on the rasping breaths in his earpiece, on the wobbly gleam of metal every so often in his peripheral vision, he would have been sharper. His shield would have been up. He would have been ready for anything.
"What?" Steve asks, confused. "Why?"
There wasn't any good way to say
Oh. She thought Tony had done this to him. She thought Tony was punishing him. He supposed that was far simpler than the actual explanation.
Steve hopes his hair isn't sticking straight up.
It's a few days after the new team has finally come together. It's the morning after Steve kissed him for the first time, the morning after Tony took his hand and led him to his bed. The media can say what they like about him -- they always do -- but it was Steve, and Tony thought they'd been waiting long enough.
"That too, soldier," Tony said, acknowledging his point with a grin. "Obviously, yes, it would have some great benefits for certain kinds of training. But think of the therapeutic uses! Controlled exposure therapy for phobias. Practicing difficult conversations. Safely re-experiencing traumatic memories with help, but changing them. It'd be like guided visualization on a whole new level. It'd be life-saving. Literally life-saving. Can you imagine it?"
His tone suggests that he doesn't expect anything about him to make Steve happy, and Steve's not sure why. Steve loves him. Tony has to know that. Steve must be missing a few pieces of the puzzle.
“Watch it be someone totally out of left field like…Tony Stark.” Sam joked which prompted Bucky to continue laughing uncontrollably.
, let alone a kid, but he knew he would be doing Peter a disservice if he hadn’t taken him in. Peter had other extended family, like his Aunt May, but she wasn’t able to care for him fulltime, nor had the means to support him financially. Surprisingly, May had been more than appreciative that Tony was able to give Peter a comfortable life. When it came to the adoption, Tony had remained mindful of changing Peter’s last name; he cared for Peter and truly thought of him as his son, but it seemed disrespectful to his parents and his aunt to change his name.
“That’s easier said than done,” he inhaled as he tried to think of a plan, “let me know when he comes to talk to you and keep a mental note of anyone else who does. I want to keep track of anyone who might be leaking secrets.”
Steve nodded as he listened. Tony sniffled again. “Everything was barely fine before we broke up, I just made it worse. I don’t even think we can be friends...I’m not…good for you, Steve.”
The guard shook his head quickly. “Nope. Just the mailman, Mr. Stark. You still get mail?”
“Courtesy?”
“Did you have a nice time at the thing last night?” He asked in between bites.
Tony thought he was overthinking things, because something about Steve’s face caught him off guard; he looked somewhat dejected.
Steve glanced at her and smiled. He had enjoyed getting to know Natasha; she was just as level-headed as him, if not more, and he knew he could always count on her.
“What are you two thinking of this time?”
.” He gently corrected as he whispered to Peter.
Steve chuckled as he took the tags out of the box. “Thank you, Tony, that was really thoughtful of you.” He kissed Tony before handing him his gift.
Tony groaned as he turned to face a console. He didn’t need the unsolicited dating advice right now.
“Yes, of course, Mr. Stark.” The staffer quickly motioned for everyone to follow her until they found the aforementioned conference room.
“…so, what’s next, Strange?” Bruce was standing next to the hospital room door with Shuri.
Steve chuckled as he looked at his confused friend while pointing to the ceiling.
” He asked again in a low voice, markedly different from his first “what”.
Tony motioned toward the image. “Go ahead.”
“No, Buck!” Steve took a moment, “Tony and I are…in one of the couple suites…”
Tony looked at Steve before making a move to catch up with Thor, but Steve grabbed him by the arm.
Shuri laughed. “Well, I may be in my late twenties, but I think I know a thing or two.” She winked at Tony before pulling out her tool kit to work on the device.
I got it.” Steve continued to input the last set which was, of course, correct. Tony stopped struggling as the device began generating specs for the remote replication. Steve heard his lab partner scoff before standing up straight. Tony then flung the tablet he was holding onto one of the simulated couches.
As Steve and Tony came upon the stand, Steve slid across the floor and Tony tried to do the same, but almost fell over. Steve managed to pull him to safety before the robot flung some lab tubes in their direction.
“Are you seriously writing this down?” Tony had turned around quickly, almost as if he had eyes on the back of his head.
Haha, well I should go to bed! Night!
Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay, I’ll do it first. Just relax, you big baby.” He smirked at Steve before holding the device underneath his chin, taking a huge deep, dramatic breath.
Tony rubbed the hand holding Steve along the length of his backside, stopping short before grabbing Steve’s ass. He then moved his other hand to ran through Steve’s hair as the latter continued letting out half-asleep noises.
Tony was standing at a console but had turned around to face the entrance at the same time Steve had entered.
“Fuck, Tony, I’m so close.” Steve breathed, “I love you so much.”
Tony pointed toward the general direction of his office, but Steve laughed. “I know where your office is, Tony.”
Thanos grinned once more before relaxing his face. “Greed, Mr. Rogers. Absolute greed. You’ve said it yourself: our world is becoming more destructive by the minute. Your team thinks you can save humanity by saving others with Synergy, but I
As Bruce explained, Steve increasingly felt sick to his stomach to the point that he thought he was close to throwing up from the feeling. He thought he had made progress with Tony, especially after the argument over Bucky; they shared everything and had become more than physically close. It confused him as to why Tony wouldn’t even mention the trip.
Back in the simulation, Steve noted to himself, as he helped treat people in the mobile clinic, that Tony still looked apprehensive.
Steve nodded with a yawn. “Okay, I’m a little tired, too, from working on those case files so I may relax on the couch.” And he was also tired from worrying about Tony all day.
“I’m not asking, I’m telling you.” Steve had turned slightly to face Tony. His hand was near his, and Tony could feel Steve’s warmth from it. He could sense from Steve’s stern expression that his lab mate wasn’t planning on letting up about the trip.
“Tony…” Bruce walked up to Tony who was now standing next to Steve’s bed, “…it’s not your fault…”

“…but if you want to leave, we can.” Tony offered quietly. He wanted to get to the bottom of this deal with Obadiah, but he was also weary of making Steve feel uncomfortable while doing so. However, he also knew Steve wouldn’t leave without him.
“…hey,” Steve started on the other end, “…I was…just about to call you…” He laughed quietly, but to Tony he sounded nervous.
“That was so fucking hot, baby…” Tony tried to clean himself off, but he was too spent.
“Everything all right?” Steve asked quietly as Tony approached another console.
“Is it about the buyers?” Steve asked quietly after a moment. He could feel Tony’s stress levels and was attempting not to add to it again.
“Um…,” he started, “I should probably get going…” Ending with his voice growing quieter.
obtuse.”
Tony inhaled deeply as he turned around to face Steve. “So—and I won’t be offended if you say no—um…” Tony started, but he struggled to articulate his thought.
