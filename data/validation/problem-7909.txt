“I’ll get angry about it again next time we have a fight,” Tony quips, and Steve rolls his eyes. “Granted I’m alive for us to fight again.”
“It’s a recreational simulator I’ve been working on,” Tony explains. Steve looks over at him, and there’s so much raw, naked wonder on his face, that Tony has to look down.
“I’ve made the wise decision to become a hermit for a while.”
“Do you know why I’m dying?”
“It’s all that matters,” Tony answers honestly. “I’m not going to force something like this on someone who doesn’t want it.”
But he does
“The Levonoians were right. They did accidentally activate it. I’m not an expert on nuclear devices, but I’d wager my entire bank account that if we try to move it – tractor beam, transporter – it’ll blow from destabilization.”
“I’ll manage to forgive you,” he decides as he's saying it, making Steve reel back in surprise. “Don’t think it won’t take some groveling, some decent pizza. Some letting me win at Mario Cart. Oh, or letting me win at wrestling. My ego could
“Finished what?” Steve asks cautiously, folding himself down on the couch across from Tony.
Jocular tone aside, he’s not kidding. He sometimes lets himself feel a wave of small regret about the ending result of their living arrangements. Traditionally, the CMO and Chief Engineer share a bathroom and outer living quarters. However, Bruce’s race requires a little more precaution than most, requiring specific room sizes, reinforcements, and assurances at lack of disruption during sleep due to a biological and physiological reaction to being provoked or angered.
“They’re…Do you know what elves are?”
“I could set some for you,” Tony proposes, and Steve laughs. “Hey, I’m serious, I’m great at setting fires, on purpose and on accident, just ask DUM-E or U or most of the Middle East, it’s my—”
“Hey, it doesn’t necessarily have to be propaganda. You don’t need to admit who you are. I’m sure they’d enjoy your muscles and reflexes in the actual war.”
“It’s just—” Steve says suddenly, then stops. He groans lightly, and rubs a hand over his face, before muttering, “You have standards for yourself, Steve.”

Tony hits his Starfleet insignia. “Stark to Bridge.”
So yeah, not
He thinks of the Vulcan genes that have allowed him to skip sleep, skip meals, and invent life-saving devices.
Tony has joined the away team because the transporter had been malfunctioning – again – and so a shuttle had to be taken, despite the shuttles being in the middle of software upgrades. Tony is sure – positive – that the shuttle will still perform adequately to get the team back to the ship with no errors, but Steve had insisted he come along, just in case of malfunctions.
“Oh,” he says. “I’m making a list of everything I left behind, to catalog what I want to do and who I want to see when I get back. That kind of thing.”
“Well, what do you think? Should I have gone for it, experienced it with her? Died knowing? Or was I right to wait until I was sure death was off the table to try for a relationship?”
“Tony,” he interrupts. He wasn’t even sure what Tony was going on about, something about skipping the sixties since it was no longer relevant and didn’t want to introduce some words to Steve’s vocabulary. “Do you have a gym?”
It’s light, incredibly light, and Tony is once again hit with a surge of longing for vibranium – if only he could make the

and it must work, because Peter’s eyes widen, and he nods rapidly.
He wipes his mouth, because there actually was a fair bit of saliva and even with great kissing it’s weird if you spend any energy at all to think about it.
No, because that would be easier.
Steve’s mind flicks to magazines, the Internet, CNN. “You sure about that?”
“Basic bitch, I like it,” Tony says, then rolls his eyes at whatever face Steve is pulling. “No offense meant. It’s a saying.”
He mostly said it to embarrass her, and is caught off guard by the look of surprise that quickly crosses her face before she masks it.
So he does nothing.
“Right,” Steve says, slowly. “Right. Well. I have something for you, curtesy of SHIELD.”
“Break what to me, Mr. Coulson?” Steve repeats. He’s breathing nice and normal, and he doesn’t look panicked, but definitely tense, and Tony inches for the briefcase at his feet. He notices Steve’s eyes catch it, even though he doesn’t know Tony, so it shouldn’t mean anything to him.
Tony wonders who said that. He has been anything but since joining the ship, so it was most likely someone speaking from assumptions based on his media-heavy life before, instead of someone who knows him well now. Or there could be someone on the ship he knew from before. Or someone trying to sabotage his new relationship with the Captain.
“What, Cap?”
Steve had ignored him, and Tony had walked out, muttering.
“Mr. Coulson,” the woman barks into her walkie talkie. A real walkie talkie, Jesus. “What’s happening?”
There’s a woman who is entering his lab – really, Pepper, you had to give her the access code – who Tony doesn’t recognize. She’s pretty, like,
He picks up a piece of bacon, and tries to look politely interested instead of wildly out of place.
“And I’m not going to act like I find that fine,” Tony responds, still looking at his computer.
Tony’s eyes find Steve’s, unwittingly, and Steve’s staring back, unrepentant, and yes, that’s right – they never really talked about that.
“Duly noted.”
He asked Steve about it once, and Steve just kind of smiled, said, “You haven’t seen my angry setting.”
“Didn’t you say this was my choice?” Steve asks Coulson.
He tapped the Starfleet insignia still pinned to his breast.
“The coding

“There’s very little that she appreciates about me, let’s get that straight.”
Steve grabs the book right of his hands, which,
“Yes,” Tony snaps. “That’s it. That’s why the, the not pursuing Pepper, though she may have let me, and the, and the—”
Tony stands up. He’s oddly subdued, none of his normal energy.
If he knew the actual day, he would’ve written the date down, maybe wrote it in red on his pin-up calendar, or set up one of those recurring date notices on his phone – just something, anything, to mark down in unalterable pen that
“I would assume it was deliberate. I am not sure yet what is causing it, so I am not sure if I can get it back.”
Week two, things started to shift a bit.
“Not particularly comforting that’s so common they have a standardized form for it, is it?” Tony joked. The ends of Steve’s mouth curve, but he’s too sullen to let it permanently form.
Tony’s not usually people’s first choice. Except for actual People magazine, he’s been their first choice like seven times. But real people, for friendship? No.
“Tony. I’m not going to apologize for telling him.”
Tony pulls out a wine glass from the bar, and a wine bottle follows. “Why the choice?” Tony asks.
Tony is Steve’s only option for a friend, but that doesn’t mean Steve would actually be able to
Is he going to let a character flaw lose his life, when he can stop it? Is he going to let pride take everything from him – and for no reason?
“Okay.” Steve’s still watching him like he’s waiting for something, and Tony’s feeling dizzy and not up for following this conversation, so he just says, “I’m sorry, what’s the issue?”
He doesn’t get a straight answer about the arc reactor (he keeps getting redirected to a SI press release), but he does get a laundry list of technological advancements, a staggering amount of academic achievements, a surprisingly absent list of girlfriends, and more and more and more that has Steve blinking in surprise.
Tony bets he’s been reading his news feed on his phone. He’s so proud.
“Mr. Stark.” Ah, Agent Coulson, then. Tony puts his feet up on his desk and presses the whiskey to his head, closing his eyes. The cool glass actually feels nice. “Good to hear you.”
Steve wakes up for the third time in seven decades.
“You’re really going to stay?” Tony’s voice isn’t wavering. Always brave, he was.
“Just checking in,” he says, which means
And so Tony came, and agreed to join the Captain in his walk while the science team worked.
The moment they park, Tony heads down to his workshop with a quick mention that there’s no need for Steve to follow him, he has something to do tonight.
“Tony!”
Tony steps back, but doesn’t let go of Steve’s hand. “It’ll be worse when I go. You realize that, right? On both of us. It’ll be harder on both of us.”
“That it’s fine, it’s over!”
The air is still, the collective held breath of the crew quieting the room.
“Another,” Steve says.
Something in Tony winces, and he hopes it doesn’t come out on his face. “Amazingly enough, that’s not really a compliment,” he says, trying to keep his tone light.
"Commander Stark,” the intercom crackles. “Would you please come to my quarters? I have business to discuss with you.”
He really, really doesn’t want to be noticed, but he really, really wants Steve to have a good time, so he finally lets Steve choose, and he’ll deal with the consequences.
“That’s a waste of his talents—”
“Oh.” He looks away from Doom, some of the pleasant-adrenaline draining from his body. “I didn’t think of that."
“A dinner plate,” Tony repeats.
It has the ability to break him oh so easily.
“So, our screens are better. So is pretty much everything, I wager. What other observations do you got for me?”
“If we’re actually going to be friends, there’s something you should know, actually.”
The plan is fairly simple – Steve and he will dock on the shuttle in their bay, where Clint will wait as look out and for quick departure. Steve will lead Tony to the weapons bay and leave him there. Steve will find his own way to the bridge. When he arrives at the bridge, Tony would press the button on the weapon’s bay door, requesting access inside.
. I am trying to make you CEO!”
Tony, a little bewildered and mostly still half-asleep, doesn’t really take that for the signal it obviously is that Steve wants something, and instead walks forward, and tries to elbow him out of the way.
Tony turns. He stares at Steve, at the defiant look in his eyes, his posture screaming
He blocks the bond, after that.
and slams it on the table. “Knock it off.”
“What is that?” Steve asks. He leans forward, a hand coming up towards the armor. Tony steps forward, and lets Steve touch the arm.
Tony probably doesn’t want him to, but honestly, he doesn’t care. Tony makes it almost impossible to care for him - he gives everything and refuses to accept anything, and it’s honestly more emotionally taxing than if he leaned his whole life on Steve’s shoulders. Steve’s always been a giver, a fixer. And he knows Tony is too, but Steve doesn’t - or hopes he doesn’t - shy away from needing someone quite like Tony does. He knows it’s not intentional, but it makes him feel disposable, unimportant. Like he truly is just a roommate, someone Tony is putting up with just to be a nice guy.
Tony buckles his seatbelt, the reaches to the console for where the earpiece is hanging. He fits it in his ear, idly cataloguing Steve and Clint both arriving behind him.
“Then you go ahead and fly to the roof,” Steve says, trying not to let his irritation seep through. “I will be going to the basement.”
He wonders without really thinking about it if it’s partly because he already accepted death when he pointed the plane to the ground. If his brain already processed and accepted death, that this isn’t being treated in his head as a continuation of his old life, but instead something brand new, a different place where he hasn’t lost anything.
Then? Pandemonium.
“I doubt it is ‘small stuff’ to that tortonia,” he says.
Respect isn’t like Rome.
century warhead files last night.
Steve looks around the room. No one’s there, but that’s probably not going to last.
they had cried.
“Yeah,” he says, patting her on the head. “Me too.”
He’s seated in front of the space heater he made out of spare parts in the middle of the night. He likes the armor, but not enough to sleep in it.
“Come on,” Tony says, “help me tie him up.”
Tony goes to put it in the reactor – the moment of truth – when he feels a hand on his shoulder. He looks back over, and there’s Steve.
okay?” Tony repeats in disbelief. “You just tried to catch the Iron Man armor falling at like, forty miles an hour, you idiot! Are
“The ship, the Avenger,” Steve confirms. “Not that I spent a lot of time wondering about what I’d think in my final thoughts, but I guess I assumed it would be something back in the past.” He shrugs, or as best as he can. “Guess I’ve rebuilt more of my life here than I realized.”
He is led to a frankly astoundingly large crop of something or other – grass-like, tall, with a bulbous ending, and a clear pollination method in the middle of the stem. They sway in the sweet air, and, at first, there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary.
be the one asking
"So, SHIELD has finally gotten around to giving me a bit of grief over our relationship."
He thinks about the nuclear warhead, sent by humans long ago, too stupid to understand that their actions may have consequences far beyond what they would live to see.
Steve just nods and swallows visibly. “Yeah,” he says. “Yeah. I know what that feels like.”
The Flualli raises their left foot this time, then makes a purposeful squawk, before turning and leaving.
“Tony.”
She’s busy, so it only happens three times – but each time he gets blazingly drunk afterwards. She’s sweet, because she’s always sweet, but there’s such an undercurrent of worry there.
“How long before it blows on its own?” Steve asks.
“Bye guys,” he says, and flies through the hole.
part when Tony plops down next to him.
“I’ve already seen that,” Steve says, and Tony files that away in a little folder in his head labeled Things I Know About Steve.
“Tony,” Steve says seriously. “I was thinking. I’d like an animal.”
“These are a lot of declarative sentences,” Tony says, crossing his arms. “Not a lot of them are actually accurate.”
“Amazingly enough, that’s not my greatest accomplishment, but yes. That’s me.”
But he’s most of the way through his whiskey, his list is up on his computer screen, and there’s an invite to a Stark Expo in a few months that has been on his desk all day, and he’s had to ask himself the honest question if he’s going to be alive to see it in order to reply positively, and everyone has their threshold for how many harsh realities they can face in a day, and Tony doesn’t want to even come close to touching his limit.
Steve looks at Tony with such a grave intensity that Tony kind of wants to hop over the couch and hide in the kitchen until this conversation is over with. The intensity ends after a moment, and Steve nods to himself.
“I do not know, sir,” JARVIS answers unhelpfully.
The Flualli is holding something behind their back, which Tony only notices when they pull it from behind. It looks like some sort of food – berries, maybe, or some sort of equivalent to it.
if you take the time to know them, to find what makes them tick. And getting to understand Steve, getting to that right answer, getting the equal signs to balance, feels like more of accomplishment than maybe anything since JARVIS.
“Yeah.” Steve sets his shoulders back. “I’ve been preparing for it to look different. I’m ready.”
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” says Tony. He gestures out the window showing the large expanse of space – millions of stars are in this galaxy, dozens of planets, and it’s a tapestry of
“No,” Steve interrupts. “It tastes like literal motor oil.”
But now that he’s concentrating on his physicality, it’s – well, there’s a lot to notice.
To Tony’s slight disappointment, Steve reaches over and taps the PADD on the table in front of him, and the song that was just beginning – more piano than brass this time – abruptly stops.
Steve glares at him, and ignores the carton Tony’s holding out, why is he so
“Or guilt,” Tony says, far more honest than he’d usually be. “I don’t know, Steve. If you have the chance to save lives, to lay down your life for someone else’s, and you don’t, isn’t that on you? Haven’t you ever felt like that?”
Steve looks up and sends him a purposeful, happy grin, before laughing to himself, muttering something, and then jumping.
“Therapy can be good,” Steve encourages. His hand is still on Tony’s shoulder, and he curls his fingers slightly, so he’s clutching at Tony’s shoulder.
“Tony, what’s wrong?”
In the end, and Tony is forever embarrassed by the fact, it's bureaucracy that outs him.
“Can you just,” Tony rolls his hand in the air, like he can magically rewind time. “Maybe start from when it went off plan?”
He opens the door to the small room.
“Barnes?” Tony asks, which Steve confirms with a nod. “Why would you say that?”
“What are you poking at?” Steve asks, motioning to his phone.
“Sure,” Tony laughs, patting him on the shoulder. Bruce looks up from the tricorder and catches his eye, real relief in his smile, and then continues his examination.
“The nothing,” Tony interrupts. “Parker, we’ll talk later. I’ll meet you in the bay in a bit, okay?”
“Them’s the brakes, kid.”
“Okay, Tony,” she says. “I also wanted to let you know that I am sending someone over for you to interview.”
“Hey,” he shouts, making sure to amplify the armor’s speakers. “You still up there?”
“You have yet to learn how to suppress the disadvantages from your mother’s genes,” Obadiah had said blandly. Matter of fact. “You still show signs of humanism. The amount of times I have seen you show emotion—” Obadiah had shook his head, obviously remembering when Tony had yelled at his father for leaving him out in the desert to find his own way back as a strengthening exercise, or when he had smiled wide at his mother’s gift of an old, 21
He was standing near the back, swallowed in the crowds of those coming to pay respects to the great Stark’s life accomplishments. In the middle stood the funeral pillar, a 34-meter blank white pillar that they projected a bulleted list of life accomplishments. Slightly to the left and about 84 feet down, was a simple, half oval shaped rock, where only the words
“For the best,” Steve repeats.
Steve grinds his feet in the dirt, stands with his shoulders back and chin up, and refuses to move. He’s more stubborn than a mule, and Tony’s met some asses in his day.
Currently, the USS Farragut was 2.1 days closer to the planet. Why contact the Avenger?
The Iron Man suit looks cool when going on, sue him for wanting to show off a little bit.
“Commander Stark to bridge.”
Tony isolates himself in the engine room. It’s not difficult to do; the engines are wide and expansive, the room even more so, and there’s always something to tinker with, something to improve, and something to hide behind.
“Really,” Tony confirms. He can feel Steve’s forehead press against his neck, and he raises a hand to cradle Steve’s, starting to play with the small hairs there. “Who else?”
That night, Tony finds out Steve was an artist. That night, Tony also finds out that pairing an artist with an engineer and enough legos to fill the entire living room and unlimited time means ending up with a wall-sized Mona Lisa whose arms are actually functional with a rudimentary joint system that means she can pick up and pour cups of coffee with moderate success.
“I know,” Tony says slowly. “He stopped by to see me.”
“Your version of needing the war,” Steve muses quietly.
Well, fuck that. It’s better to burn out than fade away. He might as well do something real, tangibly helpful. Isn’t that what his second chance is supposed to be about – not wasting his life? Making it mean something, to someone? Having a purpose beyond destruction, even of himself?
“Wow,” he says, right as Tony as finishing the explanation of the stored data banks of languages and cultural norms that the HUD can display, helping fix diplomacy errors in real time. “It’s inventions like that that make me remember I really have time traveled to the future.”
And even with the expansions, even with the divisions, even with the changes of pace – still, weapons sold.
“Tony, don’t joke about this—”
He’s most of the way through the next iteration of his personal flying armor, his personal
“Tony—” Steve’s voice is tight and uncontrolled, and Tony’s never heard that tone from him before – not with the Kree, not when starting a dangerous mission, not in the video of him waking. Not scared. Never scared.
“He’s in danger. You need to beam him up, now.”
They force his hands together and are completely unable to be taken off without a 14 digit passcode – they also are connected to some kind of device that means Doom physically can’t stray more than five feet from whoever is holding the device.
let me tell you.”
“Do you want to go to the aquarium with one of them instead?” Tony asks, ‘cause he’s really trying with this friendship thing, and sometimes that means
Steve looks up to the ceiling and shakes his head. After a moment, he jerks his head around. He meets Tony’s confused gaze squarely.
Clint exhales.
His eyes are starting to water, so he just reaches a hand up to them, presses down hard, and lets himself take comfort in Steve’s quiet presence, ignoring the swirling of his stomach.
“I wasn’t going to explore it,” Tony says during his explanation. “Philosophy and ethics were never my thing. But then there was you – a problem I could fix.”
“Just as well,” Steve shrugs. “I’m kind of glad you didn’t get to know me from a textbook.”
Steve glances up. There is a moment of breathless silence, deliberation, and then he reaches out, curling a hand around Tony’s jaw. He leans in, then pauses, just long enough to hear Tony’s intake of breath, to meet his eyes, and then he leans in, and presses their mouths together.
He doesn’t realize the first day he doesn’t think about it.
Broadly true, but never verbalized. She is first officer for a reason – observational skills are a must.
Tony takes another spoonful of oatmeal.
“North Atlantic Ocean.” Tony feels absolutely ridiculous in his puffy orange parka. And it takes a lot to make him feel any type of shame, but this actually manages. “You didn’t
“Yeah. That whole thing about people going off to war so you marry them before you really know them, and then in the 1950s you end up with all these housewives who sort of want to commit manslaughter and these men who hide at work so they don’t have to face the emptiness of their hallow lives.”
“Jump, Steve.” Steve hesitates, looking at it with more trepidation than a gallon of water deserves. “C’mon, Steve. When are you going to get the chance to jump into a rain puddle again? It’s not very Captain-like. But I won’t tell.”
“How does it—” Steve stops suddenly, and looks around Tony’s arm. “Tony, is there something black on your neck?”
“Tony,” Steve says, trying to stay amicable. “What have you been up to the past hour?”
Or his t’hy’la, who has also become his best friend.
“Omelets,” Tony answers.
He waffles for a while about how to bring Steve back.
“That’s private,” Tony interrupts. His whole body feels strangely hot. “Please stop.”
“Yes, you will,” Tony laughs, eyes still on WALL-E. “In like eighty years.”
And Iron Man – the magnum opus of the intersection of math and art. It’s his. It’s his alone. It won’t be used as a weapon. It won’t be used for logical means. It’ll be used for his whims. His wants. His desires. His art. His
“Good.”
Tony frowns. “I’m sorry?”
He figures he should probably be feeling grief. He’s lost more than probably any other person in history – his home, his culture, his friends, his life, his understanding of life. It’s like it’s too much for his brain to truly process, so instead of wallowing in the tragedy of it, his thoughts shy away from all thoughts, leaving him alone in the quiet of the penthouse.
“I have been thinking lately that maybe I should look at getting a job,” Steve says, and Tony moves to shut down the computer – this is probably going to be a long conversation. He leans back in his chair, spinning slightly, and gives his full attention over.
“Tony, this has been five minutes of agonizing embarrassment. Do you like me or no?”
“Hey, don’t go breaking my heart,” Tony says. Then, because he just
Compounded with the fact that apparently Tony did, in fact, quit his own company, people have a lot to speculate about.
The mask retracts, and there’s Tony, and to Steve’s mild surprise, with a large smile on his face.
Mostly because he’s bored, slightly because any idiot could calculate, given Cap’s last known coordinates, the plane’s weight, direction, speed, trajectory, and all those fun math details he can do without thinking, that they’re several miles off from the most likely place to find him. Their way will take several more outings, at least, if they even find him. At this pace, it’s more likely some Russian Oil Team will just stumble on it. That is, if there’s anything to even find.
Tony looks worried, and something in Steve’s throat wants to close up, his stomach starting to spin, and this is
so he just rethinks his strategy. He can't get Steve to move, to change, to open up, especially at first. He eventually asks JARVIS to write out summaries of all their interactions, and Tony takes notes like he's back in grad school.
Tony crouches down next to the unconscious Hammer. “Oh my God, you broke his jaw too.”
So what’s the point of trying?
He taps the reactor, twice, and settles down in a chair in-front of the biggest desktop.
“What was that?”
“He’s made for me. He’s specifically coded to my needs, my wants, to know exactly what I’m implying or wanting or needing, to anticipate my—”
Coulson nods.
If partnership had been some great, untouchable dream of his, this was unfathomable. Unattainable. Or, apparently more accurately, unretainable.
It wasn’t Maria’s fault either.
IRON MAN: RECOMMENDED
Steve reaches a hand out towards the sky, slowly turning his palm up, and his face breaks out into an incredulous, beautiful smile as he feels the raindrops hit, hit, hit his hand.
“The Asgardian,” Captain Rogers supplies, and Romanoff smiles at him, just a little, which is a good sign for him.
“It’s around,” Steve repeats. His teeth grind together. “It’s around?”
Two boxes, however, seem to have something complete in them, and Tony’s standing over them, staring.
“Come on, Pepper, I would have called you to kick him out of it was that.”
“How do you know what type of paint was used in order to curate the cleaning solution?” Tony asks, fascinated.
“It isn’t the war; it has to do with the fact that I’m not going to get better! Not wanting to be around isn’t—”
Hope you enjoyed!
“Doth my ears deceive me?”
long distance, and I just want to make sure all your molecules are where they are supposed to be.”
He places his forehead on Steve’s and closes his eyes.
Steve’s in the doorway, looking as unhappy as Tony feels right now.
“Yes,” Steve confirms, frankly edging onto bewildered.
“Sorry,” Tony apologizes, reaching for a tissue from the box on his desk. “I’m allergic to most orders of flowers.”
“Fine, Cap. Just had a disappointing lab session. Nothing unexpected.”
But as he beats the punching bag, he has no thoughts, and he purposefully pushes away any of the feelings of regret or shame.
Steve’s staring at him like he has the answers to the goddamn universe, his eyes slowly widening and a smile starting to build into a full-fledged grin. He reaches forward to take Tony’s hand, which Tony lets him – and some part of him, some base part, is going,
“Did you
It speaks to their lives that Tony hadn’t even been aware that that had happened.
Tony tenses momentarily, and then stuffs his mouth with a lot of noodles. When he swallows, it honestly looks like it hurts. “Yeah,” he confirms. “Was checking to see what it was made out of, what it could do. Turns out it was a combination of - well, it doesn’t matter. Known elements. Nothing revolutionary. I can’t do anything with it.”
“What does that even mean?”
“Commander Romanoff let me lead engineering bay for the journey to Corons VI to pick you up!” He bounces again. “I didn’t break anything, I swear. Though I didn’t really understand the expansion you put on the warp drive—”
“You. What is my time to your life?”
Here’s what Tony says: “I can agree to that.”
“That’s a historical artifact,” Coulson protests weakly. “You just blasted a hole into—”
And Tony had thought:
“I’m not going to let you die.”
“A good thing,” Tony states, and means it. He assesses Steve. “You seem – calm.”
There are more people in transporter bay than is really required for the occasion.
“Your nonchalance act doesn’t fool me,” Steve says with a smile, and damn him. “I know you’re happy about this.”
He can, which still doesn’t feel like an accomplishment.
Tony knows what happened to Bucky. Steve told him one night, on a whim. Tony had been uncharacteristically upset by some event he went to. An old girlfriend (Sunrise? Sunset? Something.) was there, and eventually Steve pried out of him that Tony hadn’t been able to keep more than one steady friend in his whole life.
“But still disappointing?” Steve says sympathetically.
“You know,” Tony says conversationally. “I gave up my CEO position to keep you company.”
“Unashamed is, though,” he counters, and winks at her.
“Have you considered going back into the army?” Tony asks, and Steve snorts without thinking.
He thinks about Steve holding his hand.
“What kind of debris?” Steve asks.
“Well,” she says, after a moment. “It’s been about a month since you decided – to go your new direction. I wanted to give you the time off without annoying you, because God knows you needed some time to relax. But I wanted to check in and see if you still—”
“What kind? Retail? Cashiering? Biking to stop cancer?”
“Sure, whatever.” Coulson reaches out, and Tony takes a step back. “I don’t like to be handed things. Put them on the table.”
Tony grins.
“You don’t
“Sir,” JARVIS starts.
“That’s not
“I am a men, Steve,” Tony says. He can feel his face contort – way to be eloquent, Stark. “I mean, you do know that, right?”
“Our new Captain is beaming on today,” Bruce says, through a large bite of toast.
It’s interesting.
“Of course. In the end. I do have to voice my strenuous objection to Mr. Stark,” Coulson says, which deeply offends Tony. “He is no way capable of—”
century Earth computer, or when he had cried as a child when he was bullied into a broken arm. “If you have sense, you will perform kolinahr and purge yourself. You must take your father’s place, and it is not the business’s fault that you have human blood.”
It wears on a person, which Steve is intimately aware of.
Tony is nervous.
“Are you more human or Vulcan?” Sterok had said. The knife glinted in the double sun. “Let’s see if you bleed red.”
With a quick hand, Tony grabs the thick particle accelerator manual he’d been reading last night, then steps around the kitchen counter so he’s facing Steve. Leaning forward, he pokes him with the book.
“What about what I change? Won’t the timeline—”
You think their parents just
Steve’s been reading up on Tony. Or, more accurately, asking JARVIS. Steve tried the Internet first, like Tony suggested, but so much of it was nothing he wanted to know. Women that Tony had dated, outfits he wore, public appearances at media events. Most of the articles of substance seemed to be speculative in nature and that just doesn’t sit right with Steve, especially after the one he read that said Tony would be more likely to kick a homeless man than let him stay in his house. Steve’s living proof that that’s bullshit, so he closes it out and asks JARVIS to give him a summary of Tony’s life.
Steve stops aside Tony, eyes sweeping side to side.
It’s just –
” he demands. “Someone on this ship is – is a friend, a brother, a lover to you, has a mind so perfect for yours that there are
Here’s what Tony says: “We can do that.”
Tony makes to step off the platform, but Steve gestures for him to wait. Tony obliges. “Could you at least send me the database of cultural diplomacy? I still don’t know enough about all the types of aliens yet, and that could be a large help.”
As it stands, what’s he going to tell her? He needed a roommate for rent money? He’s a boyfriend that won’t go away? He’s a homeless dude Tony took pity on?
“Agent! What do I owe the honor?”
“I wish you could come,” Steve says, as they’re preparing the machine.
“I don’t even know why I am keeping it a secret! JARVIS, remind me.”
“A job may be premature,” Tony says. “How about just doing
“We don’t need a play-by-play—” Steve weakly tries.
“Hey Tony,” Steve says. Tony can feel him press a kiss onto the top of his head.
“You—” Steve swallows. “You can send me back before Bucky died?”
And so, in the 7.3 minutes Captain Rogers spends in engineering, Tony stays mute on the subject.
T’Quan was the only Vulcan that Tony could remember that regularly dyed her hair. Perhaps T’Prynn, for all she showed no interest in him, had something for the unconventional types.
“Oops,” Steve says, utterly deadpan.
If a psychologist ever heard that one, and what age he first thought it, they might be shocked into silence. But he hasn’t seen one, so he doesn’t know.
“I’ve killed.” He picked at the cuticle of his thumb, a nervous tick he adopted from watching Jarvis interact with his father. “My life means little in wake of that.”
Okay, so he may be slightly embarrassed of his past self’s fanboy qualities. At least he doesn’t currently have any of the merchandise.
“I’m sorry,” he apologizes to Pepper, making both their heads snap to him. “I didn’t realize I was causing problems by being here.”
in a suit, Tony.”
When he awoke the next morning, he deleted the letter.)
was months of work,” Hammer says, pissed, then hastily corrects, “Was probably months.”
, the Holodeck, the Simulatornator – for when he pitched it to Starfleet, but there was bound to be bugs in the first several (hundred) versions.
He’s already broken. He doesn’t need to shatter.
“My girl Friday, maybe, but she’d probably object to that.”
What?
Steve considers the question, really considers it. “I don’t know,” he answers honestly. “I don’t really know anything about myself anymore.”
He thinks of the Vulcan Council Library, where he taught himself all that he knows about the soft-sciences of the world.
“Oh my God,” he says the JARVIS. “That’s where the heartbeat is coming from?”
of plates on it, all full of eggs in differing stages of being cooked.
“Hey, half-breed,” one had sneered, pushing the knife to his throat.
The music blares.
“I accepted it before, you know? Not happily, but I did.” His voice is muffled by talking into his shirt. “But now, with you, I want it again. And I can’t. Because I’m not smart enough. And I have this coming, I know I do, Steve.” He looks up, so genuinely upset that Steve’s almost taken aback. “I have it coming. But I don’t want it. And I can’t even talk to anyone about it, because it’s a secret.”
Tony doesn’t really want to toss them, because this is the first thing Steve’s ever bought him and at risk of sounding like a children’s book, he can feel his heart growing three sizes a bit, so he makes a mental note to have JARVIS recreate a plastic version of these guys as he picks up the flowers by the stems, and unceremoniously tosses them out the open window behind him.
He can feel his throat start to clam, but swallows around it. He glances up at Steve, just for a second, before pushing the PADD back in Steve’s hand.
Steve spends a second on that one, turning it over. “No, you wouldn’t.”
He sends her off with assurances that he has Steve and he’s still inventing and he’s doing
He turns them in his palm and feels a wave of nostalgia, for missions went and missions he’d never see.
And once again, the bond blanks.
Dummy was cleaning behind him.
He can almost
And if he’s using Tony to experiment, well, that’s just Tony’s good luck.
“We can’t move it. We can’t disable it. We can’t leave it to just go off. We only have twenty minutes – we don’t have the luxury of time to try to discuss other options.”
” Steve asks. His arms are now awkwardly crossed in front of his chest, holding his elbows, but Tony is falling back into his own head, pictures of the past months flying through his head, just now with a new filter.
“Do you value your own life?” she had asked.
Nothing works.
“Go for it, JARVIS. Scan, the whole shebang. He’ll be here for a while.”
“Why?” Steve repeats, like the question is baffling.
“That’s when one of their lookout guards shot him in the back with a phaser,” Clint says. It sounds suspiciously like glee in his voice. “You should have seen it, Tony. He just turned around, looked the guy dead in the eye, walked forward, took the phaser out of the man’s hand,
“Tony,” Coulson says, so disapproving, and Tony can see Steve’s eyes have latched onto him, now. He wonders what he thinks about the reactor, clearly glowing through his shirt.
A muscle ticks in Steve’s jaw. His arms are crossed and he’s leaning far back in his chair, eyes blinking rapidly, and Tony finds himself at an unusual loss for words.
“Tony!” Hammer says. He doesn’t sound
To say – this could be great. But I won’t let it. This could be home. But I won’t let it. This could be comfort. But I won’t let it.
Steve noticeably swallows. “I guess I missed my date,” he says, trying for levity and missing it by a mile. “So everyone I know – they’re dead?”
“Mmm,” Steve mummers. He’s tapping his fingers on the bench. “I’m in there.”
He thinks of his emotions, so strong, so all-encompassing, that have made life worth it.
“What did you
Tony nods, a sort of weird one, like that’s an odd thing to say, and makes to leave. He pauses in the doorway, and Steve looks back up.
It’s been well over two months by the time Tony realizes he may have a real, actual problem beyond the black one poisoning his veins.
The car stops in front of a non-descript warehouse-looking building out in the outskirts of Greenwich village.
Whether he’s talking about the drones or the mountains of shit piled in the room, including what appears to be a half finished model of a knock off Iron Man armor hanging in the corner, Steve doesn’t know. And doesn’t care, as he feels a new sense of rage flow through him.
!” She says, almost a yell, but slightly more dignified. The folder she was holding slams down on the countertop, her hand going up to pinch the bridge of her nose once again. Steve watches her take a stabilizing breath.
He has his stubborn setting, and his convictions, and yes, he once threw a remote at the TV when Ted Cruz was speaking at some event, and yes, Tony once made a really, really dumb joke about outsourced labor that he didn’t even mean that had him sitting through a two-hour long tirade about supporting immigrants – but Steve is
“Tony,” Steve continues, ignoring him. He sounds strangely urgent. “If you have that – why are you here? Why are you alone?”
“I’m from Minnesota,” Happy responds, frowning.
Steve, for a captain, has shown remarkable curiosity in the proceedings of each division, and had asked the science department to allow him to join them on the expedition. He asked intelligent and enthusiastic – if reserved – questions, and diligently removed himself when the scientists had to focus.
“You’re making regret telling you,” Tony says. “Please drop it.”
“What’s the plan?” Steve asks. He looks over at the building. It’s surrounded by a chainlinked fence. Two doors, one on the right, one in the middle. The middle is padlocked, the right one looks open and has stairs leading to it. There appears to be a basement on the building. There’s probably rooftop access to the back left.
Tony walks up, and Steve has created a little sand enclosure for the tortonia, and looks fully content to watch the little thing walking around.
“None, sir.”
Tony steels himself, because what’s all this about, anyway – helping Steve, the man from out of time, a hero, get back to normal. He’s gotta put some effort in, right?
and it catches about six or seven of them right in the stomach, sending them flying, and then he immediately pushes Maras away and
"And they wanted you to do it—"
He comes over to the table and sits down. Steve idly moves his book to make more room for him.
Later, Tony will consider: maybe there’s something he’s missing, here. Within Steve.
“I, uh, guess—”
Both he and Coulson straighten unthinkingly.
someone Tony would ever worry about meeting in a dark alley.
Steve all but collides with him. If Tony were anything other than a Vulcan, he’d be immediately tipped over with the force of it.
“041983 is such a nice number,” Coulson says to the wall.
Which brings him back to getting there.
It's almost nice to love someone, even if it's private, even if it's unsharable.
like a man who is all friendship-is-magic pony friends with other people?”
“We found it.”
Steve has been a broken record for the entire day, and Tony’s getting a wee-bit sick of it.
He suggests Steve go without him, but Steve just looks at him strangely and says, “But then what’s the
“What are our options?” asks Coulson, but oh, but the blank calmness of his voice – he already knows, or has some idea idea. So carefully measured – always in control, but Coulson never likes to lose anyone. But he’s pragmatic. Always pragmatic before emotions. He’d make a decent Vulcan, not that Tony would ever tell him that.
“Natasha takes over as team leader. She’s best with the plans.”
Plan A is giving life a second change plan, which has him listening to JARVIS, learning of the world, reading up on Tony, catching up on what he’s missed, going outside and watching the sunset from the roof.
Just for a moment.
“Pepper’s off limits when it comes to me and her, okay? And you, if you go after her I will actually stab myself in the eye with a spoon, or something, just – do not do that, okay?”
he had just
“Yeah, probably.” Tony sends a look of longing to the machine. “It was such a masterpiece of invention, though.”
“Why would you do that?” Steve asks suddenly.
“Tony – you must have realized by now that you can only truly be one.” Obadiah had turned towards him, and Tony remembers catching his eye, catching his body language.
use this thing you just spent the last two months of your life perfecting, just for me?
They all immediately turn, facing Tony, and they rise up like a swarm of bees, and Steve can hear their guns starting to go.
“You can’t save everyone, Steve,” Tony says softly.
“Tony!” He yells. “Back in the suit, back in the
Tony shuts his eyes. Steve feels the utterly overwhelming compulsion to hug him – so he does just that, pulling him forward, and placing Tony’s head on his shoulder.
The boxes have a lot of nonsense in them. Spare parts, little parts, pieces of technology that look useless.
“On-planet,” she answers, slowly. “There was a diplomatic meeting down on Edor VIII.”
“What’s this?” Steve is apparently not in the mood for pleasantries, though he doesn’t sound angry – just impatient. He hands him a PADD, which Tony takes idly. While he’s chewing, he glances down absentmindedly, quickly scanning the highlighted text.
That is an entirely different question, and one with a far easier answer. “Yes,” Steve says. “But we don’t always get what we want.”
“We’re a matching set,” Tony says, grinning. He drops the crowbar with a clang. “I know all too much about myself.”
Steve isn’t the easiest guy to get to know, which he makes that plainly obvious early on. Even when he isn’t avoiding Tony like he’s a drunken one-night stand, he’s quiet and introverted and seems to take the saying ‘playing your cards close to your chest’ to a brand new, occasionally infuriating, level. No matter what conversation opener Tony tries, he gets little in response, just a few words, maybe a small smile if he’s lucky, and constant moving eyes sizing Tony up without saying a word.
Steve’s eyes snap to Coulson. The flit down, then up, and then snap to Tony. Tony waves, short, once, and Steve looks back at Coulson.
“Can be an insult to Vulcans, just ask my mother.” Tony offers a strained smile. “Are you ready to leave?”
“Is it easy to make you fall in love? What’s it take?”
The game ends with them losing all their shit and being virtually demolished by the computer team, which figures for how their lives are going now.
“You don’t have to come.”
It’s also edited, but not in the places Steve expects. All of his youthful exploits seem to have been kept in, as well as a long and truly painful collection of the misuse of weapons Tony designed, due to Tony’s negligence. Truly, JARVIS paints a pretty unflattering picture. So much so that Steve, one day, asks incredulously and completely without thinking he’d get a response, “Does he use his money for
Steve laughs this time, real if small. A smile plays across his lips. “Make anything fun in there?”
“Tony.”
“Do you mean you’re going down to your quarters?” she asks, which is a fair question, given they put around 7% effort into heating them, so they are marginally better than the dock, but that’s not at all what he meant.
(Here’s something he was told happened:
“Why me, dear? I’d never.”
He’s stuttering, tripping over words, falling in a way he never does. Steve’s smooth in times of trouble, collected in decision making, assured in his beliefs, but apparently, there’s a type of bravery that Steve struggles with.
“Sure.”
“Oh,” Tony says thoughtfully. “We also need to bring you up to speed on inflation.”
Tony takes a second to take him in, to catalog him, to see him.
He would not knowingly make that choice. Not even for a simulation.
"You know nothing."
Tony was not wholly unfamiliar with waking in med-bay. The monitors filled with lights he would never understand, the stale smell of disinfectant, the quiet beeps and non-stop murmurs, the aches and pains in his body, usually all paired with Bruce fretting in some corner.
He does, occasionally, have to remind the man to eat breakfast.
“And it’s probably coming up soon. And you need a forewarning so you can – I don’t know, emotionally prepare. You’ve already lost a lot of people.” Tony frowns down at his lap, probably avoiding Steve’s gaze, and Steve still feels like he has missed the final step on the stairs, that lurching feeling of falling, but he hasn’t hit the ground.
He figures Pepper’s a bridge he’ll cross when he gets there.
He’s staring at the back wall. Was Steve just that angry?
"It wasn't your fault that the spear went through my uniform, Tony."
“Nothing,” Steve says. He looks down at the ground with a somber focus that, frankly, worries Tony.
guy, okay. He apologies to Roomba when he pets her too hard, he goes out of his way to be polite to strangers, he calls people sir and ma’am on the phone, he offered to pay for a dish he broke, he is respectful, he has manners, he’s kind.
“JARVIS,” Tony asks, flinging an arm over his eyes. “Cut the noise. What’s happening?”
Apparently, Tony spiraled into reading about interdimensional travel after the Battle of New York. One road led to another led to another – “I went so far down that rabbit hole I hit the Earth’s mantle” – and he found himself with a workable theory about traveling to another dimension at a different time period.
Tony spins and spins, growing dizzy and unbalanced. He stops facing Steve, his face flushed and socks completely wet. Steve’s smiling at him, something soft on his face.
“I don’t know.” Tony picks one up and inspects it closer. “It’s a power source of some sort. I would guess it was Vanko’s duplication of the arc reactor. But it…it looks different than the others. This must have been a prototype, trying to get closer to the real one.”
“Hi there,” Tony greets. He receives a raised right foot in response, which Tony mirrors.
Steve always enjoys hand to hand combat – but he’s gotta admit, the repulsors cutting through the bots like butter sure make his job to run after Doom easier.
“Okay,” Steve agrees instantly. He’s been reading about therapy when he got to the PTSD stuff – it seems reasonable, that there’s people trained to help guide thoughts. “And what else?”
“Until we don’t have to worry about it anymore,” Steve replies. Why does he always answer dick-ish questions so seriously? It makes Tony feel like an asshole. “In whatever form that comes.”
“It is.” Steve’s watching him, anxious, confused.
He doesn’t even know how to drive.
Steve frowns. “That’s what you want your life to amount to?”
It’s easy to be together but to ignore each other when shooting shit on a television screen.
“That’s not surprising,” Steve says. He’s frowning. “If disappointing.”
“And for the private areas?”
Tony finds himself alone in his bedroom one afternoon, sifting through a pile of papers for concept designs for more green energy products.
“Come here,” Tony cuts him off. He reaches out and grabs Steve’s shirt, pulling him in, chest to chest. Tony’s always known he’s five-foot-too-goddamn-short, but this is honestly ridiculous. He’s going to have to be on his tip-toes.
“It’s one of the biggest cities in America. If I want the real nowadays culture, shouldn’t that be my first stop?” Tony isn’t sure what to say, beyond, ‘if you go there you might not think humanity was worth saving anymore,’ but Steve continues. “Plus, I read that there’s so many celebrities there that most people ignore them on the street. Isn’t that what you want?”
Tony lets out a breath, and falls back onto Steve, who is standing behind him. Steve catches him, and Tony finds himself in a strange, backwards hug.
Steve is still a thousand feet below, marveling at how high they have gotten.
He’s been avoiding going out for several reasons, and most of them point back somehow to his public image. He’s a recognizable guy, okay, it’s really hard to mask his face and looks so he’s not stopped on the street. He doesn’t want people crowding him and the paparazzi taking pictures and everyone pointing and staring because he’s been out-of-service for like two months and everyone seems to think he’s either dead or having a mental breakdown.
“You don’t have to stay here,” Tony says, closing his eye again. “You’ve more than done your civic duty keeping me company for a life-time. I think you’ve spent more time hanging out with me than anyone else in my life, probably. JARVIS, how much time have we spent together?”
“No, it is not,” his father had replied. “We do not force anyone to purchase our products. We only fulfill where there is already a need.”
“Hey hey hey,” he says. “I just heard on the news about the drone attack on the tower. I’m so relieved you’re okay, Tony.”
“It’s the best I can hope for,” Tony says, with probably too little mirth, because Steve just looks more unhappy.
There’s a hit on his arm, and Pepper’s staring at him like she might actually take a bat to his head this time.
“Nothing,” Steve interjects smoothly. “One moment.”
Despite the purpose of the trip, the next words from Coulson were some of the last Tony had expected.
It takes a moment, but Steve nods.
Tony laughs, loud and unbridled.
“I don’t know,” and great, Steve apparently just treaded on some exposed nerve on accident. “You just seemed like you had something, there.”
In deep space, Tony had been able to intercept and change the transmissions before Captain Coulson had read them. He suspected Coulson had known, but with an ever-passive face, Coulson had agreed.
Vaguely, he remembers being a CEO had a lot of responsibilities. Answering emails, meetings, overseas trips, conference calls, things to make, people to see. That probably was more of it than his brain remembers to catalog. But he also remembers being twenty-one and staying up for thirty-nine hours straight trying to get DUM-E to pick up a can without crushing it immediately.
Steve stops mid-sentence, almost awkwardly, and simply looks over at Tony.
On day 19, bright and early at 10AM, Steve is standing in-front of the coffee maker when Tony walks into the kitchen.
The last of it clicks into place. “Welcome, sir,” JARVIS greets, and Tony instantly smiles.
Iron Man is like grabbing the plane’s handles and pointing it towards the ground at an enemy base.
“I’ve know other people,” Steve interrupts. “You made me, remember? Book club? The VA? Pepper and I talk weekly on the phone!”
“Oh, right, right,” Bruce says, through a mouth of half-chewed bread. If he wasn’t so good in times of crises, Tony would seriously consider worrying that his health was in the hands of someone so absentminded. However, in the three years that he has been serving on this ship, Tony has calculated a 7.1% decrease in his own sick leave, and has noted a 13.44% smaller degree of deaths during emergency situations in comparison with the average for federation ships. He has no reason to doubt his life in Bruce’s hands.
She nods, sharp and quick, like she always is. “Lieutenant Commander Clint Barton took over my job as chief security officer,” she says, gesturing towards Barton who is standing in the corner, sleeves ripped off his uniform. Tony wonders if it’s only for the aesthetics, or if there’s an actual reason.
“Nothing.” Steve shakes his head, and Tony looks back down at his tablet. “I guess it’s just nice to hear people are in love.”
“Because…I want to?”
in bed. And not just carnal desire, no, not a release driven by some kind of pent up frustration.
people understand it, so maybe it’s not him being stupid.
In retrospect, he probably shouldn’t have told Pepper via text.
“Essentially.”
Steve spins. “How does it not
“Stressful,” she answers, and he can hear it in her voice. “Why is the board more concerned with your disappearance than they are with the company? No one even opened their binder about the company’s new values and direction launch. There were important things in there, about re-management, expanding the technology factories and facilities, hiring new software engineers, what to do with all of the weapons experts on hire—”
His heart aches.
“Where am I?” he says, and hello, deep voice.
“At my place,” Tony buts in. “You can pick your room. And job. If you want a job. You can sit around on your ass all day, I don’t really give a shit.”
He was pretty proud of himself for remembering that Howard was in that in the first place, and feels a stab of
She’s a fast typer, apparently, even given her long nails, and when he ignores her calls, she spams his phone worse than the fake IRS wanting financial compensation.
“Do you want to try?”
“—Guards of the slaves arrived. I was watching from my sniper spot and was
“Director Coulson,” he corrects, and Tony makes a show of rolling his eyes. “Good to see you, Commander Stark. Now that all the senior officers are present, I need to debrief you about a problem in the Levonos system.”
Great, pity. Just what he came in here looking for. “Oh, feeling good. Birds flying high, I know how they feel. Sun in the sky, I know how they feel. All that jazz. Being on a walking path towards your cell in hell is the dandiest time.”
“No goodbyes,” he interrupts. “None of that. Just – good luck.”
butterfly effect—”
when Tony says, “Now that you’re staying – do you want to go to dinner with me? I’m bad at dates, but I’ve been reliably informed by the Internet and my memories of movies that came out in the 90s that that’s a pretty standard first date thing. Though I was pretty wasted most of the 90s, so, who knows.”
He’s found his compromise.
“They were in the debriefing I was given. Along with hundreds of other species,” he says, tone only a touch bitter. “But Vulcans were first contact, so they featured a lot. Your personal debrief mentioned you’d be a bit different, but—”
The beams glow as the molecules coalesce into a person, a tall person, and – the beams disappear, the transporter powering down, and a humanoid remains.
The Worra sector was infamous for its brutality, constant warfare, and slave trade. The Federation had no jurisdiction in the quadrant, nor extradition, which spelled bad news for the unfortunate Orion Starfleet Officer, Maras, who had been extraordinarily unlucky with where her shuttle chose to make a crash landing.
The only person he ever was able to be around without substantial, concentrated effort was Bucky, and that was more because Bucky had decided at some point to keep Steve no matter what, and there was nothing Steve could do to dissuade him.
“Of course I do, dipshit,” Tony snaps. He’ll feel bad about that later, he’s sure, he's just really fucking rattled. “You really think I spend
“Coulson,” Tony greets when the turbolift opens, pleasantly surprised. “What brings you as a giant head on our tele-screen?”
“I’m sure she appreciated that.”
Steve smiles a little, then admits, “I just don’t know what to do with myself. You were right, at least in a way. It’d be easier if there was a battle to jump back into. I want to make the world better, but when there isn’t an obvious enemy, I don’t know what to do. My time in the tower feels wasted. Any job requires too much interaction with people, and I don’t have any modern skills. I’d like to dedicate my life to something that makes me feel useful, but if God would only tell me
“I’ve run the math sir,” and great, now JARVIS sound sniffy with him. “There is no way without compromising the structural integrity of the floor and ice sheet below us.”
Somehow, that doesn’t make Steve feel any better.
“If this doesn’t work,” Steve says. “I won’t give up.”
“A tragedy. You’re honestly a tragedy. Shakespeare quality. Someone is going to grab your skull and monologue sadly at it, one day.”
Something icy is starting to spread through Steve.
"I will," Tony had replied, meaning it in that moment.
Tony chooses to eat breakfast in here for this precise reason.
“A very long time?” Steve repeats. “How long is very long?”
Meaning he accidentally lit the entire science wing on fire experimenting with lightning and was currently attempting to minimize damages.
“No, we’re getting some equipment—”
That’s right – Tony always forgets, but Steve would have most likely had first-hand experience when those were still being used as ‘peacekeeping’ devices.
“Not what I asked, Cap,” Tony interrupts. “Would you rather be back in the 1940s?”
What follows it he most excruciatingly complicated five hours of Steve’s life. He feels like being sent to bootcamp all over again, where he’s always two steps behind. He’s able to understand the big events well enough – made a big bomb and dropped it, didn’t fight with Russia but it was tense, terrorists are a global worry now, everything has gotten bigger and better and louder, inflation has skyrocketed, global communication is in a great state, lingo has changed a bit, women have more rights but not enough, black people have more rights but not enough, gay people have more rights but not enough – this was the look of the 70s, this was the look of the 80s, this was the look of the 90s. The world continues and the years pass, and on and on it spins.
“Okay,” Tony says cautiously. “Didn’t mean to press buttons.”
“I do my research on my men, Tony.”
“Okay, careful, there’s a lot of shit on the ground.”
Jarvis had looked down at Tony with kind eyes, and said, “No, young sir. They did not.”
“Personal assistant?” Steve suddenly realizes he actually has no idea what Tony does.
“Did you know, in war, there was this whole culture of getting married fast?”
For the most part, Tony enjoys the seclusion. After a life of constant company, he has learned how to enjoy himself again.
“Why. You’re you. And then the kidnapping. It hasn’t been a week, Stark. You shut down your weapons division, signed over the rest of the company, got that
Tony turns from the window. “Thanks, Steve. I don’t think I ever said that to you.”
How calming to know that no matter what he’s done, no matter what’s happening to him, there’s millions and millions and billions and trillions of
Steve places his arms underneath Tony’s, wrapped around his waist, like he’s a good two feet shorter than he actually is, with his face kind of smashed up against where Tony’s shoulder meets his neck. His hair is sort of getting in Tony’s mouth, but it feels so damn good – the strength of it, the concern of it, the emotion of it, that Tony just gripes back tighter, clutching with all the strength he can afford to give, twisting his fingers into the back of Steve’s uniform shirt. He’s solid and real and there and they’re both
“What’s your favorite thing to eat?” Tony asks out of nowhere.
Steve already knows Tony’s personality about as well as he could, but he never really noticed anything about his appearance before. He’s a guy, brown hair, brown eyes. Kind of short. On and off with the glasses. Once, when passing him the remote, Steve noticed a lot of callouses on his fingers.
“You look rather rotten,” he says frankly.
“The only thing that was even slightly impressive was the arc technology in the drones. And that wasn’t even you, was it? It was Vanko’s technology. I recognized it from the schematics I was given after he was arrested.”
amused, and could see Natasha hiding behind the slaver’s house, looking like she didn’t know what to do—”
Tony asks, a hand still on the door. “It's—” he looks to his watch. “11:30
"Apparently they've been wanting an agent to secretly tail you for ages. Write a report of you - what you're really like, personality traits, how you respond to stress, how you work with others. Other stuff."
The numbers flash inside his HUD, and no shit it’s slow. It’s not-really-alive type slow. A I’ve-been-put-in-a-medically-induced-coma-and-I’m-not-coming-back-out slow.
One positive of the reactor, it seems.
Everything has halted. Distantly, he hears himself reply, “Stark is the Vulcan name. S and ends with K, fairly generic. Tony’s the human part.”
Steve comes back from the bathroom and settles back down onto the couch. He gives Tony a smile, and says, “Start again?”
“JARVIS,” he asks. “Will you lead me to Tony?”
Tony stares at him, hope coursing through his veins.
He’s not proud of it, but the next time he sees Tony, he grimaces at him, makes some excuse about needing to go on a jog before it gets too hot, and leaves the tower at a pace just under a dash.
He heads down to his workshop, which is fully stocked, but hasn’t been properly lived in in ages.
He finds himself staring up at the ceiling for a long time, not thinking about any of the multitude of things he has to think about. His mind is white static, the buzz of an off-tuned radio, looking at the white ceiling and thinking of absolutely nothing.
But one night when they’ve finished the movie (The Godfather, which Steve grew bored of in the first twenty minutes), Tony pats Roomba on the head, then stands to go to bed, and promptly falls over.
“You too, boo.” He keeps one arm around Rhodey’s shoulders and pulls him towards Steve, who has dropped his defensive stance and instead has taken to standing awkwardly like a giant lug.
“I can’t handle this right now.”
“No, I wouldn’t,” Tony concedes. “Though I’d probably kick myself out.”
Steve folds his hands in his lap.  “You two…” He trails off, and then makes a gesture with his hands that even he knows is impossible to interpret. By Tony’s baffled expression, he’s right. “You know – is she your girl?”
and this, this right here.
“It’s not like he can do anything,” Tony objects, before blinking. He looks down at his watch – 11AM. He absolutely should have seen Steve by now today. He looks around the living room – and nope, absolutely vacant of 6 foot tall, blonde supermodels. “JARVIS?”
Steve wonders when the next time he’ll hear those words are.
“Uh – occasionally.”
They don’t really do all that much, when Steve really thinks about it. Just talk.
“No,” Steve mutters. “Just toss them. I don’t want to cause you any discomfort or anything.”

Maybe he needs to be existed with.
“Why?”
Steve blinks in surprise. “Wait, you calculated that for me?”
areas.
“Coulson,” Steve says, after the click saying it was answered. “Can we talk?”
“You okay?” Tony asks casually, snapping Steve out his reverie. Tony’s staring at the eggs. They’re basically mush.
everything instead of just accept it as is and move on, he’d lose his mind. It’s been his decided mindset since waking up – just nod and question nothing. It has to be easier, in the long run.
Tony made do, contacting Starfleet. His death hadn't been recorded yet - unsurprising, given it had just supposedly happened moments ago and subspace communication is anything but perfectly reliable or instantaneous - and so starting his conversation with the communications ensign on-base with, "Hey, I'm not dead," hadn't been the most intelligent move in his lifetime. After a frankly astonishingly thorough check, including a DNA sample, his identity was verified, and he was allowed to contact the Avenger.
Steve breathes a visible sigh of relief, body slumping. “Thank God,” he breathes.
easy to control, especially on as little sleep as he’s on – but when JARVIS congratulates Tony on being able to synthesize the element, Steve goes completely quiet.
She was stationed on Vulcan, after all, and is clearly intelligent.
“Who are you? Both of you?”
“But you know what’s on the ship?” Tony asks. They all turn to stare at him. He doesn’t meet their gazes, eyes only on Steve. “You know how to navigate it, how to work the technology on it, where items are?”
“Yes, but when you declined the offer, she decided to hire me on for herself.”
Steve leaves to go to the bathroom, and Tony thinks,
“They were supposed to be for you,” Steve says, and Tony has been so far in his head thinking of people to add to the list that it takes him a moment to digest.
“I believe, sir,” JARVIS says, and Steve unthinkingly looks to the ceiling. “That you said you wanted to minimize risk. The public could take advantage of—”
“Requested,” Steve automatically corrects, a surprised but pleased expression in his face. “I didn’t mean for you to think you had to do it immediately. It’s only been a couple hours.”
and I just
Tony stays silent.
Romanoff shrugs. “Apparently he had military experience before, enough that they let him bypass a lot of Starfleet regulations and most of the academy.” Her smile turns a little wicked. “But Tony – he doesn’t know much beyond the 20
“Cotton?” Tony helpfully supplies.
is actually kind of a logistical problem.
It’s always been hard for him to fall for people – romantically or sexually. It takes a lot for him to get to the point that he can think of anyone that way. At absolutely most lenient, it’s happened three other times in his life.
“Couldn’t it help everyone?” Steve asks. “Your company – your Vulcan one, Stark Industries. Couldn’t they manufacture them?”
“I don’t really need—” Steve tries to object, but Bruce reaches around Tony and stabs him right in the bicep – rather hard, if Steve’s wince is any indication.
“I know the feeling.” He kisses Steve’s temple, just because he can. “But no. It’s you. And it’s only ever going to be you.”
“Did they?” Tony shoots him an offended look, and Steve puts up his hands. “Okay, sorry, dumb question. But what is it?”
“Yeah.” A thought goes across his mind. “I’ll never be able to discuss any current media with anyone. They won’t follow.”
“Oh, I didn’t mean to suggest—”
“Pepper!” Tony exclaims into his phone. “How is the CEO-ing going?”
Tony opens the door and almost gets punched in the face by Steve’s knocking fist.
But Steve doesn’t look like he was cracking a joke. His brow is furrowed and he looks uncomfortable, but he steels his expression and nods, oh so serious, and says, “You heard me, Tony.”
Here’s what Tony doesn’t say: “I can’t.”
Tony looks at him, dead on, eyes catching eyes, before Tony looks away, staring at the far wall in silence.
Steve's so pleasant to be around. He's quiet to Tony's brash, thoughtful to Tony's thoughtless, kind to Tony's barbs, opinionated to Tony's flippancy, the artist to Tony's scientist, the shield to Tony's sword.
“I know,” Steve says, and then stresses, “But
“Pepper,” Tony says, finally letting his tone shift to serious. “Part of being in my position is getting to decide how I want to live my life. And if I decide I want to change it, then that’s my choice. And no one gets a say, not even you.”
“Captain,” Coulson says, apparently trying to take up the reins again in this conversation. “I’d like to discuss with you what happens now.”
Tony’s mind immediately sifts through thousands of files – Levonos system, currently 4.43 days away at Warp 5, inhabited system, first contact was made with Levonos II, who have been admitted into the federation as of 8.7 months ago.
“He is not a Vulcan,” his mother replied, all iron.)
Coulson looks at him, then bites his lip and looks down. He sighs, nice and heavy. “Look, Stark, you’re not necessarily wrong. And the last thing I want to do is hurt a treasured national icon—”
“I also didn’t tell you I made the fungus in the first place.” Steve’s face blanks in surprise. “What of it? Do you need my full biography before we go on any mission?”
For all his traveling, Tony had never been, and he found himself almost excited to go. He wasn’t certain what cell he wanted to visit – he was highly considering the biological telemetry research lab, but there was also a quadrant that held a small zoo for crippled or healing Terran animals that he secretly had a bit of an interest in visiting.
No response.
She looks at him with an expression of such disbelief that makes his inside squirm with such guilt that he just says, “Okay, sorry Pepper, of course,” and then closes the door on her.
“I’m staying for me,” Steve says, stepping out of the machine. He's calm, now. Heartbeat slowed, confident steps. This - this was the right choice. He can feel it.
And so he didn’t look too hard.
he chose that pose because it looks cool.
“Stark here.”
“That I’m awesome, better than everyone else, and made cool-ass shit no one else could figure out.”
“I’m the selfish asshole?” Steve says. He’s not shouting anymore, but the way his voice wavers is worse. “What about you? You can’t do that to people. Make you matter to them and then just take yourself away. It’s not fair.”
though?”
Steve gets with the program quickly, opening up to him and letting Tony take the lead, which he does, pressing in and harder for a good three seconds, and hating himself for it, before putting a lasso on himself and pulling back, releasing Steve’s lips.
way, there wasn’t, how—
As for Steve, stubbornness was always his biggest fault.
“Steve’s fine when we’re off duty. And I’m not eating in engineering; I’m eating with you, and that’s where you are.” Tony can feel a flush start to rise from within, which he wills down by force. “You’re the only senior staff member not on the bridge. I want to know my men.”
Steve begins spending his lunch breaks in engineering on a consistent basis.
“People can stick their wonder up their ass.”
“Yeah, that’s better, I can see fine.”
, he barely has to bend down. “You could come live in my tower. Pluses: I’m a billionaire, I could give you anything you need. It’s in downtown New York, which you might like to see again. I am not a part of a shady government organization looking to use you for their own purposes. I’m just a curious dude with too much time on his hands who wouldn’t mind the company.” He mentally weighs his next point, and then just decides to go for it. “Plus, you knew my dad. Some connection to the past.”
He has to be there; he’s working the machine. He has to be the last sight Steve sees before he’s whisked away. He has to look him in the eye.
Probably not that, if Tony’s glare is any indication.
“Generally,” Natasha inputs, as Tony internally tries to put his thoughts in a numbered order so he can reply, “Tony can touch you, but don’t touch him back without permission or a long-standing relationship.”
soon. He doesn’t have time to email the board of directors back about the stock prices, like he even cares.
He had taken the razor from Tony’s hand and replaced it with a small wooden Cardassian vole. “I found this in the market today,” Jarvis had said, pulling him to a standing position. "I thought you may like it."
rejected
Steve looks hurt, and says something akin to, “I’ve never had more than one friend at a time,” and the only honest response Tony has is, “Yeah, me neither, and maybe that’s a problem.”
“Sir, there’s—”
Tony slumps back down in the chair next to Steve.
“We will fix it.”
“Do I?” Steve asks, and it takes a moment for Tony to remember that he’s the one who started this conversation.
Clint at the helm, Natasha in the corner, Bruce by his side, an ensign security officer, Peter the intern who is bouncing on his toes, and there, in the back, right corner, the Captain.
Tony hadn’t understood, but believed. And as he grew and gained and decided, he took the advice. He soon found that the Vulcan way of cold deliberation worked for hardline stances in the business room, but the human’s way of friendliness and showmanship gained more loyalty and friends.
“Okay,” he agrees, voice muffled by his arms. The situation probably calls for some type of sarcastic comment, like asking if it’s still a truce if he’s a ghost from beyond the grave, but he just can’t summon the energy.
kids all day, Jesus Christ – when he gets the idea to get his tailor up there and make Steve a decent set of modern clothes.
Tony doesn’t skimp on his tech, so the bass is pounding. He can feel the reverberation in his skull, in his bones, in his fingers, in his heart. The room is shaking a little, and Steve goes to cover his ears. Tony grabs his hands away and pulls them down, and Steve lets him.
Tony shakes his head, probably in exasperation, but he follows.
?” Tony repeated. “
“SHIELD is on its way.”
“He came into my room and tried to kill me, monologuing about bringing about your downfall,” Steve snaps, and Tony can see his fingers tighten. “Don’t tell me to let him go.”
“No problem,” Tony says, then shrugs, and ruins it a little with, “It’s what I do, be awesome, I can’t help it.”
Shore leave comes three months into Steve’s tenure as Captain. They’re near an Earth colony – Star Base 2 – that was built in space. Ever since Tony learned about it for the academy exams, he’s been fascinated with its architecture. It was built entirely in space – a difficult feat for humans, who still have yet to come up with a cost-effective way to be out in space without constricting suits – and was designed to look like a honeycomb.
He spent the whole day actively trying to hide it – and now it’s all that’s on his mind.
Tony, oblivious to his internal stress, decides to make a list of what words and slang to drop and what some more modern sayings mean – Steve has no idea if it’s comprehensive, but he’s definitely glad his brain got sharper with serum, because good God, he’s going to sound like a moron probably a hundred times even with it – when he starts to feel himself actually losing it, just a little.
“You okay?” she asks, apprehensive in a way that makes him wonder how he’s looked in the past.
Maybe Tony just hasn't put enough energy into other people in the past.
Coulson had stared at him a little disrespectfully for that one, so Tony made the better point that it might be useful to have him and the suit in there in case Cap woke up and got violent.
“Oh, that’s right.” Tony’s been leaning his head on his chin, eyes growing steadily wider as he dictates notes to JARVIS the further Steve gets without stopping. He sits up now, though, and grimaces. “Pepper is my personal assistant. She has every reason to be very mad at me this morning, so brace yourself.”
That time, he had stayed.
“You’re too much of an army drone to ever come back into civilian life. This isn’t about not getting used to the 21
“Just like that." Tony nods. "Though, I’d just kick you out of the tower if you say no.”
“If we put this,” he bangs on part of the accelerator. “On the shield, it would finally level out.”
“Is he there alone?” he demands.
“T’hy’la isn’t an option for me, Steve,” Tony explains. “It’s not something I can take a chance on, try out to see if it fits. It’s – it’s lifelong. It’s permanent. It’s not my choice to make. Who it is – who I want it to be – doesn’t matter. I’ll love them anyway. What matters is if
They begin walking the halls in tandem, once again, roaming in mostly silence, surveying the art with quiet appreciation. Tony can respect the camaraderie, but he wonders what happened to Steve’s constant commentary.
“Uh—”
century get more creeped out than Steve’s shrugged, “So it’s a smart robot without a body.”
“Interview?” Tony repeats, putting down the rubix cube he was fiddling with while talking. “Why would I interview—”
Steve walks in behind him, coming to a stop when they’re shoulder to shoulder.
There’s no way Pepper’s not going to be in the tower, and there’s no way she’s going to miss the blonde haired, blue eyed guy built like a tree living in his guest room. It’s not like she’ll recognize him, but in a way, that makes it worse. If she knew who he was, she might understand why he feels the compulsion to keep him close, keep an eye on him.
“Whoa, what do you get there?”
“You’re going to tell me the moment you make the cure, right?”
Steve stops, watching helplessly as Tony flies up and up and up, the drones a swarm behind him, maybe forty, maybe more.
“God damn it,” he says, and continues hacking at the ice with the thankfully decent sized knife he put in the armor.
Tony’s honestly a little scared, ready to babble and beg for his life, when Steve goes down to one knee – and oh, Steve threw something through the wall.
“How do you know that?”
*five month later edit* I just realized my whole inspiration for this fic was the idea that he donated his entire art collection to Steve instead of the boy scouts, and then I completely and utterly forgot to put it in here. LOL. Nice, me. So just pretend that was somewhere in like, the third chapter!
Patching into the Avenger was more frustrating than anticipated. The Flualli government had initially made contact with the Avenger through Starfleet, and all in-range transmissions had been done over hailing frequencies rather than ship communicators. Point being, the Flualli didn't have a direct path to contact the Avenger.
Beyond what his dad kept, of course.
“Prepare?” Steve grasps onto. “Prepare for what?”
Steve pulls back a fraction, just enough to catch Tony’s eyes, and he must be seeing something he’s feeling there – the hope, the disbelief, the affection – because he lets his head fall to Tony’s shoulder, and takes a step in closer, into the vee of Tony’s legs. His arms reach around Tony’s middle, like he’s small, and he holds on tight.
“Uh,” Steve says. “I guess he’s been normal for Tony?”
He still isn’t particularly in the eating or enjoying mood, and Tony’s been staring at him like he’s a bug under a microscope the further along he gets, but Steve also doesn’t seem to ever get full, so he’s through plate eleven with he jumps slightly from JARVIS’s voice.
For the first time, he had wondered if he deserved to take that position of power for himself.
The next half hour is spent with Steve just staring out the window and Tony catching up on shit he let slide while on his impromptu vacation. He still is CEO; he’s gotta take care of
“Hey, Spangles,” Tony greets. He can’t manage any levity in his tone.
And suddenly, Steve realizes, he knows how to do this.
“You could become a fireman,” Tony suggests, ignoring the way the compliment made his insides squirm slightly. He sits up tall, spinning the chair. “Save kittens, run into danger head first. Etc. And so on.”
Tony for a moment stares into the faceplate of his creation, his savior from captivity, the symbol of the new point to his life. For a moment, Tony stares past it, into the eyes of his t’hy’la, who will never know.
He gets the feeling it’s the latter; something about how Tony presents himself – cool, confident, like he knows he’s worth your time – that just kinda speaks to overwhelming wealth.
The dirge for his father was long and pointless and, somehow, had made Tony feel even worse, which he didn’t think was actually possible.
That was something he eventually trained out of himself.
Another thing Steve asks, but only once.
Tony’s expertise was in weaponry centuries more advanced than this – but binary is binary, wires are wires, and sometimes, no matter how much you wish it wouldn’t, the puzzle pieces still fit together, snug, in one unpromising picture.
“Who says
It’s 3AM, and Tony’s sitting alone at the kitchen table, a mug of cold coffee held in-between his hands.
“I know him,” Steve says, and good God, does he sound pissed. Apparently sneaking up on Steve when he’s sleeping has devastating consequences; Tony should take note. “He’s been on TV talking down about you.”
Tony waits until the final piece of the armor has snapped into place, before catching Steve’s flailing hand.
“What are those?” Steve asks, coming closer. They’re circles, glowing a dull blue, and, honestly, they look like an off-brand version of the reactor.
Steve expects to have to explain why it’s fitting, but Tony simply raises the glass, in a mock toast, and says, “To righting the past’s wrongs.”
“I’m not the one who needed one,” he shouts back. “Stand back.”
He’s invested so much of himself into understanding this little world.
True, usually he was stuck on the scratchy sheets and in the bed that made him feel shorter than even he was, rather than the guest chair.
He’s almost through, only a spoonful or two left, when Steve appears in front of him.
“I had a fascination with alien animals when I was a child,” Tony answers. He remembers his father buying him a sehlat in a vain attempt to squash his incessant rambling about different culture’s pets.
Tony is familiar with the feeling of helplessness and how it is often accompanied by the feeling of desperately needing to be useful. He knows himself well enough that both are about to come in spades in the following months.
Tony wishes he were braver.
Coulson looks a little pained, and opens his mouth to reply, but he’s interrupted by some young, male agent who says, “Mr. Coulson” with a British accent, and Tony’s momentarily too distracted by why the British care about finding Captain
“Sure, Tony,” Steve agrees automatically.
Tony – spine of iron, emotionless Vulcan, the unshakeable rock of the board room – almost bursts into tears. Like a dumb, scared kid left alone in the world, with nowhere to go, nowhere to turn, no one who wants him.
“You only need to eat it to use it.”
It’s almost five hours later when Tony comes back up.
That or Steve’s been out making friends and hiding it from Tony, which, honestly, Tony would be legitimately offended. Not even jokingly, just honestly. And maybe even hurt, though he probably wouldn’t acknowledge that one.
“Leave me alone,” Steve responds mildly. “I’m a senior citizen.”
Steve walks in, hair in disarray, and eyes shining with something Tony can’t think enough to name. He stops in front of Tony and lets out a long, shaking breath.
He sputtered conscious.
Since coming back, he’s been trying to follow to paths that have him heading in two opposite directions at once.
He didn’t have to be what they made him.)
“Well, what do you think? This is my Monticello, so tread lightly.”
“Around,” Tony confirms. “On ship. So, don’t dismiss me. Please.”
“Oh Tony,” Hammer says. “That was certainly not me. Definitely one of my employees. I’ll be sure to investigate the situation and get to the bottom of it.”
“Hey bud. Activate heater.”
“Do you think – am I morally responsible to stop some of the bad that has happened between the 40s and now? Warn people? I’m a time traveling status symbol, they’ll probably believe me. Should I bring back vaccines? Stop the Rwanda genocide? Warn people about Hurricane Katrina ahead of time? Do something about the housing crisis? Save people from plane crashes?”
“They called weapons peacekeepers in my time, too,” Steve says.
He misses breakfast, and before he knows it, Steve has come down the stairs looking for him. He’s glad he’s made it to the couch and off the floor, because that’s a pathetic he doesn’t really want to reach.
"Hi."
He won’t let this happen. Not to the person who built him. Not again.
choice for
“Didn’t you apply to be mine?”
“Natalie,” she corrects with a not-very-polite grimace. “I’m Miss Potts’s personal assistant.”
“Just pull the lever to your right, and it’ll go,” Tony says.
Steve just slightly nods his head, no real reaction, and Tony suddenly wonders how many of his jokes are going to make any sense to this guy. Hell if he knows when sayings came into popularity.
“Thanks. Can I step off the transporter, now?”
He stands over their graves, his mind blank, body cold, eyes damp, with Obadiah’s arm around his shoulders, the canyon to jump of taking over the company looming, and he decides something else – it was time to start chasing the future instead of the end.
They’re wasting time for no reason.
It was morning, or at least by the ship’s standards. Tony wasn’t tired. He was fiddling with the AI code structure he was writing for a helper-bot, trying to make it slightly less sentient.
Steve ignores the sarcasm. “I watched him die, a foot in front of me. You, or even him, can’t ask me not to carry that with me.”
“You know that isn’t actually in my job description, right?”
It takes the new Captain a second, but then he smiles, and takes a step forward to meet Natasha in the middle.
“You did that on
“I don’t know,” Tony responds, incredulous. “I am perhaps the least qualified person in the world to answer that question.”
Tony, because he’s a selfish bastard and knows this fantasy will probably get him through to the end of his life, pushes up with the balls of his feet, and opens his mouth.
It’s pointless.
“JARVIS,” Tony says, and Steve audibly sighs. “Turn on AC/DC. Any song. Loud.”
He stands and stalks out, taking the elevator down instead of up, and Steve’s left on the floor, feeling like he’s been left in more than one piece.
“Tony,” Steve interrupts. He still sounds happy. “Stop thinking ahead for one second. This is – this is incredible.”
She didn’t know it, but that conversation was the birth of the robotics division of Stark Industries.
He turns around and sees Tony and gives a pained smile and half wave.
Steve glances back down at the PADD, quickly scrolling through. “It only said it was a natural fungus that destroyed food supplies.” Steve glances up. His confusion is seeping through the bond, and it makes something in Tony curl in self-loathing. “Why would you make a fungus?”
The next day, Tony hides in his workshop.
He also doesn’t want to ruin the time for Steve.
“Okay, sure, that’ll help everything,” Clint mutters, watching as Drax runs head first at a large blue man wielding some sort of cane-type-thing. He slams into the man’s back, and Tony holds back a wince at the sound the collision makes, hearable even from their distance away.
That night seems to open up a door that Steve didn’t even know existed – the door leading to Tony.
Oh, fantastic, the exact thing he had said about fifteen times that he wasn’t sure he wanted to be. Great, Tony’s doing a wonderful job at helping a national icon live his life. “What happened to ‘no longer a government or military lackey?”
“How could you even begin to think
“Yeah, women putting their legs in pant holes, the floozies.”
“Hey, you broke the egg yolk,” Tony says from behind him, and Steve flinches, whirling around.
He’s still pissed, even if a lot of it is for form’s sake – and hey, Steve isn’t exactly seeking him out, either – but he’s really edging further into ‘lonely’ than ‘angry,’ so he finds himself walking into the kitchen during Steve’s regular lunchtime.
Which makes it all the more impossible to think of trying to get to know him.
He had been looking at the gravestone.
Normally, Tony’s hell.
They’re greeted by the security desk, but they’re virtually ignored by everyone else in the lobby. Granted, Tony shuffles them through like they’re avoiding the paparazzi and he just had a sex tape released, but still, he slightly wonders why he doesn’t warrant more hellos. They make it up to the penthouse fairly quickly, and Tony gives him the dollar tour, just enough for him to get around.
with your days?”
He opens his eyes, and there’s Steve, hovering over him with a bright, terrified look to his eyes, tight with worry and anticipation.
He wouldn’t call his past self exactly a Captain America fanboy. But that’s mostly because he dislikes the term fanboy, because the term is too corny to properly capture his innocent enthusiastic hero-worship of what he
“What? What?”
Steve swallows, blinks several times, and turns his wide, somehow worried eyes on Tony. “Tony, are you sure? This—”
“Oh hey, Justin,” Tony says conversationally. “I see you’ve been busy since the Congressional meeting.”
“You can’t stubborn someone back to life.”
Is it going to be three years later, and he stumbles through a conversation at the grocery store, offending someone just by his own ignorance, because he can’t assimilate years and years of background knowledge no matter how hard he tries?
do it, of course, but sledgehammering, jackhammering, and moving shit is just a lot easier when you have superhuman strength, and even easier when you have a decent enough motivation.
It’s been almost an hour, though, and he’s considering getting inside the armor to watch some TV on the HUD, when Steve’s eyes blink open.
Steve asks, and given Tony’s wince, that might have been a shriek. “
Feeling awkward and slightly steamrolled, he walks over to the table and sits down, and looks rather helplessly at the many – sixteen, his mind helpfully supplies – plates of food.
Steve mutes it after the next couple people, rolling his eyes at the theory that Tony is cooking up media attention so he can dramatically drop into a party in the Iron Man suit.
If he’s surprised no one tries to talk to him about it, he tries not to show it.
he's just incredibly
Natasha’s tech widow bites are
“See, Coulson?” Tony says smugly. “Unrepentant, blunt personalities do a have a purpose in life.”
need to work them out for two hours every goddamn morning – when Coulson knocks on the door of his workshop.
“What?” Tony demands, immediately standing. Steve’s out of his chair in a millisecond and heading out, presumably to get his shield. “What’s going on?”
He can see the surprise on her face, just for a moment, and then it’s gone. “Steve,” she says, a strange note in her voice. “She was.”
Tony hears his own words echoed back at him, and he wants to roll his eyes. “God, why didn’t you punch me for that? It’s so obnoxious.”
” Steve spits. “I’m not going to apologize for that.”
“Ah, Mister Stark,” Captain Rogers greets. “I have been looking for you. I asked about your quarters but couldn’t get a clear answer.”
“Clint tried to convince me to leave with him, but I insisted I stay.”
“I don’t know,” Tony answers honestly.
Or Wanda, or Pietro, or the other Peter, or Nebula, or Groot, or Drax, or Stephen, or Scott, or –
“Childhood betrothal bonds are common on Vulcan,” he ends up saying, handing to PADD back. “I had never intended to fulfill it.”
“Huh,” Tony says, looking down at the mug thoughtfully. “He might have gotten the water and oil mixed up. Well, no matter.”
Tony was right; the food does taste better.
He watches as Steve’s smiles slips, and hates himself as he says, “This is not a good idea.”
If Steve pries him off, that’s one thing.
“JARVIS,” Tony says, suddenly. “Sign me up for some therapy. This shit has got to stop.”
Nope, not an option.
“Steve,” Tony says, catching his eye. He breathes through it. “Let me let it go.”
Tony’s returning from the bathroom, mind only on trying to decide what to choose for lunch, when he feels a sudden, inexplicable alarm creep through him. He pauses in the hallway, just to catch a breath, hand on the wall for support, and tries to breathe and work through the confusion. His mental shielding and emotional control are wavering. He prods through the anxiety and stifling unease, and it’s several long, unfortunate seconds before he identifies that these emotions are not his own.
And there it is.
In the next two weeks, Steve does three things as purposefully and consistently as he can: read or listen to anything and everything he can, work out until even he is starting to lag, and avoid Tony.
“Not much like talking,” Steve says, advancing on Hammer, who turns to keep them both in his line of sight.
Tony’s just obliviously munching on some bizarre popcorn – why does he insist on finding strange, Whole Foods versions of food? Why does popcorn need to be vegan and gluten free? – while Steve is having a miniature existential crisis a cushion away.
“So,” he asks, elbows leaning on the back of the couch where Steve is sitting and staring at the TV, which he found surprisingly easy to describe. “What do you think?”
Even then, Tony resisted those choices.
As happens so often with Tony, he feels like the conversation is a rope being pulled out of his grasp, and he can only occasionally grab it back and stop it, yank back into the land of making sense.
The t’hy’la bond complicates everything, as his other half/half counterpart knows full well.
“It sounds—” Vulnerable. “Risky.”
The problem is, Tony is a bit of a fixator. He gets a project and nothing else exists until he finishes, and he’s had that problem with people in the past as well. He latches on and suffocates them with his feelings until the person pushes him away, gasping for breath, and he loses another person.
Steve’s emotions – calmer, now, but still laced with anxiety and adrenaline – are clouding Tony’s mind, and he can’t cut through to think of a single excuse.
“I don’t think there’s enough fires to keep me interested for long,” Steve says, mouth twitching.
to be there when he awakes because of the little phone stunt, so Coulson can wisely shove it and let him be in there so Tony doesn’t have to force his way in with the Iron Man suit.
Two days ago, Tony had walked in on him sketching. It wasn’t anything he was putting a lot of thought or emotion into, at least not consciously, but when Tony came in the room and perched on the back of the couch, he felt himself folding it closer to his chest on instinct.
He asks as much.
He thinks of his strength that allowed him to lift a boulder off Commander Wilson’s leg, that one mission to Nova III.
“By only my observations, sir, it is more than 850 hours.”
“What?”
Coulson raises an eyebrow at him. “I figured you’d know. Where else would we look for Captain America?”
He takes a breath – not a sigh, but something noticeable, and Steve can practically see the thoughts running past his eyes.
“Agent,” he greets. “What can I do for you?”
That night, Tony also finds out he can, actually, still feel the joy that comes with pointless fun, even if he hasn’t felt it in decades.
“Yeah, he did that a lot to a lot of people, you aren’t special. You need to be a little more specific,” Tony says, kicking him in the ribs again.
and he’s interpreting and he just – he
Fury deliberates. He laces his fingers together. “Why?”
He can hear the armor disassembling, and then it’s being pushed off him, and he hears a very anxious, “Steve?”
“Hey,” Steve objects, which is lost in Tony’s much louder, “
Not a particularly reassuring reminder, but Tony opens the document all the same. He pages through it quickly – all his money will go to various charities, his estates to Pepper, his science equipment dedicated to the federation, with Rhodey reserving the right for first grabs of any of his possessions.
Tony is almost finished with the roaming drone design. He actually thinks he may be able to sell it commercially and makes an actual note to JARVIS to tell Pepper about it. He’s missed inventing more than he wants to admit to himself – there’s something just so
He wants to say,
“According to the briefing, he’s a human. Earthling.”
It takes Steve a second to find his voice.
Soft blue eyes scan the room, pausing slightly when he reaches Tony, gaze noticeably moving to his ears before back to his face, before he continues searching around the room. His arms are held behind his back, his posture so straight that Tony finds himself mirroring it without thinking. His clear blue eyes are sharp, attentive, hair a clear business cut, and he has a clear aura of power, of respect.
Steve just smiles and taps his foot again. "I know you want to ask."
Tony lies in bed, thinking about the Levonos solar system.
The TV in the gym is talking about Tony again.
Since Steve walked in, in his head Tony’s been systematically going down the list of every person Steve knows, crossing names off the list, and he’s come to the conclusion it’s someone he doesn’t know, someone sick at a hospital, or someone gave them to Steve and he doesn’t want to seem rude.
Or so Tony was told six days after his release from capture.
“Where are you going?” Steve finds it himself to ask. “And why can’t I follow?”
Coulson rolls his eyes. A beat, then, “Miss Potts didn’t want to accompany you?”
But the numb feeling seems to extend even to this matter, so he just greets Tony with an underwhelming, “Hi.”
And Tony just thinks,
“You really can send me back where he’s still alive?”
Or Tony’s, for that matter.))
Tony says in horror. Steve reels back, obviously hurt by the tone, but Tony continues, “Did I Stockholm Syndrome you?”
Tony opens his mouth, hoping the right words appear on his tongue. After several seconds of just air, he finally stutters out a hopefully believable lie, “I have a duty to this ship. I can’t just resign for some – some bond.”
And like that, he’s over this whole argument.
“Okay, then. Open new project file.”
“I really doubt I’d do that,” Steve says, which is a good enough confirmation for Tony.
“You are 21 years of age. You are Vulcan. Most Vulcans are completely independent and well into their chosen fields by this time.”
“What?” he asks, a little self conscious.
(This is Tony’s worst memory:
Steve’s blinking at him in surprise or confusion, Tony’s not sure. After a moment, he just stutters out, “Oh, well, I mean – I have never seen you with anyone for a basis of comparison, I guess.”
Eight of the visible creatures are lying on the ground, either dead or unconscious. Tony scans the room, quickly assessing each body – pink, antennae, a Ferengi, a woman humanoid, a –
Steve can probably feel the wave of anxiousness leave Tony. Probably misinterprets it. Tony lets him.
His heart pounds. A perfectly engineered fighter, a eugenically formed soldier, a killer, a fully trained military Captain, a galaxy explorer – happy to watch something small for no reason at all, simply because Tony asked. The contradiction of it makes him feel soft.
A beat. “Sure,” Steve says. “Okay. Anyway, the thought process was that if you were going to die, you might as well experience those great things once. You know – love, marriage, kids.”
“Sure, Cap,” Tony answers vaguely, and somewhat catalogues the odd looks he’s receiving from the crew, particularly Bruce and Natasha.
And then door slid open.
now?”
Steve finds himself pausing mid-step.
have more motivation to save your life than you do.”
“You’re?” Steve prompts.
Tables are broken, glasses are shattered, the door has a large hole through the center, as if someone clawed their way through it, a window is blown out, and only around eleven of the twenty-nine people that were supposed to be in attendance are visible. Tony assumes – hopes – the others were able to escape.
“Of course, sirs. I hope you enjoy the rest of your visit.”
(“No, no, it’s cool,” Pepper says. A hesitation, then, “I’m just not sure I understand how it differs from regular AIs.”
“Hey, Steve.”
“I had no idea.” Tony tries to recall the words on the page, the acts of Captain America. “My father wouldn’t let me read much about Earth. I relied on stories from my mom, and I don’t think she mentioned you to me.”
“It wasn’t?”
The days on Flualli were hot and long, and, in his boredom, he found himself engineering a bio-hazard, ecological detector. It was handheld, much like a tri-corder, but had the sole purpose of scanning plants for any abnormalities. It could take a biological sample and run it for any concerns, such as fungus, water contamination, or any other abnormalities. The mock-up was slightly haphazard, thrown together with scraps from the Flualli junkyard, but he was pleased with the mechanics of it nonetheless. When the Avenger made orbit, he was finishing downloading the Fluallian database on botany with one of their younger science officers, who, for no reason Tony could really figure out, was the only one who was a light shade of blue.
“Having
“I can’t
Here’s what Tony says: “I can do it.”
“Yeah. I had a really long talk with my therapist last week – did you know if you’re willing to pay off their student loans, they’ll give you seven hour sessions? Everyone should be rich; it’s so helpful. Anyway, she thought that I may be being unfair to you. Or, she led me to the conclusion I was being unfair to you, whatever, same difference. Or I am not being unfair to you now, but I will be in the future if I don’t give you time to prepare.”
“Can’t sleep?” Tony asks, heading towards the cupboard.
Agent.”
“My surveillance of his performance in the gym would point to no, sir.”
And whoa, those words in that order is not right coming out of Tony’s mouth.
Later, Tony will wonder: t’hy’la bonds indicate mental compatibility. How could a war profiteer be harmonious with someone like that?
“JARVIS, come on, now.”
“Tony.” Obadiah shook his head, almost imperceptibly. He pulls, and the arc reactor comes. “Don’t take this personally. It was only logical.”)
“I had to catch you, Tony,” Steve says. He tries to sit up. Tony immediately moves forward, hand on his back, trying to guide him. His arms hurt, ouch. “You would have hit the ground otherwise.”
him, how can it be classified – but he did appreciate the down time to warm up. He didn’t sleep well all night – for the first part, he is slowly dying, and sometimes, most times, he can actually feel it. As much as he doesn’t want to admit it, he’s not sure if it’s the physical or mental aspect of that that has him turning in his bed all night.
Tony speaks rapidly, strings of words mashing into each other, and it takes Steve a second to digest what in there is really asking for his comment.
“Probably because I had HR write the job ad. Would have been far more accurate if I had a whack at it.”
Tactics.
He thinks of Pepper standing on the foot of Mount Seleya, and her honest reverence when she said, “It’s beautiful.”
He blinks awake, raising his head from where it was resting uncomfortably on the chair arm, and sits straight up. Abruptly, a cold feeling trickles through his fingers, and he realizes whoever was holding his hand had dropped it immediately.
Steve snorts. “I showed my strength instead of spoke my mind.” He laughs slightly to himself. “You know, even back then, people trusted me without knowing me. Gave me missions, gave me rank, made me a poster boy for the war effort. Truth is, I never was all that good of a soldier. Never really took orders. Just kinda did what I thought was right. It just so happened that what I thought was right aligned with their positions, at the time. I became a symbol I never really deserved.”
“Is he like—” Tony struggles for a second. “Fine? Brain-dead, brain-alive, functioning, moving, awake?”
so much, so he takes a bottle of whiskey, and bets himself that he can finish it before the sun rises.
to feel. He’s received more than one backhand to the face due to his inability to shut down excitement at a project, or grabbing a classmate’s shoulder in friendship, or gritting his teeth in frustration.
Tony unwittingly barks out a laugh, which it seems like neither of them expected.
“Your tolerance is revolting,” Tony shoots back, also grinning. Also drunk.
“Hey,” Tony protests mildly.
Steve simply looks at him, blinking rapidly.
Most boys dream of being super. Tony actually thought he was capable of it. It’s no
(Steve thinks anyway. He hasn’t asked Tony what JARVIS actually is yet).
He also wasn’t expecting Steve to
you care about Starfleet regulations?”
"Loose threads?"
He thinks about making a crack about definitely wanting her as personal as possible, but he can almost physically feel Steve’s presence behind him, and while he’s not one for shame, he is apparently one to care about other’s opinions for once, so he just smiles, quick and bright, and rattles off, “I don’t need an assistant, but thank you. You can leave through the elevator. Or stairs, if you want, though I really don’t think you need the exercise.”
“Commander Stark,” Steve greets, with a real touch of surprise in his voice. He places the book down by his knee. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”
“Peachy,” he answers, closing his eyes, and letting his head fall back onto the couch.
“Steve. Please stay calm, because I have some bad news to break for you.”
he’s supposed to know who this is.
Tony flapped his hand. "Standard-idiom. Don't worry about it, just say it."
He taps his insignia. “Two to energize.”
Steve agrees, if unenthusiastically, and as the tailor measures, Tony watches and prances around and makes comments that he’s quite positive never made it through his filter, just trying to fill the stilted air that’s suffocating the room.
That guy, Tony could – and would – kick in the shin.
“Do I still have to wait two months?”
that wasn’t my intent – Jesus Christ, no one is going to believe me. I didn’t house you so you’d—”
“There is something good in everything. Even if it’s just atoms. Atoms are fascinating.”
The tower is fairly renovated and has more rooms than Tony cares to count. He has a quick and painful conversation with Pepper about moving DUM-E, YOU, and Butterfingers over to New York, and he starts to wonder how far this “not telling people” thing goes.
“Of course not,” Tony says, like Steve offended him. He takes the seat next to Steve. “I am going to watch you eat as much you want and then send it down like thirty floors to my employee’s lunch room.”
a problem or his unhappiness a problem, and he doesn’t want to ask.
“Slave guards,” Natasha corrects.
"Know, that if you refuse your place in the Vulcan Science Academy, and leave, you are permanently separating yourself from Vulcan. You will be alone with your choices. No matter the trouble you get into, no matter what happens, I will not come for you. You will have to live with the consequences of your choice."
“Do it.”
He throws the shield, hitting three at once, and there’s Iron Man again, flying around and around and around, and all the drones follow.
Tony is intimately aware of how phasers are made, each piece that’s constructed, of the damage they are made and planned and created to inflict. “With my healing factor from the eugenics project, I’m fine, but Starfleet regulation says I get the next day off.”
Those years in his late twenties to early thirties were some of his best in regards to his own self-worth, even though now they make him look back and cringe with a dark, hollow feeling – but then, he didn’t care. He liked who he was, he liked what he was doing, he felt good doing it, and he wanted to live as long as possible so he could keep doing it.
He was almost kicked out of the company for it, but it was worth it. By everything, it was worth it.
“No,” Tony responds, disbelieving. “I want to know why we just had a heart-to-heart about World War II war sex, actually.”
“Nah. Just put me in the list of things you’ve left behind.”
Tony finds himself relaying a lot of anecdotes about the city. He almost surprises himself; he didn’t realize he had invested so much of himself in this place. It doesn’t really feel like home, it hasn’t for a little while, but there’s a history there that he wasn’t expecting.
“Oh, I forgot, silly me, all someone is worth to you is their
“The Supreme Leader, Akorbar, refused to cooperate with Starfleet or the Federation,” says Rogers, standing at the head of the bridge. His eyes are grave. “Starfleet has given us permission to attempt a rescue mission, as long as it remains discreet and Delta Worra is never aware of our presence.”
Steve looks up to the top of the building, where STARK is hanging in massive letters. Tony bounces on his feet. “Don’t listen to any of those sayings about overcompensation. None of them are true.”
Tony’s voice rings in Steve’s head.
Steve shrugs, and Natasha rolls her eyes. “He caused a diplomatic incident at
“—practice, and PTSD is real, and I’ve been watching you—”
“Ah.” Phones. Computers. Internet. This was all going to be so fun. And so impossible to describe. “It’s a phone.”
Tony reads it once, twice, three times, buying time for a response he’ll never be able to form properly.
“Captain—”
“Like you?” Steve questions, absolutely genuinely, and then shakes his head. He moves right along, not even noticing that something about the nonchalant way he said that takes Tony’s brain momentarily offline. “I just don’t think that’s me.”
Tony’s flung back into his headboard, cracking his skull on the wood. He unthinkingly pulls the blanket over his head, trying to protect his face from the falling debris.
“Don’t you
His gaze falls on Natasha.
“Tony?”
“Me too,” Steve agrees. “I’m lucky the ship tried my communicator when they did.”
“You know all those biological screenings I did?”
“If this is some Afghanistan related PTSD crisis—”
“The one with the PhD in Physics is saying it couldn’t, Captain Math.”
“At this point, I am fairly certain
“And yet you won’t make a decision about how to—”
As cliché as ying-yang thing may be, Tony could get used to it.
“And?” Steve repeats. “You didn’t tell me you
He flips through his projects idly, and not a single one can catch his attention, let alone be one that he would stay up over a day to do, even if it was an avoidance tactic.
“Cap.” Tony hangs his head, wondering what he can even say beyond
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupts. “There’s an incoming threat.”
“She was too – she invited us both to her wedding. She and her to-be-wife apparently are funding the whole thing on our tips, so it only felt right, in her words.”
“Is everything a joke to you?” Steve asks. He sounds tired, he sounds exasperated, and Tony feels his frustration rack up another four points.
He thinks about how he, one solitary creature in a universe too big to count or fathom, has some control over who lives and who dies.
They stop in front of a small painting,
Rhodey fixes him with a weird look. “Tony, are you feeling okay?”
He’s caused enough death inadvertently. He won’t do it on purpose.)
They stand quietly on the beach, watching the rolling waves, when Steve makes a surprised sound. Tony side-eyes him, then notices the tiny little creature that must have walked over Steve’s foot.
“How?” Tony asks.
Steve may not have been right, but he also may not have been wrong.
Steve is obviously expecting Tony to ask why given how taken aback he looks when Tony just shrugs and says, “sure, whatever, JARVIS, have an animal shelter bring all their dogs and cats by sometime today and I’ll pay their salaries for a month,” and then knocks his shoulder into Steve’s hard enough that he actually takes a step back, and there it is, the unobstructed coffee maker.
Deanna, Tony’s counselor, was kind and patient, more so than he deserved, he was sure, given it took almost an entire year for them to have an honest conversation.
“Can we beam you back?” Coulson asks, ignoring Steve, ever practical in the face of hardship.
Tony doesn’t have enough time left for it to hurt for a long time, anyway.
“I’m in the book,” Steve clarifies. Tony’s hand stills and he looks up, raising an eyebrow at Steve. “I am! I was Captain America.”
On day twenty, Roomba pushes a salt shaker off the counter and somehow, perfectly into Steve’s meal, and he looks at her with such disappointed dismay that Tony laughs until he cries.
A dam of ideas and futures break open in his head – not letting Bucky go on the mission, he and Bucky drinking together to celebrate the end of the war, Bucky at his wedding, he at Bucky’s, growing old together in the same neighborhood.
Tony grunts. He’s staring at a line of code. It’s HTML and makes all the text on his website bright, neon yellow, but he’s sure it looks impressive to Steve.
“Jesus Christ, yeah, you’ve earned going away from me for a bit. It’s fine.”
Steve picks at his food, swirling it with a fork, unseeing. “It’s my first mission as Captain.” Five days in and already on planet is damn good for any officer, but Tony keeps quiet, listening. “And I already don’t like where it’s headed. I’m sure you read the report, but we have to figure a cure for this fungus destroying their crop yield, but we don’t have an astromycologist on board. We’ve attempted to do a picture match, but not all the records in the system have photos.” Steve grimaces. “It’s like being back in my times; you’d think by now they’d have eliminated bureaucratic oversights. Anyway, they didn’t get an immediate match, and none of our science staff are specifically trained in fungi. This poor planet really could not survive waiting another few weeks waiting to get in touch with someone in Starfleet command with the recommended experience. If it spreads to the rest of their crops, their entire livelihood is going to be in jeopardy. It’s going to turn into a refugee situation.”
Not because it isn’t accurate, but because it is.
the past. A man of the future through and through, he’d lose his mind having to remake the steps of progress.
Silence on the comms.
He takes a moment being glad he’s not a father – how do you
The next day, Steve knocks on his bedroom door for thirteen straight minutes.
He wants to say,
He had thought to himself,
“I can only be one?” Tony had said, still staring at the grave. “Human or Vulcan?”
Tony would wonder too, if the galaxy’s largest weapon distributor and multi-planet galaxy, billboard star was reduced to this. Asked for this.
“Don’t set your expectations too high. The past made all sort of unreasonable expectations for us – flying cars, transporters, tin-foil outfits that make women’s breasts look pointy—”
to make it a tech company,
“Exactly
He hurried inside, and then – there it was.
But Maria had been human, and thus her organs were mostly useless to Vulcan anatomy and interests. Tony, remembering old Earth literature that his mother had read to him after dark, had requested a grave, thoughtlessly, without even knowing why.
“Illogical,” he had muttered when he first read the words. And it was – there was no reason for it, except the final bee from Earth had died the year prior to its construction, and Earth had wanted to make something to commemorate the species that played such a vital, important role in Earth’s ecosystem.
“Raising shields now.”
“Stark.” It’s Romanoff, and she does not sound thrilled. “Open a channel with transporter bay. The second the four of us are beamed up, we need to be out of here.”
She must figure Rogers doesn’t need to know that.
His first response is,
because like twenty-foot soldiers—”
“Done calling the police?” Tony asks, standing up from his crouch. Hammer’s hands and feet are also tied now, probably tighter than necessary.
He wonders if it’s a sweet, universe-given irony that he’s dying to hold the shields instead of the weapon.
“Give me a couple months,” Tony replies. “But yes.”
It takes him only a minute to find him in medbay, sitting on his bed, hunched over, like he’s trying to make himself smaller.
“It’s not a big deal. I spend most of my time inside basements or conference rooms anyway. Or I did. There’s pros to not being outdoors-y. And most flower places deliver. Anyway, who are these for?”
“Yes?” Steve replies, more a question than an answer.
“…Thank you?” Tony says, uncertain.
Even without the verbal acknowledgment, Tony can
The orders forbid him leaving his post in engineering; while he has projects down there to tinker with, and the core could always use maintenance, he finds himself on a PADD, slowly re-designing the code of the map holos – their zoom really was something pitiful – when his insignia buzzes.
He’s not sure if they would have gotten along all that well if they weren’t living in the same space and continually trusting the other with their lives – but, in the end, it doesn’t matter.
Pepper’s standing in the middle of the kitchen, hand on her hip, face pinched, and Steve suddenly feels that familiar trickle of guilt.
Tony can’t really blame him – they are standing in a ticking nuclear weapon, after all.
Though it takes some time to get there.
The Captain looks taken aback. “No, nothing like that. I wanted to get to know my crew. I’ve been told you’re quite – gregarious, when you can be pulled from your work.”
“Goodbye, Miss,” Steve says, with a little wave, and she gives Steve a curious look before she exits.
“What is all this?” Steve asks warily.
“Sorry, sorry,” he says, flipping his hand. “Just lightening the atmosphere.”
Tony thinks,
“JARVIS.” The Iron Man helmet eyes light. “Send him back to the Avenger – go through the south doors, and then head directly to med-bay. Once you’re there, deactivate and let Steve out. As soon as he’s taken care of, immediately head to the bridge and report on what you’ve recorded here. Go.”
He turns to go, but she catches him on the elbow. The way her hand lingers on his has some internal bells in Tony’s head dinging - flirting,
“Hey Cap,” he greets with a lazy salute.
Tony considers it, but he really doubts that would actually stop Steve, and was far more likely just to annoy Tony.
“Booo. Some Captain America you are, not supporting us in our time of war.”
Steve glances up, and Tony finds himself wanting to smile.
“What—what are you doing here? Why aren’t you on the shuttle? Did you find a way to get me out?” Tony asks, bewildered. There was
“I need to hear it from my superior officer.” He refuses to let tears cloud his vision – if he’s going to die, he’s going to die with clear eyes.
“For the next ten or so minutes.” Tony shrugs. Steve idly wonders what Tony did to anger her quite that badly if he’s that sure she’s about to quit.
“Yeah,” Bruce allows. “You’re fine.”
“I shouldn’t have said that,” Tony says immediately. “Steve – I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.”
Well – JARVIS did inform Tony that Steve had read all of the information Tony sent about LGBT+ rights. Not only that, Steve actually asked Tony for a list of movies with LGBT representation so he could get used to it being public, whatever that meant. They had passed a kissing male couple the other week, too, and Steve hadn’t done anything but smile slightly to himself.
“Like a weapon?”
But he’s not a better person. He knows that. He made an oath to try, staring into the face of a terrified but resolute Andorian – “Don’t waste it, Stark. Don’t waste your life. Don’t waste it.” – but ever since stepping off the turbolift and into the arms of Rhodey, he knew, no matter what, it would never be enough.
“So you just gave her the lead position in your company? Is it still a weapon’s manufacturing business?”
“2010.”
Tony’s mind dances to his workbench – a prototype of dinnerware that will disintegrate in open space, half-written/half-thought plans for the holographic simulator, one of his robot’s broken arms, a smaller communicator for the HUD, a sheet full of scribbles that represents an attempt at a formula to cure the Horatian flu.
about this turn of events.
“They must have been looking for me,” Tony says. “But couldn’t identify me through the suit. Now that they know—oh, shit, one second.”
“With all due respect, Mr. Coulson.” A pause. “And I’m not sure how much respect that actually is—” Tony snorts. “A house instead of a facility, and one person instead of groups of people, sounds better to me. Less stressful on everyone involved.”
During World War III, or the Eugenics War, Earth had fallen into times of crises, Tony remembers. Poor leadership from a number of powerful governments resulted in the war, one that had several different fronts, one of which was in space, where nuclear warheads were sent into orbit and aimed at one another’s countries.
Hammer’s placid smile drops. “The arc technology powered the drones, that’s all. It had the smallest role of anything. It wasn’t the most impressive part.”
When he was young, and we’re talking still sitting on laps and listening to stories of superheroes with wide and trusting eyes type young, he thought his dad would figure out the Captain America serum and give it to him, and he’d live forever. After he turned five and built his first robot, he thought he would be the one to do it.
“Someone should have told my father,” Steve replies, faux-thoughtfully, and Tony snorts. Steve grins at him, clearly relieved at their compatible senses of humor. “Doesn’t matter the planet or time period, does it, it’s just men all around?”
“Stuff it, Rogers. I don’t care about my name, if they think I sent them. I care that my name being on them means I had something to do with them being there. If they blow, that’s on me. If they kill, those lives are on me.”
The vision that was replaying through his head abruptly dies, replaced by a stone-cold, frozen image of Bucky as he’s falling.
“Hey Cap,” Tony greets. He slides a drive across the table. “Got you those files on cultural diplomacy you ordered.”
“Sorry,” Steve said, unsure of what he was apologizing for. “Sorry. I just—”
“Now I do,” Steve replies with little humor. Bruce has wandered off, which must mean Steve is fairly stable, but Tony’s hand’s itches to re-take his hand, take his wrist, feel his pulse, feel his warmth. “You know,” Steve says, and he sounds musing. “After he hit me with that – whatever was in his staff, and I was laying there, and I really thought I was going to die. And all I could think about was how much I wished I was back on the ship.”
What did he even
” One wrong person overhearing, and it’s in the press. All Tony’s work to die in peace, all his work to not have people clamoring to try to get in his will – all gone. Poof. “And it was
“Of course.” She smiles at Tony, then at Steve, and turns to walk away.
Clint is at the helm, his hand still on the beaming button, and he’s the first person that Tony sees.
“May I join you?”
The words give Steve pause, the space of a few breaths. He somehow doubts that’s what Tony is really asking. “You’ve all been doing fine—”
do that. Steve,” Tony shifts forward, hands finding the table separating them. He knows his eyes are probably wide, crazed. The fast of an uptick in heartrate cannot be healthy. “Steve, you can’t take the ship from me. You can’t. Please don’t. Please.”
Or Steve’s insane. Tony certainly seems to think so, given the look he had shot Steve the third time Steve asked if he was okay.
“Actually, we don’t want anything.” Tony’s eyes open in surprise involuntarily.
Tony would have allowed that to happen without protest.
Much as he tries to ignore it, to forget it, his genetics allow him comparatively little sleep, combined with comparatively large multi-tasking abilities.
His eyes halt.
He looks forward, and there’s Steve – bruised and frowning, but awake.
“A gift,” the alien explains. “A thank you for stopping the plague from the grand council. Consider this an open invitation to come back whenever you please.”
“Indeed.” Tony nods. Someone on his right begins to immediately move, and, with a quick glance, he realizes its Bruce.
“Aw, that must have been traumatic for you,” Steve says.
Tony and Steve both whirl around, and Steve immediately goes into a defensive stance, which
Extremely close, though ‘friend’ was more accurate than ‘butler.’)
It’s a hard thing to deal with, being so utterly known. He feels exposed, like that outer-mask he never takes off is just invisible, like he’s wearing one less layer of clothes, and there’s nothing he can do to cover himself.
“Hm,” Tony says, and brings his fingers to his chin, stroking it like a James Bond villain. Actually, he would make a
Tony feels a heavy weight of someone staring at him. He looks up and sees Steve, which is unsurprising, given they’re the only people in the back.
He can feel the bond pulse through his mental shield. A Vulcan bond, a mental bond, a bond he would not sacrifice for his life.
“Saved her,” Steve answers promptly. “Bruce said she will make a full physical recovery, and with some counseling—”
He asks JARVIS, gets a confirmation of the gym, then thinks,
He wants to say,
“No,” Tony immediately denies. “Though shouldn’t
On the fourth night after Steve’s-not-avoiding-me-and-causing-me-to-have-a-mental-breakdown-alone-in-my-room, Tony’s struggling to sleep once again. He gives up after about twenty minutes and makes his way down to the kitchen, hoping that maybe some tea or something will help. When he enters, he almost stops and turns around.
There’s one cat who doesn’t seem to get the memo that Tony’s just a spectator, climbing up on the kitchen counter next to him and batting her head into his hand. He pets her absently, scratching behind her ears and playing with her fur.
He could feel the blocked bond pulsating all the while. He refused to tap into it, refused to acknowledge it, refused to see what chord his supposed-death had struck (perhaps, too afraid to think it had been nothing), but one evening as he was watching the sun set, so large it took up nearly half the sky, he could feel the shift.
“That would be highly illegal,” Coulson says mildly. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone. Tony watches as he bends down, places his phone by his foot, and then ties an already tied shoe. He stands, phone still on the ground.
“SHIELD?” Steve asks.
“Yeah,” Tony says, turning back to the toaster. “You’re less sulky. Happier most days.”
“Sure, J,” Tony answers, not thinking.
“What do
were Captain America?”
Tony can’t hear it, the music drowning it out, but he can see it. Steve shakes with it, his head pitching forward, his smile wide and eyes filled with mirth, and—
He fits it on the little thing, though it squirms, and makes minor adjustments to the size. His eyes are good for immediate re-calculation, and he has some experience in prosthetics, which allows him to make the thing functional within five minutes.
“Seventy years. It’s what, 2010?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony interrupts. “But
“Steve,” Tony says, softly. “You’re my captain.”
Tony’s first instinct – why – is mostly rude, so he simply nods and moves over on his work bench.
The loneliness of a child with the guilt of an old man.
” Tony asks wearily.
Steve’s face contorts. “Well, what do you mean by—”
Steve watches in silence as Tony poorly tries to turn mostly cooked sunny-side-up eggs into something edible. His mind is flashing through images of his past life – Peggy, his mother, Bucky, the train, his outfit, old training facilities, the grocery store he used to go to, repairing socks by the stove in winter – like his brain is trying to make up for the days he spent moving on. His first instinct is relief – relief that maybe he actually will be okay. It’s followed by a close friend of Steve’s – guilt.
The Inevitable folder pops up, and Tony freezes in place. He had forgotten.
“There must be other options.”
He expanded and expanded and expanded – light years and planets and colonies and wars, media appearances and software, diplomacy and trade. The emotional, flamboyant Vulcan became a status symbol, someone you’d request to come to your planet to simply show your wealth, your prestige.
It takes a second, but once Steve fully processes that sentence, he really wonders how you can have a meeting in Japan and not leave more than a week in advance.
“Yeah, why do you care?”
It’s almost unthinkable.
“Might be a problem if you want to keep your Captaincy long-term.”
“Commander Stark,” says Romanoff, ever the consummate professional. “You’ll have three days of sick leave. I expect you back on duty for the alpha shift.”
” Steve looks up.
“I couldn’t explain the half of it,” he says. His tone has been noticeably tight since he came up, but this is the first time it wavers in some emotion - sadness, frustration, Steve can’t name it.
“Now, this seems to be the kind of mission you would enjoy,” Steve says with a grin.
“You’re on a ship in the Atlantic,” Coulson answers.
“She actually could have been quite a bit more pissed. I’m relieved. Wouldn’t want you to get the right impression about what she thinks of me, or anything.”
Steve shakes his head. “Do you have an off switch?”
“It’s about something?” Steve asks.
“This is getting old,” Steve says.
“Really? When did you turn Amish?”
Steve blinks down at him. “What does that matter?”
It’s just too damn
Steve’s brow furrows as he looks into space, and, after a moment, he looks down at his stocking feet and says, “I don’t remember.”
“Cap,” Tony replies. “Got to get some – what are you holding?”
The first five items are the most important:
“Captain Rogers broke it in half and threw it at Mr. Vanko’s head, sir. I believe it is currently wedged three feet deep into the south wall, underneath the painting of Venice.”
He rubs his thumb lightly over Steve’s knuckles. Steve gives no reaction, but doesn’t pull away.
Stark Industries!” Hammer cries. “Your father made it what it was – a successful weapons company, and then you just decide on a
“I don’t have time.”
He turns, baffled, and hears Steve’s voice coming through the metal of door, “Tony, let me in.”
Steve is looking at him like he’s certifiably insane, but, after a moment of just bewildered staring, Steve smiles.
“Anyway,” Tony continues, oblivious to Steve’s mental shifting. “I shut that down last year. We’re exclusively in technology and renewable energy. It’s going splendidly, if I do say so myself, which I do, because I designed it all. Anyway, I was CEO for a long time, now I’m not. Also got a bit of a superhero job on the side.”
“Who would?” Natasha asks the air.
“Uh-huh.”
Back in his private quarters, the silence is deafening. His breath is heavy, and eyes are moist. He feels like he’s being crushed under the weight of possibility, of the knowledge of what is somehow available to him, what he can’t let himself have.
“My room is fine, Tony,” he replies. Experience tells him that Tony’s ‘too much’ gene often surfaces with redesign projects – be it hardware, software, building updates, or on one memorable occasion, an attempt at making Steve’s suit camouflage to the background like a chameleon (which, to Tony’s credit, technically worked. The first time Clint put an arrow through his shoulder because he couldn’t see who it was in the woods coincided with the last time Steve wore it).
He hits a button on the console, momentarily disabling the shields.
“He could have shared that information with other people!”
Tony grabs an apple and aims it right for Steve’s head, who again blocks it with ease.
“I still wonder about the reactor,” Steve says. With Iron Man’s cameras, they probably already have enough to put him away on attempted murder charges, but adding conspiring with a known criminal couldn’t hurt. “Did you just steal Vanko’s designs?”
“—therapy tactic, I know, I took a counseling course in high school—”
“Yeah, yeah, of course, Pepper. Have I ever given you reason to doubt me before?”
“You were a weapons manufacturer for galactic wars,” Steve answers promptly. He’s staring at Tony, unnervingly intent. “Your whole company was based on the idea of having an apolitical manufacturer. You would make anything for anyone, if the price was right. You inherited it from your father, but five years in, opened up other divisions. You personally spearheaded a robotics and computer software division with an exclusive contract to Starfleet, which angered your investors, and your company suffered revenue loss. Shortly after, you were taken hostage by a Romulan extremist group and tortured for an unspecified reason. When you were released, you shut down the weapon’s sector of the company permanently and quit, joining Starfleet less than a week after you built your own ship to escape from captivity, where you’ve now been serving for the past three years.”
With an internal grimace towards himself, Tony activates the Iron Man suit. Protection – not enough, not nearly enough – but it may make the final moments slightly more bearable. JARVIS is installed; he won’t have to die alone.
Tony’s dwindling patience next to him, and lets out a breath of relief when they finally stumble upon a door with light shining under it.
Tony has always been energetic, but it translates into a fluidity that’s almost graceful. He walks fast, gestures faster, dances around objects in the workshops, juggles instruments from hand to hand, backs up without looking, creates holograms in midair with a complicated twist of his hands.
completely oblivious, completely undeterred.
“Who cares!”
Punching things while thinking nothing is better than sitting in silence while thinking nothing, though Steve could be damned to say why.
“Sir,” JARVIS says. “The reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.”
“How do you know all that?” Steve asks in wonder. The tortonia keeps walking on. “You’re an engineer.”
By the time Steve gets to his shield, JARVIS is telling him to go up to the roof instead of back down to Tony’s workshop.
So Steve finds himself in a word game of what questions to ask that haven’t been poorly tailored.
Steve looks over at him. “It’s, uh. It’s big.”
(When Tony’s eyes opened, the universe was one way.
Tony isn’t sure if Steve leaves to actually sleep or just process, but he lets him go anyway.
“My tolerance,
Steve’s about to pick a fight about that
Tony can’t look at him, not like that, not without his affection and longing seeping through too obviously, so he spins himself in a circle, using the wetness of the grass and lack of friction to propel him, to spin him around, around, around. “Dance, Steve,” he calls. “Isn’t that a human thing? To dance in the rain?”
“No?” His tone turns to the self-loathing. “You never seem to. I try, but it’s not good enough. I can never seem to be good enough. I—You know I have always been like this?” Tony picks up a screwdriver that’s poking up between the couch cushion, spins it between his fingers, and then chucks it across the room. It seems to collide with a toolbox, but Steve doesn’t turn to look.
“No,” Tony interrupts. “No. The risk is too great.”
“You’re
“Really?” His voice is muffled by Tony’s uniform.
“I like a project to focus on,” Tony says, hands never stilling. “Always better with something to do.”
century.”
they had cried.
“Hey, while I’m doing this, would you be a dear and get your shield?”
The one glass turns into two, then into a whiskey, then into a rum, then into some mix that Steve spits most of onto the floor, then a margarita, then something else that he’s sure Tony is making up the name of, then Steve can no longer sit up totally straight on his own.
Steve pulls out his phone and navigates to his contacts, pressing one.
He does consider – how can he not – that telling Rogers could,
“If you mean Steve signed on for a job, starting in two months, then yes, I guess you could qualify it as that.”
“I wasn’t asking you to kiss me to kiss men, Tony,” Steve says slowly. “I was asking you to kiss me for – I meant it as a first of many.”
“No, it’s just not the same. From what I read, that’s not a hill I am willing to die on.”
“Some meeting,” Tony mutters.
“Wanna talk about it?” Tony says, still looking at the eggs.
“Effort,” Steve finishes. “Before, if you wanted to go out, you had to be actually fully dressed. Nice shoes, pressed shirt. Jacket. Women had their hair done. Not to say no one looked bad, but there was this pressure to look together. Nowadays, it doesn’t seem like that holds true.”
“God, why do people keep
Tony nods, once, already ready to leave.
“Have what?” Tony says, careful to keep his tone annoyed and his curiosity completely veiled.
“Okay.” Tony nods. Another long beat, and Tony wonders if Steve had asked him a question sometime that he was supposed to be answering. “What of it?”
“Oh.” She looks over to Tony and gives him a smile that even Steve can tell is fake after knowing her for around twenty-eight seconds. “Not a one-nighter, then?”
He places an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Let’s eat.”
Tony’s actually in the creation stage, now. The machine looks a little bit like an incubator. “What?”
The foot is lowered. “Well, yes. Did you not eat the fruit? Dddful confirmed it was given to you as a thank you gift for saving our colony. A free transportation to visit, whenever you chose.”
“What a load of bullshit. Self-acceptance.” He can feel the self-loathing poisoning his tone. “What’s the point, if you do bad things and then just forgive yourself? I should just stop judging myself and
Steve leans back in his chair. It creaks with his weight, bending slightly, and he can feel Steve’s strong, unwavering gaze on his face, even as Tony studiously stares at the wall behind him.
“I believe the phrase ‘minimizing collateral damage’ was used.”
As not informative as it is, Tony’s getting the picture.
“Want me to break in? Take a looksie down there?”
Tony raps his knuckles against the door before leaving, which Steve’s learning is his version of a goodbye.
Tony stands behind the transporter console, fingers drumming. He isn’t usually requested to be on many away missions, which allows him a certain (large) number of hours to devote to his own personal projects, so long as they don’t interfere with his duties.
Which Tony would say was pathetic, except Tony had watched him do it, so he really doesn’t have a leg to stand on there.
“That and tracking down my weapons,” Tony adds on. Steve looks a little blank, so he clarifies, “I shut down the weapons manufacturing part of Stark Industries, and I created Iron Man to help me track down where all the weapons went that have my name on them that were sold out from under me.”
“Hey,” Tony greets cautiously. He stops in front of Steve’s desk. “You rang?”
“It was an EMP blast. Everything tech stops working within 100 feet. Most efficient way to ground them all, even if it had to ground me too. They would break on crashing, I wouldn’t. Or mostly wouldn’t,” Tony amends. “It’s fine.”
“Isn’t that a little loud? Flashy?” Tony asks, as they’re preparing to go.
There’s no ache like the ache loneliness churns in your soul. In that cold evening, he was a moment away – an agonizing moment – from taking his PADD, signing his resignation letter, sending it to Starfleet, and taking Stark Industries back under his wing, just to have Pepper back in his daily life, just to have Rhodey a call away, just to have people he knew in the halls and someone to nod to in the morning. He had placed the PADD down with unsure hands and fallen into a fitful sleep.
“Oh, sorry, Tony.”
His hands are free from the mysterious black checkerboard problem, but his neck occasionally shows signs. This mostly means that Steve spends an inordinate amount of time staring at Tony’s neck – but he often finds his gaze wandering, traveling down the shape of Tony’s shoulders, following around his chest, noting the build of his muscles, then moving back up to his brown, soft looking hair. And so Steve continues cataloging, spending time noticing the differences between Tony’s smiles, his gaits, his way of walking, his way of gesturing, his expressions.
And so he stares at the ceiling.
He finished explaining the botany examiner - which he was dubbing ‘the aloe-lujiah’ simply for his own amusement - and handed it off, with a promise to forward specs, the Avenger's database, and keep in touch for questions. Several minutes later, he found himself standing underneath the bright, hot sun.
“It can’t be deactivated.”
“It,” Clint says, with feeling. “Was awesome.”
“Rhodey, this is Steve. He’s a SHIELD agent who is staying with me for CLASSIFIED reasons. See, I can have classified projects too, it’s not just you, Mr. Airforce man.”
It takes a few days, but Tony’s leaning against a wall inside a medical room, bare except for the necessities, with Coulson sitting in a chair at the bed, both of them staring at a slowly breathing Steve Rogers.
“Your chief science officer will be Thor—”
There’s a silence, and he knows he is being a total dick.
“Can you not be nice? It makes this worse.”
These moments, no matter what else happens in the day, are always the highlight.
“Because I care about you?” Steve answers, like it’s a question.
And here he is, all the way to year 39, staring down at JARVIS’s report on his blood toxicity levels, and he feels a twitch of helplessness once again.
“Tony. You’re the reason I’ve
“Okay, but that’s not a plan—Tony!” Steve exclaims, watching in dull horror as Tony blasts through the fence with a repulsor. “You shouldn’t give away our position!”
Tony laughs, once, in disbelief. “Stop the bad guy at the cost of the Starfleet mission parameters.”
“Join the club, sister.” Tony winks at her. “Wasn’t assigned mandatory counseling because it’s
A shadow passes over Steve’s face, and it takes a moment for Tony to identify it as embarrassment. “You don’t have to. And it doesn’t have to be right now. It’s just an art exhibit featuring some of Earth’s famous art pieces. You had said a few weeks ago that you always wished you knew a little more Earth history.” He shrugs, clearly still a little uncomfortable. “It features restored paintings. There’s some chemistry involved. I thought it might interest you.”
“Steve,” JARVIS says, interrupting his list making. “Sir requests your presence in the workshop. He needs some of your health information in order to create the machine.”
“So that’s why you’ve dedicated your life to technology? To bring about good?”
Part of it is something left over from Afghanistan. He’d probably need a professional to properly say, but ever since coming back and having his world view shifted like spinning a head 180 degrees, he just hasn’t had a major interest in being a public figurehead anymore. He likes building tech, he likes designing, he even likes blowing up weapons of destruction in terrorist cells. He does not, however, particularly like landing the Iron Man armor in the middle of a giant party and having people paw at it while he sips on a mojito. One day, he probably would have. And it’s easier to pretend that he still does. But, honestly, it’s a relief to count those days behind him. It’s like taking off a mask that’s been on your face for forty years – he can finally breathe.

Natasha rolls her eyes again. “He asked the gatekeeper for entrance to slaver’s bay, and when he was denied, he pretended to want shake the man’s hand in goodbye, then grasped his hand, bent his arm 180 degrees back, pushed him into a wall, cracking the man’s skull on the stone, then, through the man’s screams and disorientation, grabbed the key from his breast pocket. Then, when he noticed that there about 50 keys on the ring, he forcibly jerked the
He stares at it for a second.
“I have exhausted my intelligence on this. No one at that acronym is smarter than me.”
The picture he gets of Tony is complex and odd and dynamic and hard to put in a box – and, despite himself, he’s slightly intrigued.
“Are you sure?” Steve asks doubtfully.
Steve realizes he’s been watching them argue with bacon halfway to his mouth for about a full minute, and drops it, embarrassed, to his plate, and just catches Pepper’s incredulous, “Have you been drinking?”
“Gonna close the distance, Mister America?” Tony asks. He hopes Steve can’t tell how hard his heart is beating in his chest.
“The people…” A hesitation. “Look different. They definitely dress differently.”
“Where were you today?” Tony demands immediately. God damn it. He sounds like a wife who thinks her husband is cheating with his busty secretary. “And why didn’t you tell me?”
“If you hold yourself responsible for everything you could have but didn’t change, you’ll drive yourself mad.”
the antidote.”
Steve’s feet hit the floor.
“It’s slow, sir.”
cover isn’t blown, and my palm is getting itchy, right—”
Coulson turns back to Steve, who is now looking at Tony, something evaluating in his gaze. Once Coulson starts talking again, it takes a moment for Steve to look back. “We’d give you anything you need.”
“Jesus fucking Christ, you have fast reflexes,” Tony says. He has one knee on the ground, but he stands without trouble, doing a visible body shake.
“How long have I been down?”
“Yep,” Tony says, and then raps his knuckles against the reactor.
But Tony prides himself being a
The elevator opens, and there’s Tony, surrounded by his blue holograms that Steve doesn’t truly understand how work. To his credit, though, he doesn’t think
“Okay, that’s it, I’m calling it.”
Something in Tony’s stomach sours.
“Good for her,” Tony says, and means it. “She always had a good eye.”
“Why not before?” he asks, thinking of his mother and her pale, dying skin, so easily saved by modern medicine.
“You’re a selfish asshole,” Tony says. He shakes his head in feigned disappointment, with his real emotion of wanting to break down in tears of frustration and helplessness being pushed down down down deep. “You’ve taken away the dignity of
“Her wife?”
And then Tony cries.
“Make another, JARVIS,” Tony requests. One pops up on the other end of the closet, and Steve jumps out of the hole, feet sopping wet, and runs – runs fast, too fast for a closet, and comes to a skidding halt in front of the puddle, before taking a leap, sending the water flying.
Tony knew Steve was different type of person, but he didn’t realize he was a different type of
“Hey JARVIS,” Tony says. “Open up project ‘Inevitable.’”
first car didn’t have automatic windows.
Apparently over 2 weeks without a public appearance from him is concerning.
“See if I make you any custom designs again,” Tony says into his shirt, words muffled.
Steve makes his way to over to Tony’s side of the desk, and sits up on it, looking down at Tony.
“Hey Miss Potts, not to be a total dick, but given I am no longer in the company, was there something that you called about that pertains to me?”
Tony grabs the bottom of Clint’s uniform, tugging it incessantly until Clint looks over, and then points.
Unable to help himself, Tony bounces on the balls of his feet. “So? What do you think?”
It’s about one PM when he hears the door open.
Steve’s drunk enough to consider grabbing his hand for emphasis, but still aware enough to think better of it. “Thanks for this.”
He wakes up, thinks,
From behind him, he hears a noise.
Tony loves him – he really does, truly, in a way he’s actually gained up the courage to admit to himself – but dear fucking god if he
“I don’t care about any of this anymore, it’s boring, it doesn’t matter—”
“Stark, what are you doing in the armor?”
It’s disconcerting and makes him breathe a little funny, but he just says, “How flattering, I’ll be sure to write that in my Strawberry Shortcake Diary,” even though it’s a moment he’s probably not going to ever forget.
He gets a little intense about people he loves, he knows that, and this isn’t the first time that’s manifested around Tony.
he was being told.
“Hi Tony,” he greets.
She holds his eyes, but taps the insignia on her chest. “Captain Rogers, this is the Avenger. Request status.”
“Classified,” Tony says with a grin. “But I’m just warning you. I’m not a good idea for personal investment.”
“We’re wasting time,” Coulson interjects. And he’s right – of course he’s right. “There’s billions of lives on the line. Can you do it, Tony?”
He’s written them all goodbye letters that he know will be delivered after he goes.
“No, no, no, no, no,” Tony interrupts, waving a finger in midair. “No. That’s not what I meant. The
That’s probably a bad sign.
“Wait.” Tony lowers his hand from his face. “I think I have a plan.”
“And then, before I can blink, there’s no one left standing, and half of them look unconscious, and half are groaning, and one’s
Steve also volunteers at the local VA and an animal shelter, because of course he does.
“Everyone underestimates me!”
Tony lifts his other arm and pulls Steve closer.
Steve hesitates. The reason is awfully personal – but it’s not a secret, so whatever. “When Bucky died—” Tony noticeably stills, though he doesn’t look up. “I tried to get drunk in a bar off French wine. I couldn’t, of course. Seems like it’s only fitting.”
“Yeah, people do that. Blueberry?”
“Are we on the same page, then?”
“Tony, we shouldn’t let this fester—”
It’s the kind of goodbye that’s going to hit, right where it hurts, over and over and over.
Steve grabs his shoulder, and the bond sings for completion. “If it’s a possibility, I just have to – is it me?”
Steve’s heart picks up a few extra beats a minute.
“The drones looked like throw away schematics of the Mark II,” Steve inputs. Tony’s faceplate snaps over to him, but he’s watching Hammer’s scowl deepen, and he feels a righteous bit of satisfaction. “Maybe a couple of years ago that would have been state of the art, but it just seems behind the times now.”
after what just happened, it’ll be a circus.”
“Please don’t make me do this.”
and it's
“I’m fine. JARVIS, unmute.”
He’s good at this – or, he used to be good at this.
Tony wants to add.
“Hey, Steve,” Natasha says. They’re both standing a bit away, watching Doom be taken into a SHIELD van. “Do you want to go to the gun range with me soon?”
An alien – a Flualli, most likely – stands nearby to greet him. “Commander Stark,” they say, and then let out a loud squawk, along with raising and lowering their right foot. They have green-tinted skin, four arms, and are covered head-to-feet in a large tunic that looks like its sole purpose is to block the sun’s rays.
“Alright then.” Tony claps his hands together, rubbing them in a Disney-villain like glee. “Let’s head in.”
“Tony,” Steve says carefully. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Mindlessly, he looks over the suit. Red and gold, his uniform colors. The control panels. The database that stores medical information. The repulsor beams. The storage container.
when Rhodey speaks up from behind them, where the elevator had opened completely unheard.
“JARVIS, alert the cops. Seems like an open and shut revenge plot soiled. I’m sure the property damage and embedded weapon and JARVIS’s recordings will be enough to convince them for breaking and entering and attempted murder charges.”
seems underwhelming and far too much all at once.
He normally would, probably. He’s never related well to others and playing nice has never been a skill he’s listed on a resume. People are boring. Spending every waking moment with one person just trying to get to know someone?
(Here’s when Tony learned he wasn’t normal:
In retrospect, Tony isn’t sure why he takes the call.
“Hm.” Tony picks up an orange out of the fruit bowl on the kitchen counter. He juggles it once, twice, and then suddenly chucks it at Steve’s chest as hard and quick as he can.
“It’s just—” Tony says. He’s staring down into his noodles. “You ever accept something as fact? So you grow used to it, and it’s fine? Not fine, but fine? But then something changes and you realize you really, really
“Well, he’s wrong.”
She goes on to explain an intricate, painstaking process that includes cleaning the painting with q-tips dipped in a chemical solution purposefully curated for this sole purpose, to only eliminate dirt and not interact with the paint. After the cleaning, the painting is removed from the frame, and all dirt from the back is brushed away. Any parts damaged are repaired by sewing strings of linen in, literally thread by thread, until the canvas is repaired. After, the painting is retouched with original paint, millimeter by painstaking millimeter.
“Is that an insult or compliment?”
Steve stares at him a second, obviously not expecting the lack of reply. He pulls the PADD up to reading level, and reads: “The Tarsus IV fungus. First appearance: 2246. Planet of origin: Unknown, suspected Tarsus IV.  Antidote: Available as of 2248. Created by A. Stark of planet Vulcan. Antidote formula released to public and made fully accessible.”
“I did research into what the bond is, Tony. How could you—”
“It’s been days since I thought about him. Weeks since I felt guilty over his death. I think I am moving past him, which feels…” Steve shakes his head. “Wrong. Like an insult to his memory.”
When he found out about the t’hy’la bond, one of his first actions was contacting T’Prynn. The conversation had been 1 minute, 21 seconds long. When Tony had filled out the Starfleet forms for change of relationship status, he didn’t think twice about quickly jotting down a
“Oh ho ho, look who’s good at summing up US politics,” Tony says gleefully.
Could be any.
“Commander.” He shakes Natasha’s hand and looks her in the eye. “I’ve heard you were promoted from security when Captain Coulson and First Officer Hill received their promotions.”
“Flashy and loud isn’t—”
“What—” she goes to ask, but Tony cuts her off.
“Thank you,” Tony says solemnly. He taps the watch on his right wrist, waiting for the iron man suit to move up his arm. He carefully stows the gift in a small compartment of his suit, made for excess parts but useful for circumstances such as these.
“Yeah,” Steve says, totally sure and warm. He tilts his head back, and lets the rain fall on his face.
Steve had wanted to talk about a lot more than that – why does he hate you, when did that start, did he ever make an attempt on your life before, how were you able to tell it was Hammer in the first place, do you have proof we can take to the police, is tracing him legal, where is he in the building, what’s the plan when we get in there, did you hurt anything when you fell, why are you acting like it doesn’t matter than you almost died – but Tony had put up a hand almost immediately, said that he had to make some calls, and then spent a half hour talking with Pepper about damage control around the tower. It sounded like they have to make a public statement about it, someone had to pay for the tower’s clean up, media outlets wanted proof that Tony didn’t die with the fall – and other boring, necessary stuff that had Steve sighing to himself and toning out Tony’s voice.
“Tony?” A pause, so pregnant, so hesitant, then, “You rejected the bond?”
him there.
“—fix this, and of course it’s boring, it’s work, Tony—”
“War sucks? Love’s hard?”
There’s other stats too. A slightly warmer area than the rest of the snow, about in the shape of a human body. A very, very slight biomagnetism reading consistent with the human body that he can only tell exists because he got bored five weeks ago and put a superconducting quantum interference device into the suit.
“I don’t know what to say to you,” Tony admits. Choices, possibilities, flip in front of his eyes, like a computer showing files, and Tony goes through, through, through them.
He was joking, of course – his early days of pleasure planets and love of tropical climates is well documented by the media, and it was bound to arise in any search of him. To his surprise, Steve colors.
“Wow,” Tony says after a drawn moment. “Don’t like being told what to do, eh.”
“Is he?” Rhodey asks Steve, who has just been standing and awkwardly leaning against the wall for the last few minutes of the interaction.
Tony shoots one of his repuslors straight at one, and it explodes into a thousand pieces, littering mechanical pieces all over the rooftop.
“I mean, yes, there’s that. But it’s the men too. They all look different. There’s so much less…” He trails off, looking uncertain.
Tony picks at the pieces.
“It’ll be in a controlled environment. Just me and you, in the lab, my bar with the finest selection. Thor would stand guard, he’s already agreed. Be at a Thursday, middle of the month, 2pm – statistically the least likely time that we’re called out for Avengers business.”
Tony looks up, trying to think of a crack to diffuse the awkwardness he just
He finishes attaching it onto the tortonia, its little legs moving in the air as he does so. When he places it down, it starts to waddle away, far faster than it was before the extra leg. Tony watches it, satisfied, as it makes its way into the ocean.
“I doubt it.”
“I am
“I’m not going to apologize for trying to save you, Tony,” Steve interrupts, too sure, too firm.
“I suppose,” Jarvis had said, when Tony had questioned him later. “He may feel cheated.”
“Yeah, and broken like, four ribs and maybe got a concussion. I got JARVIS to run the numbers, I would have been fine. What were you thinking, trying to catch me?”
There’s a mechanized noise, which Steve idly catalogues as Tony stepping out of the armor.
“Why’s that?” He’s so bad at being tender, but he places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, and is relieved when it isn’t shaken off. “I’ll leave if you need me to. But I’d rather know.”
Everyone turns to stare at Steve, who nods with a clenched jaw.
Tony looks surprised at Steve’s jumpiness.
“I slept for 70 years. I think I have my fill.”
“Well, for both our sakes, we better hope he’s not bigoted against other species.”
He thinks of a darkly filled box, and thinks,
They watch as the tortonia walks, ambling, towards the ocean, leaving tiny little footprints in the sand. He isn’t even half the size of Tony’s shoe.
“Clarify.”
“He was a
“Steve Rogers. You can copy any personal details from any history books about Captain America.”
,” she barks, and the line goes dead.
That’s as much of a yes as he’ll probably ever get.
“Hey,” Tony objects. “Don’t choose based on me. This is your thing, your pet.”
“Tony,” Coulson says sharply. “Stop talking.”
And then he laughs.
And then Tony laughs.
He winks, and she smiles blandly at him. “Actually, Mr. Stark, if I could come in—”
“See, Hammer, this is why you don’t even crack to Fortune 300. You’re short sighted. I consider that a personality defect.”
Tony places his soldering iron down on the bench, then turns it off. “
It’s Tony’s tower, after all, and he treats it like it is. Not that he’s rude, or at least not in the way the media often paints him, though he does have the rather annoying habit of not checking the time, and almost never taking into consideration that you might be doing something else.
Bruce frowns. “Are there people still like that?”
Steve blinks. He can’t remember. He looks down at his hand, and there’s his notebook, still there.
Tony had looked it, said, “Very Dali-esque, nice.”
Steve just raises his eyebrows and hands over a folder, which Tony takes with as much disrespect as he can muster, because he still hasn’t talked to this therapist about that ‘pretending not to care’ thing, and opens it.
animals, because he doesn’t – they’re soft and cute and good to pet and he can appreciate something that hangs around no matter what he does and can’t understand a word he says – but they’re work and take attention and he really, really doesn’t want to hurt something on accident just by not paying attention, so Tony hides out in the kitchen and watches as Steve cements himself as America’s perfect hero by letting a baker’s dozen tongues lap all over him.
He wonders if this means Tony’s just a highly emotional guy, or if it means he shouldn’t take anything he says seriously.
“And strand us down here, you with no protection,” Clint points out.
“Why?” Tony asks, tipping towards befuddled. Steve gets up in arms about the strangest things. “The trash is in the room, they’d still make my eyes water from there. I might as well just put them in a vase, then.”
“It’s ready?”
However, he could hear a soft melody floating from the room. It wasn’t any music he was familiar with, though it was noticeably Terran, and if his history lessons had any merit, probably from the mid-20
“Okay. You're staying. But, hey, maybe we could send a butterfly back? And then like, one of us could go into the future and see what’s changed. Just think of the science on a
There’s a thousand questions he can think of, and he’s not even an expert in biology. Different scenarios and possibilities ran through his head all night, and the image of the body lying there on the floor spins and spins and spins.
Case in point, the doors to the elevator open, and Tony’s talking before he even steps out. “You’re not happy here, are you?”
“Visit?” Tony repeats dumbly.
“You don’t know?” Steve repeats. A pulse of irritation filters through the bond. Tony breathes through an unsurprised sigh. “That plague killed thousands of innocent Earthlings. Children. Half a population almost starved to death, and the other half were slaughtered. They weren’t at war. And you knowingly sold a weapon to someone with that purpose?” His grip on the PADD is becoming increasingly tight. “There’s apolitical, and then there’s amoral.”
The Flualli steps up to one of the first stalks, and, with their top left hand, pulls at the bulb. It detaches easily and begins to disintegrate in their palm. They offer their hand to Tony, who takes it gently.
Emotions can be dulled. That – that is something Vulcans have whittled to a science. Isolation. Lack of friends. Focus on logic, math, numbers. Extreme dedication to tasks. Bond-mates chosen from logic instead of love.
He has to figure a way out of this, a way around Steve’s stubbornness, a way around his original plan. His mind is whirling, working frantically, too frantically, and he takes a second of a deep breath, stabilizes his emotional shields, and starts mentally calculating possibilities.
Steve really doesn’t feel much like eating, but Tony went to the trouble of buying it, and he’s staring at him slightly manically, and Steve’s feeling uncomfortable and tired but he’s got to
“I see you’ve been told of my arrival,” Tony greets, and sticks out his foot, mirroring the gesture. He isn’t entirely sure if it was the right move, having half-heard the debrief before transporting, but the Flualli looks pleased.
In the end, he decides on a fairly small black limo with tinted windows.
“—or maybe it was earlier, who knows, really—”
Steve’s just sitting next to him, hands folded, staring off into space.
“You heard me.”
gonna stop my heart. Wow, it sounds much more cannibalistic when I put it that way.”
And Tony had thought:
“You give my life meaning, doll,” Tony drolls.
Steve asks to skip the final dinner. He just can’t imagine having to sit there with all his teammates, his friends, knowing he won’t do it again.
Tony had not been sitting on his lap or knee, as it wasn’t the Vulcan way, but he remembers peering up at his father, the distance between them large. “But isn’t that still participating?” Tony had asked.
They tie him to a support pole with some wire on a table and a complicated knot that Steve can’t even begin to follow.
“With me?” Tony asks, bewildered.
“I figured that part out on my own,” Steve replies. “I did some research, because this all—” He stops and takes a visible short breath. When he continues, his voice is a touch harder. “It didn’t make sense. You never mentioned it. I found just what you had said – childhood betrothal bonds are common, then these half-formed bonds can be fulfilled or dissolved, later on in life. T’Prynn and your bond was announced in Vulcan media back when it happened, and it specifically mentioned the purpose was for political and economic ties. One of the first hits when I searched for T’Prynn was the announcement of her second engagement, to some Vulcan named T’Qaun.”
Steve asks him to come upstairs, and he does, immediately dropping the work, and settles on the couch next to him, where they begin a game of Call of Duty that Tony is definitely going to lose.
Roomba jumps up next to him, batting her head into his stomach, and Tony idly pets her head with one hand as he begins to type with his other.
“Oh, that’s too bad, I don’t get to introduce you to the wonder that is the versatile potato. But no matter, there’s a lot more to try now, a lot better things to try. I ordered in from all my favorite places. It’s great that every place delivers in New York, you know? What a city. A delivered blowie or a bagel in under a half hour if you know who to call. Anyway. Point being, the food is better. You got to try everything.”
“Holyyyyy shit,” Tony’s voice rings out, loud and modulated. He’s in the armor, flying a few feet above the rooftop, and Steve spends a second being stunned to see it finally in action – God, it’s beautiful, it looks like something off a movie screen – before he takes notice of the dozens upon dozens of poorly reconstructed iron man suit drones surrounding the tower, shooting beams of blue light through the windows.
Or, more accurately, some
They’re facing each other – maybe five feet apart – mirroring each other with stances of feet apart and arms crossed, and it feels kind of like the stand-off before an old-west gun shootout.
Clint hits his insignia, hard enough to almost knock it off. “Barton to Bridge.” A second passes. “Barton to Bridge, do you
“We should go,” Steve says, motioning towards the door. “SHIELD wants us gone before they get here, given the whole breaking and entering part.”
Steve had never left Brooklyn before the war, and in the war, he spent most of his time in France and Germany. He hasn’t seen much of the United States in the first place, so Tony has a hankering to show him some of the highlights. The Grand Canyon, Hawaii, Hollywood, Yellowstone, Disney World, Chicago – even some small-town shit, Lord knows that can be sort of interesting, like cool ice cream shops and run-down grocery stores.
made and a very, very unfortunate bit of train engineering.”
“Why would you do that,” he finds himself asking, faintly. “You dumbass. You would have lived.”
“If I talked with Vanko – which I did not – I would assume he wouldn’t care about a shorter sentence. He probably would just need the guarantee that Stark here would be dead.”
There’s conviction, there, and stubbornness, and principle, and backbone, and Tony wonders how this man made it through Starfleet’s filters successful.
“Too shady,” Steve completes. “I want to know what I’m fighting against at all times. I’m not good at taking blind orders.”
section. If anything, he thought the admirals at Starfleet may get a kick out of it, a laugh for the breakroom.
“Huh,” Tony says. “Do you think I could pass that off for modern art to Pepper?”
He didn’t realize he never actually gave Steve an answer on that.
“Captain Rogers,” Coulson says. “From what I have read, you have first-hand experience with these warheads.”
Steve’s not entirely sure if Tony is calling
“Yeah.”
“But this ship – the Veneer – I checked its specs yesterday. I can reroute all the power to the shields. If the nuke goes off inside with the shields at full, the shields will contain the blast fully.” The quiet is thick, the seconds before what’s happening becomes clear sits heavy before them all. “But I have to do the rerouting work from the inside. And the shields can only be activated from the inside.”
“Sir?”
They’re both startled when the door opens.
“Look,” Tony says, turning his hands around, repulsors starting to light. “I got all the equipment you need, right here. I’ll blast a hole inside, jump down. It might be dangerous and this suit will protect me better than anything your agents got lying around. Not to mention I can just fly myself and whatever I find down there out, instead of whatever convoluted master plan you have cooking.”
and that’s when it hits him.
“I’m ready,” says Tony, hand hovering over the shields button. “I’ve rerouted all the power. Once Clint and Cap are in the shuttle and give me the clear, I’ll activate the shields. It’ll be just over ten minutes by that point. Page down to Levonos, let them know the plan – it should give them enough time to take cover, just in case.” And to give himself ten minutes to say goodbye to the stars, not that that matters. “It shouldn’t impact them at all, but we never know.”
And so he’d shared, and Tony had brushed it off, but in that way that means
“Copy, Stark, we’re having a bit of a disagreement,” says an extremely irritated Coulson.
Steve leans forward and pats him on the knee. “You’re a smart man – you figure it out.” He stands and stretches, and his back makes an audible pop. He lowers his arms, and the smile slowly trickles out of his face. “Well, I should probably head off to bed.”
“Brought me?” Tony interrupts. “Excuse you, I came. You didn’t bring me anywhere. And look, I can just—” He aims a repulsor at the topside of the plane and shoots, the bright blue light cutting through the metal like butter. Coulson squeaks slightly, and Tony wonders how he can hear it above the snow and wind, but when he looks back, Coulson only looks mildly sickened. “Way faster, right?”
thinking about it, and just living his life. He can’t imagine what he would have done if Steve hadn’t been there for him to throw his reckless hopelessness into. All that time, effort, and concentration that’s gone into keeping Steve distracted has had the wonderous effect of keeping Tony distracted.
It’s been mostly abandoned since Steve came into his life. He’s been so enjoying
Once Steve gets over being a little bitch, he’s actually kind of great.
“Well, are you excited?”
“Communication must still be down. Merde, fuck, shit.” Steve’s still below him, and red, warm blood is still seeping out from underneath Tony’s palm. “Okay, look, Clint, I know this isn’t protocol, but I have an idea to save him.”
And not even because Tony is an energy-holic who a fourth grader would have a hard time keeping up with.
She taps it again. “Rogers, status update
“No, no, I don’t mean—” Steve swallows. “I felt slightly bad asking you to accompany me here. I thought you’d be bored. But you find something good in anything.”
Steve looks like he would like to press, but he swallows his words.
Tony slides his hand out of Steve’s, and feels it again, bright and painful and loud.
so much more, it has him
“Well—” Steve looks like he’s biting his tongue on something. “Look, do you trust me?”
“What?” he asks, a little self-consciously.
“She’s safe. What more matters?”
“Oh, Captain Crunch, you’re here, fabulous. So, I was doing some research last night into what it was like back in your days, and something that kept coming up was the food. You guys boiled and canned everything. And without globalization, I bet you’ve never tasted anything but ‘American’ food, which isn’t really a cuisine at all, just kind of mishmashes of other, better stuff, except maybe southern food, but again, that was created by slaves’ culture, so I don’t know how correct it is to really laud that, you know? Though maybe we should appreciate it for its own sake given that, I should really check that out with someone more appropriate than me.”
“I heard you’re taking my houseguest from me,” Tony says, bending down to pick up the screwdriver, and avoiding their eyes.
(Part of being an engineer is rebuilding.
“What, Cap, no words of how much you missed me?”
“Break what to me?”
They talk a lot about what’s going to happen after.
“That’s idiotic,” Tony finds himself blurting. “All that does is rise his hopes that he didn’t miss much. That his life and people will still be there when he gets out. Once you tell him, it’ll be a thousand times worse; you’re giving him hope and then taking it away. What do you think is more likely to make a man dangerous?”
The Captain has a responsibility to oversee all of the departments, and Tony knows Thor made a special request to stop by this planet for a few days to be allowed to study the beach fauna. A request that Steve apparently granted.
He’s worried and upset and even a bit angry, and he isn’t sure which one is the dominant emotion quite yet, so he breathes through them and focuses on being nonchalant, sardonic, and, most of all, uncaring.
Tony scans the drink choices. “I flew in the world’s finest for this. Take your pick.”
