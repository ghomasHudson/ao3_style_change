Books are the foundation of how humans have passed along knowledge for-”
Tony hesitated. “There was another man, with long brown hair. He didn’t make it.”
“No problem!” Tony said, heaving himself back to his feet. “Be back in a second,” he said, patting Brian’s shoulder. Brian grabbed his hand and planted a kiss on his palm.
“I have no idea, scans of them come back blank or as thick smoke. I hate magic. Have I told you how much I hate magic? Our best bet is to separate the guy from his crystal ball, that's what stopped them last time. But it's magic, so who knows, maybe this time it'll open a portal to the raven dimension and we'll have doomed the Earth,” he said bitterly.
“Well, I am a lovely dragon.”
“And I don’t want to lose what we had because you’re afraid of what it could become. We had something really good for a long time. A bitter end doesn’t erase the value of everything before it. Why can’t we pick up where we left off, now that we’re wiser to what went wrong?”
Steve was shocked. They hadn’t had a streak of luck like this for years. A two hundred dollar repair done for free? He wouldn’t turn that down, no matter who was doing the fixing.
“I’m sorry,” he laughed. “You’re just so cute!”
Tony didn’t flinch. “No I won’t. I’m trying to help, if you’d get your head out of your ass long enough to accept it.”
“You’re too much. Put the Coke back and get me the real soda.”
Sam frowned as Tony turned and walked back in. Inside the restaurant everyone had shifted seats so now Steve beside Brian in the seat Tony had originally taken, and Natasha was on Brian’s other side, leaving an open seat next to Steve and one next to Clint.
“That was last night. You were a grouch last night.”
Steve let his head loll to the side, where there was a smear of ash and blood on the concrete where the man had been standing. There were similar spots spread all the way down the street. Gross.
“Your dragon isn’t the only one unsound of heart.”
“I forgot something, I’ll be right back.”
Steve leaned in close enough to whisper, so the sound would be lost to people watching. “Don’t call me Darling.”
“Next time you're in New York, give us a call.”
Tony had thought the rude gesture earlier was a sign of some spunk, or a way to get more attention. Now it was looking like the guy was just nuts.
In the front row Stane crossed his arms and the notary gulped. “It’s fine, he doesn’t have to say anything. Let’s just wrap this up. Steven, Alpha of Rogers pack, do you take Anthony of the Stark pack to be your lawfully wedded husband and chosen mate, and accept him into your pack with no reservations?’
He heard Tony stand up and felt a hand on his arm. “Then I trust you. Lead on, Captain.”
He had approached it from behind a piece of rubble and opened fire, tearing it open in a splatter of blue blood. The alien turned on him and ripped him open with inch long claws, and they had fallen to the ground together, blood mixing to purple and soaking into the dusty street. Steve felt himself growing weak, and closed his eyes for the last time, glad to go out protecting his country.
Oh God, Steve was going to murder him, he was actually going to murder him. Tony turned tail and ran, charging down the hallway as Steve yelled at him and the other contestants held him back.
“Hey, you’re the guy who wrote the Brooklyn article for the Stark travel book?”
Clint held out two fingers and tapped them as he said the names. “The boy from 9, Raza, and the boy from 7, Ivan. Natasha and I ran into Ivan, he got us a few times with his whip before Nat took it and used it to tie him to a tree. That's the last time we saw him.”
Steve nodded and dropped his hand, convinced.
Tony threw out his arms, ignoring the proffered bag. “What if it wasn’t like that? What if our wolf sides weren’t uncontrollable?”
Steve stood up abruptly, cutting him off. “Thank you for your time. I need to get going now.”
Steve sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck, and hope he wasn't still red. “I'm sorry about that, please ignore them. They're trying to help set us up, since they think I'm hopeless.”
“I came down to tell you lunch was ready, that’s all.”
“Well, I’m afraid that you’re still $300 short.” Stern said, leaning forward and looking at Tony with some concern. So when Tony sprung up, he tipped over backwards in his chair with a startled noise. Tony grabbed the check from the table and flipped it over, slamming it back down to reveal that they had more than enough. His voice was loud and obnoxious and arrogant and yet somehow Steve had never found him more charming.
“You’ve had a rough time lately, I’m trying to help. And I missed you.” Tony let him go with a sigh and a pat to his shoulder. “Follow me. I like to make modifications on the mech suits and it goes faster when you help.”
Steve stared at him in shock, then lunged forward and kissed him again. This time Tony responded eagerly. The door opened behind him then immediately shut. In the hall Steve could hear Natasha telling everyone that they had managed to work it out. She was going to tease him for this later, but right now, with Tony smiling and kissing him, he couldn't bring himself to care.
The younger two stood up with a cheer. They rushed over to pat him on the back, and yap excitedly at Steve. He shooed them away with a laugh. “Watch the cows! Don’t let Dottie get out!” He grabbed Tony’s arm. “Let’s go, let’s go! Before a meteor crushes the truck or the check spontaneously combusts or something!”
Tony put down a soldering iron and turned around. “Hey Steve! Yeah, I did, I know you guys weren't thrilled with them being up there.”
For now he went back to the room they used to share, and the door opened with a woosh. It used to push open, now it was electric and sealed tightly. That was the only change he could see. Stepping into the room made him blink, because everything was the same. It looked like they had gone down for breakfast and now we're coming back up to finish getting ready for the day. The bed was neatly made; between Steve’s mom training as a nurse and his time in the army, and Tony’s long stint in boarding schools, neither of them could stand to leave it unmade. Mess manifested itself in other ways. Steve’s robe over the back of a desk chair. Tony’s slippers half sticking out from under the bed. Paperwork on the desk, a cup overfilled with pens because when someone offered him a free pen Steve took it, even as Tony whined and offered to buy him nice ones, pens that worked upside down and in space and were heat and waterproof. His desk plant was dead from lack of water. Above the desk was a cork board that Steve had filled with pictures of them and ticket stubs from events they had gone to. After four years the board was covered, with things overlapping and hanging off from the sides and bottom. He opened the closet and Tony’s clothes were gone, leaving it almost empty, with Steve’s stuff filling up barley an eighth of the space. He never got the need to have four black tuxedos when you could wash the one, or having suits of every cut, color, and style because fashion changed seemingly every week, but he also didn’t have to spend twenty hours a week in a suit, so what did he know. He looked in the bathroom and things looked undisturbed there too. Tony’s toothbrush was still in the cup so he must have given up on dealing with moving out at this point and bought new things. Steve went back out and took his shoes off and laid down on the bed. There was no dust in the room, though that could have been because the room was almost airtight at this point and not because Tony was coming back to clean. He tilted his head sideways to look at the clock on the nightstand. It was about noon, the team would most likely be gathering downstairs for lunch. He squinted at the nightstand. It looked wrong somehow. He sat up and pushed the picture frames around. There was a picture of them at Coney island, a picture of the team getting shawarma, a picture of Tony’s birthday….there should have been one more. There had been a black wood frame, with a picture of them on the couch. They hadn’t been doing anything special, they weren’t dressed up. They weren’t even looking at the camera, instead looking at each other with the kind of expression that made Clint make gagging noises at them for being sickeningly sweet. Natasha had taken the picture, and he had liked it so much he had had it printed and put it on the nightstand. Apparently it had been special to Tony too, because it was the only one that was missing.
Steve looked at Tony, then back at Jan who was holding the hammer. He let out a wild laugh. “Yes Jan, what are you doing with that hammer? And- oh my! Whatever has happened to our poor washing machine?” He said, projecting pure innocence.
“I’m glad you did.”
Tony frowned at him. “Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you what I was doing. I knew it would make you upset, so I tried to do it without rubbing it in your face. I got back later than I expected.”
“They’ve all got dots, are they all called Dottie?”
The room fell silent, the size of the task they were trying to accomplish unfolding before their eyes.
“Oh, shut up.” He said with a blush. He should be used to Jan's teasing by now, but anything involving Tony seemed to make him red as a tomato. Jan was loving getting a rise out of him.
“Probably because everything hurts.”
Another man scoffed. Happy, he had worked in the stables. “Those are children’s tales. There’s not a speck of truth to any of it.”
Before, Steve had been keeping his eyes forward and Tony his arms crossed, now they laughed with each other and walked with shoulders relaxed. When they got back to the tower, Tony insisted on opening his gift. Steve had given him some nice coffee and a sketch of DUM-E. It was more of a warm up that turned out nice than an actual finished illustration, and Steve really wished he had put more time into it as Tony hugged the paper to his chest, declared that it was true art, and promised to have it framed and hanging up in his workshop by the next day. Steve had gone into this whole thing really dreading it, and it had ended up being a decent afternoon. Tony was fun to be around when they weren’t fighting. Score one for team bonding, he thought, and went back to his room with a smile.
“I have seen you tend to both Liberty and I with great care, I have seen you risk your life for hers, I have seen you return for your people, and I have seen you volunteer your life for our cause. There is nothing else I need to know. I was interested in earning your affections even before I knew our souls were so closely tied that we could both speak with Liberty.”
“Yeah, that’s been inconvenient.”
“Well, I guess we better go see!” Steve picked him up. It was easier than he expected. He was a big guy, strong from work on the ranch, and Tony was much smaller than the bales of hay he hauled around almost everyday. Tony yelled as he was lifted, and clutched at Steve's shirt. Oh right. This was probably really weird, huh? Too late now, Steve was running with it.
She gave him a death glare. “Steven Grant Rogers, I will kill you with this hammer, just watch me.”
And Tony did what he always did when he didn't know what to say, which was to start rambling in hopes that something that came out of his mouth would fix things, while Clint snickered in the background.
“You’re, um. Quiet.” Steve said hesitantly.
“What do you want from me?”
“Let’s hear it on three! One, two, three!”
Tony blinked at him. That was actually a decent answer.
The rest of the Avenger arrived and the men started to panic. Kane tried to summon more birds, but as soon as they got more than a few feet from their creator they dissolved into mist, Tony's machine still loudly screeching outside. Maxwell threw the hostage at Steve and tried to run for the door, where he was quickly detained by Natasha. Without the birds, the men were no threat. Clint shot the orb from Kane’s hand and it rolled across the floor to Thor, who picked it up, and the few remaining misty birds disappeared. Everyone sighed in relief when Tony shut off his box and the room was filled with blessed silence. Iron Man and Captain Britain soon joined them in the basement.
“Someone find me a phone, I might have a solution for that.”
The basement was cold and felt vaguely damp. Tony followed the thick wires running along the hallway, hoping to find a control room. He turned a corner and froze as he saw a peacekeeper standing in front of a doorway, rifle held loosely, staring straight ahead. At the slight scuff of Tony’s shoe, the peacekeeper’s head whipped around and Tony knew he had been spotted. If he tried to run the peacekeeper would sound the alarm and he would be caught. In a panic Tony charged forward, swinging wildly at the peacekeeper before he had a chance to react. Tony got him in the head, and the peacekeeper fell back into the wall, hitting his head again, his helmet making a sharp ringing sound as it struck the concrete. Tony stood over him panting, clutching his hand where it arching. Tony waited for someone else to come around the corner, attracted by the noise. There was nothing. Tony heaved a sigh of relief. Why had there been a peacekeeper down here anyway? He must have been watching the door to the control room. Tony pushed the door open and it wasn’t a control room at all. There weren’t any wires or computers, and no fuse boxes. Instead there were five tall tubes, covered in a thick layer of condensation. The temperature in the room was significantly colder than the hallway, and Tony started to shiver as he stepped closer to the first tube. He couldn’t tell what they were supposed to be for. They didn’t look like any air conditioner or freezer he had ever seen. Maybe a weapon? There were wires running into the tops of the tubes and coming out to connect with a wide array of machines, all beeping along.
“And who are you again?”
Loki pushed his head back down with the tip of his sword. A drop of blood ran down Tony’s forehead.
He ripped the mask off, but it wasn’t Tony’s face staring up at him. It was his own, half his face covered by the familiar cowl.
Steve shifted back to human from where he lay panting on the ground. Tony helped him to his feet and pulled him into a hug. Steve buried his face in Tony’s hair, breathing in his familiar scent of home and safety.
He started setting that one after he lost a half a days work so he could lie in bed and have a self pity party. Save the grief for weekends was his motto, he'd deal with it then. Too bad cows didn't take weekends. Meant he didn't get weekends. Tony probably took weekends, and holidays too, the lazy bastard. He needed to drive him back today, and he wondered if the truck had enough gas to do it. It was probably rude to ask for gas money when dropping off the pack heir and telling his guardian that despite what they agreed yesterday, he was absolutely unsuitable. Yes sir, sorry sir, didn't work out, I'm a homebody, he likes adventure, I like the country, he likes the city, Im old fashioned and he's so modern, I'm a hard worker and he's too good to boil pasta, I'm a rancher and he's an absolute fucking nightmare. Don't suppose I could keep the dowry and you'd spot me a twenty for the gas I needed to haul him back?
“Fishing maybe? That’s a good idea, we always had good times fishing by the pond.”
“What orders? Sending our resident grandpa in alone is not a plan! There's no way we'll be able to get a clear shot through the birds, he’ll be going in blind with blinder backup, it's unnecessarily dangerous!” Tony insisted.
“Now all the contestants are downstairs switching costumes and getting ready for their interviews. In the meantime, here’s a word from our illustrious President Stane!”
“Hmmm...”
“Go to sleep, and I’ll keep watch,” Steve promised. “I’ve got you, you’re safe now.”
“What?”
Tony stiffened in his chair, his eyes wide.
“His arm? That would be nice.”
“Clint fucked up the math and lied to us how much the bank needed.” he growled, his fist clenched, his face red.
Steve shrugged as he finished pulling his clothes back on. He walked over and offered Tony a hand, pulling him up. “It is a bit of a dump. And it’s unfair of me to ask you to fix it.”
Jan and Clint looked at each other. Jan went to the door and started pulling on her boots. “We’re going outside to check the cows.” Clint quickly joined her.
“-Were you?”
Thanks for reading!
“Do you know what he was talking about?” he asked Christine who was staring at the door, grim faced.
Steve screamed with pure unrestrained joy and flipped the desk. Stern jumped back with a started “Good lord!” as Steve turned to Tony who was laughing uproariously and swept him into a kiss. It had worked out earlier and it worked out well again. They only broke off as Stern started yelling at them about property damage. They broke apart and ran out of the office and down the hall back to the foyer. Steve quickly got a few hundred cash from the teller from their newly full checking account, and they made their escape before Stern could get over his shock and call the cops on them.
“I have told you, the yellow flowers have no medical purpose and no place in my bag. If you will be handing me plants, then I need yarrow.”
He smiled half genuinely and half out of pure nervous panic, then schooled his face and nodded back solemnly.
Steve was collecting the eggs from he barn and humming quietly. The chickens clucked peacefully to themselves outside in the sunlight, pecking the ground for bugs and seeds. Now that he knew Tony was going to stay, he felt lighter than he had in ages. So many of the problems weighing him down had been lifted. Plus now that the air between the two of them was cleared, and they could start over again with a clean slate, maybe start building their relationship to something beyond yelling. Things were looking up for the first time in months, and he felt downright hopeful for the first time since he lost his pack. He finished checking the last of the nests, and walked back inside to put the eggs away.
“Great. We’re not even married and the honeymoon's already over.” Tony said with an exaggerated sigh. He opened the door and got out of the truck, walking around the back to start hauling suitcases out of the truck and into a messy pile on the ground, with Clint and Jan’s assistance. “So did Obie shove a stick up his ass this morning, or is he just always this delightful?”
Too bad he would rather die than beg Steve to take him back, and knowing that put a damper on scenario number two.
“Natasha says a lot of things.” Stupid Natasha. He didn’t know why he ever told her about liking Tony.
Tony was sleeping with Britain.
And they beat Thanos the first time around before he snapped because they were all together and lived happily ever after, the end.
“I’m a fucking werefish! I have a tail and a trident and fish friends and everything!”
“Hey Tony, you moved the chairs back.”
All the same, now that Steve had brought it up his eyes dropped down to Steve’s lips, pink and chapped. Their first kiss had been so short, so unsatisfying. If Steve gave him the chance Tony knew he could do better. Tony licked his lips and grinned as he saw color start to rise to Steve’s cheeks. He stood up quickly, clearing his throat. “I’m the one who suggested it. It won’t bother me, come on.”
Tony shifted, his silhouette just barely illuminated by the starlight coming in from the partially open drapes. In the back of his mind Steve registered the house creaking and the slightest shift of fabric against skin as Tony shrugged. “I dunno. Early?”
“Steve. You’re killing me here. Just read the recipe.”
He pulled his arm away. And looked back at Tony. He was grinning, obviously having heard the whole exchange.
Steve blinked up at him. “Are you real? I saw them drag you away yesterday, and no one comes back once they take you.” He giggled and started singing. “Play the wrong game, back the wrong horse, it’s all the same, they take you away, didn’t say goodbye but I got nothing left to say, it's time for the bad kids to go away.”
“Steve? Are you having one of your days?”
“Yes! Oh my god, this is huge!” She gasped. Clint looked him up and down speculatively. “Well I guess we figured out why Steve’s never had a real partner before, a person’s gotta beat him in combat before he’ll look at them twice.”
He nodded briskly. “Alright. Guess we’ll see you at lunch.”
“What do you mean?” Hammer asked, his eyes still locked on the peacekeeper standing in the corner.
He rolled his shoulders. His back was fine, the lashes he received yesterday already fading into faint scars. Steve’s hand moved down from his shoulder to hover lightly over a closed wound.
If Steve had weighed more than a hundred pounds he would have crushed Tony as he half fell on the bed in his haste to hug him. Tony held him tight while Steve half yelled at him, and half cried in thanks that he was ok.
“Glad we got that cleared up. Take a deep breathe and count to ten there, champ.”
“Please make the room stop spinning,” Steve begged, bunching Tony’s shirt up in his fingers as he tried to orient himself. “They said it was cake and now everything is weird and I don’t like it.”
Steve stumbled then quickly caught back up as Tony strode forward. He put a hand on his shoulder, pulling him to a halt. “You don’t mean that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s nose crinkled as he focused. “I can hear you. I can hear you breathing, I can hear your heart.”
“I love you.”
“Together.”
Steve dropped his hand. “It was worth a shot.” He rubbed at his chest absentmindedly. “I might actually take the stitches out, they’re itching.”
It all started a few years ago when Tony made an Instagram. He had met a hot girl at a party, she had told him to follow her Instagram, saying anyone who was anyone had one these days. Tony was game, and so he downloaded the app and made an account. He followed the girl, and everyone else at the party, setting him up with thirty followers and thirty people to follow. His profile picture was him drunk as hell making a peace sign in the flashing lights of the private club. He forgot about it the next day, until the end of the week when he was in a taxi for the long drive to the airport and had nothing better to do. So, he pulled out his phone to see what exactly this Instagram things was. As he scrolled he got an interesting mix. Some people posted food, some parties, some pets, some traveling. Hey, he was traveling. As he stepped out of the taxi and onto the airstrip, he took a picture next to the jet and posted it on a whim, with no captions. He shut off his phone for take off, and settled in to do some paperwork. Pepper was going to be so happy with him for finishing up the contract for her.
“Friday said Chitari tec,” Steve argued.
“Tell me Captain, what is the name of your companion?” he asked gleefully.
“See you back at the Tower then.” He said with a smile that turned into more of a grimace.
Hearing that was one thing, seeing Peggy again, hale and hearty after a year of seeing her in the nursing home, was staggering.
They immediately headed to the pawn shop. They busted in the door, the bell over head the door almost knocked of its hook. They went up to the front, where the jewelry was kept in a glass display case. The owner welcomed them.
“Cherry, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry or Grape? Any ring you want, nothing is too extravagant for my very own ray of sunshine.”
“We can do lemon. Since you’re going to trust some stranger from the internet over your own boyfriend.”
Surely one minute couldn’t hurt?
“We don’t have the money.” Steve said bluntly. His face felt hot, and he hoped he wasn’t blushing. First they got caught lying, and now Tony was about to figure out just how dead broke they were. Embarrassing.
Was that supposed to make him happy? People loved to watch them suffer, great. He took a breath. He had to be nice while on camera if he wanted to keep the good will of the general public.
“Of course not. I think we should broil them.”
Steve looked over his shoulder to see Sam walk into the room with a wave.
Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “I love you. Avenge us.”
Steve ran into the restaurant where Bucky pulled him into a hug.
"Hey pal, you mind giving me a lift?"
They all took a drink, Tony a couple seconds behind as he struggled to figure out what was going on.
. He knows something we don't, and after the party is over we're all going to go back to our boring houses in this small boring town, and he's going to go somewhere secret and cool and spy on people and shoot bad guys or something.”
“You can have water.” Tony got up and came back with a bottle of water, which he opened and handed to Steve. He took a drink and Tony sat back down with an annoyed huff.
As the Avengers ate, Brian did his best to explain what had been going on.
The more he thought about it the more he realized what a risk this was. He could have gotten trapped in the smoke too, he could have given away his location, he could have welcomed a threat into his safe spot. So far more than half of his interactions with Steve had ended in violence.
There was a low growl behind them and they turned to see Raza, advancing towards them with his knife. Tony pushed Yinsen behind him and picked up a large branch. “You run, I’ll hold him off.”
Tony would just have to make up for Steve. He leaned forward and rested his hands on Steve's shoulders and leaned in so their foreheads were touching. Steve stiffened up but didn’t push him away.
“Spend the next few weeks watching Tony,” he ordered. “Tony, if you break my very reasonable and easy rules, then he’s going to report straight back to me, and you won’t like what happened next. Got it? I made you Game Master and I can take it away just as easily.”
“I’ve told you a hundred times that I don’t like it when you touch my chest.”
"Tony?!?"
Stane yelled for the peacekeepers and no one came, they were all downstairs trying to hold off the rebels at the entrance.
“So. Tony.”
“Yup. And yet, you were still surprised.” Steve kneeled on the bank and reached out his hand to help pull him up. Tony grabbed his hand and put one foot on the wall of dirt. He used the leverage to pull and with a yelp Steve slid into the pond face first. He popped up to the surface with an outraged gasp. “I take it back, you failed initiation.”
He entered the parking lot and scanned the rows of cars, looking for his. It wasn't there. After he had been entered into the Games they must have towed it. How the hell was he going to get to the Capital building?
“Dear SHIELD, thank you for the list of high quality friendship questions. Asking Tony about his favorite color really revolutionized our relationship. After we discussed the seasons I just knew we were going to be best friends for life!!!!”
“We need to quit meeting like this,” the battered man said.
She waved at him frantically, trying to be heard over the growing beeping sound. Beeping? Both Steve and the nearby goon looked down at the chitauri gun in his hands, now beeping faster and faster. They looked back up and shared a brief second of panic before the weapon imploded with a huge bang and everything dissolved in a wave of heat.
“It’s not over! Man up and fix it!” Tony snarled through gritted teeth. Steve slammed a fist into the ground.
Christmas? Tony mentally did the math. Today was what, December 16th? Christmas was a little over a week away. He had lost track of time, he needed to start looking for gifts.
“Tony?”
Thankfully Yinsen didn’t fight him on it.
“I appreciate all the support. We wouldn’t have survived for as long as we did without the gifts from our sponsors.”
What was the first step of camping? Probably set up the campsite. He unpacked his bag to see what he had got. He made a mental list:
“I was trying to take your mind off things, and I’m here now, aren’t I? I’m trying to help.”
His celebration had been short lived. After watching the Howling Commandos along with Bucky die over and over, Steve had become desensitized to it. He hadn’t thought twice about sending them off to distract the guards, because if they got hurt they’d wake up next to him, good as new, the next day.
“It’s impossible.” A tall man said, throwing up his hands.
The door to the complex was propped open, and Tony stepped inside. Inside it was dim and the air smelled moldy. He looked around for a concierge that didn't exist. The only other person in the hall was a man who looked like he had been dumpster diving, currently eating pizza with his dog.
Behind him the judges quickly set the rankings and slid the pad and stylus across the table. Tony looked it over and was unsurprised to see that they ranked Steve last.
“Ah,” Tony said with a wince. Steve sat back down. Of course there was a catch.
Tony laughed at him. “Oh my god your
“I worry about you sometimes, you know that? Let’s both go endure the awkward reunion together.”
Tony was curious to see what skill he would display. He was too small to do any impressive lifting, and he didn’t seem the type to be good with a bow. Steve took a handful of white chalk from the gymnastics bars and one of the water bottles near the front. He approached the glass separator and wet the chalk, using it to draw a sweeping line across the glass. The peacekeeper babysitting him rested a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It’s time for you to go.”
He took a screenshot of the footage and reverse image search.
“Seriously, Tony?” Clint complained.
Thank you for reading!
Thy always went hunting as a pack, and on the morning of of the full moon, Steve pulled Tony aside to explain the tradition. Tony nodded and agreed to run with them.
Bucky pulled back reluctantly, shaking his head. “No, it’s just me. I was sick the day they came, remember? And Ma didn’t want me to leave the house. But I snuck out after you guys anyway, a couple hours after you left. When I got to the mill no on was there anymore, so I headed home, only to find the doors open and everyone dead. So I turned and ran like mad. I didn’t have any plan beyond getting as far away as possible. I was up north for a while, spent most of my time as a wolf, mourning and trying to decided what to do. Finally I decided that no mater what the danger was, I had to take back our home. I came back down to Evergreen and I ran into a small pack just a couple miles from here.  They told me the whole Roger pack was dead, and they offered to let me join them, and together we would kill the thieves and take back the ranch. They're camped near by, and they planned to attack as a pack at night a week from now, but I couldn’t wait. I came to investigate who had stolen our home, and caught your scent. I expected to be fighting off the bank and a rival pack, and instead I found you!”
“How’d it go?”
He turned and walked briskly out of the office, his legs feeling stiff and unnatural, down the hall to where everyone was sitting. He walked past them without saying anything, straight to the truck. It felt like the whole bank had watched him leave, whispering behind their hands. He got in, locked the doors and rested his head on the steering wheel.
“They’re dumped into an arena full of weapons and told only one person can leave, what are they supposed to do?”
“Let’s just go, we don’t need to talk to her.” Steve said. He grabbed Tony’s arm and he shook him off angrily.
“I’m really sick of hearing you say that.”
Whoever was at the door knocked again and Peggy turned the latch and pulled it open. Steve spun around and dragged Tony down the hall before he could see who it was. If it really was Bucky, there was no way Steve would be able to leave after seeing him. So he dragged Tony down the hall and into the first open door, which ended up being a library.
“Sure? Why did we need to go into the hall to talk about movies?”
Steve had thought things were going well with Tony. They ate lunch together most days, and shared that stupidly small love seat on movie nights, and made flirty jokes with each other that would have crossed a line with any of Steve’s other friends. Sure, Steve had never directly asked him out, but he was getting there (eventually, shut up, Natasha) and felt like they had a pretty good mutual understand going on in the meantime.
Steve took control of the situation. “Tony, keep the box going, Britain, guard him from the birds and don't let anyone out of that house. Everyone else with me, let's catch these guys before the birds return! Avengers Assemble!”
Tony didn’t doubt that he could get them working if he tried. There was a better than even chance that he had designed them in the first place. But if he did, then Steve and the others would have no chance. What was a bow or a knife compared to a bomb? The tribute could throw them, or hide them then draw the group over it, and it would be game over for them.
When the timer went off again Steve took them out and put them on the counter. They looked like little puddles of spongy yellow soup. Steve poked one and the batter stuck to his finger. Tony shook his head sadly.
There were big changes too. The walls were blue instead of white, and there were more windows. It looked like Tony finally figured out a bulletproof clear polymer, to let in some nice natural light instead of having pure concrete. The spider kid had a room now, and the gym had an attached obstacle course. Security was tighter; cameras watched from every corner and doors closed with a hiss, making an air tight seal. Steve was sure Scott’s break in must have driven Tony nuts, trying to make security tight enough to catch an ant.
He accepted the non sequitur smoothly. “Yeah. Nothing but bugs, birds, and the house. Sometimes the wind.”
The other man took it, and shook it firmly, shooting him a cocky smile. “Captain Britain, but you can call me Brian.”
“No problem,” the man said. As Tony reoriented himself and took a closer look, he realized that the uniform wasn't quite right. Tony pushed himself to his feet.
“Yeah. Here you go,” he said, handing over a plate reluctantly. “Other one’s for Tony, so I’ll be right back, alright? Maybe you can go downstairs and eat with Jan and Clint.”
“I can ignore it.”
“Fine, fine. Tony, what is your most favorite season?” he asked, dragging out the ‘o’ in favorite like an over excited grade schooler.
“Hey give me a break, I'm a little busy here.” As soon as he said it Tony winced and tried to backtrack. “Busy… monitoring the situation. From a safe distance. Because I am totally waiting for you guys.”
“Then I’ll kill your friends.”
“Sure, you want me to take it?” Steve said.
“Override established three years, two months, and two days ago.”
He put a heavy hand on Tony’s shoulder and he felt himself bending under the weight. He ducked his head, keeping his eyes on the ground.
Steve let Tony pull him closer, let him rest his head against his shoulder, shifting his grip from his wrist to holding his hand.
Tony walked down the aisle to Steve for the second time that day, and when he reached the end he put another two shots in his guardian’s head, the smell of gunpowder filling the air.
It was Clint who eventually spotted Thor, and they all rushed over. Thor was half hidden under black soot, and it stained him from head to foot. He was lying on his face and when Natasha rolled him over they all gasped. Unlike the rest of them, he had been unable to find a refuge from the flames, and was horribly burnt, his skin red and blistering. He was breathing so weakly that if Bruce hadn’t confirmed he had a pulse, Tony would have thought that he was dead.
A few months ago, Steve had been an average foot soldier. He had been sent to the front to fight, alongside thousands of other soldiers, in the never ending struggle against the Chitauri. They had appeared from a portal approve New York a few months ago, and razed everything to the ground like a swarm of locust. Steve had joined the US army, and they had sent him to New York with a week of training and a cheap ill made gun. Despite that, Steve had managed to take down one of the big ones, what the generals and scientists were calling a leviathan.
Raza’s eyes narrowed but he agreed, and helped them gather up the mines they had so they could head back to camp. They passed the river and Raza shoved Tony towards it so hard he stumbled, thankful not dropping any of the mines.
“Thank you, and have a great night!”
Right, eyes on the ball. Steve walked back to his original spot and Tony dragged his gaze up from Steve’s ass to focus on the paper ball. Now that he was thinking about it, Steve wasn’t a bad looking guy. If Tony had to write the color of his eyes out in code he’d use rgba(0,0,255,1), and that was a compliment. It was rare to find blues that vibrant and pure in real life.
“They’re just trying to keep you safe,” Obie said patiently. “Do you need to go through the training again?”
“There has long been a myth that if the ravens ever leave the white tower, all of England will fall. Though not exactly true, like most myths it was based in fact. Three weeks ago the Crown Jewels were stolen. The crown, the scepter, and the globus cruciger. Each object contains the power to summon and control the mythic tower ravens. As long as the Crown Jewels remained in England, the ravens were bound to protect the Tower and country against magical threats. Four weeks ago, three men attacked the Tower and stole the Jewels. Leroy, who I caught last time we met, and Kane and Maxwell who are still loose with the globus cruciger. I am on a mission for the Queen to find these men and return the Jewels, before anyone realizes they're missing and tries to take advantage of my country's lack of magical defenses.”
And then everything quieted down, and somehow it was worse. It had only been a few weeks, and everyone just moved on, like we hadn’t just lost everything. And then a few months later, Jan and Clint moved on too. And… sometimes I hate them for that. Sometimes I just want to shake them and scream, 'How can you forget them??? How can you just let them go? Did they mean nothing to you??? They were our family and they loved us and we loved them and now they’re gone and they’re never coming back and they didn’t die in peace they died in writhing agony and I had to see my own mother ripped inside out lying in the entryway and every time I walk in that godforsaken front door that’s all I expect to see!” Steve sobbed. Tony pulled him into a hug and he cried into his shoulder, the words pouring out in an unstoppable wave of grief. “-and we don’t know who did this and even if we did there is nothing we can do but wait from them to come back and finish the job, because this is my home and we have nowhere else to go. And I am burning up with hate, for the people who did this to us, but since they’re not here is just spills out and covers everything near me until everything is red and harsh and rough and I snap and lash out until there’s nothing left to break. When I’m not angry I’m sick to my stomach with jealousy, because I see Jan and Clint smiling and laughing and I can’t, because I’m eating off a plate that my aunt broke and glued back together, resting on a table with Bucky’s name carved into the bottom, thinking that Ma would have loved that joke, and every time I open my mouth to laugh I just drown in the ghosts of the people who should be here laughing with me. I’m stuck here, weighed down by a fucking albatross of a past no one else seems to care about, and I can’t move on, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know if I want to fix it, because fixing it would mean letting go and I just can’t.
Tony sighed. He was happy? Or maybe it was relief he was feeling? Bruce would get to go home, and that felt good, that felt right. Out of the group, Bruce had been the least of a fighter, the most out of place as he made his little fires while everyone else practiced with weapons. Tony had noticed it from his first question in the first interview; Bruce didn’t belong in this place.
(See the end of the chapter for
Twenty minutes later the timer went off and they got up to take the muffins out. Steve opened the oven door and they looked at them.
“Really? That explains why you were being so tight lipped about it. You shared just about everything else. I already know about Bucky.”
“And hombres!” yelled Clint.
“Maybe I should get going.”
Sam flew the jet to Des Moines and followed the sound of explosions. He landed the quinjet on the roof of a building and the team got out. Steve surveyed the situation from the roof. Three hundred people in matching uniforms were marching through the streets, all carrying heavy guns that were presumably enhanced with Chitari tec. There was heavy damage to all the nearby buildings; both Captain Marvel and the spider kid were struggling to keep a building from collapsing entirely as Vision phased people outside to safety. Rhodey was also working on evac, working with the police to clear out the buildings and streets and protecting the people as they passed the small militia of men with high tec guns. That just left Tony. Steve scanned the skies until he spotted him, dogging between buildings. He had a new suit, and the bottom half was grey which was interesting. He would have to ask about it later. For now, they had work to do. He started calling out orders.
“You’re the one who’s famous, what if someone gets a picture of you looking stupid on a metal horse?”
Then they stepped inside, together.
“We have twenty dragons, who can each hold five and make a trip everyday. Worry not for your people, Tony.”
Now he was back on his feet and a prisoner like any other, spending hours each day chipping away at the rock to find the iron that hid inside. Burly men walked up and down the lines with whips, showing no mercy for anyone who tried to resist. Tony was thankful for his many years pounding metal in his forge, otherwise he would have collapsed long before.
“Apparently. Is there anything you two used to like to do together, that you could hang out and ease yourselves back into it?”
Tony shook his head. It was different, somehow, between what Clint did, and what he did, though he couldn’t put the feeling in words.
Then the real Cap finally showed up and was at his side in a flash, holding his arm, asking if he was ok and yelling that ‘He was going to get himself killed and where did the birds go and who was this?’ and it wasn't until Tony was back on the jet holding an ice pack to his head that he realized he was “the hot guy” Brian had been rescuing. And that was almost as intriguing as it was annoying.
Except instead of hitting concrete, he fell into a net. It snapped under the weight of the armor but slowed his fall enough that he landed with only a few more bruises added to his already aching body. He was never going to make fun of birds again. He pushed himself up with a groan, and saw a man in a red white and blue costume walking towards him, holding a smaller man with a scepter in handcuffs. Hooray for teamwork.
“I’m Tony Stark.”
“What? No! You didn't! You did?” Jan looked at him with wide eyes.
“Did what? Pissed off Clint? Made a piece of toast without burning it? Ruined my fence?”
He needed to plan. But he couldn’t, his mind was filled with static, his blood pounding in his ears. He could die at any second. He could die.
She let out a tittering laugh, unrepentant. “I guess I’m caught. What can I say? He worries. That’s quite the scratch you have there, sweetie. A certain someone give you a smack?”
Steve nodded. “Seems so. I don’t think I need to explain how useful that is.”
“Much fluffier than I remember.” He said with a grin, ruffling Steve’s ears. Steve put his ears back. He wasn’t fluffy! He was large and scary and fierce!
“Bucky.” Steve gasped, still hovering on the edge of disbelief. How was this possible? This couldn’t really be Bucky, could it? He took a step forward and his brother pulled him into a hug. Steve carefully wrapped his arms around him, like if he hugged too hard his long lost brother would just disappear. This guy looked like Bucky, sounded like Bucky, smelled like Bucky. Steve was overwhelmed, and by the slight tremble he could tell his brother felt the same.
“Are we done here?”
The heroes all raced around their respective floors, calling out 'clear' as they searched each room. Steve began to worry that the house was empty and Maxwell and Kane had gotten away again, when he opened the final door in the hallway to reveal the two villains. Maxwell had his trusty bat in his hand and a raven on his shoulder. Kane had the orb.
I didn't have wifi for a while there, but now I'm back!!!
“Oh, that for me?” He asked with a grin. “Special occasion eggs, huh? You didn’t need to break out the big guns for me, but I guess a guy doesn’t come back from the dead every day.”
Steve shot back before thinking. “The one you filled with chairs? Where exactly in that room should I wait?”
It flared brightly and Liberty jerked upright with a roar as power surgured. She stretched her wings to their full extent, filling the sky and casting Tony in blue as the light shown through them. She flapped, and the force of the wind blew Tony backward, knocking him down to a knee.
“Like make it look like someone was reaped against their will.”
“Bucky???”
“Is that where you hit your head?”
“What did you do?”
“Yeah,” Clint chimed in, “Mr. Billionaire Genius Businessman, it's not rocket science.” Tony started to throw his mug at Clint before Steve grabbed his arm.
Steve tilted his head. “You disabled the traps?”
“It’s a dumb sport!” Tony laughed.
Yinsen fared poorly. Having always been a scholarly man, he had trouble keeping up with the pace that the overseer demanded and Tony was still too weak to help pick up his slack. They gave him ten lashes every day he was short on his quota, and by the end of the first month Yinsen was too weak to stand. He had called Tony over, and pressed his medical bag into his arms with shaking hands.
He scowled. “What are you guys waiting for, let's go!” He clapped his hands and the Avengers stood and rushed off to arm themselves. They regrouped in the hanger a few minutes later, including Thor who had slept through breakfast, and boarded the quinjet, ready to fight.
They made it to the cabin and Tony shut the door firmly behind them. He whistled as he opened up a cabinet over the sink and handed Steve a can of beans. A second cabinet produced canned peaches. Tony’s actions held the smoothness of having been done a hundred times, his hands finding the cans without looking. They ate on the coach, sitting so close their legs touched. Tony was still wearing the chestplate of the armor. Once they were done, Steve stood. “We should keep moving.”
Tony didn’t look at him. “Whatever.”
Tony coughed and pounded his chest a few times. He was alright, he had a pretty high spice tolerance. Steve came back with a cup of milk and Tony took a few swallows. “That was fun! Did you see that they had one with ghost chilies? I want to try that one next. I’ve heard they’re so spicy people have died from eating them.”
Steve was frozen in shock, his eyes locked onto the bleeding form of his brother. Stane took advantage of his distraction and pinned him to the ground with one enormous hand/paw hybrid. Steve struggled against his hold and Stane leaned in, breathing wet and metallic in Steve’s face, rivulets of blood and drool running down his muzzle. “You have beautiful fur. I might kill you quick, then keep you as a rug. I’d mount your head in my office next to Tony’s.”
When no one voiced any complaints he grabbed the remote and started flicking through the options. He picked
“I’m not upset.”
“It’s not your fault.”
She stood in the doorway for a second, not sure how to conclude. Finally she turned and walked away, back to the outside where there were relationships to mend and work to be done. Steve stared at the doorway after she left. He closed his eyes. Opened. Closed. Opened. Had it been two hours or two minutes?
Tony paid for their tickets, and got on to pace around to find the best animal. “Which is your favorite?”
“Look, I’m declaring it null and void. Your first kiss is whatever you want it to be, ok?”  Tony insisted. His next thought was to offer to kiss Steve again and make it good enough that he’d want it to count. It felt important that Steve knew Tony could give him a good time, if he asked for it. But there were no cameras down here, so why would Steve want a thing like that?
In this chapter, it's time for a wedding!
“No! Nooooo!” Tony wailed. “Oh it can’t be!” He put a hand to his head and swooned back, Steve rushing forward to catch him, happy to play along with Tony's elaborate little game. He fretted over him, and helped him to a chair with exaggerated care.
“Nothing hurts. I forget what that feels like. Thank you.”
“Ah,” Scott said. “Really that low, huh?”
They ate a leisurely lunch, then headed over to the bank so that they could finally pay off their loans on the house. Stepping into the air conditioned bank from the heat of the street outside always made him shiver. There was an intimidation factor there too, since he never felt more like a country hick than when he was walking down the bank's polished hallways, his books soiling the clean floors. All along the hallways stretched tidy offices, each containing a bureaucrat with the power to take away the land that his family had owned for generations.
“Yeah. I’d like that.”
Here he was so happy. A happy lie. And for all of Tony’s flaws,he was never afraid to face the truth.
“Oh god, oh god, it’s going to be ok, I’m going to help you, just stay down.”
“I can’t.”
Tony tilted his head. “I can hear a bird outside. Jan or Clint walked in the back door downstairs. That’s it.”
Images of birds attacking a bank appeared, along with shaky footage from civilian bystanders. “It appears to be a different person Sir, with a different weapon. The avians are not currently causing any harm outside of damage to the nearby buildings.” Jarvis stated. Unlike the last man, this one didn't hide among clouds of birds, instead standing in the middle of the street as if daring someone to stop him. He held a orb with a cross on top in place of a scepter, and that seemed to be what was controlling the birds. Tony was unimpressed. “They start handing these out with Happy meals, J? What's with all the bird villains?”
“You wanna talk guns? I’ve got your gun right here.”
Tony knocked on Steve’s door the next day around 5. Steve opened it, and crossed his arms. “I didn’t think we were still doing this.”
“I’m not going to kill anyone either. You should join my alliance, we call ourselves the Avengers, and we’ve promised to protect each other to the end. Then we’ll all go home.”
Steve didn’t think much of Tony’s city friend. If they were all like that, no wonder he was happy to stay. And some of the things she said… did city wolves not shift anymore? Steve had always assumed that they drove out to the nearest open area to run free. He had never thought they would stop completely. Steve wasn’t even sure how that was possible. Being a wolf was as natural to him as being human, two equal parts making up the whole that was Steve. Voluntarily staying purely human seemed like voluntarily cutting off one of your hands. Sure, with a lot of trouble you could. The question was, why would you want to? He spent most of his time in human form because he had chores to do and they required opposable thumbs, but if he went longer than a week without shifting he felt a constant pull inside him, drawing him towards the woods. And during the full moon it was almost impossible to resist, his wolf side drawn to run wild and free under silvery light.
Steve ignored him. Why would he care? He thought the whole games were a joke. Tony rubbed at his eye. Everything felt slightly out of focus. “Where are we?”
“Very little, I have been here since the coup. Sometimes I hear stories…”
The jet beeped. “Access denied.”
Bucky laughed. “Your joking!” When no one else joined in, he noticed Tony’s glare and the red spreading across Steve’s cheeks.
He dropped his stick and fell to his knees on the river bed, the damp sand soaking into his pants. He cupped handfuls of water and drank quickly, the water sweet and cool against his ash covered tongue. He splashed water over his face, wiping away the soot and trying to wake himself up. He had barely slept at all in the last few days, being knocked unconscious non-withstanding, and it was wearing on him heavily. Maybe he could rest here for the night, and continue walking in the morning?
“You two still doing that?” Natasha asked, with a tilt of her head. “You get any more stuff?”
Steve sighed to himself, clearly thinking about the last time they fought these guys, where Tony had charged in head first and almost gotten himself killed trying to take on the birds alone.
“I don’t do much,” Tony argued. He did only what anyone in his position would do. And he had so much to make up for. If he saved a hundred lives, a thousand, if he returned the kingdom to peace, none of it would ever be enough to erase the mistakes he had made.
Steve rubbed a hand through his hair. “That’s a teaspoon. You needed the bigger one.”
“Got that right Rogers, it’s private information. I may trust you with my life fighting against aliens, but if I like Barcelona? Top secret. We’re in public so I can’t even mention a certain baseball team based near here.”
“Should I get the beef stock?” Tony asked mockingly as Steve made his own version of buttermilk. He made it in a new mixing bowl, and Tony tossed him the bottle of lemon juice. He added that too, and picked up one of the eggs from the carton. Steve tossed it up and down a few times, catching it before it hit the counter.
“You cancelled a 500 person party…...because I took you out for a burger?” Steve asked, disoriented. Tony gave him a small grin.
Then Steve turned his back and walked away, hoping to never see him again. Because no matter what the other Avengers said, Steve didn't like him, and was glad to see him go. For reasons completely unrelated to Tony of course. He was Captain America, he wasn't biased, he just knew to trust his gut. Nothing to do with Tony. Thinking about Tony now, Steve noticed he wasn't on the jet. He looked outside, where he was gathering up his screeching box and talking to Britain.
“We’re all bad at math! You lost the coin flip so it was your job to do it! You needed to step up! I’ve stepped up to role of pack Alpha, I’ve stepped up to running the ranch, I negotiated a deal with Stane and lord knows how bad I am at diplomacy! If I could get enough money to cover our bills negotiating with a born and bred businessman with absolutely nothing to negotiate with, the least you could do is figure out how much I was supposed to negotiate for! You failed! You failed this family and now were going to lose everything!”
The problem was that Steve wasn’t bitter. As mad as he was at Tony at the time for going after Bucky, he couldn’t blame him in the aftermath. No, he wasn’t bitter.
“My god, it really is you. How the hell are you still alive?” Steve asked.
“And you will make up for it by hurting Steven and locking him out of the bond? You purposefully shield yourself from him, and even now I feel you forcing me out. It does no good to separate the parts of the whole. Let him in, and we may all repair your mistakes together.”
“Shall I inform the rest of the Avengers?” Jarvis inquired, and Tony nodded.
“Roger that,” said Natasha over the comms.
Steve slammed the shield down over and over again, harder and harder, the clang of metal on metal echoing around the room, a constant pulse speeding up with his heart beat. The Captain spread out his arms, making not attempt to defend himself. Steve raised the shield above his head, and drove it down as hard as he could into the star in the center of his chest, and the room exploded with white light. Steve threw up an arm over his eyes, and bitter wind whipped around the room, pelting him with snow. He lowered his arm and looked down at the body beneath him. It was Tony, his eyes glazed over and blood dripping from his mouth.
“Oh, now I’ve gotten your attention? I found all of them in the basement, and stored them away somewhere you won’t be able to find them. I want you to redo your final interview, and make sure everyone knows that you’ve learned the error of your ways and are back to being fully loyal to the Capitol. Then you’ll go back to work as usual, and if you’re a good boy, I’ll give you back your friends. Otherwise… I don’t have much use for the losers of the Hunger Games.”
“Stay positive Tony,” returned Cap. “There's nothing we can't do when we work together. Do you see the hostile anywhere?”
Sam pushed his bowl away. “Outside the city, we all got in the jet and he stayed behind,” said Falcon, and the others nodded their heads.
All the contestants laughed and Tony back out of the room. Steve followed him, fists clenched.
“Whatever. I’ll stay on script next time.”
The door burst open and peacekeepers flooded into the room, half bent over in the tight tunnel. The other door opened and Bruce and Thor were grabbed before they could take a single step. Tony boosted Steve up through the tree, and Steve immediately spun and reached his hand back down to pull Tony up. Before he could, one of the peacekeepers had Tony by the arm and threw him to the ground. Tony scrambled backwards on his hands and knees as they stepped forward from both sides.
Steve reached in his suit jacket, and pulled out a cherry ring pop, Tony doing the same. The group all laughed.
“I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you, my boy.”
Iron Man saluted the empty air then flew out of the tower, his foot clipping the ledge as he tried to correct for his damaged hand repulsor, before shooting off to save New York once again.
In this chapter, werewolves! Lots of werewolves!
“I don't think so, Captain America. I'm not going anywhere until I find what I need.”
Loki started laughing. The sound echoed loudly through the hall, and Steve scowled. “I am a man of my word and as soon as I am free of these chains you will laugh no more.”
Steve turned over and pushed him off the bed. Tony jumped up from the floor, hands held up.
Tony snorted as Steve walked forward. He was trying to look nonaggressive while wearing full tactical gear and holding his shield, and it wasn’t working. Tony felt like half the time Steve still through of himself as a 5’4” shrimp, and not the six foot muscle bound lummox he was now.
“Who needs to be put down. He is the perfect example of why the districts need the control of the Capital, because they are made up of people like this. People so bad, they corrupt any good thing they come into contact with. In this case, our beloved Game Master. Though Tony was wise beyond his years when it came to the construction of machines, he was still naive in the ways of the heart. Rogers seduced him.”
Tony kept posting pictures, partially because he thought it was funny that his publicist flipped out over every tiny thing (clearly he was joking about the cocaine), and partially because it was fun. He’d post pictures on his jet, of his hotel rooms, of local monuments. He had to travel for work so much that he was never out of new locations to take pictures of. Pepper quickly came around to the idea, happy that Tony was outside getting some fresh air and taking pictures rather than causing a ruckus at the hotel bar. She also used it as a way to make sure he actually made it on the flights he said he was going to catch.
I made a mistake with the chapters, I labeled two different chapters #6, and I decided to put the ending in a new chapter, so it turns out there's actually 12 chapters in this story, not 10. Tony originally had a much longer and sadder backstory that I removed while editing and that messed up my chapters a bit. Tony's past still isn't all puppies and rainbows, and I think we got more than enough extra sadness from Steve here.
“Except I’m going home today, so you can just suck it up and pay a couple hundred to hire a real contractor.”
Tony rolled his eyes, and reached for the bag again. “You can’t be serious.”
Natasha was the first to understand. “So as long as you guys pretend to be in love, sponsors will send you free stuff?”
“I’m rich and I felt like it, that’s all the reason I need. If you hang around me long enough these sorts of things happen. Why not take it? You need it and it’s not coming out of your pay.”
He felt his hackles raising. Here we go again, he thought.
As he said that, they passed a nice looking set of charcoals and Tony was tempted. After the refrigerator fisco he had held himself back from buying things for Steve. So far he seemed willing to accept food and that was it, insisting that he didn’t need charity. Maybe he would accept a christmas gift? When it got closer to the 25th he would have to try.
“Hello,”
“I thought you added the flour.”
"Sorry Mon Capitan,” said Tony, not looking at all apologetic. “I needed time to set this bad boy up.” He gave the box he was tinkering with a shake, slammed on the top a few times, and the box starting emitting a screeching noise. Everyone covered their ears and winced away.
He was already shouldering his way past Steve, who was still too stunned to stop him. Tony looked around the place, noting the desk with the ancient computer, and the easel propped up by the only window. There was no separator between the kitchen and living room, and Steve don't appear to own a refrigerator. Whatever, he wasn’t here to judge the guy’s living situation.
Too bad they had a business relationship, Tony had a rule against sleeping with employees. Well, it was HR’s rule, but he was happy to follow it.
Steve clapped him on the shoulder. “I think that’s the nicest response I’ve ever gotten. Usually people try to convince me it was for the best since I’m sick all the time.” Steve lead them out of the park and into the busier part of the city. “You run a technology company, right? I think you’ll like this next place.”
“Why are you telling me this???”
“Tony is the logical choice, emotion has nothing to do with anything.” Steve finished his eyes locked on Natasha’s, lying to help Tony one last time.
Tony stood up, and playfully tapped him on the chest. “Handcuffs and orders, getting pretty wild there, Babe.”
He got up from the table and Jan grabbed his arm, looking close to tears. “No! You can’t go! You can’t!” Clint and Steve quickly agreed.
Tony sat down beside them and rested a careful hand on Liberty’s side. “I have been a lord before, and never much liked it. Steve, I cannot help. We are miles from the mining carts and we smashed all of the batteries for the planes. There’s nothing I can do.”
“Coward,” Steve growled to himself as they circled. He ran forward for the third time, maximizing his momentum so Tony wouldn’t be able to dodge back. That was exactly what Tony had planned, and all Steve’s momentum was turned against him as he slipped in a puddle of oil leaking from the machines in the basement. The second he went down Tony was on him, sharp teeth parting fur and breaking through the skin of his shoulder. Steve brought up his hind legs and scratched at Tony, who held on with a determination rarely seen outside of bull dogs. Steve bit his muzzle and Tony let go with a yelp. Without a seconds pause Tony was on him again, biting and scratching. Steve gave it all back as good as he got, using his size and familiarity with the landscape of the basement to his advantage, until they broke apart and faced each other, panting and bleeding. Tony tilted his head, a silent offer of 'truce'. Steve nodded and shifted back to human, the bites and scratches pulling painfully. Thanks to his werewolf side, they would heal by the end of the week and were already scabbing over. Tony was clever, to get in as many hits as he did on a bigger wolf. And tough too. He had a scratch below his eye that was dripping blood down his face, and he bore it with dignity. A worthy opponent, Steve concluded.
“What did you say?”
“So that's the Captain guy?” Asked Sam.
“Working on it.”
One of these days Steve was going to have to bring up his concerns about Stane. Tony seemed to have a blind spot when considering his motives. Steve got the vibe that he was only looking out for number one, and Tony’s welfare came a distant second. He would bring it up the next time they saw him. Steve’s gut was rarely wrong, and it told him Stane was bad news.
Tony nodded absent mindedly. “Cool, just checking.”
“What are you going to say to him?” Sam asked, leaning against the side of the jet. Steve put a box in the cargo space, and tightened the straps to hold it in place. It was already filled with all the supplies that the Rogue Avengers would need for their mission back to the US to work out the terms for their return. The boxes included clothes, paperwork, gifts, and absolutely no weapons. He had already found several knives that Natasha had hidden away and returned them to her with a disapproving look. They were on thin ice, and lucky that the US government was opening up negotiations at all. No need to push them on any of their terms, at least not so early and something as reasonable as ‘no weapons will be present at the meetings’.
“Yeah, actually, tell us about it.” Tony chimed in.
Tony laughed and walked outside with Sam. Inside they could hear a glass shattering and Steve apologizing to the waitress. They guy was such a klutz for being a supposed super soldier. Sam handed him the wings and leaned against the wall. Tony placed them on the ground, sat beside them and began tinkering with them, pulling a small screwdriver out of a panel in his armor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony shift from foot to foot and looked away. “In my heart,” he admitted.
“Did you know?” Tony asked, suiting up in full armor, his voice void of any emotion, edging into robotic as the mask dropped over his face.
Steve sputtered. “It’s a ranch, not a farm. And I’m not dense, I’m thorough. If you weren’t under the bed, where were you?”
Steve looked at the wall patiently as he heard Tony mumbling to himself behind him. Tony let out a groan and dropped to the ground with a thump. Steve turned around and saw him start to shift. Tony’s bones snapped alarmingly as he reformed on four legs, his spine twisting itself out like a rope making sharp pops. His hands bled as claws erupted from his fingertips, the fingers looking like they were shrinking back from the bone as they morphed into paws. Slowed down to this rate, the process became grotesque, though it still went faster than the first time. It took less than five minutes this time for Tony to switch into a small dark brown wolf, the fur lightening towards his stomach and darkening towards his legs. His eyes were the same brown as when he was human, the only indicator that he wasn’t a normal wolf.
“I don’t know yet.”
“I’m a grouch this morning too. You guys stepped on my foot and it hurts.”
“But- I loved you! Why?”
Steve huffed. “Fine. It’s your tour.”
“It doesn't have to be all code names and crimes, that's not the point. He's just going somewhere cool to do important things while the rest of us live out our boring boring lives here, rotting away in this shitty bar and shittier town.”
Thanks for reading! The dragon finally gets a name! One of my favorite things about fanfic is that all the characters come with a name and personality already done. Making new characters is hard...
Tony didn’t get why this was a bad thing. Steve couldn’t seem to articulate why this was a bad thing either.
“What if Bucky shows up late?” Peanut to the shoulder.
“You won't even notice I'm gone,” Tony assured him as he gave Steve's arm a pat and hopped out of the jet. The ramp closed, and the team went home down a member.
Though the arrow was lightweight wood, it felt like it weighed a hundred pounds as Bruce passed it into his hands. “Go home, Tony, and make sure no one else is taken from theirs.”
friends.
“No, I already ate.”
Tony reached out a hand and Steve held it. Steve was a furnace of warmth in front of him and Liberty was even warmer behind.
Steve approached him hesitantly and the blonde woman handed him a tomato and a knife with a smile. “I’m Maria, Tony’s mother. I’m so glad you could join us, Tony’s always talking about you. Isn't that right, Anna?”
“Cap! I could use that backup right about now!” There was only static, either his comms had been damaged or the birds were putting off some sort of interference.
“I’m not letting you leave, I’m coming with you,” Tony promised. “We’ll all die, let’s see what the Capital thinks of that.”
“I’m twenty one!”
“You aren't supposed to fly ahead. We talked about this”
As he reached the top, there was no more glass walls, and he was hit by a gust of cold air as he was exposed from the chute. The platform jerked to a halt, and Tony stumbled, almost falling off the pad. He dropped to his hands and knees to avoid tipping over. The base was surrounded by landmines, ready to go off if a tribute tried to cheat and get a head start. They automatically diffused when the timer hit zero, and it was the stupidest way to lose the hunger games, dying before they even started.
Steve worked as quickly as he could, pulling the bandages away from the bottom of his foot where they were stuck together with blood and blister pus. He felt around the swollen joint and started pressing in on the right side, the pain and pressure building until it leveled out into a sort of relief as it went back into the correct position. Tony spat out the rag and swallowed the pills. His skin started to stitch itself shut and his bruises faded back into his skin. It burned in a way that felt good while boarding on painful. Steve kept careful hold of his ankle as the swelling went down.
Tony leaned into him playfully. “Alright Buttercup, you can stay, but Birdbrain over there is gonna have to find a new nest.”
“How is Bucky?” Steve asked desperately.
Steve nodded. He closed his eyes but he couldn’t sleep. He didn’t want to sleep, not when nightmares were waiting for him, and Tony was here. Despite Natasha’s warnings about pissing Tony off, this was the most receptive he’d been to Steve so far. Something about being awake it four in the morning made all of the complications of the world fall away, until it was just the two of them left with the bare essentials.
“Do you remember that movie you made me watch? The Matrix?”
Almost done, I got one chapter left, then some art. I haven't decided if I'm going to post that at the end or as a new chapter yet. Probably a new chapter. I got my wisdom teeth out and it still sort of feels like the time my brother hit me in the face with a snow shovel, so this chapter is more unedited than usual.
“No, no, you’re fine, that was just really bizarre. You’re right, it’s a mountain lion. The commandos and I were trying to get into a Nazi base but didn’t have any way past the guard, and out of nowhere a mountain lion jumped out of tree and ripped the guy to shreds, got him out of the way and distracted the rest of the guards long enough for us to get inside. Afterwards we made the lion an unofficial Commando. It’s really weird that you guessed that.”
She stood up, and wobbled off. Steve hadn't bothered to try to flirt with anyone after that. Apparently Bucky just shat sunshine and rainbows, so Steve was just going to wait until his brother was off the market before he tried to ask someone out with his damp dish towel of a personality.
Vague nonsense, great. Tony almost preferred it when the villains tied them up to monologue for half an hour. At least then he knew what the hell was going on. Tony's scanners picked up another heat source, approaching fast.
“Guys! Tony did it! He got the money!”
Steve half dragged him out of their burrow, careful not to nudge his ankle. Outside the air was much colder, and the wind stung their cheeks. Steve helped Tony lean against a tree.
“So?”
It felt incredibly fake next to the handheld footage shot from someone in the crowd. He went back to the first video and got a notice that it had been taken down. He switched back to the train video, watching it again with a frown. It felt even faker and more disjointed the second time.
“The meat from the store is as bloodless as you. And Alpha? You're not the alpha at all. You're just acting until a real Stark takes over.” Steve snarled, letting out enough wolf that his teeth turned to fangs.
“It’s for me too?”
“Sir is already on his way, Captain Rogers.”
Natasha tried to defuse the situation. “There's nothing more we can do right now. I'll talk to my contacts and Tony can have his computers run a search program.” She turned to Brian. “We’ll let you know as soon as we get a hit. Until then, try to find answers to Cap’s questions.”
Everyone else repeated it in one voice, the sound echoing through the kitchen.
It was clearly a sensitive subject so Tony dropped it. “I’m sure you’ll get there. Now, where to first?”
Steve let go of his ankle and laid down beside him. Tony buried his head in Steve’s shoulder and let out a sigh of relief.
“That’s dangerous thinking, the type that got your precious coworker killed. Take your shots before you turn into a monster, it’s not that hard.” She shoved the bag into Tony’s arms. “Have a nice day, Mr. Rogers.”
Steve also had the same rigid moral compass as Rhodey and Pepper, which was another factor in his favor. Tony enjoyed being around those types of people, he knew he had an overwhelming personality and he liked knowing that they were going to call him out if he went too far. Being around his friends, and now Steve too, made him feel more stable.
“You were the one who named her, stupid.” Clint punched his arm.
“Sir, I'm afraid the city is once more under attack by ravens.”
What did that have to do with anything? He shrugged. “Millions? I don’t pay that close of attention.” He pulled out his phone and opened his account. “I have 134 million. Decent, eh?”
“I haven’t seen them, but it’s doubtful. Public computers are usually old and won’t let patrons download their own software, just as a way to avoid viruses. Plus It’s a 45 minute drive out there, gas money would add up fast and you guys need the truck for other things. We need to buy a real computer. Think of it as an investment. 700 bucks now, for 15 grand later.”
“By the end of the year you’ll know so much about cows you could write a book. You’ll be telling me cow facts. And I will already know them, because I’ve ate, breathed, and slept cows my entire life,” They arrived at the part of the fence that always broke, where Dottie liked to hang out. “So anyway, this is Dottie.”
The silence stretched on.
Bucky continued talking, oblivious to Steve's meltdown. "I’m guessing there’s a real story there. What made you switch over to our ragtag little bunch?”
“This is where they've been keeping me in between all the dog and pony shows. The machine to the left has ice if you want some.”
He shook his head. “Nothing to be sorry for. It’s ok. It’s all going to be ok.”
“I don’t want to fight you, Tony. I’ve had enough of that for a lifetime.”
“My condolences.” Tony offered, knowing that it meant little in the grand scheme of things. Steve tried to push himself out of the bed and fell back with a pained groan.
They circled again, eyeing each other up. Much like their human forms, Steve was significantly bigger, standing three and a half feet tall at the shoulder. Tony was slighter as well, his long legs built for speed. He was a handsome wolf, Steve had to admit, with his dark brown fur fading to a cream on his stomach. His ears and paws were tipped with black and coupled with his slender build, it all created an almost fox like appearance. It suited him well.
“He is, I treated his wounds myself.”
Tony’s eyes widened then he looked down and when he made eye contact again his face was shut off. “What about when you ignored me on the base? When you picked Bucky over me? When we hit each other in the airport? When you ripped off my helmet with your bare hands and drove your shield into my chest? When you left me in Siberia with no way home?”
“Sorry sorry sorry.” mumbled Jan, not sure if she was apologizing to Steve for Tony’s intrusion, or to Tony for her older cousin’s state. Tony plopped down on the edge of the bed, making the old springs creak and bounce. Steve turned over, putting his back to him.
“We’re in the endgame now,” Tony said grimly. Under the table Steve took his hand.
He wasn’t pretending? Before he could make it past that, Steve leaned forward and pressed their lips together again, gentler than last time. He pulled back slowly, his face blushing red.
Thanks for reading!
Jan wrung her hands. “Oh no, it’s ok, yesterday was pretty rough, we really should leave him alone Tony, he gets like this sometimes, he’ll be right as rain by tomorrow, right Steve? Right! Now let’s go...” She grabbed Tony’s arm and tried to pull him away. He didn’t budge.
Steve sat upright with a gasp. He whipped his head around and saw Tony doing the same, a hand pressed on his chest over the reactor. Bruce was immediately all over him, taking his blood pressure and asking what Tony remembered. Steve laid back down on the bench and rubbed his hands over his face. That had been too close for comfort. And seeing Peggy like that, even if she wasn’t real, felt like a blow to his chest. Steve felt a hand on his shoulder.
“I taught boy scouts how to cuss and stomped on a flag.”
“Hi Steve. Welcome to my cave. Please don’t kill me.”
“I like blue.”
“It’s just a dumb ring, it doesn’t matter.” Tony insisted. “I never met my grandpa anyway, so it’s better I don’t have to use his ring. This is totally fine.”
“I don’t think we were allowed to do this,” Clint said gleefully as he poked at the wires on the wall from where he sat. “This feels like cheating and I love it. It was totally worth it letting Tony on the team even if he’s slow,” he teased.
“Just returning the favor,” Tony insisted.
When they wrapped up their meeting in Sam’s room, Steve had no idea what the other two had said. Though he felt guilty, it was fine, they would have no problem speaking up in the meeting tomorrow if there was something else important to add. And really, what was there to say beyond warning everyone of the coming threat and reinforcing the value of a full team? He went back to his own room and changed into pajamas and fell into bed. Packing and traveling always took a lot out of him. He rolled over and stared at the ceiling. There was a decent chance that he would be seeing Tony tomorrow, and though he had ignored Sam at the time, his advice now haunted him. What do you say to the man who used to be the love of your life?
Without waiting for an answer he dragged Clint behind the barn and pushed him against the wall. “What do you think you’re doing?”
Steve raced the car out of the lot, driving back down the dirt road to the same unfamiliar town that they had passed on the way in. He pulled over at the first few buildings and Tony hopped out before the car rolled to a stop.
Tony stepped in front, joining the rest of the Rogers pack. He threw the ring at Stane, and it bounced off his chest and rolled away on the floor. “You promised me less than a half an hour ago that if I never told anyone what Pepper found out, you’d leave the rest of the Roger pack alone!”
Instead of ducking, Cap swung his shield around behind him, striking the man who was about to hit him with a baseball bat. The man made a small roof and hit the ground hard, the crown he was wearing bouncing off his head. Immediately the flock of birds thinned to half its previous size. The man bounced back up and lunged for the crown, Cap tackling him before he could reach it. With his superior strength and training the other man didn’t stand a chance, and Tony watched with ride as Steve grabbing the man's arm and kneed him in the gut. As the man bent over in pain he grabbed the man’s other arm and forced it behind him.
Yinsen took a step back, his eyes wide. Tony held out a hand. “No, wait, I’ll do it. Alright? I’ll do it.”
“In your heart,” Steve repeated slowly. Tony threw up his hands.
Steve rubbed his face. Stood up, and started picking up the clothes around his room.
“Yeah, I can really see that.”
Steve still wasn’t over him. You don’t live with someone, love someone, for almost four years then simply let it go. At least not Steve, though Tony had always said he had a problem with hanging on to the past.
Tony did not mention that he probably wouldn't be able to climb a tree even in full health.
They had shared a bed a couple times since Tony had spent the night, sometimes when Tony couldn't stand the quiet, and sometimes when Steve wanted to sleep in a room that didn't smell like cows. Tonight, Steve wanted the comfort of him near with all the sudden changes going on.
Clint shook his head. “We can’t, we’re out of food and none of the squirrels or plants will have survived that blizzard. The games will end with whoever starves the slowest winning, and that’s not how I want to go out. I say we draw straws, and the longest straw gets to go home. As for the rest of us…” Clint took a deep breath. “I have my bow. I could make it quick, painless. Or we could go into the snow. I heard hypothermia isn’t a bad way to go… you get warm again at the end, and it feels like going to sleep.”
Jan gasped at him. “No! You’re such a jerk!”
Tony curled his knees to his chest and hid his face, his breaths coming out harsh and his heart beating uncontrollably in his chest.
There was a deep sigh on the other end of the line. “Keep doing what you’re doing, and mention the company as much as you can in a positive light. And I’m signing your name to a book deal.”
“I know.”
“Jan come back, I didn’t mean it that way! Don’t you dare say anything to him!”
“Well, I got everything we wanted.”
Steve screwed his eyes tightly shut. “Forget the superheroes. Do you trust me?”
“Everywhere like a normal person, or everywhere for Tony?” asked Clint. “Remember the time he got stuck in the walls when he was jamming machine guns in there to stop intruders? I had to go through the vents to get him out. Although they really did come in handy when Doom’s spider robots tried to come in through the lobby,“ he finished thoughtfully.
So he said um.
“Are you alright?” Steve was looking at him, the tilt of his head betraying his curiosity and concern. Tony tugged up the bottom of his shirt, and Steve’s eyes widened.
He should just tie the two of them to chairs, duct tape over their mouths, and finally get some peace. Course, they’d probably just Houdini their way out and have taught themselves morse code and accidentally punched a hole in the wall he’d need to fix during the process. Forget the ranch, they should just hit the road as the Roger's pack circus. Come one, come all, come see the two most annoying dumbasses in the world! Watch as they drive their older cousin and technical legal guardian into a rage with just a sentence! Watch as they demolish this entire circus tent with just a paperclip and a used piece of chewing gum! And the final act can be witnessed just once a month, so grab your torches and pitchforks and come marvel at the amazing transformation of our beloved ringleader! Half man, half beast, an abomination against nature and the ultimate killing machine, he can usually be found out back mending the fence for the millionth time so his cows don’t wander off and get stuck in the ditch again. Yes Dottie, I’m talking about you, there is nothing good in there, there has never been anything good in there, none of the other cows do this! It’s just you! Her glared at her. Dottie didn’t care.
There was a second knock at the door. “That must be Barnes,” Peggy guessed. “I thought I saw his car as I was turning in here.”
“You were brainwashed for part of Ultron, and after Clint and Loki we agreed brainwashing doesn’t count against anyone,” Steve interjected. Tony sighed.
“You have to think in sentences, as though you were talking, all I’m getting right now is mush. Vaguely flattering mush, but mush.” Liberty said (thought?)
From his vantage point flying above, Tony watched Cap walk closer and assess the situation. Tony was closer than Steve had ordered, but he was lucky Tony was listening at all.
“So you know everything I’ve done, and you still love me?”
Tony fought down a wave of jealousy. Why did he care that Steve used to hold someone else like this? Everything they were doing was either practical or a lie for the cameras. All that mattered was that Steve was alive, and he was here. Tony shifted backwards to press tighter against him.
Tony enjoyed taking pictures, and he liked all the comments he got. People would say “#Goals” and “Hot as hell” and other, more lewd things, and while he knew he was hot stuff, he liked getting the external validation. The mean comments were just as fun, Tony loved to verbally eviscerate people over the internet, and he got a reputation as a comeback king. His small group of 30 followers quickly grew to a couple hundred, then a couple hundred thousand. People started to recognize him, and his female fans were often happy to invite him back to their place for a night of fun. This instagram thing kept getting better and better. After he hit his first million his publicist finally stopped nagging him to stop, and flipped the opposite way, telling him to do more.
He curled into a ball as Rumlow kicked him again.
“My skills have brought all of us here.”
“Great.”
He came back out and hugged Tony next. “This means a lot, thank you.”
They showed the chariot emerge from the doorway, and a few seconds as the boy tried to regain his balance on the shifting chariot. The camera cut to Christine the second the boy started to raise his hand, so it looked like he was about to wave, except for the angry face he was making. If Tony hadn’t known what was coming next, he never would have been able to guess the by was about to flip off a whole stadium of people.
Once everyone was settled Tony turned to Steve. “I moved out of our room.”
Indries made it sound like all the city wolves locked themselves up, drugged themselves up, did everything they could to not acknowledge their wolf side, treating it like some sort of boogieman.
The overseer, a man named Vanko, pointed to the men.
Steve clutched at his chest and Tony gave him a flat look. “You’re not fooling anyone.”
Tony plucked the shield from the air as it whizzed past him and threw it back to Cap. It whirled across the sky, slicing through several birds before Cap caught it and hit another bird in one clean movement. ‘Yay for teamwork’, Tony thought to himself. The birds immediately reformed. Well, shit.
“I'm sending everyone the location.”
Tony breathed heavily and pulled his hands away. There was a flash in the bottom of his eye and Steve watched as Tony clutched his family ring, the one that they thought was lost. Tony stared at it, then shuddered and closed his eyes.
He was doing a much better job of acting this time, Tony noticed. If he didn’t know better he would even think Steve was happy to be sitting on him, leaning close with half lidded eyes, one hand on his shoulder balled in his shirt, and the other sliding down the small of his back.
Stark men were made of iron and Tony hasn't cried since he was four, but he was crying now, water soaking into Steve’s jacket.
“You should go let him know-”
“What?”
“I'll tell you later, don't burn my eggs!”
Tony sighed dramatically but agreed, and wiggled his way out of bed, holding his half full mug of coffee possessively. Steve grabbed the empty plate and followed him out the door. They walked downstairs and Steve put more eggs from the pan onto the plate for Tony, and got out a second plate for himself. They sat at the table with the rest of the pack, where Jan and Clint were close to done. Bucky was still pushing the eggs around his plate, not making progress as much as he was making piles. They wished him a good morning and Bucky returned it absentmindedly, staring at Steve with concern. He put down his fork with a loud clink.
Steve nodded and got out of the car. They started walking down the road.
“I paraphrased.”
Jan considered the situation for a moment, then spoke. “You know Tony’s not going to leave after he runs out of things to fix.”
“Please don’t tell me you broke into my room at some ungodly hour to return my coat.”
Tony closed his eyes. That was the last time Steve would ever say his name like that. Soft, trusting, the last syllable lilting upwards with affection.
“You’re the boy who was supposed to be Game Master, aren’t you? You were interviewing us for the tv.”
“A long time fan, then. Pleasure to meet you. You have a minute? Want to take a seat?”
The plain man from earlier approached them. “Your groomsmen have already left with him. I promised them I would look after you two.”
“Well shit…” was the only thing Tony had time to say before the bird stretched out an enormous wing and knocked him through a wall.
“Steve-”
“Christine!”
The guards forced them to the prison and put them in cells across from each other. It was cold, and so dark that they could barely see.
Finally Tony asked, “Will you be there?”
“No I’m not! Look, you’ve been here a week, you don’t get how things work around here. This is wrong! It’s all wrong!” Tony insisted.
“It’s not like we could make them worse at this point.”
When Steve got within a few feet he started talking. “Hello citizen, please stand down and control your birds.”
Tony stood up. “I cannot. Steve would strike me dead if he knew. I appreciate the trust you offer me, but I would be a scoundrel to accept it. I must go rest. Good day.”
“I guess I can’t argue with that.”
“Sprained,” Steve said after a moment's inspection. “From last night?”
“Let's get a move on guys, did I catch you napping? Get over here before I steal all the fun!” He laughed over the comms.
“I sold mine along with everything else of value when I was having my meltdown over Yinsen, and the ones at Stark Industries are owned by the company, I can’t just take one. We need to buy a computer. And not a laptop, I need a full computer with a keyboard, mouse, and halfway decent processing power to run the modeling software.”
Unfortunately, sometime during Steve’s quest to figure out how to get Tony to listen to him through manners and charm, Tony had retaliated and figured out how to get to Steve's weak points in return.
It was Steve who convinced Tony to put his name as a candidate.
“You ready to eat?”
“We’ve been together since last night so I know its been at least that long, and you were far from water when I found you. You need to drink.”
“Can you speed it up?”
“How deep does the treachery go? You didn’t smash any planes until I did. Did you really sabotage the catapults? Or did you just need an excuse to come early and warn Loki?” Tony felt a knife at his throat. “I want to trust you Tony, please, give me something,” Steve begged.
Tony laughed and leaned back into the embrace. “Hi.”
Stern looked down at his papers, then at the wall, then back at them, shuffling things around and trying to make it look like he was doing something. “Hmph, well, uh, it looks like it will be…” he pretended to type some numbers into a calculator and while his head was down Tony stuck his tongue out t him and Steve stifled a snort. Stern looked up at them triumphantly, then plastered a fake look of sorrow on his face. “Oh no, this is just terrible, it really is!”
Every person in the Capital went through training every month on how the peacekeepers were their friends and were there to keep them safe. That’s why they could be found on every street corner, and had the authority to search your house with no warning. Some people said it was invasive, but those people always ended up having their homes searched and were quickly locked up for illegal activities. There was no reason to fear the peacekeepers unless you had something to hide. And Tony had nothing to hide, he loved the Capital. He had devoted his life to making defenses to keep it safe.
Steve’s alarm went off, but something felt wrong. It was too late, the sun was shining through his curtains, he should have been up over an hour ago, why had- then it clicked. He laughed and pressed the heels of his hands to his forehead.
“Who is Hammer?” Steve asked curiously. “And how do you know him?”
Steve followed them outside onto the porch and grabbed Jan’s arm. “Seriously guys, we’re going to try to get along, don’t screw this up!” he begged. Things were finally going right, he didn’t want Jan and Clint to start meddling and ruin everything.
“Steve! There you are! I thought you had wandered off. Get in here and help us with the salad.”
They didn't have a moment. Vanko threw Happy to the ground and advanced towards them, craving his ever present whip. He brought it down on them, and Steve held up an arm to shield Tony’s face. Before it could strike there was a flash of blue and Vanko and his whip were incinerated in a burst of flame. Everyone screamed, and ran to take cover in the mine. Liberty landed beside them and nudged Steve with her head. He patted her shoulder.
Smoke filled the air and Tony covered his mouth with his shirt, wetted with river water where it lapped against the entrance of the small cave.
“For once, could you please not get in the plane? There’s a perfectly good cabin right here. We could eat canned peaches, watch a movie. Be happy.”
“You want to get breakfast?”
Fake clapping filled the room as the screens were all taken over by a shot of Stane from the waist up, standing in his office and looking dignified as he always did. He gave the usual spiel about how the Hunger Games were necessary to maintain peace and order, yada yada yada, superiority of the Capital, the Districts would kill each other without them, the games show how the people of the districts will go feral and kill each other if given half the chance, whatever, more on how terrible and uncivilized the districts were, boring. Boring, boring, boring. It was the same every year, and Tony would have thought that Obie just reused the same video if his clothes didn’t change each time. The video ended and Christine appeared back on the screen. “Thank you President Snow. Now listen up everyone, I have an extra special guest with me today. Please welcome Tony Stark, our new Game Master, and the youngest Game Master in the history of the Hunger Games at the tender age of 18!”
“Losing you again.”
“Artillery it is,” he thought to himself, as he fired a shoulder rocket at the bird. The missile flew right through like it was smoke. Which made sense, because according to all of his scans, the bird was made of smoke. The claws that grabbed him, however, were very solid. He was thrown against the ground again and again, and the bird grabbed him so tightly he could hear metal bending with a screech. That wasn't good.
“I thought you might appreciate this more than another fridge.”
Steve sighed. “I shouldn’t have done that, I’m sorry.”
Tony kept his head bowed. Steve was yelling at Loki, who was back to laughing maniacally.
Tony's eyes went lonely and distant. "I had an coworker, Yinsen. He was a doctor and after a while, my unofficial keeper. I met him when we were collaborating on a biological weapon design. That’s where Stark Industries made their money, in the weapons business, and I was a head of R&D. After we finished our collaborative project, Obie reassigned him under me, and together we created some of the most deadly weapons the world had ever seen. I kept pushing for bigger, faster, more powerful. Yinsen didn’t like it. He was always a pacifist at heart. He threatened to quit, so Obie moved him back to the medical division, put him to work on the wolf suppressants.
“Humph.” he grumbled, grudgingly deciding to give Steve the benefit of the doubt. Tony nudged him away and got up, heading for the door. He looked back over his shoulder. “Well, I'm glad you got him back.”
“We’ve been fighting since the second we met. Half of our relationship has been built on fighting. It’s what we do, and now you’re trying to take the moral high ground?”
Steve whipped around with a guilty expression, hiding the hammer behind his back. “Of course not. That would be stupid. I’m just…ah…”
“He’s trying to show off for Tony. Note the lack of beard too, after spending the last few months looking like a mountain man,” Sam told her.
“Since you banned me from measuring things. I’ll go get you a new shirt, how about that?”
“Oh hey, it’s here!”
Rhodey, Happy and Pepper were holding a sign wishing him a ‘Happy Birthday’, while Clint and Natasha brought out plates of pasta and trays of cupcakes. Thor and Jane were stacking presents on the kitchen table. Steve grabbed him from behind and started pressing kiss to his face.
The final evidence was an overhead shot of Tony pushing the peacekeeper who had hit Steve.
“I am relaxed, I’m perfectly relaxed,” insisted Steve as he walked off, still clearly upset. Tony didn't know what was up with him. After all, Tony had followed orders and wasn't the one trying to talk to crazy bird men alone and pulling teammates off benches for no reason. Tony helped Brian to his feet and helped him limp after Steve.
“He’d be safer still if he stayed home.”
Everyone around him looked at him like he was crazy.
As soon as they recognized him most of the group was disgusted, Bruce being the only exception. Steve crossed his arms.
“Jarvis, where's Tony?” Asked Steve. “We need to get going.”
They all burst into raucous laughter, and Tony pulled away. For all of his embarrassment, he was immediately sad to lose the contact. He grabbed Tony around the waist and pulled him back, and to his surprise he went easily, still laughing.
Rhodey knocked the dice out of his hand and dragged him away from the crowd. “We’re late, and President Stane will have both of our asses on a platter if you aren’t there and looking perfect when the cameras start rolling. Come on.”
He had been expecting this. He had thought of this, and a hundred other ways it could go. You don’t get the title of ‘master tactician’ by being surprised by a likely outcome occurring. Yet this was Tony, who offered a helping hand to the man who tried to kill him seconds before, who didn’t kill the man who held him hostage and tortured him, who offered first, second, third chances to people who never asked for forgiveness. Steve had been convinced (still was convinced) that there was still something left of their relationship worth saving. Tony clearly didn’t feel that way, and even expecting that as a possible outcome hadn't dampened the blow.
It wasn’t fair. He had done everything he could, and then some. But wasn’t ever good enough, was it? It wasn’t even his fault, he had inherited a load of responsibilities and twice as much debt. It was the bank’s fault for being so unforgiving, his family’s fault for taking on so many loans, his Ma and Bucky’s fault for leaving him alone to deal with all this when he wasn’t ready and never wanted it, it was Stane’s fault for not shelling out just a bit more, and most of all it was Clint’s fault, for not being able to do some interest and basic addition. This was their whole future and he couldn’t even put in the effort to double check the numbers? Steve was willing to marry a complete stranger to save the ranch and Clint wasn’t willing to take what they had and subtract what they needed correctly? And now it was too late to do anything. How hard was it? He screwed over the pack so he could go outside and fish? So he could laze around the house and gossip with Jan? None of that anymore, because they were going to lose the house. Steve got out of the truck. He stomped over to where his pack was awkwardly loitering in the front of the bank. As he approached, Clint tried to ask what had happened in there. Instead of answering Steve stepped towards him, fist held back. Tony stepped between them, holding out an arm, while Jan moved in front of Clint.
“Who’s left?” Tony asked.
He tried to resist the crushing despair. He had to keep fighting.
Tony put a finger on his chin like he was considering.
Jan charged forward with the hammer and Steve ran out of the room laughing. Tony shook his head.
He banged his head against the wall. “Fuck. What if-”
She batted him over the head with a folder. “Because you are the CEO and share the same name as the company! It’s their job to shut down any social media accounts pretending to be you, or defaming your name. You drag your name through the mud enough on your own, we don’t need people making things up too.”
“He was supposed to ride in the jet with us. He agreed.”
Steve jumped down and landed on top of the peacekeeper who was reaching for Tony, knocking him to the ground. Steve got back to his feet and held up his fists. He decked the closet peacekeeper and got a baton to the face for his efforts. He went down like a rock and Tony forced himself onto his hurt ankle to stand over him. “Don’t you dare touch him,” Tony hissed. The peacekeeper swung his baton at him and Tony held up his arms to protect his face. It hit is forearms with a meaty thwack and Tony screamed in pain. A peacekeeper hit him from behind in the small of his back and Tony fell to one knee, still trying to cover Steve. One last hit to the head knocked him the rest of the way down, and he was unconscious before his face hit the dirt.
“He was trying to embarrass you.”
“They what? I changed my mind, I don’t want to meet your strange alien cow.”
“Not at the end. Not when we could hardly speak to each other and you spent all day in the gym and I spent all night in the lab. Not in Germany or the airport or in Siberia. I don’t want to slide right back to where we were. We need to do something different, and until I figure out how, I don’t want to retread the same tracks.”
Though he knew that intellectually, it wasn’t good enough. And for the first time, Tony was close enough that he could go look and make sure. He opened the door and stuck his head out. It was late and the hallway was empty. He walked a few steps then paused. He didn’t know where Tony was. He had to be close. Carol had confirmed during the meeting that they were all staying in the same building for security reasons. Natasha would know, she never slept until she had the whole building scoped out. He knocked on her door and she opened it with a scowl a few seconds later, her hair in total disarray.
“Hey Cap! How are ya?” he asked cheerfully.
“I must have hit my head, I'm seeing strange.”
Howard patted his head condescendingly. “Because this is how the real world works, and it’s important that you understand. Look at them.”
“Steve Rogers, how may I help you?”
“It’s gross!”
“Sixteen ninety nine!” Chimed in Clint happily. Steve glared at him, and he shut up.
Steve jerked back as if struck. “I would never.” He stepped forward and took Tony’s hands, his grip warm and firm. “Cease dealing in such wild propositions. Like this I can feel what you feel, and right now I can tell you want this as much as I do. Win or lose, tomorrow will be a day of grief, so let us be happy today.”
The man squinted at him suspiciously from his spot on the floor. “Why?”
Tony rolled the dice and he landed two sixes. The girls around him cheered and he pulled all of the chips in the center of the table into his already massive pile. A tall man with a military bearing pushed his way through the crowd and grabbed Tony by the shoulder. Tony turned with a scowl, then laughed when he realized who it was. “Rhodey! Hey! You here to play a game?”
And it was; around them the birds started to melt into nothingness, the sound waves tearing their ghost like forms apart. Tony's machine started smoking. Tony cursed, opened up the top and started rewiring it, muttering to himself about power rerouting and shorts.
Yeah, that'd go over real well.
Clint sat up from where he was lazing on the couch. “Oh sorry, didn’t mean to get your eye. You get what I’m going for here though, right?”
The next day the chairs were gone from the living room. Steve checked around, and they weren’t in the kitchen or gym either. On a hunch he rode the elevator down, and found that they had been returned to their rightful spots on the office levels of the tower. Steve got back in the elevator and went to Tony’s lab. He knocked on the door, and it slid open, so Steve stepped inside.
Tony had to clear his throat before he could respond. “Yeah. Yeah, this is ok.”
As they walked out the door, Steve's keen ears caught a few sentences as Stern yelled on the phone, "-said you didn't give them enough! I closed it, I had to! They-"
“What are you doing?” Steve asked in confusion, pushing him away.
“I was trying to protect you. I didn’t know how to say it without hurting you, so I kept pushing it off and it ended up hurting you more. I messed up.”
“No!”
“Did you know that cows have two stomachs? And they eat things the first time around, then throw it up as cud and eat it again.”
He glanced down at the plate. Yeah, that ended up being way more than half. “Payback for the bite,” he concluded.
“Look, I’m the smartest guy around-”
“It’s ok, I already know the place. Come on, it’s my turn to play tour guide.”
“And there he is now. Clint, Jan, please meet Tony of Stark pack, my fiancé.”
“Oh. Um. Yeah. It’s not actually any trouble, and there’s a chance that Clint could’ve grabbed the wrong part, I’m shit at drawing, so I can’t guarantee anything…..”
“I evened the odds. Turns out there’s a downside in having one person design every defense system you use; I know how to disable them. It’s over, Stane. All the districts are rebelling.”
In previous chapters, Steve agrees to marry Tony to save his ranch from foreclosure. The dowry ends up falling short, but Tony agrees to help Steve and earns the extra money. The ranch is finally safe, and Steve and Tony are looking forward to the wedding.
Steve closed his eyes and heard Tony’s footsteps as he walked to the plane. Would he have been able to kill the queen if he had known that it would cost Bucky and the Commandos their lives? Steve's hand tightened on the joystick.
“Nat-”
Steve gave him a small smile. “That’s true. I would have been happy to find any of the Avengers, but I’m glad it was you.”
“Yeah, I got you a fridge. We’re going out for dinner again and you need space for leftovers.”
“What?”
They stared at each other in silence.
Was it an obscenity, the modern version of spray painting a dick? A gang symbol?
“This is a joke. This is a joke! Good job Obie, you really got me! Time to let me out now!” Tony paced back and forth frantically.
“Lazy, drunken, degenerate scum-”
“Very funny,” Steve said and walked down the hall to the conference room where everyone would be meeting. The room was mostly empty, which was unsurprising since they were ten minutes early. Carol Danvers sat at the head of the table, as was her right as the leader of the hosting pack. A black woman with short hair and a gold necklace sat beside her, and on her other side was Tony.
Steve stiffened in his arms, and Tony found himself being pushed away.
“You’re always such a wet blanket. I finished the design for the rocket thrusters!” He started bouncing up and down and Steve grabbed his arms to hold him in place. Tony danced away, and continued bouncing. Steve gave him a look.
“Where were you when Yinsen died, huh? I called you, and what did you say? Tony I’m busy, Tony he was just some random coworker, calm down, come have a drink, did you hear about the party Friday? Fuck you.”
And with that, he shoved him backwards into the pond. Tony hit the water with a splash, and immediately swam back up to the surface, teeth chattering.
Tony was too weak to protest as the boy pulled off his wet shirt and pants and hung them next to the small fire. He tutted over Tony’s ankle, and rewrapped the soggy bandage tighter, also tying up a stick tight to his ankle to offer extra support. He used a scrap of his own shirt to clean the mud off from the still healing cut on Tony’s lip and carefully felt around his head to make sure there weren’t any more cuts. Tony winced when he touched where the peacekeeper had clubbed him, and Yinsen quickly apologized. He also looked over Tony’s forearms, where they had turned a mottled black and blue in a thick horizontal line, as well as his back where he was bruised even worse.
“You don’t have a computer?”
Steve bristled. Frugal. They both knew he meant ‘dirt poor’. And preserving the traditions of the pack didn't make them out dated, it meant they were real wolves, unlike this man who was prancing around in his monkey suit and smoking smelly cigars that would stick in his nose for days. At this point, after so many losses, traditions were all his pack had left.
Steve stared at him, trying to convey everything he had felt over the last few months in a few seconds of shared eye contact. “Tony”
“I was going to start by shutting off the power. But even with the automatic defenses down, there’s still going to be almost a hundred peacekeepers between us and the President.” Tony responded. Steve smiled.
After lunch the search continued. They had to be quiet to not attract the notice of the other tributes, and it made searching hard when you couldn’t call out someone’s name. As they ventured farther from the river and the little path where Tony had disabled the flamethrowers, the damage to the forest grew worse. The air was still filled with a peppery smoke, and ash drifted into the air as they walked. Most of the trees were dark shadows, their leaves burned away along with their color. Tony pressed a hand to a trunk and his fingers came away black.
Sam shrugged. “Yeah, we need to figure out some other way of getting there.”
They stared at each other in silence, and Tony seemed to be reevaluating his whole life.
Steve stiffened up and pulled away from Tony. "Now that we know you're fine, I'm going upstairs."
Steve slammed the shield down again and again.
“Actually, I think I’ll stay. Nice room you got here. Very….homey. Smells like cows.”
“Well, shit.”
“Your baking skills make me want to cry. Go get the rest of the ingredients from the pantry, the salt, soda and poppy seeds, I don’t trust you to measure anymore.”
Did they really think they could stop him from seeing the picture by locking him out of the room? The whole Capital was covered in cameras, nothing went unseen.
“That wasn’t the alarm, we can sleep more,” he tried to explain. Tony wasn’t getting it.
“It's all right, we have a new source of information. Avengers to me, we need to talk to Captain Britain.”
Finally getting to the good stuff! Next chapter it's time for the games to begin!
Cap walked over to them, holding the crown. It looked to be made of solid gold with real gems, and a quick scan using his suit didn’t return any unusual readings. Tony hated magic.
Steve tossed the ball to him and Tony managed to knock it high enough that he had to jump to catch it.
“Yeah, I guess.” Steve sighed. “What are you going to get him?”
“If it doesn’t eat you you won’t have any way of getting it to come back. It’s a bad plan. And if you get caught, you’ll be beaten, and Vanko will tighten security. Where will that leave the rest of us? We have a good plan as it is.” Rhodey stated with finality.
Steve settled down next to Tony, leaning against the wall. “It’s alright. There are worse fellas it could have been.”
“We should just start over.”
Now Tony had the reactor back.
The Capital woman held up the piece of paper. “By entering your name into the drawing in exchange for extra food rations, you have volunteered yourself for the Hunger Games. Everyone please clap for our first volunteer!”
Tony stepped forward, hands raised non threateningly. “No murdering until I fix the washer so we can get the blood out of the clothes. Come on Jan, it’s only fair that you help me, since you were the one to break it. And maybe we could have a talk? I’m not some repairman you hired, I’m not leaving once I fix all of your old appliances.”
Brian crossed his arms defensively. “Look, I told you what I know. I want to figure out what's going on just as much as you do.”
Tony shoved the sticks and blanket out of the way, limping through the water and up the bank. He coughed roughly as the smoke hit his throat. This was a bad idea, this was such a bad idea. He wrapped and arm around Steve’s shoulders and dragged him into the cave, where the both collapsed. Tony quickly put the sticks back up and covered them with a blanket, the smoke that had gotten in slowly clearing from the air. Tony rubbed Steve’s back as he coughed, slumping back against the wall as Steve finally drew in a full breath. Steve pushed himself into a sitting position against the wall and tried to wipe the smoke out of his watering eyes. He blinked a few times and squinted. “Tony?”
“We’ll find him, don’t worry. ”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Friends.” Steve agreed, shaking his hand firmly.
Thor led everyone back downstairs and to the great hall. Loki had invested heavily in the wine cellar and soon drinks flowed freely. Thor sat at the head of the table, with Steve and Tony in a spot of honor by his side. Thor held his cup aloft and held a toast.
“I’m making eggs.”
Bruce nodded. That answered one question. It was possible for the video to be real. The next was finding out if it could have been faked. He didn’t see any motivation for someone in the Capital to make a video like that. It wasn’t funny, and they could be arrested for posting anti Capital propaganda because all uploaded content here was scanned by bots for dangerous messages. The father away connections had less security, and if the Capital wasn’t willing to admit that the districts were connecting at all, they probably had no filters on what they could upload.
Tony looked down and fiddled with a metal wire. “I cancelled the party, actually.”
“I can’t walk. I don’t know if my ankle is broken, but I can’t stand on it.”
“There we go.”
“No, why did you leave your pack?”
They all turned to Tony, the only one of them who had been above ground. He shook his head. “It’s not here.”
Brian smiled ruefully. “Yes, I think maybe we do.”
“Because last night after you tagged me, my account went from 6 followers to almost 50,000, and it’s growing every time I look. People have been asking to commision my paintings.”
“I do not wish to fight him. Things got out of control.”
After a long fifteen minutes, there was finally a wave from the office he was waiting for. He gave his pack one last stern look, and walked over. Steve entered the neat office, which mostly filled with a fake wooden desk and the squinting man behind it. A picture of a lake hung on the back wall, like it was pretending to be a window under the harsh glare of fluorescent lights. A clock ticked quietly in the corner. What was it with offices and clocks? Did they really need to know the time down to the very second? Even without werewolf hearing, the ticking had to get grating. Honestly, smashing it would be doing him a favor.
Tony gave him a look and Steve shut his eyes with a sigh. His head was pounding and his chest was on fire, Tony wouldn’t think any less of him for admitting pain. He was trying to be more honest with Tony, and trying to let Tony take care of him like he so clearly wanted to.
Scenario four. Tony hates him. Whatever they ever had between them is broken beyond repair, and it’s all Steve’s fault. Steve would enter the room and Tony would look away, cross his arms across his chest. He would shake Natasha’s and Sam’s hands then slap Steve’s away. Would yell at him, going on a twenty minute tirade of every wrong he had ever committed, in alphabetical order, accompanied by a PowerPoint. He would take what torn bits Steve still had of himself and rip it all to shreds, and he wouldn’t do a thing about it. Because he had fucked up. He knew he had fucked up, from the moment Tony had turned to him after watching that horrible video, his eyes wide and his face heartrendingly vulnerable, asking
He looked around and saw the rest of the tributes forming a large circle around a metal cornucopia in the center. It was overflowing with supplies, and some tributes were already eyeing it eagerly. Above them a timer was projected on the ceiling of the dome, counting down. It was at 30 seconds.
Steve’s face hardened. “What do you know of the state of the kingdom?”
When they got back to the house, Steve hopped out of the bed of the truck before it stopped moving, and stormed inside the house up to his room. He slammed the door and collapsed on the bed. The afternoon sun cast short shadows through the window, overexposing how ratty and dirty his room was in a grating bright light. He laid face down, then after a half hour of not being bothered, he turned over to watched dust motes dance through the air.
“Glaze? What are these, muffins for the Queen of England?”
Warnings for this chapter could be spoilers so quit reading the notes now if you don't need them, otherwise here you go:
In previous chapters, Steve needs to save his ranch from the bank so he agrees to marry Tony. Tony's dowry ends up falling short, so they pawn Tony's family ring and Steve's family watch to buy Tony a computer so he can try to earn the money before the bank comes for their home at the end of the month.
Tonight the chances of a wolf run seemed good. The forest was quiet except for the chirping of crickets, and the air was clean of the scent of any humans. He nodded to his pack. They were clear to go. They all started their shift, Clint as always trying to rip through it as fast as possible, sandy blond fur exploding out before he had his shirt fully off. Jan took her time, folding her things neatly before shifting into her sleek brown form like an otter into water, her black nose twitching. Steve dumped his clothes on the ground. They were going to need washing anyway after being in the dirt, who cared if they got wrinkled. He always got everything off though, because at a towering 4 feet at the shoulder in his wolf form, anything he didn’t get off would be completely shredded. He rushed his way through tonight, because he was excited to show off. One thing he had always had over Bucky was a better wolf form. Taller and faster with a thick white coat, he was the swan that it looked like Bucky’s ugly duckling wolf should grow into. He felt the clear moonlight on his fur, and he shook himself to straighten it and flatten it out. Then he turned to see Tony’s reaction.
There was a quiet ringing and Steve reached out a hand to turn off his alarm clock. His arm felt clumsy, and he couldn’t find his clock. Instead he stick his hand in a puddle. If Tony had left a half empty cup of water on the nightstand again he was going to be mad. He always knocked it over, then the carpet was going to be damp for the rest of the day. He blinked his eyes open. His hand was red. Blood. Oh, that was fine then. He closed his eyes and drifted.
“I wasn’t supposed to be gone this long. The other people I was with will be worried about me. Plus I have a few questions for them. Some of the things they told me… it doesn’t matter. I’ll be back in time for the wedding.”
The other judges watched the scene play out in silence. On the other side of the glass Steve worked. The peacekeepers hand tightened until Tony let out a tiny gasp of pain, the white armored glove leaving bruises as they dug into his shoulder.
“What?!?!” Steve roared, his hands balling up into fists. This was ridiculous. Would it be unethical to beat up an old man just doing his job? Yes. Would he do it?
Steve nodded despite the fact that Tony usually started more fires than he put out, and Tony got up to help. Natasha quickly settled into his space, and Sam beside her.
He had found in life that there was always a why. The toaster cooked bread because of electricity, the sun rose in the mornings because the earth rotated, and he couldn’t have more snacks because it was going to ruin his appetite for dinner. As he watched child after child die, he couldn’t see it, couldn’t understand it, couldn’t force it into a shape that made sense. And everything usually made sense to Tony, his teacher said he was the smartest in the class.
“I’m trying to be more open with you. It’s not easy.”
“It would be certain death to send in the foot soldiers without first bringing down the walls of the castle. They would die a bloody death by arrow and boiling oil long before any of them could get inside. And they are vulnerable to the weapons of the planes as well.” Steve countered. “The castle walls are fortified against even the strongest battering ram, the palisades are armed with traps, and inside some of the toughest mercenaries in the seven lands take their leisure. Loki is clever beyond measure and has had time to plan for any attack. This battle may require heavy sacrifices.”
“Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey, it’s time to get up, Steven!” Tony said in a singsong voice.
Tony didn’t look at him, instead kicking a rock with a scuff of his shoe. “What?”
“Are you doing ok?” Steve asked loudly, trying to be heard by the cameras over the wind. Tony hoped one was nearby, otherwise the whole conversation might be lost in static.
“Yes Obie.”
“Hmmm. I wouldn’t know. Pictures were always your thing.”
The room jerked back into focus. He wasn’t on a plane, hadn’t been on a plane besides the quinjet in years. “Tony?”
“Then we’ll fill it up, nobody owns a plane without a way to fuel it.”
Tony could feel his anger as almost a physical presence pushing down on him. He felt a wave of cool calm and Steve shoulders untensed from under his arm. Tony remained silent for the rest of the trip. It hurt to hear that the greatest hero of their generation was cursing his name, especially since he wasn’t aware that Tony hadn’t known that the swords or plane plans were going to Loki, and Tony had spent the last few months trapped in the mines with the other prisoners. Was Steve wrong to hate him though? Whether he had know or not didn’t change the fact that people were dead. He should have been more careful, more aware of what was happening to the swords he so proudly labeled ‘Stark.’ He hadn’t done enough, and he still wasn’t doing enough, taking Steve from his dragon and back to captivity where they would have to try to escape again.
Tony sighed. “Really, this sort of thing is why you are very last on the ‘Tony Stark favoritism list’. You're below the mailman, and I think physical mail is an affront to my very person. I hope you're proud.”
“You’re early? I didn’t even know that was possible. I was about to go over to your place to drag you back here.”
“Steve? Hey, you with me? Baby?”
“No yelling.” Steve agreed happily.
Steve jumped in to reassure him. “No, it’s helpful. Wait, no, I meant nice. And helpful. Um. Both. Look, I like not having to guess what you’re thinking. Makes things easier, I’m bad at reading people.” He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
The peacekeeper threw him into the supply closet where he had been caught with Steve and the door locked shut with a click. Outside he could hear the peacekeeper talking, most likely on the phone with Stane trying to figure out what to do with him. That made Tony wonder...he got on his knees and shifted around the boxes on the floor until his eyes landed on smooth black rectangle. When they had pulled him and Steve out of here, they had stomped on his phone and left it on the ground. In the commotion it had been kicked to the back of the closet, where it had sat collecting dust ever since. Tony hit the power button and the screen lit up. Like they could destroy Tony’s tec by stomping on it. He had designed this thing to withstand the force of a small explosion and gave it enough battery to last a month. He unlocked it and the application he had made to hack into the building’s systems popped back up. This was too easy. He disabled the electronic lock on the closet door and slipped out side white the peacekeeper was arguing with his phone. Tony went to the make up station where he had been earlier and smeared the thick cream over his eye to hide the red deepening into purple.
“It’s important?”
Tony followed him off the stage, two more guards with guns following behind him. They went to the lower levels and the first guard gestured to a waiting car.
She sat down at the table and leaned forward. “I own all your travel books, they’re amazing. The way you capture all the small details, and all the local traditions? It’s incredible. I just about died when you covered my very own home town of Brooklyn. Are you here to do a follow up?”
He grabbed Tony by the arm and dragged him over to a small folding table that was overflowing with machine parts, everything from old computers to carburetors to gameboys to blenders. Tony started to look through it, the possibilities flashed through his mind. He could make Steve a fridge maybe? Or he could make Rhodey a waffle iron that made them in the shape of the air force logo. Could he build a machine for home drycleaning for Pepper?
“You could call it that, if it would make you feel better. We both know the truth. You were happy to parade around in times of peace, soaking up unearned accolades and adoration from the masses. Then when it came time to fight? You ran. After swearing your sword and your life to your king, you ran. Despicable.”
“Does it say we’re cute and we should have sex, preferably where the cameras can see?”
Steve nodded in agreement, and started running. He bashed down Chitauri as they charged at him, and wove his way through the battlefield. His instincts told him to turn around and fight until all the Chitauri laid dead at his feet, but he forced himself to keep moving. Tony had done this before, it was important to follow his plans. He reached the grey car and found the keys in the sun visor. He started it up, and a second later Tony landed on the roof.
“I’m not stuck. Stuck means trapped, stuck means unmoving, and the only thing you’ve done since I’ve met you is get me and my lousy ranch moving in the right direction. I’m glad you’re here. When I was younger my Ma would always say, “No cloudy thoughts on sunny days.” Sort of a little reminder, that you might be feeling bad inside, but things around you are still bright, still good, if you were willing to look.
Tony splashed him in the face. Clint pulled off his shirt and cannon balled into the water between them, soaking them both. Jan jumped in right behind, splashing Clint as he came back up. It quickly devolved into a water fight of epic proportions. It was hours before they squwelched their way home in their wet cloths. The broke apart at the stairs to go to their separate rooms, and Steve stopped Tony. He leaned awkwardly in the doorway while he stood in the hall, water slowing dripping off of them to hit the floor with small plinks, sprinkling dots like stars on the swirls of the wood.
“Hey! You made it!” Steve said, shocked to see his brother.
“I used to be Lord Anthony. I go by Tony now.”
They went back to the living room and plopped down on the couch.. Steve unmuted the TV. The Dodgers were still losing. It was almost comforting in a way. No matter how many armies of aliens or robots they had to fight, at the end of the day they could come home and lay on the couch together and complain about baseball.
“That’s right! Things were always coming between you poor star crossed lovers. Terrible for you, great for ratings. Thousands of people were tuning in to watch you two, this has been the most popular hunger games in the past five decades! Everyone was rooting for you.”
Clint turned on her. “So what, you’re his lap dog now? You do whatever Stark says?”
On the screen to the side of the stage Tony watched as the doors swung open and the first two contests rolled out on a horse drawn chariot, waving. Each district sent two contestants to the Capital each year, a boy and a girl between the ages of 13 and 19. There were 12 districts so it added up to a lot of contestants, and Tony felt himself start to zone out. A chariot would enter the coliseum, the crowd would go nuts, the contestants would wave for the cameras and be projected for the world to see on the big screen, then it would be on to the next group. Boring. Tony looked down at his phone and started texting Rhodey.
The wolf shook himself, and his plain brown fur receded in a heartbeat to reveal the form of Steve’s supposedly dead brother.
Steve grabbed the note from him, crumpling it up and shoving it in his pocket with the other one, and they went back to the group. They were still gathered around Thor, and the group shot them dirty looks as they reappeared.
“Please, we do not have much time together. Why do you reject me?”
They sat in the waiting room together, Clint and Jan on their best behavior under Steve’s sharp eye. Tony wandered around the room, sitting in a chair, bouncing a few times, then getting up to wander again. Steve shoved all of the pens from the table into his pocket. He would use them for drawing later, and figured the bank could spare him a few measly pens after all the interest his family had paid over the years. So he was petty. Sue him.
A woman in scrubs injected a tracker in the corner of Tony's elbow and he rubbed it where it stung. The nurse checked the screen and nodded at the peacekeepers. She left the room and the guards advanced with batons raised until the two of them were backed onto the platform, where the walls of a tube rose from the floor, trapping them inside. With the click of the glass against the ceiling the shock Tony had been in wore off. He pounded on the glass, screaming.
Tony handed him a new bowl and sat back down on the other side of the counter.
Steve stood up and back Tony into the corner, jabbing a finger into his chest. “Don’t interrupt me. You never let me talk-”
“Seriously? It’s that simple? Can you do it right now?”
Tony nodded his thanks and dug in.
Steve picked up his phone and read the recipe. “The first ingredient is flour. Did you add three cups?”
“So you only leave a voicemail when you missed someone on the phone? Why not just try again later?”
“I’m not trying to fix you! You’re right, it’s not my place. But the situation you’re in? It’s not fair, it’s not right. You don’t have to do it alone. Let me help. Team effort, alright? I’m not Clint or Jan, I’m not 15 or 17 or however many years old they are. Come on.” He looked so forlorn, standing in the middle of the floor, earnest and passionate and bright against the yellowing curtains and paint of the room. He really was trying to help. Steve just… couldn’t, right now.
Someone was slapping his face. He cracked open eye open. It was Tony.
“I’ll find a work around, and be out of your hair before lunch.”
“That’s excellent news. I’ve worked with your family for quite a few years, I really didn’t want to have to foreclose on your ranch. It’s really a huge part of the history of the area.”
He could still remember the sounds it had made, and it troubled him much more than hearing the other kids swear on the playground.
“Seriously?”
“Put me down!” Tony yelled.
“All two and a half,” Tony corrected.
Their meal was interrupted by the Avengers’ alert. Steve's instincts kicked in and he was on his feet in less than a second. Friday started rattling off the details.
Looking at the man he had once considered a father, who had betrayed so completely, over and over, Tony didn’t have an answer.
The door where Tony had entered earlier swung open and a tall well muscled boy walked out. He was dressed in medieval armor and had long blonde hair. Just from looking at him Tony could tell he would do well in the games.
