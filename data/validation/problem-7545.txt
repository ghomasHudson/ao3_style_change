Ever since retiring from SHIELD, Clint had moved Laura and his kids up with them to New York. They were around more often than not, and it was during these days that Steve saw firsthand how Tony was so capable of handling them around the compound. He tended to humor Cooper’s curiosity about the Avengers or even attempt to make Lila laugh whenever she went all moody and buried her face in her cellphone at the table. One of Steve’s favorite things Tony did was sit Nathaniel on his back and crawl around the communal floor like a horse, because the kid would never stop laughing at the weird neighing sounds Tony would make (Steve walked in on that once, much to Tony’s chagrin, and he could’ve sworn that he fell in love with the man all over again, right then and there.)
“The mental scars never go away, though, and that’s not your fault,” Steve said softly, cupping the back of Tony’s head. He started scratching Tony’s scalp lightly, the way he knew helped to calm him down whenever he was tense. An arm snaked around his waist, and Steve felt Tony’s fingers twist into the back of his shirt, holding fast. A wetness started to spread across his chest, and it was only then that he realized that Tony was crying, letting his guard down in the dark of night and in the comforts of their little bubble.
. Loved. Being able to hold his husband — his
“…We’ll manage. It’s nothing I can’t handle.” Tony had his phone tucked between his ear and shoulder, focused on his computer as he mapped out a flight itinerary. “We’ll only be there for a few days, so I’m hoping she’s lucid for some of it.”
“Big fan,” Hammer breathed out sarcastically, pushing his glasses up higher on the bridge of his nose.
The, uh…” There was pause, and Steve’s eyes moved up and left, his lips mouthing around silent words. “The
Tony pulled away from his mouth with a wet smack, a thin line of spit still connecting them. Steve’s breathless pants turned into a bellowing laugh when Tony leaned back to pull his jacket and shirt off, his ass hitting the steering wheel and blasting the car’s horn, which echoed loudly through the garage.
Steve’s fingers were gripping at his hair, just on the edge of painful, pulling the filthiest moans from him. Tony was pressed firmly against the mattress, trapped between the cool sheets and Steve’s absolutely sinful body.
“Please, you shouldn’t have,” Hammer said bashfully, enthusiastically jumping to his feet. “Outside you said?” he continued callously, following Thor to the glass doors that led out to the landing pads.
The aftermath of Tony's snap.
There was a sharp intake of breath before – “Fuck –
The rest of the team watched Thor grab Hammer by the lapels of his jacket and, with a summoning of Mjolnir through the still-open door, sent them both flying up into the skies.
“Yup,” Bruce answered, just as stunned.

, made things a little better, but the fact that his AI refused to let him know where his boyfriend was still made things difficult. And although everything in him screamed for him to override JARVIS’ protocol he knew disrespecting Steve’s privacy wouldn’t help solving whatever had been wrong for weeks now.

Steve let out a surprised, “Oh, so just like a melted Penny Sunday.”

Steve had stared at him for a long minute, unsure if he’d heard his husband correctly. “Like… with children?”
Steve was surprised to find his post on Reddit get so many engagements in less than a day. He didn’t know what expect from people having an opinion on his situation, frankly, let alone what kind of advice they’d give him. Most of the comments went somewhere between “are you sure you’re straight” to “you’re definitely in love with him.”
in them. He couldn’t be bothered to feel embarrassed when he leaned into Steve’s touch, eyes falling closed when the blond curled his fingers just under Tony’s jaw and raised his head.
“No. No, I don’t.” Tony’s eyes softened, and slowly, he smiled again. Steve watched attentively as Tony walked behind him, resting his hands on both of his shoulders. “Honey, I love you, but sometimes you’re so stubborn that I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth.”
just as Thor touched down on the platform once again, running a hand through his hair as he returned inside. “Let us continue our festivities, friends!”
“JARVIS, what gives? I was –” Tony caught sight of Steve from his periphery, smiled sheepishly, and then called over his shoulder, “Oh, no. It’s that
Steve’s entirely too chipper “Morning, sweetheart!” was greeted by a rough grunt of acknowledgement. Tony picked up on a soft laugh before even softer lips grazed his cheek, trailing open-mouthed kisses down his jaw, down his neck. When Steve’s strong arms snaked around his waist, the tension in Tony’s shoulders seemed to dissipate. He rested his chin on Tony’s shoulder, quiet and content with just holding the man in his arms.

Get a rooooom
“Nope.”
Then, Steve came barreling towards him in the next moment, hands gripping something tightly. Excitement was written clear as day on his features. Steve had a grin on his face like a kid waking up early on Christmas morning, and Tony didn’t realize the reason why until the blond mirrored his stance, kneeling down himself on their carpeted floor. He opened a black velvet box, revealing an onyx ring laced with gold, designed like kintsugi.

written above a summary on the sign as he followed behind Steve.
King Anthony and Duke Steven are surprised to find out that their son, Prince Peter, is already off the market.
You’re welcome.
“I’m buying you a LifeAlert for Christmas,” Tony said in jest, laughing as he turned his head to look at Steve. The blond only stared back at him with a smile on his lips, clearly unfazed over his elderly jab. After a few moments of a peaceful silence, Tony asked, “What?”
Tony Stark
“With everything,” Steve confessed, meeting Tony’s gaze with misty eyes. He wore a soft smile, folding Tony into his arms like he’d been waiting to do for over a year. Having the love of his life in his presence again was almost revitalizing; made him feel safe, like he was at home. Because that’s just what Tony was to Steve: home. A home that he hadn’t been back to in so long.
As the team walked through the main courtyard of SHIELD’s headquarters, all Steve could focus on was how warm Tony’s hand felt in his, fingers laced together like they were made for each other. Natasha and Clint were talking about Director Fury requesting their assistance with some recon and science expertise, and though Steve tried, it all went in one ear and out the other.
Nothing was ever boring when it came to Steve and Tony’s lives. Steve might have moved into the penthouse of Avengers Tower, and Tony might be running Stark Industries from only twelve floors below, but the two of them hardly saw each other. One dove head-first into looking for the Winter Soldier, while the other battled allegations of his company’s non-existent connections with HYDRA.
When Steve returned, the apartment was filled with familiar soft rock tunes from one of Tony’s many playlists and the wonderful scent of freshly brewed caffeine. He tossed his house keys and mask onto the table beside the front door, making a beeline to their little kitchenette.

last thing he remembered was falling asleep with Tony snuggled up against his side despite them both layered with a thick sheen of sweat, kicking the sticky, soiled sheets off the bed. It was the first time that either of them stayed the night with the other, deciding that the occasional trysts and sneaking away in the middle of the night was a thing of the past. It was also the first time in a long time that Steve could remember sleeping soundly, without the familiar heavy feeling lingering in his chest after a night terror. Whether or not it was having somebody with him in bed to chase the demons away was an entirely different thing to consider.
“Language! Not in front of my baby!”
Sounds like a plan then
Before Steve could decide whether or not he was going to throw his friend into a chokehold, Tony pulled him forward by the front of his shirt. He licked at the buttercream frosting on Steve’s cheek before dragging his tongue across the seam of his lips, drawing him into a kiss.
“Always,” Tony breathed, catching Steve’s gaze.
The black tendrils started to seep out of Steve’s skin, sliding between Tony’s fingers and through locks of his hair and underneath the hem of his shirt. He gasped when one of them, surprisingly soft and not at all slimy in texture, wrapped lazily around his waist, almost petting at the sensitive skin at his hip. Steve took advantage of the distraction to lick into Tony’s mouth, tracing his teeth with his tongue like he wanted to map him out.
“You bet against the Petunias?” Bucky gasped, mouth dropping at Nat’s confession.
“Hey!” Bruce snapped defensively, glaring at Hammer like he was ready to Hulk out and smush his head between his Green Giant hands.
It was one of those few idle days when neither of them had meetings or other immediate responsibilities, and they could be content with just lazing in bed until noon came around. Steve watched Tony quietly, head pillowed on his forearms as he laid on his stomach. Tony was tracing the outline of his mouth with the tip of his finger, grazing over his soft lips and following the curve of his cupid’s bow.
. “Seems we’re both idiots.”

Harley sat up against his pillows, his bottom lip jutting out in a pout. “But you promised!” he complained, fixing his eyes on his other father when Tony appeared in the doorway. “Dad, he promised!”

The first thing Tony did when he landed on the Helicarrier was strip away the Iron Man armor. It was like he couldn’t get out of the damn thing quick enough. He was hurting somewhere in his ribs and limped a bit as he walked through the corridors, but he shoved that to the back of his mind because it didn’t matter. What mattered was Steve. He had to find Steve.
Clint snorted loudly, “Dude, you blew up half of Queens.”
Steve loves being held.
Tony would never admit it to anyone, but he knew without a doubt that he’d fallen in love with Steve first. And it wasn’t that parasocial teen crush he had on Captain America either, it was the adoration that he felt for one Steven Grant Rogers. Though his boyfriend had been the first one to say

“What? No,” Steve said, brows knitting together. He exhaled, breath condensing a bit in the chilled air. “I just — this is… dumb, what I did. You’re one of the only people who could really understand, and I psyched myself out of coming to you, which was me being so fucking stupid—”
Steve barely had time to close his eyes and lean the slightest bit forward before Tony was pulling away. Steve whispered, “Tony…”

Tony thinks of the love letters Steve's sent him almost on a daily basis while he was at the hospital, even as he keeps blowing him and doesn't acknowledge his words; thinks of the flowers, of the drawings, of all the little things Steve's sent him in the last two months to make him feel loved and supported even while they were apart. He thinks of the roses, of the
his face, keeping his body steady by grabbing both of his hips firmly and pushing his body down to encourage Tony to relax his muscles and, well, let himself sit comfortably on Steve's face. Tony lets out a soft gasp as Steve's tongue slides back inside his hole, flicking in and out of his tight entrance before Tony's brain even catches up on what's going on, his hands so warm and possessive against his skin where they stroke up and down his chest, his stomach, his hips, gripping the back of his thighs so hard he'll leave bruises, grazing at his nipples and pinching them harshly when Tony tries to not let his whole weight fall to Steve's face.
Tony's heart swells in his chest.
Tony shivers where the leather grazes against his nipples; he hasn't really zipped the jacket close, but he has definitely made sure it keeps covering the entirety of his hips – and what's directly underneath them – and the sides of his chest, so that Steve will have no idea of what's under the leather until he undresses him. What he will see when he comes home is Tony covered from shoulder to thigh in his bad-boy looking leather jacket and wearing a knee-high pair of boots, with just a patch of tanned skin visible between the two parts of his outfit.
, so intense that Tony gasps loudly out again, but this time his hands do not push Steve away; his nails sink deep in his shoulder, though, tearing blood, and Steve barely flinches as he just keeps biting down at his skin, pulling at his nipple and then letting it go.
When he finally manages to do both his eyes well enough, he can't help but sigh out loud in relief. He moves on to applying his mascara, then his eye pencil in the inner parts of his lids; he's already laid some concealer and some foundation on his face, given up on using brushes and applying cool eye shadows, and now there's only one thing missing.
He tries to calm himself down in the meanwhile; he doesn't want to ruin it all and literally come as soon as Steve enters him, but he's just so desperate. He's wanted this for so long that he feels legitimately

, the biggest freak you'll ever meet. He could finger himself on top of the Stark Tower in front of the whole city – or the whole world, if it's the case – and not even feel distantly uneasy. There are literal videos of him on the internet where he's sexing whoever comes close enough to him during an orgy, either doing the fucking or receiving the fucking, and he's never been ashamed of any of those. If anything, he's glad that the whole world can see how great an ass he's got.
He wishes he could blame his nipple pumps where they're awkwardly sucking his skin out, wishes he could say that it's just that they're bothering him and distracting him from drawing a goddamn

Tony gulps, not reassured yet despite Steve's words. He's suddenly very aware of the jacket sleeves partially covering his hands up to his knuckles, and can't help but feel grateful for that; for the light feel of comfort the fabric simply gives him. But he's suddenly also very aware of how much the boots are pressing against his bandaged, still very painfully hurting right ankle. “Is it?”

that Tony's whole body spasms, his eyes snapping open and his nails sinking into the blankets. He feels like the breath has been punched directly out of his lungs.

Steve bites tenderly at his lower lip and snorts to himself, stroking up Tony's hips with both hands. “Hurry

“Fuck, Tony,” Steve mumbles, taking a good grab of his right cheek. Tony moans softly, the pain still too vivid to be ignored; he feels Steve's hands moving gently up and down his skin after he puts his phone away, Steve's thumb stroking the meat of his cheeks with a little too much strength at first and then unbelievably gently, and Tony's ass and nipples are on fucking fire and he really feels like crying for a good hour or two, but he also doesn't want to ruin his make up.

His hole spams around Steve's cock, clenching up so tightly that it definitely pushes Steve over the edge, too; Tony feels every bead of his come as Steve fills him up, emptying himself inside him to the very last drop, and Tony feels himself be shaken by a full-body tremble as he slowly comes down from the rush, panting and shaking and waiting for his heart to stop hammering like that.

Tony feels each of his limbs tremble as he does as he's asked, sniffling quietly to himself as he turns around slowly to face Steve again. His make up is probably such a mess, by now.
He finally applies the lipstick, slow and careful despite the very little time he has left to get dressed up and prepare himself for what's going to happen. He's already styled his hair; he has left it grow in the last eleven weeks, and then he has cut it slightly with a razor on a side, while leaving the other one and the hair at the top of his head intact. He has curled his hair a little on the top of his head, too, so that now it looks a little softer – a little more feminine.
his ass looks right now. He feels as if the spanking never came to an end; his flesh still tingles where Steve's slapped it for so long, and he has to focus hard on breathing and relaxing before he can stop clenching his muscles so bad.
and his body falls forward, one of Tony's hand grabbing Steve's hip to keep his balance and the other one squeezing at the base of his cock so harshly that Tony yelps in pain, desperately trying to squirm away from Steve's hold as Steve's other hand grips one of his hips so fiercely that it takes just that, just

The pain that shoots right through one of his already abused nipples shocks Tony out of his tantrum, stealing the breath from his lungs like a goddamn punch to his stomach, making his eyes widen and his mouth open in a silent cry for mercy. Tony completely loses his balance as Steve releases his hold on him, falling gracelessly to his knees and elbows across Steve's body, forehead pressing into the mattress in between Steve's legs and his lower lip quivering as he slowly, barely blinks, and doesn't even register letting out a loud, wet sob.

Steve hushes him with a kiss, pulling away from his body just for as long as it takes him to grab the lube from the bedside table; Tony sighs out happily when he hears the familiar sound of the lube bottle being opened and then squeezed, and lets himself close his eyes and rest his head for a second as he waits for Steve to be done.
finally kisses one of his nipples as softly as he can; he sucks the other one in his mouth for a moment, Tony moaning quietly as his reddened skin begs for mercy, and then blows a hot puff of air slowly against it.

He swallows loudly in the big, empty room, staring at his reflection in the mirror for a moment. It takes him a few minutes before he nods to himself and takes the lipstick from the desk in front of him; it's just a nice, deep shade of red, cherry flavored and, if the label says the truth, water-resistant.

But Tony's patience and self-restraint has never been as good as Steve's, so his free hand remains still for the entirety of ten full seconds before desperately shooting down to wrap around his dick like the other one had done before; or it

more time against the mattress, he's going to scream.
The next step is much more difficult. Barely recovered from his main wounds – one on the side of his chest, another one at his ankle – and still limping, he'd hurried up to a tattoo shop a few days ago and got his nipples pierced.
Steve's hands come back up in sight, but they linger on Tony's chest for a moment instead of undressing him already; Tony pulls away from the kiss, sending a curious glance at him. What is he hesitating for?
Steve doesn't need to be told twice. He grabs hold of Tony's hips, and lifts him up with zero effort; Tony immediately wraps his thighs around Steve's waist, humming pleasantly underneath his breath when he feels Steve's hands moving eagerly across his butt – not quite stroking it and not quite grabbing it either, especially since he can't properly cup Tony's ass over the leather. Tony smirks against Steve's mouth as he hears him groaning in complain, and covers his hands with one of his own before they can slide underneath the leather.
When Steve moves a little to the opposite side of his chest to pay some attention to his other nipple, too, Tony lowers his head briefly and catches a glimpse of the nipple Steve's just stopped teasing. He gulps at how

Steve is still unresponsive, and Tony's patience is wearing thin. He wiggles his ass right in front of him, growing desperate by the second – Tony has never cared about dignity in bed, goddammit – and clearly instructs, “your hand. My ass. Red against white. Do I have to be any clearer, or – ”
Steve's lips come back against his own, catching his mouth to kiss him again. His tongue grazes at his bottom lip and Tony doesn't waste a second in allowing him to deepen the kiss, sighing in relief against his mouth when their tongues finally meet again after
He's worried Steve will ask him if he's alright again, so he speaks out before Steve can. “Green,” he blurts out, “I – I'll tell you if it's too much. Promise. Keep doing

“I've missed you so bad, Tony,” Steve murmurs, pressing a kiss to the side of his neck and then trailing his way down his throat, biting at it gently until Tony's hips roll against his on their own accord. “Oh,

Steve finally lays him down on the mattress, and Tony can't fucking wait to get out of his goddamn jacket and his goddamn boots. His poor ankle is begging for mercy.
“Tony,” Steve groans, eyes closed and hands still grabbing the meat of his cheeks.
He doesn't know for how long they keep laying there, pressed tight against each other, content and sated and finally satisfied, but he knows that when Steve lets go of his wrists, they hurt so
He licks his lips as soon as they pull apart, and his smile quickly turns into a smirk.

Tony pulls away from the kiss a little, just enough to let Steve know that he's alright, that he can keep going. Steve licks his own lower lip, nods briefly again, and then gets back to his chest.

His voice breaks on the last word and turns into a high-pitched squeal, because that's when Steve suddenly lowers his head and teases at his right nipple with his tongue.
Tony can easily guess just how
Steve is definitely used to what a fucking untamed beast Tony is in the bedroom, so he barely flinches as he takes his arm back and lets himself be pulled down by Tony's hand against the back of his neck, meeting his lips half-way and kissing him within an inch of his life. Tony pushes himself up to roll his hips against Steve's, letting out a few quiet moans as their cocks slide against one another and desperately urging Steve to get a move on before he tragically dies – young, handsome, and horribly, unreasonably robbed of an amazing orgasm.
But he can't wait to undress Steve even more; his hands travel down Steve's chest and grab onto his shirt firmly, pulling it over Steve's head and then moving onto his pants, taking them off in just a quick move. He can hear Steve toeing his own shoes off while he bites hard on Tony's lower lip, almost tearing blood, and then he's finally naked.
Tony chuckles wetly. “Of course I did. Just – ”

“If one mistake can land her in –”
It took Tony an embarrassingly long time to remember what exactly the ‘last time’ was that Steve was referring to. Then, it dawned on him: the first time they’d kissed (officially or unofficially, they still bickered about it sometimes) was when Steve had caught Tony sneaking away from the medical floor of SHIELD’s New York headquarters.

It was his hands tugging at his hair; his spicy clean cologne filling his lungs; his sinful mouth leaving harsh bruises against his neck that would heal too quickly; his skilled tongue pushing against his, mapping out every part of his mouth, tracing every pearly white tooth as if he was trying his damnedest to memorize them.
is he even checking the chat
Nate fussed in Clint’s arms, complaining about wanting to leave. Laura told her husband to calm down their son. Hopelessly, the archer turned to Bruce, asking, “Bro, do you mind? I know you’re like a kid whisperer.”
Steve wasn’t sure who leaned in first, him or Tony, but he didn’t care. A moan resounded from the back of his throat when their lips met, a kiss so desperate and so starved that Steve lost himself in it. One of Tony’s hands was twisted into his shirt, another tugging at the hairs at the back of Steve’s neck. Kissing Tony was like that first breath after his head’s been deep under water, the way his lungs burned for it, the way his heart was beating loudly in his chest.
“Wow, buddy, look at that! An A-plus, I’m so proud of you!”
“Fifteen minutes,” Tony bargained half-heartedly, readjusting himself on the stool.
Anxiously, Steve began to pull at the blades of grass under him, ripping them straight out from the ground. “It’s… complicated.”
Thor had found it incredibly amusing, citing the magic in whatever drink they’d all consumed to be the cause. A lot of the Asgardian’s words went right over his head, frankly, something about compatibility and consummation and walking in your partner’s shoes. Steve made an attempt at wrapping his head around the news, catching the tail-end of Thor’s spiel about it being only temporary, but he couldn’t stop staring at Tony. Himself? Tony in his body? It was… odd, nevertheless. Literally an out-of-body experience. The magical doodad spell wore off in about two days’ time, but it was enough for Steve to understand a little more about what made Tony tick.
satisfying to smack that ugly rat ‘stache off his lip,” Steve got up from his seat on the SI private jet and walked right up to the brunet. He leaned down, grasping Tony’s face in one hand, and crushed his lips onto his.
Natasha made a sound of disapproval, eyes narrowing as she followed his gaze. “He look uncomfortable to anyone else?”
Shhhhh!
~*~*~*~
“Uh, Steve, I’m pretty sure you know that we can’t…
“It’s only one-three, they’ll make it back up,” Bruce offered, throwing in his two cents. He cleared his throat then, muttering under his breath, “Hopefully.” Natasha snorted a laugh, hiding her face behind a hand.
Steve tapped the pen in his palm before deciding to replace it, walking into Tony’s personal space as he rested it on the table. They stared at each other, the air between them electrically charged. Because he felt like it needed to be voiced, Steve said, “I’m not against
“Now, this would be the time I’d usually tell you two rabbits to go find a room but being as it were…” Fury’s brows rose up to his forehead.

“You know, I’m glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.”
With two words, Tony sealed his fate, and Steve’s too: “I do.”
Steve stood from his seat beside Tony’s bed, checking his monitor for a moment before making his way to the window. The sights outside never ceased to take his breath away. SWORD’s large space station had the best view of the Earth.
“I didn’t say it was

Tony watched Steve lightly pull his bottom lip between his teeth before thinking,
There was moment of pause, brown eyes meeting blue ones. Tony read the unspoken question of
“Don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Plausible deniability and all that.” Tony opened his eyes but kept his gaze low. He fixated on the small ROGERS stitched to the arm of Steve’s uniform.
, naturally. He spent so long staring at Steve’s bare forearms that he crashed right through a streetlight. (It was embarrassing, mortifying with Clint laughing his ass off, but Steve had come running to him and started carding his fingers through Tony’s hair, and maybe, he thought, it was a little bit worth it.)
Steve took full advantage of their close proximity, dipping his head to place a close-mouthed kiss to Tony’s lips to hold off the oncoming rant. He startled when he felt a teasing pinch to his ass, blowing air into Tony’s mouth in retaliation.
When they were back in their own bodies again, Steve had made a brief comment about the chaos in Tony’s mind, thinking to play it off as a joke, and the man just shrugged in return after saying the slow and quiet inside of Steve’s head was a nice reprieve. And it broke Steve’s heart.
“Do you need me to spell it out for you? You two were always cuddling and being touchy and practically going on dates even before—”

“Thanks, Happy, didn’t notice.” Steve rolled his eyes, wiping the droplets from his face. “It was barely cloudy out when I left for the park,” he explained.
Steve’s own blood.
“A filmmaker and a lawyer, I think?” Steve replied just as quietly, eyes not leaving the moving pictures. (Tony pretended the goosebumps rising on his skin didn’t come from Steve’s breath caressing his ear.) Quietly, Steve added, “Those two guys are in a relationship. The sign said they ‘start building a home together and continue privately battling their own compulsions and addictions’.”
They sat there for who knew how long, holding onto each other like they’d no sooner disappear if they let each other go.
Tony’s brows furrowed, and he leaned forward between Clint and Bruce to ask, “Wait, seriously? Who’d you get to make a bet on a girls’ soccer game with you?”
“I love you too,” Tony whispered, pressing their foreheads together in a tender motion. “Now get back in that bed, soldier.”

Tony’s hand was warm in his, his thumb moving over Steve’s knuckles. Steve was satisfied with listening to Tony as he spoke with Peggy, tracing his profile with his eyes and staring at his mouth as he did so. For the first time in a long time, Steve was overflowing with contentment, just being in the room with the two of them.

“It was a joy to catch up with everyone,” Tony said as he began to wrap up his good-byes. “Unfortunately, Mr. President wanted a word with our dear Capsicle and sent me to fetch him. Excuse us.”
All three kids whooped and cheered, scrambling off of their beds to sit on the carpeted floor at their father’s feet. Steve looked down at them with reverence, feeling the affection he had for this kids go bone-deep. He stole one glance up at Tony, who nodded once, before starting the tale of the boys who never wanted to grow up, and the one who fell in love with a boy from Manhattan.
“No one else but the love of my life.” Tony paused for the screams and cheers. From the corner of his eye, he noticed Jameson fidget nervously. “Some of you might know him. The guy’s got my heart — hook, line, and sinker.” Another glance to the side of the stage showed Steve with eyes so wide that Tony genuinely felt a little bit guilty for what he was going to do next: “My fiancé from District Four. Steve Rogers.”
“She’s not a U.S. citizen and –”
He was well prepared for Steve stomping up to him with a storm of emotions brewing in his eyes. “Tony, I can’t believe—”
“I love you?” Steve tried, hoping to soften the blow.
Bruce agreed. “I’d be too, if everyone was coming up to me and bringing up the most traumatic things to ever happen in my life.”
Tony made a soft whine in the back of his throat, head cocking to the side in consideration for a moment. “Fine.
Steve and Sam spent a couple of hours doing laps around the nearby park, taking the time to appreciate the fresh air and sunlight for the first time in a few weeks. It was a quiet run until it wasn’t, with Sam starting an unannounced race between the two of them that Steve very annoyingly won anyway.
Sam shrugged, biting back a smirk. “Dunno, man. Not to call you out, but you’re never subtle about looking at him with those heart-eyes of yours.”

“Please tell me I didn’t see what I thought I saw in the sink, Steve,” Tony said monotonously.

“You don’t need to apologize for that,” Steve responded just as gently, brushing his lips to Tony’s temple. He reached around them, tugging their comforters over their shoulders and cocooning them once again. To make a point, Steve squeezed Tony tighter, smiling when his husband melted against him.

Additional thanks are appropriate for giving me an extension on the final! I wanted to make sure everything was perfect.

I’ve attached a zipped folder file to this email, let me know if you can’t access it for any reason and I’ll send over a GDrive link.
Tony pressed his forehead to Steve’s, tilting forward to rub their noses together. “I love you,” he breathed contentedly, punctuating his words with a soft kiss. “I love you so much.”
Tony’s personal art collection had been personally curated by Pepper over the years, bless her heart, but even it didn’t compare to the installations and exhibits that the museums had on display. When they’d reopened that Fall season after the Battle of New York, Pepper pushed him to take Steve; something about exposing him to some form of modernity.
you — and we all know how well that turned out. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.”
Tony returned from the grocers to find Steve lounging in the wicket sofa on the wrap-around porch of their cabin home. He had a tablet propped up on a bent leg, clicking around with one hand as the other supported their one-year-old daughter resting on his chest. Tony stood at the bottom of the wooden steps for a few moments, smiling to himself as he took mental images of the sight; even now, he didn’t know what kind of good he did in life to deserve his family.
A/N: Purposely trying to make art like how kiddos do was so much harder than it should have been??
“Look, Nick, it’s been a really long day,” he said to Fury, ignoring Steve’s subtle plea, “like Eugene O’Neill long, so how’s about we skip to the part where you excuse us for another five –”
And Tony would just stare at him, trace the new lines on Steve’s face with the tips of his fingers, card through the slowly greying locks in Steve’s hair, and tell him every day, “Good morning, my love.” Because for twenty years and more, Tony Stark had woken up right next to the love of his life. Sometimes, even without the Arc Reactor embedded in his chest, he felt the warmth of it, the warmth from his steadily beating heart that Steve held in his hands, because from these days and beyond, Tony and Steve would have this forever.
Tony exited the front doors that faced Vanderbilt Avenue, throwing a kind wave to their doorman. There were still many people walking outside, despite the rain that was slowly picking up. Happy walked with him, holding a large umbrella and shielding them from the heavy drizzle as they crossed the sidewalk to where the car sat parked on the curb.
“No, I swear I didn’t forget! Fuck.
Steve squared his shoulders, taking a step back hesitantly. “You should be. Tony, I’m —
“I thought I was protecting you from it… you know, the truth. The extra pain. But I, uh, I wasn’t sure how I’d…”
“In my defense, I
“Sweetheart… Hold on, look at me.”
Cheers. Gasps. All that and more rippled through the audience. Tony angled his head to the side of the stage, where some of the other tributes were. Each and every one of them, Victors in their own right, reaped to play into the Seventy-Fifth Hunger Games.
“I love you, honey,” Tony whispered when he finally pulled away. His tongue glossed over his bottom lip, and then Steve swooped in once more to capture Tony’s mouth.

dating or something.”
It wasn’t until later, when they were back in their room at the compound, that Tony asked. They were in their pajamas, Steve sitting on his side of the bed with a book in his hands, when Tony knelt down on one knee, opened the little box with the silver band, and proposed.
Tony had seen Steve in everything and in nothing. Tony had seen him wearing wonderfully tailored suits to public gatherings, donning form-fitting stealth uniforms during missions, and lounging in grey sweats and hoodies in their living room. But seeing Steve wear his old Army uniform, newly pressed and shiny with his medals, hugging his broad shoulders and narrow waist like it did…
Of course, the thought immediately led to a full blown panic attack.
It would be almost a year before he worked up the nerve to try again at a different party, but this time with a guy. He knew being gay was a thing; maybe he could do it like this?
Soon enough, he was back to all but buzzing where he stood, anxiously watching the time tick down with his arms more holding himself than crossed in indignation. (This was such an awful idea; why did he even think about it?)
the first time that happened.
Steve had a very strange expression, one Tony had trouble deciphering; it was nervous energy, determination, and… maybe hope? Which didn’t make any sense-
“Now, we have to be careful, it’s probably-” Steve didn’t get a chance to finish, as, at that moment, a loud explosion rocked the temple. When everyone looked up as the dust settled, a familiar, annoying laugh filled the air.
Current Tony, though, wanted to question his past self, cause he didn’t feel like anything was alright now and he doubted things were as good as he thought back then.

Now in hindsight Tony couldn’t help but blame himself for not going after Steve and making sure everything was right, he couldn’t stop thinking of all of the opportunities he had to talk to his boyfriend about it and he didn’t, he couldn’t not get frustrated about his lack of communication abilities or his lack of communication attempts.

Steve muttered a quiet apology, taking another step in his direction. There were still untreated cuts and bruises littering Tony’s skin from the battle; fighting off an alien invasion and tossing a nuke into the portal in the sky hadn’t left him unscathed. Even though the Iron Man suit probably absorbed most of the damage, the way Tony held himself now showed Steve that he had clearly sustained more injuries which he was down-playing.

Tony laughed beside himself, hiking up his little girl on his hip before kissing her cheek and blowing a raspberry. “I missed you too, baby. Were you behaved for your Papa?”
"Any excuse to get me to hold you."
Clint grunted, “Yeah, they’re getting slaughtered.” He adjusted Nate in his lap, squinting across the soccer field to where his daughter Lila went to update the manual scoreboard.
Yes and yes
There was only one Victor whose presence he cared about, and Steve was staring right back at Tony with a look of wariness. There was a subtle shake of his head. Tony ignored it, his attention reeled back by Jameson’s next words: “Who, exactly, has stolen the heart of the Capitol’s long-standing bachelor?”
“Just two more miles, sweetheart.”
“Jesus
Steve stood in his spot for another few moments, a smile fixed on his lips as he not-very-subtly admired Tony’s backside. He hated to see him go, but he could admit that he loved to watch him leave.
“What with?”
“Tony,” he huffed, calling after him. Tony stopped mid-stride, frowning.
“No, but I –”
ThunderGod said,
“How does it feel to be back in the Capitol after so many years?” J. Jonah Jameson sported a sympathetic expression, but Tony knew in his heart that it was nothing but a mask.
Or, rather, tried to propose. Steve had taken one glance at Tony, his eyes growing wide, before he all but threw the book across the bed and scrambled off into their walk-in closet. Tony stayed there like an asshole, calling after Steve and looking like a fish out of water.
“Sweetheart –”
The whole gang had basically taken over one side of the bleachers when they sat to watch Morgan’s little league soccer match. Clint and Laura sat with their youngest son, as their other two kids manned the scores. Bruce and Nat remained huddled together, half-paying attention to the game in between whispering amongst each other. Bucky, the supportive uncle that he was, sat beside Steve and Tony wearing a pink
Tony rolled his eyes overdramatically, shoving against Steve jokingly. “That’s what it’s there for, genius.” A pink flush appeared across his boyfriend’s cheeks, and he couldn’t help the wide grin that spread across his own lips.
Not a lot of people knew Tony loved holidays. Hell, if Steve didn’t know any better, he’d think
Happy Thursday, Tony!
“Don’t worry. I have a plan.”
Steve stifled a laugh, wiping the wetness from his cheeks with the back of his hand. Leave it to Tony to crack a joke if only to test the waters.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, playing with the hairs at the nape of his husband’s neck. “Does this mean you’re keeping the beard?”
And maybe they shouldn’t have, Steve thought to himself, but the words simultaneously sent a chill up his spine and warmth through his heart. It was normal; he and Tony have known each other for a few years now, and they always shared loving sentiments. They were best friends, of course they loved each other, but ever since they started to be
Steve spotted a head of dark hair descending one of the escalators, and he reached his hands up to keep Morgan balanced on his shoulders. “Maguna, I think I see—” He was swiftly smacked in the face with the hand-made sign that she had insisted on creating, blocking his vision for a moment.
From the very beginning, he saw the amount of compassion Tony had. The amount of care he showed. Sometimes, when they had been out in public, little kids would run up to him, and Steve remembered always feeling his heart grow in size just from the sight of Tony kneeling down on the dirty ground to give the kids hugs and spend a few minutes humoring their silly questions.
Tony has a very
“I love you, hon, but no.” He looked back up at Tony, feeling the tears pool once again in his eyes even as he tried to hide his smile. They shared a kiss, chaste and short and sweet, smiling so wide that their kiss was more teeth than lips.
Their second kiss – because that’s what it was,
. Only sex. It wasn’t, like, gay or anything. Sure, maybe Tony had never given anyone head before, but Steve wasn’t exactly complaining when the brunet licked up his shaft or mouthed at the tip of his cock. He didn’t complain when Tony all but sucked his soul straight out of his dick, sending him spiraling into the most intense, toe-curling, back-arching climax he’d ever experienced. Steve had never kissed another guy before either, but he didn’t whine about it when Tony crawled up and captured his mouth in a kiss, licking past his teeth to brush against his tongue. The taste of his own spend in Tony’s mouth was strong, heady, mixed with something that was so extremely
Steve smiled down at Tony, lips still wet and kissed red from when he’d captured Tony’s mouth with his after stepping into the lift. “Sweetheart,” he crooned, running the pad of his thumb across the brunet’s parted lips, “you’re so good to me. You’ll do anything for me, won’t you, baby?”

they would both be prepared for this. After all, Steve was the Man with the Plan, and Tony was the Futurist.
“Yeah. I think. Let’s go with that.” He slipped his sunglasses off of his face and moved them to rest atop the bill of his hat, giving Steve a half-smile as he drank more of the blue slush. “Wanna try?” he offered.
Tony’s head was tucked under Steve’s chin, the bodies pressed close together as they slowly swayed back and forth. The music had long changed into something more upbeat, a slow pop song from what Steve could understand, but the newlyweds didn’t care in the slightest. They reveled in each other’s warmth; their eyes closed against the world around them. In Steve and Tony’s little bubble, there was no one besides the two of them. Two men who found each other, two men who cultivated their own happiness, two men who had flaws but loved each other
Happy was staring at his boss with wide eyes and a knowing smirk when he faced forward. Their eyes met in the rearview mirror, and Tony glared. “What?”
, did that sight do something to Tony.
Tony swallowed a snort, fighting against every nerve in his body to keep himself from rolling his eyes. “Sure, that’s great and all, but I was referring to a certain someone with us tonight.”
I do have one question for you though (And you can block me and report me to the dean of students if I’ve read things wrong this past semester, so I’m really hoping I hadn’t) – since you officially won’t be my student once grades are posted this weekend, would you maybe wanna grab coffee with me on Monday?
But, even after weeks, Tony couldn’t figure out what his boyfriend was going through. And right now, not being able to find him anywhere, he needed to understand what was going on in their relationship more than ever before.

Clint shrugged, taking a swig from his chilled glass of whiskey. “What else is a guy to do at this stupid thing? Rub elbows with old white guys?”

Steve approached the young man, hands tucked into his pockets. The two of them made eye contact, blue to blue, and Steve gave him a sad smile. “You want to come in?” he offered kindly.
Steve thought he was ready, in all honesty. His mom had been a nurse once upon a time, and he’d heard all the stories from the wards, but actually being in the room where it happened was something those stories never could have prepared him for. They didn’t prepare him, either, for the tidal wave of emotions that crashed into him when he heard his

Tony cupped Steve’s face, thumbing away the rogue tears on his cheeks. “I want to have everything with you,” he confessed.
There were tears glistening in Tony’s eyes as he looked at Steve. His voice was low when he asked, “How long have you known?”
and little Iron Man she drew all on her own. Tony kneeled down, and ooh’d and aww’d appropriately as Morgan ranted enthusiastically about the things she and Steve had been up to since he was gone.
And how could Steve possibly stay mad at Tony when he was smiling as sweet as that?
“Thanks, by the way! It was so nice of you to send that invitation—”

Tony took a slow but sure step forward, his eyes never leaving Steve’s. “You’re my friend, and you’re in pain. Whatever this is… I want to help.”
It was the way kindness always radiated from Steve, unaltered and pure. It was the way Steve had looked in the low light during their first date at the museum, when they had kissed each other in the darkness of the projector room. It was the way Steve had once regarded the Arc Reactor in Tony’s chest with so much care, as if it were the most precious thing in the world (and he used to adamantly say it was, and always will be, because it had kept Tony alive). It was the way Steve knew when to kiss the worried lines away from Tony’s face, to hug him tight against his chest when he needed it most. It was the way Steve would literally and figuratively run circles around Tony, his mind so whip-crack fast that he always kept up with every quip.
why Steve was isolating himself: It was February, the anniversary of Bucky Barnes’s death. He was mourning his first love.
“You’re not… mad?” Tony’s voice was quiet. Steve realized that he needed her blessing just as much as Steve did.
A reminder that this lecture is recorded. This includes private chat messages.
Steve, who wasn’t afraid to look him in the eyes. Steve, who was smiling down at him without an ounce of remorse on his face. Steve, whose only response was to kiss him again, hands holding his face as he deepened it. Their kiss was all teeth biting at lips and tongues smoothing them over.
She had the audacity to laugh when the two of them shared a look and started sputtering out denials, adding, “Come off it. I’ve been alive ninety-two years now. One learns to recognize pure love when they see it.”
Storm is widely known as one of the most recognizable faces currently in the movie and television industry, helming both blockbuster films and indie flicks like
Morning, darling
“There better
Tony responded cryptically, feeling the butterflies settle in his stomach. “For someone’s birthday.” This could go one of two ways, and even then, he wasn’t sure which reaction he’d get out of Steve. He was often touchy when it came to things from his past.

International news outlets announced the engagement of the century early morning of August 23. According to
A/N: Just for timeline context, this chapter was set in 2013. Also, comments give me life! Let me know how it's going so far (and fangirl with me over how in love these two idiots are with each other oml)
After a few more minutes, however, Steve finally caught a head of dark hair peeking above the corner divider, headed in his direction. Tony popped up in his periphery, wearing a light pink hoodie under his unbuttoned suit jacket and matching slacks. “Honey, I am
“Dinner’s ready,” Steve’s voice called from over his shoulder. Tony hadn’t heard him enter the workshop; he was so focused on a new prototype widget for SI.
Tony needed to thank Pepper for suggesting the museum visits. She deserved a fruit basket (sans strawberries; he’d made that mistake before), or maybe a raise. Definitely a raise.

~*~*~*~
Tony all but gasped when one of Steve’s cold hands slipped under his shirt, fingers pressing patterns along Tony’s skin as they slid up to trace the circumference of the Arc Reactor, his touch incredibly light around the mess of scars.
Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s hair before finding Tony’s lips, the contact soft and unhurried. Tony tried memorizing the feel of Steve’s mouth against his, the taste of his tongue, the weight of his hand against the nape of his neck. They both knew that they wouldn’t be seeing each other for a long while, and this… This was the last reprieve either of them would hold in their grasp. Steve was the first to break their kiss, pulling away just enough to mumble against Tony’s lips, “I love you.”
The two of them stayed in a companionable silence for a long time. Steve was sitting on the edge of consciousness, teetering towards it, before Tony started to speak. “It was the same dream again. Can that be considered a dream? I hate it. I get that — uh, that feeling, y’know, in my chest like when Obadiah had pulled the Arc Reactor from my chest and… God, that helplessness just… lingers.”
“Ew, second-hand coffee breath! Did you really just—?”
~*~*~*~
“Love you,” Tony sighed against Steve’s mouth, the smile on his face wide and content.
Tony was exhausted. Physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted. Fighting off Ultron’s minions and ferrying the citizens of Sokovia into the repaired Helicarrier had taken more of a toll on him than he first realized. It wasn’t until the falling city had come raining down around him did Tony feel the fatigue slowly seeping into his bones.
“Oh, I don’t doubt it,” he replied, cackling as the rain continued to drench them from above. He leaned up on his elbows, feeling cold mud already sticking to the back of his clothes, and closed his eyes when Tony pressed a wet kiss to the top of his head. Clint and Nat’s voices were all they heard next as they physically started dragging Bucky away.
Natasha slowly raised a hand, a sheepish expression forming over her features. “Guilty.”
“Okay.”
THAT WASN"T A PRIVATE MESSAGE
“Will you tell us a story before lights-out?” Morgan asked as she hopped into her bed, tugging her comforter closer to her chest.
, be careful!”
“Some would say it brought our country closer to war,” Steve pointed out, lifting his gaze to meet Tony’s.
Steve nearly choked on his drink. “Like, a
team shirt as he cheered the loudest above others in the crowd.
Steve loved Tony. He loved him so much that he could write sonnets about the way his eyes lit up every time he’d figure out the solution to a problem; the way his dark hair would start to curl whenever he’d let it grow out; the way he found any excuse to be touching Steve’s skin, always leaving behind a trail of fire in his wake.
“Hi, honey,” Tony greeted, walking over to Steve and leaving a kiss to his hair as he passed by, catching a whiff of Steve’s usual shampoo. “Did the little squirt give you any trouble while I was gone?”
It seemed like Steve couldn’t scramble out of the car fast enough. He thanked Tony and Happy awkwardly, almost running up the short flight of stairs in an attempt to get away from the mortifying situation. Tony simply watched him with an amused smile, waving cheekily when Steve threw one last look over his shoulder.
Steve managed a small smile as he took a seat. He could sense Tony following his movements from the corner of his eye.
Sudden realization dawned on Tony’s face, followed by a slew of other things washing over his features. He reached up to brush his thumb over the rogue tear that slipped down Steve’s cheek. “Oh, Steve…”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re not breaking up with

than okay. It was Tony finally tearing down the walls he’d built up over the years. It was Tony trusting Steve, showing him just that by way of surging forward and pulling him into a searing kiss.
Peter tried to hide his growing grin, amused at the cute gesture. “Pops, I think the cheese in your post just gave me lactose intolerance.”
“Tony, someone’s going to come looking for us,” Steve pointed out, only half-resisting as Tony dragged him to the Bartons’ barn house.
Yes, sure, affirmative, right away.” Tony smirked, his eyebrows wagging on his forehead suggestively.
Tony, in the moment, sympathized with him. He probably would’ve also been praying for the earth to open up and swallow him whole if he were in Steve’s position. It wasn’t every day that your best friend of four hundred years discovered one of the many love letters that you wrote and never gave to them.
Tony countered, smirking, “Not worse than consulting on a magic cube, then having to save New York from said magic cube?” He let go of Steve’s hand, stepping closer to Bruce and throwing an arm over his shoulders. “Your blind optimism astounds me, Jolly Green. We’re talking SHIELD here.”

“Nice job selling the lie, Stark,” Fury interrupted, crossing his arms over his chest. “Threw a few people for a loop. You might’ve just secured enough sponsors for the Games just from that.”
“Because… because I say so, that’s why.”
cries for the first time. He wasn’t sure if it was him or Pepper who started crying more, because his vision was blurred with tears until they began trailing down his face.
