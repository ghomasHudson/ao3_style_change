Pepper is a marvelous actress, and even Tony manages to look at least slightly concerned, but Steve isn’t too worried about people looking too hard for Obadiah Stane. The man wasn’t well loved to say the least and in Steve’s experience, as long as the company still provides organs to people who need them, people are content to look the other way.
Phil sighs and opens a file on the tablet before handing it over. “We received this a few minutes before we got your signal. The reason we arrived so quickly is because we were already on our way to find you when you sent it.”
“Hey now. You’re our Captain, you can fix anything.” Bucky tips their foreheads together. “And even if you can’t, you’re gonna be okay. Might not seem like it now, but you will.”
“Yeah, uh.” Steve blushes, Tony’s eyes are very warm, and this is not what he thought he was getting into coming over here. “I’m gonna- I’ve gotta get back to them, you have no idea what they can get up to when I’m not there.”
And that, Dear Reader, is how the Stark Industries reign of terror comes to an understated end. The lost heir emerges from the shadows and becomes the leader the industry had been missing.
They say it’s why he disappeared mere months after his father’s death. They say it’s because he’s more machine than man, now. His body couldn’t keep up with his mind, and he outgrew all the prosthetics they made to keep him together. They say that’s why he hasn’t been seen in public in years. Others say he’s dead, and that’s why Obadiah took over. Some say Obadiah had him killed, or that he’s been locked in the bowels of Stark Industries forced to create for endless profit.
“Best terrible idea I’ve ever had.” There’s nothing that can stop Tony from kissing that shitty little grin off Steve’s stupidly beautiful face.
“What? Yeah, I guess so.” Steve shrugs. “I mean, it was worth it at the time. And it’s not- I know people who have it way worse than me. My friend, she was basically bought out of this horrible human trafficking ring, so they’ve got her for life too, and she had no one ‘til she found us. And Cl – her other friend, he was deafened in an explosion when working a job with his brother, they rebuilt his ears and fixed his legs, so he’s with us too. It’s not so bad. We’re like family, we’re all we’ve got, and we’re all we need.” He’s rambling, trying to do something to assuage the awful guilty, haunted expression on Tony’s face.
“Too soon? Okay, too soon.” The smile is back on Tony’s face, only a hint of shadow showing it was ever gone. “But I want to give this a shot. I’m – I’m pretty stupidly gone over you, and that’s not changing anytime soon.”
“Nothing, absolutely nothing, the crisis has passed. You don’t need to worry about me. But, uh, if you happened to, I don’t know, come across me, say, in a bar, would you say I looked good?” He is the epitome of casualness, no one has ever been more casual than him in this moment, even when he realizes he forgot to put a shirt on for her to judge. He pokes at a model trachea someone (DUM-E) left on the table. It’s fine, but there needs to be more support for the voice box.
“Sir.” She takes her leave before she does something she will regret and goes to begin a termination notice for whoever is unlucky enough to be on Stane’s kill list.
He has to get up. He has to get back to the mark, or at the very least down to the bunkroom so that he can tell someone, and they can finish the job for him.
“These are different.” Phil takes a hold of Clint’s arms, but purposefully, not in a sexy way. This is not how it usually goes when Phil visits him when he’s on duty. Clint frowns. “Clint, this is serious. They’re saying we’re going to be moving away from I.R.O.N. transplants, into a new biogenerated system that the R&D department is developing.”
The movement sets each of Tony’s nerve endings on fire while flooding his veins with ice water. He blacks out from the sheer intensity of the pain and comes back to reality to see Obadiah holding the cylindrical object up, inspecting all the wires that have been ripped loose. The weight on his chest intensifies, breathing a now near impossible task, and he falls down to the floor against the desk while Obadiah watches.
“Well, maybe they don’t know you like I do.” Steve brushes some hair away from Tony’s face. “Maybe they don’t see you like I do.”
“…I still love him. I didn’t know I could love someone so much, and I don’t know what to do with that, not with everything I’ve seen.”
“Yeah, I know, I’m a font of knowledge regarding interpersonal communication.” Bucky hoists himself to his feet and holds a hand out to Steve. “Now c’mon. Coulson and Tasha have to be done hiding the body by now, and they’re going to be pissed if we miss the meeting.”
“Steve?” God, his voice is pathetically weak, and he clears his throat before he tries again. “Steve, I could use a hand. Two, even, if you’ve got another one to spare.”
It’s a means of survival that Steve’s developed, letting the darkness fall around him. On nights like these, Steve Rogers lets everything go. The trusted friend, the brother, the lover, all that’s good in him is left to die.
“Interesting.” Tony has that light in his eyes again, the one he has when he’s unraveling a complicated problem. “So, you’re saying that I shouldn’t be held accountable for the things I was forced to do when I was defenseless and concerned for the health and safety of the people around me?”
Phil nods. “You can do anything you want. Stark Industries has effectively relinquished any claim they may have over you, for employment or otherwise.”
The bar is exactly what he feared; dark with blind spots everywhere, people huddled around the bar itself and at tables in the back. It’s only through a feat of divine intervention (or perhaps divine engineering) that Clint can spot them, and they’re waved over to the table he’s commandeering with Natasha.
The blade makes little noise as it slices through skin, flesh, and sinew. The predator’s movements are perfunctory, there is little flash or joy in his practice, he would seem almost reluctant or bored if his face were visible through the mask he wears. Unenthusiastic though he may be, he is not squeamish or hesitant and the job is done quickly. The young man’s liver and heart are removed with as little mess as possible, a syringe is inserted into his vein and fills, shining with a glowing blue serum, and his body is left for the morning collection.
“Yeah, yep. I know exactly what I can and cannot do, thank you.” He turns away from her, he will not entertain that expression in his lab. No. Where the fuck is – he finds the crate of blue vials under a table, right where he left them “I’ll look over the plans and get them back to you soon. Will that be all, Ms. Potts?”
Phil and Natasha share an uneasy look. Phil sighs and looks at Steve in something like sympathy, or pity. “That’s the particularly…problematic part.”
“Nope! No, absolutely not. How could anyone be here, I’m a princess in a tower, locked up with no one allowed to visit.” He looks over his shoulder and sees Steve stepping out. “Love you, bye.”
Unfortunately, Anthony didn’t always see this as the honor his father believed it to be. Anthony had a reckless youth, full of drinking and cavorting, doing all sorts of things that a father would never approve of, especially one grooming his son to be a leader. These particular extracurriculars also had the side effect of destroying Anthony’s body, while trying to escape from the prison that was his quicksilver mind.
. Steve, with his morning bedhead and the way he can never remember to throw his socks in the laundry basket. Steve, who always takes his leftovers home, who never fails to try to make the little kids smile when they’re at the next table over in restaurants. The man who can memorize a map in less than ten seconds, but took three months to use the toaster out of pure stubbornness.
He’s walking back to their table in the back when he hears, “You might, if you look hard enough.” He looks back over his shoulder and sees Tony watching him walk away. He raises his glass in return and turns back around, a bit of a spring in his step. He gets back to the table and notices that they’re all staring at him, and Steve sighs.
And it’s certainly better than sitting in the lab that’s been feeling incredibly claustrophobic as it’s gotten increasingly difficult not to jump Steve’s bones. He just…sits there, sketching or laughing or just talking and Tony just wants to go over and smush his face or something slightly less G-rated. It’s taken a significant amount of self-restraint not to act on the stupid feelings-type-definitely-not-love-thing he’s currently nurturing, only because he doesn’t want to fuck over the best friendship he’s never had.
An uncontrollable snort escapes Steve, though he tries valiantly to school his face serious again. He catches Tony sneaking a look out him out of the corner of his eye and gives up on hiding his amusement. Some of the tension drains out of Tony’s figure, and he relaxes even more once he steps out onto the lawn of the rooftop park.
Bucky and Clint share a glance, and Bucky sighs. “Listen, I don’t know Tony like you do, and I don’t want to know Tony like you do, but from what I do know, he doesn’t seem like the type to appreciate people deciding what’s best for him. Especially after being shut away for the last ten years.”
But his cries are cut short by the impact of a blunt object to his temple, knocking him unconscious. He slumps further against the side of the dumpster as his assailant retrieves his tool and sets down his case. The box opens with a quiet hiss and some smoke as pressure is released, and the predator retrieves a curious knife from within. The weapon is double bladed, one edge serrated and the other smooth and razor sharp, for delicate work. The predator leans over his prey, and murmurs a quiet apology, the same one he offers to all his victims. He tests the weight of the knife in his hand, as though it would have changed since the last time, the last hundred times he has done this. He clenches his fist around the blade and begins to work.
So yeah, Pepper is one of the main reasons he gets his shit together. Stark Industries becomes a leader in the clean energy sector, Tony promotes Pepper because he knows she wouldn’t want to date her boss (and this way he gets to date his boss which is
), and he starts paying attention. He pays attention when she really needs him to sign things, even though he’s the lowly head of R&D now. He pays attention when she finally lets him take her out, and she talks about art all the way through the Guggenheim. (The first time he kisses her tastes like strawberries and sunshine.)
“Thank you, Jarvis, for answering a question I didn’t ask.” Tony rolls his eyes. “The point is, there are certain philosophers that would argue that I’m not even fully human, and others who would say that I’m a freak of nature – “
“And you know we’re gonna give you shit until you do it.” Bucky slides a credit card across the table and settles back against the back of the booth. “Might as well cut your losses.”
They’re sitting in Central Park on a gorgeous summer day, surrounded by families also enjoying the lovely weather and pretending not to recognize them. Steve was sitting on the blanket with Tony reclining next to him, balling up pieces of paper napkin and throwing them so they got caught in Tony’s hair. Tony had been rambling about something and Steve was laughing at something he said, silhouetted against the afternoon sun. He looked so happy and bright, so different than the man who had come out of the ice, and Tony was so proud of him. So proud that he was strong enough to admit that he was hurting, that he sought out help from his teammates, and that he had finally accepted that even though they were gone, his people and his time would always be a part of him.
Steve turns at the movement in his peripheral vision to find Bucky tossing him his shield, the rest of his team ready to go. He stares in surprise.
“Tony.” Steve laughs again, “I’m not a model. I’m an admin assistant, I just do whatever needs doing.”
“In essence, it releases the four of you from your contracts and agrees to reimburse you any back pay you should have been owed. It cites a certain clause in your contracts which indicates that the contract can’t be signed under duress, and essentially admits to taking advantage of all of you when it was signed.” Phil shifts a little. “I also have the option to take a very reasonable severance package and leave the company with no ill will, or instead take an incredibly generous raise and stay, but that’s beside the point.”
“We all know you’re perfectly capable, Nat. No one’s doubting your inherent badassery. But you also don’t have to put yourself through something unnecessarily painful if you don’t want to.”
They both dissolve into giggles, Steve collapsing more onto Tony and burying his face into his neck. Tony can feel where his lips are tracing three words into his skin, over and over again.
“What? Obviously we weren’t going to let you go up there alone. That guy looks fucking crazy.” Bucky shakes his head in disappointment. “And since you won’t leave it be, we’re coming with you to save your boyfriend’s ass.”
“Because of all those things!” Steve would feel bad for shouting, but he's had enough. “Because he had to watch me attack his friend, because someone he once cared very much about almost
“Yeah, Jarvis?” Tony frowns a little and looks at the schematic Jarvis has pulled up for him, he usually doesn’t interrupt when Steve’s here.
“Sir?” Natasha waits silently at the door for further instruction, tablet lighting up her face in the dim office. Obadiah Stane stands with his back to her, facing the plasma screens that hang behind his desk. He’s got a tracking screen open, red dots making trails around a map of the city, and a smaller area enlarged with a single dot tracking around a floor plan. Headshots of her team, the ones on duty anyway, their vitals on display.
Especially once Captain America comes back, Thor arrives, and the Avengers band together, Pepper can’t understand why he can’t let someone else step in. She asks him, begs him even, to take a backseat. Give Rhodey a suit, or give SHIELD Iron Man. He tries to explain that he can’t give up the suit, it’s a part of him as much as the reactor is. That he can’t give Rhodey a suit, not because he doesn’t trust him with it, but because he doesn’t trust the Army to use him as a weapon, not a hero.
” Tony sets the box back down and pulls Yinsen into a tight hug. He’s definitely not crying, there’s probably just rain coming in through a window. Even though they’re in a basement. It could happen. “Thank you. I’ve never – just, thank you.” Yinsen grips him back just as tightly, and Tony lets himself enjoy it just for a second before he pulls away.
“Phil, there are always rumors.” Clint groans, pulling Phil against him again. “They’ve got rumors for every day of the week, it doesn’t mean they mean anything.”
He sighs heavily, “I have no fucking clue. I don’t know if he even wants to speak to me ever again, much less be anything like we were before. And – he didn’t kill Yinsen, but he didn’t have nothing to do with it either. I don’t know if I can get past that, Pep.”
“Hi, Tony. You ready?” Goddammit, Steve's puppy eyes do it to him every time. Absolutely worth the lecture he’s going to get from Pepper later for hanging up on her.
“No one’s saying it is, Steve.” Bucky holds his hands up in surrender. “All we’re doing is asking you to be cautious. You barely know the guy, we don’t want you doing, or saying, anything stupid.”
“I can’t just want to see you, Pep, my sunshine, moon of my life?”  Jarvis beeps a warning disapprovingly at him from the computer, blood toxicity above acceptable levels. Tony swears under his breath and looks around for where he left his zydrate. The stuff is awful, but it’ll keep him from dying for at least a little while longer, so it’s worth it.
“What?” Steve whips his head around from where he’d been surveying the other patrons in the bar. “Why? I don’t drink.”
“You know if we have to consult anyone it’s going to add at least another two months before we have anything remotely workable, even in a test group.” Pepper is so experienced at cutting through his bullshit, it isn’t even fun anymore. Tony sighs his most put-upon sigh, but she doesn’t even flinch. Shit. This is serious.
“How cool is this?” Clint says, downing half his beer in one go. “A bar in the basement of an R&D building? I knew Howard Stark was on the level.”
“Maybe that’s what I’m aiming for, Captain.” Clint winks back, and Steve allows the chuckle it draws out. Maybe he has been staying in too long. He’s forgotten how much he likes hanging out with his team.
“Don’t you talk about him.” Tony very near snarls the words, unprepared for the rush of possessive rage that rises in his throat at the mention of Steve’s name. “He has nothing to do with this.”
) had given him only minutes before. He tries to open the section where the power source will sit, but his fine motor skills are suffering, what with the imminent organ failure that he’s currently going through. Tony’s cursing the goddamn thing when the door opens again and he freezes.
are a super-secret assassin man. Said boytoy then watched you assault someone he cares about, knocked you over the head with a fire extinguisher – yeah, we saw the footage of that and we’re very disappointed in your reflexes – and then still released you and everyone you care about from our contracts out of the goodness of his heart.”
“I’m not dancing around this shit.” Tony’s mouth sets in a firm line. “Steve, do you think I’m an abomination?”
“At once, sir.” The dentist-chair/torture machine in the corner of the lab buzzes gently, mechanical arms stretching and readying for the procedure. Tony loads the vial into the insertion arm, and settles into the chair, calling up the holographic control display. Normally he wouldn’t allow anyone to fuck around with his body (heh), but he built this system himself, and with Jarvis operating, there’s no one he trusts more.
“Was I? I must have lost track, I was waiting for someone.” He recovers enough to send Steve a wink, to watch that blush spread again. “I think I found him though.”
Let me know what you think? This is my first fic with like Real Emotional Problems and if I'm handling them well/badly, please let me know
“So, using brand new technology based on recent breakthroughs in bio-tech integration, we’re going to get people the organs and treatment they need, for free. We’re going to subsidize it by selling clean arc reactor technology, creating a world we all will want to live in. It’s not going to be easy, but it’s going to work.”
He can’t remember his mom at all, so of course he wouldn’t remember if she told him she loved him. She died in a car accident when he was barely one, and from the way he acted, Howard probably wished Tony had gone with her.
“Stop making me laugh.” He bites down on a smile. “I’m pretty sure you had something else in mind by bringing me out here.”
“Don’t be a dick, Barnes, get everyone one while you’re at it.” Clint finishes his own bottle and sets it next to Natasha’s. “I don’t have to be back at that hellhole for another nine hours, and I plan on being drunk for at least four of them.”
“Hey, uh. Did we miss the party?” Tony stands up straighter when everyone turns to look at him. “I’ve gotta say, for a bunch of assassins, you’ve managed to kill exactly no people. It doesn’t say much for your productivity.”
Steve’s reluctance to talk about his past, the cushy secretary job that Steve always seemed embarrassed and hesitant to say much about, how Steve was always around, like he never seemed to leave the building. It all makes a disturbing amount of sense.
Pepper crosses to the podium again and places a gentle hand on Tony’s arm. “Mr. Stark will be taking no more questions. We’ll be sending out more press releases later in the week, but for now we thank you for your time.” Tony barely stays until the end of her sentence, walking briskly away and off the stage.
If you were to walk the streets of New York in the year 2121, Dear Reader, you would see a much different world than the one of a hundred years before. Those dangerous streets, which you should not walk alone for the sake of your own well-being, have become the territory of a predator far more dangerous and cunning than your average criminal. This predator is discerning and only stalks a certain type of prey, so hypothetically there should be no cause for you to worry.
“Right. Of course, you all do.” Pepper opens a drawer of Obie’s desk and takes out what appears to be a hellishly expensive bottle of bourbon. “I’m taking Tony to get medical attention. I will see you all in my office tomorrow morning at ten, not a minute before, and we will figure out what the fuck we’re doing with this company.” She slides an arm around Tony and takes him out of Steve’s hold. Her face does something complicated when she looks between them, and Tony doesn’t protest when she leads him out of the office.
“Buck, no, c’mon,” Steve definitely doesn’t whine, “I’m tired. I don’t want to go out. Plus, we’re on call tonight. We have to be on company property to respond if a new notice comes in.”
“Yeah. Yeah, you too, Tony.” He bites his lip and takes just a little leap. “Maybe I’ll see you here again? Sometime soon?”
Tony sighs a little and flops down onto the grass. His eyes are closed against the sunshine, but he opens them again when a shadow falls across his face. He squints up to see a beaming Steve standing over him. “You’re blocking my sun there, Rogers.”
To say Howard wasn’t an involved parent was a massive understatement. He barely looked at Tony, much less professed any sort of affection for him. Even when he was a child, Howard tried to hold him to an impossible set of standards, and Tony always fell short. The nannies hired to handle him were nice, but never really understood Tony or his quicksilver mind, and as a result did their job and nothing more. He was kept in the manor and away from the general population of children, because he was still the son of Howard Stark and it wouldn’t be right for him to interact with normal children. So yes, Tony grew up without people around him to coddle him. But everyone has to grow up sometimes, he just happened to be an early bloomer.
There’s one wriggling worm of a thought that won’t leave him alone, the one bit of doubt to ruin his happiness. He still hasn’t found the right moment to explain to Tony about his moonlighting as a Repo Man, but. He’s just.
“Oh, shit.” Steve winces, and looks over Bucky’s shoulder at the tablet at the unlucky person. Ho Yinsen, apparently a senior engineer for the company, is a spectacled, gentle looking man. No one ever deserves being put on their list, in Steve’s opinion, but he can’t imagine this man doing anything that would warrant Natasha’s attention. Then again, it’s not in Steve’s job description to question why certain people are on their list and questioning whether the list is really for the good of the people
He fairly bounces out of his chair in excitement. “Peter Parker, from The Daily Bugle; Aren’t these business practices a little worrying? People have been worried about Stark Industries’ lack of transparency for years, and this hasn’t been any different. What are you doing to prove that this really is a new direction?”
“Why? What’s going on?” Tony stumbles back, almost tripping over the benches and boxes that litter the unused lab. “Yinsen, what’s happening?”
“I can only show you if you pay attention,” Yinsen tuts. “I don’t know what could possibly be more important than the device keeping you alive.”
“Don’t let Coulson hear you talking like that. The point is, it’s been a wild day and you’re here pouting with us, not talking things out with him. Why not?”
The high-rise office is dark when they stop out of the elevator, unusual even at this late hour. Pepper lives at the office almost as much as Tony does, it’s weird to see it unoccupied.
(And he has it on good authority that he is the only one who is intimately familiar with this particular suit, thank-you-very-much)
Clint catches the bouncy ball he’d been throwing against the wall (it’s a point of pride that he hits the same place over and over again, there’s a little indentation in the wall where the rubber had made a lasting impression over time) and looks over to the source of the voice. From upside down on the bunk, the man leaning in the doorway is just a tall drink of water in a suit, but he is a tall drink of water who Clint is intimately familiar with.
Steve is ripped back to the present by Tony’s worried voice, crouching a few feet in front of him, hands up to show he’s not a threat. Steve blinks and Tony shuffles a little closer, sitting crosslegged in front of where Steve is curled with his knees to his chest.
“A truly unreasonable amount of therapy. And I know it might be a bit weird, being with your boss. Although if you think about it, this opens up some
“I think we’re definitely trending more toward sinkhole territory. So, let’s review.” Bucky lays down and kicks his feet up against the bed, counting on his fingers. “You found out that your boytoy isn’t a recluse by choice and has instead been legally dead for about a decade. He’s not just the head of R&D, he’s Howard’s Stark heir and lost son. He also learned that
So Tony levered himself up, and slowly, so achingly slowly to give him time to turn away, pressed his lips against Steve’s. Steve gasped against his mouth and then pressed back, keeping the kiss innocent but making sure Tony knew that he was enjoying it too. When he pulled back, Steve beamed at him, all golden in the sun and absolutely, breathtakingly beautiful.
“I’m sure it’s not nearly as bad as what they get up to when you are there.” Tony smiles again, eyes crinkling. “It was really nice talking to you, Steve.”
“No one has seen him for years, true.” Natasha gives him a significant look. “No one has reported seeing him for years. But suddenly you start seeing a brilliant inventor, tell him of your troubles, and now we’re released from our contracts?”
By this point, Steve has turned fully to face him, a look of slight confusion and wonder on his face, “A memorial scholarship?”
“Listen, let’s be honest for a minute. For the past fifteen years Stark Industries has been taking advantage of the poor and sick and selling meaningless upgrades to the rich and pointless. I should know, I am a personification of everything that has gone wrong with this company.”
He may be distracted, but he’s not completely oblivious, which is why the mood in the bunk hits him like a wall when he walks in. His whole team is waiting with grim looks on their faces, focused on Natasha’s tablet. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
Despite numerous attempts to drive him away, and plenty of situations where walking away would have been the easiest option, James becomes Rhodey and earns his title of Best Friend. Tony learns how to interact with someone who doesn’t want his money, and Rhodey finds stability in the one person he never expected would have it. Tony may be wild, but he is a constant; anytime Rhodey asks, he’s there. They’re there for each other, and it’s really that simple. Until it’s not.
But you shouldn’t listen to these things, Dear Reader. They’re just rumors. And nothing good has ever come from rumors.
He doesn’t know how that sentence would have ended but it doesn’t matter because Steve is leaning in and pressing their lips together and it’s everything Tony has ever wanted. Steve kisses gently, almost hesitantly, even after Tony reciprocates enthusiastically. It makes Tony want to slow down and savor it, which is why he pulls back with a sigh.
“Yeah, well. Count it as my community service for the year.” He finally sets everything to sleep mode and scheduled some modules to run while he’s gone. “Are you ready, or do you want to stay and chat in my lab all day? I can leave you alone with Jarvis, if you want to spend more quality time together.”
“Me too, god, Tony I’m there too. I wouldn’t trade meeting you for the world, and now that we get to have a real chance at this?” He leans forward to touch their foreheads together. “I swear, I’m never going to let anyone hurt you again. They’re going to have to go through me first.”
“How do you see me?” Good God, if his voice were any breathier, he’d be a heroine from a romance novel. But there’s nothing that could make him take back that question, there’s nothing he wants to hear more than the answer to that question.
But that’s not as distressing as seeing him pull a gun and aim it at Tony, Steve jolts to his feet in panic. “Jarvis, is this current?”
” He breathes out harshly and flexes his fingers where his knuckles have gone white. “So, they strapped me to a chair – like that one – and stuck me with something, I still don’t know what, but it burned like hell and I woke up like this. Bucky signed his own life over to Stark Industries to make sure I still had one to live. And then I did the same for him when he lost his arm – vehicle accident, never found the driver. I signed, they strapped him in, and he had an arm back.”
The figure turns on the little screen, towards the door Tony knows he’s currently hiding behind. It stalks forward, and Tony glances around frantically for something, anything. He grabs a fire extinguisher and waits beside the door.
To put it simply, Steve is the one Tony feels most comfortable around. Steve is the only one who will venture into the workshop for long periods of time, just enjoying the relative silence of Tony tinkering with the armor or new upgrades for various projects and sketching or reading. He is also usually the one to drag Tony to “family dinners”, or if they aren’t eating together, will bring him food to the workshop or drag him out to some new place he just has to try. Tony can’t pinpoint the exact moment he and Steve started dating, but he knows he won’t ever forget their first kiss.
“Sit, sit.” Tony flaps a hand vaguely in the direction of the couch and Steve takes it as the invitation is represents. “If you’re going to be hanging about, you might as well be comfortable.”
Muffled gunshots echo through the door to Obiadiah’s office, shocking the two of them out of the weird staring contest they’re caught in.
Perhaps this is where their story ends. Or maybe there are more adventures in their future. Either way, the most important thing is that they’ll never face them alone.
She won’t go out with him, which is definitely a smart move on her part. Everyone’s read the stories in the tabloids about Tony Stark and his revolving door of different beautiful women (and men, but those stories tend to stay quiet, paid off by Obie). No rational woman would willingly enter into a relationship with a man with those kinds of extracurricular activities. To be fair, Tony probably wouldn’t even date himself at this point.
“Yes, yes, fine. Use anything you might need, and make it look as if I’m running the ship, will you, J?”
“I have some plans for you to approve, and I’m here to remind you that you have a meeting in the morning with Yinsen and Obediah about the next iteration of your arc reactor.” She sets an impressively tall stack of files on a different bench, he’ll have to remind Jarvis to file them later, and then crosses her arms. “What did you want to talk to me about?”
isn’t part of it, but he can’t help it. Regardless, thoughts like that aren’t going to solve the problem in front of them. “I’m sorry, Natasha.”
“Who said anything about a relationship? He’s a guy at a bar, just go talk to him.” Clint raises an eyebrow in response to Steve’s offended look. “What’s the worst that could happen?”
College is everything you’d expect, being a sixteen-year-old in an adult’s world. He fights too hard to be recognized, he speaks too loud to make sure he’s heard, and while he’s a genius in the laboratory, he gets lost in trying to navigate the social parts of the college experience. Tony tries too hard to impress, tries to be a part of everything, and only ends up hunched over the toilet in someone’s apartment with another guy he doesn’t know patting his back.
Steve whips around to find the man seated at the bar next to him smirking and raising an eyebrow at his order. He's attractive, though very pale under olive-toned skin, but his eyes are warm and dark and they draw Steve in immediately.
“Because from the minute I was born I was a walking, talking science experiment. I was operated on for the first time when I was nine.” Tony breaks their eye contact and starts shredding the grass under his fingers. “You never knew Howard Stark, or at least I don’t think you ever formally met, but he wasn’t ever going to be the world’s greatest dad. Not that he would have cared, he never tried to hide that Stark Industries would always be his biggest focus. A lot of what was done later was necessary, from when I was young and angry and tried pretty hard to destroy my body. Drugs, drinking, physical exhaustion, you name it, I’ve done it over and over again. I’ve been put under and operated on so many times I’ve lost track. If you asked, Jarvis could tell you the exact percentage of original human I have left in my body, but believe me, it’s not a lot.”
Steve manages to fit the vibranium sample into the reactor, then looks between it and Tony’s chest nervously. “Now what?”
a beautiful piece of engineering. Your father would be proud, Anthony. It’s a shame you were such a disappointment in every other way.” Obadiah looks down at him, considering. “I suppose I could shoot you, but I want you to know that you’ve failed. That despite all the labor and parts we put into keeping you alive, you still ended up beaten and broken. Goodbye, Anthony.”
“It’s not something that’s come up officially yet, but it’s not far off.” Phil steps towards him and his hands twitch as if they want to reach out, but they clench into fists at his side. “You have to understand, they can’t let you go. Any of you. You all have too much information, too much influence.”
“It’s not my fault everyone wants a piece of this.” He claps a hand to Steve’s shoulder and steers him away from the sink, the beds, the sweet call of sleep. “Come on, Tasha will have my balls if we make her wait.”
“For the genius, lone-wolf head of Research and Development of Stark Industries? C’mon, there’s nothing you can’t handle.” Steve scoots closer and nudges their shoulders together. He’s warm, Steve is always so warm, it’s a shock particularly in the cold air of the lab. It contrasts sharply with the cold weight sitting in Tony’s chest as he lies to Steve’s face.
“You improved, yes, but it still wasn’t perfect. Zydrate was never going to be a sustainable option, so I’ve had come up with something cleaner to use.” Yinsen pulls up some files on the projection screen, old weapons schematics. He sees guns and a prosthetic arm, knives, a bow, some kind of shield?
Stane is focusing not on the trackers, but on another screen on display, charting patent expiration dates and stock prices. She tries to read the list he’s making, but he moves in front of it before she can get a good look. She ducks her head in case he chances a look back at her, the absolute picture of subservience.
Steve rolls his eyes. “Thank you so very much. Now, I’m late, and I still have to pick up lunch. So if you’ll excuse me – “ He gives them a quick wave before he walks away.
Steve is fairly sure he doesn’t actually skip down to the bunkroom to report in for his night shift, but he’s less sure there’s not a permanent grin on his face from spending an afternoon kissing Tony in his lab. It’s only been a few weeks, but he’s not sure that grin is ever gonna fade, and he’s increasingly certain he doesn’t want it to.
But there are other images flashing before him now. Photos he’s seen from the Repossession files, newspaper articles about the people who had been found dead, others that had simply disappeared.
Tony smiles a little. “He did. He always will. But I think he’d be proud with the direction we’re going in, and that’s what is really important.” He stares at their clasped hands. “So. A lot of therapy.”
“So if you don’t make payments, they can kill you from anywhere?” Clint shouldn’t be horrified, especially with his job description, but it all just seems so
“After which you saved his life and then watched his other friend murder his former guardian and father figure who had stabbed him in the back. Which, honestly,” Clint leans over the edge of the bunk with stars in his eyes, “Was super badass. I’m a little in love.”
“Sir?” Before Steve can reconcile this new information with the Tony he just saw walking out of his life, Jarvis pings his tablet. “There appears to be a situation developing on the sixty-eighth floor. I believe this footage may be of interest to you.” Despite being a machine, Jarvis manages to sound strangely tense and when the video starts playing, Steve realizes why. His heart hurts when he sees Tony carrying Yinsen through the office, settling him in a chair and fussing over him. Steve, as well as Phil and Natasha watching over his shoulder, tenses when Obadiah enters the office. If Tony’s been hidden from the world for decades, there’s no way that Obadiah didn’t at least have a hand in orchestrating the whole thing. The very sight of him makes Steve’s skin crawl.
“Quick job.” Steve pulls off his helmet and tosses it in his locker, stripping off the rest of his equipment and armored suit as he goes. Once he’s down to his undershirt, he goes over to the sink to splash his face with water, scrubbing his face with his hands. “And a good thing, too. I’m beat, and we’ve gotta be in the office in less than twelve hours.”
“Sorry, I couldn’t call or anything and it took me a while to find you. You’re not in one of the main R&D offices, and I got a bit turned around.” There’s an old but comfortable looking couch occupying one corner of the lab, but Steve stays standing awkwardly just inside of the elevator.
Parameters defined in the algorithm, he just has to sit back and relax as the used vial is extracted from his chest, and the new one is inserted. A heat he hadn’t realized was building in his chest dissipates, and he sighs in relief. Once the chair releases him, he pats DUM-E’s mechanical arm and heads back to the bedroom attached to his lab, an extension of his quarters (prison). Tony roots around a bit for a clean, somewhat flattering shirt, until Jarvis interjects, “Sir?”
“Yeah, yeah, real original. Gimme.” Tony makes grabby hands for the sandwiches Steve brought with them. Steve tosses him one, and he catches and tears into it. There’s very little better than an authentic roast beef sandwich from whatever magical deli where Steve has connections, and Tony has killed men for less.
good, even. Yeah, they fight, but honestly, what couple doesn’t? Steve doesn’t think he should be spending over 36 hours in the workshop, Tony sometimes chafes under Steve’s possessiveness.
) and finish the job, in addition to ensuring that there are no witnesses. Steve also knows that he will not be doing that.
Steve pokes his head over the back of the couch, looking baffled and a touch amused. “Tony? Babe, are you alright?”
Even with the earlier joke in the elevator, Steve still hadn’t thought that Tony would still be speaking to him. “Uh, well, as part of your security team, I should really– “
“Steve.” Tony finally makes the eye contact he’s been avoiding. “We’re trying to make sure Obie’s plans don’t result in the death of any more people, particularly your team. I’m barely standing, and you look about as terrible as I feel. This is really not the time.”
“Thanks, Tony. Uh, can I buy you a drink? Or not a drink, if you’re not drinking?” He sounds so goddamn hopeful, where did this guy come from?
“No, Pep, I know. Believe me, I am very aware of what Obie wants. And I’m going as fast as I can, it’s just going to take time–“
Steve almost laughs at how fast the kid is scribbling, or he would if he wasn’t listening single-mindedly to Tony, hope and despair warring in his chest.
He and Yinsen hobble into the elevator, and Tony braces him against the wall in order to free an arm to press the button for Pepper’s office. He takes out his tablet and reopens the files he abandoned earlier. He uses a finger to sign in the authorization box, and hovers over the send button. Tony looks up and makes eye contact with a very bleary Steve through the closing doors, holding it until he’s out of sight and the slight movement of the elevator indicates that they’re moving. He sighs and presses ‘send’, because no matter what they’ve done, even who and what they are, no one deserves this.
She sighs and pushes his face away with an affectionate hand, and hands Steve the tablet with the other. “Take it. Otherwise this one is just going to mother me the whole time. I don’t put up with that nonsense, not even when it was from my own mother.”
Steve can feel the force of Tony’s eye roll all the way from the back of the stage, and he has to fight not to join in. To his right, Bucky and Clint are snickering at the reporters practically salivating for a story and placing bets on which ones are gonna draw first blood. Natasha and Phil, on the other side, practically radiate disapproval at the entire spectacle.
Steve stares at the legal document that has given him back a future. “Who authorized this? I can’t imagine Obadiah giving us up that easily.”
(Clint knows Phil can’t resist how his arms look in his uniform, which is the unofficial reason behind many late-night visits to Coulson’s office.)
“No, that’s okay. I think I’d rather spend my lunch break with you.” Steve knocks his ridiculously wide shoulder against Tony’s own.
Steve’s gaze catches on the gaping hole in Tony’s chest before he drags it away to make eye contact. There’s so many emotions flying across Steve’s face, and honestly Tony doesn’t have the time or the emotional bandwidth to handle any of them right now.
(No one comments on the protectors that now prowl the streets, ensuring that the weak and defenseless are never again exploited. The only people that fear them have good reason to, and more often than not they’re left at the door of the police station to be punished to the fullest extent of the law.)
Natasha would never do anything so obvious as shift her weight guiltily, but her face goes slightly more blank, and she takes a step back before nodding. Bucky punches Steve in the shoulder (with his flesh and blood arm, so Steve knows he isn’t mad) and says, “Fine, pal. It’s your funeral.”
“I can always leave,” Steve says, teasingly. They both know he would be sitting alone in the bunkroom if he wasn’t here, waiting for Clint and Bucky to return safe. “If you don’t want the pleasure of my company, I don’t –“ He stops abruptly when he sees the chair, tucked back in another corner of the workshop, and the memories come flooding back.
“He wouldn’t have listened.” Bucky crosses his arms again. “Plus, they’re completely stupid over each other. One of them is going to slip up and say something, and then it’ll all be out anyway. And Steve won’t hate us for telling him too soon. It’s a win-win.”
Steve blinks and looks around, coming out of a daze he only partly remembers. He’s cleaning out his locker, apparently, packing the novels and sketchbooks into a backpack. “What?”
Steve drags his hands down his face and takes a deep breath. He knows they love him and they’re just trying to show him they care. But he’s not a child. “Listen. I appreciate this, really. And I won’t tell you not to go snooping around for his file, because I know you already have. But
“I just shoved a piece of untested tech into my system. Yes, Steve, dying painfully was one of the possible outcomes.” Tony takes a deep breath, thankful that he can even do so, and coughs a little. “Jarvis, could I get an update on vital systems?”
He knows that what he feels for Tony goes beyond fleeting attraction or even casual affection. There’s something that’s
They seem to understand the part of him that’s still searching for redemption. Clint is good at distracting him, distracting the both of them really, and dragging him out of the lab when it’s really been too long. He comes up with ridiculous specifications for arrows and outrageous robots he suddenly needs. It lets Tony blow stuff up in the name of progress, so he’s a keeper.
“How is this going to fly with patients? It’s going to scare people, and scared people are more likely to run.”
He blinks at movement in the doorway, two blurry figures departing, one supporting the other. He blinks again and everything clears a little more. Even half blinded, he would recognize the shape of Tony’s body anywhere, and Steve’s heart almost stops. He’s completely frozen, unable to move or reconcile what he’s seeing with the two distinct boxes he had stuffed his life into. But when he makes eye contact with Tony and he sees the haunted, broken look on his face, he knows that those two boxes have collided. Worse, he knows that Tony knows, and with that knowledge he has destroyed everything that they had started to build together.
“No, of course not.” Steve sits back down in front of Tony and takes one of his hands gently. “I wouldn’t have gotten near him if I had known. None of us would have. For what it’s worth, we’ve been looking for a way out for years. Coulson too; he was the first person who really cared about any of us. You’ve been the second. And I know I’ve said it already, but Tony, I’m so sorry about what happened to Yinsen. I know he meant a lot to you.”
“No, stop, it’s- it’s amazing. Tony, God, thank you. Thank you so much.” Steve strode towards him and kissed him sweetly, holding his face between his big hands. Tony grasped at his shirt with one hand, steadying himself against the couch with the other.
“No, but there’s a cute guy at the bar who’s been sneaking looks at you, and it’s been too long since you spoke to another human being.” He opens his mouth to protest and she cuts him off with a look. “Not counting people at work or one of us.”
“Obadiah?” Tony says hesitantly, still crouched over Yinsen. He shifts his body so he’s between the two of them. “What are you doing here?”
“Now we’re talking!” Clint goes to slide out of the booth, but Natasha grabs his arm and holds him in place.
“Steve. Just Steve.” He holds out his hand to shake, and the man takes it with a hand rougher than Steve expected, with what feels like some very interesting calluses.
Tony loves. Steve is using his nipples against him, the sneaky bastard. He knows how sensitive they are. “Wait, Steve, baby…”
“Because it’s true!” Tony fling his arms up, pieces of grass flying everywhere. “Everything I said at the press briefing, most of the things that reporters have said about me over the years – except the story about the bachelorette party and the goats, that was completely false – has been true.”
He must shift because Tony’s intense focus switches to him, and Steve briefly feels pinned before his gaze gentles, and they both feel the release of some measure of tension that had been hanging in the air.
“It’s gonna be okay, you’re gonna be fine.” Who exactly Tony is trying to reassure at this point is uncertain, the adrenaline is starting to wear off and he can see his hands shaking where he’s cleaning Yinsen’s cut.
“He was a good man.” Natasha’s face is more stoic than usual. “He cared about helping, about healing where he could, and I enjoyed working with him. One of the best people here.”
Because it’s those who can’t that this predator stalks. People who have fallen behind, who can no longer afford the organs so generously loaned to them by Obadiah Stane (for Anthony Stark disappeared from the public eye many years ago now, such a tragedy for one so young).
“I found an old design that might be of interest as a replacement for your current…apparatus, and I was simply inquiring as to whether you wished for me to make a prototype.”
“Yes, but you’re not allowed to be a pig about it.” She lifts her head and sends Steve a thin smile. “Ignore him, Pepper is lovely. How was your night, Steve?”
“Well, Clint, you were right on target. Right about three hours and forty-five minutes later, and the breakdown has arrived.”
“Oh my god, come on you guys. You have bedrooms for this sort of thing, there’s no need to – oh look, sandwiches!”
“Please, don’t worry for me.” He taps the boxes, “If these work the way they should, it will have been worth it. Be
” Oh, Tony was planning on staying calm but that’s clearly not a realistic goal. At the very least, he starts shuffling to the right, away from where Yinsen. “For the last decade, I’ve managed to produce every single thing you’ve demanded. All your crazy orders for cutting-edge technology every other week, every single fucking thing you’ve wanted I’ve made reality because you made it a
Thor, when he comes back, is larger than life in every way. (And since he seems to have an aversion to clothes, Tony does mean
“A meeting? A meeting about what? I thought being dead to the world meant I didn’t have to deal with meetings and bureaucracy anymore.” He shudders in disgust, crossing to a console to authorize Jarvis to run a blood toxicity test.
“Specialty weapons requests for repossession officials are streamlined, marked as high priority but low revenue yield. They’re generally deemed not important enough for you to bother with, it’s not likely you would have encountered them. But what they look like isn’t important, it’s what they’re made of.”
After Tony has to basically reevaluate his entire fucking life, and figured out that Pepper was the only good thing he had left from his life before Iron Man.
Once his head stops ringing enough for him to sit up and push himself standing, Steve slowly makes his way out of the labyrinth of laboratories. The elevator is, strangely, currently disabled, so he ends up taking the stairs. What he knows he should be doing is locating where Tony took the mark (
Tony. And I’ve never met someone so real, so genuine and unafraid to be themselves. I’ve never met anyone like you, no one could even come close. You’re beautiful, Tony, you
“What? Why?” Steve frowns, scrolling to the bottom of the document, and just stares. There’s a spiky, scrawled signature, barely recognizable as a name, but it’s the printed identifier below that catches his attention.
“You were in crisis mode.” Bucky settles on the bunk, wriggles uncomfortably, then slides down to the floor. “When you’re in crisis mode, all your feelings get pushed down deep into your feelings hole, and then, once the crisis has passed, they explode out of you like a trauma volcano.”
“Yeah, it is,” Tony agrees, eyes now glued to where Steve’s pulse thrums in his throat. He looks away when Steve glances back, ignoring any heat that spreads across the back of his neck at being caught watching. Tony clears his throat and focuses very hard on some pigeons sitting on the edge of the roof, “It’s nice to come up here, even just for a little bit. Especially when things are a bit – much.”
He taps a screen in front of him, emphasizing points on his list, then sighs and turns away. “Nothing, Ms. Rushman, thank you. I’ll need you to send a note to Pepper to reach out to her contact in Research and Development, inquire about the timeline of adding satellite tracking to the automatic failure software, and set up a skeleton patent application, I don’t want to have to wait around for the paperwork.”
“Because, Anthony, there’s still something I need from you.” And with that, Obadiah shifts his aim and shoots Yinsen in the head.
“Yeah, a full ride. A kid a year from a low income home will get to go to college for free. I know you didn’t exactly as for it, but I thought it was a good idea, you always talked about how he would have wanted to go to college if it hadn’t been, you know, the Depression. And this way, he will always be remembered by the people he helped. And I know you don’t like me spending money on you, but I thought this might be an exception. You can raise money for it, if you want, but if not it’ll be fully funded through Stark Industries.” Steve was still staring at him, and he honestly couldn’t identify the emotion on his face. “Um, Steve? Can you tell me if this is ok? I can’t tell if I fucked up or not. I did it to make you less sad. If it makes you upset, or if it was presumptuous or something I can undo it. Or, I think I can. Pepper can, anyway.”
A young man, likely not older than thirty, runs through an alley. His breath comes quickly, and he sends panicked glances behind him as he flees, stumbling in his haste to get away from his pursuer. He bangs on doors and windows as he goes, gasping for help, but the occupants are either out or know better than to intervene because no one answers his pleas.
“Yes, sir.” Natasha – Natalie here, but always truly Natasha – makes a note on her tablet. “And is there a particular criteria that you want me to base the testing group on?”
“Tony, c’mon. It can’t be a surprise.” Steve feels color rising to his cheeks, something hot and cold at the same time, something like shame. “I was sick all the time as a kid, scrawny and barely able to walk down the street without keeling over. One winter, it got real bad and Bucky was so scared, he thought I was dying. He had to drag me into the hospital, and even then, there wasn’t much they could do, apparently. Double pneumonia, anemia, iron deficiency, weak eyes, weak heart, weak lungs, weak fucking
and it’s going to take me time to make exactly what he wants, not to mention the fact that it won’t just be computer programming, there’s the biological component which makes everything more complicated, and really I should be consulting Banner because this isn’t exactly my area of expertise–“
Which, it turns out, is not such a serious diagnosis when your father’s company makes replacement organs. Livers, kidneys, stomachs, hearts, all replaceable when you have Howard Stark’s mind and resources. Word on the street is that there isn’t a single piece of Anthony Stark that remains from the original model, save his brain. (They haven’t yet come up with a substitute for that.) A different whisper on the street says Anthony didn’t want any of the upgrades given to him by his father. They say he protested the entire time, that he would have rather been left to die than to be made synthetic. Rumor is that’s why they called him “I.R.O.N. Man” before - well, before.
Steve puts his head in his hands. “There’s nothing left to fix. I closed that door the minute I walked into that lab, I doubt he’ll ever want to see me again.”
“But hey,” he starts again, trying to infuse some cheerfulness into his voice to break Tony out of whatever weird, trance-like state he’s in. “If I hadn’t undergone a Procedure, you never would have looked twice at me, so there’s some good that came out of it.”
He can’t quite articulate the feeling that the burning, exploding towns gave him, or the buildings falling around him while he flew with aliens. He can’t tell her how every time he helps his teammate or saves an innocent, he hates himself just that much less.
“We’re on it.” Having assessed the situation and clearly deeming Tony less than a threat, the redhead herds the other three people out of the lab, Man-Bun giving Tony a sharp look before he leaves.
By the time Rhodey ships off for his first tour, Tony has got his feet under him, is finishing up his degree, and is ready to get into the family business. They’re both very different from who they were when they first met, but when they shake hands before Rhodey leaves, all he can see is the scared teenager who was so alone and so frightened. Rhodey abandons the handshake and pulls Tony against him, mumbling something about taking care of himself before he hurries into the car.
“Well, what changed your mind? Since you were so goddamn generous before.” Tony’s eyes flick to the security camera, swiveling on its base. Jarvis has protocols in place for what to do if Tony’s life is ever in danger, and he can only hope they’ve been activated now.
“Sorry.” Steve ducks his head, the tips of his ears turning pink – fucking adorable. “You were very focused, I didn’t want to interrupt.”
“We were assessing the situation and trying to find a resolution with as little violence as possible.” Suit – Coulson, Tony thinks – looks particularly blank faced. And still pretty bad ass, even in flannel pajama bottoms. “Ms. Potts took matters into her own hands.”
He gives her all the focus he can, and she understands that it’s not in his nature to be single-minded. He has to go in ten different directions at once, and she completely gets it. She understands, and he tries, and they work. She understands him like no one ever has, mostly because after Rhodey left, no one ever tried. He knows he’s so lucky to have found someone to accept him, mad genius as he is.
“Or his employees just know what’s what,” Bucky returns, sliding into the half-circle booth, casually stretching one arm across the back. “I always thought Howard would have been too uptight for something like this.” He reaches to steal a sip of Natasha’s drink, but she slaps his hand away and mutters something dark at him. He retreats, pouting and rubbing at the red mark forming.
“They’re not going to take you from me,” Phil murmurs against his hair, “I won’t let them. You’re the most important thing in my life, Clint, you have to believe that.”
Steve’s breath catches in his throat because what Tony’s saying sounds dangerously like forgiveness.
Steve bursts through the door while managing to still cradle Tony against him, shield braced in front of them both. He lowers it slowly when he sees Obadiah sprawled on the ground, Pepper still calmly holding the pistol. Steve’s team stands in front of the body, similarly stunned and staring at the civilian with a firearm.
“Tony?” Steve steps slowly out of the elevator and into the brightly lit lab. It’s somewhat familiar, the gleaming chrome surfaces bringing up memories that he determinedly shoves back in their mental box, but there’s just enough wire and circuit boards cluttering the tables and even the floor to make it more
Tony grins and straightens his sleeves as the elevator comes to a gentle stop. “Aw, J. You sure know how to make a girl feel special. This is why you’re my favorite.”
Steve skids to a stop just inside the doors, four vaguely familiar people behind him, slightly blurry but he thinks he can make out Pepper’s favorite assistant, as well as another high up suit he sometimes sees in Legal.
There’s a cold, sinking pit in Clint’s stomach that’s just opened up, and he doesn’t know what to do with this information. “So what’s this, are you here to fire me? Or eliminate me? Is this some kind of gentlemanly warning that I don’t have the handbook for?” Christ, if he has to watch as Phil kills him, or worse
“Jesus Christ.” The look on Tony’s face can only be described as horror and it wounds something deep inside of Steve. He’s not surprised, he already knows he’s a freak of nature, but it’s still disappointing. “And now they’ve got both of you in contracts for life?”
Anthony. Remember: ‘The wild, cruel beast is not behind the bars of the cage. He is in front of it.’”
Of course, I think it’s strange!” His arms fly up in exasperation. “He looks like he hasn’t seen the sun in years, that’s fuckin’ weird! But you know what else is weird? Letting people stick you with needles full of some mystery cocktail and waking up two feet taller and a hundred pounds heavier. Or getting your arm ripped off in an ‘accident’ right outside Stark Industries headquarters, and then getting a mechanical one put right back on. Or being able to shoot things most people can’t even see. Or – I don’t even know, Natasha, half the things you do seem to be physically impossible for most people.”
“Well,” Steve starts kissing his mouth, then moves down his jaw and neck, interspersing his words with kisses. “Since I’m the first person ever, I guess I’ll just have to spend the rest of my life making up for the deficiency.” He sighs dramatically, “I suppose I have to tell you I love you every day for, oh, about thirty or forty years to make up for it.”
I really like Tony. He makes me happy, he makes me laugh, and when I’m around him I can forget about being on the night shifts. I’m being safe, I promise. So, when you find his file and read every word, don’t tell me. I want to learn that stuff when he wants to tell me, not before.”
Steve can hear shuffling from where he’s got his face pressed back into his knees. He looks up again to find Tony back where he was, a tarp now covering the chair entirely. “Better?”
Kudos would be lovely, and be sure to leave a comment if you have something to say! I love hearing from people and I promise I'll respond!
(Although it’s common knowledge that his former PA does most of the leading, and everyone is much happier for it.)
America loves him, and he feels like he’s flying. It’s like that first time flying in the suit, the world fading below him as he goes ever higher.
Pepper enters his life at the best possible time, which also happens to be the low point of his entire life.
“Shitshitshitshit-“ Tony paces the confined space of his prison quietly, vacillating between storming out to drag Yinsen back into this safe place with him and staying put to honor Yinsen’s wishes. He hasn’t made a decision when a loud bang from the other room forces his hand. Rushing back to the screens, Tony holds his breath as the light from the hall illuminates a hulking figure standing in the doorway, a medical type case in one hand and a large, round object in the other. There’s only one job he knows of that requires a black, almost shiny, easily cleaned suit, a helmet with glowing eyes, and a carrying case.
“No, of course not. The I only–“ Yinsen stops suddenly and waits, focusing intently on something. He strides over to the holoscreens and calls up security footage. Tony joins him, but he can’t see anything except a quick black streak in the corner of one of the cameras.
The past months of Tony’s life flash before him. Steve’s laugh, the little snort he makes when he knows he shouldn’t be laughing but just can’t help it, his smile, more addictive than any drug Tony’s ever tried. How warm he is, how just being near him made Tony forget that he was a dead man to the world because to Steve he was
“I – goddammit.” Steve huffs when he sees Tony trying not to laugh. “Fine, then. Guess I won’t see you.”
He lays there for a few moments, trying to process what Steve just said. He knew they were getting closer, more comfortable in the relationship and with each other, but he hadn’t realized they had hit the “I love you” point. Of course he loves Steve, how can you
Steve comes back to awareness with a splitting headache and a sunken feeling in the pit of his stomach indicating that something is very, very wrong. It takes a second for him to place where he is, the lab unfamiliar, none of the warmth and good feeling he associates with Tony’s. As his head clears, his memories start to come back too, flashes of movement, entering the lab and seeing the mark, taking aim. Hearing a sound from the back of the lab, reacting, then pain in the back of his head and darkness.
At the beginning it was hard to separate the man from the image, which led to the fighting like mad and spitting barbs meant to wound, Tony punishing Steve for the standards his father set for him and Steve still too raw from losing his whole world to even consider reaching out. The fighting got to be so constant that they were locked in the pantry by Natasha with instructions to JARVIS not to let them out until they talked through their shit. After The Pantry Incident, things got better. It wasn’t easy, but through training together, and awkward nightmare talks at four in the morning when they both “just happened to be up”, they grew closer than anyone ever thought they would.
“Well, that is good to know.” Tony heaves himself up with a fair amount of help from Steve, whose concerned hand he brushes off once he’s able to stand on his own. “I think that’ll have to wait ‘til after we get this shitshow straightened out, though.”
Steve holds the tablet gently and looks again over the kind, intelligent face, next to a man’s entire life, packed into a short, bulleted list of facts. He waves his team out of the room, Natasha reluctantly snug under Bucky’s metal arm and Clint already texting Phil on his communicator. He takes a few deep breaths and starts to put on his gear.
” Yinsen’s eyes are alight behind his wire-frame spectacles, he looks decades younger when he speaks, gesturing excitedly with his hands. “Very light, very durable, and an enormous capacity for redistributing and resonating with power. Now, this is not the kind of thing that people keep in stock, they are afraid that it is too difficult to control. And, since your current model regulator uses a liquid, you would need a different containment and consumption mechanism. But!” He turns and types at his tablet, and another schematic opens on screen, one of Tony’s from when he was playing with alternate metallic power source to kick his zydrate dependence. “If we fabricate something based on this design,
“You didn’t ask for my opinion, but I believe you look nice. I’m sure your friend will be very pleased.”
“My own knight in shining armor.” Steve grins and picks up his pad and pencil again. He starts sketching, reproducing the way Tony moves around the lab, turning the sleek lines and constant movement into flight and tech-influenced shining armor of his own. He feels Tony’s eyes on him again, but when he raises his own head to meet them, Tony is working intently at his own project again.
The man himself emerges from the innards of one of his robots and looks briefly confused but his face clears, and his bright smile pulls an answering one from Steve. “Steve! Hi, I forgot you were coming up.”
The elevator ride up to Pepper’s office is the longest of Tony’s life, but he hardly expects it to be otherwise under the circumstances. Yinsen is still barely conscious, a little blood trickling from the cut on his temple, and Tony knows his own face is drawn and defeated. Pepper is going to be horrified, and rightly so, but he's out of options.
“I’ve stayed late the past few weeks to monitor the development of the new satellite transmission software. We had a breakthrough, and I saw on the security cameras that there was a commotion in the laboratory space, so I came down to check on the situation myself. Is everything alright?” Obie steps forward, then a little to the right, like he’s trying to see what’s happening.
Tony groans and drops his head to the bench in front of him, bringing it back up to wipe at whatever sticky, oily thing was now on his forehead. “
In less time than expected, Phil and Clin burst into the bunkroom with a palpable air of menace, despite the fact that they’re both in pajamas. Clint clutching his bow, and Phil similarly armed with a tablet. They both relax a little when they see that Steve is unharmed, and Phil approaches slowly.
“Um. No? I mean, I was kind of a bratty kid, and I fucked things up with Pepper before we ever got to that point, so it just never… came up?”
It’s been two weeks since he met the elusive “Steve”, and his trips to the bar are now bordering on compulsive. Before everything went down with Stane and the company, this would have been the tamest thing he’d ever done. Now, he gets sweaty and panicked if he doesn’t have his back to the wall, and even then, he’s tense and ready for anything to happen.
“Don’t get me wrong, I am going to need a lot of therapy to get over the image of you in your leather get up in Yinsen’s lab.” Tony swallows and the light in his eyes dims a little. “But if you had known what he was to me, would you have taken the job?”
making out like teenagers despite being grown ass adults, but it is how they spend a fair amount of time.
“Okay first, ew.” Clint says, after a brief pause, “Second, does that mean you’re just gonna sit here with us and give up on fixing your relationship?”
Unless, of course, you have been lucky enough to receive an Integrative Resilient Organ Neosupport transplant, called I.R.O.N. for short. These synthetic organs, created in 2101 by Howard Stark of Stark Industries and improved by his son Anthony, can replace any organ you possess, and often work better than the originals. They’re expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for and I.R.O.N. organs are of the highest quality. Everyone has them nowadays, Dear Reader, to improve upon the poor genetics they received naturally.
“Hi.” Clint lets his momentum flip him off the bunk to land on his feet, and turns to survey his visitor, crossing his arms over his chest. “What’re you doin’ here?”
“Then shoot me! Just fucking shoot me and have it over with, why even bother with this stupid fucking extended supervillain monologue?”
Tony brings his hands up in surrender with slow, deliberate movements. “Obie, please. You know I’m not going anywhere, you don’t need a gun.”
“That’s the best part! The bar is in the basement of an old research building; it’s technically Stark property. We’ll be five minutes away, max.” He walks over and slings the metal arm around Steve’s neck, drags him down so he can give him a noogie with his other arm. “You’re gonna deprive the world of this beautiful face? We paid good money for all this.” He squishes Steve’s face in his hand and makes a face at him in the mirror. Steve bites down on a smile and shoves him away, jabbing a finger at the ticklish space under his ribs. He ducks as Bucky yelps, and laughs at the affronted look on his face.
“What do you want to know?” Steve motions to Darcy slightly awkwardly, like he’s never ordered a drink before. Tony rests his chin in his hand and his gaze sweeps over Steve entirely, his expression settling into something a little more serious before he says:
“You can. You just don’t.” Her tone says icy disinterest, but her raised eyebrow is what betrays her. He’s got her, he knows he does. “What is it?”
“You were upset last week, ‘cause it was Bucky’s birthday? You get all quiet and more tactile than usual when you’re sad and thinking about the skinny Steve years. But you said you missed him, and you wished he was remembered by more people. Said that he was a war hero too, and that he should be remembered as much as you are. So I looked into it, and it’s actually really easy to set up scholarships, you just need a fund and a name. Pepper set it up, took care of the paperwork.” Tony forces his hands to stop flying around, they always become more expressive when he got nervous. “And I can undo it if you want, but it’s kind of a late birthday present to Bucky. The James Buchanan Barnes Memorial Scholarship.”
She relaxes her posture a little as she sighs, faux-serious expression giving way to one of – pity? Oh, fuck no, absolutely not. “Oh, Tony. You know you can’t – “
“Mhm. Sounds exactly like what a model who is undercover as an administrative assistant would say.” Tony steps out without looking backwards at him to enter the small park. Housed on a less well-known roof, the park is often deserted, but he always has Jarvis check for him before sneaking away to enjoy some much-needed sunshine, while still staying on company property. It’s not much to look at, just a couple of benches and a nice square of grass, but it’s better than nothing.
And his ripper turned protector? He learns to embrace the more sedate aspects of his job, and finds enjoyment in the sweeter things in life, like the gorgeous inventor who now shares his bed. He’s still a leader in his own way, but he no longer shuts a part of himself away each night.
He absolutely does not scream, he lets out a suspiciously high-pitched sound of surprise, and that’s what he’ll take to his grave. He could have sworn Jarvis was putting her through on a holo-call, not bringing her directly to the shop and it was
“First, I’m not drinking these by myself. They’re for my friends.” He gestures towards their table, where his friends are all sitting – with their drinks. He looks back to the bar, suspiciously empty, then back at the table, where Clint is shaking his head at him from across the room, and Tasha is looking incredibly disappointed at his observational skills.
“Nosy AI, always listening in. I’m gonna nerf him one of these days.” Tony leans back in and looks Steve directly in the eye. “Steve. I am the personification of my father’s greed and ambition. At this point, we can safely say that I’m more material than man. You got a first-hand look at the mess I’ve got keeping my heart beating, and you saw how that cost Yinsen his life and almost cost me mine. So tell me – “ He spreads his arms wide and cocks an eyebrow. “Wouldn’t you call me an abomination?”
Just like that, all the confusion is gone. In its place, sitting brightly in his chest, is euphoria, a feeling he’s never felt anything like before. He is loved, someone loves him and it’s Steve, Captain
The cold realization hits Tony as the imposing figure of the Repo Man strides forward. With a lightning fast flick of the wrist, the figure’s arm launches what looks like a discus, no, a
“We don’t have time, Tony. Mr. Stane wants to start testing the automatic failure software by the end of next month, and we still don’t have a working model to show him. I need you to push a testing version through, if not for the universal software, then something for at least one of the bio organs.”
“Never knew you were one to fish for compliments.” But Steve’s teasing grin fades to something achingly real and impossibly soft. “You’re so
anymore. Is it awkward? Fuck yeah. The first three months are basically just them trying not to kill each other and learning to live together in the Tower, so of course it’s going to be awkward. But once they fit, it becomes a comfortable, pseudo-family unit. No one expected it, but they all (secretly) love it.
Steve shakes his head mutely. Phil frowns in response and clicks through some screens on the tablet. “I can see that your mark is still alive, did something go wrong?”
“You’ve got, what, a double vodka, two beers, and a rum and coke all for you? I mean, you’re a big guy, but that still seems like a lot to handle all by yourself.” He’s a little offended, but the man’s eyes are teasing, and Steve’s surprised gape turns into a half a smile.
Tony snorts. “Yeah, okay. Only you could paint me as such a giving soul. Everyone else would say it was selfishness.”
“Of course.” The entire back of Tony’s neck is pink now, and he goes back to fiddling with something on his lab bench. He looks up and whatever expression Steve has on his face makes him duck his head again and throw an old towel at Steve’s face. “Stop looking at me like that. I would have found you and fixed you up, and you wouldn’t have had to do anything you didn’t want to.”
Tony smiles up at him, and Steve beams back because he always does when Tony smiles at him. Tony reaches up and tugs at his shirt, so Steve climbs over the back of the couch and settles on top of him, bracing himself on his arms.
“You can. You don’t, though.” Clint strides forward and invades Phil’s space. There’s no one in the office this late, besides Mollie reading her romance novels behind the acquisitions counter, so he reaches up and pulls Phil in by his tie, noses along his jaw to press a kiss below his ear. “So, what’s the occasion?”
“Please. I don’t need to eavesdrop.” He toasts Steve with his own glass of what looks like gin and tonic. “Recovering alcoholic. I can identify a drink at twenty paces.” Seltzer dressed up as gin and tonic, then.
“Hell, Buck. Who do you think I am?” Steve’s heart drops into his stomach. “I wouldn’t say anything, you know that. You
“Obie…left with the…reactor.” Speaking is really fucking hard when your blood oxygen is at less than optimal levels. “Have to make sure Pepper’s okay.”
“Jesus!” Tony spins around and presses a hand over his – well, not heart exactly. The metal over his heart. “You could kill a guy, sneaking up on people like that.”
Clint forces a sardonic smile. “Nothing more than usual, just a complication. Tasha knows the mark.”
He can hear her sigh, exasperated and sad and goddammit, he can’t do anything right. “That’ll be all, Mr. Stark.” There’s a quiet whisper as the doors glide open and closed behind her.
“Yeah, sure. Just let me–“ He inputs some commands on the screen he’d been working on before Pepper called, sets up the dummy software to run while he’s gone.
“I don’t think medical attention will be necessary.” Obiadiah’s eyes are cold, the arm that holds the gun currently pointed at Yinsen absolutely steady. He looks like something out of Tony’s nightmares.
“Or you implode in on yourself like a very, very depressing sinkhole.” Clint swings himself up onto the top bunk. “And how quickly it gets to meltdown is directly proportional to how much of a shitty situation it is. And this one is mega, ultra fucked up.”
“Secondly, I am pleased to announce that Anthony Stark will be resuming his post as Chief Scientific Officer and head of the Research and Development Division. And no,” She raises her voice a little to cut off the few interjected questions, “We will not be taking questions about where he has been since his disappearance from society. Mr. Stark asks that you respect his privacy.”
“You said ‘first’, so what’s the second thing I got wrong? Come on, I have to know. I’m kind of a genius, this whole being wrong thing is very weird for me.”
the immediate danger has passed. Also, who fucking designed these suits? They look stupid, and the helmet mask thing is really hard to get off. They should have –
“Nothing.” Steve shrugs, and his smile turns into more of a smirk. “Just nice you have someone to talk to when you’re shut up here all alone.”
and surges back up to kiss Tony, all teeth and heat. They stay on the couch, kissing and enjoying the closeness until Clint bursts in with-
“Yeah, you wish.” Steve laughs at the wink Bucky throws him and they walk out the door like that, shoving at each other and stepping out into the New York night.
“You didn’t pay with money and you know it. You sold your body, though I don’t know why anyone wanted that mangy old thing.” It almost doesn’t hurt to joke about, after more than a decade. The affection in Bucky’s eyes and his easy grin go a long way to easing the dull pang in his chest.
of them, all four plus an extra just because he’s a good guy. He sets Jarvis to scan the documents to find the loophole that has to be there and gives himself a moment to revel in the feeling of doing something
“Says the guy who was just nearly murdered,” Tony grumbles, pressing gauze against the cut to stop the bleeding, “But fine. I’ll look both ways before crossing the street and everything.”
“Routine hardware updates, slipping it into the fine print. They’re going to label it as a way to protect the investment, making sure that people who really deserve the service can access it.” Phil rolls his eyes. “As if some people are more deserving of healthcare.”
The figure crashes to the ground, unmoving, but Tony doesn’t stop to check, vaulting over the body to check on Yinsen. He’s still out cold, but his pulse is strong. Tony has to get him out of here,
Tony dumps the boxes somewhere and goes over to the darkened terminal, which he awakens with a few keystrokes. It’s actually almost harder to get it running again than it is to let himself into the camera system, and he’s treated to a multi-camera view of the lab he was just forced out of, where Yinsen is packing away the blueprints that remain spread out on tables while the door to the outer hallway shakes in his hinges.
He goes back to the smaller lab to grab his new power source and reactor, taking them out of their boxes and stashing them on his person. He kneels next to the Repo Man and starts pulling the mask off. If he can get their face clear for Jarvis’ facial recognition, he can find and punish this son of a bitch for hurting Yinsen,
Tony pushes himself back and stands on autopilot, lurches towards where Yinsen is still hunched over the table. Tony rouses him enough to get his arm up and around his own shoulders and starts towards the door. He sees the tablet he had been working on when he came in and takes it with him as he leads Yinsen out of the lab. He has to get to Pepper, she has to know something about this, about why Yinsen was targeted, and how to fix it, there has to be a way to fix it. Pepper will have the answers, and then Tony can start fixing his monumentally fucked up personal life.
“Well, I’m not alone so much anymore.” Tony turns away from that face, so he doesn’t have to look at that stupid, beautiful smirk again. “Now that I have you bothering me at all hours, whether I like it or not.” It’s suspiciously silent behind him, and Steve’s smile is even wider when he finally turns to look. “What now?”
“I don’t think even Cosmo has the answer on this one. Unfortunately, I know what I have to do.” Jarvis alerts them that he’s finished rendering, and Tony gets up to move to the chair with a sigh. “I have to have a goddamn adult conversation about my feelings.”
Steve sighs. “I’m sorry about that. It looks like – it reminded me –“ he shakes his head again, like a dog trying to get water of its ears – “I got to know a chair like that real well when they did this.” He waves an absent hand over his self and catches Tony’s confused look. “And again, when Bucky lost his arm.”
“Wait, but if they can terminate people via the network, does that mean they’re not going to need a Repossession team anymore?” Clint looks at Phil and sees his own worry mirrored there. He steps back, puts some distance between them. “Phil?”
Steve’s mouth hangs open while he tries to think of a rebuttal. The most frustrating thing is that his mind comes up completely blank. “That’s – it’s not – I’m not looking for a relationship.”
Bucky grins wickedly, “C’mon, Tash. We all know that’s not a long drive.” He ducks out of the way of her first jab, but winces when her shoe connects with his shin. Her small, pleased smile hints that she’s not as offended as she’d like to be. “Alright, enough chit-chat and maiming. I got Steve out of the Tower, so
Jarvis brings the lights up so Tony can settle Yinsen in Pepper’s chair and grab the first aid kit from her desk.
“Sir, I am happy to report that all organ systems are receiving sufficient power. According to your vital signs, you should fully recover within minutes.” There’s a slight pause, one that sometimes occurs when Jarvis is compiling information. “It appears that the new reactor is only operating at eighty percent power, due to misaligned connections. Once the power transfer is maximized, I believe you will have excess energy available for ancillary uses.”
about it, something he feels deep in his bones, and it’s not easy or without its difficulties, but he knows he’s not going to give up on Tony, even if he was grown in a lab at Stark Industries. There’s a name for this thing he’s feeling, but he is absolutely not going there, no matter how many sideways looks Bucky throws at him when he comes back from seeing Tony, flushed and happy.
“Not enough time.” Yinsen’s face has gone deathly pale. “I thought I would have more but…no matter.” He takes both boxes and shoves them into Tony’s arms before pushing Tony through the door to the adjoining lab.  “Stay here. No matter what you hear, you cannot leave this room. And please, stay quiet.”
The light dims a little from Yinsen’s expression, but he hides it with a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Not magic, simply good connections. But yes, I found a few scraps that I melted down, and the end product might be of use to you.” He takes a small container off the nearby bench and hands it to Tony. When he opens it, the metal inside shimmers with a hypnotic light, powerful in an understated way.
The assassins stay on at the company, for the most part. They disappear for months at a time, but they always return to their found family in the end.
“Sure, J, let me know if you find anything interesting.” It was nice to know that Jarvis hadn’t given up on him, even when everyone else had. Sad, but still sweet. Tony smooths the flesh colored bandage over the arc reactor, dimming the tell-tale blue light before pulling on his shirt. “Daddy’s going out, don’t wait up. Activate the dummy tracker but continue vitals and toxicity monitoring.”
“Ugh, Steve, really? If you’re my bodyguard you’re supposed to be guarding my body.” He looks over at Steve’s unimpressed expression and sighs at him. “Just get your ass over here, Rogers. We need to talk.”
Tony leans in, interest piqued. “Nano-carbon fiber? Or maybe ceramic and para-aramid, I know we’ve been using that in prototypes for more durable upgrades.”
They eat in silence for a bit, enjoying the sunshine and the company. Steve sits back on his hands and looks over the New York City skyline, sighing, and Tony continues to watch him, cleaning up the remains of their lunch. It’s quiet for a while, and Tony is memorizing the angle of Steve’s jawline when the man himself remarks, “It’s a great view.”
“What kind of–“ Tony breaks off to gasp as Steve nips at his collarbone where his shirt has become mysteriously unbuttoned. “What kind of bad thoughts?”
If nothing else, Natasha is truly accomplished at hiding bodies, and there’s no way anyone will be stumbling over Stane any time soon.
Natasha always seems to find him when he’s trying to be small and quiet. The times when he can’t sleep for seeing Yinsen, the countless people hurt by his company’s weapons, even Pepper, all hurt and bleeding behind his eyelids. She sits with him quietly and sometimes breaks out the good vodka. Sometimes, though, it’s just cocoa.
Phil shakes his head. “They just sent over the specifics this evening. The bio organs are going to have an autodestruct system that allows operators to stop all function immediately from a remote location. They’ll be using satellites to make sure all customers stay in approved areas while they’re still in debt.”
(Don’t get him wrong, sometimes he loves it. He loves that Steve cares about him enough to want everyone to know he belongs to Steve. But when he needs to charm fellow business people to ensure that his patents go through, or to make sure a deal goes the way he wants it to, he doesn’t need his hot boyfriend standing and glaring at everyone with a hand around his waist.)
Pepper is rolling her eyes when he removes the towel from his head, “We had a meeting scheduled, Tony, I’m not here unexpectedly.”
The predator packs his harvest away in the same small cooler, cleaning the blade and storing it before swinging the case and his other tool over his shoulder. He strides down the alley with shoulders slightly hunched, making no noise as he moves through the maze of New York streets. He moves quickly and without fear, he is the most dangerous thing on the streets tonight.
“I wasn’t sure, and I had work – I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.” Steve shrinks in on himself, and it’s bizarre how small he can make himself seem, for such a large man.
“And that’s it. There’s no coming back from that.” Steve tilts his head back in an effort to keep the tears from falling. “He hates me.”
For a while Steve just watches Tony work, marveling at how focused he is, how his hands move quickly, testing and prodding attachments and bundles of wires. His own fingers itch for the pad and pencil he brought with him, or a tablet if he absolutely must.
Okay maybe not exactly that. But there has to be a reason Tony is so twitchy and pale, and even in the worst-case scenarios he’s dreamed up nothing has measured up to “I’m a glorified intern by day, mass murderer by night, and on top of that I have serious self-worth problems that carried over into my brand-new body that my best friend bought and paid for with his soul.”
Tony closes his eyes and smiles, perfectly content to be slightly squished into the couch, because he is
Obadiah is actually the one who hires her, in a startling twist. She’s the last in a very long line of personal assistants. The last one left after only three weeks in his fabulous company. (In all honesty, he probably could have refrained from offering her a threesome with him and the lovely girl he had brought home from a gala.) From the first, Pepper is ruthless efficiency and fiery determination wrapped in a perfectly poised and professional package. She takes absolutely none of his shit, and is even good at deflecting the people he really can’t stand. He might be a little bit in love.
Phil’s sigh is half pleasure and half resignation, and he pushes Clint further into the bunk room, so the door slides shut silently behind them.
“You’ve been informed? What, did someone hand you a manual when we became friends,” because they’re definitely friends now, even if Steve wants to maybe try for something more, “‘The Care and Keeping of Steven Grant Rogers’?”
“Oh right.” Tony punches the elevator button, and they start moving soundlessly. “I forgot. Secretaries who are also models don’t get much time for lunch.”
“No,” Obadiah says, “Just those who have outlived their value.” He clicks through the plasma screens again and she sees faces she knows so well flick by; it’s Clint and Bucky on call tonight, her little hawk and the maddening soldier. She is acutely aware that this man could disappear any of them and no one would know, only four other people would care. Her knuckles go white briefly on the edge of her tablet before relaxing. “That will be all, Ms. Rushman.”
Bucky steps out from an alcove with Natasha right behind him, with the most serious expression Steve’s ever seen on his face. “Hey, Stevie. Can we talk to you for a sec?”
Tony winces and makes himself look away from the door, pulling a stack of napkins closer to him and making grabby hands at Darcy until she rolls his eyes and gives over a pen. He starts doodling at first to keep his eyes off the door, but as usually happens he falls into a rhythm. It’s a bit harder without Jarvis to help, but he ends up making good progress on some pseudocode for the region-restricting and automatic failure software Obadiah had wanted thoughts on.
Steve shifts, trying to get comfortable enough to ignore the itch between his shoulder blades. He hates going out unarmed. Although, with the four of them together, they’re never really unarmed. “How did you hear about this place? They don’t seem friendly to strangers, the doorman looked like he wanted to eat us.”
Tony’s smile turns into more of a grimace, and he looks down at his hands, twisting the wrench in his grip. “Yeah, they’ve got me set up special. I think they’re trying to reduce property damage, the cowards.” Something inside of the robot sparks and pops, making Steve jump while Tony just frowns at it before diving back in.
Everything goes still and quiet in the wake of the gunshot, the flash of red and the way Yinsen slumps completely in the chair the only things that Tony is capable of focusing on. Time speeds back up to a normal rate as Tony’s cry of anguish tears through his chest and out his mouth in a strangled yell. He crumples over the desk, barely staying upright, and his breathing goes shallow. He can hear, as if from a long distance, footsteps coming closer and a hand fastens in his collar. He is pulled upright and thrown backwards onto the desk. Tony looks up into Obie’s cold face, twisted and unrecognizable, and spits in it.
Bucky and Clint share a quick look, taking Steve by the arms and sitting him down on a bunk. Steve has a passing thought to struggle against their hold, but it doesn’t seem worth it.
“Alright, okay. I’ll have something testable soon, just for you.” Pepper rolls her eyes over the videophone connection, and Tony can hear the elevator open behind him. He freezes, a rookie mistake, and he can tell she notices.
“I think they were probably intimidated. It can’t be good for the ego, having to work in the same room as this brain.” Holy shit, have Steve’s eyes always been this blue? “They gave you your own space so you would stop making everyone else look bad. You did them all a service.”
No, no, there’s no way. Yinsen wouldn’t be that stupid, there’s nothing he has that isn’t real, nothing that would have drawn the attention of the Repo Men, unless –
“You think I’m the figurehead, boy? You’re the one who disappeared and no one in the entire city noticed. Did you know that? There wasn’t a single missing person report filed, no one contacted the police, concerned that you weren’t there, because no one cared. The only part of you that’s ever been worth anything is this.” Obadiah taps a single finger against the reactor and Tony flinches. “Though, it is still imperfect. I know you still haven’t found a solution to the zydrate issue, but no matter. It’ll just up demand, and we’ve cornered that market. So really, there isn’t a single thing that I still need you for. Besides your last gift, the rest of you is just…waste.” And Obadiah pushes down and twists, then pulling the reactor core, still glowing a brilliant blue and flushed with zydrate, out of Tony’s chest.
improved on, to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Howard just wanted to make sure that after all the upgrades, my organs had enough power to keep them going, he didn’t seem too concerned with the poison his creation would be spewing into my body.” There might be a slight tinge of bitterness in his voice, which is probably the reason behind Yinsen’s quick sympathetic look.
Steve looks up shyly and smiles. Look at that goddamn smile. That little grin is more real than any Tony’s seen in years, and that’s why he keeps coming back.
“Fine, mostly quiet. We got a notice about a half hour ago, pretty quick job.” He shrugs a little. “You? Still filling in for Stane’s assistant?”
“Nothing. He took a bit getting used to, your imaginary friend,” Steve makes a vague motion at the ceiling, “But now it’s just. Very you.”
So Tony stands at the curb alone, and watches the first person who cared about him leave. (He’ll see him again, he knows. There won’t ever be another moment like that one, though, where he could have said it, and not regretted it after. He knows that too.)
“Now, I’ve just shot a man. I’m going to go have a drink,” She looks Tony over and then gives Steve a critical side-eye, “And take Tony off your hands. I assume someone in this room knows how to dispose of a body?”
“We will.” Tony looks over to Steve to find him leaning against the wall, a fond smile on his face. “What?”
“I know, Tony. I wish I knew how to help, but I don’t. I don’t think anyone has ever had this problem before, but we could always ask Cosmo.”
“Yes, sir.” Tony leaves his bedroom and crosses to an innocuous wall-panel which slides back after a fingerprint and cornea scan to reveal a hidden elevator. He steps into the elevator and pushes the basement button, and as the doors slide closed, he hears another, more tentative, “Sir?”
