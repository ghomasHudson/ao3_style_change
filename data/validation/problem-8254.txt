“Come on slowpoke!” the blonde called out as he raced into the lobby, Bucky a few steps behind since he thanked the driver and shut the door. Any doubts or fears were squashed as he watched his love dance around in front of the check in counter.
"Mhmm?" he mumbled.
They stared at each other for a few seconds before they heard Joe call them downstairs.
“No I didn’t,” she confessed as Steve made his way back to join them. He sat on the coffee table near Joey and tried to hand her the large ice pack. However, the drugs were strong in this one – as she just blinked and continued staring at the ceiling.
That’s when it clicked for Emerson.
“HEY!” he heard a shout the could’ve been Joe or Steve, but it caused his father to stop in his tracks - which was currently with Tony’s collar in his tight fists. “If you wanna keep those hands, I suggest you remove them from that boy.” Okay, that was definitely Joe.
Now it was Tony’s turn for things to click. “Of course” he rasped out, a huge smile on his face before flipping the covers back to allow her to slide in next to him. “Lights, J” Tony said as they settled next to each other. She was still not used to the whole “good touch vs. bad touch” thing, having flinched in the beginning when they even got close. You wouldn’t guess that now, as she buried her face in his shoulder and wrapped her arm around his waist.
"I'm not buying your brother's love, rich boy," he said with a challenging brow and a smirk. Peter saw through the act immediately, smiling back at his love before replying.
“Wilson, you go take a fucking walk and cool off,” Sam opened his mouth to protest but Fury was quick to reiterate. “Say one fucking word and I’ll suspend you without pay for the day.”
Sam had approached them at that moment, gently taking Em’s arm to get her attention.
“I don’t mind being a princess. I’m too old to trick or treat with friends, too young to party, so at least now I get candy if I go with the monsters,” Miles said with a smile.
"I'm not tired," Miles said.
"But...you're not a man?" Miles asked innocently, getting more laughter from not only the parents, but the sister as well.
“I promise, Daci,” he said before planting a kiss on her forehead. She felt safe and tired again, letting out another yawn that had her Tati pull back with a smile. “Need a nap, cub?” She couldn’t help but frown, feeling tired but wanting to spend time with her father. “I could use a nap,” he added, bringing a smile to her face.
“Yeah, it’s probably nothing…” she started to say, noticing Cara was smiling at her from across the cafeteria. She smiled back and stopped when Xavier snapped his fingers in her face to get her attention.
Steve squealed out, the only description for the noises coming out of Steve’s mouth. He certainly filled the room with a happy Alpha smell. “And you’re having my pup!” Steve cried before leaning down to kiss the Omega’s stomach then moving up to his lips.
“And now?” Tony prodded carefully, still holding the Alpha’s hands in his. “Do you...do you want this?” The question had the blonde pulling his hand away before resting on the Omega’s cheek.
“I’m sorry Xavier, you were right but I just didn’t want to see it…” Joey began.
She felt her Pop go rigid next to her. Normally, he was the one who handled ignorant people when they were in public. Or private. But this time Emerson didn’t let him, choosing instead to do so herself.
“Come in,” he said as he sat up, knowing the odds of whoever it was on the other side that they would have just come in anyway. His eyes widened as Cheryl walked in, holding a mug of her amazing hot chocolate.
“Hey kiddo, you need a ride?” she offered generously. This woman was seriously a Saint.
"That's what video chat is for sugar bean," he retorted as he kissed her on the head and gently pushed her off his lap. She mock glared at him as she went to follow orders. She came back and showed him the meds and her glass of water she got from her bathroom before swallowing them. She downed about half the water before showing her open mouth to her father, hoping to be as obnoxious as possible.
“There are different ways to drug someone, Bucky. And judging from the tangy smell, dilated eyes and attitude towards her, I’d say it was through perfume,” Banner explained. “I haven’t seen it in at least ten years, but there’s a plant native to the Amazon rainforest, and when you burn it and mix it with other things, add bit of magic…”
In fact, Lucky even helped Clint finally open up to Bucky.
[See? I knew I married you for a reason <3]
"We should head out as well, thanks for the congratulatory drinks everyone," her Tati said as he gently pushed her off his lap in order to stand up.
“Alright Morgan my love are you ready to get out of the bath? Papa will read you a story,” Steve finished in his own sing-song voice, which got the baby to stand up immediately, bubbles sliding down her naked body as Daci couldn’t help but laugh again.
Turns out, there were a lot of agents between them and the middle. And even when they eventually got there, she was still apparently behind a heavy door as he watched the Hulk attempt to break it down. Bullets continued whizzing by but his only focus was on getting his girl back.
“I can’t see the monkeys,” she mostly said to herself with a frown on her face. Then she felt Clint squeeze her hand, causing her to whip up to look at the man with a smile on his face.
“No, it’s just…” his cheeks blushed as he continued, “…been a while.”
“Are you sure?” Clint asked immediately, shifting the toddler in his arms to hang him upside down above his head, hands gently holding his hips. “You sure do
“I wanted some gum while I got gas, and found this beauty,” his love said simply, shrugging his shoulders as well.
“– Tony I swear!” Steve had taken a pillow and smacked it at his husband’s head, who simply laughed at him before giving him a quick peck on the cheek and settled into the couch to watch the movie.
“No,” he answered shortly, the driving force of
“Tony, Steve found him,” Howard called as footsteps quickly approached them.
“I doubt the cops will do anything, they haven’t in the past.”
“Rumlow, go to my office to be written up and transferred,” Fury growled.
glad I’ve never met him. And speaking of shitty grandparents…did Carolyn tell you why she came down here?” He blinked a few times at that, almost feeling whiplash from the change in subject. But still thankful for it.
“And know I have a grandbaby out there? Living in a world where their family abandoned them?”
"Mr. Ironmansir can I see your robots? Please? Pretty pretty pleaseeeeee?" he asked as Steve felt his heart warmth from the interaction. Tony had gently gripped the boy's hand before leading them to the living room - the super soldier following close behind.
“-you said you had second thoughts about being married, having kids, being an Avenger - all of that!” Steve just looked at him with a quirked brow.
“Noooooo,” the boy cried, clutching tighter to his father. Steve noticed Tony smile and shake his head fondly.
“I will accept that offer only because I will otherwise snap your son in half,” Sam said pointedly at Steve. He shook his head at his old friend before leaning down to his kids. He kissed Emerson’s temple before turning to do the same to Peter – but was stopped when Peter ducked his head out of the way. Steve glared a little at his son before grabbing his shoulders and forcing him to be still long enough to plant a fat kiss on his cheek; ignoring the groans coming from his teen…and the overdramatic face wiping that followed.
It went about as well as expected. Peter and Wade had dropped the twins off with his dads before taking Leo to the DHS office. After ten minutes of waiting in the lobby and speculating, Wade got up to use the restroom.
If anyone asked, she would blame it on epilepsy.
"It's just us Buck, you can tell me."
It was a small vehicle with dark tinted windows, driving down one of the hundreds of tunnels cascading throughout the Earth. They followed closely behind as it reached the surface, coming to a stop and turning to face the men - who slowly landed upright to walk over to the vehicle.
“She’ll be okay, Peter,” he heard Steve say. “This happens to her when she doesn’t take her medicine.”
"Oh that's right, Miles, I forgot to tell you. My Dad is Iron Man-"
“Maybe we could, watch some movies today? Or something? Figured we could all use the distraction.”
Kept smiling quietly until Tony finished and dried off his hands, the blonde moving to kiss the back of his neck.
Steve actually took the time to look through the papers, getting another laugh from Tony as he already knew they'd be going to the animal shelter. Em apparently did too as she smiled brightly at the shorter man in excitement.
Panic shot its way up Steve’s spine.
“He’s lying, Xavier tattled because he wants to make sure you actually go through with it,” Pop answered quickly, but not before shoving his husband on the couch.
“Oh Steven, you should know by now I don’t share,” Tony purred out before leaning down, kissing the blonde sweetly on the lips.
“It’s alcohol cub, like being drugged but with liquid. And no, you can not,” her father said with a smile before wrapping his arms around her. She snuggled closer into his embrace and smiled when Thor tried to get Steve to drink more.
"What if you get called on mission?" she countered, laughing as she heard him laugh as well.
“Excellent!” Helen said before Joey could even formulate words. “Well, my break is over so I should be getting back. Here! Take my business card, I just got these yesterday,” she said as she handed Jo a little card. She was still in too much shock, thankful that Xavier took it for her and also introduced himself.
“Doll…”
“It’s okay Pete,” Tony said without confidence as he rocked his boy in his arms.
“Hello handsome,” the brunette said with a smile.
“I’d like to see you again,” Steve said with as much confidence as he could muster, looking back into those chocolate brown eyes. Tony simply smiled back at him as the waitress brought the bill.
When he opened the door, Tony was waiting in bed for him. He was looking over his tablet and smiled at the man when he entered the room.
“So everyone can tell I’m gay?” he asked, wondering how much the other medics knew.
BUCKY
"Now where are the people supposed to be watching you?" he asked to himself as he made his way to the screening room, a passed out Miles in his arms.
“Second of all, your father was a great man, and snotty little shits reducing him to a white trash carnie when he owned and operated his own mechanic shop for ten years is…
“Petey, you remember me saying you’d meet my special friend today?” he asked as he rubbed the boy’s back.
The blonde handed his phone back, wrapping one arm around his girl and another around his husband. Tony leaned forward with a smile, kissing his love for the upteenth time, loving this man so much it hurt.
[Hey love, so…Xavier is joining us for dinner to make up with Jo. And after you and I should talk…cause Voldemort’s publicist reached out to me today]
"Yeah but he's looking more and more like his Umma," Tony said as he handed the toddler over to attack his favorite uncle before turning his attention to the baby in the blonde's arms.
“Yes!” Tony said as he continued laughing, “that’s why it’s even funnier!” Steve couldn’t help the chuckle that came out at that, offering Jo a half shrug in response when she turned her look of betrayal at the blonde.
“Jarvis! Champagne please and sparkling grape juice for my first grandpup,” Howard called out, clearly already a little tipsy from the scotch he had with their meal.
“I guess Daddy Warbucks didn’t buy you any manners, huh?” the goons behind her laughed. “Well don’t worry, you won’t see that faggot ever again,” he snarled at her. “You took everything from me when you ratted me out. My business, my money, all GONE! FOUR YEARS I spent in jail thinking of this moment. Lucky for you I got connections, got out early for good behavior.” Again, the hyenas laughed.
"Of course we do, baby," he said firmly as Emerson moved to also hug her little brother, noticing her older brother and Pop join in on the group hug.
“Thank you,” she said quietly, unable to meet his eye and turned and smiled at Morgan. “Maybe...maybe one day I can take one of your baths.”
The kids still insisted on giving them their present, which is currently hanging up in their bedroom. Wade had apparently helped weld metal picture frames together, making a giant circle out of the various shaped frames. Half of the frames were painted to look like his shield, the other half to look like Tony’s arc reactor. The pictures were of the four, Peter when he was younger, the couple on their wedding day, along with some professionals that Peter and Emerson had gotten done together. There was even a single faded baby picture of Emerson, she had explained to the teary eyed parents she contacted a few of her old case workers to find it, but it was the original. They hugged their kids for about an hour after that.
“My father’s ill, Tony. I’m here to see him and take over Stone Inc. And I thought...since we’re in the same city...I’d meet my son. What’s his name?” Tony stared at him hard, disbelief in the sheer
Joey asked as she began tickling the little boy.
“Hey now, what’s all this?” Tony rasped out. Everyone else’s face shot up at that, turning to welcome the man back to the land of the living.
Steve could see Sam literally swallow his frustration before turning to the exit to also follow orders.
“Well…
Five years to the day since Bucky had died.
“James, seriously I don’t have enough to bail you out of jail,” Clint said exasperatedly, grabbing his boyfriend’s shoulder and attempted to pull him back.
“I thought you were a billionaire?” the bastard asked before kissing his way up his thigh to his waist. He pulled back suddenly, looking Tony in the eye as the man sat there dumbfounded from the sudden movement.
“Of course, Em,” he reassured her, locking eyes with Wade. Wade nodded in agreement and ushered them out of the line, accepting the condolences from the crowd for them. Peter felt her hands release him, pausing a moment to allow her to walk alongside him. Wade joined Emerson on her other side, taking a moment to throw another smile at Peter. God, he was incredibly grateful for Wade Wilson.
But because
"Nope," he and his husband said at the same time.
“It’s nothing,” Tony said for the tenth time to his oldest friend, the man looking back at him in disbelief as the genius rubbed the middle of his chest. “I’m just stressed about Ty, that’s all,” he said mostly to convince himself.
“Please, I know you’re just my friend cause you want to work for Stark Industries one day.”
“Uh huh, and why did it take you seventeen years to find me?”
“Well, your mom had a brother but he died before you were born. I don’t really know if she had many cousins or aunts or uncles…remember me telling you we didn’t get to know each other that long?” he asked as they both climbed out of the car. He reached his arm out to pull her close, smiling as the two walked into their house.
“Okay, let me see if I can do this,” the woman said as the teen looked back at her with furrowed brows.
Joey stared at her a moment longer before taking the card and running to catch her train.
“Why would you run?” he cackled while grabbing a pillow to muffle his cries. Steve looked back at Jo, glad to see a smile on her face as she grabbed another pillow to smack him in protest.
“I’m so sorry Izzy, which princess do you wanna be?” Steve reiterated with a fond smile. He continued standing away, still sweaty and needing a shower.
“You’re a super soldier,” Clint argued back.
“He’s three,” Tony hissed as he plopped himself back on the couch next to Steve, “let’s hope his attention span is short enough to forget it.” Steve laughed loudly at the man, shaking his head fondly at the attempt.
“Hey Tony,” Ashley greeted with the fakest smile.
“Tony, baby, your godmother wants a word,” Sarah said with a smile, handing him the phone as the family went inside to give him some privacy. Steve stayed behind a moment longer, placing a gentle kiss on his cheek before following the others inside. Tony watched them with a smile of his own before bringing the phone to his ear.
He remained silent as Tony pulled his car into park, reaching to undue his seatbelt. He was stopped by a frozen Tony, not making any move to even move his hands from the wheel.
“I saw Cara, and frankly got tired of seeing your weak game,” she teased at him. She smiled as Cara laughed at her burn, still smiling with the glare Xavier threw at her.
“Rematch you fucking fairy!”
defend you?”
“His drunk ass threw up on me,” Fury said straight-faced, and it took everything in Steve’s power to not smile at that.
“We’ll be back guys,” Wade called to the three as he released the man’s hand in favor of copping a feel once they weren’t in eye sight.
Plus, Miles had been acting a little weird. Seemed like he could use the privacy anyway.
“Daddy!” Isaac cried as he crawled off Peter’s lap and toddled over with his sister to their other father.
“Before we get started, can you do Captain America saying ‘
“Love you,” Peter said, thankful for this man.
Steve rolled his eyes and couldn’t really be mad about living with children, his husband included. He shook his head as he started making the batter.
“Happy birthday Bambi,” Tony added using his free arm to fully hug the birthday boy.
“Why?” he demanded, tone sharp.
He woke from the sound of his son slamming their door open, blinking at the boy screaming good morning to them.
“-I don’t need to take any meds!” Clint snapped. “And I don’t need a fucking shrink! If I’m just
She had also forgotten how loud he is.
“So um…I’m going to go stay with Pepper for a day or two.” He could feel Steve’s watery blue eyes look up and bore into him, but he kept his eyes down before continuing. “I’m behind at Stark Industries and I think it’s for the best right now.”
He stood next to his fidgeting husband outside the elevator doors, waiting for Emerson to bring them home. The numbers above the doors suddenly started going up, the two men standing up straighter in anticipation. They heard the familiar ding before the doors to their floor opened, revealing their daughter and a tiny dark skinned boy holding her hand. He had a small afro and was wearing an adorable pair of overalls, holding a Spiderman plushie in the other hand.
“Well, the other option is you can bend over your bed and I use my belt?” he asked quietly and almost regretfully. Jo felt her eyes burst open and a cold shiver shoot up her spine in fear at the thought.
“Yeah Stevie, he’s the champion,” the older Alpha said. “You on the other hand need to work for a living, I’m not paying you to sit around and do nothing. Get back to work!”
“You’re ridiculous,” Peter said fondly, checking the rear-view mirror to still see his oldest asleep in the back.
feeling bad.”
She rolled her eyes fondly but didn’t push any further, stretching her body out in order to copy his movements.
Steve, up until this point, was able to keep himself quiet. But this
“Thank you for being so patient. I know I’m fucked up-”
“In his lab, being a cranky sourpuss,” Steve answered, letting out an ‘ooph’ when Harley came out of nowhere and jumped onto his lap - not at all gently. “Harley, baby, we’ve talked about this,” he attempted to say sternly. Attempted, since his little blonde was giggling up at him.
“Yeah, well. It’s not the cure for cancer but I think it’s pretty cool. Let’s go downstairs,” Tony said as he led the blonde down to some glass doors.
“Yes, it unfortunately did,” added Peter.
"I was thinking of some hair changes myself," she said behind him as he turned around.
“M-mm,” Clint mumbled, hunching his body up as he refused to answer the question, but still staying in his love’s embrace.
“You know Wade, your college girlfriend would probably be upset hearing that you’re crushing on my new sister.”
Which meant she wouldn’t be able to sit for a
“No, of course not,” he said quickly, before catching on to what Steve was saying. He rolled his eyes fondly at his brother before standing up to pull him into a bone crushing hug.
He literally shakes his head to concentrate, and remind himself to behave (even though, for the record, Tony had been the one to approve of that particular hall pass…so long as it was filmed. By Tony. Before he joined them. The bastard said this over lunch at their favorite restaurant, which earned a quick kick under the table from the blonde. He had to go to work immediately after – )
But suddenly, the word ‘selfish’ crossed her mind in big block letters and she suddenly found herself stopping in her tracks.
“Steve you are such a horrible liar, now gimme,” Tony said with grabby hands, only smiling when the blonde playfully rolled his eyes before obliging.
Tony suggested to look at places she and Bucky would have gone to together, which was two other places Steve hadn’t thought of. Afterward, with no sign of her, Steve finally realized he knew where she’d be.
“Daci?” he asked before rubbing his eyes, shifting to sit up more. “What happened?”
“I…did end up calling him. We went out Saturday.”
on Daddy’s grave,” she paused as her body hiccuped from more tears, “I will never do that again.”
"Where are...your brothers?" Steve asked the two completely ignoring Tony's rule.
Peter finally did collapse to his knees, body still in shock and unable to stop smiling.
“This way gentleman, our friend Jim suffered some burns and cuts from broken glass thanks to Mr. Can’t-hold-his-liquor!” she finished with a yell in the direction behind them as they stopped in front of the man sitting on the ground. Sam squatted down next to the patient as a loud slurred voice responded to the woman.
She was suddenly thankful for the cramping, as that turned into her main area of focus as Tony led her to his bar. She clutched her stomach as he squatted down to check the mini fridges. He stood back up with his hands on his hips, brows furrowed as he looked deep in thought.
“When have they ever terrorized you?” he asked with laughter.
“It’s fine, not like Steve’s going anywhere anytime soon. Even with his job he’s still the safest safety man around.” Tony smiled at that, thinking about the man he’d chosen to love.
“I’m sorry,” he said in a small voice. James immediately squeezed him closer.
"I know...and I'm genuinely sorry, Clint," he said in a more somber tone, thinking of the blonde waiting for him. Thinking of the awful things he's said to him. "I really don't deserve you after everything you went through...after everything I put you through. But if you'll let me, I'd like to make it up to you. I meant it what I said before, Clint. You're the one for me. Please give me another chance." He noticed Clint's eyes getting watery as he spoke, and didn't mind that he felt his own eyes match.
“She said…when my Dad died, you tried to give me to her,” she said in what Steve almost thought sounded like a fond voice.
When they arrived at the wolves, she squirmed off Clint to get down. Once on her feet, she bolted towards the glass and pressed her face up against it. There they were, beautiful dark grey wolves. In the corner in a makeshift cave, she could make out a few cubs playing.
It had been four years since she last saw him. It was also just after the last and final time he had raped her. That fat, disgusting man had been heaving himself on top of her, ignoring her small cries to “stop.” When he rutted to a finish, he pulled out of her before tucking himself back into his pants. Didn’t even look at her as he made his way out of the room. She could hear him loudly asking the men, “who’s next?” before they laughed and started offering payment to get the chance. In that moment, she felt a fire burn deep inside of her, spreading throughout the rest of her body. Some primal, animal extinct told her to run and survive. It felt like something had snapped, waking her up to the idea that she couldn’t keep letting this happen. That she had to be the one to stop it. I’m done, the then eleven year old had thought to herself, no one is next.
“–oh my god, I hate you,” she lied as she laughed against his chest.
“How’s everything?” his Pop asked before kissing his temple and pulling back. He was ready to give his usual ‘everything is fine’ response, but he’d never been able to lie to that man.
“The first meeting is a formality,” she continued assuredly, “we aren’t talking about anything deep today. Just getting to know each other and finding out if there is anything specifically you’d like to get out of therapy.”
“Did something happen at school?” Steve asked, turning his attention back to her.
," he whispered as quietly as a five year old could. Which was to say she and her brother could hear it clearly from the other side of the large couch.
Tony took this opportunity to glare at his old friend, who had long since been unaffected by his angry face.
PETER
Tony offered a kind smile in thanks as Thor changed the subject to a tale of his youth.
“She said…” she began, cutting herself off from continuing by closing her mouth shut.
“Um…” she thought sincerely, wracking her brain for that third thing.
“Aw, of course not. You are a perfectly adequate parent,” she said with a shit eating grin. His jaw hooked to the side as he raised his brows at her. That ‘
She didn’t answer his call, texting him that she was preparing for a job interview and couldn’t talk.
He tried not to think about all that, because he was definitely partly to blame for this. But as he would stubbornly say till the day he dies – he wouldn’t let anything stop him from saving someone he loved. So…grounded or not – he would find a way to help. And maybe override Jarvis to get his suit back. And is now obviously double and maybe tripled grounded. So much for turning eighteen in a few hours…
"Well for teachers, they're pretty stupid," Peter piped up, getting a laugh from everyone but the super soldier.
He went back into the apartment, looking everywhere for a fucking note she might’ve left. Sure, she didn’t know he had gotten off work early, but she should know better than to leave without the phone she had
“Yes,” he finally admitted, quietly and with a pout. An exhausting sigh of relief left him. He took a moment to keep his eyes downcast before looking back up at the blonde. Who only wore a bright smile, beaming back down at him like he wasn’t secretly the biggest idiot in the world.
Peter tried a different tactic, since his father was of no help and admitting defeat was obviously out of the picture. “Emerson! Help a…brotha OUT.” Em looked at the two, smiling, before giving her answer.
“You’re welcome to sleep on the couch tonight to get away from it,” Steve argued, with no meaning behind it since neither could sleep well without the other. And Tony knew that, as the genius only stuck his tongue out at the blonde while he followed the others to the elevator.
“That’s a fucked up term,” he said instead, catching the genius off guard to the point of breaking out in a laugh, overwhelmed from the roller coaster of emotions he just experienced. “So, let me see if I can get this straight,” Steve suddenly switched to a Brooklyn accent, which immediately froze the brunette. “Your genius brain heard a snippet of a conversation,” he continued while crawling towards the genius, gently pushing the smaller man back in order to climb on top of him and straddle his thighs, “and decided that instead of confronting your man about it, you would come to the conclusion that I secretly meant I wanted out of this family? Is that what your genius brain did?”
She paced around her room, stepping carefully to be able to listen for the front door opening. He could possibly be calling the cops against Bill.
Upon hearing police sirens approaching, he remembered suddenly that he was on a time limit. He left the bag to swing home as quickly as possible, changing back to his normal clothes when he was out of eyeshot of the Tower’s security cameras.
“Hey! No baby,” Jackson giggled in retort.
don’t want to hire one.”
But Peter did, and was beginning to wonder if Wade was distancing himself from him for a reason.
The super soldier was surprised when the genius grabbed his hand and pulled it up to his lips, pausing a moment to kiss his palm.
Wade likes you too. Peter couldn’t control his smile as he got into bed, didn’t really mind waking up with one the next day either.
She wasn’t sure how long she slept, but she woke to the sounds of people arguing. Keeping Wolf in her arms, she carefully made her way to the sounds. It only took a moment to recognize the voices, her face frowning when she could hear her father and Steve arguing.
~I like it when you call me big poppa~ and then, as if rehearsed, the two teenagers thrust their arms up to sing along ~throw your hands in the air, if you’se a true playa~… ¬both teenagers practically falling off their stools from laughing so hard. Steve remained quiet and confused, even as Jarvis stopped the music.
“Nice,” she added for good measure, smiling again at Joey before speaking.
His son. His baby boy was…
“Oh I’m well aware, my hand still stings,” the troll said, looking at his red hand.
“People could take advantage of me,” she said remembering, feeling more tears cascade down her cheek.
The two guys were instantly cheering for her. Steve couldn’t help himself, he brought her into a hug and kissed her cheeks a few times for good measure.
“We’d better get going to the kitchen,” he said with a smile. “Peter may have already eaten all the cool whip by now.” Hearing her laugh, so damn carefree and innocent, warmed Steve’s heart as the two made their way to the kitchen.
"That's your son," she said to her wife accusingly, who simply pulled her phone out again to snap a few more pics.
“Yeah, took me a while. Now I love them...Daci if you ever want to talk about what happened, I want you to know you can talk to me, okay? You know...you know I went through similar...circumstances.” Daci smiled at the suggestion, feeling unwanted tears begin to form in her eyes from the amount of trust and security she felt at the moment.
She shrugged in response, “…it’s not really
A moment later the door opened, the two turning to watch as the nurse wheeled in a glass box...with...with a sleeping pup inside.
,” she said, smiling with her parents who laughed along with her. “No, you guys! She’s so fast! I literally tried to outrun her!” she said before bursting into laughter. Steve rolled his eyes fondly as he continued laughing at the image.
“Maybe she actually wants to walk to her Daddy,” Bucky said as he stretched his arms out to encourage her to walk to him. Steve had her wrap her tiny hands around his index fingers, lightly supporting her first few steps before letting her go. She took two whole steps before falling forward and into Bucky’s arms.
That he was going to lose him anyway...so maybe he should end it before he actually hurt the kind older teen.
“Renee?” Carolyn asked with a smile. Joey didn’t return the smile, but did nod in response. “Do you know where I got Renee from when I named your mother?”
“And I’m Irish,” Steve quipped back. Tony rolled his eyes fondly at the troublemaker. “You think it’s just a coincidence you came to both my games and I happened to win both of them?”
The music was pretty decent, but he was waiting for Steve before actually joining the others on the dance floor. So he stood next to Bruce, chatting about his latest invention and definitely not counting down the seconds until Steve should arrive. Tony estimated it would take at least twenty minutes for the blonde to shower...pause to vividly imagine...and get dressed.
"Don't be mad Papa, Daddy was just trying to help me. I had a nightmare.
Tony couldn’t stop pacing, ignoring the numerous people telling him to stop. Offhandedly, the thought that it was ten years to the day since they’d graduated high school flashed across his mind. Huh...that means their ten year reunion would be soon. Good thing he had a valid excuse to skip it.
“It was actually Cheryl’s idea. A friend of hers found him on the side of the road. Brought him to the vet to get fixed up, but couldn’t keep him. She thought...she thought he’d help you out. He’s been at my house for the last few days. I was going to bring him yesterday but you weren’t at school...and I figured you might need some space. Fair warning, Suzie and Jackson are obsessed with him and threatened my parents with running away to come live with you...and Lucky.”
“I hate being in foster care,” the boy said angrily as Emerson felt her expression change to a worried one.
“Just please don’t tell dads, okay? Guys?” Miles asked, desperation clear in his voice and his clasped hands in front of him. Peter looked from his stupid brother to his stupid husband, sighing when his husband gave him the ‘your call’ look.
Didn’t even realize it was Rumlow and his crew until he stepped back outside again.
“Don’t give me a reason to. And. I. Won’t,” he said, mostly to be obnoxious.
“Maybe one day you’ll tell me,” his boyfriend said quietly as Clint felt himself cringe in response.
“Huh,” Harley said as Steve turned back to preparing dinner. There was a moment of silence as Steve wondered if he’d said the right thing. But then the pup spoke up again, this time in a quiet voice. “Jurassic Park.”
It only took a second for the blonde to put the food down and whirl around until he was facing Bucky again.
"Where are our parents?" he asked her, smiling as she kept reading her book and didn't look up to answer.
He wasn’t having that. It wasn’t anyone else’s job to fight his battles. He didn’t let her finish as he got out of the car and walked up the sidewalk to the front door. Before he knocked, he took a look back and saw she had remained in the car, heart panging a little in his chest. He waited a few moments after knocking and tried ringing the doorbell twice. He heard movement behind the door before someone finally opened it.
“Well. Right now I think I’m incredibly
“We’re going to Build-A-Bear!” Amanda answered, shyness suddenly gone.
“James, your father. ‘Old man’ is another way to say ‘dad’.”
lawyers and I – as an actual Christian – have been blessed in my life to give to the poor, not
“Oh, okay. So you and Uncle Bucky are staying with us?” Daci nodded as she considered that word over and over again in her mind.
The blonde was slightly less shaken than the brunette, at least enough to catch the running child to hold in his arms.
Steve, the wonderful Alpha of his, signed on to take over Stark Industries so Tony could actually run it for himself when Howard finally retired. Steve turned into a full time house husband while still doing part time work for Pappy’s gym.
“Daci? JARVIS said someone was at my door. What’s up kiddo?” Clint asked with a yawn as he rubbed a hand over his face.
By the time he’d made it home, he had definitely calmed down. Not significantly, mind you. He was still pissed as hell as he went straight to his room, ignoring whichever sibling was calling him as he slammed his door shut before collapsing on his bed.
“I brought an olive branch! And by olive branch I mean Olive Garden breadsticks!” In an instant, Clint was up off the couch and opening the door. His heart melted when James chuckled at his speed, holding a bag in one hand...while his other hand was behind his back.
She simply shrugged her shoulders in response, still chewing the snack in her mouth.
“Hey Joey!” he greeted as he stayed sitting on the floor.
Emerson and Miles raced each other to the elevator on the ground floor of the Tower, giggling as Steve walked a little slower behind them. Miles looked incredibly handsome with his new do, while Emerson looked like the badass she is on the inside. The sides and back of her head were shaved while she kept the top a little longer, hair still able to hang a little in her face. She also colored the top with purple and blue to give it a galaxy affect. Peter had replied to the father that he was jealous and absolutely loved their new haircuts, he also asked to record Tony's reaction to the changes. Steve declined, offering the young man to see for himself rather than further embarrass his husband.
“Where’s Clint?” Steve asked, wanting to change the subject and not have Bucky ask him for the upteenth time why he chose Tony.
He was interrupted from continuing his teasing when his husband threw a towel at his head, getting a laugh from the teens.
“Your Pop and I talked about taking you guys on vacation after I’m done recovering. Like Disney world or somewhere fun after all the shit we’ve been going through.” She found herself smiling at that, still unable to look up at the men.
“I can’t believe you guys,” she snapped at the man suddenly at her side and handing her a towel. She snatched it from him and began angrily wiping the water off her body.
They all made sure to sing 'happy birthday' obnoxiously loud, Clint and Sam adding "you look like a monkey and smell like one too," to the song. Steve stole a glance at his kid, whose face was lit up with pure glee as her girlfriend stole an adorable kiss on her cheek.
“Hell yeah! You’re so smart, for all I know you’ve got the cure for cancer ready. Which way?” Steve asked, still wondering if it’d be weird to ask for a tour as he looked around. When his eyes settled back on Tony, the brunette had a weird expression on his face. “Tony?” he asked, suddenly concerned. But then Tony shook whatever it was off and smiled brightly at Steve.
“Please don’t tell anyone!” he panicked.
“It is well past eight, what the hell did you get into last night?”
“Okay, well...I’m...I’m just going to say it…”
Tony’s eyebrows raised, a teasing grin spreading across his face as he asked, “how long is a while?”
“Buck, don’t get her all riled up. I’m the one who has to put her to bed while you go to work,” Steve said with a small frown, disappearing when his brother turned back; absolutely offended.
Wade looked back at him, slightly confused, before answering “because you asked me?”
of seeing that woman as he also felt Natasha release her grip.
“This one is small and cheap, I promise,” her Dad said, handing her the small rectangular box with Wonder Woman wrapping paper; excellent choice.
“What?”
“STEVE.”
She gently grabbed his wrists until she could get him to look at her. He stubbornly remained curled over even when she maneuvered herself to sit directly in front of him and grabbed his face with her hands, forcing the flooded dark brown eyes to meet her green ones.
"Contrary to popular belief, I have better emotional range than a toddler. I'll stay silent until you're done," he promised as he readjusted himself on the couch, feeling a tiny flutter of anxiety in his stomach.
“Look what you did,” his Pop said accusingly at his Dad.
“I’m only doing this for my love of Peter – who I expect to see frequently over the next 3 months.” He considered being offended but then changed his mind.
“It’s not...it’s not you guys. You guys are...creepily perfect,” he said with a laugh when James chuckled next to him before wrapping an arm around him. Clint leaned against him, enjoying his warmth. He had told his boyfriend bits and pieces about his past, but he hadn’t gotten to the deep stuff.
“Why don’t you and your nakey butt go help Nana? Uncle Steve and I need to finish in here,” he suggested as he kissed her cheek and placed her on the ground.
After both babies ate and were promptly cleaned, he brought them into the living room and put some cartoons on, knowing it would be a while until anyone else woke up.
Pete whispered, getting another chuckle from the men as they both carefully moved to wrap their arms around him.
“It’s okay, Em. My offer still stands. And with that ear, an argument could be made for making cookies and eating most of the dough.” She couldn’t help but laugh against her father’s chest, feeling thankful for the ten thousandth time that this was her family.
The elevator ride to the penthouse seemed longer than usual. “Jarvis?” she asked the AI.
“How old was he?” Emerson asked, clearly enjoying Peter’s embarrassment.
“Yeah, really people may not know it was her but might get suspicious if you’re yelling at a five year old after a man crashed through a window. Peter’s fine, Daci’s fine, let’s just go eat lunch and check out the rest of the zoo,” Clint added with a hand on Daci’s shoulder.
“Huh I guess you’re right,” she said slowly placing her card on the top of the deck; a red seven. “Just not the way you thought, huh?” Her other two uncles erupted in congratulatory laughter as she won the game. They then turned their attention to a stunned Sam, teasing him for losing and not being the better ninja.
Five weeks into their relationship and Steve couldn’t even describe the kind of happiness he felt whenever he saw, talked to, or even thought about Tony. He was the one who finally convinced him to try out for Captain, helping him study as Peter provided background music. His Uncle Rhodey apparently sent him a toy guitar that he was in fact rocking while Tony promised swift revenge on his longtime friend.
And before any other thought could form in Bucky’s mind - a wave of memories came flooding back so fast that it had the man knocked down to the floor.
She had already met Pepper when she first got here, but seemed glad to see her again when she brought along Rhodey and Sam for lunch another day. Steve laughed along with the others when Rhodey shared embarrassing stories of Tony as Sam cooked everyone a meal. He kept laughing even at his own expense when Sam brought up some additional stories of the super soldier. Kept smiling as he saw the way the young girl’s eye lit up with the more embarrassing tales.
“What charity?” Steve asked before Tony took a step back, gauging his response before answering.
“Tati...I don’t really want to-”
“Seriously?” “That’s actually really cool.”
Also the photo they chose for the cover is a shout out to my favorite Presidential couple - Barack and Michelle Obama. It's a very sweet picture; the photographer caught them in a very cute moment, where Michelle later said she remembered during the photo-shoot break that she was telling her husband to 'get it together' since he was pouting about having to take pictures XD
“–What on earth is going on here?” she heard her Aunt Pepper’s voice behind her; she hadn’t even noticed Aunt Pepper and her entourage had walked into the scene – all wearing Stark Expo logos and badges on their arms. Usually her heels clicking were a dead giveaway.
“He said some not so nice things about us fags, tried to convince Leo that we were secretly planning to rape him and when Leo called him a liar, he went on a rant about us white devils poisoning his ‘sissy’ son, some unsavory things about Melanie, and back to us child-raping/child-abandoning fags,” the man said with his normal sassy bluntness, but at least in a semi-quiet voice.
"What are you guys talking about?" the boy asked as they left the room, instantly shocking Peter.
“I’m going to go check on Joey,” he said, excusing himself to give Tony some privacy.
am fine.”
“That doesn’t sound like you weren’t good enough, Pete. Sounds like…he loved you too much to drag you in to his shit,” Steve said honestly as he rubbed his son’s placid arm, hoping he was really listening. He seemed to be, taking a moment to let that sink in before the father continued.
"Come on Hel, how bout I fix us some drinks?" he said to their daughter in law, laughing at the pout Jo threw in his direction. Peter followed them with Sam into the kitchen, leaving Steve, Jo and a still naked Jamie behind.
He stayed there, nestled in his love’s strong arms, debating with himself whether or not to tell the truth.
“So it...de-ages people by twenty something years?” Miles asked, doing the math in his head. “Would I like...cease to exist?” he turned to ask his Uncle Bruce.
His smile dropped as he looked deep in thought, not answering until he pulled into park in their garage.
Since the entire school knew about her new parents, they often liked to mock her for not
He double checked that he had locked the door to his car before heading inside the high school to the front office. Behind the welcome counter were two teenage girls, office aids – he recognized, whose unprofessionalism showed the way their eyes comically bulged and gawked at the tired father with a forced smile. Of course he appreciated those that stood behind the symbol he had worked hard to cultivate, but right now he wasn’t Captain America – he was Steve who just hoped whatever damage had been done didn’t mean a lecture from Pepper...
“Relax, lad, I did nothin of the sort,” the older Alpha said with a smirk. “Alright you two, I want a clean fight. Three two one,” Pappy said before ringing the bell. Steve put his fists up as Harley began circling him, the pup trying and failing to keep a straight face. It got Steve to break a smile as well, bringing his arms down a little before a punch to his stomach had the Alpha flat on his back.
“Can I have a hug, little guy? I’ll miss you.”
is that you already have people in your life that love you, very much. Families come in all shapes and sizes, kiddo.” She couldn’t help smiling at that.
“Daciana. Baby, please we are here to take you home,” he choked out, unaware that tears had begun to form in his eyes.
“Wounded! I’ve been wounded!” Tony cried out before collapsing to the floor, clearing pretending to be in real pain. It got another laugh from Daci as Morgan screeched in giggles from her father’s antics. “JARVIS, time of death. Tell my husband I loved him. And make sure Morgan is ripped out of my will,” Tony rasped out as he reached a hand out towards the ceiling.
She turned to her left to see Kimberly approaching her from about twenty feet away. She stood frozen as Sam made his way to stand in between the two. She reached up to gently touch her uncle’s shoulder in reassurance. She didn’t consider her a threat, after all.
Buck thought to himself as he shouted at the child.
“I’d be so full of your spunk, maybe a little will spill out…drip down my leg…”
, Tony thought to himself,
“Watch your language, he went to get my
SEVERAL MINUTES AGO…
“No, Tony, we really should –”
The rest of the day dragged on slowly, her anxiety increasing with each passing hour. She cursed her friend Xavier for being out sick today, she could use someone in her corner.
When he woke the third time, it was unlike anything he had every experienced. He had muscles. Like, muscle-muscles. He was always toned, working out with his Pops and playing multiple sports. But he never had a goddamn six-pack. Pushing all of this new and exciting sensory overload to the side for the moment, he focuses on getting out.
“You know what, Pete’s right,” Tony said after a beat. “What about just dinner with the Avengers? We’ll make Sam cook and everything.”
But right now, Tony just pulled over and cried in a parking lot until his coffee turned cold.
“I know,” Bucky said confidently, smiling as his boyfriend pushed him back to lie on the bed. He looked up at bright blue eyes, totally and completely ready to hand over the reigns to Clint.
Bruce was holding a small flashlight to Emerson’s eyes, the teen sitting on the counter slightly shaking one of her dangling legs; she was covered in several bandages. In a chair off to the side, sat a familiar figure bent over himself. Peter was in sweats and had his arms wrapped around his bent legs, head down.
Both men were startled by that, the three started laughing as Steve shook his head back and forth.
She snuggled closer to her father and watched as Morgan pulled his long hair, smiling to herself as the two interacted with one another. Maybe one day he’d consider having more kids, she might not mind having siblings.
“He said he’d be your bottom,” she continued pointing to Steve before turning back to Tony. “And he said he’d let you decide, cause you’re the genius…” she continued as the fathers just kept laughing. Poor Xavier was blushing furiously.
She could walk again, though it was small steps at a time.
“Because…because I wasn’t good enough –” he choked out a little sob, breaking the super soldier’s heart.
“That’s absolutely right,” Tony said with a shaky voice, eyes on Steve as the blonde felt a vast amount of love pushing through the bond. They looked at each other another moment before the fourth member of their little family cried out for attention.
"Are you serious?" he asked as James nodded with a bright smile. "What did she say?"
“DADDY!” the boy cried in anguish as the two adults leapt off the couch; Tony following just behind Steve as they made their way to Peter’s room.
“Beloved, can you get my med kit from the kitchen drawer?” Steve looked at Joey while he asked, frowning at seeing her look down at the implication.
“Em, may I open this folder?”
“– this is
“Don’t give me that look, she likes your reading better,” Bucky said as he plopped down on the couch next to Steve. Joey returned a moment later, an entire stack of books in her tiny arms – so much so that a few dropped along the way.
He scrubbed his hands over his face as he sat back on the bed, giving the blonde space to get a better control on his breathing.
“Steve?” Harley asked quietly, causing the Alpha to turn around.
“Thank you, Dr. Strange, for everything,” Steve said before heading back to the group, hugging Harley close to his chest.
“I love you,” Bucky said easily, feeling it with every fiber of his being. The comment slowed Clint down a little, looking softer as the blonde smiled back at him.
“I do. I really do Harley. You know how I’m your legal guardian? Well, I’ve been wanting to adopt you, but I wanted you to be okay with that first.”
“Hey Daci, Steve’s in the kitchen if you wanna go help him,” Tony offered with a smile as he began tickling Morgan. Daci returned the smile before heading to the kitchen to greet Steve.
“Wow,” Jo said, “If anyone else had gotten knocked up by Tony Stark, they’d exploit it for all it’s worth. You guys kept Peter a secret, you don’t take more child support than you need to, heck if I was in your shoes I’d be a stay-at-my-home/mansion-mom,” she said with a laugh. May shook her head fondly, laughing along with the teen.
[Yay Xavier, boo Voldemort. See you soon love <3]
“Alright, let’s set some ground rules, cause neither of you bums are puking in the jeep,” Bucky started as he parked among the rows of cars. “When I say we’re leaving, we’re leaving, deal?” he asked the two, though he was directing his gaze at the stubborn blonde.
a fucking monster. I had a restraining order against him…it must’ve expired…” he trailed off looking away from Steve, blinking away several tears.
"Shit, I'm sorry Steve I didn't mean to upset you. Fuck, you're on vacation and I am ruining it with my crazy thoughts. Don't listen to me Steve, I spend way too much time out here by myself," Bucky tried to reassure him as Steve fake smiled back at him. His family walked back over to join the men as Steve did his best to compose himself from the state of shock he was momentarily in.
Her parents left early Friday morning, and Nat and Clint worked until eight. She thought about that at school, wondering what she’d do with those precious hours between school and promising her pseudo-fam she’d be home on time.
Some time later he was beginning to nod off and decided now was a good stopping point, checking the time to see it was a little after five am. Normally he would just down a pot of coffee and continue, but he had a meeting at seven that Pepper had threatened castration over should he miss it.
Like this weekend, when they took her paintballing. It. Was. Amazing.
She looked back at him skeptically, eyes squinting at him but ultimately scooting over close enough for him to grab her. Minding her sore bottom, he carefully brought her over to sit comfortably in his lap. When she didn’t yelp in pain, he kept her steady with one arm while reaching the other one out to grab the tablet.
“Who did this to you?” Tony asked painfully.
“I’ll behave, I promise,” Tony said with a smile, putting the pictures in his backpack.
“Wanna know what my father said when I told him?”
"I guess I'll let Daddy have you for now. But remember you're mine little bear," Steve said, maturely sticking his tongue out at the pup who retaliated in kind.
“I don’t know, but we need a vacation soon,” Steve suggested. “Maybe just the two of us at a secluded beach?” he asked with a smile.
“Surprised you even found this room, did you have to ask Jarvis where I was?” he sassed back to his husband. The brunette rolled his eyes fondly but didn’t argue, walking over to the man to wrap his arms around his waist while Steve kept folding Peter’s clothes.
It was only natural Tony reached out and rubbed his hand on his husband’s abs when his shirt lifted enough to see them.
“Darling, if you hadn’t been pacing like a madman you wouldn’t have gotten in sweet Pietro’s way,” Aunt Peggy unhelpfully said, looking down on him after he fell in front of her chair. Sarah was sitting next to her, also unhelpful as she just chuckled.
“Nonsense, crazy pants. Those fuckers ruined it – and besides,” he stole a smile at Peter, “pretty sure your AI would rat me out to your daddies that I was here before even meeting them.” Wade took a step to Peter, leaning in for a kiss, which Peter delightfully returned.
“Hey Cap, some guy’s here to see you?”
“Harley, pup look who’s here.” Steve was caught a little off guard from that, fully expecting the pup to cling tighter to his grandfather. Instead, the Alpha watched with misty eyes as the pup’s eyes lit up when he saw him. He wasn’t harmed, which did ease a little from the ache in his chest.
He could hear soft murmurs around him, recognizing his family surrounding them but eyes trained on the most beautiful creature alive.
“I promise, Peter.”
. She was not impressed with his joke, nor his updates.
“You’re a fucking coward,” she said, staring the devil in the eyes. “And if you’re stupid enough to think they’ll fall for your bull shit, then you’re a fucking stupid coward –” He smacked her hard enough this time that the momentum caused her and the chair to tumble sidways, her head smacking the concrete on impact. The men laughed as she laid there, praying for a miracle, finding a small one when she noticed the ropes around her hands were looser. The chair was wooden and old and had broken somewhat with the weight of her fall. As the four men, she was finally able to see, made their way to the door she was able to get her hands free. She tested her feet, glad to see they also had wiggle room. As she heard the men laugh, probably at her expense, she freed her feet and grabbed a sharp piece of wood that had broken off and landed beside her. She heard the other three leave without closing the door and knew the monster remained, feet pounding as he made his way back to her. When he bent down to grab her by her hair, she thrust the makeshift weapon into his fat stomach, glad to hear him roar in return. He took a few steps back, clutching his gut as blood poured from the wound. She got herself up, holding the bloody piece of broken wood in defense, waiting for the men to come barging back into the room.
“Joey?” Steve asked, catching the tail end of their conversation. “What did you mean by that?”
Steve smiled at the sounds of his kids laughing and that smile grew when he heard his husband complaining loudly – knowing they were laughing at him. The super soldier opened his eyes, drinking in the sight before him.
And that's when he heard the singing.
“Not every party is an excuse to be a fashionista-diva. Some of us plan on having
“You okay bro?” she asked concerned.
After hearing that Joey had smoked weed and given herself a seizure, Tony mentally prepared himself to tell his husband.
Apparently not alone.
“Please don’t give her any ideas,” Bucky pleaded with his eyes closed in frustration.
"Well hot damn. Can't really be mad when you look that good, Em! I love it!" Tony said as he focused his attention on playing with their daughter's new hair. Steve moved to sit next to Miles, who leaned tiredly against the father, as the two of them watched Tony and Emerson fan over her new hair.
“It would explain the spark I felt when we first shook hands! And the amazing sex. And how I could still apparently get you pregnant
It took him a moment to find it, clearing his thick blonde hair to find the one that was a slightly different color.
"No, I promised I wouldn't be mad," he said through clenched teeth as he closed his eyes to take a few breaths. When he opened his eyes again, the anger was finally able to dissipate at the sight of the fear in his daughter. She had leaned away from him, unsure how he'd react to her confession.
“Have you two picked out a name yet?” Joe asked to his right, still holding a curious Wade.
Rhodey – Jesus he loved that man – was immediately at his side while Steve took the other, standing in front of the man Tony had sincerely hoped he’d never see again.
asked for.
He wasn’t lying before, he really was the lucky one.
. And it’s not like they didn’t have a right to be. But Steve also knew about being experimented on in the army…and he also knew what it felt like to love someone who runs from love when they don’t feel good enough. He had to convince Tony he loved him nearly daily since he had first said the words. Over twenty years later and he still does it from time to time. Though it seemed the thick headed love of his life had started to believe him over the last few years. That he was good and deserved all the love in the world.
He told them both he needed to speak with him, waiting in the dining room until they joined him, with his father not surprisingly arriving last and in a huff.
“Good grief, when’s my
“But I don’t want you to have a baby!” the six year old suddenly cried out, standing up off the couch and glaring at the pair.
There was a huff from Sunset, but Tony ignored her in favor of pushing Steve to sit in the chair.
“She…had a brain aneurism shortly after giving birth to Jo,” Steve explained.
“Yeah, I’ll give you that. Now come on, you owe me an essay,” he said, smiling as she groaned loudly and followed him out of the car and up the sidewalk.
He was beyond glad the mission ended sooner than expected. He missed his husband fiercely and knew the brunette was probably lacking some very much needed sleep worrying about him. He also knew Peter still had another day left at his camp, so Steve hangs on to the hope Tony and Emerson found a way to support each other with his absence.
“Tony!” his Pop snapped, shooting the shorter man a glare. “We agreed to let
“But you shouldn’t have to, that’s my point –”
He smiled down at the blonde before grabbing the front of his shirt to smash their lips together.
“Come on Daci! We got like a billion more animals to see!” Peter called as he pulled Steve along to the next exhibit. She looked back at her father and caught him in a quiet and smiley conversation with the woman. Daci turned back to Clint and saw him was also watching the two but with a sad face. So she grabbed Clint’s hand once more before leading the two after the Starks - who were making their way to some really big cats.
“...How did you do it?” Peter asked with a wave of his hands, still fuming and well aware that Miles would need notes from Peter’s office in order to replicate the serum.
He had considered abortion right from the start, but something had kept him from it until now.
“Breaking and entering, assault of a minor, driving while under the influence…I don’t know…Hill said she’d send me a copy of the police report,” the blonde said.
“I ninja,” she said simply with a smile and a shrug. She, like the boy who answered the door and the one in his arms, were blonde. “Who dat Bucky?” she asked, interrupting Clint’s thoughts.
The kitchen was the biggest kitchen Steve had ever seen. He gathered the nerve to ask before turning to Tony.
was just white trash…like me. Except Steve has always felt like a ‘real parent’ to me – who I betrayed by going behind his back to speak to my maternal grandmother who
They arrived home, squishing together in the elevator with Happy who carried most of the shopping bags. They may have gone a little crazy, getting the boy an entire new wardrobe...along with some toys after Miles gave his best puppy eyes.
“Then why was he at the hospital checking on you?” Steve asked, feeling his son’s anger dissipate in realization. He knew all too well the fear in loving another person wholly. And while he thought his son was too young to necessarily marry the vigilante – he saw how happy Wade made Peter. And how miserable he was without him; even with their new alter egos that now terrified the father.
EMERSON
“I’m sorry to hear that, sounds like he was a good brother,” Tony said fondly. Steve looked back into those dark brown eyes and smiled appreciatively, nodding in response.
“Joey, what’d you do to make your daddy spank you?” Steve asked with a small smile, reaching back to pat her head; smiling at seeing there was still flour in her brown curls. He leaned back a little more, seeing the light pink on her bottom – only somewhat covered by the remaining flour.
“I’m pregnant,” Tony said, unable to fight the tears in his eyes. He was dreading this and how they would react. What if they abandoned him like Ty had done?
“Thanks!” she said as she dragged the other teen out of the kitchen.
“You’re not exactly great at hiding it. I saw the WW + PS you wrote on your notebooks. Don’t need to be a son of a genius to put two and two together.”
“Well if you’re too busy then by all means-”
“I said
“You said you had second thoughts about our marriage, Steven! I’m pretty sure that includes me-”
“Hey sweetheart, we’re here,” Steve said with a smile, standing in front of the genius with their luggage in his hands. “Come on, I want to change and hit the beach.” That got Tony moving, helping Steve with the luggage to his private beach house. He changed into gold booty shorts, laughing when he saw his husband put on a blue speedo before the two raced each other to the waves.
“Is that what you’d really want, Peter?” Steve asked, suddenly very serious.
She did a moment later, sitting down gently on the couch next to him. That had Tony sitting upright, since she normally plopped herself down enthusiastically on the cushions.
“Use the house phone!” his mom called back, getting a chuckle from the teens for every mom’s ability to eavesdrop. Rhodey led Steve to house phone, grabbing the cordless one and offering Steve the kitchen for privacy.
“Dad told me he was supposed to be a Rogers, but then your birth dad died and Nana couldn’t afford it on her own. His bio dad was a nightmare, right?” she asked in confirmation.
The super soldier kneeled down to appear smaller to the child, though he still towered over the boy. He smiled at the shy kiddo who hid a little behind his sister.
“Thanks May,” she said to the woman before quickly sticking her tongue out to her parents, smiling when only Tony returned the gesture.
…with…Tony Stark.”
“Holy
“Cause I’m it for you too,” Steve said with a big grin, which grew when Tony rolled his eyes at that.
His negative thoughts were put on hold when he heard a cry from the living room, running and halting in his steps when he saw his boys laughing and chasing each other. Daci was sitting on the floor, watching them with a smile on her face. Before he could make his presence known, Harley caught his eye and screeched his name out in excitement.
“Thanks for this Daci,” the redhead said with a sigh from where she sat on the floor.
"You're eating this, Pop?" she asked teasingly as she spooned a decent portion onto her plate.
“Privileged means you have certain advantages in life. Like having a rich daddy, or still having both your parents, or even having an extra parent who loves you just as much as us. So yes, you’re privileged, but you’re not spoiled. Spoiled means you get whatever you want in life. Do you get everything you ask for?” he waited for Peter to shake his head again, brows furrowing as the boy took in his dad’s words.
He bent down and kissed the scar, stopping when his love pushed him back in protest.
," Miles said as he bit into his food. Emerson looked at Wade, whose eyes were still closed in pain, before looking over to Peter who shrugged in response.
He partially understands why Joey wouldn’t tell him. She had snuck out to see her homophobic grandmother while she lied to him about it. He’d be furious to find that out. And of course he was, but he was also upset about the amount of secrets she’s been keeping from him lately.
“Can I um...do something for you Clint?” the brunette asked, though there was a hint of a smile in his voice. He shifted the toddler in his arms as the boy started getting cuddly. It was pretty damn cute.
to do
He’d give them a little bit of donut later, but he knew better than to give them sugar this early in the morning.
“Steve,” Tony said with a Cheshire grin, reaching over to grab the picture and holding it above the blonde’s head. They both knew that Steve could throw him off if he wanted to, but that wasn't as much fun.
“Just a second!” she heard her voice call from behind the door, suddenly more nervous as she listened to footsteps approach. The door swung open, and Daci shifted from one foot to the other as Vivienne stood there in shock. “Daciana?”
Which turned out to be quite difficult when your celebrity father showed up at your school unannounced.
“Yeah, I think you might be my lucky charm.” Tony pretended to be offended.
“Yes,” he answered automatically before James could take it back. The beautiful man below him smiled brightly, blinking away his own tears before standing up and fiercely kissing the blonde. “Are you...are you serious?” Clint asked when they pulled apart for air, pinching himself even as James slipped the ring on his finger.
“I see better from a distance,” the man pouted, going so far as to cross his arms over his chest and make Daci stifle a giggle.
“So...Tati...if you don't mind I call him Daddy...why aren’t you two married?”
“Story Steeb?” she asked as she rubbed her eyes with her tiny fists. He looked back at his brother who was giving him his own pleading look, huffing before finally relenting.
PETER
“Not the point here!” he yelled. He swallowed some anger, but only some after she rolled her eyes at him. “Joey. Why did you punch a girl in the face?”
“Not at all, Lilli will make an adorable Pocahontas,” Em said loudly before lowering her voice to continue. “I wanted to be Mulan anyway.”
“This fucking sucks, Steve,” he said eliciting a laugh from the blonde. The brunette smiled warmly at the man, “I’m furious and confused and sad and so very upset…but I’m glad we’re in this together.”
"What if I told you, this is what it go you?" Steve whispered against his lips before kissing his husband. "And that you clearly weren't listening when Banner said she'd be knocked out for a few hours before the medicine wears off," the blonde said pulling back and smiling at his love. "Plus you have an AI that will warn us if she wakes up."
“Alright bambino, sit up so we can talk about this,” Tony said as he pat his son on his little leg. The pup mumbled something but his voice was muffled by the blankets. “I didn’t hear you baby, come out and talk to me.” The Omega sat there, only waiting another moment before his son pulled the covers back enough to reveal his face. “There’s my handsome boy. Now tell me what all that was about.”
Tony pulled his phone out to easily comply, laughing as they changed their poses for every picture.
“Watch it,” Steve said sharply, motioning her to stay on the counter as he cleaned up the rest of the glass.
Tony’s attention was quickly brought back to the man behind him, who had rested his chin on the genius’ shoulders as he watched him finish cleaning the dishes.
“Hi Vivienne.”
“So you really weren’t mad at me?” the brunette asked. Steve laughed at that, motioning him to join him at the dining room table as the genius sat across from him.
“What did Pappy say to you, bear? I know he told you to fight dirty…” Steve said in a sing-song voice, dodging another punch and blocking a kick from the pup.
Which...went about as well as expected.
, Steve swore to himself, would not be revealed to her. He registered Tony rubbing his shoulder in comfort, feeling himself relax and even smile a little at the kind action.
“Alright, I know you got the beans – so spill them,” he said after a moment.
“She doesn’t seem too traumatized, Buck,” Steve pointed out with a smile as their mom joined them a minute later.
“Uh, no I’m good,” she said with what she hoped was a convincing smile. It wasn’t, as the woman put her car in park and walked over to the teen.
“...I hate you,” he whispered quietly, like the big fat liar he is.
“Don’t you want to know about the rest of us?” Miles asked, voice dripping with annoyance.
“I’m sorry sir, I don’t know what you’re talking about?” the receptionist said ever so sweetly, Tony reminding himself to send her flowers. Maybe send some chocolates to the other doctors and nurses pretending like they hadn’t seen anything either. He turned back to see his husband and daughter in a tight hug.
“What’s wrong with her, Steeb?” Peter asked between puffs of crying breath.
Wade apologized, which was a start. He also promised to temporarily hang up the suit to help out more around the house.
“Sweet! You guys have fun and stay out of trouble,” she said with a wink before leaving to go get ready.
“And you love me?” he asked his boy.
“Well yeah,” he said, giving up on the box after a moment, “but like I said, after I tire you out.” He finished with a smile and turned to her, bringing a matching smile onto her face. She felt herself blush, a little embarrassed with how emotional she was being right now.
“Alright, allow me to be more specific. Why. The fuck,” his voice broke.
“I thought your surgery was next week?”
“Woah, Pops. We are two almost fully grown young adults. It’s not like we’re babies,” Peter said with a teasing smile as he stood.
, no clos,” she said, clapping her hands together with the last four words. He’d never seen so much attitude in such a small being.
“That’s not much better,” she said as she felt her father poke her in the ribs while the two blondes next to her laughed.
"I'm your only sister, smarty pants," she teased as she poked him in the ribs; Miles giggled before responding as if it was obvious.
“I’m not angry at you Tony,” he whispered as he shifted his head to kiss his husband’s cheek. “I promise I don’t fully blame you for today, clearly this man is a fucking psychopath. Especially if the thought of him affects you like this…” he said as the tension in Tony’s body slightly dropped.
“So. I obviously spoke with your parents,” he said nervously. Peter tried to stop the smile on his face at his fluster.
"Do you want to take a shower or just change your pj's?" he asked as he rubbed his son's back in comfort.
“Then I suggest you get your
When Steve got home from his visit with Tony’s family, he was feeling great. It went way better than expected, even if Howard had given him a bit of a shovel talk. But so had Harley, so Steve wasn’t all that intimidated by it.
“You...are...too...late,” she gasped out, eyes changing from fear to confidence even as they began to bulge from her skull.
…” she rushed out.
“I has a brudder...” Lilli piped in, causing the man to laugh as his ridiculous babies.
“Right, well, let me go shower and I’ll come back and help,” the blonde grumbled, smiling at his ridiculous family before making his way to their shower. He made it quick so he could rejoin them in the living room, hair still damp as he found his favorite people in the same positions that he left them.
“You have nothing to be sorry for, this isn’t your fault,” he assured, looking into his eyes. Tony gulped in uncertainty and looked away, causing Steve to gently grab his face in his hands, leaning down to kiss his lips.
She was fidgety the entire plane ride to Wakanda, able to drown out the movies and video games her brothers used to entertain themselves. Thankfully she wasn't worried about Max - who was being watched by one of Pete's friends - but there was something she couldn't stop thinking about.
And giving himself a moment to take a breath.
Her thoughts are interrupted when the front door opens, freezing in her tracks before quickly sitting on the bed waiting for the inevitable.
Fine by me Petey, do you guys need a ride from school?
“Fuck,” Tony whispered, staring at the image of Steve: bent over while his hands spread his cheeks apart, cum dribbling out of his hole, face flushed and overall debauched. “When did you get two mirrors?”
Thanks to his latest upgrades, the suit materialized around him and he was able to quickly catch up to the Panther's jet. As he flew alongside T'Challa's plane to help, they saw another explosion up ahead, propelling them to go faster. Steve was not far behind, informing them he had a suited up Peter with them and that the others were safe.
"Being Spiderman," Peter said with some confidence, even going so far as to meet his Pop's gaze.
He alternated between cheeks, strong arm quickly heating up her backside. She was wearing shorts, and the material did nothing to stop the pain. Joey kicked her leg on accident, regretting it when he paused long enough to pull her basketball shorts down. She cursed herself for not wearing jeans today.
“She was born April 22
“You literally called him ‘perfect’ like, two days ago.”
less obnoxious about being treated. He gathered up the trash and bottles to recycle, handing his siblings some Gatorade to give them more fluids.
“What?” Stark asked with a shrug. “The three stooges are asleep. Go get my second favorite girl and make sure the Winter Soldier doesn’t make an appearance.”
“I’m...I’m going to...go get us some punch,” Steve said as he pointed behind them with both hands. Tony watched as he quickly walked away, enjoying the view for a moment before leaving the dance floor chuckling to himself.
“What?” Steve asked defensively.
“Tonight,” Tony parroted with a smile of his own, and Steve found himself grateful he convinced his parents to move back.
“Pop?” fake Kimberly questioned. Kimberly Johnson was seventeen when she got pregnant with Emerson, the teen still not entirely convinced she was alive.
. From
And even mentioning the possibility usually set off a tantrum, cutting his brother some slack by using word play.
“They’re free to meet him but two at a time, please. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got another surgery to prep for.”
The Omega had kind of secretly been hoping his Alpha would be too big headed to let Ty back into their lives, but then he wouldn’t have been the Alpha he fell head over heels for.
Those thoughts, though on loop in Tony’s mind, did not convince him. And neither did the smug little happy face that appeared on the stick after one hundred and twenty agonizing seconds.
“I’m not drinking anymore, Thor,” Steve replied as she watched Clint reach around the other blonde to steal his drink.
PETER
"Um, Earth to Dad, your sons are rocking an entirely new outfit and you are not snapping any pics," Peter said as Tony turned around to smile at his boys. They were in fact rocking matching black and gold suits complete with gold sunglasses.
This is a first for Steve. He’s never actually shaken with rage towards a loved one. Nor did he ever think his kid could make him this angry.
“I see you two dressed up for the evening,” Tony snarked as he started driving. Clint leaned over to check out their outfits before scoffing at the bedazzled twins.
“You? Sir?” Wade asked skeptically.
“Yes, well, I want to make sure my Pop gets a balanced meal…” The man turned to give her his infamous smirk, not believing her for a second. “…and if we so happen to see Thor…”
“She has a girlfriend, actually.” Barney took that opportunity to slowly turn back to Clint, face scrunched up in confusion.
“I’m not sure what Miss Barnes here has told you but–”
,” she said before turning to look down at her lap. “And I have it for life, except now I know every few years a seizure will overpower the medicine and I’ll need to reup the dosage,” here she stood up and in doing so knocked her chair back a few feet.
“No! I don’t wanna go back there! I want to remember my dad, not look around and think about that…
“Daddy?” Peter asked, standing in the doorway to the kitchen with tears in his eyes. “Are you…
“How does it feel?” her Tati asked as he came to sit next to her by the tub.
“Are you ready for that?” Steve asked patiently. “The press, the paperwork, the added responsibility, we’ve never dealt with something like this, what if we’re wrong for her, what if – “
“Your ‘grandmother’ bullied your
“Enjoying the view. What are
“Tony, you promised you’d behave,” Steve reminded him.
“Ready?” he asked the two practically dancing on their feet. Peter quickly grabbed his father’s hand in excitement, reaching over to grab Joey’s with his other one. She smiled as she complied, not even grimacing at the always somehow sticky fingers of a toddler.
“Do I need to repeat myself? Because there will be no fighting at my house.”
“Joey!” he called out again, louder this time as he tried once more in the front yard.
“Um…Tony, wanna help me out here?” Steve asked quietly with a hint of desperation.
“Boring,” said with an exaggerated sigh Tony to make the kids laugh, though he wasn’t lying about the ‘boring’ part of budget meetings. He put Harley back on the ground before making his way over to sit by Daci, who looked zoned out. “Hey kiddo, you alright?”
“Get off me you big oaf!” he groaned as the man sprawled himself over the blanket covered eighteen year old.
“I’m sorry, it’s nothing,” James said quietly.
And if his parents find out...hopefully Miles will live too.
be dead? I don’t think that qualifies as crazy,” she said with a smile.
“Duh,” the boy sassed, getting a laugh from his dads.
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked in concern as Steve felt tears begin to fill his eyes. He only blinked once and they all came down. “Babe?”
“I’m usually not really hungry after…but I’ll nibble on whatever you guys want.”
“Did you tell her about your surgery?” Steve made himself ask, needing clarification.
"Hey now," the genius said as he opened the door to their room, "I can be mature enough to keep my hands to myself, okay? Especially if it's for the sake of my daughter," he said smugly as he tucked himself into bed while Steve remained standing and just stared at him.
Bucky and Clint were becoming more and more obnoxious about Steve dating Tony, teasing the blonde just about every chance they got.
Kimberly glared at her a moment longer before continuing. “That wasn’t your decision to make, Ashley,” the woman gritted out.
“Bedtime? I thought they weren’t your children...don’t you have parents?” Clint asked as he grabbed the fork and took a bite of the outstretched cake.
He was not this bad as a teenager…but then again…Bucky was. He’d gotten into a fight at a party on behalf of his big brother starting one before. Over a girl, no less. So maybe he should count himself lucky whatever she was injured from, it couldn’t have been as bad as his big brother smashing a guy’s head with a beer bottle. Which was actually a 40…
The doors to the elevator opened and Tony watched as Daci rushed in to join them in the living room, coming to a halt when she saw her father.
Tony rubbed his husband’s shoulder in comfort, not really sure what to say.
saying that.” Peter just glared at him as the dumbass helped him put a still passed out Leo in the backseat.
The group of girls made a semi-circle around Joey, who instinctually opened her stance in case of an ambush.
They sat in silence for a moment, with only the sounds of quiet babbling and small splashing, until the sadness that she could never experience this settled in. She slumped down a little, wiping the bubbles off her hand with a nearby towel.
“Never mind, can we just…go kind of slow?” Steve asked, not letting his hands move from the man’s body. Tony’s demeanor suddenly changed, his brows furrowed with concern as he cocked his head to the side.
“Have I ever lied to you?” she asked. He smiled brightly before acting offended.
“I really am sorry about this, he’s drunk and well…I’d say he wasn’t usually this candid but then I’d be lying,” she said as she moved to smack the back of the brunette’s head.
“So how’s the latest terrorist holding up?” Sam asked, back turned to the super soldier.
"You're safe kiddo," he said after kissing the top of her head a few times. "Your Dad built precautions for such occasions years ago. Ask him later about how a six year old Peter almost fell over the balcony when Tony was supposed to be watching him," she laughed loudly at that, imagining what kind of lecturing the new dad would've gotten from his husband.
The bell finally rang, signally the end of her school day. Not that she necessarily didn’t like kindergarten, but she loved hanging out with her family more. Speaking of, she spotted her cousin Peter making his way down the steps with his friends until the two made eye contact. Then, they both took off, racing towards Happy and the waiting towncar - as they did everyday after school.
The rest of their vacation was incredibly relaxing, so much so that Steve had even calmed down a little to talk to Joey about what she did the first night they left.
“Yeah, definitely. Well, first, fuck those basic bitches. And just for…the record…how did your dads react when they found out about you getting jumped?”
,” Joey whined at the taller man, finger pointing at the shorter one.
“I’m sure Peter’s happy too,” his Dad quipped, “knowing you’re good with your hands.”
“They freaked out a little cause of the bruising,” Joey said as she self consciously rubbed her mostly healed wounds. Steve was better at his job than Joey gave him credit for. “But mostly they were cool. Except when they made me promise not to retaliate physically. I will probably eventually break that promise – since she is a certified cunt…”
“I didn’t say anything,” James said smugly, shrugging his stupid perfect shoulders.
“It’s silly.”
They must’ve heard him, because they all turned on their heels and pushed past each other to leave the store.
So he was actually thankful when May called him to ask if he could pick up Peter after school.
The women were rarely as willing to commit a crime, so she usually looked for older men that were easy targets.
“I’ll let you pick, stud muffin,” the brunette said as he came back into view with a box.
– when Jarvis informed him he was receiving a call from the high school Peter and Emerson attend. Offering a “thanks J” to the ceiling, the exhausted soldier picked up his phone, dreading whatever this was about.
“She was bad and she wasn’t there for you,” he said quietly, before hiding his face in Tony’s side.
“I’m leaving now to go get him,” Pop said as she walked by the pair, grabbing her keys. “Stevie I know I raised a pair of stubborn mule-headed Alphas, but even your brother knows when to ask for help. No shame asking the grandparents to help, you know we’re happy to.”
"Says the guy who just last night was -" Tony was interrupted by his daughter's hand to his mouth, laughing around her interruption.
“I’ve started boxing too, Buck. Give me a few more months and I’ll happily kick your ass,” Steve whispered as he pulled the cart along with him, eyes falling on his cereal.
“Shit, she’s right Tony, maybe we shouldn’t go after all…” the blonde started to say.
“Okay,” she said to the ceiling before turning back to the archer. “Thanks again, Clint. Maybe we could do this again sometime?”
, she also
He rounded the corner with Banner, holding two cup holders with four coffees each; while Bruce had bags in his arms – the smell of donuts and other baked goods wafting to the pair. Rhodey followed behind the two, holding a duffle bag – most likely filled with time wasting stuff for the group. Steve’s brow furrowed when he noticed Clint and Natasha weren’t with them.
He was appreciative for her truth and honesty. And she was right about something else; he wasn’t actually bisexual. It had just been a faze. Like being the Soldier.
He heard his daughter walking in just as the bacon started sizzling offering her a "good morning" and smiling when she only grumbled in response. She stood next to him watching him cook and offered a small smile at him.
Her Pop had reminded her a hundred times this morning to go to May’s after school. Also reassured her several times that the surgery was minor and he would be fine.
. Cause I just crumbled to the ground in pain. But apparently they’ve never been kicked in the crotch! I think she bruised my…” she did a weird hand-wave over the injured area, “pelvis? Crotchal region? Pop help me out here what’s the medical term for my broken vaginal area?”
“–Dr. Stephen Strange,” he answered, reading her mind yet again.
“That fast?” Emerson asked.
“Fair enough, but that doesn’t mean you have to be with someone who treats you-”
“Harley, you wanna pick the spot for our picnic?” Tony asked his pup, chuckling when the boy took off running and danced at a spot under a tree.
He wasn’t sure what he was expecting from Steve, maybe secretly joy? But his stomach sank when the blonde frowned.
It was about another hour until her father returned, and in that time the three kids woke up from their naps and - along with Tony - joined them in coloring in the living room. When she heard the elevator ding, she internally squealed before she grabbed her best piece of paper and ran to greet him.
Though she loathed clothing, it was still cold in their Brooklyn apartment. Luckily she was unconscious, so it was fairly easy to put her pajamas on. Afterwards, he laid her on the futon while he worked on the pillow-wall. She slept through it, and through being moved again when he finished. He stood for a moment looking at her, wondering how he should spend the next few hours before he would fall asleep…
“Just ignore him,” Tony said absently, eyes fixed on the machine before him as a screwdriver suddenly appeared in his hand.
Steve relished the laughter a moment longer before moving to help his son from being tickled to death.
“No, it’s just embarrassing, okay? I tripped at the cemetery and hurt my ribs by falling on a stupid tombstone,” she said, clutching her stomach a little.
“You don’t have friends. Just Steve,” the Suzie girl blatantly said in confusion, getting a bellowing laugh out of the blonde. Bucky turned to glare at him, so Clint pointed at the toddler in his hands.
“Uncle Rhodey what’d you bring us?” Peter asked excitedly, jumping up and down in front of his favorite uncle. Harley was already rifling through the bags, pulling out a stuffed narwhal.
He even blinked twice, another one of their signals to silently tell the other to act on whatever they were thinking. In this case, he gave his girl the go ahead to end one more life with her powers. The very thing he’d been discouraging her to do, now giving permission. And as she slowly turned to Strucker, Bucky sent a prayer that this would be the last time this child would have to do that.
No, she wouldn’t do that to them. She had plenty to be angry about tonight.
“Everything. I was about to walk into the kitchen when I heard him panicking. But then you came in and it felt like intruding…then it kinda felt like spying, hearing you guys…yell at each other.” Another day, he’d have a conversation with her about eavesdropping, but for now he just kept making the hot chocolate before placing a hot mug to the side of her.
“Another cheating scandal, Steven. Really?” Steve rolled his eyes and thought back to the last time this happened.
Steve smiled before responding. “Tony will pull through,” he repeated back to his friend.
“Sounds good, you stink.”
“Hi Ashley, whatcha doin in the closet?” he asked as he crawled in with her. “Are you okay?” he asked after taking a look at her scared face. “What’s the matter? Are you scared?” he asked as Steve moved in to begin to pull him out. Tony quickly reached an arm out to stop him, shaking his head when he looked back at him in confusion.
“I’ve done it before, just don’t give me a reason to do it again,” he said as he gently put the pillow back on the couch.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was skeptical, to say the least, every day leading up Saturday. He waited for Wade to tell him it was all a joke, preferably in quiet rather than doing something humiliating like telling him in front of the entire school. But he never did. Just offered small smiles in the hallway as they passed each other. He wasn’t even going to bother getting a tux until he was confronted about it by his new sister.
“Jesus, child,” James grunted out as he released him from the hug to escape the girl’s bony knees. Clint just laughed as he pulled the girl into his lap before tickling her.
“So...I’m probably putting my foot in my mouth, but weren’t you mad at me?” Tony asked cause he couldn’t keep his big mouth shut. It helped that he was currently lathering up strong muscle.
“-yeah, I got it,” Clint said in a clipped tone, hating himself for sounding childish. The front door opened and in walked a beautiful blonde in her thirties.
Steve frowned at that.
“Fine! Okay? This
So while the two teens wrestled over the glass case, things were kicked around and spilled. And then there was an explosion.
"Where's your boyfriend Petey?" Miles asked between yawns.

“I wouldn’t call finding my soulmate ‘stuck,’ Tony. Nor would I call all of my dreams for a family coming true as that either. I think I’d call that
“Absolutely, Daci. Anytime you wanna meet in the gym, just ask, okay?” She nodded with a warm smile before taking off towards the elevator. On the ride up, she suddenly felt the exhaustion seep into her bones as she let out a long yawn. She was starting to feel sleepy after all the fun she had with Clint. When she got off to their floor, she heard the sounds of her Tati in the kitchen.
“Are you thinking of something inappropriate?” Steve shot back with a furrowed brow.
But before he could reprimand her, Tony had made a noise when he had tried to sneak off a piece of garlic bread – alerting the blonde – who swatted at the man in disapproval.
“Daci feel free to pick out a toy that isn’t claimed yet,” Rhodey offered the girl, warming Tony’s heart at his generous friend.
"Oh, Miles, my sweet little brother. Do you know what those men were doing? The ones that Deadpool killed?" she asked gently as Miles shook his head no.
“That’s just because he has refined taste, peas are gross,” he countered, laughing along with her. “So did you call to find out about my newest beau?”
He sat on the edge of the bed while Tony remained standing and avoided looking at him. Steve was still patient, understanding whatever Tony was about to tell him would be hard.
“Jarvis,” she said “you and I both know their conversation will last
“He’s in timeout, just sit here with me a little longer.” He heard her hum happily.
“I’m not saying he shouldn’t, but I am saying it’s
“What is it?”
“I’ll call you later,” Steve whispered against his mouth before kissing him again. And a few more times until Tony returned the smile. Then Steve got up, finished getting dressed and smiled before heading back to his apartment.
“And you still got pregnant?”
“Stark!” he shouted, ignoring the glaring looks from the two startled men who proceeded to scramble off one another. “Daci’s gone and your AI doesn’t know how she left.”
STEVE
"Definitely best birthday ever," Steve said with a dopey grin, holding still as Tony continued drying him.
He heard the ding from the elevator as he moved to pour himself a cup of coffee, turning to smile as Rhodey entered the kitchen. The man smiled as he walked past him to pour himself a cup, remaining silent until he joined Tony on the other side of the kitchen island.
When Peter had been bitten by the spider, he was at Oscorp Industries and made it so his tracks weren’t able to be followed. So no one could link what happened back to him.
“Excuse you, they are at their Grandaddy’s. You have no say, Bambi,” his Dad said before sticking his tongue out, like the mature adult he was.
“You better get used to that,” Sarah said with a chuckle, wiggling her brows at the man as he glared at her while getting off the floor to sit in an actual chair.
Maybe they would kill him, put him out of his misery.
as the man watched the toddler start crying again.
“–she’s trying to apologize again, Jo.”
Cara had approached her during lunch to ask if they could hang out after school.
The blonde's response was just a bigger smile, which Bucky would spend the rest of his life keeping on that archer's handsome face.
“Of course! You know, if you think you’re ready then why not?” Steve added, hoping he sounded nonchalant.
“Yeah? Which one is your favorite? Mine is my Uncle Bruce! He’s the Hulk,” Peter chatted as the two moved out of the closet, Steve ignoring the scoff from his husband.
“What? But your crown, my liege?”
“What have we here?” Natasha asked with a smile, crossing her arms over her chest.
“I already told you it didn’t bother me Steve.” She folded her arms across her middle, confused and a little irritated at the implication.
“Cool. Daddy the router accidentally fell from the table and now the internet isn’t working.”
“Don’t lie,” Steve growled out, debating with himself whether he should throw that magazine away now or later. They settled into a comfortable silence, gazing out at their view of distant mountains until his husband spoke quietly.
Not long after he got to the station, Sam was knocking on the door to his office. He waved him in, noting he only opened the door enough to stick his head in.
"Um...yeah," she replied, looking over at Clint and noticing he had a weird look on his face. There was an awkward silence for a moment before Thor began pouring more drinks.
“Why are you lying to your boyfriend?” she outright asked, hands on her hips after she stopped directly in front of him.
Tony, finally taking pity on his poor husband, turned back to the teenagers.
“I think she’s a hoot,” Tony said, taking the plate from his husband, “you don’t seem entirely convinced?”
Steve stayed sitting a moment later, smiling back at the teen who had crawled back to curl up under her blanket. He helped adjust the pillows that Tony had messed up, rolling his eyes fondly at the man who had started reading the essays.
