He wasn’t so sure Howard Stark would be proud of the way things had turned out, for one thing. An adopted kid was less than ideal in his eyes, preventing the continuation of proper Stark blood. Not to mention the fact that Tony was openly attracted to men, and dating (well, used to date) his father’s favorite hero. But he doubted even Steve Rogers would have been able to turn Howard’s thinking into acceptance.
“Sorry, I have to go handle that,” Tony said, hurriedly excusing himself to chase after his daughter who was not supposed to be running off. She didn’t even look back as she ducked between a group of parents taking up the whole entryway talking, and Tony almost bowled someone over to get after her.
“I’ve given her Motrin,” Tony explained, trying to be patient. “And I understand it’s late. But you’re a pediatric doctor, aren’t you?”
Tony tapped his watch and the lights went out but for the soft blue glow of the skyscrapers outside.
But in a moment like this, Bucky wanted to taste that aftershave and drink in the warmth that Steve’s body always exuded. A comfortable warmth, like curling up in bed with a big stuffed animal.
Tony was settled on his chest, but he rolled off. They had learned long ago that Tony woke up with pain from his arc reactor if he slept like that.
He rushed off before Tony could say anything else to him, absently rubbing the backs of his fingers against his cheek, still startled by the fact that his beard was no longer there.
“Fine, you can stay. But you’re not sitting with me or Peter, or the Avengers. You are not ruining my wedding, Steve. And if you open your fucking mouth once during this ceremony—“
Steve had tried so hard to combat his depression. He went to so much therapy that his fucking superb SHIELD medical insurance wouldn’t cover the costs after a certain point. Daily meetings with his therapist, attempting pills everyone knew would have no effect, exercising more than usual to try and drive up his endorphins—and all of it had failed miserably until he moved to Maine.
Tony swore under his breath as oil started to stream like a bleeding wound from his hotrod. Thankfully, none of it landed on his face, though this car was doing plenty to piss him off already. He never even drove the thing, but that was because no matter what he did, it never seemed right. New engine, new brakes, new everything—it was still wrong. Tony tore it apart about once every year and replaced every fucking piece except for the body and not once had it ever looked right since he crashed his armor into it while on a bender. Fucking car.
There was a brief pause. “Uh, I’m not sure. I wanted to see if you and Jackson were available first, for the more recent stuff, you know?”
Tony was the same. He never seemed to age. Perfect skin, the intimate scent of that cologne he fucking loved. Tony fucking knew. Tony fucking knew he loved that cologne. And who wore cologne to the gym?
Their time together was spent in the evenings after he got off work at his new job: training incoming SHIELD agents. Or maybe they weren’t SHIELD now, he didn’t really care. Bucky was beginning to associate Steve with sleeping, which was becoming an issue because he really did want to talk to him. Steve hadn’t been around for three months, and now he was able to come over every day so long as he wasn’t called in for a mission.
Or maybe Tony had done it as some way of protecting him, though he had never actually been told where Steve was or what he was doing. Even in that last conversation, Steve had kept his mouth shut.
It helped that he hadn’t been present at any Avengers functions since he’d adopted Morgan. He was consulted on a few things, but kept them to video chat while he was tinkering in the lab and Morgan was doing her own tinkering in her pack-n-play. Mainly, she was devising ways to sneak out of the pack-n-play to grab his legs and nearly give him a heart attack.
Yet Steve had a hard time believing that Blaine was really okay with that. Killing for a good paycheck (a very good paycheck) wasn’t worth the mental baggage. There had to be something more. Nobody would be okay with just following orders unless there was some sort of goodness, some benefit. Blaine wouldn’t be okay with the alternative.
“Okay, that one was more Antarctica than it was Chile, and I don’t think it’s too crazy for me to be worried about my previously frozen solid boyfriend going to one of the coldest parts of Earth.”
And all Jackson had done was nod in a serious manner and repeat everything as he recorded Steve’s every request.
Jackson knew. He knew about Tony’s PTSD infected, depression ravaged ex husband. He probably knew about Steve’s ridiculously embarrassing fits too.
Boone headed off toward the door and Steve and Blaine grabbed their drinks and plates and headed toward the only vacant table in the mess hall. It was a worn wooden picnic table devoid of any carvings or graffiti. But a combat knife was stuck into one of the wood planks, glinting in the light and warning anyone in the vicinity to stay away.
Steve reluctantly moved away then, and Tony let go of him. He swung his feet to the floor and made his way to the bathroom on shaky legs. He started the shower, wondering just how long it would be until Tony disappeared again to go off with his lover. How many times a week they had this, when he’d been waiting over a year, and the Tony he was making love to was high as a kite.
‘Tony definitely regrets saying goodbye,” our source confessed. ‘Now that they’ve been working together again, it’s been getting harder and harder for him.’
The sound of waves made him smile and he veered right, ducking between trees to and breaching from the forest to meet the sun as it burst from beneath the horizon line of the Atlantic. Clouds loomed with red underbellies, but Steve continued on, unperturbed.
“And what about Steve?” Rhodey’s brow quirked. “Oh, right, you haven’t told him yet. That’s not important or anything.”
But damn if his heart didn’t go haywire when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He realized three things when it happened: 1) he had to change his Tony-specific vibration pattern, 2) Tony hadn’t texted him since their breakup and 3) Tony was texting him for the first time in a year.
Even as they agreed, Vision recalled that night. The night Wanda had slipped into Tony’s bedroom while he waited for Steve to return, the night Vision himself had helped her seal off Tony’s whole life from his body. How Tony hadn’t even felt it as he put away one of his fancy watches—or so Vision had told Wanda after taking her from the room when it was finished.
Steve had the sudden urge to flee, so powerful that he tensed. He had to leave, that was all he knew.
But Steve was better now. He could handle it. With time, it would go away. Somehow, he would make it go away.
“What did I do?” Steve asked quietly, wiping the tears from his face. His momentary weakness was ending, absorbed by the hard foundation he’d spent a year building up for himself when confronted with this pain. “I loved you—I don’t know what I did to make you not want to love me anymore.”
Peter stepped back, his brows pinned as he scanned Steve’s face, confused. “I…I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said—“
He could finally sell his wedding ring, he realized as he picked out shapes in the ceiling patterns above.  He could erase himself from this world in all but his being, and so long as he kept up the façade when people started feeling guilty and called him to make sure he hadn’t killed himself since last time, nobody would notice or care.  If he didn’t ask, Peter would never visit again, except maybe when his first child was bring and he and Mary Jane needed a break.
A buzz sounded from Peter’s pocket and he dug out his phone. “Dad’s here,” he explained. He grabbed his backpack and things, glancing at Steve a few times like he might just shatter. Steve just kept his smile, his eyes dry and his hands steady.
But he knew it wouldn’t do him any good. Peter would still hate him, and his granddaughter probably did too. Tony was dead and Captain America was gone. He was just a faceless, untraceable man with dying friends except for one, maybe two who would survive with him.
“Friday, Steve’s vitals, please,” Tony murmured under his breath as he waved goodbye as the elevator doors closed on Clint.
“Yes,” Morgan piped up, sensing the tension. She hopped at Tony’s side, silently asking to be lifted up. But he was frozen in place again, unable to move without fear of faltering.
Steve felt Peter’s eyes on him, but didn’t look up from his plate. Coming to this dinner had been a bad idea. Peter didn’t want him there, and he was making sure to drag Steve through the shattered glass of their relationship as much as he could.
His therapist had said it was a great idea. His therapist had encouraged him to come here. Bucky hadn’t even fought him for very long. Sam said he could get off work to hang out with him if he wanted someone at the wedding with him.
He thought of putting her in her crib, but there was always a chance she could get worse. If he fell asleep, how would he know? (Friday—but maybe she would malfunction!) He didn’t dare give her another dose of Motrin, and she was in no state to be asked to eat food.
“I don’t remember what day it was—but it was springtime. It was like a movie. Everything glowed—there was like some sort of cinematic dream effect on everything, or maybe that’s just how I remember it now. But I remember waking up, I remember looking over to see that you were already awake, all thoughtful and looking over a briefing or something. And I remember feeling nothing. But some kind of omnipresent nothing—a nothing that came with the expectation of something else. Like a fucked-up dream. Y’know, when the floodgates open and all that ooey-gooey warm fuzzy stuff is supposed to flow, except
Tony had no intention of changing anything about their state of being. Tony only wanted to go on a mission together. A stupid mission that was hardly worthy of the two leaders of the Avengers to tackle jointly. Not to mention it didn’t seem to have much of a chance of being successful if Special Forces hadn’t been able to take what they needed after two weeks of trying.
There was a beat of awkward silence as Steve stared at Mary Jane like a complete idiot. Obviously—with oh so painful of a revelation—he was clearly missing out on something very important.
Which was why it was getting harder and harder for him to see Steve becoming part of this family. He’d been away almost too long now, and Morgan had no idea who he was. If he started showing up all the time and taking his attention, he feared Morgan would feel left out, or like he didn’t love her more than the whole world.
Steve left the bookshelf and stepped on the dead man’s hand as he passed between Emory and Kissum. He only noticed when his boot slipped on the floor, the bottom slick with blood.
He realized he hadn’t spoken yet, but he wasn’t sure how. What could he possibly say? What was he supposed to feel?
Steve gave him a sour look, tipping his head back to try to stop the bleeding. His healing would have it over and done with in no time. “Spare me the lecture. I know where my center of gravity is, Blai—“
“Hmm, perfect peach ass. Somehow, I suspect I’m not alone in this.” To prove his point, Tony ran his hand over the curve of Steve’s right butt cheek, appreciating the peach-fuzz coating of hair there. “Yeah. Yeah, you’ve got 100% grade-A American peach right here, too.”
“I can only hypothesize, sir, but the creature does appear to share radiation signatures with Thor.”
Clint. That was Clint. Should’ve recognized the dog PJ bottoms. Tony blinked up and flinched when Clint took a literal step back.
“No. No, Steve! No!” Tony makes an exaggerated noise of betrayal as Steve tackles him to the floor, very deliberately smearing blue paint in a line down his shirt. He finishes it off by dotting Tony’s nose and then his cheek.
“Just go,” Tony says, and clings tighter to Steve. Fifteen grueling, miserable, icy miles later, they hit Northampton and Steve pulls into the first gas station he can find. They both trip inside, frozen and drenched, jeans and leathers clinging uncomfortably. The kid behind the counter takes one look at them and bursts out laughing, though he tries to hide it behind the magazine he’s reading.
Time slowed to a molasses crawl as he watched and waited. The digging mechanism had to be calibrated just so. Too much force might set off the bomb prematurely, and while the bot was built to withstand most of the explosives it would encounter, the goal was also to mitigate as much damage as possible to save on long-term costs. At last the bot pulled his dummy bomb and began sending back data.
Caught up in the fervent hush of Tony’s words, Steve felt his lips part in awe. Tony’s hope was so bright, his anguish so painfully open and evident, that Steve almost believed in this chance Tony wanted to give him. They stared at each other for many moments longer, the gravity between them almost overwhelming, until Tony at last drew a shuddering breath and ran an anxious hand through his hair.
With another frown, Tony goes about wedging the sheet metal into place. He can’t put any nails or screws in the walls to hold it down—apartment regulations—but a few more strips of tape are serviceable enough, and once he’s sure the metal won’t move, he backs it with a sheet of two-inch foam. “Just to keep the chill out,” he murmurs as he gets that taped down as well. Behind him, Steve is getting heavier and heavier, one hand glued to Tony’s chest and the other running up and down the front of his thigh.
“So I was hoping I could borrow some cleaning supplies and some food that is neither coffee nor doughnuts so that they think I’m actually taking care of my place and eating right.”
“Not quite. I’ll be in charge of…let’s call it interfacing. It’ll be my job to make your commands smoother, your movements faster. I’ll also be watching the systems on your six, where the helmet can’t turn or see.”
Was this what flying felt like? No. Tony had flown before. Flying wasn’t as soft as this. He cracked his eyes. When had they gotten to the bedroom? The bedside light was on, and in its soft orange halo, Steve was undressing, He glanced over and caught Tony watching. “Hey. Hey, you’re doing great. Just close your eyes for me. I’ll be there in a minute.”
“What should we do? I didn’t pack rain gear.” Steve says through the com, squinting at the sign he can just make out about a mile down the interstate.
He presents Tony with the “I love you” ticket and Tony’s vulnerable, beautiful smile spreads across his face.
“He still sounds like he’s speaking through a helium balloon,” Bucky groused, still looking on edge. He still had his weapon out. “You sure we’re safe here? This is Axis territory, and there have been bombings.”
He shook his head as he clambered slowly and awkwardly out of the car. Strange thoughts to be having. He supposed it had to do with facing his own death. He was sure Tony would do all he could to bolster the Iron Man armor, but in his heart of hearts, Steve knew where this mission was headed. He knew what a last-ditch effort looked like. After all, if Ross truly thought the Iron Man armor was still of use, he would’ve pulled it in on the Vietnam War a long time ago.
“Real mature, honey.” Wincing a little, Tony manages to clamber back to his feet and he pulls Steve up after him. They make their way into the bedroom like teenagers sneaking in after curfew and tumble onto the comforter in a gaggle of limbs. Once down, though, Steve doesn’t make any moves. He lays there on his stomach, arm right over the center of Tony’s chest, eyes on Tony’s face.
“I killed it,” Tony whispers, reaching out to touch a forlorn snowflake, but yanking his hand back at the last.
“Spoon’s swimming,” he muttered out loud and tried using both hands. Only Clint at his side managed to keep the mug of milk from becoming a disaster as it dropped away.
“Oh,” Tony says, frowning into his grease-stained hand. After a moment, he runs his fingers the length of his goatee and ends up staining his entire chin with a ring of black. “I thought I was being perfectly clear. Let me try again. My parents just called me to let me know they’re coming to Boston tonight and they’re going to drop by and give me an inspection. You know? As in check my living conditions. The ones I was just describing.”
He hears Tony behind him, a quick anxious shuffle at the entrance to the room they’ve converted into a studio/workroom. Tony’s things for inventing take up one half of the room, and Steve’s painting and sculpting supplies take up the other half. For a long moment, Tony is silent, and Steve knows he can see the violence on the canvas, the criss-crossing brush strokes that spread like branching lightning from the center.
Steve’s eyebrows hit his hairline and he turns back to Tony, who is looking with a great deal of interest at the tire well of the ambulance. “‘Little snafu’?” he asks, pulling Tony in closer still, so that he can only look at Steve’s face or his armpit. Tony elects armpit and buries his nose deep. “Infinitesimally small snafu,” he says into the jacket, voice deliberately muffled.
“Well, um, Bucky extended an invitation to do holiday stuff with his family. His mom’s Jewish and his dad’s Catholic, so you’d get a mix of stuff there. We could pick one or the other. Or there’s Sam. Or maybe Rhodey?”
Murphy strikes on the first pitch, but the second one sings, the sharp crack buzzing on Steve’s shitty speakers.
From the stoop, Mrs. Ortega cups her hands around her mouth and yells, “Alright everyone. You’re cleared to head back in. Tony, bambino, where you gonna stay?”
Tony’s hands were everywhere as he urged Steve backward into an antechamber where a steaming bathtub already waited. Steve tried to divest Tony of his clothes as well, but Tony caught his wrists and moved them behind his back, kissing and sucking at his neck as he steered him to the bath. “Need you,” Tony growled into Steve’s skin.
Steve stared out at the White House in the distance, body aching, exhaustion breathing through his rib-cage with each beat of his heart.
“Yeah!” Steve says, leaping to his feet and leaning in, remote clutched in hand. The right outfielder is sprinting for the backboards, and Tony can already see the trajectory. It all depends on how high the guy can jump. The two batters on base have already rounded home plate, and Murphy is flying like the devil’s on his heels. Even Bucky’s leaning forward now, elbows on his knees and face intent.
Luckily, Bucky landed quite close to Steve, but unluckily, they were both soaked to the bone. Unwilling to move through the inky early hours, Steve bundled them up against the gnarled bark of a tree under their nylon chutes to wait for gray dawn. He gathered Bucky close, his own body heat keeping him much warmer than normal men would be, and told himself to settle in for a few hours of sleep.
Frowning, Steve rises and heads toward the bathroom door. He’s just raised his hand to knock when Tony says, “Rhodey, please. I’m begging you. This weekend is going all wrong and now I forgot the ring. I forgot the ring, Rhodey and that’s kind of a necessary ingredient to a proposal. Please. I will do anything. Just bring me that fucking ring.”
“Somebody would’ve said something, I’m sure,” Steve murmurs. He's still smiling, but he puts his hands on Tony’s shoulders, kneading at them gently. “They wouldn’t have let you talk to them with a streak of grease all the way down your face.”
, Tony’s brain supplied, but he barely had any blood left flowing in that direction anyway, so he just let the thought waft away. Steve’s eyes grew heavy, his obscenely long eyelashes drifting down until they hooded the last of the azure blue, and Tony could see the movement of his jaw, the only indication that he’d licked his lips. Bereft of a visual, Tony’s brain supplied the rest. Steve’s mouth
“Steve,” Tony says, holding up his hands and drawing out the “e” of Steve’s name. “Babe. Blue Streak. Hey! That’s an even more apt nickname today. You know? ‘Cause you’ve got a blue streak. On your face.”
There was silence for a moment and when Peter’s voice came back on the line, it was cracked and strained. “Fine. Bye.”
“Sir, given Captain Rogers’ aversion to any public displays of affection, your handholding last night was quite enough to indicate the rekindling of your relationship in the eyes of the world.”
His therapist did not know he’d been sending a text every week for two months with a time and place. He never got a reply. He tried not to expect one. Steve was still figuring things out. Right now that involved not talking to him, looking at him, or making any kind of suggestion that he was even acknowledging Tony’s existence.
“I don’t know how—I don’t know how—but then it happens to you. Daddy’s daddy did it to him. My dad did it to me. I don’t think he even knew what he was doing. That’s ‘cause it’s evil, Peter. It’s evilness and it’s going to happen here if I don’t stop this right now.”
“Mary Jane is going on vacation with you? Does your dad know about that?” Steve asked, because being the stern parent was the only fuse within him that was functioning right now.
Tony nodded slowly, his stomach knotting. He knew he should just tell Steve now, but he knew he wouldn’t.
Blaine shot him a look, the cap still in his mouth, and nodded. The moonlight turned his light hair silver and his skin a strange color of blue.  He spat out the cap and checked the needle one more time.
Wanda didn’t seem convinced. She balled the energy in her palm before sending it into the air to burst in a tiny firework.
Tony made a small noise, and Steve’s gaze turned to him to make sure he wasn’t waking up. Tony had taken a serious hit when they crashed, and he hadn’t been wearing the suit. Friday had made sure to inform him that Tony was going to be fine, but that he needed rest and hydration.
Like Steve hadn’t been through hundreds of nights alone without a husband, thinking it was something wrong about him that caused Tony to never want to be around.
. The Army didn’t claim them in any paperwork, and they had no commanding officer documented anywhere. They also didn’t have to follow Army regulations: beards and stubble were commonplace, as was civilian clothing around base, and no one ever had the safety on when they walked around with their weapons.
Steve’s lips twitched into a smile. “Well, Clint wanted to clear it with you first. That’s a good thing, means he really believes it.”
Tony let out a sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I…Sorry, Steve,” he said, as though he were reading off a card.  I just thought…I don’t know what I thought. I’m sorry. It’s fine if you’re here, you just caught me off guard.”
“It only takes one sighting. Or one creak of the gate for the other people in the street to know he has visitors. This house is way too easy to access.”
Jackson looked around the room. If he was disappointed, he didn’t show it. In fact, he smiled and looked somehow more relaxed. “Look at this place. I love it.”
Steve took a breath. “Yup. So, I just wanted to let you know. I’m about to head out to meet Peter for dinner, so I gotta go. Take good care of my dogs, yeah?”
“It is pretty convenient in times like this,” Steve said dryly, slinging his rifle up onto the log. “Do we have an EVAC?”
Tony hugged him a little tighter. “You know that’s not true. You haven’t lost anyone yet. You’ve still got me. You’ve got Terminator—and he was definitely supposed to be dead—and you’ve got Sam, the Avengers, and you got to say goodbye to Peggy in the best way. No dramatic plane crashes involved. And you still have Peter. Always.”
The boat was silent aside from the shuffling of boost as another wave rocked them hard. The Major scanned his men, never lingering too long on one or another. He was a good officer, a good leader.
One date. A date wouldn’t get him fried. Tony had already been caught with a supermodel just a few weeks ago. Ben didn’t even know who he was.
Steve dared to settle closer, arms crossed under his chin. This moment would end, and he knew it, but…he’d make it last as long as he could. Just to have something close to normalcy for just a moment, even though he knew it never would be the same.
She beamed at him before wiggling an eyebrow at Steve as she walked off. Everyone loved Steve. He was too perfect not to. But there was only one person Steve had chosen to be with, and that was him.
Steve knew he would hate himself for this decision—he could already feel the self-loathing curdling his blood and squeezing his bones, but he had to do one more selfish act for one more selfish reason. Before the numbness wore off and he needed another injection to keep him sane for the night. Before that injection could make him feel like he needed to be somewhere he wasn’t wanted.
All four dogs immediately ran for the porch to sit in front of the steps, watching the new arrivals with tongues lolling out of their mouths.
“Doesn’t feel like enough, hm.” It never did. Steve remembered how anxious he’d always been before Tony left on a big trip (with reason – Tony liked to pack everything last minute and often forgot important things like his toothbrush and clothes), but Tony seldom had the same worries about him. Steve always had his bags packed, and he never forgot anything. Tony had stopped asking.
“Stop talkin’ like that, Steve,” Bucky said with a bit of a quiver in his voice. “You got us, remember? You’ve got me and Sam, your new Army pals back in whereverthefuck, Natasha, Barton, Banner, the Thor guy—all of us.”
There had to be another explanation. Iron Man had never been to Aspen—that Steve knew of, anyway. So he didn’t understand how a helmet would have ended up there. He’d been the one to pack everything and move them here, and he certainly hadn’t seen it then.
“Tony, great to meet you,” the woman said with a bright smile. “I’m Mrs. Freeman. I taught this session and had a lovely time working with Miss Morgan here.”
“Your kid’s a real prick,” Blaine muttered, tossing the invitation onto the table beneath the window.
“I agree with Steve,” Tony said after a moment. “I don’t like the idea of staying in the city. Farmland is close enough, we can land and take up residence without anyone seeing if we use the cloaking tech on the quinjet.”
“Forget it.” He waved a hand dismissively. “It’s nothing. I’m just making it out to be more than what it is.”
Steve always acted different when they were around anything related to the military, Bucky had noticed. His spine straightened out as he walked, his steps became more deliberate, and god forbid he flash a smile. Steve had never been in Special Forces. He had only ever been an infantryman. Steve didn’t know the way things worked for the best of the best, though he was one. Black ops hadn’t really existed in their war, not on the physical battlefield. The Howlers had been the closest thing to it, but they still had a list of rules to follow, an affiliation with three militaries, and someone they had to listen to.
“Yeah, it was,” Tony whispered. His face was nothing but hard shades of blue, ranging from deep navy to a soft cerulean in the moonlight. “You won’t lose me, Steve.”
Peter let out a little snort, frustrated by Tony’s silence. “And it’s true, you know. He always brings everything back to what he wants to do.”
Her red pumps clacked on the floor (which was a blue resin made to look like calm seawater) as she walked down the exhibit hall. Tony led Morgan forward, and she gradually regained the confidence not to hang onto his leg as they followed.
Yes, Peter would be bursting with pride and satisfaction if he knew that his once-father was going to spend centuries buried in the bones of old friends and wearing the rotting flesh of a man unable to admit he had made a mistake.
He could see it in Steve’s eyes sometimes. The want. The pull to come back, to remember what it was like in a world where he had been completely cherished.
to become a sorry sack of shit and I’m not going to let you poison my wife and my family—including Dad and Jackson—with your moping and manipulation.”
A silence settled over them all as Steve turned his focus to the fizzing alcohol in his glass, and it was only after Tony nudged him with his knee under the table that he realized he was supposed to say something.
A pair of yowls made Steve look up from washing his hands and head toward the door. He wiped his hands on his jeans, and leaned in the doorway as two sports cars growled into view.
With no usable intel, they had to move on. There wasn’t much of a risk for additional enemy personnel, but they had a cleanup crew en route already and they had to get the hostage checked out.
But Peter blocked Tony from going after him and Steve quickly made his exit before he could hear the lashing Tony was about to give that Peter didn’t deserve. Peter had just told the truth when no one else would. It wasn’t his fault. All of his anger was warranted—Peter had seen through the bullshit he had been hiding behind ever since divorcing Tony Stark.
She’d only been with him a week when Steve’s letter arrived, and stepping into fatherhood cold was a lot more stressful than he’d anticipated, even though he’d spent the previous month reading every book he could get his hands on and watching about fifty thousand YouTube videos with tips and tricks for everything from eating vegetables to stitching up ripped teddy bears.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice turned serious. “I don’t really want to fake a relationship for the sake of public image.”
“What, something on my face?” He grinned, then plopped a little spot of red on Morgan’s round little nose.
Steve cracked a grin, tears welling in his eyes as he ran across the room, scooping Tony up in his arms.
He tossed the blanket to Tony, where it landed with a gentle thump on his chest. Steve would not lower himself to tucking Tony in like a child.
Something had just happened in that coffee shop, and Steve somehow knew that he and Tony were going to be different now. He had never once brought up Bucky before, not even when most of the Avengers were sure something had to be going on.
“You’re an ass.” Rhodey pulled out his seat and sat down. “But you never show up out of the blue. Something wrong?”
Warm hands slipped under his shirt and Steve could only grin before he met Tony’s lips for a long kiss.
Her polite smile returned. “Of course not, Steve. We’re just busy. Not as busy as your wedding, but still very busy. I’ll take your gift.”
Tony Stark appears to be having second thoughts about letting go of longtime boyfriend, Steve Rogers.
“You’re one stupid fuck,” Blaine muttered as he pulled a needle through Steve’s skin. “Next time you decide to fix a fence, you get wire cutters and a fucking ladder first.”
“Wanna say hello?” Tony called, because he loved the idea of being shot in the face by a random scumbag.
“But if Daddy ever, ever hurts you, Uncle Jarvis is going to call me. Do you hear me, Peter? Uncle Jarvis will call me and I will not let him hurt you ever, ever.”
“Coming,” Tony murmured distractedly in a way that meant he definitely wasn’t leaving his work anytime soon.
So that was why she sat next to him. Because everyone thought he was here to ruin Tony’s wedding. To stand up and make some stupid claim that he still loved Tony, like a goddamn romance movie.
Maybe that was why Steve sometimes wished he loved him. Because if he loved Bucky, then he would never have to fear ending up in the life he was currently living.
“I…you know. I just didn’t think it would be right for me to be at the reception,” Steve said with a forced chuckle. “But I saw you and MJ. She looked beautiful, and you were very handsome.”
It took every ounce of willpower not to blow up at her in that moment. Tony let out a frustrated huff, hands balling to fists at his sides. This was supposed to be fixed. The past few months were supposed to have smoothed out all of the rough edges, to have made everything good again.
Tony was angry at himself for not having a fake boyfriend sooner. Being able to go out to dinner with someone who didn’t want to talk about business was a welcome relief. Steve made it even better by also avoiding his personal life. They went to movies and ballets and anything else date-like Tony could think of where media might be present. Everyone ate it up.
Blaine took a long sip of his beer from where he leaned on the terrace wall beside Steve, scanning the rooftops.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked. “Because what I’ve just seen in the last hour kinda makes me think maybe there’s a lot that hasn’t been cleared up.”
Really, ever since he’d been sixteen, aging had scared him. There wasn’t enough time in one measly mortal life to finish all that needed done. All that needed fixed.
“It’s okay, Petey,” he murmured into the soft fuzz on Peter’s head. “Papa’s right here. Papa’s got you. Papa’s got you.”
Steve had never even imagined Tony with children. Not beyond an occasional daydream of what life might look like if they stayed together. Tony was good with kids, but he’d always seemed so against having his own. Then again, they’d only discussed it briefly, and that was many years ago.
. It was rocky, to say the least. They didn’t trust each other as fully as they should, and it showed.
“You still need to call that interior decorator, Steve,” Tony said, patting him on the shoulder as he walked by. “But the view is fantastic.”
Tony offered a little salute, and Steve stepped into the portal, enveloped in a churning rainbow of color and light. He was weightless for only a moment, and then surrounded with roaring noise.
They co-owned Stark Industries now, and it was only a matter of time before Peter was married to Mary Jane and a new little Stark was on the way.
He looked around, analyzing the space for suspicious movement, but the noise of the club was too much like the booming of gunfire.
None of this was fair to poor Jackson. He was so nice, and so welcoming. Yet he was going to live the rest of his life with Tony Stark, who had offered to end it all for a chance with his ex-husband.
“I want you now,” Tony said quietly. “And I know that’s a big ask, but I do want you to stay with me. With Morgan.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “Well, I’m sorry it hurts you, Steve, but I’m not hurting Jackson just to spare you some hard feelings.”
His son ignored him and his ex husband thought he was a horrible father, but Steve would take that over becoming an abuser any day.
“You took half a year of time,” Tony growled. “You barely spoke to me. I had no indication that you even liked me anymore. You just vanished from my life.”
“Stark!” Thor boomed, startling several of the children. He carefully untangled himself from the crowd of kids, except for Morgan, who raced up to Tony with a piece of construction paper in her hand.
Thank God Peter was actually Tony’s son. Tony’s lawyers had lunged, sticking Candice with so many legal threats and talk of repayment for all that he and Tony had invested in her that Candice had no choice but to hand her—
Steve had so much to catch up on when he came home. Tony feared that it would feel insurmountable. It was hard enough for him to come home after a weekend away and he saw her every day. Morgan grew so much in so little time.
“Oh, you mean recognize you,” Steve said, drawing the blade over his jaw another time, just to make sure he hadn’t missed any spots.
With a quiet sigh, Steve finally stood, sleepily rubbing his eyes. His phone buzzed again, and he saw Tony’s name flash across the screen. Of course.
“My ex husband died last month,” Steve said quietly. “Just got word. He sent me this.” He glanced at the letter. “Read it.”
“I’m so happy you came,” Mary Jane said, pulling back and wiping her eyes with a finger. “Peter said you didn’t know if you were going to make it, but it means so much to me that you’re here.”
Tony looked around, as though something may have appeared in the room he hadn’t noticed before. Steve waited, heart in his throat. Tony must have really thought he was an idiot to believe this was the way Tony’s room had always been, that nothing had changed, that there was no evidence of a woman sleeping here.
Two shadows appeared in the archway between the bar and the terrace and both Blaine and Steve looked over. Steve’s hand flew to where his rifle was usually resting, and inwardly panicked when it wasn’t there.
But he had to know where the hell Steve had gone, or if he was even gone at all. The new number Bucky had given Peter was so wrought with encryptions that Tony had spent the last four hours fussing with it and still hadn’t gotten even halfway through.
Morgan loved to look at his creations. DUM-E was her favorite, since he liked to dance with her and show her things. Tony always had to watch, though, because sometimes DUM-E tried to hand her things he shouldn’t. Like glow sticks. Where he’d found glow sticks, Tony didn’t know.
“So can I hang up then?” Steve asked, but the silence afterward was delicate, like he regretted saying it.
When everyone started to leave, Mary Jane walked right over to him with a teary smile and pulled him into a tight hug, resting her cheek on his chest.
Steve couldn’t help but let out a little smirk at that, because he remembered that moment well; Tony’s wide eyes and quick breaths, freaking out with an infant Peter in his arms.
There was movement, and Steve closed his eyes until he could feel cool liquid running into his vein.
He would kill Tony Stark if he heard even a rumor Peter being harmed by him. He wouldn’t even hesitate. Not for a second. He had no forgiveness for parents who hurt their children.
“And soon, my mommy and daddy were really fighting. Like Daddy and me with the monsters on TV. And that’s what’s going to happen if I stay, Petey. I know it will.” His voice cracked, and emotion gushed from the open wound.
Steve didn’t have a sweetheart during the war (and Peggy couldn’t really be considered his sweetheart, as much as he had wanted her to be at the time), but the stories at mail call were endless.
Morgan’s art class consisted more of spilled and splattered paint than actual art, but she loved it like nothing else. Several of her finger paint drawings already littered the fridge and she’d only started the class a week before. Dr. Roberts said it was a good thing to enroll her in an art class to let her express herself.
Instead, he had just ducked, and he had gotten a perfect view of a .50 bullet cleaving half of Blaine’s face away.
Peter whimpered against his chest, his tiny, peach-fuzz brows creased in concern as his conscious fought to wake him. Steve had him tucked into a ridiculously oversized sweatshirt, both of them sharing the collar.
Peter threw his bag in the trunk and hopped into the passenger seat before giving a wave of his own and a tiny smile.
“The night of the party,” Thor explained. “I had just returned from Asgard. Seeing how miserable you both were, I brought back an elvish potion. One derivative of the Aether.”
But Tony had warned Steve that she did have rights. Even though the surrogacy agreement had been meticulously planned, Peter was still her child. Tony would most likely win in court with his lawyers, but there was a chance he wouldn’t. A chance Peter could be taken away from them if his mother wanted him back.
“Yes, um. I mean—nothing’s wrong. It’s—yeah, it is three, huh.” He cradled Morgan’s little head in his hand, already bigger than when she’d arrived in his life just a few months ago.
Tony shook his head. “God—no, no, nothing like that. Entirely personal. A personal project.  The public has to support me.”
Tony shrugged on his jacket and pulled his sunglasses from his pocket. It was dark outside, but it was one habit he wouldn’t break from his days of drugs and drinking.
“Couldn’t keep my eyes open,” Tony said once he was done yawning. “Figured I’d come up here and drag you off to bed if you weren’t already there.”
Captain America would be gone without a trace, literally. No survivor to carry on the Rogers family name, the awful genes.
. That happiness was behind something he could not touch. That happiness was a presence that he couldn’t even see anymore, but yet he knew the way it felt. He had those aching memories.
People had spat on him in public. People who didn’t even know him. A woman yelled at him for five minutes on the subway for being a horrible role model for her children. Old people shook their heads at him as though it was still 1942 and getting a divorce was the equivalent of marrying Satan himself.
There was a hollow clinking sound beside him as a Lieutenant flicked his Zippo and lit up. Steve found himself wishing cigarettes worked on him. He sometimes ached for that calming of nerves that the other guys got. Bucky smoked a pack or two a week now, and he was on the lighter side.
“Right, wasn’t like I was invited to dinner with the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force or anything!”
The last sentence spilled from his mouth unplanned, and he closed his eyes with a quiet, sad sigh. He was a horrible father. A horrible person.
“Night, Barnes.” The car doors descended and clicked shut. Tony glanced out the window to see if maybe he could discern some kind of meaning in Bucky’s figure, but he was already gone. So he put the car in drive and floored it for home, wondering just how he’d come to a place where he was being even remotely cordial to Bucky fucking Barnes.
Gone were the hard lines of Tony’s modern style. The edge of his custom half circle couch had once been made to look like slate, but was now shaved and smooth with rounded edges and no corners. The glass coffee table had been replaced with one made of wood, and the raised floor had been coated in some kind of rubbery material that made it look the same at first, but was most certainly not the rock it had once been.
“He warned us this might happen,” Vision said quietly. “We have to stay the course. For the betterment of both of them.”
It was the same reason he hurried to get to the training center before nine. Before Tony showed up to throw a few punches with Happy. Accidental. It wasn’t like Steve knew for sure that Tony was going to be there. Yes, he often showed up between nine and ten, but it wasn’t like Steve went to work out just to see if he showed up.
Bucky Barnes, probably the only guy on the planet that hated him as much as Hammer, but hadn’t yet tried to kill him. Emphasis on the “yet.”
“Or you’ve dumped me,” Steve replied with a grin, taking Tony’s hand and pulling himself up. He paused for a moment, squinting a little. “You’re taller than him. Just a little bit.”
In reality, he had been shoving, breathing hard, and swearing every time someone knocked into his rifle. His eyes were narrowed, his lips curled to a snarl, and at one point he was jammed in so tight that his feet weren’t touching the ground. He had to get to the front of the pack so they wouldn’t slow him down.
Bucky shook his head with a little smile. “Stop it, Rogers.” He leaned back, folding his arms behind his head. “Got a little carried away ‘s all. But I do want that soup.”
An explosion rocked the earth beneath them and Steve shut his eyes as the sky above turned a bright orange over Blaine’s shoulder.
“No, Pops, it’s not—“ Peter let out a huff. “You can come visit at the penthouse whenever you want. Dad said you could.”
Well, at least they weren’t going to pretend to like each other. Tony had to commend the guy for his blunt honestly. “Yeah, well, I can’t reach Steve.”
Peter sighed. “He lives out in the middle of nowhere. Never calls me or talks to me or anything. And it’s not just me—nobody’s heard from him for years.”
The tabloid articles scrolled through the hologram screen, all plastered with the same picture of Steve holding Tony’s hand, both of them hurrying into a waiting Escalade. They even held hands getting into the car. So yes, it was a bit incriminating.
Tony had. Tony had moved on. His “love” had been weaker. Maybe Steve had been right all along, and Tony’s love had faded away. Only after divorce had Tony talked about loving him the whole time—and only when he was lonely.
The coffee joint at the compound was staffed by a Stark robot, and occasionally by new recruits serving a disciplinary sentence. Dealing with coffee orders was evidently enough of a threat that they seldom saw a human face behind the counter.
“I don’t give a flyin’ fuck what you do and don’t know, Stark. I said it’s nothin’ to worry about, so shut up about it. Ain’t like you or
“What, I don’t get to greet the happy couple?” he asked jokingly. She knew full well it wasn’t a joke.
Steve shook his head. “I lost the version of you I wanted, Tones. I lost the person who loved me and comforted me and
Steve had been hurt many times in his life, used even. And Tony had warned him, to be fair. But this was something else. Tony was a liar like Steve had never seen. She’d been here the whole time.
God, he hoped he hadn’t missed something. Maybe kids had made fun of Morgan when she hadn’t shown up, or if they heard her father hadn’t been there.
But worse than that was the parasite in his gut that gnawed at his insides whenever he thought about spending the rest of his life absolutely and utterly alone with no hope of ever finding love again.
Tony read the letter over a hundred times in the first week, and he never overestimated anything. Or underestimated, for that matter. Steve had been gone for months, and despite this not being the first time Steve had to be away, this time felt worse somehow. Guilt was a heavy weight in Tony’s chest, and he couldn’t go a solid minute without imagining all of the ways Steve was going to come after him when he got home. Some ranged from cold indifference, other nights he woke up in a cold sweat after a nightmare that Steve Rogers might come try to kill him. The worst was that those nightmares were based on factual memory. He knew what it looked like when Steve Rogers had bloodlust in his eyes, his vibranium shield a circular razorblade above his head.
“Sure was when you got shot last time,” Bucky muttered. “And now the whole world knows about you two, so. Just be safe.”
Where normally the place looked like your typical posh school for socialite children, it was set up today with modern furniture, bright lighting, and spotlights on ornately framed children’s drawings. The atmosphere was cheery, and warmer than Tony had expected, and almost no one looked like they particularly cared if he was there or not.
It would do no good to tell him, as much as Steve liked to think it would. Telling people that his issues all stemmed from the family that thought he was a selfish, uninterested twat just made them say stupid things like ‘I’m sorry’ and feel bad. The last thing he needed was Blaine feeling bad for him.
The door flew open and Steve slapped a hand over his face to try and somehow hide himself from…Tony. No, no, no. No, no, no,
Steve smiled, crouching to finally pull off his boots. In a matter of seconds he was crawling into bed after Tony, carefully avoiding touching him despite the small size of the mattress.
“You can’t talk. How much is that suit you’re wearing right now?” Tony countered, knocking Jackson fondly with his shoulder.
And Steve had given him so much to be careful of. He couldn’t help it. He couldn’t help that he was so self-conscious and uncomfortable whenever Tony—a not-single Tony—was around.
With that, Peter darted down the stairs in the wash of the yellow porch light of Steve’s apartment complex.
“Uh-huh.” He tugged the brim of her hat down to cover her eyes.  She gave a little shriek of laughter and pushed it back up again, jumping to her feet.
Cheering erupted before Steve could even process that Happy had started speaking again, and when he looked up, Tony had his arms around Jackson, kissing him wholeheartedly.
Steve finally looked away from the bedroom and followed Tony into the elevator. Their close friends already knew about the engagement, but it was still exciting to announce it to the world. And seeing Tony so ready was as comforting as it was encouraging. The past few years had done wonders for their relationship.
Steve didn’t let his gaze linger as he headed out, slipping past Tony and back into the living room. This was not the homecoming he had wanted. His gut was churning, his head spinning, and his heart didn’t know whether to break or turn to mush in his chest, so all it did was hurt.
Steve immediately dug around in his pocket and fished out his phone. He called Tony, but the call immediately failed. When he pulled his phone away from his ear, he noticed that he had no service or internet.
“Steve, just stay for a drink,” Tony said in a false-casual voice. “You’re freaking out about the invitation thing. Don’t. We’re all good.”
“You wish,” Tony shot back. He patted Steve on the shoulder as he passed. “On second thought, I’ll pass on the coffee. Let’s see how this goes, and what to do.”
“Are you admitting to poisoning us?” From what Tony recalled, the Aether had almost killed Thor’s ex-girlfriend. Hell, maybe Thor had poisoned her too.
Steve frowned, stepping forward to rest a hand on Tony’s arm. “I meant what I said earlier though, you don’t have to tell me.”
“I’m swooning,” Tony growled, snaking his arms around Steve’s waist. They felt bony and stiff compared to what Steve remembered. Constricting. “You’re right, babe. We always win when we’re together.”
Tony shook her hand and smiled on reflex, but it didn’t reach his eyes. His heart was in his stomach, and the room would start to spin soon if he didn’t get some answers.
He told himself that Steve Rogers was no coward. If Steve had any interest at all, Bucky was going to pick up on it, but he hadn’t. The only thing different about Steve when it came to him was that Steve was more physical with him. Touching was almost constant, which was great, but not so great when Bucky realized it was probably because Steve thought he was gonna bolt or die or something.
Her tone reminded him of his third dissertation. He’d been too drunk to remember much of that one, but this all sounded sickeningly familiar.
Steve looked at him, blinking in surprise. “Uh, yeah, actually. But it wasn’t like I felt controlled all the time. I wanted to be with you and spend time with you. But you did like to know everything that was going on with me, and you really didn’t like when I wasn’t here.”
Even as Tony sank to his knees on the plush bathroom rug outside the shower, eyes dusky, Steve knew he was a means to an end. He was a way to keep the high going, a way to fully experience it.
Clint glanced around for a moment, as if anyone other than fellow Avengers even had clearance for the Avengers-only floor. “It’s a Class 7.”
“I know,” Steve said almost indignantly, but he couldn’t deny the little bit of hurt that leaked out. Tony wanted him to stay before, even if he hadn’t said it. “But what if he doesn’t?”
Not-Tony laughed, and it made Steve jump to hear such a familiar sound from someone he didn’t know at all. His chest twinged, and the worry in his gut started to gnaw there. He wanted to be back in his apartment, he wanted to call—
Steve couldn’t help but clench his fists when he saw him. Tony looked like he had recovered from whatever emotion he’d faced earlier, and he rolled his seat closer to be at Steve’s side this time.
Each morning started with a grueling run that went only about ten miles, but it was a race. Every single morning, the five of them battled so see who was going to win. Steve didn’t always win, either, which would have made Sam unbelievably happy if he were allowed to know what Steve was doing.
Steve started pulling off his tourniquet. “If he really doesn’t want me at the wedding, I won’t go. But I want to be there to support him. I don’t want him thinking I’ve abandoned him. That’s what Tony thinks.”
He knew Candice had a legal right to her baby, but Steve wasn’t sure what he would do if she took Peter. Probably something bad.  Nobody was going to touch his son. If Candice tried to take him and raise him, Steve was pretty sure he would kidnap him and take him back. He didn’t care if it was illegal. Peter was his son.
Tony still didn’t see why this concerned him. “Okay, Class 7 mission for Steve. Why are we talking about this if you’re not inviting me again?”
“Steve!” He heard a mottled scream, and then there were icy hands at his face, pulling him from the sight of that still-burning hand, those pudgy fingers curling, thinner and thinner.
It was impossible to ignore the last texts they’d sent, and Steve figured Tony must have given them a long look before sending his message.
“Was gonna surprise you,” Steve says, and he looks so put out, especially when a lily splats right on his cheek. Tony laughs and kisses him, the flower petals catching between their lips
“Stark was doing some recon on the border looking into some myth or legend or other. Horsehockey. Fury wouldn’t tell me the specifics, and I don’t really give a damn, truth be told. Stark’s always looking into loony Nazi mumbo-jumbo, so whatever it is, as far as I’m concerned, it's a waste of resources. But he’s one of the best inventors we have, and we can’t just let him fall into Nazi hands, or worse, the Soviets’.”
“But the bartender didn’t say anything. The checkout lady at the pharmacy didn’t say anything. No one’s been staring. Oh…wait…”
Steve hums and slurps at his chowder. It’s weirdly sweet and savory at the same time, the meat of the clam tinting the cream with something wild and oceanic. The heat goes straight to his chest and he sighs in contentment. “Well,” he says thoughtfully, “we’ve got time to kill. Why don’t you tell me what all plans you had in Vermont? I still can’t believe you wanted to go there.”
The day of, Tony has fifty bouquets of flowers delivered—thick clusters of red and orange roses, sunflowers, sweet peas, tulips, yellow irises and gladiolas. Their bedroom smells like a greenhouse, but Tony hopes Steve appreciates the effort Tony took hauling up bouquet after bouquet and arranging them over the furniture and floor. Interspersed with the flowers are candles tall and short, fat and tapered, unscented and flickering in the draft of the tower climate control. On the tiny table near the floor to ceiling windows, Tony hires a chef to serve out Steve’s favorite foods. There’s pad thai and sushi, enchiladas and corned beef, little baby bell peppers and corn on the cob. It’s a weird spread, but Tony wants Steve to have what he likes best and the man eats like a horse, so it’s not like the food will go to waste.
But then Bucky’s voice, wavering, agonized. “Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie, et dimitte nobis debita nostra, , sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris, et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo.” By the end of the prayer, Bucky’s voice was barely more than a whisper, so Steve reached for the doxology.
“Pater noster, qui es in cœlis, sanctificatur nomen tuum, Adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas tua, sicut in cœlo, et in terra.” Tony hissed, as did the others. They shrank back, twisting, writhing, fangs bared and claws turned skyward.
“Thor kind of spoiled the surprise. I uh…I …” Steve gulps hugely and then drops to one knee and Tony’s world tilts sideways. Steve’s digging in the pocket of his leather jacket, and Tony can almost see the embarrassment steaming off of him. And there’s a ring,
Tony’s eyes go wide and his cheeks go pink, but Steve’s already turning back to the laundry room, studying it with a critical eye. “First thing’s first. Let’s get this mess cleaned up. I’m gonna run up to my place and get a mop and some towels. Maybe a bucket. You…you know mechanics. Get the machines shut down. Completely powered off. I don’t care how you do it so long as you don’t break ‘em.”
Tony looks over the window with a critical eye, nods to himself, and then turns in Steve’s arms. “Okay, Blue Streak. Let’s get to you.”
“I…yes. Date. Nice date. I’m paying. Let’s…details. After.” Tony’s phone starts vibrating across the table and he jumps a little, eyes darting back. “Parents. Shower. Thank you! Bye!”
“Oh, Steve, darling. You honor me.” As though to reward him, Tony gripped Steve’s cock and started up a sweet, torturous rhythm. “You’re so beautiful. We’ll have dinner, but first, let’s take care of you, hmm?”
“Oh, Tony,” he whispered, his hands on Tony’s cheeks, loving, cherishing, still wet from lube and saliva. The very thought sent Tony reeling and he arched up into the heat of Steve’s body, yearning for more, deeper, harder,
With fingers stiff and swollen from hours at the computer, Tony slowly peeled away his T-shirt and fumbled his way through his jeans’ button and zipper, shuffling out of the denim rather than pushing it away. He was afraid to bend over, what with the way his head was swimming.
Wibbly again, and now so near sleep, Steve has to blink away the tears before he answers, “I love it.” He glances up at Tony’s hesitant face. “In fact, I love it so much I’m going to cash this one in right now.”
Hoofing over wet, unfamiliar, unbroken forest took them most of the day, but toward the afternoon, they suddenly broke through the tree line into what was very clearly a tilled field. Blessed civilization, which meant road, dry shelter, and the start of their real hunt. At the farmhouse a few acres away, Steve sent Bucky to the door. He was loathe to do it, but Bucky’s German accent was better than Steve’s, and it was important they not draw attention to themselves. There was a chance the inhabitants wouldn’t speak German, but they’d at least know the shape of it and make their own assumptions about two strange men, one of whom was the epitome of Hitler’s blasphemous Aryan ideal, traipsing through the countryside and asking after a mysterious American. While Bucky spoke to the farmer, Steve did his best to look hard and imposing, standing several feet away with his hands tightly knit behind his back and a scowl on his face. A few Reichsmarks passed from Bucky’s hand to the farmer’s before he turned away and gestured sharply to Steve, leading them toward the barn next to the house.
The bot finished the last of the disarmament protocol and swept its camera again, asking Tony for permission to return. He glanced at the clock. Hour-and-a-half to deadline. Beautiful. With a flick of his wrist, he typed in the commands for return, charging and self-diagnostic. It would be enough. It had to be. Tony needed it to be because he’d been awake…slowly he blinked at the clock and tried to focus. The numbers blurred in and out before sharpening, and he sucked at his teeth. He’d been awake way too long, that’s what he’d been.
He’s distantly aware of Steve saying “Tony?” his voice laced with confusion and the remains of his own shock.
“Tony, you…” Steve can’t laugh. He can’t. He needs to hold it in for Tony’s sake. Just a gentle smile and a quiet whisper in his ear to let him know. Tony blinks and raises his eyebrows inquisitively and the lines of black on his face move with his skin. Steve presses his lips together and bites down hard to keep from laughing. It's just…
And as a present to all you followers who requested more Hot Mess!Tony. Although...he's not...so much of a hot mess here. Whoops?
THDAY!” it proclaims, sloppily written out in purple marker and adorned with little symbols which Tony supposes are meant to represent each of the Avengers, if the hourglass and purple H are anything to go by. The D of “DAY” has been filled in with a rough approximation of the arc reactor, and it slams into Tony like a ton of bricks.
Tony shrugs and slurps more stew. His mood is still opaque to Steve, and that makes this all harder. In the course of normal life, Tony is usually so open about everything, almost too open, but when it comes to his family, it’s like a slick plastic wall drops down, imposing a buffer space at least three feet in every direction. Steve’s honestly not sure if Tony’s even told his parents yet about their engagement, and he’s not sure how he feels about that. It’s a long engagement, in any case, so there’s time. There’s still time.
It only takes three weeks of Steve living in the tower for Tony to understand—Steve’s a hopeless romantic. He cries when Pepper forces them to watch
Steve dropped his guard immediately, though Bucky remained on point, his gun held at a lowered but alert angle. It wasn’t that Steve wasn’t wary of the situation, but the relief at seeing Tony looking relatively unharmed, whole, hale. Well, come to think of it, maybe “hale” wasn’t the right word. Tony was extremely pale, dark circles under his eyes. But when he descended the stairs, he seemed almost to be floating.
With a final burst of energy, Tony flopped forward onto his mattress, groaning as his nose took more weight than it deserved. He barely had the energy to slither under the covers, but he forced himself to do it, jamming his feet (still in socks) down toward the bottom of the bed.
Steve came back to himself in the bathtub, leaning back against Tony’s chest. The hard case of the orichalcum was a comforting cool presence against Steve’s shoulder blade. His neck twinged with lovebites, and his hips, when he glanced down at them, were dotted with fingerprint-shaped bruises. In the back of his mind, he thought that fact should give him pause, but riding high on the crest of his orgasm, he couldn’t feel anything but deep satisfaction. Tony toyed with one of his nipples, trailing quickly cooling water over the pebbled peak.
Tony drank, as did the others, and the wine-stained his lips a fetching red. Steve would’ve drunk if he could’ve, but no one had poured him wine yet. Instead, he began filling his plate with the feast, his stomach demanding to be filled. The food was luscious: succulent, salty, filling, fatty, all the things he’d longed for during cold hikes through the woods and even before, when his life was wracked with poverty and his meals were usually boiled vegetables and not much else. It took him quite some time to realize none of the others were eating. They were all watching him eat, their eyes hungry, their lips red, their smiles…disturbing.
Steve stretched and yawned, making a show of it. “I don’t know about you all, but I’m bushed. And Tony, you said you’re still recovering. Should we call it a night?”
“Sure,” Steve says, only realizing after he’s already out the door that he’s still shirtless in just his running shorts and a pair of socks. He follows Tony over to his apartment and waits while Tony fishes out his keys. He unlocks the place and Steve blinks and then blinks again. Disaster area might be too light of a term to describe the chaos inside.
“There’re not a lot of people I’d let carry me around like this, you know?” he says into Steve’s hair. “Is this you saying yes?”
Steve’s heart started beating double time almost instantly. Even before the war, he’d been a long-time fan of the
By the time Steve gets to his door, the knocking has gone from polite to frantic, and he almost vindictively wishes he’d stopped to throw on his shirt and made his impatient visitor wait even longer.
“Hi,” he responds, and fights a losing battle to keep his ears from pinking. “Can I…can I help you?”
“Well, for once, we…” Steve pauses and self-consciously reaches over to knock on the mahogany end table. “For once, we didn’t have a space invasion on our hands, so I thought we’d surprise you. So much for the man with a plan, seeing’s as how this one didn’t work out at all.”
The pitcher throws another ball, and Steve nearly jumps to his feet. “Come on, Harvey. God, my grandmother throws better, and she’s been dead more’n twenty years, rest her soul. You can just…fuck. Fucking pig spleen.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Nat says, smiling sharply and slapping him on the back so hard he nearly head-butts his own knees. He knows better than to try and say anything again. Thankfully, the gifts are all more or less gag gifts: a hot water bottle, a thermometer, a huge selection of fancy instant ramen from the local Asian market, and a bottle of homemade fire cider. It’s clear his friends are sending him a message and that message is “Get well soon, dumbass.” Conspicuously, there’s no gift from Tony, but Steve doesn’t dare ask about that after the disastrous way all their holiday plans had gone.
“Wow,” Tony mumbled, kissing at Steve’s ear because it was in easy reach. “Wow.” Steve turned and fumbled into a sloppy kiss, his hand running through Tony’s hair. The sweet taste of artificial peach sent Tony laughing, helplessly turning away.
Pepper pats his shoulder in almost the exact same way Steve has seen people pat their dogs and then turns and bustles back into her apartment. He stands there a moment, processing, and then turns toward the stairs to go find Tony. The machines are in the basement but even from the first floor landing, looking down the stairwell, Steve can tell something has truly gone amiss.
Of course, even all the planning in the world cannot compensate for Tony’s overenthusiasm in the kitchen. After four hours of mixing and rolling and cutting and trying not to lose it each time Tony deviates from the recipe (“For science!” can only be cute so many times) Steve stares mournfully up at the screaming smoke detector and dumps the carbonized batch of sugar cookies into the sink where he can douse them with water. On another tray sitting on the cooling rack, the chocolate cookies sit in a congealed lump—in the heat of the oven, their edges ran together, resulting in a blackened outer rim and a gooey center that’s probably not fit for human consumption. Tony is at the kitchen table, morosely transferring the gingerbread house design onto dough that is very nearly the consistency of sand. From below, their neighbor has taken a broom to the ceiling and is resolutely thumping out a complaint, presumably about the smoke detector.
, complete with peach lube. Steve looked up through his lashes and Tony couldn’t have moved if Galactus himself were descending on Earth. He nosed the cleft of the peach and then licked it, licked again and then ever-so-gently bit at the giving flesh.
BUT NO ACTUAL SEX! Sorry about that. It just didn't feel appropriate. You can find me for more fanfiction, nerdery, and other sundries on
Steve takes up his paintbrush, his smile growing even more intent as he stands and begins stalking forward.
The window he’d been approaching implodes in a spray of glass and a…a fucking brick? What the hell? From outside on the street, Tony hears loud giggling, and his bewilderment and fear quickly transforms to rage. Is this some sort of stupid hate crime? Normally Tony and Steve don’t get hassled in public because Steve’s 6’2” and built like a brick shithouse, but Tony supposes this kind of attack would give someone a chance to run. He gets to the window, carefully stepping between the glass shards, and looks down.
“Holy fuck, man,” Sam says, flopping down on Tony’s sofa. (It turns out Tony has a sofa and three chairs, but hell if Steve would have known at first glance.) Natasha is laying boneless across the back of the couch and Bucky is on the floor, spread-eagled and eyes closed. “You are so lucky I owed you a favor.”
“Sleep” he whispered, turning onto his side and snuggling down. The sheets were cool and the scent of mint was in his mouth. Nice, beautiful sleep.
“Not your fault.” Steve murmurs, taking the box but not daring to unwrap it. Tony plows on, now taking on the more familiar cadence of overexuberance that Steve loves so much.
“Maaaaaaaaaybe,” Tony says, dancing out of Steve’s hold. “I mean, I can just give you money. You’re old enough, right?”
“No, Tony. No. I’m not gonna go without you. Let’s just… clean up and order a pizza, okay? We can always watch the parade highlights on YouTube or something.”
Steve grins and steps up so he can gingerly slip his arm around Tony’s shoulder. “Well, I’m not sure about that. Pretty sure you have to be able to do your own laundry to sit at the big kids’ table.”
Steve read over his brief, detailing Tony’s last known location somewhere near Sighișoara. As Phillips had said, there were no details on what Tony was chasing beyond “Occult object of enemy interest,” so Steve would just have to follow his nose for trouble. Sooner or later, it would lead him to Tony. He dressed for the mission, going with drab colors completely in opposition to his usual flashy uniform, and filled his pack for a lengthy mission. Even once they found Tony, they’d have to get him back to Allied territory, an endeavor that would take a good deal of time coming from a borderland under siege and surrounded to the north and west by Axis powers.
“Fireplace seems nice,” he says, and Steve takes the hint, stumbling toward the woven rug in front of the hearth. He deposits Tony in a disheveled pile, bathrobe gaping scandalously open and hair a mess, and then quickly steals a pile of blankets and pillows from the bed.
Tony led him to the right-hand seat and helped him down before taking his place at the head of the table. He looked around at them all and smiled, and there was something sharp, unearthly about that smile. The twist of unease grew, squirmed in Steve’s mind. Something wasn’t right, if he could only remember, if he could only put his finger on it.
He imagined the vampire would be in the lower levels, safe from sunlight and well-protected from the bombing. If he recalled, in
“You are a drunk-thief. A thief-drunk. You dreal when you stink,” Steve says, pawing through his wallet with clumsy fingers. “Not cool.”
Afterward, in a sweaty pile, finally warm and mostly dry, Steve stares into the crackling fire and holds Tony close to his chest. “Did you seriously forget the ring?” he asks, a teasing smile in his voice.
“Yeah?” Steve’s entire face lit up like a Christmas tree, and something in Tony swelled and went squishy. At the same time, he was aware of his low-level arousal, back after his gratuitous shower and prep. In answer, he maneuvered, pulling Steve toward Tony’s massive bed until the backs of his thighs hit the edge. He flopped down, trying not to feel self-conscious as his robe jostled loose and spilled open. After only a moment’s hesitation, Steve followed, kneeling onto the bed and kissing Tony.
Together they tumble on the floor, slow and sweet and warm and occasionally a little awkward because Steve’s knees are not fond of hardwood, even with the carpet. Through it all, Steve keeps his vocabulary limited. “Yes” and “I love you” and “Of course.” Tony is less articulate, but no less eager to express his love to Steve.
Tony grinned a little, glancing up at Steve with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. “She said, ‘Nonsense. I took time off when I was pregnant.’ And Dad said, ‘No you didn’t. You had those babies right there in your office while you were signing off paperwork.’ And Jarvis was there, too and he said, ‘No sir, you misremember. She had those babies while infiltrating some nefarious communist spy satellite in Flushing.’ Dad laughed so hard. Harder than I’d ever seen him laugh at the time. Made me wonder if he used to be like that all the time.”
And Steve answered, amazingly, swiftly, when had he even slid the condom on? When had he lost his jeans and underwear? It didn’t matter. He was out at sea with Tony. He was inside him just like that, almost too much, and above Tony, he groaned, freezing with the first breech.
“Yes, sir!” Steve saluted and set aside the potato he’d been peeling. Before he could even begin a fast trot to the Colonel’s tent, Bucky appeared. “Mission, mission, mission,” he muttered under his breath, prancing anxiously on both feet. Freshly eighteen, he was more eager than ever to prove he belonged alongside the other Invaders, and it made the stretches between missions almost unbearable for him. Steve smiled indulgently and led the way. He was also fairly eager to leave the potatoes behind, though he wouldn’t say as much to anyone. No point in grousing when the action could be so disheartening.
“Yeah, babe?” Steve doesn’t turn from his canvas, carefully applying cobalt blue to the edge of the shape he's roughing out. He isn’t quite sure what form the shape will end up taking, but he's letting instinct guide him. He isn’t much for abstraction normally, but some days, when anxiety and anger churn up inside of him one after the other, he doesn’t want strict form in his paintings.
Steve missed the warmth of Tony’s hand the moment it was gone. Beyond handshakes with dignitaries and politicians, he couldn’t remember the last time another human being had touched him. He’d almost forgotten what it was like to have the warmth and comfort of another living being. When he’d been in better health, there were a few fervent encounters, but always anonymous. Steve couldn’t risk his reputation being tarnished, not when he was already so easily cast aside by the higher-ups. And besides, who would want him, broken and shriveled as his body was? Even masturbation exhausted him anymore, and he’d managed to survive without.
“If we have, Bucky, then a beautiful dame in need of saving is just around that corner, and she’ll be very thankful to you!”
, trying to remember all the movies he’d seen as a young man, trying to remember if he’d read anything at all. Religious symbols. Weren’t vampires supposed to be sensitive to crosses, hallow ground, prayers. If Steve started reciting the Lord’s Prayer right now, would it send them all to the ground? Would it save them?
“Then have me,” Steve panted, hips rocking urgently against Tony’s torso. The next several minutes were a blur of skin and heat, and somehow Steve lost track of everything save the burning need in his gut. Tony’s hands were on his cock, he was sure. Or was it Tony’s mouth? But wasn’t Tony still sucking at the skin of his neck? And Tony’s cock rubbing urgently against his stomach. Where had Tony’s clothes gone? Before, he wouldn’t… Fuck, Tony’s nails raking into his back, stinging oh-so-sweetly. Steve came with a shuddering gurgle, and for a time, he knew nothing at all save the all-consuming light of his orgasm. For something that had been so rushed and urgent, their encounter also seemed to stretch on for ages. It had never been so intense before, so pleasurable and sweetly painful.
“You said yes,” he crooned, touching Steve’s jaw. “You will be mine. Ours. All of us together. Forever.”
“Holy shit,” Tony breathes, just as frenzied as Steve, his hands clutching at shoulders, hair, neck, back. He comes with a bitten whimper, his teeth sharp on his lips, and Steve nearly comes again at just the sight, even though he’s already gone soft.
“I calls ‘em like I sees ‘em,” Steve says as his head droops, hands running over his face. On the screen, the batter makes an easy walk to first, and the next guy slams a double right away. Just like that, the Yankees are up by two points, and Steve is moaning like he’s just been socked in the stomach. “They paid off the ump. There’s no way…”
One day, Steve wakes up and realizes he feels much more coherent. And also much less like he’s going to lose the first non-liquid thing he tries to eat. Glancing out the window, he guesses it’s midday, but given that there are flurries flying, it’s difficult to be sure. Disgusted by his own sweaty body, Steve digs himself out from the heavy mound of blankets—they’ll need to wash everything after this mess—and snatches his bathrobe from its hook in the bedroom closet.
Steve stood, hesitated a moment, and then crossed to his bedside table where he extracted the supplies Jan had mentioned. His entire face was firecracker red, but he marched resolutely to the door, refusing to be ashamed that he had sex and enjoyed it. “Go get him, honey,” Jan encouraged, and Steve managed a pained smile before he disappeared down the hall.
From under a dull red awning, Steve glares up at the glowering sky, cursing the rain and hail and the fact that he’s somehow found the one place in all of New York that is not in easy walking distance of a subway stop.
He shook his head sharply. No. This was not the answer. There was plenty of time for tweaks later. What he needed right now was sleep. Even he could recognize when he was beyond being of any use to anyone, and he was there right now, already a lump of sleep-deprived meat.
There are two ways this can go. Steve can let it sour the whole holiday for both of them, or he can double down on the rest of the list. One battle lost does not mean the war is lost, too. Once the tree is out in the trash heap, Steve returns, digs out his little table tree, decorates it with their homemade bits and bobbles, and draws up an even better plan for the coming weekend. Cookies and the parade. Easy enough.
Steve ducks to kiss Tony on the lips and then sinks into the nest of blankets. “No. Wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“Oh! Oh, you’re Steve!” Her expression changes in an instant, and she bustles into the hallway and extends a hand to him. “Hi, I’m Pepper. Tony’s friend. Is he not answering his door?”
The windows tinted to matte gray, trapping Tony in darkness. That made it so much worse. So so much worse. Without the ambient city light, he was in space, in the suit, falling, dying, alone. With a desperate wheeze, Tony whipped away his blankets, looking down at the arc reactor, touching its smooth face, pressing his palm to it to feel the steady thrum beneath. Too much. Too damn much.
Tony groans and turns, pressing his face into Steve’s shoulder. “Can we just pick up a six-pack at the bodega and go home? I don’t think I’m in the mood for being out anymore.”
Glancing at the clock, Steve resists the urge to sigh. The Christmas parade starts in an hour and they’re not even out the door. “How about we just…leave cleanup for later and head out? They’ll have cookies at the parade, and hot almonds. Those are good. You’ll like them.”
Tony stumbles further into the living space, taking in the obvious care with which the decorations were made, the fact that one pack of beer is his favorite snooty craft label. As he rounds the sofa, he sees a stack of gifts, some haphazardly wrapped, sitting next to the coffee table.
“I can’t thank you enough,” Tony is still repeating ad nauseum, flitting between all of them, a cleaning rag still tossed across his shoulder. “I ordered pizza. It’s going to be arriving at Steve’s in half an hour. I’d invite you to eat here, but my parents are showing up in forty minutes and…well…god I’m an asshole.”
“Yeah,” Steve whispered, bowing to press the word into the skin of Tony’s scarred chest, the strangely smooth swatch of skin across his pecs. His hands rubbed hot trails up and down Tony’s thighs, urging them wider so Steve could settle between them. “Where’d…where’d all your hair go?” Steve murmured absently, sucking little bruises into Tony’s stomach. “I remember you had…”
“Yeah?” Tony breathed, more and more of his brain focusing single-mindedly on the teeth that were now nipping at his belly-button.
“Toooony.” As if to emphasize his point, Steve sneaks a hand around to Tony’s ass and pulls him in, squeezing in just that way that makes Tony’s spine electrify. Fumbling more than the first time, Tony refills the glass of water and passes it back to Steve. Again, Steve downs it, and before Tony can really say anything, Steve swoops in and lifts Tony by the ass, hefting him up and stumbling toward the bedroom.
Tony looks up the meaning behind the flowers later and has to sit down for a moment, because “admiration?” “Faith and hope?” It’s hard to wrap his head around. “Passion” on the other hand… Well, Steve’ll figure out soon enough that Tony hasn’t got very many admirable qualities, what with the booze and the playboy reputation and the ability to screw up virtually any battle plan, literal or figurative. And the faith and hope? Tony’s probably going to disabuse Steve of those ideas, too. In the meantime, Tony can definitely answer the “passion” count with equal fire. Needless to say, his lingerie collection goes over well with Steve a few weeks later.
She’s out like a shot and Steve and Tony stand gobsmacked in their room. It’s got a kind of New England charm to it: a big warm quilt on a thick mattress, wooden furnishings painted white, a distinctly autumnal hue to every decoration, and the coup de grace, a roaring fireplace in one corner.
“I could…” Tony says slowly, and then his eyes dart to Steve’s face. “Wait. What about bro-culture?”
“Tony called us up and told us what happened,” Bucky said, slinging his arm around Nat’s shoulders. “We didn’t want Christmas to be a complete bust for either of you, so we shuffled some stuff around, rearranged some family stuff. We’re not gonna make you suffer through Christmas alone in bed with no special food or presents or nothing, Steve.”
“Oh, Stevie, honey. I could’ve done so much worse. But don’t worry,” she says, leaning in to kiss Steve’s cheek and sending a completely unfounded vein of jealousy thrumming through Tony’s body. “I’d never let anyone steal your things.”
“Tony,” Steve says, catching him by the shoulders and squeezing reassuringly, “it’s ok. Let’s just order a pizza and have a beer or something. We can have date night some other time. Some time when we haven’t just hauled fifty gallons or more of water.”
Gasping for breath, he managed to start speaking, or maybe he’d been speaking gibberish all along. Either way, he began a steady chant. “Steve, Steve, Steve, want you, inside, fuck me, Steve, need you, gonna, please,
“Come on, Steve. It’s the middle of January. It’s freezing. Please come inside and send everyone else on their way.”
“That’s okay. It’s…it is what it is. Maybe we’ll try pie again for Christmas dinner. You did good with the pie crust last time.”
“The only thing we can do,” Tony says through his clacking teeth. “Keep going and hope we find civilization.”
Steve frowns down at his phone for a moment, raises his hand, and hails a taxi. The hail’s subsiding a little bit, and Steve will take his chances with broken glass. He rattles off his address and shoots a text to Pepper.
“I’ve thought about both of your concerns quite seriously.” Tony’s bubbling demeanor sobered as he looked Steve dead in the eye. He put his hand on Steve’s knee, seemingly unaware of what he was doing as he treated his words with utmost gravity. “Reed’s notes on your medical files are quite thorough, and if we had more time, I’d design a suit that could be used by a new pilot. I frankly don’t think you should be subjected to this. But no one ever accused the US military of being far-sighted about these sorts of things.” He squeezed Steve’s knee before turning to his briefcase. “We’re here.”
Steve stands on the curb with Bucky and Sam on either side of him, and Natasha further back, doubled over against a streetlight.
Tony gasps, and presses a hand to his chest, fingers spread wide. “I’m a goner. We better have life-affirming sex before I go. You know. Since you’re never gonna see me again. Better make it count.”
“Mom always hired a decorator to do the house over, and you know I never cooked. The holiday parties were okay, I guess. There was usually a cool band or pianist or something. Mom let me have a little champagne.”
Slowly but surely, he squeezes himself through the crowd, yelping when someone takes the chance to cop a feel. God, he hates these kinds of crowds. Hates them. His phone buzzes again with another text.
By five o’clock, he’s got it all set up and the food is being kept warm in the oven, ready to be whisked out the moment Steve gets home. Tony’s surveying the lot of it proudly, hands on his hips, when he glances outside. There’s a dark little speck against the setting sun, flitting to and fro over New York. Sam? Was Sam running maneuvers today? Maybe Thor? But then the speck grows bigger. And bigger. And Tony stares with deepening dread as what he thought was a human resolves into a giant red…bird thing. And it’s heading straight for Avengers Tower. It would be almost comical—the way the bird’s eyes lock with Tony’s, the rattling shriek it gives, it’s clear collision course with Tony’s penthouse suite—if Tony hadn’t just spent six hours planning and executing the perfect Valentine’s Day evening.
In the course of their four months of dating, Tony seems to have more or less gotten the hang of keeping his apartment neat and doing laundry without flooding the basement, though he’s still managed to turn three more loads soft pink, and once (Steve is completely baffled as to how he managed this) royal purple. As learning curves go, Tony is traveling at light speed, but Steve has a gut feeling, and he’s learned those are usually pretty damn accurate.
After his lips start tingling and Tony finishes sucking a bruise into his neck, Steve sighs and sinks down on top of Tony, pillowing his head on top of the paint on Tony’s shirt. “Thanks,” he whispers into skin and cotton. “I needed that.”
Tony choked a little and hid his face again. “She knew I had a crush on you. Growing up I mean. I idolized you a little.”
They find The Knoll far from the center of town, cloistered on the edge of a densely wooded park, and looking positively stodgy in the rain.  Steve almost turns around to head for the dilapidated motel they saw three miles back, but Tony’s shivering so hard against his back that he doesn’t dare keep him out in the deluge any longer.
“Steve, honey, I appreciate that you’re horny, but I’ve gotta get this window at least reasonably patched up.”
Steve started to nod, and then froze, eyes darting between Tony and the painting. “Aunt?” he said slowly.
Tony your feelings. In short simple words. Multiple times. He’ll never believe you’re into him if you don’t. He’s too self-deprecating for anything else.”
Bucky, after an uncomfortable pause, continued. “It sounds like it’s Tony, and this seems like the kind of place he always winds up. Creepy castles, abandoned tombs, booby traps. Just once couldn’t one of these rumored objects be in, I don’t know, the Ritz? Could barely sleep last night, what with the wolves and the bats.”
Thor is looking more and more mortified by the second. “Has the Rupicola somehow come early? Has there not yet been consummation?”
“I should think that was obvious,” Tony mumbled against Steve’s mouth, his hands free to explore, and explore they did, mapping the muscles of Steve’s back, the perfect globes of his ass. “Come on, Mr. Peaches-and-Cream.”
“Are you Captain America or not? I think you can handle a little love confession. And besides, how else are you going to get that sweet ass?”
Tony stumbled his way to the elevator, finally allowing himself to make the jaw-cracking yawn he’d been biting back for the last four hours. Now that the code wasn’t right in front of him, now that he had allowed his brain room to think of something other than the next string of numbers and letters, it felt like his bones were turning to concrete. His feet dragged and his fingers hung limp at his sides. The raw puffiness of his eyes seemed to get worse, especially when he stepped out of his dim lab and into the blindingly bright elevator.
Jackson thought they were out of Steve’s sight, but Tony had his eyes open and was staring Steve dead in the face.
Steve turned, smiling out of habit. Jackson Slade was rolling his eyes as he stepped away from the Lamborghini. Harry emerged from the other side, throwing Steve a wave.
He blinked and looked back over to Peter. He noticed Mary Jane smiling and dabbing her eyes with her napkin. She gave Steve a little wave of thanks.
Steve swallowed, feeling sick again. He didn’t like lying to Sam, but anyone could be watching, listening, recording. “It’s great. Been awhile since I’ve been to Greece though.”
Steve didn’t want to stay, but he wasn’t sure if his money would work here. He had no place to go anyway, except maybe back to his apartment. But something told him it wasn’t his apartment here, wherever this was.
Steve would probably never even see his grandchildren. He might very well outlive them, but they would never know him.
All he had to do was think about how it would have gotten worse. How he wasn’t strong enough to fight off the dark thoughts that crept up in his anger.
“Knock it off!” Bucky was saying, but his voice was muffled. “Do you know how long it took me to plant that fuckin’ tree? Yeah, get the—stop! No! Fluffyfucker, I swear to God if you don’t let go of the tree—“
A younger soldier scooped up the hostage and called two other team members for cover as he carried her out. At least, Steve assumed the hostage was a her.
Tony was sitting up on his elbows, watching Steve with an unreadable expression. Not even his eyes gave him away this time.
Steve let out a defeated sigh. “Fine. Tony, you can call someone and I’ll talk to them. But I’m staying here tonight, I don’t want to go to the penthouse.” He just wanted to be done with today.
Once Tony was loaded in, Natasha stepped back with a little smile. “I’m gonna go blow everything up. You two have some water and relax a minute. You both look like shit.”
Steve knelt down and scooped up a writhing, excited bundle of four-year-old. “Peter says hi. He can’t wait to see you.”
Bucky gave him a look. “Steve. I’m sure she’s a real nice gal, but she’s done shit for you. If she wanted you around so bad, don’tcha think she’d make sure to send you an invitation on time? Or force Peter to call you?” He pursed his lips. “You see too much good in people you’re close to, Steve.”
He really had loved Peggy Carter—with all of his heart—but sometimes he was secretly so relieved he had never gotten the chance to marry her because life with Tony was so much more than he ever thought a marriage could be.
But Bucky had taken that away from him too, along with any chance of acceptance he might’ve had from his mother. He couldn’t even count on her approving. She had certainly been more loving than Howard as a parent, but her image in society had always been of great importance to her. The scandal a gay son would have brought might’ve gotten her if Bucky hadn’t.
“That’s not what I’m doing,” Tony said, and he sounded so defeated that Steve couldn’t be angry. “I told you that I couldn’t tell you. Even if things have changed, I still can’t say anything.”
Everything blurred except for a cup of hot chocolate, a ceramic mug held by warm, familiar hands. Tony. Those hands released the mug, moving through Steve’s chest, cradling his heart so that it was warm too.
“I have our bags packed,” Steve said, back to business. “Passports are good to go in case we need them.”
His Tony would never just lie there staring at the ceiling while any version of Steve lay there suffering beside him.
Winona frowned. “I can’t make that promise. The very nature of this is public, Tony. Trying to hide that you’re adopting a child could seriously impact your standing.”
The restaurant was far different than the regular tourist fare. They sat at a grand table, with five waiters and waitresses scurrying around to make sure the serving plates were never empty and glasses were always full. A massive chandelier hung above, and the room was decorated with white and gold accents—Peter and Mary Jane’s wedding colors.
“No,” Steve said flatly. “I looked it up because Sam said the same thing once. Coca leaves. It was coca leaves.”
“And what happens when you find someone else?” Steve asked. It was a question he’d been asked a thousand times by everyone who knew them. Because it was one thing to still love a Tony who didn’t love anyone else, but it was an entirely new form of pain to love a man who loved another. “I still get to play pretend that I’m your favorite now. I get to delude myself as much as I want to try to deal with this. But everything is going to come crashing down when you’re with someone else.”
Pepper gave him a weak smile. “Sorry, Steve. We’re just running out of time. Everything has to move right on time today.”
Steve, Thor, and Vision might be alive to see the money run out. Two of them would be fine on their own, one would probably pick up shifts at the local supermarket before he ever tried to take a penny from a taxpayer.
“No more,” Steve said with a shake of his head. “If you get sober, we can have this as much as you want.”
He’d read plenty of times that pupil dilation was an indicator of love, of attraction. But he also knew Steve just had bigger pupils than most people as an attribute to perfect vision, and the room was dark. But there they were, big as saucers, crowding out that pretty blue.
“It’s the closest to our operation,” Natasha insisted. “I’ve stayed at this safehouse several times. It’s solid.”
In the limbo period, he could daydream of a life where Steve wanted a kid. He could imagine Steve playing with Mr. Snail, Morgan’s favorite stuffed animal that was literally just a large, puffy snail with a glittery shell. She carried him everywhere. Steve would love it. Steve probably would have painted a picture of her and Mr. Snail or something cute like that. The best Tony could do was build a little snail house for Mr. Snail to sleep in at night.
Despite what Tony liked to think, Steve was a lot different than he’d been on that helicarrier decades ago. He crouched beside one of the computers and started tearing at wires. In his head, he knew what each port and wire did, and the potential value for all of it.
“Yes,” Steve laughed, giving Peter a little squeeze. “How about I duck so he can’t see my head? Like this?” He ducked and raised Peter a little higher.
Steve didn’t think he’d ever be able to give up a whole month of the year for vacation. He couldn’t imagine Tony agreeing to that either—and that was if they ever made it to a point where they could get married. They hadn’t even been dating six months and they were already fighting. Work was just too important, too necessary.
Yeah, right. Steve didn’t think it would be all that difficult for Tony to fall back in love with him if he actually wanted to. That didn’t even make sense. If someone wanted to fall in love with another person, how couldn’t it happen? The hard part in that case would be getting the other person to love them back. In their case, Tony had no issue there and he knew it.
“Oh, so you’re just abandoning him now that he’s not a little kid for you to coddle?” Tony snapped. “Don’t pull that shit with me, Steve. Don’t pull this insecurity bullshit. The world does
As he approached the tower lobby, it occurred to him that Tony might be long gone, that Stark Industries was now run by one of his kids, or by someone else entirely. But something told him that wasn’t the case. He couldn’t explain it, but he just knew Tony was still around.
His whole body shuddered violently as the heat continued burrowing into his brain, so violently that Steve couldn’t see Tony clearly anymore, he was so blurred.
Even so, had Rhodey ever had “real relationship stuff?” No, no he hadn’t. So he wasn’t allowed to talk any shit.
Ben laughed. “Yeah? That’s cool. I’m a little old-fashioned too. Just not in a hipster way.” His face turned serious. “I’m not a hipster. I swear.”
“Finally,” Tony muttered, continuing to fuse some parts. He needed a new soldering gun. Which meant he needed to build a new soldering gun with his current soldering gun before it went completely bad. He scribbled it down on a scrap of paper that had “TO DO” scrawled on the top, mashed in with about fifty other things marked as priorities.
Steve glanced over the computer modem at the woman on the floor, watching for just a moment as blood spilled from her lips like red wine, pooling dark onto the floor.
Sword, Juno, Gold, Utah, Omaha. Steve recited the names in his head, pictured the maps, the red pushpins that marked where the Germans were holed up in bunkers, the invisible path they would have to travel to make it to Caen. They had to take Caen by nightfall. They would be safe by nightfall.
Fuck. Steve wasn’t allowed to just say things like that. Bucky dipped his head with a little laugh, definitely not blushing. Oh fuck.  “Aw, Stevie, you’re a doll.”
Steve carefully made his way through the kitchen , around the espresso machine and through the spot where the shattered ceramic had been but was now gone. Even the coffee platters had been removed from the wood and walls. Tony watched him from the shadows of the bar, right where he’d been standing when Steve arrived.
Steve turned his head to glare at him. “And what if it is true, Bucky? Peter hates me. He said it himself. And he called me manipulative and a poison and mopey. And then—then he tells me all of this stuff about Tony that I didn’t know but I should have known and about how horrible it was for him and I—“ He sucked in a little breath, sitting up. “He’s
Unless Tony had brought it back with him after one of his escapes from New York. Where he seemed to run off to at least once a week now, and those were only the times Steve had caught him.
Tony snorted. “Sure you would. If you were in love with me and I was in love with you—what would we wait for? We’ve already done the living together thing. You’d move back in the second I asked.”
Steve just seemed to realize that he had no shoes. He shrugged. “It’s a new health craze. Kind of nice to feel the ground,  I figured I shouldn’t try it on the sidewalk.”
“Well, that’s encouraging.” Rhodey handed over the glass and took his seat again, looking at Tony expectantly.
His heart was withered and dry in his chest and he could feel it with every breath. Everything hurt. Everything just
Dread filled him immediately as he remembered Thor’s wine, and…Thor’s wine. He could remember following Tony down to the dance floor, but the rest had surely been a dream. There was no way it had actually happened the way he was remembering.
Steve frowned and shook his head. “Might be able to get a letter to you or something, but that’s about it. You wouldn’t be able to write me back.”
“So you just flew here and showed up to the ceremony but bailed on the reception because you want to make him happy. Bullshit.”
Tony could work a whole night through subsisting on coffee and metal fumes. But things just weren’t going his way that night. It was bitterly cold outside, for starters, with high wind that subtly rocked skyscrapers enough that he couldn’t take proper readings with his equipment.
Steve never understood why they were only given good food before going off to die. Trays of sandwiches sat on a few crates. Nobody really knew who put them there, but some things just weren’t questioned.
Steve smiled, reaching over to fold his hand over one of Tony’s. The typing paused, but Steve could feel the way his fingers twitched, betraying the irritation Tony was trying to hide. He didn’t take offense—Tony couldn’t help it.
His apartment in Brooklyn wasn’t much. A little studio loft with a nice view of a few trees on the street, and he even had one that partially blocked a window, giving the wood floor a green cast and sent the light dappling across the boards. Many people and organizations had offered him much fancier places to live, and sometimes Steve did spend a few weeks at the Avengers Compound upstate, but he liked his studio. Besides, the price tag was absurd for this little place, he couldn’t imagine what it would be in Manhattan or wherever else they wanted him to live.
With one last quiet sigh, Steve slipped into the darkness of his own living quarters for another night that was no more a victory than it was a failure.
Ben left, and for the next minute or so Steve just smiled to himself. He could start something with Ben. They could at least go on a date to try things out. That was better than what Steve had been doing for the past few months.
Tony looked at him then, wondering just how much of this Steve was aware of. “About this conversation, or about you being—”
To think that somewhere in Washington, nice and comfortable in their offices, old men were making the decision to send 200,000 men to fight with the full knowledge that so many of them would die.
More so, Steve’s presence here had reminded him how overwhelmingly alone he had been before. Raising a kid by himself seemed impossible all of a sudden. Before all of this he’d been sure. Pretty damn sure.
Steve knew a decent amount of Russian from Bucky and Natasha, but he hadn’t practiced with it in a very long time. Bucky didn’t like to speak it unless he was incredibly pissed and wanted to convey it so strongly that Steve would know what he was saying even if it was in a different language. That didn’t happen very often, though.
Steve had never actually screamed at Tony before. But he’d never ever been approached by someone while his heart was still in the process of cleaving in two. He clawed at Tony with all his might, but Tony held on tight, hugging him close. Gloating in his victory, rubbing all of the salt he possibly could into this fresh wound.
“Oh my god, look at those cheeks,” Tony whispered, lifting a hand to gently trace over Peter’s cheeks with a finger.
With a sharp breath, he vaulted a boulder and found himself twenty feet in the air over a gully. His mind relished the challenge as he fell, and picked out a safe-looking spot to land and roll easily with a leafy forest floor as a cushion.
It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair that Steve got to talk his way back into his life without a punishment for what he’d done. But in that moment, Tony really didn’t fucking care. He’d gone through enough shit at this point in his life, and he wasn’t about to push back the only person in his life he’d ever truly seen forever with. The one he’d lost but was now back.
Tony looked down at his hands. “Yeah,” he said quietly. “You don’t want to, so you fight it the whole way. And it’s not fair to them. None of this is fair. It’s not fair to you or me or him.”
“Mary Jane wants to see me there. I’m going for her,” Steve said with cracked resolve. MJ deserved his presence if no one else did.
“I know,” Steve soothed, resting his cheek against Tony’s head. “I’m here now, though. Forever, I promise.”
The elevator slowed to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a room Steve had never seen before. To be fair, he didn’t think he had ever been on the 66th floor, but he was fairly certain there were no ballrooms in the tower he knew.
Tony eyed him then, and Steve could see the real Tony—the sober Tony—clawing at the windows of his eyes. “Why? Would you share me?”
Steve knew what that meant. He shook his head and guided Tony toward the door. “You can give my lawyer a call in the morning and I’ll let her know my thoughts.”
reporters. He hated the press and everything they supposedly did for society. For what they had done to him decades ago, and for what they had done to Peter and Tony.
“I do know how fevers work,” Tony muttered. He’d only researched practically every study ever done on them while she got worse. He was fairly certain he’d know more than whatever doctor her took her to at urgent care.
Not-Tony shook his head. “Doesn’t work like that, Steve. My house, my rules. You have to sleep. I’ll even give you the penthouse to yourself.”
Of course, the church had its problems. Catholicism had plenty—so many that Steve only went to a Catholic mass on Christmas Eve and Easter, and that was mostly to appease his mother’s spirit.
The cashier looked at him a little too long and her red nails clacked against the countertop as she waited for the card reader to process his receipt.
“That means we gotta shower again, and I gotta replace the—fuck—the sheets again,” Steve tried to argue.
Steve stayed in the hallway for a few more minutes, blotting his eyes with his shirt and taking deep breaths. He kept his arms crossed, hoping that maybe Tony would just think he had been outside in the cold to explain his red eyes and nose.
Blaine snorted and Steve cracked a little smile before opening his arms. “Sorry,” he said. “Hey, Sam.”
The dogs were waiting as patiently as they could, all of their tails wagging so furiously that they were dusting the dirt from the concrete path up to the porch.
“And I’d throw out plans with Rhodey that I’d made weeks ago if you ever texted me that you wanted to see me.” Tony gave a little roll of his eyes. “God, Rhodes would get so pissed.”
He didn’t know if he could live comfortably in a world where Tony was there, but not with him. Every time Tony left, Steve waited for him to come back. He saved up trinkets in the form of stories, jokes—even took pictures on his phone just to be able to tell Tony about them.
The dog shot between Steve’s legs and Steve watched as the target tensed, his attention momentarily taken from his hostage.
A dog barked nearby, so loud that the house shook. Steve felt the animals’ breath on his calves and he tasted the same frenzy, the same bloodlust.
“You as well, Captain Rogers,” Jackson returned in his smooth baritone, giving a respectful dip of his head.
But that didn’t mean Bucky felt the same way. Bucky, who only ever smiled when Steve was in the room. Who only showed gentleness and kindness when he was making Steve coffee or throwing a blanket over him when he’d fallen asleep at his desk. Bucky, who had staked Tony out on his own accord so that he wouldn’t keep hurting Steve.
Tony chewed his bottom lip, trying to work out what to do now. Steve needed to know about this before the media got ahold of it, but he didn’t know how he was supposed to say anything after finding out that their whole relationship might not be so fake after all. He’d gotten too used to Steve being in his life again, and to know that a man like that still had feelings for him after all he’d done was more than Tony deserved, and he knew it. Not that he would ever admit it.
“Hey.” Tony’s hands came up to rub Steve’s arms soothingly. “I’m sorry for missing dinner, okay? We had some stuff to go over about the meeting in Tokyo. I had to be there.”
Everything in his mind suddenly went dark, and the crowd seemed to melt away before his eyes except for two people across the way.
“But you managed to survive, so I guess I shouldn’t have been worried,” Tony smiled. “And the next thing I knew, you were running around the Tower—always just teetering on the edge between staying upright and falling flat on your face. Just when I started to grasp that you were growing up, suddenly you were in school. Then you were spending more time with me in the lab more than you were on homework.”
“She’s custom,” Bucky explained, snapping open the main body piece and setting it up on the barrel stilts. “HYDRA had her built for me originally, then I had Stark make some modifications.” He lifted the barrel, eyeing through it to make sure there was no blockage or denting.
“I’m not worried about your contact,” Steve said. “I’m worried about the area. Everything is so packed together, the group of us is going to stick out. Someone will recognize us, then our cover will be blown.”
“Because I know what it’s like when you love me,” Tony murmured. “And before you left, you loved me. But now I can’t tell. And I had to let myself come to the only logical conclusion.”
It was hard to steel his heart like this. The past three months had been inner turmoil, but Steve was an optimistic man. He did his best to think about only the good things happening with Tony, but as he looked around the penthouse, it was clear to him that maybe his worst fears had come true.
“You weren’t fucking invited, Steve. I didn’t want you to come here and ruin everything like you always fucking do.”
Steve stood and headed over to his bed, leaning to pull out a large hard-shell suitcase from underneath it. “I’ll take first watch,” he said, flicking open the latches and pulling out his assault rifle.
“Hey.” Tony crawled closer, sitting up a little more so he could reach over and place a hand on Steve’s forearm.
Instead, work had fallen completely to the wayside. He found himself wanting to work on one—and only one—project: his family. A piece of that family was missing, but he wasn’t sure that piece was even going to come back. Yet the bed did feel empty every night, and the sole letter he had was feathering at the edges and starting to come apart in his hands.
“M’kay. I’ll put the chubmuffin to bed,” Steve said, kissing Peter’s hair again. His skin smelled so…warm. That baby smell was always calming, but knowing this baby was his son made it that much more effective for Steve.
He’d lost the desire to sugarcoat anything when it came to Tony Stark. He’d tried that before, and it had landed him here.
Natasha taught him a few tricks for staying out of the limelight, but as Bucky had always said: he was really shitty at hiding. Leaving his apartment was impossible without being noticed, and even when he did manage to sneak out, he only found himself caught on camera from across the street or up in the neighboring apartment buildings.
Well, he was never good at deflecting compliments. Tony just stood there a moment, then lifted a hand.
It felt like a betrayal to turn something that had once been so meaningful into an act, but Tony clearly didn’t care about anything they had before, so Steve assumed he wouldn’t care about that.
The cracks of gunshots grew louder and louder until they were constant and in every direction, penning them in.
“Hey,” Tony replied. He tipped over, resting against Steve’s shoulder, the weight of the battle finally crushing down on him.
“You said it took him awhile to find the courage,” Tony murmured. He shook his head. “It wasn’t about finding courage. It was about deciding whether or not he could stand to live with himself if he chose to be with the man who withheld something so awful.”
Tony’s thumb instinctively rubbed against the underside of his ring finger, still somehow unused to the lack of a wedding band. His whole life he’d been single, and he gets married for six years and all the sudden he has habits he can’t kick.
Steve might have punched him if there had been whiskey on Tony’s breath, but there wasn’t. “You said you were coming.”
Adrenaline slicked through his blood, icing his veins and flaring his nostrils as he stared into the house. Through the dust and darkness he found his targets before sound could even penetrate his ears.
and he wants you!” Steve cried. A low noise left his throat, one he’d never made before. It sounded like someone dying.
But when they did catch up, it was because there was a familiar voice at the other end of the line, soft and scratchy with sleep.
The kitchen was different too. Steve didn’t even remember what had been on the countertops before, but they were totally clean now. Not even so much as a decorative fruit bowl adorned the granite, and the fridge was blank, no trace of any of the photos they had taken together, or even the saved notes Tony had attached to the door from months prior.
Right now though, it was just Steve. He hadn’t been able to find an apartment in New York, and SHIELD was even talking about moving him to D.C. soon. A change of scenery would be nice. It would allow him to get himself sorted out after his fiasco with his newly discovered bisexuality. The fiasco part being that he had mistakenly told Natasha and now everyone in the team knew.
“Stay awake,” Blaine said, gently slapping his cheek. “EVAC is here. Keep those pretty blues open, fucker.”
Even still, he could see Steve getting angry about a bunch of rich kids and their parents spending a bunch of money on art class for toddlers. For Tony it was a matter of security. This place had the protection and discretion that he wouldn’t be able to find publicly, and he wasn’t going to put Morgan at risk of a media frenzy or a security issue. Of course, he didn’t trust the art class facility to provide enough protection either, so he always had a sentinel on standby on the roof of the building in case anything were to go amiss.
Tony swiveled to watch the bot’s feed, studying preliminary analysis from the computer’s suppositions and looking to see how close it got to guessing right. There needed to be human input at this stage to verify and validate, but if he could get the bot's guesses at least 80% accurate, it would save soldiers precious minutes of exposure and danger in the field.
“I brought you boys some chowder and hot mulled cider. Eat it while it’s hot. Get yourselves warmed up. Relax. If you’d like something to read, we have a library downstairs. I’d stay in if I were you. The weather’s not likely to let up until late tonight.”
The whole week is tense. They only have one more weekend between now and Christmas, and Steve feels more pressure than ever to have at least one of these damn activities succeed, especially with Tony wandering through the apartment like Marley’s ghost. At this point, Steve’s so desperate that he’s watching YouTube videos on Christmas goose during his breaks at work (and sometimes while he’s on the clock, too.) He’s been agonizing for days over whether he should give Tony a crash course on Catholic Mass, with all its little intricacies and rituals, or if he should just hope for the best at midnight on Christmas Day. The caroling seems like it ought to be easy enough. A group of Steve’s coworkers are going out Thursday night to sing in Copley Square, with warm drinks to follow, so Tony’s going to meet them there to join. Soup kitchen Christmas Eve Day is also easy enough. Show up. Do what they’re told. Leave. And then…
“Sure was,” Steve grumbles as he settles into the other armchair. He’s pretty sure Tony can see all the way to France with the way the robe splays, but he doesn’t much care at this point, especially as the fire starts bringing life back to his icy toes.
On cat feet, Tony creeps to the edge of the hallway and peeks in. Steve and Bucky are sitting on the couch, watching a baseball game. Steve’s leaning forward, his chin in his hands, shoulders tense. Bucky’s draped across the back of the couch, completely at ease, like a king presiding over his court. He’s watching Steve with a lazy shark grin.
“No. I’ve been out running errands all day. Haven’t been in my workroom even once.” But then Tony’s face goes thoughtful and he tilts his head a little, looking down and to Steve’s right. “I did help that taxi in lower Manhattan. Checked his radiator for him. But that shouldn’t have…” Tony’s frown deepens and he glances down at his left hand. Sure enough, there's black engine grease there, too.
” Phillips’ tone made it clear what he thought of the civilian contractor”—Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man.”
him, the way he bends down without moving too far away, the way his hand trails down Tony’s arm as he leans over, the way his hip knocks heavily into Tony’s ass as he lifts the sheet metal up again. Once he brings the metal around in front of Tony (conveniently placing Tony in his embrace) he abruptly slumps with all of his weight, draping himself across Tony’s back.
“Tony? Tony!” Steve flails then, arms and legs jumping, body jerking up and promptly spilling onto the floor. “Guys! Tony’s…”
He barely registered the click of the lube cap, but then there was new cool slickness down his balls and crack, and the sudden and welcome intrusion of Steve’s finger. Tony yelped into the close air of the bedroom and felt Steve begin to withdraw. Desperate to keep him where he was, Tony clamped down his thighs, crossing his ankles behind Steve’s head. He couldn’t catch the air to breathe, but he fought with everything in him to arch into Steve’s touch, to say with his body that Steve should stay, that Steve should love him.
“Destroy is such a strong word, Steve,” Tony says as they trudge up the stairs, dripping and cold. “I…I remodeled a little. Just a few new windows.”
“I can’t tell you what an honor it is to work on this project. I’ve admired the Iron Man armor for years. I actually wrote my bachelor’s thesis on the engineering of it. The joining of man and machine! Neural synapses tied into transistors and pneumatics and servos! We’re on the cusp of something amazing, Colonel. An age in which man and technology join as one, to the betterment of both. And not, my hope is, just for warfare. The men coming back from Vietnam now are surviving injuries that often killed men in World War II. They’re missing limbs, experience traumatic brain injuries. Just think how a lighter version of the Iron Man armor could help those men. Or imagine if your automobile could tell you that it sensed another automobile approaching from your blind spot and you could tell it to respond accordingly! With your mind!”
“Have I got something on my face?” Tony asks, and that's it. Steve lets out one raucous guffaw right in Tony’s face and then has to press a hand over his mouth as other bar patrons turn to stare.
Even though his arms feel like lead, Steve has no choice. He drops the box and lunges for Tony, pulling him into a tight hug on the sofa, squeezing as tight as his crummy, flu-leveled body can manage.
The crash of the glass is deafening, and JARVIS is already wrapping Tony in armor before he can even begin to turn away from the impact. The bird thing is maybe fifteen feet tall, and it hunches forward like some parody of Quasimodo as it lumbers into the penthouse, head swinging wildly as flower petals and stray leaves flutter around it. It's whuffling loudly, and after a moment, Tony realizes it must be sniffing. “What in the actual hell? JARVIS?”
Tony Stark, the boyish crush he’d nurtured before the serum transformed into outright infatuation, an infatuation that didn’t go unnoticed. On their missions together, he and Tony had come together in dark haylofts and bombed out buildings, sharing hasty blowjobs or handjobs, trading the kinds of feverish kisses that came of desperation in a time of war, huddling for warmth, companionship, trying their damndest to hold onto shreds of humanity in often inhuman situations. In his wildest dreams, Steve imagined the affair carrying beyond the end of the war, growing into two war heroes and self-proclaimed bachelors who were good friends to the public and committed lovers in private. The idea of seeing Tony, of
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he mumbles, resisting the urge to groan at the brief relief her cool hand had brought. “I feel…” His stomach churns, rebels, and he only just has time to turn and evacuate it into his waste bin.
“Ok, buddy,” he murmured setting the mug out of reach. “Let me help you with that spoon. They’re tricky, I know.” He helped wrap Tony’s clumsy fingers around the spoon and then guided him through the first few bites of oatmeal. It was nice. Not too sweet. Not too hot. Warm and grounding in his stomach. He blinked and realized Steve was there, looking down with that sad smile that wasn’t quite a real smile, that little pinch of skin between his eyes.
Tony didn’t reply right away and instead slipped the needle under Steve’s skin. When he did speak, it was soft. “Then maybe you could come back.”
Knowing full well that Tony wouldn’t sleep on his own, Steve had gotten him to swallow a sleeping pill while he was too dazed to recognize what was going on. He’d been out for a few hours, but Steve could tell by the crease in Tony’s brow that he was fighting it. Within an hour he’d be awake, and he’d be in an awful mood.
Blaine paused at one of the side doors of the house, popping open his helmet to expose his face. Everyone else followed suit except Cueball, who had pulled out a tablet and was tapping away.
“A bit much for you, Cap?” Tony tested. Even totally sober, he could get drunken confidence when it concerned Steve Rogers.
His kid would get a portion of his wealth, but he planned on giving the majority to the part of his  family that needed it most. His kid would have more money than he or she could ever spend, but after he was dead and gone, he wasn’t sure how long the team would be able to stay afloat. A few decades, sure, but what about after that?
“You’re not interrupting anything,” Tony purred, looping his arms around Steve’s waist. That always seemed to work. Steve relaxed into the hold, and Tony knew any suspicion that might develop was melting away with Steve’s surprise. “Just catching up—old lawyer friends.”
“Won’t be,” Tony said. “That’s the thing, Steve. I’m waiting for him. Always. That’s not to say there can’t be someone else, but I know there won’t be.”
“I can make sure you get there on time every day, if it’s the travel,” Steve offered. “I can call in some favors and—“
Tony and Peter were hidden somewhere out his window, tucked within the landscape of the blue domed rooftops and white stucco of Mykonos. Happy with their lives and loves. Happy without him. Happy to be rid of him.
“I’m coming, I’m coming,” Tony assured her as he hustled. Morgan seemed comfortable here, and she was smiling wider than ever. This place had become something of a home to her, a place of safety and refuge. Exactly what he’d been hoping for when he started all of this.
The voice belonged to a young woman with red cat-eye glasses and so much of a hipster aura that Tony swore he could smell coffee grounds.
“I was for a stint, yeah,” Bruce muttered on the other end of the line. “But I think you’d be better off calling her actual doctor, Tony.”
Steve’s instinctual reaction was to argue against perfectly rational advice like that, but he kept his mouth shut. Tony needed a distraction, and so did Steve, quite frankly. So he leaned into Tony and they headed toward the closest bathroom.
There, he had VR of the other Tony’s reality as he walked through the party, talking to guests while Steve gushed beside him.
Steve struggled when Rhodey approached him, and started to yell just as a rag was forced into his mouth. The restraints didn’t budge, nor did they feel the slightest bit weakened. Fifty other versions of him had probably tried to escape this place, and fifty tweaks had been made to ensure none of them succeeded.
Why was he always so mean? Every time anyone was nice to him, Tony especially, he was wary of them. Like a frightened dog, he snapped at the hands that fed, clothed, and housed him.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Rogers. I hold the dining hall record at Northwestern. Eight full plates from the buffet line on burger night,” Harry said.
One of the Howling Commandoes had rigged up a roadside explosive, except the caravan that triggered it had been American. They’d been given incorrect coordinates.
But this time, Tony could see real worry in Steve’s eyes. The deep kind that said he wasn’t going to like whatever came out of Steve’s mouth.
Maybe Eisenhower had wanted them this packed. To make them itch to be free, to rush out and fight with blind and wild energy.
“You’re gonna regret that,” he muttered. He threw a hand up, firing a blast that hit the wall of the building across the street. Light bathed the alley in blue, but his attacker was nowhere in sight. Fast little fucker.
Steve waited for him to elaborate, but when Tony didn’t, he decided not to press. Clearly this wasn’t going to be an easy topic to bring up, even if Tony seemed to want to tell him about it. Steve could understand that; he never wanted to speak to anyone about Bucky falling off the train either.
Steve shrugged. “This has been hard for me. You know me so well, and I know you pretty well too, but we aren’t friends anymore.”
“Yeah?” Steve leaned against the counter, daring Tony to say it. To think a seemingly meaningless morning in the gym could be leading up to
Tony kissed him gently, stopping his speech. “If she changes her mind, we have to go to court. And there’s no way in hell she’s got enough money to beat us, Steve.”
“Or you can just come and bring urgent care to me right now.” It seemed like a reasonable enough solution. “She’s really warm, Bruce.”
Tony turned around and Steve found himself being given a lookdown by his ex-husband that he didn’t much like.
“I waited too long,” he said first, instantly smacking down the resolve Tony scrambled to gather. “But I couldn’t let you think I was using her. I wasn’t ever going to say anything about this if I’d decided differently. I would have just stopped teaching and gone on my way.”
He fished his nubby pencil from his sweatshirt pocket (he always kept one there just in case he needed to sketch) and scribbled his number down on a clean napkin. He handed the napkin to Ben, who grinned.
Steve watched as Sam flew in, throwing Ant Man into the gills of the creature while Hulk held it up.
“I’m securing the connection now…” Cueball muttered. “Okay, I’ve got ‘em. Locating security system, here we go.” He tapped some more. “There. Security system on standby, you’re clear.”
“No. No? Subconsciously, maybe. Commitment issues and all of that.” Tony shrugged. He gave Steve a once over. “How are you feeling, by the way?”
Discarded pad thai was strewn on the floor beside the bed from lunch, noodles and vegetables strewn out on the hardwood. Steve could also see the remains of a bottle of lube they’d emptied, though now he wondered if it had always been that low or if Tony had been using it with Iron Man.
He sat down beside Morgan and gently dabbed her face with the damp cloth. She lazily swiped at him with a pudgy hand, and turned her face away with a groan when he continued.
“Does it react to electricity?” Steve asked, opening his desk drawer and putting the agreement away so he could get to work. He checked his phone, but there were no messages from Tony. No response to his asking if they could talk later.
He heard the clink of a coffee mug and the sound of Tony rubbing his face. He couldn’t help but wonder what Tony had been up to if he had spent a Friday night alone. He’d probably been in the lab. Or maybe he’d been waiting around to ask someone out. Sitting there in his penthouse, wishing Steve was there. And then maybe they would have ended up on the couch, watching the fireplace and talking about things. Tony would lean over and say how much he had wanted this to happen, and then, just like that, they would be kissi—
“Copy that,” Steve replied, ripping open the metal plating on the computer modem. The hard drive was there, exposed like a gleaming jewel underneath more wires. He leaned down, squinting to try to make out the code stickered on the side. “Hard drive ID is one-alpha-foxtrot-five-seven-zero-tango-zulu.”
Ben frowned at his watch and glanced at his empty salad container. “Maybe some other time. I’ve really gotta run.” Ben stood. “This was great, Steve. Thanks for letting me sit with you.”
Steve let out a long breath and scrubbed his face in his hands. He hated talking with Tony just as much as he craved it. Tony was impossible. Yet that only seemed to make him more attractive.
Jackson was probably the most fashionable person Steve had ever met.  Not to mention he was a beautiful person to begin with. Steve wasn’t attracted to him, but he recognized a handsome man when he saw one. Jackson was darker than Sam, with a demeanor that oozed an intimidating confidence, but his eyes were warm and kind. He always wore tailored suits and Italian leather shoes, with platinum cuff links and occasionally a pair of simple earrings to match. Oh, and his trademark black-rimmed glasses that said “professional businessman you don’t want to mess with.”
He didn’t talk after that. He didn’t eat either.  He cut his food into pieces, pushed them around on his plate, and listened to Candice talk about how Peter had started coming over to her place on the weekends, and how they decided that Peter was going to make Mary Jane’s engagement ring.
Steve watched for enemy movement while Blaine dug out a facemask from his pocket. He slid it on over his beanie and then down over his face before slipping on a pair of sunglasses. When Blaine retrieved his rifle, Steve did the same.
Tony shook his head as Steve pulled away. “It was nothing you did, that’s why I didn’t want to say anything to you. It’s fucked up, Steve. If I had any choice, we’d still be married and everything would be the way it was.”
The wind had picked up, and rain spit from the sky. Not enough to get them wet, but enough to be downright annoying. The men shifted and rocked, the sea of them churning and boiling and bubbling as they neared land.
The body next to him jerked, and Steve heard the sharp inhale of realization before there was a flurry of movement from beneath the sheets as Tony yanked them from his face. His eyes were blown wide as he looked up at Steve, and Steve was sure his own look wasn’t much different.
“Thor said he made it non-alcoholic,” Tony cut. He wasn’t going to throw away his sobriety for a goddamn party that meant nothing, and especially not one that Steve was at.
“I—“ He hadn’t been aware that he had a “shrug thing.” He probably didn’t. This was just Tony trying to get under his skin or trick him or something.
Steve looked back up, blinking a few times just to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. But sure enough, Peter was on TV, talking to a news anchor in the living room of Tony’s penthouse.
Peter could have never lived this life. Steve could never imagine allowing his son to go off to war at the age Emory had. The poor kid thought military-grade banana and peanut butter sandwiches were the best thing in the world. Steve didn’t know about Emory’s family—he never asked questions—but he could only imagine they were either dead or hated him. Or maybe they had been the ones to subject him to the needles and probes that made him into something more than human.
“He got me in the ribs, but it didn’t go deep,” Blaine replied, gingerly prodding at his right side. “I’m all right.”
just a heads up, i've changed the rating from mature to explicit and added more tags.  my works rarely include sex, but this one does (this chapter at least) and it ain't pretty. if reading sex scenes isn't your thing, same. this isn't PWP.
“Goodnight,” Tony said quietly, and it broke Steve’s heart. When was the last time Tony had been able to say that to someone?
He put his pencil back in his pocket and recycled his salad container, still grinning to himself as he stepped from the shop back out into the bustling atmosphere of the city. Ben was totally going to text him. Or call him. Ben was going to call and ask if—
Steve’s hand balled to a fist in the wooly fabric of the blanket as he headed back to his ex-husband.
His lungs began to burst and his throat began to open and all he saw was print black lettering from the pamphlet page he never finished reading:
A wave rocked the boat upward, and a few rounds of a heavy machine gun cut through the thin walls. Two men fell, one screaming. One soldier turned to help, a medic, but the rest stared straight on.
The sea was angry that day. Waves lashed at the sides of their battleship, sending frothy whiteness up onto the deck and spraying them all. They didn’t mind, because that day was  hot and sticky, like death. Suffocating. Steve remembered breathing in salt. He also remembered vomiting salt.  Just salt and stomach acid, nothing else. There was nothing else.
“Fuck you,” Steve said quietly, trying to force malice into his tone. The feedback loop rocketed through his synapses along a track so well-worn Steve was sure he couldn’t veer it off course if he tried.
When he did go to church, it was a modern one—small, full of mostly young people. There were no grandmothers clutching rosaries, no words to recite aloud, no confession.  Sometimes he wondered if his mother would have disowned him by now, if her motherly love couldn’t extend to cover the fact that her son was gay, and not a practicing Catholic (though if anyone asked, he always said he still was). He also wondered if she would be angry at him for not living with less. For not giving more, for not serving the way she had.
Pepper, who had been a bridesmaid (though he realized now that bridesmaid probably wasn’t the right word) at his wedding was now looking at him the same way she looked at one of Tony’s fans. He didn’t even know what she was doing with her life anymore.
Steve’s cheeks colored. He’d been fairly certain only a few select people knew that story. Bucky only ever told it around trusted friends--people they were
Steve’s nostrils flared and he considered ripping his arm from Blaine’s grasp, even if there would be a lot of blood. “I called my ex husband,” Steve snarled. “There. Don’t worry, I have no intention of doing that ever again.”
That night terror had been worse than normal. Bad enough that Blaine had to shake him awake to get him to stop screaming.
Peter and Harry were already raiding the fridge, talking about their trips up. Harry had gone with Jackson, Peter with Tony.
Tony sighed. “Yes. Because if how you’re acting right now is anything like how you’re going to act when we’re out in public, we’re not gonna sell it.”
“I’m just headed to get some coffee, wanna join? Think you can stomach a cold brew with your ex-husband?” Tony tossed him a wink that made Steve’s stomach drop.
And then after his life was over, he would rot in hell for making his child hate him and turning his back on a man who had loved him to the very end.
He paused briefly to notice that he was restrained, and the memories hit him like a freight train. He actually lurched, and slumped back into the chair, breathing harder than he ever had as an asthmatic.
“You backed out,” Tony started, because that was where it all began. “You came back and didn’t even want to meet her before you left.”
“Weekends,” Steve said almost desperately, looking up form Peter’s paper. His son wouldn’t meet his eye. “What about weekends?”
“Just wondering.” Steve nodded to himself a few times as the pause in their conversation lengthened. “I want you to know that I’m proud of you. You’re so smart and nice and you’re happy, right? You’re happy?”
The story had turned to a series of clips and pictures about Peter’s history with Mary Jane, how they met and how long they had dated.
“Mm, well if it’s a stupid little crush thing, I can’t help,” Rhodey said, leaning back in his chair. “If it’s
Tony. Father, the “cool dad,” the one who bought him everything he wanted and taught him whatever he wanted to know.
Peter kept his gaze out the window. “He said maybe we could get lunch sometime this summer and I could keep him updated.”
“Can’t do it,” Tony said, and began walking toward the elevator again. “I’ve got all kinds of events booked. I’m on call for priority missions only.”
It would be the first time in a long time that Steve would be genuinely happy around Tony without fear that something dramatic was going to happen.
Not-Tony chewed his lip, looking out the windows at the city beyond. “Something happened to you not that long ago. You were somewhere familiar, and suddenly it wasn’t familiar anymore, right?”
Pain crossed Tony’s face, but also fear. Steve had only seen that look a few times, when the danger seemed so insurmountable that they had no way out. Tony looked away, clearly summoning the courage to speak.
Tony smiled. “It was. Gave us a chance to be ourselves. We never got to be that way here.” He gestured toward the city outside. “There’s always someone watching. Always a chance that someone will need us and come barging in. Not there.”
He was more successful when he forced himself to imagine Blaine in that kind of situation, but thinking about anything more than touches—trying to picture the way Blaine might look at him, for instance, shorted out the “fantasy” altogether.
Steve shrugged, spearing a piece of lettuce with his fork. He had gotten the message very quickly. He was here because Tony had probably insisted upon it, but he certainly wasn’t welcome.
Something flickered in Franklin’s eyes before he dropped his hand. “Thanks for making sure she’s safe.”
Steve sat down on the edge of the helicopter and squinted as he looked out over the too-white sand and the beautiful expanse of ocean beyond. He didn’t look away when he heard the Velcro tearing as Tony freed himself to grab a bottle of water.
Tony shot him a glare as a guilty expression came to Jackson’s face. “Oh, Steve,” Jackson said, shaking his head, “that’s not—“
But every time, he stopped himself before opening the cooler that housed the “strain.” Extremis wasn’t exactly a disease, but it wasn’t really a chemical compound or anything either. If he had to call it something, he would probably use magic.
“My favorite time of year was always the second week of July,” Steve began slowly. “All year I waited for the day when we headed to the lake and we got to spend time together as a family. I know most of your life I was in the hotel downtown while you and Tony were in the house, but I still remember how happy you were to spend every day there exploring.” He smiled genuinely then, and his eyebrows ticked up a little almost like he was going to start sobbing.
“He’ll sabotage himself every time,” Bucky murmured. “He wants to show up. Every week he’s gotten so close to stepping out the door. But he has a lot of pride. He got rejected a lot when he was a scrawny stick of a kid. Still carries that with him, even if he doesn’t think so.”
“We need this to be quiet-like. The situation in Romania’s topsy-turvy. Word is they’re trying to style a coup to flip to the Allies. Last thing we need is drawing attention with Allied activity there. Need ‘em to still look like Axis as far has Heir Hitler’s concerned. You lot show up? Well, you’re known for causing trouble. We need Hitler fixed on France. Big things are coming down the pipeline, and we don’t want him turning his eye east right now. So the rest of your boys are heading to France to be flashy and cause trouble. It’ll just be you, Cap.”
Tony glares at the kid, but Steve’s too busy extracting his smartphone to pay much attention. “Please work, please work, please work,” he implores as he hits the home button. Miraculously, the stupid little thing fires up and Steve opens his weather app. Rain for the next six hours. “Fuck me,” he whispers, and plasters a hand to his face. A moment later, his phone makes an ominous spitting noise and the screen goes black. “Double fuck me.”
“It kind of is. Christmas was never about family and friends with my parents. It was about schmoozing and making up for emotional shortcomings with way-too-expensive presents. I never liked it much. But I’ve seen enough cheesy holiday movies to know that the spirit of the season is being together with the ones you love. That’s all I really wanted, Steve, and I’m sorry I didn’t say it sooner. I’m sorry you got so stressed out, and I’m sorry you got sick.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Tony says, and Steve’s almost shocked by the respectful tone—he’s heard Tony on the phone with Howard, after all. Mary leaves with a last little giggle, glancing appreciatively at Steve’s chest, and then they’re alone.
Rather than dashing off to make a call for pizza, though, Tony remains in the door, face frozen. His lips quiver a little, and then a little more. “You, uh, you really got into the zone today?” He sounds like he’s feeling out the room, trying to figure out how Steve’s going to react to something.
Steve smiles a slow smile at him. “Let’s go up and order that pizza and get an ice pack on your shoulder. I’ll even let you have a beer.”
“He says there were rumors of a strange man in Sighișoara a few days ago,” Bucky said, still speaking in German. “Black hair. Facial hair.”
“Here Tony. Can you drink this for me? Got you a straw to make it easier.” Nat set down a mug of milk in front of him, and he nearly dropped it when he touched the ceramic. He wasn’t expecting it to be warm. But still, he sipped at it through the straw, trying to answer Nat’s quiet smile with one of his own. He didn’t feel like smiling. Or drinking. But he forced himself to. Something inside him slowly began unclenching.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers, looking away and then back again. “Just, just wanted to be romantic. For you.”
Tony stood shoulder to shoulder with him, contemplating the brush strokes of Peggy’s portrait, the sweeping curl of her hair and the delicate halo on her right side where the light bounced off her skin.
Tony’s about to tell Thor that a giant hole is nothing to be congratulating anyone on, but then Steve glances back and he’s
Normally in the field, Steve was able to sleep and wake at will with no alarm needed, but sleep was slow to come. The forest was alive with noise: drizzling rain, rustling leaves, wind moaning in the higher boughs of the trees. In the far distance, Steve thought he heard a wolf howl. And then another. Maybe he would forego sleep for the night; he could make it two days without if need be. Another howl made up his mind, and he settled in for a restless night, teeth on edge for no reason he could explain. It wasn’t as if this was the most frightening situation he’d been in during the war.
Struggling for words, Steve allows himself to be led to the couch, where Tony promptly burritos him with a blanket again. The others all carry packages over while Sam ladles out bowls of soup. Nat disappears and reappears with a tin of cookies, courtesy of Clint, who couldn’t get out of Christmas with his brother.
Tony wasn’t always entirely forthcoming about his experiences leading up to the war, but he’d revealed enough, in their brief post-coital embraces, to lead Steve to think a little more of mystical treasures and creatures that haunted humanity’s worst nightmares. After all, Steve himself would have, just a few short years ago, been dismissed as one of those ridiculous occult rumors. When rumors of Blut reached Tony’s ears, fittingly around a campfire in woods deep behind enemy lines, he hadn’t scoffed. Rather he had stroked his facial hair and stared into the dancing flames.
. Tony had a stray thought to be glad he’d cleaned up, to be glad his body was like this for their first time. And then he was swept away again, deeper, higher, slowly moving toward the crest. He didn’t want to reach it without Steve, though.
“Please, I told you to call me Tony, and I stand by that. Now, I know what requests Ross has made of me, but all due respect to him—” Steve snorted without meaning to. He suspected in Tony’s estimation, that was very little respect indeed “—he’s not the one in the armor. That’s you. So I’d like to know what you need, and I’ll do everything I can to implement your specifications before they deploy you to New York.”
“Of course my answer’s yes,” Steve says, and turns awkwardly, caught between going to the bed, which would probably feel nicer on his knees, or heading to the fireplace, which will be warm and romantic, but maybe not the most comfortable. In his arms, Tony makes a soft noise in his throat, the hummed pleasure of a cat, and then he leans forward and presses his forehead to Steve’s.
“Presents.” Steve says out loud, looking down in horror at the list. When the fuck is he even going to go shopping? What does Tony want? It’s their first Christmas! Steve has to resist the urge to double over on his sudden stomach ache. “How could I forget…”
Tony hawed out one sad squeak of a laugh and then nodded. “Faith. Right. I’m very good at that.” But all the same, he dropped his arm, taking Steve’s hand again. “You…you really want me?”
“Tony?” he calls, frowning at the shining floor. That is definitely water. There’s a bang and then a loud exclamation from below.
Steve could do nothing but surrender to the touch. His focus narrowed down to a fist and a rhythm, blood throbbing hypnotically, heart beating frantically, neck and hips aching for more more more. And Tony gave it. Sweet pleasure, icy skin on burning flesh, teeth at his neck, nibbling in more lovebites. The other hand toying with pebbled nipples, occasionally flashing down to Steve’s balls to fondle and play. Sex with Tony had always been good, but never like this. Time disappeared again, and his world became pleasure and sweet pain, and pleasure again.
The night wore on and Tony tossed and turned, but his brain couldn’t seem to shut down. He could recognize it, in a distant sort of way. Nervous thought spirals that took him further and further down the rabbit hole. When he’d gotten them as a teen and in his twenties, he’d self-medicated into a stupor, but he knew how Steve felt about that. Tony was better than that, now.
“…like living with two of the most prominent Avengers as parents? You’ve got Tony Stark, Iron Man, who you now co-own Stark Industries with, and then your other father is Captain America, whose legend spans over a century.”
Tony closed his eyes. He hadn’t known that, but now that he thought about it…Peter hadn’t mentioned ever going up to visit.
“With Captain America, right?” Steve tried, lip curling to a smirk. “Heard he wasn’t so perfect after all.”
He just hoped it was early enough. That their divorce wouldn’t cause Tony to snap and follow in Howard’s footsteps. Now there were statistics about abuse, and Steve knew that children who were abused were likely to abuse their children. Two fathers with a history and two fathers with alcoholism in the family? Peter was doomed.
The forest around them was silent except for the occasional noise of snow falling from the thick coniferous branches above and the crunching of snow beneath their boots.
Maria’s mother rushed out from behind the car and wrapped Maria in her arms, sobbing uncontrollably.
“Really fast,” Steve clarified, though he knew Peter didn’t need it.  He used the lapse in excitement to set Peter down, ruffling his hair. “Go grab your bag, Pete. And get Papa’s shield.”
Steve. The man who showed up every other week with finger paint and pancakes and stole him away from home.
Steve blinked, licking his lips once because Jackson and Harry were in the room. Mostly because Jackson was in the room. “Yeah, Pete, everything’s okay.”
Blaine let out a diffusing sigh and packed up the syringe, crushing it just as he had done Steve’s and placing it back in his bag.
There was an empty section of flooring, and when Tony tapped his watch, holograms burst from the center of the floor, creating a sphere-like shape of interconnected hologram pieces. Energy began to surge between them, and a low hum filled the room as the lights dimmed.
There were all kinds of perks that came with Special Forces. Even more than when Steve had been involved during the forties.
Even so, he wanted to warn her. He wanted to protect this poor girl from the horrors that marriage could inflict upon two people. How one day she could love Peter with all her heart even at his worst, only to find herself a shell of a human being a few years later.
Steve rolled his eyes before reciprocating the high-five. Emory was definitely the most immature man in their group.
He returned to his side of the bed and climbed under the covers. Despite his reputation as a prude in the media, Steve had lived through the largest war in history. Filthy conditions, human beings dying of any cause imaginable, vicious cold, scorching heat. He’d been in brothels, scummy bars, and other places where sex in public was as common as talk of war. He’d seen the very worst of humanity, and the ways men and women came to terms with that.
They had two minutes to get into the compound and out of sight once they activated their cloaking systems. Similar to the stealth mode of the helicarrier, their combat gear was laced with nano particles that essentially turned them invisible for a short period of time. Of course, it wasn’t perfect, but it was much safer than trying to sneak in without it.
Tony lifted his brows but didn’t look away from his phone. “I’m here, aren’t I? That’s more respect than I give a lot of people, Rogers.”
“I panicked,” Tony explained. “I planned to pick you up with Morgan, but I couldn’t decide if that was better or worse. I thought better, then worse. So I drove her over to Pepper’s place, then she started telling me to bring her. Then Morgan started crying--and I can’t stand to see that kid cry, Steve and—” He looked defeated, running his hand through his hair again. “I dunno, I fucked up. I fucked up a lot.”
“I’ll take that,” Mrs. Freeman said, reaching out for the drawing. “We’ll get it framed and put in in your favor bag.”
Ever since the whole palladium debacle, he’s kept his birthdays pretty low-key. Not to mention there’s been a world-threatening event every April since then. It hardly feels like a time for cake and booze when weird green aliens are trying to take over the planet. Somehow, this year he just…forgot.
Tony gasped, and kept gasping, suddenly at sea, rudderless, being washed out on the tide of Steve Rogers’ wicked tongue. Steve’s arms made their way under Tony’s hips, hitching him up for a better angle, and Tony, in turn, clutched at Steve’s hair, trying desperately to find shore again. Steve was relentless. It was so wet, so filthy, his tongue so present, his lips so soft and pliant one second, demanding the next. In and out, in and out, Tony becoming wetter and sloppier all the while.
The ride home takes an agonizing thirty-five minutes, detoured as they are by a flooded road and backed up traffic. Everyone else took taxis too, it seems like. Steve’s leg jiggles nervously against the floor of the cab, and his portfolio rattles anxiously in his hands, echoing the pounding rain outside. When they turn the corner onto his block, his blood freezes and snaps in his veins, a crushing expansion of water that obliterates him from the inside out. There are two firetrucks and an ambulance parked outside their building, and even through the sheets of rain, Steve can see smoke crawling into the darkening sky.
adventure books, and when, during various missions the past two years, he’d found himself working with
And suddenly Tony loomed before him. “Of course this is me! This is me as I never dreamed! My heart is healed! I have all eternity to search out the strange secrets of this world! The orichalcum allows me to resist
“No, wouldn’t want that,” Steve says, and begins to shed his own sopping clothes. Despite their good intentions not to scar Mary for life, she comes back in and gives a scandalized gasp just as Steve’s shedding his underwear. The way she plasters her hand over her eyes though, Steve thinks it might not’ve been a mistake.
Steve grumbles and shifts a little, but he makes no effort to hide himself. It’s nothing Tony hasn’t seen before. In companionable silence, they finish their chowder and cider and defrost in front of the fire. Before he knows it, Steve is drifting off again, fighting the droop of his own eyelids. He’s vaguely aware of Tony rising and rustling in their sodden duffle bag, the clink of zippers and the plop of wet clothes in the bathroom, but he does manage to register it when Tony says, “Son of a bitch.”
“No, see. No, I couldn’t have, because that would make not once but twice that you would see I’m a complete loser and give you ample reason to blow me off.” Almost as soon as he’s said it, Tony clamps his hands over his mouth. “Fuck me,” he whispers through his clenched fingers and Steve grins.
“And before we start throwing shit,” the downstairs neighbor yells, and all four of them down on the street flinch. Tony watches with half-worry, half-amusement, half-exasperation (too many halves, but Tony is too tired to care) as Steve stumbles his way up the stoop and into the building and then waits impatiently, getting colder all the time in the draft from the window, until the front door rattles its way open.
Steve pouts prettily, but he takes the glass and downs it all in a single draft, a little bit of water sloshing onto his criminally tight gray T-shirt. “Done,” he says, wiping his mouth in a positively filthy way and fixing Tony with an intent stare. “Blow job now?”
Steve swallowed hard, unsure what to say. He still flew to DC at least once a month to see her. Tony never said anything about it, but maybe. Maybe…
. He sincerely hopes that somewhere midway through, they break off to more pleasurable activities, because he’s not sure he can take the tooth-rotting fluff and he’s pretty sure
North of Hartford, the landscape begins to change, suburbia giving way to thick, musty forests, the trees flaming with deeper color as the air grows colder. Tony asks for a pee break in Windsor Locks, and Steve takes advantage of the chance to check his phone. The forecast still calls for clear skies and perfect riding weather. He gives the cloud bank one last wary glance, and then follows Tony into the restroom to take care of business. He should’ve known better than to trust the weather app.
With two hours to deadline, Tony finally managed to unsnag the last line of code and send it through. A new smart bot, one designed for searching and detonating IEDs so soldiers wouldn’t have to, whirred to life and aimed its tiny periscope cam at him inquisitively, awaiting input. The right mix of AI—not so sophisticated that army programmers could turn it into an offensive weapon, but not so improbably slow that it failed to do its job. Three iterations ago it’d tried to bring the dummy bomb to Tony, and that was clearly a no-go, so he’d started the code from the bottom up and programmed until the edges of his vision went blurry. It needed testing. Testing.
The screen shatters into a massive spiderweb and the picture becomes a thousand rainbows of neon color. Steve and Bucky both freeze as the sound continues on for a moment, the roar of the crowd crackling and faint, and then abruptly cuts off.
“I just wanted to give you a nice Christmas. You seemed so…I don’t know. It seemed like a sore spot.”
“Yes, you are,” says Bucky, flinging his hand over his eyes. “Where did you even find this guy, Steve?”
Helpless in the face of Steve’s very real, if very silly, worry, Tony leans forward and gently kisses his face—each eyelid, nose, each cheek, chin. “I’m not leaving you. Not ever. Want to marry you, remember?”
If Jan’s goal had been to shock him into action, she succeeded, because he gave her a dirty, affronted look. “I’m allowed to admire. Tony certainly does his squats. But if you want that ass to be yours, you have to
Steve texts, and he feels a shiver of apprehension. Since the washing machine incident, they’ve managed to have six successful dates and several more nights of just hanging out and watching films. Or rather, not watching films. Steve has enjoyed all of these nights immensely, though he’s pretty sure Sam, Nat, and Bucky didn’t appreciate the eyeful of Tony’s ass the one night they’d invited themselves up for beers.
Tony snorted. “If anyone else said that to me, I’d think that they were trying to pressure me into sex.” His eyes finally met Steve’s. “But Captain America would never dare.”
Despite all of the noise in Steve’s head, the house was quiet and peaceful, the only sounds coming from the ticking clock on the far wall.
Franklin was staring at him. Steve didn’t meet his eyes because he had a feeling Franklin wouldn’t look away.
The last woman was different. She was familiar, and Steve couldn’t figure out why. She had dark brown hair and a whimsical aura about her. Definitely some sort of artist. But Steve had no idea who she was. She was older, but not as old as Tony.
Vision shook his head. “Tony, I tested it.” But he paused, and Tony’s stomach sank. “There is a chance that the spell affects the wine in the glass, put perhaps it is not equipped to maintain its power inside a human body.”
The darkness was a gentle presence as he settled a little deeper into his position on the bed. He thought about how it wasn’t too long ago that he had thought they would spent the rest of forever sharing the same bed. He still thought of his ideal future as one where he woke up beside Tony.  But he understood that wasn’t going to be the case now, and he’d resigned himself to accept it.
