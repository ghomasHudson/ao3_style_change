“Yes, my liege,” Tony said, and hoped not to regret following his heart’s desire as Steve dragged them to his rooms.
Tony choked on his coffee.
Steve remained silent, barely able to contain his surprise. He had expected such a finely armed knight to be a battle-worn soldier, decorated with honors befitting his age and experience, but when the foreigner removed his helm Steve had trouble believing his own eyes.
Soon after they left the king’s chambers, Steve and Antonia called for all those in the castle to gather and listen as they recounted the truths revealed by the satyr.
“I wanted to invite you to my castle, Sir Anthony, to show you around and discuss the possibility of your joining my service.” She stopped even closer to him, watching in delight as realization dawned upon his face. “Let it be known, my knight, that by serving me you would gain not only a rich,
And then he was silent.
“Does he… does he do this a lot?” Steve asked, still baffled.
“Sir Anthony! Sir Anthony!” she called, rushing towards him. “Oh, at last, my dear knight, I have finally found you!”
Steve and Natasha shared a look as they stood up and headed to the elevator, curious to see what JARVIS meant.
Whatever they had been expecting, it definitely wasn’t to find Tony sleeping while draped over Dum-E. The poor bot was beeping anxiously, a fast series of sounds that Steve could only translate as a human screaming, and his claw was shaking with the effort of not letting his creator faceplant into the floor.
At last, the opportunity came for her to converse with the knight, alone and undisturbed, and her plan began to be put into motion.
“I desire nothing else, Your Highness. I would love nothing more than to serve under you, and be granted the privilege of calling you my lord.”
Steve didn’t hesitate as he opened the door, leading the way towards the banquet that was awaiting them.
And then, of course, things had to get weird.
At that, Steve’s eyes snapped towards tony. The knight was tense, his hands fisted so tightly that his knuckles had turned white, and his mouth pressed into a thin, displeased line.
Deborah bowed deeply, face alight with gratitude. “Thank you, my lord.” As she rose again, she allowed a brief smile to slip through her carefully crafted mask, there and vanished once more in a flash. “The man who is responsible for so horribly abusing this innocent girl… he is known as Antonio of Manhattan. The Man of Iron, as he is called on the streets, believed to be hero by all.”
The lady in question breezed into the room not half an hour later, with one of her maidens behind her, and smiled pleasantly as she saw him.
Steve did not know what was in his voice, but the princess did as she was ordered, raising to her feet but refusing to meet his gaze all the same. She was still trembling, curling into herself, and Steve felt a wave of protectiveness crash through him.
“Antonio,” he said, watching as the man stood straighter at the call of his name, shoulders back and proud in the face of peril. The words were as sour as poison on the king’s lips, and yet their truth rang loud and clear. “If indeed you love me, as you make show of doing, and as all people believe, you will now carry out this request. If you succeed, you shall gain the glory of vanquishing a fearsome foe, and you will prove true your apology to Lady Deborah. And should you perish in the attempt, your glory indeed shall be grand, and your honorable name will be forever untarnished.”
Not long set out upon her journey, she became aware of the perils that laid in wait along the path of a young maiden travelling alone. The first time a man tried to put his hands upon her while she slept, her knife ended up embedded in his chest. The second time, three men met their death at the end of her sword, but the fourth one managed to escape with part of her gold. When she almost lost her horse, after two thieves tried to ambush her, she knew that continuing her journey as she was presented far too great a risk.
Antonio’s gaze was unwavering as he spoke his demands, his clever eyes meeting Steve’s with pride and affection, and the king was helpless but to trust him.
From their union three daughters were born, all sharp of intellect, full of grace, and fair as rosebuds in the morning. The first was called Virginia, the second Natalia, and the third Darcy.
Steve himself found his own heart growing fonder and fonder of Tony, as he had taken to calling him, the two of them becoming closer with each passing day. They were often seen together around the castle, whether sparring, walking through the gardens, or discussing battle plans and poetry books alike, one always by the other’s side. Word spread through the land of the king and his knight, brought together by destiny, two souls fated to connect.
“Yes,'” said the satyr.
Antonia let her hands fall from the maiden’s neck. She stared at the crying girl, and felt her own heart constrict with worry and regret.
Biting back a curse, he quickly dressed himself with the help of his servant, barely stopping long enough to grab his cape and the crown before striding towards the throne room. He must have looked particularly displeased – he had, after all, been looking forward to settling in bed after a hard day full of meetings – because the guards hurried to open the doors as soon as they saw him approach. Nodding his thanks, he walked inside and settled (once again) on his throne, gesturing for the knight to be brought in.
Heart beating wildly, Antonia kept her attention on the satyr. “And when you had been brought into the very presence of the king,” she asked, failing at keeping the quiver out of her voice but continuing anyway, “what made you laugh then as if nothing could stop you?'
He opened his eyes, looked at Deborah’s smug expression, and swallowed down the hatred that rose inside him at the sight.
A brief moment passed before the guard’s steps could be heard once more, their noise gradually disappearing as he walked back to his position.
Steve took a step closer, boldness growing in him as he caught sight of the blush gracing Tony’s cheeks.
The girl let go of her with a gasp, looking up at Antonia’s face with wide, terrified eyes, and before Antonia knew what she was doing she had the girl pinned against the wall, her knife pressed against the girl’s throat.
He ordered that Tony be brought what he had requested, and watched with a heavy heart as his knight bid his farewell.
Tony’s eyes snapped up to Steve’s face. he was speechless for a long second, eyes bright as he searched for something in Steve’s expression.
Natasha, of course, had to be the most dramatic of them all. She had found Tony sleeping on the piano in her ballet room, and she had proceeded to pick him up and carry him all the way to his and Steve’s bedroom before unceremoniously dropping him on his sleeping boyfriend. Steve had startled so bad he almost fell off the bed, and she had hissed at him before stomping off.
been raised as a princess until not so many months prior.
to break word with Lady Deborah. Many interesting things have transpired from the satyr’s mouth, and I would give my entire kingdom for the pleasure of seeing her face once we recount the creature’s word.”
Tony snorted at that. “Yeah, I figured, what with all the video proof of you carrying me around like a princess.”
Rather than a man, the newcomer – Antonio – seemed more like a boy barely of age, with a smooth face that looked as though it had yet to see a razor. His dark hair fell around his ears in soft curls, making his cheeks look softer and rounder, and his warm brown eyes were as big as a child’s, yet bright and sharp with intelligence.
Antonio had started with leaving barely there touches on Steve’s arms, then up to his shoulders, and down once again following Steve’s ribs. His touch had grown bolder as he continued, spurred even further by Steve’s soft moans, but his hands never strayed further down than the waist.
Steve turned towards the head of the prison guards. The man bowed deeply, straightening with an apologetic look on his face.
Steve nodded in acknowledgement, dismissing the knight and ordering he be given a room with every necessity he might require, and then Steve quickly said his goodbyes, anxious to retreat to his chambers.
Steven frowns and furrows his brow. There’s something disarming about the way he looks, the way he studies Tony. “I’m not exactly sure how I’m supposed to respond, my lord. As you’ve said repeatedly, we are not friends. Nor are we lovers. We are companions by design. I understand my biology as well as your biology.”
“Yeah, he’s coming. Should arrive by mid-day. He was already in transit when he called,” Bruce says. “I think he might have some info about these seizures.”
“And just what does this pack actually do?” Tony asked. Steve had to admit he felt some modicum of gratitude that Tony threw all the questions at Strange.. Steve was still trying to figure out Keurigs and pocket phones; he’d only been awake a little over a week.
Over the engine sounds and the splash of the ocean around them, Steve says, “Never been to Norway. Went to the hotbed places in the Army.”
“You liked the travel, that’s good. This position might involve some travel. Do you think you could handle that – your family okay with you traveling?” Tony waits, reading the way Steve moves in his seat, the sweat on his brow.
“According to Vision, your lips were blue. You nearly died.”
Tony stayed at the bar across from the lounge. “Drink?” Tony asked as he held up the tumbler of Scotch.
Heading back to the Avengers ship, Steve tries to shake the feeling – but it shudders through him reminding him of those long days on Brooklyn when the dust storms would roll through, and he’d struggle to breathe. His mother’s eyes told the story then – her worry, her concern, and her hidden battle to pretend his difficulties never threw doubt into her mind about his survival. He recognized that fear in her, breaking her apart from the inside out. Even as he turns the corner toward the docks, Steve cannot figure out why this memory came unbidden to him, why it reminds him of his circumstance today. Does it mean that he’s frightened for himself or for Tony.
There’s laughter in his voice. “Just so you know, I’m not at all bothered.”
Tony slings his canteen across his shoulders, and then shoves the rest of the meat into his mouth, giving Steve a smile that harkens back to ones he’s seen on Peter. Steve only rolls his eyes and they pack up the horses to go. In minutes they are headed out toward the river. It takes a good two hours to hit the basin and then it becomes a steep edged climb down to the shores of the river. During the ride over to the water, the storm breaks and the weather becomes foul.
“I noticed,” Tony says. “It’s quite remarkable.”
During that summer though, Stark Industries had invited a number of promising interns – post-doctoral fellows to train at the complex. Most ended up working with Tony. A few were in the bio-division. One woman, a young twenty something year old, used to sit in the common area outside to eat her lunch. She sat alone and most of the time looked distant and too cold to approach. One day, though, she sat there curled over her sandwich chewing but Tony guessed not even tasting it. He wasn’t the kind of kid with a lot of empathy, but he had fought with Howard the night before and he wanted some distance. He ended up sitting next to her at the picnic table outside the large buildings. She side eyed him but didn’t say anything. He didn’t have a lunch with him. He just wanted space. He remembered thinking that he should have just gone alone on the walking path around complex. But then she spoke.
“But Clint was all right?” Steve asks.
“Not really. I’m taking a flight home tonight,” Clint said and that only brought up the fascinating subject of where home was for Clint. It wasn’t like Steve ever really spent much time with the archer. Except for the Battle of New York and a few meetings following the victory, Clint had been absent. Natasha only told Steve that Clint had been undergoing long term treatment for PTSD and traumatic brain injury due to the after effects of Loki’s mind control. Steve left it at that – Clint’s business and his health was his own. Steve never liked people butting into his illnesses when he was young, so he refused to do it now.
“He knows I’m free,” Steve states.
“Eight tomorrow morning.”
“You feel a little distant,” Tony said, and Steve recognized the concern in his tone.
Tony had to concede that point so he nodded to Natasha. “Wheel the gurney and keep him quiet. He wakes up and thrashes around.”
He walks up the scorched steps and finds his way to the little apartment. The stench of fire lingers even though it has been months. He can taste it in the air. He shoves his hands deep in his pockets and feels the moments again, how very strong and crazy Bucky was.
“I know who you are, and this isn’t it!” Steve says but his pulse screams in his vessels and his ears roar with it. “None of this is true Tony. You have to believe me.” The pounding in his cheekbone spears through his skull like a dagger, the pain growing with each passing minute.
Sam huffs out an angry breath and marches out of the room. Cho moves aside and pulls the curtain that separates the beds. Steve’s still under, still part of the virtual game.
Not knowing exactly what to say, Tony approaches with caution and calls, “I’m here to help. The bad guys are all gone.”
“Or you could just be you,” Steve says. “I don’t know. I think we all like to pretend we’re someone else. It’s like if you were a superhero, would you tell the world, or would you hide it. Stand up there and say I am Iron Man, or would you keep it hidden? Which? How would you hide it?”
Steve frowns. Tony’s too keyed up to sleep. It’s going to be a long night – he peers at the light sneaking in through the blinds – or day. Steve’s gotten to the point where he’s overly tired and probably won’t be able to sleep himself, especially with the hell of guilt eating away at his brain. His brain circles his absolute disgust with himself that he would masturbate to images of his boss. He wants to pound his head against the wall to knock some sense into it.
Arctica-1e.
“Logan.” Tony waits to hear what Bruce has to say. “Well?” He sips the tea. He doesn’t like tea. Why is he pretending? He gags a little, smiles, and blinks a few times as he sets the mug onto the table.
“This is what a degree in fine arts gets you, Rogers,” Steve says. Bucky used to bait him all the time about his degree. Not that he was mocking him, but Bucky had always been more practical about his life choices. Look he picked Sam – or Sam picked him.
Steve furrowed his brows. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
“That doesn’t make sense,” Steve said. “Stars are just suns very far away.”
Tony had huddled away from his father, sobbing quiet tears. It had been Jarvis who appeared at his bedroom door when his father left. He collected Tony and gave him an ice pack for his bruised cheek.
Steve crosses his arms. “I suppose you would do that and that’s why you know.”
“I want, I want to hold you?” Steve said and sidled closer but didn’t dare to embrace Tony.
Tony adjusted himself and sat up to see Steve. “When you’ve been abducted and tortured for months you start to think about ways to ensure that you’re never without your weapons. They ruined my heart, Steve. It wasn’t a choice in my book.”
Tony shakes his head. “Probably not. The conjuring ability can’t be accessed in Ultron controlled reality. It still exists as part of the roleplay but it’s just not here. Sorry.”
“Howard – well, let’s just say, he kind of – he propositioned me.” Steve’s cheeks turn bright red and it’s not from the heat of the fire.
Tony closes his eyes and shakes his head. “I don’t think that’s in the cards. Let’s get to this store you’re talking about.” He leaves behind the hope and Steve sees the joy dissipate from Tony’s face. Steve observes the shields close down on Tony’s expression; his engagement separates from the people around him. He’s always been set apart from people.
“No,” Tony protests, but his attempts to move are uncoordinated and feeble.
No. He wants to say no, he wants to pledge that. He wants the High Alpha Chair to change things, but still he’s wrapped up in the caste living, in his biology even now. He’s fallen back into what he was taught to do. He keeps thinking that the basics of it is right. Biology tells him that as alpha he is superior. He’s taken on the ways of the alpha, on the culture. It’s been years since he lived free of it. He can’t say he doesn’t like the benefits of being an alpha with a family name and a Prime at that. Even his status of dom puts him a step ahead of everyone. The power, the potential – it’s heady like a drug. He needs that – his body is addicted to the hit. It gives him the sense of freedom and power that taking a hit did, or a drink, or a good fuck. But he wants to do good with it. And then he looks at the drop of blood on his fingertip.
“Well, as CEO I don’t see how that’s even an issue anymore. It’s not temporary Pepper, I told you that. I need someone to pay attention to the administration and logistics. I’m a scientist and idea man. You know that.” Tony bops her on the nose. She bats him away.
“Up you go,” Tony says and he hoists Steve onto his feet.
“Why aren’t you worried about Jane or better yet, Clint. Clint gave up his family for you,” Tony snapped. He regretted the words as soon as he said them, but the flood couldn’t be dammed. “I didn’t mean-.”
Steve’s not sure how to react to Tony’s word and he’s partially happy that he can’t, that his face feels numb and the words he tries to formulate muddle in his mouth. Seconds later, Tony moves away from the gurney. Steve listens to the gears of the armor whiz and hiss as Cho’s technicians begin to hook up electrodes onto Steve’s chest. He already has IV’s in place.
Tony’s need.
She has a tablet in her hand. “Steve is fine. How will you be paying?”
Peggy seemed to read his thoughts. “Whatever they did to you, Steve, it isn’t your fault. Don’t let them win. You can’t.” She started toward the door, but he stopped her.
“I think you’re ready. Are you ready?” He strokes a hand up his inner thigh. “Are you ready.”
“I suppose this is over then.” He scowls at Steve.
“I think you mean in the sea,” Steve says.
They stepped into the elevator. The guard passed his identification card over the scanner and the elevator closed. “Hope you’re not claustrophobic. The lab and prison level is down below.”
“This we will do together,” Steve says. He lies back on the recliner and Tony takes it as an invitation. He crawls up onto Steve’s lap, curling his head against his chest and listening to his heartbeat.
“Okay, I get it, I get it,” Tony said but his expression looked glorious and his smile beamed in the moonlight. “I hope you know you’re, you’re important to me outside of this whole soul pack thing. I mean, it might have taken longer to get here but I have to believe.”
“What do you mean?”
“I see more than a playboy, more than a technocrat, more than an alpha in you. You’re willing to hear me,” Steven says and his hands are on either side of Tony’s face. He could crush Tony in an instant. But he doesn’t. He draws him to the gland and says, “Drink.”
And as soon as he started doing it, he found himself loving it.
Antonia opened her mouth to reply, ready to lie and spare herself, but her vow of loyalty to her king gave her pause. She hesitated, and then sighed, her shoulders dropping in defeat. “No, sire. The guard speaks nothing but the truth. Yet, my lord, I still plead my innocence: I did not violate that girl, and the reasons for what the knight has heard are not the ones Lady Deborah has accused me of.”
From that moment on, things just got weirder.
(Natasha took a picture of the scene, with Steve clutching his chest in the background. Steve looked somewhere between “I’m having a heart attack right now, currently, at this moment” and “I have just seen the most precious thing my eyes have ever laid upon.” Tony didn’t say anything when they showed him the picture, smirking and shrugging his way through the conversation. The next day, the photo was framed on his workbench.)
Steve nodded. “Your loyalty knows to end, my knight. I would be pleased to aid you in this endeavor, if you’d allow me.”
Steve had been certain, when Tony had left the castle, that he was never going to see him again. He had been plagued by the fears which his own fantasy had provided, robbing him of sleep and following him even after he woke: Antonio would have valiantly fought against the beasts, but inevitably perished in the effort. In his final moments, his last thoughts would have strayed towards Steve; whether their nature was loving or not, Steve hadn’t yet decided. Then, after a few days without hearing from Tony, Steve would have sent out a search party, who would have inevitably come back empty-handed, and Steve would have grieved the loss of his love, who he had yet to confess his feelings to.
If Tony was still awake, Steve was going to drag him to bed with him.
The guard bowed before Steve and then began speaking. “Yesterday night, I bore witness to this maiden entering Sir Antonio’s chambers. After but a few minutes, I was alerted by the sound of a girl’s crying and something breaking, and hurried to request assistance if needed. Sir Antonio dismissed me without allowing me to enter, and a few minutes later the girl ran out his chamber, in tears and with her clothing in disarray.”
“Good morning, beloved,” Tony said, the raspiness and deepness of his voice doing wonderful things to Steve’s libido.
Tony grinned, amused by the turn of phrase. “Of course, my liege. Who am I to deny my king’s desires?”
Once inside the forest, Antonia dismounted her horse and tied him a little ways off the main path, leaving some water and food for him to eat, and quickly made her way further inside the forest, carrying what she had requested to the king.
Meanwhile, Antonia silently followed Steve into his chambers, where just a few hours prior they had been sharing a bed, and tried not to despair in the face of her king’s anger.
“Never with anyone. I have never… I’ve never had the chance of knowing such pleasures in my youth, and afterwards-”
Tony blushed and shook his head.
But knowing Tony, and judging by how much Pepper had been swearing when she had called him, he had probably spent the last three days trying to contain whatever mess his company had been in.
He walked over to the table, staring at Tony for a beat before bending down to pick up the cup of coffee and placing it on the countertop. He turned around to look at Tony, gently pushing him around until he was lying on his back. Tony flopped to the side like a puppet, snoring softly.
His relief was shattered when the lady spoke again. “I have proof of my word, my lord.”
Realization hit Antonia so suddenly that she almost faltered, suddenly lightheaded. She quickly hurried towards the girl, who tensed up even more, bracing herself as though awaiting violence, and it broke Antonia’s heart. She stopped a few paces away from the girl, crouching down to face the kneeling maiden.
The next time it happened, Steve was chilling out with Natasha in the common room, talking quietly and gossiping a bit, when JARVIS interrupted them.
“Ok,” Steve sighed, “I have dealt with weirder things. This is fine.”
With a nod, she opened the door just enough to let the girl in before quickly closing it behind her. Antonia didn’t waste time in locking it: she had no intention of entertaining the girl for long.
“Because I love you,” Steve said easily, with no hesitation, “and I like to be able to take care of you. I like that you trust me enough to be vulnerable with me, and I like to be able to protect you.”
Sir Antonio also revealed his true identity, causing shock and astonishment to spread throughout the crowd, but the people soon rejoiced at the news, and it is said that for hours the streets were filled with great chants and celebrations in the name of Dame Antonia, the Woman of Iron.
Ever so gently, he placed a hand on her jaw, and tilted her head up. Her eyes snapped to his, full of despair, and at the same time hardened by the same pride and determination that Antonio had always possessed. Steve knew, in that moment, that if he were to banish Antonia from his life, she would not have allowed it to break her.
By endeavoring to send Antonio on an errand of this sort, the cunning Lady Deborah had hoped to be the cause of Antonio's demise.
Her long black hair was cut roughly with a sharp knife. Her breasts were hidden and flattened by a tight bandage. And, after giving a blacksmith most of her remaining gold to be allowed for a day in his workshop, her armor was easily modified to better fit her new appearance: slightly wider at the shoulders, and with straighter lines to add a bit of bulk, nothing more than a handful of changes with the intent of tricking the eye without sacrificing neither the armor’s strength nor its efficiency.
The sound of boots hurrying in the corridor gave Antonia pause.
After bidding farewell to Ana and Jarvis, Antonia donned her finest armor and packed her favored weapons, readied her most beloved possessions, provisioned herself from the castle stores, saddled her horse, and set forth from Manhattan, alone and determined to follow whatever road fortune might lay open to her feet.
Thus the noble Antonia, in recompense for her loyalty and her valor, became a queen and lived long with Steve her husband. Forever one by the other’s side.
The elevator doors opened before Steve could ask anything, so he walked out and opened his mouth just as JARVIS chimed in. “In the kitchen, Captain.”
The servants moving around the castle jumped out of the king’s way, worriedly noting his bleak expression and Sir Antonio’s desperate eyes. Whispers moved through the castle of a fight between the two, reaching even the ears of Lady Deborah, who gleefully laughed, as she believed her plan to have succeeded.
Steve himself wasn’t feeling too well, because Tony looked
He swiveled around to meet Tony’s gaze, but the knight was avoiding his eyes. He made to open his mouth and ask for an explanation, but Antonio interjected before he could even begin.
“I won’t, Sir, I won’t, please, I swear, Sir,” the girl pleaded, gasping in between sobs. “I’m so sorry, please, I’m so sorry Sir…”
“Steve, I…” Tony began, his expression soft yet conflicted. “I would love nothing more, but I still- I don’t, I…” he huffed, flustered, as his words seemed to fail him. “I, too, have been thinking of naught but your lips upon mine, yearning to feel the touch of your hands, but I still cannot bring myself to… to make love to you.”
“Well then, Antonio, what were the reasons for the girl’s cries?”
“Antonia, my dear daughter, the time has now come to see you married, and…” Howard heaved a deep sigh, feeling the weight of his shortcomings bear upon his shoulders. Maria, always the most caring of souls, placed her hand upon his own, silently giving him her support and lending him her strength.
He asked himself if knowing that his beloved Antonio was in truth a woman changed the way his heart longed for her: it didn’t. He asked himself if he could blame her: he couldn’t. Looking into her eyes, and seeing the desperation which burned underneath them, he asked himself if he believed in her love for him: he did.
“Speak, soldier.”
to clarify why Tony was just… laying there.
“Apologies for the interruption, my lord. May I come in?”
“I just-” Tony hesitated, biting his lips as he avoided Steve’s gaze. “I’ve seen the recordings, and you look so happy whenever I’m asleep and you carry me to bed. Why?”
She fell silent with a sob, her desperate words hanging in the quiet of the room.
Always by each other’s side.
Antonio bowed again in gratitude, a brilliant smile lighting his face.
“Your Majesty, I have no words to express my gratitude for everything you’ve done for me. You have allowed me to pursue my passions, regardless of their unusual nature, and you have granted me the freedom to become the woman that stands in front of you today. I know how hard you have tried to provide me with a worthy husband in spite of your lack of resources, and I know in my heart that all you wish is for me to be happy. But...” She faltered, noting the sadness dawning on her parents’ eyes. “But I cannot accept your proposal. You, Father, have raised four daughters, three of whom you have married in the most honorable fashion to three wonderful kings picked by their own hand, and yet you wish to dispose of me, one who has never sought marriage, in an ignoble alliance that benefits no one but a lowly Marquis. This is why I tell you, dear Father, that I will never take a husband unless I so desire, like my three sisters did, and that if such a day should never come then I shall wear the crown upon my own head and build my kingdom from scratch.”
“Who’s there?” she asked instead.
As soon as their bodies pressed against each other’s, they both froze.
The man was clad in the most beautiful armor Steve had ever seen, smooth and shiny even after what had to have been a long journey, and colored the most incredible shade of crimson, almost glowing in the candlelight as the man moved forward. His stride was proud and confident, the steps of a man who was in his element and who had nothing to fear. The knight’s sword was sheathed, his hand resting on its pommel with the ease and familiarity of a soldier. Steve had the sudden longing to draw the stranger, to capture such beauty upon paper, and the desire was so abrupt and unexpected that he almost gasped.
Many winters ago, the city and its castle were under the rule of a king known by the name of Howard Stark, a brilliant and cunning man. At the height of his reign, Howard, in his desire to have an heir to his kingdom, took for his queen Maria, then the princess of the Kingdom of Italia: a lady who was said to be as ethereal as the moon itself, the most beautiful of all her peers, and delightfully talented in many of the Arts.
reward, but you would also be the receiver of the reverence and respect of my court.”
As soon as Steve’s eyes fell upon the stranger, all the air rushed form his lungs.
“A kitten,” Tony repeated, unimpressed.
Steve would go down to the workshop, finding Tony either lying on the couch or bent uncomfortably over the workbench, and walked over to him. Tony always seemed to recognize Steve when he picked him up and happily snuggled closer to his boyfriend with a neediness he carefully never showed when he was awake. Being granted that much trust made Steve’s heart swell with pride and love, and he cherished every second of it.
“My lady, your offer is received with gratitude, but the obligation which binds me to my lord the king ties my obedience to his will and his will alone. Therefore, I pray you bear me no ill will, though I cannot enter into your service, and I pray you accept as the reason for my refusal the desire to serve my lord until death, or until he no longer wishes to keep me as his loyal servant.”
Howard begged the gods to avoid his daughter’s rage, and continued.
The mission had been exhausting.
“Hm,” Steve hummed, fighting back a smile, “I wouldn’t call you a princess. A kitten, maybe.”
So yeah, Steve loved watching Tony sleep, and he loved carrying him to bed, for no reason other than he enjoyed taking care of him.
“I forgive you, my love,” he sighed, hugging her tight in his arms as she exhaled a shaking breath. “We will again need to discuss this, but I do not hate you for what you’ve done. Now – and this is not a question which holds any trickery, my love – but who will leave this room, willing to face the rest of the kingdom? Antonio, or Antonia?”
her young servant to Antonio, but she had then proceeded to accuse the knight of raping her!
Once she was done, she climbed up into a thick-leaved tree which stood nearby, and waited to see what might happen next.
“No, I am invoking something that’s called Alpha Privilege. Since you are bonded to me – well everyone still thinks you are since you announced it – I can invoke Alpha Privilege.” He raises his eyebrows as if anything he’s talking about should make sense to Steve and he should be grateful for it. What it does is only charge the atmosphere with more frustration and anger.
It’s Steve’s horse that makes the mistake.
Using the tree to brace himself, Tony gets up. His body shudders. The adrenalin of fear courses through him. He is going to have to take his chances with the poppy field farmers. He cannot stay with a wild lion. His brain is addled. There’s no other explanation. He takes a step, but then he hears the distinct rattle of metal alloy. He spins around, terrified and panicked. Blu stands there with the entirety of the armor in his mouth. The lion glances at Tony and then starts to walk toward the path they found to the stream.
“What? He slipped? What happened?” Rhodes sounds irritated, even angry at Steve.
“Yes.” Tony grips Steve’s legs. “Please tell me you’ll give me this chance. Please.”
Without a word, Steven is finally on his knees with his neck arched allowing Tony access to his bonding gland. It is well known that the secretions of the gland truly are an elixir. The immunological studies attest to the fact. Steven’s bonding gland is particularly sweet to Tony’s tongue. He leans in, grasps Steven’s shoulders and drinks from the gland. He feels a slight tremor run through the omega. In the recent century drinking the elixir frequently came into practice and, before Tony drank Steven’s, he had thought it a nasty tradition. But the truth is, he’s never felt as vital or strong. It’s addictive to be sure.
“I thought I went to like-.” Steve stops and cannot think of any better words. “Like an auction. I go to the blocks and alphas bid.”
“I mean I literally bit you and we mated without your consent. The kids these days would be all over us because of it,” Tony said. He knew he was just tossing about other subjects to talk about other than the impending meeting with Ross. Tony both wanted to know and hated the idea of finding out what the cretin wanted.
“Morgan!” Her father says.
At his statement, Steven walks with confidence at Tony’s side. If Tony hadn’t known better he would have assumed that there was nothing wrong with Steven. Of course, those enhanced healing capabilities engineered into all omega warriors help, he assumes. As they enter into the Main Conference building, they walk through the large glass and metal atrium. The floor is a marbled tile mosaic depicting the Great Purge. Steven scans it with a harsh glint in his eyes but says nothing. He is impeccable in his duty. Several of the other alphas are clutched in a corner of the atrium near a counter where Tony’s servants are offering mid-day refreshments.
“Covert as in Hydra,” Steve said. “And how do the twins fit in?”
“Go then. Do that,” Steve says and notices the sheets strewn all over the floor. Tony grunts and drools and then clenches his teeth as if he’s fighting his own body. Slowly the seizure ends, and Steve catches a pillowcase and brings it over to wipe away the spittle. Tony flops back and his sightless eyes roam the room. Steve keeps talking. “I’m right here, Tony. You’re not alone. Do you feel my hand? I’m right here.”
“Do you not like the Asgardians?” Tony says as he motions for the footman to clear his plate. “Thor is a very jovial man. Asgard fell on some terrible years centuries ago, but he’s weathered it. Seems the Asgardians are somewhat immortal or very long lived.”
“Can I at least be sorry for disturbing you?”
“From what I hear, no it is not.” He smiles because Peggy still writes him on occasion.
“I’m going to murder, Obie.”
Steve quirked an eyebrow at him but took the large cup with straw from the counter, thanking the man. Sam ushered them over to a seating area for the gym. Steve took a chair and settled as Sam sat across from him. They sipped their drinks before Sam said, “How are you holding up?”
“Please Captain, please help him.” She’s weeping for her husband. It’s right out of a novel. Ultron’s learned human emotions, how to manipulate them, but not how to feel them.
“At least take some iron pills,” Tony said now as he reached out to the drawer of the night table to pull out the package he always kept there for Steve. “Take four. I know the package says one, but you metabolize faster. So take more.”
Strange enters the surgical suite and once again goes over the procedure. It won’t be anything more than what they do when they replace the lens during cataract surgery, though they will have to inject into the vitreous humor in the back of the eye. The pre-programmed Pym nanotech particles will be injected and then they will migrate to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. Once they invade the nerve, they will start to accumulate and then build a bridge from the eye to the brain’s optic center near the back of the skull. It’s estimated it will take 7 days for the nanotech particles to do their job.
Tony fiddled with his tie. He wasn’t used to wearing decent clothing anymore. During his time as a vampire, he dressed low profile since he spent most of his time wandering the streets or securely in his laboratory at one of his safe houses tinkering away for the good of a company he legally no longer owned. The jacket around his shoulders constricted and he swore to hell and back that the tie was trying to strangle him. He heard the shower in the ensuite bathroom switch off and Tony cursed again. They’d flown to Vienna with the official Wakanda delegation to an emergency meeting of the United Nations Council on Vampire-Human Affairs.
Once Clint and his daughter are out of sight, Steve turns to Tony and yanks him around the corner of the house. “Can he hear us?”
The endearment – Captain my Captain – sounded forced, rang false somehow when Tony whispered it into his ear after his brush with Ultron, death by Mjolnir, resurrection, and resulting loss of memories. Steve ignored it, or tried to but it became more and more evident that Tony was groping around, searching for purchase, for some link to his former life and failing.
“I could instruct you on a whole lot of other things,” Tony whispers as his tongue dances along Steve’s ear. “Lots of other things, more important things.” He blows against his ear.
Instead, he sunk onto the riverbank and reached out along the other bonds he had just tried to splice away from him. He found them strong and hurt but still there. Grappling, Steve tugged and comforted himself with the constant knowledge they were still there, they were coming for him, his pack. All was not lost. He released his grip on reality, collapsing into the void that reminded him of the hell within his nightmares.
Great, now he had to look good on top of everything else. He brushed back his hair with his fingers and wiped at his eyes before he turned to the large, overhanging screen on the back wall of his laboratory. Whoever called was far too close to the camera – Tony got a good look up the person’s nostrils.
He’s drunk with insanity, that’s the only thing Tony can chalk it up to. There cannot be anything growing out of Steve’s back. That’s idiotic, insane. Unless Raza has some crazy assed scientist experimenting on the Army grunt.
Tony.
The prince places his hands on the keys. The silence grows. The weight of the cock on Steve’s tongue anchors him. In an abrupt explosion the music sings through the room. It thunders through chords and octaves. Tony uses the whole keyboard like he’s possessed, and Steve finds himself sucking and swallowing in time with the music. Tony keeps his hips absolutely still. He moans as he follows the course of the music, every now and then he tosses his head back and cries out with uncontained want. It’s enough that Steve’s own body vibrates with the music. His abused cock perks up with interest and he moans against Tony’s erection.
He jerks around to find Steve standing in the hallway right outside his door. “Hmm. Yeah?”
After he finishes serving the food, Steve tucks into the meal and eats with a flourish that Tony envies. Ever since he was a child and his father would admonish his mother for the slightest deviance from her diet, Tony always had an issue with food. Filling himself harkened back to those times.
Steve scowled but swallowed once and his jaw twitched before he rasped out a reply, “I’m sorry that I inferred being gay meant you were a pervert. I didn’t intend that at all.”
“I don’t. I don’t even know you,” Bucky said. His voice sounded strangled as if every word fought to get out, to push past his training. “Look at you. You’re -you’re with him. You let him fuck you.”
“Sit. Samantha will be right with you.”
Steven has gone to his knees in front of Tony, his head down. There’s a slight quake to his shoulders.
“I thought we might like some wine, too.” Tony crashes into Steve, holding onto him and burying his face in his shoulder. “Hey, hey. What’s this?”
“What? Did I imply something about size? At all?” Steve laughs and it feels good to let loose and not think about the ache that’s settled into his chest under his sternum, the ache that’s become a beast rattling around and thrumming his heart every time he looks at the prince.
Or a hallucination’s final message.
“Are you sure?”
“You are almost through your heat,” he says as he wipes Steve down with the other towel. “But not quite done.”
“What’s that?”
Steve smiles wryly. “I don’t think that’s in the cards for me, Tony.”
“See Pepper, this is a mystery that we must solve,” Tony says and glares at her. She presses her lips together as if she’s going to hold her line, but then crumples when he gives her that puppy look.
“Say something, I can’t read your face and your breathing hasn’t changed or anything.”
Bucky swung open the door. He managed to look a little contrite – so did the rest of the team.
Tony shrugged. “I’m kind of stuck with you, considering you are my soul bonded Beloved or whatever. Am I Beloved for the whole company? I mean does the whole pack think of me that way?”
They check their meager weapons and then the ship swoops into a low arc toward the ground. The trees skirt it, whipping against the hull, lashing the windshield. “Here we go,” Clint says and then Bucky hears the release of the locks on the belly of the ship.
“Has it felt wrong all those times in the dream?” she asked. Her hand remained on his shoulder. It felt real and tender.
“Not now.” He could have asked for a vampire to please, please save him. He could have begged for Shuri to perform some magical scientific intervention to bring his friend back to him. Nothing mattered. It wasn’t their responsibility. Steve had done this – Steve had left Sam to fend for himself, thinking that saner minds would prevail.
One of the Padawans had become his closest friend. They spent hours together even when the Jedi Scholar of the Archive admonished him for taking Steven away from his studies. He would apologize and Steve would find his way back to his small room to learn the ways of the Force again.
“Just what are you doing, Tony?” Howard had asked as Tony sat at the foot of his wide double bed. The footboard acted as his console, the helm of his mighty ship. He had a captain’s hat on as he used an old frisbee as his steering wheel for the helm of his boat.
Grimacing, Steve dons the boots. His journey to Prime Station gave him quite enough experience with low gravity and high gravity fluctuations. He doesn’t want to vomit in front of the prince.
Instead of staying, Steve left and spent the rest of the day making arrangements for the whole pack sans Peggy to attend the meeting tomorrow morning. It meant getting Sam to New York City. It wasn’t a difficult task, but he felt like he was intruding on his friend’s daily life.
He’s across the room before he even takes a breath and grabs the coffee mug from Steve’s hands. He sips it and it’s made to perfection. Sighing, he says, “How’d you know how I like my coffee? And where did you get the most perfect creamer ever?”
The realization dawns on Tony. It’s true. He’d wanted to protect Steve from the awful truth of what Barnes had done. Knowing that someone you trusted and loved as a family member would do such hideous things struck close to Tony’s heart. He’d automatically wanted to save the pain from hurting Steve as well. The stark revelation heals a small part of him inside, that part that suffered so much when he learned that his mother had not died from an accidental auto accident but had been murdered. A small bit of his pain recedes.
“Yeah, that’d be good.”
He leaves the mansion, making sure not to turn back or listen to find out if his omega puts up a resistance or fight. He keeps his mind stalwart and his vision on the beautifully groomed shrubbery and flowering bushes. He continues forward, down the path toward the Conference building, counting the steps as he goes, trying not to think about how they will strip Steven of his jacket and shirt, how he will be tied to the old punishment post near the barns, how he will be whipped with a cane enough times to bleed.
“I am assuming you’ve ridden before?” Tony hadn’t thought about whether Steve knows how to drive a motorcycle.
“Let us help, Tony,” Bruce said. “I’m the Healer of the group. Do you want to talk to me first? Alone?” He pointed in the direction of the hallway. Tony surmised that a waiting room or somewhere private must be that way.
Steve swallowed back his reply and only nodded in response. Her heels clicked all the way down the hallway as she left. He didn’t move out of the bedroom then. He sank back down on the bed to sit and then his entire body followed. Lying on the bed, splayed out, he closed his eyes and saw the dreams again. He walked amongst new people and new worlds now. That place of his youth had been a myth, a tale that mothers tell their children so they won’t be scared in their own home. But this new place, these new hopes and dreams, presented a new dawning, new possibilities for the future. It meant releasing the fantasy of the past. His naïve beliefs of the good of the people within his own government. It meant betraying his government.
“I’m sorry. I’ll go.” Steve backpedals but then Tony calls out to him. “Yes?”
“But he makes the rules,” Steve grunts out. He can see the edge of the cliff. They’re almost there.
Barnes is too smart to read it as a ploy, but he pretends to accept the deference Tony offers. “When he was younger, he was too sick to worry about it. He never went into heat. After Rebirth, he went into heat almost immediately. Or at least that’s what I’m told. Phillips wasn’t too keen on it. Sent him away. The military got him on some pretty strong illegal suppressants. The rest is history, I think.” He shrugs. “What the hell does it matter?”
Steve agrees though he hasn’t a clue why one Door would be easier than another Door to use. Right now, he needs Tony on his side and thinking beyond the catastrophic failure of the entrance. They have to get moving and toward the outer rim.
She smirked but Steve interrupted, “Natasha’s right. We need to hustle. So, Sam-.” He extended his hand and relaxed his thoughts, letting the Mantra fade as he grasped the other man’s forearm. Sam followed suit. It would happen in seconds, if it was to be. Steve recalled the first time he’d met Sam how he’d felt the faintest flickering spark. As he opened his Core and allowed his astral projection freedom, he experienced the resonance, full and synchronized almost immediately.
Tony makes a grunting noise and then paws the air with his free hand. Steve captures his hand and brings it to his own chest with the other one. “I’m right here. You can feel my heart beating.” It feels like it might burst out of his chest. He holds back his terror – and the litany in his head – why didn’t he stop Tony? Why didn’t he make him wait? “Just hold on Tony.” He tries not to circle around to the idea of brain damage, of how Tony isn’t even speaking, of how lost and frantic he looks.
“I’d think so,” Steve says.
Something tingles deep inside Steve and when he gives Tony a sidelong glance, he sees the same hunger etched on his face as well. Steve is well and truly fucked. Luke leads them into the room and Tony steps through with Steve at his side.
Steve closes his eyes even as Sam tells him not to – he doesn’t listen. He hears something else, something far away. And she’s standing there in that red dress with red lipstick and her hair done. All he can think about when Peggy walks into that tavern is that he would have fallen on his knees and begged to submit to her. She was an alpha but she wasn’t a dom. She treated him with respect and dignity and he could have had a normal life. She’s standing there with the red dress on and promises in her hair. There’s mist around her and she’s whispering in his ear.
In the moments that Steve’s allowed by the motion of the ship, he glimpses the sheer greatness of the Avengers starship. It’s unlike any battle cruiser or carrier that Steve’s ever seen or read about. It’s unbelievably large. It speaks to how very little that Steve’s seen of the ship. “How big is your ship?”
“I’ll be here when you wake up,” Tony says. He finishes up the first aid and then Steve turns over and falls deeply asleep. Watching him, Tony analyses what he’s learned – escape, Nick Fury. Someone is after them and they haven’t gone to the police. What has Tony tumbled into that involves Captain America and a gang of sick people. Why are they sick? What happened to them?
Tony slides onto the side of the bed with Steve. “I want. I really want, Steve.”
The hands are steady and strong. The voice is soft and kind. He doesn’t deserve either. “Come. Let me help you into bed.”
It had been the month after Bucky was frozen that Steve found himself in the Grand Library of the Palace. Not many were allowed entrance in the back room of the library, but T’Challa arranged for him to have a day in the library after finding him roaming the halls of the Palace with a worn out look on his face and little spring to his step.
The first few days at the cabin end up being difficult, but Steve keeps telling himself that Tony needs time to adjust, to accept himself. Without the glasses, Tony becomes almost sullen, even angry at times. There were many days in the past that Tony didn’t use the glasses, mainly due to their detrimental effects on his health. Steve discovers that this is different, Tony’s processing something he’d never given himself to deal with in all the years since the accident. Even trying to contemplate the idea of being in denial for that long doesn’t compute with Steve, but then he’s not the one to deal with it. He shouldn’t judge.
It took a doughnut shop and Tony losing the armor to Rhodey for things to finally resolve. Her friend and boss, Fury was there with her. It didn’t escape him that this man was probably the same Fury that Steve spoke about all those months ago. Even when he was introduced to the man with the patch, when he heard his name Tony’s heart drop into his stomach and all the pain and trauma that revolved around his memories of Steve came back. At that time he hadn’t known Steve was still alive.
“The implications,” Tony mutters. “Reality entanglement.”
They had all looked to Steve. Every single person turned to silently ask him should they believe Tony, should they trust him after all Ultron had been Tony’s (and Bruce’s) creation. Even Vision had turned away from his creator and questioned Steve without speaking at all.
The dreams turn, of course. Dark, hollow, and angry filled with remorse and pain. He sees a world of ashes – people blowing into ashes before him and knows he’s lost. As a warrior, the Silver Knight, should never lose. But in these dreams, he’s not the Silver Knight. He’s a hero with a shield of red, white, and blue. A star sits on his chest and he fights to do right. But he fails.
Trying to loosen up is a losing battle. “Not really. I usually don’t dance.”
Dealing with what Bucky may think of his status can wait another day or two. He checks the time and figures he doesn’t have a lot of it before Pepper returns and he’ll be expected to accompany Tony to the luncheon. His stomach growls and that just won’t do.
Steve shakes his head and looks out at the clouds. “No. I’m fine.” He pauses before he changes the subject and adds, “You must like to fly.”
Talking to Natasha helped to a degree. He still needed to figure his way around his feelings, or through them. The problem stemmed from the fact that he didn’t know what his feelings were. Truth be told, throughout the months away from Tony, Steve had experienced other moments that called to him as if he had a bond with Tony. But their bonding failed and failed miserably. Somedays it was a ghostly feeling as if lost a limb and a phantom physicality called to him. Other times, it grounded closer to reality as if Tony stood right in front of him. He hated to admit it to himself, but touching Tony in that dream shower sequence, bringing him to an excited, exasperated state of yearning, turned Steve on. Even as he lie in his bed, recalling those moments, he hardened.
“That doesn’t mean it was happy. But why didn’t you go back to Peggy?”
“Getting crucified will do that to you,” Tony growled and jerked away from her probing hand. “Just leave us the fuck alone.”
“Mister Stark, do you think it would be possible for you to sign the consent form? We need to operate, immediately.”
Steve blushes and puts a hand to his face. He feels a little flush. Maybe a little distraction is just what he needs. He knows it’s exactly what the prince needs. “You’re quite the playboy, aren’t you?”
Blu groans like he’s exasperated with Tony, stands up, and walks into the dark. While Tony worked the sun had dropped below the horizon and twilight descended. The tiny circle of light puddling out from the arc reactor affords him little to no security in this wilderness.”
“Good lord!” Jarvis rubbed Tony’s back. “That’s just a fairy tale. They’re trying to scare you, Anthony.”
“You are not, sir,” JARVIS says. “Unless it happens to be a juvenile dragon, sir. I would imagine a dragon would be much larger in size.”
Tony wipes his hair back from his face. “Steve, what is it? What’s wrong?” Fear roils in his belly. He pushed too far too fast. “What’s wrong?”
He regards her silent admonishment, shrugs, stoppers the crystal decanter, and then says, “Maybe later. Come, Sheriff, sit.”
Preview for Chapter 4 - we're back to present day Steve and Tony (trigger warning for self-harm)
“Years?” Tony said and that surprise in his voice perked up Steve’s interest. Of course, years seemed ridiculous to Steve too, but the fact that Tony showed any bit of concern about a process gave Steve a sense of satisfaction that he couldn’t parse.
Reluctantly, Steve pulls the blankets down and through bleary eyes, focuses on Tony. “Cho?”
Clint laughs and pours the coffee. “Sugar?”
“No, no, it’s not you, it’s-.”
“This was always the plan. Go.” Steve trembles and the light, that blur aura Tony witnessed before reappears. It’s weaker, so much weaker, and it throbs a purple color turning to blue as Steve’s condition deteriorates.
When the door clicked shut and Steve pulled the curtains to the windows, Tony said, “I worried about you.”
When the Silver Knight finds his way to wakefulness, a tightness constricts his throat and a woman – with long beautiful hair and eyes that remind him of someone he once knew touches his hand and says, “You’ve been badly wounded for this place.” She plays with strands of his hair. “You remind me of my son. Strong, brave, loyal. Sometimes he could be foolish too.” She smiles in a gentle way. “There’s no need to be foolish here.” She places her hands on his temple. “You will remember soon. Once you heal, I will help you.” She goes to stand, the robes of her dress rustle as she moves. She looks like a lady from a high court. The ones that he’s heard of and read about when he was -. He stops because he cannot recall.
New members of the pack mean new problems for Steve...
Steve surveyed the rest of the group. Every member of the pack felt more like the Avengers than a close knit family, but he guessed part of being an Avenger should be like it was when he was with the Howling Commandoes. “Okay, let’s do this.”
“Only if you go home, too.”
“What the situation?” Rhodes asks after they shake hands.
With a deep-seated gaze, Tony judged Steve’s offer and then with only the slightest tilt of his head accepted. He slid in next to Steve and then Steve pulled him into his embrace. They lay there like that for several minutes before Steve whispered, “It’s only a dream. I can do this in a dream.”
“Be like a kick in the head,” Bruce muttered. As Tony said, “I don’t want to hunt.” He’d made a promise to Yinsen once. It felt like a million years ago.
Rumlow smiled and switched off the shocker, hooking it back on his belt. “Now that was easy, wasn’t it?” He stretched out the gag and started to push the ball into Steve’s open mouth.
The alpha rage rears up and, as if Steven reads it on Tony’s face, he drops his gaze and murmurs, “Anything you wish, my lord.”
“Oh, sweetheart, I do.”
“But you are submissive to me, are you not?”
Steve’s not so sure, but he doesn’t express his doubts. With a brief peer at the ridge behind them, Steve focuses on the task ahead. Get to the Hub, get rid of Ultron, find the exit Door. “So, this construct of Clint, will Ultron be privy to everything that happens?”
“I have soup. Do you want me to make some?” Steve asks. He doesn’t wait for an answer. He gets the camping equipment from his pack and assembles the little cooktop with a small pot. “This kind of reminds me of the stories my Ma used to tell me of the Fae.”
It was funny in a strange and humiliating kind of way because he never felt the ‘cold of space’. What he’d felt was a kind of warmth. What he’d seen as he closed his eyes had been lights. He supposed it had been from the bomb blowing up the Chitauri mother ship, but it could have been just flashes of nerve endings screaming their death notes. Yet now, now he thought he might have seen something else – some part of himself reaching out and searching for something, someone to cling to, to hold to, to bond to.
“If they’re using Loki’s concoctions, it would help. At least I’d have more of a clue as to what was mixed with the poison to give it its staying power,” Bruce says. “Whatever they poisoned the knife with on top of the ergot – well, the body can’t clear it out, can’t flush it away.”
“Sir, I am scanning now. The readings are not clear.”
Ross sits back in his seat, legs crossed casually to the side, hands loosely clasped together. “Let’s say this is the truth. Let’s say you’re still bonded. You do know that I could take you into custody and charge you instead of Mister Rogers.”
“Have you spoke with Doctor Strange?”
Bruce explained, “No, not as far as we know. He wasn’t exposed to an electrical shock, but he isn’t responding to outside stimuli. The monitors barely register brain function.”
In the middle of the yard, Steve stopped, took all of the beauty of Tony in, and said, “Me too.”
Steve went to Clint’s bedside as one nurse went to clean up the mess he’d made.  He turned to her and knelt to help her though she did most of the work. Tony watched him silently. Once they finished the task, the nurse thanked him and she gave him a wipe for his hands. He cleaned up and tossed the wipe in the biohazard trash bin. For only a second, Tony locked his gaze on Steve’s and then went back to Clint.
“The senses - still getting used to it.”
Before he gets more than two feet, Bucky calls, “Why didn’t you come back for me?”
“So, the armor,” Tony concludes and curses under his breath. “Should have known better. Ultron had access to everything I built before he decided to rebel against good old pops. He must have stolen that too; it’s what I would have done.”
Steve waves off the awkwardness. “I was Mister Stark’s Personal Assistant for a while this summer.”
Steve stares at the screen as it goes black. He doesn’t lift his gaze. The power of their eyes on him, everyone around the table, hurts like a physical pain right under his sternum. He fights silently for air and prays that he’s not about to go into an asthma attack. He shouldn’t,  considering it’s triggered by chemicals, but damned if this isn’t a full out assault on him.
“It’s an interesting concept, but how do we defeat them?” Natalie says.
Steve almost says yes, but he’s already shaking his head negatively as he realizes there’s no way he’s leaving again. He’s staying right where he is. In the corridor outside of the prince’s rooms. He slides down to the floor and sighs. He’s really fucked it all up.
“Seems you might be a lot like your grandfather. He wanted to do the right thing, help people, save the world from the Nazis.”
Alone, he can admit that things are even stranger than he wanted to confess to Bruce. While it might be a funny little joke about his lack of a physical relationship with Steve, the fact remains that every time they get close Steve begs off. He hustles away as if Tony’s a swarm of angry bees and he’s allergic. Tony cannot fasten down what’s wrong. Bruce is correct, Steve spent the last year after the Battle of New York traveling the world with Logan. Maybe Steve’s just not interested.
“You found him. Did he ever find anyone himself?” Tony asked.
He gets to the horses and lays Tony on the snowy ground. “I’m going to get the horses ready. We’re not far from the cabin now.”
He squinted at Natasha. The world blurred, and he fell back against the pillow. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “What happened?” He remembered the cell – where they tried to break him. Where they had broken him. He shivered and the fears of the vampires as they came in the room and drank from him – made his body do things he didn’t want it to do. Respond to their chemicals. He wished the grogginess would take away that memory. The thing inside him, the storm, growing would wash away the misery of those feelings, those memories from him.  His eyes flashed open and he slapped at Natasha as she touched his chest.
“Why did you need to be saved?”
“He can also use the whole of the internet to shore up anywhere he thinks he’s vulnerable and can spy on us here if he uses his resources,” Steve says.
Steve sat up, and Tony went so deep that he came in a flood that surprised and shocked him. His vision whited out and he cried out for pity. When he came down from the height of his climax, Steve smiled at him. His cock stood, red and purple flush against his belly. As Tony softened inside of him, Steve took his own cock in hand and lazily stroked it. He stroked pre-come drizzled along the tip, and he flinched as he scraped his thumb nail over the slit. He took his own pre-come and he painted it on his lips, leaning down to let Tony taste it.
Tony turned to Bruce who only raised his hands in question. Shaking his head, Tony said, “Okay? Let him up.”
Steve gulped down his fear as his image in the recording focused on the camera. “I wish. I wish that Tony Stark – the brilliant, beautiful, arrogant, sad man ever saw me as anything but his Personal Assistant. But that’s what I am Chris-Christern, Christy Evermore Everly. Or whatever. But no. No, Tony, Tony, Tony. He doesn’t. You see? He -” He stumbled a little as he spoke. “He doesn’t see me. He can’t see me. He just works and works. He’s changing the world and he never sees me.”
The burning in his hands subsided and he stumbled away, breaking contact with both Sam and Tony. A rush of medical personnel went to Sam’s side as Steve swayed on his feet, gulping in air and shuddering. As Steve crouched over as if he’d just finished running a marathon, Tony wrapped an arm around his bent shoulders. Steve panted, desperate for breath.
All the while he worked his cock until the come streamed out and he went blank with the expansion of his knot. He needed Steven to tell him, to open up to him. Something deep inside of Tony had awoken and he franticly needed more from Steven, more than he ever thought he would from an omega.
“Are you proposing to me, Captain?” Tony snickered and quirked his brows. He joined Steve on the floor again, near the fire.
“Very good, Captain. Very good.” Pierce clapped. He stood in front of Steve and applauded his failure. The rage of hatred and disgust ran through Steve and he strained in his chains even as his stomach roiled and heaved. Pierce ignored him. “Thaddeus, my dear friend, the stench in here is terrible. Perhaps some cleanup is in order?”
“How is Ben?”
“Good luck, Captain,” Rhodes says and the connection ends. In just a few minutes Steve receives the code and instructions to input it into the computer. He’s not going to do it, not any time soon, but he’ll keep it in his back pocket literally, just in case.
Bucky slumps down and collapses into Steve’s chair behind the desk. “Sure I do, Steve, just don’t go courting trouble.”
“They won’t be as easy,” Tony warns.
Steven glowers at him – which Tony should reprimand him for but he considers it a win.  At least Steven feels comfortable enough to show true emotions.“I’m thinking that’s probably not the best strategy.”
“It has been well concealed, except for a few momentary missteps. Humanity has been blissfully unaware,” the caped man said.
Strange stepped right into Tony’s path. “You play with fire and don’t know that the flame burns.”
A large animal leans on his chest, gnaws at it and he squirms and fights to get free. His arms feel like lead and Steve batters at the bulk of the beast with flailing arms unable to push the animal off him. The gaping hole in his gut burns. Tears stream down his face and he hears someone crying, someone weeping for the pain. It’s him. Of course, it’s him. He forces his hand into a fist and beats on the hulking form of the beast. His efforts are to no avail. The thing devours him. He wants it to rip his throat out to silence the pathetic noises escaping him.
“Exactly,” Steve agreed. “But we don’t know what it means for us.”
“You don’t,” Steve starts and then stops. He inhales and exhales. “Hmm, you didn’t seem blind when-.”
Steve stared down at his hands, grasped together. “No, not ever.” He doesn’t look up as he explains, as the blood of years, of pain comes flooding back. “He couldn’t knot. What they did to Bucky – when they experimented on him – caused his biology to split. Today they probably have a better explanation, I don’t know. He was a beta, but with only a vestigial gland and no ability to really knot. His body didn’t have the capability.” He releases his hands to play with the pulse-ox meter. “He couldn’t knot me. He tried.” Steve heaves in a shaky breath. “It was terrible. You read the reports. He used what he could but he wasn’t sane. Not that first time when we didn’t know what was happening.”
He’ll miss seeing his face most he thinks.
“Yeah, but I like the team too. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family. But I want to do good. It’s part of who I am. Laura’s great because she accepts that,” Clint said as he flipped over the eggs in the frying pan. “Plus, I have a lot to make up for because of Loki.”
With a little finagling, Tony set one of the robot heads on the table with the neck pointed upward. “This should work.” He punched in a few commands on his phone while mentally wishing for his tablet. Some things he could tell JARVIS to do, but others he needed to manipulate. It took a few tries but then the accessed data glimmered and shone above the dining room table projected from the skull of a dead robot. Tony reached over the head and spun the lay out of the woods surrounding an old castle. He enlarged it by splaying his hands out. “Here we go.”
The way he spoke, with that slight Brooklyn accent rang something comfortable and true in Tony’s head. Steve spoke like that, sometimes. Not a lot. But he did – every now and again. He cleared his throat. “I really didn’t mean to. The suit, the Iron Man armor I was wearing malfunctioned. We’ll figure out how to fix your arm. I swear it.”
After a few minutes, JARVIS replies, “Mer Rogers, you are a sly and clever debater.”
“Remember the twins?” Hill asked. “Well, it looks like they were part of an experiment in Sokovia. It’s a small eastern European country that’s always been in the crosshairs of history. In other words, more powerful countries use it as their dumping grounds.”
Clint bit at his lower lip and then said, “Let’s just say even that’s complicated with Nat.”
“You’re not my coven mistress, you know,” Steve said and left Tony’s side to push the door closed. “We’ll be right out.” Turning, Steve asked, “She’s not a coven mistress anymore, is she? I mean technically, she’s not even a vampire.”
“It feels so right, so how can it be wrong?” Steve said as Tony found himself sitting on the bed and Steve kneeling at his feet. “Tell me what to do. I don’t know what to do.”
“Yes, a gala. The one that benefits the Maria Stark Foundation. We could have an announcement about the upcoming products and advancements. You could host. We could even invite certain members of the press,” Pepper says, and she smiles. Steve catches her expression – she’d been planning this, or wanting to and Steve gave her a perfect opportunity. She winks at him.
“Hey? Steve?”
Pairing.
“Each and every rim has been linked to the Avengers.” He doesn’t mention Bucky. Or the dead that attacked him.
“Director Fury is having someone pick me up.”
“You don’t have to baby me, Tony. I’m feeling better already.”
The storm of malignance pelts him and Tony shudders in his grasp. Like a mantra in his head, Steve murmurs the truths that he knows. He’s a shield, a protector, the best last defense for Tony. Decades ago, he was made for this purpose and this purpose alone. To protect and shield. To defend and preserve. He was never God’s righteous man; he has only always been just a man trying to do his best. His best is to secure Tony’s safety against the cruelty and hatred of an intelligence gone horribly wrong.
“Why should I? Tell me why should I bother to say that his first name after what he did? After the lies he told me?” He curses under his breath for failing to curb his outburst. Nothing Stark did or said caused any of this – this is completely his own fault. He’s to blame for everything. He couldn’t handle it, not Tony. Tony – Tony was fine, good.
“Probably is still a maybe, and even if we don’t – well, he could make it impossible for us to enter again. Now that he knows we can – he’s probably building defenses so no one else can do it.”
“You bastard!” Tony yelled and stalked closer, only Steve’s body stopped him.  The anger emanating from Tony tainted the air. “You’re not my Brother. Do you understand me? You’re a murderer, a killer.”
Tony pressed his lips together and then nodded. “Okay. J-man, my luggage transferred on board?”
“Yes?” He tries to pass it off. “I’m an Avenger, I’m trying to show my worth here with the team. What will the Captain say?”
“What’s that?”
It felt right them to lift Tony’s chin, to kiss him in this sacred space. Nothing felt wrong here. The dream landscape became a beacon, a homecoming all at once. Steve forgot to think, to question himself. He forgot to restrict himself from the need. He’d learned as a child to be hungry. During the Great Depression, hunger became not part of the vernacular but part of the bones of his body. Questioning hunger would be the same as questioning why he had legs to walk on or eyes to see. Hunger had been a part of his everyday life as a young teenager and as he grew older.
Steve chuckles. “Not long. The rolls are from a can. Those things are amazing. They pop open!”
A gruff voice returns, “But it could be, my boy. Your father didn’t have the vision, but you do. Tell me you have the vision to see beyond the scattered systems and Regions that operate under the Stark flag. Tell me.”
Steve moved just an inch and looked down on Tony. “It doesn’t feel bad.”
“Goodbye, Pep.”
“Sir?”
“This is when they found him,” Natasha muttered to the group as they approached Steve.
“I think you’re overestimating the impression I’ll make,” Steven says and there’s a slight awkwardness to his expression.
Tony chews back his words, lets the burning sensation in his mouth cause his eyes to fill with tears again. “You don’t know that.” His voice sounds ruined and he doesn’t know if it’s from the hot coffee or the pain of revelation. “You don’t.” He pushes away from her and goes to sit in a single chair that is massively uncomfortable.
“No. I wanted to talk to someone impartial -or someone – well someone other than Nat or Wanda.” Steve sits on the bed, rocking slightly with the pent up energy.
“Aye, Sheriff, we will need to find my brother if it is true,” Thor says and he’s disgruntled by the matter, his normal jovial outward exterior evaporated.
“So, you hoped to travel to one of the Inner Regions to be a Residential Artist for one of the Elite Families?” Tony leans closer to him, his gaze intense and searching.
It’s enough of a distraction that the four hovering close to Steven get the advantage and all four converge on him at once.  One of the attacking omegas takes a shock gun to Steven and hits him with a blast that knocks one of his fellow attackers as well. Steven falters, but stays on his knees. Again the omega hits him with the shocker. Again and again. Until he’s hissing and puffing as he breathes but he keeps climbing back up, getting to his feet.
“Steve Rogers, assistant to Prince Anthony.” Steve keeps his hands tucked at his sides.
“Not according to Frigga, and I tend to believe her. She’s one smart lady.” Tony clasps his shoulder. “Don’t let the visions eat you up. You didn’t actually do anything. He used you as his instrument.”
Nothing.
The images of the bottle, what happened filters through his memories and he shivers as he awakens in the embrace of the cradle. The pain shoots through him like a spear driven deep in his heart. He doesn’t want to remember what happened in that room, the shattered face of his friend afterward, the resolution he made – that he would never let Bucky face what happened alone. Not ever.
“Open your mouth,” Rumlow ordered and charged the shocker. Steve offered no response; he kept his eyes dull and focused on the middle distance.  “Open your god damned mouth or I will brain you with this.” The shocker sparked and sizzled.
“I wonder man out of time, if I kill you here in my world, what happens to you out there?”
“Well, the roads and airports are still closed. But the good news is.” He flips a pancake. “We have a pristine hill out back and we can go sledding.”
Tony steps up to his omega, snaps open the top of the breastplate to reveal the gland. He leans down and bites it, drinking in the elixir like its mana from heaven. It tastes divine. The omega shudders and, as Tony moves away, closes his eyes. “You’re mine, remember that. Should I punish you for your transgressions?” Tony wants to add again but doesn’t.
“The nerves may just grow back on their own. It’s been shown that it is possible, plus with delivery of neural growth factors we have a good chance, Tony.” Strange waits as Tony remains uncharacteristically silent. “You could regain some of your natural sight. The methodology here is cutting edge.”
“No, I did not see that,” Steve said and wiped his face and neck. He followed Sam, tossing the towel in the bin as they passed it. Just outside the workout room, the juicer bar curved along the wall. When they walked up to it, a young man asked for their order. Steve glanced up at the menu, too many different choices.
Tony goes to the sink and mutters something as Steve enters the living room, kitchen space. It’s large and expansive, a little too modern for his tastes and totally nothing like how Tony decorated. Ultron got it right that the place would be modern in it’s stainless steel, chrome, glass, and leather, but nothing else speaks of Tony. So, while Ultron knows Tony’s surface he doesn’t know what’s underneath.
He reaches out and Tony reacts, grabs his hand. Steve holds onto it as if he’s about to tumble off a cliff. “Tony, tell me how it happened. What happened? Why don’t I remember? Did something bad happen? Is everyone okay?”
Steve scans the surrounding area through the iced windows. Carefully, he stands up. His rib is already feeling better. The throbbing in his nose decreases to an unpleasant ache. He balances as he picks his way through the Quin Jet trying to find a clue to the next Passage. “Truthfully, I don’t see anything that would be remotely about me. I didn’t down a Quin Jet. How could Ultron get it so wrong?”
As he reaches out to touch Steve, to ground him the door to their prison cave unlocks and Tony snaps to attention. He might not know what the hell is going on with Steve but he damn well knows the terrorists cannot find out about it. He steps in front of the cot, hoping to hell he can block their view and shield Steve.
Become a real boy.
“What does that mean exactly?”
Tony puts his hand to the small of Steve’s back and navigates out of the house toward his bright orange Audi. “Let’s go.”
“And strangely enough even after a full background check, you’ve managed to surprise me.” He touches the line of Steve’s cheek. “This – this is thoughtful but changing my schedule? That’s taking care of me with a very strategic mind. You actually ended up concentrating what I needed to do with the right people. How did you do that?”
“Always, and they were always helping me. Though I rebelled against,” Tony comments and he doesn’t know if he feels ashamed or proud. “I guess it was wrong.”
“Please, Tony,” Steve whispered and his hand pushed the blankets away to find Tony’s half hard cock. Steve’s dragged the back of his fingers along the length, the roughness of the knuckles sending spears of pleasure through Tony. “I want you in me. I denied myself. I deny it every day. Please.”
“It’s also very narrow minded. Ultron’s literally restricting his own options,” Steve says and then shifts. His body aches and he forces his brain to accept that this virtual reality – is just that – not real. Not his physical reality. He’s fine in the real world. It doesn’t work.
He keeps his shirt on because taking it off yesterday strained his ribs too much. Today he’ll keep it on, but he can toss the pants and socks and shoes. He carefully makes it down to the edge of the water. It isn’t deep. He knows that from yesterday. He gingerly picks his path down to the waters. As soon as he touches the trickle near the edge of the shore, he hisses. Colder than he would have guessed, but then again it probably originates from the mountains. He walks into the water and, at first, it’s only around his ankles. As he gets used to the temperature, he wades a little deeper. Finally, it’s around his knees and he sinks down into the water to bathe. The current isn’t fast but just strong enough to swirl around him like a Jacuzzi tub. He dunks his head and scrubs at his hair. With no shampoo available this will have to do. His poor beard is going to look rough by the time they get out of this.
Their banter keeps up for the better part of the morning until they drop off into a quiet and peaceful companionship. Every now and again Steve studies Tony when he's not aware, when his eyes seem focused inward rather than on the lengthening landscape before them. Marked on his face, Steve notices a clear and critical expression. He may spend much of his time acting as a casual flippant observer of the human condition, but Steve doubts the actuality of it. He doesn't say anything, only keeps his eye on Stark as they ride toward the lower plateau and the river below it.
They break as Tony pulls away and that’s when Steve sees his blown pupils, the flush to his skin. He wants this as much as Steve does and it turns over in the pit of Steve’s belly, coiling low and deep.
Tony turns to find Steve staring into the open paper bag. “What?”
He’s always known he was attracted to men, that there was something wrong with him, that his tastes diverted to the deviant and perverse. He’d tried it with Peggy and he’d loved her well enough. He thinks he could have been happy with her, but she knew him better than he knew himself. She understood that he was just borrowing time until he could find a way to satisfy his aberrant urges. She never judged him, but did give him ease to be released without guilt from their ‘on and off’ relationship.
Stark seethes at him, his eyes penetrating and black. “My father’s dead. I’m here because I know what it means to work with your hands and want to change things. I’m here to make life better in this shit-ass town. If you want me, I’m here. If not, then I’ll take my doctor and leave.”
“Well, remember that woman I dated? She was a seer. She could tell your fortune and she also made mean omelet.”
As he wrestles with the massive beast of a man, Tony recognizes he’s outmuscled and underpowered, but there’s nothing for it – he’s not leaving until he can get this goon out of Steve’s apartment. A fist to his face nearly lands, but Tony’s fast enough to avoid it; there’s some advantage to being the smaller one in a battle. He learned that at boarding school.  He squirms under the oaf and knees upward trying to get his balls. A hand grasps the man’s shoulder and yanks. Even in his weakened state, Steve handles Tony’s attacker with ease.
He had nothing to say when they entered the field and a jet waited. He wanted to rage that the idiots waited for them instead of bringing Steve to the Tower immediately for emergency care. When he raced up the rampway though, he didn’t find either Barnes or Steve in the jet. A blonde headed woman sat at the controls while Natasha waited for him near the rampway.  The pilot had a headset on and whirled her index finger in the air as she directed, “Get it in line. We don’t have much time. The other jet is well on its way.”
Steve coughs and food spews out of his mouth. “Wh-what?”
Steve shrugs. “I think we have to decide how we’re entangled. I don’t even know what the means.”
“Are we really doing this here?” Tony asked as he placed the shield on the floor, propping it up against the bed in which Steve currently slept. Tony hadn’t looked at him, hadn’t focused on the patient or the man he was now forever bonded to. Maybe he just couldn’t make it a reality. If he did how would he ever get out of it?
“Pain. The glasses. I need to-.” He tries to open his eyes, but the flashes of light are blinding. It’s a feedback from the implant for sure. Tears stream down his face and he blinks repeatedly.
Steve frowned but said, “Yes. I fully admit to that, Tony. But remember it wasn’t as accepted as it is today. You went to prison back then.” He caressed Tony’s arm, his chest. “It was different back then.”
“Okay with me,” Clint said and smiled. He leaned back against the table and crossed his arms. “You guys must have some bone cracking sex.”
The air around them sizzles and Steve vaguely wonders what Ross is – is he an alpha? He can’t recall but assumes he must be a beta considering betas have been in power for hundreds of years.
It meant only one thing.
Steve’s attention snaps up to Tony. He furrows his brow and shakes his head. “Not like you mean. We’re the best of friends. Brothers almost. Bucky, well, Bucky always wanted to get married, have a family. With a girl. He’s not, he’s not really-.” He leaves it at that, because he hates the idea of going into the memories again.
“We’re all here for you, Steve,” Tony said. He touched Steve’s arm and then slowly got him to release. Tony grasped Steve’s hand. “You are not alone. Remember that.”
“I will name my heir when it is time. I want an alpha. I don’t want my wealth or my power to fall out of the hands of an alpha-.”
“Last known location but it only had partial coordinates.” She waves him away as he offers a strawberry on his fork. “Allergic, Tony, allergic.”
"I like to work with my hands, I like to create things. And truth be told I had to get away from my father's company."
“Had him on the ropes,” Steve murmurs, as Bucky tugs the holster off and tosses it aside. He gently guides Steve back onto the cot.
“It doesn’t matter. The first one will do. Can we start immediately?”
Steven bows his head for a moment and his hands fist. Tony weighs whether or not the omega might rebel or lash out. He taps his ring, alerting Jamison of his position. Yet, the omega relaxes his hands, splaying his fingers and then nodding to Tony. “Would you like me serviceable at all times or may I spend some time doing other things.”
“Yep.” Steve hurries up the stairs and Tony can do nothing but follow.
No one confronted them as they eased their way into the garage bay. He didn’t spot Natasha, Bruce or anyone else. His heart raced and pounded in his ears with a nearly distracting beat. He splayed open his hand and then gripped the shield’s straps more firmly. Tony yanked him in the right direction and they ended up in front of a silver and black Audi A7 sedan. Tony pulled him in as soon as they got to the vehicle.
He marches through the corridors of the Capital Living Station; he needs to set his boots on soil, touchdown and go planet side for a while. His life isn’t his own anymore, though he can’t remember a time it really was. It occurs to him then that while he was in the middle of concocting a rebellion, he’d actually had control over his life for the first time in over a century. He’d been a part of something bigger than himself, he’d been carried away with its ideals and the momentum of freedom and justice, but it felt right and good. It felt like him; his identity.
“You can have me,” Tony says.
“Come here,” Tony said and gathered Steve close to him. At first, Steve stayed frozen, not moving, not accepting Tony’s sympathy. Tony relaxed and relented, opened his soul and allowed the bond to brighten and shine. He had no words to speak but with the bond, through his soul, he communicated so much. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and buried his face in Tony’s shoulder just as the doors to the elevator opened again and Natasha along with Bruce appeared.
Taking a beer, Steve pushes past Tony and goes into the living room. “Well, I thought we did. I’m not so sure about what you thought.”
She only rolls her eyes as she pushes forward, the low bodice of her dress presses against his chest.  When he dragged himself into the saloon after his showdown with Schmidt, he'd interrupted the mid-afternoon gaiety hosted by the saloon owner, the one and only Natasha Romanoff.  Much to her credit, Natasha spotted him and halted the party, rushing to seize him, calling to Clint, and helping Steve before he collapsed from the blood loss.  This isn’t the first time Steve’s come to Natasha for help after a run in with the town bully, Johann Schmidt. It probably won’t be the last – in fact, Steve knows it won’t be the last. They’ve only just begun the showdown and he doesn’t intend for someone like Schmidt to take control of the town’s resources without a fight.
“I’m fine.”
Natasha cocks the gun.
He gave up his soul to Steve, tried to coax him back to life. But all of Steve’s life had drained away, feeding the rocks, and dirt, and Earth below them. His soul was absent – gone – as if it had never existed.
The tutor that Tony assigned Steve gave him piles of readings to do – none of them are technical. Most of the books are popular science that can be found in any upscale bookstore or online. Still, it takes a lot to read them and comprehend everything.  Spending time studying is high on his priorities, but Steve’s curious about Tony’s work. It’s something that Steve is supposed to help him with, so he wonders down to the laboratory. When Steve arrives at the laboratory, he stares through the glass doors to see Tony in the center of the room.
“Yes,” Tony says. “To the last. I’m not sure about the trust thing, yet. It’s hard to trust someone who hurts the person you love.”
“You fucking knew?”
“I hope so, Jarvis.” He disconnects and then decides not to call Steve. He had his reasons for leaving. Perhaps he did feel inadequate like Jarvis said. He wasn’t. He was strong and handsome, and his hands were like links to the universe to Tony. He would miss those hands. He would miss a lot.
“I don’t know when it happened. Before you found out about your parents but after you got back together with Pepper. I knew I loved you then. I had no recourse. Then everything happened and I lived on the run.” He touches his forehead to Tony’s. “I ran away from everything I wanted, because I knew I never deserved it.”
“Justin Hammer. Hammer faction of the Conclave. And you are?” He weaves closer to Steve as if he’s trying to get him to dance.
“Fuck, what the fuck. I have anti-virus and malware protections running 24/7. Firewalls and space chasms.”
Steve doesn’t reply because it’s true. Water is too valuable out in the Regions to waste on bathing. “Where does the station get the water?” He strips. Using a bathroom with a whole floor of tenement occupants managed to help him deal with being naked in front of others.
“Well, maybe it’s time you and I figure that out?” Tony said and he felt the ground beneath him tremble. It wasn’t just the jet racing down the runway. He wondered if he’d crossed a line, but then Steve smiled and it eased the quaking through the bond.
The Silver Knight has to confess. Maybe these demons know about him, know his story. “Yes, my name. Steve Rogers.”
Blu mutters a growl.
He was and always would be
“Out of line for calling me a pervert? Or for being the regular ass that you are?” Tony shot back. He could try harder, he admitted to himself but the fact was when Tony was cornered he snarled and bit back.
“Light at the end of the tunnel, JARVIS,” Tony asks and even his voice rasps as he works past the recalled images of being confined in a cave, the dark, the unfiltered thick air. He’s still in the armor, but yet he feels like the air around him chokes him. Holding onto the rocky wall, he stops and attempts to settle his nerves.
“I’m trying to help you, Tony. I’m honestly trying to help Steve. He doesn’t deserve this.” He steps away from Tony. “I’m going to get some of the samples of his blood. Work to see if the serum is still intact.”
“I’m not an expert, but it wasn’t good. We were pretty close to losing Clint.” Bruce bowed his head and then looked up at Steve. “He doesn’t seem to remember and that’s probably a good thing.”
“Sir?”
“Yeah, I do.” Steve clears his throat. “It’s remarkable, you know. You knew that it wasn’t mine. That it was someone else’s. That’s pretty impressive.”
Steve only shrugs squinting into the artificial sun. It’s all beautiful and perfect and probably exactly like the systems near the inner regions of the Conclave where everything is pristine. No one wants for anything and a creek running with real water in the middle of a space station isn’t the ultimate waste. Tony grabs Steve’s wrist.
Strange tilted his head. “Maybe you are more alike than not.” He stood up and held his hands behind his back as he assessed Tony. “Are you the one to talk? You are mired in the past. Your father’s love and betrayal is a constant nagging pain for you-.”
“Yes. My mother gave it to me. Years ago. I loved this little guy. I even brought him to college with me. I’m afraid he helped me nurse quite a few hangovers in his day.” Tony looks fondly at the cherished toy. “For years, all I had was Blu to confess everything to.”
“Meant to be?” Tony offers. It sounds silly. There’s no such thing as soul mates or destiny or fate, but somehow or another they are two parts to a whole.
“I can’t have him here.” Abruptly, Tony jumped up, knocking Steve away. “I know I said I could do this for you. I know I promised.” He paced around the room, stopped at the marble fireplace and then laid his head against the mantle. “You didn’t see it. You didn’t feel it. Somehow the damned bond – it recognized me as the son of the woman he killed. He killed her, Steve. Not with a gun or a knife. But his hand. His fucking flesh and blood hand. He didn’t even do it with the metal one. He fucking did it with his human hand. And I felt every god damned second of it.”
“It sounds ableist though,” Steve replies and goes to the closet looking for his own clothes for the day. It’s going to be a long week. He has a bag packed as well.
“I don’t think I can ask people that,” Steve said. “It’s worked so far, the way I’ve dealt with it.” A sad excuse, that’s what Steve thought, but didn’t voice.
They climb into the shuttle with the guards in tow. Steve follows orders and sits at the co-pilot seat but keeps his focus straight head. Natasha’s right. He can’t do this. Not like this, not when he has to be with someone night and day. Maybe if it had been someone less charismatic, less sympathetic. Maybe someone like Hammer or even Stane – where Steve can just be a body and leave his brain behind in some foggy place. Steve’s been stupid, idiotic, thinking that he should care for the whole person, the whole client. It isn’t about that – it’s about a quick fuck and that’s it.
A familiar voice from behind them answers, “You could say that. But maybe not.”
Rumlow yanks on the wire and Steve gags, choking and blood spurts out of his mouth. Tony prepares to launch himself into the room, searching for a way in that will allow him to burst in behind Steve’s assailant.
At that something rings true and the only man smiles a toothless grin. “Did that myself long about 1968.” He cashes out Tony all the while extorting about his adventures in the age of Aquarius.
“Yeah. Ty is a dick. Luckily at about that time I happened to have the first version of the glasses. There wasn’t an implant and they worked like shit, but I was able to show the world I could still see.” He hands a plate in Steve’s generally direction. “It worked.”
“Yes, Mer Rogers.”
Fury commented, “It’ll take a few days, maybe less for you, for the swelling to go down and the marking to gain color. But it’s true.”
Tony reaches for his coffee again. He pretends he didn’t hear the name. Of course, Logan would know that Steve’s been ill. Someone would have to be a mole not to know that the world had its eyes on Steve’s condition. “So Logan?” He sips his coffee. It takes like mud in his mouth.
“I should hope not,” Steve says fondly.
“Sarah,” Steve whispers and Tony only smiles at him – he remembered his mother’s name. He’s not just a tool created for the bidding of the Soul Keeper. He has a name and an identity. He has a family. The agony of the white flash pulls him under for too long, but eventually he claws his way back to consciousness and this time it’s the woman with red hair telling him the story.
“It works, but it needs a lot more refinement,” Tony said as he studied his creation. “Like this with Clint. I keep getting this fuzzy cloud around him. And Natasha seems to have an outlying connection to something – I’m not sure what.” It occurred to him then that it was probably the other soul bond she talked about to him. Whatever happened to that bond and why it was in the state it was now, remained a mystery.
Steve blinks a few times to get the disorientation to dissipate. It only works minimally, but enough that he can, at least, feel the floor and know it from the ceiling of the cave. “Sorry, sorry, what’d I say?”
Tony wanted to ask what. What could they possibly be doing? But words turned to dust in his dried throat. He’d once asked Steve what happened to vampires taken to the Triskelion. Steve paled and refused to explain. He only said
His tormentor only has one word in response, “Jericho.”
“Wait here,” he says and he dashes to the door.
Steve could handle that. “I’m the leader, but you already knew that. Bruce is the Healer of the group. Nat is in the position of Confidant while Sam here is our Companion. Clint has the classic position of Sentinel. Peggy, who is now in London, is our Guide. Tony is Beloved.” Strange quirked a brow at Steve but didn’t comment. “We have three more members. Bucky Barnes is Brother, and the two others-.”
“Yes, but do you actually see the world as it should be?” Steven asks. “Because it should be this-.” With that Steven leans down and sweeps Tony into a kiss. A kiss that’s passionate, and driven and laden with promises that Tony can just barely taste because Steven only gives him the appetizer. He refuses Tony the rest. Steven steps away. “Do you see the world as it should be?”
“What?” He’s not following her, but he feels as if they’ve moved onward to a place he has some understanding of, that her issue is no less problematic than hers. He suspects it is more than Bucky’s arm. “It’s not that he’s a cripple?”
The duchess’ eyes soften and she shakes her head. “The prince – he has a hard job. The war sits on his shoulders. Even with all the other factions in the Conclave. They all look to him to lead. It isn’t an easy task.”
“What the fuck?” That’s all he manages. “This is what you think of me? That after a frank, and open conversation I would punish you?” He knows, recognizes, fucking understands that he’s caned Steven for less. He’s not been consistent at all. This was supposed to be about him turning over a new leaf, finding a way they could exist together, forge a different relationship. “How can you fucking fight for me when this is what you think of me?”
“I know that. Geez, Wanda. I just didn’t know the Synthezoids were coming here for the conference.” He mulls her information. “You’re seriously entertaining one?”
“No kissing,” she repeats and picks up the tablet. She types as she talks. “Rack, no kissing. You’ll need to go through the list of limitations. Once you do that, we can prepare a room and you can select the alpha that fits your nee-.”
“You know, we’re not so different, after all.” Tony moves away from the liquor cabinet. “When I was young I wanted to forget my responsibilities.”
“You don’t have to, you’re still-.” Steve is surprised to realize he’s panting.
Steve braces against the table near the cot, forces his body to stand and then on wobbly legs, shuffles over to the bench. “They said, if you don’t have the Jericho today, they are going to kill you. Raza’s coming.”
He jumps and turns to find Steve standing in the doorway. “God, Steve. I’m sorry. I came in to get my tablet.” He lifts it as if it’s a defense.
“Got to, got to shock heart.” He moans and his body convulses under Steve’s care.
“Wha-?” He felt it then, the delivery. The payload of nanobots sent into his stab wound. Tiny artificial organisms festered. Daggers split through his nerves and he squeezed his eyes closed, trying to fight off the pain. He bit at his bottom lip. He couldn’t hold on, he couldn’t grab anything because the sheaths of nanobots over his hands paralyzed him and forced his hands open. The nanobots shackling him controlled him, kept him paralyzed.
“You did this for me,” Tony states. The realization hits him, and he seizes Steve, embracing him. “You did this for me.”
Tony inches forward, he doesn’t want to see it, but it’s like a car wreck. He has to look, there’s no stopping him from gaping at the collision.  Everything does collide in his brain – the images sketched out in front of him slot into place like pieces in a circuit board. It’s so easy to see, he knows it all. “Shit. Fuck. God damn.” He picks up one of the papers and sees the drawing of Steve perched over him in a tent. “We were on our way to meet them. The Ornari,” Tony mumbles. “We stopped to rest. We-.” Tony swallows down the rest because he can feel the lasting impression of making love to Steve. Tears prickle in the corners of his eyes. “This doesn’t make sense. None of this happened.”
Even as Tony strides down the corridor, Steven keeps up with him. Over the course of the week in space, his body healed and he put on weight. Tony’s pleased he didn’t just try and starve himself. Yet there’s something simmering about the omega that Tony hasn’t figured out. It might be that fact that attracts him.
Instead of continuing his ascent up the stairs, the doctor steps down and says, “Sometimes it isn’t about wealth, Sheriff. Sometimes it’s about living life on your own terms. Tony is someone who wants to live his life as full as he can, while he can. If he’s fond of you, I would take that as a sincere compliment and, if you’re truly interested, consider returning his affections.”
“Steve, you’re both oversimplifying it and making it too complex. If two consenting adults want to explore who they are together – that’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with it,” Natasha said. “I’m not saying it’s a good idea to do whatever you like. There are limits to everything, like you said. But the truth is maybe your generation was a little too limited, too constrained. But even then if two men liked one another, wanted to be with one another do you really think they let society’s mores change that? If you restrict yourself, how will you know what you can attain? Who you are? If you’re limited in what you can do or see, you might just not see the stars or ever reach them.” She fell silent as the words penetrated.
“He is having trouble getting his clothes back on, sir.”
“Why, Tony?” He picks up his hand and shows it to Tony. The wedding ring is still there. “Thank you for what you did. But it isn’t necessary anymore.” He tugs off the ring and hands it to Tony, who doesn’t accept it.
