Whatever the hell that means. Steve's never bothered to get out a dictionary for it. Tony used it once, the second or third time Steve tried tying him up, when they hadn't quite figured out yet that he needed to not put certain kinds of pressure on very particular spots on Tony's chest. While they do have regular safewords, it's not always apparent what the exact nature of the problem is if one gets called. That one is unambiguous and urgent: out now, off now, away now.
"Can I touch you?" Steve blurts out. The words hang there between them. "I mean-- if you want--"
He takes a step forward, realizes as his pants shift down his hips that his cock is
Could Steve just pull the electrodes and the IV without hurting Tony? He had no clue what the machine was, and while there was a very high chance that it wasn't doing anything good to him, the possibility existed that Tony would be worse off without it, or worse off if Steve suddenly unplugged it without shutting it off properly.
Steve can't focus on anything except Iron Man's heavy tread next to him, the sound of floorboards creaking under the weight of the suit as they walk together. Iron Man is so close. Steve could touch him. Except, of course, he can't.
Shoving a few of the seats back, Steve clears a space on the floor. He's got one of the blankets spread out beneath him, insulation from the metal decking, and he's down to his undershirt -- the mail on his uniform is going to be a hindrance -- before Tony takes notice of what he's doing.
Steve groaned. "You should--" he gasped. "You should probably, oh God, slow down. I'm too close."
put my back into it."
"--but given that there has already been damage to his memory from the initial spell, what you want may be impossible." He pauses. "I think you need to consider... what you can live with."
Tony smiling--
But Steve had no proof. He had nothing that Tony would believe.
. Everything he needed to know to be an effective team leader.
Steve pushed up, wiped his mouth on the back of his hand, decided that hadn't done much, and then gave a little more care to wiping up the mess he'd made of Tony's leg. It was mostly on the sheets. He was probably going to end up sleeping on that. He didn't mind, as long as it meant that Tony stayed.
"I know you and Tony get like this sometimes." Her voice was quiet, a little awkward. "We all know. We all care about you. Both of you. You're intense, the two of you, and you're both very... strong-willed," she said, after a pause, like she'd had to choose that word with care. It was nicer than a lot of the things Steve had been called. "So you fight sometimes. But it always gets better. It always, always gets better. And I know it hurts right now, but that's not forever. Because you always make up, don't you? You're always friends again. And maybe that doesn't feel true right now, but it is. I know it is."
"Thor already knew," Tony admitted, and braced himself for the anger, for the jealousy. "He's known for a few years. A couple other people know, too. I'm-- I really am sorry I never told you before--"
you? Do you understand how long I've hated you?"
Steve's stomach was in knots. Good lord. That was-- that was
Steve took a step forward, his gaze locked with Tony's. "He's
"I don't want to interrupt him--"
And Tony still wanted to be his friend. Steve hadn't ruined everything. Steve hadn't ruined anything at all.
Tony sounds dazed. "Right. Of course."
"You're not planning to murder me and steal my fortune, are you?"
This right here, this is the part that doesn't make any sense. "Of course I like you," Steve says. "Why would you think I don't like you?" Steve told him he wanted to
That meant that if something went wrong, it was up to him.
Tony snorted with laughter and then also instantly regretted that. "Ow. Cap. Really. Come on."
it. Tony needs Steve to hold him tight and tell him everything's going to be okay.
Tony ruffled his hair. "Good point."
Tiberius was still trying to reach out. And he still couldn't quite move. "You never lost. Not for good. And you should have. By all rights, you should have. I kept tabs on your career while I was in Europe. You stopped making weapons. You ditched all your government contracts. You should have tanked your company, and you didn't. And then you did tank your company. You drank while your fortune was stolen away. And somehow you still came back." He spluttered. "Your girlfriend paralyzed you. You healed. You came back. Then you died. You died
They'd never talked about this. They didn't talk about things like this. They didn't draw attention to them. They couldn't. They couldn't talk about what any of it really meant. It ran too close to everything Steve couldn't say.
different, but at the same time, well, he
," Steve snaps, far too loudly. "Not that it's any of your business, but we make do just fine. I'd rather be with him than anyone else."
Tony exhaled hard, relaxing under Steve's fingers. He was starting to smile again, and in his eyes-- oh. That was love. That was what that was.
Steve needs to make a move right now before it's too late.
It was opulent. That was the best word he could come up with, but that wasn't quite right. He knew that Tony believed in paying for quality; the chairs Tony bought for the mansion, for example, didn't look like anything fancy, but they were incredibly sturdy. They had to be. They could hold Tony in full armor. They could hold Thor. All the furniture here looked, first and foremost, like it had been bought to look expensive. There were plush, rich fabrics; there was ornate gold filigree; the shining hardwood floors were accented with mahogany.
He stroked Tony's cock, fast and tight, and then got his mouth back on him. Tony was breathing heavily now, and his fingers closed hard on strands of Steve's hair, and somehow it all felt amazing. He was doing this right, he thought, delighted; he was making it good for Tony after all.
Tony clears his throat. "I don't think there are really words for how I felt watching Ghost put a gun to your head." His lips thin; he swallows. His words are slow, carefully chosen. His voice is hoarse. "I could see it coming, you know. The armor sensors worked just fine, and Ghost's tech has fairly distinctive energy signatures. And I--" Tony looks away, and his voice catches. "I would have recognized what he was carrying anyway. I knew he had a neutralizer in his hand even before you did. I just-- I couldn't make myself do anything about it."
Tony's hand slid back up into Steve's hair, and he could see Steve try to repress a pleasant shudder as Tony raked his fingernails lightly over Steve's scalp. Oh, he was going to be
"Oh, Tony, look at you," he breathed.
a second job, can he? The pay for active Avengers is generous enough that Steve comes nowhere close to spending it all, and he still wouldn't even if -- like Iron Man -- he had to pay for his own room and board elsewhere. Maybe Iron Man really does need the money. It's not Steve's business, not if Iron Man doesn't make it his business.
"Iron Man!" the woman behind the desk says. She's addressing Tony, because of course she assumes Tony's in charge here. "Ghost is currently on the thirty-third floor. The usual protocols are in effect, obviously."
When Steve drew breath, he found that the only thing he could say was Tony's name. "Tony, Tony, Tony, that's so good. Please.
Steve shook his head. "It was illegal," he murmured. "I wasn't going to report them and lose two of my best men because the world thought it was wrong for them to love each other. So I kept their secret for them. I know they hated that it had to be a secret, but that was how it was, back then."
And yet, here Tony is, with flowers blossoming in his chest for a man whom everyone now knows has been dead since 1945. The never-ending parade of psychologists confirm that Tony knows this too. Tony's grasp on reality is perfect. He just has an unrequited crush on Captain America. Who happens to be dead.
The word
After that, Steve wasn't thinking about anything except getting downstairs to Tony.
"Fine," he said, too loud, too fast. The answer was terse, clipped. He knew he didn't sound like himself. He knew he'd always been a bad liar.
This is all his fault. He knew Tony shouldn't have been here. Tony can't do this, not in his state of mind. Steve thought it wasn't going to matter. Steve bet everything, and he lost. He was wrong.
"Chest," Steve said thickly. "Ribs, I guess. Arm," he said, and Tony promptly dropped his hand. "No, other one. Leg-- left leg. Probably all broken."
Oh, right. He'd been staring at Steve.
"How are you even real?" Iron Man says, under his breath, as if he expected Steve to say anything other than that. He nods again, more enthusiastically. "Absolutely, yes, I'd still like that."
Oh, God.
He switches the earpiece off. Tony's muffled sobs and rasping breaths vanish. At the edge of his field of vision, Tony doesn't move, and Steve doesn't know if Tony's even conscious of the fact that Steve just killed their only comm line.
For about five seconds, Tony was convinced he'd made a mistake. The scales of Steve's shirt dug into his palm and Steve's surprised breath was hot against his mouth. Steve's body was tense. But then it was like a switch flipped within Steve, the current flowing the right way, and Steve just melted in Tony's arms. His mouth opened under Tony's, urging Tony on, encouraging Tony to just take what he wanted because it was what he wanted as well.
The team was here, he reminded himself.
This was the moment in Steve's fantasies where he'd offer himself up. He'd smile, he'd hold out his hand, he'd tell Tony he'd never hurt him like that.
Steve jogged down the sidewalk to the main entrance. The door was unlocked, and the lobby was empty except for two men behind the security desk. One man looked like a garden-variety security guard, but the fella sitting next to him was a fairly large man in an expensive-looking suit and-- oh.
"Did you ever consider that this was a setup for you?" he asked, trying to drag himself back on track. Right. Focus. Mission. He could handle a mission. "Last I checked, Flag Smasher wasn't even
Tony hadn't been wrong when he'd said he was inexperienced. He knew enough to keep his teeth out of it, but he was definitely more than a little clumsy. But somehow that made it hotter. He didn't want the perfect, pornographic blowjob. He wanted
He reached out again and put his hand on Tony's shoulder. Tony's shirt was thin enough that Steve could feel the heat of him through the cotton. He really needed to stop thinking about things like that.
It's not graceful; the suit's not aerodynamic enough for grace, not like this. He's falling like what he is, a man wrapped in a few hundred pounds of solid metal, and he's at least a hundred feet in the air.
Stephen's gaze is unreadable. "You don't remember this, but historically, you haven't always been able to."
would have involved getting the shield, and that was upstairs. But she was stronger than him, faster than him, tougher than him. Superhuman to his peak-human. If he'd actually wanted to hurt her, he could maybe have managed it eventually. Maybe not.
"Before I," Iron Man begins, and then he gestures at his chest with his free hand. "Before-- before everything, not a lot of people ever really wanted to spend the whole night with me. They got what they wanted and they left. And after -- there's been no one. You're the only one. I know it's... less than you wanted from me, but I'm grateful. I really liked it. So thank you."
"But just in case Tony changes his mind," he said, because he was going to be better, because he had so much to atone for, because there was so much he'd done wrong when Tony was drinking, "I think it'd be a good idea to keep Henry... uh. I'm trying to think of a phrase that isn't
"It literally isn't a crime," Tony says. He frowns. "Shit, it was in the forties, wasn't it?
When he passed Tony the blue mug instead, Tony's fingers brushed his, pressing against Steve's hand for a period of time that Steve tried to tell himself was perfectly normal, before he managed to get the mug balanced between his palms. Tony wrapped his hands around the mug like he'd never been warm before.
And suddenly everything about it was wrong.
He wasn't quite at his full strength, but Steve yelled when the flogger cracked across his ass and his knees slid apart, almost dropping him to the bed. God, that was good.
"Yes," Tony informed him, too quietly for the rest of the team to hear. "That
Huh. He wasn't expecting anyone. It couldn't be an Avengers emergency; they'd have used the identicard. Anyone who needed him for business-related reasons would also have called, and even then they really would have waited until morning; it was getting pretty late. And not a lot of people these days knew where he lived in New York. He'd filed it in the Avengers' records, but he didn't think he'd told anyone outside of the team. And the front desk wouldn't have let just anyone off the street up to see him, after all.
Walders just kept looking at him. She was unflappable. "That's as may be, Captain. But Tony Stark isn't an Avenger."
"Also I really like doing it," Tony added. "So it has that going for it."
Steve swallows hard. His eyes fall shut in misery. He doesn't want to watch this. There's nothing he can do. There's nothing anyone can do. He should have told Jan the truth. And maybe that would have meant neither he nor Tony could look her in the eye again, but she could have pulled someone from the reserves. It's not like the active team are the only Avengers in the world. It would have been embarrassing, but no one would have died. People are probably going to die once Ghost gets those plans.
"Going to take the stairs up," Steve tells Tony. "We'll surprise him."
And sure, there had been times when Steve and Tony hadn't been speaking to each other, at odds over this thing or that, but Tony had always still been alive. They'd always had a chance to come back to each other.
Tony's gaze was utterly enraptured. Like he seriously thought this was the best thing he'd ever heard. Well, that was different.
And he wouldn't have said anything about it, ordinarily, but it was past four in the morning, which seemed like the kind of time for this conversation, and also it was Tony. If anyone was going to be able to see past the flag and the uniform, it was Tony.
Steve turns around. "Yes?"
Right now, though, he has two problems:
That was how it had worked, Steve realized, dully. Pleasure had come with a price. A favor Tony hadn't wanted to owe, for something that Tiberius had probably made a big deal of doing especially for Tony -- because that was
the one who's not any good at it, or because his standards are impossible to meet. And if you're not talking about what you're doing or what you like, it's very possible that no one's getting their needs met because no one is making it clear what they want. But none of that means you're bad at gay sex. In fact, I suspect you're very, very good at it. And I'm not just saying that to make you feel better."
, and maybe he wouldn't even notice when Tiberius cut him to the bone.
He wouldn't have said anything to Tony, though, not then. He'd been-- geez, he'd been engaged to Bernie, back then. He'd loved her. He really had. And he'd also known that it was possible to be attracted to someone without acting on it, and he'd thought Tony was straight, so nothing would have happened. Just another case of unrequited love. Someone he'd never have had a chance with. He'd told himself it would fade. But then Bernie had left him, and-- well, he'd still loved Tony. He'd always loved Tony.
It didn't mean anything. Of course Tony was happy to see his old friend. It was just for this evening. And Tony had told Steve they could go out for brunch tomorrow, so Steve would still get a chance to spend time with him soon.
"--and I was lying to myself, too. I told myself it was never going to happen again, and if it never happened again that meant it was all history, that meant it was nobody else's business, and that meant I didn't have to tell anyone. I told myself I had it under control." His mouth went crooked. "But I think we both know I'm not great at self-control, don't we?"
"Sleep," Stephen says, and Steve's eyes drift shut.
His face is hot. He knows he doesn't have even a tenth of Tony Stark's charm. How can he hope to compete with Tony Stark, famed playboy? He can't quite believe he actually said it.
"Whoa, easy there!" Steve said, from somewhere behind him, and when Tony glanced down he could see Steve's gloved hands on his shoulders, urging him back up.
Tony snorts. "I think I've had you a few times already."
The East Coast team had been kind enough to keep him looped into their comms once Tony had said he'd like to stay a little longer after that mess with Sise-Neg, and Jan had let the rest of the team know that they were planning another clean-up session today. Monica had said she was going to make the rounds of the hospital again instead, but Thor and Steve had said they were in.
And someday they wouldn't.
At least Iron Man seems a lot less tense now. Sure, Steve's face is still warm, but he's willing to endure a little discomfort to take the heat off Iron Man.
"Is it, though?" She was smiling. "In the last few seconds of the footage that tragically claimed the lives of the SNN news crew, Iron Man is very, very close to the explosion -- and yet, miraculously, he is the sole survivor. How can you be so sure it wasn't him?"
"I know." Tony glanced away. He was drumming his fingers on his thighs in obvious discomfort. "But that-- that was all it was, okay? That's-- no one ever-- it wasn't more than that. With anyone."
Steve wasn't actually all that sorry about it.
That couldn't be right. What the hell?
"Are you sure that's a no, about the shield?" Steve asked. "I've been known to hug it, myself." He hoped that would make Tony feel better about taking him up on the offer, if Tony knew that Steve wasn't offering because he thought Tony was weak, was offering his own coping method. They were both only human, after all.
"So," Walders began, with a gleam in her eye, "if you admit that you think of him as an honorary Avenger--"
Sure enough, there was a red-gold blur in the sky behind her. Wanda and Pietro must have seen Tony onscreen in a different station's coverage.
When he woke up, his mouth tasted like cotton, Steve had strapped him into the co-pilot seat, and there were blue skies around him. Experimentally, he reached for Bleeding Edge in the back of his mind, and found it sluggish but responsive. He could call the armor if he needed it.
But it looked like right now he was going to get everything he wanted.
The thing was, it was starting to seem like it mattered a whole lot, actually.
"Well, well, well!" the stranger called out, in a bright and pleasant tone. "What have we here? Could it be the number-two richest man in America?"
Steve was breathless, watching him. "I'd be happy to -- mmm -- appreciate you at any time."
That wouldn't do. Steve raised his head, determined to address this.
Steve reached out and gently ruffled Tony's hair. "It was all good, so, yeah, you do. They agreed that you were one of the best lovers they ever had," he informed him. "They said you were kind and caring. Considerate. Generous. Attentive. You absolutely made sure they had a good time. And honestly, I don't see how that would be different if you're with a man. I don't think it would be different at all. I know
Tony nodded. "Looks like." His mouth wavered; his head tipped down. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry it has to be like this."
The ride to Steve's apartment was exactly as good as he had feared it would be.
When Steve unhooks the first one, the armor whines quietly and the unibeam housing dims slightly.
"Sorry," Tony croaks out, on the private line, for Steve's ears only. He sounds like he's about to cry, if he's not crying already.
"Of course I do." Steve gritted his teeth. He knew he wasn't smiling anymore. He knew that wasn't going to play well. "But I also know that there's a difference between what's legally permitted and what's morally right. You have a constitutional right to broadcast the news and opinions that you've broadcasted." He hated to say it, but it was true. "There's no law against making the statements you've made. I'll admit that. But ethically, morally -- your actions are in the wrong. They constitute a pattern of harassment. This very station accused Tony of the murder of Whiplash. Your own newspaper called on the Avengers' government liaison to pressure the Avengers to force Tony's bodyguard Iron Man off the team. And Ms. Walders here just accused Iron Man of causing an explosion that killed five people." Steve hissed through his teeth. "You started it, Mr. Stone. And you've been more than happy to continue it. You're ripping him apart. And we both know you're doing it deliberately. This isn't a coincidence."
Hank laughed. "I guess I must have." Then he blinked and peered past Steve, as if he were looking for someone else. "Are you here all on your lonesome?" he asked. "What happened? Did your date ditch you?"
The serum had healed him enough, by that point, that sunlight wasn't deadly to him. Oh, he hadn't been all the way better; it had stung a little and he wouldn't have wanted to spend a lot of time in the sun, but it had been tolerable.
. "I thought for sure I must have missed you. Haven't seen you in a couple days. Late breakfast for you, huh?"
If he was going to go, there were a few things he wanted to say first.
Oh. Iron Man still thinks Steve wants something
A half-remembered line from a novel drifted through Steve's head.
Steve grinned at him. At
Steve was... smiling? He was trembling, eyes wide in astonishment, and tears were tracing their way down his face, soaking his cowl and sliding down, but he was definitely smiling.
"Yes, of course," Steve said, confused, "but what does that have to do with--"
Tiberius' smile now was almost gracious. "I'm glad you finally see it my way, Captain." He made a show of glancing around the studio as he started to rise from his chair. "Well, if that's all you have to say, I think we're just about--"
But Tony didn't answer the question. "I think I should start from the beginning." He picked up his mug again and stared off into the distance. "This wasn't anything I wanted. I mean, of course I didn't want this" -- he gestured at his chest -- "but I meant, more generally. The Sentient Armor. I wasn't trying to make any of it happen. This wasn't like Hank's AI experiments." No one was ever going to be able to forget Ultron. "In fact, I've had safeguards against sentience built into my armor for years for that exact reason. I wasn't interested in being the guy who built the second Ultron, you know?" His laugh was dry. "Turned out my safeguards weren't all that safe. Because, despite my best efforts, I, uh. I essentially
Raising a hand, Steve plucks his shield out of the air. As it thuds hard against his palm, he's already slinging the shield on his back, freeing both hands as he dives for the falling drive.
It didn't taste bad, but there was more than Steve had been expecting, and he couldn't quite swallow it all, but he did his best, holding Tony's cock in his mouth for the last final twitches of pleasure. Tony had sprawled back against the pillows, his hands lax on the back of Steve's neck. His eyes were closed again, and a blissful smile curved across his lips. This was Tony when all the masks were off. Steve wanted to see him like this every single day for the rest of his life.
"He's a worrywart," Steve told Carol, as she flew over the four-foot drop where the Quinjet ramp had once been able to extend. "I'm fine."
He wondered if Tony was going to want to speak to him ever again after the show aired. He wondered if Tony would be kind enough to let him know before cutting off all contact. He wondered if Tony would refuse to talk to him even in meetings or on missions. He probably should have thought about that particular consequence first. But he knew he would have done everything just the same anyway.
It was night, and he was standing in the shadows, and as a further ode to attempted stealthiness he'd turned off every light in the armor, even the unibeam and the eye slits -- but Steve didn't even jump. Of course he didn't.
They kissed, again and again. And even if Luck wasn't a stat, Steve was sure that there was no one in the world luckier than him.
"And, of course," Tony told the crowd, "in addition to the Foundation's philanthropic work, they help make the Avengers possible."
Steve understands the feeling, all right.
Tony shrugged. "I don't know," he mumbled.
Tony was an excellent passenger; Steve wouldn't have expected anything else from him, but even so, he was pleasantly surprised at how easy Tony made it for him. Tony knew to not make sudden movements or shift his weight. He knew how to keep his balance. He knew not to put his own feet down when they were stopped at a light. He didn't lean too far in on the turns. He'd probably ridden before. Steve couldn't remember ever seeing Tony on a bike, but over the years he'd concluded that Tony knew how to operate every vehicle that existed, from speedboats to spaceships. So of course he was good. In terms of ability, Steve couldn't have asked for anyone better.
"What's wrong, Tony?"
Tony raised a speculative eyebrow. "No?"
Steve could slide right inside him, like this. He knows Tony would let him, if he wanted to. Tony would open so easily for him, under his fingers, the way the entire rest of his body has. He'd give himself to Steve, his body hot and plush and welcoming, as if he'd been made for Steve, and he'd let Steve spend himself inside him. Steve knows exactly how it would go, because they've done this before. A lot. It's not something they always do the same way around, or even something they always do at all, but Steve does fuck him, sometimes. Tony likes Steve to fuck him early in the morning, when his limbs are still lax and heavy with sleep, when he doesn't have to worry about a thing, when he's not fretting about whether he's being good enough and it's easy for him to just
It felt true when he said it, and Tony shuddered, his eyes dark with arousal.
of pure want that Tony makes when Steve bottoms out, all the way inside him. It's a nice thought. His body hums with arousal, but it's like static on the radio. Background noise. It's not urgent. He doesn't need it. He just likes thinking about it.
you're jealous, because you've never done this to anyone else I've been with. What's different now, huh? Are you just that upset that I missed brunch? That I'm friends with someone who isn't you? What's your problem?"
"Anyway," Tony said, with shame running through his voice, "this is me getting around to why I wrote a very uninformative mission report. The Ultron thing wasn't what I considered the most, uh, compromising aspect of this whole fiasco." He hesitated. "Because there's actually something I left out of this story, all the way through. And I'm absolutely sure you're not going to like it. That's why I left all of it out of the report."
sounded upset. Had Steve done something wrong? Had Tony actually figured him out? Did Tony
Maybe he should have gone for the Village Voice personals after all. But he knew he couldn't have. That wasn't him. This was him.
He unlocked the door, stepped back, let Steve in. Steve closed the door behind himself firmly, like he really wanted to make sure it was shut, and stepped away from the door into the room proper. He'd said it would only take a couple of minutes, but he was sure acting like this was a serious conversation.
Right. Time to figure out the rest of the bondage.
Steve ran his fingers through Tony's hair. "Easy," he said, because Tony was still shaking. "It's okay. I'm not upset. What you said was just fine. I know we didn't talk about any of that. And I know coming out is a much more... public... decision for either of us than it would be for a lot of people. I know you haven't. Hell, I know
"Oh!" Steve says. "Sure. That'd be great, thanks."
Tony tips the faceplate up again and he's smiling, albeit weakly. "You've got the best ideas. Good thing you're here."
She'd told Steve he was far, far better than Tiberius. Tony had agreed.
"Loosen your jaw," Tony ordered.
He wrapped his arm around Tony and tugged him closer, backwards and over until there was enough room for them to both fit comfortably on the mattress. Tony curled up next to Steve, draping himself over him, warm and solid and real. Then Tony leaned up and kissed him, lightly, and, oh, that was nice. Everything seemed a little less urgent right now; Steve could just enjoy the sensation.
"Thanks, Shellhead." Steve flashed a smile at him. "You're the best."
Not bothering to turn on the light, Steve scanned the living room bookshelf in the dimness. He didn't know exactly what he was looking for, but he'd know it when he saw it.
Oh, that was just
He couldn't get up and check on Tony. What was he going to do, tell him
Steve never saw Tony's face at the Vault.
Steve wanted to tell him the concern wasn't warranted, but he could see it from Tony's point of view. If something was bad enough that any part of Steve's body needed to be immobilized, it was
He knew it wasn't all going to be this easy. He knew Tiberius would still be haunting them for a while to come, even if he did go to prison. He knew Tony would want to read about it, and think about it, and talk about it later. But for now, for this moment, Steve could give him just a little more happiness, and he was going to stay for the rest of it.
"Never," Tony said, fervently, the word falling from his lips without his conscious volition. No other words came to mind except the obvious. "You're-- you're perfect."
The problem with this plan was that Tony hadn't fallen asleep yet.
"It's an honor to make your acquaintance, Captain," Tiberius said. "I don't think I've ever met an Avenger before."
." Steve breathed out hard when Tony said
He wanted to encourage Tony, so he reached down, intending to pet his hair, but when his hand was nearly close enough, Tony shivered in a way that didn't look good, practically flinching away. Okay, not that. He set his hand on Tony's shoulder instead, squeezed ever so slightly in praise, and Tony
Tony scrutinized his face. "Really? You'd do that just for me, huh?"
It's the truth, of course.
Jan gave him a sidelong glance of disbelief, and, yeah, she absolutely knew what else was likely to be in that box, all right.
him, somehow.
Tony's other hand settled on Steve's shoulder, his grip lightly bracketing the base of Steve's neck, and, oh, yes, that was exactly right. That was what he'd needed. Tony was right here with him, as much as he could have.
"Of a sort," Fury said, with that squirrelly, evasive tone that Tony couldn't stand. "I'm here to present a suggestion."
"Yeah," Tony admitted. He wanted to crawl in a hole and die, although maybe not as much as Steve clearly did.
And it's selfish, but he knows he'll feel better too, helping Tony. He likes being useful. Needs to be, maybe. It's just how he's wired. So it'd be good, wouldn't it? Good for both of them.
He pictured, quite vividly, jerking off, kneeling over Tony, his release spattering over Tony's trembling, taut muscles. He'd make a pretty picture. Tony would look like him, Tony would smell like him, and Steve would know, he'd know exactly who Tony had been with now and it would be him--
Tony snapped his head to the left, and the world spun. Something new started beeping angrily. But Steve was right there, sitting at his side.
It was everything else that was the problem.
"They had to." Tony had figured out this much, even if this whole AIM thing was still lurking somewhere in the foggy parts of his brain. "Didn't-- didn't want me using the suit. Wanted the RT."
"Hell of an accident, Winghead." Tony's voice was rough, and he rubbed his thumb over Steve's fingers again.
And Tony gasped and jerked awake, a shudder running through his whole body, like he'd woken up from a nightmare. He blinked, and his eyes focused on Steve. His wide-eyed gaze was full of tremulous hope and heartbreaking fear. Like he didn't know if Steve was real, but like he desperately wanted him to be.
Steve licked into Tony's mouth and Tony made a soft, needy noise against Steve's lips, a gasp of pure pleasure that went right through Steve. Tony
Maybe Tony liked getting to touch him, especially.
Steve
But he didn't want to.
"I'm here to stop you from doing something you're going to regret for the rest of your life," Iron Man says, tightly. That isn't a yes or a no, but it's sure not a great thing to hear under any circumstances.
Iron Man if Iron Man hadn't told him in time. He's incredibly grateful for the information.
Tony got to make his own choices about who he wanted to take to bed. And he very clearly had.
"And I asked you what I was, back then," Steve said, "and you said Wisdom." He was smiling wide enough that his cheeks actually hurt.
Steve opens the door and steps inside. The workshop is just as chaotic as it was the last time Steve was here. Mr. Stark's sitting on a stool on the other side of the closest bench to the door, facing Steve. He has a soldering iron in one hand and a circuit board spread out in front of him. If not for that one morning Steve had caught him at breakfast in a sweatshirt, he might have believed that Mr. Stark didn't own anything that wasn't a business suit, but here he is, once again dressed down. Mr. Stark's wearing blue jeans and that same old, worn MIT sweatshirt, as well as a pair of thick, heavy plastic safety glasses. His hair is sticking up. It's the least put-together Steve has ever seen him. It should be ugly, but somehow even like this, he's still charming. He looks like-- well, honestly, he looks like an engineer. He
Iron Man's mouth is soft and warm against his. A mustache -- Iron Man has a mustache? -- brushes ever so lightly across Steve's skin. It doesn't scratch, it doesn't even tickle, but the barely-there pressure leaves Steve wanting
"It's not the super-soldier serum," Tony says, and Steve's head snaps up in surprise. "Well, it is and it isn't. But you're actually only missing about a decade. I'm sorry. I know that's probably not much of a comfort."
"I just saw the interview," Carol said, softly.
"What--" he starts to ask.
out of the papers, thank God. But I'm not free of it. I'm never free of it." His mouth was a sad, wobbling line. "My car's not exactly inconspicuous. Neither is the armor. But I've been here before, and recently. And so has Iron Man. Until the story about Ty breaks, I don't think they'll have much more to say about that. But if I show up at your place in Brooklyn, that makes me
"Don't be," Iron Man says, the words full of heartfelt intensity, and Steve can see a flash of teeth behind the mouth slit that might be a smile. "Don't you dare be sorry. That was wonderful. I just-- I just--" He sighs. "I shouldn't ask this -- God, I'm just going to-- it's just going to make it worse--" He pauses, clearly torn. "Would you do something for me? You don't-- you don't have to."
Tony just stares. Eyebrows still raised, he sprawls back onto Steve's pillows, artfully, like he wouldn't know how not to be graceful if he tried.
The news anchor was still talking. "Scarlotti was found dead several weeks ago, a victim of foul play; police reported no leads on the identity of the murderer at that time. Scarlotti was a known associate of Trevor Donahue, CEO of Donahue Development, a research and development corporation headquartered in San Francisco." The picture changed again, back to the building Tony was walking out of, rerunning the footage. "Yesterday, Stark was spotted leaving the Manhattan satellite office of Donahue Development. Stark has been a longtime business rival of Donahue, and authorities now suspect Scarlotti's murder, possibly at the hands of Stark's bodyguard Iron Man, to have been a deadly move in a game of high-stakes corporate warfare. We'll bring you more on this story as we--"
Steve glanced back at the muted television. He knew what he'd seen in the corner of the screen, but he was hoping against hope that it said something different. It didn't. The entire screen was now, in fact, displaying the station's logo as they cut to commercial. SNN. Stone News Network.
Tony's shadowed shape disappeared into the bedroom, and Steve flopped over on the couch and flung one arm over his eyes.
Oh. Oh, geez. Tony could see how that was a problem. Steve had taken so long to get used to the future, to finally settle in. And Zemo had taken that away from him.
Right now, it was all on him. What if he wasn't enough?
He'd seen this before. Maybe not this exact thing. He'd seen something like this before very recently, hadn't he? God, what was he thinking of? What had he seen?
He also needs to make sure that those plans don't leave this building. His mission objective has become a little more complicated. It was already complicated. But he can do this. He has to.
"No, seriously, I would have." Steve sighed. "I had a lot of learning to do, about relationships. About putting in effort. Showing your partner that you're there for them, that you care about them. Not taking them for granted." That hadn't been the last straw, for him and Bernie, but it had definitely contributed to them breaking up. "And I wasn't good when things got tough. I wasn't any good when someone needed... support." Rachel had been through a hell of a lot, and it wasn't Steve's story to tell. But he definitely hadn't been good at managing his own feelings about any of it.
And then he's gone.
Tiberius laughed, a cruel and harsh sound. "But, you know, it was just so much
Tiberius, strangely, looked much more composed than Tony did. Tony was still staring at Steve, dumbstruck, but Tiberius took in the scene with equanimity, chuckled, and adjusted the tie of his borrowed robe.
," Tony said. "You really think he'll agree to this?"
It was going to be all right. Steve couldn't possibly hate the truth that much, could he? It was going to be just fine. He had a good feeling about this.
"Like that," Steve breathed. The pace was just right, the pressure light enough to be a tantalizing tease, the way he sometimes liked to work himself up, knowing it wasn't quite enough to push him over the edge. And then he realized this really wasn't enough. It wasn't how he wanted it at all. He didn't want Tony to tease him. He wanted everything. "You can-- just a little tighter-- oh--"
"Yep." Tony's voice was nonchalant. "I figured that since I already had metal molded in the shape of someone's shin, I might as well get some use out of it. Hooray for emergency medicine, right?"
Is it lying, really, if it's not the whole truth?
Tony's mouth twitched again, and he let the newspaper slide out of his hand to the floor. Then he was gone.
Tony chuckles. "Sure, of course," he says. "It's not an offer anyone else I've known has ever made me, I can tell you that much. It had sheer novelty going for it. And you're-- you're
He ought to tell Steve someday. He really ought to tell Steve. It had been nearly ten years. But he just couldn't stop fretting about what Steve would think of him, if he knew the truth. Steve was his friend, and he didn't want to ruin that.
So Tony had to reason this out from the other direction. He knew who resided in the mansion, and he knew it wasn't his own gear, even though the Avengers always kept a room open for him. Six people on the team plus Jarvis meant there were seven people living in the mansion.
It was like trying to reconcile two separate images into stereo vision: there was Captain America, pure and unsullied, and then there was Steve, who
"True," Tony said, beaming at him and setting his arm in a sling, and at this point the movement barely registered as pain. "I like to suck your cock before you go on your morning run, and
! It would have been so easy--"
Steve wondered if it would be a good idea to suggest a temporary leave of absence for Tony, until it all blew over.
. "He'll know."
Steve was glaring. "In this house we don't joke about concussions, mister."
Oh, no. Too late, Steve saw where this was really going.
, which is to say that Tony is completely naked, lying on the bed, and tied up with about a hundred feet of rope.
The familiar longing scraped at his skin, hollowed out his heart. He was just going to have to live with it.
amount of money. I could have just stayed home, stepped back from my business responsibilities, reduced my stress, hired the best oncologists I could find, and spent all my time trying to eke out a little more time." Tony licks his lips. "But that's-- it's not
And Tony was still talking. "He also had a few convincing arguments that you didn't have. Things you didn't know. I have no idea if you're still listening. Probably not." He sighed once more, even more heavily. A car honked somewhere in the background. Was he driving? "But I'll pretend you are, so I'll start from the beginning. You know how the news has been trying to paint Donahue and me as rivals? I don't know if you read any of those articles. Those were all lies. Well, sort of. The rivalry wasn't Donahue versus me. The rivalry was Donahue and Ty's father... versus my father. Yeah."
"Hey," Mr. Stark says, and Steve knows he's been spotted. "You can come here. It's okay." His voice is gentle, coaxing.
"Okay," Carol said softly, and then louder. "Okay. You don't want to talk about it." Her jaw firmed up, and she half-smiled. Her eyes went bright. "Then do you want to fight about it?"
That was what Carol had been trying to warn him about.
have done it, so thank you. You were really good with that kid. I was watching you the whole time and I still don't know how you calmed him down."
"Yeah," Steve agreed, ruefully, as he headed across the room and bent down to rifle through what had been left of his uniform. "I sure wish I could take the day off, too. But duty calls."
"Hey, Winghead, there you are!" There was fondness in Tony's voice. Of course there was. Tony loved him. Just not-- not like
He's not sure how Tony thinks he's going to suit up if he can't even stand up. Maybe Tony hasn't thought that far ahead.
Steve just gave him a look, the one Tony saw sometimes when Steve thought he'd said something wrong but wasn't pushing it. And it was weird for Steve to not push it, but, well, he had other concerns right now. Steve shifted his weight on the bed, gasping as the plug slid within him.
Tony kept fucking Steve with his fingers. He was loosening up fast, loose enough now for the plug, no problem. "Maybe next time I'll bring the armor.
Carol hugged him even harder, and all the air jolted out of his lungs. It was all right. He didn't need to breathe, did he? His eyes were hot again. He needed to not cry on Carol's shoulder.
Steve smiled at him, and Tony smiled back.
He turned back. Tony was now wearing the clothes Steve had given him and had stretched out on the bed. The rest of his suit was in a messy pile on the floor. His mouth was a thin, tense line, and he definitely hadn't looked like that a couple minutes ago.
"Tony." Steve taps the side of Tony's jaw, the scruff of his beard, and Tony raises his eyes. "I'm offering double."
"Mmm." Tony couldn't help but smile back, behind the faceplate, as he crouched down by the outlet, probes in hand. Two could play at that game. "I'm hoping to fit in a few more firsts before the day is over. If you're interested."
Tony's chest was covered in raw, half-healed scars, pink and shiny, a massive starburst of wounds centered on his sternum, where there was something metallic protruding from his chest. It looked like a port for something, a medical port, but Steve couldn't tell what. It looked like something that hurt. A lot. It looked
"I was hoping for it," said a voice that must have belonged to Flag Smasher -- the downside of the guy being one of Steve's villains was that Tony didn't know him all that well. But he recognized that universal constant: sadistic supervillain glee. "And, I see, you were foolish enough to come alone. Do you really think you can escape the trap I've laid for you?"
Tony couldn't quite follow Steve's reasoning anymore. It probably wasn't meant to be innuendo, but Tony didn't know what it was actually meant to be. He blamed the severe trauma.
"I love you," Steve whispers against Iron Man's mouth, and he knows Iron Man can't say it back, not like this, but he feels Iron Man smile. He can feel the traces of tears on Iron Man's cheek, trickling into his mustache, and he raises his head and kisses them away.
And then Tiberius' expression changed again. Steve knew, without knowing exactly how he knew, that this was the real Tiberius. This was what was beneath all the pretty lies.
This got an even better reaction. Tony's hand came up and slid through Tony's hair. Tony wasn't holding his head down. Tony wasn't pushing him. Tony wasn't even guiding him. He was just there, as if he'd decided that the way to show his appreciation was to touch Steve even more, as much of Steve as he could reach. And suddenly it all felt even better, like this; Steve hadn't known he was missing it until he had it. He felt even closer to Tony, somehow, when Tony was touching him.
But one of those ways means Ghost doesn't get the drive.
Steve's hand is still extended above his head, drive clenched securely in his fist.
And Steve knew that, because Steve knew him, after all. Steve was just... scared.
"I was
He's kneeling on hot desert sands as Osborn beats him, beats him to death. Blood is dripping down his face.
And maybe Tony will get lucky again. He seems to think he might. And Tony makes excellent predictions. Steve will take it. Steve has to take it.
This, finally, got a reaction out of Tony. "We met when we were
For many other people, it might have been up to the cops. But Tiberius had already hired one supervillain to try to kill Tony, and when the power levels involved got that high, the police weren't going to be able to help. Not without endangering themselves. That was what superheroes were for.
"Can I do anything to help?" Steve asked, standing up.
So it's hard not to be a little disappointed -- just a little, because he's still
But Steve already knew what Tony's answer would be.
Steve can't say as he's too thrilled about seeing Mr. Stark again, given how their last conversation went, but Iron Man wouldn't have made the offer if it weren't all right. He hopes it's going to be all right. Maybe Iron Man talked to Mr. Stark and convinced him to change his mind about them.
Steve had been to dozens of these events over the years. Maybe hundreds. They were all more or less the same, in his experience. He stood around in a room of rich people. He smiled. He shook hands. He chatted about the usual inconsequential conversational topics. And this party looked the same as all the rest. But at least this one had a few guests who were his actual friends. Jan and Hank were on the far side of the room, talking to Warren Worthington. Steve smiled, happy to see a few familiar faces -- but, wait, was that
It wouldn't do him any good. Tony wasn't going to change his mind about Tiberius, obviously, and there was nothing anyone could do about that. He'd tried. He and Tony had both made their choices. It was over.
Steve's face fell. "Oh," he said, in a considerably more morose tone. "I was-- I was just hoping you had some news about Hank or Jan." He sighed and stepped back, waving Tony in. "Well, come on in anyway, Shellhead. I'm not going to leave you standing in the hallway."
Steve wants to comfort Iron Man, but Iron Man keeps talking over him even as he opens his mouth.
"I do need to eat sooner rather than later," Steve admitted, a little guiltily, "but I'm definitely not opposed to staying here a little longer." He didn't quite want to rejoin the outside world yet. He slid an arm over Tony's side. "I like the thought of dating you, though. A lot."
They're almost to Stark Tower, and Steve's positive that Tony will be even worse by the time they get there.
"You talked to Mr. Stark, didn't you?"
That was... well, that was one hell of a responsibility, honestly. But Steve could step up. He loved Tony, and Tony could have whatever he wanted from him. Steve could give him this.
Steve had always wondered how Tony had felt, back when he'd still been having heart attacks. But now he didn't have to wonder anymore, because it felt like his heart had stopped, as terror swamped him.
"What the hell did you do to me?"
Distraught and guilty, Steve just stares, and after several seconds he recovers enough to stumble through an apology. "Mr. Stark, I'm so sorry! Speaking for the team, sir, I sincerely regret that the Avengers in any way endangered you--"
He waved his hand, and as the audience laughed at his joke -- Steve had the vague idea that that had been a Star Wars joke, somehow -- the screen changed again. Now the woman was wearing flowing robes and swinging a glowing sword, fighting another robed figure, a man with horns and red-patterned skin. His sword looked more like a staff. He reminded Steve of Mephisto, just a little. It was probably also a Star Wars film, but Steve hadn't seen this one.
He's made his point clear. He bares his teeth. He shows his fangs.
Steve's not going to say that. But it works out to the same thing.
, after all. Somehow.
Then Tony looked back at him, fear in his eyes, like he was actually worried that Steve might believe the news story rather than the truth. "The worst part is," Tony rasped, "that they're not entirely wrong. Iron Man did kill Whiplash. And I was in the armor. But the armor was
He tried to find some kind of silver lining to this. So maybe Tony hadn't trusted him with this in the beginning, or five years ago. Maybe Tony hadn't even trusted him with this six weeks ago. But Tony trusted him now. That was worth something.
," Tony corrected himself, looking miserable. "He hit me with one of those whips. Lightning strike. That was all it took. And the armor woke up." He looked even more miserable.
He swallowed hard, hoped his face was impassive, and looked up. Carol was at the top of the stairs heading down, in full Avengers uniform. She was probably next up on the monitors. He'd forgotten about the shift change. Damn.
"Thanks," Steve says. "Me too."
Box tucked under his arm, he headed across the room, unplugged his phone, and then nearly dropped it when he saw what it said.
They walk in silence, up the stairs, down the second floor hallway, and they come to a halt in front of Steve's door.
Tony glanced up, saw the shield, and visibly relaxed. He nodded. Then he reached down and yanked the headset off Tiberius' head.
"You're going to think I--" Steve began, and he started chuckling, and he couldn't finish his sentence. He took another breath and tried again. "In my defense, I'd completely forgotten everything other than how much I liked the ending when I recommended it to you. I'd just like you to know that."
"AIM happened," Tony said. "You remember, there were missiles? I think you got knocked out by the missile impact, which is what you get for not wearing your seatbelt. Then I had to put the jet down somewhere, which wasn't easy, but." He half-smiled. "I think this is the part where you're supposed to say
Stone definitely seemed like he was trying to win the handshake, a competition that Steve had always detested, and not just because he was strong enough now that it was unfair for him to play. Steve let him win, and he let go. Stone's smile was broader.
Tony's report about the situation had been unusually brief, terse almost to a point where it would have been entirely uninformative. He'd sustained some cardiac damage during his final fight with the armor, but he was recovering. He didn't expect any of it to interfere with the performance of his duties. Then Tony had started buttoning up his shirts again.
"What," Steve asked, amused, "somehow you missed seeing the fella in the flag costume?"
Bitterness wells up in Steve's throat. Ghost wants to hurt Tony. And he is. He already is. He just doesn't know he is.
Jan bites her lip. "I just... had a question," she says. "You don't have to answer it. I was just wondering."
"And you're your own bodyguard," Steve concludes. "And no one notices." The words taste sour. "I sure didn't."
This time Steve's entire body shuddered and his cock jerked, and Tony wasn't even touching him. Yeah, he liked that. "Please," he said again.
Steve crouched down on his bike, weaving through the traffic at a speed that most people would have called extremely ill-advised. It wasn't one of the safer things he'd ever done. He passed a sedan on the left, swinging out into what were thankfully entirely empty parking places at this time of night, and he opened the throttle as the driver started yelling about
"Not much of a story there, I'm afraid," Steve said, finally. "I don't like wearing them just for play with a stranger, and I've... never been with anyone serious enough who wanted to give me one long-term."
"Tony," he said. Tony tensed like he was actually bracing for a punch, and Steve didn't want to think about who had hit him, or why. "This doesn't change how I feel about you."
"What's on the thirty-third floor?" Steve asks, because he needs to know what he's heading into.
But what was he supposed to say?
Steve turned to face him. His fingertips skimmed Tony's jaw. "I didn't come here for the fella from the headlines, Tony," Steve said, softly.
Well, yeah, of course there was. Tiberius had killed four people yesterday, and he'd tried to kill Tony twice. But in their line of work, that was ordinary. And Tony had definitely dated people who'd tried to kill him. But he'd never looked like this about any of the rest of them, like his faith in humanity had been ripped away.
"Sure, you did." Maybe if Steve talks about it, he'll start to feel better about it. "No, you didn't shoot Ghost in the head. But you don't have to solve every problem that way, do you? And it's probably better if you don't. What you did-- it worked." Steve's throat is tight again; he hopes Tony doesn't notice him forcing out the words. "And everything's okay. I'm okay. I'm still here. It turned out fine."
He strode over to his bedroom and set the shield down in its usual spot, next to the bed. It would still be fairly accessible to him even if he successfully managed to convince Tony to take his bed tonight and leave him the couch, which he was hoping he could do. And Tony might find it reassuring. A place had to be secure if Steve was willing to be separated a little from his shield.
know him. Are you telling me you're really okay with that?"
Right now, Tony was alive, and Tony was going to be safe, and Tony still wanted to be his friend, and that was enough. It had to be enough, because it was all he was ever going to get.
"You were great out there today, Shellhead," Steve tells him. "That was amazing."
"Nice is the point this time," Steve agrees, and Tony hums again.
Another coughing fit is trying to come on. If everyone leaves soon, he can make it to the bathroom sink.
Unless--
That's what you say now if you're breaking up with someone.
"It's nice of you to say so." Tony's smile wasn't reaching his eyes anymore. "But come on. We both know I'm a serious disappointment. It's okay to admit it."
Steve's brother died in 1972. The last time Steve saw him was 1945. He'd woken up and Doug was already dead. He'll never see him again.
"Of course I'll give him back," Ghost says, cheerful once again. He's clearly lying. "Come on, then, Iron Man. The password."
Steve pictured himself showing up on one of Tiberius Stone's innumerable channels, explaining it all to one of the sneering TV hosts. He'd do the right thing. He'd tell the truth. They'd all have to listen. They'd see what Tiberius had done to Tony.
He swallowed hard, briefly grateful that his expression was obscured by the armor, and glanced over to find Steve staring up at the mansion, his jaw tensed as if, underneath the cowl, his face were identically furrowed.
Steve realized he wasn't doing a great job not staring at the livid, bruised shadows of kisses on Tony's neck.
"How's this?" Steve asks, just to make sure. "You're okay if I'm--?" He gestures at himself.
"Yeah," Steve said. "Yeah, I can think of something else."
The boy looks up at him and shakes his head, mute. His eyes are wide, terrified, and he takes a step back.
"That last energy bolt," Tony gasped. "Didn't-- didn't even touch the armor. Went right through me underneath the armor, though. I'm bleeding out."
"Good," Steve said, thickly. "Nice. Heavy."
"Doctor," Tony says, in acknowledgment, turning to face him. He doesn't bother wiping his face off.
Oh, Christ, what had happened to the
Ghost
But Mr. Stark smiles. "It's all right. I was just surprised, is all. I wasn't expecting it. No one's ever said anything like that to me before. I didn't, um. I didn't know things were that way between you and Iron Man. I mean, I knew you liked the guy, but I didn't know this. I didn't know you were this serious about him." There's a kind of awe in his eyes now, and Steve has no idea what to make of this.
Oh, he'd heard of
"It's-- it's-- it's about me," Tony said.
If he passes out, Steve is going to call a doctor, no matter what Mr. Stark has to say about it. He's not about to watch Mr. Stark dying in front of him and do nothing about it.
"What
But of course Carol was shocked. She had no idea it was about--
He could still fight. He brought his left hand up again. Something about his right hand felt wrong, but he found he wasn't really interested in thinking about that as he punched out again and--
Then they started to imply that Tony had started drinking again, and that was when Steve nearly punched the television. They'd found a photo of Tony at a Maria Stark Foundation gala last year, fundraising for the Avengers, holding a champagne flute. It was a champagne flute that Steve knew for a fact had been filled with non-alcoholic sparkling apple juice. He knew that because he, personally, had gone to the bartender, tipped a whole lot extra, watched him pour two glasses from a brand-new bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider that Steve had watched him open in front of him and never take out of his sight, and then Steve had tasted one of them himself. Just to make sure. And then he'd taken it anyway, too, because what did it matter if he had real champagne or not? He didn't mind not drinking around Tony. He'd put the other glass into Tony's hands himself. A lot of people would have liked Tony to slip up, and Tony had known that he could always, always trust Steve.
!" Tony snarls, and he's on his feet, he's yelling now, stabbing a finger in Stephen's direction. "All you were supposed to do was make him forget about the Illuminati's little problem.
"I'm sorry," Steve says, lowering his gaze, stepping back--
Oh. This was Tiberius Stone. Tony's friend from boarding school. The man of the hour.
"No," Tony said, immediately. He sighed. "Okay, maybe. But it's not-- I guess I should have expected you'd be-- yeah, I know the gay thing is a lot to deal with. I get it. I was just hoping that when you'd said nothing was going to be different, that was going to be what was really going to happen."
Tony sinks down into the chair, leans back, and beckons Steve. "Come on over."
Tony has a plan.
Even when Iron Man's available, he's never available continuously. Steve always figured he'd be the one with the annoyingly early bedtime, but every night he sees Iron Man, Iron Man always has to excuse himself, and he never actually gives excuses. Steve's wondered if it's some kind of medical problem, but surely anyone who spends his day in a suit of armor, fighting supervillains, would be in perfect health. He knows it's not his place to ask about that, either. Iron Man's good enough to fight with the Avengers, and that's all that should concern Steve. If Iron Man wants to tell him, he'll tell him. Steve understands. Iron Man values his privacy.
"Aww, no, Shellhead." Steve said, softly. "Nothing's ruined. I'm sure we can get the mood back if you want."
"Absolutely not!" Steve growled, with a voice he hadn't known he possessed. He was several times louder than he needed to be, nearly shouting. He could hear his voice reverberate in the nearly-empty room.
"I wish I could touch you," Steve says. The need is a physical ache, throbbing beneath his breastbone. It's not quite desire, it's not quite lust, not right now, but it's
"Yeah." A dark, tension-filled undercurrent ripples through Mr. Stark's voice, a warning, but his eyes are terrifyingly blank, like the inside of his head is a thousand miles away. This isn't good. This isn't nice. They don't even
"But Freeman--" Tony began.
"Well," Tony says, and now he sounds almost mocking, "most people would quit their fucking job, but you, you're going to say something noble like--"
He met Tony's eyes. Tony was nodding thoughtfully.
"Look," Steve said, finally. "I know you think it's, I don't know, funny, but I wish you wouldn't say things you didn't mean--"
But that's not what's happening now. Tony's arms encircle him, shaking with fatigue, and Tony definitely hasn't safeworded. Tony needs this.
The hand had splinted easily enough, it was only the hand and not the wrist, and it was setting nicely. He could hang his shield on his arm if he had to; he'd be combat-ready in an emergency. But it wasn't ideal, and it sure didn't stop him from feeling like a colossal idiot. He hadn't solved any of his problems. He'd just made more of them. Now he was still upset, sad, and jealous
He knew the guilt was written across his face, because Steve's skin went bone-white. "Oh, God," Steve said, low and miserable.
"Hey, no," he said, a little sharper than he meant to, and Tony tensed under his hands. "Sorry, not you. Him. You don't know he's not going to prison. No, you don't," he said, as Tony opened his mouth to protest, exhaling warmth at the base of Steve's throat. "Sure, I know he's rich. And I know not everything can stick. But he's killed a lot of people, and he didn't do his own wetwork."
Steve dared to reach out, to put his hand on Tony's arm. He didn't usually touch Tony without gloves on. Tony was warm under his fingers, and Tony didn't move away. And Tony wasn't ever going to love him like he wanted. He had to accept that.
Steve was still smiling.
He clipped the remaining chain to Steve's ankle, ran it up through the O-ring on Steve's chest, and back down to his other ankle. Assuming the harness held, the chain was too short to allow him to stretch his legs; he had to bring his knees up almost to his chest. It was the poor man's version of predicament bondage.
Tony just wished he knew what the right thing was.
, of course, but he'd really been hoping to go down on him.
"No, of course you couldn't have known," Tony said, soothing, placating. "I understand. I wasn't thinking. I'm so, so sorry. I overreacted." He half-smiled, a rueful expression. "Yeah, I know, bad habit. You know me."
Steve dared, finally, to touch Tony the way he'd been wanting to for so many years. He reached out, closing the space between them, cupping Tony's face with his hand. His fingers slid over Tony's stubbled jawline, like he'd always longed to do, caressing him, learning the shape of him by feel, an intimacy he'd never before been permitted. Tony's skin was hot, still damp with the traces of tears. He trembled when Steve touched him. He pressed hungrily against Steve's hand, pushing into Steve's touch, a motion so instinctive that Steve wondered if he was even aware he was doing it.
A muscle in Steve's jaw tightens. "Am I free to go?"
Steve interrupted her. "We're both fine. Absolutely fine." Far better than fine, honestly. Not that he was about to tell Jan that. "I know I didn't report in. I'm sorry." What exactly was he going to say? "It was just that Tony was-- he was--"
Belt undone, leaving Steve in debauched disarray, Tony's fingers were now tracing the top button of Steve's jeans, tapping against the worn brass. Tony always liked metal, clearly.
magic. It was like an illusion.
Iron Man sends him a message on his identicard at ten p.m. exactly:
"Probably," Tony agreed. They had a lot of lost time to make up for.
"That's what I like to hear," Tony said, and he slid his hand back up Steve's chest to start working on the fastening of Steve's uniform shirt.
It was a sound strategy; in Tony's experience, magicians were pretty damn slippery. And, given the fact that if the guy was going to run anywhere it was probably going to be up rather than down, it made it less likely that he was going to run into their newest Avenger while doing so. But the way Steve had phrased it, it also wasn't likely to leave Tigra feeling slighted, because he wasn't asking her to do anything he wasn't also asking a founding Avenger to do. And Steve had undoubtedly taken all of that into account. It was just another one of the ways in which Steve was the best of all of them.
Tony rolls Steve over like he's arranging a toy and pulls the covers up over him, ready to head out the door and think about his own life choices. This was necessary. All of it. Steve can't be allowed to interfere with the rest of the Illuminati. They had to wipe his memory of the relevant events. There was nothing else they could do. There was nothing else he could have done.
with lust. He's never really thought of it as a tactical flaw before.
"Oh, yeah?" Steve asked. "You think so?"
Tony had pretty much the same expression on his face now.
"I have an idea," he said. "Don't know if it'll be enough. But I think it just might work. I have to grab something from the living room for it, though. Back in a couple minutes, okay? Yell if you need me."
"Boxer's fracture," Steve admitted. "Fourth
He was happy. He'd been happy. Steve had seen that. So why was he hiding it?
Tony's face went three shades paler. "Oh my God," he breathed, and he shot out of his chair in an instant. In another few seconds, he was at Steve's side, reaching out for him, not quite touching him. "Steve, what happened?" he asked. His tone was an odd mixture of Avengers professionalism and what sounded like utter terror. "Oh God. Are you okay? When did this happen?"
But Tony was still smiling. "Want to kiss you while you come," he murmured. His fingers encircled Steve's cock, the gentlest of pressure. His hands could be so delicate. He loved Tony's hands. It wasn't going to take long, the way Steve was worked-up tonight. "Besides, I believe someone here wanted to come all over my stomach."
This was working. Tony was sounding a little better. Unfortunately, Steve could tell from the tension in his stance that he still wasn't all that far from falling apart. He was fidgeting with the shield strap with one hand and his other hand was picking nervously at his jacket. His shoulders were a little slumped, his head tilted a bit too far down. Most people probably would have had to see Tony's face to read him, but Steve had spent a decade needing to be able to tell what Tony was thinking while he was standing six foot six in full body armor. With only a helmet, this was actually the easy version.
"After ViaStone completes the DreamVision rollout," Tiberius continued, as he stood up and walked toward the computer, "the ViaStone cable box itself will directly deliver the user's requested content, obviously. But for the time being, I'll have to do the honors."
?" The grin was really more of a smirk now. "I know you can hit harder than that."
"Oh?"
Tony kisses him again, lightly. "Happy anniversary," he says again, his voice soft. "I'm hoping for a lot more of 'em with you."
There's also a coiled extension cord, and these days Tony probably really does need it. His heart is -- well, his heart's not what it used to be, but in another sense, his heart's a whole lot like what it used to be.
"Good?" Tony asked, because he was, as ever, hungry for Steve's praise, and he didn't mind fishing for Steve's compliments.
Right now that's actually not a good sign.
"You always do." The reply is instant, earnest. Tony believes in him. Tony's always believed in him.
Steve sure hopes it means something.
"You'll see," Tiberius said, smiling wider. "I'm going to change the world."
Ghost hauls him upright like the proverbial sack of flour, and there's something cool and solid pressed against Steve's temple.
"Hi, boys," Steve said, presumably to Flag Smasher and whichever hired goons were present. "Expecting me?"
"I love you," Steve says, simply.
"Yes, but--"
He realized that Tony had very carefully not told him what had happened to his heart. Steve didn't even know what he was looking at. He was ignorant. Because Tony, much like he'd done about the fact of his relationship with Tiberius, had attempted to keep Steve in the dark about it.
Tony pressed even tighter, trying to close every single fraction of an inch that could possibly separate their bodies. His head dipped and he kissed Steve's ear. A ripple of unexpected pleasure ran through Steve; he shuddered, overextended his balance, and when Tony ground his hips against him again he tipped over, flat on his back, pulling Tony over on top of him.
Steve stroked Tony's shoulder. "You didn't know. You couldn't know. There was no way you could have known. He knew you. He knew you very well. And he didn't want to get caught. There's nothing for you to be ashamed of."
But the oddest thing of all is that Iron Man's hands look
Steve wasn't. And, God, if Tony would let him he'd spend the rest of his life showing him.
He couldn't just let that pass unchallenged. "
He had the feeling Tony wanted him to ask. "Have I?"
. I can't stop thinking about what he did. I keep seeing him over and over. Nothing feels safe at all."
Even now, Tony seemed determined to go slow. Tony kissed him, slow and lingering, a kiss much sweeter than Steve had expected from someone who was offering to blow him. But then, Tony was very obviously extremely in love. He just hadn't said so. But it was clear with every word, every gesture. If Tony didn't want to say it back, that was okay. Steve could wait. It had been a hell of a day.
The sensation of phasing through solid glass is indescribable. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but his stomach lurches with vertigo and he goes lightheaded, as if somehow his entire body knows this isn't somewhere he's supposed to be.
"The problem, as I understand it," Tony said, "is that you spent so long thinking this wasn't okay. Not the gay thing. Which is probably why you weren't expecting this. You thought you were okay with that. But the problem is me, specifically. Wanting me." He licked his lips. Steve didn't know how to tell him he was exactly right. "Intimately. Physically. Carnally." He pronounced the words slowly, deliberately, and Steve realized he was staring at Tony's mouth. He was hot all over. "Loving me, that was fine. Love's a good feeling. Noble. Generous. Makes people feel better. But wanting me? That wasn't okay. You told yourself you were some kind of pervert, lusting after your straight friend. And then you found out I wasn't straight, but you thought I didn't want you, so it was still wrong to want me. And now you know none of that's true, but all the thoughts you had still feel wrong, so when you think about everything you've wanted, you remember that it felt wrong. It feels like too much. Like you want it all too much. More than anyone should ever want anything." That was exactly it. But how did Tony know? "You feel like you're just this... predatory mess. A swamp of coarse, base emotions and forbidden desires, greedy and needy." Tony spat out the words. "Objectifying someone you care about. The opposite of kindness and generosity. If I could see inside your head, see what you thought about, what really got you off, everything you thought about me, I'd be appalled." Tony's mouth was twisted. "Am I on the right track?"
"Of course, Trish," the in-studio host said, "the question on everyone's minds right now is obvious. Could this be a plot cooked up by Tony Stark and Iron Man to seek revenge against Tiberius Stone for the story implicating both of them in Mark Scarlotti's death?"
He kept walking. There wasn't anything Tony needed to say to him right now. There couldn't be.
Steve has an idea. He's not even sure it's a good idea. But now that he's thought of it, he can't not say it.
He still doesn't know what he's going to say to Mr. Stark, if Mr. Stark is there too -- and why wouldn't he be? It's his workshop. Maybe Mr. Stark has to upgrade the armor. Maybe that's why Iron Man keeps disappearing, every night, in such a hurry. He did it last night, too, excusing himself fast; there hadn't been a lot of time for kissing, although Steve's honestly not sure that any amount of time could be enough. Iron Man's an incredibly good kisser.
Tony was studying him, watching his reaction. "Huh," he said, thoughtfully. "I guess Rhodey never told you about her, then."
When Steve heads downstairs for breakfast, Iron Man's not there -- but Mr. Stark is.
Tony still hadn't said the word
Steve sat on the edge of his bed, sighed, and rubbed at his eyes.
"It's not
It was a hell of a speech. The words were a spark, a flame within Steve, kindling pride and admiration and awe, everything he'd felt when he'd awoken a decade ago and a blue-eyed stranger in red-gold armor had held out his hands, and it had felt for all the world as if Steve had already known him, all along.
As far as Steve is concerned, Iron Man can do a lot better than just
"I can fix him."
Tony just kept staring at Steve. He looked like he couldn't believe that Steve would be willing to do any of this for him.
"Like you said, it's late." Steve waited a beat. "And it's instant coffee."
"Yeah," Steve said, his voice gone rough. "Yeah, I am." He coughed. "I'm still an Avenger, though. As far as I know."
"Isn't it obvious?" Tony asked and, no, it was definitely not obvious to Steve. "It's about ethics in journalism! Ty has a duty to the truth. It wouldn't be right for him to kill a story just because he and I have a relationship, would it? He has more integrity than that."
didn't used to include orgasms, but Steve can't say he's complaining.
He was sweet. That wasn't a surprise; Steve did know him. He'd often wondered why the sweetest and kindest man he knew had had such terrible luck in love because surely anyone would have wanted someone like Tony. Maybe it was just that Steve loved him so much that he felt everyone else must as well. And now, finally, Steve had a chance to show him.
He had no idea what he was looking at. The room was some kind of cross between an office and a laboratory, with two narrow beds placed head-to-head, on a waist-height metal platform, with a messy pile of electronic equipment between them. Tony and Tiberius were lying on the beds, seemingly unconscious. Oddly, they were both in their underwear. When Steve had been trying to come up with reasons why Tony's clothing had been in a pile on the floor, this definitely hadn't occurred to him.
"You deserve it." Steve's voice was unaccountably rough.
Tony had somehow figured out exactly how Steve liked it, and when he swiped his thumb over the head of his cock, Steve groaned and came as Tony kissed him more fiercely. When Tony's mouth left his, he couldn't help it; he glanced down, and saw that he'd come over the trembling muscles of Tony's abs, smeared messy and white, marking him, and he watched as his cock jerked again and spurted once more in Tony's hand. He was going to keep that image in this thoughts all right.
He says it like he's ashamed of wanting kindness. Like he thinks no one would ever offer him it. Steve wonders who the hell he used to take to bed.
The thing was, it wasn't Tony's box.
"You've been so good," Tony assured him, and then his mouth got caught on the rest of the words like a tangle of broken wires. "But I don't--" he said unsteadily. "I don't look... like you. If you know what I mean."
know what it is, though," Tony said. "Ty treated you like shit, and I didn't even notice. And you've never worried about that from me, but now you can't help but wonder. If I would." He sighed again, and Steve thought maybe he was right. "And I know you know I wouldn't, but there's knowing and there's
"Thank you," Tony says, softly. He takes a hesitant step in Steve's direction. "So, maybe you want to try the kissing part again?"
Steve's eyes were dark and dazed, his ass and thighs were starting to streak with red lines, and his cock was dripping down his thigh, so wet that he was already making a mess of the bed. Maybe Steve could fuck him without lube, could slick up Tony and make Tony take him just with how wet he got, Tony thought, and then he realized he was fondling himself through his pants at the idea of it. Even if it couldn't happen, it was worth a good six months of jerk-off fantasies.
Everything in him twists in knots as he reaches up to silence the earpiece he's wearing. He knows it's the right thing to do, but he feels like he's betraying Tony. He promised Tony he'd be here for him.
At Tony's urging, he repeats the process on Tony's other arm, and then moves to Tony's leg, where the same thing happens with the boots. The soles of the boots are thick, separate pieces, but the boots themselves detach from them and retract into the cuffs, and then the same thing happens with the metal covering Tony's legs. Steve hadn't quite realized until this moment that Tony has
If Dane said yes, no problem. Then it was his. If he said no, it was Monica's.
Steve just kept his hands on Tony's back, tracing aimless designs over the cotton of his dress shirt. "And I know you know all this," he said, "but right now it sounds like it might help to hear it. You're tired, you've had a terrible day, you've had a terrible week, and I'm sure you've barely eaten and you've barely slept. And I'm not here to make you do anything you don't want to do, but I think you know you'd feel better if you could take care of some of those needs. And I'm happy to help."
if it's pity."
Tony's mouth twitched and he lowered his head. "You missed my pretty face, huh?"
A muscle in Tony's jaw twitched.
"Yeah, honey," Tony said. "That's kind of the point. Can't get any painkillers worth a damn in you with your metabolism the way it is, so this is how you're going to get your nice happy endorphins."
Steve turned around and tried to see what Tony was seeing in the crowd. No one was standing out. Not to him.
He wanted Tony to touch him everywhere. He'd been watching Tony's hands for years, watching and wondering
But Tony had seen the hesitation on his face, even if he hadn't known why. "I know it's a lot to ask," he said, almost too softly to be heard. "And I know it's even more selfish of me. But Ty was right about one thing: I'm newsworthy. For right now, the cops are keeping" -- he waved a hand -- "
"Magnets!" Tony says, his smile brimming with pride, and Steve realizes Tony's never really gotten to show off the armor, not like this. He's beginning to suspect Tony's the kind of guy who loves talking about the things he's made, and he hasn't been able to tell Steve the half of it before now. "Wonderful things, aren't they? The metal itself is actually a flexible mesh that polarizes when it's all hooked up. That's how it molds itself to my body and provides actual armoring."
. He just didn't know it.
Surely Tony would understand now.
Another lie. It has to be. There's no other possible explanation.
Tony's staring at him, frozen. One hand is raised, but he's not even aiming at where he has to know Ghost must be. The set of his stance is confused, off-balance, his head tilted. He looks like he's trying to remember what to do. His hand is still trembling. Steve realizes now that he didn't unmute Tony on the comms. Steve can't hear Tony at all, if he's saying anything. The only sound in the room now is Steve choking, gasping, the desperate need for air burning in his lungs. It's so hard to work free when he can't see what he's doing.
And now Steve is actually, truly touched, because on top of everything, Iron Man remembered that Steve used to be an artist. Steve likes art. Iron Man thought about exactly what he might like to do and picked something just for him.
"It's not silly," Steve said, automatically, the familiar reassurance springing instantly to his lips. Tony sometimes got into these moods, where he seemed to think that his feelings weren't worth paying attention to.
His eyes wide, his half-open mouth still slick and red, Tony stares up at him, confused and bereft, like he has no idea what's going on, like he's far enough down that he can't even tell why Steve stopped. That's-- that's not a good sign.
"So the bad news," Tony said, "is that I'm pretty sure Mordo knows we're coming."
Thor brightened, and then he strode across the creaking floor to deposit the box and the crop in front of Tony. "No apologies are necessary! I am gladdened that I have so easily found the rightful owner of these effects."
"It's a little ironic," Tony continued, "that the thing that actually solved it, for me, was getting sober. I'd figured out I wanted to be alive. And then I figured out that there was really no point hating myself for all my deep dark fantasies. It was going to make me happy, and unlike the drinking it wasn't going to kill me while it made me happy, and it wasn't going to hurt anyone else if they starred in my fantasies. So I figured, why not treat myself right for a change? Give myself a little happiness." He was smiling again now, looking a little embarrassed. But just a little. "You've been... a pretty frequent star."
They probably should have done the harness first, because Steve had to sit up again and let Tony buckle him in, but it was all worth it when Tony got to grab him by the harness and drop him to the bed. It wasn't like sparring; Steve was slow and easy, giving himself over to Tony.
He raised an eyebrow. "There's good news?"
Tony took the deepest breath he could, ragged and harsh. "Steve," he forced out, and his voice was barely more than air, and Steve looked up instantly.
Well, he wanted at least one of Tony. The thing was, Tony still wasn't altogether sure of Steve's feelings about the other one, and he was, unfortunately, a package deal.
And now Tony knew exactly how much he didn't spend on personal care. He'd already known, clearly.
"He's a liar," Steve retorted. "Every word out of his mouth was a lie. He's a liar and everything he said tonight, he said to hurt you, to get back at you, to harm you any way he could--"
Tony hissed through gritted teeth. "Steve, we've been over this. He has a duty to report the news accurately. That's-- it's basic journalism. And he admitted the story had been wrong! It's like you said, everyone makes mistakes. Isn't he allowed to make mistakes too?"
Tigra looked down at the computer screen and winced. "Macy's. Herald Square."
"Nope," Tony said, cheerfully.
"But I just love you anyway," Tony said. "Hey, wiggle your fingers, tell me if that's too tight."
to himself, incredulously -- "but, um. I usually do... like... at least a couple more."
Steve returned the handshake. "Happy to be here," he said, as he sat down. It wasn't exactly the truth. "Defending both Mr. Stark and Iron Man from these baseless accusations is a commitment that I consider very close to my heart." That was... a hell of a lot truer. "As one of the two current Avengers chairs, one of my primary responsibilities is to set the record straight, as it were, about any allegations of team misconduct. But, additionally, I'm proud to call both of these men my friends. They're two of the best men I've ever known, and I trust and respect both of them, personally and professionally. And I'm here today because they're both innocent."
"I had a chance," Tiberius continued, more quietly, "because I realized just how weak you were. And that was my way in. You cried because you missed your mother. You cried because your father never loved you. You cried because he liked to get drunk and hit you, remember?" he said, smirking, and God, oh God, this was what Steve hadn't ever wanted to know. "We both know you deserved it. You weren't the son he wanted." He snorted. "All you would have had to do to earn his respect was shape up and be a real man, Tony, and you couldn't even do that!"
and Steve doubted him and Steve has been a goddamn fool.
Steve blew out a breath and then looked him straight in the eye. "Would you like to go out with me?"
Tony had liked it that much? Well, that'd be a first. "Not a put-on," Steve said. "It's all me. Everything I think just comes right out of my mouth when I'm in bed." He grimaced. "Not one of my more popular traits. Rachel told me once that I'd never be able to fuck someone hard enough that they'd forget their own name because I'd be reminding them of it every ten seconds."
"Sort of reminds you of the old days, doesn't it?" Jan asked. "I mean, here we all are, the founding Avengers..."
"And," Iron Man adds, "having a child would absolutely be an irresponsible act on my part."
"Yeah," Steve said, when he trusted himself to be able to speak, to be able to make sure his face and his voice wouldn't give him away. "I was jealous, a bit, at the beginning. It wasn't-- it wasn't very admirable of me. I didn't like him." Maybe Tony wouldn't notice if Steve didn't tell him why. "So I tried to get over it. I tried to be happy for you. I thought he was good for you, because he made you so happy. But then I watched it all go wrong. And I know you don't believe me, but it's the truth. He's hurting you."
And Jan... smiles. "I'm so happy for you," she says, and Steve breathes out in relief. "I suspected, the way you were fretting over him today. But that's so wonderful."
one?"
, Tony thinks, as something wild in the back of his mind laughs with delight.
Tony's back shakes under Steve's fingers as he chuckles. "I'll keep that in mind."
There, that sounded like something that someone who wasn't hopelessly in love with Tony would say.
"No," Tony cuts in, with a wide smile, unfeigned joy. "No, you're
Iron Man doesn't move. Iron Man says nothing.
But, for some reason, Walders was
Lifting his hand off Steve's shoulder, Tony ran his fingers through his hair and blew out a shuddering breath. He rubbed his chest. "I know," he said, softly, and he couldn't quite meet Steve's eyes. "I know I'm an asshole."
"Yeah," Steve says, finally. "Me and Iron Man." Because what else is there to say, really? "We're together."
Steve'a breath hitches, caught in his chest. "All for you." His voice is low, rough, hoarse with desire. He needs this. God, he needs this. "Always for you."
going to do what he did. I promise that. And I know the only way I can prove it to you is if you see me keeping my promise, if you trust me even a little bit, if you trust me to be here with you and not harm you, and I know that's hard right now. I know. I know that when you're feeling vulnerable, everything looks like a weapon. Even the things you know aren't weapons. But you're here, and that's the first step."
He regards Steve with hollow, exhausted eyes, and he manages a flicker of a smile. "Good morning, Captain."
That's the last thing Steve expected to hear. Steve blinks at him. "What?"
Damn it.
Tears dripped down Steve's face. "I love you too," he whispered. "I've always loved you. And I'm going to keep telling you that, because you're going to live through this. You hear me? You're going to be okay. The paramedics will be here soon. You just have to stay with me a little longer."
"So," Iron Man says, like the word is a sentence in and of itself. "I should probably mention that Mr. Stark controls merchandising rights for the Avengers, and sometimes companies send him samples of products they'd like him to approve."
Tony rose up out of Steve's lap, kneeling over him now, momentarily a little too high up for Steve to kiss him again. He was steadying himself against Steve, hands on his shoulders. For a few seconds he didn't know what Tony was doing and he was embarrassed by his own ignorance. This was why he'd never said anything. He didn't know how to do this. He didn't know enough for Tony.
"Wait right here," Steve said.
No time like the present. Steve took a deep breath. He started at Tony's hip, pressing a kiss there, because even though he knew he wasn't going to be great at this, he knew he could at least do his best by heightening the anticipation as much as possible. He kissed his way over Tony's hipbone, his destination obvious, as beneath him Tony shivered and trembled, breathing noisily, like he had to remind himself every few seconds to keep breathing.
Steve licked his lips. "Please," he said again.
isn't the kind of odds Steve most likes to hear.
"You want that, huh?" Tony asked. "You want Iron Man inside you? That's what you think about?"
"I want kids." There's a longing in Iron Man's voice that Steve's never heard before. "I definitely want kids. But I don't think I should have them."
is the way the phrase goes, but the issue here is that they've had so many more options than just hands. And why would he offer Tony a massage when he could offer him a blowjob instead?
He opened his eyes. Hospital, definitely. The world was too bright to make out more details than the bland whiteness of the walls and the eye-searing intensity of the lights. He glanced down. Blanket pulled up to his chest. Hospital gown. Massive amounts of wires snaking under the neck of the gown. Those were EKG leads. Great. His favorite. He glanced right. Blood pressure cuff on his arm. Pulse oximeter on his finger. Hospital bracelet. A bag of liquid hanging next to him, dripping down the tube leading to the IV in his right arm.
And then Iron Man kneels down, putting himself on a level with the kid. "Hey, there," he says. His voice is low, soft, gentle. "You're not in trouble, I promise. I'm Iron Man, and this is my friend Captain America--" he gestures at Steve-- "and we're going to stay here with you until your parents show up. What's your name?"
"Cap?"
So Tony switched back to speakers, started ramping up the repulsors to combat-ready status, and stepped around the last of the obstacles, bringing Baron Mordo into view at last.
He opens the bottle, shoves a pill into his mouth, and starts chewing. Then he takes a second one.
Steve couldn't quite get the right words, somehow. There were no eloquent Captain America speeches for him. Not about this. "I'm not ashamed of you," he told Tony. "I'm not. I'm proud of you, and I'm proud to love you. In an ideal world, I'd want to tell everyone how lucky I am that you love me. But I know there are considerations. I'm okay with... not volunteering the information. If that's what you want. It feels like there's a difference between not telling and lying. To me, there is. I'm okay with not telling. But I don't want to lie. I don't want to pretend I'm single. I don't want to pretend I'm looking for someone new."
"Fine," Tony said, but he was still intently focused on... whoever he was looking for.
He doesn't need to know them. He doesn't even want to know them.
for Tony?
"Tony." Steve snorted. "I know you'd never. But if you were actually a murderer, if I seriously thought you were a murderer, I'd turn you in. I'd turn
"But that's not all I have for you tonight," he added.
"I think they will be," Tony told him, sleepily, and he'd drifted off. Steve could feel him smiling.
Steve just-- he just had to get over it.
"Hey," Tony said. "Hey, it's all right." He leaned over and patted Steve's hand, and Steve hated how much he craved that touch. He wasn't the one suffering here. "I know you've been worried since you saw it. Of course you were worried. I'm sorry I didn't tell you." He sighed again. "I really should have."
"Are the rest of the Avengers here?" Tony panted. "Your team? Who did you bring? Where the hell am I?"
Mr. Stark fixes his armor. Mr. Stark keeps him alive. So what does he have against his own bodyguard?
"Oh," Steve says. There's something more tentative in the way he looks at him now, something soft and hopeful that he swears he's never seen in Steve's eyes. "I... live with you? We live together?"
Tony prefers to think of himself as
"How the hell did you find me?" Tony asked. "The suit was disabled. I couldn't put out an active ping for assistance."
Steve glanced down at the pile of wrappings and tape on the closest bench and then glanced away again. He didn't want to use any of it, and he couldn't quite say why.
Wong answers the video call after an inordinately long number of seconds, rubbing his eyes. Tony can't bring himself to feel bad for waking him up.
Tony's laughter was delighted. "I think you'll find I gave you that."
"No," Steve said, a little confused, because wasn't that obvious? "No pressure. I love you. You've still got me. No matter what. Even if it turns out you could use a little more practice, I'm sticking around. You're worth it. Besides, I guarantee
Steve reaches out and catches Tony's hand in his. Tony's fingers have stilled now, but he squeezes Steve's hand with an unexpectedly fierce grip.
"Steve?" Tony croaked, in obvious disbelief. He sounded
"I don't think so." Tony looked contemplative. "This has gone on a lot longer than any of the other dream sequences. And you've said a lot of things that sound like the real you. Even some things I didn't know. But I can't be sure I'm not dreaming it all up. I can't
Steve's happier than he can remember ever being.
Tony raised his eyebrows as Steve carried him toward the closest set of stairs. "And then it's time for the striptease, right?"
"Me too." Tony was smiling back, but then the smile faltered. "I didn't, uh. I didn't tell Jan the whole truth." His voice was hesitant. "I know you know that, I mean, you were right here. But... I didn't. I don't-- I don't know what you wanted me to tell her. If that's. If it was okay."
," Steve said, aggrieved.
Picking up one of Steve's hands, Tony guides it to one of the metal pads on his hips. "These first."
"Right." Steve smiled. He was trying to put Tony at ease. God, he hoped it was working. "Tea it is. Is chamomile okay?" Chamomile was supposed to be calming, wasn't it? Tony could use that.
"--and I was wondering," she said, the words jumbling together in a rush, "if you think -- God, I'm sorry, Cap, there's no good way to ask this -- he might, uh, benefit from talking to Henry. If I should get in touch with him."
"I wanted to be precise," Tony says, his voice still careful. "These things matter. It's important to say the right words."
"Is everyone out of the building?" he asks.
He wasn't going to be like the others. He was going to be worthy of Tony's trust. And he wasn't ever going to take advantage of him.
All the apartments he'd rented for himself over the years had kicked him out when he'd fallen off the wagon, but when he'd gotten out of St. Vincent's he'd found himself another place before heading to California, just in case he needed it. Penthouse apartment, swanky views, all the usual amenities. And it seemed like he needed it these days, now that he unexpectedly no longer had the mansion. It was lonely without the Avengers around here, though. He'd never really liked to live alone. But it was what it was.
He looks like shit. He's in a hospital gown and barefoot. He's wobbling where he stands. There are electrodes nestled in his hair that don't seem to be attached to anything. He's still bruised up a little from the fight. Honestly, physically, he doesn't look that bad. He's not wasting away. But, nonetheless, he looks absolutely awful. His gaze is faraway, haunted. Steve knows that look. That's Tony staring death in the face.
"We did," Tony acknowledged, with a flash of a smile. "But he sure tried his best. I-- I didn't tell you about DreamVision."
Tony chuckled. "Never thought I'd hear a dirty joke come out of your mouth." From this close, Steve's entire world was Tony's delighted smile.
Momentarily tongue-tied, Steve shakes his head. "Just-- just looking," he manages to say.
"Zero," Steve said, confidently, though he was starting to blush, which was a little weird. "Because Thor loaned you his cape before the paramedics showed up. And it was, um. I thought it was very nice underwear."
Okay, that was just
Tony's staring back at him like he honestly didn't expect Steve to have that particular answer.
Mr. Stark turns the soldering iron off, sets it to the side, and looks up. "Hi, Captain." He smiles. "What can I do for you? Did you have a special request for the mansion's grocery list this week? I can pass it on to Jarvis if you want; I think he's putting in the order now. Or is it Avengers business? Do you need me to build you something? If you give me a few minutes to finish this repulsor control assembly, I'm all yours."
"Huh?"
"Is he--" Wanda began, and Steve realized he hadn't kept either of them updated on Tony's condition.
Ghost hits enter.
Iron Man had said his father was dead. So Tony's father is dead. If Steve had been the kind of fella who gave a damn about celebrity gossip, he'd probably have known that already. He didn't.
Carol was silent a long while. She was studying him, thoughtfully, one hand on her chin.
Steve scrubbed at his face with his hand, with the vague notion that he should at least try to keep himself as composed as he could until he was in his bedroom. Head down, eyes half-shut, he crossed the room to the main staircase. He started to climb the stairs.
Tony studies Steve's face for a long time, in silence. He can be quiet when he wants to be.
Well, that was a lot less experience than Steve had been envisioning.
"Because then I know she's not going to want to come say hello," Steve said. "It'll be fine."
Tony was significantly paler now, skin gone sallow, and his hand on Steve's shoulder was trembling. His eyes were wide, his mouth set into a thin, tense line. His hair was, incongruously, still a mess.
And now that he didn't have Tony, he really had nothing, again--
"Or you could do that, I guess," Tony concluded.
"I don't know," Tony said. He didn't seem to be in control of the words that were coming out of his mouth. "Come over here and propose to me yourself, you goddamn coward."
"You're lovely," Tony said, voice full of admiration, and the way his hand curved over Steve's cock as he said it suggested that he meant something very specific by that compliment. "Mmm. Nice and big. Just right."
"Okay," Steve says, nonplussed. "I guess I'll... go back to bed then."
Oh, shit. That's definitely not good. Tony actually can't walk.
The outrage probably shouldn't have made Steve feel better.
, Steve."
He definitely didn't understand what was going on.
Come to think of it, that was true of pretty much all of the fliers, even the ones who weren't as tough as Carol: most of them were more dangerous the farther away they were. He wouldn't have liked to have been on the other end of one of Tony's repulsor rays, but in hand-to-hand, with both of them armored and armed, that was a different story. Steve was almost positive that whatever Tony was building his suit out of now was still no match for vibranium and--
Steve took a few steps to the side and then back, practically pacing, still not looking at him. "Fine," Steve said, and Christ, but he was a terrible liar. "Fine. I just-- I had a favor to ask you, and it made more sense to ask in person. I probably should have called first. I'm sorry."
The endearment made something go fuzzy and bright inside Steve. He wanted Tony to call him that again. He wanted Tony to call him
want a hug?"
, Steve thought.
Steve took a deep breath, and he lay down next to Tony, stretching out beside him, farther down the bed, his head at Tony's side. His feet were hanging off the end of the mattress now, but his cock, still hard, was pressed very nicely against Tony's leg. He wasn't about to deny himself the additional stimulation.
, Tony thought, stupidly.
"We're allowed to talk about the guy who
Steve glanced away for a second and tapped something else out on his identicard. "Tigra's going to go on up to help Thor. They've got this. I'm going to stay right here at your side." He smiled a hesitant smile. Tears were starting to stain his cowl. "I'm not leaving, okay?"
That was a hell of a double-bind. If he told Tony he thought the world of him, Tony would have no way to know it wasn't a dream. Because apparently Steve would have told him that in a dream, too. There was nothing he could tell Tony that Tony would believe was real. Even the good things.
Iron Man. They haven't exactly talked about it, the two of them, but surely Iron Man's figured out just how much Steve likes kissing him, even if he's never commented on the... more obvious physical signs... of Steve's enjoyment. It shouldn't be a surprise that Steve's interested in more. But he doesn't know how much more Iron Man is interested in. And if the answer is
hanging out of them, and curses inwardly. He needs to be less stupid. So he doesn't get to come. So what? He can get over it.
"You can pilot an X-Wing alongside Luke Skywalker." Tiberius chuckled. "I know, I know, that's not the coolest Star Wars movie anymore. But if I just use the Force--"
Steve put his head in his hands. Grief washed over him, drowning out the short-lived relief. But he knew what he had to do. He had to keep going. He opened his eyes.
what he'll be," Tony snaps, because Tony knows he himself will probably be beaten and broken and he will deserve it. "I can handle him."
"Don't be like that," Tony said, and smacked him helpfully on the ass again just to make him gasp. "There are more good things in store.
Mr. Stark laughs, an amused little huff of air, as if he can't believe that Steve is so nervous about wanting to know something he obviously thinks is so inconsequential. "Is that all you want? Is that what all this fuss is about? Breathe, Cap." He smiles. "Sure. I mean, yeah, of course I can get you his measurements. What for? You looking to buy ol' Shellhead a nice sweater for Christmas?"
"You're not my real mom," Tony told him. He tried on a smirk, for good measure.
Steve glanced over and smiled at him again.
Tony's fingers moved to Steve's face, stroking the side that didn't feel quite so sticky with blood. "Okay. I can at least do something about a couple of those, while we wait for rescue."
"Oh yeah?"
." His voice was thick. "Need-- need you to touch me." He couldn't think with how much he wanted it. There wasn't room for anything else in him except this.
"He was the only man who ever loved me," Tony whispered, and it took everything in Steve not to react, to let none of his foolish, ill-fated heart show on his face.
All right, so Steve was jealous.
"Maybe," Steve admitted. "Doesn't mean I want to stop, though." He didn't want Tony to get the wrong idea. It had just been a little too much all at once. "I'm game for more."
"Well, ma'am," Steve said, and he could just feel himself smiling again, thinking about Tony, "it's amazing. Being with him is like nothing else I've ever known. I can't-- I can't really imagine my life without him in it."
He shut his eyes for half a second. He couldn't think about Tony. Not and hold together.
Of course he'd been there for Tony at the end. He'd do it again in a heartbeat. Mostly these days he just hoped that Tony wasn't going to die again.
"Shh," Tony said, stepping back and admiring Steve's bruised, reddened mouth. "I get to decide what you get, don't I? You'll get more."
He tapped Steve lightly on his other thigh, and then a little harder; he peppered the backs of his thighs with taps of the crop, as many as he could, going for speed rather than finesse. Steve was starting to look nicely pink, his skin heating up, although with the way Steve handled actual injuries, Tony was sure he was going to get maybe thirty seconds of that at most.
. And I
Steve flattens his hand against Iron Man's biceps appreciatively and grins. "All that muscle under the armor is real, huh? Nice."
That's another new word. One of the things he likes about Iron Man is that he's careful with his words, trying not to use too many words Steve doesn't know. He always tells Steve what they mean if he asks, and he never makes fun of him for not knowing.
, after all? You don't want to impose. You've never wanted to impose. So you don't even say it. You're doing fine. You're grateful for what you have. Nothing's really wrong, after all. It's not
a pervert, let me just say that the idea of chaining you up in vibranium is a turn-on in several different ways."
So Steve leaned back and, with a little squirming, peeled off his uniform pants. It was always a bit of an undignified ordeal, but Tony's gaze was transfixed. Tony looked like he'd be more than willing to pay to watch him undress, and, hell, that wasn't a fantasy Steve needed to have right now. In addition to it being more than a little embarrassing to, well, get off on Tony having money, no matter what Tony had said about everything being okay, his body definitely did not need the help. He palmed at his cock, through his underwear, and next to him Tony made a quiet, desperate noise.
Steve hadn't thought about it like that, but that was why Tony was the genius. And now that Tony had said it, he had to agree -- that would be amazing. "You really think that's possible?"
." He remembered Tony's rattling final breaths, the agonized sorrow on his face, the weight of Tony's body. Tony had died apologizing for crimes he'd been innocent of. It had been one of the most miserable days of Steve's life. "What good would turning you in have done? Was I supposed to take a stand for justice about murders you actually hadn't committed when you had so little time left to live?"
Steve half-wonders if Tony even knew that they're not on the right floor.
"You've watched the interview," Steve said. "I don't know how he's having it edited, but I'm positive he's going to make me look like an idiot on national television. Because the audience is going to believe him. But that's not the important part." He sighed. "He was the one who broke the first story about Whiplash, remember?"
Steve blinked. "I... don't know what you mean."
It's a terrible excuse. There is no excuse, really.
He wants to wince. He's saying it because he cares. He knows he is. It just... never comes out that way when he actually says it.
-- clears his throat, and starts talking.
No, that was creepy. "I-- I was just curious, that's all."
"Hey," Tony said, gently, pulling back, smiling, stroking his face again. "None of that. You smell great. Really nice. A lot like your uniform. Leather. Actual leather, not a fragrance. There's still some of that in your uniform, you know, the leather. You almost always smell like leather and Ivory soap. Clean and kind of gingery. I like it a lot."
None of this is what Steve wants to hear, but that's not the important part. The important part is keeping Tony on as much of an even keel as he can. Tony has to survive this. That's Steve's primary objective.
Steve sprawled back on the bed and tilted his neck back as he slid his thumb in the waistband of his briefs, pulling one side down over his hip. He was hard enough that the fabric wasn't hiding much of anything -- Tony could tell he was uncut -- but Tony did appreciate the allure of just a little bit of secrecy.
Tony just kept grinning at him -- a little weakly, but at least he was smiling. "Oh, absolutely," he said. "But mine are all Captain America, of course."
"No," Chen Lu said. He seemed to be a man of few words.
Oh, if only he knew.
," Steve said, softly, and Tony was sure it was meant to be an admonishment but the way his mouth twitched with laughter suggested that he really didn't mind as much as he was trying to pretend that he did.
"That was only the beginning," Tony continued, and, wow, that was a terrible sentence. "After that he started pulling from my memories. Making me relive a lot of the worst things that had ever happened to me. He took me back to when my parents died, and he made me
"Yes," Steve breathes. "Yes, yes, yes."
Tony was now sitting up, perched on the closer edge of the bed, next to where Steve had been sitting. His gaze went to Steve's hand, seeing the book, and he frowned. He didn't know what Steve was planning, then. Maybe that was bad, if he hadn't guessed; he needed to believe the theory of it for this to work.
The horror of it all was beginning to filter into Tony's mind. "That'll kill me."
Tony had already made his choice, and it was the closet. That overrode anything else Steve could want. There was no use wanting it. He couldn't have it. He shouldn't even think about it. He wasn't going to think about it.
The other power pack comes off, and the armor goes completely dark. Tony deftly removes the belt they were attached to, and then he raises his arms. Steve slides his fingers up the nearly invisible side-seam of the armor and finds two depressions, just below Tony's arms on either side.
Tony opened his mouth and then shut it again. He was silent for several seconds, deep in thought. He looked like he was a million miles away. "When we were at school," he said, slowly, like he was waking up from a dream, "Ty always wanted to compete with me. He always wanted to be the best. He always wanted to beat me. Not just in academics. Not just in sports. In everything. I'd flirt with a girl, and Ty would be on her other side trying to charm her away from me. Not because he actually even wanted her, I don't think. He just didn't want me to have her." He grimaced. "Christ, this is the worst kind of locker-room talk, isn't it? I'm sorry. You definitely don't want to hear this, I know. It was terrible behavior. I was young, and I was so, so stupid. I don't-- I don't do that anymore, I promise."
He knows why Tony's asking. He knows a lot of people wouldn't believe that, merely because of who Tony is -- because he's rich, famous, handsome, brilliant. A man like that must lack nothing. But Steve knows Tony -- or rather, he knows Iron Man, so he knows Tony.
, and somehow Tony hadn't thought of that but Tony isn't really thinking about anything right now except Steve's big, hard,
Mr. Stark, on the other hand, stops breathing entirely. This is fair. It's probably a surprise; Steve hasn't actually told him -- or anyone else in this century -- that he's queer too, even if the internet was all too happy to inform him about Mr. Stark's proclivities. After a few seconds Mr. Stark swallows hard, mustering what has to be a remarkable amount of courage, and he says, "It doesn't have to be a date. But if you wanted it to be one -- I'd be really happy to hear that."
Tony is-- well, the nicest word for it is that Tony is
Steve shuddered. "Well, there are none of those here," he said. "Building's well-maintained. I wouldn't live somewhere that wasn't. Not-- not anymore, anyway. Can't say as I used to have much of a choice." Steve didn't like them much either. He didn't think most people did.
Tony made a small surprised noise. Steve thought he'd probably picked that term up from Natasha too.
Steve grunted as he wedged the fingers of his free hand between the halves of a sliding door and started to force it open. "I also hate you being in mortal peril," he gritted out. "Guess which one wins."
"You can't talk about it. I get that. It's all right." Her smile was smaller now, barely tipping the corners of her mouth. "But you have to get everything out somehow, Cap. You can't just keep it all in. That road doesn't go anywhere good. Trust me." Her gaze was briefly far away; he had a good guess as to what she was thinking about. She was six months sober, after all.
At least it's not some kind of major emergency -- it's just a lot of minor ones with lousy timing. That's good. That's the only good thing about this.
"Yes, it's me," Steve said, and of course he could hear Tony whispering through the door. Super-soldier hearing. You had to love it. But Steve sounded oddly... guarded? Nervous? He was shifting from foot to foot, shoulders hunched, and that was definitely unusual. He looked like he wanted to hide behind his shield. dipping his head and shoulders to fit into the curve of it. "Can I come in?" he asked. His voice was somehow hesitant. "I'll only be a couple of minutes, I promise."
"I'm okay." The words sting at Steve's throat. "I'm just-- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I honestly thought you were going to-- I mean. You know. You know what I thought. I'm so sorry."
. I was shy. Quiet, even. Didn't have a lot of friends. I was always daydreaming. I liked robots. I liked books. Stories. King Arthur." He met Steve's gaze. "Captain America."
Iron Man has one hand braced on the doorframe, leaning on it for support. His eyes are glassy and bloodshot, his gaze not quite tracking right. The slivers of bare skin Steve can see around them, framed in the narrow windows of the eye-slits, don't look any better: his skin is alternately patchy with blood in some places and then far too pale in others.
. Steve had felt his face growing hot. It wasn't like he didn't know what Mr. Stark had meant. They'd had dirty pictures during the war, after all, and people were still people.
This was... well, this was unusual. Tony hoped
Steve's voice was choppy and stiff. He probably sounded humorless. Unemotional. Everything the world always thought Captain America was, like they didn't know there was a man under the cowl. Sometimes it seemed like there shouldn't be.
No. That's wrong. He wouldn't be a terrible father, not in the slightest. Isn't that obvious? It's obvious to Steve. He opens his mouth to tell Iron Man so, but Iron Man is still talking.
The Avenger with a crush on him... was
Steve turned to the strange device between them. He had to figure out how to get Tony out of this.
Mr. Stark winces; clearly he finally understands Steve's concern. He pauses. He licks his lips. "He wouldn't have died, you know," he says.
Steve nodded again, and Tony picked up the lighter of the two floggers.
"Okay," Steve echoed. "So, let me try this again from the beginning, okay? Here goes." He cleared his throat. "Would you like herbal tea, black tea, or coffee? And don't say coffee." It was a very gentle joke, because of course Tony was going to say coffee. He was
He'd been so wrong. Tony had been
It's what everyone else in this line wants; it shouldn't be a surprise. She hesitates for a fraction of a second before she passes the form over. Steve can imagine her deciding which of her friends to text with the news:
Iron Man sits next to him, and practically leans into him; metal presses against Steve's side. Objectively, it's not the most comfortable Steve has ever been -- but it's
Hope blossoming within him, Steve leans in. "Then... yes? Will you?"
When it turns out Osborn is after the SHRA database, when it turns out Tony's brain will just have to go, too bad so sad, he can't find it in himself to be scared.
And Tony's thoughts are clearly traveling along the same path, because his eyes fall shut and he frowns. "Rehab when I was learning to walk again, actually." But he opens his eyes again and his mouth tips up; he's pulling himself out of the spiral those thoughts often take him in, and it's actually working. "Didn't feel half as nice as this."
Tony could just barely see the shield glinting in the dark, and he could only see Steve if he switched to night vision. Steve could probably see him anyway.
"Hey," Steve says, gently, and Tony turns his head late, running on what feels like a seven-second broadcast delay. Tony's eyes are soft and dreamy again. Steve tosses him the underwear; he doesn't catch it. "You're going to want these first."
"Asshole," Tony said, cheerfully. Yeah, Tony was probably going to like this book.
Iron Man's fingers knot together, twisting up in anxiety. "I know I'm not anyone you really want," Iron Man says, hoarsely. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I can't be someone who actually makes you happy."
"We both know where the sore spots are, Tony," he said. "And the news doesn't even know about half of them. Yes, there were the Guardsmen at the Vault. But there was also the Kree Supreme Intelligence. Or that time six months ago when Mentallo attacked you and you wiped all our minds."
"So," Jan said, as they all stood in what once had been the mansion basement, looking all the way up to the hole that went through the roof. Sunshine streamed down, making dust motes dance. "Do you want the good news or the bad news?"
"Hey, Tony!" Steve called out, striding through the living room and into the kitchen. "I was just wondering if you--"
An indefinable sadness ripples over Mr. Stark's face, a storm front passing through his blue, blue eyes, and then disappears entirely. "He's downstairs in my workshop," Mr. Stark says, his voice much more brisk now. "I stayed here last night to make some modifications to his armor. Do you need to talk to him? Is it Avengers business?" He pushes his chair back like he means to stand up. "Just give me a few minutes and I can fetch him for you."
He represses a shudder.
But now that Steve knew, it made an awful kind of sense. Tony had clearly always assumed he was unwanted. Unloved. He didn't know how to think otherwise. He'd picked the answer that meant that Steve didn't really want him.
Steve just wasn't going to think about the metaphorical implications of that.
"Okay," Steve said, slowly, warily. "You're going to start with the part where he said he was sorry and he promised he wasn't ever going to do it again, right?" Steve hoped that was what Tiberius had started with. It was what Steve would have started with. He liked to think he wouldn't have done any of this in the first place, though.
He exuded confidence and poise. His hair and makeup was perfect, his suit was expensive, and he smiled at the camera like he'd spent his life doing it. He probably had.
People had often told Steve things like that, over the years. Most of them seemed to think it was part of being Captain America, as if the serum had bestowed on him the ability to be inspirational. Steve figured it had probably already been part of him. He didn't know how he did it, and he wouldn't have been able to explain it any more than Tony could explain how it was he could look at a blank blueprint and know how to invent something that would change the world. Steve just opened his mouth and told the truth, and people saw that within him.
Tony pokes a finger against Steve's bare forehead. "Not right now, there isn't. But fine. I love you so much that I'll let you be Party A. I am so nice to you."
"It loved me," Tony repeated. "It was pretty clear about that. And it, uh. It had some ideas about keeping me safe. It killed Whiplash the next time he tried to fight me. It followed me to a conversation I was having with Ru and forced me away from her. Then, eventually, it beat me up." He snorted. "Talk about an abusive boyfriend."
"Please," Tony gasps, and the word is cut off by a groan as Steve bites his nipple at the same time as he gets Tony's fly undone and, oh God,
He really should have told Steve. He really should tell Steve. When this was over, he'd tell Steve.
fantasies now, why don't you?" he murmured. Steve realized that Tony had thought about this too, had pictured this. Their desires reflected back on each other, endless mirrors.
He found his phone in his belt pouch and winced as he opened it. It was ten to noon, and there were six unread text messages, all from Jan, all probably expressing increasing amounts of concern. Considering that the last thing Jan had probably heard about him was that the police were being called on him at ViaStone HQ last night, Steve could understand where the concern had been coming from. He should have checked in, and in most circumstances he certainly would have, but last night had been very far from ordinary.
"Yeah," Tony said, stubbornly, "but that's exactly why I was supposed to have the damn safeguards. It was alive. It wasn't Ultron, either. Or Jocasta. It was... itself. The same way Jocasta isn't Jan. The same way Vision isn't Simon. As soon as I figured out what had happened, I tried to transfer the armor's consciousness into something that wasn't, you know, a heavily-armed suit of armor. I could see that that was going to be a bad idea. But it had already bonded to the armor. I couldn't move it without killing it. And then it deactivated Jocasta. And that was when I
It hadn't even occurred to him that they could do this. It probably should have. Of course Tiberius was keeping tabs on the coverage of Tony -- because, for whatever reason, this was the outcome that he wanted. He wanted to hurt Tony. Of course he'd be interested in Captain America coming onto his network to talk about Tony. And of course he'd want to confront Steve, here on his channel where he could say whatever he wanted, with the knowledge that his loyal subordinates could edit him to make him look even better.
Tony reached toward him with one trembling hand, and Steve knew what was coming now, no, no, no--
He had armor, he told himself. He could take a hit or two. It wasn't ideal, but that was what the armor was for, right? He was going to be fine. He was going to be--
Tony looked nowhere near as distressed about it as Steve felt. "Oh, probably. I don't remember that specific moment. He kept trying an awful lot," he said, as Steve stared at him, aghast. "What's the big deal? It's not the worst thing that's ever happened to me. And I stopped him, so it's not like he actually did it, either."
"Well, uh," Iron Man says, sheepish. "Other than your basic social handshakes and, uh, kissing you... a couple of years."
Steve takes a deep breath. "He's nice, but... I was hoping to talk about
Finally, Tony thinks, finally he's found happiness. Someone who will love him. Someone who will never leave. Steve wouldn't. Steve would never. When Steve says something, he means it.
. It's going to hurt you. And I want to spare you the pain."
With the chestplate on the floor, Steve straightens up to find Tony wobbling, stepping out of his boots. Tony takes an ungainly step forward and down, five inches shorter as Steve holds out an arm for Tony to brace himself if he needs to.
," Tony says, fervently, and Steve's hand tightens on Tony's hip, and Tony is pinned by so much of Steve, by his hands and his massive cock, and it's perfect.
So Steve tilted his head to the side, a suggestion of a nod. "I suppose I'd have to agree with that, yes."
Steve glanced over to see how Tony was taking this. Tony's face was almost gray, drained of all color.
"We really don't have to do anything," Steve said, going back to his original point. "I don't want to push you. I understand if that's not something you want, if it's too fast. I'd be fine with going to sleep. I just want you to know that there are... options."
Tony tries to make himself smile. "It's my building. This is where we live."
The penthouse suite was very much like what he would have expected from the richest man in America; he supposed that a decade of friendship with Tony had given him some idea of what it would look like. It was more divided than most of the suites Tony liked. There were definitely rooms, and this room was definitely one of the main living areas. Also, it was definitely empty. There was no sign of Tiberius. Or Tony.
And it wasn't going to be Steve.
Tony was checking his injury, Steve told himself. As a teammate. It didn't mean anything. And then Tony looked up and met Steve's gaze. The wordless question was obvious in his eyes:
It didn't have to be a joke anymore. That-- well, that opened up so many more possibilities.
Watching him in silence, Tony took a few wobbling steps backward and sat down hard in the middle of Steve's couch. At least Steve didn't have to worry about him falling over anymore.
Steve throws himself to the ground just in time, as one of the Enchantress' blasts of magic goes over his head.
. "Leave him alone!" Steve barked out. "And while you're at it, leave everyone else alone. This is your last warning. Surrender now, or you'll regret the consequences."
. The real thing. He should have known that there would be a difference.
Though maybe Tiberius had apologized later, in private...?
Steve's offering. For him, it's not even a question.
"Right," Steve says. "Okay. Thanks. Iron Man and I are going up."
"Yeah," Steve said, and he realized he was staring at the tantalizing shape of Tony's cock again, and he realized he didn't have to stop. He could be exactly as obvious and appreciative as he wanted. He remembered the glimpse he'd seen the other day of Tony's fancy underthings. What would Tony look like with his hard cock barely restrained by the slightest scraps of satin, peeking through translucent layers of lace? That-- wow, that was a nice thought. A rush of heat raced through him. "Just, uh. Admiring the view. Wondering how much more of that lacy underwear you had."
"Yeah?"
"So this question can't be any weirder than that one," Carol said, "but do you want me to keep an eye on him for you?" She knotted her fingers together. "I mean, I would anyway, but, you know. For you."
They'd headed back to the mansion after lunch, and the first person they'd told was Jan. She'd been thrilled for them, and also not really all that surprised. Since she was one of the few Avengers who knew Tiberius personally, she'd gotten the entire story. Including the part where Tony had been dating Tiberius. And she'd been shocked by the truth about Tiberius, just like Steve had been, but mostly she'd been happy. For them.
"How?" Steve asked, confused, anguished. That didn't make any sense. That shouldn't have been possible. "Tony, we all came back healed--"
Steve wiped one gloved hand through his hair and turned back to Tony.
"I'd like that," Steve tells him. "I'd really like that."
Tiberius was bending over the woman, walking around her, talking as he was finishing the setup. "What you're looking at is the future of entertainment. With DreamVision, you don't watch movies anymore -- you're starring in them!" He beamed. "All the fancy gadgets here will connect you to your ViaStone cable box, which will also deliver a very small injection of nanites. Cutting-edge technology. Don't worry, they're perfectly safe. This is only a prototype. The final delivery mechanism will be much more user-friendly." He turned, using his body to shield from the audience what definitely had to be an IV after all. "You'll feel a small pinch, miss."
"Part of me would very much like to say yes," Tony said, with another tired smile. "The rest of me knows I'll get a crick in my neck. But I think I'd like to stay here a little longer anyway."
And he had a problem to solve here: he had to figure out who the box really belonged to. Not everyone who resided in the mansion had been in the room when Thor had found the box, so if they hadn't been there, it was Tony's duty to figure out who they were. And if they had been there... well, then they hadn't come forward, and it was Tony's duty to return it to them anyway. He could be discreet. Subtle. It would be the kind thing to do. He could determine who really owned the box and then privately hand it back. No one else would have to know.
," Tony said, with a sincerity he thought he must have picked up from Steve himself, and Steve went even redder. "Don't ever change."
"I think I need to talk about it," Tony said, slowly, like he was trying to work it out as he was speaking. "I know it's selfish of me to want to share my pain but I think it'll hurt less." His smile was pained. "Because it really fucking hurts now."
Despite himself, Steve turns back. "Yes?"
"Off," Tony said, strangled. "Off! At least the sound. Off, Steve,
Relief broke out across Tony's face, as if that hadn't even occurred to him. Good. He was looking happier again. The breakup had been rough on Tony, Steve had gathered, but then, that was true for every woman Tony had dated, as far as Steve knew. Tony always fell hard. And it never worked out.
He thought he had a good guess. A couple of good guesses. "This is going to sound terrible," Steve said, "but I honestly don't know if you mean Kathy Dare or Madame Masque."
"You can put the helmet wherever you like," Steve told him, as he hung his coat up, then reached over and tugged off the fabric covering the shield. The apartment had unusually good soundproofing -- given Steve's day job, he'd made sure to find a place that did -- but he kept his voice pitched low anyway, for Tony's sake. He needed to be calm for Tony. "You can hang onto the shield if you want. If it's helping you. I don't mind." He tried a smile.
Steve jumps to his feet, and that's when an invisible force slams into him, a gut punch he couldn't have braced for. He doubles over and takes an uppercut on the chin. Ghost isn't stronger than him, but he doesn't have to be, not like this.
Tony swallows hard. "I'm going to need you to use a few more words there, Cap."
"Mmm," Steve said. "Glad you approve."
He looked like a statue, almost. Human perfection. An invitation to be defiled -- except the joy of it was that it wasn't, not when they both wanted it. Steve's back was a long sweep of skin, broken only by the straps of the harness, ending with the shine of the plug. Iron Man was already in him.
The box -- and the crop that had come out of it -- lay in the middle of Tony's bed. Tony picked the crop up by the handle and turned it over, considering; he gave the mattress next to him a few experimental lashes. It had been used for some time, he thought, to judge by the wear on the leather of the popper, but there wasn't too much else he could tell. He set it aside and turned to consider the box itself.
"I take it that's a yes," Tony said, with an amused smile. He was confident, again. He knew what he was doing. He knew how to make Steve feel good. This was the part, Steve was sure, where Tony would brag a little, would tell him how good he was at this, how good he was going to make Steve feel. "I've been told I'm--" Tony began to say, and then there was something cold and broken in his eyes. The smile was gone. "Well, I've been told I'm adequate at best, actually."
. And he was sure that he was getting Tony. The real Tony.
Tony blinked. "Pardon?"
"There's an A on my head," Steve points out.
He looked up, and Tony was staring back at him with an odd combination of bitterness, longing, and what looked like sheer terror.
"No," Tony said, but he sounded a little shaky. "No, it's good. It's just... a lot to think about."
For most people that would have been just a figure of speech. They both knew that Steve meant it very, very literally.
"Seriously, though," Steve says, because he doesn't want Tony to dodge this. "Please tell me if it hurts in the bad way. No toughing this one out. I just want you to feel good tonight, okay?"
Plus, Steve had made a good point, outside, about some stuff being more than
"You thought you'd bested me!" Flag Smasher declaimed, launching himself forward. "But you haven't seen the last of-- ugh!"
"Right," Steve said, and he wrapped an arm around Tony's lower back as he escorted him off the escalator landing. It was a move Steve probably would not have dared to make yesterday but which Tony was most definitely in favor of, even if he couldn't feel it. "This is our stop. Thor, you're one floor up. Keep your comms on."
"Why not?"
Steve's heart is pounding as he waits, and he waits, and about thirty seconds later he sees a gleam of red and gold inside the building, and then Iron Man flies back out the window, holding a boy in his arms. The kid looks like he's maybe eight or nine, and he's clutching Iron Man tight as Iron Man comes in for a landing.
"I really do," Steve told him. "I like it. I love you," he added, just to see Tony smile again. "Wonderful."
Even worse, they were actually
"Haven't seen Ty since Monday night," Tony said. "We were both busy yesterday, unfortunately. But we've got some plans for tonight. I might not, um." Tony paused delicately. And that smile, that was really something. "I might not make it back to the mansion."
Steve leaned forward. "Tony, no one could have predicted that. It was a freak accident."
. I kind of thought I made that clear."
Steve gave him another heartbreaking smile and pressed a damp kiss into Tony's palm. "I'd love it. You-- this-- this is everything I've ever wanted, all at once."
Steve rubs his fingertips over Tony's back in little circles as Tony shakes against him, and he has a much more specific idea. Whether Tony wants it -- well, that's the question. The only way he can find out the answer is if he asks Tony. So that's what he'll do.
cruel, saying them; he just sounds... sad? He's staring off into the middle distance, eyes unfocused, mouth tight with pain, like he thinks he's somehow in the middle of an entirely different conversation, a conversation that's much more distressing than this one should be.
He reaches out and runs his fingers through Tony's sweat-dampened curls, fitting his palm against the curve of Tony's skull. Tony presses his head against Steve's hand, then shudders and shakes, a full-body shiver sliding down his spine. Steve watches, pleased, as Tony trembles against the ropes, pushes, fights -- then relaxes into the embrace of the harness, smiling up at him again.
It was a miracle he hadn't concussed himself on the way down, really. But blood was still pouring out of him, and it looked like he was all out of miracles.
Then Tony's phone rings. Specifically, it's starting to play a tinny version of The Doors' "People Are Strange."
"You are," Steve said, softly.
This was how he felt for Tony.
Without knowing who the rest of them were or what they had done, Steve already knew how it had happened. Tony fell in love fast, and Tony fell in love hard. Tony was loyal, caring, kind, devoted, and deeply trusting. And it was so, so easy for someone with ill intentions to use all of that against him.
In another second, Steve had caught the stand as Tony sank back onto the bed. These were the nanites, Steve realized, the nanites for DreamVision -- but that didn't explain why Tony had them in an IV and Tiberius didn't. Clumsily, Tony fumbled the headset off his face -- thankfully with the hand that didn't have the IV in -- and then he seemed to figure out where he was and what he was -- or wasn't -- wearing. He looked down at himself and his gaze caught on his own chest, and then darted back up to Steve, clearly wary of his reaction.
won't make it out of here without breaking down again. Just trust me when I say I know how to reverse a negator, okay?"
, Tony tells himself, sternly.
Steve smiles sheepishly and replaces it with his other hand, and Tony squeezes most of the lube out onto Steve's bare palm, tossing the packet on the table in case Steve wants the rest later.
Tony was staring off into the distance. "I was nineteen when I met Sunset Bain," he said, lost in the memory. "It was my last year at MIT. We were at a regatta together, and we got to talking. She was a few years older than I was, and I was flattered by her attention. More than I should have been. I was so young, and I was so, so stupid." He laughed. "I didn't even figure out anything was wrong when she asked me not to tell my father we were seeing each other. I just thought it made sense. The first girl I ever fell in love with, Meredith McCall -- she was the daughter of one of my father's business rivals. He forbade me to see her. And I was worried he'd say the same thing about Sunset. He would have." Tony frowned; there was something else in Tony's eyes now, and it wasn't good at all. "I still don't think he was right about Meredith. He would have been absolutely right about Sunset." He still wasn't looking at Steve.
Tony's location resolved again. He was a little further south than he'd been, but still in the park. Life signs were holding steady. Tony was okay. His heart rate was a little elevated.
Thank God. "So at some point during this whole affair you... decided to get yourself a new heart?"
"Yeah?
Steve wondered what the hell he'd done wrong. He'd been so sure Tony had wanted him. And Tony has definitely seemed like he'd liked the kiss. But this couldn't be good.
Steve takes a steadying breath and hopes he doesn't sound too obviously like he's been doing... well, what he's been doing. He probably does. He opens an audio channel anyway. Video would not be a wise choice. His cock's still hanging out of his pants. There are still bruises on his neck from Tony's kisses, from earlier in the evening.
There was scattered applause; Tiberius basked in it for a few seconds, grinning a dazzlingly-white grin, and then held up his hand for silence.
It had been a rare family outing -- his father had taken him to Washington, to the Smithsonian, and he'd dragged Tony away from the National Air and Space Museum over to the National Museum of American History, a decision that Tony now assumes his father intensely regretted for the remaining sixteen years of his life.
Also, it seemed like Tony was definitely in favor of more. If he hadn't wanted to, Steve would absolutely have understood. And he definitely didn't want to push Tony. But he didn't want to assume he knew better than Tony did about what Tony was ready for. If Tony said yes, he wasn't going to say no.
He flips Tony so fast that for half a second Tony isn't sure which way is up, and his head spins like he's just pulled a loop at 3Gs. Tony breathes out, realizes Steve is above him, and figures that's as good a direction as any. He reaches out for him, his fingers catching on the back of Steve's remaining bracer.
Iron Man pauses and his head jerks up; he clearly wasn't expecting that response. "You're kidding."
recent. They couldn't have been done tonight, or even within the week; they weren't fresh enough for that. They were probably several weeks old. Whatever this was, whoever had done this, it hadn't been Tiberius.
she told me she'd rather have seen
"What?"
"Shellhead!"
He retreats to the hallway before he can do anything particularly ill-advised.
Steve bottoms out, his balls slapping Tony's ass. They both groan at the same time, and for an instant there's a glimmer of light in Steve's eyes that's all fire, that isn't
Iron Man's laugh is soft. "I'll try. You go to sleep, Winghead," Iron Man says, his voice fond. "I'll still be here when you wake up. I'm not going anywhere."
"You should go find him," Jan says. "I'm sorry, I don't mean to keep you. Of course you want to go check on him."
"Tony, I--"
God. Tony just came up with new ways to surprise him every day, new thoughtful gifts. And Steve was sure he'd have done it for anyone, too. He was just so generous. This was why Steve loved-- no, no, he shouldn't think that. He really shouldn't.
And Iron Man's not
"So, yeah," Tony concluded, as he slathered cream cheese on his newly-toasted bagel, "I'll have to take a raincheck on those dinner reservations if that's okay. Sorry, Cap." He didn't really sound all that regretful. His eyes were alight. It wasn't okay. Steve tried not to grit his teeth. "Ty invited me to a party tonight to celebrate his acquisition of ViaLine. ViaStone now, I suppose. He's the richest man in America. He's got a star-studded guest list. Everyone who's anyone will be there."
"I should have come back sooner," Stone told him.
Steve looked unfazed. Steve was, in fact, smiling at him. Steve had kissed him. Steve had really kissed him.
He can just barely make out Iron Man's smile in the shadow of the mouth-slit.
He was an Avenger, sure, but -- other than Tony and Jan -- most of the Avengers weren't born to this lifestyle, and he could tell that, under all the stage makeup, Tony was tired. Tony probably wanted to get home, wipe his face off, and... well, okay, Tony probably wanted to spend six more hours in the basement working on his armor but Steve was hoping he could at least talk him into some cuddling first.
He doesn't know much, but the scant details he does know -- disabling, life-threatening accident -- sure sound like they would lead to nights and nights of miserable dreams. Steve understands more than a little about that himself.
"Okay." Tony ran his hands through his hair and stood up. "Well, I'm going to need a bigger stick."
whose father ever hit him," Steve clarified, as carefully as he could. He was dizzy. His voice was too loud in his ears. He'd never told anyone. Not about this. Hell, Tony was one of the few people who even knew his father had had a drinking problem.
," he says, and there's no way Steve can come up with a counter to that. "That would be absolutely lovely. If-- if you're sure."
He had to say something. "It's not you, Tony. I swear it's not. It's them. You've done nothing wrong."
It was hard not to feel responsible. Tony knew Jan felt responsible, of course; this had all happened on her watch. But Tony felt more so. It had been his house. He was the engineer. He'd been responsible for the defense system. It never should have failed.
Luckily, he didn't have long to wait, because Tony was fast, and in no time at all, Tony was carefully rolling the condom over Steve's length, and even that touch of Tony's hand was amazing.
That meant it was definitely not okay.
Steve shuddered harder, and Tony leaned over and picked the harness up.
Steve puts the one last bottle of honey mustard away and looks up. He smiles and he's just so-- so
Oh, well. There was always tomorrow.
Settling into his seat, Tiberius smiled at the host. "I couldn't just stand back and let the Avengers misrepresent the situation here, of course." His voice was silky-smooth, and he smiled at the camera now. He was playing to the camera, to the unseen audience. Of course he was. And he knew exactly how to do it.
Tony's being absolutely clear. Steve would nod if he could.
Iron Man's voice is more than a little strangled. "You're making me blush again, Cap." His laugh sounds embarrassed. "You really thought I-- I mean, you thought Mr. Stark just molded those muscles into the metal?"
Iron Man had said that, too. But surely it's understandable if Steve's worried about his--- about his
It was kind of poetic, when he considered it. Iron Man had come into the world when a fistful of shrapnel had landed in his chest a decade ago, and he was going to go out of it when some two-bit villain decided to rip the RT node out of his chest and destroy all his higher brain function.
The third bolt hit low and lateral, under his guard, striping sideways just under his waist, and it passed through his armor as if it wasn't even there. Literally. The beam of light just phased right through solid metal, like it was nothing. Like magic, because it
How could his dreams finally be coming true? Was this Tony's lucky day? He didn't have those. There had to be a mistake. He didn't deserve this. Maybe Steve didn't mean it the way it sounded.
Then Tony folded his hand into a fist, thumb and index finger extended, held an inch apart.
Steve doesn't realize what Ghost's plan is until they slide
He thinks Tony's probably always been just like this, though. He's remarkably consistent. It's one of the things Steve loves about him.
The screen dimmed. "The possibilities," Tiberius said, "are endless. And with DreamVision, ViaStone is ready to deliver them all, straight to you." He smiled again, stepped back. "Thank you for your time."
The commands weren't there.
"Thanks so much, Shellhead. I have to run, but I'm clearing you both for the mission now." A keyboard clatters in the background. "There you go. You're both on the board. All the information should be on your cards. Good luck."
, Tony," he said, softly, his voice brimming with a wretched sadness. He looked like he might cry. "Please don't do this to me."
, he thinks, and he almost starts laughing.
Steve stretches out on his bed, with Tony and Stephen on either side of him. His gaze slides between the two of them. He's nervous, Tony knows, but he'll never say, and this version of him doesn't know Tony knows all his tells perfectly.
?" he breathed, sotto voce. "I'm sorry, Cap, can you put the volume up a second on that TV? I just-- I have no idea what's going on here." There was a mix of confusion and something that might have been anger in his narrowed eyes.
There was an obvious problem with this entire bizarre plan, and Fury hadn't mentioned it, so Tony supposed that meant he had to. "Steve's not even
"Looks good to me," Tony said, and, God, it really did. "I can work with all that. I can
, after all -- as Iron Man stands on the sidewalk outside the mansion and opens the back door of what looks an awful lot like one of Mr. Stark's chauffeured cars, dark and professional and elegant. Iron Man hasn't even told him where they're going or what film they're seeing, but they're clearly getting there in style. Iron Man's grip on the door is dextrous, delicate, even with the gauntlets on; Steve wonders if, like him, Iron Man can dent ordinary metal if he isn't careful.
"No, you won't," Tony said. "You won't tell the cops. Because then I'll tell them it was self-defense. Which it actually was. Either that or it was a problem caused by your own misconfiguration of your own technology. Which it also was. I have a lot of options, Ty. You have none."
Tony's sobs seemed to have slowed. Thank God. "You know," Tony said, and he almost sounded like himself again, "I wasn't actually expecting you to have an answer for that."
Jan squinted at him. "So tell him."
Steve nods. "I don't mean to pry, Shellhead, but I know you work two jobs."
"It's going to be okay," Steve told him. He tried to think of what he could offer that would make Tony feel safe. Tony liked answers that appealed to his sense of reason. "I know it's awful right now, but it's going to get better. You're here with me. You're safe. I'm safe. This apartment is safe. If there were an emergency, the Avengers or SHIELD could be here in minutes; they both know where I live. No one who might want to harm you even knows you're here. And if anyone tried to harm you, they'd have to do it over my dead body."
Steve smiled back and obligingly pushed himself up again, waiting; Tony decided to reward him by playing with the plug, watching the slow, filthy slide of slick metal into Steve's ass.
, he doesn't say. But he wants to.
"You don't seem like you're enjoying being a vampire," Tony says. "I don't think I would, either." He sighs. "I know you're offering me... a sure thing. I get it. I appreciate it more than I could ever tell you, believe me. But I think-- I think I'd rather take my chances as a human. They say I've got a chance. And that's what I want. Even if I get centuries, I don't want to hide in the dark. I never have."
Steve sat down anyway.
"No, please," Steve said, and he found that some part of him actually meant it. "Keep smiling. And feel free to tell me exactly how happy you are. At least one of us gets to be."
Steve can feel his face go hot. He can't stop looking at Tony, in his shining armor, in Steve's very own bed. It's deeply satisfying in a way that Steve isn't sure there are words for, seeing Tony here, like this. "I mean," Steve adds, "this wasn't really how I imagined getting you into my bed, but I'll take it."
With that, Tony swung one leg over Steve, settling into his lap, and oh
"I don't even know how this works," he concludes, helpless, embarrassed, frustrated. "Do I get him a ring that goes outside the armor? Do I get him a ring that goes on his actual finger? Do I get him a ring at all? I-- I don't know how a man proposes to another man. I don't know how to do any of this. I just know that I want to."
Tony was in his bed. Tony was still asleep. Tony had, in fact, hardly moved since he'd fallen asleep; his head was still pillowed on Steve's shoulder, his arm flung possessively over Steve's chest. Steve wasn't surprised to find out that Tony liked cuddling even in his sleep. Tony looked so peaceful in his sleep, unworried, all his cares melted away. The bright sunlight -- God, it was probably almost noon -- peeked through the edges of Steve's curtains, painting Tony in golden light. He was beautiful.
Steve wasn't particularly concerned about legality at the moment.
"I want you to fucking
Two: Google has utterly failed him. All the search results for
That's not encouraging.
Words crowd Steve's mouth, too many for him to say any of them, and he can feel his palms start to sweat. It was too much. Steve came on too strong. That has to be what's gone wrong here.
"You asked me to kiss you," Steve confessed. "It was what you wanted. I know. And I-- I didn't make it in time. And I wasn't about to kiss you while you were passed out. So I spent the whole ambulance ride, the whole time you were in surgery, all the days you were on a ventilator, all of it -- I couldn't stop wondering if I'd missed my chance. If you were really going to die, and I'd failed you and I-- I hadn't given you the one thing you'd wanted, and I'd never even kissed you, and now I was never going to be able to--"
"Okay," Tony echoes. He sounds breathy. Uncertain. But they have to do this anyway, and they don't really have the time to spare.
Maybe, Tony tells himself, this will be enough.
Carol grinned back. "Hey, there you are. Do you want this to be a team lift or are you okay with just me?"
But Tony was alive. That was what mattered. Tony had survived.
. "I know you've never even told me if you liked men, but I-- I've always thought maybe you at least liked
"Yeah?"
He wonders if it should be frightening, to want this-- this
He honestly just wanted to stay in bed with Tony all day.
, Tony once asked him, sobbing, in the middle of a particularly hellish drop,
He had the door half open, and he was on the other side of the room taking down the flag that hung on the wall when someone knocked.
And Tony -- enraptured, entranced -- had stared up at the Captain America exhibit, at the larger-than-life figure staring boldly off into the distance. And then he'd started coughing.
"It's okay," Tony says, softly. He's almost accepted it now. The words scrape against his raw throat. "I don't have a lot of time left. I know."
What the hell else should he have said? He didn't want Tony to get hurt. He didn't want to impose his will on Tony. He wasn't going to be another Tiberius. "Tony, of course I--"
"I don't think I've ever told you this," Tony says. "I don't think I've ever told
That was the first miscalculation.
It's their anniversary. They've been dating for a year. They deserve this, don't they? God knows Steve has a terrible time admitting when he needs something, but even if he can't quite bring himself to say that
"Excuse me?" Tony asked.
He can feel his face heat up. He doesn't think he's ever asked Steve for anything like this before, though it isn't like he hasn't wanted to; Steve can't possibly have missed how much Tony likes the look of him in uniform. He just felt too ashamed to ever ask for it, like it would have been objectifying Steve, like Steve would have thought he only liked him for the way he filled out his outfit.
"Hi, Karl," Tony drawled.
No, Steve didn't know. "Where?"
They were supposed to be happy. This was supposed to be a good night.
, the tips of his fangs scrape the inside of his bottom lip raw. He hates it.
He knew Tony wasn't saying that because he actually thought Steve might do it. He was just... scared. He was scared as hell. He'd definitely earned the right to be.
given Tiberius up. He was going down, and that didn't even count the murders that Tony knew about. He was definitely going down.
wouldn't do that," Steve said, finally, voicing his conclusion at last. "You wouldn't, Tony. Because you know it's not right. So it's not right for him to do that to you."
Tony's laugh was mostly air. "Gosh, I can't imagine who in my life might have provided me with a rough cut of your planned television appearance, can you?" His smile wasn't at all pleasant, a cold sneer. Steve thought perhaps he'd last seen it on Tiberius' face. "Maybe if you think very, very hard, the answer will occur to you." Every word was precisely articulated. "Though if you'd been thinking, really, would any of this have happened?"
"I love you," Steve says. He smiles. "Thought maybe I should keep telling you that."
"I love you," Steve repeated, smiling, as a wave of tender fondness swelled up inside him. Tony's eyes went half-lidded, and he shivered against Steve's fingertips in a way that looked much more pleasant now. Yeah, Tony definitely liked that part.
It would be okay. He could go downstairs and fix himself some breakfast. He'd feel better. It was late enough that everyone else was probably already gone. He liked the thought of that. He didn't want to face anyone else right now. He didn't want to explain what he'd done to himself. He was going to have to deal with other people eventually, he was sure, but for right now he could just be alone. Good.
"I don't know why you think that the fact that you have a secret identity should be... a dealbreaker," Steve says, after some consideration. He needs to say this right. "Heck, Shellhead,
Steve's skidding across the linoleum, arms outstretched, and his fingers just barely brush the case of the drive when something
Iron Man's voice crackles. "Flatterer."
, and Steve would know. His skin shines in the soft light, with just enough oil rubbed into him to make him gleam even brighter. He's built sturdy; as odd as it is given the other one of Tony's day jobs, he's got the muscles of someone who works with his body for a living. The towel that's on his ass is pushed back just enough to be tantalizing.
"I asked the internet," Steve continues, and God, God, he's babbling, he doesn't even know what he's saying anymore. "They say the internet knows everything, so I asked it, I typed it right in, I asked it,
me. You know that."
Steve was going to find out his identity anyway, when they came for his body.
, right there. That was what Tiberius should have done. He hadn't. And Steve couldn't believe Tony was defending what Tiberius had done -- to him! -- as if Tony seriously thought it was acceptable behavior.
Then Tony stumbled and lost the rhythm entirely, misinterpreting the praise, trying to take him deeper. Tony's eyes were squeezed shut and his head dipped lower, taking in another inch or two of Steve's cock. Steve shuddered and tried to keep his wits about him, because, God, Tony's mouth was like heaven, but Steve was well aware that deep-throating him was not for beginners. This wasn't going to turn out well. He could feel Tony's mouth tense a little, Tony's tongue and throat tightening around the head of his cock, which felt, oh God,
"Is it that unbelievable that I might want to look at you?" Steve knows he's still blushing, but he manages to ask the question anyway. Surely Tony's well aware that people find him attractive. Surely it can't be that strange that Steve, who loves him, is one of them.
Baseball. Baseball was definitely safer. Or maybe that was sailing. Either way, it was definitely safer.
Tiberius stepped forward, his gaze roving over the front row of onlookers. "If I could kindly have a volunteer from the audience?" He leaned down and beckoned at someone Steve couldn't see from this far back. "Yes, you. Thank you, miss. Now just make your way up here, if you please, and have a seat in this chair--"
"I don't think I can sleep right now," Tony confessed. "I know I need to, God, I need to, but it's-- it's terrifying." The statement was bare, unadorned.
It can't be his heart. Iron Man said that was an injury. An accident. That wouldn't be something that could affect a child of his.
The optimism was nice. Untrue, but nice.
He was still bleeding. His vision was blurry. Oh. Those were tears.
Spinning around in his chair, Steve turned and saw Tony. And Tony looked like death warmed over.
Steve doesn't know who could be so unkind to Iron Man. He turns his hand over and squeezes Iron Man's hand right back. "I love you," he says. "And I'm staying with you for as long as you want me. It doesn't matter to me what you can or can't do. That's not what this is about, Shellhead." He knows his body is doing his best to make that sentence into a lie. He sighs. "It just... doesn't take all that much to get me all worked-up, these days." Another thing the serum has given him. "But that doesn't mean I have to do something about it."
They left Tigra on the seventh floor, and then Tony, Steve, and Thor headed up one last creaky, frozen escalator to what was presumably the site of their impending battle.
"Of course," Steve said. "And I'd like to extend my condolences to the families of all those who perished in the explosion." That included Chen Lu's family, but Steve already knew if he stressed that point Walders would eat him alive, and he needed to be defending Tony. "I wish I could say that an event like this is an isolated tragedy, but we all know that I can't. Even one death is too many, but it's thanks to Iron Man's quick thinking that the conflict was relocated from Midtown to a much less populated area of the city. Without his intervention, we would almost certainly have been looking at a much greater catastrophe right now, if Radioactive Man's explosion had instead happened in front of the Stone building."
Steve pulled his cowl up, slung his shield on his back, and grabbed the keys to his bike from the top of the dresser.
was what they were going with?
. You have no idea how much I want to."
Tony's tongue swiped out over his flushed lips. "I'm
Christ, was this what Tiberius had done to Tony? Had he really made him believe all these lies?
Tony looked down at the page again, then nodded. "I can see the individual letters, the shapes of them. I can focus on the words, and I can understand the sentence. I'm processing it. It-- it looks real to me. I'm reading. I don't think Ty could have faked this." He was smiling now, broadly, in relief. "Thank you. This is real. I'm not dreaming this."
Iron Man sounds honestly curious, like he can't imagine how Steve arrived at this conclusion, when it seems so obvious to Steve.
"Mmm," Walders said. The noise sounded oddly like a dismissal. "And what would you say about the possibility that Iron Man himself -- perhaps acting on Mr. Stark's orders -- was responsible for the explosion?"
There wasn't any point in trying to untangle Tony from him, so Steve pulled Tony down to the couch next to him. Tony's face was still pressed against his shoulder. Tony's chest was heaving against Steve's side.
"Oh, Tony, Tony, Tony," he breathed, and he thought he'd never tire of saying Tony's name. "Like that, just right, so good, love you so much."
Oh, God. Steve didn't know what Tiberius had shown him in DreamVision, but it must have been awful. He knew Tony's nightmares were bad enough on their own. He certainly didn't need any additional help.
So they're going to get through this the way they've always gotten through this. They're going to untangle themselves. Each other.
"I'm afraid if I say it you'll just disappear," Tony admits, eyes downcast. "Like some kind of terrible fairytale. If I say what I want, I don't get it. It won't be real. I know it's irrational."
And Steve's head is still in Iron Man's lap. Neither of them moved all night, it seems. And despite Iron Man saying he'd wake Steve up, he's definitely asleep now, sitting upright. His head is tipped back against the couch cushions, and Steve can hear his slow, even breaths. One of his hands is curled over Steve's shoulder. It's not possessiveness, exactly. He's not holding Steve  like he thinks he owns him. He's holding Steve like a child might clutch a beloved blanket or toy, like Steve can keep him safe from whatever nightmares live inside his head.
Tony smiled. "Same for me," he said. "About everything. Including the current amount of wanting." Steve thought that was quite possibly the most wonderful thing he'd ever heard. But Tony's smile was slowly fading. "I just-- I keep finding it hard to believe, you know? Not in the
Steve's praise is sunshine, ambrosia, the best liquor Tony's ever tasted. If he could, he'd bottle it to keep. He almost can, now; another memory, accessed whenever he wants.
Ordinarily, he'd be up for it. He couldn't say why he wasn't.
Steve imagined this mystery woman pouring Tony a drink. Was that how it had worked? "So you told her you were sober and she-- what, she handed you a drink?"
Steve realized he was licking his lips. "Can-- can I...?"
Tony's hands go to his waist, and he undoes his belt and then the fly of his pants before pulling out his soft cock. With one hand he grabs Steve by the hair and gently tugs him closer; with his other hand he presses his fingers past Steve's lips, opens his mouth for him, and eases his dick in like he's feeding it to him.
look at anyone the way Tony was looking at him now.
"Would I
Jesus, no wonder Tony hadn't wanted to swallow. He probably hadn't even tried to tell Tiberius that. He'd probably just... let him do whatever he'd wanted. Because he'd just wanted to make him happy.
