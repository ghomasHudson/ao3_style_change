“Tony, stop fucking pushing -- Tony!” Bucky says, almost angry as he looks him over, “Are you even in the right space to be doing that?”
Bucky turns an unimpressed look to him, “You think I mean me? Tony, if you get hurt on account of him, he’s not going to forgive himself.”
“You can’t let me do that.” Steve finishes, quiet and broken, “I can’t go through that, do you understand? It’s not something I’m capable of moving past.”
“You like that, huh?” Steven catches the glint in his eyes, a small smile lifting the corners of his lips. The sight is relieving, the sun breaking through dark clouds, and Anthony can’t help but return the smile. Steven’s thumb comes up to touch the curve of it.
Steven counts down silently: one, two, three. They both slam against the door, and it breaks off easy. They pour into the room, Steven raising his shield to the edge of his helmet. Bucky’s crossbow is drawn and nocked.
“Yeah, and how many times have you used it against me?” Steve yells, sudden and loud, “What happened to the armour at your place? I came to, and you were in the corner, bleeding from your nose!”
“But you were in the line of – are you hurt?” Anthony’s hands shake over Steven’s armour, trying to find a sign of blood or rupture.
“Extremis is only really a virus in title. It’s more similar to the super-serum, though Tony’s managed to alter it enough that it’s distinctly technological in its enhancement of the human body.” Mr. Stark explains, that little furrow sticking out, “And it’s one thing to survive the implementation of the super-serum, quite another to survive the consequences of purging it.”
Steve’s fingers had still been curled inwards from strangling, the remnants of the brute force he’d enacted on the creature still coursing through him. Energy: pure hatred. Tony’s eyes hadn’t missed it. Steve would come to learn that Tony’s eyes didn’t miss much of anything.
As they leave, Steve tilts Tony’s head upwards, watching his eyes. After a few moments, Tony blinks and his brown eyed gaze meets Steve’s.
Steve shakes his head, the motion jarring them, and Tony rocks back before Steve pulls him in with hands on his waist, “Too tired to argue about that right now.”
“I told you it would be too loud.” Steve stand back and surveys the pit for a moment, “Why don’t you...go in the pit and flatten the clumps?”
The interior of the military tent is a mess, broken figures and wood, everything dented with the familiar markings of the shield. Only the map, information collected and rendered over many months, remains untouched. Steven sits in the corner, by the remains of a broken stool, head clutched in his hands. His shield lies plainly by his side.
“Well, Anthony’s certainly fucked his wit into you.” Gregory retorts. He imperiously flicks his hair away from his face.
He knows Steven isn’t as composed as he appears, had seen it this morning when he’d sank down on Steven’s cock, the dull grey of the morning bringing the Alpha’s drawn gaze into sharp relief.
He’s practically shaking, Tony is, as he continues riding Steve, going deeper and deeper till he’s practically abusing his hole over Steve’s cock, ragged enough that it chafes even Steve. His hand stays over his mouth, suffocating sound, and Tony’s eyes are fixed on Steve’s, watching.
He counts in his head, eyes stuck to her. His mind feels slow. It still throbs, somewhere on his head he can’t quite pinpoint. But he continues counting, continues watching her. When he reaches thirty, he stands up.
When he reaches the clock tower, everything goes quiet. The room muffles noise. It’s a spacious, bare space with curtains drawn tight. It’s an illusion of night, a room crafted for the very being of darkness that inhabits it.
“We failed, Steve.” Tony cuts in, “Months of research! Months of working with the brightest minds, all those favours to get consultations from scientists and doctors and researchers, and all of that testing. All of that work, and it all – all of it went to shit.”
Anthony sinks down again, letting his eyes fall shut as he tries to suck pleasure into Steven. He keeps the thrusts steady for a minute, moving like a metronome, letting Steven get accustomed to the push-and-pull of sweetness. It tugs at something in Anthony too, a heat seeping into his core, bright and dawning.
He pulls back after a moment, finger coming to touch the dried yellow paint on Anthony’s cheeks, two long lines of dull colour.
He reaches forward and places his hands on Steve’s cheeks. Steve stills under him, and his eyes meet Tony’s, searching.
“Yeah, I do. I mean it’s still gonna be an issue to deal with, tomorrow, or in the future, but --” Tony swallows, “Thank you.”
“Uh, hi, Mr. Stark.” Steve says, and then starts forward when he sees Tony’s asleep. He walks over, as if entranced, finding himself standing at Tony’s bedside, opposite Mr. Stark. His hands close around Tony’s wrist, checking his heartbeat even as his eyes scour over his face. He’s less pale now but his hair is flattened from dried sweat. Steve wishes he would open his eyes.
“I got really scared today.” Steve continues, “Yesterday, whatever. It was – a lot. I don’t think I’ve ever been that scared.”
“No.” Bucky says, after a moment, hand leaving his nose to reveal a bloody but intact nose. “You have a hard fucking head, though.”
“I came here to comfort you.” Anthony says, after a while. Steven hadn’t told him to leave. He’d known the omega wouldn’t leave, and if he were being honest, he hadn’t wanted him to leave.
.” Steven says, leaning down to capture Anthony’s lips in a kiss. He presses Anthony into the furs as he does so, but again, curiously, there’s no force behind the action.
Anthony follows Steven, instinct turning his body towards the Alpha even as the scent of rotting anger lingers in his wake. A strong hand pulls him back before he can move however, and Anthony turns to see Bucky, wary-eyed and bleeding from a split lip.
The soldiers join in, mocking and crude, and Anthony huffs at how Gregory’s ears turn red, noticeable even in the distance, a tell-tale sign for his mortification.
“Yes.” Anthony replies, testing the soreness of his lower back with a minute flex. It should be good enough for – well, good enough for his Alpha.
Anthony flips the catapult using the metal chain, rearranging the angle. Happy and Gary quickly place the large bolted arrow on the catapult, Shuri drags it forward and clicks it into place.
“But given the unknown composition of the virus, it’s...difficult to say what his new normal looks like.” Mr. Stark offers.
Steven isn’t surprised to see Anthony enter the tent. He had told Bucky to warn him to rest in Natasha’s tent tonight. But Anthony has proven himself to be someone who doesn’t take anything at face value, seeks out the very thing that seasoned warriors would turn around at.
“Sure.” Bucky concedes, tilting his head. “But you need to be more comfortable with aggression, regardless. You hesitate to use your hands, to attack directly, and you’re still using your feet too much.”
“They’ll be concentrated in the hall, only castle guards across the parapet. It’s the best time to strike.” Natasha says.
“Only partly. It’s not your duty to fix this. It’s the team’s, and if this is a failure,” Steve leans forward when Tony looks away, “Tony, hey, look at me, if this is a failure, then it’s ours to bear. Not just yours.”
the kind of offering one gives a god?” Tony mumbles into Steve’s hand as it rubs over the man’s face.
“He got your shoulder good.” Anthony points out, eyes on Steven’s shoulder as he pokes the needle in.
“Wow,” Tony rests his chin on Steve’s knee, his arms hugging his thigh, “Good thing grave-digging isn’t part of the Avengers’ job description.”
The odd pair, Korg and Miek, had decided to stay with the pack for a few days. The third man had left quietly, when they’d stopped for water. The woman had given Anthony a folded paper and muttered something that had made him smile before also disappearing into the trees.
Anthony laughs, a pained sound that Steven can taste the tightness of. He croons a quiet tune into Anthony’s ear, waits until the omega settles into his touch.
“Doesn’t suit me?” Steve’s hands tighten on Tony’s hands for a moment, before unclenching entirely, “You think that’s what it is? Not maybe the fact that your safety is compromised anytime you step into a room with me when I’m like – like that?”
“I’d better win the best boyfriend of the year award for this,” Steve says, scooping up discarded clumps of grass around the pit with his shield.
The Alpha in question looks the very picture of a warrior, like something out of the fairytales Jarvis would tell. His hair is dirtied with mud, and his shield hangs on his arm, as casual as an explosive. His gaze, where it rises to meet Schmidt’s, is defiant and burning.
“Uh, yeah, we’ll deal with that later. Also, that isn’t your blood on your face, is it? Whose is it?”
“Anthony, would you feed America?” Steven asks, distractedly, thoughts already on how much of their recent battle he should include. Samuel is good about screening what to tell the pack, but the letter could always be spread. Probably best to be conservative on details.
Steven shivers, a violent ripple that moves across his body, ends with him moving back to meet Anthony’s gaze.
“You and everyone, I suppose.” Anthony says, gnawing his lip, “With the exception of Gregory, apparently.”
Natasha looks up from where she’s easing Clint down on a rock. The archer is swearing loudly, bleeding from a jagged, brutal wound on his leg. She and Bucky exchange a quick flurry of looks, and she turns and walks to speak to the soldiers.
Anthony’s movements seem more svelte in the night, shadows from the amber lamp flitting across the walls, dancing over Anthony’s body.
“I meant your body. It’s sweaty.” Steve clarifies, the words dampened by how his hands are still resting proprietorially on Tony’s waist.
“He’s not yours.” Steven interjects, stalking forward and leaning down close enough that he can feel the smirking man’s putrid breath on his jaw.
He then leans up and kisses Steve, open-mouthed and deep. Steve inhales in surprise before his hands come to Tony’s back, returning the kiss. Tony smiles as Steve’s kisses grow bolder, stronger. Steve pinches his waist in retaliation and sits up, the motion pulling them apart.
“It’s not acceptable. This was supposed to help him.” Tony says, quiet. “I promised him this would work.”
Steven faces his omega, noting how his eyes skip over Steven’s bare chest before flickering back to his face. There is interest there, at least physical. But Steven isn’t naive enough to assume that amounts to much, in the imbalanced context of their bonding.
Steven and Bucky fought each other like gods, flashing moments with shields, longswords and daggers that made for a gritty, fluid dance. They shook off hits with shrugs, struck with sounds that rang in the air, grinned and laughed with smiles almost feral in the moonlight.
“Don’t lie.” Steve is slipping; can feel the intimate caress of rage. He needs to get it under control, can’t go reeling under its touch.
Now, he moves, almost in time with it, dagger slashing. She doesn’t use her sword, and Anthony waits for her to strike out, but it seems forgotten, complacently gripped.
“Yeah, I guess I would.” He responds mildly. Pointedly, he flips his hand in a neat move that intertwines his fingers with Tony’s. Mr. Stark’s -- Howard’s eyes flick over the gesture.
He’s falling until he isn’t. Tony falls with him, blue eyes burning. Time slows and they’re not so much falling as they are floating.
The night before, he’d sat in the pit hoping for inspiration to join him, or at least for an idea that would make the pit seem like a part of the process instead of just the glaring error it actually was. Early in the morning now, 4:36AM, all he’s figured out is that it’s hard to be hopeful when sitting in a big hole in the ground. It’s fine, he reasons, his prerogative has always been actualising the future, not dissecting the past.
Schmidt reels back, and Clint laughs even as the hand behind his back gestures for Anthony to settle.
His soldiers cheer behind him, a sick happiness flowing out at the death of a long-standing tyrant. Normally, Steven would condemn such a display, but he can’t quite overcome his own perverse satisfaction. Bucky notes this, and ever-reliable, whistles at the soldiers. The sound cuts off and the noise of soldiers dispersing starts up.
“Captain!” Schmidt booms out loud, “You said you wanted Hydra. No more false faces. You’re looking right at him.”
“Hmm,” Schmidt says, “I always did wonder who the Captain would choose. Who would be worthy of him. I can’t say you impress me.”
Schmidt stands on the barbican, half of his body set on fire. His face is melting, burning into nothingness.
“So you’re saying, we’ll do it together?” Tony says softly, a quiet smile of amusement. He looks beautiful in that moment, bright and vibrant and so full of life that Steve can’t help but lean forward and kiss him.
They clash again. Anthony gets the sense she’s playing with him, toying with her prey. But he continues, relentless, hoping to tire her out, nick her enough times that it brings her down. He keeps the rhythm shifting, dances forward and leaps back in intervals. There’s a song in his head, drifting through in moments, one sang in the camp in the eve of their bonding.
“My – the stitches.” Steven’s voice is marked with slight hesitation, “You said you wanted to pull them out, when the time came.”
“Now, I don’t think a siege on the eastern Hydra base will work. They’re a complete fortress, have spent years building walls, are well-equipped to handle any siege.”
Steven and Bucky make their way to the castle, slinking through the bushes, keeping to the shadows. They stop at the edge of the moat, watching the guards in the parapet. They’re jovial, drinking out of flasks, gazes turned to each other instead of outwards. They’ve grown accustomed to peace, are lax with arrogance.
They eat for a while, Steve bringing over the burger he’d dropped and finishing it. Tony grimaces at Steve when he follows a bite of the burger with the donut, but also steals the now-cold leftover coffee and downs it in one go. It’s quiet for a while, and Steve watches Tony between his bites, a fact that doesn’t go unnoticed by Tony.
Anthony snorts, an abrupt, ugly sound he immediately reddens after. It delights Steven so truly that he can not help but give the omega a smacking kiss that deepens when Anthony pulls him forward. They lose themselves, for a little bit.
“And so, we may walk together, in this life.” Steven’s hand traces the lines on Anthony’s palm, and there something tight in Anthony’s throat, aching and confused. “And when I say I fight for you, I mean I fight for that right. For you to call me yours. For you to be mine. Safety, love, happiness.”
Blood sprays from Gregory’s mouth, and the Alpha lurches up, fist sliding past Anthony’s ribs. The blow is deadened by the heavy armour Anthony’s now enclosed in, but the force still rings clear through the metal.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that. There’s something lodged in his throat, though, a nugget that he isn’t sure he wants to relieve.
Schmidt falls off the parapet, hits the drawbridge, his spine breaking, audibly, like chalk. There are a few moments of watchful silence where they wait for a response, a movement. When there’s none, Steven rests back on his heels, looks to Anthony and then up to the castle.
It’s hard to remember what that felt like, the forgetting, in the face of Anthony’s laughter, so vivid and bright that it seems the sight will imprint on Steven’s eyes.
Anthony’s fists tighten in reflex as he takes in the scene. Bucky’s stance is relaxed, angled slightly to his right. He’s tired too, sweat matting his long hair, but not nearly as much as Anthony. His grey eyes, watching Anthony, are alert and calm.
“Mr. Stark was here,” Steve says, though his mom already knows that, “He would have – I mean, he must have done it for a reason, right?”
“...We fight for our past, for those whose lives were taken before they could learn to stand, for those who could never feel the warmth of the sun, forced to toil in mud...”
And the canyon between what Steven wants and what he accepts grows ever wider. He is patient, though, in this. Or at least, willing to be. All his life, he’s chased down Hydra, fueled by rage and grit. He’s done things with his hands that he could never admit to his mother, has a capacity for violence that scares him. With Anthony, though, he wants something different. Something kind. Something that will last.
“You’re up for the best boyfriend of all time with this.” Tony says from where he’s seated on the grass, “Though I’m not sure if it’s you or Cap who should win since you’re using the shield.”
But, in this moment, it’s hard to feel what it was that had him frozen on the rocks. He thinks that maybe there’s a crazy miraculous privilege in that.
“You sure?” Bucky presses, and then when Tony goes quiet, shakes his shoulder lightly, “Tony, are you sure?”
Steven jumps up and catches it, a jaunty, dancing movement that Bucky throws his head back to laugh at. It looks strange, with the Winter mask already in place, and Natasha nudges him with her elbow, her own laughter hidden with a hand.
He’d been trapped, in his own way, sure, but it was one thing to be alone in an ivory tower, and quite another to be exposed in the muddy pits, fighting for a day’s meal in disease-stricken, war-broken land.
“We’ll find a way, Tony.” Steve repeats, feeling useless and stupid. He wishes he had more words, better words, a solution. He wishes he knew what this Extremis was, and that he could wipe it away from Tony like he wipes his tears.
They connect, Anthony kissing Steven desperately before the Alpha can speak. Instead of taking control of the kiss, Steven accepts Anthony’s pressure, lets him peel Steven open and mould himself in the Alpha’s heat. His arms wrap around him, and the enclave of Steven’s embrace is as strong as the grace of sunlight.
“I’m not saying you have to,” Steven adds, hurriedly, “But I only ask because you seem to have ideas --”
Steve shuffles closer, wraps his arms around Tony’s waist. A shiver of hope makes itself known when Tony allows the motion, leaning ever so slightly into Steve’s arms.
When they reach the steel door, Bucky bends down and works at the lock quietly. A minute passes, then two.
“I don’t want an apology, Tony. That’s not what I meant by that.” Steve pauses, trying to figure out how to say what he feels, “It’s not like it was easy for you. And it’s not going to be easy moving forward. I guess what I’m saying is – I’m here. By your side. Til whenever you get sick of me.”
The boltshooter releases the ten-meter arrow with a ‘swish’. Anthony watches as it shoots through the air, aim clean and true, lodging into the area just above where it’s rumoured that Schmidt sleeps. It’s a tense, few moments, the arrow wedged into empty space.
Anthony smiles at the admission, a curling, slow movement that transforms his face. It is a wonderous, disarming thing to witness.
Steve hesitates for a moment before sitting down next to Tony, straddling the desk so that he faces his side-profile, “No, I’m not.”
Steven could leave it alone. He has no need for another voice on the table, and Anthony doesn’t have any real fighting experience.
He can feel when his body accepts the intrusion, the weight of Steven’s cock no longer scraping at his throat, but resting, deep in him. He’s drooling, can feel it dripping from his lips, but Anthony is high on the moment, and his eyes seek out Steven’s.
Mr. Stark furrows his eyebrows in that same expression Tony makes when someone isn’t tracking what he’s saying. It’s startling, like gazing at someone’s rendering of a landmark you walk past everyday. Steve can’t help but dislike seeing it.
Behind them, a loud hissing noise arises and they both flip around. The soldiers yell in surprise, gearing up. Clint hobbles onto a leg with his arrow out. Natasha crouches down, body curled like her namesake.
“When you asked for my ideas.” Anthony says, “I guess, I never realised how much I wanted to be heard. And you listened, and you didn’t smother or patronise me about it. I thought maybe it could work out.”
He takes him, Steven does, takes all of him, and it’s not like anything he’s ever experienced before when Anthony finally comes. It seeps through to him from the outside, pleasure prickling his skin and oozing into his veins, filling him, stretching his heart like the motion of a tide. When he comes back to himself, mind rising up, eyes dried out, Steven is still thrusting, ever-slow.
Tony turns, meeting Steve’s gaze for a moment before looking away. He pushes Steve back with a hand against his chest. It warms him, even now, and Tony’s not a healer, but he’s always been able to fix Steve up.
“Come on, let’s go to bed, we’ll all be winners then.” Steve says, arm locking over Tony’s chest and nose nuzzling into the skin below Tony’s ear.
“It doesn’t make sense, though.” Anthony counters, mind awhirl, “Steven – he killed Schmidt. He beat his face in, there’s no way anyone could – I mean, how is it remotely possible for anyone to live past that?”
The Hydra soldiers move silently, a mass of soldiers running in clean lines, and yet there are no cries, no calls, no chants. There’s an inhuman quality to it, heightened in face of their colourful opposition.
He always underestimated the King. Kept his eyes on the pawn structure, and left his King defenseless.
“I know that. But it wasn’t fair – and they’re all treating it like it’s nothing for him to be – to have nearly died. It’s like no one cares that he was put in that situation. They’re treating it so lightly. They’re all making it seem like it was his fault.” Steve explains as his mom takes out a handkerchief and wipes his face.
His voice raises at the end to a shout, and he finds himself slightly breathless; unsure. Steve’s looking at him like he’s something alarming.
“You and your sprinkles.” Tony smiles, and Steve grabs a kiss from Tony’s lips before the boy can react. Tony gasps.
“I had nightmares about killing him, about losing myself in that rage. It broke me to know what violence my hands were capable of, and when I finally let myself feel the sorrow and righteousness of my actions, I am made aware that it was all for --” Steven breaks off, shaking his head as if to dislodge the thought. “What was the point?”
“Mr. Stark said we can’t fix it.” Steve continues, “I don’t know what’s happened to him. I don’t know anything.”
He kisses him there, on Steven’s cockhead, licking and tonguing at the slit, feeling Steven shake above him, minute tremors that seem to slowly tick larger and larger until Steven stiffens up entirely.
“Extremis is a variation of the super serum, from what I gathered in the Mandarin’s stupid monologue. But it’s a code, so I managed to figure out what was going on and I – oh, shit.” Tony breaks off, clutching his head.
“Thank you for hunting him, and for letting me kill him.” Anthony clarifies, “You’ve given me freedom.”
Anthony hasn’t heard a voice like that in a while, and its cadence has him unsettled for a moment, the feeling like seeing the dining chair being used for shitting.
Steven is a butcher. He slices through bodies, shoves down attacks, dances through defenses. It’s almost an art form, watching him move through the pack, clean and quick and ruthless. Bucky and Natasha follow him, protection and clean-up both.
It’s comfortable, and Steve knows the group’s consciously making an effort to keep things light. He catches his mom’s gaze across the room, the smile on her face quiet and proud. He smiles back at her, mouths “Thank you”. She winks at him.
The masked woman, the golden faced Alpha he’d seen shoot down her own soldiers in that initial bloody charge, stands at the doorway. Her eyes gaze at him from beneath the mask, hard and glinting like pomegranate seeds. Her armour is svelte, open-collared and unprotective. Dagger sheaths hang by her hips. She pulls one out now, already stained dark.
Below, the soldiers startle at the sound, bows and swords coming up and a moment of quiet spreading in the air as they gaze upwards in confusion. Anthony looks through the gaps in the wall, spots Bucky slip away. He can’t see Steven and Natasha from here, but he knows, wherever they are, they’ll start moving.
An Alpha who has killed and conquered. A warlord. A boy who was raised in Brooklynite, pulled apart and pushed down in their trenches. A boy who turned into man in those trenches, who stood up and fought back. Countless times. Took a shield and put it in front of his family, swore to live his life for something bigger than him. Swore to see the fight through.
When the tears come, they don’t hurt. There’s no ache, no tightness. They just flow, easy and quick, and it’s not soon before Anthony turns his face back to his Alpha’s, lets him erase their tracks until there’s nothing but clean skin.
Anthony kisses him, taking control of the kiss as Steven shakes, remnants of fear and confusion making him slow to respond. When he tries to pull back, Steven holds him close by his arms, so Anthony continues. He opens his mouth into the kiss, pressing at Steven until he acquiesces his mouth. His tongue meets Steven’s, and the man groans, deep and rumbling, sharp in the silence of the tent.
Anthony turns. It takes some maneuvering, and Steven goes to pull out but Anthony whines for him to stay, so he stays. Anthony rests his head on Steven’s chest, watching his face.
Anthony peels Gregory’s helmet apart, and fractions of Gregory’s angry, twisted expression burst through. The deep red of the cuts marring his face are striking against the healthy glow of his face. Gregory reaches up again, and Anthony strikes at the joint in his shoulder, slashing it down.
“Better than you.” Tony’s eyes lift upwards, and the blue slips away in a blink, leaving only that familiar, honey brown. The scenery shifts, the sky peels apart.
“Perhaps I can slot you in.” Anthony responds coyly, laughing when Steven reaches down to grab him, pulling him in for a kiss.
Anthony’s eyes are fixed on Stane’s head, dislodged. The scum’s eyes are open, still in that surprised expression.
It’s only when Tony’s had a mug of coffee and three donuts that he realises that Steve’s trapped him.
It’s not long after that Steven enters him, not fingering Anthony as extensively as he normally would, keenly aware that the omega likes it just a little bit rougher when he’s in this state, yearns for the feeling of being pulled wider until his body relaxes to accommodate Steven.
“A warlord teaching a high society bitch how to fight. Really,” She continues, “Now how many cocks did you suck to get that education?”
Anthony nods, almost curious as Steven’s hands come to his hair, pulling the strands back with simple ease. He smiles down at Anthony, a quiet, lazy thing.
Everyone was made quiet in Olympus. They said you could hear a pin drop, but the floor was kept a clean, royal white, so it was likely the pin would not dare reach the floor.
Bucky shoots the crossbow at the barrier and it pings off. He looks helplessly at Steven, who turns back to the table.
There have been looks, tentative and careful from Anthony towards Steven. He has hesitated to respond, not wanting to spook the omega when he’s just beginning to enjoy Steven’s company. But it’s difficult, infinitely more now that Steven has been let in, exposed to the fullness of Anthony’s personality, his thoughts, his fears. It makes him lovelier, real and complex and untouchable.
Steve shifts his stance in a staggered movement, and then he’s leaning into Tony, enough that they both end up lowered on the ground, Steve’s head resting on the curve of Tony’s neck. It’s a few moments before Tony feels Steve move, abrupt and jittery and recognisably human. He pulls back, blinking rapidly before looking at Tony.
“Ha,” Steve huffs out despite himself, and Tony doesn’t even stir in his sleep. He wishes Tony would open his eyes, just to make a joke and kiss Steve. Just to confirm he was actually okay.
Anthony is gagged, tied to a chair, a checkered board with miniature toys on a table between him and the Carver.
“It’s okay.” Tony mumbles, and his voice is a little wet. Steve meets his mom’s gaze over Tony’s head, and watches as she gets up.
Anthony watches him for a long, thoughtful moment. Steven returns his gaze, open even as he worries that the brutality will be too much, that Anthony will see something in him that he can not accept. After a while, Anthony leans up, presses a soft, wet kiss to the bleeding line Stane had drawn over Steve’s ear. It is the first time has kissed Steve, anywhere.
“No. Steve, I’m not hurt. Look at me, nobody’s hurt. Well, in fairness, the bad guys are kinda hurt, and you’re definitely gonna get your ass kicked by Carter but --”
Gregory gasps in pain, eyes tightening and lips peeling back to reveal his teeth, almost feral in their grimace. His arm goes limp.
Steve shifts his weight. Bucky walks out of the room. Gregory raises an eyebrow, hand reaching under the table. Must be a signal to the guards. There’s a time constraint now. Steven looks to his omega. Anthony’s eyes flicker.
“Okay, hey, Steve, yeah, it’s fine. You’re okay, it’s just me and you.” Tony's rambling, relief pulling words out of his throat. The rubber band’s been cut loose.
Anthony takes his time getting out of the water, draping cloths over his waist. Steven keeps his eyes on the omega’s face. Anthony makes his way over to Steve’s side, sitting down on the furs.
As it is, Steven can only think of how pretty Anthony looks, cum running down his chest, body slick with sweat, eyes blown out.
“All that time, he didn’t physically hurt me. Didn’t touch me at all. He just – said strange things to me,” Anthony says, “Memories from our childhood, but marred. His rage towards me. Ideas of the future. Rambling monologues about genetic superiority. Designs of these bizarre, twisted machines. The things he wanted to do with them, they were...”
((He doesn’t know what he’d do differently though. He’s not been taught to permit that kind of self-reflection.))
He falls to his knees, disoriented. He wants to puke. He can feel it, the bile, ready and open. His vision blurs, though he can’t feel tears, just a vague dizziness.
His hand reaches Steven’s groin, inordinately pleased at the swelling, thick curve of his cock there. Steven huffs in air through his nose.
Starrk finishes before Steven can decide, his eyes like the dark glint of stone as he looks over Steven and his son.
He looks boyish, eyes content and shining. He smiles bashfully when Anthony raises an eyebrow at him.
“You said to attack.” Anthony shakes Bucky’s sardonic tone off, barking out a laugh when the Alpha’s scowl deepens.
It had been a stifling, gargantuan institution, and Steve had hated crossing its pearly gates. But the view -- of the world -- from there, always made it feel worth it.
Steven thought familiarity with the pack would make him speak, but even as Anthony develops a hesitant acquaintance with Bucky and uncanny understanding with Natasha, he remains quiet during the meetings.
Steve’s mom comes back with coffee and reassurances that scientists will be arriving tomorrow. Bruce ventures down, engaging Tony in a conversation about the code, a notepad in his lap as he records what Tony remembers. They start spitballing ideas with each other, and Steve’s mom calls Jarvis while they’re distracted. Jarvis comes with soup and a change of clothes. Tony showers in the infirmary’s bathroom, but Steve is forced to go shower in his dorms.
He strokes again, and Tony shivers, a visceral reaction that Tony pushes back against so that Steve’s cock meets his ass. Steve is hard; in what world could he have a naked Tony in his arms and not be? He ignores it though, keeps his hand jerking at Tony’s cock and presses the shorter man even closer until they feel stitched together.
“But you got through it, sweetie. Come on, here, look at me.” His mom lifts his head, and he gazes up at her, crying, snotty mess that he is. She looks back at him, gaze calm and warm.
Anthony grins, wicked and open. “We ruin their communication routes, force them to shut down, then break through the the gate. A direct attack before they can properly mobilise.”
He would always be playing catch-up to his Alpha, making up for years of not knowing, not seeing, not doing anything.
“Yes,” Anthony sighs, shifting back to lay down on the floor. He closes his eyes, and breathes in, tasting the clean sharpness of the air. “Shit.”
“I don’t want your apologies,” Anthony whispers, “And I don’t blame you, so there better not be any internalised guilt, alright?”
The guards on the top of the wall rally, bows getting ready to shoot. Anthony ducks down next to Parker on the catapult, though it would be near impossible for them to get him from so far away.
Steve sighs, pushes himself up, and on unsteady feet, carries Tony to the room. It’s an unremarkable bed, made for one, and Steve lays him out on the mattress carefully. Tony’s eyes stay closed. Steve takes in the sight, the stretch of Tony. Sated. Safe. So endearingly sweet.
His hands reach around to Tony’s cock, instinctively closing his fist around it, and stroking upwards. Tony isn’t quite hard yet, and Steve relishes in dragging his hand across the length of it, letting his fingertips trail over the underskin slowly, teasingly. Tony wraps a hand around his mouth, muffled moan blurring through.
“Go gentle, Tony.” Steve says, helplessly, watching Tony thrust into himself with almost brutal abandon, “Or, uh, let me. Please, fuck, let me.”
“I have ideas, I have always had ideas.” Anthony begins, “But no one wants to take orders from an omega. I have learned that.”
Happy receives the signal, pulling the catapult into place. The cannonball, a larger, metal device that had taken ages to configure, shoots into the air. It gleams in the sky, a golden colour that had been painted days prior. It travels through the air, soldiers screaming.
“Omega, you are the Carver’s brother, is this not true?” Steven repeats, voice more Alpha than human.
“Give me a leg up.” Steven says, instead. They both squeeze their way through the gap, getting soot and mud all over their clothes. Bucky swears as he pulls his crossbow through while Steven quickly surveys the interior. Their immediate surroundings are deserted. Bucky comes through and shakes the dirt off, pulling his black mask over his nose. Steven brushes soot off his shield, and his eyes catch on the courtyard, laden with dark sand, muddied and streaked with blood.
“Love you.” He says, in that same tone, and then starts up again with the song, “Love you, love you, love you.”
“Okay, okay, you’re not, fine,” Anthony shakes his head, as if to clear it, “No, I only meant – you’re not anything like what you’re saying. There’s so much good in you, Steve, please listen to me, there is. You are a good person, and a great Alpha.”
“We were born twins.” Gregory continues before Steven can speak, “And together we could build a stronger world, moulded in our image.”
His hands are the worst, torn open and angry with a red that stays even after the blood’s been washed off. Tony’s face darkens when he sees it, a shadow fixing itself over the placidity.
Tony’s quiet as he turns off the phone. He burrows in further, and Steve’s arms wrap fully around him so that Tony’s body is enclosed entirely in his embrace. Tony’s arms clutch at the side of Steve’s suit.
“I knew we were flirting. I didn’t realise it could be something more until – well, until it became something more.” Tony says, honestly.
“Yeah,” Steve says, because it’s right, and then he chokes up again. His mom holds him close through it.
“No, Steve, you don’t get to do that.” Tony says, shaky with worry and anger, “You can’t just choose to kick me out of your circle, out of your life, when it doesn’t suit you.”
He can’t quite meet Tony’s eyes then, hands collecting the rubbish and wrappers from their meal. Tony’s fingers find his jaw, pushing him to look upwards.
Anthony moves through the corridors, evades soldiers, strikes down the ones he can’t, settled now to the tune of the battle. He makes his way to the center of the castle, walks along the parapets until he spots Clint, shooting down from his perch.
“Keep going.” Anthony urges, taking Steven into his mouth again. Steven swallows, a hard motion. His hands remain curled into the furs, ordered by Anthony to stay there.
It’s a slow, repeating tune, and it takes a moment for the words to parse, but once they do, Steven inhales sharply.
Steven Hrothgars of the Brooklynites is bonded to Anthony Starrk, formerly of the Manhattenites, in the stuffy air of Spring.
“You will receive a fair trial, under the laws of the Hrothgers’ tribe.” Anthony recites, “You will be granted freedom to provide your defense, you will be --”
There is screaming, from their army, from the Hydra soldiers, pain and fear and exhilaration, mingling emotions that create a cacophony that hurts to hear.
– but all Anthony can see are bodies, humans dead and clumped together. Footprints over their faces, skulls caved in. Marks made by soldiers running over dead bodies in their attempts to escape the fire.
“That doesn’t mean it can’t feel bad.” Steven responds, arm curving over Anthony’s waist, bringing the omega closer to him.
Anthony moves above them, low and quick through the corridors. There’s barely anyone here but his eyes keep darting around nervously. His mind relays the path he has to take, a voice suspiciously similar to Natasha’s giving him directions.
“No one in this pack is without responsibility, a role.” Steven says, “If you are to stay, you must find a way to contribute.”
It was like watching wolves take off their sheepskin, and go at each other with bloody teeth and tearing skin.
The comment startles a laugh out of Steve, and he leans up to kiss Tony. Sex has always been easy between them, comfortable and safe, almost to their detriment, drawing them to each other even when they can barely look at the other. Tony is more relaxed now, at this moment, than he has been for
Starrk hands Steven a knife, leatherbound and strong, to fulfill the rite. The Alpha must go first. Steven takes Anthony’s hand, slices a clean line across the palm.
“Who I am,” Steven says, “Is someone who decided, one day, that he would purge this world of Hydra and has spent the eight years since then, fulfilling that promise at every expense. I have killed, tortured, lied, cheated.”
“Give me your dagger.” Anthony says. Steven unsheathes one from his belt, handing it over without question.
“No, you’re fucking not. And it’s not gonna be pretty if the first thing Anthony sees is you flying into a rage. We don’t know what state he’s in --”
Steven reaches through the bars and pulls the man forward, hard against the bars. They rattle. He notes Bucky going up the stairs to keep watch.
“Yes, you are.” Steven jostles Anthony’s hands a little, in his grip, “You are. I am the leader of this pack, and you are my omega. We are equals.”
“No, I am.” Tony takes a bite from the chocolate donut, and then figures that if Steve is going to continue to pursue this talk, he deserves to be spoken to while Tony’s chewing, “You’re saying all the right things as leader of the team, and I know you want to make me feel better, like the HULK nearly breaking the compound and ruining half the surrounding forestry is just a bad day instead of a precedent for what is to come. But this isn’t your fault, or the team’s responsibility because none of you had a hand in trying to fix this. It was my work, with Bruce, and we failed to find a solution. One of the first scientific endeavors we get actual independence to pursue with the backing of the Avengers, and we wasted it. And bonus! Bruce is still half-possessed by an angry green monster. So. While I appreciate the pep-talk, I really don’t want to talk to Cap right now.”
Steven thrusts into Anthony’s body again, experiencing a slightly different pressure at the looser, relaxed entrance. He sighs into the thrusts, letting the full pressure of the movement envelop him. He bends close to Anthony, and kisses him through the motions. Anthony returns the kiss, sloppy and enthusiastic.
“I didn’t know, Steve,” Anthony says finally, “I didn’t know you could understand and detest someone at the same time.”
Natasha’s hand reaches out to grasp Tony’s, the hand Steve’s not holding, and she squeezes  it before moving back. Tony exhales, quietly.
Gregory takes more hits now; Anthony batters at his head like swatting a fly. It begins to cave in, Anthony’s gauntlets making their shape known in the golden latches of Gregory’s helmet.
Sam’s letter is quite sparse. It is harvest season, so he’s likely busy and only sent the note as an afterthought. This is all good news.
When Steven finally thrusts into him, he feels complete. Like the click of a key turning through. He doesn’t know what expression he makes in that moment, but Steven’s returning look is answer enough, awed and loving.
Up close, Steve’s panting, his face and arms slickened with sweat. There’s a little blood on the cuff of his sleeve and his hands have angry purple strokes across the knuckles but they aren’t torn. His body’s vibrating again, like a coil pushed to its limit. It's not the worst he's been, under this particular circumstance.
“That’s...” Steven’s right hand brushes Anthony’s lips, puffy and swollen red as they are. “An understatement.”
Anthony’s in heat, the second time in the year, three days before Yule. It had blossomed quickly, and Anthony had found him sparring with Bucky. He’d walked up, teasing, eyes dilated and lips bitten to redness. Bucky had seen him first, promptly coughed at the omega pheromones and ran away with his sword clanging against his waist. Steven had grabbed his omega, put him over his shoulder, and ran back to their tent, grinning wildly at how Anthony’s laughter carried in the brisk wind.
Steve lets out a breath when he enters, heart skipping at how Tony lights up upon seeing him enter. Tony visibly scoots over and pats the space in his bed. Steve crawls in with him, ending up with his head resting on Tony’s shoulder, half-listening to Bucky’s ‘strategy’ for winning Annie back.
Tony’s head is on Steve’s shoulder, and he’s muttering, “Annie’s mad about you not showing up to the date. She says find a ditch.”
He doesn’t know how much time has passed when the smoke begins to thin out in front of them. The hallway ahead feels like the coming of a sunrise, bright and freeing.
Anthony reaches out, curious at the mirrored wetness he finds on Steven’s cheeks. Steven shrugs when Anthony raises an eyebrow at him. The omega gently wipes at his cheeks.
“Fuck, I, why would you say that,” Bucky turns his head to the doors, steel moving to make space for worry, “I don’t know, Tones, I don’t know if he could forgive that.”
“Yes, that is most likely.” Mr. Stark answers, “Though I’m sure he knew all of this before injecting himself.”
Bucky has been training Anthony for five months now, and Anthony’s come a long way since his early days of frenetically trying to connect with the opponent’s groin. Bucky had gruelingly dragged him through hours of technique work, teaching him the basics of fighting. He’d had to do drills for balance, speed and strength, hours of repeating movements that left him sore and bored. When they’d moved to fighting, Anthony had been relieved, finding the sparring miles more thrilling than technique work.
There’s a tussle on the parapet, ending in a quick moment with a shadowed figure smashing a bow into the guard’s face. Clint. The other guard yelps, and brings up his sword but is pulled down abruptly. Natasha. Those were the last of the guards, Steven knows, moving forward with Bucky into the moat. He lifts his shield up over his head as they move farther in, and sees Bucky do the same with his sword.
Steven rocks Anthony, the way an omega would to a pup, slow and constant. They stay there, Steven content to hold Anthony in his arms and let his tears be lost in Steven’s tunic.
The ramparts ahead have only a few stragglers, but there is noise from within; different sections coming together in preparation for attack. They won’t be easily defeated, not with the tight army that remains with Steven, and the twenty people that follow Thor.
“You won’t leave me, will you?” Steven blurts, “I know it is unfair to ask – but if you ever – you --”
Tony watches him through a mouthful of donut. Steve thumbs at the corner of Tony’s lip to remove the powdered sugar.
“You’re the one who – I mean, I think it’s fairly obvious that you’re the one who makes me better. Before you, I had nothing. I
“You look really tired, the eyebags are not a good luck, Tones,” Steve responds, laughing when Tony swipes at his chest.
Schmidt’s eyes flash, and they slither from Clint to Anthony. Anthony has never wanted so badly to run. He presses his toes to the ground, lets the pressure ground him. There’s nothing special about this creature.
Anthony had conceded after a week, when Steven had managed to pass whatever test had confirmed for Anthony that he wouldn’t jump him the second he took off his furs. He’s no longer skittish about nudity, has maintained conversations with Steven while both were nude without outward nervousness.
He moves through the hallways without quite tracking the corners, his mind seeming to run ahead, keeping him in pursuit.
“Wasted.” Gregory agrees, “He was bright as a child. Thought in numbers higher than anyone in our cohort, save for me. Pity he was ultimately revealed as the inferior sex. But his mind is still useful enough for my endeavours. And my father never understood it, broke him where he would have been better bent into a shape.”
Upon reaching the outer walls, they pause, throwing hooks over the walls and climbing up. Steven’s army reaches the barbican’s gate in the meantime, and the sight of the three sides converging is like witnessing the sun spill onto the sea, a view Anthony hasn’t seen since his childhood, back when they lived by the coast.
Steven nods. “Clint, Nat. Get rid of the castle guards, quietlike. Lift the gates, as low as you can get and still let us through. Stay at the gates, keep suspicion low. Thor and Bruce – you’re on backup. Engage as a distraction if things go south. Cut them down, no need to be considerate. Bucky and I will infiltrate through the moat, search for him.”
Tony gets up, and brushes grass off his jeans, “I can’t believe you’re making me go into the metaphor of my failure.”
It is only later, after Anthony has hesitatingly crawled into the furs next to Steven, still far enough that Steven could reach an arm out and not feel the omega’s body heat, that he speaks up.
“Sometimes, I thought you would welcome it,” Anthony says honestly, “And then other times you would seem so far away that I thought myself foolish.”
“Hmm,” Steven’s eyes are on Anthony’s lips. Anthony darts out his tongue, turning to give the cockhead a wet lick. His hand strokes the long, proud length of the Alpha, a pleased thrill going through him at Steven’s sigh.
Tony heads straight to Bucky, who upon seeing him startles from his slouch against the corridor’s wall.
Steven Hrothgars leans against Anthony Hrothgars, laughing as his mate scowls fiercely at Bucky for his present of a goose.
“Not here.” Bucky says, looking around at the crowd that’s gathered, soldiers appearing from their tents, looking sleepily at the group, “Nat!”
“Like hell" Steve murmurs, bringing down Tony’s hand so that his mouth is free again. Tony's eyes are dancing when they meet Steve's.
Steven’s mouth is gaping, almost mirroring Anthony’s jaw in their looseness, hinging open. His eyes are black, pupils blown out. His nostrils are flaring, siphoning Anthony’s scent. He looks lost, and found. Both things at once.
Hydra is still watching, guards crowding the top of their walls. They don’t make a show of it, standing like statues, four hundred yards away. The black gear is eerie from a distance, makes them look like crows.
Parker and Shuri, Beta and Omega respectively, stand by the catapults, looking disgruntled. They’d spent the last few hours flitting from argument to conversation like a pendulum, and Anthony had left them to it, happy to let them tire out. It seems to have worked, and when Anthony tells them to ready themselves, they are quick to comply. Happy and Gary take the other two catapults, having gone through the strategy at least fifty times the night before.
Anthony inhales, sharp in the enclave of Steven’s arms. He understands where this is going, Steven knows, his omega has always been quicker than the best of them.
Natasha looks dangerous in her cleanliness. The soldiers have streaks of paint and blood across their faces and necks, but Natasha is untouched. Her red hair is drawn tightly back, and her lips are curled in a sensual smile. Her gear is even more sparse than Steven’s; her argument for removing the plates on her elbows and knees being that her mode of fighting requires greater agency of movement than most.
“No, shh.” Steven clutches his cheeks between his hands. Their breadth means that Steven’s pinky finger reaches the ends of Anthony’s neck. “No, sweetheart, that was the plan, remember? You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“He’s stable.” Mr. Stark has always been inscrutable. Despite being on the board of directors, and Tony’s father, and one of the party responsible for the super serum, he doesn’t interact with any of the team. From the little that Tony’s said (or perhaps, more strikingly, left unsaid), Steve isn’t sure if he wants that to change.
“Your Alpha doesn’t operate with vengeance, you say?” Gregory accuses, “How deeply has he brainwashed you?”
Bucky watches him for a moment before releasing his grip. He steps back, a hand reaching to push his hair back; a nervous gesture Tony’s all too familiar with seeing.
They’d been so prepared. Their teamwork had been fluid, they’d made all the right moves; drawn him in, and cut off the exits. Contained all damage to a warehouse, had the high ground. And then it had blown across the coastline, and Steve had woken up in a pile of rocks with Natasha, the Iron Man suit cracked open next to them. It was only when HULK had come out of the hole Bruce had fell in that they’d staggered into dazed action, Steve reciting orders that he’d heard from outside himself.
The admission is not easily given, and Anthony wipes the tears away from Steven’s cheeks, wishing the gesture could ease his soul too. He kisses his Alpha’s cheeks, smiling softly as Steven leans into it.
The gold cannonball, shot through their gate, forgotten by Hydra soldiers who circle around it like a misplaced stone, breaks open. Like a boil, it pulls apart, and their men and women burst forth with bloodcurling screams.
(If he could go back -- if he were made of something more than faith, he would turn back time to this moment. There is an outcome waiting at the end of this line that will prickle at him for many years.)
“Okay, okay,” Steven rests his palm against Anthony’s, “Alright, I’m sorry, okay? I don’t want to fight now. Are you feeling alright? That was intense.”
It’s not often that Anthony needs to soothe Steven during their mating. The Alpha seems to take particular satisfaction in the moments where Anthony is putty under his hands, likes to take control of Anthony’s limbs and pull him close, whispering quiet melodies into Anthony’s skin.
"Okay." Steven says, and then makes a point to laugh, quick and hearty, into the dark. Anthony relaxes, almost imperceptibly, to Steven's right.
Parker hurriedly brings him the binocs, and Anthony places them over his eyes, impatiently zooming in on the top of the castle.
Bucky moves from his place behind Anthony’s shoulder, puts his knee over Stane’s back, and leans forward to mutter at the man.
Their soldiers are doing well but they’re overwhelmed. The Hydra soldiers are reckless, throwing themselves into danger without concern for their lives. They cut anyone who drags them down, Hydra or otherwise.
There’s a neat, twisting flip, and Anthony is on his back again, Bucky pinning him. He hisses, feet kicking messily at Bucky’s torso. Bucky swears, and his head lowers as he resettles to pull Anthony’s arms back.
“You were swinging your legs over it the whole night, I’m sure you can handle it.” Steve comments dryly.
The omega is giggling when they break apart. Steven watches him closely, wanting to capture the image.
They keep walking, Anthony quieter this time. Eventually, they leave the castle through the drawbridge.
He doesn’t think that anyone will be in the kitchen but Steve has always made it a point to surprise him.
“No,” Steven says, “As I said you when you first asked, it is your right to attend and contribute to such meetings, as my omega.”
“What are you talking about?” Steve asks, grabbing Tony’s hand and squeezing it. Tony looks at him, and Steve flinches. His eyes have returned to that black film.
“No,” Steven replies, and before Anthony can deflate, adds, “Because you are not my follower. I could not treat you as such.”
Steve snorts, but leans into Tony’s kiss. It’s slower than earlier, measured and gentle. They break apart slowly, close enough that Steve’s breath touches Tony’s face.
“I don’t know, Thor.” Anthony says, “I know the plan, I know what I need to do. But when I try and think of it, it’s like ... a blank spot. I can’t hold onto it.”
It is less severe than it has been before, if Steven has moved past the bloodlust and into this muted despair. Bucky steps back in recognition of this, letting Anthony walk through to his Alpha.
“That is valid enough.” Anthony nocks his eyebrow, “Though how he knows is beyond my understanding.”
“I see.” Anthony says. Steven’s knot throbs in him, almost like a living, autonomous being filling him up.
It had been easier to deal with the horror of it all in the moment, with the immediate danger keeping them moving through the urge to puke. But now, sitting here with Tony, when hours before, he hadn’t been sure that Tony would survive – it all comes back. The sickness and horror untangling into their full shape, spreading over his limbs like a virus.
When Anthony doesn’t immediately respond, Steven lifts his head. Anthony isn’t smiling but there’s a bright joy in his eyes.
“Why do you attend the battle meetings?” Steven asks one night, as Anthony scrubs himself down in the corner tub.
That Anthony is the subject of such devotion is not something the Omega can quite comprehend, like a leap in intuition that seems a little too farfetched for the design of a machine. It makes him think, though, leaves him in a state not unlike Steven’s; contemplative and drifting.
Steven laughs, awed and bright as he leans forward to see how those words taste against his lips. Anthony keeps mumbling the words through the kisses, and Steven hardens under the press of Anthony’s cock to his belly.
how Steven’s strength fed his soldiers, Alphas, Betas and Omegas straightening and grinning in anticipation of the battle.
Gregory falls silent at that, some internal fight in the Alpha going quiet as he grows lax in Anthony’s grip.
Steven’s only brought his best with him; Bucky, Natasha, Clint, Thor, Bruce. They all huddle in the underbush, wet and miserable after the sticky downpour in the afternoon. Thor surpasses the bush in stature and is crouched behind a tree trunk, looking like a misplaced statue.
He takes Tony’s head, and leads him down the length of him. Tony widens his jaw, and then puckers his lips so that Steve’s got a tight, hot channel to fuck into. It’s so easy, so natural for Tony, and the picture of it blooms through Steve, makes pre-come drip down the side of his cockhead. He’s already close, and it’s only been a few moments.
Bucky proved himself to be a relentless and observant teacher, and Anthony in turn proved to be an unreasonably quick study. They had originally worked on purely defensive maneuvers, skills reserved for the rare hypothetical instance in which Anthony didn’t have a soldier around to defend him. But after a month of Anthony’s snide remarks to Steven, and Bucky realising he was quick on his feet and quicker in his mind, they had re-aligned their aim.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony doesn’t know how people have bought the whole sincere all-American boy thing with Steve. The boy’s been nothing but a menace ever since he kicked his way into Tony’s life.
“I want it to be over.” Anthony says, eyes straying to and away from the sight, “I don’t wanna be here anymore.”
Steven smiles as he watches Anthony sink to his knees to stroke the eagle’s feathers, careful and doting. America whistles, a series of notes that sound like she’s complaining.
Anthony comes in a long, prolonged moment, body arching in a shivering motion that makes Steven stutter before he continues to thrust into Anthony, drawing out his pleasure. It’s only when Anthony’s come lands on his chest that he stops, fingers swiping out to gather a bit for a taste.
“You don’t understand, Steve.” Tony meets Steve’s concerned gaze, “I was so sure. I was so sure we could do this and contain HULK. I thought that today we’d be celebrating, and Bruce would finally be free, and now I have nothing to offer him. No ideas, no solutions, no certainty.”
“I did not mean to use my force on you.” He says, looking up, “I was wrong to do that. I was upset, I still am but – I swore not to hurt you. I have broken that.”
They haven’t fucked in the month Anthony has been in the pack. Anthony doesn’t want it, hasn’t shown any need for it, and Steven will not push him into it. Even now, he makes sure to not look beyond the safe canyon of Anthony’s shoulders.
“It’s not acceptable,” Steve whispers, and his fingers press at Tony’s jaw to lift until their eyes meet, “If you get hurt, it’s not an outcome I can accept.”
“Granted it took me a while to actually realise it,” Anthony rolls his eyes at himself, “But I definitely felt conflicted after that.”
They’re in Tony’s forges, one of them. Steve doesn’t recognise which. The fires aren’t lit, and it’s quiet without the machinery, without anyone running around.
“Hello, brother-in-law.” Steven greets, lazy grin on his face. His voice is raised to carry across the soldiers, and it reaches Anthony, too, an echo in the wind.
Tony’s returning smile, assuring and cruel both, had been what had finally relented the twisting fixture of Steve’s fingers until they sat flat against the earth.
“Yeah, do as your boy says. I’ll handle this.” Bucky looks around and a note of uncertainty filters into his tone, “Somehow.”
Steve stills, looking down at his phone. He feels his mom tap his shoulder and turns the phone off on autopilot. When he glances back up, mind a whirl, his mom is helping Tony sit up. Tony’s eyes are back to brown.
“...Steve,” Tony’s voice filters back in, “I know you. That hasn’t changed, and it never will. We’ve been...
Anthony looks at him, tears making the conflict in his eyes clearer. He makes a questioning sound when he sees the tears on Steven's own face.
“I understand that.” Steven begins, “You do not need to concern yourself over being taken against your will.”
Tony’s blue eyes peer down at him; impersonal, glowing points in the dark sky that Steve latches onto even as the memory of Tony’s lips sings in his body.
“We’re going to get to safety. Re-group. Review the situation. And then act. Stevie will find us.” Bucky says. “Okay?”
Steven pulls away from Anthony, and is gratified when Anthony follows his lips with a dazed expression.
The barracks are a true jail, steel bars running down from the ceiling. There are four visible prisoners, three rough-faced men and a slip of a woman. No sign of Anthony. The guard is, in a stroke of sheer luck, faced away from them. Bucky flips the crossbow and knocks the man out.
Anthony pants, sitting up and wincing at the ever-growing ache in his back. He rests his palms on the ground, stretching slightly as he waits Bucky out.
Mr. Stark glances up from where he’d been frowning at Steve’s grip on Tony’s wrist. Steve swallows but doesn’t let go. Tony’s heartbeat is steady under him; acting as quiet support even now.
They fall into silence for a few minutes as Thor tests the give of the armour, stretching forward and trying striking variations. Anthony crosses his arms as he watches for any awkwardness.
“I want to break his body.” Steven confesses, “Rip his limbs from his joints, one by one. Make him intimately aware of the bones in his chest. I would do a great many things to be sure of his pain, his death.”
Anthony leans back as Steven speaks, and the Alpha notes this, struck with quiet shame as he breaks off.
Same reaction, but Anthony watches the ripple this time, tracks the lines that ripple across the space. Gregory’s a smart bastard; he’s removed the tell that led to the source. Anthony doesn’t know where the hotspot is.
Steven keeps talking above him, words lost to Anthony’s ears but tone coming through, halting and hushed. His knuckles, when Anthony opens his eyes to check, are white with how strongly they clench the furs.
Anthony laughs, quicksilver in the wind, and broken by the hoarseness of his tears. Steven can’t help responding to it, smiling helplessly back. Anthony notices this and his grin quietens, shifting into something more shy, infinitely warm.
“Besides, you could argue that re-arranging the clumps is you fixing your failure. Resolution, of sorts.” Steve adds.
Anthony can’t help but preen at that. One of the first things he’d learned about Steven, from the close circle that orbited around him, was how notoriously bad he was at accepting help. Medical, tactical, emotional.
Anthony leaves Gregory, thoroughly tied up with vibranium-reinforced wire, stripped out of the gauntlets on Anthony’s arms. It takes longer than it should, but he leaves with the blue gem clutched in his arms, confident that it will take even Gregory at least an hour to escape from the ties.
“Bucky,” Tony scrambles at the boy’s arm, the metal one, his hand meeting the shoulder blade, “Come on, please, you know I can help him. Get out of it. I’ve done it before. You know, come on.”
“Why?” Steve asks, and there’s the clenched jaw, righteously popping up and Tony would be annoyed if he wasn’t so worried, “I told you to stay away if it happened again. I told Bucky to keep you away --”
“My dad was here?” Tony asks, leaning back. His eyes are round and wet, and Steve wipes an errant tear away.
“Fuck me, shove your knot in me, whichever description you prefer.” Anthony firms his jaw, “I will not be taken willingly. If you want me, you will have to force it.”
He grips Tony’s waist, and pulls the man onto his lap, leaning back against the table as Tony adjusts himself in the hold. Steve rifles through a box for a rag but eventually ends up using his robe to rub the come off Tony's face.
Steve hums, taking the entirety of Tony’s robe off, leaving him bare to Steve. He nuzzles Tony’s cheek, looks down at Tony’s body as he does it.
“I --” Steven starts, and then stills, jaw clenching as he forces his body to a stop. He looks askance for a moment, childlike, his eyes moving from Anthony to behind him, where Bucky still stands.
“Oh wow,” Tony raises his eyebrows in mimicry, “It’s like I’m too deprived of something to be a nice person.”
Steven flinches, pulling away. Anthony follows him with shushing noises, eventually scrambling onto Steven’s lap to keep him pinned.
“We completed the mission, Clint pissed in their water supply, we decimated their food supply. And as we turned around to leave, we came across a masked man, watching us at the entrance. No one knew how he got there,
“Your eyes go black – not just the pupils, the whole eyeball – around electronic devices. Does it feel different in your head?” Steve presses.
“It is that I could have been him.” Anthony says, “He’s my twin, my brother, and I could have been him, may have grown to think and act like him, had it not been for – I don’t know! I don’t know what makes him so cold, so devoid of emotion. And if I do not know, how can I be sure that I won’t be – that I won’t end up –”
.” Gregory snarls. “I know what I’ve done, and I have no illusions as to the vengeance that will be enacted.”
“Yes, I think I do.” Steven says. He rests his temple on Anthony’s chest, breathing in the smell of sweat, leather and oil on his omega.
Tony sits up and gets off Steve, turns around, and sinks sloppily back onto him. He slaps a hand over Steve’s mouth and hisses: “Shut up, Ares, shut the
Tony turns away again, but stays close to Steve. Steve watches Tony’s back for a moment before he reaches out an arm, placing it neatly over the line of Tony’s hip.
“Now he wants to speak,” Gregory turns to Anthony, “A real conversationalist you’ve got here, brother.”
Steven pulls back after a few moments, however, hushing Anthony quietly when he moans in frustration. His hand combs through Anthony’s hair, stroking his temple.
Those unfamiliar faces, made golden by the campfire, singing solemnly. It had been a sad, jolting tune, unlike anything Anthony had heard before. He’d thought it a strange choice for a bonding ceremony.
“I know, it’s just --” Steven looks at him, eyebrows furrowed for a long, thoughtful moment. His eyes move to Anthony’s palm, picking it up gently. “It is true we are different. We were born with different experiences, yes, and we approach almost – well, almost everything – differently, but that is not bad. We challenge each other, make each other stronger. Because, where it matters, in our hearts, we are aligned.”
Steve closes his eyes, lets the clasp of Zeus push him down and away from the sky. He brings his arms out, and sighs, comfortable to succumb to the madness of sensation. Twenty, fourty, sixty feet come and go. His breath is stolen by the wind. His eyes sting.
The Hydra castle is surrounded by a thicket of woods, dark and moody. It offers additional protection and Hydra have set up a number of booby traps within it, creative and complex. The idea is that when Hydra soldiers overwhelm the enemy, the poor souls will run into the woods to escape and end up caught.
It’s easy to rearrange them into a comfortable position against the furs. Steven cleans Anthony’s chest off with a cloth, cupping Anthony’s cock for a second before moving away when the omega mumbles weakly to hold off.
“Well, Fury isn’t my omega, thank the heavens.” Steven brightens when Anthony laughs, confident and high, at the joke.
The Alpha lashes out, a swinging motion that is more power than grace. Anthony dives to the side in a belated response, rolling away. He crouches with an aching back; the ground is rocky here, jutting like teeth.
“Alright.” Steven lies. There are burdens which are his to carry, and this failure to protect Anthony – his bright, mocking omega who would insist he didn’t need protection – is one he will carry as surely as his oldest failures.
to have his time. If Anthony didn’t know it to be bone-deep sincere, he would find it a comedic farce.
As Steven turns to face the omega, he can’t help but think, somewhat derisively, that a pack that would sell their son for peace is no pack worth emulating. Anthony must see this in his expression for his eyes shift downwards in a calculated attempt at demureness. It surprises Steven enough that he blinks to Starrk.
Anthony promptly wraps his lips around Steven’s head, feeling his cum spurt out, hitting the back of Anthony’s raw throat. Anthony swallows what lands on his tongue, feels Steven curse quietly above him as his body draws tighter and tighter.
“Yeah, well, the bit about you having no hope or dreams is false too. Do you think the pack would follow if you were a shell? Do you think Natasha would stay with us if she thought you weren’t worth it?”
Now they’re human. Screams and yells from Hydra soldiers fill the air, caught under the cannonball. Another tendril of poison tightening his heart at the sick triumph he feels at the sight.
There’s so much noise. Everywhere: cries, metal, injury. The battle is a mess, formations fragmented into shards, slashing at each other.
He grips Steven’s chin, moving it forward when the Alpha doesn’t immediately meet his gaze. Steven’s mouth parts at the assured touch.
“More or less cruel than you charging off after Zemo?” Anthony teases, “Because my heart felt that it was being taken clean out of my chest.”
“I mean – everyone knew. Bucky teased me, in front of you, Nat too, in her own way, and Peggy – she called me to her office just to talk about the protocol on intra-team relationships. I thought you --” Steve breaks off at Tony’s increasing confusion.
He does so in record time, sprinting back to find Bucky and Natasha back. Natasha and Bruce are sprawled on the bed adjacent to Tony’s, a game of scrabble going. Bucky and Tony are brainstorming what to do about Annie, and Steve’s mom is having a quiet conversation with Jarvis by the medicine counter.
Anthony falls asleep on Steven’s chest, heat-addled and exhausted. When his knot deflates, Steven pulls out and soothes Anthony’s whimpering as he moves to quickly clean them up. He comes back to the furs and brings Anthony back to his chest. The quiet silence that follows makes him hopeful, honest.
“Oh, well,” Anthony turns onto his back, letting the stretch burn a little. He arches back, lets his hands raise above his head. “Just keep drawing.”
“Kind of, yeah,” Steve grins, before adding, “But he’s also my boyfriend’s dad. I don’t want Tony to be, I don’t know, in an awkward position.”
Soldiers mill around there, a few Hydra soldiers captured by the Wakandans. The wounded are being tended to, most with battle wounds and a few with burns marring their bodies. Samuel stands in the center, directing the medical care. Natasha and Clint are resting against a tree, looking tired but not badly injured. Anthony does a headcount: Happy, Pepper, T’Challa, Shuri, Okoye, Jane, Gregory – arguing with a green-eyed Bruce.
“My phone’s in my room.” Natasha retorts, sitting cross-legged on the bed. She peers curiously at Tony, and Steve sees her eyes widen when she sees the black film. She meets Steve’s gaze, and he’s not sure what she notices but she sits straighter.
“Did he do anything to you?” Steven pauses, kissing the reddened skin he’d coloured on Anthony. Anything darker, he’d have to get Anthony’s approval for. He’d learned the hard way that Anthony didn’t like marks being put on him without his awareness.
“That’s not what you said after the Chicago mission when I was giving you a bl – ohmmm.” Tony gets cut off by Steve’s hand covering his mouth.
Then, Steven tilts his head and presses forward. Anthony opens his mouth readily, and Steven licks into the warm, wet heat of him. Steven kisses Anthony slowly, languorous in exploring him. Anthony trembles under him, hand coming to clutch Steven’s neck belatedly. Steven responds by wrapping his good arm around Anthony’s waist, bringing him into his chest.
When Steve steps out, Tony comes forward with a salve. He rubs the bitter herbal scent onto Steve until he stinks of it. He doesn’t miss a single cut, or graze.
Anthony bows his head, and Steven sucks at the cord of Anthony’s neck. Anthony sighs, breathily, at the touch.
“Yeah, that didn’t exactly work the first time, did it?” Tony says and immediately knows it’s a little too mean, a little too cutting, but he can’t quite find it in himself to turn back now.
“Here he is, omega.” Steven calls, voice raised to reach his soldiers, poised at the camp’s boundaries. He wants them to know what this is. “I have brought this scum to you, and now you must take action.”
It has been enough time, Steven reasons – when he can no longer ignore himself circling back to their tent – enough time for Anthony to have cleaned up.
“You’re lying to me,” Anthony smiles, and Steven blinks in surprise, “But it’s fine. I’ll make you believe it.”
Bucky had worked with Anthony in the past few months, training him in the art of dueling, in the dance of swords. While Anthony isn’t a master yet, the arc of his sword is clean as it swings through the air, and the aim true as it lands neatly at the flesh of Stane’s neck.
On the parapet stands Thor, with Steven’s shield in one hand, and his trusty hammer in the other. Next to him is Loki, looking far too unharmed for someone who ran a double-spy operation.
In this moment, Steve brings Tony’s hand to his lips, pressing a kiss there. Tony turns to look at Steve, catching him in the motion. He scrunches his nose at Steve, a cute little mixture of embarrassment and contentment. Steve smiles, and presses a kiss to Tony’s knuckles again, a promise and plea.
“Tony, would you calm down for a moment.” Bucky says, hand coming to pull Tony off his stride towards the gym.
Anthony meets Steven’s gaze again, heart kicking up at the intense look he receives in turn. Steven is flushed red, and flecks of sweat rest on his temple.
“For a moment,” Anthony concedes, “And I have broken your trust for not telling you my brother was your enemy.”
It’s a clever tactic, and would probably work, were it not for Clint having taken a group of people into the woods and methodically broken down every trap they came across. Meticulous, taxing work that now permits a Wakandan army to tear through the trees, black panthers silent in their approach.
Steve looks at him for a moment, calm eyes flickering over Tony’s face before putting down the blow-dryer and walking over. He sits on the bed and Tony meets his gaze curiously.
“I love you too.” Steve says firmly, and Tony exhales in a loud “whoosh”, “Of course I do, I loved you before we even started dating. I mean, you know. I thought it was obvious.”
.” Anthony whispers, leaning forward to drape himself over Steven, letting the Alpha feel his hardness on his torso, feeling Steven’s cock too, brushing past his entrance. Steven’s body shudders as he stands up, a little staggered.
Thor’s a walking dichotomy. Anthony had never met an Alpha who wielded power so easily as Thor, and yet seemed to choose, constantly, without deliberation, to be gentle. He had terrified Anthony after the bonding ceremony, coming up to Steven with a bloody deer in his arms, a
Bucky grunts as he lands on his knees. His balance is unsteady, and he is a heartbeat too slow in jumping back to his stance. Anthony takes the opening, striking the center of Bucky’s chest with his elbow. Bucky grabs Anthony’s arm even as his chest caves from the hit, dragging Anthony down with him.
Anthony draws in a breath, shifts back. She notes this, and puts her sword on the floor, like a walking stick.
“You think you are a match for him?” Gregory’s eyes remain on the table and the pieces, “Do you know what you have, in company?”
He puts down a box on the bed, and opens it to reveal donuts. He picks up a glazed donut, and closes it.
Tony breaks off, shaking his head. Steve watches him, still panicked and on-edge. More prey than predator now.
“Just let me hold you for a bit, huh?” Steven asks, thumb stroking over the soft skin under Anthony’s eyes. “I was scared out of my goddamn mind.”
He’s hungry, Tony realises as he walks through the hallway, lights dimmed enough that his shadow follows him on the walls.
“Pleased to make your acquaintance.” Steven agrees. Anthony’s deep in it now, only gets so punch-drunk on lust when he’s deeply comfortable and deeply horny. This is something Steven’s learned, after five months of sex. He gets a thrill at this version of Anthony, knows that this state is only because his omega trusts him to take care of him. It’s all Steven’s wanted.
“Okay, okay,” Steven reassures, nudging Anthony’s head up, laving at the omega’s bond, soothing him. He pulls back when Anthony whines, high-pitched and pleading.
“How? You didn’t let me get the suit otherwise I could have repulsor’d all of this into a pile.” Tony replies.
Anthony is frozen, watching her. He’s seen people die before. He’s seen people die slowly. He’s killed someone. He’s killed Obadiah.
Bucky navigates them through the smoke. Anthony still feels lost, and mostly stumbles behind Bucky, fingers clutching the loose end of his tunic so as to not be lost in the rapidly smothering smoke.
“Only to me,” Anthony says, “And perhaps Bucky. But it took me a while to get there. And a lot of patience.”
(Korg had laughed his head off at the sight of the iron men and women walking out, and had nearly choked on his rabbit bone, eventually needing Thor to thump his back until he spat a bloody mass of bone and spittle out.)
Unwittingly, Anthony’s mind recalls the board game he and Gregory would spend hours over. Wooden pieces, wooden board. Gregory’s smirk over the fireplace, his laughter when he got a trap set up, how he wilted when Anthony saw through him.
“I’m not saying it was wrong.” Bucky’s eyes squint, “Just pointing out that you’ve got a favourite tactic.”
Anthony nods his head, steady and calm. He looks unhurt, dirtied but not bloody. A tightness in Steven’s chest, everpresent since they’d found out Anthony had been taken, loosens.
Then, with a slippery, shifting sound, the illusion breaks apart; a shimmering effect that sends rainbow lines streaming down. Through the binocs, Anthony catches a device, small and rectangular, falling down.
“Come on, Peter.” Happy says, and Shuri echoes the words. They fall to the wind, and yet Anthony can feel it, pulsing even in the soldiers down below. All of them, fighting, and watching the gate, thinking:
“Yeah?” Steve blinks away from where he’d been not-so-surreptitiously sniffing Tony’s hair. He’s been putting some different oil in it, and the scent is sharp and distracting.
“I wanted to tell you. I didn’t realise at first, who the Carver was. It was only when rumours of the virus became known that I recognised his handiwork.” Anthony finally looks up, and his eyes are far away, remembering, “We’re not close, see. As kids, he was a visionary, the smartest in the family, and just as heartless and vicious. When he presented, he was sent to the Western Seas for his education, and I never saw him again.”
“Alpha.” He greets, tugs at Steven’s head to bring him down for a kiss. Steven follows easily, licks into Anthony’s mouth. The omega retaliates, and they battle for control a little, Anthony only relenting when Steven reaches to press at the wetness that’s gathered between his legs.
He sinks down and kisses Steve, tipping him over, and onto the floor. There’s a moment where the world stutters, and then Steve’s floating again, through the clouds.
“Anything.” Anthony says, and then hurriedly adds, “Filtration systems, prosthetics, tools for healing and cooking.”
Anthony and Bucky whirl around to see Steve run out of the courtyard, face and hair covered in soot. He looks like a mad wolf, hair messy and armour falling apart. Only the streaks of blood remain on his cheeks, the blue and white long rubbed away, hidden under soot.
Anthony glares at him, but doesn’t push away when Steven wraps himself around Anthony, resting his head over the omega’s.
.” It’s more guttural than speech, and it keeps going, he’s speaking without thinking while Tony rides him hard and good. He’s turned away from Steve, so it’s just the long, sweaty expanse of his back, and Steve’s cock, thrusting in and out of Tony. Steve can’t tear his eyes away from the point where they meet.
Anthony turns his gaze to the field, where the soldiers are now getting ready to fight. Helmets have been latched on, and the formation sharpens into an arrow. Steven’s shield rises above them, the center behind which the army arranges itself. Natasha and Bucky flank Steven at the front of the arrow, the Widow and Winter behind the Captain.
“Not – not in any way I can say for certain.” Anthony leans back, rests his head over Steven’s shoulder. “I’m not sure I understand it.”
“Cap,” Bucky says, as they reach the gates. There’s an all too familiar tone to that single word, and Steven gives him a quelling look.
. He’d been the only one to get them a gift, and his delighted laughter at everyone’s confusion over when and where he’d got the deer had been what had uncoiled, just a twitch, of the fear that curled in Anthony.
“I don’t feel it.” Tony answers belatedly, “Not the eyes. When the phone came near, it was like a bee buzzing near me. I couldn’t ignore it. But I can’t – control it. The words just came to me.”
“Oh honey,” His mom puts down her stuff on a table and rushes forward. Steve’s leaning forward before he realises, and he’s soon ensconced in her arms.
“Tony threatened me with the armour! And we’re not having that conversation now, anyway. ‘Cause I've got to somehow hide this mess from Carter, and all I'm willing to hear from your ungrateful ass is “Thank you, Bucky. You’re God’s gift to the world”.”
She runs at him, and he’s almost intimidated by her hardiness, to go straight into a sword. He thrusts forward, and she brings her dagger up, knocks his hand down with a speedy gesture that leaves him clenching his wrist, the sword fallen. She picks up the sword before Anthony can react, thrusts it back at him. He barely avoids the strike, steps low and forward, kicks her side viciously.
“I have so much darkness, reserved for Schmidt.” Steven continues, “And I thought with his death, I could leave it behind. But he is back, and it pulses in my heart, strong and twisted and leaking.”
“And have you ever built anything you didn’t know would go to safe, trustworthy hands?” Steven asks.
“Well, I’d best leave you and the goose to your evening.” Bucky announces, loud and provocative, as he leaves.
“I know,” Anthony smiles as he pulls back. He mouths at the head, hands coming back to grip Steven’s length, just a tad too tight. How Steven likes it.
Anthony walks forward, and Steven inhales sharply. When he looks up, his face is streaked with tears.
“Oh, America, come here, sweetheart,” Anthony says, when America scuttles out from the side of the log.
Anthony dips his fingers in the blue paint, and then drags a long, straight stroke across Steven’s cheek. Steven is patient under Anthony’s touch; calm, blue eyes watching him.
Anthony can feel himself hardening, can feel his hole clenching and unclenching, wetness pooling almost too quickly under his tunic. He’s not exactly comfortable on the ground, and shifts his back to rest on the rocky surface.
