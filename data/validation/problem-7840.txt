some 5D chess plan, which this was not. Turned out, her instincts had been right. Swallowing her terror, she knocked more arrows. Explosives, again. There was no way, she figured, that they were going to walk out of here alive if Hydra kept pouring through the goddamn entrance to the great hall. Which, really, left her with only one tactic that she could think of. One she’d learned from the Mulan cartoon. There was no 5D chess in that play, either. She had three explosive arrows nocked and aimed up.
But hadn’t Steve himself deepened that fear? Hadn’t Tony seen the damage he had done with James and just tried with all her might to avoid it with Kate? Hadn’t she just been trying to preserve their relationship? Really for the first time, Steve was seeing what Tony saw. She hadn’t been seeing Howard, like Steve had accused her of. She’d seen
“Yeah ok,” Peter agreed.
Francis climbed over a car and jumped down to where she was. He was covered in dirt. He had a white bandage on his arm, already soaked through with blood. That was one thing they could be grateful for—there were almost always EMTs on the scene, along with firefighters, policemen, and even military personnel. They had help—but it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t ever enough. And plenty of the police and military were unwilling to take orders from a sixteen year old girl. James had had more luck in his command. Francis laid down on the pavement next to her.
“He’s just trying to look like another tourist,” Clint disagreed. “Hiding in plain sight is usually the easiest way to do it.” Steve realized just then that he was, in fact, leading the whole group, the one out in front as they walked. He figured he might as well take advantage of it—he moved off the sidewalk as he found a sunny, quiet spot. Pepper unfurled the blanket they’d brought, laying it out on the ground, and Jane started unpacking the picnic basket as they all sat down. It was unseasonably warm and sunny for November, which was why they’d chosen a picnic—outside they could be certain there would be no bugs or cameras, except those which 3490 might have planted on them.
,” James cried out, unable to help himself. Perhaps he should be brave. Perhaps he should be ok with this, with dying for the greater good. But all James could think about just then was that he was about to die and he wanted to

“It’s pretty crowded in there,” James spoke as they stopped in front of him.
“I mean, I have a body guard shaped like Superman, I should really take advantage of that don’t you think? Never have anybody to play with. Well, Happy, but he likes boxing and—well, don’t get me wrong, I like boxing, but I just
“James! Congratulations!” Tony said, smiling. “This calls for some bubbly, I think. Anyone want to help me get the champagne glasses? Oh thank you, Jane, Pepper—you too Kate, Peter, come on.”
“Should probably go wash up,” Peter said, gesturing behind him with his thumb. “I’ll go do that.”

“Oh,” Bruce replied, too overcome with sudden emotion to say anything. He knew why his double was asking. “Oh it—I don’t—Betty and I got married before—before everything.” His double was still. Very still, very calm, very natural. Bruce felt his gut twisting for this far less fortunate version of himself. And yet at the same time he felt a perverse relief, a ‘better him than me’ feeling, and he hated himself for that.
“Just stay with me?” Tony asked. “Unless there’s something urgent…” Steve kissed her wrist again.
“I don’t know,” Fury interjected. “But what I do know is that he’s not making a move until he has Rogers—the
Tony could admit to himself, privately, that he was touched. Outwardly, he waved the tablet and said,
Somehow, Steve had talked 3490 into going along with this little plan, letting them have their own space to work. Tony knew he’d have to sweep it for bugs every time they went—hard to do, with Antonella’s technology—but it could work as a space to start building their own device to get themselves home…if only Tony had any idea where to start.

of you?” Tony shouted. Her expression wasn’t right. Livid was certainly one way to describe it, but her eyes were too wide and her face was too pale.
“I’ll try his cell, you sweep this floor,” Natasha said, whipping out her own cell phone while Steve swiftly made his way through the crowd and out into the hall. Despite it being one of Stark’s homes—Stark Manor, to be precise—Steve had never been in it before. Nevertheless, he knew the layout well. He walked quickly down the hall, checking room as he went. Empty. Empty. Empty.
“Kate is overly obsessed with health food,” 3490 Tony said. Nevertheless she picked up the wrap, still eyeing it suspiciously.
“So. We’re stuck in an alternate universe. We have no way of getting out of here without trusting our alternate versions to do it for us. We have no idea what we’re up against or why we’re here. Sound like a succinct summary?” Steve asked the team.
“Shut the door behind you. We need to move
It was too little, too late. Like ants below, she could see that Steve had stopped fighting. Either he was dead or unconscious. They were dragging him away.
“For what?” Kate shot back. “Going to fucking school? Just keep your mouth shut about it, yeah?”
“I think…maybe we ought to check back in on the kids,” Steve said.
“The metal man and the Captain,” he said, seemingly incapable of voicing anything else. Tony reached for Pepper’s hand, scrabbling for...something, though Tony didn't even know what. Pepper seemed grateful for the contact.
“Think she
And he realized, in that moment, that for the first time in a long time, he actually wasn’t looking towards the past—he was staring into his future, what might be his future, and he was ready to forge ahead.
“Her tech is integrated with her
“What else would it be?” Steve asked. “It was powering that device.”
“Please spare our hearing, Stark,” James said sharply. Kate had no idea how Alt Steve was driving them through this mess, dodging bullets and lasers and yet another dinosaur, if he was also listening to the comms. Kate just held tight to his waist so she didn’t go flying every time they had to run straight over some debris. “We all heard you earlier.”

“Sorry, honey, we’ve got take a shortcut,” she said. Her armor grew up out of her—a sight he would never truly get used to—and Steve grabbed on without question. She flew them down to the ground, where everyone had gathered. People were still flooding out, but as he saw the penthouse crew running outside, he relaxed. “Ok people, we need to back up. Get away from the building, as far as possible—”
much about science. He’d been a liberal arts kid. He knew the basics, and he knew anything that was practical to know—how to hot wire a car, for instance, or defuse a more simple bomb. But he wasn’t an expert in trans-multi-versal travel, or time travel (despite his own similar experience), or nanotech, or any of the other crazy things some of his teammates understood. However, despite Steve’s relatively limited understanding, he did understand three things: one, the space stone opened doors in or through space. Two, the universe around them was full of holes because of too much destructive travel through it. So, three—those two things together were

“Did any of you—” their father spoke haltingly, awkwardly. Usually he was so good at family talks. “—Do you want to talk? About anything? I know there’s—it’s been—the past few weeks…” He couldn’t seem to get his tongue under control.
So much for sleep.

you didn’t like my meatloaf?” she asked. 3490 Steve opened his mouth and then shut it again. The pair was drifting gradually out of the room. “You could have told me that twenty-six years ago! How many meatloafs have I made for you?” They left the kitchen, and just like that, the stress of the evening was over.
“Not Hammer Industries. Their tech is worthless,” Steve replied. He’d seen its very uselessness when Stark Industries had stopped contracting with the military. It hadn’t been pretty. There had been many times when he’d cursed Tony Stark, the unreliable genius playboy inventor who had stopped his company’s weapons production after suffering captivity in Afghanistan. The green movement might be a worthy cause, but Steve hated to see his boys get taken out because of inferior tech. The Senator just laughed.
It struck him at that moment that, though they’d been in a different universe for months, and though they’d been fighting enemies from various points of 3490’s timeline, he hadn’t even really thought about the possibility of traveling backwards in time until just then.
“Yeah? Can we defend better against a bomb that way? Or knock out gas?” Tony asked. Steve frowned.
“I think we should go,” Natasha said suddenly. The group all stared at her. To be sure, 3490 had their secrets. Steve didn’t figure that
“Azari isn’t even
“Well excuse me, princess,” he said, mocking. “Your golden chariot got stuck in traffic.” He glanced briefly at the Avengers, as if just noticing their presence. “I thought the Alts were supposed to leave yesterday.” Kate sighed dramatically.
, it occurred to Pepper that this was not necessarily the natural order of things. And a small seed of discontent burrowed into her belly, almost unnoticed by her in that moment. It was a seed of jealousy—jealousy for double Pepper and the shiny ring on her finger with the promise of a different life. She was jealous of her clearly more level-headed boss, her more stable friend, her work life that obviously didn’t entirely consume her social one.
“She wouldn’t have to,” Tony said, his voice barely above a whisper. “Her—Extremis, the thing that computerized her brain? She mentioned it was like a virus. If she has tech that goes down to the cellular level… Goddamn, she wouldn’t have to do anything more than
“Whatever. We’ll catch you up eventually. Do you at least know the first rule of helping somebody else?” Kate asked.

They weren’t dating. Francis had never indicated that he

Peter cleared his throat, announcing his presence. Dad paused and so did Mom, stuck in their fight. Dad was reaching up to grab the remote that Mom held up high and behind her head. They looked at him for a moment, but he couldn’t get his throat to work properly.

“Tony might have been many things to the world. Iron Man was loved and cherished around the globe, and there are plenty of people with stories about the good Iron Man did, and why they loved Iron Man. And Tony was Iron Man—but Tony was so much else, too. I want—I want to make sure that’s not forgotten. But while you’re all thinking I’ll—I’ll start with one of my favorites.
laptop, Tony, I’m not as helpless as you apparently think I am,” Steve said. He put the bread back in a cupboard. He might have slammed the door shut with unnecessary force, but luckily it didn’t break—a super-soldier proof house came in handy. Tony’s brow was creased. He looked like he was
Their universe was not a fluke. So Steve was far less pissed when he realized what a massive help 199999 was in the field—even with 3490’s far more extensive pool of superhumans, the Chitauri were causing massive damage. And conveniently 199999 knew exactly how to take them out.
“And how long will that be?” Peter asked in a small voice. He didn’t know how much longer he

“How many species of alien can you name? Their weak points, strong points, whether or not they’re typically friendlies?” she asked. Again, their group was silent. Steve only knew of the Chitauri and the Asgardians. Steve knew that Thor knew many more, but he wondered—did he know them all? Would they encounter
“Or is it a girlfriend? Tell me you’ve got one of those. You have to have one by now it’s been…what, a year since I asked you last? It’s of your secret girlfriend, isn’t it?”
risk. So
“Oh. Huh. Never really noticed that before,” she said. “That’s why you came down to the garden, then? To sketch?” Steve nodded.
“Stark.” “Rogers.”
“Hey,” he said.
“I’m Special Agent Steve Rogers,” Steve replied. “My first name is Steve. Does that make you more comfortable, Senator?”
“Oh? Really? Well that’s—hey, I mean, congrats—” Steve pulled Tony close with one arm wrapped firmly around his waist.
“Yeah yeah yeah,” Johnson grumbled. He started walking towards the wall. He clapped his gloved hands together, and instantly they lit up, glowing, glittering blue patterns swirling across them. He pressed his hands flat to the wall and began to climb, sticking as he went, the rifle slung across his back.
“Hi boss,” she says, forcing cheer into her tone. “It seems that, with all of you away, I’m slightly under attack here at the tower. JARVIS counts eight invaders, at least. I’ve got him controlling the other suits. FitzSimmons are on lockdown in the workshop.”
-- and wonders if it’s the universe’s messed-up sense of humor to make a package deal of a nuclear-powered soulmate and an electronic stepkid to go with his cybernetic arm.
“That’s the tricky part, Carol,” he says with a sigh, “because it requires you to trust me and my shiny new Phoenix-like abilities. Right now, there’s a Cosmic Cube-powered little girl who thinks Hydra is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and you don’t have anything up your sleeve that can
Toni is a clingy fucker, all hands and whines and
She jolts her shoulder as she crashes into the floor, skidding across the slick tile and leaving a wide smear of red behind, and everything goes white and staticky for a bit.
His mouth is dry. His higher thought processes are sliding away, because he’s had a lot of time over the last few weeks to think about what it would be like to have his arms full of a squirming Toni, but somehow, reality trumps everything. He fumbles for words and manages to find them. “What do you want, Toni?”
Toni does not miss the utterly filthy look Carol side-eyes him with, and the corner of her mouth curves up into a smirk. Oh, she and Carol are going to get along
Steve sighs and rubs the back of his neck. “When I was… not myself, I studied footage of all of you. Hawkeye is quick and unpredictable hand-to-hand. He adapts quickly and comes up with unconventional angles of attack. You’re faster and a little more efficient, but I recognize his style in yours. Widow’s too, but mostly his.”
“Yes.”
She’s comfortable in bed in one of Clint’s t-shirts and clean panties, pillows a virtual cloud of comfort behind her back, wrist propped on another pillow at her side, bottle of water and
“Good,” Natasha says, pleased. “I’ll go run the bath, and then I’ll come back and help you out of bed. Try not to injure yourself in the five minutes I’ll be gone.”
Her speed is limited in the tight corridors, but Steve's is not and he's catching up ungodly quick. She shoulders a set of reinforced double doors hard, barrels through them into the storage facility once used for Stark smartbombs, now used to house satellite assembly facilities, and pitches the shield as hard as she can into the distance.
“We’re soulmates, Uncle Obie. We get along just fine.”
There'll be another update soon. This one got too long, so I cut it in two. The second half will be up maybe later tonight, but within a few days at the extreme.
, Bucky thinks, but without any real anger. What he’s hearing is really goddamn enlightening. In some ways, maybe Clint has a better claim to the title than he does.
“I understand,” Rhodey says, and Toni thinks that the warm, soft tone means that he’s telling the truth. “You know where I am when you are. G'night, Toni.”
“I did,” Phil says, sits in the chair in front of Toni’s desk, and takes a sip of his own. He immediately has to fight not to let any number of filthy moans out of his mouth when the flavor bursts across his tongue. He should have known Toni would have orgasmic coffee in her private office. It’s difficult, but he manages to hold them all in. “This is good,” he says, proud at how mildly polite his tone comes out, and takes another sip.
” He turns in time to catch her, staggers back a couple of paces and slides his arms under her ass as she jumps. Her legs wrap around his waist, feet locking at the small of his back, and her hands fist in his loose hair, gripping tight. “I don’t fucking
but hesitates. JARVIS is his own man, this should be his decision. “What do you think, J? Do you want to integrate them?”
She hits the boot jets a hundred feet up, and her freefall becomes a streaking dive. One, two, three targeting matrices lock onto the vehicles, but her eyes are all for the van in the middle. Fifty feet, thirty feet, fifteen feet…

“And what big picture is that?”
Toni isn't seated at her desk, or standing at the holo display center, like he expected her to be. Instead, she's standing at the floor-to-ceiling windows, leaning against the glass with one shoulder, arms crossed over her chest. She’s looking out and down, eyes fixed on something beyond the tower. “What can Stark Industries do for SHIELD this morning, Coulson?”
Rhodey is a champion fretter. She learned that one the hard way while still in college. Anything someone did to themselves, hangovers or sleep debt (or that one time she managed to cut her arm nearly to the bone when she had the brilliant idea to supercharge the can opener, which she and Rhodey have mutually agreed to never so much as think about ever again because Rhodey says he'll hear the dying shrieks of the fridge in his nightmares forever), none of that ever wins sympathy points with James Rhodes. Accidents, illnesses, and no-fault injuries, on the other hand, bring out the super-protective mother hen from deep within his psyche. It’s only because he cares, and it’s only because he wants to help, but if she learned anything post-Afghanistan, she learned that Rhodes in hovering-protector mode is fucking annoying nearly as often as it is appreciated.
Toni sighs, runs her hands through her hair. “You realize that once people become
“Thank you,” Tricia says, and sits back down. Toni honestly can’t wait to read that article, makes a mental note to buy a dozen copies as soon as the magazine goes to print. Doesn’t even care that Pepper’s threatening violent dismemberment in her ear, as she selects a reporter at random and takes the last question of the day
“Jesus, Bucky.” It’s less a curse and more of a prayer as it leaves her mouth, and the bond between them wakes with deep, solid emotion. “We don’t have time to do anything,” she groans, but her hands are skimming under the hem of his shirt anyway, pressing firm and warm against his abdomen and hips, nails digging in until he’s hissing and grinding into her, skating up to trace his mark under the cloth. Swallows his moan with her mouth.  ”Coulson’s going to be here soon. We have a meeting.”
“And the filing, ma’am? Threat, or Plot?”
“No, sir.”
That can’t be. He crashed into the ice, promised her a date, heard her crying as he blacked out… They’re not married.
Short update. :) Another coming soon.
Tony hides the convulsion of his throat at how humiliated Steve sounds by turning back around and letting his hands fly over his console, saving and sweeping away his design work, pulling up his programming matrix. “I can whip someone together to help you out.”
“Damn,” he breathes, takes a moment to appreciate the svelte form she cuts against the sky and the sea, shakes his head in consternation at the fact that she still doesn’t seem to have cottoned onto what’s going on, and sighs as he takes off after her.
That’s a question Bucky would very much like answered himself. He eases himself back against the wall and leans there, not feeling the least bit sorry or guilty for eavesdropping, and waits for Clint’s response.
Yep. Gonna get along
“Completely,” Tony deadpans. “You know me so well. I could never possibly reciprocate.” He turns to face Steve, tilts his head. “I know you were a little busy not being yourself, but you
“Unit online,” comes the smooth, cultured voice of a vaguely British man. The intonation is mechanical, but she is expecting that. She bounces her knee, exultation soaring through her synapses, because the voice patterns were one of the very few things she wasn’t sure she’d coded properly.
people, I don’t take kindly to other people taking them back,” she says, side-eying him.
Just as he’s pushing down on the handle, he pauses. “J, how long’s it been since Toni slept?”
Bucky takes a long breath, releases it through his nose, rubs the back of his neck. "Jesus. Shoulda seen that coming a mile away."
Toni’d probably want to do her own punching, though. He keeps forgetting this is a time when the ladies want to look after their own slugging and slapping.
“She was under a lot of stress, sir.”
A map flares to life, state-level with highways and the city’s borders highlighted. Moving more or less parallel to the coast of the Long Island Sound blinks a red dot. “Any idea where they’re going?”
Fury isn't dumb, and Phil knows that, but he honestly can't tell if that's ever come into consideration. Fury’s face shows nothing. “Explain.”
Toni’s pretty tired of talking by the time she finishes her speech, but the vultures have been promised a Q&A session, so she takes questions as Pepper directs her to take them. Most of them are fucking stupid, like is her soulmate going to take a more public role in the company. Who made her dress. Does she have any sex tips, since she spent a lot of time in the European tabloids with a wide variety of partners. Toni answers these mostly by rote, since she’s been asked a hundred variants a million times. But the question that she finds the most interesting and fun to answer comes just as the 30-minute question-and-answer period is winding down.
“My schedules run the world.” Pepper hangs the garment bag on a hook on the coatrack behind Toni’s desk. “And yes, you’re hideously ancient,” she agrees, and shoves the toiletries bag into Toni’s chest. “Twenty-four,
Well, okay. Not
Tony launches into a far more technical explanation about his Extremis nanotech and immune system responses than Steve is prepared or interested to follow all that closely, and he’s only half paying attention to the details as his mind whirls through all the new pathways and doors he can see opening in his mind’s eye. An embodied cosmic force, one perhaps powerful enough to challenge Schmidt’s embodied cosmic force, if he can’t coax Kobik to spend more time with him than Schmidt.
, the way everyone just drops like someone flipped a switch, but he’ll take it as the preferred alternative to being Kobik’s Real Life Dolls. Kobik herself trembles and stares at Tony with liquid eyes and a quivering lower lip, then wails again like a kid with a broken toy and vanishes.
It’s not the first time Toni’s been certain of her own death. If she doesn’t get killed here, it’s probably not going to be her last. But she’s never been so
Unless people remember Tony and his new powers, of course.
Pepper, nonplussed, has a bottle of water ready when the protein shake from hell is gone. Toni all but snatches it out of her hand and drains that too.
"If you need an anchor, I can patch you through to Hawkeye or Black Widow," he says after a pause.
“Yeah.” Bucky’s voice is raw. “I told ‘em.”
Natasha really wants to roll her eyes, finding it especially difficult to resist doing so when Clint chimes in with, “That’s what I said.”
she says, warm and tempting.
“Bucky was right,” she says into the silence. “I am an unbelievable asshole. I may have lost my marbles a little, but that’s why I’m supposed to listen to people who love me, because they want me to do basic things like drink water and eat food and sleep once every two days. I did not, I can’t clearly remember but I have the sneaking suspicion that I treated you all pretty fucking awfully, and I’m very sorry I was obnoxious and pissy.”
husband. She is much too young for the rigors of Valkyrie training.”
A muted cheer goes up from across the room, and Steve automatically looks towards the noise. Rhodes is hunched over in front of the open door, which confuses Steve for a moment until a pair of pale hands come awkwardly around Rhodes’ back to pat his shoulder.
He’s been dead before. He likes his odds.
It usually does, because he's so ridiculously lost on her. He’s smiling as he opens the chat messenger, wondering what silly thing she’s found for him this time.
Tony shakes his head slowly, and despite himself, his heart really goes out to her. Despite her mind-bogglingly immense power potential, Kobik’s a kid, and a very young one at that. He isn’t going to allow her to run rampant over anyone’s free will anymore, but that doesn’t change his certainty that she really doesn’t know what she’s doing with any level of consequence.
“I sent him to take a shower. He smelled like the swamp. Clint is digging him out clothes that aren't covered in the blood of his enemies. He refused to go anywhere until I told him you were waking up, and you wouldn't appreciate a filthy man hovering over you. Then he was more than agreeable about bathing.”
“Of course, sir.” The AI’s voice is equally soft. “I've already made that note.”
He can only imagine all the shit they’ve been through. All the ways they’ve fucked. He’s seen them cuddling on the couch, seen them give those intimate fucking looks to each other. It eats at him, gnaws at him, deep down in his gut. It takes everything he has not to go find Clint and punch him bloody.
By the time Hogan parks the car in the lot in front of Lady Lexa’s Fine Jewelry, Steve has a very good idea of exactly the kind of concerns Hogan has in keeping Toni safe and secure. Precious little of it has to do with the fact that she regularly seals herself inside a tin can and goes flying off at Mach speeds.
When he asks her if she’s okay, she blinks at him once or twice and says, “Yeah. I’m okay. The nanites are still in the process of shutting down and flushing out of my system. It’s a little tiring, that’s all.”
With effort, he shakes it off and smiles. “Come upstairs,” he says, reaching carefully out to take her hand, giving her plenty of opportunity to pull back. She’s been less and less jumpy around him since their arrival, but he still sees the wariness, feels it skitter across his chest, every time he reaches for her. “I’ll make lunch.”
She nods, and her legs wobble like a baby deer. She turns so her back is against the wall, and she starts to slide down. “Sure is. Do you mind if I sit? I need to sit.”
“Steve wants you to like her,” Carol says, drifts closer towards him.
He picks up his shield and slings it onto his back, then races for the cockpit and slides into the controls. Peggy’s voice washes over him, and he remembers how her lips tasted when she kissed him not more than fifteen minutes ago, a good luck and a goodbye that might have been something more, maybe even the person represented by his other, solitary mark, but Bucky’s gone and his heart is hollow and Steve is long past caring.
He learns their quirks, and their rules. Learns their coping mechanisms and their strange way of orbiting around each other. Learns that, as tight-knit and close as the three of them are, there is plenty of room for a fourth person. Learns that they are happy to make room for him, learn his quirks, his rules, his coping mechanisms.
She tsks, extending her arm upwards, repulsor port warm against her palm. “Hydra needs to institute some sort of basic firearms training,” she says, and shoots him square in the face. “You guys are worse than stormtroopers, seriously.” The guard flies back, out of sight, and Toni charges both palm ports again.
She can feel them both, solid and real and strong, wrapped in distinct presences around her mind. Bucky, raging and cold, Steve, stalwart and steady. A whisper of herself, bright and hot. Balanced and counterbalanced, blurred at the edges and melding into each other, so it's hard to say where one ends and the next begins.
“Bucky should go,” Toni continues, turning back to the room at large. “Rhodey and Carol. You’re the ones who can handle a supersoldier if he’s really flipped his nut. Clint and Tash are the best at infiltration and intelligence-gathering. Coulson, you’ll probably want to be on site in case things go tits-up which, let’s face it, they usually do. So that leaves me here to hold down the fort. Which is fine. I have JARVIS and FitzSimmons to keep me company. Also distracted. I haven’t had a good sciencing in awhile. It’ll keep me busy. And I’ll stay on comms in case you need another suit.”
They were never illusions.
“Clearly,” Carol says flatly, moving around to stand in his line of sight. She has an eyebrow up, and her arms are crossed over her chest. “People who are fine punch holes in heavy-duty, impact-resistant, shock-absorbent bags specially engineered for supersoldier strength
“You were legally registered? You weren’t actually bonded, though. How’d you manage to pull that one off?”
Bro-bonding, apparently. The guys just wouldn't stop talking. Also, Carol is a good bro.

how slack and lifeless their faces are, like lights are on but no one’s home. Or, he thinks grimly, as the warmth of his flames washes upwards, chasing the chill away, like the owners are home, but are tied up in the attic, screaming into their gags.
“I did, thank you JARVIS.” He sets the bag on the counter and starts hauling produce out to wash. He glances out of the window over the sink as he does, squinting at the far-distant horizon. “Is Toni still flying?”
“Well, fuck me sideways,” Clint says. “One of us is finally a grown up. Will wonders never cease.”
Tony slumps back down to the ground, rubbing his temples in tired, concentric circles as he lets his flames die down again. Unexpectedly, a hand settles on his shoulder, and he jerks his head up, swinging around in startlement to meet the approving, satisfied gaze of Magneto himself. Tony’s not sure if that should humble him, impress him, terrify him, or all three at the same time.
, he finally starts typing, opting for the truth,
put you on better footing.”
The fact that a very tall, very intimidating blonde woman woke him and Jemma at five and dragged them out of the building to go on a morning run without so much as a by-your-leave is a definite negative. Fitz likes Carol, but not before he’s even had a cup of coffee. He huffs and puffs along and just wants to collapse back into bed when he’s done, but once he’s had some water and caught his breath, he’s oddly invigorated.
Except… Maybe it’s from Toni. He hasn’t seen her for two days, except to bring her coffee and food, because she’s on an engineering binge and there’s only so long he can sit and pretend to look interested in what she’s soldering together. She likes sending him weird things she finds on the internet on her microbreaks, though, stuff she thinks will make him smile.
touch, this easy affection, from Steve. He slumps against Steve, and if he was the sort to burst into tears, he would, just from the sudden, sure knowledge that he’s not carrying everything on his own anymore, because Steve’s back where he should be.
It’s hard to keep the present separate from the past, and his vision keeps splitting between Toni’s workshop and cavernous facilities with shadowy figures muttering German around him. The pain makes everything blur together, run into each other, bleed between Hydra and Stark.
“Oh, it's totally your name now,” Kamala says in the sort of happy, bouncy tone that always makes Tony uneasy, because it usually means some new rabid corner of internet Avengers fans show up at the Mansion or the Tower in cosplay or with signs displaying their shipping preferences. “Don't worry, Tony. I'll make sure they know it's not a pairing name for you and Ms Grey. Or Mr. Summers either. Just leave it to me!”
fine. She can already tell.
“You don’t,” Tony snaps, and his headache spikes again as loud, belligerent thoughts crash like tidal waves against his laughable mental shields. Fucking hell, how do telepaths
In his cocoon, he wakes in the eye of a firestorm, with the piercing cry of a hunting raptor in his throat.
Natasha doesn’t share her soulmate with anyone. Except Toni Stark. Natasha doesn’t bond with people easily, and it took more time and effort than a saint would have the patience for, but Toni was persistent, never gave up on Natasha, even when Natasha knew she should have.
that. And he’s just fucking stupid for her too. He’s got that stoic Russian I’ll-kill-you-with-my-eyes shit going on, but I can tell.” There’s another pause. “He’ll kill for her, without hesitation. So will I. So will you. I just don’t understand why, with three fucking trigger-happy assassins around her, the world can just reach right past us and knock her on her ass. I can’t wrap my brain around it. We’re supposed to have her back, like she has ours, but how the fuck are you supposed to fight something that you can’t even see coming?”
“Why did you come?”
“Hey, I’m working on it. It’s trickier than it seems.”
It’s a minor thing in the grand scheme, an insignificant detail that nevertheless does nothing but further convince Steve that Schmidt is completely unfit to lead a horse to a trough, let alone an organization of HYDRA’s scope into the bright and bold future.
time, when it’s failed the fifty times before. “You’re pissing away a solid partnership that’s endured for over sixty years. The Stark name was founded on its relationship with the US military, and the men and women in uniform depend on SI technology to keep them alive.”
He flinches, ever so slightly. “I’m never going to forgive Hydra for this,” he says, soft and dangerous.
Steve ignores it and turns the shield over and over and over in his hands.
down, before it escalates past salvaging.
He tells her that little girls shouldn’t play with electronics, because girls are stupid and can’t do engineering, because girls have to have babies and look after their husbands. She runs away from him, crying, and taking solace in her Mama’s lap, Mama's fingers in her hair, and Mama's soft voice calling her
By the time Fitz crawls back to his suite that night, he’s a whimpering mass of paranoia and bruises. The hand-to-hand with Colonel Rhodes wasn’t terrible, except when he got distracted and ended up flying across the ring. He still doesn’t think it was really his fault; he hadn’t known Rhodey (as the man said to call him) was a brilliant engineer until their appointment. He can’t talk shop
Whatever hope she had that he might stop, like Bucky’d done, when he sees her face dies the instant he lifts his head. Ice goes down her spine, because behind the rage, there’s no one home that she ever wants to meet. “Iron Man is a woman,” he says, and hesitates for a moment, confusion warring with something else in his eyes. But they go hard and cold again the next moment. “Doesn’t matter. You killed Peggy. So I’m going to kill you.”
Well, this was a harder chapter to write than I thought it would be. Not a whole lot of action, but other things occur, including the following:
“My head hurts,” Steve mumbles.
Solid ground beneath her feet suddenly, the wooden floor of a dim room lit only by an oil lantern on a table beside a narrow bed with the silhouettes of two people lying curled together under the blankets. She doesn’t consciously move, but finds herself behind the bed anyway, looking down at the mattress. It takes her a few seconds to recognize Steve and Bucky, because Steve is so small he’s practically buried under Bucky, and Bucky… Her breath catches in her throat, because Bucky is much younger, with two flesh-and-bone arms, unlined and unwearied from his years with HYDRA.
Obadiah pushes back from her desk, straightens his tie, smooths out his jacket. “There will come a day when you might come to regret the decisions you’ve made,” he says, and Toni glances sharply at him. There’s nothing in his tone, no promise of violence in his eyes, no smirk, nothing to indicate he’s issuing a threat. Toni resists the urge to roll her eyes. Just more of his useless posturing. “What will you do when the enemy is invading your home?”
But now there’s another voice, a calmer, more rational voice, asking
Natasha stands at the glass wall with her arms folded, watching Clint and Bucky run the obstacle course below. Ostensibly, she’s critiquing their form, and observing the new hard-light tech in action for FitzSimmons, but in reality she keeps getting distracted from noting the glitches and areas Clint and Bucky could use some work because Clint and Bucky aren’t even remotely interested in running the course as it’s meant to be run.
Captain America. The first one, Chester Phillips--”
Rhodey is right on her ass when she exits the plane, and she scowls at him from under the hand shielding her eyes from the sun. “Problem, Colonel Rhodes?” she snaps.
And because she’s her, she immediately assumes her favorite CEO position: slouched comfortably, hands folded across her stomach, feet up on the corner of the desk. It’s not as comfortable as it usually is, because Toni isn’t a CEO that comes to work in a suit and skirts and high heels - she’s more of a jeans and tee-shirt kind of girl, only wears a suit jacket over it to satisfy Pepper’s constant, fond nagging to
Tony eyes the pile of drives, eyes them, eyes the drives again. “So you have,” he says, and uses a finger to stir the various sized drives, eyeing them critically. “Do me another favor and go raid Stark Enterprises while you’re at it. I need better gear than Clint’s sorry-ass laptop if I’m going to do anything with this.”
“Yup,” Carol chimes in. “That’s what I hear too.”
next to the fact that she just took a cup of coffee out of his hand without waiting for it to be placed next to her.
“Sorry, kid,” he says, and grins when he finds the vanishing point in the lines overhead. “As much fun as this has been, I have to see a star-spangled man about a plan.”
It was inevitable, this path, he thinks, smoothing his fingers over the smooth surface of the file folder. He’s been in deep with emerging superheroes ever since Toni Stark came back from Afghanistan with shrapnel in her chest and power armor on the brain. Maybe even since he became Barton’s handler all those years ago. Maybe even since he fell a little bit in love with Captain America as a little kid, constructing and building his life around the ideals and morals Steve Rogers embodied.
for a hero to pull her ass out of the fire, she’ll never hear the end of it.)
Something’s wrong. She recognizes that in a dark, dim corner of her mind. She doesn’t act like this, not this out-of-control. Her pulse is pounding in her temples, her heart is clawing at her throat, her eyes are not focusing properly, her vision is hazing over with red and silver. Something’s
“Not your fault,” she says, and crazily, she sounds like she believes that. She coughs again and clears her throat. “I should have gotten out of bed before you woke up. My mistake, not yours. You with me now?”
Her lungs reinflate with a whoosh, and her head swims with the rush of oxygen as she sucks in the deepest breath she is sure she’s ever taken. Her sinuses burn from the force of it, and her eyes water. “Need softer mats,” she croaks, staring squint-eyed up at the ceiling through the shimmer of liquid.
Toni wants to cry in relief, but settles for sipping the water. It goes down cool and wet, and some of that terrible, cottony pressure disappears. “Then no,” she says, and already her voice sounds much better. “I’m just accident-prone, I guess. Do I even want to know how badly I fucked myself up?”
here since Toni’s mark first manifested on his skin all those long years ago. He risks squeezing her hand gently, and is rewarded when she squeezes back and smiles at him like he hung the moon.
"You're the one who was kidnapped," she mutters.
“... so that’s the deal. A superhero team. Officially put together and everything. Gear, training, a paycheck. Probably action figures and keychains and backpacks with your face on ‘em.” Toni shoves her hands into the rear pockets of her jeans and looks around the room. It’s pretty easy to tell where everyone’s thoughts are by the looks on their faces. Is suddenly sure, just like she knew she would do this, that they’re all in too. Still, she has to give them the choice. “Floor’s open for discussion, debate, dissent, whatever. You can say yes or no. No harm, no foul either way.”
“I’m very sorry, JARVIS,” she says. “I was pretty unappreciative of you this week. I’ll try to be more considerate in the future.”

? “Your
,” she says. “Patch me to Fury, now. … Sir, this is Carter. Abort the op at the Manor. He’s Stark’s soulmate.”
Toni turns back and lifts the shield off the bench, flips it in her palms so the star spins to face down. There are new arm straps attached: the brown leather is replaced with stiff black fabric that glows with blue lines, the same color as Toni's arc reactor. “One of your weaknesses,” she says, “is you can lose the shield. Sure, it bounces back, but that doesn’t happen all the time, right? So I fixed it. I think.”
Anyone else who hasn't kept her tied up for four fucking days straight with contract negotiations that should have been handled by SI’s legal department. She doesn’t care
And she closes her eyes, allowing herself to drift into the grey dark while Rhodey laughs and cries above her, while Clint smooths her hair with shaking hands.
“Good, good,” she says, and turns back to the single holoscreen floating above the workbench. “I’m going to spend my time productively and finish the House Party protocol.” She sucks in a shaky breath, squeezes her eyes closed, crushes down on the utter fury and sheer murderous intentions throbbing at the base of her skull. “I’m going to spend my time productively,” she says grimly, “because if I spend it looking at all the structural damage and bloodstains and scattered weapons and the fucking
“My name is Steve Rogers. My birthday is July 4, 1987. I am a captain in the US Army. I am Captain America. I am the successor to Chester Phillips, the first Captain America. My mother was Sarah Rogers. She died of breast cancer four years ago. My soulmate is Peggy Carter Rogers, and we have been married for three years. I did not serve in World War II. I did not crash into an iceberg. I did not punch Hitler in the face. I was injured in a fight with the villain Iron Man, and suffered amnesia.”
shield. I paid the Wakandan government for it, fair market price with seventy years of interest. Seemed only fair, since it was pretty much stolen from them in the first place. It cost me a fuck of a lot of money, and you seem pretty intent on hitting me with it, so I’m not really inclined let you have it.”
Toni peers at the ceiling with narrowed eyes. “J, you wanna share with the class?”
“Sergeant?” comes Coulson’s voice behind him. “Is everything alright?”
he’s fast, because he’s on her practically before she can blink, bellowing in rage and smashing the shield into her dented faceplate, hard enough that it dents
“Yes, Sgt. Barnes?”
“Knock yourself out, kiddo.”
"Your information is a little spotty, Spangles,” she says, sliding into the rhythm of snark to keep herself focused. “There’s no one here by that name. Iron
involved in what you’re doing so never mind me, my bullshit can wait.”
Steve ducks his head, trying not to hunch his shoulders in discomfort. No matter how many times Toni explains it, or how many times Natasha mocks him for it, it’s disconcertingly like speaking to a ghost, a little too much for his liking. “I was wondering if you had any record of the project I told Toni I’d help her with,” he says awkwardly, and chooses to focus on his aimless linework in order to avoid searching the ceiling for the hidden speakers. “I didn’t get many details out of her before she fell asleep, and I don’t really know where to start.”
She swallows hard against the dryness of her mouth, has to force it down past the heart that insists on hammering in her throat. “No,” she says. “You’re not misreading anything.”
God, he’d welcome a distraction from the gnawing worry and anticipation building. “Let’s hear it, J,” he says.
Bucky’s putting together a sandwich in the kitchen when his phone buzzes with the chime that means he has an incoming text message. He glances quizzically at the counter, where he left it when he decided to make himself something to eat. He pops a few cherry tomatoes in his mouth, and sets the container on the counter to scoop up his phone.
He can hear other small noises in the house, now. Muffled curses and the swish of fabric and the tread of footsteps. Panic gnaws at him for a long moment, and he feels the urge to run and hide in a dark corner. But only for a long moment, because something else is surging, rising, blazing through his head, washing panic away in a bright white nuclear fire.

needed it, it’s the two idiots he’s attached to by the soul. He just wishes — has wished more than once over the last week — that he went with them instead of staying behind to hold down the fort.
“Very good, ma’am. Plotting intercept course.”
She needs better than an animal. He’s not going to hurt her, not again.
“It’s not just about the report, Coulson. She’s impulsive, unrestrained, and arrogant. She threatened to cut ties and break her contracts with us, she assaulted Agent Carter and promised to bring SHIELD to its knees.”
Cold, “With My Mind”
“Good.” Natasha pulls her head down, kisses her forehead, presses her nose into Toni’s hair. “Я рада, что ты жива,” she breathes, then lets Toni's jaw go with an apologetic brush of her fingers. “Though Clint may still murder you. He's undecided.”
He throws his arm up, and it snaps tightly against the bracer. It hits hard, enough to bruise even him, and Steve grunts as rocks him back a little. “That will come in handy,” he says, pulling the shield off the bracer again. Can't help a slight grimace as it jars the sore spot. “If it leaves my arm attached, that is,” he says with a smile.

She may not need a suit to deal with threats, but it sure as fuck is a lot easier. Toni breathes a faint sigh of relief as the armor closes around her, powering up weapons and flight systems. “You two should stay here,” she says. “JARVIS can lock the workshop down after I leave. You’ll be safe here. It’d take a tank to get through those doors.”
? “I uh... I... I did something I didn’t mean to do, and I could really use your help in undoing it?”
is all she has time to think before he’s in her space and she has to duck under an open-handed sweep of his arm. She barely gets clear before his knee smacks into her solar plexus and knocks her rolling across the mats.
Weight hits her back, driving her to her knees. She burns the jets, then abruptly slams the stabilizers, jerking her to a stop. The momentum carries Steve right over her shoulders and flings him off. He twists like a cat in the air, lands on his feet, perfectly set up for a double blast of repulsors. Two more smoking holes appear in his tactical vest, the skin red and raw and smoking beneath as he picks himself back up off the floor.
In between halting non-starts and embarrassed mumbles, Tony finally manages to cajole Steve into clearly stating, “I accidentally tweeted a picture of my penis.”
In the next second, he’s got himself all but convinced that he’s finally gone batshit crazy, because there’s no way Steve Rogers,

Toni cuts him off before he can work up the usual castigating speech. “Well, he’s not,” she says. “And he left everything to me. I know it’s a little hard for you to accept, but the name on the door is
“Always,” Natasha says without hesitation, and her eyes search Bucky's face. Whatever she's looking for, she finds, because she gives him a satisfied nod.
“A really good lawyer and layers on layers of cover-your-ass paperwork. There’s precedent for public soulmates, especially if one partner is a high-profile celebrity.” There’s an odd sound, which Bucky places a few moments later as the sound of Clint scrubbing his hands through his hair. “
The nurse gives him a sympathetic smile that’s sharp around the edges. “I’m sorry, Captain Rogers,” she says. “But Doctor Fennhoff’s left specific directions. You need a shot every four hours, to ease your nausea and the headache.”
In the meantime, I hope the absolute tooth-rotting fluff and flirting in this chapter will tide you over just a little while longer.
“This is undoubtedly the stupidest idea I’ve ever had, J.” She’s not thinking about how he’s not responding. Not thinking about how much internal circuitry is damaged in her helmet. For all she knows, JARVIS might be responding, but her speakers are completely destroyed. Fuck it, she’s been on her own before. She can do it again.
“I do indeed, Captain,” JARVIS says, and a dark monitor across the room obligingly lights up to display a document, written with Toni’s neat, block-letter printing. “I’m afraid ma’am made it about as far as you have before she became overwhelmed and sought your assistance.”
be lucky. I’d have a hell of a lot of fun tearing through their oversized hot air balloon. Now I’m kinda hoping it leads me to the Helicarrier, so I can punch holes in the hull. Maybe that’s something else that’s worrisome. Hey, you’d stop me, right J, if I went all supervillain and started shooting holes in the Helicarrier?”
that I probably get to kill someone at the end of all this?”
Never had the urge to run quite as strongly. Never given into it, until now.
Natasha shrugs and settles against Clint a little more comfortably. “Are non-negotiable. Everyone’s reflexes need work. Без муки нет науки.”
“I really need a raise then.” Rhodey drops an arm over her shoulders, and she curls automatically into his side. “Hazard pay, maybe. You’re a pain in the ass.”
one is pure delight, and it only gets more violent and happier from there.
At least he hasn’t brought up her father yet. Maybe he’s finally learned that Toni does not go all teary and soft when Howard Stark is mentioned. “There are other names in the weapons industry, Obadiah,” she says, flicking a hand at the screen. It scrolls over to a very technically-written request for a lab upgrade, and she squints at it, trying to decipher Mbenga’s cramped, tiny script. “And Stark Industries will still have an excellent relationship with the military. We have no intentions of risking the lives of soldiers, which is why we provide them with tactical armor, medicines and combat-injury care. I am far more interested in providing security and patching soldiers up than I am blowing their faces off, Stane. And I’m a little tired of having this conversation.”
But if there’s one thing Toni cannot call Phil Coulson, it’s
“Do you give a fuck how hot I am?”
By the time Natasha helps her back out of the tub, Toni’s hair is clean and her skin is pink and the heat from the water has seeped all the way down to her bones. She’s practically asleep already as Natasha braids her wet hair and ties it away from her face, but manages to rouse herself enough to dress in an oversized t-shirt and a pair of comfortable pajama pants.

DiNozzo's Bakery, to my best knowledge, does not exist. NCIS was on in the background while I wrote that scene.
He lets Steve lock arms around him, jerk him off course, keep him steady and still with supersoldier strength. “You’re too predictable, Tony,” Steve says, and while there’s a great deal of triumph in his voice, triumph and malevolence, the edges of his thoughts are uncertain, hesitant, cautious, because Tony’s not reacting like Steve expected him to, and it’s throwing him off-balance. “I know you better than you know yourself.”
The stretch of beach is lonely and gorgeous, the sand under the treads of his runners providing just enough resistance to give him a half-decent workout, and the breeze from the sea is equal parts refreshing and counterbalancing to the sun beating down on the top of his head. Even running with other people, it's easy to get swept away in the rhythm of finding his stride, falling into a sort of serenity and peace in his mind that has nothing to do with the brain-wipe machine or the cryo chambers he spent way too much of his life inhabiting.
they whispered, brushing her with cold hands, with cold thoughts, cold words. Cold and quiet.
Even though everything hurts, including her eyes when she opens them.
“Still asleep,” Frigga replied and sighed, leaning gratefully into her husband’s shoulder as he courteously guided their walk. “Heimdall told you?”
It doesn’t feel like much of a victory, but he takes it anyway when Carol’s shoulders slump, her glow fades, and she joins him at the window. “I don’t know if I can trust you,” she says, but all the belligerence, all the fight, has gone out of her voice.
“Hail Hydra,” Carol whispers in his ear, and that’s the only warning he has before her fist impacts the back of his head.
“Wife, we must—”

Bucky smirks. “I’d expect nothing less.”

“You, Fitz,” she says solemnly, “are now my new little brother.” And holds out her fist for him to bump.
“Commander Rogers.” Schmidt always sounds the same, pleased and smug, every time his voice oozes across the channel. “How unexpected. You're outside your standard communication schedule.  Do you have something to report?”
Nothing comes, so he shoves it aside for the moment, bumping it onto its own thought track to percolate as it will. He shoves down his disquiet and unease too, because as he told himself on the Moon, this is not his first amnesia rodeo, and he's bound to have some dissonant feelings and impulses until his brain finishes unscrambling itself.
Obadiah Stane has not taken Toni’s ascension to power with any sort of grace or aplomb, especially when he finally got a good eyeful of just how smart and ruthless and stubborn she really was. “Weapons built your fortune, Toni,” he says, leaning forward on her desk by the tips of his fingers. She wonders if he thinks looming intimidatingly over her will work
The Phoenixbuster fires, and Tony is blinded momentarily by the brilliance of the flare. Before the spots can fully clear from his eyes, alarms start whooping again, radiation warnings and impact alerts, and the backwash of Phoenix fire washes over him, through him, and just for a moment, he's burning alive. It's in his skin, his lungs, his blood, his brain, and he can't breathe, can't think, can't scream.
Rage chokes his throat, steals his breath, his sight. This will never be who Captain America is, not so long as Tony has the ability to do something about it. And he does.
“What can I say, it’s not me, it’s you. Also, it’s your guns.” He sets the Dragunov carefully back down, picks up the Sig Sauer sitting next to it, sits cross-legged on the floor in front of the bench, and starts field-stripping it.
“... and she gives me this look, like I’d just said the dumbest fuckin’ thing she’d ever heard, and says, ‘I’m not drunk, and I’m not twelve. I’m not calling you
It’s abrupt, the shift. She throws a mental switch, changes gear, drops into another track. One instant, she’s the careless, carefree billionaire in tech no one in their right mind would ever think she’s qualified to own, let alone operate. The next, she is focused, tactically-aware and crunching environmental profiles, attack vectors and threat probabilities as fast as she registers them, with the same tech an extension of her body and will. Her mouth might still run free and wild, but her mind is all business. “Any indication they’ve taken notice?”
After a long moment of strained silence, broken only by the shuffle of Clint and Kate and Carol picking themselves up and moving to stand near Lehnsherr behind Tony, Peter Quill exhales shakily, manages to get himself back on his feet and squares his shoulders.
Natasha doesn’t say anything, just sends Toni a look that beautifully combines exasperation and fondness, signs beside Clint’s messy scrawl. When she’s done, Bucky lifts the charter, takes the pen, and turns Toni around and uses her back as a support to sign his name to the bottom. He tosses the pen back to Rhodey, drops the fully-signed charter in Coulson’s lap, and slings his metal arm around Toni’s shoulders. “So that’s that,” he says, and kisses her temple. “Guess we’re a team now.”
“At some point,” Clint says casually, balancing easily with a knee on the windowsill and a foot on the seat, despite the drunken sway of the vehicle, “this will stop happening to us, right?”
Bucky frowns, and unease begins to crawl up his spine. “J, you with me?”
“Amnesia?” Nothing about this is sitting easy. “But I remember my life. I remember being Captain America. I remember everything right up to the plane crash. I remember Project Rebirth and Arnim Zola and…” They’re both shaking their heads, Peggy looking horrified, Fennhoff looking interested. “Did… none of that happen?”

If Peter had been thinking more clearly, he probably would have picked a less public location to test his new abilities, but Peter hadn’t really been thinking very clearly. Which was how he ended up on the ceiling of the gym, staring down at an upside down guy version of his mother.
“Not really,” Steve answered. “I think…I think growing old could be nice, if you’ve got the right people to grow old with.” Tony was silent on that matter. He turned his gaze back to her, and her eyes were intense.

“And I shouldn’t have lost my temper with you in front of 3490,” Steve agreed.
“N—ah! Fine! Fine! Uncle!” female Tony said, gasping for air. “Metallica is the best, Black Sabbath sucks.” Mature Steve, satisfied, finally put her down and stopped his tickle attack. “You’re a low down, dirty rotten—”
“Nope—Francis is. He’s in the garage. I asked Peter to come with us but you know how he has an aversion to fun,” Kate said seriously. As they entered the garage, Francis cheerfully greeted him,

“There are more than 32,000 known species of spider in the world. They are in the order Aranae, which is divided into three sub-orders—Mesothelea, Orthognatha, and Labidognatha. All spiders are carnivorous, ravenous eaters who feed on massive quantities of protein, in liquid form, usually the juices of their prey. Arachnids from each of the three groups possess varying strengths which help them in their constant search for food,” the tour guide explained as she led them around the insect room. Peter took a few shots of some of the spiders—they were all wicked looking creatures, many with bright colors, not at all the kind of spider you saw in the cobwebs back home in the attic. Peter noticed a black widow and took a shot.
“I should have stayed in the sky,” Tony finally relented.
Katie. I really am. For everything.” He left, James’ eyes following him the whole way. When he was gone, Kate buried her head back in the pillow. She felt her brother sit down on the bed beside her. He put a hand on her shoulder blade. She was crying, but she didn’t want to stop.
“Would you care to repeat that?” Bruce asked, a little too calmly.

“Another set of our duplicate selves wasn’t on mine,” Steve said, eying the Tony and Steve from 73837. That version of Tony also appeared to be assisting 3490 Tony and Richards while his Steve looked on fondly.

She was going to grit her teeth through this and she’d have her cry (another one) once he’d left. But he frowned and put his other hand on her other arm.
“Right,” Steve said. “I guess it will be nice to get the whole group together.”
There must have been another mumbled question, as Antonella answered,

“What lies are you telling my little brother?” Francis drawled as he came into the room. He picked Lewis up from James’ lap and set him on his own as he sat on the arm of the couch.

That rang alarm bells in Steve’s head, but for the moment he was willing to believe their story—that they had dealt with this before. Fine. He could give them the benefit of the doubt for the time being. They
“I tried. To get completely drunk in here when they died, I tried. But Steve wouldn’t let me. I told him to fuck off, to let me do what I wanted, my parents were
“Too much detail about your sex life, Kate. I like to pretend you and your boyfriends just hold hands and look at each other with gooey expressions,” Peter said. Kate rolled her eyes.

“And what does you on the run have to do with HYDRA? We thought you were running after that whole Latveria incident,” Steve said, frowning.
“Big Blonde and Buff,” Tony clarified. 3490 Tony snorted. “Triple B. The man that sticks to you more insistently than a shadow.”
this time of year, we could even take Kate and Peter—“
“I don’t like them,” 3490 Natasha confessed to Tony quietly only three days after their arrival. “There’s something off about them all. Something insincere. They’re jumpy.” Tony had learned to trust Natasha’s instincts, but in this instance she just rolled her eyes.

idiots. We HAVE a bigger team! They’re right under our noses and we’ve been too tired to think about it.” Francis struggled to get up as Kate looked around. She jumped on the back of a nearby motorcycle. Francis looked at it warily.
. One part of his mind tried to pull him in the other direction, but a stronger nagging pulled him forward still.
But he couldn’t. He thought about the alcohol he could taste on Tony’s lips. He thought about the
“Oh,” Tony said, blinking for a moment. “That’s not—well, I mean, of course you shouldn’t encourage your underage sister to go to a nightclub and use party drugs but—I’d rather you have gone with her than tried to get her to stay home. Kate’s not exactly one to take direction well. If you had stayed home, she still would have gone and—well, I don’t want to think what would have happened to her if you and Francis weren’t there. Tudo might have called an ambulance—or he might not have, because he was dealing E to a minor who shouldn’t have even been in the club in the first place. So. I guess, please discourage Kate’s risky behaviors when you can but, when you can’t, just—keep an eye out. I think you did fine. Kate’s responsible for Kate—and I’m responsible for Kate—that’s not on you.”
“Well maybe if you’d let me in on your little plan instead of just letting me play Lookout I would have stayed put,” Tony snapped.
,” Fury snapped. Steve did shut up, but he frowned and crossed his arms and chose to stay standing instead, just Fury, Hill, and Coulson were. Tony didn’t mind just rolling his eyes and taking a seat by Pepper Potts.
“Think that’s the whole reason we’re here, Stark?” Natasha asked, joking. “It’s a great cosmic message against superhero marriage?”
At that moment, a professionally dressed woman waltzed inside from the elevator, her arms filled with papers and documents, chattering on about Senator Stark’s responsibilities.
got to you. Bernie despoiled you first,” Tony pointed out. “You got to make all your mistakes with her.” Steve grinned—it was a feral sort of grin, and quickly, entirely unexpectedly, he flipped them over so that Tony was on her back and Steve looming over her. She squealed and laughed at the move. He kissed her—thoroughly—and when he was done said,
“Be that as it may it has no bearing on any of our decisions,” Steve interjected. “Which we need to make now.”
,” Steve said forcefully, so forcefully that Tony was compelled to meet the other man’s eyes again. He looked equal parts grief-stricken and determined, which was an odd expression to have.
“The hell HAPPENED out there?” James roared into the comm. Kate had never heard her brother quite so angry, and that was saying something. He’d gotten angry plenty when they were younger.
“You told me not to get too close, and then my double
Regardless, the Red Skull wanted it, so the bulk of the super human forces, led by the other Natasha, James, and Tony, would use it as bait in a frontal assault while a few of them attacked from behind. Well, behind and inside. Other Fury knew a secret way into the ancient castle (because, Steve understood, knowing all secret passages to anything, ever, but especially ancient castles in foreign countries, was Fury’s whole thing), which Steve, Natasha, Kate, and other Clint would take and look for the space stone. Or take out the Red Skull—whichever came first.
“Are you as bored as I am?” Steve asked a good while later. He was getting dizzy just watching everyone dance.
“Oh,” Tony said, looking a bit less furious but still grumpy. He took another sip of his drink. “Good. I was about to kill Bruce for violating patient confidentiality.”
“Would you like some help?” Steve offered.
“Don’t bring him into this Tony,” 3490 Steve said in a warning tone.
“Yes,” said Maria Hill. All heads turned sharply to her. She put her hands up. “I don’t know who’s behind this. But I knew they weren’t finished with the job. Fury indicated to me that he’d received intelligence from
, but James knew that inevitably he would bump into him. Despite the fact that Tony and his dad worked constantly, it was always James’ bad luck that they were around when he didn’t want them to be. He pushed open the door and entered the mansion.
It only took Peter a second for the thought to occur and a decision to be made. He knelt down next to where Kate still sat cross legged on the floor.
“Not a fetish. Just some friends who would be interested if you were, that’s all,” Steve said.
“But I don’t
Unfortunately, as he was doing his research, the keys stuck to the tips of his fingers. So there was that. He had an inkling that this had to do with the spider that bit him at Oscorp. What had they said about the missing specimen? It was genetically engineered, Peter knew that much, but that shouldn’t affect

“I see,” his double replied. “Of course.”
trying to deal with me dying—it just wasn’t pleasant. But I came out of it…different. Not in my personality, but Steve wasn’t always so chill about the Extremis thing. And then we had an awful day where half a neighborhood and a whole elementary school full of children got wiped off the map because some idiot kids were playing superhero on a reality show… We passed the registration act, but not before a full blown shitstorm between Steve and I. He felt it violated civil liberties,

“But at least we’d be
They had moved into a new safehouse. Peter and the others had been there for a week while the other Avengers ran around trying to get information on their situation. Thus far, there hadn’t been much intelligence. After that first week, James came in through the door with Dad, Bucky, Tasha, Sam, and Clint, sporting crutches and still grimacing when he took a wrong step, but alive. Peter didn’t even know how to describe his relief that James was going to be ok. They would have the chance to fix things.

“Hey! Watch your friendly fire CopyCap—“ Tony started, but then there was a blinding flash and suddenly she was crashing into the ground. Her whole body was jolted by the fall, and she cried out in pain—she’d landed on her back, and now
“I don’t think we have the time to wait until this is wrapped up,” Kate’s voice came in over the comms. He could see her, down on the battlefield, presently strangling a Hydra agent with their own blue gun, riding their shoulders like the world’s most uncomfortable piggy back ride. “Somebody slap that thing on now and fix the damn multiverse before we all collapse in infinite nothingness, pretty please.”
keeps happening,” MCU Steve said, expression dark and concerned. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, James’ father appeared, a wildness in his eyes that James had never seen. He grabbed his double and slammed him up against the nearest brick wall. Apparently MCU Steve hadn’t been the only one to notice his popularity with the AIM agents.
“We’re fine, Senator,” Agent Romanov said. “Thank you for your concern.” Stark just shrugged.
“I really don’t swing that way, Tony,” Steve said. “But you might be right. I
The force and the heat alone could easily have destroyed the armor. Even if it didn’t, the armor can only take so much weight crushing in on it. It can take a lot of punishment, but not a whole damn building. If by some miracle she managed to survive, if the Avengers don’t find and rescue her in three days, she’ll die of dehydration, and that’s assuming that she has enough air in the wreckage to last that long and isn’t sealed in. Point zero one in a million. I don’t trust in faith. I trust in math. And the math isn’t coming out favorably.” MCU Steve shot a glance behind him, Peter guessed at MCU Tony, as he was the one to speak next.
Steve, admittedly, didn’t know
. Had she read the signals wrong? Was he just trying to let her down easy? Was all that talk of waiting until she was eighteen to revisit their relationship just his way of avoiding rejecting her? Was he being an asshole, leading her on, or was he only trying to spare her feelings, hoping that she would grow out of a crush on him? Kate didn’t know and it was driving her crazy and she couldn’t
Peppers.
“James just shut up ok? He’s got a point. We were being rude to our guests,” Kate said, placating. Defiance still flashed in their brother’s eyes. But he didn’t speak further. He just stood.
“This one is for a light in the darkness, Katie. This one is for your mother always being with you, you got that?

Mom and Dad were silent. Peter just stood there and stared with wide eyes, feeling like a complete idiot.
, James,” Peter snapped.
Then, suddenly, his cheek stung. The tingling, sharp pain of it lit up his nerves, and suddenly, he felt his mind slamming back into his body. He touched a hand to his cheek and blinked—Natasha. Natasha was now in front of him. Bucky, off to the side, still had a hand on his shoulder and a look of pure concern—and fear—in his eyes. Steve knew that look. It was the same look he’d worn the first time Bucky had resurfaced, the same look when he wondered
it in a snarky way, but Peter looked pissed off. He put the soup aside.
“M’fine,” Peter mumbled.

“…What?” Tony asked, baffled. Steve blushed.
“Nobody should have that kind of power,” Tony had said afterwards when Thor asked after it. He looked pale and a bit shaken. “I sent it off to the four winds, or whatever. It’s all over.”

“No,” Steve finally responded.
It was low in the ground, clearly meant as some kind of emergency ventilation for the basement. The glass shattered and Kate got on her stomach on the debris-covered sidewalk, peering inside. It was too dark to see anything.

“You—are infuriating. Fine,

. Dad put a hand on his shoulder.
“Two,” Bruce replied carefully. “Brian and Lyra.” His double nodded, keeping his eyes trained on the computer screen.
“So destructive,” 525 Steve said. “Who knew such evil could grow from such a sweet little boy?” 525 Steve released his hand from James’ hair, returning to his shoulder instead as James straightened. James couldn’t help it at this point—a few tears rolled down his cheeks. He had never seen his father look more helpless, but he knew that he would keep him safe. He knew that his dad would get them both out of this. James just had to be patient. His dad would save him.
“—still no visual—” Kate recognized Natasha’s voice, but she didn’t know which one.
“Didn’t study last night and the test is today. Are these the Alts? Dad said something about Alts,” Peter said. He gulped down the spoonful of cereal so quickly Tony didn’t think he could have possibly managed to chew. 3490 Tony nodded.

“Are you pregnant, Tony?” he asked it politely, though Tony was not unaccustomed to Clint Barton asking things rudely. He obviously meant no harm by it, but Tony was startled. She could tell by his sudden wince that Other Natasha kicked him under the table.
as such, to either of us, because she understood the position her double was in,” Steve said. “Seemed to work just fine.”
“Fine,” James said shortly. Clearly he didn’t want to talk. Steve wasn’t sure why he kept pushing, but he felt compelled to do it, compelled to help in some way.
“He left,” Steve said uncertainly. “He left. Do we—do we go after him?

“Jesus, Kate, way to stink up the place,” he’d remarked, which sent Kate immediately to the shower. She was afraid that if her mother caught her she’d skin her alive, even though it was just pot. She’d probably think it was a gateway drug or something.
“If I had to guess, one of the dozens of scientists your mother employs could at least figure out whether or not your cells are still mutating or if you’ve stabilized,” Alt Tony pointed out. Peter shrugged obstinately. He was
“Already, I have the power over space itself. I require only the other stones. The difficulty, of course, was in knowing where they were—and you have so graciously provided all of them for me,” the Red Skull went on as Steve wondered where the hell any of their fliers were. He glanced furtively to where Thor was on the battlefield, the gauntlet covering his hand. The Red Skull tsked like a disappointed school teacher.

“Oh, that’s right,” Pepper said, “he’s your brother isn’t he? I remember your mother mentioned something about another child.”
“As far as their files say, anyway,” Natasha said. “We need to figure out our next move.”
Peter felt sick. Maybe it was the peanut butter and jelly sandwich he’d eaten at Oscorp for lunch—he hadn’t checked the date on the jelly in the fridge when he’d packed it. Maybe it was that spider bite—and that made his heart race. Maybe he should have told the teacher. Maybe he should have gone to the hospital. It could have been venomous. He felt hot and sweaty and
? Steve always had to wonder. They all sat at the kitchen table, gathered there like naughty children caught stealing the cookie jar. Commander Rogers was the only one standing, his hands in fists on top of the table. “Your recklessness—all of you—could have killed us all.”
If the team had been dumbstruck before, they were thunderstruck now. Electrocution at the hands of Thor could not have shocked them more. Peter, however, was calmly carrying on in the kitchen, rooting through the fridge.
close to ordering JARVIS to paralyze them all when they started fighting against the Chitauri. Steve was surprised. And then he was surprised at himself for being surprised. They might not have had the best experiences with other universes, but surely the
“So the takeaway here is that the space stone is lost, and we don’t have any leads on where the hell it is,” Uncle Bucky said bluntly.
“I still can’t believe you married Rogers,” Tony confessed aloud. Antonella grinned.
Steve rarely argued with a lady. He left up the stairs without another word.
“Uh, sometimes,” Billy said. “It’s not—it’s not an exact science, but—“

And, in that moment, Kate realized where she was and what she was really doing. She had a girl pinned beneath her, twisting her already broken arm behind her back in what must have felt like a torturous position. The other girl’s face was beginning to swell. Jeanne did not have super strength or speed or healing. Kate dropped her arm like it was a hot iron and stumbled backward, letting her up. Jeanne stood, wobbling a bit, but her stare was impassive. Satisfied. Kate realized that Jeanne had never wanted a rematch at all. She had wanted this. Even in defeat, she had gotten what she wanted.

“Let him
The street was in utter chaos. There were civilians bleeding on the streets, hit by stray bullets from the onslaught. When the building collapsed, people had come pouring out into the streets. James couldn’t see his sister anywhere; he’d pulled her along the street for a way, but when the hostiles had opened fire he’d lost her. James’ heart pounded in his chest. In any normal situation he knew his little sister could take care of herself, but he was fairly certain she was in shock at the moment—just like their father.
“It isn’t your fault, Tony, and I was wrong to blame you for it,” Steve said firmly. Tony stared at his gadget, obviously still lost in thought, probably unconvinced. But Steve didn’t know what else he could do. He took a sip of coffee, a bit awkwardly.
“Little helpful, Rogers,” Fury admitted. “But one thing you need to know—the Red Skull, just like your new friends, isn’t exactly from around here. He’s tasted the multiverse, and he’s tasted crazy, and he’s only after two things—a new universe order, made in his image, and the death of Captain America.
would always be with him in spirit and this was a reminder. James had been thrilled with the present. He’d worn his father’s tags for months under his clothes until his mother, worried that he would lose them, insisted he keep them at home for safe keeping. She had bought him the little wooden box to keep them in, and they had occupied a prominent place on his shelf for years. He used to keep the top open and grab them whenever he missed his dad, just keeping them in his hand. James knew every groove and divot on those tags. When he moved to New York, he brought the tags with him, but he’d long since stopped opening the box. He kept it on the shelf, out of the way. That was how he dealt with his issues with his father. He kept them out of the way so he could get about his daily life. Coming back to the mansion always meant confronting them again.
“It’s not really news I’d want to give to anyone,” he said glumly. Steve’s hand returned to his shoulder, warm and reassuring.
“Or maybe you could stop
“Shortstuff?” Tony demanded indignantly.
“I know,” Steve said.
Still weird.
There was only one elevator, after all.
“Hell if I remember—”

“Oh, no honey, they didn’t take the bracelet. Here it is, on the bedside table with your clothes. Here, why don’t you hold onto that. Go back to sleep, Kate, all right? We just want you better.”
“Oh, Stark, I think this is a poor time for you to be discussing sticks up asses,” he said, genuinely amused, but Stark only got more mad.
you, Kate Rogers? What are you even worth, all on your own?” Kate dropped the duffel. Jeanne wanted a rematch? She would get it.
you think someone with a cosmic cube might try to teleport you all out of your universe and into mine?” There was silence from the crowd. She didn’t genuinely expect some of them to know—Pepper was probably legitimately clueless, and Jane likely wasn’t any more in the loop, and even some of the Avengers themselves might not know the situation, but she could tell by Fury’s calculated, blank expression that he knew more than he was letting on. After a few moments of silence, Tony continued,

“Jamie!” Kate yelled out. She ran to him, as if to hug him, but then thought better of it and just patted him on the shoulder.
“Excuse me?” Steve demanded.
“Assist would be appreciated.”
She looked at Francis. He looked so upset. If they both died the next day, she at least wanted the air cleared between them. He was her best friend. She loved him. She’d always love him, even if he was an idiot.
“Building on sixth is just

“Good,” 3490 Tony said. She finished off her coffee and stood, heading to the sink to put it away. 3490 Steve walked into the kitchen then, a cell phone in his hand and a confused expression on his face.
“We’re uh, we’re not from the nineties. We’re just a couple of years behind you,” Steve said.
3490 Tony finished whatever she was doing on her tablet, then offered it out to Tony. She shook it a little.
“My turn,” Bobbie said as Tony refilled the glasses that needed filling. “Never have I ever had a devil’s threesome. Regretfully.” This time the only ones to drink were Steve, Tony, and Other Tony (though Other Thor first needed an explanation, which he received from a slightly embarrassed Jane). And once again, while no one seemed surprised by either Tony’s participation, all the Alts stared at Steve.
Bucky wouldn’t mind though. Bucky would laugh and tell him that only
“You see that mall over there? Meet me at that entrance in five minutes with your team. Anybody not there gets left behind, you hear me? Kate and I are going to find the others,” James said.
“Of course it is, Agent Giggles,” Stark said, rolling his eyes, “but I’m not about to tell anybody, you know, and I highly doubt anybody is going to try and murder me on my own plane unless Pepper’s done a terrible job at hiring pilots, and Pepper never does a terrible job at anything.”
“I don’t think your argument was petty, Steve, and neither do you,” Natasha said, ever the voice of reason.

Maybe that was grief, truly, James thought. Not the sharp agony, the shock of someone’s death, but the slow, persistent reality of life without them.

broaching. He just knew that all topics involving any kind of Tony these days were difficult to have. There was just no getting past the weirdness of their situation. At least, not for Steve. As ever, Tony appeared to be handling things with a cool head, an easy attitude, and a few inappropriate jokes. Tony just raised an eyebrow at Steve’s gentle conversation starter.

“Groundrules?” James asked his father. A select team from the Academy, the MCU Avengers, and Peter’s mother and father all stood in the vast gym created especially for the Avengers. Located in the Avengers Academy, Peter knew that this gym was the one his parents used whenever they needed to practice as a team as well. It was the size of a large warehouse (which it had previously been) and outfitted with all of his mother’s best tech—holographs that you could touch, feel, and manipulate like real objects, programmed scenes and scenarios that had outcomes entirely dependent on the players’ actions. He’d told his mother that she should get into the video game business once, but she had just rolled her eyes. She didn’t want anyone messing with her tech who might do something less than well intentioned with it, and that meant not releasing it for public consumption. Peter understood that, even if he still really wanted to play
“You’re a smart man, Tony, I’m sure you can figure it out. Good pseudo night to you,” he said, and then he walked away. Of course, Tony knew that the lab was still guarded—JARVIS probably had orders to alert the Captain to any attempted break-ins—so Tony headed back to his room, his head reeling.
Steve didn’t realize he was walking to the living room until he found himself seated on the couch. Natasha came to sit beside him. She regarded him with that look that Steve knew meant she was making quick decisions about what approach to take in their upcoming conversation. Natasha was never out of tact.
“Oh, what the hell,” Tony replied. And that was how Pepper found them in the morning practically drunk on sugar and exhaustion and giggling about science and memories only Tonys could understand.
“Well, your Steve might indeed be a little white bread and vanilla,” Antonella conceded. Tony wondered if he shouldn’t think of her like that. If he thought the name, he might

“And her punishment is?” 3490 Steve asked.
“Yeah, whatever, just don’t slip into a coma and die on me,” Tony said. He left the room and shut the door behind him.

“And… Well I just wanted to know more. About the circumstances. Because—well—we can all do the math. You said you’ve been married for ten years but your kids are sixteen. So it probably wasn’t ‘for the poor children’ that you decided to go with it. So I’m just—I’m trying to understand why you would marry him. I know you said it was because you love him, and I get that, but…I’m just looking for the turning point, I guess. Because you had kids with the guy, clearly you loved him long before you agreed to marry him. So why six years later?” Other Tony asked.
“Strictures on my lightning?” Torrun asked.
—an old, abandoned gym would be the perfect place for them to begin work on their time machine. The Avengers could easily claim they preferred the privacy of their own space to work out, and it wouldn’t be unusual for them to train every day. They could put the equipment they needed in a gym, and start their work on going home. This whole day might not be the horrible defeat it seemed to be; they could work themselves out of this mess.

Tony panicked momentarily. Usually, in the presence of Steve no one asked him for ideas, unless they were tech related. But this? This was strategy related and unless someone didn’t think of something quick, that suit would get close enough to take them all out—three people didn’t hide so well behind a single shield.
Ok, bad timing.
“If someone sent us here,” Other Steve said, “then they wanted us gone. Someone’s plotting something, and you’re saying we’re stuck here for a year?”

“All right boys, let’s go get that flag,” he said. No need to run anymore—they walked all the way into the Alts’ territory, James merely reminding Torrun to keep Thor distracted. They grabbed the flag and ran back to their own designated area. A bell rang, and the scenery disappeared.
“Just couldn’t resist staying and listening, huh, Giggles?” Senator Stark said. Steve raised an eyebrow.
“She’s in the shower,” Pepper answered her doppelganger. “I’d imagine she’ll be out soon.”
“Rogers?

next to them. He was older than their son, maybe by a decade or so. “Oh! And thanks, Tony—your jerry rigged portal in that gym was the only nearby portal in New York. Other one’s in Toronto. Really didn’t want to hoof it back here from Canada. You really didn’t have to do that in secret but your understandable paranoia sure came in handy for me.”
“Thank you,” James said sincerely, then grabbed Francis, heading upstairs. Francis followed him, looking worried, more worried than James was. “Hey man, take it easy, we’ll find her. She’s probably just making out with that Tudo dude, no big deal—”

“They’re on a mission in Japan,” Natasha supplied.
“I don’t know,” he admitted. “Telling me what you’ve done with my dad and Tony would be a good start.”
“Ma’am?” Other Steve inquired. It wasn’t a concerned tone, more a prompting one. Tony wasn’t used to that, and she wasn’t used to the formality, and all she wanted in that moment was her husband.
“I didn’t find much,” Natasha admitted. “Something about Earth 616 spying on them—how they figured out the whole multiverse puzzle in the first place. Something about Earth 1610 coming for a visit—it didn’t sound particularly pleasant. There were a couple of other universes mentioned, nothing particularly noteworthy,

“Aw, come on, big guy, if you’ve got to get mushy with somebody it might as well be me, you don’t have a therapist in this world,” Tony needled.
“Would that be for amputees?” he asked. Tony looked up, startled. Steve wondered if Tony had forgotten he was there.
They chatted a bit more through dinner. Torrun caught him up on
So, yes, Kate was having problems, and Peter was acting weird, and James was having his usual issues, and there were eight extra pairs of eyes in the house watching their every move, but Tony didn’t
It was absolute chaos outside. Kate couldn’t believe that they were duking it out in the middle of Times Square. SHIELD hadn’t been able to contain everything—they were too busy trying to evacuate civilians—so they had called on the B team, the nearest source of aid. Where her father was she didn’t know—presumably off somewhere doing something to help find the infinity gauntlet. At least, Kate hoped so. After her mom, it was difficult not to contemplate other possibilities, but she tried not to dwell on it.

“No, Happy’s taking
“Nah,” Antonella replied, and Tony looked up at her in confusion. “Not more. Just sooner.” She finished her second glass. “You all are just starting out, Tony. But that means you’ve got years and years ahead of you to work it all out.” She picked up the bottle. “Sure you don’t want any?”
“Of course,” he said.
“So what are you going to do, pop silly string in there?” Tony asked.
“Your superior officers treating you ok?” Steve asked.
they’ve been honest this whole time, they’ll send us back, no problem.”
“Yeah, thanks, helpful,” he said. He flipped up the hood of his black sweatshirt and then headed off—but he paused just before he left and turned around. He looked at Tony, and the look was so pained, so humiliated, that Tony felt a bit of second hand embarrassment for the kid. “Look, just, don’t say anything to my parents, yeah? I’d appreciate it.”
, Tony, this is her
,” Pepper insisted. “They still do. And if they were planning to kill us, they wouldn’t be planning to kill us here, in front of their children.” Steve felt a wave of gratefulness to Pepper wash over him, even as the others still looked dubious.
“Tony, no.”
“What was it like to be frozen?”
“What do I
After a few hours, they’d run just about every relevant test they could think of. They’d tried force tests, to see how much Peter could hold before slipping off a surface—they hadn’t had enough weight for him to hold, but ended up with an estimate of several tons per finger.
“I’m picking up some very odd readings—I’ve never seen this before,” he said, turning the clear tablet towards her so that the readings appeared. As Tony looked them over, she felt a large twinge of annoyance and a smaller twinge of dread.

,” Peter insisted. 3490 Steve couldn’t argue with that, so he took a bit of his pancake instead. A moment later, mother and daughter reappeared in the doorway, both looking infuriated.
Oh, God. More drama. Peter knew those voices—Torrun, and then Kate. He didn’t know what they were talking about, but he had a niggling feeling it might have to do with the chilly atmosphere between Kate and Francis these days. He wondered.
me there.
So as James put his hand to the handle of the door and walked into the mansion for the third time in four weeks—a record, James figured, since summers in high school—he felt himself stiffen, felt a knot in his gut forming. He wasn’t even here to see
“Uh… studying,” Peter said. He had large, wide brown eyes.
“It would be better if I weren’t missing half of what I need,” he said, “and having to thus start from scratch.” Tony rubbed his forehead. “Dr. Foster has made a lot of headway but I can’t focus on the technical side of things until I know what universal equations we’re working with. So I have to help her on that before we can really get to

“My political preferences have nothing to do with the way I conduct my job,” Steve said. Stark grinned.

Several explosions went off, but they hadn’t gotten all of the guns. Kate kept moving. She could hear the Red Skull facing off with the other Steve but didn’t have time to stop and look. She nocked another arrow as she ran, aiming for one of the guns that was still left. She rolled out of the way as it shot at her; the arrow she’d loosed unfortunately got caught up in its blue light and disintegrated. She nocked another, loosed, another, loosed, all while running and rolling. She assumed, based on what she was hearing, that Clint was doing the same on the other side of the room. Finally, her fourth arrow made contact with the gun, exploding it and taking out the threat.
“Ok, I’m not crazy, you really said that,” Mom said, more to herself than Peter.
bomb,” Tony said.
? Steve was saying something in her ear.
“Why, did you drug it?” Peter asked. Though it was obviously a joke (or so James figured, anyway) there was no humor in his voice. It was like all the emotion had been wiped away from his little brother, leaving nothing but a shell behind. James wanted to go back to the gym and punch the damn bag until it split open and bled sand all over the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s your rematch,” Kate snarled. “I won.” Bruising was already beginning to form around Jeanne’s eye where Kate had sucker punched her earlier, but the other girl just smiled blandly.
“Yeah. Yeah I’ve got that. Thanks Tony. Merry Christmas,” he said. He left the lab after that, breathing deeply and staving off the waves of emotion he was experiencing. This was no time to get weepy. Kate had cookies to bake. Christmas depended on it. With that ridiculous mission in mind, James headed to the kitchen. Better a ridiculous mission on his mind than everything else.
. They just don’t get it.”
“Sorry,” Steve apologized. “I just—are you doing ok?”
“Around that time I was looking into some old HYDRA files. They’d been quiet a while and quiet is never a good sign—usually means they’re plotting something. I didn’t like it,” Fury said. “I decided to check into it on my own. Picked out a few of their old hide outs. I sent some of my guys in. Nobody around here reported anything odd, but my contact in Germany said they’d hit on some strange activity in a
“Oh,” he said, caught completely off guard. Bucky was such a private thing, these days. No one he knew anymore knew the name, knew about Steve’s life before D.C., before becoming a Special Agent. “Yeah, it’s a nickname but—where did you even get that from?”
“He comes to bother me and Torrun,” Kate said.

“So if we don’t have the technical basis down, what’s that over there? What have you started building?” Steve asked, indicating the bunch of metal scraps and circuits and wires in the corner, some of which had been cobbled into the semi-recognizable shape of an archway.

she was doing this? You heard the doctor, he said this is probably a repeat offense—how could we have missed this?” There was a long pause, and Tony could hear his own heartbeat, could feel his stomach sinking in horrible empathetic anticipation. He almost wanted to scream at his double,

sick. His head spun. He was off the couch and running to the bathroom before he’d even realized what he was doing. He could hear the voices of his not-parents calling after him in alarm. The door to the bathroom was closed—the younger kids and Francis were waiting outside it.
“I only did what any of my boys would have done,” he said. “What was right.”
Torrun? Is there some sort of universal directive? Some kind of
“It’s not the first time she’s caused us a bit of trouble,” Tony said. She drummed her fingers on her desk. “Watch her. I want a full report and then your professional opinion on what should be done with her.”
“I think so. I think I’ve aged. Maybe a little slowly. I’m not as handsome as I used to be,” Steve teased. Tony snorted.
“I uh—it’s nothing,” Steve said. “Just uh—”
“Tasha,” Clint spoke softly. She was wound tight, and Clint had no idea how to unwind her. It had been bad from the start, but Clint knew that it had gotten worse after her mission to the Triskelion five days ago. Seeing her double had shaken her up, even if she wouldn’t tell him that. He couldn’t blame her—it was
Steve was not in a good place. He knew that. He was holding on for the sake of his children, and for the sake of the world. Captain America, Commander Rogers, could not fall to little pieces in the middle of a crisis. So he channeled his grief into determination. He
“Come with me. Now,” Tony ordered. Steve was caught so off-guard that he obeyed without a second thought. Tony marched to the hotel’s front desk. He held out his credit card. “Give me a room, please. Whatever you’ve got.”

Chapter 65: Saturday, December 3, 2016
and you didn’t know what I wanted? Never figured you’d have a power fetish, Rogers,” Tony said, highly amused.
“I guess there are some things you can’t google,” Steve replied. Stark laughed.
“Let’s stay optimistic. The Avengers should show up before the three days have passed, and hopefully they’ll sort this whole mess out. If it starts looking like they’re not going to show, we’ll make plans,” James said. Azari gave him a long look, but he nodded. Soon enough, just as James had said, the door appeared. It had an old-school number code lock, which then prompted a retinal scan. James blinked rapidly as it finished and the lock clicked open. He set Lewis down and opened the door. “Everybody in!”
field ready even if you’ve been avengering out in your own world.” Steve had no words with which to argue the young girl as she stared at him with that challenging expression. She was a force to be reckoned with. Steve was still trying to formulate some sort of response when an alarm sounded.
“Tony, we found her, Kate had her, get out of there,” Steve commanded. He didn’t like this. He didn’t like that she wouldn’t tell him exactly what was wrong. She was quiet over the comm. for a moment.
“What do you think?” she asked. “A thousand things, starting with Steve. He was thrilled and crushed in the span of about sixty seconds when I told him—thrilled I was pregnant, crushed that I was set on terminating the pregnancy. He tried not to show it. He tried to be supportive. He held me when I cried and assured me that I wasn’t an awful person.” She smiled at Tony, a bit wryly. “I know Steve, though. I knew how he felt about it. But nevertheless he came with me to the clinic and held my hand while we waited for the doctor to call me to the back while I was just hoping against hope that no one would recognize us and try to snap a picture—conveniently this was before cell phone cameras had really gotten off the ground, otherwise I’m sure someone would have.
“Keep your friends close and your enemies closer,” Tony replied cynically, but he had to admit that Steve’s trust was winning him over. Steve turned that smile onto him again and Tony’s heart did a flip and
“I’ve got a strict no ditching family rule,” Dad said, amused. He turned back to James. “Did you want to leave and do something else? This is our day with you James, we don’t get those often. We want to do something you want to do, right guys?”
“Yeah, sucks for all of you—got stuck with the shitty Tony again,” Tony mumbled.
But Tony couldn’t sleep. Even when the blankets were warm and snug around him, even when all the lights were out (minus the ever present one on his chest, of course), even when he could rest easy, knowing that discussing with the other avengers the topic of the weird universe they had landed in could wait for another day, Tony still couldn’t sleep. Gently he slipped out from under the covers and quietly left the room.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You know all that. I just—” Tony broke off. He couldn’t find the words. Where were the words for
to divulge sensitive information?” Dr. Banner asked, an eyebrow raised. Tony smiled.
“Look—Tony—shouldn’t we—do I need to apologize for something?” Steve asked. And that, really, was what brought Tony up short.
“You left the alts with the
“You said it right before you passed out. You asked us where he was,” Stark said, looking at him intently now.
,” Tony’s voice broke through Steve’s thoughts just as he smashed an agent’s face in with his shield. Steve saw what Tony was referring to—far deep through the enemy ranks from where Steve was positioned, and it was beeping faster and faster. Steve really didn’t want to find out what happened when that thing blew.
“Well, highly trained super-soldier crazy girl, yeah, she had me,” Tony said, scowling.
and that—that is
“Look, I promise I’m not going to rat you out to your parents just—
“All right. You just seem—anxious,” Steve spoke cautiously. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose with his good hand.
“Here, just take mine,” Other Jane Foster spoke up, approaching Tony. She rolled up her long sleeve to allow Tony access. Other Jane looked very similar to Jane, Tony noted—except for the fact that she was at least fifteen years younger. Tony fastened the tie around Other Jane’s arm, ever aware of Thor looming nearby and watching with a careful eye. “What do you need it for, anyway?”
“ONE!” James yelled—and suddenly everything behind the purple barrier vanished. All of the soldiers were gone, along with a few unfortunate boats. The young avengers all cheered.
“Nothing,” her double murmured. “Nothing at all. Thanks for uh—thanks for the explanation.” He got up and left. Tony watched him go. She wished she had more energy to dissect his motives, but she really didn’t. She opened up her e-mail again, now further behind than she had been when she started as new messages had poured in. Such was her life.

the time you needed down here—really, I see no downsides—“

“Why?” Kate asked. “Class is over.” She slung the strap of her purple duffel over her shoulder and stood up.
“We’re…what?”
“Ok, yeah, very impressive and all—get over here quick I need your hand,” Tony said. The Captain frowned.
“That’s—yes,” Steve heard Bruce sigh.
received a special invite had arrived in the room, eager to watch. Well, Peter thought they must be eager to watch, but many of them watched the second team with bored or even annoyed expressions. Peter had no idea why—but he was sure he would find out. This was, after all, to be his first day at Avengers Academy, moved up a few days—and so far, it was off to a great start.

“I expect so, if it’s anything like our Safehouse Three,” Agent Coulson said. “Expansion might be advisable.” There was a tense pause, though Agent Coulson for one looked as unflappable as usual. James couldn’t even see a single soot stain on his suit. Pepper looked terrified; her high heels dangled from her hand, long since removed. Jane looked exhausted, resting her head against Thor’s chest as he ran a hand through her hair. Agent Hill’s usually perfect bun was a mess, and she had a long cut across one cheek. MCU Bruce looked like he was doing his best to stay calm. MCU Steve, Clint, and Natasha were all in various states of disrepair. They were exhausted and worn out and James knew, looking at them, that not a single one of them would fight him on this. If he turned them away, they would walk away, weary and defeated, without ever raising a hand to him. Ultimately, though, it was looking at MCU Tony that got to him. Being a guy, he didn’t look a thing like the Tony he knew—except in the eyes. The eyes were the same. And those eyes were tired. If James turned them away now, weaponless, homeless, and friendless, it was practically a death sentence. Maybe he could have given that death sentence to the rest of them. But he wasn’t about to be the reason another Tony died that day.
“Not that we haven’t loved having you all here,” 3490 Steve said, only a single step behind his wife, “but we
His dad had stopped in front of the doorway when they’d gotten there. He’d just stared, for a moment, up at the monolithic doors. It was a moment that was too long, that went into the territory of uncomfortable, and just as it crossed that line, Peter joked,
inkling that this was going to happen? Start on the left and move to the right.”
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Yes?” he said. “And? Am I supposed to consult you now, before I go out, Dad?” Steve wrinkled his nose and made a bit of a face. He couldn’t help it.
“A HAND WOULD BE GOOD!” Kate yelled at her father through the comms as she ducked behind James’ expandable shield before a Frost Giant hit them with a spell of ice.
“No, no, Tony, it’s not that,” James said, feeling choked with emotion. “It’s—you made this for me?”
“Ugh, can we please talk about something else? I’m with Kate on this one,” Peter said, pulling a face.

do other than bloody his knuckles on an old punching bag. He showered quickly—it was five minutes, tops—and headed back upstairs to face everyone else.
The bruise on his chest was gone. He’d broken the handle on the sink. He’d also destroyed his alarm clock and squirted the mirror with toothpaste, but the sink was the hard one to fix. He’d had to shut off the water main—hoping no one happened to be showering—and then weld it back on because he had actually snapped the metal. He’d never seen Kate or James do that. Then he’d had to mop it up, get dressed, and do a bit of research, because this was
. The Master Spy couldn’t manage to send a single message? Fury made a face, like Steve was the dumbest person on the planet.
“James,” Steve said calmly, soothingly, “what can we say? What proof can we offer you?” James eyed him suspiciously.
He laid awake for a long while on that bed that night, and his father did as well, before they each drifted off to sleep. And before that moment came to pass, James thought to himself that he’d never felt closer to his father than he did just then.
“Steve?”
“Oh my God, Peter, I’m going to be late, just
“They scare
“Finding you a costume. You said you can stick to walls now, right?” Kate asked.
“So what, we’re going to use Steve as bait?” Tony had demanded of Fury when they’d discussed the plan. “Use what the Red Skull wants to lure him out?”
This was the last chapter I wrote before I took a break that was years long; this is the last thing that was written in the 2014/15 era.
“If you think it’s best,” he said. “Are we agreed? Jane, Pepper, are you ok with this?”
“I like her better,” Francis said. “Also she snagged the tickets, so.” Well, James couldn’t argue with the last one. Or the first one, really. He took the back and, as soon as they were safely out of the vicinity of the house, Francis cranked up the music so the whole car shook. They danced in their seats and sang badly the whole way there.
“Woah, ok,” James said, wrapping his towel around his waist. He walked over to Peter and patted his back gently as Peter coughed and heaved violently. “Easy. Don’t hurt yourself.”
“MOVE!” Steve shouted, but before Tony even knew what was happening two hundred and forty pounds of muscle slammed into him, shoving him to the side just as a driverless semi-truck barreled right over the spot Tony had been squatting over. Apparently Clint and Natasha had fared only just as well—cars whizzed past, some of them running up on the curbs and crashing into buildings in their frenzy to run down the 199999 Avengers. Tony was incredibly grateful for the fact that the Hulk was in anther sector; he had been busy taking down a Leviathan. Tony had no idea where Thor was. Tony could see Clint leaping out of the way as two cars crashed into each other, right in the spot he’d just been standing in. Steve was running with Tony, moving him out of the way as they both tried to keep an eye on the team and also take shelter from the cars. Clint drew his bow and loosed an arrow—3490 Cap roared in fury as he rolled out to block the blow with his shield.
to come back. Thing is—tomorrow’s Christmas Eve. And I don’t think he’s coming back.” Tony didn’t know what to say to that, so he said nothing at all. Antonella laughed, but it was humorous. “You know, funny thing—our first kiss was at Christmas. Well, our first

—except for the fact that there were a few triceratops wandering around and one particularly vicious T-Rex. At least, Kate thought it was a t-rex. It looked like one, but she wasn’t an expert. She was sure she would call it a Tyrannosaurs Rex and then later be corrected by Peter, ever the nerd, with some obscure and unpronounceable name that the creature

“It doesn’t feel right, Tony,” he said.
“—breathe—“
“All of you could be dead if James hadn’t left. And James would be dead if you hadn’t slowed his fall off that rafter, if you hadn’t used your web to stem the bleeding, or if you had left him in the warehouse or in that tunnel alone. You saved him, Peter. It was his choice to leave that bunker, not yours,” Steve said. “Blaming yourself isn’t going to do anybody any good. If anybody’s to blame here it’s me. Leaving all of you in that bunker was a bad call. And before that—“ Before that, Steve should have taken care of his son. He should have done more to repair their relationship. He’d been told in clinical tones the exact content of James’ outburst by an overly calm (and thus, furious) Bruce. But there were some things you didn’t burden your children with. “—Before that, there was plenty I could have done to prevent this situation. Plenty I
Unless he wasn’t coming. Tony wondered if he’d gotten word of her plot, had heard that her order for the party to begin at four had been returned to six. She wondered if he was just planning to show up late in the evening regardless of when the party began. Tony wasn’t sure, but the possibilities made her anxious. Nevertheless, she would stand there, she resolved, until six o’clock when her duties as hostess began.
was really the sum of it. She didn’t feel like having her heart repeatedly stomped on after everything that had already happened. But she’d never seen Francis look so miserable in her life, and if this
“We have to trust them. For everyone’s survival,” James said quietly.
For a while, they sat in silence, Kate sipping her coffee and Clint chugging his. He got another cup, sat down again, but this time he didn’t guzzle it down. He looked at her for a long moment. Kate shot back a raised eyebrow at him. Clint made a sign that Kate well recognized, but rarely saw from him:
“Oh, gee, thanks, Kate,” Peter said. “I hadn’t thought of that one. I hadn’t tried that one a thousand times over.”
He couldn’t lie, even if he’d done it for the right reasons and
“No, go do your homework
“I think we’ll head out now, too,” she said, speaking for Bucky, Sam, and Clint as well. The Commander blinked and started to stand.
They sat, still watching the news. The kids were doing fine—but they were getting hit hard out there. Steve couldn’t help but wince as a camera caught James getting socked on the jaw by a man in some futuristic-looking armor.
. And Kate? Christ, what were you thinking just cutting and running on her? On any of us?” James asked.
Not any of the rest of your team, not me, just
“Ugh, no. That sounds like the least appealing thing ever. I do not want to associate chocolate cake with raspberry sauce with the
“Romanov, as usual,” Tony said. “Can’t trust that one further than you can throw her, of course. Well. Actually, you might be able to throw her quite far. Me in the Iron suit as well, but you get my meaning. She’s the only one I see presenting a real threat at the moment, other than, perhaps, your counterpart.”

“In this recombination lab, we use synthesized transfer-RNA to encode an entirely new genome, combining genetic information from all three spiders into these fifteen genetically designed super-spiders, the first mankind has ever produced,” the tour guide said. She was clearly proud of their work, and Peter had to admit, he was impressed. Inter-species genetics was a ridiculously complicated field.
“I—I’ll lose my nerve if I do—ok, look, here I go—ok, so that field trip? To Oscorp? Uh, something…weird happened there. Really weird. And uh ok IgotbittenbyaspiderandnowIhavespiderpowers.”

should have tried to see things from her side sooner. I shouldn’t have shut her out the way that I did. Was I always so horrible to her?” Steve turned to Natasha, feeling his stomach clench painfully.
“All right everybody—it’s good to see you all again, well and happy and together. That’s one of the many things we have to be thankful for today. And seeing as it’s Thanksgiving—well, you all know the drill. We’re going to go around before we eat and everybody’s going to say something they’re thankful for. Be quick about it or the food’s going to go cold, yeah?” James said, earning a few chuckles. “All right. I’m thankful to be here, with everyone at this table, for one more year because every year—and every day—is a gift. Ben?” Ben smiled and gave his answer—he was thankful for his dissertation supervisor, who was looking over his project every step of the way and helping him through it. They made their way down the table. Most of the older kids had an answer prepared and were quick about it, but no one begrudged little Nicole Barton, only four years old, as she blushed and said a lot of ‘ums’ and took a while as Kate, sitting next to her, tried to prompt her and help her through it. Finally they finished up with Torrun, who was grateful for the good health and safety of all of Asgard, her other home. When James announced, “Dig in!” no one hesitated. Well, no one but Torrun, who twirled her fork in the mashed potatoes but didn’t take a bite.
“She’s married,” Pepper said in a voice so low it was nearly inaudible.
,” the Captain repeated emphatically. “Get off the roof.”
Conjuring his new super strength, Peter grasped the edge of the shelf on his leg. He took a breath and then lifted up, his back, shoulders, and abdomen all engaging, bringing it up. If he wasn’t so tired, it would be easy, but as it was, it was torture. And as he lifted, his leg only hurt more.
“I’m not vegetarian,” Steve said, watching the rambling senator with interest.
“Daddy’s a hypocrite,” Lewis said solemnly. Francis made a face at James.
“Maybe,” Kate said, “but that doesn’t matter. Because you won’t tell him. Because then you’d have to tell him that you
They laid in silence for a bit longer before Kate finally got up.
, Pepper completely sympathized with the tone of her double’s voice. Double Pepper was well dressed, as Pepper expected her to be. Pepper was jealous of the heels she wore (Louboutin, no doubt), and impressed by the perfection of her chignon. There was only one real, marked difference Pepper could see between herself and her double—and that had to do with the diamond ring on her finger.
Whatever. In her world it was T-Rex.
would be grateful for the knowledge, but the other Steve wasn’t him. Not really. He’d had life experiences that Steve hadn’t and wouldn’t. He’d known his wife for nearly thirty years—maybe he
“It’s our best shot, Captain,” Tony said apologetically. “This tech—look, I’m a genius but I can’t hack it. Better to just shut off the power supply. It would take me days, weeks, years—hell I don’t even know—to crack it, and if we can’t shut that portal—“
“3:43, sir. You have been up for nearly 34 hours.”
Realizing he’d be spotted if he didn’t move, he took the moment that they weren’t liplocked to enter the room. His dad’s face brightened significantly, and for one simple second, Peter forgot that he was mad at him. The man looked absolutely beat, but he’d tried his best to look energized when his son walked in. But Peter couldn’t get that kiss out of his head. Steve Rogers had a boyfriend! One he was serious enough about to mention, and hope to bring about the Avengers and cheating with Tony Stark was no way to go about love.
With that in mind, it was still important to note that today was an outlier. No Tony, no Steve, no Thor, Bruce, Nat, or Clint… he was alone. And a ninth grader he decided he’d take it as a badge of honor. A testament to how as newly indoctrinated high schooler, he’d not only be ready for responsibility, but kick its ass. Considering everyone in his immediate vicinity had saved the world at some point or another, Peter was kind of delegated as everyone’s son. And therefore, babied by every man, woman, and child who entered the tower. He was pretty sure even Carol’s cat was under strict instructions to protect Peter with his life.
Thor’s eyebrows knitted together as he looked down at the box in hand. “Oh.” He said sadly. “Then I shall get all of them!”
“Clint, we have the world’s best comms at the tower, let’s just go.” Steve rationed. But he knew he was fighting a losing battle almost immediately. Clint pouted, and he just sighed, “fine, let’s just make it quick.”
“Not unless I got detention without realizing.” He responded. Tony again looked at him like he’d grown another head.
Peter argued. Complained. Exaggerated, and even faked a cold, but still, no dice. Tony called Happy and Happy drove a petulant Peter to school like they had reverted to his elementary days. Either out of spite, worry, or a beautiful mixture of the two, Peter hadn’t paid attention to a single thing in class. People approached him, questioned him, nagged him about what happened but much as he had his entire life, he didn’t give much up. He was lost in his own thoughts. Much like New York, he had almost lost his dad that night.
“What? JARVIS, what time is it?”
“fine, fine! All I’m saying is no matter how cool this guy is---- you have to be on my side. Okay? You’re my dad first and Steve’s friend second.” Peter joked. But Tony turned rather serious. He inspected Peter like he was an equation he hadn’t quite solved yet, and with no sarcasm dotting his words said “Of course, Peter. You know you’re first.”
Tony sighed and pushed back in his chair, taking his mask fully off. He rubbed his eyes with his hands, and leaned forward on the table Peter had just set his stuff onto. Sure, he was supposed to be thinking about Ray Bradbury in English class today, but he had finally come up with a solution for that pesky little ‘flammable’ issue on Clint’s newest batch of arrows.
It had been just about a week since the events of Oscorp. When exams were over and school released for the winter break, peter found it increasingly difficult to dodge a person that he lived with. He’d entertained Clint to as much as he could take, practiced Russian with Nat till he had his заполнить, and even essentially third wheeled a few Thor and Bruce dates. He’d still frequent the lab, but his father and his own work went about relatively quiet. Tony asked if there was anything bothering him, and he simply said no. Tony asked if he was freaked that he had almost died, and Peter said no again. Steve picked up on the difference almost immediately, and not a day went by where Steve didn’t ask ‘you doing alright?’ in that soft, confused voice that Peter no longer trusted.
” He cooed, a bit childishly. “Who is she? Or he? Or them? I gotta admit, I don’t actually know your type.” He seemed to be the only one excited about this revelation though, and felt a little out of the loop at that. Peter told Steve about the girl who had smiled at him in the lunch line once in middle school, and about the boy whose hand had brushed over his in chemistry once---- it was kind of disheartening this was the first he was hearing about a ‘good friend’.
“Well, funny you should ask…” Steve said, almost giddy. He looked like he was about to pull out a comically large cake and have his boyfriend jump out with confetti, but no, at the table it was just Tony, Steve, and Peter.
“Thor, put that back!”
Tony lost his grip on his tool and the sound of metal hitting the floor resounded. That was weird, Tony was famously known for his steady engineer hands.
Steve’s head snapped back up to meet his eye line then, and if Peter hadn’t said the words himself he might’ve thought someone just asked him when he was going to overthrow Napoleon and take back France. Steve opened his mouth, but no words came out. He was saved a second later with Bruce interrupting in a chaotic hurry.
Yeah, his dad was definitely on pain killers. But sue him, Peter couldn’t help but laugh at his father’s (out of date) use of pop culture, and he just took his seat by the bed, took his father’s hand as a
Tony clutched the tags as if it were a precious artifact, perhaps the most precious thing in the universe. He looked down again, as if to confirm it wasn't an illusion and finally got his stunned mouth to say more than his name.
“yeah, cars move a lot differently when horses no longer pull them.” Tony responded, clearly pleased with his own joke.
Peter’s attention was lost as soon as they reached the part of the line that had dividers between them and was stacked with candy and magazines. Typically, he ignored the headlines because they rarely if ever spouted anything good, but this time he saw a few familiar faces smiling back at him from the cover of US weekly, and his interest was piqued.
“I thought of a new modification on a prototype for one of Steve’s new wrist shields.  But I need it to retract on command, and it can’t weight him down in any way, but needs to withstand some serious heat. So, in essence, I need to create the impossible.” Tony flipped the mask back down, and picked up something out of sight to get back to work.
“Noted, sir.”
!” Hm, so a man who effectively controlled modern technological advancement still couldn’t grasp the concept of a meme.
“Guys, we gotta hurry. I just told someone that that was Thor so they would distract him long enough to forget about the toy.” The group all looked over to where Thor was now happily smiling into a camera with a fan------ and others in the store started to notice too. “I’d say we have like, five minutes before chaos.”
“Not all of us have homemade jet packs, Stark.” Steve laughed along, and their eyes locked on each other as if the rest of the restaurant were just a soundtrack in a sitcom. Peter cleared his throat noticeably. “Uh, hello? Aren’t you forgetting someone?” Peter asked pointedly. Steve’s boyfriend could forgive the press, but even Peter was getting some real vibes from the Earth’s mightiest heroes here. “Where is the mystery man!” Peter continued enthusiastically.
“When are you going to introduce them to the family?”
So peter wasn’t the last to know.
, he thought happily. Steve deserves someone good.
“Yeah, he might be sleeping, but he’ll be glad to see you.” Rhodey answered. Peter nodded at that, glad to have Rhodey back, if even considering the circumstances.
So that’s how Peter found himself in a mall in November, surrounded by the Avengers in varying forms of ‘street clothes’. Well, except his father. His dad claimed that malls were where ‘the black plague really started’ and he was notorious for getting bored of shopping, tweeting their location out in a power move to get the Avengers to just go home. So he stayed back, which was for the best, considering Peter was shopping for his gift first.
“Peter” Tony laughed. He had finally stopped fidgeting and regarded Peter’s very sensible concerns as some kind of cosmic joke. “I can promise you, he’ll love you.”
But the lecture was cut off when Bruce stormed down the stairs, wielding a small black object like it had personally offended him. He slammed in his key code, whipped open the lab doors and said “Tony, if I find another one of Clint’s
----Annnnd Tony’s watch. Tony cursed something colorful, and shamefully looked down, freezing as he read it. “
Peter decided to beat him to it. “Shouldn’t you be like, pulling the sun up in a chariot or something right now? In Steve terms this is like sleeping in till noon.”
Steve was dating a SHIELD agent? Despite working in close contact with the organization, Peter was under the distinct impression that Steve merely tolerated SHIELD. The fact that he was actively dating one now came as a bit of a shock to the young Stark boy, but was a welcome addition.
“It’s fine, Steve.” Peter said tiredly. “Just know that I know. Or at the very least will find out.” He put on his best tough guy voice to showcase that he really could talk like the rest of them, but ended up having to exhale the breath he’d been holding for fear of choking.
” Steve asked with wide eyes. Sometimes, he was really good at playing along.
That sparked a genuine reaction in his father. One eyebrow shot up, and his mouth did that little one side up and the other down which foregoed the need to ask a verbal ‘why?’
, I could just make you something?”
He’s up at 6:50 just to leave by 7:20 for a place that doesn’t even start until 7:45. He’s no math genius but he’s pretty sure that’s fucking bullshit.
“Wow.” Peter whistled. He was used to seeing his family members as stories, but sometimes they were just too good to pass up. The big scandal: Captain America and Iron Man. Two people who fought like they were in some kind of thunderdome, 2 enter 1 leaves situation, canoodling in some Italian bistro. He could see the possibility for widespread interest. However, neither Clint nor Steve had said a word, or moved from what peter’s peripheral could tell. Peter turned then to face them, and Clint looked to be on the verge of commentating, whereas Steve’s lips were pulled tight, his face pale, and his eyes wide.
Well, most of it.
And if he accidentally gave Steve Rogers the cold shoulder here and there, so be it.
his father. It’s not like he could tell them what to do. I mean, maybe from the moral stand point, sure but also he’d have to say that he saw what he saw and waited this long to come out with it! Also, he couldn’t really find the words. They floated around in his head, but never materialized on his tongue.
He was just about to ask what the hell that was about when the bell for the front door chimed and Steve Rogers entered the scene.
Peter hid his smile in his hand, whereas Bruce seemed to get more concrete in his ‘don’t you dare’ decision.
…”. He was stubborn, a trait his family noted as hereditary and Tony noted as “your problem”. And he was also not, even in the vaguest of terms, a morning person. But what person is when school is what the alarm clock beeps for?
Peter groaned internally, they had literally only gotten to two shops before they’d been outed! Whatever, he’d just go with Ned and pick out something Tony would secretly hate but claim to love for Peter’s sake at a later date.
, Peter thought sourly, you’ve been caught. “-----bet you’d thought you’d seen the last of me.”
just love me, and love has made you blind. I talk a lot, did you know that? And sometimes I’ll talk a lot about science things, which makes people even more tired. And---“
“I----- haven’t thought about it.” Steve said quickly.
Steve laughed, “Okay,
“It’s fine! Just a freak earthquake that no one could have predicted or accounted for.”
“Shouldn’t you be in school?” His eyes squinted like he could see the lie on his face, but of this, Peter was totally innocent. School ends at 3, just like it has every day.
“I’m gonna use them as a fucked up baby monitor, you know, hide them around, and then speak like God through them so-----“
Because he was kind of in a precarious situation. Steve was like a father figure to him, and Tony, well, Tony
Steve’s look of utter adoration quickly turned into an all-consuming laugh, but the sentiment remained. “That is so stupid.” He mirrored that strange look his own dad had now, and they kept eye contact for a plethora of seconds past comfortable. Steve had his head in the crook of his hand, and was looking up at Tony with a soft expression doting his face. Tony was standing, still with his present threaded between his fingers and a focus that seemed to erase any other presence from the room but the super solider. Peter recognized that look. It was the same that Thor had when Bruce said something nerdy without realizing. Or Bucky’s face when Natasha wasn’t looking.
Tony opened the gift to reveal a small white box, from which he pulled up a necklace of sorts. No, not a necklace, but dog tags. The ones Steve Rogers wore around his neck religiously. The ones he never took off, not even, he suspected, to shower. In terms of Steve Rogers that was more than an engagement ring, that was… three kids, a white picket fence and a neighbor who said things like “sure is gonna be a hot one today.”
Peter mumbled ‘yeah, yeah’ into the palm of his hand as he texted Happy, and couldn’t help but feel like Steve Rogers went a little far on that escape plan. If he didn’t want Peter to meet his boyfriend, he could’ve just said so.
kid who is shopping for six super enhanced individuals, Christmas can be a real homemade card as a thanks for saving the world affair. No one ever complained, but Peter always knew.
“Excuse me?” Tony asked, slightly muffled by the thick mask. Even still, Peter could hear the shock in his every syllable.
He wanted to ask, but figured he’d save for a day with a little less green and red.
And then it clicked.
“A guy from work.” He deadpanned. Natasha looked away after Steve said that, and he half wondered if she was looking for the person now. She however just seemed to be pursuing her lips, with the corners of her mouth upturned like Steve deserved a comedy special or something.
He spluttered around a few syllables here and there, but eventually Peter caught the message.
That caught Peter’s attention. “
“peter!” Tony interrupted again. Again, there was a small, knowing smile dotting his face and that just ticked Peter off a bit more. If Tony could freak out on whether or not Steve’s new boo would love the genius known as Iron Man, then peter could freak out as to whether this guy liked kids or not. Not that Peter was a kid. A teenager, technically, but not everyone respected that title.
“The bowl attacked me.”
dating!”
“Look!” Thor broke Peter’s thoughts excitedly, shoving a thin plastic box in front of his face. Upon inspection, the thing in question was actually a hulk action figure and Thor looked more excited about it than Peter supposed the target market, ergo children, probably were. “It even has a little bubble that says SMASH!”
was supposed to, and listened to the loopey ramblings of a mad man.
Finally, when the final bell rang, Peter sprinted outside and towards the subway to hopefully catch the 3:07 instead of the 3:20. He made it just as the doors were closing, and spent the entirety of the ride thinking about his soliloquy on how Tony Stark needs to get his priorities straight. Who makes their only son go to school when they’ve just barely survived a blast that would’ve killed anybody else? Either Tony Stark really hated his son or he had a self esteem that hit rock bottom and then kept digging.
“He’s a SHIELD agent too! I thought Steve would date the underside of a public school desk before he ever dated someone from SHIELD, but he says he met them through work, and unless he’s a barista at some café I don’t know about…” Tony merely mmhmm’ed at that. Ugh, of all the people to know last it just had to be Tony! At least Thor would gossip with him, or Clint would go down the conspiracy theory hole but Tony was acting as if this were no giant revelation! Uhhhh hello! Steve hasn’t had a date since the 40’s, this was officially ‘IHOB’ freak out levels! “We were shopping for Christmas presents when Nat brought it up, something about getting him a present…”
, Christmas morning when holly jolly sentiment was passed around and a general sense of merriment filled the air. They had their typical ‘pot luck’ style breakfast which essentially comprised of six superheroes and one scraggly kid in a kitchen that was too small trying to make food that only they liked. Usually Steve and peter were team pancakes, but deciding he didn’t want to make a scene on the merriest of mornings, he’d helped his dad with the eggs. Steve definitely noticed, and passed Peter a few sad, confused looks, but Peter was most definitely not done with the shaming stage of anger yet.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Didn’t ask for that last part, J.”
“Better. There’s not much that can kill your dad.” Clint said, in a rare moment of comfort.
They settled on that early morning kind of silence that wasn’t awkward, but more contemplative. For example, contemplating why on earth any rational being said “hey you know what’s fun? Teenagers before noon.” But for now both Steve & peter had kneeled on the kitchen floor to pick up the rest of the pieces he’d missed. He kept doing this weird thing of checking behind him, but like a good friend he was probably just worried Tony had woken up in all the fuss. Surprisingly, no ‘man in the can’ showed up.
What hurt though, was that typically, Steve didn’t indulge in that kind of lie. When Tony went into the wormhole above New York, it was Steve’s voice on the other end of the phone line. When Steve had been under the gravel of a newly collapsed building he had told Peter frankly ‘yeah, I could have died. But I didn’t.' with a sincerity few others could match. But by the way Steve was now filtering through unoriginal excuse to unoriginal excuse it was clear that Peter was very much, still a baby in his eyes.
“No, I don’t think so. Thor got mobbed and we had to make a break for it. Although we did pass by a pretty funny magazine that said all this tea about Captain America and Iron Man making out.”
He turned to grab a spoon from the drawer, and the hand he whipped around to grab with hit his bowl from its precarious spot on the mantle and fell to the ground before Peter could even react. It broke into a million taunting pieces, and for a second, Peter had to wonder why it was god hated him so. He waited another second to let his senses gather any sounds of incoming footsteps, and when he heard none he moved about to clean up his mess. It was 7:08 now, so he’d have to move quickly and skip breakfast altogether but it’d be worth it if he could erase any trace that he’d failed his first morning test.
“Hey.” Peter noted. Making Steve look down at Peter with faint curiosity.
Natasha joined Thor & Bruce from where they were trying to save Thor from the growing crowd(meanwhile Thor looked very comfortable and even happy as he peace signed every phone that was shoved in his face.) This left Clint, Steve, and Peter to make the line relatively undisturbed.
Thor frowned, “But it comes with a collectible trading card”
Which promptly ended the previous discussion.
When Peter finally hit high school his father let him enter the design part of R&D. Before then, sure he could tinker like the rest of them but he couldn’t do more than screw in a few bolts, or suggest ventilation where ventilation had no previously been noted. He still wasn’t allowed to operate some of the bigger, more dangerous machines but now after school, Peter could race down to the labs and get his hands dirty with Dum-E and his dad.
Peter had spent his night on the side bench of his father’s bed, and when morning came the man had the audacity to send Peter to school. “
“What are you working on, kid?” He looked exhausted, but anybody that pointed that out to his face was sure to get some annoyingly faulty tech in the near future.
But as the fates would have it, he was scraping off the last bits of bowl into the trash when he heard the soft, almost nonexistent opening and closing of the door. And although it was coming from the only room within ear range, there was no way it was Tony (his father opened doors like he was trying to catch Peter cheating with another father).
