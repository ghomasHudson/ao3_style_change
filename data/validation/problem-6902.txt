‘Tony!’ Steve interjects in alarm, before following it up swiftly with, ‘I see how that could be an . . . issue.’
To now see Tony leaning casually against a desk, his intelligent brown eyes trained expectantly on Steve and his expression worryingly blank, is more than a little off-putting.
Steve can’t even come up with an answer to that, because in his usual, cuttingly observant way, Bucky is absolutely bang on the money.
‘That man is my arch nemesis!’ Tony is declaring dramatically, standing by the sink in his pyjamas and welding goggles, pointing directly at a dark-haired man sitting calmly next to Bruce at the breakfast bar, ‘How did you even get in here, Richards? I thought I barred you.’
It can be distracting at times and it can occasionally get Steve’s chest pounding in a weak moment, but usually he can mostly ignore it.
‘That’s it! Out my lab!’ Bruce says grumpily, skirting round the table and starting to shoo Tony out the door.
Like a museum artefact on display, Johnny Storm stands totally naked on the plinth, bar a few charred scraps of fabric covering across his muscled chest. His arms are thrown out languidly to the sides and between his legs kneels Tony, analysing a tiny fragment of blackened material on his thigh with a magnifying glass, his other hand curled around Johnny’s hip for balance.
Steve gave Tony a few hours before he asked JARVIS for an update on Tony’s status. JARVIS dutifully informed Steve that Tony was working, but did not seem otherwise distressed.
Out of all the Avengers, Tony was the most comfortable in these social settings. If he was looking for an exit, that meant things were bad.
“Steve,” Tony said, putting his hand on Steve’s arm. He was smiling, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “You’re right. Going back out there right now sounds worse than fighting a second wave of Chitauri. Let’s go.”
Essentially it spans from July when they first get together to mid-September 2013. Hope that helps keep things clear. Happy reading :)!
This is one of those instances where, as I was writing, it became apparent that the chapter was almost 6,500 words and needed to be split in two. This was the cut-off point. With that said, it means the next chapter directly follows this one in terms of timing, so what do you think is coming? It'll touch on the media response and also a big new milestone for Steve and Tony.
I've included a bit of a preview of the next fic (where Bucky returns!), but you can also read it by going directly to the next fic in the Together series.
Steve wracked his brain, trying to come up with something else that might help with this. The last time he'd gone for a run, but he’d been in his room and able to pull on sweatpants and a t-shirt. Tony was in a three-piece suit. Besides, Steve wasn’t sure running would help Tony the same way it helped him.
why you keep turning down my offers to set you up with women?” Natasha asked, finally. Her tone wasn’t accusatory, just curious. Maybe a little amused.
Apologies for the delay! I struggled with this chapter at times, but I hope it turned out okay. This is set a few hours after the previous chapter :). Enjoy!
They made their way upstairs from the parking garage, however long it took. They even managed to make it to bed. If they were a little more care-free about privacy than usual, well… everyone they normally lived with was gone for the night anyway.
I'm also sorry for the wait, it took me so much more time to write this than I would have anticipated. To make up for that, it's a long one!
Steve smiled; he didn’t think it was surprising at all that Tony had been a Han Solo fan from the start. Tony reminded him of Han, at least in some ways.
Steve reached around Tony with the hand that wasn't on his shoulder to swivel one of the rolling chairs so that Tony could sit — or fall — into it. He rolled it closer; Tony didn’t seem to notice.
Steve shrugged. He didn’t really have any idea; his only experience with fame had been post-serum and he’d never paid much attention at all to tabloids as he grew up. Maybe it was always this insufferable.
Okay, so this one took a turn. Up until this point, everything has been fluffy and upbeat. This chapter... well I had to update the tags because there are somewhat graphic depictions of serious injuries. That said, I'm in the business of writing happy endings, not sad ones. So trust me if you can, and hold on for our lovable, injury-prone, superhero duo.
that weren’t mission-related, let alone with Tony. When he and Tony did talk for any length of time it usually involved the Avengers in some way, shape or form but Steve suspected that was the last thing Tony needed to be thinking about right now. That left him with limited options.
To make up for the delay I'm going to try to post at least one more time this week ;). Comments and questions are always welcome, as is constructive criticism and pointing out any errors you find so I can correct them (I edit these myself, after all!)
Tony was speaking to two men. One of whom Steve recognized as an army general who made it a point to seek Tony out at every event they both attended. As a general, held himself with the rigid discipline of a career military man; even if Steve didn’t recognize him, it would have been easy to tell he was in the service.
This fic won't be nearly as long as "I like me better," but I'm expecting at least another chapter or two and I'd love to hear what you might be interested in reading. I can't promise I'll use a specific suggestion, but I also can't promise that your comments won't inspire me. It's happened before!
I promise I won't leave you all hanging on this chapter for long, but you have the benefit of knowing, more or less, what happens. I'm just going to fix a few things I had problems with before haha. Please let me know what you think!!
“I mean, I know I’ve missed a lot, but I’ve been catching up and I’ve yet to find the point in history when it became acceptable to ask people deeply
I also want to make a note now that isn't super important to this chapter, but is for future chapters. The events in this story are spread out over a number of months. It's not entirely clear but in my head this was, more or less, the schedule I worked out:
“You don’t have to,” Steve assured, quickly. “You’re more than welcome to go back out there. Or, you know, wherever. It’s your tower, of course, you can—”
He stepped into the elevator with Tony on his heels, still eerily silent. Steve thought maybe he was trying to control his breathing. That would explain the prolonged silence, at least.
Steve thought over the floors in the tower he knew would be empty, especially at this time of night. He settled for the floor above. While the 64th floor had one of the Stark Tower’s many, many entertainment spaces, the 65th floor was mostly conference rooms. Apparently, it was important to Tony that his employees never have to fight for conference space. Steve had been there many times and he’d almost never seen anyone, so he didn’t think Stark Industries’ employees were wanting for more meeting rooms.
Steve knew how to make people listen and how to convey a sense of urgency, even when there might not be one. It was one of the few things that came with his assumed rank that he’d adjusted to quickly. Tony’s eyes held questions Steve didn’t have answers to. He seemed more… not relaxed, but focused.
So... what do you think? I'll be honest, I don't know what I was expecting when I sat down to write this chapter, but after the conversation between Tony and Steve, I kinda just went with it. Tony and Bucky decided they were going to... bond? Or something? I still don't really know XD.
I have around 12 more chapters of this written/planned (about 31,000 words), so I should be posting somewhat regularly. If you want to keep reading, subscribe!
I'm also so sorry for not updating sooner. I know I told you all I already have most of this written and I do, but I had a family emergency come up and I spent most of the past week or so in the hospital dealing with a family member undergoing brain surgery and receiving a cancer diagnosis. Luckily, things seem to be looking up now, so I hope to get to a more regular posting schedule.
Steve guided him back into the chair as much as he could, but from the angle he was at Tony more or less fell into the chair.
Hey guys, sorry again about the delay. I really struggled with this chapter for some reason, but I'm also pretty happy with the way it turned out. I felt like there was some good bonding, so I hope you guys see it the same way. Please, let me know what you think and what you'd like to see more of (or less of) in the future!
"Like I said, paranoid, insomniac genius. It used to drive Pepper crazy.” He wasn’t sure why his mind went there, but Tony decided to just run with it. He was running out of things to say, otherwise.
“Alright, then just turn the temperature way down in here,” Steve ordered. He remembered feeling like he was about to combust during his panic attacks.
By this point, Tony’s hand had slipped from his chest but was still clenched in a fist on his thigh. Steve wasn’t entirely sure when, but at some point, while he was speaking he’d started smoothing a hand from Tony’s neck to his upper arm in slow, repetitive motions. He decided not to question the instinct.
“Don’t ask me,” he chuckled. “I had a crush on Han Solo before I even knew what a crush was.” Tony mentioned earlier that he’d gone to see this movie for his seventh birthday; JARVIS had taken him four days after it opened. Tony had
Steve wasn’t entirely sure what to make of that change, but he was going to go with it. Laughing was better than a panic attack, surely.
So... what do you think? This chapter is kind of a huge one for them, right? They're public (and, naturally, Steve goes to bat to defend Tony. Did we expect anything less?) What did you think? Do you think his defense was good? Bad? Should he have just kept his head down?
“It wouldn’t have made a difference, Nat,” Steve shrugged, smiling. “I don't need to be set up with anyone right now. I like my life the way it is.”
Lisa was entirely unsurprised to find Tony Stark wedged onto the bed beside Captain Rogers when she walked into the room to check pain medication levels at 12:03 a.m.
Even though Tony nodded, he still flinched a little when Steve touched him, which made Steve wonder if this was the right course of action. He could be making everything worse.
Do you think I did them justice? Do you think I built up Tony and Steve's relationship properly? Let me know!
When they reached the floor Tony made a beeline for the couch and Steve followed diligently. Tony flopped down into the very center of the couch running parallel to the TV, leaving Steve with two options. One, settle in beside Tony knowing that because of his size there’d be no way to avoid crowding the other man or, two, take the couch perpendicular to the TV. He hesitated for just the slightest of seconds and Tony sighed, impatient.
If you want to skip anything too graphic you can jump from the line that says, "'Yes.' It was the only answer she was going to get." to after the story break.
A: The minute I saw him. Um. I mean — well, yeah. That’s what I mean. SHIELD sent over this Iron Man briefing packet and, of course, it came with his picture. He’s gorgeous. (3/5)
. Apparently, that was news to her because she seemed scandalized. Granted, that may be because I also strongly condemned her factually inaccurate notion that abstinence-only sex education actually works so I can’t say a scandalized reaction wasn’t necessarily in order. but—”
The only trouble was, Steve had absolutely no idea how to fill the silence. He almost never had long-winded conversations with
“You could have told me,” she said, now looking at him as if she were trying to work out a complicated puzzle.
Any predictions about how they're going to finally get together? It's coming up soon, and I'd love to hear any guesses you guys have :).
“No, it’s not a SHIELD thing,” Steve said quietly. The lights in the conference room kicked on when they entered because of the motion and Steve turned to face Tony.
This is my first Steve/Tony fic, and my first fic posted on AO3 ever. With that said, if you have a minute pretty please with cherries on top let me know what you think :)!
“Are you sure about that?” Tony said, grinning wryly. “Or were people less inclined to ask you personal questions because you were
So, what do you think? I struggled hardcore to get that uber-important conversation right, and I'm still not sure I got there. That's why it took so long, but I figure it would be almost impossible to do worse than Civil War so... Hopefully, you all agree lol. Let me know what you think!
A day later we got into it in between bouts of saving the world. I realized he was brilliant, brave and — above all else — a hero. Those things only made him more attractive. (4/5)
I love you all, and I hope you enjoyed. Thanks so much for reading and please, leave a comment if you have a moment and can think of something to say :)!
Steve had a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but the touch didn’t seem to be registering for him anymore. Maybe…
,” Steve said, stretching absently. It occurred to him, after the comment was out, that he and Tony were not, in fact, alone. Not that he really cared. Much.
Steve’s heart rate skyrocketed about sixteen hours later. Tony jumped up from his seat frantically checked his vitals on the monitor. At this point, he was an expert at reading them. Nothing but Steve’s heart rate — which had gone from a steady 35 bpm to 112 bpm in the span of sixteen seconds — had changed.
“You know what I think is strange?” Steve asked, not expecting an answer and not fully certain where he was about to go with this tangent. “Everyone seems to think I’m having such a difficult time adjusting to the 21st century, but I don’t think it’s because they don’t think I can handle the technology or lack of a world war or new foods or any of that. The way people keep acting around me? It’s like they honestly think the
Steve really hoped Tony saw what he was doing here. He was trying to give him an out. If only Tony would
Steve hadn’t ever had another person there with him, but he’d thought once or twice, absently, that it might be nice to have someone there to ground him.
“Sure,” Tony looked down at the floor for a second and took a deep breath. When he lifted his head the fake smile was back. Tony made half-hearted apologies — the kind you make when leaving a conversation you never wanted to be a part of in the first place — and stepped away from them to follow Steve.
“Excuse me, gentlemen,” Steve said, tipping his head at them both. Then he focused his gaze on Tony. “Sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak with Mr. Stark.”
Steve might also have the benefit of being the only person who wasn’t constantly occupied with schmoozing elite donors at this event, which gave him more than enough time to track the movements of his teammates. If he spent a little more time watching Tony than everyone else? Well, Steve didn’t see why that was anyone else’s business.
In case anyone is questioning the whereabouts of our missing Avengers family members: Thor is either with Jane or in Asgard - who can keep track? And Bruce is helping contain an infectious disease outbreak in Asia. He'll be around soon.
“You, my friend, have excellent taste,” Tony patted his knee and hopped up from the couch. “Who wants more popcorn before the next one?”
Tony walked into their bedroom with the intent of joining Steve who he was sure would be asleep. It was 2 a.m., after all. It wasn’t unreasonable to expect Steve to be sleeping. The man got up at 6 every morning to go on a run.
“There are no physical ailments, and the arc reactor seems to be functioning without complication,” JARVIS reported.
Not recognizing someone was strange enough, but the longer the two men spoke with — or, more accurately
Tony: reinforced pencils (that Tony can mass-produce as needed), a sketchbook like the ones he had in the war, and a framed picture of Steve and the Howling Commandos that Tony had found when searching through his father’s collection of Captain America memorabilia
But what did you think of this chapter? They're officially out to the world! What do you think is going to happen next?
Steve reflected on his past attacks, trying to remember what helped pull him out. Once, he had been fine after a few deep breaths of cool, fresh air. Steve glanced at the windows. It seemed unlikely that windows sixty-five stories up would open, but it was worth a try.
Tony still didn’t seem to be listening, but his breathing had evened out some so Steve was hopeful this was either helping or he was coming down off the attack on his own.
“Like the other day,” Steve said, deciding to go all in. “One of the SHIELD agents I was working with absently mentioned his sisters’ wife and then looked at me like he’d just said the most scandalous thing in the world. Then he dropped the subject and tried to pretend it never happened.
She contemplated dragging a blanket over them but thought better of it. Steve was a walking furnace when you were standing within a foot of him, let alone when you were pressed against him the way Tony was. Besides, they seemed perfectly content as they were.
Her lips twitched fighting the ghost of a smile at the sight of the sleeping men. Steve had an arm wrapped tightly around Tony’s shoulders with his cheek pressed against Tony’s dark and mussed hair. Tony had one arm thrown over Steve’s waist and his head rose and fell in time with Steve’s even breaths.
I'm SO sorry for the wait. So sorry. I moved to Europe and back in the past five months if that gets me any sympathy whatsoever. But the ending I promised is finally here. I hope it was worth the wait, or simply that you've enjoyed the story if you've just joined me and read this monster of a fic :).
. Or maybe they’d just started implementing stricter rules about who was welcome at their press events. Either way, Steve guessed that was Tony, too.
Steve thought about it. Yes, maybe the best thing to do would be to go back out there, but… Tony’s hands were just beginning to still and his breathing was still deliberate and measured.
I'm so sorry for the wait on this chapter! I tried to give you a long one to reward your patience :). Classes and exams all caught up to me last week, so my writing time went down to zero. I think things are stabilizing again, though, so I should have time to write again.
Just let me know what you thought, as always. And, of course, thank you for reading. I love you all <3.
“It is likely to be dangerous,” Thor said, with a gleam of hopefulness in his voice that Tony did not miss.  “Perhaps even adversarial.”  Tony could almost hear the
,” Tony said, like he could not believe he was having this argument.  “C’mon.  I already bought you dinner, I don’t do pickup lines.”
It was exactly what he would have told a soldier balking on the trail, he realized, too forlorn to be horrified.
,” he added, as fingers dug into his uniform, feeling its texture and bruising the skin underneath.  He did not dare shoo them off, but he did say, “This is my friend,” which earned a few hoots.  He managed to put a hand on Stovok’s chest, then his own, repeating, “
Directly above the god, still secured behind the railing, Tony Stark lingered.  He had both arms folded on the railing, chin resting upon them, almost boyish in his demeanor.  His gaze was fixed not in admiration upon the Falls but downward, on Thor.  The quiet envy of Tony’s posture was palpable; Steve knew he would have joined the god in a heartbeat, were he not tragically mortal.  Like his father, Tony Stark craved what he could not have.
“I like this game,” Thor said, setting the flask on the table and looking at Natasha, who swapped her cards for the flask.  “Ah.  I see that I am winning.  Captain,” he added lightly, “perhaps you would aid me in besting Stark?”
Steve did not have to push himself to keep up, but he did have to make an effort to keep Clint in sight, following him into a wooded area.  The rush of air and the exhilaration of being on the move with no end in sight unfurled a curled-up, anguished part of him that had wilted under the strain of waking up in the wrong year, learning all he had done had been for personal naught, and trying to survive.
“What bookkeeping?” Clint asked, materializing behind Tony in a disheveled state, missing one sock and his shirt.
“If anything, it’s Stark I’d be concerned about,” Hill said, stopping him in his literal tracks.  He looked down at her, still seated on the edge of the bed, still dressed for a mission, yet perfectly calm.  “You behaved . . . quite admirably, Captain.”
A heavy hand landed on his upper arm.  For a moment, Tony expected a speech, about bravery, courage, triumphing over adversity.  But Stovok just released him and offered kindly, “I can proceed.  I can pull you through.”
Shaking his head, Steve opened the door.  Thor beamed; Tony still looked surprised, then frowned to try and hide it.
He became aware of his Tony tapping out a rhythm on his side, three fingers beating out a steady tempo, and he followed along because
head off, he planted both hands on the back of Steve’s shoulders and steered him over to the couch.  “Look, see—
“Ah,” was all Sojef said.  Tony could see a puzzle piece click for him.  But Sojef went on: “We wanted a sanctuary.  A place to live and raise our children.”
Tony wanted to scream at them.  He wanted to show them what monsters they were, underneath their promises of kindness and compassion.  They could not
“It’s fine,” Steve said gruffly, passing the pie off to Bruce, who just blinked up at him in wide-eyed surprise.  “Finish up.”
Thor simply said, “I am afraid this is the one language I do not speak.”  He patted her on the head.  “Yet I wish to most dearly.  My father said, should we live ten thousand centuries, we should not speak the dragon’s tongue.”  And on he went about the dragons of old, the ones that lived many thousands of years ago.
“No, why would you?” Rhodey deadpanned.  They let go, then sized each other up.  “You’re trouble.  But you’re good at getting out of it.”
Although he moved more gingerly than he had before Marker entered his life, he announced buoyantly, “Never gets old.”
“Exactly,” Tony said, turning back to the wheel.  He shook his head to himself, apparently in real exasperation, and pulled back onto the road.
“I’ll help you out,” Tony intruded, before Steve could even pop the cover.  “You know what a pacemaker is?”
“That’s confidence,” Tony muttered, looking down at his feet, almost—sweet, in his uniform, bashful and thrown, as scared as he was and yet, when they looked at each other, certain, too.  He even smiled a little.  Steve released him, very conscious of his own hands, what he could
“If I die before I live,” Tony began, and the realization crystallized, for Steve, as it surely had for Natasha, at some point down the line—and maybe even Bruce, but certainly not for Clint or Thor, loping about in the wilderness without a care in the world.
“Where’s Thor?” Steve interrupted, gripping his own legs, willing himself to remain present.  A cold sweat clung to the back of his neck.
Without opening his eyes, he knew where he was—recognized the sterile crinkly sheets, the antiseptic taste in the air and the plastic pinch of an IV like the world’s worst bedside manner, dull compared to the untidy feeling of being in pain and being on
“So I’m told,” Tony replied.  He clasped a violently shivering Bruce on the shoulder.  “What’s with you?”
underneath it.  It was odd.  Disquieting.  He had known Iron Man for barely a day and come to forge a connection, yet it felt like shaking the whole house of cards down to feel the simple, shivering, human weight below, underneath the surface, the iceberg.
Steve glared at the back of his head, then gripped Tony’s seat for balance as they careened abruptly down a side-road.  “Tony Stark, what the hell’s wrong with you?”
“Was getting pretty quiet around here,” the spoken-of devil agreed, spinning around at his console, an ear-to-ear grin on his face.  “Can’t pick on Pointy if he’s not around.”
At Steve’s truly unimpressed look, Tony swiped the bag from his loose grip.  Then he sprinkled about half the bag into the bowl.  “Okay, that should be enough.”
“I have . . . a reputation,” Natasha agreed.  “I’ve been around.  Seen a lot of things.  It made me very useful.”
Tony made a disgruntled sound, then pulled out his telephone.  He conjured up the same blue map as before, then indicated a little red dot.  “Lake Huron,” he said, frowning.  “Must’ve—overshot us.”  He closed the map and tapped at the telephone.  After three rings:
A strong feeling of disappointment and annoyance reached Tony.  “I thought you were on-world,” he said.
Boneless, weary, cut down, scored, he opened his mouth to apologize, but Steve said, “No, it ain’t fair,” and Tony frowned in confusion.  “We ain’t all in this game with the same hand, Tony.  And if I could give you some’a my cards, I would.”  When other people said it—
?”  He set Actinium down, then reached immediately for Tony’s sleeve, grasping his wrist in a strong hand and tugging him to his feet.  Tony barely suppressed a sound; he could not hide a wince.  “What?  What’s happened to you?” Tiberius pressed, never one to miss a beat in a business negotiation, certainly not one to miss one
Tony grumbled, “Of course you don’t, they didn’t try to steal your memories.”  Nudging his shoulder against Stovok’s, he added, “I actually think they wanted to keep you.”  Stovok frowned, gave him a pointed look.  “Not that we’d
”) and snatched a bag for himself, then clambered back in the car.  He settled in the space between Natasha and Steve—emphasis on Steve.  Steve could not blame him—Natasha’s personal space was sacred—but Steve did grumble inaudibly when Tony leaned against him.  “Stark,” he warned, but Tony shushed,
in admission sitting in an igloo, then—well, it was still Steve’s money, but at least it came at a discount.  The puzzle was Clint’s money, Steve thought triumphantly.
“Don’t be sorry,” Steve said, settling onto a knee as Secret circled around him, still wagging with uncontainable delight.  “We love dogs.”
Tony squinted at it, but it was too dark to make out.  Then he saw them, a cluster of cloaked figures, one of whom seemed about half a head shorter than the rest.
before concluding that the ranch was eight years old.  It felt wrong to refer to anything in the “2000s” in the past tense, but at least his knee-jerk reaction of
“It’s all right,” Juliet said, bouncing back easily.  “They’re omnivores, actually.  They’ll eat—well, most foods, if given the opportunity.  But we keep them on a strict diet.”
Even though Steve knew, already, how the story must end, he stepped closer to Barton, anyway, listening intently as Clint said: “For a moment, when I—heard you coming down the river, it was like . . . he was coming to get me.”
,” Tony said.  “Let’s play some fucking stickball.”  He pointed his bat threateningly at Clint, who passed within striking distance on his way to the outfield.  “You know the rules.  No pitcher, no catcher, keep track of your own balls.  Full contact is
“Saved many lives, blah, blah, blah,” Clint grumbled, slinking as deeply into his seat as he could, arms folded across his chest.
Steve sighed.  “Bein’ a public nuisance, Tony,” he muttered, stepping into the elevator.  The hotel clerk gave him one last,
“Tony?” Cap repeated, hand going limp on the case.  Cap did not break the hand of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that grabbed it, but he kept his own grip on the handle, refusing to yield.  Cap’s entire posture tensed in readiness, but he never once looked away from Tony, who swallowed, tried to say,
Even with the assurance that Steve was fine, Tony could hardly contain his worry.  He had managed to corral the dragons back into the garage, using some tactical slabs of meat and a few coaxing whistles.  Marker, a foodie, had trotted gleefully into the garage after him; Snow, who preferred the cool indoors, had also followed without protest.  One short head count of the hatchlings later, Tony had located Thallium, who had made herself comfortable on his bed, and Actinium, who was still sniffing around the blood-spattered kitchen.  He had lured them both with another slab of meat and placed the garage on full lockdown.
He swallowed down the anguished cry that wanted to rise out of him, running both hands over his head.
,” Pierce called back, matching his tone, and all the extra hands around the case suddenly vanished.  Tony gripped it firmly, annoyed and unsettled.  “I thought you were assisting with search-and-rescue."
“I’m afraid it’s not in my control.”  Reluctantly, Carter admitted, “I have no qualms with your presence aboard my ship, but I am not the one who controls your placement.  As I am sure you are aware, there is a mandatory three-month cooling period on a Federation planet before reassignment—”
No, the trepidation only started when he saw Thor standing alone on the ice, looking down into an icy blue gap with a smile on his face. . . .
, but it seemed to knock some stuck part of Tony back into gear.  He shuffled to his feet just as Natasha and Bruce stepped outside.
Steve blinked once.  “Of course they do,” he said.  “Monkeys love peanuts.”  He looked at the monkeys bouncing joyfully from branch to branch.  “They’ll eat ‘em right up, I promise you that.”
“Dumb idea,” Tony interjected.  “You’re clearly who they want, why send you in alone?”  He tossed the keys at Clint, who caught them.  “Anything goes
Bruce and Thor’s voices joined the fray, but it was Iron Man’s sibilant, “Never let you in,” that carried, somehow, to the underwater muffle of Steve’s thoughts.
was not sure he liked this—Tiberius was warm and outgoing, but he was also opportunistic, like most of Tony’s boyhood friends.  It was why he did not have many friends, anymore.  Rhodes and Pepper and Happy, perhaps, and maybe the Avengers.  The rest relished the opportunity to jump the shark.
,” Tony complained, kicking the curb, while a small crowd watched Natasha joyfully vanish into traffic.  “She bought that to
.  About anything.  The roads, the weather, the state of Ohio (“Name one good thing about Ohio;” “. . . The Wright brothers;” “That’s—Steve, be quiet”).  Above all else, Tony complained about the seating arrangement.
,” Dorothy declared, looking around a room full of friendly, familial faces, back in Kansas, once again.  “
A shy cat would have fled.  But Rico stayed right where he was as Tony screamed in grief:  Rico’s purring drowned out by his companion’s mourning.
“Darling, you say the sweetest things,” Tony said, having recovered enough from his own self-induced laughing fit to watch a blues’ artist strum away on his guitar, warming up for another set.  “People pay money—a lot of money—to come here, and do this, you know.”
Steve would not drag him away to be seen and picked apart.  Steve would keep him there, close, and above all else,
Then, after a stunningly long and still painfully brief moment, Tony let go.  Steve could still feel the imprint of his warmth on his own skin, an echo on ice.
Thor said, “Truly!  You are of another world, Stark.  ‘Small Smoked Bear of the Big Sandy Lake.’”  Stepping forward, Thor passed “Smokey” along to Steve and hugged Tony, who had the wisdom not to shock the god.  Thor lifted Tony off the ground, squeezed him with an impressive amount of bony crackling, then set Tony back down.
“Thanks, Dad,” Tony said, hanging up.  “Such a sweetheart.  Speaking of, we hear from Romanoff yet?”
“If you two don’t get married in the next five years, I will legally do it for you,” Harold Hogan, the most stoic and unromantic man Tony had ever met, said simply.
The scene seemed strange: moonlight reflected off the waters and cast a white shadow through the window, illuminating Thor’s striking features.  Thor presided at the head of the table; to his left cowered Bruce; next to the good Doctor, Tony Stark shuffled through the third and final deck of cards next to a vacant chair; Natasha and Clint rounded out the set, the latter still browsing a box of Chinese takeout with a pair of chopsticks.
Secure in the lower branches, he looked down and waited.  Without delay, Tony Stark appeared.  Unlike his distressingly futuristic peers, Tony looked refreshingly modern, wearing a nice pair of black slacks, a long-sleeve white shirt, and hang-on-a-second—
Hill stood.  Steve backed up, three full paces, expecting the worst.  Hill eyed him for a moment, curious but still unfazed, before telling Natasha, “Keep in touch.”
“Can’t get rid of us that easily, Stark,” Ensign Barton said dryly.  “It’s you who’s always causing trouble.”
“I am only half-Vulcan.”  Sulkily, Stovok looked aside.  Tony followed his gaze; on a nearby shelf, the tribesmen had clustered, chatting among themselves.  Tony did not like to think they were actually going into the heart of the volcano, but, well.  He had also fancied himself one of those people who would live to be two hundred.
“Fine,” Tony said, sitting up, reaching out, and seizing a handful of uniform.  “I’ll do it myself.”  And he leaned up and kissed a
or I will send you right back to S.H.I.E.L.D.,” Tony warned.  He was not squeamish, but if Steve played doctor and ruined all their hard work, Tony might actually throttle him.
Steve frowned, giving her an appraising look.  She stroked a hand over the shield once.  It hummed at the touch.  According to legend—according to
“You can’t be serious,” Happy said, but Tony was clearly not listening as Happy listed off the many reasons why they could not, under any circumstances, go to Alaska.  And to think, Steve mused, Happy did not even know they were banned from driving across the Canadian border with Clint in tow.
“It’s fine,” Tony said.  “I’ve been meaning to replace my cherished Audi with an even more cherished Audi.”
There was a hush on the sheet near him, and then a warm hand slid under his own.  His cold, twitching fingers gripped it.  His breath hitched and shuddered, and he held on as tightly as he could, grateful for the anchor.  He was not alone in space, this sterile, awful space.  He breathed as shallowly as he dared, feeling the plastic under his nose, grateful it was not down his throat—he would have rioted if they had
fashion.  “This is Steve Rogers, ma’am,” he replied.  Very nearly in slow motion, Tony thumped his own forehead with an open palm.
“Human,” Tony said.  Stovok looked at him sharply, like he was being mocking, but softened when he saw that Tony was not.  “People do like you.  Not
Tony rolled his eyes, shuffled another handful of trail mix out of the bag, and shooed it into his mouth.  “Right,
“I—did—everything, I could, to minimize casualties,” Stovok said, his voice more halting than Tony had ever heard it.  “But that is not the nature of war.  War is . . . beyond reason.”  Drawing in a visible breath, Stovok recited grimly, “Lieutenant James Barnes was killed fourteen days before the Battle of Cheron, the final battle of the Romulan-Earth Wars.  He was one of 7,952 Starfleet officers killed in action over the course of the war.”  Softly, he added, “I remember your father.  He saved 842 lives.  Including mine.”
Two seconds later, Steve ottered out of the frothing, freezing water, stepping upright and shaking off once vigorously.  Reclaiming his jacket, he wound it up and whacked Clint on the hindquarters with it.  “
Clint, who had insisted on bringing up the rear for surveillance, shouted back, “We brought Smokey!”
They could have been explorers mapping the wilderness in the mid-1800s, a time so distant yet so real to him.  Clint would have joined the Lewis and Clarke expedition, standing on the brink, shouting into the wind in drowned-out exultation.  Bruce, the scientist, might have tagged along, huddled against Clint’s back, apparently not caring who was shielding him as long as it was not his own destructive alter ego.
Steve scowled.  “Thanks,” he deadpanned, accepting his change and a cluster of tags from the ticketer.  The ticketer’s hand trembled with barely repressed awe.  “Thank you,” Steve added less hostilely.
Steve wondered, as Natasha and Tony trailed behind them, arguing, while Bruce clung to Steve’s sleeve like a man hanging over a pit of piranha-infested waters.
Some things, he might never understand.  Some things, he was just not supposed to—the world was a strange place, after all, even when he understood a larger fraction of what was in it.
“That’s corny, Tony,” Steve complained, but he did sit beside him, drinking his own mug down in a few seconds.  “Anything else I can do for ya?”
Tony shook his head again, pacing away.  “No.  You know what?  I’m going to kill a Gorn.”  Pointing at Stovok, he added, “You’re not invited.”  The automated doors slid shut gently behind him, but his blood boiled.  Fired.
Annoyed, Tony rasped, “What, you thought you could save them all?”  He looked at Actinium, half-buried in the sand, and said, “Ten isn’t enough?  It all comes down to her.  You lose her, you wouldn’t give a God damn about any of them.”  Seething, he said, “If I had known it was going to be
There was nothing to fight.  Hogan popped the door open.  Tony suppressed a sigh, climbing stiffly out of the back of the car.
“I wouldn’t try it,” Tony warned.  “We were within the ice belt’s dispersion zone when we sent Thor down.  Much farther out, we’d have a very sunburnt Hirogen.”
It was Dr. Banner, of all people, who looked up from his clasped hands and acknowledged, “It’s a dangerous place.”
“Gross!” Clint complained in the not-too-distant distance.  “Get a room!”  Lucky yelped beside him, then took off.  Tony scrambled to get up on the table before the dog made landfall.  “Incoming!”
Thallium obliged, clicking softly, close-mouthed.  Like her mother, she had two long horns protruding directly from her brow, which would someday become fierce deterrents for any creature foolish enough to approach her.  For now, they could punch holes in Tony’s arm, but they would hardly kill him.  She sniffed tamely at him but did not bite.  Despite himself, Tony’s heart melted.
, under his breath.  Tony wouldn’t look at him, at all, until Steve ordered, “Say sorry.”  Then annoyed eyes shot to him, like Tony could not believe Steve was holding him at proverbial gunpoint over a
It was all a dream, Steve decided fervently, keeping his eyes ahead, solely on the Black Widow, and his arms wrapped firmly around his cargo.  The details would never matter.  Even he would not matter.  Only the people in it, who would be left behind when he evaporated, come morning.
The thought of seeing the hatchlings again finally drove Tony to move, standing on sore legs, retreating to the cool interior.  Steve watched him from a respectful distance, like he was a dragon.  He found Tellurium, the one and only bronze, curled up on a couch, chin on the arm.
.”  He huffed at the memory.  Then he gulped down the rest of the coffee and set aside the empty mug.  “You’d think it could drive your car and write to your Ma, for how they advertised it.”
Steve thought, as Dorothy appeared on-screen, alongside her beloved—“Toto,” he said out loud, remembering Natasha’s clue:
“Are you sick?” Steve asked frankly, because it seemed less frightening than the real question knocking on his door:
Despite the peace offering, Steve Rogers remained in a foul mood.  His shirt was too damn small, his teammates were being interrogated in a foreign country, and his shoulder still hurt from the reduction.  (At least he could blame something other than his own stupidity when attempt number one became attempt number seven.  “Built Ford Tough, huh?” Clint had jested.  Steve had used his working arm to jab him hard enough in the gut that Clint had switched out with Thor, who had managed to reduce Steve’s shoulder in one quick
Tony tossed back the rest of his scotch in one gulp.  “Cheers to becoming cranky old men.”  He spun his chair carefully to watch Tellurium glare at the pool, her little wings extended to their full height.  “She’s a terror.”
“I’ve been told,” Steve said dryly.  Before Tony could stomp off or sulk, he caught Tony by the sleeve, asking, “Do we need to talk?”
Tony looked at the mother of dragons, who watched him intently, her snow-white jaws bloody from a fresh hunt.  Yet he felt no danger, nothing beyond the typical thrill of encountering a living dinosaur.
With a controlled burst from his heels, Tony crossed the short distance between them, wrapping both arms around Marker’s neck.  “You’re my favorite big beautiful bastard,” he exulted.  Marker clicked indecipherably.  “I wish I spoke your language!” he shouted back.
Steve liked him a lot, but he was a bit worried about Tony, who had “eccentric tastes.”  He had no trouble shooing Steve out of his lab if he was “in the middle of something,” even if said “something” was staring blankly at a wall for several hours.  After the—the thing-they-did-not-talk-about, Tony seemed particularly persnickety.  Rico might not go over so well with him.  But that was all right.
They sat, almost shoulder-to-shoulder, for the better part of an hour.  Then they followed the tribesmen deeper into the heart of the volcano.
He found Steve in the kitchen, looking apologetic and almost nervous, saying, “Tony,” but he did not respond to it.  He kept walking, in a daze, towards the garage.  “What happened?” Steve asked, but he was out of sight and out of mind, as far as Tony was concerned.  “Tony?”
The scene faded away.  In its place was a weathered-looking Barnes on a starship medical bay.  Stovok himself was busily wrapping Barnes’ hand.  “How you holding up, Stovok?” Barnes asked, almost idly.
“I don’t know about this, Tony,” Steve confided, walking alongside him but keeping Thor in his sightline.
A faceless person appeared in front of him, head and shoulders obscured.  He recognized the black parka before the Black Widow, gaze affixed on the current.  He needed to move.
Tony shooed them out of the dining hall and into a more private reception area in less than two blinks.  Happy ground out a string of expletives.  Tony checked the gun cartridge, rolled his eyes, and said tersely, “Well, it’s comforting to know you can walk through the front door with a loaded gun.”  He snapped the gun shut, then flicked a switch and tucked it in his belt.  “Who wants to go first?  Me?  O.K.  I’ll go first.”  He glared at Happy, then Steve, then shook his head.  “Happy, this is Steve Rogers, yes-
“Oh, they sure will,” Juliet said, a strange tone entering her voice, a bit of forced politeness that seemed painfully familiar.  A bit of
“I was awarded this bear for my superior marksmanship,” Thor informed him, proudly holding up the poor smoked teddy bear.  “I have named him—”
On the 0400 hour, Steve Rogers greeted the nation with a heartfelt proclamation: “Good morning, America.  Happy Fourth of July.”
The Zoo had officially been closed for more than an hour, but the hog keeper said, “Oh, we have special events that run late, they’re fine,” when Steve worried about how disruptive they were being to the animals’ evening routine.
need a suit.  The ill-fitting leather jacket makes you look fresh off the range.  I’d send Roscoe your measurements, but I haven’t the faintest idea what they are.  He can eyeball them.”
I had a bit of a rough spell, but I return to you, excited and ready for Alaska. First stop: Juneau! Thank you for being patient, and I hope you are well. And, for your patience, have a complimentary cookie: 🍪
Tony, of course—the great orator, the speech maker, the one who could pull magic from thin air—fumbled completely.  Stuttered.  Came to an utter halt.  He was sure he lost a lot of his precious time, just waiting for all those words to come, before he said at last, “I love you.”
“Big baby,” Steve grumbled, setting down the clean knife.  “All right, all right, settle down,” he said, scowling as Tony covered both of his eyes.  “Could you not?”
‘Let Fury and Hill deal with it, Cap.’ Tony says dismissively, ‘Or better yet, let Coulson do it. S.H.I.E.L.D brought him back from the grave to babysit us, after all, didn’t they? Plus, the undead do love the spotlight. Just look at how many zombie movies there are, he probably—’
On closer acquaintance personally however, Steve found that though he usually could look past the character flaws in most people (he did love
It’s something Steve has now learned to cope with over the years and while he doesn’t feel the same crawling anxiety he used to when the heat of battle has cooled, he still keeps his washing routine and the other Avengers know better than to disturb it.
In a spill of limbs and scuffling, Bruce finally shunts Tony out of the lab and slams the door in his face.
Tony understood what his friend was saying. It was the right thing to do but he didn’t have to work himself up over it this second. “One day at a time, Jarvis. We’ll get there.”
Jarvis is waiting to help with her bags when he pulls into his recently deserted garage. Pepper quirks an eyebrow earning an almost imperceptible shake of the taller man's head and the subject of Tony’s old car collection is never brought up.
He didn’t recognize the number but his security system made it hard to imagine he didn’t know the person on the other side of the line. “Stark on the line.” A familiar laugh followed.
Both doctor and patient lived in this moment for a while before heading their separate ways. This entire experience had never been Tony’s idea to begin with but he was enjoying it to some degree. Dr. Banner wouldn’t hesitate to say he didn’t mind the billionaire all that much either.
The drive is uneventful. It’s comfortable having someone who knows him so well in the passenger seat. It’s even better that it’s Pepper and she’s got so much to say about everything that happened during their time apart that it’s like she never left the city by the time they make it back to the tower.
“I say we make the most of it! Would you care for a guided tour? One of my friends from school helped put all of this together so I’ve become pretty well versed.” Tony had no time to say no as the other man took hold of his arm and led him to the first piece.
It’s there in Steve’s eyes, in the way his jaw is subtly clenched and in the way he’s radiating tensions Tony can’t believe he was able to ignore for years.
“Your brother really did a number on him, Virginia.” The atmosphere in the room is a bit tense but that never stopped either of them from speaking their mind. “Oh believe me. I’ve given him a piece of my mind more than once since then.” Case in point.
“We really should.” He hoped that didn’t come across too blunt. He was still working on voicing his thoughts anyway. Steve just kept smiling.
There is a silence that follows, almost awkward if it weren’t for the apathetic teenager coming to ask for their orders. Steve sighs and rubs the back of his neck – a sign he’s nervous. That makes both of them.
“You think he wants a second chance.” Apparently not. “I know he wants the comfort of always having someone in his corner no matter what.” That information he has to process. It’s new, hearing his relationship with Steve put in those words.
“Tony?” The tension in his body at the sound of that voice could really only mean one thing. He stepped back to face the small booth he had just passed to get into the queue and smiled sheepishly at the blonde who had called his name. “Hey, Big Man…Long time no see.”
These last two chapters ended up being a lot shorter than I imagined especially given the time it took to post them. I appreciate you all for reading and apologize only for being unable to translate what my mind created properly into text.
“Just be smart about it, Tony.” He grins. She must have decided he was serious enough to not argue about unneeded expenses. “Roger, Rogers.” She smiled in return before gently nudging him out the door.
“Stark Industries has decided to offer scholarships to individuals interested in pursuing a degree in Psychology.” Tony nodded, still stuck on saying his doctor’s first name as well as suddenly getting hit with the importance of what was about to be done. The other man continued.
He should be making eye contact. Really. It would be too difficult to maintain. Too easy to decide it’s not worth continuing. “You misunderstood –“ It was the strained laugh that does him in.
Tony turned his attention away from the sky wide eyed at his companion’s comment. “Did I say that out loud?” Jarvis chuckled placing a hand on his shoulder in a comforting gesture. “It’s not bad to speak your mind, Stark. I know it’s difficult to do consciously but progress is progress.”
After their less than perfect introduction, Steve had quickly gathered that Tony and Johnny were old friends of some description, though Tony had apparently never felt it prudent to mention Storm to any of the Avengers before
Maybe it was some kind of spooky universe magic, or maybe it was just the natural progression of life. Yet somehow, some way, the months carried on going by. The tattered remains of people’s lives slowly stitched back together. Friendships were restored. Cities were rebuilt. Homes were filled with laughter again. Pepper and Tony stopped throwing things at each other in board meetings. Bruises began to fade and wounds slowly began to heal.
‘Coming from the man who designs his home with a sun-deck and then never uses it.’ Natasha smirks, eyebrows raised, leaning back elegantly on the bench with a sigh.
‘Jesus!’ Tony groans, taking a long gulp of his drink and looking over at Steve with an unimpressed huff, ‘It means that at that time in my life, I had been doing
Steve thinks, shame and panic suddenly extinguishing his remaining anger and burning sickly inside his chest,
Pepper Potts, who despite their epic breakup, still loves Tony in a way no other woman will ever come close to, frequently threatens to pay Coulson to have him assassinated and then shipped back to her so she can feed his corpse to piranhas.
‘I thought you’d be pleased to have me out of the way.’ Steve interrupts, the cup he’d been holding for the entire conversation shattering suddenly under his grip, ‘I’ve been trying to give you space, Tony.’
‘I’m just sending a friendly request for help from Tony’s best buddy in the whole wide world: Reed Richards.’
Tony looks momentarily dumbfounded, his eyes boring holes in the side of Steve’s face, before he shakes himself alert and yells:
‘If you were, I was too.’ Tony corrects him, taking a sip of his cocktail and glancing quickly away, ‘I’ve been pretty much full-tilt crazy about you since the Chitauri, Cap. Pepper’s my everything, but she’s got brains and eventually she got sick of my denial.’
‘Sir, I really must protest—’ JARVIS’ voice echoes through the sitting room as Tony, in a burst of furious movement, sprints to the wall by the elevator doors, picks up a large glass vase off a shelf and hurls it violently back at Steve.
He had put on his best Captain America face for the impromptu press-briefing in Central Park, then obediently followed Coulson back to S.H.I.E.L.D HQ to deposit Dr Doom’s metallic ass in a suitably uncomfortable holding cell. Nick Fury then accosted him on his way to sign out and dragged Steve in to a conference room where he had rambled maniacally for nearly half an hour on the destructive capacities of the Avengers, before disappearing in an angry swirl of disapproving leather coat.
‘You’re unbelievable.’ Bruce scolds, sending Steve a sympathetic glance over Tony’s head, ‘We’re going now. Go be insane somewhere else, Stark.’
‘You put 1kg of exposed lithium in it, what did you expect?’ Bruce huffs, scowling and grabbing his mug back from Tony, tipping the rest of his tea away and pouring himself a new one, ‘Also, you got any other suggestions for world-renowned scientists with expertise in incendiary-proof polymer composition?’
Steve thinks about other Julys he’d spent in the Big Apple, before all this glass and air conditioning was born. Of the smell of hot tarmac outside his fire escape, the screams of kids in the park and the taste of crushed ice with cherry that Bucky used to insist on buying.
‘Of course not.’ Steve smiles warmly, taking a big sip of the flask of chamomile tea offered to him and then instantly regretting it, ‘Me and Tony were headed for a showdown for a while.’
‘Oh, I’m sorry. Are you ignoring Black Widow and Hawkeye too?’ Tony gasps, spanner clutched to his chest dramatically, ‘Answer: no, you’re not. It’s just me and though you may think I’m chronically antisocial, Cap, I can gather a hint from that.’
‘Ouch, frosty welcome.’ The guy responds jokingly, leaping down another flight of steps and flinging his arm around Tony’s neck happily, ‘I thought we were all kissed and made up, Tony. You know, I’d heard from Susie that you’d gotten serious, but this I didn’t expect! How long has it been? Six, seven years maybe? Is this any way to greet your old buddy Human Torch after all this time?’
Tony stops dead, voice dropping away and his whole face going bright pink. Steve looks down at the floor, his heart beating a mile a minute and his own cheeks turning a flush of red.
Yet, as Natasha likes to remind him, Tony is no longer giving the supersoldier his undivided attention anymore, he’s giving it to Johnny and Johnny is giving it back.
Steve isn’t vain, he’s had years before the serum to get used to being the least interesting guy in the room.
‘As the answer has already been released in to the public domain via People Magazine,’ JARVIS says in a voice that
‘You’re avoiding Tony.’ She accuses Steve, swiping his feet out from underneath him with a wooden pole and sending him face first in to the sparring mat, ‘Why?’
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ Steve growls, pushing himself up and stalking to the little sideboard where they put the used coffee things for the staff to take away, ‘The team is fine and I don’t see what it has to do with anything.’
‘Better cover your ears, JARVIS.’ Tony answers in a low, passionate whisper, his eyes locked on Steve with smouldering intensity, ‘I’m about to fuck the living daylights out of a national icon.’
‘Touchy.’ Clint grunts, jumping through the air and landing next to Steve in a flurry of black, ‘What crawled up your ass tonight, Double D, and do you mind if I join it?’
‘That’s good.’ Bruce nods, looking nervously over the ledge of the 79th floor window, ‘You’re not . . . you’re not going to jump or anything, are you?’
‘You really are too much sometimes, Rogers! I feel like I’m talking to the Pope.’ He guffaws, almost falling off his chair as he spins it back in delight, ‘You should loosen up a bit, doll. It’s just a bit of cock after all. What’s a bit of cock between co-workers?’
‘Don’t need to.’ Bucky shrugs, cracking a cold beer open with his teeth and spitting the cap in to his hand, ‘Says it all really, don’t it?’
‘Send a nice, high-res copy to the mobile contacts labelled ‘Red-Headed Danger’ and ‘Ash Tray’ please.’ Tony pants between furious kisses with an increasingly impatient Steve.
Only Bruce gets up as early as him when they aren’t working and he’s usually holed-up in his lab by the time Steve finishes his morning workout. Usually, that means that Steve has the kitchen to himself for a few peaceful hours to enjoy a hot cup of coffee, read the daily newspaper and watch the sun start peeking up over the tops of the city’s skyscrapers.
‘And you’ve upset Steve with your . . . language.’ Bruce huffs, his whole shoulder bracing against Tony’s back as he pushes.
‘Because, if any two people deserve to be happy, it’s you and Tony, Cap.’ Natasha states, as though it’s a quantifiable fact, ‘I don’t want to have to interfere, so, I strongly advise that you drop your jilted-maiden act as soon as possible.’
Surprised by their sudden entrance, Tony and Steve stand rooted to the spot on opposite sides of the room, like little children caught in the act of squabbling. Their chests heaving in unison and a graveyard of smashed crockery strewn between them.
‘Partner?’ Tony supplies, lashes fluttering closed as Steve leans down to place a searing kiss on his parted lips.
‘Wish upon a star for an ass kicking?’ Steve laughs, rubbing at his eyes with the heel of his hand, ‘Look, much as I appreciate it, Buck, this one really
If Steve was back home and still with Bucky - spending a night out amongst the sticky dive-bars and cheap nightclubs of
He often replays the messages Tony leaves him; the man’s voice always sounds so casual and easy, like the old radio stars on the wireless. The masculine tones bouncing off the walls of Steve’s quiet apartment and filling the stillness with that little bit of Tony’s trademark Stark liveliness.
It’s far worse than how it used to feel, seeing Howard flirt with Peggy back in the day and doubly worse than how it used to feel watching Bucky with any of his dates.
The communal kitchen, on what they all refer to as ‘The Avengers Floor’ of Stark Tower, is usually deserted when Steve gets in from his morning run.
‘It’s a bet then.’ Richards smirks, waving goodbye to Steve and pressing the button in the elevator with a ping, ‘Goodbye, Captain Rogers, it was lovely to meet you.’
‘It is.’ Tony agrees, eyes sharp with curiosity, ‘Now, I’ve shown you mine, so you show me yours. What’s up with you and Mr Frosty?’
Years later and Steve is now pretty much used to being an experiment. He knows that when it comes to love, he’s often a place-holder, a one-time experience, a memorable tumble in the straw with The Star Spangled Man with a Plan. He’s never even really minded it before much either; he likes to please people and Steve’s also not too proud to admit that, after years of nothing, it can be damn nice to be wanted.
‘Steve.’ Natasha cuts him off, stroking her hand up his shoulder and dropping her voice in to a syrupy whisper, ‘If you don’t go and make up with Tony right now, you’ll be missing out on the perfect chance to be with the man you love and also to stop acting like a jealous idiot. Plus, if you don’t, I’ll be very,
Tony’s workshop is a mess. It’s scattered with tools, half-finished projects, wires, schematics, blobs of soldering metal, coffee cups growing fluffy mould and piles of dirty clothes. Sometimes, when Tony’s been in there a long time, especially if he’s angry, the place starts to smell too - a pungent mixture of grease, oil, sweat and whiskey.
‘Okay then, play dumb, that’s real mature for someone over 90 years old.’ Tony sighs in exasperation.
‘I still don’t get that about you. Didn’t you live in a beach house in Malibu for years?’ Steve laughs, shaking his head in confusion.
sue you for sexual harassment.’ Daredevil glares, ‘Secondly, your so-called leaders are clearly having a lover’s tiff again. All night I’ve had to deal with lovesick Avengers clogging up the good rooftops,
After that, there was the seemingly endless saga of ‘megalomaniacal purple weirdo who loves destruction and outlandish jewellery’, with the occasional interlude of ‘guess who’s dead now? Oh wait, never mind, Tony and Loki are back!’ — which honestly, the less said about all of it the better.
‘So, anythin’ new with you?’ Bucky asks innocently, legs flung over the back of the sofa in Steve’s apartment and helping himself, upside down, to a plum from the fruit bowl on the coffee table.
‘I’m assuming you mean Bucky.’ Steve states, not wanting to catch his eye, ‘Sorry to disappoint you but we’re not . . . not doing . . .
Even with the few women that he’d courted - Peggy included - though the kisses were sweet and the touches seemed achingly real, Steve could never quite tell if it was him or the
When Coulson had informed the director that Captain America and Iron Man had been fighting with each other, to the point that Coulson himself believed both of them to be temporarily emotionally compromised, Fury had benched Tony and Steve so hard that the aftershocks could be felt all over Manhattan.
company instead.’ Steve spits, dodging the splinters of a vase as it shatters on a TV screen behind him.
So yeah, to sum it up: Steve Rogers, national icon and chaotic, time-travelling, bi-sexual is head over heels for the son of the man he used to think was a total slimeball for hitting on the ex-love-of-his-life. Who he really respects as a team-mate, but also has a sinking feeling might be the most unattainable choice for a sweetheart ever. That is, until maybe they can somehow work out how to make the supersoldier serum grow Steve some cracking breasts.
‘Yeeeeah, I think we better round up the team. Prying eyes and all that.’ Tony sighs fondly, gesturing lazily at a line of trees about 200 yards away, where a gaggle of eager looking journalists are starting to trickle towards the scene of destruction through the scorched undergrowth.
Take Bucky for example, as much as Steve had wanted him back in the day, it was never going to go further than the single drunken fumble they’d had behind a bar once before Steve had changed or a quick, relieved kiss or two on the cheek after battle.
As he keys in the code and opens the door to the lab, Bruce and Tony are involved in a heated debate. Between them the holographic table is showing what looks like a jumble of sticks and balls floating in the air and Bruce is gesturing to a small highlighted portion of it seriously.
This time though, he doesn’t even need to. Tony’s grip is still branding a mark on his shoulder, when across the terrace, Natasha takes off her sunglasses and sits up suddenly.
‘Get your own supersoldier.’ He snaps at Richards, leaning back in to Steve’s chest, ‘This one is the property of Stark Industries.’
‘Hmmm, what about boyfriend then?’ Tony laughs, looking up at him with eyes full of mischief and affection.
Tony gets up quickly from his seat and crosses the room to another desk, where a large half-empty bottle of scotch sits and pours two generous measures in to a pair of glass beakers.
‘We didn’t break in, JARVIS buzzed us up and we can leave if we’re bothering you, Tony.’ Steve says seriously, a ball of worry forming in his stomach.
‘Flame on, Идиот.’ Natasha answers anyway, disappearing round the corner in a flash of black suit and red curls, leaving him lying on the mat with something twisted and ugly stirring in his gut.
‘You didn’t see them together.’ Steve says, ignoring Bucky’s vulgar reply, ‘Plus, Tony hasn’t had the best relationship with Captain America over the years, jury’s still out whether or not he still thinks I came out of a bottle.’
‘What’s going on?’ Steve says, taking the moment of hush, as Tony taps furiously on his Stark-phone keypad, to make his presence known.
There is a soft, tinkling smash as the beaker falls from Tony’s hands and shatters on the workshop floor, orange drops of leftover scotch bleeding from the shards.
‘What are you doing?’ Steve asks, though he doesn’t really have any idea what they are still talking about anymore.
‘Truce.’ Steve agrees, pulling on his cowl, ‘Can you give me a lift? I’ll sign your document when we get back.’
Tony is too much and not enough, too clever and too stupid, a really good guy and a potential world-dominating super-villain all neatly wrapped up in a 5’8 package of brown eyes, charisma, insomnia and caffeine addiction.
‘Tony?’ Steve questions quickly, standing up in to a defensive pose, ‘Do you know what that object is?’
morning however, instead of  his beloved silence, Steve hears loud voices before he’s even opened the kitchen doors and is surprised to see the place pretty hectic when he steps inside.
‘Your clothes burned off by horny aliens and be forced to run through the streets of New York with your massive, green—’
‘Well damn, did they suck all the Brooklyn as well as the asthma out of you with that serum?’ Bucky teases, getting up from the sofa and punching him lightly on the shoulder before turning it in to a long, friendly squeeze, ‘We’re New-Yorkers, pal,
‘Home run for Odinson!’ Clint yells hoarsely at them, attempting to lift Natasha up in to a cheerleader hold before she promptly decks him to the ground without ruffling a single hair on her own head.
‘Geez, crawl out your own ass! You think I came all the way from Wakanda just to mess with you?’ Bucky  scolds him, flipping himself up the right way and throwing the plum at Steve’s chest, ‘I can think of plenty of ways to spend an afternoon in NYC that don’t  involve you and your cloying catholic guilt.’
‘I think,’ moans a satisfied Tony from next to him, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder, ‘That you broke my ass, Cap.’
‘Never mind that, we all saw the news, Cap was inspiring, blah blah blah!’ Tony interrupts before Steve can reply, flinging himself off his desk chair and striding over to lead the supersoldier by the arm, ‘Come take a seat, Blue-eyes, you’ll love this one. Seems like our lean, green Banner-machine has been having some wardrobe malfunctions recently and he’s come to me for help, isn’t that cute?’
Now, in this sterile, modern world of noise-cancelling walls and silent, impersonal appliances that do everything for you, Steve sometimes finds himself craving the yells of an errant child getting scolded outside, a C Flat loudly played at 6 in the morning or even the smell of a pile of dirty laundry that desperately needs to be washed.
‘That’s not funny.’ Steve glares, blood suddenly running hot with annoyance, ‘Why the hell did you even go out with a clown like that in the first place?’
‘Someone’s gotta keep you in check. I gotta say though, I’ll make sure to say a sermon of Hail Marys for you in church next time, Steven Rogers - you’re either going to die of carnal misadventure if you go there with Tony or chronic heartache if you don’t.’
It happens occasionally, usually when they’re playfully bantering and Steve seems to be least on his guard. Tony will suddenly get all up in his space, voice low, eyes flashing and his touches hesitant and chaste yet firm and tempting too.
‘What the fuck are you talking about?  Space from what? From who? Have you been smoking Bruce’s secret stash of jazz-cabbage? Or are you completely and utterly—’
‘Never a dull moment around here.’ Bruce says to Steve with an amused sigh, rubbing at his neck and striding over to his computer.
‘Aaaaand there it is.’ Tony sighs, pushing himself up on to his elbow and looking down at Steve with affectionate exasperation.
There’s a long pause for a while, as Bucky sits statue-still on the arm of Steve’s chair and seems to think deeply. The rhythmic ticking of the clock above the bookshelf the only sound in the room.
sounds disapproving now, ‘I believe I can, Captain. Mr Stark was involved in a romantic relationship with Mr Storm for 5 months between November 2006 and March 2007.’
‘Not going to happen, Mr I’m-Only-Good-At-Machines.’ Bruce calls back, childishly flipping him off with both hands.
your first kiss.’ Bucky scoffs, ruffling Steve’s hair, ‘Nice to see you’re still useless with both though.’
‘Noble friend Steven, do you and the Man of Iron still persist in your quarrel?’ Thor booms, his cloak flaming in places as he shatters through a large window of Stark Tower’s swimming pool area.
‘I’m sorry, Steve, I’m probably not making a lot of sense to you right now. I’m in Singapore and I’m incredibly jet-lagged. What I really just called to ask, is if you’d go down to the workshop for me today? Remind Tony that he has other commitments he needs to worry about - not just designing bomb-proof underwear. Can you do that for me, please?’
You’re not supposed to be out here, Captain.’ Daredevil says firmly, stepping out from behind the shadow of an air-conditioning unit.
‘Tony doesn’t hate me. We’re past that. At least, I hope we are. Do you have a reason to believe otherwise, Buck? Cos if you do, you should tell me.’
Steve is in the middle of waving off the apology with a friendly shake of his head, when Tony suddenly slots himself between the pair of them, slapping Steve’s hand back down by his side.
Both Steve and Natasha stare blankly at the sight, their bodies taught with the thrum of adrenaline.
‘Well, what do you want me to say?’ Steve demands, wheeling around, his built-up anger starting to get the better of him, no matter how ill-placed he knows it is.
There’s only so long you can avoid all unnecessary contact with a teammate, that you have to save the world with on a regular basis, before people start to notice.
57 minutes later, Steve lies panting in a pile of clothes on the workshop floor, with sweat on his brow, a delicious ache in his hips and the biggest smile that he’s had on his face since 1944.
The wind gently rustles the paper on his easel and something unexplainably summery seems to float along with it.
Under the star on his chest, Steve feels something visceral give a fluttery, lurching thud inside him and a dazed feeling of joy sparks unbidden up the nerves in his spine.
Steve repeats the message once more after listening to it, letting it play while he’s sitting at his dinner table and blindly shovelling chow mien in to his mouth.
Still, not one to look a gift-horse in the mouth and actually feeling in need of a bit of company, Steve isn't willing to turn them down today.
Bruce’s lab, on the other hand, smells like recycled air, aftershave and chemicals. Bruce keeps all his tools in neatly-marked drawers, his papers in folders, his floor free of shrapnel and he absolutely point-blank bans
explains why I’ve been hearing that you’ve been having super-secret slumber parties with Snow Patrol again.’ Tony rambles on, ‘Nice way to lick your supposed wounds, Rogers. Barnes is very attractive after all. Wish I’d thought of that with Johnny actually, instead of just sitting here on my hands, trying to figure out what exactly I’ve done to piss you off
‘I was . . . jealous.’ Steve sighs, shaking his head in shame, ‘After Thanos, after everything, I kind of thought that maybe we might of . . . had something. But, I got afraid and then you and Pepper got back together and then—’
Steve doesn’t get why they can’t just drunkenly scrap it out like normal guys, but then again he’s not a genius, just a time-travelling artist from Brooklyn.
Tony’s laugh, crisp and pleased, echoes pleasantly through the room as he slides in to place on the sofa opposite Steve, drink in hand.
‘Stand down.’ Tony yells at her, when she swiftly pulls a gun out of somewhere inside her sundress, ‘It’s okay, Nat, he’s with me!’
‘Woah, that’ll do there, Cap!’ Tony calls out from somewhere above Steve, sending a mild repulsor blast at his back to get his attention, ‘I think Steels On Wheels has eaten enough vibranium for one day, don’t you?’
‘It’s unprofessional for one,’ Natasha calls back, walking away towards the gym doors, her hips swinging hypnotically, ‘and two, Tony might actually start to think he’s blown his chance with you and then get back together with his ex for real.’
Outside the window, the twinkling lights of the city illuminate the streets below and across the inky black heavens, a pale half-moon fills the sky with a luminous glow.
He doesn’t look up when Dum-e chirps a robotic welcome at Steve, his face wrinkled in concentration and a tiny screwdriver clutched delicately in his hand.
While his personal suite at the Tower has its own fully-functional kitchen, Steve likes the view from the communal one better and prefers to take his breakfast there whenever he can.
‘Sure.’ Steve replies, ignoring the way his pulse gives a little skip at the mention of Tony’s name.
At first he’d seemed frustrated, ignoring the kid’s innuendos and shepherding him into the lab like an unruly puppy. Then, after a while, when others were around and they’d gotten used to Johnny, Tony seemed almost flattered. His face smugly fixed in an ‘I-told-you-I-was-irresistible-isn’t-my-life-a-burden’ smirk whenever Storm got flirty in front of any Avenger.
‘Whose got a lover?’ A voice calls out from above, as another shadowy figure swings down towards them from a large radio aerial, ‘Hey, guys. This some kind of secret hero club going on up here?’
‘You alright there, Hugh Grant?’ Tony questions teasingly, his tone amused and his eyes softening slightly with mirth.
‘Still not quite right.’ Steve murmurs teasingly, pulling him up by the hand and dragging him close to his chest.
After a long pause, Jarvis says, almost apprehensively, ‘Shall I continue with the report, Captain Rogers?’
even know what’s going on in your head? 'Cos genuinely, I’m starting to think this is some kind of late-onset, post-popsicle dementia or something, because—’
‘I just knew this was going to be a distraction.’ Pepper sighs in a long-suffering tone over the phone, ‘I warned Tony not to do it.’
The afternoon that he bites the bullet and goes down to see Tony, the workshop is in its usual state of chaotic disarray and unruly clutter. The lights are dimmed low, apart from a bright cluster of LED spotlights illuminating the plinth in the centre of the room and a new, pungent smell of burning rubber hangs heavy in the air.
Tony, for an apparent lack of anything better to do in their down-time, has taken the brief talk of a bet with Bruce and Reed Richards seriously.
Everything - apart from strangely Steve’s reborn friendship with Tony - seemed as astronomically screwed up as it was ever going to get.
‘Yeah? Well, sorry to burst your bubble. Thor’s down the hall, third door on the left, the handle sticks, so jiggle it a bit.’
‘Oh no, no problem at all.’ Pepper says airily, ‘Just that the face of the biggest corporation on the planet is currently drunk canoeing live on national television.’
‘You know,’ Clint says to Steve as they watch the pair disappear into the night in twin flashes of red, ‘He’s kind of got a point.’
‘Keep your cowl on, soldier. I don’t know shit.’ Bucky assures him, slipping the plum out of Steve’s hands and taking a big, satisfied bite, ‘Although, I would take a gamble that a man who moves you in to his mega-building and spends all his free time staring at your star-spangled ass is probably, at the bare minimum, somewhat interested.’
wasn’t bad enough, then came the whole soul-crushing ‘should I return to my own time to be with the woman I’m pretty sure I love, but to be honest, I’m not really certain. I mean, I literally spent like 2 months altogether with her if you actually add it up, so that’s a bit of a gamble. I never actually even kissed a girl until I was at least 24 and that was on stage and I’m not sure it counts. Not to mention, that I pretty much messed up my psyche forever by fighting the purple weirdo, so let’s face it, I ain’t anyone’s dream guy at the moment. Oh, and I kissed her niece, which might be a bit hard to explain at family dinners in a few years time. #Awkward’ episode.
‘I dunno why you worry.’ Scoffs Bucky, ‘You’re Captain America, what’s this guy got that you don’t have, an extra John Thomas or something?’
‘You know, for a person who isn’t even technically an Avenger right now, you sure gotta lot of nerve, Cap.’
‘It looks like a person. Potentially a mutant.’ Natasha shouts, her bright eyes betraying her alarm.
‘Sorry about the birthday suit, Cap!’ Johnny shouts over his shoulder, ‘We’ve been in here for hours and it looks like I’m just too hot for Tony to handle.’
Next, there was the whole ‘your best friend isn’t dead, but he’s an evil brain-washed assassin who killed your frenemy’s dad’ debacle — which sucked even more.
‘Indeed.’ Agrees Natasha, allowing him a moment of reprieve to pick himself up  before she smacks him across the shoulders with the pole again, ‘When you and Tony fight, you tend to take the rest of us down with you. So, answer my question: why are you avoiding him?’
Johnny seems unphased by this and drops a hand to Tony’s head, running his fingers affectionately through the thick, dark curls like . . . like . . . like a
‘Do you know where Tony is right now, Captain?’ the unimpressed voice of Pepper Potts demands through Steve’s phone.
sad unless it was about that time some crazy lady broke Mjölnir or when Jane totally ‘‘didn’t’’ dump him.)
First, there was the whole ‘freezing for 70 years in the arctic and now being forced to save the world from futuristic robots’ incident — which sucked.
In practice, what this actually seems to mean is that Tony spends all day in his workshop with Johnny Storm, watching and taking notes while the guy incinerates test fabric off his perfectly-sculpted body in large flaming strips.
He recovers quickly however and after a brief moment of thought, places his own drink down on a table and swaggers languidly across the patio to the easel. Here, he places a tender hand on the back of Steve’s shoulder and leans down close to admire his canvas.
‘Captain America.’ Reed Richards finishes, smiling and holding out his hand for Steve to shake, ‘It’s a pleasure to meet you, I’ve been meaning to introduce myself for a while, but circumstances haven’t quite worked out that way.’
Steve could stand on the shores of the Atlantic on a clear night and look up at the night sky to see scattered points of light.  In every city, there were traces, gatherings, smatterings of stars—hints of a feast for the eyes, but nothing so clear as to wow the imagination.  Even in Steve’s time, there was a longing for what was lost: celestial light.
Steve let out his own quiet sigh of relief, waiting a full twenty minutes to be absolutely sure Tony was out before beginning the painstaking process of shuffling away.
But as it petered off into hiccupping sobs, and as even those finally quieted into sniffles, and as even those, at last, died down, Steve looked into the room again, his own heart in hanging tatters, and saw Tony on his belly, one arm crooked over Rico, who was lying next to him.
“You actually stayed the entire time?” Tony rolled his eyes. “Jarvis, it was maybe ten minutes of small talk. Less even. Nothing serious.” Jarvis sighed.
He’s suddenly realized that the feelings of judgement he had so long ago from his friends had never been aimed towards him. Now he has to consider that his ex-boyfriend could potentially be using him for press despite having been in a serious relationship since they broke up. Pepper sighs and sits on the arm of his chair, leaning into him.
Steve took a moment to process what Tony had just called him and found himself blushing in embarrassment for staring longer than he should have been. “Sorry. Hi. Wow. Definitely wasn’t expecting to see you here.” He looked up again questioningly this time. “Do you want to sit?”
“My number hasn’t changed. Tell her to give me a call. I miss her.” He was expecting the look that followed. That look of shock people who knew him before gave him when he expressed his feelings. It still made him uncomfortable though. “Listen, I know it’s only been a few minutes but I should go.”
“Right, of course.” Steve stood up and made to hug him but was cut off by a sharp “Don’t.” Tony winced at his own abruptness. “Sorry.” Steve nodded taking his offered hand to shake and brushing off the hint of rejection he had felt. “It was nice seeing you again, Tony.”
“You haven’t been in the public eye for almost a full year. For the most part the paparazzi have left you alone. Why would that trend stop the moment you start running into him again?” His body relaxes into her warmth, his mind continuing to run in circles. “This isn’t a conspiracy, Pep.”
All he needs to do is announce his presence, it wouldn’t be hard. Yet, something in the tone of Pepper’s voice as she takes the offered drink in Jarvis’ hand makes him pause. “I wanted to thank you. He’s clearly doing a lot better.” The fabric of the sofa cover rustles as the other man gets situated.
“Only if you ask for it.” He would give her the world if she asked for it. Jarvis too. They deserved it for sticking by his side for as long as they had.
It was nice to think about them instead of everything else the world had to offer. Enough to distract him from the things that could make his anxiety go up. Like a certain someone knocking on the window pane while he was clearly distracted.
This is the longest he’s made it without making headlines. With the Stark name, the streak was bound to break eventually. On his desk there lays a magazine, it’s cover screaming “Playboy Play Date: Stark Industries’ CEO Back to Breaking Hearts” in large bold letters that frame a grainy shot of Tony in the middle of pulling his harm out of a distraught looking Steve’s grasp.
There is a new feeling that washes over Tony in that moment as he watches his inner most circle celebrate their new endeavor. It’s cool like being submerged in pool water during a heat wave. He knows what it is because the voices in his head stay silent and let him enjoy the moment.
“We are out of the office, Tony, Bruce is fine.” It came with a small smile. Probably the only reactions the psychiatrist was willing to show. “Alright, Bruce –“ Jarvis caught his hesitation.
“You’re over thinking.” Tony snapped out of his reverie. “I’m always over thinking, Doc.” Dr. Banner offered him a small smile and adjusted himself to better balance the legal pad on his leg.
Without drinking, without the paparazzi gaining opportunities to catch him doing something stupid and without the nagging voice in his head constantly pushing him to believe he is far from doing his parents proud…he was out of excuses. This was the road to recovery. This was driving in New York traffic to pick up one of your closest friends.
Tony’s lips twitched with the suppression of a smile at Steve’s awkwardness. “Sure.” Nervous laughter eased the tension after a short moment of silence. “You look good, Steve. How’s Pepper doing? I heard she’s coming back home soon.”
“None taken. I believe we owe it to human nature. He might have everything he ever wanted in his relationship with James but now, he doesn’t have Tony.” There’s enough silence in the time that passes after that Tony starts to wonder if it’s time he step in.
“The press follows you.” It comes out patronizing – how had he never noticed the righteous air that Steve gave off…
“The public remembers Steve. They remember you with Steve. James…he’s secure in his own right. I’m more worried about how Steve is going to handle this.” How could he have ever mistaken those feelings as anger towards him, as frustration towards him. “You think this is what he wanted.” He has to choke out the words.
“I’m proud of you. I can tell it’s getting a little easier and Dr. Banner will only confirm it for you when you go to your next session.” There was no helping the warmth spreading in Tony’s chest at the compliment but there was no time to dwell on it once his phone starting to ring.
“He seriously mentioned James? He can be so clueless sometimes.” He wanted to agree out loud but decided not to. The past was past, it did not have to affect his future. “It’s not my problem anymore really. Listen, Pep, the real reason I wanted you to call – as much as I love chatting with you - was because I wanted to offer you a job at Stark Industries as my personal assistant.”
“You missed her.” He glanced in his direction. “You didn’t?” Jarvis pressed himself into the cushions and stretched his legs out onto the coffee table taking his time to formulate a response. “I think it’s a good step. You’ll have to tell her everything. If she’s going to be Tony Stark’s personal assistant she needs to know that you aren’t the man who dated her brother anymore.”
“Calling to cancel our date?” The sound of her chipper voice immediately lifted him from his earlier musings. “I
He waited for her to say something. Anything. “Pep?” “You’re joking.” He frowned. “Pep, you’re outstanding. I have no reason to joke about this. Whenever you’re ready, say yes and I’ll hold the position until you get here.” She laughed causing Tony to relax. “Don’t act like you didn’t open position especially for me. Of course I’m saying yes!” He fought the urge to fist pump the air settling with a high five from Jarvis who was still listening to the conversation.
“No. I’m not giving you questions to ask, I’m giving you an exclusive. Tony Stark is not who he used to be and if you help everyone else stay on that track, you’ll be the first to interview one-on-one.” Pepper doesn’t plead but she knows how to sell it.
The thought of seeing Steve hadn’t even crossed his mind. Of course he should have known he would run into him here but, at the same time, what were the odds that they would find themselves in the same New York gallery on the same night.
They had established early on in their sessions that what worked best to get Tony to talk – about anything – was silence. So that’s exactly what was promised. Anything to see him through.
“Is that really how you answer the phone now?” He laughed. “It’s nice to hear your voice too, Pep. I’m guessing Steve gave you my number?” Jarvis looked up from his own tablet in interest.
There's a sweet sense of nostalgia now that there's someone other than Jarvis to help him feel at home.
“Glad to see you’re forever holding that against me.” Things aren’t going according to whatever plan was supposed to play out today. Here in this café there can finally be closure.
It wasn’t far from the truth. Company was always better than being alone. “I bet I missed it more.” Tony looked up at Steve’s smile again. It looked like he meant it.
It's short...and not super in depth...and it also sounds different than the other chapters buuuuttt I like it sooooooo......😬
“Then I’ll see you in June?” He felt his phone vibrate against his ear. “Much earlier than that. I just sent you my flight information. I expect you to pick me up at the airport yourself, Tony. I know Jarvis is listening so if you aren’t there you’ll both get a beating.”
The crowd stirs as a projection of “Playboy Play Date” fills the screen behind him. “I can imagine you lot have questions for me.” It’s Jarvis who rakes his eyes over the audience in order to let each outlet representative have their turn. “Mr. Stark, the public has been noticeably kept in the dark about your life this past year. What’s brought on this most recent change?”
He was never going to get used to the tightness of this office. He’d always imagined a well known doctor with Dr. Banner’s resume to be set up in an all glass office building in the middle of New York’s skyline. Yet here he was in an 11 x 16 room in the back of his Manhattan town home.
It’s a promise to his closest friends, to himself, to the people still trying to process what he’s admitted to. “Thank you. That is all.” He could say more but it’s dawned on him that there is so much more he could do. He laughs as the cameras begin to catch up to the moment.
The gleam of mischief in Tony’s smirk was obvious as he looked at Steve and asked, “Do you want me?”
“No,” Steve said.  For good measure, he swiped the cannister from Tony and tossed it aside, removing temptation.
Tony managed not to nod off, even as the narrative drifted into its third hour.  He understood, as Clint and Indium sat on the floor listening with apparently equal intent, how stories like
, thank you.  He squeezed Steve hard enough to hurt anyone who wasn’t pumped full of super-soldier serum and stayed exactly where he was.
“If it hasn’t happened yet,” Steve said, lounging fully clothed in a dry bathtub with an equally dressed Tony Stark on top of him, “I don’t think it’s going to.”
“Let me take care of my friend,” Tony said, speaking to keep the atmosphere jovial, well aware that they did not truly understand him.
“You won’t have to start today,” their pilot assured.  “Should be a great day to check out the glacier.”
Tellurium hopped back onto the bed as soon as Steve got out of it, but she settled by Tony’s feet, which was acceptable.  “Happy Christmas,” he told Steve.
“I do,” Stovok said.  He immediately doused the spark of hope in Dr. Banner’s eyes: “Contact Starfleet and request a rescue.”
He could not move, could not sound the alarm.  He could only stare at the computer, and those glowing words.
Tony nodded, then tripped over his feet a second time.  Stovok caught him by the front of his tunic, held him in place.  They looked into each other’s eyes for a moment, and Tony could almost see the earthy brown dirt, the white ocean waves, the strange longing for greenery reflected in fathomless blue.  “Why would you not inform them of our dilemma?” Stovok asked him, an audible hint of accusation in his tone.
for bad guys, he spent more than a few hours wondering how to reconcile the desire to be fearless with the desire to remain
“Naw.”  Steve loosened one of his own arms, reaching out to stroke down Tony’s side, the touch making him shiver, despite the cloth between them.  Tony had a—how to put it,
Alexander Pierce, ever the wolf and never one to back down, gripped the Tesseract's case, an unpleasant smile on his face, undeterred by the violence rankling in the pristine lobby.  Three of Pierce's lackeys latched on.  Tony stood his ground.  The Avengers had fought for this cube.  Beside him, Thor was speaking in a tongue Tony did not know and could have been
Stovok paused mid-turn, looking back at Tony with surprised eyes.  “I am your senior officer,” Stovok said.  As a Vulcan—
“Suit yourself, chief.  They’re best fresh.  Kind of like. . . .”  Clint frowned, then admitted, “Man, I’m really off my game today.  I got nothing.”  He cracked open a Pepsi can, then toasted Steve with it.  “Cheers.”
With a small sigh through his nose, Stovok said, “I have failed more than I have succeeded.  I do not know what that makes me.”
Tony nodded, then pulled out his telephone.  “Look, see, he’s in—”  Tony frowned, then conjured up a glowing blue structure.  Using his fingers to manipulate the image, he finished faintly, “Australia.”
?  Here I would’ve thought you would’ve found it all a bit restrictive.  Asgard is a nudist colony, right?”
Taking a moment to enjoy his own space, Steve sat on the edge of the newly made bed.  He drew in a fortifying breath.
Tony thought, muting the television and looking at Steve, his eyes burning with sleeplessness and sickness.

Steve followed, wishing he was less conspicuously dressed.  He was followed, he was watched, he was—
Thor looked down at his shadow, who blinked up at him expectantly.  “Ah,” Thor said, sounding, for the first time in his life, perhaps, surprised.  Then he scooped up Vættr, who looked at him with those big black eyes, and said something in old Norse that Tony could not hope to understand.
, Steve grasped his fingers, briefly, then laid them down on Tony’s chest.  “Been a . . . long, ten years, hasn’t it?”
“Stark Industries built his legs,” Tony said cheerfully.  “No freeze-ups at 29,000 feet.  Same tech I used in the Mark III.”
A blue-gray rug came scurrying around the corner.  Steve lit up like a Christmas tree when it changed course abruptly and scrambled over to say hullo.  “Oh, Secret,” apologized the stranger, as the dog,
His back was on fire, but he kept his feet, long enough to stumble over to a chair.  Marker followed him at an indiscreet distance, looking ready to shove him along if he faltered for even a moment, clicking briskly in encouragement.
Stovok looked up at him skeptically.  Tony looked back, propped up on one elbow, like they were at a sleepover.
“I assure you, they are authentic.”  Tony had never heard Stovok’s voice so soft, pleading, humbled.  “I must press again my petition, that we target not the Romulan base directly, but allow ourselves to disperse and repel them as individuals—”
Clint ran like a hound: for the first two miles, he moved as though the wind were in his sails and he had no choice but to accept where it pushed him.
And nothing bad happened.  No other monsters burst through the door.  No life-changing agony split open his chest.  No demands were made.
Tony had never seen a planet stripped of its crust before.  Barton voiced his thoughts: “What the hell could do
Clint’s new toys were all very interesting, but only in a secondhand way, a compartment of Steve’s mind dedicated to late-night bookkeeping.  The main sector was about as quiet as the Cuban café, which was dusting out its last customers for the night.
Tony arched his eyebrows expectantly.  Steve reached for his wallet, grimacing at the soaked leather.  He quickly thumbed through thirty-eight twenty-dollar-bills.  Seven-hundred-and-sixty dollars.  “Yup.”
Steve stared at him.  Looking down at his hands for a moment, Tony was silent, almost casually interrupted by his own thoughts.  Then he met Steve’s eye earnestly and said, “I’m saying there are more options than here or a padded cell.”  Then, gingerly cupping a hand over his left eye, he added, “Although, if you ever wake me up before seven again, I will personally priority-mail you to Nick to do with as he sees fit.”  He lowered his hand, looked at Steve dead in the eye, and said seriously, “He’s a nice
; that an everyday joe could look him dead in the eye and call him a bastard was refreshingly humbling.  Although he
Steve let the talk wash over him, staring out the window as the rain neared them, one thought in mind:
“You ever think what it would be like,” Steve mused, gazing up at the tyrant kings of the prehistoric jungle, “to live back then?”
The grim hours that ensued brought Steve back down to Earth.  He appreciated the layout of the day—the heavier events offset by the lighter ones—but nothing could make the wreath he laid at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier any lighter.
Captain America stepped forward, cowl up but looking dangerous, like the wolf who had come to chastise the pack for misbehavior, his gaze alighting on Pierce with unexpected malevolence.  “This seemed more important," Cap explained.  After a long beat, he added,
“Uh-huh,” Steve said, sounding lightly winded, which would have been hilarious, if all twelve sets of Tony’s ribs weren’t throbbing in unison.
When he heard no signs of movement, he lifted his shield, prepared to break in.  Then the door swung open, revealing a very rumpled-looking Bruce.  Bruce blinked once in surprise.  “Hi.”
When Tony did not produce them, Steve understood it was a joke.  “You’re lying,” he accused, slightly more pointedly than he intended.
Pierce did not reach for it.  Cap released the agent, who staggered away, clutching his wrist to his chest.
“I can transmit short-range signals to the suit,” the disembodied voice began, but Natasha pulled a baton off her belt and said simply:
dogs—Steve looked around the rest of the Fruit Farm (or was it a Cider Mill, first?), ignoring the growl in his belly at the smell of fresh dough emitting from the farmhouse.  He was not a man ruled by his appetites.
“Once Captain Quill alerted us to the incident, we returned to the coordinates to beam you up and found . . . nothing.”
“Time is diminishing,” Stovok interrupted, looking down at the caldera below.  “I have found Dr. Banner.”
Tony let out a breath.  A tiny voice piped in, “. . . Should I take this one?”  Moments later, Scott Lang appeared.  He looked more sober than Steve had ever seen him.  Steve felt embarrassment scorch through him, turning away, ashamed at his own reaction.  “No, it was my bad.  I think.  Maybe the—”
It was locked up tight for the night, but they paused outside the marble steps to gaze up at the quietly illuminated temple.  There was something particularly arresting about it, at night—solemn and entrancing, truly a place out of time.
I wrestled with the best way to approach this set of stories. In the end, I decided that a continuous narrative worked best, even if it meant, gulp, a new work-in-progress!
Tony just grumbled wordlessly in disagreement before chucking his shoe at Steve.  This worked out poorly for him: Steve caught the shoe midair and chucked it far afield.
“Something we could all use a little more of,” Tony said, which made Steve give him a funny look, like maybe Tony was odd to him, too, and Tony finished off his own balled-up cookie.
“No, that’s it, I’m engaging a medical—override,” Bruce announced, staring openly as Tony released Stovok’s shirt and Stovok stepped back briskly, meeting Bruce’s eye with only a vague air of disapproval.  Bruce made a slightly punched sound, then paled, then pointed between the two of them.
,” Tony insisted, stripping off the welding glove and shoving on a metal gauntlet.  “You’re already trouble, you know that?”
Steve scooped up the dog in both arms, leveraging himself up to his knees with difficulty.  Lucky managed to escape, yelping and leaping joyfully towards the back of the house.
“It’s not.  The hard part is—keeping—”  He shuddered once.  And Steve understood that, oddly enough.  He understood cold better than most people.  Tony didn’t need to say it out loud.
Tony nodded tightly, tapping the bar for a refill.  In record time, the bartender replaced the horrible drink.
.  Then he let them slide through his fingers, kicked up the kickstand, and roared back down the road.
He slid out of bed and flattened himself beside the Vulcan, for a moment simply lying there, before the dawn.  Shuffling closer, he wrapped an arm around Stovok’s chest, then tucked his face between Stovok’s neck and shoulder.
Then he turned around and returned to Tony, who could barely say, “Idiot,” around the lump in his throat.  “What if they need you?”
enveloped him, and in her eyes, he could literally see it, the arctic wasteland, the excitement of digging in the snow for something, huge claws working to rip open the ice.  Then the vision vanished, and he was back in the freezing garage, looking at a dragon who did not belong to him but claimed
Halfway up a pine tree with Tony Stark clinging to his back, one hand slung over Steve’s shoulder with bear spray in hand, Tony asked plainly, “Can I bear-spray him now?”
I can make it up to you by providing context for these choices! Tony really does go on to build an Onyx: black-and-gold Mark 20 ("
Frowning, with more questions than answers, Steve nevertheless took the hint, exiting the bar ahead of them.
Tony’s fingers felt the plate edge for a moment, tentative, then, suddenly, pulled his hand back, pulled it tight to his chest.  “Don’t touch me,” he hissed.  “Don’t—”
Steve held Tony steady in one arm as he spear-fished the remaining hot dogs with the other, ignoring the teeth gnawing at his forearm.
“Took you long enough,” Steve grumbled, sitting across from him and polishing off his second burger.

him, at first.  Bewildered, he said, “Stop,” and Steve halted, which was better behavior than he could accredit for the rest of the abominable evening.  For a long moment, he was caught between retreating and allowing Steve to do fuck-all with his arm and allowing him to carry on because, odd as it was, it was not especially
Tony sighed, gravely disappointed, but said, “Yes, we can go now,” and gestured down the sidewalk.  “Just follow the—” but Bruce was already galloping ahead.  “
could proceed to treat him like a very ugly science experiment.  Fuss and fuss and who cared about a chemical spill here or there?  If there were mistakes, only he was hurt by them.  They could carry on indefinitely, so long as their strength of will endured.  He could not.
Steve sighed a little.  Tony shimmied again, relishing his newly aligned spine or simply bothering Steve, he could not be sure.  Probably both.  He took a leaf from the Bruce Banner book on human relations and looked determinedly out the window, in silence.
It had not been a particularly unusual mission, Tony thought, following in Stovok’s footsteps, careful not to twist an ankle on the shifting terrain, flinching quietly from a rolling wave of thunder in the distance.  While Vulcans were hardly warm and fuzzy, they were one of the most reputable members—indeed, the first non-human members—of the United Federation of Planets, and Vulcans and Romulans shared a close common ancestor.  Indeed, they were once the same people—but the Vulcans had chosen a path of peace to end their endless warring, violent and emotion-driven, while the Romulans had shipped off, colonizing Romulus and Remus and embracing their hostility as a way of life.
Steve thought about digging in his heels, forcing Tony to meet the consequences of his actions.  Then Steve shook his head and stepped up to bat.
.”  He must have been really upset, to actually talk with his mouth half-full.  Swallowing, he added, “You tell them,
a bit hand.  Tellurium hissed strongly at the disturbance, but, to Tony’s relief/surprise, she allowed Steve to scoop her up and set her on the floor.
“Right,” Tony said.  A stranger might think he was simply recovering from a cold, his breath thin.  But Steve could hardly make himself follow as the tin man limped along, determinedly but far from silently.
Steve pointed.  It took Tony Stark, the genius, a full ten seconds to notice the nail puncher in his hand.  Then he frowned.  “This makes it more fun,” Tony explained.  He aimed the nail puncher at Steve, adding, “I could hit a
,” Tony said loudly, making Bruce wince but the Nibirans rustle back to silence, and Bruce looked around, took notice of their shadows, gulping visibly.
, Steve repeated, grabbing Iron Man under arms and knees and lifting him up.  For all his physical presence, he was lighter than Steve thought he would be.  All that armor, and it was just the weight of a person, underneath, that mattered.
to procure a meal.  Hellcalves didn’t grow on trees, after all, they grew on hell grass, which grew hellaciously slowly, according to the underlings, who were probably lying to him because they were all just jealous bastards.  Tony suspected he might resemble former King Kevin by the time his own “truly dire, gristly in the extreme, ceaselessly inedible” hell meal arrived.  At least he would be permitted the opportunity to name and slaughter the calf himself.
, close to his heart.  He wanted to pull the whole thing out.  He reached up with a hand to do so and—
With a grimace that anticipated great remorse, Tony lifted the coconut to his nose, sniffing at it.  The Nibiran next to him made an encouraging sort of sound, and Tony set his teeth around the edge of the shell, surprised at how soft it was.  It had a vaguely apple-like texture.
Despite the tranquil atmosphere, Steve stayed on edge, listening to the forest, ready to tackle Tony, bury him with his own body against sniper fire or a stray grenade.  Some things, he knew how to handle.
Steve swallowed, then leveled a considering look at Happy.  “I don’t wanna be your enemy,” he said simply.
Tony’s predictions were right: the waves foamed close to them, soaking their feet, lashing them with icy mist.  To Tony’s surprise, it smelled vaguely of chlorine.  Stovok encouraged, “Ingest as little as possible,” over a wind that Tony’s tricorder reported as 52 kilometers per hour, strong enough he leaned his head into it and followed directly in the Vulcan’s path, taking advantage of his human shield against the elements.
Thor left him, taking some of his warmth.  The Raccoon, whose name Tony could never remember, said from the floor, “Sheesh, I’ve been at happier funerals,” and followed.
Under normal circumstances, he suspected Steve would have shoved it off, shrugged it off, said something like,
“Double agent, Clint,” Tony called, hiding behind Steve as Natasha looked meaningfully at them.  “Okay, big guy, you’re up,” Tony said, patting Steve on the back of the shoulders.
.  Sometimes, being quiet was best.  Natasha seemed to have mastered the art of keeping Tony’s attention without granting her own in return.
“You—really?” Tony asked, turning fully in his seat to frown at Steve.  “They aren’t new.”  Then, turning back to Natasha, he said, “Oh,
.  Vulcans were not a touchy-feely race; why should Stovok intercept his own stupidity?  It was not as if the small fall had
“Apologies for the interruption,” “Jarvis” said.  “I am only looking out for you.  Might I recommend
Stovok liberated it.  “Captain Carter will appreciate your compliance,” Stovok said.  He swished the brandy once, then sniffed at it.  “I was under the impression high-quality spirits were reserved for special occasions.  Saurian brandy is not for the weak of heart.”
The matte yellow car seemed fit for adventure.  If it had revved its engine and leaped off the platform, Steve would not have been surprised.  Even as Tony circled it, the car seemed to invite the scrutiny, daring him to find a flaw.
“Tempting as it is to make this Risa Two,” Tony began conversationally, but Romanova stepped on his insole, hard enough he wheezed, “can’t beat the original.”
Rico yowled again.  “Don’t fuss,” Steve told him.  Tentatively, he entered the attached bathroom, caught a glimpse of a familiar face in the mirror holding a skinny tabby cat but still no signs of Tony.
Steve kissed the side of his head again.  “It’s okay to be scared,” he offered.  “Bein’ scared just means you care.”  Nuzzling in, feeling Tony finally relax, Steve added, “This is home.  I go out so I have somewhere to come back to.”
The same elder as before approached, spear at the ready.  Tony tried not to run, to panic, to make any sudden moves whatsoever as—
Romanova waited until Thor was out of earshot before explaining calmly, “Hirogens can’t swim in water.  Their muscle density is too high.”
.  We’re all that’s left.”  Looking imploringly at Stovok, Bruce stepped closer and said, “Please tell me you have a plan.”
Still red-nosed and gloomy, Steve looked at him briefly.  Then he said, “No,” and turned back to his sadness cookies.
Bruce finally appeared at the top of the gap, clocked his head on the exact same spot, said loudly but without heart, “
“I met them,” Tony said, drawing all eyes on him.  Apparently, this part of the story was new: they were all listening, even Captain Carter, in her calm-and-collected way.  “I beamed on board.”
Steve shook his head, not in negation but: “Above my paygrade.”  It was like fine art; he was there to look, not touch.  If he needed a ride, he could buy a share—the thought of owning a vehicle, even his own bike, was wishful thinking, borderline dangerous.  Envy had driven many men mad over the years.  He could not want outside his means.
He could feel the thunder, the crushing weight of an ungraspable and yet highly tangible sum of water striking the river far below.  It was so incongruous—a tame river morphing into the violence of the Falls, only to mellow out again at the base into another river—as to jar the mind.  He wondered what people who had never been to war thought of the transition point, the loud, loud, loud way a river could simply fall off a cliff.
“Then he’ll make a wonderful substitute for you,” Tony finished, pinching his nose.  “You think Romanova and Barton will come?”
Tried to, anyway.  Bronze Tellurium kept joining him, wherever he went, and unlike cuddly green Thallium, Tellurium tended to indelicately jab her horns until he made room for her.  When he grumbled about donating her to a politician in need of a few more sleepless nights, she hole-punched his ankle.
is an in-depth list of every car Tony Stark owns, which explains why he refers to his "beloved Audi" twice. (Finally--someone else did the homework for me!)
.  That,” Tony protested, disobeying Rule Number One and laying a flat palm on the side of Stovok’s face, intending to give him a gentle shake as a reminder that scaring years off his life was only cute the first time.
Then Thor set it back down.  “Not yet,” Thor said jovially, as the shaken but not hurt hog snuffled around the dirt, its companion utterly unfazed and chewing on Steve’s pant leg, anyway.  Steve chucked them both a few more apple slices, accidentally bopping the poor animal on the snout.  “An infant.  It would scarcely whet my appetite.”
anything, but he had no idea how to fix this.  “Is there a doctor?” he shouted, but it came out like a thin cry, like he was a ninety-pound asthmatic again.  His hands were hovering over Tony Stark’s chest, and he knew that every second was another second behind death’s door, a door that would never open if he didn't pry it open—
Sitting on a bench beside him, Tony gave him a mean look.  Then, seeing that there was nothing but curiosity in Steve’s eyes, he said, “
“I shall escort you, fair lady,” Thor volunteered, which was gracious of him, until Steve realized Thor was leaving
Tony looked at the ceiling, squinting an eye shut, blocking out some of the light.  “How am I alive?” he finally asked.  “I thought—”  The white light.
Encompassing 3,255 square miles of land, the capital city of Alaska was larger than two states: Rhode Island and Delaware.
Vulcans were terrifically strong.  Tony dug in his heels.  He’d rather gnaw off his own arm.  He was about to hysterically threaten it when Stovok paused suddenly, clarity in his smooth shoulders.
He swallowed hard and opened his eyes.  The naked curiosity on Tony’s face was unexpected, and grounding.
Steve wanted to say that daylight was burning and lives were at stake, but only half of that statement was true.  “All right,” he insisted, because he would not watch them waste the day away forever.  “Get down.”
Like a mole that had lived its entire life in utter darkness, without friend in the world and in constant latent fear of being devoured, Bruce ventured away from his door, tiptoed into the shared space, and clasped Steve’s hand in both his own with such emphatic warmth that Steve felt guilty for not offering it sooner.  Then Bruce collected his new key and himself and departed quite briskly.  Thor never even turned.
Tony rasped, “J.A.R.V.I.S., lights out.”  As the room dimmed to near-perfect darkness, an ethereal blue glow smoked out from underneath the thin blankets, radiating from the center of Tony’s chest.
The monster loomed at his back, strong enough to drag him away, if the monster chose.  Tony hunched inward, wounded.
Steve did not rise to the bait, sitting on the sand, blue Actinium half-buried next to him, luxuriating in the warmth.
Tony nodded once, then tilted to rest his head on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve rested his own cheek against the top of Tony’s head.
And last but not least, this is the car they are currently driving, since it has finally become relevant in the narrative:
Almost gently, Stovok laid a hand on his knee, keeping the touch oddly delicate, not gripping so much as resting there, and explained patiently, “Kissing is only on the mouth.”
doesn’t mean I didn’t kick ass in extraterrestrial topography.  All mountains come from somewhere.  That one—”  He pointed at the hill, “Comes from a hot spot.  Huge, standalone, cone-shaped pile of rock?  That’s a stratovolcano if I’ve ever seen one.”  After a brief pause, he mused, “You think they’re aware of the danger?”
“Stark says we’re not soldiers,” Steve said gruffly, surprised that he was bringing it up, in the broad light of day.  It was as easy as taking a puff on a cigarette to add, “What do you call a guy that dives into a firefight wearing a suit of armor?”
Don't worry, "Roscoe" won't alter the overall fast-and-loose style of the narrative, but I felt he would be critical in a big city like Chicago, particularly with a--particular--client like Tony, who needs his espresso hot. He's basically greasing the levers for this particular sequence.
I'm back! Sorry, champs, didn't mean to leave you hanging. 🐼❤️ Updates might be sporadic for a few days, as I have family coming in town, but I still hope to write at least a few installments! Thanks so much for the support, you guys are a treasure!
Almost, because, about three-quarters of the way through the increasingly peaceable talks between Liaison Hill and the Ba’ku, Thor suddenly stood up and roared in fury, “The mark of the Gorn.  It is gone!”
He barely recognized his own wide-eyed visage in the mirror, a haunted ghostly specter, half-dead already, but the hot water flushed color back into his cheeks.  He rinsed out his mouth, even lathered up his face, shaving off the stubble.  The grim specter still looked back at him, but it was less severe, consoled.  Nothing like hot water and a good clean shave to make one feel new again, Steve thought.
In a slightly choked-up voice, Tony managed, “I can’t believe your stupid schmucky chivalry ruined my PSA.”
Steve looked at Clint, lying on the floor, hands folded over his chest and a concentrating frown on his face, and then the others, all piled around Thor, all watching the tiny telephone intently.
,” Tony wheezed, ten minutes later, as Steve pulled the bowl away from him, gave it a couple good mixes with a spatula for good measures, and ignored Tony wagging the eggbeater after him tauntingly.  “I am the world’s most athletic
“It’s not the Romanov palace,” Tony conceded, looking at her with a mixture of playful defiance and wary alertness, caught in her trap.  “But this is the Rockefeller Center of the Gold Coast.”
With a beleaguered groan, Tony swiped a broomstick leaning against the wall and approached.  “Drop the vac, Cap.”  He prodded Steve in the back with the business end of the broom.  The clicking stopped.
“Nothin’,” Tony said, but he popped the car door open and stepped outside.  Steve followed.  It was still raining, but the headlights illuminated a clear set of overlapping tracks in the road.
“Get your slimy germ-infested paws off me,” Tony said, long after Steve had gotten his slimy, germ-infested paws off him, and retrieved the actual flour bowl from the cabinets.  Whistling a distracting tune, Tony interrupted himself to add, “Do you cook?  A lot?  Is cooking your thing?  Should I sign you up for
Tony huffed.  “Rather take my chances up top,” he said, thumbing Thor, who was also, Steve noticed, looking at the sky.
Steve caught him by the shoulders, boiling to throttle the truth outta him, but he kept himself perfectly still, barely even gripping Tony.
, that Stovok could be dead, no matter the odds stacked against him, but Klingons had killed more than their fair share of Starfleet officers.  It could happen to anyway.  Even Stovok.
, but Steve ignored it, picking up Thor’s abandoned pamphlet and folding it neatly back onto the rack.  He heard a whistle nearby, looked up, and saw Clint lingering in the doorway to the gas station.  Warily, Steve joined him.
!  If you go to the Hamilton monument, you’ve gone too far.  On second thought,” he added to Steve, “why do I care?  They know where we live.”  At Bruce’s inquiring look from afar, Tony waved him on and shouted, “Doing great!  Keep it up, champ!”  Bruce nervously pivoted and resumed moving briskly away.  Steve wondered if Bruce’s goal was not to get out of sight and out of mind.
Neither of them came with intent to harm.  Why he had the ferocious urge to lash out at them was—not their problem.  He drew in a deep breath and held it.  His team was in danger.  His team was in danger.
Snow looked at him a moment longer, then looked beyond him.  He did not turn to see Steve, instead venturing further into the space.
“You mean Romulan blood?”  Thump.  Thump.  Thump.  “That copper stuff that flows through your veins, Cadet?  And what does it tell you?  What sort of warmongering do these people thirst for?  What sort of war do
Howdy, champs. Sorry for the delay. 🐼❤️ Been a rough week. I have uncontrollable tachycardia that was exacerbated by a recent trip to the ER. End result: one unhappy bear! I'm still recovering, but I was finally in a good enough place to sit down and write. I didn't push myself, but since it is impossible for me to know when I will make a full recovery, I wanted to proceed cautiously once I felt able to.
Assisting with damage control, Steve offered Tony a hand up and helped pick the candles before Thor could eat any more.  Thor still managed to sneak a few into his mouth defiantly, but the bulk made it to the trash.
“I heard ya,” Steve said, relenting.  He gave one more shake, cold and wet but plenty awake, before ordering mulishly, “Let’s go.  C’mon.  Day ain’t getting any younger.”
“Yes.”  Scooping up an armful of snow, Steve crumpled it into a ball and forcefully shooed Tony behind himself.  “
promotional line.  So funny.  He scratched the shirt over the metal parasite and wondered if it had a mind of its own.
“My love for them remains undiminished,” Thor said.  “I confess a certain envy for your collection, Stark.”
“No—no problem,” Peter said.  “Uh, don’t mention it.  Unless you want to.”  Belatedly: “Happy Birthday, Mr. America.”
, to snap its neck.  The Python suit looked at Tony expectantly.  Tony pinched his brow.  “Look, he has
“This ain’t exactly brisk.”  With a sigh, Steve nevertheless slowed his pace.  “Why didn’t you bring your suit?”
Another laugh wheezed out of Tony, loudly enough a few of the outlying Gorn looked at him, then looked back at the roaring main attraction.  Six Gorn together could not pull the Hirogen down for long, but they cheered each other on.
Tony thought of Dr. Banner, who hated space—for reasons that ranged from “it’s a death trap” to “it’s a
Steve recognized his own bike and could easily match Tony’s tire tread, but the third car stood out.  “Romanoff?” he guessed.
Full of sharp edges, worn down to the bone, and still, at his core, yearning to live, to enjoy life.
Missed you beautiful folks! I have been busy with *my* folks. Now that things are back to normal, I'm happy to come back to this fic!
Bruce gave him a wary look, but he led them down a long, dark hallway, pausing midway in front of a glass case.
Bruce approached the base, picked up the ball, and glanced fearfully at Thor.  When Thor stood his ground by home, Bruce walked the ball over to Steve and Clint.  Gently, he touched the ball to Clint’s shoulder.  “You’re out,” Bruce said, very politely.
Bruce looked at him, then jumped a little, as though surprised to see him, before nodding in vague agreement.  He gathered up his shirt, shrugged it on, and padded barefoot into the hallway.  Steve just hoped he could find the room all right.
Steve gave him a squeeze of approval.  Tony made a sound like he wanted to comment but decided against it at the last moment.
“You also bought Bruce one,” Steve reminded, doing his best to suppress the immediate fondness that welled up inside him at the mere mention of baby Ginger.
“That is factually incorrect,” Stovok murmured, concentrating on the art, a tiny furrow in his brow.  “Dragons are not real.”
, he promised himself, every painstaking hour, every grueling moment spent drifting between hopeless agony and determined recovery.
Shaking his head, Tony just kept laughing in inexpressible amusement.  Steve sighed, but he did not seem particularly put out, even as Tony finally calmed himself and drew in a breath, coughed once.  “You’re just—a really big dork,” Tony managed, by way of explanation, not having the heart or courage to say,
.  That’s wonderful.  That is . . . exactly the kind of person I want you to be, the kind of person I want to be with.”
