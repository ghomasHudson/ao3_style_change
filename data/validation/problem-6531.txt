They all got in the car and Tony started it. The motor made a few weird sounds, simmered a little and then died. Tony tried again, but nothing happened. Again and again, but the motor wouldn’t start.
Steve smiled, for real this time, as he put his hand over his pocket. 'I'd love to. I'll give you a call when I get back.'
'Yeah, go ahead! Warn them that you're coming, but go whenever you like,' Tony said. They were at the door and Steve stepped through it. Tony couldn't keep his eyes up and quickly glanced at the perfect ass.
Steve shrugged. 'I haven't seen you fight. The armor looks impressive, but I could stop you when you sneaked up on me. I'd have to see what your suit can do first.'
Tony aimed the repulsors in his gloves at one spot and shot. White light came out of his hands and it hit the invisible wall hard. For a few seconds it looked like the wall lit up green, but it was immediately gone again. Tony shot again. The green showed again, except for the spot where Tony had hit it.
Steve’s eyes widened. ‘Seventy years?’ he asked, before sighing deeply. ‘Great, seventy years and now they want me to be someone’s bodyguard. But I’d like to see some of the world again. I’m going with you.’
Steve showed him his three paintings. Bucky admired them for a few minutes, asking some questions, before they fixed the lightning. When everything looked absolutely perfect they went home to change.
Tony started stroking Steve's hair, until he realized it was a wig and the man in his arms couldn't really feel it. Instead he started babbling. He was really good at talking about nothing. It distracted his three colleagues a little. They couldn't act too stiff or their cover would be blown. They couldn't let that happen, not now that Olivia was prepared to testify!
'You know I'm from Mexico,' Olivia started. 'There was a drug war going on in the city where I lived. A lot of my friends were killed, my family members were killed. My sister and I were the only ones left, so we tried to escape. There was a man who would take us across the border and give us new passports. I paid him all the money we had.'
Tony flew up and started hitting the robot with his repulsors. Nothing happened. From the top of the building Clint shot two explosive arrows at the crawling machine, but they hardly damaged the steel shield of the robot. Neither of the two heroes could get through the exterior layer, no matter what they tried.
They were interrupted by a girl who was on her own and who would go on the same cave tour as the two of them. She was glad to finally find some Americans, it was like all tourists their age were either Dutch or German. The girl herself was from Spain and explained that she had been without a job for a long time, so she went on a trip. Afterwards she'd try to find work in Australia. Tony watched as Steve talked with the girl and cracked a few jokes, but he was glad when she walked away again.
'You're Captain America?' Tony asked. Now that he was looking up, he also noticed the shield that stood next to Steve's bag on the chair.
'Our undercover acts are too good!' Tony chuckled. 'It's nice to meet you, Stefanie. What are you researching here?'
Tony had made his way back to his tower, using the platform outside of the penthouse to land, because he was not going to face those people on the ground floor again. He grabbed a bag, made a call to prepare his plane and picked two of his Iron Man suits that could handle the cold. He filled the bag with warm clothes and some interesting technical stuff and threw it all on the backseat of his car. His driver was already waiting for him in the passenger seat. Tony always drove his own cars, but he needed someone to drive his baby back when he got on the plane.
Steve had gotten over most of his health problems. He got better and stronger, while his mother got sicker and weaker.
'Yes,' Steve answered. He already felt his blush coming back. Not because the guy had found him or that he was touching him, but because he recognized him, now that he was wearing a suit. It was billionaire businessman Tony Stark.
'We were going to see the glow worms in the caves, if you still want to,' Steve said. 'I already found a tour I want to do, but I'd like it if you'd join me.'
‘I know you still have a crush on her,’ Steve said, looking back at his newspaper. ‘And I know Natasha is amazing, but do you really think it was Clint who pulled that revenge prank on us? Nat was the mastermind behind it.’
Shit, of course there had been an alarm. A silent alarm. This had all been too easy, of course it wasn’t easy to get into Tony fucking Stark’s penthouse! He should have just grabbed the laptop, he should have just left immediately. He would probably still get caught, but now he was going to jail for eating someone’s bananas! Steve swallowed his bite. There was only one thing he could try: he would make this guy pity him. If Stark would feel sorry for him he might get away with this.
'More feminine than I had expected,' Bucky said, surprised. 'You look really good. You'll have to learn to run in those things, because those guys will all want a piece of you.'
'Not a liar then,' Ronan smirked. 'So, why does a pretty boy like you want to work here? You do know we have a gentleman's club too? You can use your own pretty face and body. I'm sure they'd love you there.'
'Hello handsome,' he said to Tony. 'Long time no see.  You've got your eyes on Julia, don't you? Wasn't I good enough for you?'
'For now, Brooklyn boy,' Tony grinned back. 'You return in a month or so. Let's meet up in New York. Visit my place, I'll show you what vacation means to me!' He put his card in Steve's chest pocket.
‘Me too,’ James answered. He bent forward and pressed a short kiss on Steve’s lips. Steve was too stunned to say or do something, but James didn’t seem to care. ‘I’ll call you. I really want to see you again soon.’
Tony helped Steve and pulled the bikes aside as well. He was mumbling to himself, but Steve heard him anyway.
It was one of the saddest memories Tony had. He and Steve had walked around like zombies for weeks. They fought a lot and argued all the time, but they worked it out. They didn't want to lose each other as well. When they finally sat down and talked about it they found out that they didn't have many reasons left to stay in New York anymore, so they had moved to their place in Malibu permanently. There they could forget about things and figure out how to be happy again.
Steve worked at the club for two weeks and he managed to become Olivia's friend. They lived in the same neighborhood and walked to work together. Steve also walked Olivia home in the middle of the night. Olivia was a small guy and a tall bodyguard like Steve made him feel safe. They had gotten pretty close already and Steve believed he could soon ask some more personal questions. But before he could do that he had his own problems to worry about.
Olivia was laughing out loud now. 'He's gay, no straight guy would feel comfortable around guys in drag. You should give it a try. Take off the fake tits and show him what you've got. He'll fall in love with you and you'll live happily ever after!'
‘You will be given a home, here in New York. You can train in our facilities and study here. Ask for whatever you need and you will get it. Money is not a problem. I heard you used to have a motor bike, so we will get you one, or a car, if you prefer. We’re not telling the public yet that you are Captain America though, so keep a low profile for a while, get used to this age. When we need you, the press will find out about you soon enough and we’ll tell them a story that they will believe. We found some rare footage of the forties with you in it and some documents that speak of the serum that is used on you. Speaking of it, we made you a new suit. Here is your contract. Take it, read it, and I expect it back by tomorrow, either with your signature, or with a note about the things you want changed. Any questions?
Bruce was there for the science part of the project. He was not only Tony's colleague, but also his friend. He was the only one who understood Tony when he was on one of his sciency rants.
The three men around Steve were taken away by their colleagues. They were frisked at the door before they were allowed to go. Steve had pushed his hair aside and watched them go. One by one all the guys were leaving. All those guys Steve had seen so many times. It felt a bit surreal that it was over now, after two months it was over. He wasn't surprised when some of the guys were caught with drugs.
‘Oh my God,’ Clint groaned. ‘You didn’t hear all of it, did you?  Because he wasn’t talking about you, he was talking about himself.’
Natasha had told Clint to get Tony. They needed help from someone who knew about robots and Tony was an expert. Iron Man would also be pretty helpful in destroying the thing. Clint used his usual vent climbing to get inside Stark Tower and found Tony, as always, in his workshop. On one of his screens the news was showing. The moment Tony spotted Clint he turned off the television.
'Sam, I didn't get a single complaint about you. You communicated well, you used everyone's best qualities and you caught Ronan. You did great and I will let Fury know about that. You could replace me anytime.'
Steve looked at the comic and his eyes widened at the title: Captain America. He looked through the pages and saw how a blond man in a uniform that looked a lot like his was saving people’s lives.
'Okay, what about we make Stefanie talk about this to at least one of the guys,' Rhodey suggested. 'So we know a little more. But we have to make sure none of them escape when we get in there.'
‘I’m just happy for you!’ Rhodey defended himself. ‘So, what is the name of the guy who stole Tony stark’s heart?’
‘Nope,’ answered Steve, popping the p. ‘I usually celebrate with my best friend. He found himself a girlfriend this summer, so today he is meeting his in laws for the first time. Honestly, I’d rather work the Christmas eve shift than meeting my in laws on an important night like this.’
'Wow, how do you get your eyeliner like that?!' Lauren suddenly asked. Steve almost hit his eye instead of the lid, but he stayed calm and showed his new friend what he did.
'Yeah, did he have sex with you, because he only wanted to talk to me,' Julia said, disbelief in his voice.
Steve tilted his head and kissed the palm of Tony’s hand, clasping his own hand over Tony’s. Tony wet his lips and started to shuffle, adjusting the way he was led. Steve flushed a soft pink, stomach lifting into his chest as the ends of his fingers began to tingle with anticipation.
“And something men continuously seem to think is that sheer size is a measure for ability. Don’t get me wrong, yes, they’re all very,
Steve collapsed like a rag-doll, as if the strings holding him up had been slashed, he dropped to the floor and made no motion of getting up.
They had all been ridiculously tired and hurt - Tony assumed the only chance of it still being dark when he woke up was if he slept until the next evening, which it definitely was not. No way would the others have let him sleep that long, they enjoy distrusting his sleep far too much.
God, if he could wake up in a world where they’d finally, finally gotten rid of Hydra, he might be able to walk around with a lighter weight on his shoulders.
“-okay, but we’re in the middle of nowhere, and with what we have to hand, I doubt anything I could make from it would reach far enough, we have no satellite dishes or anything to transmit a strong enough frequency-”
When they descended the stairs into the kitchen in the morning, they were met by a sea of mischievous smiles.
“Wait,” she whispered in a low tone, sticking her hand out at the same time, making a stop gesture to Bucky. Buck crouched down low upon seeing the scene in front of them, as if readying himself, monitoring the situation before him.
“The thought of losing you because you were saving me that kills me, Tony. Why didn’t you think of-?”
For all the ex-Hydra group’s efforts, they hadn’t exactly thought through who they’d kidnapped: a pair of highly-skilled superheroes both with a frankly gleaming reputation as escape artists. They spend the first day recovering and trying to get their bearings, and the second observing the guard’s schedules. By the third day in their grimy cell - somewhere they could only assume was in the North of Canada if their view from the tiny barred window was anything to go by (
“He tried to kill us, remember?” Bucky eyed Steve carefully. Steve looked sharply at Bucky, stopping himself from snapping when he noticed the calculating look Bucky was casting his way.
“I’m sorry, Steve, I’m so, so sorry you wouldn’t believe - that rhymed, sorry, I’m not trying to be clever of whatever -
The other members of the team hadn’t seen it. Tony hadn’t let any photos be leaked of him shirtless after Afghanistan, which was actually rather easy, since he barely took his shirt off at home, let alone in public. Quite frankly, Tony preferred it that way - he already felt like he was the weak link of the bunch, the liability, in some ways. He didn’t need to give them all another reason to think less of him. He wouldn’t be able to stand that look on Steve’s face.
“Yeah… I’ve really not wanted to admit it to myself, but…” Steve paused. “Wait, you said they’re not together - how do you know that? Did they tell you they weren’t?”
The others had all stripped down to their bathing suits - even Bruce, usually more reserved, exposing an impressive amount of chest hair.
“Clint, get back to ground level and meet Sam, you two help with recon, I need your eyes down here for an civilians who might need medical attention - check under collapsed buildings and debris,” Nat surged round a corner, skidding on the ball of her foot - noticing Barnes on her tail, “Thor and Hulk are detailing Doom, once you’re done, help get him into confinement for interrogation later - James and I are closing in on Cap and Tony.”
They were hovered round Clint’s dining room table, freshly patched up after a few days rest on the farm. Laura was as welcoming as ever, not caring in the slightest when she interrupted a highly-confidential briefing, or a potentially fatal sparring session outside in her barn, pitchers of home-made lemonade in hand.
After hastily retrieving the data they had come for, they withdrew to the quinjet. The jet wasn’t much better off than they were, and in the mist of the battle, they hadn’t noticed a one piece of critical information.
Natasha gave a confirming nod and slipped out the door, ready to track down Steve and Bucky to relay the information. They’d need them there to defend the room.
“I don’t care what any of y'all say, I’m not using a damn rug as a blanket. Dibs on the red one.” Sam declared, and Natasha plucked the red blanket  from the pile tossed it in Sam’s direction.
He thought back to just a few days earlier, after Tony and Nat returned from their brunch outing and called him down to the workshop. Tony had been sat on top of one of the workbenches, while Nat was leaning back precariously in a chair, casually cleaning her nails with the tip of a bayonet.
They hadn’t bothered to check in with the cabin at the front of the site with the large ‘reception’ sign hanging off it. Sure, they’d pay for it and then some afterwards, but they had to assume they were still being pursued or even at risk of facing a separate ambush if anyone else were to realise that two Avengers were vulnerable and alone. So checking into a guest book didn’t really scream ‘good idea’.
Sam made an immoral snorting noise before erupting into laughter while Nat demanded to know who kept showing Thor memes.
a small voice at the back of his mind substituted), when Tony quietly got up and wandered over to one of the dubious looking chairs around the table at the back. The smaller man sat down quietly, chair creaking ominously but staying put, and Tony undid the zip if his undersuit, clearly looking for something underneath.
wounds you,” she said, gesturing to the blade with a nod of her head, all while perching on the end of the medical bed by his feet, “You’re an idiot, by the way, Stark. Strangling Doom? Not your best plan of action.”
The room was lit warmly by the light coming from the lounge and a few floor lamps, casting a peachy glow over the two men.
“So, if they’re treating it as a top priority, so are we?” Rhodes questioned, nodding his head in approval when Steve gave an affirmative nod.
Clint was egging them on, Bruce looking thoroughly amused, while Rhodey tried to get around Nat. Tried being the keyword. Eventually, she just turned and picked Tony up herself. With her truly freakish strength was able to hold the genius with one arm under his thighs as he wrapped his legs around her waist, a shit-eating grin pointed his best friend’s way.
Steve hummed in response, losing his own fight at keeping an embarrassing smile off his face. It was worth it though, when Tony let a similar one cross his features, rolling his eyes, and cupping Steve’s face in his hands, cradling his head tenderly.
Steve was clad in just sweatpants, while Tony had thrown on a pair of boxer shorts and a shirt much too large for him that it almost fit him like a dress. It was pretty adorable.
Stretching out his muscles, Steve looked over to the other side of the gym, watching as Tony and Nat pushed each other around, laughing and goofing around while they waited for the rest of the team to get there.
And given that Steve had been kissing the life out of him in the kitchen a few hours ago, he was fairly certain it was mutual.
Tony tried to feign nonchalance, rubbing his hand through his messy hair – it was starting to curl at the nape of his neck, Steve noted absently.
“I’m an Avenger too, fatal injury or no fatal injury!” Tony called out to Thor’s retreating form, who turned mid walk, grinning at him,
Clint and Tony got into their stances, before the archer made a quick-pace forward, striking out at his opponent. To his credit, Tony made a very sharp dodge - precise even. The next time Clint made that manoeuvre, Tony not only dodged it again, but locked Clint’s outstretched arm in a hold and managed to swing Clint to the side. Of course, the archer rolled with the movement elegantly, landing in a crouched position and looking up at the genius, surprise adorning his features.
, earlier - on the jet, I was conscious enough to see what happened, what happened to you, and I-” Steve seemed to think carefully about his next words, swallowing the lump in his throat and licking his bottom lip, avoiding Tony’s gaze. Not that Tony was looking at Steve either.
Plus the occasional laugh from Thor, though even those were now somewhat empty, not filled with their usual mirth.
Steve was led on the ice, unmoving but hyper-aware of his surroundings. In his line of sight, Tony was straddling an agent, both of whom were frozen mid-scramble. Natasha raised her gun, reading herself to take the shot if the agent tried anything smart, when the ice cracked - echoing around the small valley they were in, before crunching and collapsing, dropping Tony and the lackey into the inky-black waters below.
go on the offensive, he relied on the moves Happy had taught him a long time ago - boxing, mixed martial arts, that sort of thing.
“The only way Cap could get close enough is if the guy thought he was dead,” Bucky tried to explain.
it. Bucky and Clint were sitting on the floor with their backs to the sofas despite there being more than enough room - they seemed to like having the room to stretch out. Rhodey happily occupied the space that left him to put his feet up, with Bruce curled up in the corner. Thor and Sam were chatting about ‘the good bit’ that was coming up, piling popcorn into their mouths unable to look away from the screen.
’. Steve noticed, pulling Tony closer to his body and brushing a hand through his hair - it was getting long now, he noted, flopping over his eyes half the time.
back at him as he leant on the edge of the kitchen counter, a pan sizzling in front of him. Bruce was already sitting at the kitchen island, herbal tea by his elbow as he read through an ornately decorated book.
Tony stares after her, bewildered and disgusted at how efficient she was even hungover, before Rhodey snapping  his fingers together to get his friend’s attention back.
Steve dropped his gun to the ground, ignoring Bucky’s frustrated groan. Despite this, the other man let his weapon fall to the ground with a clunk. Natasha made no sign I moving.
Moments ago, it had been just playful banter – nothing too complex or witty, they were all too tired for that.
Tony barked out a surprised laugh at that, wincing as he jolted his ribs - an icepack bound loosely around his chest with bandages to hold it in place while he busied himself with Nat’s leg. “Did you seriously call me a bitch? I’ve never heard you call anyone
“You ran on this leg, didn’t you?” Bruce chastised, having settled down in front of her with a far more technical first-aid kit in hand than the one in the cabin.
Clint openly smiled at Tony, approaching him and pulling an arm round his shoulders. “He ain’t lying, babe, he’s kinda weird like that. Likes pulling things apart and sticking them back together - it’s his thing, just go with it,” he whispered sarcastically, earning a snort from Tony.
“Yes, because I’m excellent at it. You on the other hand, well-” she he turned playfully to his current state.
“Yah?” the brunette bit out tensely, trying to pass off nonchalance, but wincing at himself for saying
The team stood in the doorway, poking their heads through at different angles comically, grinning at the pair.
“…right?” Tony winced, before shooting out of his seat when Bucky lunged at him from across the table, much to Thor’s delight, as he boomed with laughter.
, a voice in his head sing-songed. As always, he pushed it down, but for how much longer he could do that even he wasn’t sure.
Doom screamed in either agony or fury - hopefully both - clawing at the fatal wound to his gut, charred black around the edges. The smell of burning flesh filled Tony’s senses, and he felt a wave of nausea roll over him.
Steve didn’t look pleased by this, but ignored the comment in leu of the current situation. Like the fact they’ve probably been found by hydra, who’s forces are currently trying to ambush them.
Tony quirked his lips and sighed dramatically, “Oh America’s golden boy, we didn’t stop being a family. Families argue and threaten to kill each other, it’s all very normal.”
Steve was there, wrestling three agents off his back. One agent deliver a swift jab to his gut, only slightly making Steve double over, before he delivered a far more devastating uppercut to the hydra goon’s chin, knocking him out cold. Steve then grappled with the agent over his back, trying to crush his windpipe with the rifle he was carrying. Steve got a grip on the rifle and tossed his attacker over his shoulders, where the guy landed in a graceless pile at Steve’s feet. Scrambling for a handgun, the agent was cut short with a swift step to the neck from Steve.
And those eyes were gazing at his. Steve felt a spark in his belly, the sudden dryness of his mouth - a metallic clang rung from below them, and the two men shot up and aimed their guns at the door, which creaked before swinging open, revealing Bucky’s plain expression.
“The site in Siberia was put on lockdown by the UN, theres no way Hydra can infiltrate it - no one has clearance to enter the premises,” Natasha prompted, arms folded as she leant over the wooden table they were all seated around.
“Your dreams, huh?” Steve teased, pressing another quick kiss against Tony’s lips. “And no, no this is something I’ve been wanting -
“Detonate the others” Doom seethed through gritted teeth. Tony watched as Doom gave him one last murderous look, before the bot took off in flight, far away from the current battleground.
Natasha tossed him a look that screamed really, and crouched down next to her friend. Sam took it as his cue to get back in the water, muttering something about thinking this kind of thing would be over after high school.
'You have to practice your undercover skills,' Steve chuckled as he sat down as well and took off his heels. 'But you did okay. Did you notice anything about the other...employees?'
'No, you'll be infiltrating as prostitutes,' Fury butted in, effectively stopping their chatter. 'We'll be working at two different clubs. Club Venus is a place with female prostitutes and The Aurora is one with males dressed as females. Bruce calculated that we’ll have the biggest chance with these places. Rogers, you will go undercover, Wilson, you will monitor him. Follow his every step. Cameras, microphones, I want it all recorded.'
He was practically sleeping when the water moved. Tony opened his eyes and found Steve sitting next to him. There were a few others in the pool now, a few kids who were splashing around. Probably the reason why Steve got out.
They talked more about the things Steve had seen and done on his trip and the very few things Tony had seen as they finished their pizza. They walked back to the campsite where Steve dug through his bag and fished out swimming trunks and a towel.
'He's real! He's fucking real!' Tony said. He got up from his chair and got his hands all over the shield. It was an amazing thing and nothing alike was ever made after this.
‘Ugh,’ Steve groaned. ‘Does it even matter? You’re not planning on going out with him, so just give him a call and say Sunday is not going to work out for you and that it probably will never work out for you and that you don’t wanna see him anymore, but I don’t want anything to do with this anymore.’
'I'm glad you tried, Tony,' Steve said as he packed his clothes. 'I know you care. But I will get to share a room with Bucky, so I guess it's not that bad. I'll be alright.'
'I know mister Stark is different from a lot of other guys, so I made something different. This I pumpkin bread with ginger and cinnamon,' the girl said proudly.
‘Alright,’ Tony groaned. ‘You guys aren’t used to anything. I stay awake for forty-eight hours all the time. But whatever, we’ll sleep.’
‘Not really, but if I was drunk that might make sense,’ Tony said. ‘What do you want from me then? I’m still not building you a suit of flying armor, if that’s what you’re here for. If I ever create flying armor it’s for me, not for you. You’re a pilot, you can already fly.’
'I don't know, I tried to contact the guy, but he doesn't pick up his phone,' Sam explained. 'Back up team is looking for him. Someone else is on the way. Don't sleep with the guy Steve! Just let him know you're a cop, threaten him if necessary, so he won't talk! I can send Maria to get him and lock him up!'
'I have to bake?' Tony asked, fear in his eyes. 'I promised that? On television? No, no, no this must be a mistake! I don't even know how to turn the oven on! I'm not going to make a fool of myself on television again! Tell them I'm too busy.'
‘Whatever you want, ancient man,’ Steve answered before they got themselves a glass of wine. The two of them went back to the paintings. It didn’t take long before the two were a giggling mess. Tony made funny remarks about every single piece, and Steve just couldn’t stop himself from laughing. They both ignored the bothered looks from other people and just enjoyed themselves. Steve couldn’t have dreamed that this night was actually going to be fun. Before he knew it they were announcing that the gallery was closing down for the night.
'Some of you disappointed me today,' Buddy said. 'Some of you surprised me. We had two challenges, it’s time for an elimination. One of you is going home.'
Tony Stark lived a perfectly happy life in his big tower in New York. He had his own company that was doing great, he was a super hero and saved the world every now and then, and he had great friends, coworkers, and lovers. Life was amazing!
‘I seriously hate you right now,’ Steve said as he buttoned his shirt. He looked more casual than last time, they were just going to a coffee shop, no need to look all formal and neat.
For a long time it looked like Steve had been right. They were very much in love, still were, after all these years, but Steve also didn't seem to get older. When he was 35 people thought he was 25. They had been called trophy wife and cougar hundreds of times. It had only made Steve laugh and joke back that he was really into older guys. Technically Tony was older. Just a year, but still.
‘Well, I’m very glad to see that you’re so healthy,’ Pepper said as she looked at him from head to toe.
'Anthony, you're eighteen now,' the king spoke. 'You're too old and too smart to spend all your time outside, doing whatever you're doing out there. It's time to grow up. Starting next week you'll take over a few of my jobs and we have found a perfect girl for you. You two will marry next year. She'll be here to meet you next Saturday.'
'No, sadly not, I survived,' Tony laughed. 'But I got to see you in a wetsuit, that was a nice surprise.'
‘Me too,’ Steve said, as he watched James get in his car and drive off. It was getting more chilly outside, but Steve didn’t notice it when he walked home. The warmth in his chest spread through his entire body and it was the best feeling in the world.
‘So we know where we can get out again,’ he explained as he stripped off most of his clothes. It was incredibly warm with all the lava. ‘Not bad for a sidekick, right?’
Or maybe not. He could convince Steve somehow that the ass touching was just another eccentric billionaire thing. That it was his way of paying compliments. That he slapped everyone's asses when they did something good. It had to become a thing!
Tony Stark, genius billionaire, and owner of a multinational company, couldn't focus on his meeting. That wasn't anything new, everyone knew he was easily distracted and preferred working in his workshop over offices and paperwork. But this meeting was about his project, his baby, yet he couldn't focus.
'Of course I knew,' Fury said. 'You wouldn't have believed me if I told you though. Romanoff is one of ours. It's true that she could get out, but the Captain couldn't. The wall had to be destroyed for that. Long story that I’m not going to tell you now. I only found that out a week ago and you were the cheapest option to go and get him.'
It took a few seconds for Tony to realize what Pepper had said, but when it hit him, she was already gone. That woman always knew everything!
Tony went home long after midnight and he felt better than he had ever felt in his life. He hadn't been able to get any flirting done with Steve, Sam was there all the time, but the two guys were just super nice to him and treated him like he was not Tony Stark. They didn't ask about money, affairs or his company, not even the reason why he lived in a tiny house like this. They asked about his games, robots and experience with different flavored beers. They even paid for his pizza.
'Alright, alright, I'll leave you two love birds alone and drink my coffee at home,' Tony said. 'I'll sleep after that, like a good boy. Sam, you'll get your cup back tomorrow. Bye Steve!'
'Thanks, nice to meet you, Lauren,' Steve said with a bright smile, before he quickly changed into his dress. He didn’t forget his mission though. The guys didn't look like they were forced, but when he put his make up on, Steve noticed some of the guys had something tattooed on their arm. It looked like a hammer. Steve couldn’t see from this distance, but he could see they all looked  alike. He had to look into this. It was a lead!
Tony looked gorgeous under the beating sun. His normally perfectly styled hair was messy and plastered down his face, curling over his sparking eyes. His skin was golden and tan, and looked irresistible to touch- smoothly running down his muscular yet lean figure, which sloped gorgeously at his ass. Steve felt a wave of warmth run down his body, pooling in his gut, and he resisted the urge to break the distance between them.
When they left the store, Steve started to turn right, to head down the main street this time round rather than waste a quarter of an hour trailing through dingy alleyways. Steve stopped, however, when he didn’t see Tony walking beside him.
“Back at you, Cap,” and with that, Steve got up and wandered over to the others, giving Tony a pat on the shoulder as he went by.
Daylight was starting the break over the horizon, illuminating the snow outside, casting a soft glow into the cabin.
Tony hopped onto the edge of the counter as the kettle boiled, legs swinging slightly. Steve leant back against the counter opposite, making a
“I worked in the circus and fall into garbage cans more times a month than anyone else does in their lifetime. And I fight aliens and shit with you lot. My bar for what qualifies as stupid is really fucking high, Cap.”
“You should know the right techniques, the correct application for any opponent. Being smaller is not a weakness, it can be an asset if you utilize it properly.”
Bruce trotted down a few seconds later, looking no different than normal except for his shirt sleeves being pushed up to the elbows and his shoes looking slightly more ventilated. Rhodey emerged looking as similar as Steve and the others had, and Tony showed up dressed in a white shirt with the first few buttons popped open, revealing granted skin underneath. His pants were a light grey, and hugged his form nicely - causing Steve to become suddenly very interested with the floor.
“Hydra is adamant this vault exists, they’re even betting all their resources on it, so thats enough to earn our attention. The idea’d been laughed at before, but I’ve go a funny feelin’ that its a bit too familiar to when the US was laughing at Schmidt for believing in Norse Gods,” the blonde said, earning the attention of the room.
“Under whose instructions?” The man challenged. He wore a similar get-up to standard agents, but was without a helmet and appeared to have some kind of merits adorning his jacket. Ah, so a Nazi with brownie points, must be fairly high ranked here, she thought.
Tony lost track of how long he was doing this, performing it like a ritual, like it was his religion, before he took in a final mouthful of oxygen. Tony himself was beginning to feel lightheaded, the space they occupied becoming scarcer of oxygen and filling with ash and debris. Nonetheless, Tony persisted and breathed for Steve again and again until-
Steve sighed, having expected this conversation. Since the coming together after the accords, the divide among the team had never felt more clear. It cut deep, and God if it wasn’t painful. The way they physically broke off from each other in missions.
Tony had paused, fist frozen mid-air, and the agent’s eyes were blown wide and startled. Steve only had a moment to realise what was happening; the deep echoing crack underneath them, and a split in the ice coming from under his body, headed like a bold of electricity towards the fight I front of him.
“What sane person likes clowns, Steve? Clowns – imagine waking up in the middle of the night and seeing that-!”
stop giving up every time you don’t get something perfect the first time around, I can actually teach you how to use your opponent’s strength
Nat was quiet for a moment before she got to her feet and stood in front of Tony. Determined, she grabbed his wrists and pulled him up so they stood eye-to-eye. He gave a small smirk, but rather than exuding his usual charm, it just seemed so uncharacteristically unsure.
Steve found that, for the first time since the accords, he fell asleep with a warmth embracing his body, and the weight on his shoulders didn’t feel so bad.
The team had faced Doombots before, but not like this. They were far more advanced than their last encounter; made of reinforced vibranium, Doom’s robotic lackeys became just that much more difficult to take out.
Sure, Steve had been aware of that the moment he met the other man on the Helicarrier - despite their first introductions being relatively bitter.
“A functional person can just, you know, ask a person out on a date instead of kinda-” he pulled an awkward face, flailing his hands around, “-pining from afar and being kinda a jerk to the other person when they’re just trying to talk to you.”
Clint listened carefully. Tony didn’t speak about his mother, especially since finding out about her death, the real reason, but she clearly meant the world to him. Tony had gingerly played the piano, and they began to talk, and eventually laugh. They watched movies, Tony spoke about his mom, Clint spoke about his family. One time he mentioned missing being able to come home to family, to hold them when he came home. He lived mostly at the tower for his duty, and he and Laura and agreed that his Avenging life stayed away from their home on the farm - there was to be a regular family, to keep his children safe.
Tony nodded, not really paying attention as he was too busy looking around. He didn't like the arrogant little man, who puffed up his chest to show how important he was. He knew Pepper would laugh at him and say they were too much alike and she would not be talking about how tiny they both were.
They walked to the restaurants and chose the one that served pizza. There were only a few other tourists around, so there was plenty of space. They found a table in the sun and waited for their pizza.
‘I always have some spare clothes in my car,’ Tony explained. ‘The sweatpants are a little too big for me, but they might fit you. The shirt might be a little too small.’
'I think we should sell toolboxes too,' Clint said. 'A box with screwdrivers and a hammer, stuff like that, so the kids can continue their small projects at home. They won't lose interest.'
Tony never minded it much either. He had always been proud of his husband, because he remembered the scrawny kid Steve used to be. He just joked and said he needed someone to keep up with him, someone to keep him young.
‘Yeah, the windows are open and Falcon and Hawkeye are locked in their cage,’ Sam said. ‘Can you help me search for him? Redwing loves to make a nest in your hair. If you go outside with me he’ll probably fly straight at you to sit in your hair. Redwing is a really cool name, by the way. He loves it.’
She showed Steve a huge room, overly decorated in red, pink and gold. There was a small dance floor, a big bar, plenty of tables, chairs and plush couches. All windows were covered with big, red curtains, the walls were decorated with erotic, yet classy, art, and there was a dark wooden floor that looked polished. Since the room was pretty much square, you could see everything from every table. It would be good for observing.
Inside the club things got more serious. Tony had been hanging at the bar for half an hour, but Julia didn't approach him. She kept glancing his way, but found herself some other customers, making it impossible for Tony to talk to her. Of course Steve and his man of the night were both keeping an eye on things and noticed that Julia wasn't approaching Tony. Steve decided to act. He got up, walked to the bar and next to Tony he ordered two drinks.
Sam Wilson was the man who was in charge of the veterans. Most of them had PTSD and came to his group sessions every week. He picked veterans who could handle the work and the kids.
'I can't believe people still think you're innocent when you can say things like that with a straight face,' Bucky groaned. He had been monitoring Steve that night.
‘It’s really too bad your own shirt is still dry though,’ Tony said suddenly. ‘I wouldn’t have minded seeing you in a tiny shirt.’
'Alright, gentlemen, we need to talk to all of you,' Sam said. 'If I call your name, please step forward: Ashley, Tanya, Simone, Cindy and Marilyn.'
Steve looked at the group, but he had no clue who Tony was talking about. None of the women really stood out and they all seemed to fake their reactions. But it didn’t really matter who it was. He just had to pretend to date this good looking guy and he’d earn two hundred dollars. Maybe tonight wasn’t so bad after all.
Tony chuckled. 'You're my only friend and you grew up to be a really good looking human being and a super sexy dragon. Like I could ever kill you! I'll protect you from the asshole that is my father.'
'When I get hired I'll try to befriend one of them,' Steve said. 'Probably the Mexican guy. I think his name is Olivia. I think I saw a war hammer tattooed on his arm.'
The two people shouting 'NO!' in their ears were so loud that Tony could hear Sam and Steve could hear the guy who was monitoring Tony. Steve and Tony cried with laughter.
'Make sure you're ready in half an hour,' the lady behind the desk said. 'And can I get your sizes, then we can prepare wetsuits for you.'
‘You like it that Stark masturbated over Captain America when he was a teenager?’ Clint asked. ‘That might be more disturbing than the actual thing.’
‘I’ve been waiting for half an hour,’ Steve said. ‘I was a little tired when I actually arrived, but I’m all better now. Made some food too, if you guys feel like eating. There wasn’t much, so it’s nothing special, but it was a long trip.’
As they got closer Clint stopped the dogs. He got off the sled and gave the animals a treat for doing such a good job. Tony slowly walked towards the castle. It wasn’t just some vision, it was real. He got closer and closer and then suddenly he noticed something strange. The moat wasn’t filled with water, or ice, since it was so cold, but it was filled with something that looked like lava. The thick, slow moving, orange liquid was bubbling a little. Tony moved even closer, but he couldn’t feel any warmth coming from it.
‘I’ve only been on a plane a few times,’ Steve said. ‘Always to fly me to a war zone, so I don’t have many great memories about it. It was….oh, shit, we were supposed to turn right there. Sorry, I was distracted. Take the next one right instead.’
‘Sorry,’ the smaller man said. ‘Haven’t even introduced myself. ‘My name is Tony Stark. This is Obadiah Stane, my right hand man when it comes to business. To make up for the attack, you could go on a date with me. If you’re into that kind of things. Men, I mean. If you’re into men. You’re hot and you seem to be a decent person, trying to make up for something you’re not to blame for. So, we totally forgive you and the budgie if you go on a date with me.’
The little girl hopped off her seat, walked to Tony and offered him a piece as well. Tony took one and thanked her. As she returned to her father Tony fondly remembered another smiling kid that once gave him candy.
With a backpack filled with clothes and make up Steve knocked on the back door of the club, as he was instructed. It took a while before it opened and a young woman with blue hair looked at him.
Buddy agreed. 'If a client is vague and you don't know exactly what he wants, you make a safe choice. Make something sweet, but not too sweet. The pumpkin bread is really well made, but in this case not a good choice.'
‘..ugly, tiny person….not a hero…scrawny….what kind of hero is that….useless….scratch the contract…idiot.’
‘I’m really sorry, Pep,’ Tony said as he pulled away from Steve, who went back to his sushi. ‘You’ve been in Malibu such a long time and I wanted to tell you in person and the last time we saw each other Steve and I had only been on two dates. You know how much I suck at relationships. I couldn’t have you all excited and then tell you I screwed up again!’
'Not your sidekick, but maybe your partner!' Clint cheered. 'We're going to be a team, so you better get used to me. You'll be seeing a whole lot more of me in the future.'
'You can ogle my plane later,' Tony laughed. 'You like all kinds of transportation? Do you also look at trains like you want to take them apart?'
'That's you?!' Steve asked shocked. His face turned bright red and the color slowly spread over his chest as well. 'I'm sorry, I didn't realize. I wouldn't have made you sleep in a tent if I knew!'
Tony activated a small magnetic field with his suit, something to nullify the force field around the lava, but nothing happened. It wasn’t an magnetic field. Tony stood closely to the wall and looked if he could see anything. Anything that could give him a hint on how to get inside.
But Julia approached him after work. Steve was surprised, he had never really talked to Julia before.
‘What are you talking about?’ Tony asked. ‘He is amazing, Rhodey, I think he and I could be great together. He laughs at my dumb jokes! Nobody laughs at my dumb jokes.’
'Sucks, I liked him. Even dressed up like that, even playing a prostitute, he can still make stupid jokes. He takes it seriously, without...'
'Sounds good,' Tony said. 'Do you have some place where I can work while we wait for the contestants to finish their pastries? Maybe give my driver a place to relax as well? Or show him around, he loves bakeries.'
‘Well, there was one thing that was hard to deal with,’ Steve replied. ‘We had to explain two little boys how it was possible that both Santa and daddy broke their leg. They were both very drunk, but you can’t say that to a six-year-old. We said that daddy was helping the neighbour with the Christmas lights when he heard Santa fall down the stairs. Daddy wanted to rush to his aid and fell of the ladder. I didn’t think they were going to ask why only dad was in the ambulance, but thankfully mom came up with a story about elves and Santa being magic and a broken leg couldn’t be a reason to cancel Santa’s most important day of the year.’
'I want some of what they...' Tony said, looking up, stopping mid-sentence when he saw Steve. 'What the hell are you wearing?'
‘After that they were so excited that they got a ride in the ambulance that they didn’t ask anymore questions about Santa,’ Steve said. ‘Also, their mom made them open some presents in all of the chaos to distract them and they didn’t really need Santa anymore this year.’
Steve boiled some more water to make them both another cup. Tony tried his best to finish one sandwich. They were good, they were great, but he wasn't good with breakfast, normally he only drank coffee. It didn't matter, because Steve easily finished the other four sandwiches. The blond washed the dishes before he joined Tony to fix the car.
Steve smiled widely, thanked them, and left. Buddy discussed the achievements of the other bakers and told them why he was disappointed and what they should do next time. One by one they could leave the room, until only Ryan and Ashley were left.
'Yes, there is an agent outside who will show you your room, Fury said. 'We'll talk tomorrow about how we can get you back in the field. You too Barton, I want to talk about a contract tomorrow.'
Clint sat up and pushed the dogs away for a moment. ‘What the hell are they doing? No, I don’t think I want to know.’
'I'm not,' the man said with a grin. 'Don't worry about it. So, are you an artist or are you part of the collection?'
'Is there something I can do for you?' Tony asked, trying to look like those blue eyes didn't startle him.
'You're quiet, beautiful girl,' Tony said to Steve, who was lazily hanging against Tony's arm. On Steve's other side were two more guys, also policemen. Today Ronan would be caught. The big boss was sitting on a plush couch in a corner, surrounded by girls, real ones, and a table filled with empty glasses. The alcohol had made them talk loudly.
‘I was kinda hungry myself,’ Steve admitted. ‘Takes a lot of energy, so I already had some, but there is more.’
It was freezing cold. Tony wrapped a blanket around himself, but he still shivered. This soldier must be frozen, or maybe the dragon kept him warm? But it was obvious that no normal human being could survive for seventy years in a place like this. Tony got more curious by the minute. He had about a hundred theories about this, but they were all so surreal that the real thing would probably be disappointing.
Steve smiled at him before he turned back to Tony. 'Today is your lucky day. You will have your threesome! We'll use Julia's room. It's bigger.'
Clint’s daughter, Lila, had a wry look on her face when she looked back at them. She knew exactly what she was doing.
Natasha Romanoff met Bucky Barnes for the first time in a jail cell in Wakanda. Natasha Romanoff met the a Winter Soldier for the first time on a roadside protecting her mechanic. Natalia Romanova met James for the first time as a young girl in the Red Room, but she doesn’t even know how much of her James is left in Bucky.
There was an uproar from the living room, and Steve squeezed balled his outstretched has into fists, wincing at the sound of footsteps clattering towards the doorway. Tony awkwardly slung his legs from where they hung over the edge of the counter.
Steve was leant in the kitchen against the counter, watching his team through the doorway. Tony joined him, covered in motor oil after being under Laura’s car, which had been acting up lately.
Steve and Bucky were still gaping at the place, which Tony had organised last-minute. By the time they’d all settled into their rooms, luggage tucked away, they’d joined downstairs to investigate the place a little more closely.
Steve dropped his head onto Tony’s chest with a sigh, closing his eyes as if to say why me, why now. Tony snorted gently and dipped his head forward pecking Steve’s forehead. Steve sat up and turned to look at the voice coming from the door, eyes already rolling back good-naturedly.
Clint’s surprised outburst was interrupted with the unmistakable sound of metal groaning underneath them.
“You know,” Steve said, arms folded across his broad chest currently stretching out a grey workout shirt, chin tipped downwards, “for a guy who’s been in the war and fights aliens and…” he sighed, cautioning a look at Tony, who was sat on the kitchen worktop.
“He’ll stay put,” Sam spoke up, waltzing over to the table where the team were gathering together what supplies they had salvaged - dividing it into what was useful and what they could sacrifice to Tony to be disembowelled of its technological innards.
,” he addressed the whole team now, who – Nat and Bucky – who were in various stages of shock, relief, and anger.
“Tony has a broken face, why does he get to go out?” Clint challenged, though given the fact he was now resting on the couch with his feet up, he’d backed down about going out himself.
They kissed for what felt like hours, touching each other intimately, stroking hands through each other’s hair. Tony ran his hands over Steve’s biceps and his chest, Steve gingerly placed a hand over the scars left by the arc reactor, feeling the curves of his waist, pulling their hips together.
“Are you just going to loom, Barnes, or can I help you with something?” She asked dryly after a few moments. She eyed James Bucky from where she leant over the counter of the kitchenette. If he was startled he didn’t show it, and simply stepped more clearly into her line of sight.
mean?” Clint asked, squinting at the cook-book lead out in front of him. It was written in Italian, which Clint claimed was the only way to cook authentic Italian food.
Rhodey’s legs were struggling; even if the snow wasn’t knee-deep, the amount of time he was on his feet had well exceeded  doctor’s recommendations. Tony hobbled besides him supporting the majority of his friend’s weight, keeping unusually quiet.
Tony pulled out a screwdriver and undid the bolts on the casing of the vent below them quickly, dropping down onto the floor below. The others followed closely behind him, when they heard the click of someone clicking the safety off their gun.
Rhodey unfolded his arms and reached for his phone in his pocket, not taking his gaze off the files, taking them in.
Before they’d slunk out the door, they’d grabbed their handguns fixed with silencers. Nat and Barnes followed up behind Cap in a wedge formation, keeping enough distance between each other to get a good scope of the area around them. Tony craned his neck out the door as much as he could until all three were out of sight. The trees were much denser in this area which made the threat of an ambush much more likely.
That evening back at the villa, everyone sat down around the dining table which was littered with poker chips and playing cards. Sam dealt the cards round expertly, and Steve grinned at Bucky who was sat towards his elbow.
Sam and Nat were on evac - Bucky defending their backs - retrieving civilians from buildings which were amidst their latest battle, and directing them toward the barricade set up by S.H.I.E.L.D and local authorities. Cap had given strict instructions to his team that the underground train stations should be off limits. The last thing they needed was the ground collapsing in on innocent civilians.
“But?” Steve smiled, leaning heavily against the doorframe, completely comfortable in his own skin, clad in just a bath-towel wrapped round his waist.
“Okay, yeah, alright - I’m not actually as competent as I pretend to be when it comes to super-spy training.”
They all reached the bay doors, Tony and Steve scrambling on as it began lifting off the ground - they’d wanted to get Sam on first, Rhodey heaving him up from inside the jet. Steve hauled himself up with a grimace, automatically reaching for the scruff of Tony’s undersuit and yanking him the rest of the way up unceremoniously too.
where you look at each other nicely. Disgusting” Bucky mock-grumbled as he sauntered in, dropping himself on windowsill, followed by the others pizza boxes in hand. Steve just tossed a pillow at the guy’s head.
return Steve’s affections, Clint began to feel the faintest bit hopeful for his friend. And a little smug. What? It was dramatic irony, or whatever, knowing something that no else could see yet.
Thor was beaming at hims he strode across the living room, nodding a thanks to Laura and Clint as they welcomed the rest of their team inside their home.
Tony was led back on the beach, having discreetly slipped out of his wet clothes and into swimming trunks and a t-shirt with sleeves that finished at the elbows.
“I’d be happy to share a room with you,” and the beautiful, crooked smile the smaller man gave him made all the rambling worth it, even if Steve found he didn’t and it much at all in the first place.
“This,” he said grinning, “was the blade that struck you - you were most lucky that it merely passed under your lungs, nothing vital was clipped - your liver was slightly, but your physicians were remarkable at their role!” He beamed down at Tony, hair messily pulled back into a bun. His t-shirt was far too small for his chest, which had Black Widow’s doing written all over it. Coincidentally, it literally did have her name in graphic print over the front, Tony noted frowning curiously.
The inhabitants at Avengers tower moped around the place, almost begging for something to happen. Once a police siren had sounded a few blocks away, and half of them hand sprinted through the rain to see the situation. A man had stood on the bonnet of a patrol car, and received a wall of pent-up adrenaline from Captain America.
” Sam groaned, disgust evident in his tone, while Steve ran a hand over the back of his neck, which prickled with warmth. His cheeks probably weren’t any better.
“Oh, please - like you never told Pepper shit,” the archer threw at Tony, who looked mildly affronted.
Steve head out first, making a gesture behind himself a few yards from the cabin. With his left arm, he raised his forearm up, making an 'o’ shape with his hand.
“I mean- it’s not your fault, you haven’t done anything wrong, you’re just so, modest?” Tony raised his eyebrows at that; not at the way it had been posed as a question, but the fact no one had every called Tony Stark modest.
“Can’t stop a runaway train,” Steve agreed playfully, dodging to the side when Tony kicked his foot out at him.
Before Steve could interrogate Sam anymore about why the hell he thought Tony was with Nat, the rest of the team came strolling in, Rhodey in the middle of explaining some plot-point to whatever show he’d just been watching with Clint and Thor.
, though. His teammates were getting along, which is only a good thing. Especially considering how they started things off way back on the helicarrier. But since when were Tony and Nat
The agent’s mangled body, proudly clutching the hydra badge on his uniform, was all the evidence they needed to make the conclusion that Hyrda was sending out kamikaze’s now.
“We’re under strict instructions to send an urgent message to headquarters.” She lied easily, without a trace of any American accent.
Rhodey side-stepped out the archer’s trajectory, missing the bile Clint retched up, while screwing his face up in disgust, though laughing wildly.
Even half unconscious, Nat drew her gun, aiming as best she could (which was still better than most) towards the light. It could be the agents out in a patrol car, after all. But they both knew their chances of survival - with nothing but each other and their injuries - in the sub-zero temperatures at night were excruciatingly slim.
“This ain’t motor oil,” he grunted solemnly, holding out the helmet for Natasha to see more clearly in the light. The substance on it was scarlett in colour, and not as viscous as any oil.
Rhodey took a deep breath, considering for a few moments, leaving Tony in anticipation of whatever Wise Words his friend was about to offer.
When Natasha and Buck disappeared through the door, Steve straightened himself, holding his hands out after Tony in case he slipped, who was scaling the ladder. Steve stared despite himself, feeling his Catholic Guilt swing and punch him in the gut when caught himself ogling Tony’s ass above him. Not that he stopped, would in their right mind would?
“Hold up, we didn’t even get a vote-!” Tony piped up. Around him, the others were excitedly jogging off to their quarters, presumably to pack their things.
The super-soldier crawled up Tony’s body, gripping him by the hips and rolling down, enticing a moan from the smaller man. Steve’s face was flushed red, his brow furrowed as Tony mouthed at his neck.
The next time she brought it up, once her leg had mostly healed, Tony didn’t hesitate to accept. He’d admit, he was nervous but was pleasantly surprised to learn that - while tough - Nat could be a very supportive and understanding teacher. She didn’t laugh at him when he clumsily tried to copy her movements, or when he messed up for what felt like the one-hundredth time in a row.
Tony and Steve just laughed as a collective shout of disbelief sounded from the kitchen, save from Bucky and Rhodey, who just hollered suggestively, whistling and howling from their positions I front of the TV.
, and, oh!” he snapped his fingers together as if remembering something “Your dates! You go out to brunch like twice a week!”
Steve kissed the reactor, feeling Tony still at the intimate gesture. Steve just carried on, delicately touching the edges while sucking hickeys into the skin around the device. Tony whimpered, and pulled Steve back to his lips, gave him everything.
Steve pressed Tony against another wall just before the entrance of his bedroom - forgetting completely it wasn’t just his right now - biting at the man’s lips, sucking on his tongue, winding his hands through soft brown locks. Tony wrapped his legs round Steve’s waist, rocking forward desperately, heaving in breathes between frantic kisses.
“Laura,” came Steve’s warm and grateful voice, and she turned at him smiling gently, “thank you for this, it’s so good to see you under better circumstances.” She waved him off fondly, and patted his arm softly.
Steve and Tony set down and drank by the balcony for a good hour, chatting idly about anything that came to mind. The others weren’t coming back anytime soon, Steve knew; Tony was quietly watching the yellow hued moon above them, taking in the breeze that relieved them from the muggy Moroccan air. The hum of crickets filled their ears, along with the occasional shout from party-goers down the street - accompanied by mellow tunes of acoustic guitars coming from a lounge a few blocks away.
They settled into a comfortable almost-silence, the sound cutlery scraping against crockery, the sounds from the street outside filling the room like music, while the occasional moments of chatter built up among them.
, at Steve. The blonde didn’t try and hide his crooked, nervous smile, or the way his shoulders were slightly hunched, making him look smaller.
Hearing the crunch of snow underfoot a few feet ahead, Tony poked out from behind a large fir tree, adjusting the silencer into his gun, and picked off two hydra goons in two practised shots. Venturing out and searching the agents of anything useful, Tony heard a commotion a few yards ahead. Setting off in a sprint, Tony came to the edge of a clearing, throwing himself onto the ground before a steep drop into the clearing.
Natasha nodded and made her way to the door. Thor got up to do the same when Tony tried to get up again, until his friend gave him a stern look that made him settle back down.
Bucky flicked through the files on him, the other Winter Soldier projects, tossing relevant ones over the Steve, who was mostly engrossed in them, but kept flicking his gaze up to Tony.
When he opened them, he caught Steve directing an open and fond gaze his way, which transformed to mild panic when he realised Tony saw him. Tony felt a leap in his chest, and just grinned genuinely at Steve - not one of his practised media-smiles plastered over his face, but a soft and slightly crooked smile, easily forming on his face.
“Banner is loading onto a jet - he’s got Maximoff and Vision with him, too,” Rhodey said, coming into the room and already flicking through the files Tony had put to the side to look at more closely later - the two MIT graduates took the data by a storm, both acting as pieces of a well-oiled machine. Steve couldn’t help but be wistful to have Rhodey’s mind, to have the intelligence to keep up with his best friend.
Sam and Bucky were staring each other down, trying not to laugh as they threw back shot after shot of tequila.
“I’m gonna pack! Just choose somewhere hot and I’m down - I wanna be out of this shit-hole before dinner, thanks!”
Tony looked beautiful, his eyes glistening in the moonlight, soft curls of hair stroking the nape of his neck and flopping over his eyes. He smelled of sea-salt and vanilla, his bare feet hung over the balcony as he sat in shorts and an oversized t-shirt that read The Runaways across the front.
They approached the steps leading up to the entrance of their home, when Bruce scooped what looked like a t-shirt off the cobbled road.
Bucky, Natasha, and Clint all ate the food wordlessly, getting it down their throats without even tasting it. Rhodey did the same, albeit with a grimace, while Sam and Tony prodded at it, eyes filled with concern.
They’d taken a complete detour, instead of going the most direct way, Tony had lead them down a bunch of side streets, just to end up at the end of the road the store sat on, rather than just walk down said road to get there.
“Yeah, just…” he waved at the bag, still swinging as if that answered the question even remotely. (Hint: it did not.)
Tony knew what she was doing. Prodding and poking, leading him into some kind of admission without ever asking direct questions, instead gathering intel through seemingly relaxed or mundane conversation. It wasn’t a malicious thing, she did it to everyone - friend or foe - but with him and the team, it was her way of coaxing them out of their shells when they had something they needed to talk about, but didn’t quite feel confident enough to just come out with it.
“Sounds like a plan,” Tony drawled, already headed upstairs, “Meet down here in twenty, we’ll head out someplace down by the sea,” and with that, they departed to go freshen themselves up.
Like Steve had said and thought many times before, Tony was weird guy, so it really didn’t send any red lights flashing off in his mind.
“I can’t believe you made it out of scraps, it’s impossible - I had such a science-crush-thing on you when I read about it,” Tony’s gaze snapped up to meet Thor’s, hand reflexively coming around his one throat to protect it. Thor’s faux-storm gaze cracked into a large shit-eating grin, and he clapped the brunette on the shoulder.
Later, all sat around the campfire attempting to toast… whatever it was Thor had conjured up, Steve couldn’t ignore the soft flutter of butterflies in his stomach as Tony pressed up against his side, sharing one of the make-shift log seats Steve and Bucky had dragged over for the team. In an increasingly rare turn of events, Nat and Tony weren’t sitting right next to each other. Instead, the redhead was helping Bruce try and toast his dessert while listening to Thor talk avidly about one of his many adventures before he’d met them all. Clint and Bucky were tossing sticks into the fire, making some kind of game out of it simply to sate their competitive urges. Rhodey was leant over looking at Sam’s phone, who was wiping through Tik Toks he’d saved, giggling like children.
He worked the brunette slowly, so gently Tony felt his entire body flush, his heart skip a beat, moaning obscenely when Steve curled his fingers. Tony stroked Steve idly, with each pull earning a delightful moan from the soldier.
Tony plucked himself out of Steve’s grip, who apparently locked his arms around his waist in his sleep. Steve’d never do that consciously, surely (right?). Looking down fondly at the blonde, the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stood up suddenly, sending chill down his spine - not a pleasant one, either. Glancing around the room, Tony took a sudden intake of breath when he noticed Barnes had silently gotten up too, looking alarmingly alert for such an ungodly hour in the morning.
“Good morning, sour-patch. Looking dashing as always.” Tony, as always, shuffled past everyone and made straight for the coffee machine, the sleeves of his oversized M.I.T sweatshirt almost draping off his hands as he reached for his mug. He pulled out two, however, pouring an espresso shot in each one and topping it off with whatever variety of milk was closest to him as he swung open the fridge.
“Oh, please, we’ve done it at least every year on your birthday, honey - don’t act like a patron saint-”
“Woah, Woah! Shit, I’m not armed, I’m not armed!” the man - definitely Canadian, Nat noted - was probably in his early fifties, clad in denim jeans and a large puffer jacket. Nat lowered the gun, sighing in relief.
The minutes passed by painfully slow, the four of them taking up positions where they could aim into the corridor, taking shots at over-confident agents. Eventually, a ping rang from the computer, indicating the signal was sent.
Steve took a rattling breath in, before signing and closing his eyes. Bucky leant forward, momentarily concerned, when Steve spoke up.
“Mister Stark,” came Fury’s steady voice as he parted between the agents, making a quick gesture with his hand to dismiss them from the room.
Throwing his battered helmet to the ground, Tony skidded to a stop next to Steve, who was was dangerously pale and had a trail of blood coating one side of his face, matting his beautiful blonde locks his forehead. His lips were blue, and Tony felt dread corse through him like ice in his veins.
“The Hydra base,” Sam cut in, “it’s risky - really risky, we’re down by quite a bit - but it may be the only realistic chance we have to get a strong signal out fast. And let’s face it,” he said, looking at their various current states of disarray, “we won’t manage without proper medical supplies and food out here for much longer.”
Steve had reached out to Tony, thought he other man was still hurting, and in truth Steve was too. But no matter how much Tony seemed to blow his fuse with the other man, how he took things badly and snapped, they seemed to be settling on even grounds again.
Okay, so maybe not all of that was down to Tony being half Italian, and more to do with the restless thumping Steve’s heart did when he locked eyed with the brunette.
Tony scowled in Bucky’s direction, who still hadn’t lifted his eyes from his mug - but was definitely smirking into his drink - when Clint plopped himself down on the sofa next to them.
“Do I need to cut you off?” He laughed, feeling the flush of alcohol on his cheeks. He felt looser, as if his actions were just rolling off of him in their own accord. Which is why his arm wound its way over Tony’s shoulders, he told himself, nothing more.
, he was going crazy and perhaps all he needed was to let it off his chest and it would just go away. He considered for a moment, thinking about how Clint was close to Nat, so rather than cutting straight to the chase, wondered if the archer had been feeling the same way as him.
“Of course I didn’t, I’m very professional, Stark.” She said innocently, strolling past him and already scaling the ladder.
“Well, given that I run the operation here, I grant you permission to disclose,” he gestured a hand out, as if inviting them to speak. Tony shrugged at Natasha, who had already walked up to the man and snapped neck in one swift movement.
“Because the killer was focused on us,” she explained, “A super-enhanced being, and a psychopath… he wanted us to
“They’re in there - Thor, Hulk, we could use a hand here.” Nat said as Bucky already began tearing through the debris, casting it aside as if it weigh nothing. Sam ran up beside them then, Natasha raising an eyebrow at him in return, he looked momentarily sheepish at that, but shrugged and said
Steve seemed taken back by that, expecting more of a fight out of Nat - it usually took her a while to back down, she only did so if she knew she was going to be beaten. Steve couldn’t help feeling rather smug - intimidating the Black Widow in a game of poker.
comment was. Sam just looked between Steve and Bucky, frowning at the way Steve looked like he’d just been told something utterly horrendous and the way Bucky was shooting him a look of utter disbelief.
Of course, the others had left them with one of the two guest bedrooms with a double bed. Nat and Wanda had nabbed the room with two large singles - they’d spread out on them exaggeratedly much to the digression of Sam and Bucky, who grumbled as they squeezed into one small double bed together in the opposite room.
“Here,” Steve knelt down beside Tony, while the others were pottering around, casting cautious looks out the windows and preparing some kind of herbal tea.
“How do you suppose we get outta here?” Bucky called over the sound of gunfire, ducking behind the cover of the reinforced doorframe. Steve turned to Tony, who stilled before aiming his gauntlet skywards. Firing, a large hole emerged in the ceiling from the impact of the blast, and cold air whipped into the room.
,” Tony pointed at her playfully, ignoring Lila’s tongue poking out at him between a gap-toothed smile. “I thought we were friends,” he hissed.
Sam just shook his head, and flicked around the schematics that floated in the air from the small device Tony had slipped into his pocket before the mission. It acted like a Cloud, storing essential data, as well as receiving updates from Maria Hill and Nick Fury themselves.
Despite his animated character, Tony did have moments of quiet appreciation like Steve, sometimes preferring to take in the comforting presence created between their friends. He was smiling, face lit up by the golden hues of the sun and eyes illuminated by the fire in front of them, revealing the rich tones of browns and golds in his irises.
Steve just groaned, slumping back into the mattress. Tony’s big dark eyes gazed back at him, bleary with sleep. He hummed in confusion, and Steve pressed a kiss against his forehead, salty with sweat.
It seemed none of the others had cottoned on to the shift in their dynamic, but slowly the bickering became some odd form of flirting, the the shouting matches - which, granted, were far less frequent now - left them both leaving for air, feeling hot and tense, fisting their hands by their sides to stop themselves reaching out and just grabbing for one another.
Crashing out of the trees, they came to a stop, Tony panting frantically - feet now planted on tarmac instead of dirt - and Nat aimed her gun at the figure silhouetted by headlights, hands raised.
Natasha and Bucky appeared in the doorway, walking backwards in a crouch, open firing into the corridor.
Wanda was the least shaken by the ordeal, but the tight purse of her lips indicated her displeasure at putting her friends, her family, through such pain. Sam had accepted Steve back with open arms, forgiving him instantly. Clint understood the need to do what they did, but the tension in his shoulders read that he wasn’t happy about it. Thor had gripped him in a bear-hug, but seemed put-out by the fact they were left in the dark about Steve’s ‘murder’. Bruce was mad, felt hurt, but was focusing most of his efforts on calming Tony down, as was Rhodey.
“Okay. And this has nothing to do with the fact you have some incessant desire to run throughout New York with a menagerie of gay women shouting ‘let’s go lesbians’, does it?”
“That’s a matter of opinion - frankly, it’s just an ability I was utilising… Like when we spar, you have super strength! Isn’t that a tactical advantage?”
They all settled along the beach, it’s sands a beautiful golden white, palm trees looming overhead offering patches of shade. They set up chairs and towels next to a cluster of smooth rocks, which Thor was immediately climbing to the top of. The edge of the rocks smoothed out and overlooked the water, extending a go distance from the shore to offer space to jump into the waters below.
On que, the next round of bullets stuck from behind. They waited, crouched-down waiting for the bullets to once again cease firing. With the hand joint to Tony with the cuffs, Nat grabbed Tony’s hand in hers firmly. They couldn’t afford one of them lagging behind. Just as Tony felt like his heart might explode with anticipation, the bullets stopped, and they ran.
A month later, and Tony and Steve were back to talking as usual. Sometimes Tony joked about his feelings for Steve, brushed them off as nothing more than physical attraction. Really, its an appreciation for the science behind the serum, not the meat-head piloting it, he’d said, cackling like a madman at Steve’s mock-offended expression.
Clint’s quip only served to deliver himself a considerably sized handful of snow from Natasha and a long-suffering sigh from Rhodey, who was largely consumed in a startlingly orange SHIELD-issue puffer jacket he’d picked up before everything went to hell on the jet.
What he hadn’t expected to see, was Tony Stark, leant over a grand piano - they all had assumed was some extravagant decor choice - with his shoulders shaking silently. Clint was about to turn round, until a pang grew in his chest. He and Tony used to be good friends. They shared the same witty sense of humour, used sarcasm as a shield, and used humour oozed from them as they told stories.
“The elevator is that way-” Tony breathed around kisses, pointing to the opposite direction in which they were headed.
“Do you reckon we’re starting to get too old for that shit?” Rhodey groaned, shielding his eyes from the sunlight that was slowly basking the room in an orange glow from where it peered over the horizon, already enticingly warm.
“Yes… but in a dignified way! With tumblers of good scotch and leather armchairs - not slumped on the floor like a bunch of teenagers on their first vacation,” He laughed, shaking his head and earning a snort from Tony, who looked as out of it as Steve felt. God, he just wanted to touch his lips, feel the crook of his chin in his hands…
Thor just smiled and shook his head, “I’m afraid I have, Sam,” he God’s expression was soft and apologetic, “Jane and I have explored New York many times, now,” Sam threw his hands in the air, slumping back into his spot on the sofa in defeat with another groan.
The others watches as Clint sprinted out the waters, almost crying with laughter as Tony spluttered to the surface - clothes sticking to him like a second skin.
Bucky brushed it off, marking it down to bad luck. “Read em’ and weep, Barton,” he declared slyly, placing his cards face-up on the table, “Full House,”
“Jarvis, let the others know I’m demanding we get takeout from that pizza joint I like for dinner tonight. No arguments, I’ve earned it.”
They hydra outpost was desolate and practically impossible to reach on foot. Out in the wilderness of Norway, it had been hard enough locating the outpost which - like most of hydra’s bases - was underground. The landscape was covered in a thick layer of snow, making the mountains in the distance barely visible through the snowfall which was beginning to pick up at a reasonably worrying pace.
Steve didn’t buy that it made anyone hotter, per se, but he had to admit, it just made everything look so ethereal. Tony, in particular, Steve thought, looked positively beguiling. He’d let his hair grow out longer, allowing for it the slight curl at the nape of his neck and partly over his forehead; after being in the water, any hope of product keeping it in place was gone, instead, leaving it to naturally loll and curl in a way that made him look so
The archer stood up, strolling over to the armoury and pulling out a bow. As he stepped up to the target range, he looked back at Steve, taking pity on him.
Thor and the Hulk were currently drawing in the most attention from Doombots. The heavy-hitters were being rained down upon my an onslaught of bots, swarming on them like locusts. They’d manage, though, they always did. Like always, the pair seemed to be enjoying the fight more than was sane.
Tony let out a deep breath. Damn, he’d really been holding onto that one. It’s not like he thought the guys were dicks, in fact, he knew if he were to honestly tell any of them that he didn’t quite click with that banter, they’d feel terrible and stop. But he just didn’t want to seem weird or difficult. He was already pretty sure everyone found him at least mildly annoying, so why add to that?
As proof to his claim, a little girl had nudged one of the clowns, who fell backwards dramatically, knocking into another clown, who knocked into another and so on.
“I was wondering, do you - uh - would you want to go out sometime? If you want, it’s no pressure - I just thought, I
Tony looked up and noticed Barnes had directed the question at him, all eyes on his expectantly. Tony set his spoon down and leant back in his chair, considering.
“Light?” He mumbled round the blunt between his lips, and Steve moved his hand into his pocket, suddenly very aware of his own tongue. He cleared his throat and pulled out a lighter, holding it to the joint at Tony’s lips.
They were all worse for ware, to say the least. Sam’s arm had turned a dark maroon colour, and he could barely seem to focus on walking. Natasha had a limp even she couldn’t hide, and Clint’s wheezing rattled his chest. Steve and Bucky weren’t bad off, but both were sporting a number of deep purpling bruises and more than a few cuts which were bleeding sluggishly.
guys). It was like the usual context of a man and woman sharing a bed - no matter how ridiculous said ‘context’ is - hadn’t even crossed his mind. She guessed she understood, in a way, not that he would know why; the only time she’d ever felt that awkward tension was when sharing a bed with women, particularly women she found attractive-
Linking hands again, the pair hauled each other up as they continued to charge through the woods, gunfire finally beginning to grow more and more distant. For all their blunders, those agents at least seemed to have the good sense to know that their best bet now was to haul ass and set up base somewhere else; the Avengers had garnered quite the reputation for bringing all hell down against those who’d tried (and failed) to capture members of their team. Historically, it never ended well for the bad guys.
She nodded her head in agreement, before quirking an eyebrow, indicating a counter-argument to his rather weak excuse. “You
“Not… really. We have a different friendship, different bond. He’s not like, stolen her away from me, hell, I’ve started spending more time around Bucky and Thor, so it would be hypocritical of me to get mad that she’s spending time with him.” He explained, and Steve was really regretting his impulse to just get it out there. “Do
“Aw, come on! Seriously? You bait me?” Bucky just huffed out an air of laughter, accepting his cards from Sam, who shook his head fondly, familiar with the two’s antics. “Whatever, poker sucks, why aren’t we playing Go Fish?”
“Well call for the team in the morning since the only phone around here is probably in that reception building.”
Bruce let out a low whistle, “that sure is a long time…” He added innocently, chucking at Clint’s protests.
Tony’s hands made quick work of Steve’s belt, cupping his groin and shimmying his pants over his hips. Manoeuvring off the table, which now had previously-neatly stacked cards scattered and crumpled everywhere, the two slammed against the wall on the entrance hall.
“Excuse me, but isn’t that your signature move? Strangulation by thighs - they have action figures of you doing it now!” He protested weakly, wincing again at the movement of his chest. Natasha gently pushed him back down by his chest onto his pillow with one steady foot.
Steve held out his palm towards Tony, as if trying to soothe a wild animal, “Hey, it barely clipped me, but-”
Steve accepted, pulling at the fabric of his trousers as he did so, not quite ready to look Tony in the eye.
Steve wished he could say he was a good friend to Tony when they wandered over. Though he didn’t think any force on Earth would have stopped him practically collapsing in fits of laughter when a clown came up from beside them, honking a horn playfully, and the prompt shriek Tony let out from the top of his lungs, clawing at Steve’s arm.
“I learnt that in our first year of college,” the man laughed, just as Bucky set a murderous stare on Tony.
“You’re not dumb, Steve, so don’t play it. It doesn’t suit you,” she threatened. “I’m not saying any more than that, because
“What the fuck? Were we robbed or somethin’?” Sam slurred, staring at the scene that greeted them. Shattered glass, knocked over furniture, hell, even cracks in the plaster.
Tony’s eyes went wide momentarily before he seemed to catch himself. He tried to look amused, huffing out a short breath as if to appear incredulous.
Steve wasn’t quite ready to admit to himself that Tony’s laugh sent butterflies fluttering through his stomach, blossoming warmth into his bones. God, he was such a coward. Letting Tony think that… that he didn’t feel the same damn way. But he just wasn’t
Their job wasn’t exactly consistent, and now even Tony who had a company on the side, had given the majority of his role to Pepper. Being a superhero did take quite a lot of time away from the office - when they were under threat, that is.
And then there was Steve, the Adonis himself. His skin was smooth and water glided off of his chest like silk, and despite his skin being on the paler side, he looked absolute radiant. His golden hair had been plastered back on his head, beautifully exposing his strong features which were pulled into comfortable smiles and laughter. Tony’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of him, but instantly felt a pang of hurt at being stuck on the sidelines.
Steve couldn’t pinpoint the moment things changed between them - when the friction between them was replaced with a dynamic that felt more like a well-oiled machine. Not any machine at that, the kind Tony would invent, the sleek, ingenious, incredible, kind of mechanism that still baffled Steve to this day. Steve actually got used to modern-day technology pretty quickly, even taking to it like a pro once he accepted his newfound place in the twenty-first century; but the stuff Tony came up with? Nothing except maybe other-worldly magic even
in Tony’s case most the time) battling off Doombots while trying to get close enough to Doom - who was controlling the entire fleet from the safety of a bank. He’d set up a perimeter of bots defending the building, and hostages behind them as a safety net, the bastard. Doom was tucked away in a reinforced vault, using remote monitors to oversee his attack.
Her eyes widened as she snorted loudly. “What, no, of course not - why the hell do you need to ask?”
Tony flinched when Steve pressed a cold rag against his nose, screwing his eyes shut at the pain ebbing from the break. When he opened them again, a soft expression passed over the blonde’s features. Tony briefly returned the look, before settling his eyes over his hands.
Clint lunged and Tony made a feint to the side, before vaulting onto the other man’s shoulders, wrapping his thighs around the archer’s neck and swinging with enough force that he bodily
came Thor’s voice over the comm - Tony kept an earpiece on separate to the armour, so he wouldn’t be out the loop if he ended some air against his head. Thor’s voice was strained and curt, no doubt busy with another wave of bots keeping him occupied.
The team gathered in the gym around midday as per Steve’s request. They’d fallen behind on group training - they’d all had various short ops that kept overlapping with one another, so at the first chance, Steve wanted to get everyone back into the swing of things.
“Always thinking of little old me, hm?” Bruce teased, pushing down the nerves that came with the image of his two friends almost being killed like that.
!” Tony groaned dramatically, grasping his hand over his newly adjusted nose. The others just chucked around him, until their laughter grew louder and more hysterical. Tony’s groaning turned to giggles, though the occasional fuck hiccuped between them.
Nat had pulled down video footage of conferences shared between the heads of Hydra, Clint glossing over them which craning his neck over her shoulder.
Not a moment later the right engine startled to a halt, sending a few of them sliding into the opposite wall. The jet veered downwards, and alarms began blaring throughout the jet, seeing streaks of red lights across the interior.
“Colonel! Can you manage?” Steve had yelled over his shoulder as he neared the bay doors with Sam. Rhodey and Tony were a few short paces behind, both armed but weighed down by the armour they hadn’t been able to scramble out of in time.
Steve yanked the smaller man back down with a hysterical laugh of his own, feeling his smile crease the corners of his eyes. Tony flopped back onto the floor next to him, snorting loudly before humming contently. Tony looked over at Steve, a playful glint in his eye.
“Tony, you should wear your wounds with honour, as James does, and Clinton does with his listening-devices - ‘hearing aids’, you call them?” He asked, looking down at Jane for confirmation, who nodded fondly, “They are not to be ashamed of, my friend, they honour you!” The God pulled an arm round the brunette, smiling fiercely.
“Y'know… I gotta be honest with you, Tony… When this first started happening, I didn’t think much of it,” Steve mumbled, barely able to hold Tony’s gaze. “I jus’ thought it was a step-up from being at each other’s throats - bet then it just kept going up, and it still hasn’t stopped,” he wet his lips before continuing.
Steve could hear the other’s laughing beside him, and he couldn’t help the sappy smile that was brought to his lips at how carefree and happy Tony looked. Ignoring the fact it wasn’t with
Steve wiped at the steamed-up mirror in the bathroom, hair wet and dripping not his shoulders from the shower he’d just taken. He stared at himself, droplets of water hugging his eyelashes, and face recovered from any scraped and bruising they got in Norway; but his eyes were heavy.
Bucky stared after her, torn between bewildered, jealous, and impressed. Steve leant in to his friend’s, raising his eyebrows knowingly and pursing his lips together to hide his amusement.
? Okay, okay, I see you,” Clint said, a mixture of confusion and delight on his face. He amped up his game, and Tony was actually
“Oh Natashalie, you wound me,” Tony slurred melodramatically, wincing when he turned his head too fast trying to look at her, his vision doubling, tripling, and quadrupling a few times before adjusting again.
They’d both just come out with it, clearly choosing not to work up nerves with any prelude to what they were about to say.
After a few moments, Steve wound his arms under Tony, hauling them both up and marching out of the kitchen.
“Okay, I gotta know - how drunk did you two get to actually sleep with each other?” The man asked incredulously, earning a few curious looks from the others.
Tony watched the steady rise and fall of Steve’s chest, vaguely aware of a grumble outside, the crack of rock and cement being hauled to the ground, before he closed his burning eyes, feeling fait relief before his mind swum backwards impossibly far, and abandoned him in nothingness.
he berated himself. He opened his mouth, desperately hoping it didn’t look as awkward as it felt, but Tony didn’t make fun of him, just placing the strawberry into Steve's mouth before taking another off the stick for himself.
With Nat’s experience, it really wasn’t hard to reach through the bars and snap the neck of their guard while Tony picked the lock. Nor was it that difficult picking up extra tactical gear and weapons and storming their way out, scrapping with any agents who got in their way. What had made it more of a nuisance was the fact they were handcuffed together with reinforced cuffs that looked suspiciously like S.H.I.E.L.D’s design for supersoldier-proof restraints. Not to mention they still hadn’t properly treated any of their injuries - Nat still had a slight limp after sustaining a minor stab wound to her thigh (Clint would probably yell at her for calling any stab wound
Tony came up spluttering and laughing, momentarily forgetting about the reactor. He stood up, and realised he’d popped up right in front of Steve, who was staring at him. What’s more, he was staring into his eyes, not his chest. His eyes were the most startling blue in front of him, despite being surrounded by the glittering waves around him.
It was three in the morning when the others stumbled out of the last karaoke bar, wandering down the cosy streets towards their home for the next week and a half.
“C'mon Sam, don’t flatter yourself, you aren’t all that hard to carry you know” Steve smiled at his friend, who returned the expression albeit slightly twisted in pain. “And he landed in his arm, not his face, Clint.”
Turning around, Tony was stood awkwardly, body tilted to the left, as if willing Steve to choose the long way round again.
“What’s wrong?” He’d ventured slowly, sending a sideways glance at Clint who had simply shrugged in response.
Tony had kept his gauntlets on, and the reactor of course, and was currently in the process of trying to boot them back up. Without the reactor at full capacity though, it was a long and tedious process.
“Because! Because… they,” he rubbed a hand over his face, flustered, before sighing in defeat. “Because they said you’d give the most genuine and… and satisfying reaction… for the killer. That way, he was more likely to come out to gloat… and then we’d have a shot at getting the guy, which we did-!”
did you pull that off man?!” Clint was getting up, not even remotely upset, just genuinely interested. Clint could laugh at anything - but between a strange mixture of being impressed, shocked, and turned-on, Steve began to feel an icy, creeping realisation.
, I’m so glad to hear you saw those words” Clint moaned, already getting up and talking to the elevator.
The room hadn’t been lived in in a long time, filled with ghosts of memories of old movie nights, homey meals, game night and conversations that spiralled on for hours.
“If I see a single one of you listening in outside this goddamn door in the surveillance tape later I will personally have you put on paperwork duty for the next fortnight,” Steve said plainly. The sound of shuffling stirred up and eventually faded out down the corridor.
When Steve first met the man, he was fooled by the charismatic demeanour he threw over all of their eyes; but after living with the guy for a few months and seeing his guard slowly lower down, he let his quirks show.
Tony shook his head at her, holding back a smile, before nodding seriously. “Fine, I’ll assist you in your cheap shot at illustriousness.”
“Italian is your mother-tongue?” She asked curiously, setting her mug of green tea down on the surface.
At the same time Thor laughed outrageously and Clint scowled at the man, covering Lila and Cooper’s ears, Steve shoved is friend good-naturedly, breaking the other man’s stoic expression into a devious smirk.
Tony winced as turned back to the monitors, stitching on the device and getting to work on the coding. He’d memorised the digits needed to send Fury a direct signal in code, he’d done it enough times.
“So, what? You knew I liked you and, and pretended not to know because it freaked you out – but then you were okay using it as some kind of
The soldier breathed heavily, clenching a fist in Tony’s hair, before kissing back enthusiastically. After a few intoxicating moments, Steve scooped Tony up into his arms, and pushed him up onto the bar, absently sliding the drapes shut and flicking the lights off as he went, while Tony mouthed on his earlobe menacingly.
Thor’s hearty chuckles were heard from beside his head, and Tony peeled open the eye that wasn’t currently pressed into a pillow.
“No - Rhodey, he’s very wise. An old-soul and all that.” Tony mused, gaze flittering over Steve’s face, his chest, his arms.
“Well, were off to Switzerland, I see,” Wanda smiled at him, just as Sam threw his head back and sighed something forlorn about not even getting over jet-lag from Norway, yet.
Tony noticed he did that a lot. Rarely accepting a compliment or anything of the sort, so he’d started lingering back too, helping the soldier with his pottering around. Rather than verbalising these things so much, Tony found himself returning the little favours. He hoped the other man saw it for what it was, as a thank you, but even if he hadn’t caught on, the smile of appreciation he always sent Tony’s way was more than worth it.
‘No comment,’ Clint said as he followed a few steps behind. They walked into one of the halls and opened every door on their way. All rooms were decorated, but it looked like nobody had been in there for years. They were dusty and the style was way out of time. This wasn’t vintage anymore, this was just old crap.
Steve groaned and got himself another drink. He could use it, knowing his friends wouldn't stop teasing him tonight. Still, it was a great night. He got some business cards and he already had a few ideas for new projects. The future looked bright!
‘So if I get you the engineered guy, you will get rid of all the boys and girls that are hiding in my tower?’ Tony asked, to be sure.
His mood changed when he felt an arm around his waist. Slowly Steve turned to face the person who was holding him, and it's exactly who he feared it would be.
'I will,' Steve smiled. He started running, getting out of the way of the arms, but at the same time he tried to get the robot closer to the building. He made a lot of noise with his shield, getting the attention of the metallic monster. With success. The robot moved in the direction of the sounds and bumped against the building.
‘Yeah, that will do,’ Tony said. He sat down at the bar, poured them both a drink, as he continued to watch his new cook make spaghetti with meatballs.
Tony laughed. ‘That’s a good question. You guys don’t know what the world looks like, right? You haven’t been out for seventy years. No, I’m not half robot. This is my armor, I’m some sort of super hero, I guess, trying to help people.’ He clicked a few buttons and the suit folded itself neatly back into a suitcase, leaving Tony in his under suit.
They thought they couldn't be happier. Life was perfect. Tony remembered those years very well. He finally had the blond angel in his bed every night. They travelled the world together and were more in love than ever! Friends, the press, everyone said they wouldn't last long, but they did. They lasted forever. Not only happy times, but they had always supported each other during the bad times.
Steve shook his head as he stood up, thanked the director, took the papers and walked out of the room. It all went so fast that he couldn’t quite grasp what had been going on. He’d get a house, he’d get a new life here, in a world where he knew no one. Almost no one. He knew Tony, and Tony was a genius. He could help him with the contract, with the bike, with catching up. Steve went to his room, put his contract in a bag and went to search for Natasha.
Steve stopped walking, wrapped his arms around Tony, and hugged him tightly. Tony was surprised, but gladly returned the hug.
This time Howard did look up. 'Get out!' he yelled. 'Get the hell out of here and go back to school! What the hell were you thinking! I don't want to see that boy ever again. I don't even want to hear his name anymore. Understood?'
Tony hurried to his desk. He bit his nails as he looked at the closed doors. He had been so stupid! How could he just smack that ass?! Steve was probably freaking out right now. He would resign, leave the project, maybe even report him for sexual harassment! Oh, fuck him and his stupid reflexes! The press was going to love this. With a sigh he lay his head on his desk. His life was over!
‘Come on, Stark, do we really have to do this?’ Clint asked as he turned the screen back on. ‘He is fighting that thing on his own with some agents who only know how to shoot guns. That’s not going to help him, the bullets bounce off on that robot and go everywhere. Steve is in danger.’
'Nat, it's okay, they have a job for me, but they didn't know how the wall worked,' Steve said. 'Apparently it's been seventy years and the outside world doesn't know about the anti-aging technology anymore.'
It was a short drive to the airport. Tony took his bags from the backseat and handed them to one of the stewards. He talked to the pilot for a few moments, about their destination and at what airport they would arrive, before Tony climbed the stairs and sat down in his usual seat. He sat down on a pair of legs.
‘Okay, I have to admit that this is so much better than the average Star Bucks,’ James confessed. ‘I can understand why you rather go here to relax.’
'You too,' Natasha smirked. 'Too good for drag.  All muscles, but so feminine. It must be your pretty face. You will get a lot of customers, Stefanie, maybe you should switch careers. You could get rich!'
‘I think you should tell Tony,’ Clint said when Steve felt a little better. ‘He really likes you, Steve. Not just Captain America the walking furnace, but also the guy he had fun with while repairing a car.’
'So I'm useless as a hero, but I am good enough to help you with your paperwork?' Tony asked. 'Just ask one of those amazing agents. Or Clint, since you're such great buddies! I don't have time, I have better things to do.'
‘Yeah, apparently when you finally get the medication and the surgery you need you can have a late grow spurt. I’m a lot healthier now, I can even go to the gym. I know most people don’t like working out much, but it’s really nice to finally be able to run without my lungs burning after a minute.’
'Wow, Rhodes, you're going to be a father!' Tony said, still a bit fazed. 'That is amazing. You'll be a great father, you managed to keep me alive for a few years, a baby is going to be a peace of cake! Amazing man, congrats!'
'That sounds like we're cheating on Sam,' Steve laughed. 'Like I'm the housewife who's  waiting in her negligee until the plumber comes to fix her sink while her husband is out.'
‘I’m really tired, guys,’ Steve said. ‘They have bedrooms here, right? I think I’m going to take a shower and sleep a little. Guess running took more energy than I thought. I’m really sorry about this.’
So Tony couldn't live in his penthouse for a while. He could easily afford to stay in a hotel for a few months, and he did that at first, but very soon after the explosion the complaints had started. People in the neighborhood thought he had worked with dangerous chemicals in his workshop, and that those had ended up in the environment because of the explosion. One person had gotten ill and blamed Tony.  That meant Tony couldn't start rebuilding  his penthouse until people had done some thorough research, so a judge could tell Tony was innocent. He was an engineer, not a damned chemist. He owned hardly any chemicals.
“Oh?” Nat schooled her expression and glanced towards the group, who were currently lifting Bucky in the air and throwing him into the water while he cursed them.
At some point, Steve was rolling his body against Tony’s, turning over, running hands over each other and arching into the pleasure. The air was heavy and hot, interrupted only by a soft breeze from outside that carried waves of music and nightlife. Steve held Tony, rocking into him rhythmically, pressing their foreheads together, eyes meeting, lips ghosting over each other, immersed in absolute bliss.
(he refused to call it a Civil War, for gods’ sake), he had questioned whether Tony had their best interests in mind or his own.
Turns out Rhodes knew about Tony, but not about Nat, while he knew about Nat, but not about Tony. Clint couldn’t help but feel a little warmer inside knowing that he and Rhodey - even if they were the ‘logical’ place to start - were the first people that the pair felt comfortable coming out to.
The man tore off from the side of the road, eyes fixed on the road ahead, willing himself not to look at the passengers in the backseat of his pickup truck. Nat had slumped into Tony’s side and his head had dropped on top of hers, chest still heaving for air.
She laughed despite herself. They were both exhausted, bloody, and bruised, it was honestly a miracle they’d gotten this far.
“Right, uh, I wasn’t quite sure if you caught the memo,” Steve said, awkwardly scratching at the back of his neck.
Bucky looked over at Steve, mouth in a casual frown and shrugging nonchalantly. The blonde nodded, considering, and stood up next to Sam.
perceptive - just easily distracted. But the brunette made no suggestion that he had noticed, or was interested.
? How did I miss that and you didn’t, you were basically passed out!” He huffed, amused, “He’s an opportunist, then. I can appreciate that - we
“Hydra intel from this place is exceptional,” Steve spoke, causing the others to straighten up and regard the projections intently. “The system from the base acted as a kind of hub, gathering information from hundreds of other branches of Hydra.”
Clint trailed in not long after, followed by Bucky, then Sam and Rhodey - all freshly showered having done a few rounds in the gym. Steve wasn’t watching the doorway waiting for anyone else to emerge. Nope. Not bothered at-
God help Steve Rogers if he became one of those people to hurt Tony - there wasn’t an unproductive bone in James Rhodes’ body when it came to his friend.
“Don’t even joke about that, I’m shocked and offended and would like you to go away. I’ve had enough of you. Goodbye.” Clint just chuckled in response to Tony, and it felt good, familiar.  There was an unspoken element of hope in the air that things could get back to normal, and Steve ducked his head to hide the smile that played on his lips.
Steve woke up his his head smushed in the same pillow Tony was lead on. His head felt as if it were stuffed full of cotton, but one thing was clear, his night with Tony was perfect.
“You’ve been bested, Hawkeye!” Thor jeered, pulling Bucky into a firm grip round the man’s shoulders. “I thought you would be wise enough to realise-!” another belch “-the mighty son of Odin cannot be beaten!”
? Take me to it already,” she demanded, Tony’s accompanying groan supporting her statement. She let Clint support her under one her armpit and bring her to her feet when the archer noticed the handcuffs.
Pressing his ear over Steve’s lips, Tony heard no sign of breathing. Forcing back the will to just break down and sob at Steve’s side, Tony willed the strength to start making compressions on Steve’s chest.
Tony’s head snapped up, before he schooled his excited expression into one something more neutral. As if Rhodey couldn’t see right through it.
The room was cast in a brilliant blue, swimming in projections of blue-prints, transcripts, photographs of mission sites, of them, of Hydra’s top agents, of Pierce’s scheme, of the Winter Soldier. Steve and Bucky involuntarily stepped back slightly, as if avoiding being struck by a hologram - knowing full well it would merely phrase through them, made solely of light.
“Yeah, he only forgot his name for like an hour,” she teased, letting Clint inspect her leg, his lips pursed in a thin line. Steve snapped up at that, eyes wide until he saw the smirk she was directing his way. Steve shot her an unimpressed look, before giving her a wry smile.
at sparring - pretty good, actually. But in comparison to other members of the team, he had a clear disadvantage: they’d simply been training for a lot longer and more intensely than he had. That fact was probably why he’d managed to genuinely surprise his opponent - they weren’t used to him making more nuanced moves like that. He normally stuck to a defensive approach outside the suit, and when he
Clint grimaced, then sucked in a sharp breath when Natasha appeared over his shoulder with a rag soaked in alcohol, dabbing it over the wound without so much as a warning.
Tony made an indignant noise, throwing a pillow at her face while she laughed at the faint blush rising on his cheeks. Her grin didn’t subside though, she just kicked him in the leg with her foot, warmth blossoming in her chest like she hadn’t experienced before.
he was so pretty. He was too occupied trying not to stare at the other man’s lips that he didn’t notice how Steve’s smile began to look a little stiffer.
His head whipped back to face the team, faces set determinedly, and yelled over the loud whistle of air around them.
“You totally did not, Rogers, and quit acting like I’m embarrassed. You have googled me, right? A few pages into YouTube and I’m pretty sure Perez Hilton has a sex-tape of mine from the 90’s.”
The group paused their eating to look at Bruce, who had opened up the dishwasher to get another glass for the juice which was rapidly declining among them.
She laughed easily, feeling herself start to slump in her seat. “Be useful for once and help me get up, would you?”
‘Barton, shut up!’ Fury ordered angry. ‘The Captain is the team leader, because he is the best tactician of your group. You have your own…. qualities. You will all have to carry a device, so we can contact you at any given time, in case of emergency. You can do whatever you want, but when that thing starts beeping, you suit up and make your way to the location that is shown. That could be a place in the city, or here, at the headquarters, where you’ll gather to go to the place of the incident together.’
Tony took a deep breath. 'He is not just another orphan boy. We've been friends for years and since six months ago, he is my boyfriend.'
‘Thank you,’ Steve answered, a slight blush on his face. ‘Since we’re using red and gold for this project, I thought Iron Man should wear the same colors, so I made a more detailed drawing in color.’
When the show was over they went back to the tent and grabbed their toothbrush. With a flash light they found their way to the washrooms and got ready for bed. Tony was a bit freaked out to stand together with guys in sweaters, shorts and slippers who were all brushing their teeth or shaving their faces. There was no privacy at all! He quickly brushed his teeth before going outside and waiting for Steve, who had the flashlight. Together they walked back to the tent.
Bucky turned off the television. ‘A few minutes before I wanted to leave she called to tell me she was in bed with the flu. We’re meeting each other next week, she’ll be better by then.’
‘That’s amazing!’ Steve said. ‘That is really amazing! Are you going to bring it to the opening of the workshops? Because you really should, the kids will love it, they will all want to come back! You have to bring it and give a little show!’
‘Yes, I’m the only one, made it myself, actually,’ Tony said proudly. He loved talking about his Iron Man suit. ‘The technology is pretty new, but the guys you’re going to work for will help you to catch up with time. They’re good, but if they’re not, demand that I will help you, okay? I can tell you all about this new world!’
Steve hurried back to the dressing room. Most of the others were gone already. He quickly finished his make-up.
'You were perfect, babe,' Tony said. 'Is that guy paying for your drink or do I still have a chance with you?'
Tony picked the two bikes up and hurried down hill as fast as he could without tripping. It took long, it took way too long for his liking, but it was seriously difficult to drag two bikes back without tripping. As soon as he reached the car he dumped the bikes inside and practically ran back. He panted heavily by the time he arrived at the spot where Steve had been waiting.
'Bartender told me this is what you drink,' the man in the leather jacket smiled. 'I'm Tony. What's your name, beautiful?'
They had each other and it had been enough. After a few years Steve could make jokes about it. He always said they were stuck in the 'just married' phase forever, so they'd stay young and in love forever, while everyone around them grew old and unhappy.
He took a bite and chewed. It wasn't bad, not at all, but this was not what he had not asked for. He wouldn't eat this if it wasn't some sort of holiday. He swallowed it and put the rest of it back on the plate.
Clint and Natasha still didn't have their contract. They had a promise, but the director only wanted to sign it if he was sure he could have a properly functioning team. Stark was giving him problems, because he refused to work with Steve.
‘This is too easy. It must be a trap,’ Tony muttered. He had seen enough Indiana Jones movies to know that something was about to happen.
Steve looked up in surprise. ‘Is that…,’ he started. ‘Is that artificial intelligence? He told you I was here, didn’t he?’
So the next time Steve walked by, after he parked his motorcycle, Tony practically ran outside. Thankfully he was dressed pretty sharply this time, since he just came back from court. Steve stopped when he noticed Tony.
'Right, right, I keep seeing you as our innocent baby, but you're not,' Lauren said as he took off his wig. He massaged his scalp a little before he turned to Steve again. 'What was the weirdest thing you did?'
Too late. The guy got up from his seat at the bar and approached Steve. Steve's heart started beating faster as he tried to think about solutions. He could chat with the guy until his policeman showed up. That was the easiest thing to do. But if the guy didn't show up he couldn't reject this man. He would have to take him to his room. Maybe he could show him he was a policeman, to make him leave? Should he have sex with him to keep his cover a secret? They couldn’t force this man to keep his mouth shut. Maybe he was even one of Ronan’s guys. That would be the end of Steve. But Steve still didn’t know what to do when the man sat down on the chair next to him.
Steve swallowed his bite. Cook? Was this guy offering him a meal if he cooked it himself? He wasn’t going to say no to any kind of food, but this was a bit weird, wasn’t it? Who would offer a guy a meal after he broke into your house?
Steve sipped his drink, but he ran out of time. He couldn't wait any longer, he had to take Tony upstairs, or he would get suspicious. Nebula too, she had been watching him the last thirty minutes.
‘Just like that you’re coming with me?’ Tony asked. ‘You don’t even know me, or my boss. Why won’t you just leave and do whatever you want?’
‘You’re so boring!’ Tony whined. ‘I’ll do it, but this is worth at least five of the favors I owe you. I only ever asked you for small favors and this is huge.’
As he got out of the subway Steve pulled his jacket a little closer around his shoulders. It was cold, the sky was grey, and a soft drizzle soaked his jeans. He knew he should have brought an umbrella, it would be really annoying if he got sick, but at the moment he didn’t care.
'Aren't you bored on your own?' Tony asked. 'This is my third day of traveling and I don't see why people like this.'
‘You don’t,’ Steve answered. ‘You either go and suffer through the evening, or you won’t go and suffer Nat’s wrath for the next few weeks.’
‘Long story,’ Steve said. ‘And it’s been seventy years. We weren’t even dating seriously yet, so I’m over it by now.’ Steve looked up at Tony, who was still standing. ‘Can I ask you a, well, more personal question?’
‘What?’ Tony asked. ‘Why don’t you just go yourself and have a fun date. Bring the chick here for the night if you want, I don’t care, but why would you want me to take your place?’
Tony turned in the direction of Steve's voice. He pushed the bushes aside and found his boyfriend sitting on a big rock, enjoying the view of the slowly setting sun. He beckoned Tony to sit next to him.
‘No, no, no, the project is fine, we’re almost there!’ Tony said quickly. ‘The opening is planned for next week. Pepper and Natasha arranged everything. You’re coming too, right?’
'Stop looking at other girls,' Natasha said to her boyfriend as she walked out the ladies room. 'You won't like me when I'm jealous.'
‘Forget I said that!’ Tony said quickly. ‘Terrible first impression. Tony definitely doesn’t make lame sexual jokes about people he thinks are hot. Nope. Definitely not. Never. I’m the most romantic guy ever. I’m all about candles and rose petals and holding hands. See, we’re holding hands. Totally romantic.’
The room settled into a comfortable silence, only interrupted by the scrape of cutlery against the various pots and pans they ate from.
Nat, Barnes, and Steve took a final once-over of the scene from the window and filed outside, gens turning signals to each other as they went.
The pair weren’t playing together, but found satisfaction in being the last two remaining. Steve suppressed a gleeful grin expertly.
Doom’s breathing had become strained and rapid, and Tony only tightened his grip. He wanted Doom to suffer, to die
Of course, not all of them would be going. Sam and Clint still had broken bones, and Rhodey needed more time between missions than the others at the moment; field work was out of the question. Instead, they would stay at the farm, sifting through the data and using their resources to see if they could find any leads on this rumoured vault Hydra had been infatuated in for over seventy years.
“I’m happy now, I like being… me. I don’t feel like I need to date anyone,” she replied. She meant it as well, it wasn’t just some lame excuse like the kind Steve always gave her when she attempted to set him up. “If I meet someone I like, you’ll be the first to know, then you can pay for our date. Happy?”
