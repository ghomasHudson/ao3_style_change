They--well,
“But nothing,” Tony said.  He put his hand on Natasha’s shoulder and jabbed a finger at Steve.  “Tell him to let her do it.  Use your Jedi mind tricks, Vulcan brain...crushing...thing you do and make. Him. Do it.”
Beneath him, Tony felt Steve’s breath quicken. The sensation spurred him on, making him move faster, harder, lifting them both higher and higher, reveling in the sound of Steve purring his name again and again and again. Tony assaulted his shoulder with his mouth, sucking bruises on his skin, coloring him a dark purple that would fade in minutes, but while it was there, made that elemental part of Tony’s brain shout
They spent the morning going over party stuff, then Howard asked if he wanted to grab a slice of pizza for lunch. Tony said yes. He said yes pretty often now. When he’d first moved back, he’d said no a lot. Howard never got upset. He’d just say “Maybe next time, kiddo,” and leave Tony alone...
So, Tony read him
“What do you need from me?” Strange asked.  “A character reference?  Medical records?  What does he need?  I’ll do what I can for him.”
Steve tapped Tony’s knee with the back of his hand.  “Hey, Tony, look, it’s Hans Gruber.  Tony--” He stopped.  Tony was sound asleep beside him.  His face, usually pinched with worry or alight with manic glee, had smoothed out and softened.  His hair fell over his forehead.  One hand was tossed lightly over his stomach, the other lay on the couch, palm up, clean, white, and somehow vulnerable.
"We didn't," Clint said.  "We just knew you weren't
flashed through Tony’s mind.
“Good,” Steve answered. “Fun. I finally let Sam beat me at pool. Now he only owes me four thousand, five hundred and sixty dollars.”
Tony stole one of the blankets off the bed and wrapped it around himself.  He’d kicked his jeans off before getting into bed and didn’t bother trying to find them.  If whoever was at the door wanted him that bad, they could have him like this.
“You’re very welcome, Captain.”
“I’m sorry, Mom. It was late, and Tony was really upset. His dad-”
“I guess. They’ve called a lot. The National Guard did too, but the guys from the Army just laughed when I told them that. They said they had a lot more to offer than the
He turned down both sides and went into the kitchen for a glass of water.  It was strange for him to be so nervous.  Ordinarily, he’d just go leap into the bed, right in the middle, and let Steve roll him to whichever side he wanted, but that wouldn’t work here.
"Steve."
The warehouse buried in ivy would make a gorgeous picture.  Tony could hang it in the garage next to the one of the Bentley and the half dozen others he had begged, sweet-talked, or outright stolen from Steve over the months they’d been together.
I live for supportive friends...and kisses.
He pushed the button and stepped inside when the door opened.  A voice came through the speaker, authoritative, decidedly masculine.  “Access code.”
“How long have you been out here?”
“I don’t think that’s the technical term, but yeah, all kinds of mental-healthy.”
Tony touched Steve’s cheek, turning his face to look at him. “But I still wanted them. I didn’t care if it was just a trope. I wanted them. I always wanted them. I still want them.” He put the chain around his neck. He was still wearing his shirt, and he tucked them inside the neck of it, pressing them against his chest. Against his heart. He kissed him, and Steve felt the full force of his love in that simple act. “I love them, baby. Thank you.”
what happened, but whether or not he actually remembers, I don’t know.”
He glanced up and down the road one more time, searching for Tony’s car, and when he didn’t see it, he left the theater, and went to the diner. He looked for Tony outside, then went in and sat down.
Then Steve was in his arms, holding him, kissing him, making him whole again.  “Tony,” Steve said into his shoulder.  “Tony.  Tony, Tony, Tony.  I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I didn’t believe.  I just...I've been so lost.”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and squeezed once before releasing him.  “Don’t be too hard on her,” he said.  “If it wasn’t for her, you’d be sulking in the lab right now.”
“That’s not it.”
Tony poked again. He wasn’t sure what body part it was this time, but Clint’s head popped up from somewhere further up. “...thefuck, Stark?” he muttered. Nat moved against him, and he petted her hair. “Shh. Just us,” Clint whispered, and she stilled again.
Tony drew in a breath.  He blinked.  Something was dawning in his eyes, something like realization.  Steve didn’t look away, but a battalion of butterflies were suddenly loose in his stomach, flapping their many wings, trying to get out.
Steve didn’t know. Even now, sitting here in this bar, thinking about how senseless and stupid what happened was, he didn’t know. Thinking about how, if he had been taking care of his men the way he should have been doing, this wouldn’t have happened. Thinking of Tony. And Bucky. And Jonathon. And Natasha. And his mother. Thinking it would have been better if he had been the one to step on that pressure plate. Thinking it would have been a relief.
“Both,” she said simply.
But Steve just nodded against his chest. “Yeah, that’s just what I mean,” he said. “It’s nice, isn’t it? Having somebody you can count on? Somebody to keep you warm when everything around you feels cold?”
When they got to the bedroom, Steve pushed him gently down onto the bed, then pressed his lips to his forehead. He turned to his chest of drawers and rummaged around until he found a t-shirt and sweats and handed them to him.
But first thing’s first…
Tony broke away, and let out a breath. “‘Kay,” he said. “Let’s go.”
“I want hot chocolate.”
“No, sir, it isn’t harsh at all.  A salute is a show of respect.  The inmates have broken the law and have lost that privilege.”
“That’s not why it’ll always be just you, baby,” Tony said. “It’ll always be you because you’re my everything.” He kissed Steve’s neck. His shoulder. His cheek. Everywhere he could reach. “You’ll always be my everything.”
Steve looked up. His eyes were very bright, sparkling with love and a light sheen of unshed tears. He shook his head. “That doesn’t scare me.”
Steve exhaled as they began to pass food around the table.
, her eyes said.
Nat smiled and when she did, the curve of her lips became the only thing in the world. “Tell you what,” she said and tapped the kid’s wrist with one red nail, “you pour two drinks for me, walk away, and you get the satisfaction of knowing you made my night.” She nodded her head in Steve’s direction. “And Captain America’s.”
With every word Tony said, he could feel the rigidity leaving Steve’s body. Felt him relax. The softness Tony so craved in him returning. “You don’t?” Steve asked, his voice a feathery whisper.
“It’s really interesting. And really educational. And while it doesn’t feature any men in tights, there
“How long?”
“Okay,” Tony said forcefully. He knocked Steve’s feet aside and grabbed the front of his t-shirt in both hands. “Get over here,” he said, pulling Steve toward him. “I want you to keep talking. I want to hear everything you’ve got to say, but I need to touch you while you do, okay? I can’t listen to you say stuff like that while you’re all the way over there.”
Tony huffed at him and rolled his eyes. “Fine. Next Christmas, cell phones all around, okay?”
“I don’t know.  I’m sorry.”
“Me too, baby,” Tony said. “Me too. Just another second, okay? Can you hold on?”
A miniature war was then waged inside Steve’s body. The brain wanted to tell him to fuck off. The rest of him, however, staged a coup, and won--for the moment, at least. He smiled, looked at Tony from under his lashes, and Tony seemed to ease a bit. His eyes got warmer. His lips curved up into a little smile of his own. Steve was glad. More than glad. Thrilled.
She looked down and those startling blue eyes opened.  Zemo had said there were flecks of green in them, but Natasha had never seen them.  Over the years, she’d been more than just a casual observer of those eyes, and they were as perfectly ocean blue as they’d ever been.
“Getting there. Three more minutes and I’ll be good as new.”
spot.  It wasn’t an answer, but Steve took it as one, anyway.
“Is sound asleep,” Tony said. “In her bed. With the door closed.”
He looked older, but not old. His hair had been mostly gray the last time Steve had seen him at graduation, and it was almost white now, but it didn’t make him look “old”. More distinguished, if anything. His eyes were the same too. The color of Tony’s, but a bit cooler, a bit harder. He was thinner, though. He’d always been thin, but he was verging on skinny now. His clothing fit well, but Steve could see he’d changed even so.
“Yeah.  That felt a little off.”
“Will do.”
Steve’s shoulders eased, the hum of electricity eased with it, but the warmth remained.  The warmth that was Steve.  Just Steve.
“I wanna go home.”
“That’s fucked up.”
“News to me.”
The words came out on a shuddery breath, “God, I hope so.”
“Yeah.”
"He was shot."
“I bailed on you.”
“Nothing,” Steve said, and a jagged laugh fell from his lips.  “
Tony squeezed Sarah’s hand again, then picked Morgan up and kissed her. “Thanks, peanut. I’ll be up soon, ‘kay?”
booth, Steve felt better than he had in a long time. He was going to be going to school. He liked his jobs. He loved his friends. He loved his home. And mostly, the most important thing, was that he had Tony. The one thing he adored above all others. His perfect match.
He nodded.  “They think I was buying drugs from some guy.  Did they tell you that?”
“But...can’t you just tell them
“It’s okay,” Tony whispered.  “It’s okay.  I’m right here.  Everything's going to be okay.”  He kissed Steve’s shoulder again, then just stayed there, mouth pressed against him, separated from his hot skin by only the thin fabric of his t-shirt until Steve reluctantly released his hand.
“Yes.”
Steve went impossibly still.  Lying atop Tony, hovering over him, his eyes burned with dark want.  His breath was heavy but controlled.  His heart beat fast and light, but he didn’t move.  “We’ve never…”
is what we lit candles for. What we prayed for.”
“Do you want to talk for a while?”
you.  He wanted you because you were a good man.  There was something ‘indefinably noble’ about you.  Those were his words, not mine.”
“We’ll keep your spot on the team.”
Maybe some time to regroup was a good plan.
seen. He was all-encompassing. Everything. Just everything. The memories of Josh, of Pepper, of any of his other lovers were obliterated. How could they compare to this? How could anyone ever compare to the feeling of Steve Rogers pushing--gently at first, oh so very gently--into him, the stretch, the burn, then the ecstasy as he started to move, dragging in and out, leaning down to kiss him, to suck on his neck, overlaying his own marks on top of those left by Josh’s now-inconsequential mouth.
Steve cast a skeptical eye around the small cabin.  “I don’t think we’d all fit.”
“I don’t know,” he said.  “I just...I love you.  I love you baby, and I think, all this time, I’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop.  You know?  And I think I just realized today that there
Tony sighed into the awkward silence that fell between them. Steve felt like he had said something wrong again. He felt like he needed to apologize--again--but he wasn’t sure what for, or how to go about it, so he just waited for Tony to talk instead. Or hang up. There was that possibility too. Possibility? Probability. Because that was what would happen. That was what should happen. Thad hung up on him a lot. Whenever he said something wrong, Thad would just hang up the phone and not answer until Steve called him three or four times to apologize. Tony had never hung up on him before, but-
“Shh,” Tony said. “I don’t hate you.” He laughed a little, sniffed back his own tears. “I just said I was going to love you forever, didn’t I? You think I say that to all the guys?”
Tony shot Steve a victorious look. Steve rolled his eyes. “We’ll see,” Tony said. “Let’s go get you in your pjs. Say good-night.”
“No one in this room is completely
He picked up Steve’s letter to Ross and read it through again.  His heart filled with tender love thinking of all the hours Steve had spent agonizing over this little one-paragraph, carefully-worded, impeccably-formatted letter.  He wished he could see Ross’ face when he read it.  Wished he could spit
“That’s why I came back too.”
“No,” he said, then rolled his head back and closed his eyes again. “Okay. Yes. I’m sorry.” He ran a hand over his face and back through his hair. It felt damp and unpleasant between his fingers. “Please don’t be mad.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, then laughed.  “Are you kidding?  This is great.”  He grabbed them both in an impulsive hug, and Peter jumped into the fray, wrapping his arms around them all.
“Fuck no.”
Afterward, Tony licked a little circle with the tip of his tongue.  “This is mine now, baby,” he said.  “Henceforth, nobody touches it but me, ‘kay?”
Steve laughed again, quiet and dark.  “Don’t be too hard on me.  It’s only my second one in what?  Eighty years, or so?”
Tony went into the house, saw the bed was empty, and looked out the window.  Steve was sitting on the back deck in his chair.  His head was bent, exposing that beautiful, long expanse of skin at the back of his neck.  Tony loved that part of him.  Loved every part of him.
When they got to his door, Steve unlocked it and stepped aside so Tony could go in first. Tony looked around, feeling immediately the warm feeling of being home. It was certainly nothing like his own house. It was small but bright, and two of Steve’s paintings were hanging on the wall along with a bunch of framed photographs.
“‘Kay.”
“Yours, too.”  A tear fell from his eye and he brushed it away absently.
They’d eaten dinner, chatting and laughing, talking about everything but one thing, then settled in to watch the movie.  Bruce fell asleep thirty minutes in, and Tony and Natasha watched the rest while the snow began to fall outside.
--to spend some time with him again after these last weeks of missing him so much.
“Fuck, yeah,” Tony said, and Steve ducked his head, grinning.  “In fact,” Tony went on, “let
be too soon for that."
“I should have killed you the first time.”
Steve swallowed. “See what?”
“You may not pass him anything or accept anything he may try to pass to you.  No physical contact is permitted.  You must be quiet and respectful at all times.  If you break any of these rules, you will be asked to leave, and you may not return.  Do you understand?”
He opened the door to Tony’s apartment with his key. Dodger met him at the door, and Steve petted him for a while, hugged his shaggy, wiggly body. Dodger always met him. Every day since the day he’d gotten him, he’d met him at the door whenever Steve went out without him. Even here, where Steve knew he was asleep in Morgan’s bed, he still somehow met him at the door. Still knew when he was coming. That felt good.
Tony nodded his head. “That might be true,” he said. His fingers slipped up through Steve’s hair, relishing that silky texture. “I don’t like seeing you upset. Sue me.”
crowded, and Steve didn’t really like crowds that much anymore. He was getting better--he felt like he was getting a little better, anyway--but he still didn’t like crowds.
Tony laughed.  “You were right.  You’re a little bit funny.”
Steve’s hands wanted to move to Tony’s hips. Wanted to squeeze him, and pull him even tighter against him, but they didn’t. That training overrode his desire again, and he was grateful. And hateful. All at the same time. “It’s a ‘let’s get coffee in the morning’,” he said, and shoved his hands into his pockets before they could break their training and just do whatever they wanted instead. “But just as friends, okay?
And Steve’s.
but you said having Wanda do it was...what was the word you used?  Oh yes, dangerous.”
“Not that I know of.”
He looked back at the bar. Josh, occupied with kissing him, didn’t notice. At least, Tony assumed he didn’t notice, but he had kind of forgotten about Josh again. Steve was turned in profile, and all Tony could see was the sharp jut of his jaw. The soft pout of his lips. He was talking to the guy sitting next to him. Tony thought it was the guy he’d come in with, but he couldn’t say for sure. He’d been a bit too preoccupied with the sight of Steve himself when he came through the door to pay much attention to his companion, but he was paying attention now. He was maybe a little shorter than Steve, a little smaller, but he had dark hair and eyes that popped even in the dim room. Tony felt a frozen ice-pick stab of jealousy go directly through his heart.
Steve pushed Tony’s shirt up and pressed a gentle, friendly kiss to the skin he’d uncovered, then let the fabric fall back and curled tighter into Tony’s side, dragging the blanket with him, wrapping it around himself.
“The same thing you just said.  I just couldn’t think of what else would make him act so strange.”
“What you need to focus on is your mission,” Nick said.
“I don’t know about that,” he said, looking at his own hands. “I just thought it was lonely.”
Steve glanced back down into his cup. Tony watched his thumb move around the rim. “I was pretty messed up until you came to school there,” Steve said without looking up. “I’d never had any friends. All I had was my mom.”
I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the night.  Kind of a nice feeling after the shit couple of months I've had! :)
She smiled.  “You both needed it.”
So there.
Strange sighed again.  “I’ll talk to you about this once.  Just this once, then I can’t talk about it again, alright?”
“I don’t know.  He just seems…”
He tightened his grip on her.  “Well, I wish you didn’t.”
Steve turned his back.
“I could do it in the dark,” Steve replied, “but yes.”
died.
Steve hummed in contentment, finally easing completely into Tony’s arms, going pliant against him. “Good,” he said.
Tony cocked a brow. “You’re talking about me, right?”
bagels generously smeared with cream cheese, he went directly upstairs, showered, then went to bed.
“Are you sure you don’t want a cheeseburger or something?” Tony asked, arching an eyebrow at Bruce’s plate. “You’re making me sad. Lunch should not be a sad-time endeavor.”
“Hi, Nat.”
“Doctor Strange?” Steve said, his eyes never leaving Wanda’s.
“I found him,” she said finally.
He went up the elevator, trying to keep his mind blank.  He kept it blank as he got off and walked down the hallway.  The conference room door stood open.  Steve stepped inside, all confidence and empty mind, then stopped in his tracks as his head exploded with Tony’s name.
Steve kissed him again. His hair was hanging over his brow, his eyes filled with a complication of emotions--desire, humor, love. Mostly love. “Think you’re still in good enough shape to get on top?” he asked. “Or are you gonna make me do all the work?”
“Tony,” he said, and his voice was the same.  That same baritone that, for a while, at least, had meant everything was right in Tony’s world.
Steve didn’t touch him. Didn’t come near enough to touch him. He skirted around the other end of the couch and stopped at the entrance to the tiny kitchen. “Do you want a drink?” he asked, and gestured toward the cupboards with the glass already in his hand.
, Tony thought, and couldn’t help the sappy feeling that built up in his own stomach while he watched Steve pick one out, put it into the player, say “Damnit” under his breath, take it out, turn it around, and put it back in. Soon, the sound of The Eagles doing
“But-”
A flutter of panic raced through him.  No.  Tony’d be okay.  Better than okay.  He’d mourn him, sure, but it wouldn’t keep him down forever.  He’d get over it.  Get over
“Okay.”
Tony cast his thoughts out for anything.  Everything.  “We fought over the toothpaste that time,” he said urgently.  “You told me you don't really like milk but you still drink it for the calcium.  You’ll only sleep on white sheets for some reason I don’t know and you won’t tell me.  You say you don’t like rap, but you know every word to ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’.  I don’t even know where the hell you heard it.  You got pissed when I called us the Matthew and Mary Crawley of the Avengers.  You--ah, Christ, what else?  You love peas, but you hate corn.  You
“He’s also, apparently, a real asshole who likes to beat up old guys.”
“And why is that, Steven?”
“Hey, Tony.”
“No,” he said, giving her a tired smile.  “It doesn’t matter anymore.”
“You know, they won fair and square.”
“I’m not going to apologize for finally giving that fucking prick what he deserves, Steve.”
Because he was here to work. Work was all that was supposed to happen here. But now there was this. This Tony-shaped monkey wrench that had been thrown into the whole works.
“Scary?” Tony asked bitterly. “I froze. She was just lying there, and I froze. I could see she wasn’t moving. Her chest wasn’t moving, like she couldn’t
Tony threw a grape at him.
Steve went back to the bed and picked up his last box, then put it down again and picked up one of the photographs. It was of the two of them, Pietro looking at Steve, Steve looking at the camera, smiling, the sun in his eyes, his arm around Pietro’s shoulders.
When it was someone else’s blood, he found it a little more difficult to be grateful to Dr. Erskine. A little more difficult to think of his own good fortune when someone else’s had turned so sour. He tried. He still tried, but it was harder.
And then Steve was kissing him, and everything else was gone. All that remained was Steve. Just Steve.
Realization crashed into his body.  He felt stupid.  He should have known.  Why hadn’t he known?
Tony nodded immediately. “Yes. God. Yes.”
“Almost eleven.”
Tony was sitting there now. He’d been waiting for the last fifteen minutes, checking his watch every few seconds, wondering where Steve was. He had his Calc book out, but he’d only worked one problem. Not that it was much of a problem. Not for him, anyway. He could have whipped through the book in a matter of days, but he didn’t. He knew if he worked too quickly or too well, his teacher would tell his father, and then Howard would pull him from this school and send him to a private one.
Tony curled easily into him, and Steve's arms wound around his waist, his head against Tony's chest.  Neither of them thought about it. Their bodies knew where to go, what the placement of their limbs should be, knew just where they belonged.  Like puzzle pieces or praying hands, they knew exactly how they fit together.
Steve gave up trying to study.  It was getting close to being close to dinner-time.  If he started now and moved slow, by the time he was done cooking, it would
“Will you stay with me?”  His eyes gazed up at him timidly.  “I don’t want to be alone like last time.  It was cold.  And dark.”  His mouth trembled.  His whole body trembled.  “I was scared.”
“I don’t get jealous.”
“You know me,” Steve said, a small dark smile curving his lips, “I love a good snuggle.”
“You should have told me.”
Her breath caught in her throat, but she wiped the blood away from his face again.  “Yes, you are.  You’re strong.  And you’re stubborn.  You can make it on that alone.”
Tony got to work.
Tony cocked his head.  “I might have over-shot with the betrayal stuff,” he admitted.  “I was just mad.”
Sam shook his head.  “You know better than that.  Erskine didn’t design Steve.  He enhanced him, maybe, but he didn’t design him.  Somebody else did that.”
He closed his eyes, letting the wall hold him up, waiting for his shakes to subside. When they finally did, he gulped his coffee in three large swallows. It helped. Helped ease his mind a little. And when he remembered to breathe, it came out steady. That helped too.
Tony laughed.  “Fuck yes, I could!  But try telling Ross that.  He starts blathering about budgets and profit and loss and blah, blah, blah.”  He shook his head.  “I tried telling him it would be more cost-effective in the long run to just do a new suit, but he doesn’t want to hear it, so here I am.”
Steve raised his hand in confession. “I picked ‘pool’,” he said, and bumped Tony’s shoulder with his own, throwing him a careless, calculated grin. “But I think I remember being told I was ‘Insane to the
have a sleepover, you know,” Tony whispered, his breath tickling Steve’s ear. “I’d love that.”
“I do know, and I love that, but it also makes us a bigger target.  You never know when somebody might get it in their head to try and take us out.  Again.”
Steve fidgeted, barely keeping his thumb from his mouth.  He’d been doing better.  The nail, while still brutally short, had started to grow back and Steve tried to keep it neat.  Tony didn’t say anything about it, didn’t want to draw attention to the face that he’d even noticed.  Steve’s pride was a delicate thing, sometimes.  Tony didn’t want to accidentally hurt it.
The sun was just starting to come up over the horizon when they got to the bus station.
“I contacted medical personnel.  They’re here.”
“Would I be mad if you punched a kitten?”
coffee-addict.
“Thank you, sir,” he mumbled, scrubbing a hand over his face.  “I’m sorry.  Thank you.”
“It’s okay, FRI,” he said.
“You’re kidding me.”
“They liked you,” she said.
Steve looked at him, his fingers still moving, stretching him out. “What’s so funny, Stark?” he asked.
“Sure,” she said, and sat down in Steve’s seat, raising her hand to signal the bartender.
“I thought you had a lab in this place.”
“Be ready to leave as soon as we get back inside, ‘kay, Jerry?” he told the pilot.  “I’ll wait for him out there.”
Steve chuckled under his breath, but that was all. He tried to stay neutral on his guys’s little squabbles--but he kind of thought Gabe had a point. Steve missed the triumphant grin Bucky sent Dugan when he laughed, though. Dum Dum flashed Bucky his middle finger, but silently chalked up another point for him in their little game. March. He’d take the lead in March for sure.
Tony shrugged. “He’s not that young, Steve.” Steve laughed again, and Tony felt his whole world right itself. He was back on axis and back on track. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and hugged him. Steve hugged back. “I’m still sorry,” he said into Steve’s broad shoulder. “I don’t ever want to make you feel like I don’t trust you. I’ll put first-impression-Tony back in his cage, okay?”
“I am.  You want to stay out here, we stay out here.  Like I said, I’m flexible.”
“Will you still love me?” Steve asked, wrapping him up in his arms again. “When I
--and they walked out of the bar together.
And as much as he adored her and missed her, he kind of wanted to mope for a while. He thought he’d earned a good mope.
He didn’t realize he had been waiting for Natasha until she padded into the kitchen.  She was still wearing his t-shirt, khaki-green with US ARMY across the front, but she had slipped on a pair of pants at some point during the morning.  Her face was innocent of make-up, but her nails were still the dark red they had been the night before.  Her feet were bare.
for nefarious purposes.”
know. He knew what Tony did to him, though. How helpless he rendered him. How loving him was the most important, honest, lovely, perfect thing he had ever done. He knew
Fuck you, Steve Rogers.
Suddenly, Steve began to shake.  His entire body began to convulse, his broad shoulders quaked.  His head twisted from side to side.  Beside him, Wanda thrashed.  Her long hair was a whirlwind around her head.
“I’m sure.”
Tony nodded. “Means a lot to me, too.”
When it was over, Steve shook Strange's hand.  "Thanks, Doctor. I'll see you in a few weeks."
“Where are you going?”
“Steve?” he called, as he left the bathroom.  “Baby, where are you?”
“Make it eleven.”
“Yes, boss.”
a helium balloon.
She turned on her side, facing him.  Her breath was light on his mouth as she reached for him, her lips a feather-touch.  “I love you,” she whispered.  “I just wanted to tell you that before tomorrow.”
Steve sighed. “Business.” He looked at his hands. They were still shaking. “Just business.”
“Fifteen minutes,” Strange answered.
He sniffed again.
“Tony, come on,” Steve pleaded.  “We’ve got to get past this.”
Pietro faltered for half a second when he said that, then continued on out the door.
“How far along are you? Fuck, baby, give me a minute. Let me catch up.”
“You go home after your errand and sleep for at least four hours.” Steve opened his mouth to protest, but just like the doctor earlier, Sam overrode him. “And I’d feel better if you just came back in the morning. You’re exhausted. I really don’t think you
Now, sitting here in
Yeah.  She was Steve’s kid, alright.  Through and through.  “Really, sweetie, it’s fine.  Ross isn’t going to do anything rash.  Are you, Thad?”
Steve put his hand on Tony’s hip, squeezed it with his fingers. “Me too,” he whispered.
Tony shifted Morgan again. She squirmed in his arms, frowning in her sleep. “Where?” Tony asked, and Steve smiled apologetically.
“He’s alive,” she said, slipping unconsciously into Russian.  He knelt beside Steve and took the hand Natasha was not holding.
And just like that, the moment was gone.
Mostly.
“Quite a nose, Thad.  It used to be a barn.”
“We need to talk.”
Tony watched him. The music was loud, but for now, he barely heard it. His briefcase hung from one hand. The flowers that he’d bought for Steve on a whim from a street-vendor--silly, but he’d done it--hung from the other, forgotten. Ever since the other night and his encounter with Thad Ross, Tony had begun to really think about the future. About what he wanted. About what he needed. About how he wanted to spend the rest of his life. And who he wanted to spend it with.
“I’ve been told.”
“Yeah. Sure. As friends.”
He loved it.  He loved it and he feared it.  He craved it and was repelled by it.
“FRI?”
“Don’t go.”
Tony smiled.
And then he was gone.
He pulled the boot from Tony’s foot and tossed it aside, then reached for the fly of his jeans. Working with the methodical hands of one well-versed in his task, Steve pulled the zipper down, then slid the denim down Tony’s thighs. Before he could throw them away, Tony was able to find enough mental ability to say, “Wait. In the pocket. My wallet. There’s-”
“I’m good, Steve.”
Tony led him up to the door.  Same old door.  That hadn’t changed.  He shook the key out and opened it.
famous,” Tony said, slipping back into his usual tone of voice, part challenge, part brag, part flagrant flirting. “It’s so famous, people know it on three continents.”
And Steve. Steve made his head spin too.
Warning: a little bit of dubious science-y stuff ahead.  I know nothing, I'm just making it up as I go. I deal in feelings not facts, guys! I just want to write sad stories😉.
“Nowhere,” he said. “I’m just taking Dodger out.” he let his hand slip down to her plump little cheek and brushed it with his fingers. “I’ll be right back, okay?”
We just knew you weren't where you were supposed to be."  He squeezed the back of Steve's neck again. "We just knew you weren't with us."
“No. Steven. Go."
“Will you really buy me my Pop Tarts?”
“Look at ‘em go,” Tony said, pointing at the screen.
“Here,” he said, nodding to the bowl.
Tony nodded, his finger gently stroking Steve’s unmarked skin.  “It was nice.  It was really nice.  Do you remember what happened then?”
Tony rubbed his cheek against the yellow fur.  “Sure, he’s a little
“You used to roll eight miles around the lake, Steve.  That twenty yards wasn’t going to kill you.”
“Tony, is it okay if we don’t talk?  For a little while?”  Tony frowned, and he went on.  “We
“You did,” Tony said. “I think the stuff you said to her the night before you left, and then being there when you
“You need a ride, big guy?” Tony asked.
Instead of saying them, Steve kissed him again--one last time to pay for all.  “I will see you in the morning, won’t I?” he asked.  “Thor said something about a warrior’s feast?”
Just like that, he started to cry.
Tony looked at him for a second, then frowned. He moved his hand down to cup Steve’s cheek. “You’re pale.”
“Tony.”
She walked to the door and Tony salt sulkily down on the stairs.  He’d only been here once before.  The decor was the same.  Mid-eighth-century freak show.  Nothing like the Tower with its sleek, smooth, modern style, or the cabin with--oh.
And now here he was, Nick babbling happily next to him on the floor while Tony folded huge bath towels and tiny little baby socks. Nat herself lay curled up on the sofa, a cup of tea sat beside her hand. She had a cool cloth on her forehead.

“And take care of yourself.”  He turned his stern eye on Steve.  “You too, Cap.”

Tony pressed sweet, lazy kisses to his chest. “What is it, baby?”
“Steve?”
“We don’t need another vote.”

"Do they ever suffer enough?
“Guess so.” Steve’s hand strayed to the button of Tony’s jeans. He touched it. Slid his finger across it, stopping only long enough to duck out of the t-shirt Tony pulled up over his head. The song changing over--
Steve put his hand on Tony’s hip and kissed him briefly over Morgan’s head. “Mm. Guess that wouldn’t be very nice of me, would it?”
Tony held his hands up in front of his face.  They had been dirtied with the dust of Peter Parker’s deteriorating body once.  He hadn’t been able to hold onto Peter.  He’d tried.  And when he tried, Peter had crumbled in his fingers.  Would that happen to Steve too?  The thought turned him cold, and although the night was warm, Tony Stark shivered.
he’d be able to wield it.  He looked like a god, Sam.  With that axe in his hands--” she broke off.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Tony muttered, tossing his tablet aside and leaning in to kiss Steve’s mouth again.
,” Steve said, still holding him, “I’d love it if you went with me to an open one sometime.”
“If I get home and see it sitting in the holder-”
And it was.
It feels like I haven't posted for a long time. Things have been kicking my ass. I have a long chapter written, but I was scared it was starting to get TOO long, so I decided to break it up into two sections. This one's a little short, but it was the most natural spot for a break. I will post the next part tomorrow or the next day.
Tony pulled away enough to look him in the eye.  He held Steve’s face in his hands.  His palms were very warm.  “You sure?”
“Hey, I didn’t
He closed his eyes, listening to Tony’s quiet, easy breath, feeling that same breath puff against his bare skin, and now all he could think was that it was worth it. Everything he had gone through, everything he had done, and felt. All the pain he had endured. All the times he had
Steve’s breath picked up as Tony’s hand moved.  His eyes were still closed, but he nodded.  “Yeah.  It was.  Faster, Tony.  Please.”
Bruce frowned a little, blushing.  “Yeah,” he agreed.  “That was mean.  I’m sorry.”
Steve shook his head, everything else suddenly lost in a wave of sensuality and feeling and complete and utter love for the man holding him. “No, Tony,” he said, and it was the right answer. He knew it was.
Steve kissed him deeply, his hand gripping him, moving faster, the heat between them scorching.  “Do it, then, Tony,” he said raggedly.  “Do it.  Let go.”
“No, it’s okay.”
“Knock it off,” Tony said lightly.  “I told you before, baby, it’s you and me.  Okay?  It’s always going to be you and me.”  Tony nudged Steve’s ankle strategically under the table.  “So quit trying to make me change my mind.  Right?  Seems like I've told you this before."
“Yeah.”

“I can’t,” Steve interrupted. “I have to meet Nick to-”
wait for you.”
“She’s going to find out eventually,” Tony said.
been happy until he met Steve.
Steve hitched in a breath and let it out in a rush.  “Will you try and find her?” he asked.  “If Vision’s gone, she doesn’t have anyone.  She’s alone.  We can’t let her be alone.  We’re her family.”  He blinked, and for the first time, Natasha saw tears in his own eyes.  “
“With us.”
He leaned back against the door and reached out to Steve. It wasn’t a far reach. “Steve,” he said, and tangled his hand in Steve’s t-shirt.
Steve shrugged. “Nothing. Just. You know. My meeting. That I go to. You know.”
Bucky stared at him, his eyes flicking back and forth between Steve’s, trying to read the truth in them. Finally, he barked out short laughter. “Your reasoning is so fucked up.”
Sam considered, then nodded.  “I’ll take it.  It’s almost the same thing anyway.”  He raised his hand to the waitress for another round.  Tony shook his head.
Steve had been right. He knew he would be.
She snapped a picture.
Steve put his head on her shoulder. He felt her hands lace together behind his back. It was familiar, that feeling. It was one of his favorite feelings. “Okay, Mom,” he said.
Steve closed his eyes and ran his fingers through her hair. “I have to go,” he said quietly, “It’s part of my job.”
Tony thought about making a joke about that. About
pancakes. She thought they were yucky. Who could be making bacon and panc…
“Do you mind?” she snapped.
and stuff?”
“Let him in, FRI.  Thank you, angel.”
He rested his cheek on top of Steve’s head, and when he did, he caught Clint’s eye across the deck. He was grinning at them, a dopey, delighted look that Tony could not help but return.
“Say it again.”

might entail, and he didn’t want to find out. The personal stuff wasn’t his area of expertise either.

“Yeah, baby.”
of it.  And even
Steve shrugged. It was a tired gesture, and Tony could see lines of strain around his eyes and mouth. “Don’t know. I walked around for awhile before I came here.”
Sam held him tight. “How’s the…?” he asked, and Steve knew exactly what he meant.
“Good.”
“I’m fine, baby, it’s okay.”
“No.  In fact, there were times when I’d never seen you happier.”
She held him for a little longer. He let her hold him. That was one of his favorite feelings too.
“Whatever you want, baby.”
“Why does what keep happening, baby?”
“Oh,” Tony cooed, to the cat, not Steve.  To the cat.  The goddamn
You don’t have to be scared.  ‘Cause it’s you and me, right?”
“I could help you, if you let me.”
“Leave that one,” Pietro said.

Steve nodded.  “Wanda was right,Tony.  He wanted to break me.”  He looked into Tony’s eyes.  There was fear there, and anger, and a steely indomitability that made Tony weak in the knees for a whole host of other reasons.  Pride.  Respect.  Love.  “But, I didn’t break, Tony,” Steve said.  “I didn’t.  Not again.  Not like--”
He took a deep breath before he went into the office. Ran a hand through his hair. He thought about taking his apron off, then decided against it. This was his job, after all. It was his uniform. If Howard wanted to come to his place of business to conduct whatever business
Tony lay back down and put his arm over his eyes. Dodger took the opportunity to lie down and put his head on his paws. “Think this is funny, do you?” Tony asked.
He drew in a breath.  It was the answer he’d expected.  And dreaded.  “Do you think Pepper knows?”
you do…”
Those three lines appeared between Steve’s brows.  “To who?  For what?”
Strange cocked an eyebrow in Tony’s direction.  “I do.  Especially when it’s a good cause.”
you know how paper works, Steve.”
Tony shook his head. “
“There’s never enough time.”
Tony snagged the flannel shirt Steve had abandoned on the kitchen chair yesterday morning and tugged it on, then made his way through the house to the glass walkway leading to the garage.  The heat and light in there perked him up even further, and when it opened into the larger space of the garage, Tony was finally able to do this.  The specs were done.  They were tight.  Perfect.  He’d just show them to Ross, have him rubber-stamp them, and get him out before Steve even knew he was here.
“Come on,” he said. “Bedtime.”
“Wanda made some. There’s plenty. If you’d like to join us.” He turned to Sarah. “Right, Mom?”
Tony looked into his eyes for a long time, searching them, then kissed him again, soft and long.  “Okay,” he said.  “Okay.”
“‘Kay. Hot chocolate for you, coffee for me.”
“I don’t really know where the lines are,” Steve said.  “But I’m pretty okay with this if you are.”
Steve scratched down the words Tony had said, then looked expectantly back over his shoulder at him.
“Yeah,” Steve answered, matching her tone. “I spot five security guards. Four points of egress. Two guys are packing. There and there.”
“Well, as long as it made you laugh, I’ll let you have your secret.”
“Two weeks?” Tony asked quietly.
“Well, you certainly don’t have to ask mine, you dummy.”
Tony sighed out a breath. “Steve,” he said.
Steve drew in a breath and crossed the threshold.  Nat smiled up at him and Clint did the same.  Bruce shook his hand.  Thor hugged him, and the room felt warmer, the sun brighter, his heart lighter.  There was trust here, and friendship, and acceptance.  Things he was sure were lost, he found here again in this room.
It had been a month since Tony came back to school. They were sitting in the cafeteria. Steve and Sam were on one side of the room, Tony and his entourage were on the other. It hadn’t taken long for Tony to gather up a large crowd of devoted friends. Steve knew it wouldn’t. They took up two tables. They were loud, exuberant, beautiful, filled with the giddy hilarity of youth. They laughed a lot. Threw things at each other. Clint and Natasha spent the entire lunch hour in a passionate lip-lock that no one could seem to break up, and after a few tries, they gave up and let them be.
“That’s stupid.  Go in the bedroom.”
Thanos was coming.  Through the connections both Nebula and Carol had, they heard.  He was on his way.  One day.  Maybe two.
“I promise.”
“Right where we should be.”
. It’s different when it’s us.”

. “It’s good to know he has a choice,” Steve said.
“Where did you even find it?”
Even through his joyful haze, Tony heard the desperation in Steve’s tone, felt the unmistakable wetness of his tears against his skin.
He left his paper, his pens, his books.  He grabbed his jacket out of habit, and pawed his phone out of his pocket as he left the murmuring, whispering room.
“Me too.”
“I love you so much, Tony.  Sometimes I’m scared of how much I love you.”
her family.”
“Tony,” Steve mumbled in his ear.  “Hey, umm.”
“Fine.  I was going to pay, but now I think you owe me.”
Steve fumbled for his keys, trying not to jostle Tony too much.  "Gee. I wonder."
A not-quite-comfortable silence fell between them as Jerry readied the jet for take-off.  The sound of the engine cycled louder, and they began to move.  They’d been in a lot of aircraft together, and Tony’s eyes fell to Steve’s hands as they took off.  They dug into the armrests, just like they always did.  Tony wasn’t sure why it happened.  Whether it was a reflex, or a fear, or even a pre-orgasmic throe, all he knew was that it always happened.  Maybe everything
is good or bad.”
“Nothing.  I don’t want anything from you.”
Natasha released Bruce and sat next to Tony.  “It doesn’t make you bad.  But it kind of makes you selfish.”
Tony looked at it for a long time, his mind casting helplessly back to all the times Steve had kissed him in the exact same place.  How nice it felt to have his lips there, how warm his breath was, how his hair brushed against the underside of Tony's jaw.
They plowed through a stack of classics after finishing with Lisbeth.  Tony closed the cover on
love that song.
Tony glanced back at Morgan and she  gave him a little wave. He waved back.
“Thanos,” he said.  “We need you.
Tony laughed a little but he did it. “Do you want me to close my eyes too?”
He had two years to live.
Steve shook his head and put his arm over his eyes. He didn’t want to feel like he was going to cry right now, but he did. He could feel tears threatening. And the fear that came with them. The fear that this might be too good to be true. That it was all going to slip through his fingers again. That he would never be able to hold onto it, because how could he? He’d never been able to before. He lost everything. Everything good. It was inevitable.
“Yeah.”
She gripped him tighter. Her eyes got darker. “Don’t tease me, Steven Rogers,” she said. “It’s not nice.”
“I think you’re seriously underestimating the power of your nakedness, Steve.”
He glanced at Morgan’s picture again, thought of the way she’d felt all curled up in his arms as he’d carried her into her bedroom. The happy sound of her voice babbling in the back seat of Tony’s car. How good that had felt. How sweet. Thought of Tony in his arms just a bit later. How good that had felt too. He looked back at his mother, then nodded toward the photo, smiling a tiny smile.
“I’m not afraid of him,” Ross said.  “I’m afraid of
Steve made carbonara four times that year. Tony flew them to Paris four times.  They didn't go see The Mona Lisa.
Tony could not resist any longer. He lifted Steve’s head and kissed his mouth deeply. Steve’s tongue slipped against his in a tantalizing dance, slow and sensual. Tony drew it into his own mouth and sucked it a little, making Steve moan in the back of his throat.
There were a lot of other things on his mind, though.
“What?”
“Not until you forgive me,” Tony said, continuing his onslaught.
--but he kept silent.  Ross wanted him to fly off the handle.  He had no doubt Ross believed every word he was saying, but if Tony responded that way, Ross would win.  Tony couldn’t let him win.  He’d won enough.
“Yeah?” Steve teased.
know who they were.  Even if they didn’t
Steve kissed his shoulder, loving the way he could feel the warmth of Tony’s skin against his lips through the fabric of his shirt. “She was right. You both are. I don’t know what either one of you are doing with me.”
He turned and started out the door, but he only made it two steps before Tony was latching onto his arm.
“No,” Jack said quickly. “I want to...eventually. I just-”
Tony reached out and clasped Howard’s free hand. The one that wasn’t already touching him. It was a distracted gesture, one he wasn’t even one hundred percent aware he was making. “Okay,” he said, his mind already putting Morgan into her car seat and speeding a well-known path to Steve’s door. “Thanks, Dad.”
Steve nodded. “Okay,” he said. “As soon as I get back, I’ll move my stuff in. The very next day.”
Howard listened, his head cocked, watching Tony speak. Tony hated that he could see himself in that gesture...except part of him, even now, didn’t hate it at all. Because part of him
“I wish
Tony patted his leg.  “Good man,” he said.  “But all this talk about corned beef is making me hungry.”
Steve said nothing, just held Tony tighter, frowning into his skin. Tony must have felt the tension in his muscles, though, because he reached back and rubbed Steve’s hip with one hand in a soothing, gentle motion. “That was a joke, Steve,” he said. “Laugh at it.”
“How are your wrists?”
This is the end, and the aftermath...at least until the next story.
Tony put his hand on Steve’s cheek and drew him forward.  He kissed his mouth soundly.  “Baby, it’s perfect.”
That made him nervous.
“Yeah?”
“Yeah.”
they?  True, there had been no touching aside from Steve’s clandestine handhold, and the occasional brush of shoulders as they sat next to each other or slight touch of their fingers when passing something back and forth either in briefings or at the dinner-table, but
“What do you mean?” she asked.  Her fingers toyed restlessly with the top button of Bruce’s shirt.
Tony let out a breath. He still seemed frustrated, and Steve’s brain was still getting off on that. Steve himself--the other parts that seemed independent of his now-in-complete-control brain--wasn’t. Those parts were feeling bad. They didn’t want to see Tony upset. “Well, are you going to at least
Sometimes he envied Bruce Banner for that.
Steve flashed surprised eyes at Tony.  “You two haven’t-?  Have you?”
Tony circled left, his fists raised slightly.  “What?  You said we should talk or
Tony huffed out a laugh. Steve heard the relief in it. And the happiness. “God, I’d fucking love that.”
“Don’t worry, Tony,” Bruce said.  “You don’t really have to do anything.  You just need to stand there and look pretty.  We’ll all handle the rest.”
He crossed to the bed and stood looking down on her.  She’d let her hair grow over the last few years and it spread out on the pillow like a red-gold fan.  Her lips were the plump cherry red he had kissed before she went away.  Her skin the same milk-white.
Steve nodded, glanced down, then looked back up, trying his goddamndest to smile in a way that would show Tony he really was okay. That Tony didn’t need to worry about him, or even think about him. “How are you?”
And there was no denying that, Tony found.  No defense against him.  He didn’t reply, just stepped around the chair and pulled himself up onto the vanity.  He settled one foot up, bending the knee and resting his elbow on it.  His other leg hung from the counter, foot not quite touching the floor.
essential,” Tony stressed.
“Yes, he did.
“I know you’re with somebody,” Tony said. His hand had fallen away from Steve’s arm when he’d bent to pet his dog, but he took it again now. Not just his coat this time, though. He grasped the bulk of his bicep and held it firmly, feeling the heat of it even through the wool coat he was wearing. “I know we can’t-”
“You’ve had a difficult year,” she said consolingly.
. Way better than some fucking doctor. And
Steve nodded emphatically. “
He blinked a couple of times. His hand had stopped patting Tony’s knee, but it was still resting on it. He wasn’t sure when he had put it there in the first place, but he liked the way it felt under his fingers. Warm beneath the rough denim of Tony’s jeans. He swallowed, and a blush was starting to heat his own cheeks. He could feel it happening, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. It just happened. He could no more stop it than he could stop today from turning into tomorrow.
Bruce looked at his watch.  “We’ve got to…”
“Yeah, baby?”
“Yeah. Very soon.”
I’m tired of glacial, Steve. I don’t want to do glacial anymore. I want...what’s the opposite of glacial?”
Tony slanted a finger across his lips.  Whether it was to keep her from speaking or himself from vomiting, he didn’t know.
“Just...please.”
Steve shook his head.  "Yeah, you have."
Tony shrugged. “It’s true.”
“Yeah.  It was.”
one, but I don’t object to one either.  Seriously, though, did they send you to watch me?”
He stood up and ruffled Steve’s hair.  “No, I’m tired, too.”  He leaned closer.  “Besides, if we cut out now, these guys have to clean up.”
“Shut up, Buck,” Steve said, and out of the corner of his eye--sometimes he fucking hated peripheral vision--he saw Tony’s date kiss his cheek, then his ear.
of him so close, but still too far away to touch.  All the shy glances, both given and received, the electric feeling of an accidental brush of a shoulder as they passed in the hallway, the way his eyes lit up when Tony came into the room, the way he smiled, the way he laughed, his hands, his voice, the curve of his neck…
Tony started, jerked out of a little daydream of Steve lying in bed beside him, head on a pillow, smiling at him just the way he was smiling at him right now.
“Yes, boss.”
Tony nodded. “I’d offer to send my masseuse over, but massage isn’t recommended during the first trimester. It adds to morning sickness.”
“It’s probably not good for it.”
Tony groaned. “Fine. I’ll see you at eight.” He swung his leg over the railing and perched on it like a cat. “Unless you’re interested in a kiss goodnight?”
“Sometimes I hate your fucking moral fiber.”
Steve put his free hand on Tony’s hip. “I’ll do whatever you want me to do,” he said sincerely.
“We need to get him to Wakanda,” he said, following her lead and speaking in their shared tongue.  “Shuri can heal him.  She’s got--what?”
“I’m getting you out of here.”
The half-smile again.  The down-cast eyes.  Oh, good Christ.
Tony pulled him closer, buried his face in Steve’s neck. “Then tell me you love me. Tell me we’re going to be together.”
Steve smiled softly, and sighed like he was giving up.  “Fine,” he said.  “But later, okay?  When I get home?”
“Pep, did they bring the everything-bagels? Oh. Tony.”
Steve bent to kiss Tony’s mouth.  Steve was deep inside him, moving with him.  His hands touching him, stroking him, bringing him closer and closer to the edge of the abyss.  “You feel good,” Steve whispered in his ear.  “Oh, god, Tony, you feel so good.”
Tony just shook his head, though. “No. I’m not sick.”
“Make what-” Steve began, then stopped. He could feel a blush rising out of the collar of his shirt. The shirt he was definitely wearing, which was good, because he usually walked around for half an hour or so without one after a shower, but for some reason, had thrown one on this morning. He smiled again. There was no stopping it. And no reason for it. This strange alchemy he was feeling was new. Very, very new. And very, very wrong. “I got a couple bucks in my wallet,” he said. “How’s that?”
“Baby,” Tony breathed, closing his eyes.
Phillips nodded without looking up. “Do it, Sergeant.”
, she wouldn’t be able to help herself. He knew she wouldn’t.
Steve lifted one shoulder in a shrug.  “Depends on the night.”
“Hold on.”
He didn’t know how long they stood there, intertwined.  All he knew was that Tony tasted like sugar-laced coffee and smelled like some spicy cologne that made him think of dark cobblestone alleys and early-morning sunrises.  He knew that when he slid his hand under Tony’s t-shirt, the skin at the small of his back was smooth and hot.  He knew that he wanted him in every way imaginable and he knew that once he had him, he’d never be able to let him go again.
After their fight, it was easier to avoid each other, so that was what they did. School was almost out. Graduation was in a few days. When they saw each other--which wasn’t that often, but inevitable--they gave each other awkward “hey”s, and then stood, shuffling their feet, mumbling about classes and finals. Muttering stuff like “maybe we should get together sometime...”, and replies of “yeah, but I’ve really gotta study too, so…” They let it go at that. Even though they both knew the other was lying. Right now, neither really cared. Right now, it was almost a relief to not have to deal with it. Deal with each other. Or, at least, the each other that had existed in Steve’s bedroom the last time they really, genuinely spoke. It was as if neither thought there was anything left to be said--Tony was going away for the summer. Steve was going away for what amounted to one-sixth of his young life--and they both hated it. Hated that the one person they had loved and trusted almost more than anyone else had let them down in such a deep, fundamental way.
“Steve.”  Strange.
“You should.”
“Mmm. Then come over. I miss you.”
He went into town and grabbed the few things he needed at the pharmacy and grocery store. He went to the pet shop and bought a box of those handmade dog treats that Dodger liked but Steve didn’t always buy because he didn’t want to spoil him
He’d have been smiling while he wrote that inscription, Tony was sure of it.  His grin mischievous, his eyes sparkling, knowing that anyone else who saw it would be either confused or mildly shocked.  But not Tony.  Tony would know it for what it was, that little inside joke.  It was their own language.  “I love you” in code.
“Nice not having to rush in the shower.”
“Again, lucky for you.  Where’s the lighter?”
, I trust you.  More than anyone.”
“Me too.”
Then Tony saw it--a man-shaped bullet streaking across the sky.  Red, white, and blue, back in the day.  Tony was thrilled when they’d changed it.  He hated the whole Americana aesthetic.
“Okay, good.  Thank you.”  Steve picked up his pen and held it poised over the paper.  “Fire away, boss.”
“Here,” he said. “You can wear these.”
Tony sighed again.  He was getting nowhere.  “Okay,” he relented, releasing him with one last lingering stroke against his cheek.  “Just be careful, huh?”
Steve turned his phone off and shoved it carelessly into his pocket.  He laid one hand on Tony’s knee and scratched it lightly with his short nails.  “No,” he answered.  “July’s soon enough.”
He shook his head at her and laid hold of the knob.  “Still asleep, FRI?”
good.”
“Nah,” Tony said. He laid Morgan down on the couch and covered her with the blanket. “It’s okay.” He bent and kissed her forehead, brushing her hair away. “‘Night, peanut,” he said. She turned her head on the pillow. Her eyelids fluttered.
me?” Tony asked. “Or is that too much to ask?”
“Come on,” Tony said.  “Talk to him.”
He straightened in his seat, his shoulders going back, his eyes narrowing. “Mr. Stark,” he said.
“Morgan, will you
Steve had said, he hadn’t hurt him, but Tony had heard the lie in his voice, and could see the truth in the droop of his shoulders, the red-rimmed eyes.
They both turned expectant eyes on Bruce.  He looked skeptical, almost uncomfortable in spite of the soft woman in his lap.
Strange watched him, his face blank, his eyes alight with apparent glee at being the cause of a Tony Stark meltdown.
“Come on,” Tony said again. “Stay.  I’ll even buy those gross blueberry Pop Tarts you like.”
Terror slipped into Tony’s heart.  Thunder crashed again; lightning followed somewhere close, somewhere just off the road, but Tony didn’t see or hear it.
“No,” Tony said, shaking his head.  “No, no, it’s not.”  He moved one sneakered foot until it rested against Steve’s.  He didn’t know if he could feel it, but it was a good place to start, an initial point of contact.  “Do you know when I first thought there might be something between us?”
“Uh,” Tony glanced down at himself, then over his shoulder at the loft where Steve lay asleep.
Not really Tony’s style, but it was turned low, and it fit this place, this atmosphere.  Light filtered through the windows, setting dust-motes dancing.  A cat snoozed on a radiator.  It was so homey and cozy, Tony wondered if The Hulk ever  had occasion to come out and play, at all.
The moment stretched out for a long time. Almost like it had that other time in the cafeteria so long ago now, when they first locked eyes across the room. Tony’s widened the slightest bit, those warm brown eyes that Steve had loved so much, that had gotten him through so many sleepless nights. Before they got together. After they got together. Even now. He still thought about them. Still dreamed about them. Just because Tony had gotten over him, didn’t mean the feeling was mutual. Steve thought about him all the time. Had never stopped thinking about him. Didn’t think he ever would stop thinking about him. And now here he was again, and they were looking at each other finally, and Steve’s whole world fell away until nothing existed but those eyes. Not even the guy currently curled up in Tony’s lap
Another kiss. Another slide of skin on skin. “We’ll figure it out, right?”
“No,” Steve breathed. “You’re the important one. You’re the one who should be taken care of.”
“Hi, baby.”
“You’re a bad boy, Steve Rogers,” he said, softly.
demand
Steve rose to his knee.  His head was bowed, his hair hanging in a sweaty tangle over his eyes.  His left leg stuck out stiffly behind him.  His right hand was still curled.  He was holding something, but Tony couldn’t see what it was.  It was too dark, Tony’s vision, too blurry.
“Ross,” Tony said, trying to control his voice, trying to mitigate this before it could blow up even further.  “Thaddeus, please.”
“‘Kay, peanut,” Tony murmured, but kept an eye on it, ready to catch it if it fell from her hand.
“J,” he said, grabbing a bottle of water and downing half of it. “Pull up the designs for Steve’s suit, will you?”
“I’m sorry.  I’m so, so sorry.”
“Yeah. They are.”
Tony stared at him.  “Please.  Baby, please.”
“Nope. Guess you’re stuck.”
Tony came up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist.  He rested his head against Steve’s back for a bit, then put his chin on his shoulder.  Steve stopped washing and stood still with his hands dangling in the water, just enjoying the feeling of Tony pressed against him.
The salesman raised an eyebrow and gestured at the watch still in front of him and the room in general. “We’re a vintage shop, sir. Classic is all we carry.” The corner of his mouth lifted in a cool smile. “However, if you aren’t seeing anything you like, perhaps you should try somewhere else. I hear Target has a fine selection of
“You’re welcome, boss.”
Steve dipped his face into Tony’s hair, trying to draw strength from his nearness, then shook his head. “He’s sleeping, Mom. I don’t want to wake him up.”
Of course, Tony knew.  It had been his suggestion all along.  Sam smiled at him approvingly.  Tony’s stomach fluttered in response.
And then he was down the old, familiar rabbit-hole of self-doubt and fear, with Howard right there in his head, agreeing with every bad thought he had.
Tony nodded.  “Yeah, baby.  You and me.”
Tony kissed him again.  “You’re welcome, baby.”
“‘Kay.”
Steve shook his head and put his hands in his pockets. Tony could see him blush even in the dim stairwell. “No. She, um. She said she was done with dick.”
Steve sighed. Nodded. “Yeah. He wanted to go with him. He wanted to.”
Steve and Tony shared an amused look over her head, then turned back to the TV. Tony kept his hand on the back of Steve’s neck, running his fingers through his hair. Steve tipped his head to the side, leaning into the touch. With Dodger lying on the rug near their feet, the lights turned low, and the warmth of Morgan pressed up against him, Steve didn’t think he’d ever felt quite so happy in his entire life. The nightmares of the night before seemed a million miles away.
Tony nodded. “Yup.” He flicked his hand over to where Morgan and Dodger were now
“We’ve talked about this,” Steve said, and a hand groped at him sleepily.
brought it to him, and if Steve could compromise his coffee principles sometimes, Tony thought he could reciprocate on the caffeine.
“Yeah.”
Steve met Tony’s blazing eyes.  A feeling of complete and utter awe swept over him, and with it came an understanding so deep it hurt.  They were broken.  Beyond repair.  And he would never be able to fix it no matter how hard he tried.
Instead of answering, Steve turned his attention to the door. He seated the key in the lock, and the door popped open at a turn of his wrist. He took Tony’s hand from his stomach and held it in his. He didn’t say anything. He just led him through the door, then once Tony was inside, reached past him to pull it closed.
they do.”
Tony shook his head. “Never give an inch, do you, Steve?”
“It wouldn’t have upset me,” he said.  “But ‘Cap’ I can handle.  Just don’t start calling me ‘Rogers’ again.  I hate that.”
Tony flung his free hand back behind himself, and at the same time, tightened his grip on Steve with the other. “I just scaled a building for you.”
Steve ducked his head, his cheeks flaming with embarrassment and pure joy.
“Then he’d be even more miserable right now,” she said. “He’s the happiest I’ve seen him since he was a little boy, sweetheart. That’s got a lot to do with you.”
“Hi,” Steve said when Tony stopped in front of him. He was leaning against the counter. The suit was a dark navy, cut close to his body, as per Tony’s instructions, with a black dress shirt underneath. The tie--blue to match his eyes--hung around his neck, but it was untied, the ends hanging loose. He was still smiling. It was Tony’s favorite one, small and soft.
Natasha came around the side of the car.  “I don’t care if he’s pissed.  Call him.  He’s been Steve’s doctor through all this.  He should know what’s going on with him.”
“But you’re going to see him tomorrow.  That’s a good sign.”
“And I think about
She exhaled and took his hand.  “Oh, Tony.”
Tony to love him forever. Even if it was just a little bit. He wanted to go to bed every night knowing that Tony might be thinking about him. Might be sitting at his desk, listening to a professor drone on, and think about studying together in the self-help section of the library. He wanted to know that Tony might be out on a date somewhere, or driving in his car, and when The Eagles came on the radio, he’d remember their first time--a lazy afternoon a million years ago in Steve’s tiny twin bed that still seemed to be big enough to hold them both. Every time. Every time they were together.
Steve did, and smiled a little.  Just the corner of his mouth, but it was a good one.  Tony loved that half-smile.  It was rapidly becoming one of his all-time favorite things.
They were back.  Everyone who was dusted was back.  New York was now a flood of people, a sea of people, standing around, talking, looking, searching faces for someone they knew, someone they recognized, someone they loved.  Voices called out names.  There were tears of happiness, of confusion, of fear.  Hands reached out, blindly grasping.  Mothers found children, husbands found wives, and those who didn’t find anyone they knew, simply clung to each other.  Strangers held hands, arms intertwined, tears were wiped away by unknown fingers, and it was the togetherness that mattered.  That these people were home again, whole, complete, that’s what they knew now.  That’s what they cared about.
, Buck.”
Howard looked down at his own hands, then nodded again. “You really are right, Steven. She and I have nothing in common.”
“Oh, Steve.”
He shook and shuddered his way through his orgasm, and at the height of it, fisted his hand painfully in Tony’s hair, and sunk his teeth into his own forearm, drawing a circle of tiny beads of blood on his skin.
.  Always said something.  Not this time, though. "You're crazy."
“I love you guys,” Steve sighed.  “Tell Wanda for me, too, okay?  Please?  Being with you, the three of you--” His head fell back onto the grass.  His throat worked.  He shuddered.
“Yeah?” Tony said, grinding his hips down into Steve’s, making him moan. “Is that what you want, baby? Want me to make the big bad wolf howl?”
“If you want.”
“What?  You got a thing for Neeson?”
Tony nodded. He looked past Sam’s shoulder to where Steve still sat, obliviously reading his book in the sun. “Georgia,” he said quietly.
“Come on.”
“Come get hot chocolate with us,” Tony said suddenly.
, throwing darting little glances his way every few seconds. Steve stared back until he finally could take it no more. He stood up and went back to where he’d been sitting with Bucky. He’d left his jacket there, and there it still sat. Nobody would want to steal this old, beat-up thing. He shrugged it on and went outside. He spied Bucky and Nat in the corner on his way out the door. They were dancing too, slow and close, hiding in the shadows, Nat’s arm up around Bucky’s neck, his cheek resting on her hair. They looked good. Happy. Good for them.
Steve reached out and touched his fingers shyly.  Tony folded them into his own.  Steve smiled.  “If you still want me to be.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Steve,” Tony muttered, then turned the menu around so Steve could see it, and stabbed his finger at the pumpkin sticker they had slapped onto it. “This, baby,” he said. “
“Sorry, folks,” Tony said, licking his lips to make the taste of Steve last longer on his tongue.  “Show’s over.  Encore performances later in the week.”
“Tell me what to write,” Steve said, closing his eyes in pleasure.  “You’re smart.  And you talk more than anybody I ever met.  And
“Mm.  Maybe,” Steve said.  “You
Steve touched his shoulder shyly. “Hi.”
He thought about what Rhodey had said when he'd come down.  Was this the way battered wives felt about their husbands?  Surely, they had to feel something.  It couldn’t all be fear of reprisal, could it?  Didn’t there have to be a love there somewhere?
Steve wanted to deny it, but all of a sudden, it felt like he hadn’t. That he’d just been awake for nearly a decade, and it wouldn’t be long before he died himself. Before he just tumbled into that abyss that had followed him around since he was a kid. Sometimes it had been hidden from his view, but it was always there. Always. And today it felt closer than it had in a long time. Almost as close as that night in Chicago. That night he wished he’d had his pistol so he could put the barrel between his teeth. Taste the gun-oil. Feel the sight scraping against the roof of his mouth, then pull the trigger. Just pull the trigger.
Tony closed the car door and waved as his friend drove away, beeping his horn twice.  He watched until the car was gone and dust had begun to settle.  He’d loved seeing him, but now there seemed to be a Rhodey-sized hole in his heart.
Five million dollars.
“I didn’t sign The Constitution either, Nick, but I still abide by it,” Ross flared back.
, it was always July in my head. We were always together and it was always July.”
“If you’re ever
“Bye, Pep.  Will I see you around?”
“Next time,” Steve said, holding him tighter.
She looked between them, one dark, one light, both radiating a pure clear sort of energy.  She and Steve were friends, but this was something else.  She didn’t believe in soulmates, but there was an alchemy at work here that was beyond mere friendship, beyond love.  Even being on the fringes of it, she felt exalted.  She could not imagine what it must feel like for the two of them at the center of it.  The thought was both frightening and divine.
A chance meeting.
“I’ll miss you too,” he said, trying to keep his own tears at bay. “But you’re gonna be going to your mom’s while I’m gone, and you’re going to be having so much fun you won’t even have time to miss me.”
But Steve was shaking his head. “No. I’m not.”
y, he thought.
Steve smiled, but his eyes were dark.  Faraway.
“Please?”
“Yeah, the prisoners?”
“You found it,” she said brightly. “Department?”
"I love dick," Tony said, and Steve laughed helplessly.
Howard sighed and moved his feet in the water, the shape of them like pale starfish. “I came to see how you are,” he said quietly. “I heard you and Pepper were splitting up. I’m sorry.”
Tony fell to the floor in a heap.  The flashlight slipped out of his hands and skittered across the room, throwing a kaleidoscope of light every which way.
wasn’t enough to keep a man from sleeping, Tony didn’t know what was.
“What?” Howard flipped the coin up in the air, and Tony caught it deftly, automatically snatching it out of the air. He looked at it. Small. Bronze. It said “To Thine Ownself Be True” on it. He frowned in concentration. He knew what it was. He’d seen one before, but he asked anyway. “What is this?”
Tony flexed his foot and nudged Steve’s thigh.  “Don’t be such a drama queen.”
owed him.  Ross wanted to say something nice.
“No.  I never felt like that.  You never made me feel like I didn’t belong anywhere.”
After a moment, Steve’s voice came again. It was barely audible, but Tony had excellent hearing. “You can come in.”
“He did not.”
Tony smiled now, thinking about it.  “Not technically,” he said.  “But
She opened the cupboard to get a mug, stretching on her toes to reach the one she wanted.  “You made coffee.  You’re my hero.”
Tony dug a sudden knuckle into that sensitive place in his side, and Steve flinched, laughing involuntarily. But he didn’t let go of Tony’s other hand. He held it tightly in his own. “And stop drinking so much,” Tony said sternly. “I don’t like it.”
with him? What the fuck was he doing here? What the fuck was he doing talking--flirting--with the one man he knew could, and would, fuck up his life more than anyone else in the entire world? Why was he purposely throwing himself into the lion’s den? “Weird because you didn’t like it, or weird because you liked it a little too much?”
“No, I’m fine, actually.”
His eyes opened but they were cloudy, unfocused, all the strength in them slipping away.  “Nat?  Where are you?”
Thanks for reading!
“Is Tony here yet?”
“Um,” he said, and tore his eyes away from Steve’s with a Herculean effort. He squeezed his daughter’s hand, using it to bring himself back to the here and now. It worked. Just enough. “Remember what you’re supposed to do before petting a dog?” he asked, and she smiled up at him, brighter than the sun that was still playing teasing games with the clouds.
Steve took in a deep breath, his chest rose beneath Tony’s hand.  “What are you doing?” he asked.
“I'm lucky
“Tell Tony I tried to wait,” he muttered.  “I just...got so tired.  It got so dark.  Tell him I wanted to stay.  Tell him...I wanted him.  For so long.”
Steve nodded. “Be right there,” he said, and Tony noticed the change in his voice. When he’d spoken to Tony himself, his voice had been like dark honey, dripping sweetness. With Sam, it was calm. Collected. Friendly, but with nothing like that hint of sensuality that pervaded it when he spoke to Tony. It almost sounded like he was another man. Thinking about it, Tony realized it had always been like that, and he liked it. Liked that he got something that no one else did. A version of Steve that was just his.
Steve's eyes remained troubled, dark, probing into Tony's in the night air.  "Has it been worth it, Tony?" he asked. "Being with me? It's okay if you say no, I know there's been a lot of-"
gross?
not that kind of doctor.”
Steve groaned.  “Don’t you think you’re taking this a little too far?”
, for Christ’s sake.
Thor picked up Stormbreaker and hefted it.  “The weapon of a god,” he mused, still looking curiously at Steve.
“Come on.”
“No,” Tony said, sharply.  “No, no, don’t do that, guys.  Please.”  He took one of Bruce’s hands and one of Natasha’s.  “You can’t do that.  You can’t fight.  Not you two.”  He took their hands and brought them together, then looked sternly at Bruce.  “Say you’re sorry.”
Steve was silent.  His eyes roamed from place to place--the lake, the boathouse, the meadows.
.” Tony hummed encouragingly, and Steve snuggled closer into him. “One day, I was walking. Near here. I wasn’t thinking about it. I never thought about it. That was sort of the point. That I could
“You sure you’re sure?”
“Sure,” Tony said.  “Take all the time you need.”
They were holed up in his and Tony’s bedroom, and when there was a knock on the door, Steve jumped.  Nat, characteristically, was cool-headed.  She just patted his shoulder and went to answer the door.
“Do you want my help or not, Tony?”
Sarah saw that. Saw how much he’d been hurt, that he was
“No,” Steve said with a dark surety. “He can’t.”
He walked back to the bar and tapped his glass. “Again, please,” he said.
“You didn’t want to hear.”
Tony laid back down while Steve pulled the blankets up.  If history told him anything, Tony knew he would throw them off halfway through the night.  He’d seen that enough over the last week.  He always started out with them, but in three hours, he’d throw them off, not waking, just a toss of his arm and an impatient sigh in his sleep.  A while later, he’d be shivering.  Tony would haul the blankets back up over him, and he’d burrow inside the sudden warmth like an animal burrowing under the ground to hibernate.
“I said,
Steve jumped to his feet and grabbed his lunch tray. “I gotta go,” he mumbled.
The tension remained in Tony’s body for a moment longer, and then he eased. Steve felt him nod against his back. “Okay,” he said. “Later.”
“It hurts.”
Steve nodded. “Yes. Okay? Yes. We’ll talk about it. We can stop somewhere on the way home. We can stop and talk about whatever you want to talk about. I promise.” He turned his head, trying to catch Tony’s eye. “But not right now. Please?”
“Yes, your highness!”
“I will.”
Steve turned his head to look at Tony, frowning just a little. “Where are we going?”
Steve shook his head, slipped his hand along Tony’s side, across his stomach, and touched the button of his jeans. “I don’t. I understand. It’s okay.”
“That’s right, baby,” Tony soothed, holding him tightly.  “It’s Bucky.  That’s right.  That’s just right.”
“FRIDAY, sweetie, are you with me?”
He lay there for another hour, then got up--slowly, so he didn’t wake Tony up again--and drug his clothes on in the dark. He found his way to the bathroom, peed, washed, and scrubbed a little toothpaste on his teeth. He wished he had his toothbrush. He thought he’d have to get one to keep here if he was going to be spending nights...and he smiled about that while he rinsed and spit. That was an interesting experience. One that, if asked, he never would have thought he’d have, but here he was. Smiling and spitting toothpaste out in Tony’s sink at five o’clock in the morning.
He sighed again.
Steve grasped his hips. “You’ll trust me on the presence of my toes, huh?”
Tony turned back.  “I guess I could sleep on the couch if you aren’t going to.”
“I’ll worry about you, too.”
Tony shrugged.  “Ross said something about Wanda.  Steve didn’t like it.”
“When’d you get home?”
“Yes,” Tony answered immediately.  “I do.  I’m sorry.”  He folded his hands in front of his coffee cup, giving the appearance of a good boy.  “Please tell me what untoward things you are planning.”
They got to the party at six-fifteen, and Tony immediately looked for Steve. He didn’t see him yet, but it was okay. It was still early. He
Realization dawned, and Steve’s face scrunched into a guilty little smile that Tony found utterly adorable. But, of course, he didn’t say that. “Oh,” Steve said. “Huh.”
So he pretended nothing was.
Silk wrapped around his hand. Tight but not too tight. Just right. Just enough to let him know it was still there. “Thank you."
She laid her hand against his cheek and turned his head.  Hope and doubt warred with each other; the battle played out on his face.  “Gone?”
“Hey,” Tony protested, making grabby-hands at the bottle.  “That’s mine.”
“I don’t want you to hate me.”
had been thinking about him.
Steve shuddered and turned abruptly to go back into his own apartment, thinking of that. Thinking of that flawed logic. Thinking that Brock was one-syllable, and Obadiah was four. Hmm. Funny. Funny how those names both proved and disproved Tony’s theory. At least Brock was on the right side of things. Even if he
“Feelin’ better?” Softly. Breath tickling his ear. That
“In the lab,” she answered with a tiny note of humor in her voice.  “As usual, Captain.”
It had always made him smile when he was growing up because it meant he was almost home. He smiled again now, because it still meant that. Tony was right behind the door. He was almost home.
"Maybe we shouldn’t do anything," Tony said, and his fingers eased enough to run his hand through Steve’s hair again gently. Steve shuddered out a breath. "We could just go to sleep. Or snuggle for a while instead."
“How about I take you out to dinner?  Sort of a truce?”
Tony sighed. He’d expected it. He’d known. But it still hurt. He’d thought...maybe. But he’d been wrong before.
He padded down the hall, thoughts of coffee and plans for a new suit for Peter dancing in his head.  Fuck sugarplums.  What the hell was a sugarplum, anyway?
Tony opened the car door. “Get in.”
“Babe.”
Tony laughed.  “I have no fucking clue.”
Steve touched it.
, Tony thought.
was the fucking question.
He had called Natasha last night while Steve was in the shower. He didn’t usually shower that early. Usually, he showered around midnight, or, when he was expected at the bakery, he showered at five am. He never took an eight pm shower. It was almost unheard of.
“It’s okay,” Jack said, but Steve didn’t hear him. He retreated down the hall, back toward the elevator, jabbing his finger at the button, almost falling inside. He backed into the corner and pressed his hands against his face, trying desperately to get himself back under control.
Steve lay beside her for a few more minutes, then slowly made his way out from under her and got to his feet. He adjusted the blankets, kissed her one last time, then left, closing the door part-way behind him.
“Where’s Strange?”
“What about Clint?  How did you know?”
Howard clasped his shoulder. “I think you’ll change your mind, Steven,” he said. “I do.” And then he left.
Steve didn’t know what he’d do if that happened.
“I didn’t mean to.”
He led him by their still-clasped hands toward the bedroom. Steve followed, squeezing his hand tightly in anticipation. Tony squeezed back.
“I fucking knew it!”
. They had both known it the second they saw it.
Tony groaned and put his head against Steve’s chest again.  “Please tell me he’s not going to be slaughtering a fatted calf in our living room.”
Tony laughed again softly. Gently. “Yes. Yes, we are.” He kissed Steve’s lips again, then brushed the fingers of one hand over his eyelids, closing them. “Stay here.”
Tony pulled  him to his chest and held him.  Steve hid his face in the crook of his neck and clung to Tony’s waist.  Tony remembered Rhodey once telling him he couldn’t be Steve’s life preserver.
Tony chuckled softly. Christ, how did he ever live without this? “No diplomacy needed, baby. Or wanted. Spoiling you is my main joy in life, okay?”
somersault again. Tony nodded back, the corner of his own mouth quirking upward. Steve ducked his head. That grin resurfaced, just a flash, there and gone, and Tony could have sworn a blush had painted those perfect high cheekbones a pale, pretty pink. Of course, that could have been the setting sun. Probably. Just the sun. A trick of the fading light. There’s no reason why Steve should blush just because Tony smiled at him. Just because he’d given him a wicked little grin across the length of the deck while all their friends stood around them. Just because he’d arched his eyebrow just enough to mean...something. Whatever. Whatever Steve wanted to think it meant. Even if it meant nothing at all, maybe Steve would go to bed tonight thinking about it. Thinking about
“She won’t get mad,” Steve assured him. “She’s at work right now, anyway. She’s doing a graveyard. She won’t be home until tomorrow, and then I’ll talk to her. It’ll be okay. Don’t worry about that.”
.  It was his heart.  The serum hadn’t changed that.  It had enhanced his body, but not his spirit.  That was all him.
Tony read it over three times.  Then he crumpled it into a ball and threw it in the trash can.
Fuck you, Steve Rogers.
The lights were off in the living room, but the television was still on, casting the room in a bluish glow. Most of the seats were empty, but Bruce was asleep in the recliner, resting comfortably with his feet up, and there was a large, indistinct shape on the couch. It wasn’t moving, but there was the sound of small, breathy snores coming from it, so Tony assumed it was friendly.
to talk to. Someone he’d missed talking to. It upset him that it had taken a bottle of whiskey to bring him out, but he was
“Little House on the Prairie.  I know.”  He shrugged.  “I’m starting to get the appeal.”
Thank you for reading!!
“You escalated it.”
There was nothing for awhile, and Tony had begun to drift off when Steve’s voice said, “‘Night, Tony.”
“Tony, he--”
what’s going on?” Tony asked.
, you know--I should have walked away. But I didn’t. I didn’t want to. I was too focused on what
“Good.”
Tony stood up and took Steve’s hand. He wasn’t going to let this chance go by. A chance for them to be together. Alone. Without sitting in bucket seats with a gear-shift between them. Especially since it was Steve who had suggested it. Tony would give him anything he wanted.
“Make it quick, soldier.”
“What?” Steve asked.
Steve started a little, jerked out of his reverie, and looked to his left. A guy was sitting beside him. A guy with dark hair and hazel eyes. A little smile on his lips. Steve had never seen him before. He was just some guy.
“What-?”
He nodded.  “She was at the hearing.”
“‘Cause you’re sweet. My big,
“Lethal.  I know.”
else.”
Thanks again! Love you guys!
Steve tucked the blankets away in the armoire in the corner and snapped off the lamp.  Outside the windows, New York stretched like a dream below him.  He did look out this time, and even though it wasn’t as bright as before, it was still beautiful.  The people down there, those thousands of dots of light, knew nothing of the battle that was coming.  Their lives went on the same as they had since the snap, and they would know nothing different until tomorrow.  Steve didn’t know whether he envied or pitied them that.
“Bullshit. He knew what he was saying.”
The door to the garage opened.  The sheriff stood there framed in the sun, a dark cut-out against the bright winter morning.  “Steven Rogers?”
He slipped his arm around her waist, squeezed, then left them alone.
Steve rolled his eyes, and Tony laughed under his breath. “You better go, baby.”
For a moment, it was everything Tony had hoped it would be.  Steve’s eyes filled with a great, heaving relief, his body relaxed under Tony’s hand.  His mouth curved into a smile and his hand began to rise, meaning to touch Tony, meaning to pull him into his arms.
“Yeah, I promise. Just...ask me soon, okay?” he said, then sunk his teeth into Steve’s plush bottom lip. “And quit stealing my line, you bastard.”
Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. He ran his hands through his hair again, then opened the door.
They took the stairs again. Steve in the lead, Tony right behind him. It was familiar. So familiar. The close space, the scratches on the bannister. Some kid had drawn a smiley-face on the wall in Magic Marker, and that was new, but everything else was the same. Even Mrs. Perkins's door. The little doormat she had in front of it with the words WELCOME FRIENDS written in old-timey script was still there. Tony smiled at that. Still there. They’d still have to be quiet. Put on The Eagles. Muffle their voices as best they could. It was almost like they’d discovered some way of traveling back in time. Just erasing the last three years of their lives so they could wind up back here, climbing these stairs one more time.
believe
Steve put a hand on his arm. “You okay?”
He thought the word "maybe". But there was really no "maybe" about it. Fuck "maybe".
“Alright, guys. Who wants it?”
She rolled her eyes. Affectionately. “Stop being a baby. He’s tired and pissed, but he’s not unreasonable. He’ll get over it. And so will you.” She tugged his sleeve again. “Come on. Let’s go.”
Howard eyed him speculatively, watching him with a predator’s eye. “Do you know what my objection to you is, Steven?”
He stood in the shower and scrubbed it away, knowing it probably wasn’t actually there, at all, knowing it was probably psychosomatic, but also knowing that the longer he stood under the showerhead, the less he smelled it.
“It’s always true.”
“Josh thought so,” Tony nodded. “He got so scared he left.”
But Howard didn’t know any of those things. If Tony had his way, he never would know. It would be too embarrassing a thing to admit. It would make him too vulnerable in Howard’s eyes. And that was something he could never bring himself to be.
He yanked it out, not giving a shit about the arched eyebrows of the men and women around him.
promises,” he insisted. “Make me promises.”
“Hey,” she said, trying to smile.  “Steve?”
His eyes changed. Tony saw it happen. Saw the way they became more introspective. Almost guilty. When he came out of the water just enough to be able to speak without drowning, Tony heard the guilt in his voice too. “I was coming on too strong,” Steve said, barely above a whisper. “I can see that.
hearing?  How did I not know about this?  I mean, fuck what I said about not wanting to know about Steve Rogers, but
. So very badly. He could see that same want in Tony’s eyes, and he knew--
“-that.”
"Hmm?  Are you close?"
“Nobody
Steve blinked.  His fine mouth turned down.  “I--” he began, then stopped.  He ran a hand through his hair then gestured weakly at his chair.  “I’m not going to be climbing those stairs,” he said, “but if you want me to sleep out here, I could probably--”
“Ross must have been pissed.”
Tony wriggled closer and tossed his arm across Steve’s waist.  “Put your arm around me or something,” he complained.  “Let’s pretend that we like each other.”
Hence, the reason they were there.
Steve worked as long as he could, but finally swept all the intel off the desk and back into the drawers.  There was no point in trying to do more.  If he tried, he could make a mistake, and one little mistake on his part could cost someone else their life.
eyes were there, that familiar, deep, whiskey brown, and Steve kissed Tony's bicep, his shoulder.  He touched the arc reactor with gentle, reverent fingers while his lips found Tony's neck, his chin, his cheek, his forehead, and at last, his lips.  He pressed his mouth to Tony's, and Tony's shaking hand rose to cup the back of his head and fist lightly in his hair for a second before falling back to the coverlet.
Hair soft and silky beneath his fingertips.
“Alright. Two.”
“Oh my god,” Tony whimpered.  He reached for Steve, meaning to shake him, tear them apart, to end this thing now, but Strange said, “
Tony pressed closer, and Steve wondered just where the hell this had come from. What the hell was going on. He didn’t date. He’d
“Hi,” Tony said.
do that to me,” he said. His voice was softer, though, his eyes not as cold. “Maybe not physically, but there was always someone else you were thinking about.” He turned fully into Steve and slipped his hand up his arm to cup his cheek. “You never let me in. Not all the way. You never let your guard down enough to love me.”
He did stay awake for a while. Tony told him about the museum. About the Mayans, and the mummies, and the dinosaurs. He told him about going to the movies. He told him how he made Sam laugh so hard Coke came out of his nose and Sam swore at him for five minutes after, wiping his red, streaming eyes with a napkin. Tony tried to mop up his gross mess of soda and now-soggy french fries, but it was almost too hard doing that while trying not to die from laughter himself.
Tony sputtered some more.
Sarah laughed. “
After at least a month of driving, Tony finally pulled up in front of Steve’s apartment. Tony turned off the ignition, and they both just sat in their seats, not moving, not looking at each other. An undercurrent of something hot and electric hung in the air between them, and when Steve put his hand over Tony’s, he jumped.
“Daddy!” she squealed, squirming around in his grip. Dodger stood back up, dancing around them, barking happily.
“Looks like he is.”
“I told Nat to come up in July,” Tony said.  “Is that too long?  We can have them up before.”
he thought.  “Not flattery.  Just the god’s honest.”
“What if it hadn’t?”
“I don’t want to take them.”
“Steve.”
“I told you I’m not driving.”
Beside him, Wanda was as full of nervous energy as he was.  Her fingers drummed lightly against her thigh, her eyes darted from place to place, never lighting on anyone or anything for longer than a second before leaping nimbly away again.
Pause.
“I guess I make a good pillow,” Steve said, brushing her hair out of her eyes.
“I know.” He released him, but looked him seriously in the eye. “But when you are--and I really hope someday soon you are--I’m going to give you Pietro’s number. He really is a nice guy.”
Steve.
He took his phone out of his pocket and pressed six, watching Strange’s retreating back.  “Nat.  We’re on...Not so good...Tonight.  Does she need the jet?...Awesome.”  He hung up, and Stephen Strange was nowhere in sight.
And fuck the rest of them, too.
“Uh-huh.”
A storm of emotion passed through him. Memories swirling like driving snow. As many times as they’d been in his car together, Tony had only asked him that one other time. Steve nodded. “Yeah,” he said quietly. “I do.”
“Thank you for that,” Steve said to her.
.” He pulled on Tony’s hand. “Now.”
“No.  Hell no.  Fuck that.”
“I don’t know either.”
Wing-man Sam to the rescue.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “It will just be for today, but...yeah. If that’s okay?”
“Yeah,” he continued.  “I don’t want to either.”
“I really appreciate everything you’ve done for my friends,” Tony said with as much stolid grace as he could muster.
He reached down and pet the cat as he passed.  Sir Purr yawned and stretched.  Tony was utterly charmed.  He always was, by everything the cat did.  “Have you seen daddy?” he asked.  “Did he come through here?”
Tony’s phone dinged in his hand.  Steve.  Texting him.
“Nice to meet you,” Josh said, quiet hostility coloring his voice.
“It’s okay, Steve,” he said.  “No harm done.”
The door thumped closed again and Steve glared at Tony.  “FRIDAY, please unlock the training room.”
So, as much as I'd love to write some good, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred smut, it's just not my wheel-house. There's more smoke and mirrors here (or maybe I'm just a tease!) but in either case, just use your imagination for the stuff that's not on the page. I'm sure it'll be awesome!
hurt him.”
He only looked up when the room opened around them. The first thing he saw was Steve. He was standing at the desk, a pen in his hand. He was filling out a form, his brow furrowed in concentration. His wallet sat by his hand, open to his driver’s license. His credit cards sat snugly in their little slots, but his debit card was out, sitting on the counter. He was still wearing his uniform shirt from the restaurant. It was nothing more than a black t-shirt with the name and logo printed on the back and it might have blended in with the regular Saturday night crowd except for the food stains on it.
“Nothing reported.”
Steve looked at each of them in turn, beginning and ending with Tony.  “Why do we need private?” he asked, and Tony slid closer, as close as he could get.  His thumb caressed Steve’s with one hand, the other cupped the back of Steve’s neck.
animal.  Aren’t you?”
He helped Morgan get ready next, helping her get into her dress and Mary Janes. Braiding her hair and putting a couple of bows in it for good measure.
“You gonna call me tomorrow?”
, that could get to be a problem. The sound of it was already becoming something Steve could start to crave.
“Just a sec.  I’ll call the jet.”
“You’re my
“I’m sure she’ll love them,” Tony said, and Steve was pretty sure he was just placating him, but at the moment, he didn’t care. All he cared about was getting through this phone call. Then the rest of the week. Then Saturday and this ridiculous idea of going to the aquarium. Tony could choose where to go next time. If there
. It had been a long time since he’d felt that way. Even with Pietro, he’d never felt quite so good.
Tony moved so she could come to him.  She sat on the bed beside him and Steve grasped her shoulders, searching her face.  His hand rose and brushed along her cheek, over her hair.  “You’re so beautiful,” he said, and she laughed through her tears.
Steve looked over his shoulder, saw the last stragglers climbing on the bus. “I gotta go.”
“Healthy, though?” he asked.  “Mental-healthy?”
“I guess you’re wearing me down.”
“Don’t count him out yet, Stephen,” Pepper said.  “I’ve seen him win with only his king, a rook, and two pawns left on the board.”  She looked up at Tony, the firelight catching in her eyes, making them shine.  “Remember that, Tony?”
Steve’s pride was so important to him, both as a hero and as a man, and Tony had no desire to tread on it if he could help it.  But watching him navigate the unfamiliar terrain of this new challenge had him walking on eggshells again.
Steve sighed, and when he did, his face softened, that frown that had strained his features all night long, finally eased. When it did, he looked young again at last. Tony couldn’t help but grin at that, and Steve smiled back, rolling his eyes a little. “When are you ever just gonna give up on me, huh?”
“We both know there isn’t going to be a later.”
you to put that on me. Okay? I’m here. That’s part of what being together is.” He gestured between them. “That’s part of what
“Yeah. I think if it wasn’t for Mom, I probably would have gone crazy.”
And for the first time in months, he was starting to worry. He was starting to have those ‘What-if’ thoughts again.
“Tony-Tony, your dad’s here.”
Tony lay against him again, resumed the light scratches over his body. “This is all kind of new. For me too. It’s going to take us a minute to figure out how to handle all these situations.”
“It was good. How are you? What did you do tonight?"
Tony passed a speed limit sign, and it was as if a switch had been flipped.  The rain turned to a downpour.  It sheeted down around him, turning the car into a hollow steel drum.  The Bentley sluiced left, over the broken line, and into the other lane.  Tony tapped the brakes, letting the car lose some of its speed, and guided it back into place.  Thunder crashed again like huge cymbals, and lightning speared down from the heavens.  Tony let his speed drop more in the torrent, gritting his teeth.
“Why?  Dinner or the opposable thumbs?”
“Yeah.”
“Fine,” Steve relented, and the frown disappeared, tucked away for next time. “Next time, okay?”
But Steve pulled back at the last second, turned his head just enough to keep Tony’s lips from his.
“No?” Howard asked. “You want to go to MIT in the fall? You want to have any kind of future at all?”
He brushed one finger along the thin skin under Steve’s eye. It had looked a little bruised when Steve looked in the mirror this morning. He had convinced himself it wasn’t noticeable. No one at work mentioned it, although Sarah had asked if he felt alright when he popped up to tell her good-bye before leaving for the evening.
Ross pulled his top-coat on and left.  Tony sagged against the workbench, his head in his hands.  One day?  Was that really too much to ask?  One fucking day of happiness?
They drove home in silence as bitter as the dregs of Tony’s coffee.  When they pulled up, Tony turned the car off, got Steve’s chair out of the trunk, and wheeled it to the passenger side.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.”  Steve’s eyes were soft, but his voice was as hard as stone, immovable.  “No, I want to stay here.  The sun feels nice.  And the breeze.  And it’s home, you know?  We used to come here and feed the ducks, remember?”
Bruce leaned forward, hands between his knees.  “It was like somebody flipped a switch in his head,” he said.  “One minute he was lucid, talking normal, the next, he was out like a light.  Gone.  His eyes were still open, but Steve--our Steve,
“Yes,” Ross said smoothly.  “Once again, he proves his loyalty is astounding.”
“She’s right.”
“Yeah. In the rain. We’ll splash puddles, and get coffee, and-”
No one cheered when the flat tire happened though.
“I’m glad somebody’s telling you.”
“God,” Steve whispered and bent to capture Tony’s lips again. “Really?” he asked into Tony’s mouth. “You want me to?”
"Do it," Steve said.  "Find him, and contact me when you've got him.  We'll go from there."
Tony ran a hand through his hair. “No. Won’t work, Pep. I’ve got to be home by seven. Tell him to get a hotel room, have some dinner, take in the Tulsa nightlife, and come in the morning.”
Those times didn’t come around often, though.  It was mostly okay between them, if a little
“‘Kay,” Steve agreed just as the door opened.
you okay?” Tony asked with a tiny frown. “I didn’t break you, did I?”
Steve brushed a lock of hair from her forehead.  “He’s not the only one.”
“Steven,” she said, and he closed his mouth with a snap. Funny to think that she could still do that to him even after all this time. “I’m serious. I’ll be asleep most of the day anyway, and when I do wake up, I’ll be on pain meds. I won’t even know you’re here.”
Tony couldn’t take it anymore. “What the fuck are you doing?” he asked, and even though he wanted it to come out a furious shout, in actuality, it just sounded bewildered.
Steve saw Tony at meetings in the conference room that had become their base of operations, but never outside of there.  Tony still wouldn’t speak to him, and that was fine.  If Steve had a question only Tony could answer, he directed it to the room in general and Tony answered the same way.  It was a way to work together without actually having to
“Pulsing,” Tony agreed.  “Flashing off and on, he said.  Does that mean anything to you?”
“Hi, Steve.”
He sighed. Maybe he didn’t want to go home, after all.
“I hope so.”
"-eighteen years, or something.  You've heard me sneeze, Tony."
“What if he hadn’t drunk anything?” Steve asked.
He kicked his shoes off and got into the bed, climbing over Steve to get where he wanted, and pressed against him.  He threw his arm over Steve’s stomach, his leg over Steve’s leg, and nestled his head onto Steve’s shoulder.  Steve’s arms came around him, and they lay quietly together on the big bed, both crowded onto the left side, leaving Tony’s untouched.
“So, what is it? What’s the ‘but’?”
Tony turned his attention back to Josh. He pulled him closer, slid his hand into the back pocket of his jeans, and kissed him hungrily. Josh kissed him back. “What were you saying about sucking me off, earlier?” Tony whispered in his ear. Josh smiled at him, and slapped at his chest a little, calling him a “bad boy”, then went back to sucking tiny bruises all along Tony’s neck, littering his skin with them like badges of honor.
“Knock it off, Tony.”
“Chinese, I guess.”
“He won’t want me there.”
“Japan.  I’m leaving in a couple of hours.”
“Um,” Steve said again. He hated the way he sounded. Like he was some damn kid himself. He wasn’t. He was twenty-five. And while he didn’t care much about what he saw in the mirror, he knew he wasn’t
When Morgan was asleep, Steve went back to the kitchen and took a quick glance through the fridge and cabinets to make sure there was everything for pancakes. Tony didn’t have buttermilk, but it was okay. He had whole milk and there was a bowl of lemons on the counter. He could improvise. When he was satisfied, he clipped on Dodger’s leash and took him out for his morning walk.
Tony thought it over carefully, stripping the label bit by bit from his bottle.  Sam watched him think, waiting patiently for an answer.  And he expected one, that was clear.  This wasn’t rhetorical.  Sam wasn’t a rhetorical kind of guy, either, and that was
“I missed you, too. And I really am sorry. I wanted to get here a lot earlier.”
“Yes. You are.”
Tony ran his hands over Steve’s bare skin. His back, his shoulders, his stomach, groping him like he’d done when they were teenagers making out in his car in some half-empty parking lot. Steve fumbled with the buttons of Tony’s shirt. It was Egyptian brushed cotton. Classic white. French cuffs. Six hundred dollars. He wanted Steve to ruin it. To rip it off his body, tear it to shreds, just get it
“I swear to Christ, Steve, if the next words out of your mouth aren’t ‘Anything you want, Tony’, somebody in this room
“I told
“A little young for you, isn’t she?”
He doodled occasionally on a bit of napkin or the edge of a letter he would send to his mother, but years since he’d set up his oil paints, stuck his brushes in a cup, and really, actually worked on something real. Years since he’d done it. Years since he’d
He wanted to go to Tony’s house. Just go there, knock on the door, then go in, but was that too much? Was that too forward? Too selfish? Maybe Tony had just gotten busy. Maybe he’d decided he had something else to do. Something important Something better.
regrets, Steve.”  He ran his fingers over the sandy beard covering Steve’s cheek.  “Except this.  You should regret this.”
“He’s okay, Steve, everyone’s okay.”
“This is no time for jokes,” the woman snapped.  “Who do you think you are?  Let’s get out of here.”  She and her friend stood up and stomped out, leaving their food uneaten, their check unpaid.  “You’re sick,” she sniffed as they passed Tony and Natasha’s table.
“It won’t get weird.”
Tony shook his head.  There was that duality again.  He thought about pressing the issue--
Tony glanced at Nat and Bruce.  He had gone to her side, and she held his hand, their fingers twined together.  Steve had liked to do that, too.

a hundred times on every page.
Tony shook his head, pulled him closer again. “You don’t have to remember the words. Just what you meant. You remember that, right?”
“That doesn’t mean
Steve shrugged, but he was smiling. “It’s nothing. Just stew. My mom used to make it when it started to get colder. Sometimes when I’d come home from school she’d be in the kitchen, and have me come in and help her cut vegetables and stuff. We’d sit at the counter while it cooked and she’d read and I’d do my homework, and then when Dad got home, he’d get bowls out of the cupboard and we’d sit there at the kitchen counter and eat together.” He shrugged again, and the look on his face made Tony feel like crying. He had never seen Steve look even marginally happy when he spoke about his parents. Now, his eyes were far away and soft, and thanks to some strange alchemy, Tony’s nerves and fear about their future--
And Steve couldn’t help the way his eyes found Tony where he sat out in the congregation with a pretty redhead by his side, holding his hand. He couldn’t help the way his heart burned inside his chest, leaving it nothing but a tiny cinder when Tony looked back. He couldn’t help the way that tiny cinder still sped up, still doing what it was created for, still pounding within the cage of his ribs, beating out Tony’s name like it had done for years and years. And he didn’t even try to stop it. There was no point.
“What do you do when you have them?”
.  The trust and closeness that he and Tony had to have between them when they were in battle, had brought them closer than they would have ever been if they had just met on a street corner and struck up a conversation.  Didn't it? Would they still be the same now if they hadn't put themselves so completely in the other's hands in those life and death situations so often?
Steve glanced down at himself. He had grown up too since they’d last seen each other. Of course, he had. Six years was a long time. He’d put on height and some muscle, but for some reason, he didn’t
“You would?”
“Dr. Banner is requesting entrance.”
Steve nodded without lifting his head.
heal him.  He kept his eyes on Tony, but for the moment, he gave everything else over to Natasha.
There was a phone booth on the corner.
“See now, was that so hard?”
Steve let out a harsh breath as he pulled himself further onto the bed.  His biceps bulged impressively.  Tony gave up all pretense of not looking and turned his head, watching his progress intently.  Steve lifted his right leg onto the bed, only using his hands a little, then hauled his left into place, settling it beside its mate.  He rested his head against the headboard, eyes closed, fists loosely clenched, breathing in and out.
“You come see me, okay?” she said into his ear. “You’re always welcome, sweetheart. Always wanted. Okay?”
Steve blinked, then the frown intensified.  Tony wanted to kiss those lines between his brows, tease them away with his lips and tongue, but he resisted.  For the moment, he resisted.
Just some stuff...
“I have to stop in to work,” she said.  “Just for a sec.  Then we can go back to your place.”
He looked up, staring frankly into Tony’s eyes.  Tony shook his head.  “I don’t have a fucking clue, man.”
“Thank you,” he said, and touched the door handle. For one moment, he was afraid it wouldn’t turn. But it did.
“Do you have everything?” she asked, and Steve nodded, bending to lift Morgan up into his arms. She clutched his neck just as tightly as Sarah was holding Tony.
She touched his cheek. “Okay, honey. If you need anything, call me.”
.” He picked up the loaf of bread, untwisted the tie keeping it closed, then twisting it back up again. “But we haven’t talked about
Tony put his hand over Steve’s.  “Never.”
“I see a man with absolutely nothing to lose.  A man with no ties.  No boundaries.  No laws.  A man who believes in nothing, because everything he believed in is gone.”  Ross cocked his head, his eyes boring into Tony’s.  “If you don’t think a man like that is dangerous, Stark, then I’m even more afraid of you than I thought.”
Across the roof, Steve ducked his head again. His hands were stuck in his pockets. That blush still warmed his cheeks.
“I dropped him at Clint’s,” Nat answered, and smacked his arm again. “You’re just lucky he was home or you would have been driving home alone with Mr. Grumpy-pants here,” she said, and then reached up through the seat and kissed Steve’s cheek. “Isn’t that right, Grumpy?”
“Yeah.”
Tony sighed.  “Don’t you?”
“Okay.”
Steve just laughed quietly. His breath on Tony’s skin was feathery and sweet. Perfect.
Tony breathed it in. Soaked in as much of it as he could. For the first time since yesterday at the watch shop, he actually

“Don’t what?”
“Are you staying tonight?” he asked, turning off the TV after Kevin had saved the day.
to be home soon, right?--but for some reason, it didn’t feel like he’d ever be home. He’d been gone for three weeks, but it felt more like three years.
“What about that GP in town?  Whatsisname?  Jackson?”
It had been a long day. The six hours of overtime had turned into twelve when another cashier called in sick, and his boss came and asked him if he wanted another shift. Another shift meant another six hours overtime. It was a lot of money for him, a lot of
“How bad?” Natasha asked.
“Sorry,” Steve said, but he didn’t take his hand away.
to be in prison,” Ross said silkily.  “One little thing.  Two words.  And you’re gone.  The hero is gone.  And what’s left?  An experiment gone wrong.  A monster.”
“I took it a couple years ago,” Tony said. “If you ever want to talk about it.”
“You’re doing it again.”
“Tony,” Steve said, sounding desperate, and Tony shook his head with an irritated sigh.
Clint and Laura had come up a day early, and Clint spent the day with Tony stringing fairy lights on the deck and the back of the house.  Clint climbed up in the trees to do those too, he and Tony tossing the balls of lights from one to the next as Clint moved with dexterous ease among the branches.  Tony was glad he was there.  He was too old for that kind of thing.  Clint knew it too, but to his credit, never said it aloud.
He stopped at the guard station and gathered his things.  He refastened his watch and slipped his wallet into his pocket.  The keys to the car, he twirled around his finger.  He whistled a little as he crossed the parking lot.  In spite of the tussle, his heart was very light.  He was going to get Steve out of there.  It was now a foregone conclusion in his mind.  He and Steve were going to be together.  Forever.  And after that, too.
Slowly, reverently, Tony ran his hand over Steve’s chest.  The smooth skin, the hard muscle beneath.  There were no scars, no cuts or scrapes, no marks at all, just pure alabaster perfection, like marble warmed in the Italian sun.
Tony watched him go through his messages feeling a happy tug at his heart.  He was grateful, so fucking grateful to the others for sending messages, for calling--”Peter called twice, Tony, we’d better get in touch tomorrow.”--for letting Steve know they still needed him.  That was huge right now.  As much as Tony wanted Steve to himself, wanted to sequester him away from the world at large, this outpouring of love from their friends meant just as much to Steve as anything Tony could do for him.  And the very fact that he could think that with no jealousy made him all the happier.
“Well. I gotta say, I’m curious.”
Tony dropped their hands, and now Nat did crawl onto his lap.  Bruce put his arms around her and she kissed him before settling against his chest.  “I am sorry,” she said quietly.
"Nothing's wrong," he said lightly. "Just taking my time."
“They put me on suicide-watch when I came in,” Steve said.
“Later.  Where is he?”
She laughed under her breath.  “You are such a smartass.”
Tony slid down the wall until he sat pressed against it.  He drew his knees up and clasped his arms around them.  He tipped his head back and closed his eyes.
Steve shook his head.  “No.  I think they left all the hurt here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He opened the door, and the sight that greeted him took his breath away.
“Oh my god,” Tony said again.
“What is it, FRIDAY?” he relented.
“Miss Maximoff?” Strange said.
He was going to be sleeping in the bed.
--distilling down to only the feeling of Tony. Just Tony. Him and nothing else. He breathed, and when he came, his breath stopped. And it wasn’t like an explosion. It was like a revelation.
“I said, I won’t.”  Fury.
Steve just looked at him. That wary/amused look was still in his eyes, a smile that was only truly half smile and half worried frown. "I don't need anything, Tony."
said, it almost always caught them by surprise. In fact, it had become a little running competition among their unit--who could make Steve laugh the most. Bucky was currently in the lead, but Timothy “Dum Dum” Dugan was gunning for the top spot. He thought he could take it by February.
He smiled at her, and he felt some of the pain ebbing away again. He still had
“Well, yeah.  He’s my doctor.”
Steve let out a breath, and Tony tensed, waiting. “I don’t know,” Steve said. “I don’t know if I
“Jesus Christ, get a room!”
“It’s good to have you back,” he said, and it came out steady.
Tony blinked, rubbed his eyes.  “Ross?”  he said.  “Are you here to tell me about our savior, Jesus Christ?  Because if you are, can you come back in about four hours?”
“‘Kay.”
“All of them.”
Tony fell silent, and they stared at each other in the semi-gloom of the mental hospital.  Steve was breathing in slow, steadying inhales, smooth, flat exhales.  His eyes were still questioning, brow still creased.
“You. Are. Not. Crazy,” Tony said firmly. “Do I think you should talk to somebody? Yeah. I do. Are we going to talk about making you an appointment first thing Monday morning? Hell yes. But there is no way I’m going to let you go just because of
Steve frowned at him for a moment longer, then his brow smoothed out. “Okay."
“Yes, it was,” Steve answered, and now he did pour some whiskey into his glass. He downed it easily, and wiped moisture from his bottom lip. “I wasn’t paying attention. They were my responsibility, and I let them down.” He gulped another drink. “I got that kid killed.”
to do it, too. Why should he be here? Steve hadn’t asked him to come. In fact, he’d made it pretty fucking clear that he didn’t want anything to do with Tony at the reception, so just why was he torturing himself with this? Why couldn’t he just let it drop? Why couldn’t he just walk away?
“Tony-”
“Tony-” Steve began, but Tony cut him off with a long, hard kiss.
“I don’t think so either,” she said. “You’re crazy about him, and he worships you. It’s obvious. It was obvious before, but I had to reserve judgement. You know I did.”
Steve breathed low laughter, dark like smoked glass.  “You won’t distract me.  Stay.”
“Always.”
“You don’t need to drive me the whole way,” Steve said. “You can just drop me off at the nearest bus station.”
“I guess that would probably be okay,” Steve said. His hand stole out and landed on Tony’s hip. The feel of that, so familiar, so simple, so loved, sent a powerful wave of nostalgia through him, overtaking everything in its path. It even won over his brain, and for a second, one sweet second, the whole of him, every single part, was on-board with this. Completely and totally on-board.
“...Us?”
Steve leaned into Tony’s hand, resting his head in his palm. “I don’t know,” he said, and closed his eyes. “I’m tired.”
he thought distractedly.
“No.”
Okay, here we go for real.  This one is a little short.  Short and pretty sweet. I am going to try and post every 2-3 days. The timeline may feel a little vague.  That's (mostly) intentional. I kind of wanted it to feel like time is ephemeral.  Because it is.
He didn’t put his seat-belt on.
“But…?”
Twenty-one Part Two.
She looked at them all, taking in Wanda’s passive stance, Steve’s solid form, and Tony himself, all wild-eyed and frantic.
“Ever since Christmas, you’re like a completely different person.”
“Oh, Rhodey, do we need to have that talk about boundaries again?”
“She calls me ‘the voice’.”
“I think that’s part of it, yeah.”
“My parents are dead.  I was an only child.  Jarvis, my
“Does it matter?”
Ross drew in a breath.  He was a strong man.  A dignified man.  Tony remembered seeing him from time to time when he was a young man visiting Howard’s office.  Out of all Howard’s colleagues, Ross had seemed the most decent then.  In fact, Tony had, one night, had a dirty dream where he and Ross engaged in some somewhat kinky escapades.  When he woke up, he found he’d been more turned on than he’d thought.  His sheets and underwear were wet with come.
He smiled at that. He couldn’t help it. “Okay.”
“Sure.”
Tony gave her his most sincere Stark smile.  It had gotten him a long way during his lifetime.  Jarvis had been immune, but his mother had been a sucker for it.  As had all the pretty coeds, both male and female, he’d talked into bed his junior and senior years at school.  After that, he’d pretty much dropped the sincerity and just went full-on selfish.  The irony was, he got laid twice as much.  Of course, the money and the drugs may have had something to do with that.
Of course, he hadn’t thought of the way Tony looked
It was the mountains that stopped him. Just the mountains. Nothing he hadn’t seen before certainly, but the sun was high, glinting off the dusting of snow that covered the ground, turning it into flashing jewels, like diamonds on a bit of silk, or stars in a crushed-velvet sky, and then the mountains, so high and hazy, rising in the distance with the smoke from his own cigarette wrapping them like gauzy spiderwebs. For a moment, it was all he could see. He stopped walking, his smoke forgotten between his lips, just looking up at the mountains.
Okay, okay, I KNOW that Tony Stark would never say anything bad about Natasha.  But, he was really jealous, and jealousy makes us do stupid things sometimes.  And, like he said, he was talking more about Steve than Nat.  That being said, thank you so much for coming this far with me!  Part Two is on the way.  It is set Post-Infinity War, so be prepared for a ton of drama, angst, fighting, and (finally!) kisses.  You are all beautiful!  Thank you!
“That’s from Steve,” he said.
“People like me over there, Tony,” Steve said at last. “They respect me. Here, I’m just another poor, stupid kid, but over there, I’m Corporal Rogers. That’s not really a big deal, but I’m in line for a promotion. To Sergeant. And that
,” Tony gasped, and threw himself back into Steve’s arms. He pressed kisses against his neck, his mouth, his bare shoulder. “God,
She looked at him with eyes that shone with guilt.  “You know why.”
They held each other tightly, Steve in his sleep, Tony on the verges of it, and that sense of rightness was so intense, so heightened, that Tony could not hold it in anymore.
Steve slid to the edge of the seat and gazed up at Tony’s face. He shook his head slowly, seriously from side to side. “I don’t think the city buses go to New Hampshire, Tony.”
He turned around. He still had his jacket on. His keys were still in his hand. If they hadn’t been, he probably would have just went to his bedroom, but no. There they were, hanging from his fingers, glinting in the light from the lamp, signalling to him a way out, a way to get away. He started for the door.
“Tony?  Are you okay?”  His voice was deeper inside their heightened bubble.  His blue eyes like flashing sapphires.  Blue.  God, so blue they hurt.
“That makes today my anniversary.
“Tony would make an
“You did?”
“Do you?”
He didn’t laugh. He didn’t smile. He barely spoke. That was the worst of it all. Because Tony always talked. Always. It was his
“Will you let me finish?”
, but he was definitely the only one to say it. At least to Tony himself.
“Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that,” Tony said, and Steve laughed in that soft way that always made Tony feel giddy, even after all this time. He moved his hands on Steve’s shoulders, rubbing them with tiny circles of his fingers. “Should we...do something? Go to dinner or something?” he asked doubtfully.
“Have you called his doctor?”
He gripped Tony painfully tight, but Tony didn’t move. Didn’t even try to get away, and when Steve spoke, it was with a dark urgency that made Tony’s heart beat dangerously fast. “I can be the man you need now, Tony. I know I can. If you let me try, I can-”

“Damn,” he whispered.  “Do you actually use this?”
Tony put a hand on his chest. “Stand down, Captain,” he said. “My guys have got it handled. Let them do their jobs. God knows I pay them enough for it.”
“I did no such thing.  He’s an animal, Stark.  I don’t understand why none of you see that.  You, most of all.  He tried to kill you, and now I find you two here all cozied up together, playing house.  What is wrong with you?  Your father would be disgusted.”

He’d always been a pretty solitary guy. Going out was harder than just staying in. Just keeping to himself. Just doing what he did. Just living his life. Going out seemed more difficult than working
He climbed up onto the bus, made his way down to a seat, and sat down. Outside his window, he could see his people--his family--waving at him. Saw his mother, his canine best friend, his little girl, and his man. He looked at them all, but he mostly had eyes for Tony. Just like he had almost his entire life. The person he had loved--and would love--more than anyone else. The person who was his past, his present, and his future.
