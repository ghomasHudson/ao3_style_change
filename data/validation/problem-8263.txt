Then Tony grabs some pad paper and a pen and quickly scribbles out “Happy April 1st ;)))”, taking care to mimic Barton’s handwriting and sticks it on the screen door to the backyard before they all settle down to the stairwell in order to wait.
“So…” Tony appears a bit awkward when Steve looks over at him. “You said something about Pepper having a request for me? Earlier? What was it?”
Tony grimaces. “I left after that, for your place, because I had always wondered what lay on this side of your borders, why my father was so consumed with finding you or your corpse. It was one last adventure.” Tony’s eyes are piercing as they meet Steve’s. “I stayed here, instead of leaving when you told me to, or moving onwards, because you are kind to me, and passable company. But most importantly, you won’t care when I die.”
“Marry me.” Tony mumbles, slumping down onto the floor against the cupboards next to the stove and hugging his cup of coffee. “You glorious bean, I’ll treat you so well, I’ll buy you all the best containers for you to sit in, the wedding will be glorious, we’ll get married in Paris at sunset.”
did or said, and we’ve been getting better at talking, but then it seemed bad enough for you to need time alone and then I was
With Natasha on one side and Agent Jin flanking them on the other, the group makes their way down to SHIELD medical to be poked and prodded at.
“Yup.” Sam responds. More heavy silence.
Tony gives her an unrepentant grin and opens his phone to look at the notification.
“-collapsed lung-”
“Don’t. I need to say this before I lose my nerve.”
I felt the need to make Hamilton Musical references so I did. I am also ignoring all the potential angst of comparing Tony's life to Aaron's because NO. Fluff and rainbows for this one.
“PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO IT, I
Bucky groans from where he is currently face-planted into the counter and Steve and Tony turn again to watch him. “You guys are so cheerful. It’s
“I dunno how well those would sell. Not sure the goatee would look that good on the Pringles man.” Tony gasps, offended.
"Hey." she says quietly, taking a seat beside him on the bench, shifting Morgan a bit so that she's still sleeping comfortably on her shoulder. Steve turns to look at her, manages to muster up a small smile. "Hi."
“Tony?” she had said, eyes haunted, and the fragile quality of her voice is heartbreaking. Tony the AI gives her a warm smile, clearly knowing who she is, but at the same time, the smile is missing something that should be there for your former wife. Love? Familiarity? Steve didn’t know, and he didn’t want to think about it either, so he had given Pepper a quick squeeze of her shoulder and left the room.
Agent Jin glares. “You’re not getting out of this. It's
Steve blinks, thrown off by the sharp response. “Um. I...wasn’t...accusing you of anything?”
me, better than anyone else I can think of, and I knew her and I doubt there even is a word for what we were. At the beginning I just kept wondering if I had traded one for the other, the fact that she sacrificed herself so that I could return to my family, if I was horrible for it, being happy when Laura, Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel returned-”
let those innocent blue eyes fool you-”
what Tony’s focusing on?
“You talk too much.” Clint groans from his faceplant on the table. “It’s too early for functional speech.”
With that, she had done a last check, stepped into the control booth, and after a quick flash, they were there. The moving around and not being visible or solid unless you concentrated portion of the Visit had been a bit weird to adjust to, but other than that, the trip remained pretty straightforward.
The room holds a sort of stunned silence as everyone except Steve absorbs this new information. It’s the primary and tertiary objectives that they’re all really stuck on, Steve knows. Peter looks like he’s about to cry.
Steve admits he was nervous about the entire process the first time they went through it. Say what you want, but crossing from the spiritual realm to the physical is nerve-wracking no matter how you slice it, especially since the first time Steve had crossed over he had been on his deathbed. That would give anyone the heebie-jeebies, no matter how much he might joke about it.
Steve whispers to Tony for hours after that, talks more than he has in months, speaks until his voice is hoarse. He recounts Tony’s own stories to him, covers him in blankets again when Tony grows too cold, and embraces him when the fever shoots back up, and he whispers every prayer he remembers, ones of safe passage and mourning, and rusty unused ones of life.
Tony? Does he seem like the type to just ‘forget’” Clint does air quotes around the word to emphasize it. Steve has to admit he has a point there.
Because again, Steve knows he shouldn’t be angry, the armour is not
There’s no verbal reply that Tony can hear, but he makes his way back downstairs anyways, warmth spreading through him in increments, like the way the sun might peak over the horizon, bright and shimmering and alive.
“Hanahaki disease they call it. It’s rare. And borne of unrequited love.”
“Great, I’ll be a one hit wonder because I’m never doing that again.”
"Oh fine." Tony laughs after a couple seconds of wide eyes and lip wobbling. "You're regular criminals, aren't you? Get back into your stupid closet, we'll ride this out until your mother comes to yell at me. If anyone asks, you're a pirate" Tony points at Elle, who giggles. "-and you're an accountant." Morgan nods solemnly.
Elle wrinkles her nose.
“No, no Steve, don’t worry, it’s nothing dangerous or bad. Yinsen...just...talk to him Steve. When you get the chance, talk to Tony.”
“Wait, what no, get back up here.” Tony complains, making grabby hands at Steve who rolls his eyes. He bats them away easily, laughing, and when that doesn’t work and Tony remains persistent, gets up entirely to plop himself down on Tony’s chair, just to be contrary because he knows Tony will give him that exasperated look Steve loves. Besides, he’s kinda stiff anyways, and he wants to sit up.
Steve does, heading back up to his room.
and now here he was watching his fiance walk down the aisle of a beautiful wedding chapel (why does the afterlife have a
Rhodey laughs, and soon the courtyard is filled with the sound of well wishes and goodbyes (tearful between Morgan and Elle) as the luggage is loaded onto the back and Pepper, Elle and Rhodey climb in to make their way back across the border. They've got a Summer Kingdom to run after all.
“Captain America.” he tries instead.
“Sure.” Bucky clears his throat after a moment. “Why don’t we talk about how Winter kicked all of y’all’s
It’s fun, now that he’s no longer feeling like crap.
“You’re sure though?” Steve continues, still not entirely convinced. “That it’s not...my fault. I didn’t say anything?”
“FUCK OFF STARK.” comes Natasha’s muffled response from what sounds like the back of their house.
“Plain old Steve Rogers from Brooklyn, we get it.” Bucky recites with an air of long suffering, and Steve finally peels back the wrapper on his yogurt, rolling his eyes.
It's a brutal winter season for the mortal realm. It’s so hard to care like this, but hopelessly, he still tries.
“Last I checked, you don’t live here.” is the first thing Steve says to Harley when he enters the kitchen. Harley chucks a takeout container at Steve’s head in response, and they all sit down in the living room to flip through episodes of Brooklyn Nine Nine as they eat.
He walks down the halls of the compound and is surprised to find that he’s actually the first person up, despite the fact that it’s now almost afternoon. Everyone else is probably still sleeping in, and Steve figures after the harrowing battle yesterday, it’s a much deserved rest, especially considering how late in the evening the debriefing had dragged to. It’s a testament to how little sleep Steve’s serum enhanced body needs, the fact that he’s the first up despite his late bedtime.
“Alright, whatever you say man.” She sinks onto the seat beside Tony and pulls out her phone, immediately tapping away at it.
The job would usually be perfect for the Black Widow, and none of them are saying it, but really they’re all thinking it. Bucky is assigned to it instead, and Steve hurts at the reminder of Natasha, can see it on everyone else’s face too. Even Fury looks a bit worse for wear as he dismisses them.
Tony, surprisingly, sits down next to Steve on the bed after a moment of contemplation - instead of his side of the room, which tends to be warmer - and settles in to speak.
“And this hurts just as much to be honest, because Natasha is probably the one person who knows me -
He smiles crookedly when Steve looks up and gives him a mildly skeptical look. Tony finds himself sticking his tongue out at him.
“Infinity stones level juice?” Tony asks, smirking.
So he locks himself in his workshop and starts inventing until his antisocial mood passes.
Next chapter is finally finished! Phew, that was a struggle and a half, though, I'm not very good at writing complex E M O T I O N S, so half the time I was curled around my laptop, just like how do humans function even? What is this?
“Alright wrap it up guys.” Pepper calls eventually after all the equipment had been packed away with much joking and laughing, and clothes changed. “Back to our place, we’ll have a picnic by the lake tonight and catch up.”
“The best.” She says back, and then “shut up, the Beauxbatons students are about to do their dance sequence.”
Tony’s the one who walks forward and offers Loki a hand up from where he arrived, sitting on their living room floor, funnily enough.
They make it to the restaurant in record time, because although Steve drives like the 90 year old man he is in cars, the rules apparently don't apply to two wheeled vehicles.
Steve pauses, thrown at the interruption. “Yeah she already-oh wait.” Steve suddenly feels like kicking himself because
Agent Jin stares at Tony with a vaguely constipated look on her face characteristic of those who decide to trifle with the mighty Tony Stark, and finally gives a soft huff of laughter.
After that they all sit down, after much coaxing from Pepper for Steve to take it easy, and they talk for another hour or so, Wanda and Scott leaning in the doorway, before a SHIELD nurse comes in to notify them that Steve can finally leave.
MILD TRIGGER WARNING BTW. I feel the need to warn for this because it's really really minor, like barely there, but there's a very slight reference to suicide, although not technically suicide?? Because AI? But I thought I'd warn for it just in case. Read with caution.
In other news, Bucky and Sam have predicted that they’ll return from their mission in another week or so, currently chasing a lead, and so Steve, finally back to full duties after almost being smothered to death by everyone he knows, is drawing on the balcony, having just finished working out a bit in the gym.
Addilynn sighs. “Ok fair point.” She turns to Tony, joking smile turning a bit sad. “So, I’m assuming you came here to sign up for a Screen?”
Tony’s eyes soften. “I do know that.” He says warmly, and then pauses to frown. “Okay actually, you kinda had to remind me today because I got irrationally angry at you over a misunderstanding, but the point still stands, I know that
Steve doesn’t recall any of it in the morning, but that night he dreams inexplicably of flight, of metal, dyed a vivid red and gold, everything blanketed by an overwhelming feeling of safety. Of
“Well. Um. After the last time we came up against the nanites...I decided to upgrade the EMP a bit in the workshop, just in case. I had a lot of time on my hands and...well. Anyways.”
Tony's managed to cannibalize some of Steve's thinner blankets and sew it to the inside lining of the gold and wine red jacket he had been wearing under his peculiar armour. It appears to make him warmer, so Steve doesn't say anything except go find him some more blankets.
Lol thank you all for being patient as I struggle to turn out chapters in a timely manner XD. You've all been wonderful so far. I put in a couple references to some of the comic-verses in here, namely "Shellhead", and "Commander Rogers". I'm especially a sucker for the Shellhead and Winghead nicknames, so hey, why not add it in? ;)
He sighs.
“I’m really sorry too, for what it’s worth.” he directs the sentence up at the lights and Steve snaps around to stare at Tony, gives him a look. “
Steve shivers. He feels cold.
” Wanda’s whispered exclamation is a study in horror, and Steve frowns in response, thinking back to what she had told him. “She did it for vengeance, said we wiped them out, that she was the last one, but if she’s
“Stop with that you big baby, we’re here.” Natasha pulls him into a rather unremarkable building, if you ignore the fact that it’s painted entirely white, as opposed to the sleek glass and warm tones of the other ones they’ve passed.
And that's it. That's the extent of their interaction.
Steve lifts his hand cautiously after a moment and puts it gently on Tony’s shoulder. His touch can’t have been pleasant, icy as it is, but Tony leans into it with a sigh anyways, tension uncoiling.
Tony laughs and puts down his armour, offering Steve his hand, and Steve’s helpless to do anything but follow.
“I figured when I called him that he was just preoccupied. It happened all the time with human Tony, he’d get distracted down in his workshop-” Pepper’s voice becomes tinged with fondness as she says this, “-but. Steve is everything okay?”
The wind stops suddenly and Steve can see through the streaming of his eyes. He’s standing in the border forest of snowy trees on the edge of his kingdom, swaying in place because even as the blizzard was tearing away at him, it had been keeping him upright.
“So.” he says, when Loki is finally on his feet, looking a little uncertain. “You’ve finally kicked the bucket huh? What is this, the fifth time you've supposedly died? I’m shocked.”
“Sounds like a plan.” Steve whispers, closing the distance to kiss him.
“You love it.”
Steve squints at him suspiciously. “You literally never remember dates,” he begins slowly. “how do you know this.”
He looks exhausted, and Steve doesn’t wish to wake him, but at the same time he can’t help it.
them.”
creepy,
“Hmm.”
“Okay. Hands. Hop to it Rogers, daylight is wasting.”
“I mean why not?” Tony replies, bouncing a little on his toes in his excitement. It’s kind of adorable, but Steve resolutely ignores that in order to concentrate on the matter at hand. “It’s almost April 1st.”
Steve supposes it makes some kind of poetical sense if you think about it. One curse numbs you until you can’t feel at all and the other chokes you until all you can do is feel.
The room is dark, and in the dim light, the outline of Tony’s hologram glows, a beautiful arc reactor blue. Steve can’t help but think he looks positively angelic, otherworldly like this, like he’s lit from within.
Tony watches him curiously, asking incremental questions, to which Steve has great fun being contrary under the guise of his usual rigidity. Tony keeps squinting at Steve as if he thinks Steve is messing with him, but has enough doubt not to be able to confirm it.
It’s been a week since the welcome back party, and Steve has settled into life at the compound, concentrating mainly on training up the younger Avengers at the moment. Younger Avengers meaning Peter, Harley and occasionally Wanda.
The entire situation started as a publicity thing.
“Shhhh" Everyone shushes him again.
take on whatever it is with just the
He asks the Hulk, which really isn't going to help clear up the situation. The Hulk pats Thor sympathetically on the shoulder. Thankfully it's Thor, so he only jerks forward slightly instead of entirely face-planting in his coffee
Hulk pulls Tony into a gigantic hug, which he is both simultaneously touched and terrified by.
“Nice apron by the way.” Tony comments amusedly after a minute of slightly awkward, but not unbearable silence, grinning at Steve’s chest.
to be that simple of a solution?” Steve concentrates back in to hear Tony’s question.
There’s a couple of angry grumbles from where Peter’s face is still buried in Steve’s chest and Peter’s hand (the one not in a sling) comes up and smacks Steve on the arm.
Before any of them can say anything else, Tony looks up suddenly, eyes far away as if listening for something, before he suddenly blinks and glances around at the rest of the room.
They go for a walk around the park afterwards and somehow end up debating rather vigorously about the merits of pineapple on pizza, with Tony for and Steve against.
Steve knows Harley doesn’t have any particular superpowers, but he’s already applied to SHIELD as a possible agent, and Steve is adamant to recruit him as one of the Avengers, considering his intellect and level of capability. He sees no reason for Harley not to be given the same opportunity as Peter, considering he’s probably going to throw himself into danger at SHIELD anyway, but Steve will be damned if he doesn’t train them properly before letting them into the field. Being only human doesn’t change a thing. It’s never stopped Clint, Natasha or Tony, so Steve doesn’t let it change his considerations, although he does make sure to go a little easier on Harley when training him up.
He quickly parks his motorcycle and grabs the supplies he bought, depositing them where they belong and jogging down to the meeting room. Everyone - the current Avengers plus Maria, Harley and Clint - is already there by the time he arrives, seated around the table, with Sam standing at the front, changed out of his tactical gear into a pair of old sweats and a t-shirt. Bucky’s seated at his right, a variety of documents and a Stark laptop sitting in front of him.
“Um no.”
“Well, I think Scott is just traveling with his family right now, although he checks in every once and a while. Clint’s doing okay, still grieving a bit, but then again, we all are.” he says, smiling ruefully when Pepper pats him on the arm.
As always, comments give me life, and thank you for reading :))))
"You can't keep
But what he sees instead freezes the budding smile on his face.
Steve wanders leisurely into the kitchen, deciding to make everyone some breakfast. He grabs the nearest apron, pulls out some pots and pans, and gets to mixing some pancake batter, humming happily to himself, the quiet whirring of the refrigerator providing pleasing background noise.
He’s silent the first few days as he watches Steve work, angry and sad and withdrawn all at once, a bone deep kind of sorrow. He keeps glaring at Steve and snaps at him the one time Steve tried to talk to him.
“I know you will.” Steve replies, and lets him go. The armour descends onto Tony in a flurry, attaching and interlocking as smooth as anything, and Tony takes a step forward to leave.
“Look,” he snaps, frustrated and thoroughly done with this conversation. He tries to soften his attitude, but he’s tired, his head hurts, he just can’t deal with this right now, why wasn’t the energy source

There’s something resigned and defeated in his expression, even alongside the curiosity, and Steve can’t help but parallel it to the way Sam had looked at him once, when he had confided to Steve that he can no longer feel his hands.
“Disowned!”
“Save me, these children are evil.” is all Steve says, which sets off another round of laughter.
either. He doubts a human could survive in his kingdom, but yet here Tony is, chattering away in Steve's ear as he goes about his duties.
"-so, you're
Steve's not sure why he's so insistent on this man leaving this place. It doesn't matter in the end, if he chooses to stay, and the fact that Steve was so persistent is a bit unusual. He turns to leave, but then pauses. "What is your name?"
and at this point Steve doubts it will ever stop, but it no longer feels like a vice tightening on his lungs, choking him.
“Duly noted.” he says. Harley squints suspiciously at Steve. “In fact, at this point I half expect you to grab a chair, turn it around backwards and start lecturing me.”
Natasha watches a boy make his friend laugh so hard he falls off a chair and turns to Tony with a dry expression. “Yes. It’s utterly horrifying.”
to be a commander, Buck. And I am
and my
Steve tries to break free before she gets to too high of an altitude, tries to fight back, but her grip is like steel, hard and unyielding, the nano-tech lending her unparalleled strength, and he can feel the substance creeping off her arms to hold him in an uncompromising grip, crawling towards his neck, and there’s the dizzying flying and dodging she’s doing, the wind cold and merciless, slashing at him at breakneck speeds, and Steve can barely breathe enough to speak, can barely get enough air from the way he’s being crushed-
The lab doors shut behind him with a soft whir, locking.
“Then we’re good, thanks for the offer though.”
They had discussed the possibility of Pepper and Happy freaking out and thinking someone had broke in, but considering how often the remaining Avengers (especially Bucky and Clint, Steve had pointed out) prank each other and Pepper, and how familiar they are with the cabin, often just letting themselves in to visit, they all reached the conclusion that the odds of that occurring are miniscule. Tony had informed them as well that the cabin often didn’t have surveillance in the main living areas since it’d been deemed unnecessary after the snap. Everything had been quiet, so since Pepper had been mildly uncomfortable with it, he had restricted it to more heavy security around the house instead. So they didn’t have to worry much about getting a floating cup caught on camera or something.
Tony. Have you been sitting on this since yesterday afternoon? Instead of asking me? You're an important part of this team! We got off on a bad start but I've been trying my hardest to treat you like I would any other person, but...I...I guess I haven't been doing a very good job if you still think-" Steve plants his face in his hands, suddenly just very very upset.  His next words are muffled as a result, and probably barely intelligible, but Steve's too...
Tony gives a whoop of triumph and grabs Steve’s hands, dragging him around the room happily in his victory dance, and Steve finds himself laughing at Tony’s antics despite himself.
" Pepper whispers, and walks forward to take the seat that was vacated by Wanda. Bruce resumes sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall. “What did you get yourself into now?”
came for me?” Tony asks quizzically. Steve gives him a weird look from beside him.  “Of course. Why wouldn’t we? Everyone was really worried.”
Steve watches Tony process this request and bow his head as he thinks, his fingers tapping a silent rhythm on his thigh. They sit in silence for a couple minutes.
“Weak.”
Clint shakes his head at Steve, bemused. “Did Tony give all of us illegal fugitives access to his top secret lab after we beat each other up in an airport? Um no. You though? I’m not that surprised. You two have always had a complicated relationship.”
not ready for that.”
“Alright,” He says, rolling his eyes, “if you guys can manage getting things together on such short notice, than fine.” and then he laughs as Sam gives a loud whoop and high fives Bucky.
"I saved your life." Steve says when the silence stretches on. "I've done my part. You're free to leave when you wish."
There are tears streaming down his cheeks. He hasn’t cried in so long.
Natasha snorts, and Tony turns to glare at her. She sticks out her tongue at him.
at me? How
Steve laughs.
They open the door and Pepper immediately stops walking in order to stare at the perfect rows of cups lining the floor all the way to the stairwell, the perfect face of “does-not-compute” seeming to flash in her eyes. Happy promptly bursts into laughter at the expression on her face and Pepper smacks him on the arm, her own lips twitching with amusement.
Fury, halfway through his current sentence, raises a rather threatening eyebrow in response.
“I could get a cat.” Tony mumbles sullenly.
The room is silent by the time the video finally finishes.
“Hey,” she says, giving him a hug in greeting before she grabs some plates out of his hands to help. “I walked past the kitchen after I said hi to everyone. Dinner smells
“Yes it is.” Steve grumbles, rolling his eyes and trying and failing to hide his grin. “Very bad. Bad AI.
The man’s back is to him now, and there’s a long moment of silence as his shoulders shake. Steve can’t tell what emotion it’s from.
“I dunno Steve. I’m not sure I deserve to either.” she mutters, eyes clouded, and Steve frowns.
It’s hard to care, as time drags on, as he loses track of it entirely. As he goes numbly from one duty to another, from one empty gesture to another. Steve tries desperately not to forget, not to fade, but it's difficult when he feels so detached.
He goes over every aspect of the fight in detail, over and over, writes down everything that happened to the last, dredges up what little he remembers of the end. It’s not remotely pleasant, remembering the feeling of not being able to get enough air, her vicious smirk, knowing that he’s probably going to die, but he pushes past that because this is important. He takes breaks when it gets a bit too much, though he tries his best to keep going. Every last detail could be crucial.
Steve laughs. “I’d expect nothing less.”
“Has the good captain suddenly become a creature of Helheim?”
Maybe...Steve had said something. Maybe he did something and didn’t realize. It didn’t seem like it at the time, but Steve’s learned from personal experience that you can’t always predict someone’s triggers. It's not always the big things that break us.
,” Steve begins, picking up steam. “-improved on the EMP just in case of another future incident, took into account all the people a widespread pulse could put in danger, installed it into the armours, was ready to fight with us on a
Steve darts forward and quickly pries it off after a moment's debate, because the cold metal isn't helping the man's body temperature. He is thankfully, wearing clothes underneath (there's slight disappointment at that, but Steve really can't figure out why), so he quickly chucks the armour pieces off to the side and stands at the opposite corner of the room, distancing himself as far as possible so he doesn't accidentally freeze the man further.
, something Steve’s long forgotten. That rush of adrenaline through his system, that high of going at breakneck speeds.
Steve laughed a little, felling a little more like himself “You would have lost too” he said, and Tony smiled at him.
“Pepper!”
“Don’t you fucking dare!” she moved back limping. She caught a vase threatening Tony while shaking her head “Don’t you fucking dare touching me! Why did you had to lie to me?”
Steve sighted and shrugged a little trying to come up with the words he wanted to say to him.
“What kind of- “Tony stopped himself, because it was taking too long with the sarcasm, and Steve was offering a blowjob to him. It was really happening. In Clint’s living room yes, but... He was taking too long to answer. Steve was starting to look less ready and more dubious. “Yes, yes, yes, of course.”
“Tell me is not too corny, please” he said getting up and looking into his bag. Tony was all but going to start jumping of the excitement. “It’s just… A little something… To remind you of myself.”
“What about you? And the mo-"
It was the most passionate kiss Steve had ever have. Tony was kissing him like he had waited all his life, and Steve was kissing back just like that. Somethings are meant to be, like the song says.
“Fuck, Steve” Tony whispered. Steve couldn’t say anything, he took Tony’s hand and kissed it.
Tony followed Pepper, naked and stepping in the glass from the broken vase. It wasn’t the only thing she had broken; Like a hurricane was passing through the stance. It looked directly out of a Carrie Underwood video.
“I’d love to see that.”
“I have my demons” Tony answered with a thin line of voice. He was melting against that wall. The whole word already forgotten. It was just him and Steve, finally.
Two guys, one really big and the other slim as they come burst the door open and went into the apartment as if they were ready to fight and die. That Tony could do.
But the time came that Tony had to go out through the door. And Steve didn’t have the guts to let Tony go without kissing him.
“And why did you caught it then?”
They walked for a little more, turned left a couple of times. They weren’t far away, but the paparazzi didn't follow them. At least not that they could see.
“I’m going to wear it every day, for now to forever.” Steve smiled. “Enough of this, it’s rotting my teeth. Let’s get down to business” he said winking, and took Steve by the hem of the t-shirt he had put on so little time before, and backed throwing them both into the bed, crushing himself under Steve. Just as planned. More or less.
all of them, they were the only movies they had found in Clint’s apartment. Tony wasn’t disappointed. And Steve haven’t seen them. They were just the right kind of films to watch that night.
The big one saw him and pointed, Tony crouched and ducked a knife the slim one threw at him.
Silence.
‘Had talked’ how long has Steve been there?
“I’m sure she isn’t blaming you…, a lot”
“Just because I know you’d love it.”
But Steve was wrong, almost everyone knew why Steve wasn’t eating like he usually did, nor drinking, much less talking.
“But what about the lives of all the people who have loss someone because we couldn’t make it?”
“No, you made your fucking speech back then. It’s my turn. You may have let your fucking heart frozen back in the ice, Cap. But I still feel. And, even if everyone tries to convince myself it’s only me I think about, that’s absolutely not true. I think of you every single day. I have done it since before I met you. I hated you. I idolized you. I fucking wacked it thinking about you. And that was before meeting you!” Tony paused, Steve was looking at him, his mouth shut, but he was blushing. “You just didn’t open up to me, never. I tried. God knows I tried to get to you. But you just think so badly of me you can forgive me for anything. I’m sorry I married but I love Pepper. I’m sorry I can’t live up to the image you have of my father, I’m my own man, you see? I have done things too!”
“Let it be a surprise.”
Lots of sweets nothing whispered between moans as their eyes locked together.
“You love them even more than yourself?”
Of course it was the ring.
“Hey, I have my right to do so, I’m your…” Steve quickly shut up, and Tony suddenly was wide awake, “It’s boyfriend okay with you?”
“God knows I have made mistakes” everyone was quiet the moment he started talking. He coughed, the mic made a horrible sound “I’m sorry. As I was saying, I have been wrong a lot of times, but I think, at least I like to think, every time I came up with a good solution” he looked at Pepper “and the times I didn’t, this beautiful, smart, intelligent and dedicated woman, Virginia Pots, helped me came up with one, serving it to me on a silver plate. It’s for that, that I love this woman-”
“Me too” said Natasha pointing her thumb at Laura and Clint kissing.
“Just tell me about the apartment before I change my mind and drop you for some motorist.”
“You can” Steve said, and moved them towards the nearest wall. And Tony let him. Oh, he wouldn’t stop him if his life depended on it. “You want?”
“No, I thought… Well, maybe you didn’t want to…”
“It’s in the side table” Tony said “don’t ask, Clint told me” Steve laughed and Tony did too. He tried to reach the side table without moving and it went horrible wrong, almost losing balance, Tony caught him “Next time I’d let you fall”
“Boyfriend?” he could see the fear in Steve’s blue eyes, “it’s more than okay, for now” he said, moving closer to Steve to kiss him.
“Tony,
“It’s not even the longest I’ve gone without sleep,” Tony mumbles vaguely, “Sleep is for the weak and for peasants, this is barely college level sleep deprived.”
“Dude. Really?” Peter asks incredulously. Bucky rolls his eyes. “It was the only one left at the dollar store. Sue me.”
Tara raises her eyebrow at the name choice, but doesn’t respond.
Steve smiles happily, turns to watch the screen, and shuts up.
Two days later, Sam and Bucky arrive back on compound as discreet as can be, and calls a team meeting.
” is all he says, and buries his face in his hands. Steve hums, and puts his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him close, stroking his hand through Tony’s hair, pressing a kiss to his temple, offering him comfort in contact where he can’t with words.
“It was always too late. You don’t need to apologize.” Steve murmurs numbly, feeling the warmth spread up his arm, and Tony looks up at him sadly.
better to do that than you. Who else but Tony to continue Tony Stark’s inventions?” and Steve feels very accomplished when it draws out a laugh.
“An hour at most.” Scott says, “Well, not including the time it took to get here and the treatment for your burns. Clint, Pepper, Peter and Harley are on their way.”
“Great!” Tony says, straightening up happily. “There’s delicate electrical work that I can’t do on my own. I’m gonna need your hands.” Steve looks at him, a bit startled.
“Of course that’s what you choose,” Steve rolls his eyes, but his smile is beaming. Tony gasps dramatically.
There’s a couple dodgy moments, because there’s always bound to be this early on, a minor comment or a sentence that jabs in a wrong spot, and Steve will tense, or Tony will become quiet. It helps that they know neither of them are doing it on purpose, and it never comes to anything too bad, one of them backtracking, or talking it out with the other.
“Well, maybe just stand down for now, in case this is a minor fight. We don’t really know what the backlash from the media and public will be if there’s a seeming replacement for Iron Man, and I
smiling about, young lady?" Tony asks, mock annoyed as he rounds on Morgan. "Are you
Steve rolls his eyes. “It’s been five days Pepper, I haven’t needed to “take it easy” since three days ago. And believe me I have. Clint hid my paperwork deep in the vents, I didn’t really have a choice.”
He eventually decides to think nothing more of it, and goes back to work.
He waves them off after that, to the sounds of Sam saying “try not to rip the steering wheel
“And everything I debriefed the rest of the team on?”
“You’re welcome to crash in one of the guest bedrooms here,” she says, getting up with a grunt and a muttered “I’m getting too old for this”. Steve hides his smile, but shakes his head slightly.
Steve hurriedly pulls out the chain he wears under his cloak, and drops it, with the frozen petal, over Tony’s neck, tucking it under his armour. “For luck.” he says when Tony gives him a confused look.
“Oh my God,
Usually Steve wouldn't mind suddenly getting booted from the lab; it's not exactly unusual for Tony to get distracted by some new idea or situation and suddenly leave, flickering out and returning later with a sheepish expression when he remembers. It's also not unusual for him to kick people out of his work space either. After all, Tony isn't exactly shy about letting people know when he needs to be alone to do his inventing in peace. It's one of the things Steve can't help but admire about Tony, when his mind is going too fast for people to keep up, when Tony hears that siren call of a new revolutionary idea and shuts down in order to concentrate all his efforts on it.
Oh, fuck it all.
“James Barnes.”
It hadn't been there this morning, when he left for work. He had a bad night last night, worse than usual, his dreams full of blood and Bucky screaming, and he had woken up drenched in sweat with the smell of gunpowder in his nose, his heart beating overtime. He hadn't dared to go back to sleep so he'd sketched till dawn. Then he'd choked down some coffee in the hopes it would clear his head and torn up all the drawings he'd done. They were shit anyway, like everything else he'd done since he came back from Afghanistan. He'd left for the high school with a persistent little headache brewing, which had steadily gotten worse during the day, due to some particularly unmotivated students and it had reached its peak at the department meeting after school, where, just like every single year before, he had to explain you could not teach an art class without a budget for art supplies. And that those supplies never actually went down in price.
Look, this second chapter only took a few months! With that kind of acceleration I'll be cranking out chapters by the minute before you know it!
“Behold your transport device!” He crowed. “And may it bring you a lot of joy. And the good captain, of course.” He looked at Sam. “It will only work for the right person. Since I am still here, we can safely assume I spoke the truth and it is not me, no matter how much he hates me. Would you like to try it?" His grin was turning positively diabolical, Tony thought. He was starting to get a bad feeling about this. Something that Loki found this funny, was almost guaranteed to be very bad indeed. Loki tossed the ball to Sam, who caught it easily.
he was trying to think of something,
sentient.”
It was late afternoon when they first glimpsed the Irish Sea on the horizon. They were coming down out of the hills after a relatively uneventful day. Only one knight had challenged them and Bors had dispatched him with ease. They'd had a lady hermit prophecy at them as well, but she'd just confirmed that everyone except Tony was good and brave and on the right track, and that Percival had to be careful who he trusted, but she hadn't given them any tasks that delayed them. The sun was getting low, glinting off the sea on the horizon, and while Steve was tempted to push on to reach the water, just for the sense of accomplishment it would give him, he knew that would be hard on Tony. So they made camp a little early in an abandoned barn and it was just as well, because shortly afterwards the sun was obscured by a storm front moving in and they were grateful for the bit of shelter the holey thatched roof provided. He made sure Tony had a dry spot to sleep in and Tony looked at him, thoroughly unimpressed.
“Oh God,” says Tony, his voice strained and somewhat breathless. “You're big. Give me a second.”
Steve's up. He knows he hasn't been this up in
“I made a bet with myself that you would have more than 10. I won.” Steve smiled at him as if he was really glad he won that bet. With himself. Dork.
He could hear the smile in her voice when she said: “Goodnight, Mr. Stark.”
It was not the words, but Steve's voice tipping from anger into anguish, that made Tony comply. Before the armor had even finished folding back into the suitcase, Steve was zipping him out of his racing leathers. Tony wanted to protest and he tried really hard not to insinuate anything about Steve undressing him, or crack jokes about buying him dinner first, because even he could see that would be really inappropriate right now, but god, he couldn't stop his brain from going there. It got worse when he was finally down to boxer briefs and a T-shirt and Steve was patting him down looking for blood and bruises and it took a massive force of will not to get hard. He fixed his eyes on the tree branches above him and did prime numbers in his head to boost his endurance.
you." Three seconds later an arrow sporting mistletoe thunked into the wall over Tony's head. Again with the arrows in his walls! Before he could ream Clint out, though, the man was yelling again.
“Del,
"You would trade his soul for the blond one's?"
Tony nodded.
Rhodes leaned a shoulder against the doorjamb. Tony figured he should probably ask him inside, but he didn’t want to interrupt.
"Hey!" yelled Clint. "What about the kitchen clean up?"
"You people....." continued Deere.
Then, seemingly addressing the stars, Tony said softly: “I guess deep down he loved me anyway. A couple of years ago I found this film that he had recorded when I was young in which he said I was his greatest creation.”
"Not a chance," Tony answered, "I don't like those kinds of prayers."
It couldn’t last. He knew it couldn’t last, but he’d had this.
He rolled his head to the side to watch Steve's profile. The tv didn't seem to faze him, particularly, or maybe it was just that he had already reached his limits and was now beyond fazing.
Draco brightened immediately.
"The fuck is he doing fighting calamari without any stuff? Jesus, Steve...." Tony muttered as he worked on getting all the luggage attached to the Mark VIII.
"I can help with that. I can put them down with the staple gun and you'll have all the time in the world to incapacitate them. I mean, 5 minutes should do it, right?"
Seconds later the boar burst out of the underbrush and proved him right. Its attention drawn by Galahad's panicked motion, it headed straight for the hapless boy. Galahad didn't freeze, Steve had to give him that, but his spear wasn't ready and it hit the massive beast in the shoulder instead of the chest. The boar spun and the movement wrenched the spear out of Galahad's hands. Screaming in rage and pain, it went for the boy. On the other side of the clearing, Steve has risen as soon as it was clear the boar wasn't headed his way, and lacking his shield, he did the only thing he could think of. He hurled the massive boar spear at the hog. This type of spear was never meant to be thrown, but the upside of being dosed with super serum was that you were able to throw a wide variety of things that weren't meant to be thrown. The spear caught the beast in the side of the neck and yanked it sideways, pinning it to the ground as it went clear through. But the wickedly curved tusk took a sizable chunk out of Galahad's thigh as the boar went down, and the boy collapsed screaming in pain. The animal was screaming too, its hooves pawing the air frantically, still refusing to die.
"Oh, that's probably due to deformation of the cornea, caused by cryogenic pressure. It should pass when your temperature has normalized."
Steve saw the armor first. Tony hadn’t bothered to turn the light on so he was standing in the dark, while the orange glow of the street light through the window was glinting off his suit. Steve’s eyes widened in surprise and then alarm and Tony realized that the suit was kinda collapsed against the wall as if it had been shot and Steve wouldn’t know he wasn’t in it.
“Captain Rogers here to see you, Sir.”
Steve followed him off the balcony and out of the room, breathing a sigh of relief. At least they weren't talking about sex toys anymore. Although it seemed kind of messed up that he'd prefer snipers over sex toys, really.
After the dryer buzzes the end of the cycle, Tony brings back the basket full of warm clothes and starts folding them on the couch. His movements are quick and efficient and Steve can't help but admire the play of the muscles and sinews under the rough tan skin of his lower arms. When Tony has put all his clothes into his laundry sack he drops the basket on the floor and rests his elbows on his thighs as he looks at Steve.
"Tony! Please!" he bit out. But Tony must have taken that as encouragement, rather than the warning that it was, because he peeled the wet briefs over Steve's cock and let them snap in place under Steve's balls. He thought that probably ought to be uncomfortable, but instead he felt a thrill at the way his balls were pushed up by the elastic.
“What does he mean?” asked Steve.
"Sir, Captain Rogers is trying to get your attention." JARVIS interrupted his mental merry go round. Tony shook his head. He had almost forgotten he had a passenger, even with his arm instinctively curled around Steve's waist. Not that he could feel it, the more was the pity. When he turned to Steve, the man was glaring and forcefully pointing downward. Right. Land. He supposed it'd be safe to land now. He glanced down and spotted a orchard, trees neatly lined up in the spring sunshine, the nearest rough hewn stone house a couple of miles away. As good a place as any to make plans.
"JARVIS," Steve said, "How close would my com unit have to be for you to be able to pick up the conversation?"
Steve tried but fell a little short of indignant.
Tony slid onto his knees before Steve and took his hands. Looking up in Steve’s blue gaze, he said quietly:
“Although I am sure I know some other dudes that would be ecstatic to be carried anywhere by a guy like you.”
Steve looks at him.
. Bruce claimed it was too much of a hassle to make frequently, so on the occasions that he did, they were all there. Tony had left the kittens trying to catch the raindrops sliding down the other side of his window and had joined the others in the kitchen while they waited for the lasagna to be done in another 30 minutes. He was playing black jack for toothpicks with Natasha (he’d learned his lesson about playing with real money after he’d been forced to live on grocery store bread and peanut butter for a week until his next paycheck came in), Clint and Thor were playing darts and Bruce was chopping tomatoes for the salad. Clint was (futilely) explaining the difference between force and finesse in darts to Thor, when the doorbell rang. Everyone looked at Tony. He’d lived here for three fucking years, but he was still the last one in, so he still had door duty whenever the kitchen bell rang (rather than one of their room bells).
“I suppose you'd call it girlfriend. She... yeah... she died. Just before our date. Um, last year.” Ten years ago, actually, but it might as well have been last year, at the time Steve came back from the dead, for all the time he'd had to process it.
"Well, I was too busy blaming myself. Just like you, apparently.” Tony looked at him sideways. “You sure you don't actually think I am the fuck up in this scenario?"
“What?” Tony gestured helplessly. “You threatened to castrate me if I touched your soap! How was I to know Steve would get special dispensation?”
Steve wondered if he wanted to know what a bike with Tony’s spirit would be like. He imagined it being powerful, proud and… dangerous. Something dark and joyful curled low in his belly.
"Whoa! Whoa! Not so fast! I want to enjoy this!" Tony pushed himself up on his elbows to get a better look and Steve felt his face grow hot. His dick was fine with Tony's intense scrutiny, though. Never better.
“Hand jobs, blow jobs, frottage. Not anal.”
“He’s… He seems fine.” His voice sounded weird even to his own ears. He looked aside at Steve to see if he’d noticed, but that was a mistake. Steve was looking at him and he was very, very close. It was as if the air had been sucked out of the room. He didn’t know if he was moving or if Steve was moving him, but the next thing he knew they were standing face to face.
The day Steve shaved off his beard was a big victory in Tony’s book. They still weren’t doing blow jobs, and Steve grew it back after a couple of days, after he’d yelled at Tony. This time  for Tony’s refusal to go and find a job, now that Steve couldn’t since he was in the country illegally. He cycled through various stages of facial hair in the space of a few weeks, but still, it was progress.
Tony regretted sitting down on the bench almost immediately. Now his ass was freezing too. Steve sat down next to him, a solid wall of warmth and Tony could not help leaning in a little closer. Steve set the tree down between his knees and held on to it with his legs, apparently with total ease. Tony tried very hard not to imagine Steve's massively muscled naked thighs, because it seemed a little too pornographic for the romcom they were acting out, but then he realized it would be impossible to get an erection with the way his balls were trying to crawl up into his body cavity to get away from the freezing bench, so he indulged himself until Steve got the tree settled and turned to him to hold up his hand for a chestnut. The way Steve smiled at him as he did so, was enough to wipe even naked thighs from his mind.
Maybe Loki put him here because there were plenty of other sanctimonious pricks to keep him company.
"Stark! The armor! Put it on
Steve still felt sceptical.
"Sam! You're back! Wait. Does this mean that the Winter Soldier..."
He had his elbows on his knees and his fists clenched in his hair, when the limo door finally opened and Steve stumbled in, obviously being pushed by Rhodey, who stuck his head in after. Tony sat up with alacrity. He briefly tried to smooth out his ruined hair, then gave it up for a lost cause.
“Oh, come on! You had enough on your plate and it’s not like you could help. If I couldn’t fix it, I thought nobody could fix it, so I was giving you a clean break and all that shit… I thought it was very noble of me at the time, actually.”
Steve looked horrified. Why was Steve horrified? The man had no living relatives, why was he horrified at the idea of Tony spending Christmas alone? He'd done it for decades. It wasn't a big deal.
“What the hell,
“Sir Gawaine, know that you shall never attain the Grail, because you are living the untruest life that I have ever heard knights live,” declared the hermit passionately. “Sir Stephen is a maid and has never sinned the sins of the flesh and he slays no man lightly and therefore he shall achieve what you shall not. You must do penance for your sins.”
“Ask Percy if he has a guitar. We can all sing 'Let It Be' by the campfire before we go to sleep,” he offered with a feeble grin.
They were both silent for a moment while they contemplated their losses.
“Look at that, Steve! This is phenomenal! Bruce-the-bike was never this responsive!”
"Okay. Now take off the shirt. Slowly." Steve crossed his arms to grab the hems of the shirt, then stretched them up towards the ceiling. He pretended not to hear Tony's low whistle. When his face came out of the shirt Tony was sitting on the edge of the bed, beckoning him closer.
The night was bad again. The fever flared higher and Tony complained of numbness in all his extremities. A few times the arc reactor got so dim Steve was certain it had stopped altogether, but every time it flickered back to life after a minute or so. Tony's heartbeat was all over the place while that happened. The next morning he was barely coherent. There was no talking as they walked that day. The roads were getting wider and they'd passed a village or two, so at least they seemed to be heading in the direction of something important. By mid-morning Tony was delirious, seeing enemies everywhere. His jerky evasive maneuvers had Steve almost lose his balance a few times. He picked up the pace as much as he could, worry clawing at his insides. He'd run if he thought Tony would be able to hold on, but the grip around his neck often went so slack that he was already stooping to prevent him from falling off.
"It's totally over the top and no, I wish I could draw it."
“'Smybed,” he mutters finally.
“Stark. You're back in the tower? Hawkeye and Widow, I guess. Where is...”
Steve lifted him in one fell swoop and ignored Tony's pointing at the couch. Instead he carried him all the way to Tony's bedroom and, God, he had missed that bed. Hospital beds sucked. Steve deposited Tony carefully. When he tried to straighten up, Tony pulled him down next to him. Steve obliged, but he wasn't looking happy.
Steve looked at him in disbelief. "You don't have anyone who calls the shots at the scene? Seriously? What about you? Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye? I can see why the Hulk is out, but you all seem competent to lead."
The press conference was interminable. For maximum effect, Pepper had brought Tony in first. He’d put on his public persona and assured everyone that he was completely sane and competent, cracked some jokes and managed to not even once imply that he was dying. The corporate espionage claims were obviously ludicrous and it would soon be clear where the late Ivan Vanko had gotten his outdated designs. He would be sure to let them all know as soon as it was. Blablabla.
"I don't remember," he said curtly.
In the cabin Stark let go, to Steve's relief and at the same time not, and turned to him.
"So we are not killing him? We are defending the demon?" Okay, not quite unquestioningly.
The men in the clearing tensed as the rustle in the underbrush became the loud cracks of snapping branches, overlaid with angry grunts. Everyone gripped their spears tighter and even Dinadan, who had been keeping up an innuendo laden string of jokes about men and spears, mostly featuring Galahad and his lack of experience, looked grim now. Angry boars were no joke and Steve, who'd only done this once before, knew that even the slightest moment of inattention could be fatal. Unlike the stags and the wolves who ran from hunters, boars were notoriously bad tempered and territorial and would fight back with everything they had. Steve looked around him. Tristan, Gareth Pretty Hands, Dinadan and Gaheris all had their boar spears solidly butted in the ground and angled in the right direction. The only chance of making a clean kill was to get the boar to impale itself on the spear, while it was planted in the ground. No one, except maybe Steve himself, could hold the spear in his hands and hope to keep a hold of it while 250 pounds of enraged pig tried to get at your guts with its tusks. Failing to make a clean kill was asking for death. Steve watched as Galahad, muttering in irritation, tried to wrestle his spear into the right position. He was the newest of Arthur's knights, seventeen years old and still very wet behind the ears.
“Mark my words, Tony. It'll be the story you're going to be telling at parties of 'how we got together'.”
Once he caught himself petting the fabric of Steve's suit and proceeded to work 72 hours with no sleep to try to burn that out of his brain, but it didn't work. He still dreamed of Steve. The dreams were wonderful and horrible at the same time.
Tony obediently turned his head and spit into Steve’s palm. Steve smiled at him as if he had done something remarkable, and, man, they were a pair of besotted idiots. Then Steve lifted his hips up to make some space and brought his hand down to slick up Tony’s cock with spit. Oh god, that felt
“You're an actual Fae, or do they just call you that?” Tony asked, because that distinction was important. He was very careful not to show any pity. He could tell she would not take that well and he was familiar with that feeling, so he respected it.
"It acts as fuel in gun powder."
Tony shrugged. "Fine. On your head. Try not to let go when your fingers go numb, though."
“See, not that hard. More specifically, they say that she recently lost her husband, that she relishes her newfound freedom, but that she still needs external validation. How about that guy over there?” He nodded at a younger man in stiff, formal robes, who had a pale complexion and mousy hair.
"My lawyers should be here in a minute. Then we'll talk. In the meantime let me show you the helicarrier upgrades I've been working on. How do you feel about tasers....?"
“Captain Roger’s disappearance caused quite a stir. It was one of the first ambushes in the conflict with Iraq, with some the first casualties and he was the first soldier to go MIA. It was heavily speculated that he’d been taken by enemy forces. Which they denied, of course.” He looked at Steve who still hadn’t looked up, even though Huey (or Louie) was head butting his hand. “I’d love to hear your story of what really happened,” Rhodes said to him.
“Ah,” Tony mutters softly, “
"Is that it? Are you pissed I didn't let you finish your naughty little daydream? Did little Stevie still want to play? So sorry, Cap, but I didn't want you to ruin our chances of getting out of here. So I am afraid you had to hold on to your baby-batter. I do apologize for taking the long term view. I know strategic planning is more your forte, but you were too busy having dirty dreams.”
"I think we can safely assume he means this ramshackle heap of hovels rather than a slumber party."
"I don't believe you would want to know, squire. Just know that it would tarnish the purity of his soul if it were to be reality." The way the man almost smacked his lips when he said the word 'soul' made Tony's hackles rise.
"Hey, Tony!"
the part, you have to
“And then what? Hang out on the street and wait for you to have time for me next? Move in with you? Share your little room? Be your kept man? Or would you expect me to pay rent?”
“What am I supposed to do with them?”
Well, shit. That was going to be supremely awkward. In the
the word gay. Lord help them all.
Holy fucking fuck.
“House elf magic is a little different. So when the headmistress wouldn’t let me bring him to school, I had his portrait painted and took that. Almost as good, especially since the Hogwarts elves are afraid of him.”
“Your mother was obviously as feeble minded as you.” retorted Gawaine angrily.
"That's unfortunate. He is a decent king, especially compared to some of the others."
“Alright, alright, I get it. Narcissistic compliment is narcissistic.”
"The woman says 'we had a deal....,'" he said to Tony, "The man says he's aware of that. But he thinks it is too early to approach the men.... The woman says 'we'll have to move quick, the cruise is only a few more days. Making the proposal now will give us time for negotiations. And if they turn it down, there is still time for alternate options....' Now the man says 'what if the blond one gets violent when we make the proposal?' and the woman says.... 'don't be an idiot, the blond one will do what the older man tells him to do, he's the one in charge.' And the man goes 'why don't you do it?' and the woman says 'it is part of what you need to do, we've been over this! If you don't there will be consequences.' Now the man says it's fine, it's fine, he'll make the arrangements for the dinner seating right now, and do the negotiations after....”
"It sounds like the Grail, to be honest," said Percival and both Steve and Tony swung to look at him.
“Uh. Yeah.”
"Wait! What do we do with the boar? It is rightfully yours, Sir Stephen. You made the kill." Gaheris interjected.
“Thanks for ruining that for me. I had almost convinced myself to give him the benefit of the doubt. That he meant well.”
He has a hard time getting up early Sunday morning, after three bad nights in a row. He makes himself do it anyway because it is going to be another scorcher today and if he sleeps in his usual Sunday run on the trail behind his house will be seriously uncomfortable. Not that he hasn't done worse, in fatigues and with a full pack, in Afghanistan, but he didn't enjoy that then and he doesn't enjoy it now. And he has nothing left to prove in that department. Still he feels guilty somehow for not waiting until the temperature nears the triple digits. The plastic orange fence runs along one side of the trail for about half a mile, before the trail veers off to the left, leaving the fence to run along a hillside, but he can only spot a few goats. He wonders if one of his neighbors left their back gate open and the goats are eating their wastefully watered lawn. The one time he left his own back gate open, he was visited by a family of deer. They were kind of cute, but Gwenna almost had a conniption and his mom's flower beds suffered a lot, so now he is more careful about closing it. Despite the early hour, he is still drenched in sweat when he gets back. He glances surreptitiously at the trailer, under the guise of wiping the sweat off his forehead with the hem of his shirt, as he walks past it on his way back, his breath still ragged. Is it even safe to have those canisters of gasoline sitting out next to the generator in this heat? Right next to his mom's fence? At least the generator isn't on at the moment. He still worries about it all the way to the shower.
“The guy behind me is kicking my heels. Can you and Tony discuss the finer points of the stitching some other time? We’re holding up the line. Steve, so nice to meet you!”
"Yeah."
Steve slid his hands up and down Tony's abs. "And if you were Hydra and you were going to send in a few assassins..."
The snide comment he had ready for Jane died on his lips as he took in the sodden figure in front of him, when he opened the door. Steve’s hair was plastered to his head, the rain running in rivulets down his face. His pants were soggily clinging to his legs and even the leather jacket looked like it had just given up and become porous.
“It’s not great for their stool, but right now the calories are more important.” Bruce started towards his room, then said over his shoulder: “Tony, you get Steve warm and dry in the meantime. Clint, you finish the salad.”
“Entwhistle is who I needed after last year.”
He tried setting up some calculations in Lotus 1-2-3 and once again swore that, as soon as he had some actual time and resources, he was going to revolutionize mathematical software. But these were only rough preliminary calculations anyway, the real work was going to be done soon on the mainframe he had reserved time on. Between Lotus being cumbersome and having to pluck Clint off the keyboard and his shoulders, and dislodging Tasha from his pajama clad leg that she tried to climb like a tree, the first hour was a wash. But then the calculations had been entered and were plugging along nicely while he marked up some of the literature he was going to reference in his thesis. Clint and Tasha had fallen asleep in his lap, their limbs entangled and Tasha still gnawing dreamily on the drawstring of his pants. It was strangely peaceful and he got a lot done.
"Tell me again how that went."
“What?” Steve looked ragged and confused. A quick glance told Tony that Rhodes was leaning back in his chair, with his legs crossed and his fingers steepled thoughtfully against his lips.
"No, I am afraid I am just a mortal like you, Sir Galahad."
"I'm sorry, but I can't right now. My companion is too ill to move."
So there was that. He sighed again and scratched his stubble.
"Sure. You want Santa or Angels?"
"We're never fucking again. There is no way we could top that one. It's gotta be all downhill from here."
In retrospect, Tony should have handed Steve over to Fury with a 'good riddance' the very first time the man showed up. The ugly bastard actually caught him in his office and given the amount of time Tony spent out of his office, that was a small miracle right there. How he had talked his way past Natalie, who was heading the front, was another. He'd stolen Natalie away from Legal for his personal assistant as soon as Pepper had left to go solidify her new status as CEO of Stark Industries. On the surface because she was unflappable and ruthless. Even more obviously because she was gorgeous and he was Tony Stark and it would have been quite unlike himself not to hire her on the spot. Totally out of character, in fact, and really, things had to be as normal as possible right now, with him harboring Cap and the secret of his own imminent death.
“I’ve decided to turn myself in.” Steve sounded resigned, but determined. “I’m done running. I tried. But it wasn’t working anymore.”
Tony didn't say anything for a long time. That was alright, Steve hadn't expected an answer and he wasn't going to push it. He did another couple of branches. When Tony finally spoke it startled him.
That led right to feeling irrationally angry at Howard for fucking up Tony's view of Steve in his formative years. Familiar terrain, that, because if there was one person Tony was used to being angry at, it was Howard Stark.
He'd requested to Skype Tony so many times now, but he'd gotten turned down each and every time. When, in desperation, he'd requested to speak to Clint and later even Fury, they'd turned that down too. Steve himself was 'classified' now and apparently they didn't trust him to stay that way if had any more contact with people who weren't 'need to know'. He didn't know any other way of reaching Tony. It was maddening and infuriating, and it kept him awake at night.
“I said, Steve-”
“Ugh. Those brown and yellow flowery monstrosities your grandmother used on Saturdays? Fine. Live! See if I care!” Then he smiled a genuine smile, maybe the first one Steve had seen all evening. “Good to see you looking well, cousin.”
“Why don’t you hire me too?”
“Goodbye. I have been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.”
“I freed them all after my parents died. They’re the ones that raised me, didn’t seem right to keep them enslaved. Thank Merlin most of them chose to stay on, anyway. I’m pretty sure I’d have fucked up completely if they hadn’t kept things running.”
It felt as if he'd searched the same bit of sea for hours, but it really couldn't have been more than minutes -he hoped it hadn't been more than minutes or Tony would already be dead- when he finally spotted a glint of red and gold off to his left and a little above him. It was the gauntlet. To Steve's eternal relief Tony was still attached to it. He grabbed him by the collar and started going up. It was much, much harder than going down. He almost wished he'd taken the time to take off his chain mail before jumping in after Tony. Gritting his teeth, he struggled upward. With a great gasp of air he finally broke the surface. He looked around them. The ship was almost out of sight. No longer weighed down by the serpent it had continued on its way at a rapid clip and there wasn't a chance in hell Steve could overtake it, weighed down as he was. His only option was to swim to land, which looked to be a few miles away at least. He looked at Tony, who was pale and wan in the light of the cloudy afternoon, but he couldn't tell if the man was breathing or not. It couldn't be helped. He allowed himself one sigh of frustration and then he started swimming with Tony in the rescue hold.
“Come on,” Tony wheedled. “Don’t you want to ride it?”
"That's my middle name."
me. If I remember correctly,” and he glared at his teammates, because what the fuck had they been telling Steve and why even mention that awkward episode at all? “If I remember correctly, I expressed violent disbelief that you would dislike me more than you liked Sam or Natasha, because I thought I knew you couldn't possibly like me more than them.”
“Gonna see if you're ready for me yet.” Tony's voice is a little breathless.
tower and he could sit wherever he damn well pleased.
Tony finally found his voice.
"No, really, Tony. You knew squat about this shit before. What's with the recent expertise?"
“Let. Me. Go!” Tony bit out through clenched teeth. Steve dropped his hand with alacrity and sat back on his haunches. He finally noticed the wand that Tony had had pointed where Steve’s temple was just a second ago. He swallowed.
“Kuwait.” Curtly.
So here he was, tagging along with a bunch of taciturn Danes who slept and swept the seafloor with sonar in twelve hours shifts and didn't do much for relaxation besides drinking heavily and talking about Danish reality tv. Or something. Tony didn't speak much Danish, and the crew's ability to remember to speak English when Tony was present was inversely correlated to the amount of alcohol they had consumed.
“What’s wrong? You don’t look so good.”
in the throes of death, it was full on afternoon and the three men could barely lift their lances anymore. They left the carcass on the beach for the screeching gulls and dragged themselves up the cliff path.
Another bicycle went by. This one had a loose chain by the sound of it. Tony was sure it would fall off within two blocks.
Tony snorted. "If they come any more civilized than you I don't want to know about it, sweetheart." Steve laughed again, then seemed to slowly drift off back to sleep. Tony lay awake for while, until Steve shifted and threw an arm across Tony's chest, softly breathing against his neck. Oh Jesus fuck it, there was that cow-eyes-in-the-moonlight-thing again. He sternly told his dick this was all perfectly innocent and there was absolutely no need to rise to the occasion even as he pushed backwards to fit a little snugger under Steve's arm. He was never going to fall asleep with someone breathing on him like this. But that was the last coherent thought he had.
"That was me being Iron Man. You know this. I went and subdued some terrorists. What's your problem?"
“As to what
, for gods sake. And Peggy... Aunt Peggy?!? Oh. My. God.
“You had a stupid reason! One that assumed that you knew what I was thinking. Which you
Tony blinked blearily. The hell was he awake for?
“Afghanistan.”
And so Tony got to spend another two hours in the blissful torture of almost but not quite being plastered to Steve's side while they watched Jimmy Stewart being pummeled by life. Tony personally thought this fucking movie was bullshit, but even that fact seemed to have lost its relevance this night.
The trial lasted three months. Three whole fucking months. On Elisa's advice he laid relatively low and only went out a few times with an obviously female companion. Darcy Lewis, Jane Foster's assistant, was more than happy to help a guy out if it involved new clothes and expensive food.
Four of the women wanted to go home. All of them would get to take a sizable share of the seven brothers' ill gotten gains. Maybe it would be enough to convince their families to take them back. Steve could only hope. Lady Eloise would contact their families so they could send an escort.
virtue."
"Alright then. You asked. See, Steve has this uniform from the forties. Looks reeeaaal good on him, you know. And when he wears it to bed, he's insists on proper - " Tony's mouth was suddenly covered by Steve's hand and he only caught a quick glance of Steve's blush before his head was unceremoniously pinned under Steve's arm.
He had to move his leg, because it was starting to cramp. The limo bench really wasn’t big enough for them and the motion almost made him topple off the seat. Steve still had his arms around him though and stopped him from tipping over the edge. After a few seconds of trying to fit them both on the seat again, Steve huffed in annoyance. He pushed himself up on one elbow and manhandled Tony until he was flat on his back with his knees up and Steve between them, hovering over him, smiling a pleased little smile. I reminded Tony of the night Steve had come home with him and stayed. Then as now Steve lowered his head and Tony’s came up to meet him for another kiss. As Steve bit gently at his lower lip, Tony deftly unbuttoned Steve’s shirt and loosened his tie. Thankfully he wasn’t wearing an undershirt, which made no sense in February, but Tony was grateful nonetheless as he slid the backs of his hand up and down the man’s abs. Then he took the opportunity to pull Steve’s shirt out of his trousers altogether and slide his hands around under the waistband touching the globes of his ass with his fingertips. Steve groaned and pushed his hips down against Tony’s and, whoa, that wasn’t going to end without a mess. He managed to pull himself away far enough to pant:
please."
He slowed and came to a standstill before he was even halfway down, though. The last few months had been exhausting. He had felt like a rope that was being used for tug of war. Or like a piece of taffy being pulled in two directions. And the pulling had stopped, but like the taffy, he had been left strung out and saggy in the middle. Then he knew he wasn't ready. He couldn't go and get in that car and join the Avengers. Yes, he'd wanted to and maybe he'd want to again, but right now he wanted to just.... disappear. Lay low, lick his wounds, whatever. With a sense of wonder he realized he could. He was a free man. He could do whatever the hell he wanted.
Tony frowned at him. "JARVIS, back to
“Too bad we aren't really married,” he called back at Steve, “You could cover me with blankets whenever I fall asleep, and make me coffee every morning, and on nice days like this you could fuck me over the railing here.” He heard a clatter inside the cabin and a mutter that could possibly the first curse word he'd heard Steve say. Shitshitshit, not enough sleep. Not enough coffee. Not enough brain cells firing to remember that Steve hadn't been exactly thrilled about the pretend gay married thing.
Tony made a face. "Fuck them and their competitive patriotism. If it weren't my best friend going into battle in this thing, I'd have had it shooting Twizzlers months ago. They can shove their superior flag waving up their collective asses as far as I am concerned."
"What did you do when the black horse ran away with you?"
Tony was silent. He hugged his knees and looked out the window, wondering how the hell they had gone from last night to ending up here.
"This is not the way we came," objected Dane.
"Don't pick your nose if you have a hook for a hand."
“Tony.” It sounded like a plea.
“Okay, maybe I am a little miserable.”
Steve didn’t say anything. Tony couldn’t see his face, but under the sheet that was thrown around his neck, Steve’s clenched his hands into fists. The question seemed innocuous to Tony, but obviously it wasn’t for Steve.
The green flicker resolved into a ring of green fire somewhere on top of a hill, or building of some sort. And then all of a sudden it wasn't just a ring, it was an eye. It was the wrong color, but there was no mistaking it. It was the Eye of Sauron, exactly like in the Lord of the Rings movies he'd watched with the team. Galloping your horse in the dark was a stupid thing to do, Steve knew. It could so easily trip or step in a hole and break a leg and Steve could break his neck, but he couldn't bear going any slower now that he was one hundred percent sure he'd find Tony somewhere near that eerie big green eye. Percival was shouting at him as he fell behind, but Steve didn't stop. Percival would catch up and Steve wouldn't even particularly care if he didn't.
“Your condition?”
“Honestly, Tony. You're running out of time. Just because I broke up with you, doesn't mean I am not still your CEO. I expect you back here in two months with Steve and that orb, or there will be dire consequences. I mean it!” She even stamped her foot. The tingling was spreading to Tony's legs and his anger was replaced by apprehension. He hated going blindly into the unknown. He hoped to god there weren't going to be any Chitauri ships waiting for him wherever the hell he was going.
“Fury...” Tony mimicked the exasperated tone of the SHIELD director's voice. “Really. No. Actually, let me rephrase that: Fuck, no! Come on! It makes no sense whatsoever to send me on an undercover assignment and you know it. Unless you
So Tony marched back into the hearing room and bickered with Justin Hammer and an exasperated Rhodey and called a bunch of senators 'assclowns', and then he marched back out with Steve at his left shoulder. Less than two inches away from it, in fact. But that surely had nothing to do with the fact that Tony felt like high fiving everybody he met on the way out.
Elayne did the little shriek that JARVIS had wisely omitted, when he had finally gotten around to translating. She scrambled back a little on the table.
He looked around at the sea of faces. They were focused on Tony, kind of, but not really. He wondered if Pepper had let it be known that Steve would be here. They looked at him as if he was just the appetizer, pleasing enough, but they were saving their hunger for the main course. It wouldn’t matter what he said, how he told them, they were going to want to hear it from the horse’s mouth. So he told them a nice sanitary version of how he’d acquired Steve, and didn’t even bother embellishing anything. Then, before the questioning could begin, Pepper introduced Steve and everybody forgot Tony was even there. Hell, even Tony forgot where he was for a moment.
,” was Harry’s reply.
?” He laced that sentence heavily with sarcasm. “It was just a fuck, asshole. I’m not a swooning maiden.”
"I'll have you know I was very restrained with that purchase. I was very tempted to get you a pink one. I remember you looking lovely in pink." Steve spluttered and Tony started singing.
Steve turned to Draco.
Tony beamed. There, already worth it.
“Not a whole lot of experience with this situation, but yeah, I think so. It comes and goes. It's more intense now, but not more frequent. I can manage. Just need to rest now, I suppose.”
“YOUR MEN WILL DELIVER FOOD AND DRINK EVERY WEEK. UNSPOILT. AND DO NOT BE SKIMPY.”
“As a kneazle in a knot, then.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“Your robes are brilliant! Especially in combination with Tony’s! I always knew that boy was listening, even though Harry said I was boring him to death with my dressing advice. Anyway. Your robes are so traditional, just on the right side of stuffy, in fact, that they completely belie the fact that you’re muggleborn. You’re challenging everyone’s preconception that the muggleborn never become true wizards because they weren’t raised in the tradition. Now, the way you were next in the receiving line to Tony, who is wearing something so flaunting tradition, it’s like you’re saying ‘Don’t worry, I’ve got him in hand if he goes over the line.’ The fact that Thistlethwaite was Tony’s father’s tailor adds something to that, that either just plain reinforces the previous sentiment, or that add something vaguely salacious to the mix, I haven’t decided yet.”
"That is Captain Rogers, sir. I thought you'd want to know."
“Make it a feather!” he yelled.
That was news to Steve. But since it seemed to pacify Percival somewhat, he didn't argue. The important thing now was to get Tony out of the open, into the castle and out of the armor. He followed Elaine through the gate.
Tony’s stomach plummeted. He cursed himself for not expecting this, for being taken unaware. But fuck, last night had been- You know, not something he would run away from. And he couldn’t help being a little hurt and more than a little pissed at Steve that he would.
In the dining hall that Tony had appropriated as workshop, he perfected his Grail spiel with the help of JARVIS. They managed to create a passable illusion of something ethereal and glowing by messing with the hand repulsors a bit and angling them just so. The lack of appropriate tools was maddening. He always had a few specialized items stashed in the armor that he had used for this project, but unless he planned on kidnapping a blacksmith and his entire forge he was shit out of luck when it came to more tools.
"It's likely that we'll be seated with our contacts tonight," Steve said, voice cool and professional, "That's how I would have set it up if I were part of Hydra. If it is a different man, do we assume that the Middle Eastern is a hostile?"
“Well, they're going to expect you to do the talking,” said Steve, “But I think it's important that, whatever happens, we don't let them separate us. They may want to offer you something in return for information, but they may also be willing to kidnap me to force you to give it up. Or kidnap you to make you work for them. Or they may not want anything at all and just want to make sure our side doesn't have access to this information.” He paused for a second. “In that case they would probably try to kill you to shut Porter up. And then they might not even make contact first, but just get rid of you when the opportunity presents itself. Whatever we do, we need to do together, to keep that from happening.”
“Nah, at least my memories are consistent again. Consistency is good. There is much to say for consistency. Can we talk about something else now?”
"Steve likes it." And that, as everybody should know by now, should be that.
of Steve, and he was just about to slip him some tongue, when Rhodey coughed politely behind him. Steve pulled back with alacrity and Tony stomped down on the urge to pout. He ran his hand through his hair instead.
"No. I am not taking your jacket, you chivalrous idiot. Let's just go. We'll be home in no time." Steve looked dubious.
"Done, Captain Rogers." Tony suspected JARVIS had a crush on Steve too, judging by his eagerness to please.
“How's the game?”
Tony held his gaze through the last lines, concern written on his face. And Steve was reminded of how in a few days Tony would be gone too. He'd join the hordes of people that were no longer part of Steve's life. Steve was fairly sure that this loss would feel sharp and raw for a long, long time to come. He imagined the months ahead without Tony's acerbic running commentary, his flashes of brilliance, the soft look on his face when he thought Steve wasn't looking, and he came up empty and hollow. A couple of tears slid down Steve's cheeks just as the song ended.
“Tell me to stop, Steve, and I'll stop.”
Horror washes over Steve as his brain comes back online with a clarity he hasn't felt in years. What the hell has he just allowed to happen? What the fuck is he doing? In his mother's house! With a stranger! A goat herd. And what the fuck does it matter? His mother is
“That is the scary part, Tony. If I get used to that again, then I don’t know how to reconcile that with the other parts of my life. I gotta be… numb, to live my life. If I’m not just focusing on surviving, then I have to deal with the things I’m doing to survive. And with the why of it. And I can’t. I don’t think I can.”
"Move him back here." Natasha wasn't falling for it either. Loki made a dramatically sad face.
"That seems a bit mistrustful."
“Ok, so next....” Natasha started as they were all standing outside the skating rink, Tony wobbling a little trying to get used to not having two millimeters of metal strapped under his feet.
"I... uh...." Steve's embarrassment was evident. "I was angry with myself for letting you distract me and it was easier to be angry at you, I guess. But then I realized it was my problem, really. You are so good at playing Corbin and here I am, completely useless at this. I don't know how to act, I don't know what to do. Even when you tell me specifically what I need to do, I muck it up and lose sight of the one person I am supposed to keep an eye on.” He ran a hand through his hair. “I know this probably sounds ridiculous, Tony, but I am so much better at just beating up the bad guys. I'd gladly infiltrate a Hydra facility, or rescue prisoners or anything else, really. But I'm going to do better. I am going man up and be more professional."
“Jarvis?” Tony rubbed his head, spreading a cloud of glitter all over Bucky’s bed.
What now? Conjure up a blanket and let Tony sleep here? By himself? That didn’t feel right. Okay.  Best try to get him to bed then.
to find Tony. Tony was his ticket out, after all.
Steve resisted the urge to do something stupid, like take his gauntlet off and caress Tony's hair. Or kiss the top of his head. He couldn't stop himself from holding on a little tighter in response, though.
Steve hadn’t gone five steps though, before he called after him:
your hips." And he forcibly started moving Steve's hips in a truly indecent fashion, while crowding against his back. Steve felt his cheeks flame. Tony seemed to be trying very hard not to laugh without a whole lot of success and that made it even worse. Steve pulled him closer to shut him up, but that ended up with Steve being sandwiched between the two men, all three of them rolling their hips in unison. Steve had never before experienced this particularly painful combination of embarrassment and arousal. He willed himself not to get hard, but it was a losing battle with the four hands on him and the rocking pressure against his ass in back and his dick in front. Tony was going to notice any minute now. Holy mother of god, what was he going to
"It's only a country because France hasn't bothered to pick its nose and swallow the booger. That, and they hold a Grand Prix in the middle of the city."
“Couldn't sleep?”
“Enough talking for one day. Let's not go crazy with this communication shit all of a sudden.”
"No, no, never mind! Keep going with the baked narcissism."
. Seriously? You must be the only person on the planet who hasn't seen that movie!"
"Tony!" Steve pleaded.
"Oh fuck, you're all waxed," Tony groaned and planted his face in the crook of Steve's hip, where his beard made super sensitized nerves fire all over the place. He felt Tony inhale deeply and then the heat of his tongue as it licked a stripe up Steve's cock. When Tony's mouth swallowed him whole, Steve shouted something inarticulate. Never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined anything feeling as good as the combination of suction, heat, moisture and the pressure of Tony's tongue as it flicked against his frenulum. Holy mother of god, this would be over in moments. And that was... unacceptable.
Too bad Steve’s jumper really needed to go in the laundry after that.
"JARVIS, get the door." It swooshed open. As he went to go in, he added, loud enough for her and anyone else inside to hear:
like it was alive. And it sure is dead now!”
The armor's voice boomed over the crowd instead in unadulterated twenty first century American.
Steve pondered this and then conceded the point. "If they want to talk they can find us on the boat easily, nothing good can come from meeting them off the boat."
When they arrived Stark chose a terminal in the corner and told Steve to block him from sight.
“Stop trying to break my shins then!”
Steve nodded gravely. He had moved a little closer and now they were only a few feet apart.
Steve looked up at Tony, his face more closed off than Tony had seen it before.
Tony Stark.... Now there was a conundrum. He was Howard's son, no doubt about it. There was a physical resemblance of course, but also a shared devil-may-care attitude. Although Tony seemed harder somehow, as if he was used to not being liked, while Howard had been big on bluster and charm to appeal to people and get his way. For a moment Steve had feared Stark would recognize him from old pictures that Howard was bound to have had, but either Howard had never shown them to him or Stark had brushed off any resemblance to a man considered dead for 70 years as a coincidence. So far, Stark had mostly ignored him, spending the flight to Marseille immersed in Porter's papers and swearing at either his lot in life or Porter's questionable skills, Steve wasn't quite sure. There had also been some bitching about having to take a commercial flight, although he had been charming and nice to the flight attendants. Steve really couldn't see what could possibly be wrong with flying first class, himself. He'd had trouble not staring like a yokel at the insane luxury on board.
Judging by the litany of curses behind Steve, Tony is having his own somewhat religious experience. He pulls back slowly, then snaps his hips forward again, causing Steve to gasp again and almost lose his balance. He braces himself and takes it, every pounding thrust a small epiphany of how utterly lost he's been. It goes from amazing to astounding to too much. Too close, too scary, he feels too vulnerable. And
“Arm candy,” Tony supplied helpfully, with only the tiniest bit of leering.
The next thing Tony noticed was that he was being divested from his shirt. He obediently lifted his arms and was rewarded by Steve’s hands roaming up and down his torso, goosebumps trailing in their wake. He tugged at Steve’s shirt again, feeling impatient, but having lost the coordination to effectively do anything about it. Thankfully, Steve took pity on him and reached behind his back with one hand and pulled the shirt off in one fluid motion. Wow. That would never not be sexy. Same for Steve’s torso. His lack of body fat sharply delineated every single muscle, and Tony felt a little inadequate in comparison. Not that Steve agreed, by the way he touched Tony almost reverently.
Silence was probably a better answer than "yes".
? You're such a brick shithouse, Rogers.”
“Ah, fuck! Already?” Tony threw himself backwards across Steve’s legs, his arms flopping overhead. His nightshirt rid up to show a sliver of skin.
A month passed in a blur of writing and editing. Then Clint called. Tony considered not picking up because he had the perfect underhanded insult, masquerading as a reference on the tip of his pen, but Clint started yelling on the answering machine, making all kinds of dire threats if he wouldn’t pick up, so he did.
"Shows how much you know, Stark." Clint dove into the fridge and pulled out another bottle, condensation running down its side. "Tripel Ale is best with gingerbread. Belgian White Beer with sugar cookies. But white beer is better in summer. Which is not now." He slapped Tony's hand, which had been reaching for one of the still warm gingerbread men. "You get one cookie for every ten you decorate." He jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the kitchen table, where Tony spotted Steve and Natasha hard at work. Steve had the tip of his tongue stuck out in concentration. Tony gritted his teeth and looked determinedly away.
"Sir Tristan, Sir Stephen, you have returned! You have just missed the most wondrous visitation. There was a chalice filled with wondrous light. It was shown to us by a vile demon who challenged the noblest and most virtuous of knights to come and find it." Before he could elaborate further, though, his eye fell on Galahad's litter as the party made its way into room and he paused.
In retrospect, it had been in no way necessary to use his whole hand. Or even his fingers, for that matter. JARVIS was perfectly capable of monitoring anything remotely.
“Are you here to conquer England?”
“No, the kittens. I named them Clint and Tasha.”
"Thor has....
Tony sprawled a little more pointedly in his chair and rolled his eyes. “Seriously, you guys need to expand your cyberspace horizons. Let me know when you're ready to move on from MySpace, we can start a support group for you.”
"Please. Have you
"Six senior citizens with Hawaiian shirts and John Deere ball caps?" Steve followed his gaze.
Tony scrambled to his knees and started putting the cooled off charcoal in a pouch.
The next morning the two of them set off for the witches' castle. It was twilight on the second day of travel and they'd just decided to make camp, when Steve spotted a green flicker of light against the darkening sky in the east. It was too far to tell what it was, but a sudden clench in his gut told him this was it. This was where Tony was. He nixed any further discussions of camping and told Percival flat out they were pushing on.
“That was a very manly reaction, Bubbles. Remind me to tell Rhodes all about that.”
The guy who blushed when he kissed Tony on the cheek in public, and when discussing chaps. Steve was likely to be on the verge of spontaneously combusting right now. He quickly looked aside at him. He looked... stunned. And very red, indeed, even in the dark. He wondered if he should take Steve's hand to reassure him, but was not sure at all about how he'd react to any physical contact at this point. That might be the spark to light the fuse. Better not. He looked at Yamilla who was looking at them beatifically, seemingly completely unaware of what was going on at their table. Right. Fuck this shit. What the hell had he done to deserve getting stuck on a fucking boat with kinky Frenchmen and an overgrown boyscout, and having to pretend to be all lovey dovey with the latter? Steve had conveniently gone mute too. He turned back to Abdel.
“Yeah, because we weren’t oblivious at
"Not Howard. I'm Tony... " He paused before he added: "Howard was my father."
hit on women too.”
He sighed. "Right. So I can't see anything and you can't sense anything... I guess we wait for daylight."
“They say ‘I don’t deserve him, but the boy who lived married me anyway, so you can keep your opinion of former Death Eaters to yourself’.”
"True. True. I hope they are in Tuscany, or somewhere else pretty."
“Hey, Tony. How is life with the cats?”
"Oh, he does. It'll be fine. Stark won't go haring off on stupidly dangerous quests anymore now that he knows that Cap will just plunge in right after him and possibly kill himself doing so. And Cap won't be so eager to sacrifice himself knowing that Stark will be right behind him. They'll have to keep themselves safe to keep the other safe. It's a thing of beauty, really."
"I'm not taking off the armor!"
“Thanks.”
Abdel seemed slightly disconcerted. “Well of course I am hoping we will all find some degree of satisfaction, but we were not prepared to make a monetary offer. At least...at least not at this time.” He tugged on the cuffs of his tux. Tony flinched at the move, but relaxed when nothing else seemed to happen. “We do need to make sure of the utmost discretion.”
The next afternoon he was in his armor shoving the massive tables to the wall in what he assumed had been the dining hall, when he heard banging on the gate doors. Making his way to the front he could also hear the sound of metal striking metal, the restless whinnying of horses and men shouting. Sounded like he had company.
done to him, in the dark recesses of his mind.
"Nothing as Del and Corbin, sir. There is another kiss after the gelato place, in your current outfit. That one does not have your name attached, just a 'OMG! Squee! How cute!!!!!' on Tumblr" JARVIS sounded almost droll when quoting that caption, counting out the exact number of exclamation marks.
It looked like Tony flushed just a little. Steve thought he had imagined it, but the way Draco smirked, maybe he hadn’t.
, exactly?” Exasperation was bleeding through. “You'd pretend that nothing happened so that I could pretend that nothing happened and I could go back to my regular scheduled life? That I would just stop feeling the way I feel about you? You thought I wanted out? Or did you want out yourself?”
Rhodes smirked.
He never took the four kittens to the pound. First he kept telling himself that he was waiting until he’d caught the white one, who was obviously to be called Steve, but when Steve kept eluding him (of course he was, he should have called the cat Rain, or something) he kind of stopped trying to catch him. By then, though, there was no chance in hell he was giving up Brucie and Thor and the other two. They were funny and cuddly and excellent company when he felt particularly lonely. So he took them to the vet instead and had them fixed and vaccinated and dewormed and bought a couple more cat boxes. They were kind enough at the vet’s to give him a payment plan.
“And a good lay.”
“What?” echoed Bruce from the kitchen.
“That’s life for you. An infinite variety of ways to fuck things up.” Tony yawned again. “I think I need to go to bed before I fall asleep here and fuck up my neck and back.” Steve made to sit up with alacrity, but Tony put his hand on his arm and stopped him.
“You see a lot of guys fighting imaginary things in a wall?”
"Who didn't? Fury asked me if I was 'planning to continue to bone Stark' and I didn't say anything, but I -"
"Sure, they are not going kill us or anything. They are just going be silently disapproving of our 'lifestyle choices', or not so silently, if we get lucky. They are not going to like you."
hand?!" Tony sounded outraged, but in a breathless kind of way that meant that he really wasn't expecting an answer. Steve kissed him some more to shut him up and Tony seemed to be on board with that. Also with the hip grinding. Steve thought he'd could more than likely get off like this, but that wasn't what he wanted. He didn't know what he wanted.
"Oh. My.
"It was not I who judged him. It was God who favored my sword and therefore my words. God made it clear I was in the right."
"It's a deal then. But first, there needs to be mulled mead and singing."
He made himself go through tactical exercises in head, while he stubbornly kept his gaze on the candle on the table. He was annoyed with himself at how often his mind wandered to the man sleeping on his shoulder even when he wasn't looking at him and as he got more sleepy he had wrench himself away from the that kissing fantasy a couple of times. But he didn't push Tony off.
“I guess,” Tony wondered where their mother was. If they still had one. “I guess I better get something to clean them up with, and something we can use as a litter box.” He left Steve with the kittens and went back to the the kitchen. Bruce had left and it was empty. He got some paper towels and then decided on confiscating the plastic tub they had in the sink for washing the dishes. It was pretty beat up anyway and he’d be able to get a new one for a couple of guilders at Blokker on Monday. Then he checked his pantry shelf. He had the half loaf he’d purchased this morning to get him through the weekend. It wouldn’t last if he shared, but he still had some bread that was a couple of days old. He could always toast that.
"He's scared," sneered the other one.
“Oh my god! He was... ew! Gross hair and a gross beard and wearing these filthy rags and he looked emaciated. No way was I going to let him in!”
"You want me to come inside?" Incredulity drips from every syllable.
was a mistake.” He put on the other boot and started lacing that one.
"You picked up on that, huh? Tony Stark: vigilante, loose cannon, and potential renegade. I wonder why they were so eager to paint me as more patriotic than you?"
"You know, this clamming up thing is very unattractive. I already know you're a bit of drama queen inside your head, Steve, you don't have to be so stoic about it."
“Yeah. I need to figure out what I’m doing with my dad’s company. Shit or get off the pot. It’s like I’ve suddenly realized I’m in limbo until I figure out what to do with it and it doesn’t feel good. And I can’t figure it out here.”
“No, he hasn’t.” Bucky turned his head towards the front of the room again, signaling the end of their tete-a-tete.
"Probably a combination of salt water and hay mites. Possibly bedbugs. I can get rid of the salt water if you want."
Steve shot a glance up at Tony’s face.”
“I'm sorry I am such a screw up.” Steve looked mournful.
“You think sex is going to fix this?”
Tony got back to his redesign of the thrusters, but he'd lost the flow somehow. Something wasn't adding up in one of the circuit designs but he couldn't pin down what it was. He'd been staring at the damn thing for minutes, but it kept eluding him. He tapped his lip with his index finger.
“What? Steve, no! You don’t need to do this. We can hide you longer, for as long as you need. New identity, private island, it’s not hard… I could come visit?” Tony hated how small his voice sounded at the end of that, because Steve’s face rejected the offer before he even spoke.
“Tony… I…”
“Alright, I’ll hire you. You gonna charge me an arm and a leg?”
"Steve." said another voice and Tony's head jerked up so fast he hit it on a piece of metal and the delicate bit of wiring he'd been trying to get just right melted into metallic goo. Rubbing his head he backed out on his knees from under the hulking piece of machinery. "JARVIS, you traitor! You and your fucking crush on Rogers."
at me.” He spread his arms in invitation. “I have no armor, I have no weapons, I have no superpowers. I have no JARVIS even and no fortune. All I have right now are my brain and my middle aged body, that hates me in the morning after sleeping on the ground all night. That, and a failing arc reactor, that is all I have. You know how fucking powerless I feel right now? Almost as powerless as I did in that fucking Afghan cave, almost as powerless as I did when Stane took the reactor out of my chest. Almost as powerless as I did when I thought I was dying of palladium poisoning. There you have it, the three low points of my adult life. And if there is anything I can do to avoid feeling like that ever again, you better believe I am going to do it.”
Tony was starting to have a bad feeling about this and now he wished they had suggested an alternate location for this meeting, somewhere a lot less dark. He looked at Steve, who was also frowning as if he thought something wasn't adding up. Abdel was taking a long time in trying to formulate what he was going to say, and Tony was getting irritated.
“I… don’t know.”
“Hey, Tony!” Clint called out when Tony’d clambered up the ladder-like steps to their floor. “Where you been, man? The fridge is fried. Can you fix it before my beer gets warm?”
Clint huffed in annoyance, but wisely shut up.
"I think the man is right. The fact that Bucky's a managed to hold onto even a shred of humanity after all that's been done to him tells me he's a stubborn motherfucker. If he doesn't want be social right now, he's not going to be social. Let's keep an eye out for signs that he does, though, and be ready to go then."
"I don't care what you do. As long as it involves you naked and my dick, I'm good." He paused, obviously trying to gather his wits. "Bed. We should move to the bed." That Steve could do. He carried Tony across the cabin, ignoring the man beating him on the shoulder demanding to be set down, and tossed him on the bed. He started pulling his clothes off but Tony stopped him.
He tilted his face up towards Steve, who took the hint like the smart man he was, and kissed him sweet and slow. There was no urgency in the kiss, just something indescribably tender and Tony's heart ached with it. He wrapped one arm around Steve's neck and drunk in the other man's proximity with all of his senses.
He was right about the rocks. In the end, he had to follow the coast for another half a mile or so before he spotted a small stony beach that would allow them to make landfall. Dragging both of them through the pounding surf that did its best to pull them back out to sea was the hardest thing he'd done that day. Considering the swim he just completed and the serpent he'd fought, that was a fitting testimony to his exhaustion. When they'd made it, he lay gasping in the evening light, grateful for every rock that was stabbing him in the back, but he only allowed himself a brief minute. As soon as he'd caught his breath he rolled over and frantically sought for Tony's pulse. His skin was cold as death. God, let him be alive. He needed Tony to be alive...
Tony cracked up.
Clint fled.
They tried, but it was no use, the guy had vanished in the crowds.
"Natasha. Natalie. Brigitte. Which one of your names should I use? You have so many more than I ever knew. Good to see you, by the way."
Anyway, that is how Tony ended up just inches away, his hand cupping Cap's jaw, as if he were the prince who had just kissed Sleeping Beauty awake, when Steve opened his eyes.
It was the most Tony had said to him in three days. Steve didn't know if he was grateful the man was trying connect again, if only to get a rise out of him, or annoyed that he just couldn't let things be.
"Totally,
Steve lifted his eyes from the fire for a second.
Before Percival could answer a white boat came sailing up out of nowhere, with a white hermit on board who hailed them.
Three weeks later, Tony had moved into a spacious and sunny apartment on the southern edge of town. It even had a tiny walled garden, so he installed a cat flap and didn’t have to worry about cat boxes any more. Except that it took about a week for Brucie to figure out how it worked, while Tony shoved him back and forth through the thing several times a day. After that, though, things were fine.
"Thanks for letting me stay," Steve said earnestly, as he held Tony's hand in a firm grip.
He turned to Steve.
Steve was still yelling, but Tony looked over at his team mates. Former team mates. Maybe. Natasha was sitting on one of the benches on the promenade, flanked by Clint and Bruce. Thor was standing behind the bench with his hands on the back rest. They were all staring at Tony and Steve as if they were fascinating zoo specimens.
With that he shook off Steve's hand and kicked his horse in the flank. He was out of sight in minutes, his squire barely able to keep up.
that he didn't question it. He had two more days with Steve. Two days, three nights and that should suffice. Better make the most of it and have
"That one is going to be mine already, little man. You are too weak to carry him out of here. I can sense it. So he will die and be mine."
It was the sound of scraping that woke Steve up. He'd only been asleep for a couple of hours, he could tell by his internal clock, so that meant it was still Tony's watch. When he opened his eyes he could see the other man seated by the fire with a branch and a knife in his hands. He was scraping something off the branch into the earthenware bowl he had picked up in the village with the haunted church. Then he held the branch up to his face and Steve could see it was blackened on the scraped end. The branch went back into the fire and Tony pulled out another branch with one of his Iron Man gauntlets. He peered pensively at the branch until the embers had died down and then he shook off the ash before he started scraping the charred edges into the bowl. Steve pushed himself up on one elbow.
"I think you're right." Tony inspected a large staple he was modifying. "I think the only time we're going to see them is when they are going to try to take us out."
"But Tony, what? You don't believe the All American Hero would stoop to fucking me?" He really tried not to sound bitter, but that might not have been completely successful.
"I don't think it will, Steve. I would almost rather face Hydra, to be honest."
Moonlight Tony stares at him for endless seconds. Then he leans in a little.
"My snit is anything but little."
. All of a sudden Steve was there in his path and Tony almost ran into him, because he had been staring at the floor while he paced. Steve placed both his hands on Tony's face and forced him to look up. He was looking exasperated. Not good.
"Can we stop now? I can't feel my legs and I am quite done being the swooning princess," he bitched purely on principle. Steve smirked. An honest to god smirk on Captain America's face. It seemed a bit unpatriotic, somehow.
Steve swallowed hard and fought down his blush. Tony went on, relentlessly.
Gawaine was happy enough to lose him and the challenge Steve posed to his self appointed leadership. And Steve was happy enough to let the man go and make a nuisance of himself elsewhere.
“Sorry. That's not our problem. Have a good evening.” Tony kept his voice deadly polite. He tugged Steve along.
Steve lost the smile.
Steve nodded in acknowledgment, but wisely decided not to pursue that line of questioning. He turned towards his companion, who was watching Tony with amused fascination.
Steve's answering grin was blinding. "Sure thing." He kissed Tony quickly. "Your room, or mine?"
," he said with an exaggerated British accent.
get old."
If they didn’t give him the death sentence. That was a possibility when you went AWOL during war time. Still…
“Steve...” Tony whispered and Steve didn't know if that meant 'stop' or 'please'. Tony might not know either. Comfort, Steve thought, just a little comfort in the middle of the night, in a strange country, in a strange time, after a long and harrowing day.
"No." Tony’s voice was muffled, weak.
"JARVIS! Make it so the fucker in the chopper can hear me!"
"Yeah, you seemed to like that and -" Steve's breath hitched as Tony latched on to the little barbel, sucking it and flicking it at the same time. "And I like it too." Steve was breathing hard by the time Tony finally let go.
“You don’t owe me shit, Steve. And I didn’t hire him for your sake. I hired him for mine.”
“Yeah. Probably not.”
He was being a selfish bastard, he knew that. He was going to die and he should let Steve keep his distance, but he couldn't make himself actually do it. It was impossible to be that altruistic while in the process of being kissed by the man he'd been lusting after for weeks. Nothing flew as blatantly in the face of death as sex. It was a shitty thing to do to Steve, but Tony wanted more, he needed more. He needed Steve to want him like he wanted Steve.
Oh hell yes, Steve knew it. It had been wildly popular with the troops in Europe during the war, reminding the soldiers of the loved ones they left behind on one hand and of all the wonderful everyday little things they were fighting to keep, on the other. Without fail, it'd make one of the guys choke up with homesickness. No matter how badly one wanted to fight the Nazis, everyone had days when missing your loved ones just seemed too much to bear.
“Twilight is a most popular tale among the people of Midgard!” Thor defended himself. He looked at Natasha for support. “It has mighty wolf men warriors and dazzling undead! It has epic battles and....”, but Natasha wasn't listening, her focus on Tony.
"That is a statement you had better address with your therapist, Mr Stark. But as far as the limited circumstances of this trial are concerned, it is a valid notion. This case is going to be interesting, but tough. Do not undermine my work." Elisa was ruthless and never minced words and normally that was something Tony loved about her, but right now he was feeling a little fragile. He sighed and tried to reconcile himself with not seeing or talking to Steve for months. It felt like someone had dimmed the lights outside.
“True,” Wanda agrees, following after him. “Morgan’s grown so much since I last saw her, I almost don’t recognize her.” she says fondly.
Steve doesn't go with them, instead waits at SHIELD headquarters with Director Fury and Agent Hill, and listens to the battle through the comms, since SHIELD agents are working together with the Avengers on this one.
The man laughs quietly, the sound as warm and alive as the rest of him but then pauses as he registers that Steve is genuinely confused. His face is rapidly descending into worry as his eyes flick over Steve’s face, takes in the blank expression, the vacant stare.
. She seems happy though, truly happy in the first time in almost five years. It’s a good look on her.
Y'all know I had to add in a DC reference because I'm honestly trash for both. Thank you all for reading! As always, comments literally give me life. :))))
“Are you whispering sweet nothings into a coffee cup?”
He probably looks like a disgusting mess himself, because Steve knows for a fact that he's not an attractive crier, but he laughs wetly, sniffs. "Well," he says, voice a croak, "You know me. I live for the drama." He wipes clumsily at his eyes, sinks down a bit to sit on the floor, but then Tony walks forward.
Peter had been the first to dash off, citing he has homework, although Steve kind of suspects it’s just an excuse to escape the rest of the Avenger’s collective mother-henning. Bucky and Sam left a couple of minutes after to get prepared to leave for his mission, Sam picking up the “you need backup” argument where he left off, and Harley had mentioned promising to help out a friend with a school project.
“Alright, I’m going to ignore that considering how exhausted you are.” She says with a roll of her eyes. “I’m just notifying you that your driver Happy has arrived. He’s waiting at the front for you and the rest of your team.”
He comes into awareness in slow increments, registers the sound of soft even breaths and warm sheets against his skin. He blinks open his eyes to see the ceiling of his room, unadorned with ice for the first time in a long while.
Peter doesn’t answer at first, still concentrating on the writing and finally sighs, setting down his pencil in defeat.
“You’re telling me this, why?” Steve interrupts to ask dryly, a smile curling his lips when Tony rolls his eyes, flicks Steve’s cheek in reprimand.
Tony grabs Steve’s hand and intertwines it with his, their rings glinting, and plants a kiss on Steve’s knuckles. They had discussed keeping the rings from their previous marriages on as well, but decided in the end to wear them on a chain around their necks as a reminder of what had passed.
Pepper makes a sound of agreement. “Good call.”
I’m gonna
Tony means…
They sat in silence for a second, staring at each other worriedly while Tony looked on, thoroughly amused.
“Just shock.” Steve returns, flatly, gives him a bland smile. “I’m sorry if seeing the Iron Man armour threw me for a loop, since said owner of the armour is
“Do I need to go fetch the ‘Get Along’ shirt again?” Steve interrupts amusedly, and both Sam and Bucky’s heads snap over to look at Steve in comical synchronized horror.
And if Tony can’t help smiling a bit to himself as he’s helped onto the quinjet by a ranting Tara, or punched in the arm by Clint as he settles into his seat or fussed over by Steve, well. That’s nobody’s business but his.
“Pretty well, considering our fearless leader retired,” Sam says, stopping his poking of Bucky’s shoulder and giving Steve a dry look. Steve shrugs in response, innocent smile plastered on his face.
“Steve?”
Steve doesn’t know how to react to this information. The fact that Tony apparently created an AI of himself before he died, because what other logical explanation is there, because this can’t actually be Tony can it, and who else could have
“Tony.” he whispers, and thinks
“And until then? What do we do?”
, and he’s glad Tony showed up in time, but thinking about him using the armour just opens up an entirely new can of worms.
True to his word, Tony stays with Steve in the Winter Palace.
“Access denied.”
She gives him an unimpressed look but reluctantly nods. “Yes, I suppose you’re done. First post tomorrow morning. You are severely behind schedule.”
“You can say that again,” Clint snorts, leaning back against Natasha. There are choruses of tired agreement from around the room.
Steve breaks himself off with an oof as one of his opponents manages to get a good kick in.
“Anytime at all, kid.” Tony says quietly, voice unbearably gentle, and Peter goes back to flipping through his textbook, happy grin plastered on his face.
Tony blinks up from his piles of paperwork to look at the door as it bursts open to admit a harrowed looking Rhodey, eyes scanning the room frantically.
“Oh shush you horrible person.” Steve obviously can’t see her, but he has a feeling she just stuck her tongue out at the phone.
It’s been about five days after the little incident, and as predicted, Steve’s burns have healed up nicely, leaving behind pink and unblemished skin. The last few days have been rather uneventful, Steve taken off from his usual duties in running training and instead being fussed over by everyone. Now he knows how Peter felt, going a little bit stir crazy. The only really exciting thing that had happened was that Thor had finally called them back, able to now get reception from wherever in the universe he’s calling from.
"Rude."
“Is there any particular reason we’re starting right from the beginning again?” Wanda asks after the first ten minutes of the episode.
Wanda hums in vague agreement, turning to grab some glasses for drinks and bustling out of the kitchen, trailing magic-infused floating cups when there proves to be too much for her to carry in her arms.
you shouldn’t have. I’m more of a Diego guy though.”
“Yes.” Steve’s barely out of breath, even as he flips two of the people he’s fighting into a wall. The serum is a miracle worker. “I’m asking you to come in as Iron Man if we need it. How long would it theoretically take for you to get here?”
“But what about Jarvis? Friday?” Sam asks, frowning. “They seemed pretty damn human to me.” but Bruce shakes his head.
“How so?” Ned asks, seemingly over his momentary embarrassment. Steve shrugs, “Couldn’t keep a straight face.” he says simply, “did you guys see the one about a hot lunch? God, the director looked like he wanted to punch me by the end because I
Sam let's out a laugh. “I remember you guys. I wasn't in your division, but man did you give those security guys trouble.”
“Well until you do Mr. Stark, you’re just gonna have to stick with using these ones.”
you.”
Steve gasps in surprise as Tony burrows further into him, face planted in Steve’s neck because his skin is cold, and Tony is so warm and so alive in his arms, but maybe not-not for much longer.
They go back to more lighthearted topics after that, which manages to distract Steve until Harley yells up the stairs at him to “get his ass downstairs and eat some food”. Steve says a hasty goodbye to the sound of Pepper laughing at him over the phone and hangs up to head downstairs before Harley starts yelling again.
"Don't let her catch you calling her that, Tones." Rhodey laughs, leaning back against the door frame despite the fact that he appeared to be in a rush two seconds ago. "Or better yet, do. And let me watch the reaction."
“Did you just
Tony sniffed at Steve’s disapproving look. “She’s a hag.” Tony said loftily.
Steve snorts and helps Peter turn to a page in the notebook that isn’t covered with misshapen scribbles.
“Tony?”
Bucky calls forward another person from beside him. Steve nods in thanks and turns to the next.
He squeezes Steve’s hand back, linking their fingers. When Natasha returns with the ice cream, raising a perfectly shaped eyebrow at the hand-holding and Steve’s small smile, Tony shrugs and doesn’t let go.
” Steve interrupts with an unconvinced hum as he dodges a kick from his opponent.
There are happy days, even though they’re rare and far between. It’s when Morgan will come up to him and ask for stories of the Avengers, and Steve will tell her about all those adventures they used to get up to. Or when Peter and Harley visit, which is often, or the rest of the remaining and new Avengers, filling up the house with laughter, a burden shared and halved.
He watches Clint and Wanda’s conversation by the lake and he smiles a watery smile with Natasha because yeah, what they said is pretty damn accurate.
Tony hesitates, and Steve frowns in worry.
There might be something new and fragile budding there. Or it might just be close friendship.
, because literally all the places are volunteer, money is no longer a thing.
“Yes?” Tony frowns at him again.
“What happened?” Steve says, rasps really, and he realizes his voice is still hoarse. They must have done a number on him if he’s not completely healed yet.
at that apparently; yelling accusations at innocent people, that is. Clearly. You should be
Tony sticks his tongue out at the door as it closes, and then promptly levels Steve with a look, raising his eyebrows in question.
, and I started fiddling with one of human Tony’s half finished plans for the Iron Man armour, because earlier I just used one of the old models y’know, didn’t do much to change it, well other than the EMP of course, and I fiddled with some things, managed to make the thing like 10% more efficient with a few adjustments, and I know Rhodey still uses the War Machine armour and I know I’m probably shouldn’t disturb Tony’s old things because it’s not mine but if I could work on one of them to test it out I could make it so much safer-”
He goes downstairs and makes a huge breakfast, to thank Pepper, Morgan and Happy for everything they’ve done for him, for being so amazing and letting him stay. He tells them when they all sit down to eat, and there are tears, but Pepper just looks at him proudly and Happy smiles and says “it’s about time” and Morgan makes him pinky promise to visit often.
Luckily, Steve hadn't scheduled any training today, and his morning was pretty free, so he had no prior obligations to drag himself out of bed for.
“Choose a song.”
“I’ll let you two ladies talk,” he says teasingly with a smirk at Steve, who rolls his eyes in good humour. Pepper sticks her tongue out at Happy, and he laughs as he heads out the back door as well.
Tara shakes her head, trying to hide a smile. “Awww, the Avengers are protecting their tiny engineer.”
“They’ve got
Slowly, they all recover, and soon the good days start to equal and maybe even outnumber the bad.
"No. No I didn't have a point." Steve glares at Tony because he needs to get this across.
“What about it?” He whispers, slightly confused, and it’s like he can
allowed to look like that, have that sad expression, AI or otherwise, just
“Trouble? Who’s going to any trouble?” Tony grumbles in response. “It would take like max, two seconds, you realize the lab has a place where original Tony manufactured all his prototypes, this isn’t new information right, you know this?”
“Get some sleep Mr. Stark.”
to keep fighting, keep that fragile spark of hope alive in his chest. But then,
Steve is cold.
Tony’s voice is fading in and out, and Steve needs to tell him, that one last thing he needs Tony to know before he goes-
“Well have you bothered to check your phone?”
have, and his mood will dissipate like morning dew.
“I also want you all to report to medical for a checkup before you leave.” Fury continues, eliciting a variety of glares. Even Steve looks disgruntled.
“Yes, oh captain my captain?” and Steve rolls his eyes.
And here Pepper sounds a little choked up but still sets a friendly hand on Steve’s shoulder, and all at once, he’s so glad she’s here, and feels horribly guilty for it because she lost her
“Thank you Steve." He says and ok no, why is he thanking him-
The AI gives him a fake smile, maybe not an obviously fake one to others, but after years Steve can tell the difference now and he feels terrible that he put that expression there, but he can’t do anything about it, not while his muscles seem hellbent on becoming petrified rock. "I'll see you later, Steve." is all he says, and flickers out of existence.
, I’ve been ranting about
So yeah. Tony decides that social media might not be so bad. He stops viewing it as another way for the world to stare, and instead uses it to talk to interesting people halfway across the world, and keep in contact with long distance friends. It's pretty awesome actually. Tony’s not surprised, technology generally is.
“I’ve been practicing anyways with writing with my left hand, Tony, I can do it, I know I can, just watch-”
(and come shout at me on tumblr, it's the-music-maniac)
“Don’t,” Steve interrupts, and he feels something fierce well up, “
, Steve corrects in his head and then immediately feels horribly guilty, because how could he ever call him an it, it’s
“Thank you.”
He won’t. He
He hesitates, not sure if he should mention the next part. "...plus...hiding something as big as this from her, even if it's to protect her, probably wouldn't go over very well? Especially where parents are concerned." Steve gives them a wry smile. "I should know. I have...a
It’s during a moment of concentrated silence when a curious thing happens.
He lowers his arm, and goes to find Peggy. He owes her a dance.
It’s honestly very routine, and even a little tedious, since most of the hench, um people?? Hench-people sure, let’s go with that, aren’t that well trained in combat situations.
as he left and Steve can’t connect any of their conversation to it with the little information he has, so maybe it was a physical thing, and Steve doesn’t want to even consider that, but there’s still that one paranoid portion of him that’s saying over and over, entertain every theory because ‘what if’...
There are days when Steve will find Happy obsessively checking over his firearms, checking over security, checking over everything because that’s what he does, and Steve gets it, that itch underneath your skin to do something, because you couldn’t do enough before.
“I am ashamed to know you. Apple minion.” Tony wrinkles his nose at the laptop but obligingly clicks through the song choices. “I’m giving you a Stark industries laptop, this programming is so stupidly rigid.”
Afterwards Morgan shouts about going down to play at the lake, so Happy follows her as she runs out the back door.
be the best person out of all of them, and his gamble pays off when Pepper lets out a laugh.
“It’s getting worse.” Sam finally comments, quiet in his despair, and neither Natasha or Bucky voice anything in response, but their expressions say it all.
“My tertiary objective.” Tony adds in at that, and Bruce gestures as if to say
“So,” he starts hesitantly, leaning against the counter, and Pepper looks over at him curiously. “I was wandering around the compound a week ago. Came across Tony’s lab.”
“You two are something else altogether. How you guys managed to lead a highly elite team of superpowered responders is beyond me sometimes.”
"Steve! No! I got this! Don't!" But a big splash not far from him made clear that he'd shouted too late. It was hard to see in the murky water, even with the armor's sensors, but it seemed like Steve had borrowed a large knife from Widow. He was doing a decent job hacking at the tentacles, but it was never going to work, he had no hope of killing the damn thing. Tony cursed and got the repulsors aligned so that he would hit squid and not Steve and let them blast. He must have hit it in just the right spot and he'd have to replay the footage later to figure out what that was, because the thing exploded into bite size pieces. Not that Tony had any appetite left. He grabbed Steve around the waist and flew them both out of the water and back onto the promenade. He didn't even wait before the man had taken a breath before he started.
"You did. But I'd almost given up on you."
“What’s going on? Tony?”
Tony grimaced. "Corbin? Yeah. Arrogant slime ball. I should be insulted people thought I was him."
“Yeah. Rotterdam is just south of here. About 10 miles. Biggest port in the world. Not as pretty though. The Germans bombed it in World War II, so it’s much more modern.”
true, there is no hope at all of debunking it. All of a sudden we don't have a trial of American Hero versus Misguided Bureaucrats, we have a trial of That Faggot in Spandex versus American Wholesomeness. And we'll lose two thirds of the jury right then and there." Tony grimaced, but didn't say anything. "I hate to say it, Mr Stark, but with your reputation, any contact with Captain America would sully his."
“YOU WILL LEAVE ME AND MINE BE IN THIS CASTLE AS LONG AS I CARE TO OCCUPY IT.”
“Well, they should be able to eat soft foods, like canned tuna. A bowl of water. Don’t give them cow’s milk, their bowels can’t handle it. And they’ll need a litter box.”
The tree decorating segued into movie night whith all of them piled on the sectional having a lengthy argument about what modern Christmas movies Steve really had to see. They'd be there till Easter with the way everyone kept adding movies to the list, so Tony finally just told J.A.R.V.I.S. to start whatever modern Christmas movie had the highest rating on Rotten Tomatoes and
Steve has just finished putting away the groceries and has started peeling the potatoes when Tony walks in. Steve bites down on a flash of panic when Tony suddenly appears in his kitchen, even though he left the door open for that exact purpose.
He didn’t see how Tony pulled the material of the jumper up to his nose and inhaled deeply, closing his eyes.
Tony did a mock amazed face.
He was sitting on a smallish grassy island in a fairly extensive lake. There was a stone circle on the island, like a mini Stonehenge type thing, and that made it very likely he was somewhere on the British Isles. JARVIS's sensors must be malfunctioning then, there was no way there were places without satellite signals in Britain. A few rabbits were hopping along, but otherwise the island was deserted. Not even a smidgen of a sign of Steve. Figured. Things couldn't be as easy as that, of course.
.... He added a suit fetish to his list. Although it might be time to admit that the common factor in all his newly acquired fetishes, Steve-in-fatigues, Steve-in-capris, Steve-in-booty-shorts-swim-trunks, Steve-in-a-tux, was more along the line of Steve-in-anything rather than the clothing itself. He thought of Rhodey in fatigues: nothing. The thousands of men he'd seen in tuxedos: meh. And he couldn't honestly recall ever meeting men in capris before.... Steve in any of those outfits:
“What Times Magazine article?”
he hasn't come. He needs to come, teetering on the precipice for so long is fucking him up and he's afraid of what's going to happen in his brain if he doesn't get to come soon. He begs Tony to touch him, but Tony refuses.
In the middle of the honey dispensing process he noticed Steve had stopped shoveling gruel into his mouth. Because Steve was now staring at him with something very close to disbelief in his eyes.
came on and everyone shut up. Somehow Tony had ended up next to Steve and he spent most of the evening being viscerally, painfully, aware of the two inches of air between them. They talked occasionally, Tony pointing out some of the less obvious connections between the seemingly random group of people in the movie and Steve asking the odd question or two about general history. At some point, Clint on Steve's other side jostled him and Steve's knee fell against Tony's thigh. He left it there. It kept sending little jolts of electricity through Tony, but he he didn't move his leg either. He'd rather have cut off an arm.
“What do Harry’s robes say?”
“You're welcome. Now go to sleep or I am going to sing 'Let It Be' to you.”
Steve dropped down into a chair and buried his face in his hands. Tony gestured at the other chair before he flopped onto the couch. Rhodes sat gingerly and set his briefcase down next to him before he spoke.
Steve pulled over the remaining stool so he sat catty corner to Tony. Across the table was just too far away. He still felt as if Tony might disappear if he'd let him get out of arm's reach. He was sure that would pass eventually, but right now he didn't see the point in not giving in to it. Tony wasn't complaining. In fact, he scooted a little closer and peered at Steve's face intently.
with you people?" Jim hissed.
Tony chewed on that silently for a while. When he felt he was able to retort with sufficient sarcasm, he said:
“But, God, I haven’t had a decent hamburger in years.”
