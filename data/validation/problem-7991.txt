“Thank you, JARVIS.”
“Why?”
“Anthony!” Thor spoke loudly, as always, when he entered the room.
“So,” Natasha started at breakfast a few hours later, “Tony.”
“It’s a non-issue,” she quoted Tony.
“In Tony’s workshop?” Steve looked up in confusion, which he still had a habit of doing on occasion when talking to the AI.
“I just think it’s nice, you know? All of us here together. I know our lives aren’t really normal, but before…” Steve trailed off, and Tony was surprised by the serious turn the conversation took.
“Good man,” Tony grinned at him. “What kind?” he held his hand out for the cup as Steve approached, sitting on a stool on the opposite side of Tony’s work table from where he was.
“Thanks, JARVIS.” Steve turned his attention to Tony, who had rolled onto his back. Despite what JARVIS said, Steve figured he should at least move Tony onto the pillows. He scooted his body up and moved his hands off quickly in the hopes that Tony would stay asleep, which he did. Steve covered him over with the blanket and laid down, trying to slow his breathing. Tony is in my bed, Tony is in my bed, Tony is in my bed. It was all he could think about. He laid on his back staring at the ceiling, and finally began to drift off.
Steve managed to occupy his mind for a few hours with working out and cleaning, but when late afternoon hit he could find nothing to do that distracted him from his thoughts of Tony. Finally he decided to give in and headed towards the workshop, despite the fact that his better judgement told him he should let Tony work. The door opened when he approached it and he saw Tony staring intently at whatever he was working on.
“Sure, I’m sorry,” Steve responded quickly, watching Tony climb back into his bed. This was the first time Tony had done it while awake, and it made Steve’s head spin a little.
“You like every Steve,” Natasha smiled at him and Tony saw Steve’s blush grow larger, Steve purposely not meeting Tony’s glance. “I will admit, it’s nice to have someone other than Tony say snarky things,” she offered. “The snark loses its effect when it accompanies everything one says,” she looked pointedly at Tony.
“It’s kind of obvious, Tony. To everyone except Steve, that is.” So what’s the issue?”
“Steve, it’s obvious that you’re in love with him, would you just go for it?” Natasha chided, sighing at him.
“I see you’ve gone the ‘I have big muscles and a nice butt’ route with your outfit,” Steve blushed to his ears, like always.
“Guys, what Tony and I do is private, can we please not talk about it?” Steve pleaded. Tony was walking in at that exact moment.
“I’m just waiting for the right time,” Steve responded, leaning with his forearms on the counter, dropping his head.
“Stay?” Tony seemed slightly confused but took a few steps back to the bed.
“Even geniuses get lonely, Steve,” Bruce interjected, not looking up from his paper.
“Good morning, all,” he strode into the kitchen, and passed Steve, who was at the stove cooking, on his way to the coffee. He stopped next to him and put a hand on the middle of Steve’s back, and the contact made Steve shiver. “You okay?” He asked in a low voice, but apparently not low enough. Steve nodded and went back to cooking, but while Tony was pouring his cup of coffee, someone else spoke.
“Just trying to help you out, Tony,” Bruce shrugged, a small smile on his face. Steve entered just then, smiling and plopping down next to Tony.
“Depends on how much I let Thor do,” Steve chuckled back. “See you later, Tony.”
“Hi,” he smiled softly, stretching his arm. “I’m sorry about that. Falling asleep, I mean. And the…position,” he meant sticking his ass next to Tony, but he didn’t want to say it.
“Oh, I’m sure I will occupy a real bed much more from now on. Not so sure about the sleep part, though,” he winked at Steve and left the room, and Steve watched him walk out in disbelief.
“Ah,” is all he said, turning his attention to his paper. Steve raised his eyebrows at Nat and she just shrugged.
“When did you two become so…familiar?” Clint prodded, a hint of innuendo in his voice.
“You know me well,” Tony took a drink of his own. He intended for the flattered tone in his voice to sound sarcastic, but he was afraid it sounded as real as it felt. Steve seemed to remember every little thing, and it always warmed his heart.
“Mighty Captain!” Thor’s voice boomed as he walked into the kitchen. Steve was already wearing an apron and had all the ingredients and dishes laid out.
“I’ve been waiting and waiting for you to make a move, you know,” Tony smirked, leaning against the counter right across from Steve.
“Hey Steve, are you gonna- oh.” Natasha stopped in her tracks when she saw the two men, and Steve quickly pulled away from kissing Tony’s neck, unhooking Tony’s arms and legs from around him (because Tony didn’t care to, but Steve wasn’t really one for PDA). “Sorry guys, I just…Steve are you gonna come spar? Thor and Clint are waiting.”
“I didn’t know you were a multi-meal kinda guy, that’s all. I see you are very serious about this whole domesticity thing,” Tony teased back.
“So what you’re telling me is, our scatterbrained billionaire genius was sensitive and supportive and helped you through a panic attack?”
“I didn’t know if you would tell me. It seemed…private. I thought maybe I would have to wear you down first,” she crossed her arms.
“Tony will appreciate it,” she assured him. Bruce and Clint came in, followed by Thor, and they all got food and drinks and headed to the rec room to get the movie set up and wait on Tony. Steve got an extra plate of food and a water for Tony and followed them. He took his seat in the corner of the big couch, making sure he sat last so there would be a guaranteed seat for Tony next to him.
“I sleepwalk. Last night it just happened to be into Steve’s room. It’s a non-issue,” he shrugged, blowing it off easily. Steve still looked mortified, even though it was just the three of them. “Speaking of noticing things,” Tony began to add, “what’s the deal with you and Barton?”
“Thanks, Cap,” Tony smiled at him and they sat in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, Steve watching him work.
“Me and Clint,” she replied easily, squeezing his arm when he sat down next to her.
“Uh, Steve? Your gigantic bicep is kind of squishing my arm,” he spoke in a whisper, amusement clear in his tone. Steve decided to act before he overthought.
“I’m sorry Tony, I-I’m so sorry” he managed to get out between sobs.
“I was just so nervous, Nat. I don’t know what happened. Two months ago, I couldn’t have cared less. When I’m in Captain America mode, I don’t think about it, I just lead the team. But when I’m just Steve and he’s Tony, it’s like he’s on this whole other level and I don’t know how to talk to him.”
“Sleepwalking,” Steve blurted out, avoiding eye contact with either of them. Tony rolled his eyes, and looked at Natasha.
“Goodnight, Steve,” he smiled and rested his cheek against Steve’s head.
“Very good, Captain.” JARVIS fell silent after that, and Steve took the plate with the sandwich, and bottle of water, and a cup of black coffee and headed towards Tony’s workshop. The door was open when he reached it, likely JARVIS’ doing. Steve cleared his throat awkwardly.
“Well, that’s where Jarvis took the elevator, and I figured that it wouldn’t be the first time,” he looked down and felt himself blush
“You what?”
“Tony?” he prodded, just to make sure he was asleep. No response, so he moved the blankets aside and covered Tony up when he flopped down on the bed. Tony immediately shifted his head onto Steve’s chest, slung his arm across Steve’s torso, and wrapped his legs around Steve like a koala bear. Steve planted a small kiss on the top of Tony’s head. “Goodnight, Tony. I’m glad you’re here.” He drifted off the happiest he thought he had ever felt.
“Yeah?”
“Thanks,” he responded easily. She looked him up and down and looked please.
“I’ve gotta go, Steve. Sparring with Clint. Just take him the coffee.” She smiled and glided out of the room, and Steve decided she was right. He got in the elevator and headed to the workshop, coffee in hand. The door opened when Steve walked up to it, and Tony didn’t seem to notice. Steve noticed that the dark circles under Tony’s eyes were deeper than they were the night before, and Tony looked so focused that Steve almost didn’t want to interrupt him.
“Nat, I’m going crazy. He makes me so damn nervous.”
“It’s not like that, Clint, he just fell asleep in the workshop and I-”
“You don’t have to worry about that today, Birdbrain,” he then turned his attention to Steve. “I have to head to the workshop now, unfortunately, but I’ll see you later?”
“Excuse me?”
“Steve, it’s okay,” Tony stroked Steve’s hair and held him tight. “Everything is okay, Steve. You’re right here with me. I’ve got you. It’s okay,” It took another little while for the crying to calm, and Steve took a few deep breaths, sat up, and wiped his face with his hands.
“Yeah, C- Steve?”
“Well,” Steve stood up, “I guess I’ll get out of your hair so you can keep working.”
“So not cool, Nat,” he glared at her, but after a few seconds his face softened and he smiled. “It was…nice.”
“Whatever, Romanoff, you know you love me,” he smiled sugar-sweet at her.
“Brucie,” Tony nodded to him.
“Sure, Tony,” Bruce pushed his glasses up on his nose and gestured to a stool, but Tony paced back and forth rather than sitting. “Is everything alright?”
“Thanks, Tones. I don’t feel like people thank you enough for how much you do for us, least of all Barton, but we really appreciate it.”
“Tony was fully awake and aware, and he went back to sleep in your bed, I’m assuming cuddling you?” Steve turned pink at that.
“Okay, Steve, I’m sorry. Let’s talk about it tomorrow,” he put a comforting hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I have to go to the bathroom,” he went to get out of bed, but Steve grabbed his arm before he could get up.
“I’m sure it is, based on that goony smile you have on. How was your night?” he blushed but didn’t bother trying to hide his smile.
“If it makes you feel any better, Bruce thinks you and Tony would be great together,” she smiled, sipping her coffee.
“J, heat it up some more,” he scooted closer to Steve, wrapping his arms around Steve’s upper body and pulling him close. Steve didn’t let the blankets go, but Tony held on. “Steve, it’s okay. Steve, I’m here. It’s me, Tony, I’m right here.” Steve’s breathing was still heavy and uneven, and the shivering continued, so Tony just held him. Tony was soon covered in sweat as well, due to the heat of the room added to the natural heat of Steve’s body. After a couple minutes of Steve repeating “cold” and Tony reassuring him, the shivering stopped and his breathing began to slow. Tony didn’t let go, and Steve leaned into his body rather than just being held. The shivering turned into sobs, and he cried into Tony’s shirt.
“No worries,” Tony smiled easily. “J, can you regulate the temp?”
“Always,” he gulped the coffee down at an unhealthy rate, something that Steve found endearing- also concerning for Tony’s health, but that was a fight he knew no one could win. “So, what exactly happened last night?”
“Think about it, Tony. He brings you food all the time, he always sits as close to you as he can, and from what it sounds like he willingly cuddled with you last night.”
Before Steve could ask any questions, Tony crashed into him with all the yearning he had been feeling coming through like electricity. Steve had been waiting for this moment for months, and it was just as perfect as he’d imagined. Their lips moved together like they had done it a thousand times before, which Steve hoped would be true in the very near future. They were interrupted by someone clearing their throat, and they pulled away from each other to see Natasha and Clint.
“Sorry,” Steve shook his head and smiled, bringing his hand to the back of his neck and looking up at her. “I just-”
“Captain Rogers?” Jarvis’ voice called out that night, around 9 pm.
“I need some soda!” he defended himself, grabbing a can out of the fridge.
“Oh, I’ll go to bed, but there’s no way in hell I’m going to sleep,” Tony pulled Steve into a kiss and Steve quickly lifted Tony up, Tony’s legs winding around Steve’s waist. Steve grinned when Tony pulled away to take a breath.
“Sorry,” Steve took a shaky breath and smiled slightly, “I don’t know where all of that came from.”
“Thanks, I needed it. You can stay if you want,” Tony offered, turning his attention back to what he was working on.
“He clings like an octopus in his sleep,” a smile spread across his face, but he still wouldn’t make eye contact.
Steve cleaned up and took off his apron once he put the lasagna in the oven, and headed up to his room to get dressed. He assumed it would just be like any other time, but once he reached his closet he got nervous, suddenly thinking about what Natasha had said earlier that day and wondering if he should dress up. He remembered what Tony had been wearing when he saw him- sweatpants that accentuated his fabulously round ass with a t-shirt- and decided against dressing up. He put on a pair of light grey sweatpants and a tight white t-shirt that he hoped would make Tony notice him. He made his way back to the kitchen about a half hour later and saw Natasha sitting there with a cup of tea.
“Is everything okay, Nat? Is Tony hurt?” Steve became panicked, not having considered how truly strange this was.
“I don’t think we’re the favorite couple,” she looked right at Tony.
“Nice impression,” Tony got out when he caught his breath from laughing. “Well,” he sucked the last of the milkshake out of the cup, tossing it into the trashcan, “thanks for the milkshake, Steve. I should probably get back to work. Good luck with Thor,” he laughed. “What’s the likelihood I’ll end up ordering in for movie night?”
“Hey, um, JARVIS?” Steve still felt weird talking to the AI, but he was getting more used to it the longer he was in the tower.
“Gotcha back,” Steve smiled against Tony’s lips, thinking about how he was experiencing everything he had been waiting for, and how it was perfect. Tony kept his legs wrapped around Steve and his hands wandered under Steve’s shirt to feel his chest.
“Okay, yeah,” he swallowed nervously. “Why did he come into my room?”
“You could’ve just asked that in the first place,” he responded easily, shaking his head at her amusedly.
“It most definitely will not,” Steve assured him, “Right Tony?”
“Lord of the Rings?” Clint groaned.
“What can I do for you, Steve?” he didn’t look up from his work.
“Goodnight, friends!” His voice was loud enough to make Tony jolt awake, much to Steve’s dismay. He immediately sat upright, a sheepish look on his face. As everyone else left the room, he smiled at Steve.
“Sometimes you have to make things happen, Steve.”
“From the sleepwalking?”
“I agree, but please don’t have sex in the kitchen,” Clint shuddered slightly at the thought. Tony laughed and put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
“What about me?” He questioned, picking up the tea kettle that Steve always put on for him and pouring the water in his mug.
“What are you wearing to movie night?” Steve stopped when he sat up, confused.
“What are you telling me, Natasha?” Steve asked quietly.
“Strawberry,” Steve smiled softly, sucking at the straw of his own cup.
“Uh, yeah. That one.” He could feel himself blushing but he made himself continue. “Let’s say you were right and I do want to be friends with Tony. How exactly should I go about that?”
“Don’t take it personally, Steve,” Natasha spoke softly, a kindness in her voice that Steve imagined most people didn’t experience.
Tony Stark wasn’t someone who had a lot of friends. He was charming, certainly, but he typically either couldn’t tolerate people long enough to sustain any sort of connection, or he couldn’t keep his pants on. He was surprised when they all moved in so willingly- Steve especially. He gave Bruce a lab, and Natasha and Clint had floors directly above/below each other so they could do whatever assassin bonding activities it is that they do. Thor spent a lot of time on Asgard, but showed up quite a lot unannounced and ate all the PopTarts. After just three weeks, Tony had JARVIS buy a box of each flavor, much to Thor’s absolute glee. Pretty quickly after moving in, they all fell into comfortable routines. Tony and Bruce talked about science, Tony and Clint played video games, Tony and Natasha sparred. Steve took longer to warm up, though. He tended to spend most of his time on his floor, except for the once-a-week movie nights Tony had designated “mandatory team bonding.”
When Tony awoke the next morning, the weight of Steve on him was gone, and he opened his eyes to see that he was alone. He got up and brushed his teeth before going to the kitchen, where he knew everyone was.
“About Tony?”
After he tossed and turned all night, Steve got up and ran- hard- trying to clear his head. He went home and showered, and went to the kitchen to make breakfast, assuming Tony would filter in like he always did. When he first heard footsteps, his heart started racing and he turned around fast to see Natasha.
“You can stay, if you want. I’m headed out for my run.”
There was a knock on the door of the workshop, and Tony yelled ‘Come in!’ without bothering to check who it was- it was either Bruce with a question or Steve with food, both of which would be a welcome distraction.
“Steve, what the hell are you doing in my bed?!” Tony demanded before looking around. “Or,” he was quieter now, and felt embarrassment blooming on his cheeks, “what the hell am I doing in yours?”
“It’s no big deal, I was just a little embarrassed is all,” he didn’t look up from the pancake batter he was stirring.
“Sure, Steven,” Thor responded, tying the apron around his neck. Steve figured that was as close as he was gonna get, so he didn’t push it anymore.
“Right time for what?” Steve’s head shot up at the voice to see Tony sauntering into the room, looking tired but more rested than usual, presumably looking for his morning caffeine boost. Seeing Tony, everyone else started to leave the room. Steve wanted to stop them, to tell them they were making it too obvious, but he couldn’t deny that he wanted to be alone with Tony.
“Steve?” He turned around to see that Tony’s eyes were still closed and he hadn’t moved. Steve walked back over to where Tony was laying and ran a hand through Tony’s disheveled mess of thick black hair.
“Yeah,” Steve looked down, unable to hide the disappointment in his voice. “No problem, Tony.” Tony made his way out of the room before questioning it, and rushed to Bruce’s lab, feeling like he needed to talk to someone.
“That was all you,” Steve replied easily, making Tony sigh.
Steve laughed again, not so much at Tony’s sarcasm, but more at the delight of knowing he had met someone just as enraptured as he was when it came to the queries of discovering your soulmate.
Steve Rogers
“You understand now? I never left you.” It was obvious, so obvious, and yet Steve had refused to see it. “No matter how you hurt me, I stayed for you, Steve. I’ve always celebrated today, knowing it was the anniversary of me opening my life to you. And it was the commemoration of a new future. At least, it was…”
I don’t know if I had changed anything if his mind would have changed after all. I would like to think he would have wanted me if I had done things right, and yet...
“You find yourself a discreet little - what do we call this? A - room? One, two, three, four walls and...yep! A ceiling. Of course. It’s a room. A nice little
“Oh.”
It was awkward, offering comfort to Captain America over his dad’s death. The moment passed quickly when a jet zoomed past the window, catching Steve’s attention. Tony felt overwhelmed by the flash of movement and the soft sound the jet emitted. Logically, he knew it was an occurrence he’d experienced a million times. But his whole body jumped, rattled by something that now felt completely foreign. He felt the temperature dropping, too, as a sudden chill ran through his body.
,” Steve relaxed his arms and walked to Tony, wrapping him in a secure embrace. “I get it. You’ve been through so much.
It didn’t matter that they were on the roof, surrounded by the brisk chill of midnight - Steve still guided Tony to the ground. Beds and mattresses were overrated, even though they were a scarcity these days.
“You’d do well to get some rest,” he tried, studying the man before him.
“I have been listening to the radio, so, I recognized a lot of what you played. It’s debatable whether that’s a good or a bad thing, but anyway, you could say I’m acclimating to this century.” Tony nods, and Steve continues. “This song, well, it reminds me of you. Of what you did today. And how invincible you are.”
After the daunting nightmares won’t fade, Tony tries to go meta with his experience. It’s not a big deal. He decides music therapy is what he needs - not that he needs
“You’re
“I’ll make us rings.”
“Put them in a room together - what could go wrong?”
“The SHIELD doesn’t control me any longer,” he says with a soft tone of awe. “They’ve told their stories of Captain America and Nomad, and I refusing to acquiesce any longer. I’m free now. We can run away, and I’ll never let you go.”
As if they had done this a thousand times before, Steve carried him to the meager couch tucked away in a forgotten corner of the lab, their lips never parting through the journey.
“One Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, pla-”
When you talk to Bucky, let him know I’ll be alright. If you see Sharon, encourage her to follow your lead. Same goes for Bucky, I suppose. I put my faith in you.
“No. I mean yeah. It’s a bit chilly.”
_____________
Steve’s broken sobs were the only reply Natasha would receive.
I know I wasn’t worth it.
He’s left me with a request. Sam, I plan to spend the remainder of my days honoring his wish.
Steve held a hand-scrawled note gingerly.
Steve closed the distance with four swift paces and gave a quick brush of his lips to that insatiable grin. Tony replied with a contented groan as Steve was nearly out the door.
“Thought you said it was my choice if this were a rescue.”
I see my body, it’s still floating somewhere, far from my mind.
A loud bellow emptied his thoughts. Then, brown eyes were all he could think of.
,” he says regrettably. Formerly known as Captain America. He no longer dons the mantle, but still conceals his face with a dark cowl, as his former identity did. “So, is this a rescue, or is it not?”
This is a novel thought that sends a vile wave of nausea through him, something he’d never considered about the implications of what an alien invasion could lead to, and he’s interpreting it as a bad thing in the present moment. Maybe intergalactic-human relations could be good, or consensual somehow, at some point, but that’s not the Chitauri’s goal today. Steve pushes the horrific thought away.
“Our anniversary. The day I promised I would be with you forever, no one but you, no one else, only you. The day...the day I told you that you’re, that we’re...soulmates. The day I pledged my heart and soul to you. The day...I sacrificed all of my tech, repurposed my suits, the day we lost our family...the day the world ended.
“I wanna feel you, babe.” It didn’t take much to threaten Steve’s control, and Tony’s plea was too much. He retracted his hand, and feverishly began tearing away at his duty belt and zipper. He was hard, impossibly hard, and with a bit more lube, Steve sunk greedily into the enrapturing heat of Tony’s body.
“It’s hot.”
“Steve.”
“All I feel you.” Tony turned away with his admission, and something betrayed Steve’s heart, something deep and wild lurched at Tony’s words,
The thick diameter of the band was an adjustment. It’s width was somewhat constricting to his finger’s movements, especially when training, but the foreign circle embracing his third digit quickly became an item that grounded him when he needed to be present.
Steve chuckled. “They wouldn’t let me leave until they dressed me up.”
, ok?” Tony stilled, a perturbed look speaking over the silence that filled the room. “You’re
Steve has to fix this, he has to change this, there has to be a way for this to not be an eternal sacrifice.
He was my soulmate, and I was his friend. It will have to be enough, and I think that it is.
Tony cornered him, viciously insulting, ranting, exclaiming in a fit of raving nonsense. But Steve was listening, and he knew it wasn’t nonsense. So when Tony spit out the culmination of his rant, he was ready.
“And how exactly do you expect me to do that
“Um, no, I’d really rather not. It’s easier to just try and forget it. Sorry.” He still seemed a bit dejected in his replies.
” He tried again, knowing as soon as the words spilled from his lips that it was a mistake. Tony’s tears finally began overflowing from the shallow dam.
A muffled sound was now barely audible emitting from somewhere far away from the compound.
I know it’s only been a collection of days, not quite strung into weeks yet, since Tony’s death. But all I’ve had time to do is to sit and think. I sit in this cell, and stare at the ceiling, but I don’t even see the concrete anymore. I just think about Tony, and what I could have done.
“I see what you do for others every day. You’re kind. And giving. And-”
May 6th, 2016
“You actually buy this story? Aliens made them do it? I dunno, I’m team ‘true love’ this time.”
A sucker, Steve always was.
Tony replied urgently. Parrot? Sea shanties? Tony performing on alternating weekends? None of this was making sense.
“The way you moan my name when I fuck you while wearing it.”
“Inject the boys with a mind-altering toxin to fry their mind-control.”
“You look good wearing the suit, babe,” Tony purred demurely.
The words struck the dam in his heart and he felt a shivering wave overcome him.
Steve replied.
“Sir yes sir!”
He feels Nomad’s weight leave his body, and instantly, he’s being pulled into his captor’s arms once again to curl against his chest.
“We’re gonna need the ring, Steve. Tony’s got to dismantle it if there’s any hope to restore your shield and his reactor.”
“No, you like it too much when it stays on.”
Of course, he finds that music might not be the remedy he needs.
A nuke.
There is so much out there, the burden of his newfound knowledge begins to stifle his breath, his head dizzy, he’s falling again, until -
“You’ve seen them! They’re miserable, can’t even be in the same room as each other. Hey...do you think if they get divorced, we’ll have to move out?”
“But remember, you’re healing, yeah? After each mission you need to be grounded. Allow me to take care of you.”
,” he growled as he bottomed out. “I love your ass so much.”
_____________
Tony looked around the room. It was crowded, but he was sure he’d have seen a super soldier walk in.
Steve’s eyes settled on a light piece of paper next to his bed. He forced his sight into complete darkness, walked to the bed, and impulsively crumpled the paper in his hand. A few deep breaths later, and Steve still couldn’t bring himself to drop the ruined paper in the trash bin.
“‘m not going to die,” he groans, and attempts to bat away at Tony’s insistent hands. “I’m enhanced with miracle healing abilities, lest you forget.” His words are becoming a bit slurred.
“Brilliant. I’ll toast to that.” Nothing about this evening had gone as he had expected, and it was all the better for it. Tony raised his glass in a silent salute to the pirates who managed to swindle him a second date with the finest captain of the land and the sea. Looking at the remarkable treasure of a man before him, he knew that the expected things in life were vastly overrated.
Not in the way I loved him.
Steve thinks sarcastically, humming along with the song, punching and attacking to the beat as Tony impressively takes another one of the crafts out of the horizon.
“I dunno, Nat, everyone’s saying it was. And they clearly don’t wanna be married now.”
Sharing this intimacy with Steve was almost healing. It was a slow and deliberate effort, one with careful caresses and deep kisses that threatened to make him forget the years of trauma he had endured in the name of love. Now he knew love would never push him until he broke. Love is what pulled him back together, and Tony for a moment believed Steve's love would compel all of his broken and jumbled pieces to find one another to become whole again. That’s how Steve made him feel - whole.
Though they spent every moment possible together, they never made their relationship official.
I’m seduced by the dream of one day holding him again. The golden strand’s pull is still taut, although I don’t know how that’s possible. But, when I attend Tony’s funeral, I’ll say goodbye, and I’ll mean it. If this thread keeps pulling my heart, I’ll trust it, I’ll follow it. I traveled through time to find him, and I arrived here. He always was my guiding light.
, gentlemen.” He spoke loudly to curtail further protest. “Dr. Banner has created a mild toxin that will short circuit the device. The toxin may distort your memories from this time, but you’ll be back to your normal selves in a matter of hours. Well, maybe I shouldn’t say
“We’ll just have to invite them all to the wedding, then.”
Steve found a crisp, blue button-down shirt, rolled the sleeves to his elbows so he wouldn’t have to make a decision about whether or not to wear cuff links, and displayed a crimson gladiolus on his chest. Tony, ever stylish, wore a flowing cream suit with a bold patterned button down.
What, then, brought Tony Stark to share the same air with an explosive renegade in a shitty room in a forgettable foreign city?
“I kept telling myself we’d have time. Every time I fucked up. Every miscommunication. Every missed opportunity. I thought, ‘we’ll be ok, we’ve got time.’” He shifted awkwardly, searching for the resolve to carry him through, allowing the weight of the significance of the chance he’d been gifted settle upon his shoulders.
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve couldn’t help but smile. The warmth filled him so full, he couldn’t help that every expression he displayed had to relieve some of what was bursting from within.
His captor says nothing, and Tony lamentably thinks that his dead lover would have found his quip amusing. Perhaps the hand muffled his response, or perhaps this person has no levity about them. He feels the bindings on his ankles snap, followed by his wrists. Limb by limb, he feels strong hands run along him with gentle squeezing pressure, perhaps to search for weapons, which seems odd considering
“Tony...I’m so sorry. Do you want to talk about it?” He offered sincerely.
“Why do you-”
The startling clatter of metal rattled his core. Violent words scared away the hope blossoming inside his heart.
was the sentiment that won out in his mind.
“That’s just what we need to discuss. Who calls their wedding reception an ‘after party?’”
He’s consumed by it all, thoughts of what he did.
He can’t black out, he has to stay awake, alive, because-
he hears Clint yell off in the distance, somehow not through the comms, and Steve suppresses a chuckle. Tony sure does know how to bring people together.
, I didn’t know about the other, uh, stuff…”
“That’s kind of the only way I do things.”
“With this ring-”
“...home.” It was almost a whisper, merely a soft exhale, and Steve couldn’t be sure Tony himself had heard what he breathed out.
He’s lost all functionality in the suit.
Tony leaned back in his seat, staring absently out the window. It had just started to rain, and his reflection in the glass made Steve’s heart pound erratically. Suddenly, Tony’s expression changed, and he lunged from his seat to grab Steve by the hand.
and all he can think of is -
Arms crossed tightly across his chest, Steve bristled against the cold New York wind. “If the Chitauri left anything behind, anything at all, we have a responsibility to contain it. What did we do all of that recon for after the attack if not to control all of their tech?”

“The Chitauri are good at what they do, and are particularly adept with technology, you see. However, limitations do exist to their capabilities. Mind control only extends so far. If their aim was to weaken Stark and Captain Rogers through means of compromising their most formidable sources of power, the mind control should only be able to accomplish that end.”
“I’ve never heard of medical interventions affecting awakening a soulbond.” Tony finally spoke up, words flowing quickly. “People have all sorts of surgeries, implants, you know, whatever, and we take the craziest drugs these days. Who even knows what chemicals we consume from our food alone. Plus - tanning beds? Basically vita-rays. Or close enough. Look, Steve,” he leaned close, resting a reassuring hand on his leg, “if anyone’s stubborn enough to figure this out, it would be you.”
It was a grueling battle, the culmination of days of work tracking down Loki, and the team could feel stability slipping through their fingers.
“What is this?” he exclaimed in disbelief, rain starting to pour down his face.
Nothing would ever turn Steve on more than Tony’s confession.
“Toni St-arrr-k.”
I have to remain strong. For you, for Bucky, for SHIELD, for the world.
-and he’s not slowing down.
The fact that Tony was even here inspired reverence within him. For the past seven hours, upon learning that Tony intended to travel to meet him, he thought about what it must feel like to travel alone to an unknown place to face the man who destroyed you. He would have empathy, if only they had been enemies. But a friend - that was incomprehensible.
Steve steadies himself, preparing for shawarma - because apparently after an alien invasion that’s what you do, go eat food you’ve never tasted before. Because now you appreciate life and what it has to give in a different way, desperate to change yourself, not repeat the same familiar mistakes of the past.

I’m starting to think there never was a letter. And, I’m starting to beg for any message from beyond the veil, or otherwise. Anything from Tony.
“So...you wanna know why I brought you up here?” The brunet was smiling back, and shuffled his feet coyly to distract from his obvious insecurity.
“You can change your mind.”
“And you actually believe locking me in your tower is worth your time?”
This moment was what Steve had slowly been building toward. Every compliment, every patient interaction had brought them here, and he knew he had done something right.
“Oh, uh, thanks!” he said, awkwardly shifting the large bowl of popcorn to one arm in order to accept the flowers. His expression looked worried. “I’ll just set them on your counter.”
A quiet groan emitted from the plush heap he had just escaped. Steve glanced over his shoulder to see Tony, eyes closed, contented smile animating his face, reaching a weary hand in his proximity.
With a self-satisfied chuckle, “Good luck!” was all she said.
He and Steve are practically from different worlds. Adrenaline and fear fueled his dying wish to see Steve again, and now that he has, well, he can’t envision a world where they could make it work. Whatever ‘it’ is. It doesn’t matter. Tony’s a mess, after all, and a delusional sap to think he and Steve could accomplish anything without fighting, tearing each other apart, no matter how hard he’s fallen for the man.
If guilt was something Steve had the capacity to feel any longer, he might have felt it by now. The stress of all they had endured as Avengers and the friction caused by their disagreement over the accords left Steve devoid of what he once considered integral parts of his identity. Their clandestine trysts were all that they shared. He couldn’t supply Tony with the words he wished for, no matter how desperately he wanted to. Nothing he could do would ever be enough, so Steve reasoned they may as well spend their time communicating through moans. Somehow, in spite of his temper and all that he was unable to give, Tony seemed to agree.
“When was I drunk?”
Steve dropped his head, and Tony felt the embarrassment before Steve’s neck glowed pink. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have lied. It’s just...it’s hard to talk about. I’ll be ok.”
The pungent smell filled his mind. He couldn’t escape it. Steve let out a broken cry.
” Tony’s words were a faint whisper now, “I’ve been holding on to you all these years...
“Are you cold?”
“Only for my boyfriend to tell me what movie we’re going to watch.”
,” Tony said with awe.

They are quiet for a long time, Tony out of protest, and he wonders if Nomad’s silence is due to guilt over his betrayal of their former team. He reconsiders this thought immediately. The stories go on without end, and detail the robberies, crusades, and murders Nomad has committed now that he answers to no one. They say he’s power-hungry, and will burn entire cities to the ground to get anything he wants. They are the sort of tales that Tony almost couldn’t bring himself to believe of his former comrade, but seeing him now, he’s beginning to understand. There exists remorse over the evil path Nomad has taken.
“Tony, what-”
Steve started to lean in and reach his hand out toward Tony, then hesitated, still searching for something in Tony’s eyes. And it didn’t take anything more for Tony to know he wanted to bridge the gap between them.
He wasn’t even able to make sense of what happened in his own mind, how was he going to explain it to Steve?
“What’d he say?”
They sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment, the weight of Tony’s innocent curiosity sinking in.
“Woah woah woah, I’m not taking anything that’s gonna mess with my memories!” Incensed, Tony began to stomp after the Director.
You know, he was a character witness at the trial in my defense. I suppose everyone knows that, now. He’s charming, and if you watched any of the coverage, you’ll know his charismatic tongue was a great asset to my defense. But you won’t know that his testaments at trial were insincere. Behind closed doors, when the cameras left, when proceedings paused, Tony and I had a few moments, in the end. We were close once, in a way no one knew but us. I asked him about his testimony, and he told me he didn’t mean it. He told me to move on, accept the olive branch, and accept the way the world will be from now on. I don’t agree with his choices. I think he was selfish, self-centered, egotistical, and I think he was a genius, too. Such a genius, in fact, that he could’ve prevented this, all of this, and yet, he didn’t. His hubris got the better of him, didn’t it? I knew it always would.
“Not so bad.”
Tony sees blood, hears a scream of agony, but it’s all happening too fast, his mind is still bleary from all he’s endured and he can’t track it all.
“What you feel is real, Tony, it is, you have to trust yourself, trust me, I feel it too-” Steve tried to refute, to change his course of thinking, but Tony was gone, so far gone in his conviction.
Tony looked around, a mischievous grin lighting his face. “What better place than right here?”
That’s all I feel I am now. A shadow.
Steve clutched a hallowed piece of metal in his desperate grip. The pressure from his hold pressed the element into his skin, forcing a break in the flesh. Steve spun on his heels and left the room, inconspicuous drops of blood trailing behind.
“What the hell, Steve?”
“And you look good wearing nothing.” Steve reached down to grasp Tony’s length, hard and ready. His gloved hand might cause more damage than was desirable, so Steve proceeded to stroke him carefully, slowly, encouraged by the gasps and whines filling the night air. It didn’t take long for Steve to know he had to stop, lest he tip Tony over the edge before he was finished with him.
“You must find us shelter at once!” He orders. Nomad is staggering in his gait, and is slowing a bit. “You’ll kill us both if you don’t!” Nomad indicates to continue his path. Still bound at the wrists, Tony awkwardly wraps his hands around Nomad’s jaw and pulls his face to meet his gaze. “Listen to what I say!”
“I’d like that a lot. I think the barkeeps would like that, too.”
“I haven’t heard that one before.” Tony mused, absentmindedly rearranging some tools in his workshop.
Nomad jerks him towards his chest. “I have use for you,” he utters, and Tony rolls his eyes. “But I’d be amenable to a different arrangement. I’ll take your hand in marriage, if you’d prefer it.”
Steve’s eyes grew wide and Tony felt an easy sense of awe take the edge off of the collective tension in the room. He felt drawn to Steve, maybe even safe, and he finally allowed himself to sit next to him.
“There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.”
we’ll do it again. Right here. Everything the same.”
“You feel incredible,” he murmured. As his thrusts grew more erratic, the words flowed more and more freely. “God, you feel
“Ok, let me bring us back to the beginning, and tell you again what you can expect.” He paused and waited for Steve to nod, indicating for him to continue. “I just wanna help you adjust. You’ve been through a hell of a lot, and it’s gonna take time to get used to it. You’re safe here, and I can help you.”
“You didn’t have to tell me where you were.”
“Steve, I-”
Enticed by the flash of a memory from last night, Steve paused. He remembered what it was like when they were connected. Touching Tony’s naked skin felt like touching electrified velvet every time. It was novel, tantalizing, and insanely addictive. The intimacy they shared was overwhelming to his every faculty, a force that rendered Steve powerless to overcome. He was desperate to feel what he once did, something that could strike his soul, a sensation he had long since lost. In his reckless plight, he made sure to push further each time, roughly claiming Tony’s body in ways he hadn’t dreamt of. Tony didn’t ask for it, but of course he wanted it. He had to have wanted it.
, this is not about the team. This is about
He’s not doing enough. Steve would tell him he could do more.
“That’s entirely up to you.”
Steve awoke to labored breathing and a whimper. He couldn’t be sure of the time, but it didn’t feel as though he had been asleep very long. Through the haze of slumber, he wiped a hand down his face and scanned the room. Tony was in his bed, asleep, but clearly not comfortably. Steve watched only to witness the fit grow, escalating quickly into whimpers and cries of incomprehensible vowels. Tony was in distress, and not showing any indication of waking.
At every opportunity, Tony still avidly wished to be with Steve, intimately, with focus and excitement and passion. A few hours ago, Tony attentively brought Steve to the brink over and over, so many times he lost count, edging him so assiduously that his body felt untethered by mass, then meticulously extracted a series of no less than nine overwhelming orgasms, so powerful he felt every empty space in his body fill with light and warmth and bliss.
“I can’t say that I do. But you said they mentioned me?”
Some of the words sound familiar. Maybe a love song. Definitely a love song. But maybe it’s a sad one, and Tony thinks he’s ok with that.
The captor begins to run, and even though Tony can’t be sure it’s not, he guesses this newest development is not a rescue. He gives his best effort to squirm and fight, yelling with all the air in his lungs, which turns out isn’t much, and now he’s fighting just to breathe as his diaphragm bounces off his captor’s shoulder.
Tony felt flashes of love and warmth only for them to quickly fade away, replaced by abject desolation. It was so crippling he had difficulty taking a breath.
May 6, 2012
“We’ve all become that which we no longer recognize.”
Hulk leaps and catches the suit, Tony encased within, and when Tony comes to, Steve instantly thinks he knows no more beautiful color than the deep hue of brown that are Tony’s eyes.
.” The words ripped through his whole body, and suddenly the world around him began to fade away.
_____________
“Twenty years ago.”
Tony must have had the same idea, because their lips collided halfway between their bodies.
and now their bodies are almost pressed against each other, and all Tony can think about is how close Steve’s lips were to his when he woke up on the concrete and what he wanted to do then and now-
“I won’t have anything left, Natasha.” His voice was nothing but a broken whisper, a plea to an absent god.
Steve hovered over Tony as they panted heavily together. Other than the impossible sensations of heat and tightness overwhelming his cock, his body felt nothing else, only stiff fabric encasing his skin. The uniform was cumbersome, true, but the power it had over Tony was satisfaction enough for Steve.
“No, but you know what I mean! If they can’t stand to be around each other, Cap’s definitely gonna leave. But then he can’t be the only one on the team who doesn’t live here, so someone’ll have to go with him. But then it’ll be like we’re choosing sides, and...oh god, is this the end of the
“You really think that will work?”
“For the record, this was not my definition of a ‘good ol’ fashioned slumber party.’”
What the hell was on East 14th? He knew he should have arranged Steve’s ride for the night, but Steve had insisted on doing it himself as a way to reorient himself with the city.
It aches. It’s so strange, how your body can feel nothing at all, and yet there is a gaping pain tearing at every shadow within your heart.
His eyes burst open abruptly, vision obscured by white - white was all he could see. Panting, dizzy, incoherent, he rolled his head to the side, he was forgetting something over there, he knew he was, but what was it -
Heaving harshly, he wrapped a gloved hand around Tony’s throbbing cock, squeezing firm, allowing his hand to shake tight and fast rather than stroke long and hard, knowing the rough material had the potential to make Tony raw. With little effort, Tony was ready, and inaudible prayers floated from his lips accompanying his climax. Despite their shared intimate history, it was a sight Steve would never not cherish - Tony Stark, splayed on the ground before him, impossibly tense, then impossibly limp, all within seconds, blanketed with a soft aura of bliss.
Truthfully, he was still baffled too, but he didn’t want to admit it. None of it quite made sense. But, maybe the reason why the mystery had been solved didn’t really matter. Having Tony as his soulmate was his greatest reward, after all. With his life's biggest curiosity now satisfied, he was quite unexpectedly enraptured by an even greater mystery - learning everything there was to know about his soulmate.
“I’m not going back out there. You can just do it yourself.”
“I have a great deal to gain by keeping you captive, all to myself.” He’s whispering in his ear, dark and low, and Tony can hear the rough edge of tension in his voice. “I’ll tuck you away, keep you in the highest tower of my castle, and no one will ever get to you, unless I allow them to do so. The world will be so envious, I’ll gain access to the darkest markets, be revered by all the Cabal.”
The Avengers as a team were almost no more. The fight they endured was almost too much, it almost broke them, until Steve realized Tony had never prepared to fight
“To be fair, it’s not mine either. This was
Steve.
But a date? That was out of the question.
“Well which is it? You didn’t know what we were doing? Or you were scared of losing me?” His demeanor had changed abruptly, his voice was still harsh but Tony was starting to let Steve back in, and Steve knew he didn’t deserve it. “Which reason explains why I’ve never seen your soulmark, Steve?” His voice was impossibly tender, filled with sorrow. Steve knew he was listening, really listening, and wanted to hear the truth. It was more than he could bear.
An unknowable emotion clouds Steve’s face, and he hesitates before responding. “I did not know how you would receive me. I thought it better to maintain the lie until I was assured of your fortitude to accept the truth.”
that to me, take everything away, change everything, and I wake up thinking I’m in love! That’s
They kissed deeply, interrupted only by scattered moans, as Tony took them both in hand, rocking and stroking them to the brink.
We fought a good fight. Our crusade was just. And yet...
Steve found an equal in the dauntless and unyielding Tony Stark, and he’s only just now realizing it, while holding on to stubborn, impossible hope that somehow, Iron Man will pull off another miracle.
Steve takes a long, deep sigh, one Tony knows too well, like he so often does when he contemplates his life’s greatest regrets. “What you know of the story of Captain America is mostly true. I was an underdog indentured for Project Rebirth, helped to end the great war, and went down with my aircraft for several decades.” He nods once, which Tony reciprocates to indicate that he follows. “The SHIELD found me almost a year before the world met Captain America again. They didn’t know if I was stable, capable to return to duty. They appointed me as a knight of the SHIELD, and afforded me a mostly provincial life. Then,”
Something - gravity, perhaps? - pulls at his back, he feels like he’s being sucked backward, and he hopes hopes
Despite Steve’s pressing arousal, he never hurried Tony when they fucked. Steve took his time, dedicatedly explored all the corners of his body he had forgotten could bring euphoria, and Tony felt like every inch of him was being savored. Steve opened him tenderly, not a second too fast, not a second too slow. Sometimes he wondered if Steve wouldn’t like to move faster, take him without warning, let off some steam with a rough tryst, but Steve never did. Tony used to believe he wanted it that way, wanted to be used, fucked raw until he met his destruction, but even then he knew the thought wasn’t sincere. With his mind free from the fog of the past, he knew now that he wanted to be cherished, even if he wasn’t sure he deserved it. Steve made him believe he deserved it anyway.
“Ah, yes, dear Agent Romanov, you understand my meaning exactly.”
And, for what? To talk? About what? They’d tried on the phone, on and off for months, and there was nothing productive to talk about. Was it to represent some unenforceable doctrine? That couldn’t be, as Tony shirked his pseudo-ambassadorship responsibilities months ago. Was he here to create a new agreement? Arrest him? Steal his DNA? No, no,
“Because you deserve to be loved! And since you need a little help loving yourself, well, then, Tony, I-” Steve faltered. What was he saying?
“This is it?”
“Who are you calling a sneak? You’re hiding behind a wall!”
Tony was shaking, sparse tears starting to trickle down his face. “Oh,
“We’ll be ok, Tony. We’ve got time.”
JARVIS plays something else. It’s new, soothing, eerie. The raspy voice sings in Spanish, and Tony starts to piece most of the words together, awkwardly deciphering the meaning in his mind. It’s a macabre story, but the melodic tune allows for the song to be still palatable.

“Better?”
Steve placed him down gingerly, and settled his imposing frame against Tony’s. Feeling Tony’s slight body underneath him spurred his desire, but he veiled it with scrupulous movements, deliberate touches, and languid grinding of hips. They carefully began to remove superficial fabrics that concealed their skin. With each layer exposed, Tony’s zeal became more and more obvious, and Steve knew his own eagerness was entirely reciprocated.
I think about that too, about all that I would trade to have him back, or to even have a chance at having him back.
Parrot? Tony looked around again. There was no parrot that he could see amongst the modern décor of the room. So, Steve was definitely in some sequestered section apart from the main hall. Relief washed over him as he let go of tension he hadn’t realized he was holding - he hadn’t been stood up. The restaurant just decided to hide their super soldier patron away in a more exclusive part of their establishment. Which didn’t make much sense - most places Tony was aware of at present seemed to want to disregard Steve’s importance all together. But Gramercy Tavern was classier than that, which was one of the compelling reasons Tony wanted to take Steve here. So, possibly it was plausible they did offer a more exclusive dining experience to Captain America after all.
“Do you want to talk about it? What you’re going through? I know you’ve lost so much.”
Steve returned to New York in May, exactly one year to the day that he and Tony exchanged promises to fix the accords and set policy right. He’d had nothing but time to dream about their reunion. Sure, they talked and exchanged texts almost daily through the entire separation, but Steve couldn’t even allow his wildest dreams to indulge in a hope for anything more than a working relationship with the brown-eyed genius, the man he almost...
When Tony arrived, Steve greeted him with a bouquet of lilacs.
Their lips met and it was like a bolt of lightning struck his brain. Every nerve ending was buzzing with bliss, and he was shaky and nervous and the best he’d ever felt in his entire life all at once. He didn’t know if it was how Steve felt or himself, it was all so new and consuming, he wanted more, and he wanted it to never end.
“C’mon, Cap.” Tony shot a mischievous look over his shoulder as he trailed off to a vacant sitting room. Steve followed close behind.
“It’s ok, I understand. If you go back to sleep, is there something I can do to keep the bad dreams away?”
_____________
Dedicatedly, Steve opened Tony with a devotion and focus that seemed to push him to the edge. “I love your eyes,” Steve hummed, watching every complex emotion light up Tony’s face as he touched him. “You’re doing so good, sweetheart.”
As quickly as he considers obeying, he decides not to, and loudly asks, “What reason have you to compel me?”
“You’re Tony Stark.” His name sounds seductive on his tongue in such a way that his stomach churns. “Brilliant scientist. Former Avenger. Last of the Stark name. Delectable in every imaginable way.”
The smell of burning shook a jolt through his core whenever he thought he smelled it. If he heard heavy machinery, he turned the other way.
“Stark, what the hell is this?” Steve shouts into the comms over a blaring bass guitar riff and anxiety-inducing crescendo of electric keys.
he repeated to himself - for the next year.
“Tony, believe me, if I had been able to choose any alternative, I would have.”
“You can offer them some support, Clint, instead of gossiping.”
- is covered in a trail of blood. His hair is matted and dirty and hanging over his left eye. He looks a bit weathered, but has the same youthful, spirited glow he always had.
Steve trailed kisses along Tony’s neck, to his collarbone, to his chest. The tender touch of Steve’s lips grew needier with each touch, and Tony was willing to lose himself to the seduction.
The gathering wasn’t huge, just the team, who had nothing better to do, at least according to Tony, who reminded them that as their landlord and benefactor he was aware of their schedules and this event was definitely of more excitement than anything else they had planned. No one had time to buy anything new, so they all wore their favorite outfits from over the years - Clint, a flannel shirt that still had all of its buttons, Bruce, a light-colored linen shirt with chinos that were freshly pressed, Natasha, a red bubble dress that she’d never had occasion to wear because it was too outstanding, and Thor, who excitedly wore clothes that were gifted to him from Rhodey who swore they were of the latest “midguardian” fashion, and comprised of a silver fish-scale sequin blazer with skin-tight leopard-print pants.
“You’re amazing,” he said as he slowly pulled out, returning his lips to kiss at Tony’s neck. “Insatiable, incredible, strong.” He rattled off every word of praise he could think was worthy of Tony as he held him tight, relaxing into a blissful afterglow.
Tony stood up, took a very indiscreet survey of the bar, and didn’t see him still.
“It’s ok to quit.”
“I, no, maybe? Honestly, I’m not really sure how to feel.”
_____________
“Our...
“You’re so handsome,” he started, barely breathing the words he spoke. He watched auburn eyes carefully as he continued his praise. “You look good. And smell good. But it’s more than that. Your heart is good. As is your mind." Steve leaned closer to whisper darkly in Tony's ear. "I bet you taste good, too. God, look what you do to me. I can’t help it when I’m around you.”
A pirate who looked a lot like Captain America…
“I’m not gonna quit.” Tony spoke softly into his chest.
A bright smile formed across his face, fueled by a warmth blooming inside of his core. He knew Tony could have always asked JARVIS to pass along the message, or even ask one of the other Avengers to do it, too, but Tony knew him so well. The physical paper requesting his presence was simple, but Steve cherished the thought Tony had put into its execution. He realized he was becoming overwhelmed by a piece of paper, when he was being summoned to see something even more meaningful than a note from the man he loved.
Steve wasn’t entirely sure he was even ready to meet when Tony broached the subject, but also didn’t feel as if he had the right to decline. He actually didn’t have any rights at all. He fully expected their reunion to be overwhelming, and reality didn’t disappoint. Not that either of them was willing to acknowledge the fact.
Tony shifted and brought their lips together, kissing him with the unflappable confidence that Steve so cherished about his boyfriend.
“Yeah.”
He has to. Right? Let these adrenaline-addled thoughts disappear, hide them away, never to pursue it-
There was a mission, an abrupt onslaught that was subdued with ease and cohesion. But there was a moment in battle when JARVIS was temporarily overridden and Tony was sent hurtling toward the clouds against his consent. It was only a moment, and Tony regained control flawlessly, but as soon as it happened, Steve knew what was coming after the debrief.
?” He almost doesn’t dare to ask.
Tony held Steve’s gaze. Whatever apprehension he clutched so tightly upon entering the room, Tony seemed to have abandoned.
“That’s what you think, huh?”
When he sensed Tony Stark, all his mind could hear was
“It comes up, from time to time, with just about anyone who’s willing to talk about it. But, honestly, not a lot of people really care much these days.” Steve thought about how few people in his life he’d been able to have these conversations with. When he was young, he only shared his thoughts with the stars he wished upon. It brought an easy comfort to know Tony was someone he could confide in. “You think you’ll ever figure it out?”
A song starts to play, and to say Tony is confused wouldn’t begin to describe the way his brain is unable to process what he’s hearing.
He’s hit with some rocks. He feels them bounce off of his body, and other than having a startling effect, he’s not hurt. But, damn, does he wish he could see, and that his mind wasn’t so foggy-
_____________
It lives in you. I see that it does. You carry it with you every day. And every day, you choose to overcome it. That’s what makes you so strong.”
“Which thing?”
“Now who wants to gossip?”
“I think you’re gonna be alright, too.”
“...he made this for me, didn’t he? And, he made one for himself, too.”
“You just increased it to 82 degrees.”
He never wanted me.
“If you’d been here earlier, Director Fury, you would’ve been in time for the ‘speak now or forever hold your peace’ line that’s so popular at weddings.” Steve wrapped his arms protectively around his husband.
“No need to be excited, I’ll walk.”
_____________
“No, it’s ok.”
Steve draws toward him, and suddenly Tony has the strength to stand, but it’s ill-timed because Steve is
Steve thought,
“Have you ever tried shawarma?” His eyes still can’t quite focus, his breath he still can’t quite catch. He doesn’t know who he’s talking to, if anyone, or even how he’s forming words when his lungs still feel like they’re on fire. He’s probably back on Earth, somehow, he probably survived,
Finding your soulmate was an elusive task, one that few people were able to accomplish with certainty. Steve was disappointed to learn that the mystery of soulmates and soulbonds were still as ambiguous as the day he was frozen, if not more so. Few people had successfully discovered their soulmates
How could there be pain from something so fleeting he couldn’t even properly remember? He was aching over the loss of something that was never meant to be his.
Tony startled awake, eyes snapping open and cries ceasing suddenly. “S-
“Is the team gonna have a problem with this?”
Tony’s face flushed instantly. He didn’t attempt to leave. And Steve stayed the course.
“Tony…” Despite the chill, he felt heat creep up his neck, an all too familiar sensation when he was unsure of what to do.
He took a breath knowing he’d have to disturb Tony’s slumber. It wasn’t his first choice - Tony was exhausted, he had to be, he’d been getting barely any more sleep than Steve had been the past few weeks, and even for a super soldier the lack of REM cycles had taken their toll. The absence of respite alone would be enough to exhaust Tony, but last night, the brunet was feeling particularly amorous, and he spent every ounce of energy he could exert expressing his enthusiastic feelings for Steve.
“So...you’ll do it?”
“You got it, Cap. Classic alien invasion song, comin’ up.”
Steve had been gone for almost three weeks clearing up a mutiny about 100 miles away that was spreading quickly. After the swell of post-Thanos alien attacks began to wane, borders were quickly constructed, first spanning large stretches, bisecting the country, then began to enclose smaller and smaller spaces. It wasn’t unique to the US - defining boundaries was a practice happening across the globe. Most borders didn’t have a defense other than the physical structure imposed upon the earth, but the disparity of those with resources and those without was severe. There were infinite fights, countless attacks, masses unnumbered in need of protection, and those left of the former team constantly traveled to stabilize as much of the country as possible. They were familiar with responding to aliens and beings non-terrestrial, but the threats to their new world were now almost exclusively perpetuated by residents of Earth.
“Oh, yeah, it’s nice, huh? I, uh, I actually meant
Then, an attack damaged the penthouse, and Tony started sleeping in his lab while repairing the tower.
“It’s already been dismantled.” Her soft, numb, truthful reply was the icy steel blade sinking in, a quick burst of shock, then a burning emanated, filling his chest slowly, completely.
“What is to be our fate, my love?” He traces designs absentmindedly across Steve’s bare skin.
They’re a rag-tag team if they’re nothing else, and they’re all battle-worn and utterly weary. Tony can’t help but think he’s got to be the most wrung-out, but somehow when they all slump into their chairs, the others look worse than he expected - especially Steve, who looks like he can barely stay awake.
“I don’t want to.”
But he stills, stops fighting - it’s useless now, no matter what way this goes, he feels like he’s falling as Tony is ascending, until Tony’s gone. Swallowed by the wormhole.
Hi Sam,
Grinding voraciously, Tony guides Steve to his release, and Steve indulgently reciprocates.
Distantly, Tony wondered if this is what kissing Steve would feel like each time. He already felt their lives were inextricably intertwined, and feeling Steve’s emotions, both pain and joy, was unparalleled. If one conversation and one kiss could bring them both so much ecstasy, he couldn’t wait to experience everything else Steve was willing to share with him, too.
you? Can you still feel it?”
“How the hell’s Bruce gonna fix it?”
“Why the fuck does it feel like home if I never got a say in it? Why do they just get to
The question came as a surprise, but it wasn’t a novel thought. In fact, the very idea was terrifying to Steve, and he clung to every anecdote that could impugn the concept.
All in all, after rinsing the skin and wiping away the dried outline of blood to the best of his abilities, the wound itself isn’t terrible any longer, and before his eyes, it’s nearly finished healing.
Of course that’s what’s happening.
“Don’t come near me, Rogers! I don’t want any of this! You need to leave it alone, stop adding salt to the wound!”
_____________
S. Rogers
Something in the sky caught his attention. It glittered and gleamed, and Steve knew it had to be an old satellite floating by. But his heart leapt just a bit, a small bubble of hope that it was a shooting star. There hadn’t been any since the devastation occurred a year ago, and even though all the satellites had also fallen, it was still a more likely presumption than an actual star falling.
“Tony-”
And most of all, for Tony.
“Ok, what did he say?”
“You’ll still have Tony. You’ll fight for him now, won’t you?”
“No!” Steve surprised them both with his enthusiastic rebuke. “Sorry! Sorry, I mean, no, don’t go, you don’t have to go. I mean-” he took a breath to steady himself. Tony was still curled around him, and feeling the scratchy stubble of his beard against his bare chest was clearly having an effect on him. “I’d like for you to stay, if you’d like it, too. I’d imagine you’re a bit worked up after that, so if I can help you settle, I’d really love that.”
Tony ground his hips against Steve, making his desire perfectly clear. “I want you,” he breathed.
Why was I so stupid?
,” he uttered coyly, snaking a finger along the elastic band of Steve’s boxer briefs.
“I’m sorry.”
“Tony,” he said, easy and deep, ready to take a chance on what he had been building, “did I ever tell you how strong you are?” As anticipated, he saw Tony’s eyes dilate, his body stiffening at the words.
Tony felt himself nod involuntarily against his arms. He didn’t really want to be touched right now, not when the memories of trauma were already clutching him so tightly. He flinched when Steve’s warm arms wrapped around him, but to his surprise he settled into the warm embrace quickly.
“I probably could’ve warned you...but part of me hoped I would have no reason to bring it up. Clearly I underestimated my sleeping abilities.”
“...when I woke up in this era, I had no one. Nothing. You gave me a purpose, somewhere to belong…You gave me a home.”
With a liberal coating glistening on his ungloved fingertips, Steve went to work. He didn’t need to open Tony deep, just wide, and he gently teased at him to stretch him just wide enough. Tony’s vocalizations encouraged him on, but Steve kept a steady pace, knowing he wouldn’t be tempted to give up his control.
Steve shifted back a bit to give Tony some space. He wanted to push a bit, but didn't want to be presumptuous. As he waited for Tony’s response, he felt a shuddered breath linger across his skin.
Spaceships.
Soft light woke Steve from a troubled slumber. He knew it was early, but the exact hour evaded him. A slight pang of panic rose in his gut - he hadn’t overslept, had he? He glanced around for a clock but couldn’t seem to find one. Instead, inconveniently, he found himself to be stuck. To his left, Tony was sleeping peacefully, mouth agape, a small droplet of drool making its escape from the corner of his lips - and to his right was an unforgiving wall, a wall that supplied the solid support they required for their activities only hours ago, but that now felt like an impenetrable barrier, maintaining his captivity.
Maybe Steve wasn’t as fragile and maladaptive as Tony had surmised. Sure, he’d lost his way, but survived an experience unlike anything Tony could imagine Steve would have encountered in his life before - he was even laughing about it now, and willing to try it again. Tony was starting to realize it was possible that the Captain who sat before him had what it took to stay afloat in this brave new world.
“Your wicked persona seems to have penetrated your sensible heart, has it not, Steve?” Tony squeezes Steve’s hand fiercely. “But I forgive you, my love. I’ll always forgive you.”
“Nah, babe, see here? If I carve out just a little from around this ring-” Tony traced a soot-stained finger along a thin, silver groove, “and remove the exact same amount from these two as well, your giant frisbee will still sail through the air just like always.”
The wind left my lungs when he was killed, and I have yet to inhale.
“...he did.”
“God damnit, answer my question, or so help me-”
“No, you’re not,” Steve said fondly. “It’s ok, Tony. You’re safe.”
My mind is an endless space of darkness and shadow. I try to follow a thought, and only echoes remain.
Steve was at a loss for words. He couldn’t wait any more, he had to try it on. Just as he started to try to place it on his finger, Tony’s warm and calloused hand stopped him. “Hey, don’t you wanna wait for tomorrow?” His smile was easy, and Steve felt so safe even when he was lost in those warm brown eyes.
“Tony’s gonna have to destroy the rings. That’s the only hope of restoring the shield and the reactor.”
Steve hadn’t shared a room or a sleeping arrangement with anyone since before the ice. He now only slept alone. It wasn’t his choice, and it certainly wasn’t his preference, but he didn’t complain. His apartment in Avengers Tower was more than comfortable. He’d convinced Tony to make his space a bit homely, and that was good enough. Not enough to cure the loneliness that the 21st century carried, but still, it was enough.
Mortality has a tendency to force a person to accept their shortcomings, and Steve knows he messed it up.
Steve had to look away, he couldn’t meet Tony’s imploring gaze. The ground below his feet began to feel like he was standing on melting snow, giving away when he dug his heels in for support. “...but you, you didn’t know that you, that we…” He couldn’t form the words, the thought was gone.
He’d missed this. He’d missed Tony’s flippant remarks, his sarcasm, his naturally flirtatious disposition. It was the awkward sort of easy he’d always enjoyed with Tony. He hadn’t dared to believe the familiarity would flow so easily.
In an attempt to assuage his growing worry, he consulted Natasha on the matter. Her reply was less than comforting.
help. That’s why I do what I do. Iron Man and all. Help others, the hero gig. But, you know, I’ve never felt it this bad before.” While it was obvious that SHIELD was ill-equipped to handle this situation, when Tony insisted on intervening of course he hadn’t considered the effects of acclimating Steve to his new life to be so personally impactful. Even so, it didn’t deter him. “I wonder if the serum has something to do with it.”
“Why’d they send you? Why can’t Tony ask for it back himself?”
“Then why won’t he see me? Why can’t we talk about this?”
His head hurts. It’s awful. He’s half terror, half enamored with Steve.
“What? You can’t be serious.” Steve was in disbelief.
“The story your mom told you. It’s...intriguing.”
The endearment slips off Nomad’s tongue as if he’s said it a thousand times. Tony’s eyes water at the name he once recognized as his own when spoken by his true love.
With a booming yell in the distance from Hulk, Steve takes it as resounding approval for Tony’s playlist.
Outer space is vast, and after barely tip-toeing across the precipice, he instantly understands how small he is.
“Are you ok? I think you were having a nightmare,” he replied carefully.
“God, I love it when you fuck me like this, god, you’re so fuckin’ sexy…” Tony’s high whines and ramblings were growing breathier and more incoherent with each syllable. “It’s so hot, so
“Oh, you’re questioning
Steve allowed his body to cover the slighter man entirely. In an entanglement of limbs, Tony continued to jerk his hips up against Steve’s imposing frame. He felt Tony’s hands running over his bulky outer armor, almost frantic in their movements. He responded with an eagerness of his own, rolling his hips long and hard against the man pinned beneath him, forcing Tony’s desperate twitches to settle.
“Ah, yes, my young bird friend. I’ve seen Chitauri sabotage similar to this before, and I’d not be surprised to learn this is another of their cruel manipulations.”
In a flash, Tony surged forward, closing the gap, bringing their lips together. Kisses, soft and sweet, quickly turned desperate and needy, and carelessly wandering hands grew from curious to greedy.
“Why am I here?” Steve mumbled before Tony could make a move.
“I’m not doing it, Steve.”
The juxtaposition of a deep, rough voice contrasting soothing alto-soprano singing airily is almost enough to distract Steve from the irreverent words. “This is hardly appropriate right now, Tony,” Steve complains.
Suspense starts to gnaw its way through his stomach and the acid keeps burning at his throat. Finally, he breaks his silent protest in an attempt to ease his anxiety.
he mused to himself.
“Huh?” Steve had heard the question, he just hadn’t formulated a response. He was met with a soft smile illuminated by moonlight that pulled him back to the moment. “Oh, yeah. I guess I should ask Bruce to clean me up.”
“I have nothing to offer you,” he laments.
The words bounced in his mind, but no answer found the question.
“Oh.”
He feels a fumbling and tugging at the blindfold, and in a moment, his sight is finally free. Eyes focus on the man before him.
“Show me.” He speaks the dare into Steve’s mouth, beginning to climb into his lap.
Steve was confused. He'd been gone on an intensive mission for weeks, he wasn’t exactly keeping track of the date while pacifying hostile masses. “Uh, no, I didn’t.”
“Well, I don’t know any different. But I guess, if I’m being
Tony seemed to falter a moment, before dropping his chin and shaking his head. “Sounds like we’re having a good ol’ fashioned slumber party!”
“I know you will. That’s not the point.” He drew nearer to the super soldier, feeling a compulsion to give his shoulder a firm squeeze, maybe wrap his arms around him, bring him into the comfort of a hug. How long had it been since Steve had been hugged?
how I see it! Of course it is! How could I not?” He digs his heels into the earth and pulls back with a force that’s disappointingly no match for his captor. “Why are you doing this?”
“I can’t take this ring off,” he grumbled resentfully.
A shout shook his mind, and he saw a glimmer of crimson in the sky. Hulk leapt to catch it, and as his body caught up to his mind, he ran to where the armor had landed. His heart was in his chest, he’d seen soldiers in his company succumb before, but this, this was different, Tony wasn’t a soldier, he wasn’t a fellow GI, he was different, he was -
And yet, Steve had a gaping void within his body, he knew something had been ripped from his soul, and his memory was of waning reliability.
Tony’s eyes try to follow the moving metal appendage, and his interest is instantly peaked, pulled away from the hole into the counter.
“This is your dominant hand?”
“What do you need? I’ll help you get ready.”
He stopped twice to simply massage the mysteriously painful appendage. Using his metal to massage the flesh a whole new interaction with feeling in it. He grew entranced by the difference in sensations, nearly enough to forget the pain altogether.
Picking himself off the ground he runs for the car. His path is soon blocked by a blur and painful force directly to his chest. He yells out as the burning pain and sting sets in.
Maybe it would stop hurting so much if he would stop fighting.
“Do what?”
“Killian. I don’t want him to find me. I’m not ready to see him again.”
“Oh god, that’s gross.” You say.
“Yes, he staggered, and he bled.” Thor holds up the ax and there’s blood on it. Loki looks it over and nods.
Their shirts were either too tight, or too lose. Having his arms out felt wrong, but having sleeves felt wrong as well. Wearing blue felt too on the nose with his soulmark, but not wearing blue just felt weird, because suddenly it occurred to Steve seventy-percent of his wardrobe was blue!
You sigh heavily. “Maybe I shouldn’t meet him then.”
Dammit. Now Tony wants this. He wants Steve to be right about this.
You smile. “Okay.”
“I can't, what if punch a hole through the wall?” Steve asks, and it’s a serious question. He’s nervous, he can feel it in the pit of his stomach, and it’s hard to control himself when he’s nervous.
“Are you sure?” Tony asks, realizing they still haven’t let go of each other’s hands.
You don’t point out the redness that builds, or how eyes start to sparkle with a small line of tears building.
“Do you want me to stop?”
“I didn’t tell you this yet. But Bucky and I found our soulmate.”
Bucky’s eyes go wide when he see’s it. Steve’s punched a hole in Tony’s perfect marble counter top.
He runs away.
By now the designs and inner workings of that arm were imprinted in his brain. He looked at the still cracked countertop thinking about how he should have called the contractor days ago when he realizes something.
“Well I signed the damn Accords so of course, I was on it!” Tony takes a deep breath. “For the first time ever, the government likes me more than they do you. How’s it feel to be the rebellious problematic one?”
This is singlehandedly the most important thing to Bucky in the world and he’s going to do whatever he can not to mess it up.
“Bucky says you should be happy hearing they’re alive, and to stop looking so sad. He also called you a punk.”
They sit opposite each other, Tony eating lime jello, Stephen eating orange.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Maybe you should stay, I don’t want you to rip your stitches, or get infected.”
When he gets out, he drops down heavily on his bed, sighing relieved. Tomorrow was his day off, just making going to sleep all that better. Knowing he could sleep in put him at ease.
It’s a question he never intends to get the answer to because he intends never to meet his soulmates.
“Hey.” They greeted each other. Bucky looking around the room for signs of Tony.
Bucky is pacing back and forth outside the apartment building. It’s hot out and his flesh hand is getting sweaty, and he wipes the palm against his pants. He knows Steve won’t say anything bad about him, but somehow, he’s still worried something’s going to go wrong.
Wong nods.
So, either bone-crushing depression or arrogance so thick you could suffocate in it.
“What happened?”
The knowledge hits him like a punch to the gut. He doesn’t move, and time seems to slow, just for him to think. It’s a stalemate. If any of them speak, it’s over, they have to acknowledge the time, that the night is done, and they’ll have to go.
“No, he didn’t see me,” Bucky assures. “I thought about knocking on the door but I thought that might be too much. So I went back to the gym and waited for Sharon to take her shift, and I came here.”
Everything was fine.
That was the first time she met Thanos, the man who would raise her to be a warrior, a fighter, and expect it to be love, expect him to call her father.
“Is that all you’ve got?”
“What’d you do?” Steve asks a little warily, wondering how much trouble one can get in for temporarily kidnapping a soulmate. There might be leeway, like soulbond drunkenness, or some form of impatience and desperation. Maybe if they let him go right now it wouldn’t count.
“There’s no way Fury hired that asshole back.”
up too. Honestly, who messes up their own therapist?
“So that’s why my head hurts.” He mumbles to himself.
Another wave of fear coursed through Tony. His nightmare, his fear, it could have flowed into Bucky somehow. What should he do? How does he stop it?
“I’m not cutting myself off. I’ve seen how these things go, over and over. Steve-
He drops his head into his hands and leans on the workbench. Taking deep breaths. If he starts crying now, it’ll take hours to stop. He needs to work, not cry. He wipes a tear from his cheek roughly and takes stuttering breaths as he forces himself to sit back up.
“It looks like it might be a bit more serious than that, but we won’t know until I get some scans.” He held out the stethoscope. “For now- may I?”
Every time he came back to the hospital, a preacher would speak to him. Have him go over prayer to make sure if he did die in the night, that his soul would be accepted into heaven where he would wait for his soulmate.
“Alright Capcicle, let’s find the ghost whisperer.”
Steve quickly gets dressed and waits as Bucky changes his clothes. Three times.
Maybe you’ll make a scrapbook…
I didn't want this chapter to read as team-cap, or team-Iron man. It was a mostly both sides have things to make up for situation, but Tony just needs a little more time to move past it, which he's already starting to do, whether he wants to or not.
“I do believe you own a gym membership, there is one, two blocks from here. Open twenty-four hours. I believe you’ll be safe there. No one is looking for Tony Stark at his hour.”
“I don’t know.” Bucky shrugs. “What could I do?”
You’re tired. Of course, you are. You’ve got voices in your head, chattering at a low level like a persistent bee around your ears keeping you from being able to fall asleep. Your feet hurt from walking around all day. The streets were devoid of people, but not of other cars. Driving was near impossible, so you were forced to walk. You’re in some building that Stephen gave you the address to. He called it the New York Sanctum or something. You had a hard time relaxing. There was a grandfather clock in the hall the echoed with every tick.
These aren’t exactly new emotions for Tony. He’s struggled with them all his life. It seems that’s just how it goes for children with rights to million-dollar companies before they’re even born. Children who live in the shadows of greats expected on day to shine brighter.
“So if you didn’t get reamed by Brock why do you look so down?”
You stand slowly. You’ve just lost the only two people important to you and so has the rest of the world it seems like. So, you go out on a limb and decide to listen to the voice in your head. What else are you going to do?
“Tomorrow.” he whispers. “They're coming back tomorrow.”
“Tony needs help. I don't know who he's running from, or why. He needs support right now. Who better to do so than his soulmates? Besides, it seems there's a lot you need to learn about each other.”
She saw the web of thoughts, memories, and impressions you’d ever had and she combined them all at that moment to get your silent answer, and she smiled, because the answer you gave was a good one, even if you didn’t know it.
Steve: It's not serious, at least we're not sure. It's okay you don't have to come.
He smiles. “Yes.”
Oh god, all he did was run. He just freaking ran from his soulmate!
“Define try. It’s hard to open yourself up for a relationship when you know it can only be temporary. Either they will find their soulmate and leave, or you’ll realize you aren’t perfect for each other. That you’re settling.”
“I mean, if anyone was going to share a soulmate, who better than us?”
“Can you make it not hurt?”
“I hope you have standards higher than fine when it comes to my body and large open wounds,” Tony says from the stairwell. You both stand, Steve moves quickly, helping him down the rest of the steps and to a seat.
“No.” Tony quickly shakes his head. “Sorry, I’m an idiot, I was preparing myself for everything else I completely spaced on scars.” He pulls the stool just a bit closer and sits on it, looking over to make sure his tools are all organized. “It’s not that scars bother me anyway.” He starts. “I have a bunch of my own right here.” He taps on his chest right through his shirt, and it’s not a lie. He’s got a whole bundle of them right there. From the accident and the four surgeries that followed in the years to come trying to repair the damage. He's got others too all over, some accidents in the lab, others he doesn't remember at all, drunken nights that are forever lost to his memory, only light scars to prove time had passed without knowledge. “I didn’t mean to stare.” He mutters apologetically.
“You should know by now there’s always more to it than the news says.”
“Hey.” Steve looks up at the sound of Bucky’s barefoot steps. “Wasn’t expecting you to be up for a few more hours.”
“Tell them to throw on everything they got. Except for black olives. Oh, and I want breadsticks.”
Bucky looks a bit guilty at those words.
“But how? I didn't even mean to.”
“Even a blind man could see that’s a lie.” Bucky huffs, setting his cup down and crossing his arms. “What is it. Come on, talk to me.”
“Must be some special stones.”
“Cap,” Natasha says, stopping him. “She has a point. We have nothing, no leads, no advantage, and even if we did win… it’s not going to bring everyone back.”
“I do not sense him on Earth.” Wong states. Steve freezes, worry building again.
Tony stops halfway through a plastic spoonful. “What makes you say that?”
“Maybe Fury talked to him.”
“Oh, right!” You pull the backpack off yourself and open it. “Stephen told me to get all these medical supplies.” You explain.
“The arm is fine, it needs a few new pieces, and wires. But otherwise, it's in tiptop shape for twenty years of use. I have to get my hands on whatever metal they used to make it. That stuff is resilient as hell.”
fine.” He paused. “Tony, it’s you I’m worried about… your arm- I could feel it- can you please come out, so I can see you? Make sure you’re okay?”
The worst part is that you don’t even know what it is.
“Turn the lights on.” He mumbles into the pillow. Jarvis understands anyway, and the lights smoothly turn on and go up in brightness. Tony’s always jumpy after nightmares, flinching at any sudden movements, even lights suddenly flicking on, or off. He feels silly, like a child begging for a nightlight, or crawling into their parent’s bed because they’re too scared to sleep alone.
“You touched the stones. You control them, how? You are nothing, just another human. A normal one who’s lived an uneventful life. How could you stand against me and do something no one else has?”
This is important, it’s the one thing that Bucky has been thinking about ever since he was old enough to know about soulmates. The idea that someone out there is destined to love you, to fit you perfectly in every way.
“Come with me.” You say to Steve and head out.
“I should get a mold of this and set it out somewhere. It’s almost a perfect impression of his hand. God that must have taken a lot of strength.” Tony says to himself shaking his head, pressing his finger into it carefully.
Tony’s originally thought had been Dum-E moved from his corner and broke something again, in a decision to play with the guests as he sometimes likes to do. But no, he’s back in his corner. If Tony’s eyes aren’t playing tricks with him, it looks like a hand-print almost.
“No. Thanos got what he wanted. He took our king, our people, and he destroyed our land. That’s what he did to the universe.” Okoye looks down, “We lost.”
He turned his eyes from the distracting object and sighed at the small rectangular photo before him. His finger edges the paper sharp corner and he likes the glossy feel of the front. A dash of light glimmered off it. He liked this photo the best of all the ones in his very thick folder. Tony’s gaze was turned right to the photographer’s lenses, making his eyes follow whoever was holding the photo.
Tony’s eyes are already closed but he finds the strength to nod. The feeling of Steve’s hands scooping him up isn’t as surprising this time now that he knows what to expect, it’s easier to melt into Steve’s arms and relax.
The walk back home was quiet and quick. Steve expected Bucky to be nothing but bursting with energy, unable to stop speaking. He was surprised to get nothing but silence from the man. He might still be feeling guilty about the comment before and setting Steve off. But he more than made up for it by putting himself out there and taking the blame. Bucky had no idea that Tony would be so amazingly okay with the arm. Not only accepting it but liking it.
The woman looks at you confused for a moment. “Yeah, he and I both were. Y/n, are you okay?”
He sits in the middle of the couch, making the decision all at once, heart beginning to pick up on it’s own when they take a seat on either side of him. He stares at the popcorn resting in his lap. Ignoring the feeling of being boxed in. Remembering the last time he was on a couch with someone else.
He’s going to have to mop the floor later because it’s slippery with oil. Otherwise he's done for now. He finishes the sandwiches and takes the plate back to the kitchen before he heads to the bathroom. He takes a long shower because it relaxes him and soothes his aches and sore muscles.
Pepper nods as Killian speaks. “I will tell him, okay? Next time he takes my call, I will tell him.”
Getting to Wakanda had been easy, you just called Wong and he’d opened a portal for you just as he did for the others before. You looked around Wakanda wide-eyed, you’d heard about it from the news, but no one had any photos or videos of what the secret nation. But there wasn’t time for sightseeing, or even to help pick up the pieces as others already were. Steve and Tony were eager to get to the others and move on, and you understood why.
“How do you feel?”
“Okay.” Tony can hear the hesitance in Bucky’s voice. Not knowing how to move forward, probably not believing Tony’s words. Why should he when he’s experiencing strong emotions telling him otherwise. Yet they don’t all know each other well enough to call him out on it. Bucky is trying to find the balance or the grey area where they all fit. Tony should probably say goodbye and hang up, but he doesn’t want to hang up, as much as he doesn’t want to be a bother, he wants comfort, he wants someone other than Jarvis to tell him he’s all right. He doesn’t want to be alone, but with someone who he can trust to protect him.
“Y-you’re my soulmate.” Steve lets out. His voice breathless and confused. As anyone would be in this situation. But what can’t be heard in his voice is the immense relief he feels. He’s met his soulmate… and he didn’t hurt them… he saved them from pain actually. This was… this was amazing.
Bucky: You did just fine with me and Stevie.
That’s not going to happen. Tony already knows this trick. He show’s his ID and Killian gets an instant alert for which pharmacy Tony went to, and that makes him one step closer to finding him.
Dum-E made a decent dent in the mess of foam and oil. He sighs when he sees the state of his blueprints and drafts all burned and charred. He's lost a good amount of information but its fine. He’ll write it all back up later. He takes the rag in one hand, sandwich in other and eats as he cleans. Once the oil and foam are mostly up he throws the rag away and moves onto sorting. Burnt and not burnt. He'll copy everything down and make backups later. For now it's just making sure he doesn't leave this huge mess here.
“This.” He gestures to the apartment. “You. Soulmates. It was a mistake to ever think even for a moment, that this could work out. That I could have soulmates and not -- not be me.”.”
“You want to see it?” He asks, looking at Steve uncertain. Tony nods fervently.
“No. You’re fine.” He answers finally, and the hand resumes it’s paused movements and travels up Tony’s cheek past his eyes and forehead and fingers slot through his hair. Bucky gasps slightly and his eyes widened the tiniest bit. Strange how they seemed so focused yet oddly spaced out at the same time.
“Oh my-” Her breath hitches and hand presses to her chest, she leans on the back of the elevator wall. “I’ve missed the sound of your voice.” She exhales. You sound different.”
“Will you really not tell anyone I’m here?”
“So what? You think I don’t deserve Tony? Because if we go by should have died… what about me? I was inches from that train taking my head off too. My leg was stuck in the track. If the ambulance had gotten there any later, I would have bled out. Not to mention all those infections and surgeries I had. How do you know you’re not the back up because I was supposed to die?”
But there’s this connection. Once you find your grove, you become one almost. Like having a million inside jokes. Knowing each other’s cues, and knowing how they’re feeling by just taking one look at them. There’s a harmony, a pattern, that just locks everything into place. That’s when it all feels like magic. That’s when you begin to finish each other’s sentences, that’s when you are able to just know how your soulmate is feeling, even at a distance, that’s how you can tell what they need without them ever needing to say it aloud.
“No.” Bucky sighs into the mattress. “I had my glove on, and the long sleeve shirt. He didn’t see it.”
“It was me. You had gone to the bathroom, and Bucky and I were arguing. Sometimes, when I lose control, I break things. I- it’s a long story, but I have this strength, it’s not natural.” He sits on the floor in front of the couch. Facing Tony. “There was this girl I dated once. I took her out, walked her home, and right as we were about to kiss, I did the same thing to you that I did with her. If I don’t focus, then, I can be destructive.”
“What if what?”
You turn from Steve. “Tony?”
“No, my good one, without any holes in it.”
Bucky snorts.
Honestly, Tony rathers it too.
“What is it?” Tony asks worried Steve might have injured himself in his haste to help Tony. God, why was he always getting in the way and hurting people?
“He kissed me, and I kind of freaked out.” He swallows. “I said some things, things I meant- but- didn't intend to admit. I'm a bit self-destructive.”
The first to arrive was the one the called Bucky. She’d asked him a question, but he didn’t answer, he didn’t acknowledge her. As the others came, she realized it wasn’t rudeness, but they truly couldn’t see her. Or rather all they could see was her. Every apparition in the stone, the wooden gazebo, and the shallow lake that went along endlessly in a skyless landscape was a part of her.
It was quieter here, in this cramped apartment building. Not really, of course, it was louder, walking down halls you hear arguments, screaming, sex, little kids running amuck. This apartment building was full of life, noise and all. Yet, it was quieter than his empty lab. It was the voices, the voices he didn't like that had subsided, the ones of his own making in his head. They still rang from time to time. It came to visit in the ungodly hours of the night. They were sometimes so loud he couldn’t sleep. Louder than the lady downstairs who screams at her children. He prefers the noisy neighbors to the voices in his head. Sometimes he even has Jarvis read him to sleep so he can drown the voices out with noise.
Steve snatches his sketchbook away before Bucky can start flipping through. “No! That’s- no.” He shakes his head. “Get away from me, you stink. Take a shower.” Steve says shoving him away as he reaches for the sketchbook again.
“Maybe.” He sniffs, bringing a hand up sloppy with pinched fingers. “A little? Or I was? What time issit?”
He would find Tony, and everything would be alright.
“I’m just considering my usefulness.” He sighs, she smiles, closing the holographic screen and crossing her arms, thinking a moment before speaking.
“All I see is red Buck.” He squints, and as he leans back he realizes what he’s looking at. “Oh my god! Your soulmark! It’s red!”
Steve met Bucky’s eyes a moment before looking away. He hated this feeling, hated admitting to feeling it, even to himself deep inside his mind. Twinges of jealousy.
“Oh, uh no.” He shakes his head and tried not to laugh at the idea. Literally, the only person in the world he could stand living with was Rhody. Maybe Pepper, but they are not really good together long term.
He’d also taken to apologetically ignoring Pepper. While it wasn’t exactly a big step considering he wasn’t speaking to her much on the phone, he used to reply to her voicemails with messages. Something he hasn’t done all week. He couldn’t, whenever he opened his phone, whenever he began to think about what he would send, he would think about Kilian, his constant pursuit of any and all information on Tony.
When you all get to Stark Tower, Tony begins rapid firing questions and orders to the ceiling, which you soon learn contains the AI you’d spoken to on the phone before. You take the chance to sit and breathe. You look down at your arm and unwrap the bandage. You grimace at the sight of it. You look like a sad version of the Frankenstein monster. You’re sure Steve did the best with what he had, and a great deal of your skin had been torn horribly.
“Over a month now, almost two."
“Where is he?”
“You picked it.” Bucky adds on before Tony can say no. He did come up with this as if he had it all planned out, he should have thought about this before picking something at random.
“He’s going to see it eventually Buck. Do you plan to never take the glove off? Or your shirt? Never let him touch you? Hiding it will only delay whatever reaction he’s going to have.”
“Both.”
Bucky clears his throat. “Yeah, uh me too.”
Bucky's head was shaking, his brows knitted, and Steve realized he wasn't about to get the unwavering acceptance and forgiveness he'd always received from Bucky in the past.
“Not the black ones.” He makes a face as the sauce gets under his nail. “I usually remember to make sure they don’t put them on, but I was kind of panicking, as I’m sure you can tell.”
Bucky steps closer hesitantly, holding his hand outstretched to him, and Tony carefully hovers over his palm with nimble fingers, before touching, almost as if he was worried that touching it might make it disappear.
Tony had been working on a new design for hours, the pizza and breadsticks long gone. His back is sore as he sits up, eyes burning a little at the lack of light in the room.
“Yeah, so? Let’s go, chop chop, Rogers.”
Steve nods, placing Tony down gently on the ground, and pushing him on his uninjured side. Tony groans in pain heavily, and you grimace at the gush of blood that pushes out.
“You didn't want to kiss?”
“Going to sleep?”
“I do have a plan. Find Thanos, then kill him.” Thor smiles brightly as if it’s the best plan he’s ever thought of.
“Who is it, J?” He whispers, wondering if he can pretend like he isn’t home or something.
“You shouldn’t be up yet. You lost a lot of blood, and have a high risk of infection.”
“Yes. I will.” Thor says, clutching the hammer tighter with his fingers assuming a defensive stance. Thanos smiles, standing still looking to the sky.
He was crying.
That made him nothing. No longer monster, no longer champion.
They’re close like this, close enough that Steve’s breath ghosts the shell of Tony’s ear, and Tony can smell him. A little closer and they could be cuddling. Tony’s too tired and too in pain to find himself panicking about it. Not like he did with Bucky. Although it might not be the lack of sleep getting him to the bitter calm it’s most likely the whiskey. He had some scotch, but that was more his fathers drink and he couldn’t take any more reminders of his parent’s tonight so he stuck with the whiskey.
“I was told to link it directly to the suit. Please pass it to him.” Bruce pulls it off and hands it to Steve. “Apparently it’s for you.”
“I’m good at waiting.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony- any normal person wouldn’t have been able to do that to you.”
“Who is it? Where are they? What happened? Where’s their mark? I told you this would happen, didn’t I?” Steve talks a mile a minute, almost just as excited for Bucky as he was for himself. After all, this had been a journey they’d taken together. Ever since ninth grade, just after Bucky lost his arm, and he was depressed, losing a limb and possibly the one chance to find his soulmate.
He looks over at the workbench and see’s the foam still piled up. He’s not looking forward to clearing that mess. “Hey Dum-E, you wanna get started cleaning that mess up?” He points to the desk and Dum-E chirps happily, rolling his wheels moving towards the table picking up a random oil spotted rag and randomly wiping at the mess with jagged movements. Tony smiles and lays flat out, starfished almost. No way Dum-E is going to get the entire mess up, but he could make it less work for him later. Then again Dum-E might also make it more of a mess somehow. Tony’s too tired to care.
Steve snorts bitterly. Brock was a grade school stereotypical bully that never got put in his place and became an adult bully. Or as Steve and Bucky like to call him- an asshole. Since this isn’t high school, and he can’t push kids heads into toilets and shove shoulders in crowded hallways, he likes to do things the only way he can. Abuse of power.
“What are we supposed to do when we find him?” Bruce asks.
Natasha nods. “Sounds like a plan I could get behind. Good thing we’re in Wakanda. They’ve probably got everything we need.”
He can’t shake the fear from the dream despite knowing already it was all fake.
The three-step thought and watch the portal close behind them.
Bucky, similar to Steve, had his soulmarks on the palms of his hands, and one of his biggest fears is that losing his hand, he may have lost one of his only ways to find his soulmate. The other hand still has a mark on the palm, but Steve knows the fear haunts him every day he goes without meeting his soulmate.
Tony: Really? what’s your rulebook got in it?
“Bucky says hi.”
“Yeah, the one who’s wrist I broke.”
It’s bleeding badly. You know the smart move is to wrap it up in some kind of cloth to try and control the bleeding. But moving isn’t an option right now. Not with the thing that did this to you lurking right out in the middle of the street.
She nods. “One thing I’ve seen a lot here, watching kings and queens rise and fall, or anyone ever for that matter, is the fear of failure. Everyone’s had it at one point or another. Whether it’s taking a test in high school, or being able to fill your father's shoes on the throne as a ruler. Whether you have yourself and future riding on it, or you have an entire nation counting on you. Fear of failure is all the same. I imagine your Hulk never met a problem he couldn’t punch away. Never had someone depending on him and lost.”
“Okay,” Steve whispers looking down at his feet.
“I’m not.” Bucky agrees, “But what if he wants me to come up? Or if he comes down to meet me?”
You sit up confused but move anyway. Your body tired, and arm aching with pain on every tiny movement, but you don’t stop. Holding out your good arm to Adam who takes it and climbs off the bed with you. The steps only make the pain worse, and you hiss once you finally get down that last step, you’re having a hard time deciding what position to keep your in is best.
“There’s a knob on the inside. Set to dial back the sensors and pulses being sent to your nerves and head to decrease or increase sensitivity. They probably had it shut off during your healing and set up. Then just never turned it on for some reason. It’s possible that working out so much jostled everything. Turned the knob accidentally. But the cord wasn't connected and occasionally was bumping into other cords. Causing you to interpret the senses as pain.”
“Buck, you look great, come on let’s go.”
He looks back up at his face in the reflection. Knowing who he looks more like when he shaves. The other reason Tony doesn’t like to look in the mirror.
“I do not sense him on Earth, that does not mean he’s dead. I believe Y/n might have had his location. Or at least Stephen did.”
“I hate you.” He groans and gets up. This is going to be awkward as hell.
Leaning forward she whispers in your ear, as she speaks, telling you what needs to be given in order to save everyone, your eyes go wide. Once she’s done, she pulls back.
“In what way?”
Steve does actually smile at that, which tugs something in your chest. “It’s nice to know he’s still there. I was worried I lost him forever.”
“You can tell them anyway that you would like. I’m not here to force you. Do it at your own pace, or not at all if need be. If it were me, I’d like to know.”
“I’ve had someone try to crush my neck before believe it or not, yet they’d never gotten so close to success as he did. The crunching you heard, was ice. I developed a way to build it under the skin as a protective layer.” He thinks it over. “The rest was theatrics and illusion.”
“And you looked for him inside of the couch?”
“Bucky?” Steve looks equal parts hopeful and sad as he steps closer to you. “You can hear him? You know where he is?”
It’s not that the movie is truly terrifying. Still, he finds himself questioning if the succulent in the corner of the room is really a plant or a monster watching him. He finds himself too scared to look directly at it, and too scared to look away. It doesn’t help when the screen flashes bright and dark, making the figure look as if it’s breathing. He clutches Steve’s arm, as he looks at it over the mans shoulder, breathing heavily into the tight space between Steve and the couch, causing his face to sweat as he feels he’s in a furnace.
“I really like the sound of that.” He squeezes Steve's hand. “No more apologies okay? I forgive you. Wounds heal and furniture can be replaced. All I can ask is that you try to be careful, which I'm assuming you already are.” He looked to Steve's phone, how the screen is cracked in all four corners.
By the time he's done cleaning the underside of the desk. The room smells of lemons and bleach. He opens the far window behind the tv and breathes the fresh air and takes in the sounds of the city. It's been a stressful 24 hours. Jarvis was right about sleep. He feels less anxious now. But it's not all gone. His arms sore and his feet ache but it's duller now.
“Really?”
Bucky. God. It’s been so long since he’s seen Bucky. He spent too long apart, and he couldn’t even say goodbye. When he starts thinking about everyone he’s spent too little time with, he suddenly feels a pull in his heart even more. Who else is gone? It could be anyone, it was random selection, right?
“No.”
The week passed at a snail’s pace, which left Tony feeling bored, but also appreciative. Nothing happened, good or bad. Steve and Bucky had back to back shifts, and other things that kept them too busy to come over or try to make plans. They texted at least once a day with something, and Tony was happy for those small messages shared between them.
“Here,” Steve says, pulling a flashlight from his toolbelt. “It should help.”
He’s halfway through his eggs when he comes up with a plan, smile growing on his face, he picks up the phone.
“Thor will help later. But you guys need to find him and tell him what’s going on. That way we can get to him with the time is right.”
But there were gaps the man did not notice. Gaps she could only see. Why? A question she asked herself and the answer flowed through her. She knows could see how it all ended, and she only now had to let everyone play their parts until the moment was right.
“Uh rent.” Tony nods, biting into his pizza purposefully. “It’s crazy.” He says around the bite. Rent isn’t something Tony’s ever done. Stark's don’t rent, they don’t borrow. They own, and they sell. That’s it. Tony bought the apartment, all four apartments. Onetime payment and all he pays now are bills.
You head down the stairs when you hear some new voices enter a conversation. Wong must have teleported him, but it sounds like more than one.
But if Strange saw the future, then there were no maybe’s. There was only what he knows works and he knows what doesn’t work. If Thor is alive like you say he is, and everyone else who faded is alive as well, then he’s willing to do whatever it takes to get them back.
“Guess we’ve got no kind of count on civilians either?”
Steve nods. “Like Bruce.”
“Fix this?” Tony chuckles humorlessly. “Fix what? The world or our friendship. Honestly, I don’t think there’s anything that fixes either options. We’re kind of fucked.”
“I talked to him, sorry it took so long, he was in a surgery.”
“How can you say that? How can you know that? Have you even tried dating?”
“My God,” Steve says to the side. He’s looking at the strands of light spread and even grows to cross your face. Even your eyes burst with the light. Your iris’s changing color. Split in half, one side green, the other yellow.
“If someone comes after we closed up, then we’re going to hear about it from Fury for the rest of our lives.”
Rocket looks around and nods. “I guess I could go around collecting some of that alien tech, for all we know it could come in handy if we do make it to Thanos again. I’m really going to give that piece of shit all I can.” He gripped his gun tighter and began walking off. Scouring the grass for weapons and tech.
“Of course, they wouldn’t.” Jarvis comments.
He enrolled in school later that year. Finally, able to go in public and not worry about catching anything. Not worrying about if he had his inhaler or his backup inhaler. Or his EpiPen. He’d been allergic to gluten before. But now he ate loads of it until his stomach ached, and then all he had to do was wait ten minutes, and the ache was gone, and he could eat even more.
“Hey.” Bucky says a smile on his face is clear, mixed with nervousness and excitement, his hands are tucked into his black jacket and his hair a little damp, a few strands sticking to his face. It was drizzling lightly outside all afternoon, giving the world a misty look and Bucky a light sheen to his skin.
“I’m not actually sure.” Steve presses his hands to the wound. “But I don’t think we have time to find out.” Steve carefully, picks up Tony, doing his best not to jostle his weight.
Stephen said when you see your chance take it. So, you run. Straight into the chaos, the sound of lighting making you flinch the more you get closer to it. The sounds of the ship and Tony’s thrusters above, and Steve’s grunts trying to overpower one of Thanos’ arms.
“Yeah.” Tony smiles. “Just uh, no funny business.” It’s partially a joke. Tony's sure the contact might be fine. But anything else… the last person who’d touched him was Killian and that was horrible.
Tony hadn’t noticed the doctor turn back to face him. He looked at his face. Dark brown hair, blue eyes. He looks familiar, but Tony can’t place where.
“I will cut you if you eat my pie, Rogers!” He calls as Steve leaves the gym.
“You’re my soulmate.” Bucky whispers. Tony looks up at the man. His heart rabbiting, and panic fills his chest. Oh god, he’s going to have a panic attack right here. He doesn’t want that. He wants anything but that. So, he does what he’s been doing for the last six months of his life.
“Yes, sir.”
“Wow.” Bucky whispers, eyes studying every inch of the sketch over and over. Steve raises a hand to scratch the back of his neck and looks a little embarrassed.
Tony nods, and just as Stephen’s about to open the door, he stops him. “Could you- can you send Steve in?”
“Earthquake?” You ask.
“Who is this?” Steve asks, trying not to let his disappointment show.
“I have a day off this weekend if you want to do it then.” Bucky says.
“You lost someone?”
“Then I guess we do have to work together. But that doesn’t suddenly make us friends again.” Finally, he pulls his hands away.
They’ve only just begun to get to know one another, but Bucky doesn’t think he can handle things not working out between them. Constantly Tony is on his mind, his face, that smile, those hands. Thinking about Tony’s hip where his soul-mark rests, the warmth and comfort of a soulmate. He wants to hold him there, hand fitting right over that spot. How he’d like to learn every mark, every detail, every imperfection that mars his skin. He wants Tony to understand that he can and will care for every part of him, and accept him with the ease Tony accepted his metal arm.
“My hands kept shaking.” You sigh. “What if I stabbed him or something and he bleeds out and dies?”
He sways on his feet once he stands and he notices the edges of his vision have started to blurr. It doesn’t matter, he doesn’t need to see. He knows how to get where he wants to go, without sight. In fact, he’d prefer not to see everything around him. Prefer not to pass the spot in the hall where he dreamt Killian had him all over again. Prefer not to see the damage he’s done to Steve, and the way blood drips from his face and he lifts a hand to wipe it away, despite his eyes never leaving Tony. The creases in his brow from fear and concern never smoothing.
“Fine, fine. Whatever. Keep the nudes to yourself. This is good enough for me.” Bucky throws over his shoulder, still smiling down at this image of Tony. Of his soulmate. Someone he’s never hasn’t officially met. But someone he can already feel himself drawn to.
“Did he say how long it might be? Maybe you could get some sleep.”
“So, you’re not heading home then?” Bucky chuckles.
“Couch.” Tony decided after a momentary debate, remembering the counters were messed up and he’s not quite sure he could hold himself up on the stool.
Steve puts the helmet on with more desperation he was planning to show to the room, but he didn’t care enough to slow his moments down. “Put the call through Friday.” It connects and the beeping stops. “Hello? Tony?” Steve asks.
Tony nods, and tears fill his eyes. “I guess huh.”
Everyone was depending on him. Even people who didn’t really know a danger was coming. They were depending on him. Half the entire universe. Billions, and billions of people. All wiped out.
“Would you like to wait until Steve has a day off too? I could easily talk him through the process, he could be the one to handle it.” A bit of an oversimplification of what exactly it takes to handle everything correctly, but it's not rocket science, it would be fine having Steve be his hands.
“Strong pulse.” He looks over you. “No obvious injuri-” He cuts himself off, looking up at your ears. “Got some bleeding in the ears.” He lifts your nose taking a look. “Here too.”
“That’s nothing new.”
Tony’s not doing much better himself.
“Living,” Bucky says.
“If someone runs from you it’s probably best not to chase them down.. Sometimes people need a moment alone to think before coming back to a situation. He probably thinks you’re stalking him, or weird.”
Tony pauses. “Something my mother taught me. Don’t burn bridges you may one day need to walk across.”
“I tried.” You shift again, uncrossing and stretching your legs across the length of the hallway. “It’s just too loud.”
“What?”
Once again, you can hear the voices of everyone trapped inside the Soul Stone. It’s all clearer now. You can single out every single person, you can see them, and feel them. It’s incredible. You take a deep breath and focus, somehow just knowing what to do, you release them all from the stone.
He’s a go-getter. Not that he isn’t self-conscious, or never has doubts. But usually, his want overpowers that. He lives in the moment. Hardly ever truly thinks ahead. It’s one of the reasons he gets into trouble so often. His issue is he doesn’t think, and it’s hard to be nervous when you’re not actually thinking about something and all the ways it can go wrong.
It’s been a few months since Tony has touched or been touched by another person, which is why he assumes the tingling and sharp wave of cold on his hip is probably due to unfamiliar touch, but that doesn’t work the same for Bucky.
That makes you laugh, wiping a stray tear from your face. “Can you tell me how it ends?”
“They’re not dead.” Steve corrects immediately. “I haven’t exactly done a count but for the moment. T’Challa, Sam, Bucky, a tree thing named Groot, Wanda, and Vision… Vision was before Thanos snapped his fingers… so, that might be permanent.”
“Where should I start?”
Tony nods and begins working on setting the panels back in place. “Well, it’s never going to live up to a real arm. It’s all just sensory being interpreted by the electric sensors in panels. You won’t be able to feel textures that well, but as you probably already can tell, heat and cold will be easily felt.”
He hadn’t been fighting off Killian, he’d been fighting Steve, he’d hurt Steve.
But not him. Steve was right, there is a way. They are alive and he was going to make every single one of them believe if they don’t. There’s one definite thing he knows for sure, and it’s that he can’t win this on his own. He needs them. Stephen had said so, and Steve believed the guy. He also believed you. It might be a little of his can-do attitude. But hope and fighting when no one else is willing is kind of his thing. Even if Tony hates him, he wasn’t going to give up.
Tony understood. Or at the very least he was starting to.
“So, what exactly is all this?” Steve asks, gesturing to the workstation. It’s unorganized, even once he did manage to clean up, it’s still a mess from his work only hours ago. It’s nothing like his lab back at SI. That place is immaculate, everything has a place, even if it doesn’t look like it to outside eyes, the mess is calculated. Tony could navigate that place blindfolded and one arm behind his back. He looks at the sad excuse he has been demoted to in his hiding and tries not to feel morbid about it again.
Bucky laughs, dropping his head into his folded arms against the shaky counter top. “No.” It comes out muffled from his arms, and he lifts his head back up before speaking. “Steve and I are just friends. No dating, not soulmates. Just friends.”
The Soul Stone shines brightly for a moment, a slight whine coming from within, and it goes out just as quickly as it came. He lifts the gauntlet up to his face, inspecting the stone curiously. There is much he knows about the Infinity Stones, he probably knows more than anyone alive in the entire universe, but he does not know all. He looks up to the sky and breathes deeply. Ignoring the twinge of guilt in the back of his mind as his thoughts are drawn to Gamora.
“Your apartment’s nice,” Steve says, and Bucky hums through a bite of his pizza.
“Between the three of you, or in your own life.”
“And you grabbed his wrist? That's not how you wake someone up.”
The bullies all ran away in fear, and so did the kid he was trying to help. He only ever got stronger from thereon.
But he never ran from Killian.
Bucky: Then I, as usual, have perfect timing.
Soon your attention to pain is focused on something else. A sharp burning in your skin. You look down at your hand, the left one, and see bright green lines of power burning into your skin traveling up your body spreading like fire. It hurts so bad you can’t even bring yourself to scream, you fall to your knees as the veins spread up to your shoulder.
Steve was stunned but decided to leave it until later. He had to get ready and prepare himself to deal with Rumlow.
“He- they said you died before… he killed you? For the Soul Stone?”
“What?” Bucky asks.
“I did, but- I don't think I'm ready for that. I want to be, I miss it.” Tony looks over his swollen wrist. “I'm just too fucked in the head I guess.”
“If it’s something to do with the arm itself- yes. If it’s a health or body issue, then probably not. But if that’s the case there are some people I can put you in touch with.” He’d proabbaly have to contact Pepper, have her extend an email or call to a few of SI’s doctors and lab techs, he’d have to attach the original files on the arm, and project.
“That means he was relaxed? He felt better?”
“Please tell me there are some doctors left.” Tony wheezes heavily between words.
“Wha- what is it, Buck?”
“Go where?”
“Before we met Tony you were all encouraging and telling me everything will be fine, now you're telling me I should have learned? Make up your mind.”
“Dr. Strange? Where is he?” Steve looks around. He’s heard about Strange during his time away. He doesn’t associate with Shield or call himself an Avenger, but he’s still a help to the world. Shield has kept tabs on him ever since an event in Hong Kong.
He runs his hands over the thin flesh and stops just above his soulmark.
“Everyone goes at their own pace.” Steve's eyes follow his to the wrist. “For me when I move too fast I break things. Maybe if you move too fast... you might break yourself.” Tony smiles, it's small, soft, and it reaches his eyes in a way that has Steve warm up inside.
“How do we even get to Thanos?” Okoye asks. “We don’t know where he is, how to track him, and I think it’s clear we have no advantage in this, even if you give one of your speeches. We are down in numbers, and numbers weren’t enough to stop him. It won’t be enough now.”
Willing your fingers to unclench feels like the hardest thing you’ve ever done. The Time Stone drops from your palm and immediately you feel relief. You don’t even have a moment to recover before Stephen's voice comes back.
“Uh… yeah.” Tony nods. Opening the door just an inch more. Somehow Steve’s smile grows brighter.
“Shoulder.”
“Text him, set up our next date. We could go out. Get dinner, or see that new movie, what was it called? Something with a player? I don’t know, but if you can’t think of something to talk to him about, then you can do that.”
“Rogers!” His voice is loud. “Good to see you.” Steve rolls his eyes before turning and looking at the man.
All you hear is something about a scrawny little punk who kept picking fights with people bigger than him.
“You can’t close a twenty-four-hour gym Stevie, that’s not how it works.”
“Bucky suggests the beginning.” You snort. The conversation has already died down the chatter of voices in your mind. You once again lean your head on the wall, listening to Steve laugh and then begin his story. You pass out not long into the story.
Occasionally Tony would laugh or make tiny comments on things Bucky mentioned or complained about. When the comments slowly stopped coming Bucky listened carefully and could hear the faint sound of snoring. He smiled, to himself, listening for a few seconds more before whispering goodnight and hanging up.
Steve smiles despite the loss of contact. “Fine, we can work towards that. But I think you missed me.”
“Okay yeah, that sounds good. Order pizza- no wait three pizzas. One cheese, one pepperoni, and one supreme. Tony thinks hard about this trying to consider all the factors as if this were coding or sketching new designs. “What if they’re lactose intolerant? What if they don't like pizza?”
” Stephens' voice comes through, layering over the youngers yelling one.
“Yep, and my soulmate’s name is also Tony.” Steve adds on after a beat, and now Bucky looks confused. Steve holds his hands out, and he gasps.
Tony ignores the man from there on and does some lifts. He uses the eight-pounders, making sure actually to work up a sweat. It’s been a while since he did anything beneficial for his health. While it may not be cardio that would be best for him, it’s something.
