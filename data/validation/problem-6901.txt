It takes them about two hours and an entire eruption of both their closets, and one quick trip to the store so Bucky can get a new glove.
“Yeah.” Tony demonstrates with a little movement, bending it just slightly, but he winces. “It just hurts.”
A wave of emotions passed over Steve’s face, some Bucky couldn’t read, but he could guess. The relief was obvious, and the confusion there visible. But there was something else.
“Tony?” Her voice hopeful but wary, a quick fear that something had gone terribly wrong. Would it even be his voice on the other end of the line?
The ground rumbles with the force of their battling before Thanos begins to get his feet back from under him, a good swing right to Hulk’s face has the Hulk flying back several feet. Valkyrie uses the moment to her advantage, pressing ahead full thrusters. Ship careening full force at Thanos.
Tony gasped, snapping his finger. “Oh my gosh, Stephen Strange.” He laughed. “You were the other asshole huddled by the bar.”
Tony’s breaths even out, listening to the sound of Jarvis update him calms him. His hands clutch at the comforter when Jarvis adds on that he’s alone and safe. He only does that when he can see Tony on the verge of a panic attack, and it always helps.
Tony jerks violently when he’s awoken by a knock at the door. No one is supposed to be knocking at the door. The mailman never knocks, and he didn’t order any food.
“Huh.” So, it wasn’t Monday either. Had he slept for a day straight? He laughs at that thought. Like he’d ever more than a few hours. He’ll get decent sleep when he’s dead, which is bound to happen soon if he doesn’t eat. “When’s the last time I ate?”
The ocean beneath your feet rumbles with a vibration in this peaceful world, and just in front of the gazebo, the water rises, taking the form of a woman. One with bright green skin. She steps out of the gazebo and walks over to you.
Anything could have happened when he was drunk. He could have called Pepper, accidentally told her where he was. Or he could have hurt himself. If Steve hadn’t come by, and he really hit his head on the ground, Jarvis probably would have called an ambulance, then he’d end up right back in Killian's world. He chuckled to himself a bit hysterically. After all, he deserved that horrible dream. It was his own sick reminder of what could be if he slipped up. One mistake and Killian would have him, and he’d never let Tony go a second time.
“So uh, how do you want to do this?” Bucky asks looking around the living room like he hasn’t already seen it a few times. Tony guesses he must be nervous, or at least unsure of what he’s supposed to do. He did say he’s never had anything done to his arm, by himself or others. But that was okay because if there was anything Tony wasn’t nervous about it was technology.
“You’re my soulmate.” Bucky whispers. Tony looks up at the man. His heart rabbiting, and panic fills his chest. Oh god, he’s going to have a panic attack right here. He doesn’t want that. He wants anything but that. So, he does what he’s been doing for the last six months of his life.
“I’ve had someone try to crush my neck before believe it or not, yet they’d never gotten so close to success as he did. The crunching you heard, was ice. I developed a way to build it under the skin as a protective layer.” He thinks it over. “The rest was theatrics and illusion.”
“Yeah. It’s hard to navigate through. They have to bring themselves to the surface. I can’t do that.” You look down at Adam and remember what Strange said. “Uh, Stephen said that we need to take Adam to the tower? I have no idea what that means though.”
“I um- I’m fine.” Except Tony’s not fine, he hasn’t been fine for years. His mind is a prison and his emotions are unpredictable and uncontrollable. He hates that he has to live with it, but the idea of making Steve or Bucky live with it? No, that’s horrible.
“Well, you’re getting pretty handsy, making me blush.” Tony laughs, setting his tools to the side on the desk.
“I gathered that from your earlier conversation.” he says, Tony nods. “Would you like me to look them up?”
“Oh my-” Her breath hitches and hand presses to her chest, she leans on the back of the elevator wall. “I’ve missed the sound of your voice.” She exhales. You sound different.”
“If you didn’t you would have thrown the phone away. Instead, you had it on you.” Bruce had explained how he got the phone from Tony and managed to call them. So, Steve knows they weren’t in the tower when Tony realized they needed to call Steve so Tony had to have been walking around with the phone on him.
“You’re asking the wrong guy.” Bucky shrugs. “I’m just grasping at straws. I don’t know how any of this works. But come on. It’s a new bond, we barely know each other. You have to give it time. I doubt texting him a little bit yesterday would have given me that much more of a connection to him than you. If it did then you know what you need to do to get more connected. You have his number text him.”
Tony inhales sharply and stands from the counter quickly, speed walking to the bathroom. “Give me a second.” He manages to yell over his shoulder as he closes the door behind him and turns the faucet on, kneeling to the ground and taking deep breaths.
Steve already knows what he’s going to say. They’ve had this conversation a million times now. He’s going to tell Steve to take it easy, remember the breathing, and not to stress over a few bags. The thing is, Steve isn’t stressed over a few bags. He’s stressed because one day, it might not be a bag that gets sent flying. Actually, there is no one day. It’s already happened.
Here he was fighting his mind alone, and he was failing. It was easier to fight when he had Killian on his side. Not as his enemy. He nodded to himself, deciding finally to face the music. He stood, and unlocked the bathroom door. Steve had been sitting right next to it, eyes wide and face red.
The scans are easy Tony even gets to sit for them. It’s a simple X-ray they take about three images and Stephen finally manages to get him something for the pain. After that comes the food proposal.
He hasn’t drank in quite a while. Not since he lost all this weight, his tolerance might not be what he remembers, he’s only what? Half way though the bottle of whisky before he blacks out. The next thing he knows he’s lying on the floor of his hallway, with a splitting headache and sore body.
Tony nods, feeling numb everywhere but in his wrist, he holds the injured limb out to Steve, and he winces. Skin now a dark purple.
This is important, it’s the one thing that Bucky has been thinking about ever since he was old enough to know about soulmates. The idea that someone out there is destined to love you, to fit you perfectly in every way.
When he passes the kitchen, he notices the mail slid through his door slot. Was it already Monday? He thought it was Sunday, but there the mail was, proving him wrong.
“The Infinity Stones were strong. Maybe simply wanting to undo everything Thanos caused was enough.”
He nodded to himself once finished, adjusting the arm to get a better look further down for any other frayed wires. The moment his hand rested on the arm Bucky snatched his arm out of the grip and nearly fell out of the chair with the force of the movement. .
Stephen grabbed a stool and rolled it a bit closer before sitting on it. “Let’s start with your health. How have you been eating?”
“Why can’t they just do it? I’m not…” You pause, “I’m not even sure what happened, one day there’s an alien ship in New York, and the next day, people are just turning to dust.” You feel tears burn the back of your eyes, memories of your mom and brother coming to mind. “Maybe you should just go be in their heads, and have them save the world.”
He shouldn’t have drank, he knows better. It was stupid and risky. He can’t handle alcohol as well as he used to, he’s lost so much weight, and it’s been so long since he last had any.
The water helped his dry throat but did nothing to clear the dizziness or the aches and pains that Tony was more and more becoming aware of.
There’s a knock at the door and Tony almost flinches. Almost. But he’s got this under control. He can be a functioning adult for one day. Or for at least a few hours while they are here.
“I guess not.” Brock shrugs. “Trying to start on a good foot, you know? I know everyone thinks I’m a hardass but I can be a team player.”
Tony was. He was smart just like Howard, skipping grades, building AI’s. The makings of a next Gen genius. That’s what the newspapers and magazines had said. That was before they died though. After that, the headlines all changed. No longer talking about potential, but tragedy, and after that changed, they started to talk about him. How he’d need to take over, if he was ready, how the deaths of his family would change the sweet boy with a robot best friend.
“I agree.” Natasha knocks on her widow bites making sure they still work and smiles down at the electoral whirr they give in response. Rocket cocks his gun and smiles.
Something strange with the way that man is built. Bucky chuckled to himself, grabbing a cracker to eat as he looked through the refrigerator for a proper breakfast. As he pulled out ingredients he found himself shaking out a sore pain in his flesh wrist.
Steve does actually smile at that, which tugs something in your chest. “It’s nice to know he’s still there. I was worried I lost him forever.”
That's how they worked. They fit each other in times of tragedy. Helping them see the light and keep moving. They also just understood each other. Made up for what the other lacked, they could always lean on each other. Steve’s right. If Bucky had to share anything as important as a soulmate with someone, he’d want it to be with Steve.
“No uh, it’s fine.” Tony waves his hand, quickly trying to think of something. “I’ve uh, got… insurance on the stuff.”
the one who should be apologizing. He’s the one who nearly tore Steve’s eye out, just an inch higher and it would be a lot more than a scratch. Besides. Making sense of it doesn’t matter much at the moment. Tony feels sick to his stomach, his heart racing in his chest, mind clouded and dizzy.
“Hey.” Steve looks up at the sound of Bucky’s barefoot steps. “Wasn’t expecting you to be up for a few more hours.”
It’s not ghosts and it’s not insanity. Tony believes all the things the voices say. He’s telling them to himself, but somewhere along the line, he hears it as his parents. His way of torturing himself. Deciding that he doesn’t deserve to live if they can’t so he makes his own life a living hell.
“Is it Pepper or Rhody?” he asks. Rhody has a knack for talking Tony down from a panic attack, Pepper tends to absorb nearby panic and then throw it back amplified.
It all happened a few minutes after you’d left the house. You just wanted some fresh air and to give the two some space to work out whatever tension you were sensing between them was. You had walked in the direction of the crashed ship. Not that half Tony had been in though, the other one.
You’ve never seen Bucky, but somehow you imagine him rolling his eyes, and shaking his head along with the comment, which leaves you ending up biting back a smile.
Steve puts the helmet on with more desperation he was planning to show to the room, but he didn’t care enough to slow his moments down. “Put the call through Friday.” It connects and the beeping stops. “Hello? Tony?” Steve asks.
His best isn’t a great job. Dum-E is good at cleaning up grease and work based messes, but dishes and silverware? Not so much. Tony sighs, sitting up, getting his balance and walking over, eyeing the counter for a moment.
The first thing he does when he gets to the bathroom after shutting and locking his door is to pull down the collar of his shirt roughly and look at his chest. A breath of relief escaping his lips, no open wound, no blood. Everything as it should be.
“I really like the sound of that.” He squeezes Steve's hand. “No more apologies okay? I forgive you. Wounds heal and furniture can be replaced. All I can ask is that you try to be careful, which I'm assuming you already are.” He looked to Steve's phone, how the screen is cracked in all four corners.
“I was told to link it directly to the suit. Please pass it to him.” Bruce pulls it off and hands it to Steve. “Apparently it’s for you.”
Who knows, the accords might have worked, they might have flopped and been rejected by literally every other enhanced or alien being in the universe and everything could have been fine. No one knows, because the Accords didn’t even matter, they weren’t Steve’s main focus. It was for Bucky, he fought for Bucky.
“Okay, we can check out the top.” Tony nods, turning back, making a few notes on the sketch behind him. “How often does the pain happen?”
“You think I need surgery?” His voice wavered, and eyes widened. “This isn’t a cast and painkillers kind of deal?”
Tony then sighs, relieved, already having forgotten about the pizza, but he still checks the peephole before opening the door.
He looked down at his wrist, dark red swelling slowly getting darker and darker, turning a different shade. Maybe he already slipped, maybe this was all over. Tears built up in his eyes, and his breaths turned short and quick in defeated sobs. He would have to see a doctor, and then it’d all be over. It’s too late, there are no workarounds, no ignoring this kind of injury. Everything he’s done in the last six months to protect himself -over, just like this.
You can feel it. You can feel everything. All of the stones in hand, a rainbow of colors dance across your vision and skin. The stones they give you this connection to the universe. You feel everything all at once, the knowledge of what you must do, and the ability to see everything that comes after as a result.
Steve looks down at his sweaty palms, both pitch black. He’s going to meet his soulmate and touch them with both hands when he meets them, and that scares him every time he thinks about it. He’s too strong. What if he breaks them? What if he clutches them too tightly and… and they explode! It’s clearly not a handshake, no one shakes with two hands, and even if they do, he doesn’t. It’s got to be a grab or a push of some sort, and he could really hurt his soulmate or even kill them.
“Well, it’s not like we had a name count of everyone who was missing across the entire universe. But everyone we knew of is back.” Tony smiles, handing you the warm container, of what looks like chocolate chip. “A good number of them are out there, would you like to meet them?”
“It must be hard.” Stephen nods. “You apparently have a lot going on, and handing not one but two soulmates won’t help you much either. Don’t let the news trick you, soulmate relationships can be just as  complicated as any other.”
Tony turns his face to press against the cool of the tile wall, helping with his headache. “I can’t.” He whispers. The idea of getting up, of leaving the bathroom. Facing the world, knowing he’d have to see a doctor… he couldn’t. Instead, he wanted to stay here and never leave.
“Any attempt at killing me is foolish at this point. But I expected more. You could at least have come up with a better plan.”
Thanos gets tired of this game. He shoots a blast straight up at the ship above, blowing the engine and it spins out of control, that handles Stark for now as he goes after it to save Valkyrie who’s still inside. He’s about to aim his next blast at the Hulk when he catches a glimpse of his gauntlet. He stills, eyes going wide when he sees two are missing. He looks around at the group confused. It’s not possible, no one should be able to remove them.
But there were gaps the man did not notice. Gaps she could only see. Why? A question she asked herself and the answer flowed through her. She knows could see how it all ended, and she only now had to let everyone play their parts until the moment was right.
Then she’d call out to the one named, Y/n, making sure they were ready for what would be asked of them when the time came.
“I tried.” You shift again, uncrossing and stretching your legs across the length of the hallway. “It’s just too loud.”
The horrid image of Killian stealing his heart gone snatched away by the unforgiving force of real pain. In its place was Steve, looking down at him from the side of the bed, a horrified expression on his face. A thick droplet of blood running down his cheek from a fresh set of cuts that Tony immediately knows is his own work.
“That’s okay.” He says, running his hands between the couch cushions until he finds it. “I’ve got a portable charger around here somewhere.”
He’s got three regulars, and a new name for today, all in all, it’s good. Might have a lot of free time if he wraps up quickly. Go home early and talk to Bucky before he heads out for the night shift.
“Hi,” Steve says back, and Bucky can only bring himself to stare. Tony avoids the obvious gaze, refusing to meet it, and instead his eyes drop to their hands. More importantly what is in their hands. Flowers. Specifically, red Amaryllis and yellow Lilies. Tony smiles down at them.
It takes his brain a few seconds to catch up and remember that he should probably be hugging back. Lord, it’s been too long since he’s had actual physical contact with someone. He raises his arms slowly and wraps them around Bucky as well, which only seems to encourage the man to hug tighter, and press his nose into Tony’s hair and inhale deeply.
Bucky didn’t feel right leaving Steve at home with him looking so depressed, but he didn’t have a choice he couldn’t call off this late. Not if he didn’t want Fury to fire him. With Brock back, that was almost guaranteed, although if he worked earlier he wouldn’t be working tonight.
“What is it?” Tony asks worried Steve might have injured himself in his haste to help Tony. God, why was he always getting in the way and hurting people?
“Even a blind man could see that’s a lie.” Bucky huffs, setting his cup down and crossing his arms. “What is it. Come on, talk to me.”
That's why you couldn’t remember your mother, why your little brother's face was unrecognizable. While you remembered Steve’s and Tony’s. Anyone you had loved, and grown emotionally attached to had been removed from your mind. The knowledge of them still there, but the feelings for them all gone. The reason you were healed without so much of a scar left behind. You would never be hurt again. You would never age, never hunger, never want. Inside you would always be emotionally numb. For as long as the Infinity Stones existed that would be your only purpose. Let the world think them destroyed so they wouldn’t come looking, and hide them away with yourself. For what might very well be the rest of eternity.
“Doesn’t it?” Steve stepped forward. “Because I think it’s the reason you didn’t talk to me when you got home, and why Tony was
That was the first time she met Thanos, the man who would raise her to be a warrior, a fighter, and expect it to be love, expect him to call her father.
“He is among the ones we lost.” Wong isn’t a man of many expressions, but he manages to look sad at the words. Only serving to confuse Steve more.
“The explosion on our ship was not expected.” Loki explains quickly. “I didn’t have time heal myself enough to escape, or let you know I was truly alive. I was blown away and knocked unconscious by the force.”
They only had each other, and for years that’s been enough, it’s always been enough. Just having one person who understands, just one person to share the burdens with. It meant the world to the both of them.
“So, what? He gave the order before he died? How are we supposed to fix this? How do we find Tony? Do you know where he is?”
It’s not like he could wait to be saved either. If everyone here died… then Thanos no doubt killed half of everyone everywhere like he planned. Tony didn’t even want to think about who else is on that death count he knew.
“Y/n said that they’ll call us when they need us, what if we’re supposed to give them a ride to Thanos. Think about it. Thor is the only one with a weapon that can kill Thanos, but he has no way to get to Thanos or find him. I’m betting Strange knows where Thanos is.”
Thanos yells out as they all begin attacking, and a red light bursts from the gauntlet. The ground beneath everyone begins to shake, changing. Everything becomes hilled and uneven. It breaks away under everyone except you and Thanos, they all fall down hundreds of feet, the hulk moving quickly, jumping between bits of hilled columned ground collecting and catching everyone he can while you’re left alone topside with him.
“It’s alright. I’m sure you meet a lot of people, and we only met the once.” He leans against the counter. “We met at the charity gala, for the pediatric wing of this hospital.”
“Thanks.” Tony’s says, picking the olives off his slices and pushing them to the further side of his place. He grimaces down at them a little.
Tony continued to eat his eggs, phone resting on his knee he felt renewed with purpose, anxious purpose, but with a flutter of something in his chest. For once he lets himself think this might be alright. He imagined it. Him, Bucky, Steve, all coexisting, happy, here in this lonely apartment. A smile ghosts on his face at the thought.
It’s the boy’s father, at least you’re assuming so. The pain had shot in your head the moment you laid eyes on him. It’s been begging you to keep him safe ever since.
“Okay, come on, sit down.” Steve gestures to the couch, but otherwise doesn’t move. He keeps a safe distance from Tony allows him to go where he pleases. “Okay, just breathe. You don’t have to see him.”
He pulls it out quickly, a very small part of him hopes they cancel so he can just lay down and relax, do this again some other day. He’s surprised to see that it’s a message from Pepper.
He hangs up, and Tony’s nearly asleep relaxed back on the couch, injured wrist resting on his chest.
“You.” Thanos’ eyebrows furrow, his stance stiffens, he doesn’t seem so smug now. “How are you alive?”
Even if he didn’t and it was all fine, there could be other people there. It’s a gym, while they might not pay much attention to him, the chances of being recognized are too great, and he doesn’t want to be seen at a gym five minutes from his apartment. There’s no way Killian won’t find him if that happens.
It wasn’t until he was here, truly free of responsibilities and people, did he realize how exhausting it all was. Now all his time went into Stark industries projects. He dares say his company is doing better because he’s actually introducing new ideas and new items for them to sell and produce.
could say to abate Steve’s fear. Steve saw Bucky on even ground. No, he’s not as strong as Steve but he is stronger than the average joe. They’ve had each other for forever. Bucky is his normal, and his constant. This is new. Tony is Steve’s new, he’s new for both of them.
Her eyes widened in surprise to see it was Tony’s contact, nearly dropping the phone in her haste to answer.
Steve chuckles. “I doubt you could have done that with that tiny needle. I was watching the whole time anyway, it was fine.”
“I’m itching for a good fight.” They both begin walking off towards the door, but Bruce hesitates, how good will he be in a fight without the suit, and without the hulk?
The sounds of Natasha and Rocket’s gunshots disappear and fade out. There’s only the sound of water, you step back to realize everyone’s gone. No- you’re the one gone. This isn’t Titan anymore. You’re somewhere else. There’s a gazebo, in the middle of an ocean. An ocean you’re somehow standing on. You look around and stop when you see Thanos looking around also confused.
Stephen said when you see your chance take it. So, you run. Straight into the chaos, the sound of lighting making you flinch the more you get closer to it. The sounds of the ship and Tony’s thrusters above, and Steve’s grunts trying to overpower one of Thanos’ arms.
“Yeah, you and I might have that in common.” Their eyes meet, and Steve almost forgets the guilt and shame that had built-in him over the last six hours. “I guess it's kismet that I've got a knack at fixing things.”
Life was not supposed to be this way for Tony Stark. He was supposed to grow up a spoiled rich kid with wasted genius. He was never supposed to know real pain. He was supposed to go through life coasting on his parent’s money and good looks, charm his way in and out of several collages, with as many degrees as he could easily wrangle under his belt, and begin a handsy worldwide search of his two soulmates.
It’s how they know you, and understand what you need. Bucky wants that, he wants his soulmate, he always has. He’s romanticized it, imagined it, thousands of ways, each and every one of them special and amazing.
“Just something I learned as a child. It’s quite effective. Even you don’t seem to be able to see past it.”
“Tony needs help. I don't know who he's running from, or why. He needs support right now. Who better to do so than his soulmates? Besides, it seems there's a lot you need to learn about each other.”
You gasp and jump back as he begins walking for you again. Quickly you remember what Stephen said. The yellow is the Mind Stone, and the green is the Time Stone. Meaning, you could control Thanos’ mind.
Somehow it’s still wrong in Tony’s mind. He’s not worth his patience, this respect. Bucky and Steve are good guys, and they deserve someone worthy. Someone with less baggage.
He sits on the bench and eyes the weights, and silently wishes Rhody were there. They were gym buddies. Tony’s never been the pinnacle of health, nor was he conscious about his body. But it was their thing. Go to the gym, work up a sweat go home, and eat junk food.
“I didn’t do anything.” Your voice somehow echoes here, despite the open air. The adrenaline and fear coursing through you dissipated a peace washing over you. It must be the same for Thanos considering he’s no longer trying to kill you.
There goes that voice in his head—one of three. Well, hopefully, it’s just three. It seemed every time a new moon passes. There’s something else wrong with Tony. He shakes it off, moving his legs, his body. He needs to tune it out. He needs to work, it helps him ignore it, and when he ignores them, they go away. He stands pacing over to the workbench when there’s a knock at the door. He pauses a moment. Paranoia and fear set in. No one should be knocking.
“Yeah… I was.” Steve nods, eyes darting around the kitchen to hide the redness that came from the sting of tears trying to surface.
Once again, you can hear the voices of everyone trapped inside the Soul Stone. It’s all clearer now. You can single out every single person, you can see them, and feel them. It’s incredible. You take a deep breath and focus, somehow just knowing what to do, you release them all from the stone.
Steve stands too. Not yet feeling the jealousy and insecurities wash away. “You talked to him more. Yesterday, you texted him.”
The only problem was that they didn’t have each other by choice. It was them, or no one, and that’s not how it should be. They both had soulmates and the concept scared them both. That was because Bucky thought he’d never meet his, and Steve was scared that he would. That he’d touch them and they’d shatter like glass in his hands.
“Hi, I was told to call you. That you would help me save the missing half of the universe?” You chuckle because it sounds insane.
“Cap,” Natasha says, stopping him. “She has a point. We have nothing, no leads, no advantage, and even if we did win… it’s not going to bring everyone back.”
When Steve gets home he's still thinking about it. He had to stop and focus on his job a while, but the idea never gave up the chance to trickle back in.
A kid had seen you from down the road, scared and alone he went to the first person he’d seen in hours. You didn’t notice him, eyes trained on the dead woman and creature. The boy's eyes went to it as soon as it was in view. He screamed, the creature snapped its head up looking right at the boy and charged without hesitation.
But that’s the problem, isn’t it? Instead of being bullied, everyone was scared of them. Too scared to get close, too scared to talk to, too scared to be friends and start relationships. They’d both missed out on a normal childhood, and high school experience.
It fades slowly and you realize the cause, it’s noise, high pitched slowly tuning in. Its voices, too many to count, all overlapping. But one speaks louder than the rest, it’s calmer too, with lots of focus.
You’d met a man named Wong not long ago. Gave him word for word instructions from Stephen. He seemed hesitant to believe you until you mentioned someone named ‘Dormammu’ and his skepticism seemed to fade away.
What he hadn’t expected were the scars. There was a small description in the notes, but nothing that brought the image to life as it was in front of him. The scars started out in jagged lumped lines, and spread nearly to the middle of his chest, Tony suppressed a wince. His gaze lingered too long, and Bucky shifted uncomfortably, sliding into the chair.
“Bring up the lights to one-hundred percent,” Tony ordered. The lights came up, but the ‘Yes, sir’ response never came. Tony already regretted muting Jarvis. But if he undid it, then he’d only go on about health and emotional trauma.
He hated to admit it, even just to himself in his head. But he missed Killian sometimes too, and it’s normal to miss him. Because besides Rhody and Pepper, Killian was the only other person Tony had trusted. Hell, he’d known Killian before he met Rhody or Pepper.
“We’ve got one,” Tony says, revealing himself from above. Pointing his thrusts at him, charged to four-hundred percent, and shooting a large blast at him. Thanos only lifts his gauntlet blocking it with an energy field. Rocket uses that as his chance and begins firing the machine gun at Thanos’ other unprotected side. A few hits actually manage to hit, before Thanos wises up and covers himself completely.
Tony nods, and just as Stephen’s about to open the door, he stops him. “Could you- can you send Steve in?”
Stephen lifted his eyebrow, and set down the clipboard and stood, grabbing the stethoscope off the wall hook. “I’m going to give you a quick checkup; blood pressure, pulse, get you on the scale, you know the works.”
“The arm is fine, it needs a few new pieces, and wires. But otherwise, it's in tiptop shape for twenty years of use. I have to get my hands on whatever metal they used to make it. That stuff is resilient as hell.”
“I’ll need to get some scans of this, that’ll take a few hours. For now, I can give you something for pain. How bad is it, one to ten?”
“Touché.” Tony chuckles. The kid on the couch shifts restlessly and beings crying. “I’ll get the juice boxes.”
“I-” Tony leans up and compulsively runs a hand through his hair. “Uh, answer it.” He clears his throat just before Jarvis connects. “Hello?” Tony asks, head turned up to the ceiling where the speakers and microphones are, he’d probably feel more comfortable talking into his phone, but his hands feel weak and sweaty, so his phone would probably fall out of his hands.
“Yeah?” Tony nodded slowly. “Is that not normal? The arm should be able to feel. Its written here.” Tony looks back to the table trying to find the page with the sensor’s information on it. But a hand on his arm stops him.  He looks back to see Bucky's expression of wonder and amazement looking down at where the metal hand grips Tony's forearm.
You repeat the words, giving jazz hands because this is starting to all sound like a bad plot to a movie. You’re getting tired of not having the answers.
Another wave of fear coursed through Tony. His nightmare, his fear, it could have flowed into Bucky somehow. What should he do? How does he stop it?
“I’ll call you when the time is right!” You say quickly as they step through. Bruce nods, and they wave and say their goodbyes to Steve. As the portal closes you turn back to him.
“Now!” Rocket yells, and Valkyrie takes that as her cue over comms to bring the ship closer and start shooting with all she has to divide his attention a third time. Thanos only doubles his forcefield and Thor roars, collecting all the thunder he can muster and directing it at the titan, as Loki shoots his magic at him as well.
“You’re awake.” She says, breathlessly relieved. Walking up to the bed and reaching out grabbing your hand and squeezing it lightly. “You were so brave, honey. You saved us all.”
You get a calming quiet in your mind, and you somehow just know, it’s time. Visible traces of it anywhere the eye can see. Moments playing out at different speeds, pockets of the past and future, things of import darkly shaded.
Tony shoves the faucet off and throws his shirt back on. If noise wasn’t drowning out the voices then he needed to work. He reaches the workbench and clears off the table reaching for the new designs he’d sketched earlier.
“Hell yeah I’m keeping this.” Bucky takes the picture out of the sketchbook carefully making sure not to tear it. He feels the page between his fingers before his mind catches up with the second half of Steve’s statement and gets a wicked grin. “And show me the others! What else have you been ‘imagining’? Less clothes I’m assuming.”
He raises the gauntlet the lights of the stones powering up and whining. You see Steve come up behind him, he’s finally managed to shake off the creatures and join the fight. The brave idiot that he is, jumps up and grabs Thanos’ arm, changing the direction of the powered charge he intended to seen Valkyries way. This miss allowed her to hit Thanos’ body dead on with her ship, knocking him back off balance. Giving Tony the chance to detach off the half of his nanobots that fly down and wrap around Thanos’ body like chains. Thor charges his lightning and strikes it down on Thanos’ held form, and he jolts in pain.
“I admit it’d be hell for a while. But rest of our lives is a little much don’t you think. Not even Nick could hold a grudge for that long.”
I'm back with this fic, I've been quarantining in my apartment for a week and had time to rewrite the fic a bit and continue on. I don't have a set update schedule (As usual) But I had an amazing friend look over this chapter so for rarity it's lightly beta read!
Bucky nods, pulling his shirt from the collar right over his head in a single smooth motion, not a hesitant trace in the movement. Tony can’t imagine getting naked in front of someone right now, he couldn’t begin to think of doing it with that much ease.
By the time he's done cleaning the underside of the desk. The room smells of lemons and bleach. He opens the far window behind the tv and breathes the fresh air and takes in the sounds of the city. It's been a stressful 24 hours. Jarvis was right about sleep. He feels less anxious now. But it's not all gone. His arms sore and his feet ache but it's duller now.
“Oh, my fucking god.” Steve’s hands start shaking, fear, panic, and anger all fueling him and making his heart beat faster. “God damn it Bucky.” His words come out barely a whisper, and his voice is a few octaves lower. He’s holding himself back from doing anything more. He knows better than to move or to try and touch anything else, in the state he’s in, it’ll only make it worse. “I was doing so good.” He was, he really was. He’d actually thought that he would get through this whole thing without breaking something. But taking a cheap shot like that… now of all times. There was no way Bucky didn’t know that’d set him off.
He looks to the coffee table, candy wrappers, an empty bowl of popcorn, realization dawns, the night is over.
“Bucky?” Steve looks equal parts hopeful and sad as he steps closer to you. “You can hear him? You know where he is?”
He’s so concentrated on the task. He doesn’t notice you until you’re right in front of him. Looking at the stones. Each a different color. Green and Yellow, you need to grab the green and the yellow.
That’s not going to happen. Tony already knows this trick. He show’s his ID and Killian gets an instant alert for which pharmacy Tony went to, and that makes him one step closer to finding him.
“Bucky suggests the beginning.” You snort. The conversation has already died down the chatter of voices in your mind. You once again lean your head on the wall, listening to Steve laugh and then begin his story. You pass out not long into the story.
It's so strange seeing a color to it after all this time. He pulls the collar with his other hand seeing the blue out of the corner of his eye.
“Incoming,” Bruce whispers as he passes Steve heading for the weights. Not that he needed the warning, he can smell the stench of Brock coming close over the smell of bleach.
“Yeah.” He looked at his shoes. “Bucky's on his way. I told him we were here, and about your wrist.”
“If it’s something to do with the arm itself- yes. If it’s a health or body issue, then probably not. But if that’s the case there are some people I can put you in touch with.” He’d proabbaly have to contact Pepper, have her extend an email or call to a few of SI’s doctors and lab techs, he’d have to attach the original files on the arm, and project.
Steve and Tony left the townhouse to find after about twenty minutes once they realized you were gone. At first, it was clear you were just giving them space, but Tony was anxious for answers from Stephen himself, and for proof, which he could only get through you apparently. Steve was content to just wait, maybe try and catch up with Tony some more. But that seemed to be the very opposite of what Tony was up for, understandably, there were more important things going on, and from the sound of it, Stephen said there was a sort of time limit to all of this.
When the movie ends and the lights are on, Tony’s eyes land on the succulent and he breathes easier when he confirms its plant status. He spares Steve a slight apology as he detaches from him, and from Bucky.
Your head is leaned back against the wall, and you’ve almost fallen asleep a few times. You’re sure you look the very definition of tired. But staying asleep was hard.
It’s barely a five-minute walk to the gym, which Tony is grateful for because he’s already feeling winded by the time he steps through the automatic doors.
Stephen's voice yells through your head, but you can’t reply, you can’t call for help, you almost feel like you can’t move.
“Yeah, it’s pretty much habit by now. There are lots of fires in this apartment.” He chuckles to himself thinking back to some of them. He’s got a tiny mark on his wrist from one a few weeks ago.
“It is alright Sir, I understand that you sometimes need space. Even from me.” The AI replies for the first time in hours. Tony still doesn’t understand how he managed to code compassion and empathy into his AI but he’s damn grateful for it sometimes.
They don’t go back to the room to eat, instead, they sat in Stephen’s office. The door locked behind them to keep from getting unwanted visitors. Tony didn’t get the sense that Stephen uses the lock often but he’s grateful for it.
The question only serves to snap him out of whatever hope and happiness he’s managed to build. This won’t work out. It can’t. Telling them who he really is… that’s not something he ever wants. For more than one reason.
It’d turned and shot its tongue at Steve, although not expecting it, he was quick, stepping back, and catching the tongue in his hand regretting it as the pricks dug in and tore. Instead of letting go, or allowing himself to be pulled. He yanked hard.
Tony looks up at Steve hesitantly, and sighs. “I can’t do the soppy reuniting right now Cap… I- I’m not mentally prepared.”
“Both.” Tony shrugs. He knows Obie would have called this a hobby. Anything other than building weapons is a hobby in that man’s eyes. But to Tony this is work. Ever since he turned eighteen and gained full control of Stark industries it’s been work. They haven’t sold a single weapon or made a weapon design in over ten years and he’s damn proud of it, even if Obie keeps trying to push him into starting it up again. “I’m an engineer.” He says, leaving out the fact that he’s technically a lot more than that.
“Hey Pep. How’s it going?” His voice was easy, but thin. That didn’t stop the smile from blooming on her face.
You didn’t answer. How could you with all the screaming and pain.  But something happened in the palm of your hand, a bright light that burned hot. The creature had screamed at that. Unhooking its tongue from your arm and running as if you’d hurt it somehow. You looked at your palm in confusion light fading immediately, and Stephens' voice came back along with all the others in the background.
“Turn the lights on.” He mumbles into the pillow. Jarvis understands anyway, and the lights smoothly turn on and go up in brightness. Tony’s always jumpy after nightmares, flinching at any sudden movements, even lights suddenly flicking on, or off. He feels silly, like a child begging for a nightlight, or crawling into their parent’s bed because they’re too scared to sleep alone.
He stopped twice to simply massage the mysteriously painful appendage. Using his metal to massage the flesh a whole new interaction with feeling in it. He grew entranced by the difference in sensations, nearly enough to forget the pain altogether.
As you get older and see a few soulmate bonds in action you realize it’s not as magical as you think. There aren’t sparks. There aren’t explosions going off when you finally touch. Things aren’t easy.
Tony ignores the man from there on and does some lifts. He uses the eight-pounders, making sure actually to work up a sweat. It’s been a while since he did anything beneficial for his health. While it may not be cardio that would be best for him, it’s something.
Tony looks at the man’s hands, and his eyes go wide at the color change. He lifts his shirt and examines his hip. Sure enough, the handprint on his hip had turned a dark red too.
Bucky, similar to Steve, had his soulmarks on the palms of his hands, and one of his biggest fears is that losing his hand, he may have lost one of his only ways to find his soulmate. The other hand still has a mark on the palm, but Steve knows the fear haunts him every day he goes without meeting his soulmate.
“Let me see your hands.” Tony scoots forward. Steve lifts his palms up. Both of them flawless, without a scar or mark on them. The metal arm coming back undamaged was believable, but his hand. That’s very strange. Tony chuckles. “So what are you? Superman?”
As soon as Steve gets home he showers. He’s got to be careful with the handle because one too many times of rough handling on his part, it’s now connected with six layers of duct tape, and wobbles whenever the water is running. He only every uses hot water, he hates the cold.
“Good afternoon sir, it is one-twelve in the afternoon. You’ve slept two hours and have not eaten for fifteen hours.” Jarvis’ voice comes down, fully pulling Tony out of his sleep.
“How do you know?” You ask, “How do you always know what’s going to happen before it happens? How do you know where I should go and where I should be? How do you know it’s going to work?”
“I don’t know either.” You flex your fingers as your wounds itch in your hand and up your arm. The painkillers you took are working heavenly, but the drying blood is starting to bother you. “I asked Stephen, and he said it’s because he saw me standing at the front of it all when we win. I don’t know why, or how. But I was there when he saw it.”
“Thank you.” She smiles, but it quickly drops when she checks the time. “Oh Tony, I have to go, I’ve got a meeting.”
He says you don’t even know if he’s real, or if he’s a figment of your imagination, but he saved your life, which kind of makes you more than willing to listen.
The rest come, introducing themselves, giving their own versions of thanks and praise. Superheros, aliens, and plain old humans. By the end you're tired. Even without injuries and scars, you feel fatigued. Stephen has everyone clear out to give you a break for the night.
As the other’s come into view, so do the number of voices. Black dots appear in your vision and your eyes roll back. You barely register the feeling of gravity pulling you down as you fall, too caught up in the voices all yelling speaking over each other. You black out with the force of it.
“Want to know an interesting thing about this arm?” He lays his hand gently on the arm, fingers tracing the grooves. “These panels are designed for easy matinence. Cleaning, repairing, upgrading, the works. They pop out and right back in. With their simple design I could easily make new ones.” His fingers dig right around the one on the very tip of his shoulder, he lifts it, and then slides it out of place with two soft clicks. “On the sides of each panel are two little connectors, they control latching and the movement. That’s why your arm is so lifelike and fluid. They don’t need to be detached for cleaning or fixing it up, unless of course, they’re what’s causing the issue. Which I doubt.”
Steve smiles and crawls across the hall scooting down next to you, and the heat coming from him is almost alarming. But you don’t mention it.
When Steve sets him down on the bed, lifting the blanket and setting it over Tony whispering a goodnight, and when he turns to leave, Tony reaches out grabbing his arm and quietly, like a secret, he asks Steve to stay. That's the last things he remembers before he drifts off into sleep.
“That’s not good.” He states, as the strange looking aircraft of some sort breaks off in two pieces, one of them on fire the other spinning rapidly, toward the two of you. Honestly, you’re not sure which half was safer to be on.
Bucky’s eyebrows furrow, confusion setting in. “You expect me to drop my soulmate because you’re not ready to be kissing? What kind of guy do you think I am? I can wait.”
“Actually Sir,” Jarvis says. “In the bottom of the first file, you will see that your father had a partner on this project. An Arnim Zola.”
But this isn’t annoying in the slightest. This is amazing. The only other person who touches the arm is Steve, and that’s only sometimes, maybe accidentally, or sometimes trying to help with the pains by relieving the pressure, or helping him stretch when he’s tired.
“You’re back. Is everyone back? What happened? I don’t remember anything after I tried releasing everyone.” You say, thinking back trying to remember how you got back here, to what you’re pretty sure is earth. How you’re still alive, and if you were successful.
“I get it though,” Bucky says after a moment. “I wish he was here right now, sleeping on our batty old couch, or at least, I was there with him. I feel like I want to protect him or something. At the very least, I just want to smell him again. He smells nice.” Bucky smiles. Steve nods.
It makes him almost not want to stay. He’s all for the lack of people, but now he realizes how much he stands out in an empty room. He doesn’t like standing out. Not anymore.
“Hey.” Bucky parrots back in a graveled voice. He sounds tired. But then again, Bucky always sounds tired; it’s just sort of his whole thing. Everyone finds Steve sunny and chipper and Bucky doomy and gloomy.
“W-where is it?” You try to breathe out, your head feels heavy, all of you feels heavy honestly. Your heart is beating way to fast, and your skin feels so cold.
The knock at the door offers him an escape from thinking about it. He pulls the door open and can’t help the smile on his face when he sees them both carrying two bags each.
“Yes.” He nods, reaching his hand out to help you up. You take it, and don’t let go until the room stops spinning.
You didn’t hesitate to listen, reaching for the boy and picking him up with your uninjured hand you ran into the nearest store you could find, closing the door behind you and hiding under the counter.
“If someone runs from you it’s probably best not to chase them down.. Sometimes people need a moment alone to think before coming back to a situation. He probably thinks you’re stalking him, or weird.”
Tony looks, and it does, in fact, say that. “Huh. Since when did my father share his projects? Or at least publicly claim he had help?”
Bruce left earth so he could help. He left so he could stop destroying things.  So, people would praise him instead of stop being the monster.
Bucky snorts. “Bruce isn’t shy. He’s just got some severe OCD. He doesn’t like when people touch his stuff or him. He’s got his own way of doing things.”
The sun sneaking its way through a single crack of the shades landed directly in Tony’s eyes, and as it woke him from his sleep, he wondered if it was on purpose. He groans deeply, turning away, flipping over, but the pillow is cold on this side, and he grimaces. It’s always so cold here. He finds himself no longer tired. His eyes glance at the clock on his way out of his room. It’s two-thirty in the afternoon, yet it feels much earlier. He should have gone to sleep when Jarvis suggested it. That was what, at three in the morning? Tony isn’t sure. He barely sleeps anymore anyway. All he has are his projects.
“No.” Steve says, his eyes are pointed up at the sky and you follow his gaze. Suddenly you realize why Stephen told you to wait here. The two of you have a perfect view of something flying down from the sky, so fast and hard it’s causing the ground around its entry to rumble.
Steve bent by the bed and gently pulled the bandages off. They were very bloody. He’d done his best to clean you up, but the sheet and your shirt were covered in blood. The smell of iron was strong.
“Alright.” He walks over to the small counter in the corner of the room, a clipboard sits there, a small stack of pages on it that Tony can’t read. The doctor pulls a pen from his best pocket and begins writing in quick small movements. The scratches of pen on paper are the only noises that fill the room. Tony couldn’t think of anything else.
“Hi, uh… this is going to sound really weird. But my name is Steve, and I work at the gym, not far from here.” Steve hesitates, this is really weird. “A friend of mine was working last night, and he’s your soulmate.”
Tony nods and begins working on setting the panels back in place. “Well, it’s never going to live up to a real arm. It’s all just sensory being interpreted by the electric sensors in panels. You won’t be able to feel textures that well, but as you probably already can tell, heat and cold will be easily felt.”
“So, what do we do now?” Rocket asks, picking up blades of grass and squeezing them between his fingers. “I’m not exactly good at sitting on my hands and waiting for the action.”
Steve was stunned but decided to leave it until later. He had to get ready and prepare himself to deal with Rumlow.
Steve sighed, deeply enough Tony stirred, beginning to wake. He quickly sent out the room number and reminded him which entrances to use before sliding the phone into his pocket.
“You got the only two flowers in existence that I’d recognize just by looking at them.” Aside from roses, and sunflowers. But these flowers- they actually mean something to him. “The Amaryllis are my favorite, and the Lilies are my mom’s favorite. Well, were.” He meant to correct that in his head, but he’s talking and it comes out anyway.
But if Strange saw the future, then there were no maybe’s. There was only what he knows works and he knows what doesn’t work. If Thor is alive like you say he is, and everyone else who faded is alive as well, then he’s willing to do whatever it takes to get them back.
“He’s tiny… I thought he might have fallen in?” Tony shrugs, looking around the room again. Steve looks down the hallway at the door. It’s closed, and he hadn’t heard anyone open it. But he also didn’t hear the kid get up from the couch so he could be anywhere.
Tony’s tired of talking about his emotional trauma. He plugs the soldering iron in and begins grabbing everything else he needs.
He places his gym card on the counter, pretending to search for something in his pockets. It’s much easier than explaining that he doesn’t like being handed things. He also doesn’t like being touched, but the two are for different reasons. The man takes it and runs it under the keycard reader.
“This is fine.” He takes a deep breath. Honestly, Bucky had been excited that he’d have this time alone with Tony, which makes him feel a little guilty about it, in hindsight considering Steve’s already feeling like they have a stronger connection. An insecurity Bucky could see himself having if the situation were flipped. But that doesn’t stop him from wanting what he wants, and that’s to get to know his soulmate and share time with him.
“No, please don’t.” Tony shakes his head, cutting Steve’s apology off. “I just- I need to-” He points out the hall, and leaves, hoping the action speaks for itself, because words are failing him at the moment.
“I’d rather not.” Tony’s voice is quiet, and he fidgets with his pant leg needing something to do with his uninjured hand.
“Sir, it is eight-twelve in the morning, you have been asleep six hours, you haven’t eaten in ten hours, you are safe and alone.”
Tony was alone. Truly for the first time he felt emptiness. Before this, he would have sworn he felt it. He would have been wrong. He didn’t even notice how or when Nebula left, but it seemed she found something better to do than sticking behind. Stuck, stranded, alone on Titans desolate surface, he heard nothing but silence and the whistling of the wind. But in his head, he replayed those last moments. Peter crying in his arms.
It’s probably sad he couldn’t consider his parent’s voices for it, but now those voices torment his thoughts, waking and subconscious.
“That’ll stop all the food from going bad.” He doesn’t mean to imply that he intends to have them stick around, or even move in or whatever the hell else it might sound like he’s implying. But it’s true anyway. Food tends to last so long in this apartment that it often goes bad. Never will he forget the smell of the rotten lettuce that sat in the back of the fridge for a whole month. He opens the boxes and walks around the counter grabbing plates and cups for the three of them.
He pulls his shirt over his head and drops it to the floor. You could just barely see the faint outlines of his ribcage if he moves they only gain a better impression on his skin. His arms are so thin, they look like they could snap like twigs. His hips are bony and curved just over the bone.
He mentally chants to himself, he isn't fighting for Tony, he has a soul-bond to them both. It just hurts to consider, because if it were one, he is falling flat on his ass in second.
You gasp awake, in a hospital bed, the beeping around you rapidly increases as some of the cords get ripped from the sockets due to your movements. The sound irritates your sensitive ears and growing headache until it’s swiftly shut off by someone next to you.
About how you were bouncing your baby brother in your hands when your mother had called out your name. How you turned to see her fingers already missing, stretched reaching out for you. Then when you clutched your brother tighter and his body gave away with the wind.
“Lock the doors, J.” He whispers to the air. The three clicks locking into place give him some relief. He lays down on the carpeted floor. Thankful for its softness but knowing it’d make no real difference to him as exhausted as he is. He’s slept on his workbench regularly; the floor is an upgrade. “Also unmute. Sorry about that buddy.”
Steve: Hey Buck, Tony and I are at Metro-General. There was an accident, and Tony's wrist might be broken. We've got Stephen looking at it, we'll know more in a bit. Just wanted to let you know.
“Fire!” Steve yells, and a split second later there are three large pops in quick succession. Tony turns eyes wide, the oil made it to the soldering iron and boom. Fire spread out on his desk large sparks and mini-explosions going off. Tony’s got too many accelerants and fire hazards in his apartment. It’s spreading too fast. There’s another spark, and a few pieces of metal fly off in Tony’s direction, and next thing he knows is a heavy force on his shoulders knocking him down out of the way.
Fear of rejection was no foreign concept to Bucky, for years he had a fear of rejection, most of which revolved around his arm, others being how he waited for his soulmate. There were crushes, a date or two, but he never tried, never committed, he was always waiting for his soulmate and he was scared his soulmate wouldn’t want him because of the arm. He couldn't have been more wrong, and what an amazing thing to feel, the object of your fears being the thing that gets you in the door to the next step of your life. Then you step in only to find out there’s something else entirely holding you back.
Gripping himself through his pants, he groans lowly, not daring to be any louder knowing Steve’s good hearing. He bites his lips to prevent any more sounds, continuing to squeeze and release pressure. Thoughts all of Tony,
Steve snorts bitterly. Brock was a grade school stereotypical bully that never got put in his place and became an adult bully. Or as Steve and Bucky like to call him- an asshole. Since this isn’t high school, and he can’t push kids heads into toilets and shove shoulders in crowded hallways, he likes to do things the only way he can. Abuse of power.
He takes his hands back and tells himself he’s not going to make Bucky sit down and go through what would probably be a very long and invasive checkup of his arm because that would be weird.
“Let’s go home.” He says, and Bucky’s eyes go back up to the building, and Steve gets it. The want, the pull. Out of all his fears and waiting, he never considered having a soulmate that seemed to be avoiding them. He’d give himself the benefit of the doubt and look on the bright side, like at least Tony didn’t run this time. But then again, they were in his apartment, there wasn’t really anywhere to run to. “Tomorrow.” Steve reminds him, and Bucky smiles.
Steve had been adamant, determined that if against all odds he managed to survive and live another day passed all those illnesses, that Bucky would find his soulmate with just the one arm. For the last twelve years, he’s done his best to tell him that every day, and now right here, in front of his eyes he see’s Bucky actually did meet his soulmate, it just gives him a swell of pride in his chest. He was right, there is hope in the world, all you have to do is believe.
He doesn’t answer, as you watch, the forcefield fully breaks, and Thanos and the Hulk are fighting. Punches were thrown, body slams. Everyone around steps back, trying not to become collateral damage or accidentally hit Hulk in the process of bad aiming.
“Good.” The bracelets stop their beeping and he puts them on. Looking over them. He looks up to you. “Nanobots, for my suit. I didn’t have enough last time, but I’ve got more now.”
“You can sleep if you’d like,” Steve says, the two of you are sitting on opposite sides of a small hallway in front of an open front door. Strange gave you the address and told you to leave the door open and keep an eye on the skies, although it could be a while. You’re not even sure what you’re supposed to be watching for, or how this helps you find Tony.
“We need to stop the bleeding.” He says. He’s gotten some lessons in quick medical fix-ups from Natasha over the years. That fact that he heals the most on missions, means he’s most likely to be the only one able to take care of everyone else. But this seemed above those tiny lessons he got.
That gets Tony pushing up out of bed, he quickly pulls the door open grabbing the brown box where it’s set off to the side and he brings it in, doors click locked by Jarvis, as Tony sets it down on the unstable counter. He decides he’ll eat while it dries as he begins to open the package.
Tony’s got a hand slapped over his mouth his face tingling from the kiss still, and his eyes are firmly looking to the ground, too scared to look at Bucky, worried he might see Killian standing in his place.
“I-” His heart rate began to pick up. “I went over to check on him, and he asked me to stay.” He shrugged his shoulders, feeling smaller.
No one ever wants to touch the arm. Well, at least they’ve never asked, and they’ve never tried. They just sort of stare and try not to mention it. Except for the few people who ask too many questions about it. That’s equally annoying.
But not him. Steve was right, there is a way. They are alive and he was going to make every single one of them believe if they don’t. There’s one definite thing he knows for sure, and it’s that he can’t win this on his own. He needs them. Stephen had said so, and Steve believed the guy. He also believed you. It might be a little of his can-do attitude. But hope and fighting when no one else is willing is kind of his thing. Even if Tony hates him, he wasn’t going to give up.
Tony steps to the side and allows them in. They take their shoes off by the door and pass to the living room and set their things down on the coffee table. Tony let himself linger just a moment, looking at the two sets of shoes. They hadn’t done that last time. They hadn’t gotten comfortable.
His eyes trace exposed skin, starting from the low resting of his jeans, up over his navel, the defined abs, the pecks. It’s hard not to have that working in a gym as a trainer Tony supposed, he was surprised to see it.
Bucky would be at work right now and probably wouldn’t see any text from Tony until he got home in the morning. So, he would wait, ask him about it tomorrow if he could work up the nerve.
“I think we have to hurry.” You say. Stephen wasn’t rushing you, but there’s this feeling, something in the back of your mind pulling you to get this done quickly and move onto the next step. Not that you’re sure what exactly the next step is.
“What do we do?” She asks. It’s the question everyone’s been asking because they’ve got to fix it. They have to. The world, the universe… it’s depending on them. They can’t let it end like this, they can’t just lose.
“Stevie! Steve!” Bucky calls, pushing his door open and walking over to the bed. Steve groans and sits up. He knows there’s not a fire, and it’s not fear in Bucky’s voice. It’s more like excitement.
He remembers how Jarvis would sit in the basement with him for hours while he worked on projects. He’d stand off to the side, sometimes passing Tony tools. Talking to Jarvis about his wife and family. Jarvis' voice was always there, explaining, asking questions, giving praise. His voice was calming, and its why Tony chose Jarvis’ voice for the AI. By god, it was a great decision. He couldn’t imagine anyone else’s voice calming him now like this.
“I’m fine- or, not fine I guess. I’m not dying I suppose and it doesn’t hurt much, unless I move it.”
“Text him, set up our next date. We could go out. Get dinner, or see that new movie, what was it called? Something with a player? I don’t know, but if you can’t think of something to talk to him about, then you can do that.”
“You saw the way he reacted to your arm. He liked it, he wanted to touch and look at it. I could see the look in his eye. He wanted to do more but held back. There’s no machine on me. I’m crap with technology, and with people. I break everything. Who would want that burden? There’s no off switch for me. There no technical difficulty that an engineer might be able to fix. I’m stuck like this, the freak. You have a metal arm, but I’m forever changed on the inside. How could he want that?”
Tony realizes that’s why they aren’t talking. Goodness, he’s such an idiot. He literally ran from one and the other he practically ushered out of the building. They’re waiting for him to not act like mental case.
Tony sighs, closing his eyes, rubbing a hand over his face a few times. The feeling is comforting as much as it is simple.
Ever since he was a kid he’s been seeking approval from the people around him. Always needing confirmation or reassurance. Which may or may not be normal for a child. Almost all kids look up to their parent’s and hope to be just like them, or better.
He begins a new sheet of paper, drawing up his own design, new parts keeping some of the old. He smiles, feeling a swell of pride for his father and this man Zola. They build something meant to last and it really did, considering Bucky’s had it twenty years. He’d love to get his hands on that arm, see what it looks like with wear and tear, what parts are still fully functional and what parts need to be replaced, tightened, or at the very least cleaned.
“I can't, what if punch a hole through the wall?” Steve asks, and it’s a serious question. He’s nervous, he can feel it in the pit of his stomach, and it’s hard to control himself when he’s nervous.
He knows why. It's the anticipation and anxiety. It's the nightmares. The nightmares are the worst. Always reliving that night over and over again.
Bruce looked up. “How do you suppose we do that.” Natasha steps forward, digging into her pocket pulling out smelling salts, snapping it right under your nose. You inhale it seconds later, and you get a rush, lungs drawing in more air on reflex in reaction, snapping you into consciousness.
He stands from the floor carefully, moving slow, because of his headache and soreness, but also because he’s worried. Who knows he’s here? There’s no way Pepper or Rhody found his location, even if they did they’ve been respecting his silence, his distance. Even if they don’t know why the understand the need to get away from it all sometimes.
Tony smiles. “While I’m sure the flesh one is just as amazing, yes, the metal one. I just wanted to take a peek inside. It’s totally okay if you’re uncomfortable with it, I won’t ask again, I promise.”
They just stay like that for a few minutes, then Tony remembers Steve and this might be getting awkward for him to just watch. He loosens his arms and Bucky tightens his just a fraction before letting go as well and stepping back.
“I’ll be fine. If we miraculously get into a fight or have to do something more physically straining than walking, I’ll let you handle it by yourself.”
The movie went on, and Tony slowly tried to sink himself more and more into the couch and away from the TV as much as possible. At some point he managed to push himself
It could be that he overcompensated on drama, he picked a too stressed situation and made it worse. Because Tony ran. Which wasn’t new. Tony always ran in some form or another. Ran back into his mind, ran from the press, ran from being himself. It was a deep hate buried within the heart of Tony’s chest, and it beat poison into his veins along with blood. Hateful words of doubt and shame.
“I mean most of it was as the Hulk, and I was alone for a good potion, but yeah, I spent a lot of time with him.”
” You nod because it makes sense. You were headed for the broken half of the ship when you’d seen it.
Tony smiles on the other end and she can practically hear it in his voice. “Bye Pepper, it was nice talking to you. Don’t be late, give Rhody my love!” He hangs up laughing before she gets a chance to respond. He smiles down at his phone, and the weight of it suddenly seems too much. The distance between them too far. He lets it slide from his fingers and fall to the floor.
“You touched the stones. You control them, how? You are nothing, just another human. A normal one who’s lived an uneventful life. How could you stand against me and do something no one else has?”
“What trick is this?” Thanos asks, finally giving Thor the threat assessment he deserves. A mirage of Loki appears beside him.
He never wanted soulmates, never prepared for this outcome, and now it’s here, at the worst of times. He has to deal with it, doesn’t he? It seems wrong to just do nothing, or to abandon them.
“Why do you focus on the one failure? Every day you show restraint, every day you see and work with people none of which you hurt. I understand the fear of not bein’ in control of yourself. I understand you more than anyone else could possibly begin, but you gotta see how much good you do. If you focus on the bad of course you’re going to feel bad. That’s just how it goes. You can’t start doubtin’ yourself, and your soulmate. Your hope and unwavering will about this was the only thing keeping me sane when I thought I wouldn’t ever meet mine. Don’t lose it now, please. We both need it, and maybe so will Tony.”
You and Steve both take a step back when it hits a house out of sight, a large crash, and the rumble in the ground is so strong you almost lose your footing. Glass breaks in houses all around with violent shake.
“You sacrificed yourself to free us. In doing so, the Infinity Stones shattered, whatever was left of their power, went into you. Allowing you to cheat death.” Stephen explained. It was a theory he, Tony, and Bruce had all come together to make sense of it all as you were here healing.
Steve’s just about to ask what exactly he means by that when he pauses. He can hear something. A crying. He listens closely, turning away from Tony and focuses.
“Why don’t you help me. Grab some of those shirts over there?” He points to a clothing rack just behind the kid. The kid hesitated then looked at you and Steve a moment before getting up and grabbing as many shirts as his arms could carry.
“I’m glad then.” Steve smiles, and carefully nudges Bucky with his elbow so he’ll stop gawking and actually say something.
“Oh, right!” You pull the backpack off yourself and open it. “Stephen told me to get all these medical supplies.” You explain.
He takes a moment to finally look it over and grimaces at the sight. It's bent unnaturally, bone out of place and causing a raised bump the skin the whole area is already swelling something fierce, and his heart races, even more, thinking about how the hell he’s supposed to deal with this. It’s not a cut that he can just bandage and ignore. This is serious, he can’t even move his fingers without pain.
He can see Bucky shake his head in the corner of his eye. “Are you- another soulmate? You think Stevie and I are soulmates too?”
“I’m not sure. You can ask Stephen, he was specific that things need to be learned in the right order or it might mess things up. Something to do with the Time Stone and seeing the future.”
! But it’s radio silence from him, from all the voices actually. That constant chatter in the back of your mind gone.
“What?” Something in Tony’s posture falters the walls he’s putting up to protect himself from Steve, they crack open just a little. “What did you just say?”
“Uh no.” Steve shakes his head. “We’ve known each other since we were kids. We went to high school together and we live together.”
When he gets out, he drops down heavily on his bed, sighing relieved. Tomorrow was his day off, just making going to sleep all that better. Knowing he could sleep in put him at ease.
“I’d feel a lot better if you woke up right about now.” He says, placing the bandage back on securely. But you don’t move an inch. He brings his fingers up to your neck and takes your pulse. Your heart is beating faster than usual but that’s just because of blood loss. “You’re supposed to tell us what to do next.” That part he whispers. Every bit of hope he has left is riding on you, and you’re a connection to everyone they lost. Without it… there may be nothing left to save.
He’s halfway through his eggs when he comes up with a plan, smile growing on his face, he picks up the phone.
Tony’s eyes try to follow the moving metal appendage, and his interest is instantly peaked, pulled away from the hole into the counter.
Steve couldn’t describe it if he was at gunpoint. It was just Tony. Layered with different parts, but all combined was his soulmate, and he as well had grown to miss that smell. He wondered if Tony had missed their smell at all or craved for them as they did him.
But there’s also the wound in his side. The fix he gave was temporary. It would stop the bleeding for now, but he couldn’t heal without medical attention. Which he didn’t have here. Moving around would only shorten the time it lasted.
Another flash of light and the two of you snap back to reality with a rough wave of energy, you step away, back colliding with the slowly fading forcefield that had grown around the two of you. You hold your left hand up, and the Infinity Stones whine. The ones left on Thanos’ gauntlet, lift off into the air, and then come to you, resting themselves on the others. Becoming one. The power is intense and burns through you painfully. But you’ve accepted your sacrifice, they will do what you want them too.
Steve turns around, surprised as if he thought Tony wouldn’t want to give him one. But he doesn’t say anything before stepping over and hugging Tony so gently he’s not sure it counts as a hug. He pulls away after about three seconds, and Tony’s confused at the major differences in hugs the two give.
“Sorry. I uh- we can pay.” Bucky says quickly when he sees Steve out of the corner of his eye drop his head down in shame.
“That is different as well.  Being too strong and not strong enough are very different things, and they have different effects. You need to find a way, deep inside, to tell him this. Tell him it’s alright to fail, tell him it’s alright not to be the strongest person in the room. Tell him, that when you get knocked down, you get back up and try again. Tell him heroes don’t hide, they stand and fight. Even when it looks like they are losing they push back, because as long as someone has a heart. As long as someone is brave. As long as someone is strong. We will have a chance. True defeat, comes from inside, not from anywhere else.”
“It’s kind of easy when it’s one of the most famous faces in New York. You’re on the news every week for something, or your company is. Besides, it was a fun night. I tend to remember those as they are rare.”
Tony tries to ignore the way it makes his skin tingle or how his heart begins to beat just that little bit faster, and not with fear. He looks back into the still open part of the shoulder.
Steve, to this day, doesn’t know what was in those drugs. He knows it was some kind of steroid-based enhancers meant to strengthen the body, and there were antibiotics in it to prevent and get rid of infections. But there was something else, something they never told him the name of, but it was meant to help the body on a cellular level.
Steve thought for a moment. “Tony, it’s not an option. You have to get looked at. It’s broken. Whatever you’re scared of we can handle it. We could- I don’t know, put you under a fake name? Do you have a regular doctor? Maybe they’ll be discreet.” He shrugged helplessly.
“Not true big guy.” Tony shakes his head. “The only one I don’t need a break from is you.” Dum-E chirps quietly from the corner and Tony smiles. “You too, Dum Dum. You two always have my back.”
You turn to face it slowly, taking the chance to look around the tunnel for a weapon, anything, even a decent sized rock to throw. The creature snarls again and lunges. But before it gets far, a gun goes off, splitting the creatures head open killing it instantly. You flinch back partly in fear and partly in pain as the sound echoes loudly throughout the tunnel.
The bullies all ran away in fear, and so did the kid he was trying to help. He only ever got stronger from thereon.
They’ve only just begun to get to know one another, but Bucky doesn’t think he can handle things not working out between them. Constantly Tony is on his mind, his face, that smile, those hands. Thinking about Tony’s hip where his soul-mark rests, the warmth and comfort of a soulmate. He wants to hold him there, hand fitting right over that spot. How he’d like to learn every mark, every detail, every imperfection that mars his skin. He wants Tony to understand that he can and will care for every part of him, and accept him with the ease Tony accepted his metal arm.
Steve smiles despite the loss of contact. “Fine, we can work towards that. But I think you missed me.”
He goes on, talking about every piece of the arm as he carefully takes apart the upper shoulder. Getting a look inside, all things Bucky should know if he should ever want to do the cleaning himself, or need to replace a part.
“Bruce, he’s a guy we work with, we share a friend, Natasha, and when she moved here she didn’t have her visa, and when she broke her ankle she didn’t want to go to any doctors because they’d report her. Bruce went to med school before dropping out, and he had this friend who has his own practice now. They took Natasha there and he helped her completely off the books, only had her pay for pain meds.”
You sit on your knees listening to the sobs, of people around you, the crying, the screaming for lost parents, and children. Cars crashing from sudden lack of drivers. You’re almost ready to cry yourself when a pain whites through your head. You clutch it and try to ride out the pain.
It’s opened barely wider than the span of an inch. Just enough for Tony to see this guy is a freaking built like a tall building. Mercenary doesn’t seem too far off from the size of the guy's arms.
Then her mind was spinning, seeing all at once. Just as someone else was. A man. Strange they called him. He was looking through time. But why? Then she saw it, the last possible future. Thanos dead and everyone saved.
And we've come to our final chapter! I really enjoyed writing this and getting all of your feedback, this has been one of my favorite stories to write, and it was the first thing I've started since Infinity War, and I can honestly say I feel a lot better know.  (Mostly because I've decided all the characters are alive and have continued to write them as such) I hope that you all feel the same way! <3 <3 <3
“Give me a couple of deep breaths.” He says, pressing the cold metal just under Tony’s shirt on his back, and then his chest. “Do you smoke?”
Too bad none of it was true. Alcoholic maybe. Tony likes to drink, so what? It’s not like he does it every day, it’s not like he gets blackout drunk either. Everyone only thinks he’s an addict because he took his medication in public one time, and Obie would rather tell everyone he has a problem with drugs than mental health.
In that moment, of intense pain, something cleared in your mind. The endless chatter of voices, some calling out, hearing you in pain, others still chattering amongst themselves, it all silenced for a handful of seconds, and there was one clear voice that spoke. Asking you a question.
You breathe heavily, gasping every few breaths or so because there wasn’t enough oxygen in this cramped space. But moving wasn’t an option. You’re not willing to make that mistake, you value your life, but now it’s even more important with a kid sitting in your lap.
“And the voices? Did he choose your brain to be the satellite to pick up on them? Where are they even? Another planet? Heaven? Hell?”
“Buck.” Steve elbows him lightly in the side, as his face turns red in embarrassment. Steve doesn’t usually tell people just how much he can actually eat in a day. Or how much he really wants to eat in a day. His eating habits are the main reason why Bucky has to hog food sometimes. More often than not Steve will eat all the food in the kitchen. It’s been that way ever since he went through that drug trial.
“Jarvis, fire extinguisher please!” Tony yells once he gets the air back in him. Immediately the connected hoses in the ceilings placed over the workbench go off spray foaming the entire area down in a matter of seconds. The smell of smoke and fire left in the air, Tony pulls away from the man seated on the ground next to him. There are metal pieces sticking in his door and wall. He definitely would have been hit in the chest or arm had he not been pushed out of the way.
Once they got to the apartment Steve meant to pull Bucky aside and make it clear that all was forgiven. But Bucky had other plans. Darting to his room, and barely giving a quick ‘See you at work.’ before closing the door behind him.
Shoes aren’t a direct link to being comfortable, but somehow it changes things, somehow, it’s important. They took their shoes off because they intend to stay, even if only for a movie. They’re going to stay, and Tony likes that idea.
“Yeah… and down the street… and around the corner… and up to the tenth floor of his apartment building.”
Every night he dreams he’s back in that car, reliving it all over again. Sometimes it changes, sometimes it gets worse.
“So, you do like it!” Steve points, smile breaking out on his face, and Tony has to look away not bothering to hold back his laugh.
You were unconscious and the boy was trying to hide behind you as much as physically possible with you lying unmoving flat on the ground. Steve moved for you instantly, reaching for your arm, thoughts immediately on stopping the bleeding.
“Maybe.” He sniffs, bringing a hand up sloppy with pinched fingers. “A little? Or I was? What time issit?”
“No.” Tony shakes his head. “I just um- I’m not ready yet.” His breaths are shorter and shorter, his head feeling light. He may collapse.
You nod, taking the moment to look at the kid. He can’t be over five, he’s got a small cut on his chin, and he’s covered in dirt. Other than that, he seems fine. You inspect his legs just to be sure and sigh soundlessly when you realize he’s got no shoes on. That’s going to make it harder for him to run if you need to. Which you’re pretty sure he’s going to need to at some point.
Tony had been working on a new design for hours, the pizza and breadsticks long gone. His back is sore as he sits up, eyes burning a little at the lack of light in the room.
The insides of the panels have some rough and jagged edges. Nothing major, but Tony would feel better replacing them than to let them sit any longer. Still, it’s not important considering a little rust couldn’t be causing Bucky pain.
“It looks like it might be a bit more serious than that, but we won’t know until I get some scans.” He held out the stethoscope. “For now- may I?”
“I guess that makes sense,” Tony says, but he’s not sure how he feels about it. Relieved? Or maybe even more afraid. He’s lost his only out, although he’s not entirely sure he actually wanted the out. He would try to analyze it but he should probably sleep before doing that.
Steve, his face half pressed into Steve’s shoulder blocking part of his view to the TV which helped to keep him calm. His legs have come up from the floor and his toes are tucked under Bucky’s thigh for warmth and it makes him feel safer. There is a throw blanket covering him, and he feels like a little kid, cowering behind adults.
“You heard me.” Now It’s starting to make sense why Bucky seems so irritated. He left this afternoon walking cloud nine, fantasying about Tony and meeting him tomorrow, now he’s back to grumpy Bucky.
“I wish.” Bucky eventually wheezes out between deep lungfuls of air. He wipes a built-up tear from the corner of his eye, and chuckles thinking about the words again. He only manages to stop laughing when his gaze drops down to the sketchbook. But that only makes him another kind of breathless.
Tony laughs. “That was Thanos’ grand plan. Wipe out half the population and all our problems fly away. The only problem with that is there is no perfect balance. The world is shitty, and it will be when there are half as many people in it. Maybe he’ll just figure that out and say, ‘
Thanos nodded stepping forward. “I understand the need to make things right. But you’re wrong. I’ve already made things right. Go home, enjoy the balance. See your people never know hunger. See the blissfulness of life when you have no worries. Everyone in all nine realms can live in perfect harmony. Don’t cheat yourself out of that by seeking petty vengeance, to only lose.”
“Well, I have big news. Confusing news. First off, your soulmate’s name is Tony.” Steve can’t help but smile when he sees the look on Bucky’s face at the words. So much for the grouchy Bucky. You’d think he was sunny one by the amount of teeth that came into view with the smile carved in on his face.
He won’t ask them to stay, he can’t, he’s not ready for that, as much as he realizes he wants them around more. There’s a difference between wanting them to stay another hour or so and spending the night, which they may take it like that considering how late it is.
“It’s not that- I know just a stupid fear okay? That everything is sort of going okay, but I can’t let it go. It’s all I can think about. That I don’t belong.”
“Steve I found my soulmate!” Bucky exclaims, shoving his hand in Steve’s face. Steve blinks a few times.
Somehow your head has found its way to resting on Steve’s shoulder by the time you wake up. You’re jostled awake as he stands. You’re about to ask what’s going on when you feel it for yourself. The ground is shaking. You stand quickly pulling the backpack over your shoulders.
He dries himself off and drops onto the bed not bothering to put clothes on. He doesn't fall asleep immediately this time. It always takes a while to fall asleep if he doesn't literally pass out from exhaustion.
“Got no idea what you’re talkin’ about.” Bucky smiles. Tony can’t stop himself from smiling back. Even with pizza pushed to the side of his cheek Tony can’t deny how attractive Bucky looks, Steve too. Both tall, strong, easy smiles, and piercing eyes. They fit each other almost perfectly.
You look him over, he still doesn’t have any shoes, but he’s not hurt anywhere, and the cookies tell you he’s had food so you aren’t worried about that. “What’s your name?”
He hadn’t gotten any more sleep. He’d stayed up copying and rewriting most of his lost designs and prototypes. He also spent about three hours fixing his soldering iron. He could have just bought a new one, but paranoia has set in hard these last few days. Tools for building were exactly the kind of thing Killian would be monitoring for purchases on the lookout for Tony, and ‘better safe than sorry’ has become his new motto.
is why he works out alone. He doesn’t need an audience to the freak show that is his life. He also doesn’t want word getting back to Bucky.
Tony wakes up two hours after he fell asleep according to Jarvis. He’s awoken by the sound of Dum-E doing his best to clean up the pizza and plates.
“No!” Steve stood from his bed. “Are you crazy? He’s your soulmate. If you think it’s going to be weird that you followed him to his apartment, it’s only going to double when he realizes you sent me instead of coming yourself.”
Tony smiles. “I can’t give you answers off blind assumptions, I need to get in there and take a look. It’s okay if you want to wait another day. I just don’t want to make any statements or guesses until I know what I’m working with.”
The music changes, fast passed and urgent. Tony’s eyes are drawn to the screen just in time for a jump scare, a character getting snatched away by a large monstrous beast.
“Great.” Tony sagged into the firm padding beneath him, voice holding no joy or excitement. “I'm not sure if I'm ready to see him.”
“Do you like it?” He asks hesitantly. “I didn’t actually see him shirtless, or the soul-marks.” He mumbles. “I didn’t see him smile either. A lot of it is me imagining and guessing. Did I get your mark right?” Bucky smiles and looks up at Steve with a hint of disbelief.
So the slamming was unusual. When he heard the hard stomps towards his room, he recognizes it as Bucky’s stride. Even fast passed as he is, the way he walks is recognizable. Even at a distance.
Tony continues eating his jello, face pointed into it as if he wanted to dive in and escape the conversation, but while Stephen promised not to tell anyone else, he was going to ask Tony this question.
