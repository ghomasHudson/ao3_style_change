Rhodey had a dry humour that reminded Steve of Tony, and an innocent expression which belied a talent for the dirtiest double entendres Steve had ever heard - and he was friends with Bucky Barnes. Meanwhile, Sharon was quick and intelligent and could deliver the most deadpan humour before using their distraction to unrepentantly steal the last spring roll from right underneath Steve’s nose.
. But it never is. You’re not weak. Definitely not.”
“She asleep?”
“No offence but, uh, is this place sanitary?” Steve asked, blinking innocently.
Hope bloomed in Steve’s chest. A slow smile spread across his face.
“Come on dummy, let’s go to bed.”
Tony snorted. “Please. You sound like a herd of elephants. I’d know it was you from a mile away.”
He snatched up the phone. It wasn’t like there would be a reply, right? After all, Tony Stark probably had thousands of matches and likes. There was no way he would bother to message Steve. And Angie might’ve called, or Peggy and Daniel might need a babysitter. And he’d started another Twitter argument this morning. So really, he wasn’t looking for anything from Tony. There were other, much more important reasons for checking his phone.
“Yeah. I mean, I guess so,” he replied. “It’s not a deal breaker though.”
Tony chuckled, turning his head to grin up at Bucky, standing on the ramp of the quinjet.
“This isn’t good for humans either, but that doesn’t stop you from eating it.”
“It’s been two years now,” Matt sighed.
“My pleasure,” Tony smiled, ducking his head under the shower spray to rinse away the shampoo. Wiping the water out of his eyes, he eyed the stall, mentally working out the dimensions, before deciding yes, the risks would be worth the rewards. “So we have the apartment to ourselves?” Tony called.
“All yours,” Tony replied.
They separated briefly - and yet still for far too long - to wriggle out of their pants and underwear. Tony kicked his jeans off of the bed and lunged towards his bedside cabinet, yanking the drawer open and groaning loudly.
“Thanks,” Tony said softly. “See you tomorrow?”
“I’m Steve. Clint asked me to check on you,” he explained. “He got… slightly delayed arranging your scan.”
Someone who was currently trying to tip herself out of Steve’s arms, risking face-planting onto the floor. Tony chuckled and hefted Ellie out of Steve’s arms and stood her on his thighs, holding onto her waist while she leaned against his shoulders.
They pulled up outside Clint’s building with a sequel of brakes. Steve stared out of the window at the array of blue and red lights and felt his heart seize. He exchanged a worried glance with Bucky then climbed out of the car and hurried towards the police tape.
“Julie Wilson. Assistant to the CEO,” Natasha announced, tossing Wilson onto the floor and earning herself a dirty look. “Thought you might be interested in having a chat with her.”
The relief in Bobbi’s voice was like a punch in the gut and Clint had to fight the urge to wrap his arms around her and hold her tight, promising everything would be okay. He couldn’t promise that and he couldn’t hold her, not anymore.
“This woman attacked a man in the street,” the Officer replied. “She’s out of her mind.”
“It’s my house, you leave,” she retorted. They stared each other down, their mouths twitching, before bursting into laughter. “Get over here,” Peggy ordered.
“Yeah, well, neither do I,” Bucky retorted. “She can bring it on. I’ve been doing this since before all of you were born.”
“Hey!” Tony objected in mock offence. “Don’t laugh at the man who’s about to fuck you stupid.”
“Positive. You just don’t trust him.”
“Michelle Jones. I’m looking for my father.”
“Fantastic,” Tony muttered, scrolling through the article while the elevator rose through the air.
Steve turned and grinned, raising his eyebrows. “Wow.”
“I know. I don’t have to like it though.” He scratched at the condensation-damp label on his beer. “I just, I love him so much. And the thought of losing him hurts.”
Steve glanced around, before grinning as he leaned forward. “Yeah. I did. And I also saw the guy with him. How big do you think the age difference is?”
“Nothing,” Steve shook his head.
“It’s not a code I’m familiar with. It’ll take time.”
“I’m serious, Tony.”
“See you,” he echoed.
“Fuck,” Steve growled. With a huff, he found his laptop, opening the Domino’s website and placing an order for a plain cheese pizza because he couldn’t bring himself to decide what toppings he wanted. Then, finally, he stripped out of his dirty clothes and stepped into the shower to scrub himself clean.
Then Steve began to move.
He dragged himself into a shower and getting dressed, foregoing the two flights of stairs to the kitchen and taking the elevator even though he knew Tony would laugh at him if he saw him. Thankfully, when he arrived in the kitchen, Tony was already there pouring coffee into a travel mug that he held out.
“Maybe later,” Steve grinned.
“Watching videos of Tony on Youtube.”
Steve returned to an empty apartment, the silence verging on suffocating. Dropping his keys into the dish, Steve sighed. He glanced around the apartment, but he didn’t know what to do. The cut on his lip stung.
“Where’s the-”
Tony snorted then turned to Steve. “You wanna grab your stuff while I grab the kid? Then I believe somebody said something about making quiet but passionate love? I don’t know who it was but that man sounds like a genius.”
“You good?” Tony asked.
His phone buzzed again, this time with a photo. Tony clicked on it, blowing it up to fullscreen, and smiled. Steve had his arm stretched above his head, giving a perfect shot of him curled up in the corner of his sofa. Sure enough, he was only wearing a pair of boxer briefs, and held a game controller in his other hand.
Apparently the shine had worn off.
“No, Tony, you don’t. The problem isn’t you, or Iron Man. The problem is me. The problem is I hate seeing the people I love in danger. I can’t just stand by and do nothing. But when you’re in danger, there’s nothing I can do. That’s something I need to find a way to deal with.”
It was there when he asked Tony about his meeting.
“Tony Stark taking care of someone,” Pepper chuckled.
“You sure?”
In a fit of pique while he was packing, Steve had ended up throwing a bunch of clothes in a box and calling it a day. Now he had to figure out where everything was.
“It wasn’t Tony who got hit in the face,” Banner explained, his lips twitching into a smile.
“Hi. I’m sorry, have we met?”
And stared.
He’d already been stripped of his identity until he was just Tony Stark’s boyfriend, and now he couldn’t even do anything to help find Tony. Objectively, he knew that the Avengers didn’t really need his help - even minus Tony and Clint they still had a super-soldier, a demigod, a spy and the Hulk - but sitting around and doing nothing when someone he loved was in danger had never been something he excelled at.
Scott and Hope hastily stubbed out their cigarettes. Throwing one last glance over his shoulder, Scott saw Steve press his forehead against Stark’s.
“Not long enough,” Tony replied. “Leave him alone. You want me? I’m right here. Come and get me.”
“Come on,” Steve cried. “He’s up to something. Stane is… He’s practically stealing!”
Tony snorted.
Nothing.
Angie rolled her eyes.
There was a look in Clint’s eyes that Tony recognised. He’d seen it in the mirror when he was at his worst - during palladium poisoning, the PTSD after New York, his break up with Pepper - and it was that look that he’d first seen in Clint’s expression when they climbed out of the quinjet after fighting Amora.
Rhodey’s eyes widened. “You got stabbed?”
Tony’s eyes went wide, his mouth falling open as he stared at Steve in disbelief.
“Yeah, no shit,” Tony snapped. “It’s been ten years, and I wasn’t exactly getting the right kind of food before they died. Howard wasn’t interested in keeping me healthy. Only one thing he wanted me to be, and it was something I was
Instead he sat down on the other end of the couch because he needed the space to remind himself that it wasn’t like that. It would probably never be like that.
“You just called me doc, so I guess it’s something that happens,” Tony replied, examining the wound.
“Ready to go, my sweet?” Dodgy Darren smiled.
“I could maybe learn to love a cat,” Steve admitted. “For you.”
“Inside,” Clint nodded.
Well, not if Steve had anything to say about it.
“Are you sure?” Loki demanded.
“No problem,” Steve smiled up at him. “So what’s the story anyway?”
“Me three,” Natasha added.
“Thank you darling,” Peggy beamed.
“And he objected. Violently,” Bucky finished.
“Pull yourself together, Stark,” he muttered.
“I’ll get the menu.”
“Not like this.”
“And he was so happy to find out Ellie,” Steve continued. “They never had kids, Arnie and Michael. That was his mate. They couldn’t. They were both alphas. He loved her.”
“What do you mean?”
When Tony woke, he discovered that it was late morning, giving him some indication of what time they’d arrived back. He rolled onto his back with a yawn, his nose wrinkling when he realised he’d fallen asleep in the clothes he’d been wearing under the suit for three days.
It took him hours to carry all the files downstairs, dumping them into the old oil drum he’d dragged into the hallway and setting them alight. At first, Steve planned on simply destroying the pages on mers, but then he wondered what else Maria Stark had hidden away in there and his skin crawled again. So he decided to just burn everything. That was the only way he could guarantee Tony’s safety.
that you have the answer to a problem. Yeah. That,” Tony nodded, pursing his lips and ducking his head.
Peggy rolled her eyes.
Steve grinned. His blue eyes shone, and Tony had to bite his lip to stop himself grinning like a fool. Which, okay, was either his best or worst idea, because then Steve’s eyes instantly dropped to Tony’s mouth and he swallowed, which was awesome for reasons that didn’t really need explaining.
“Yeah, guess so,” she nodded.
“You don’t know him.”
Steve hummed into the kiss, slow, leisurely, but with a heat underneath that promised great things.
“Excuse me.” They turned to the woman leaning over the nurses’ station, pushing her hair out of her face and trying to catch her breath. “I’m looking for my nephew, he was brought in after a motorcycle accident. A
“Nothing serious,” Edwards assured him. “Just minor concerns. You are in a very public relationship and it draws attention not only to you, but to the school. And they’re concerned about how it will reflect on the school.”
Driving actually helped. Some of the fog disappeared a little with all of his attention on the road and the unpredictable actions of the other drivers. But once he parked and started trudging up the trail which ran along the back of the Stark property, the fog descended again and it took everything Steve had to climb the wall.
, so he couldn’t even cajole her into making him a sandwich. And the jar of Cheese Whiz he’d been snacking on was disappointingly empty.
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve replied, letting his eyes go lax as she worked. “Thank you, by the way.”
“Hold him accountable for the pain he caused. Thank you.”
“I can’t stop the bleeding,” one of the paramedics replied.
“Oh, wait!” Tony called. “I almost forgot. I got you something.”
“My dad was amazing,” Johnny said quietly, swallowing around the lump in his throat. “But I don’t know what he would’ve thought about me being gay.”
Fire burned in Tony’s veins. He could feel himself nearing the edge and released one of Steve’s hands, wrapping it around Steve’s dick instead and eliciting a groan that sounded as though it had been punched from Steve.
“You might think it’s not worth the effort because you don’t deserve to be healthy and clean,” Dr. Stark continued. “But they don’t deserve to see you like this.”
“Having fun?” Tony asked in amusement.
Clint shuddered and mimed gagging into his coffee. “That’s disgusting. I don’t need to know about your sex life. Or lack of it.”
“Thanks,” Steve smiled.
“Fuck, Tony,” he gasped.
“Yes!” Foggy cheered, clapping Tony’s shoulder enthusiastically. “Good man!”
They were good, as much as Tony hated to admit it.
Steve grimaced, noticing Bucky and Banner doing the same, while Barton just hummed.
“And?” Natasha smirked, feeding the cat a piece of chicken.
“Hi gorgeous,” Tony whispered.
“What do
For a minute, it looked like they would have to intubate her, but then Dr. Romanoff called, “Hold the intubation. Respirations are back to normal,” and a wave of relief washed through the room.
“Nice to meet you,” Steve told Foggy.
Words sat heavy on Tony’s tongue -
Steve glanced between Clint and Scott, who Clint noticed was smiling kinda creepily. Clint mentally scolded Scott to get it together.
“I like your face,” Steve shrugged.
The first notification was a statement to all users.
“Too close,” she agreed, running her hand through his hair. “If they heard us-”
Tony spat out the toothpaste and mumbled, “‘kay.”
“That’s definitely not turning anything off,” Steve retorted, catching Tony’s hand and clutching it to his chest. “If that does anything, it turns things on.”
Natasha nodded slowly, considering what he’d said. “That’s not very helpful,” she said at last.
Tony opened his mouth to ask who she meant again, but Bucky slapped his shoulder, drawing attention. Tony frowned.
“Not really,” Steve admitted.
Ignoring Tony, Steve took the towel with him, crossing to the spiral staircase leading below ground. The shower room was in darkness, but Steve turned on the torch on his phone, and set it on the counter. It barely illuminated the room, stretching the shadows, but it gave him enough light to work. Crossing to the least damaged shower cubicle, Steve turned it on, standing back and letting the water run. For the first few minutes, the water was brown and dirt flecked, but it slowly cleared. It was still cold, but Steve didn’t care.
He’d never really lived with anyone else. He had a roommate in the dorms at college, but he found himself a girlfriend two months in and all but moved in with her, leaving the room to Tony. Then he’d roomed with Rhodey, but they were ships passing in the night most of the time, each muttering to themselves about their respective coursework before collapsing into bed. The last few days, staying in Brooklyn with Steve and Angie, it was nice. Which sounded boring and twee, but it really was nice. The apartment was warm and homey and Tony felt like he belonged when he was there.
“Me too,” Bruce agreed.
“Fixing things isn’t really my strong point,” Steve admitted. “Not unless it’s something that can be fixed by me getting my ass kicked by someone bigger and stronger than me.”
Steve shook his head but he realised with a pang that he was going to miss having her around all the time, knowing that she was just across the apartment if he needed to talk or go out. She’d moved in a stranger and now he was leaving a sister behind.
“Tony?” Steve called, stepping out of the elevator.
“No,” he muttered. “Not this time. I’m done. You don’t get to ruin this.”
“See what happens when you go out of town,” Matt said.
“Uh, here,” Tony said, flipping the instructions over and tapping his finger against the page.
“Too stubborn not to, I guess,” Steve quipped and Tony huffed.
“Says the man who flies around in a metal suit.”
“Does it look like I’m not okay with this?”
Steve insisted on making Tony breakfast, shooing him onto the sofa when he tried to help. Tony folded himself into the corner, leaning back against the cushions with a soft smile as he watched Steve. Although the anxiety and panic from the night before was gone, he still felt raw and open, and Steve’s presence was the perfect balm. Tony dropped his head onto the back of the sofa.
He should give up. Close the app, put down his phone and go work on the suit in the workshop, or finish those reactor engine prototypes for Fury.
“Probably, and yet.”
“Do you have any chest pain?” Tony asked, poking Steve’s ribs.
“That’s because she has taste,” Tony retorted, scratching Liho’s ear. Steve smiled at the rumbling purr which filled the room.
“We decoded the Maggia’s code,” Natasha explained. “Which means we can decode their files.”
“Yeah, that’s a real risk,” Steve agreed, but he made no move to untangle himself from Tony’s arms.
“I am happy,” Steve said automatically because he was.
“Right,” he muttered, pushing the pack back into his pocket.
“It will still be a surprise for Zoey and Hannah and Uncle Steve,” Evie Rose negotiated.
Steve opened his eyes.
“Obadiah Stane,” Stane said, shifting his tumbler of what looked like whisky to his other hand and sticking his cigar between his teeth.
, Tony reminded himself, tidying away the first aid kit.
“Hi,” Tony breathed. “Wow. Look at you.”
“Why are you in a suit?” Tony frowned, taking note of Steve’s outfit.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded. “Thank you. For everything.”
It was Steve. Steve, missing his jacket and tie, wearing a pair of glasses he definitely wasn’t wearing earlier and carrying a gun. There was an ugly bruise on his temple and a scrape on his cheek, he was disheveled and dirty, and he was the most beautiful thing Tony had ever seen.
“It wasn’t your fault,” he frowned.
“If we don’t get out of bed, we’re going to be late,” he pointed out, but even he could hear how wistful he sounded.
Steve took a deep breath. “I need your help.”
“It’s fine,” Steve assured him. He took Ellie from him and settled her against his shoulder so she could scent him. “Hi, sweetheart.”
And that’s when it clicked in Steve’s brain what was happening here. This wasn’t just a friendly bitch between co-workers.
“Then hurry up!”
Then a blur of red and gold shot past the camera and Steve gasped as he began to breathe again. But whatever momentary relief he felt at the sight of Tony was quickly replaced by fear.
“It’s probably a catfish thing, or scam. Or a publicity stunt.”
Steve’s lips twitched, and he let out a noise that almost sounded like a laugh.
“You okay there, honey?” Tony asked, picking a stray piece of lettuce from his place.
Steve slumped against the wall, massaging the ache in his arm and squeezing his eyes shut. They burned with unshed tears.
“Uhh… No. I mean, the break up itself was amicable enough.”
“She sounds like a creepy version of you,” Angie whispered.
Steve turned his head, nudging Tony’s lips with his own, before finally opening his eyes again. His pupils were blown wide as he gazed up at Tony, and Tony was almost afraid to look too closely at the motions flitting across Steve’s face. Cupping Steve’s cheek, he kissed him softly.
“Absolutely.”
“Sounds like the best thing you could’ve done was take care of yourself,” Dr. Pym insisted.
piece which inspired Tony's eyes and gills.
“He’s distinctive.”
“It’s just a freckle.”
A crunch drew his attention; when Tony turned around, Clint was frowning at the remains of a cell phone with a Kandinsky case. Bile rose in his throat.
Steve’s breath hitched as Tony ran his hand from Steve’s neck, down his chest, all the way until he reached his groin, spreading his hand over the growing bulge in Steve’s jeans. Throwing his head back again, Steve whined, his hips bucking upwards. Tony rubbed him slowly through his jeans until Steve was fully hard and a gasping mess.
“Same,” Scott nodded. “What?” he asked when Hope and Clint turned to him with matching expressions of disbelief. “Hey, I notice stuff! Sometimes.”
Steve nodded. “And my headphones. I’m not ready to deal with the public yet.”
He felt jittery and full of energy yet exhausted all at once, and he didn’t quite know what to do with himself. Peggy was in court, Daniel was at work, and Angie was visiting her cousin in New Orleans and wouldn’t be back until the following night.
“Take a picture, it’ll last longer,” Tony called and Steve realised he was staring. Embarrassment flooded his veins. Steve flushed, ducking his head and tried to ignore the way his throat felt like it was closing up.
“Why do you always have to ruin everything?” he grunted. Every time he had something good, every time he was happy, along came his father to destroy everything because that was what he did.
“I need a hug,” Steve admitted.
“Hey!”
“Drink up,” Steve told Peggy, before downing his own shot.
“Hey, puppy,” he murmured, rubbing her arm. “Time to wake up, sweetheart.”
“Sure,” Tony smiled.
“Well,” Steve said once he’d placed the last item into the box. “Guess this is it.”
“Close enough,” Arnie chuckled. He ran a hand over her hair. “Happy birthday.”
Tony’s fingers trailed a line up his neck, tangling in Steve’s hair. His nails scratched his scalp and Steve hummed appreciatively.
“A donkey?” Tony echoed, his lips twitching. “Hmm, what do you think Steve, am I stronger than a donkey?”
Tony threw Steve a smile over his shoulders as Evie Rose dragged him into the middle of the room. Steve smiled, watching them with what he knew must be a dopey expression, but there was just something about Tony with kids which made his heart turn to goop. Leaning against the wall, Steve watched Tony and Evie Rose, until the feeling of being watched began to creep up his neck. Glancing around the room, Steve found a pumpkin head staring at him.
“Then why would you want to stay here when we are outnumbered, outgunned and, if we hang around here for too long, outlived?”
“Oh yeah, lawyers are the worst,” Steve agreed, trying and failing to bite back a smirk.
“What about your family?” he pressed.
“You’ve got me, honey,” Tony promised, his thrusts speeding up, unable to stave off the inevitable any longer. A few more thrusts and Tony came with a choked off cry, aware of the teenager asleep on the other side of the apartment. His blood buzzed in his ears, making everything go pleasantly fuzzy for a few moments.
Steve watched her go. Exhaling heavily, he stuck his forefinger beneath his glasses to swipe under his eyes then swallowed, turning back to the box that he was going to have to repack for the fifth time.
Tony laughed softly in his ear.
“Yes.” Edwards squirmed uncomfortably in her seat. Silently, she picked up a folded newspaper and handed it to Steve.
Tony couldn’t think of anything to say, so he leaned forward and kissed Steve instead, hoping to pass on the message without words. He pulled back almost reluctantly, coated himself with lube, and lined up.
He tipped his head back, staring at the watermark on his ceiling. When he turned back to his laptop, the video was still playing, now in the Great Room with its severe water damage.
After wriggling into underwear for modesty’s sake - Tony spared a moment of regret that sleeping naked was no longer an option, but in the scheme of things it was a sacrifice he was willing to make to see Steve with their child - they fell back into bed again, Steve wrapped in Tony’s arms until they fell asleep.
“I don’t know about fishy, but it’s boring,” Angie muttered. “Seriously, we could’ve been told this in an email.”
“Mrs Borson?” Bruce called. “I’m Dr. Banner. If you’d like to follow me.”
“This is good,” Marci told him. “We have a paper trail to show how much of a thieving bastard he is.”
And that brings us to the end of Wildfire! Thank you so much to everyone who has read, kudosed and commented on this fic, and an extra special thank you to the artists who have contributed to it; Trashie, Charlie, and Quinn.
“I am one hundred percent okay with that,” Tony nodded.
The audacity of the kid. He liked it.
Who was he kidding? He couldn’t clear this up.
“I know him,” he hissed.
“Evie,” Steve groaned, while Tony burst out laughing.
“I hope they get out of there soon,” Hope said. “There’s a storm coming in.”
“Yeah?” Tony gasped.
“Steve,” Joseph warned.
“I wouldn’t call this dancing,” Steve replied.
“Then send it. Did you put the Meet the Heroes thing Pepper wants us to do in the calendar?”
“You okay there?” Steve asked, biting back his amusement.
“Jesus.” Steve sat down, wincing as he crossed his legs, but remained firmly out of stabbing range. “And you’ve been here ever since?”
“Yes. Why?”
But there were a lot of gaps between the three of them, and in those gaps, Tony learned to rely on himself. Despite what everyone thought, he did actually know how to keep himself alive without help.
“Ironheart,” the girl corrected. She wore an Iron Man t-shirt and a NERF repulsor on both wrists.
“Yeah?”
“I don’t know, I think it’s perfect,” Rhodey smirked.
Steve tore his gaze away to find Daniel standing there, watching him with a knowing smirk.
“You okay?” he murmured.
Tony smiled.
shouldn’t tell in public unless I want to get into trouble. Not that I’m worried. I’m friends with three of the best lawyers in the city.”
“Mr Stark, Mr Stark, over here! This way!”
“No way,” he whispered.
“Oh! Don’t tell Clint that Sharon’s pregnant, of course.”
“Constantly,” Bucky sighed. “How do you cope when Tony’s deployed?” he asked Steve.
“Somewhere, there is an asshole with a metal arm laughing about karma right now,” Steve sighed, shaking his head.
Turning back to the pool, Steve realised exactly how big it was. He wilted a little at the thought of scrubbing it all by hand to remove the build up of muck from the walls.
“I noticed.”
“DC was two weeks ago, but they’ve advanced. Like a lot.”
“That too.”
“That was close,” Scott murmured into her collarbone.
“Hang on,” he laughed, picking up his vodka and drinking as much as he could before Angie lost patience. “How much did she drink while we were dancing?” he asked, leaning in to kiss Tony. “Back soon.”
Steve tried to huff, but Tony saw the way his lips twitched, trying to curve into a smile.
“Kind of?” Steve scoffed. “I’m a total dork.”
“Nope,” she interrupted, shaking her head. “Uh uh, nope.”
“That’s…”
Usually Steve hated being underestimated, but today, today he was okay with it.
Blatantly and unrepentantly and Stark was grinning back at him and
” He pushed himself further onto Tony’s finger, “-since then, you know.”
Pulling his phone from his pocket, Tony scrolled through his contacts and hit call on Pepper’s cell phone, flashing Ari a smile as he lifted the phone to his ear.
“Good,” Tony smiled.
“Yeah,” Tony replied, his lips twitching upwards, causing Bucky to cackle like a witch when he noticed.
“How old was she?”
“She doesn’t have insurance,” he admitted.
“You gotta be specific.”
Steve followed Sharon into the elevator, which rose smoothly into the air, ignoring the curious looks from the other occupants. A quiet ding announced their arrival and Steve gladly followed her along the corridor.
Clint’s face twisted. “Looks kinda like a Hispanic Scott Baio. Alright, see you around.”
“You never share your coffee anyway,” Steve laughed.
“Fucking Yankees,” Steve grumbled.
They took Bucky’s car, a brand new electric blue Mustang that he gunned through the traffic. Steve clung to the handle above the door and muttered, “No one is ever allowed to complain about my driving again.”
“Magnificent, isn’t it?”
“Hear what?” Tony frowned.
, Tony found Bucky sprawled out across the couch, a half-eaten bag of Funions on the floor and a can of Red Bull in one hand as he swore at the characters on-screen.
They made their way through the lobby - Tony threw the receptionists and security team a wave on the way past - into the Avengers’ private elevator. Despite the fact they were the only ones in the elevator, they stood shoulder to shoulder. Steve turned his head to bury his nose in Tony’s hair and Tony had to fight back a grin.
“Working out and a lot of jerking off in the shower.”
Steve almost laughed. He’d been fighting in alleys since he was knee-high to a grasshopper and as skinny as one.
“No comment,” Steve replied.
He hated running into students in clubs.
“Am I overreacting?”
“Tell them if they’re not on their best behaviour they’ll have me to deal with. I mean it, Tony. If we’re going to expand, we need these investors. Especially Fujikawa. I need you there.”
As he headed back down to the ER, he thought to himself that those retirement papers were starting to look pretty appealing.
“The doctor in me says that socio-economic background doesn’t play a part in mental illness or addiction,” Dr. Stark replied, twisting his fingers together. He smiled wryly. “But the addict in me says absolutely nothing and that I should be ashamed of being so weak.”
“Ooh, yeah,” Sharon nodded. “I hope they have cheeseburgers like last year.”
“Definitely not. And even if I was, I’d make sure I was free. I missed you.”
“That’s the asshole.”
Steve tensed for a moment, before tipping his head back and staring up at Tony with those big blue eyes, surprise written across his face. “Here?”
“Show off,” Steve called.
“Oh, yeah,” Steve chuckled. “Uh. Let’s just say I had a disagreement with someone.”
She stepped back, closing the passenger door and waving as Tony revved the engine and pulled away from the curb.
The surface of the pool rippled, then Tony’s head popped up. “Steven.”
“She’s a dancer,” Steve shrugged.
Climbing out of the car, Steve rounded to the backseat and unclipped the straps on Ellie’s seat.
“And you definitely look hot,” Daniel added.
Running upstairs, Steve pulled his cell phone from his pocket, scrolling through his contacts and hitting call. As soon as the call connected, he announced, “I need your help.”
“Yeah. It was Uncle Steve’s.”
In the corner Angie shuddered and stared at him as though he was mad.
“Pleasure doing business with you both.”
“I love you,” Tony whispered.
He sat through all sixty eight videos in the playlist and by the time the playlist ended, Steve was shaken and raw. He leaned back in his chair, running his fingers through his hair, blowing out his cheeks as he exhaled slowly.
“Yeah.”
“Hey,” he murmured. “C’mere.”
“Ready for your present?”
“You have to put more than that,” Marci argued.
“Of course,” Steve replied instantly, and fuck, Tony loved him. He loved him so much and he wanted to tell Steve, but no, he should say it face to face for the first time, not over the phone when Steve was half asleep, that was a stupid idea, Tony, so stupid-
“Yeah. I told Tony and then I told the team when I told them about you,” Steve frowned. “So?”
“It’s definitely working,” Peggy agreed. “Tony has serious bedroom eyes for you. Poor boy can’t keep his eyes off your arse.”
Tony gasped. Steve laughed, then yelped and tried to squirm away from Tony’s hands, which were on a mission to find his ticklish spots.
“Just for that, I’m denying Thor all armour upgrades for a month,” Tony declared.
But then, Tony Stark seemed content to let this beautiful house fall to ruin rather than live in it himself or sell it on to someone who could restore it to its former glory. Now, Steve feared the damage was too extensive to restore. The Mermaid House’s days were numbered. And that was a disappointing realisation.
“Alright boys,” he called. “This has been great fun, but I’m gonna have to split. Sorry to spoil your fun, but, you know how it is. So, weapons systems offline.”
Ellie finished feeding and Steve lifted her onto his shoulder, rubbing her back gently. He caught Tony’s eye over her shoulder and they shared a smile.
“High Line,” Tony replied. “We’re gonna get something to eat, take a walk…”
There was too much emotion between them for Tony to linger opening Steve. On another day, he would happily spend as long as possible, taking Steve right to the edge before backing off again. But not today.
“Okay, yeah, I don’t have an explanation for that,” she admitted. “Although Stark does have a good ass.”
“Great,” Tony sighed. “Just great.”
Tony wrapped his right hand around Steve’s waist, pulling him close, feeling a little of the tension leave his body as Steve’s hand curled around his shoulder. They began to move, slowly at first, until Tony was sure Steve could follow.
and show them some love!
“Can I help you, Officer?” Dr. Pym frowned.
“Holy crap, it’s working,” the first paramedic exclaimed. “Where did you learn that?”
“Uh, no,” Tony shook his head. “The only people you know are lawyers.”
He jumped when a phone began to ring on his right.
“Kinda getting the impression it is,” Tony said gently.
Their heads snapped towards Bruce. For a moment, Steve had forgotten he was there. Bruce was staring wide-eyed at Tony and his colour was off.
“Not like that,” Steve sighed. “He has a girlfriend. And I’m not interested.”
“I’m gonna quit,” he told her. “I can’t just… sit around and wait for them to come up with an excuse to fire me. Or worse, I come back and everyone makes significant looks behind my back. I can’t do that.”
“Tony, calm down!”
Bucky and Thor helped them onboard, then Bruce was waiting with towels. Tony grabbed one, rubbing his hair drying before squeezing the water out of his clothes. Glancing over his shoulder, he found Steve doing the same.
But then he heard it: a floorboard creaking quietly down the hall. Then the click of a semi-automatic. His eyes widened and he exchanged a look with Clint. Carefully, Tony closed the door and tiptoed back into the room.
“Was I not supposed to?”
Tony smiled. Pressing his hand into the gap between Steve’s shoulder blades, Tony settled back, making himself comfortable. And if he spent more time watching Steve than watching the TV, well, there was no one paying enough attention to him to judge, so what did it matter?
“Hey, it’s me,” Tony’s voice replied.
“Okay, drinks,” Tony called once they’d claimed a booth in the VIP area. “Who’s having what? First round is on me.”
Hogan looked unimpressed but he sighed, glancing at the woman by his side before nodding. “Fine. Let’s get this over with.”
If Marci was surprised to see Tony the next time they met, she didn’t show it. Steve was definitely crafting those mental adoption papers.
“Hey Cap,” Clint called, jumping over a pile of rubble by the service door. “Wanna hear something weird?”
“Sorry,” Bucky grinned, holding up his hands. He sat down, squeezing Tony’s shoulder and reaching over Tony to high five Steve, clinging on to his hand.
Steve cursed silently. He should’ve worn sweat pants instead of board shorts.
He fell back onto his ass instead, wrapping his arms around his knees and gulping. The tears pressed more insistently at his eyes now, followed by the burn of anger and frustration at his complete and utter inability to do anything to protect Tony.
“The key words here being
“I still missed you.”
Clint flicked open the lid and took a sip of coffee, smiling unrepentantly at anyone who glanced his way. Beside him, Steve rolled his eyes skyward and shook his head.
“Fuck you!” the drunk roared, trying to grab Stark’s leg with his free hand.
“What is this place?” Thor frowned.
Adrenaline come down was a bitch.
“No,” Steve groaned.
The fake shutter sound echoed, cutting off Stane’s tirade and instantly drawing his attention to Steve.
It was stupid and irrational, because every floor of the tower had top of the range soundproofing so it wasn’t like he could hear anything anyway, but Tony would swear that it felt quiet. Oppressively so. Bucky went back to Matt’s last night, and Clint and Natasha were off doing something for SHIELD. Thor was on Asgard, and Bruce was holed up in his lab working on a new project with a JARVIS-enforced do not disturb policy.
“Yes sir, Agent Coulson is in the briefing room. He would be amenable to your company.”
“It’s terrible, yeah,” Steve agreed. “But people are stronger than they look. They can surprise you.”
Steve laughed but obliged, kissing Tony until he wished that he was ten years younger and could go again that quickly.
“Which is concerning, considering that was only two months ago,” Tony sighed.
Tony huffed out a breath.
“I’m not sure what you mean?”
“Uh, Dr Romanoff, excuse me?”
Scott froze.
Tony looked up and beamed at Coulson, who was looking at him suspiciously.
Tony laughed, glancing over his shoulder as he walked towards the elevator. And he thought to himself that Steve looked like he belonged in Tony’s kitchen.
“Right. Good,” Steve nodded suspiciously. “Because I still make the same salary you do. Just because my boyfriend is a billionaire, doesn’t mean I’m accepting handouts from him.”
underneath a photo of Tony Stark
“Uh… Pretty sure,” Clint frowned.
“Thank fuck,” Tony breathed, cradling Steve’s cheek and pressing their foreheads together while Bucky rubbed his shoulders.
“Yes.”
Tony stared into the pool, his eyes unseeing, and Steve had to sit on his hands, pressing them against the cool tile, to stop himself from reaching out to him. He’d just finished explaining everything to Tony, from his suspicions about Stane to his break-in to figuring out Stane’s evil plans. He hated seeing it hurt Tony, but he figured Tony deserved to know. He’d been denied the right to his own life for so long.
"I am trying to" he snapped, his eyes widened comically as he realised his rudeness
Blame the post-pregnancy hormones.
"I am anything but mature !"
“Ecstatic,” Marci said. She leaned past Foggy, pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “I’m happy for you.”
Steve caught Tony’s hand, raising it to his mouth and pressing a kiss against his knuckles without breaking eye contact.
“Good,” Tony teased, playing with the hair at the base of Steve’s neck.
“I’m glad you like them, Steve. And I’m sorry it dragged that up for you. I just wanted to get you something special.”
“See you later.”
“Oh, sweetheart,” Tony sighed, his face twisted in sympathy.
Tony frowned.
, and in the background he could see Thor standing by as Barton received treatment from a paramedic. Romanoff appeared with Banner, but still no Tony.
Tony turned to Evie Rose for confirmation.
He pressed his palm against the glass, the cold leaching into his palm, but it was impossible to see anything through the layer of scum.
Steve considered this.
Except… That alcove made no sense. It wasn’t even an alcove, just a section of wall set back two inches for no obvious reason.
“You okay?” Steve asked, leaning against the nurses’ station, writing on a chart.
“Oh. No,” Hope shook her head. “No. We… barely crossed paths.”
“If I have to suffer, so do you,” he retorted.
“I don’t know how to repay you for this,” Bobbi shook her head.
There was only one problem.
“Does he not know?” Natasha asked, her mouth curving up into a delighted smile.
“You okay?” he asked, tipping his head back.
“Of course,” Steve replied loyally.
And he was a good man.
“Alright, that’s enough,” Bucky said, smacking Tony’s shoulder. “Seriously, there are sick people here. Don’t make ‘em feel any worse.”
“You ever think people get too close to things and can’t see problems because they don’t want to see them?”
“Because my dad is back in my life,” Steve admitted. “He turns up every so often and demands money. Only this time he wants regular payments. Because he thinks that your money is my money and he’s… an asshole. We’re going to try to get an Order of Protection but it’s his word against mine so Marci’s not hopeful. She wants to leak it to the press, but I don’t know.”
“What do you need?” Tony whispered, peppering kisses along Steve’s jaw.
Leaving the lab, he jogged down the stairs to the communal level, heading down into the conference room where Natasha and Clint had been holed up since the Connecticut raid, trying to crack the Maggia’s code.
“There should be a pressure gauge on the filter,” Tony explained. “You do know what a pressure gauge looks like, right? Don’t look at me like that, Rogers. You have no idea what any of this means so I gotta break it down to baby terms. Small enough for your tiny little human brain to understand.”
He didn’t know what made him angrier; the fact that they were basically firing him, or the knowledge that if he’d been photographed with Natasha then the world would’ve been applauding him. But the fact he was with Tony, another man, meant everything was coloured with the implication of
Indeed, Steve had put his plan and Tony's role was only to stand in the back because he was injured.
Why are you acting like you care ? Seriously all of you ? You’re acting like I’m important to you and you’re going to broke me soon enough? He choose Steve on Stephan Strange. Stephan was really a good friend and he could be a perfect lover but yet he choose Steve on him cause there’s no way someone could treat him better than Steve even when they’re fighting even when Steve saying really hurting thing to him . But ? Why can’t Steve choose him on Sharon  ?
the problem?” Tony shouted, getting to his feet so they were on opposing sides of the coffee table.
Steve huffed. “Not all of us are super soldiers. Jerk.”
“Asshole,” Steve spat. He felt his eyes burn with tears and he didn’t understand why he suddenly wanted to cry, but he did know that there was no way he was going to let this scaly dickhead see him in tears. Clenching his teeth, Steve dragged himself to his feet, his leg screaming in protest as the blood soaked his jeans. He laughed bitterly, because if he didn’t laugh, he was going to cry.
“Oh! Sorry, Steve.”
“Why did I think going out last night was a good idea?” he muttered.
Steve moved to the door, straightening his shirt and wishing he’d managed to find the iron before the lawyer arrived so he looked at least somewhat professional. A hysterical laugh bubbled up in his throat as the insanity of what he was about to do hit him. He glanced in the mirror to double check the hastily applied foundation - Sharon’s, left in the bathroom from when she spent the night with Rhodey - covered the bruises from his fight with Stane, then opened the door as soon as a knock echoed through the apartment.
“Alright, grab your gear,” Natasha agreed.
“Seriously?” Tony said, pointing between Steve and Daniel.
“I feel like this is a rare achievement, so I’m going to reward myself with a chocolate croissant,” he declared.
,” Steve exclaimed. “Yes. Yes, I love it. I’d love it even if it wasn’t a key, because it’s beautiful. I love it.”
Natasha stepped out of the cubicle and faltered, recognising the woman standing at the sinks as Pepper. She forced herself to walk forward, flicking on the tap to wash her hands.
“Yeah, since when do you play guitar?” Bucky asked.
Stuffing his face with sugar sounded amazing right about now.
Clint watched her go and told himself it was for the best.
He pulled Steve down, pushing his cock further into him, while twisting his hand on Steve’s dick. Steve went rigid in his arms, letting out little whines in Tony’s ear as his dick pulsed between them.
Steve heard the water lap the edge of the pool, no doubt thanks to Tony’s ever-shifting tail. The evening breeze tickled his stomach where his shirt had ridden up when he lay down.
“Think you can make it up the fire escape in time?”
“You’re gonna help me?”
Tony kissed Steve’s temple. “We’re playing poker at the next available opportunity,” he murmured. “No arguments.”
“Very true.”
Tony turned and spotted Bruce and Natasha negotiating the rubble, dragging the blonde woman from the entrance hall between them.
Tony and Bucky stared at Clint in disbelief. Even Matt tilted his head in surprise.
“None of your business,” Steve replied. “Anyway, as I was saying…”
Steve pulled his mask from his backpack and slipped it on; there was a smell of damp which could be attributed to the giant swimming pool, but with his history of respiratory problems it was better to be safe than sorry.
Fury studied MJ. He reached out with one hand briefly, quickly aborting the movement. But MJ noticed and slipped her hand into his and held on tight. Fury looked at her with something akin to wonder, his throat working.
Steve became flustered all of a sudden, rubbing a point near his neck, "Well, it had a black and white cover with a whip on it and I thought, someone had left a book about horses."
(I've been spending my time online and seeing all kinds of stuff about this).
Shaking his head before his thoughts will show on his face, Tony asked curiously, "Come now, Steve. You'll tell me, right?"
"Wouldn't you like to know?" Steve shouted back as he turned to wink at Tony.
Tony was just about to really question if this was the same Steve Rogers who--just yesterday--worn pink pants because all of his whites were mixed with a red sock (probably Clint's). Where was the annoyingly, sweet blonde gone of too? And where was this version of Steve been hiding?
"What's that?" Tony breathlessly asked, his eyes slowly becoming hooded with desire.
The Captain--Steve, in his lustful thoughts--shrugged and pointedly crossed his arms. Tony could tell he was grating on Steve's nerves but he couldn't help it. It was fun needling the stoic yet sexy soldier.
Tony was just about burst into flames at the suggestive tone in Steve's voice.
, where have you been spending your time thinking about that?" Tony asked in a funny tone. It was not Cap--Steve's nature to be confrontational but this came out of nowhere. Surely, there was a cause for this.
"I'm glad you do. Need any help with it?" Tony asked and not a second later he stuttered, "I-I mean you know about it now but, there might be things that aren't that clear to you--Not that I'm implying you're stupid about sex. Nope, that's not that I'm saying. It's just, if you need anything to be clear? I'm the right guy for you... Not
Tony cleared his throat and struggled to say his words carefully. "Steve, are you enjoying the book?"
"Okay,
Steve turned red and it was his turn to act flustered and shy, "I think, I did. Yes."
" Tony demanded with growl as he almost launched himself at the bastard who was leading on with more. And, by that, he meant the sexy times!
Tony chuckled outright and blinked innocently at Steve.
"Steve!"
"I'll get you those..." Steve trailed off, his hands tightening ever so slightly.
Call it my intuition," Steve answered in his no-nonsense-I-am-Captain-America voice.
Tony, for the life of him, couldn't think straight. He was just kissed by the none other than Captain--
Steve got impossibly closer, and Tony realized that this would finally turn everything different between them.
"Is coffee not enough for you?" Steve slowly asked, copying Tony's voice.
Steve chuckled as he motioned for Tony towards the kitchen. "What would you like now? I have some eggs, toasts and coffee left."
"Maybe, I can give you
Steve nodded as he got in Tony's space again. Tony was nearing to tipping point in his chair but he didn't dare move an inch again. This was the first time Steve was responding to his advances and Tony won't let anything stop the shy blonde from branching out and finally, responding.
(You didn't get it? You're the one who's paying for all of these. This is my way of re-payment) to the
"How shall I ever forget, he made those especially for you," his A.I. responded back.
Tony wouldn't admit it but he nearly jumped in the air. Turning to face the wonderful being he could give his thanks to, but seeing that it was none other than the man who has been plaguing his thoughts, he forced a relaxed stance near the counter.
"What do you mean by that?" Steve asked with a slightly higher pitch.
"What do you mean, Cap?" Inching away from Steve, sensing that Steve was in a touching mood. It was highly drugging to see Steve so chipper in the morning, no need to get anymore flustered.
Shivering, Tony nervously laughed. "I don't know. Maybe I needed something than just coffee?"
Tony nearly inhaled the peanut butter as he coughed the food from his throat.
The smile was uneven yet it was so genuine and carefree, and to see it on the  normally serious face Steve was always wearing... A look of bewilderment, surprise and ease were freely showing on Steve's face and Tony, for the life of him, didn't know what to do next but think, "Oh shit..."
like it. PERFECT !
Pepper sighed "just go and tell him the truth"
Maybe.…like 87.6% Chance is that he’ll end up with a broken friendship and a 0% chance at a relationship with Steve.
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃
"Why not !?" Bucky face-planted himself on the bed and then straightened up a bit "he’s hot, has money and if not a relationship then I bet he fucks good—"
Harley contemplated his decision but it was too late now "Dad” he squeaked "c-can you wick me up ?" He hiccuped "pl-wease ?" Tony sweared under his nose about cutting someone's head "I am there" came a gruff voice from the phone as the gold-titanium alloy suit opened in front of Harley.
"Meet Mr. Rogers" Fury optioned towards Steve who just stood there, hands back like a perfect a soldier
"Bye Buck"
A drop on his book, he pulled at the sleeve of his long shirt and tried to soak the tear on a the book. as an desperate attempt to dry the tears he rubbed his sleeves harshly on the page. A loud tear was heard, the page was torn...just like him.
"Peggy !" Tony smiled at his cousin, Peggy turned towards Tony and pulled him in a hug "Anthony" she smiled and kissed his cheek
"Tony" Steve punctuated "I don’t think it’s a good idea, I don’t mind being friends though" oh
let me go"
"I wanted to apologise for my behaviour earlier so… i’ll make it up to you ? Dinner tomorrow ?"
"So ?" Tony shrugged as he entered a building "I have more important things to do, ya know" he found the mad genius responsible for the chaos and helped her reverse the situation…and also offered her a job, cause damn she was good just needed supervision, a lot of supervision. "Sorry, Romanoff no killing my employees"
Steve’s cheeks heated up again “you are not bad too Tony, it’s amazing how much good you can do” mission abort ! Getting drunk with your crush Is a bad idea ! No ! WAit ! What crush !?
she meant "You heard the conversation, he’s pissed at me" Tony made sure that Steve doesn’t hears them which wasn’t hard considering the blon—
money ? Check
It was a matter of minutes and they both reached the lake, the lake where they met. (And Stevie definitely did not fell in the freezing lake, nope)
Tony never even uttered the word ‘experiment’ ever since
I haven’t forgotten about this story ! I am just taking time to get the characters right and not make it seemed rushed !
"Sir, that’s my seat and I am asking you to move politely if you don’t then I’ll have no choice but to call Miss. Carter"
silence, Steve spoke up again "that was Clint’s ,he is trying poetry…"
Steve blushed furiously as his mind imagined various situations
Ms. Carter clapped twice to get attention of the winners who chattering among themselves "I am going to explain the itinerary and the ceremony once and then it will be practice only for the three upcoming friday" the winners nodded as she turned to the audience seating arena "I request all of you to shift to VIP chairs like you’ll be sitting on the final day and I hope all of you are aware that you only have to attend one day of the three days" the audience gave different variations of ‘yes’ and shifted to the VIP seats
Steve thought as he looked back at Tony dreadfully
"Then forget it"
Bucky scoffs "says you"
"Damn it Steven ! This is The Praemium Imperiale ! You don’t get to act like a 5 year old !" They both raced down the hall like children
" She retorted with a gleam in her eyes
money ? Check
"I didn't mea-" "It's ok Steve, just hold on" strange was scared would be the understatement of the year, he was the one who'll lead the process and he didn't wanted to let his niece die but he didn't wanted the American eagle dead either.
"Steve Rogers ?" A distinct British voice lulled him to trace it back to its origin "Yeah ?" He asked looking at the probably-British-But-looks-American woman
"Isn’t that the point of a date ? To get to know each other ?" Tony gave a charming smile
"Tones, any particular reason why did you want to avoid going to your parents today ?"
and sat back on his previous location
"Yea?-yeah !" Tony said coming out of his daze
"yeah, a genius who’s time isn’t worth a petty word battle against
"Tony please"
Both Tony and Stevie hastily broke away from surprise which resulted into breaking of the branches they were sitting on and landed right near the legs of Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff.
Before he could scold Clint for being insensitive, Tony waves it off "let him Bruce, wouldn’t want a crying birdie nesting in the house"
That very movement the door beside him opened to reveal a man In an Armani suit and French cologne
Steve couldn’t help leaning into the palm and nuzzle in to it, trying to catch Tony’s warmth "you love me" he muttered as if a mantra that has been keeping him alive "God ! Tony you love me !? Why didn’t you say anything !?" A sob shook his body
Steve winced, he knew Tony was trying his best to juggle between SI, being Ironman, his funds, charity, and god-knows-what-not, he knows Tony tries to spend every spare second with the team because they are family, he can literally see the pain and guilt flashing on Tony’s face everytime he has to leave the team when he promised that he wouldn’t , he knows Tony loves them but he has other responsibilities too and frankly, without Tony, they all wouldn’t even have a roof over their heads. so, he really doesn’t blames Tony for not being around and so shouldn’t Clint.
"Of course I like him ! Have you seen those muscles—"
Tony didn’t call Steve, neither did Steve.
but he couldn’t help but think
going to mess it up"
"Do you want water ?" Steve nodded
"Yes"
"I am trusting you"
(See the end of the chapter for
"She wasn't" Tony said Wetly before hugging Steve and letting the soldier cry on his shoulder
Tony sighed, this is gonna be hard.
Tony eyed the hot blonde "not a body building competition buddy" he stretched his arms
They change their clothes; Stevie wears a biker jacket,a pair of jeans and a statement tee which said
"It’s not— my brother was, he uh irritated fury until he paired us up for this project" Steve said sheepishly
Steve turned around "I know…we can’t just…start trusting each other suddenly…but I want to work towards it" he swallowed
“No” Steve deadpanned “not with you, not on duty”
Tony sat in the living room, waiting for Steve to be arrive
Strange came out and got crowded by the avengers " Steve's fine, knocked out but fine, Morgan is..." he bit his lip "in the incubator, she might be there for a while"
Pepper sighs…again "Tony you can’t attend the event."
As he said, I quote 'put some sense into his thick skull'. It's the last day of vacation now and tomorrow both of them would be off to their respective colleges, both of them will miss each other but none of them will confess.
“The director ?”
But not if you are an avenger who was just called into a mission.
"Why not ?"
Steve snorted "So we can discuss why I should call The Tony Stark ?"
"Yes" he said in absolute seriousness
"Because a) you aren’t getting any of the awards, b) just because you are the contractor to organise the event doesn’t gives you free pass, c) I don’t want you ruining the event people have waited their whole lives for" a loud a sound echoed through the halls as her heels made contact with the ground "Tony ?" She questioned the lack of a comeback from the genius. She hit a nerve and she knows that she did.
"I don’t think, I know"
"None of that bullshit" Bucky scowled "you did this on your own, I wasn’t there for you when mum died, I should’ve been but I wasn’t, you pulled yourself together and turned her vision to reality, so don’t give me crap about how you couldn’t have done it without me cause you totally did"
the words stung but he nodded anyway
Tony made his way to a seemingly extra seat as there were 5 winners and 6 chairs, he settled down on one of them.
Steve winced "hopefully I stay alive after this" he mutters to himself but finds himself inside Fury’s office anyway
he repeated mentally
"No no no no" Steve muttered as he stumbled back, his eyes watered and tears cascaded down his cheek without permission "No ! Tony no" his voice broke "tell me what’s wrong, we’ll work it out, baby please, please" he begged falling on his knees
"C'mon make out again I wanna see" Nat teased
Tony’s eyes scanned over the crowd and then landed on Peggy, he made his way towards the brunette
Steve squirmed under her gaze "I am sorry, I didn’t mean to sound offensive, they probably have their reasons." He nodded at the woman apologetically, who nodded back.
"You know" she whispered after a while "You should ask him out"
"Rogers"
"TONY"
Steve gave a boyish smile targeted towards someone in the crowd, Tony tried to trace the receiver of that smile but Steve looked away quick and began his speech "I am glad that I was deemed worthy of this prestigious award that I possibly couldn’t have won without inspiration from my late mother Sarah Rogers and support from my brother, James Barnes" He smiled at someone in the crowd…again but this time Tony traced it to a black, long-haired male who was smiling proudly, even though his cheeks were flushed red from the sudden attention
That night Steve wanted Tony to cry, To let himself go but he didn’t.
"The winner of music category is running late" a red head replied to Steve’s not-really-a-question
"Only you sweetheart" Tony winked at him
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃
"These modifications will make the building look ugly" Steve made a disgusted face at the hard light hologram
After a couple of minutes of ‘
He grinned back mischievously.
"I got sources Stark"
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃
"Aw I am hurt that you think that I only call you when I am—"
He pondered
But now ? Tony kept absolutely no physical contact between them, Steve looked at Tony weirdly, he wanted to ask if Tony was alright but what was he supposed to say "hey Tony, why aren’t we cuddling ?"
His jaw tightened as his shoulders tensed, hands automatically curling into a fist.
good in bed ? Check.
By a harsh pat on his knee "go to your class !" The nurse scowled at him "and don't fight ! I won't patch you every time you bleed"
"That means you like him"
”Stevie and Tony sitting under a tree k-i-s—"
"Well, I did say that I don’t mind being friends" Steve shrugged
"Would love to" Steve gave him a sincere smile and Tony couldn’t help but grin back.
"I am not following you" Tony says immediately "You rejected me, I respected that, I don’t know how fury knows that I asked you out"
Soon the speech over, Steve walked down the ramp
Steve’s brows furrowed "what favour ?"
“lunch as gonna-be-friends then ?" He proposed, Gotta love a challenge.
"Apparently you turned down Tony Stark’s date offer and your brother is very involved in your dating life" ‘how can Fury even say this with a straight face ?’ He thought helplessly
"No ? I-uh it was something depresso ?"
"I think this looks pretty damn cool" Tony countered sitting down on a couch
Steve nodded quietly
Steve snapped his head towards the red head, Steve didn’t wanted to sound like some stuck up person but the award meant a lot to him "don’t they realise the importance of this event" he ended up muttering
the fidgeting, the nervous glances thrown across the room, the fingers swirling around the trophy’s ribbon, the irritated twitch of his
Tony snorts “you thinking about crashing on my couch ? My bed’s empty too” he gave a suggestive smirk
"I talked to Jan on my way up, she’s free"
never thought he would be able to call Steve that.
he stood up and closed his book, tucked it in bag and hung his bag over his shoulder
abs everytime the slightly drenched sash came in contact with his body. Don’t even get him started about how he stood up to Tony,
After being cursed for not being on time over some stupid party (Maria stark’s charity foundation) Tony made his way to the empty bar and poured himself a glass of his oldest drink.
"It wasn’t that bad" Natasha shrugged half-heartedly
They knew they were not going to be living together as adults but what's the harm in dreaming.
"Look ! First sign of being a couple"
"Keep dreaming Tin-Can" Natasha scoffed
"Can I see it ?" Hearing the (surprising) glee in tony’s voice, Steve couldn’t say ‘no’
Tony dropped his ice cream as he got pulled away by he blonde to their bedroom.
It’s a movie night, Steve swears on his shield that he loves his team but not when they go feral over who’s turn it is to pick night time entertainment. Times like these ? He just feels like strangling them.
Steve walked up the ramp with confidence that certainly wasn’t their when he was sitting beside Tony, he stood behind the podium and adjusted the mike to his height, Tony couldn’t help but chuckle seeing how much it had to be raised, Natasha surely was short in front of him.
Steve slipped his arms around Tony’s waist and kissed his neck, he felt Tony stiffen, he looked at Tony’s face questioningly but found Tony’s eyes fixated on something in front of him.
He suppressed his ‘yelp’ and pushed the paper in Tony’s hand and looked down, embarrassed, playing with his fingers, not wanting to capture Tony’s reaction. He shut his eyes hard, making the eyelashes to collapse, releasing the droplets that’s were hanging to his lashes.
You would’ve expected Tony to hide away in his lab or Not allow Barnes to live in the tower with the rest of them once the rogues were home.
He never ran so fast before, ever in his life.
"Jeez Pepper"
"Mr. Stark ?" Tony’s attention snapped towards a blonde —hot dude
"You we’re fighting a biker gang leader for a
he glances at the clock and gives Steve a light tug, gesturing him to walk towards the door, Steve wordlessly follows him
Tony and Stevie had been living together for a year now on his dad's request
" Steve said firmly and pressed his forehead against Tony’s "you’ll hurt yourself"
"Pepper, we discussed this, why are we discussing this again ? Don’t waste a genius’ time—"
He opened his eyes as he felt Tony's breath mingling with his own.
Another contraction hit as Steve was wheel chaired to the hospital
"What? No that's not fair"
"Not your office" the bastard smirked
Tony kissed Steve when strange came in "Tony ! Get your ass on the chair, will ya ?" He said smiling at Steve
"Uh-huh" she agreed unconvinced and made that
—-x—-
"You liked him ?” Bucky laid a hand on steve’s Shoulder, to tell him that he didn’t mind if Steve did
"On his way !" Steve’s shield chopped the big worm into two, the dead body lay on the ground oozing…green goo ? God their lives are weird
Tony realised that he was still standing in steve’s room.
It was the third week, the kid was doing good, so Steve was discharged along with the kid
"No."
"I know why it’s important to you but it’s important for the winners too and you
"Because if we aren’t gonna work out, then why waste time ?"
he whispered Steve to meet him at the rooftop once the ‘welcome
"Were you snooping around in my room, Tony ?" He asked calmly, calm before the storm.
"Your husband needs you" Bucky stressed "be there for him right now, okay ?" Tony nodded in response as he followed strange.
Steve flushed and coughed awkwardly
"Tony if anything happens, save her"
"I thought there are five winners from five fields" Steve muttered under his breath as he settled own a cushioned seat, his eyes raking the audience seating to find Bucky, ho waved at him from the centre seat in the front row, steve couldn’t help but grin and wave back
Peggy smirked "you weren’t supposed to come, were you ?"
The nurse was a grumpy woman she grumbled about "kids...fight...blah blah" everything was fading into a background noise. His eyes were distant and yet he was focused on the memory
Her hands tightened around the stark-pad In her hand.
stark hanging. Tony should be angry but damn does it makes him want Steve more.
"Tony" she gave the infamous no-nonsense-voice
"so that we can go down to the lab together ? But I just spot this paper and I couldn’t resist reading —which was very wrong of me, i get it but that’s not impor—"
w-will you b-be th-ere to patch me up if-f I bweed?" Tony kissed his forehead "always bub"
"It’s director Fury for you" Nic— Fury said curtly
"It's alright, she'll come out" Nat tried to soothe the soldier down, keyword: tried
when Tony hugged him
"No." Steve’s eyes watered "never" he pressed a kiss against Tony’s temple "not again"
Tony emptied his glass in one go and turned towards Steve "No. It wasn’t"
"Of course you think fighting is a sign of being a couple"
Tony turned around, finally stopping "I am going and it means I am going, I don’t need your approval on my personal plans Ms. Potts"
"Hey ! Steve !" Tony clasped his hand against Steve’s back, Letting it linger for a second or two
the walls started closing in as he found his chest heavy, tears rolled down his cheek as he struggled to think, speak or even breathe. A slap on his face brought him out of his daze.
After an awkward silence of a few mins Steve spoke up again "I am Steve Rogers, you are ?"
Steve turned around, putting up a grin on his face "I am happy, a little sad that Ma isn’t here but happy that I won it…I won it ! Buck !"
Steve waddled to the refrigerator "I want her out !" He shouted
"Wha- ? Yeah, sorry, I’ll just—" Tony fumbled with the remote…a tech genius fumbling with a remote.
Yeah ? No.
"'Cause we saw our OTP becoming trueee" Clint sang
"Listen blondie—"
A small smile broke on Bucky’s face, he could see the emotions flashing on steve’s face like colours, the kid’s been working too hard to win this. He took his weight off the door, walked towards Steve and pulled the younger guy in a hug "I am so proud of you" he whispered as if words spoken louder will break the fragile aura around them…maybe it will.
“She’s a assassin too”
"T-Tony, I-I think no I believe m-my way-er broke" Steve said as he dropped his fork down on the table
"Where were you ?" Ugh she was covered in that worm’s weird shit now
face but that would probably startle the life out of Steve, not to mention the field day paps would get or the PR disaster or the lectures he would get about why you shouldn’t suddenly kiss a hot-blonde beautiful stranger
He shifted uncomfortably as …Tony just held the remote ? Ok this is way too weird to be ignored
Perhaps Destiny doesn’t agrees with their choices.
"Wow I cross you once and suddenly I am ‘Mr. Stark’"
"Get a job !"
"Yeah"
"Already did"
Right now Tony was trying to convince Stevie to spend their last day together rather than going to his dad's house.
The rest of the tower was quiet, Natasha and Clint were still at med bay cause clint was badly hurt, Steve was in his room having long showers, unwinding and all that zen stuff and Bruce was in his lab working on some stuff which Tony would love to have a look into.
"Ha ha" Tony dead-panned, annoyed. He spoke again after a beat "which movie ?"
Stevie we haven't hung out in forever !!!" Tony whined looking at his bestie, crush and room mate.
They ran to a tree and climbed (Tony totally didn't need help... what are you talking about ?) .
"C’mon Clint" Bruce sighed "Tony wasn’t here the last few movie nights, he missed more turns than all of us collected, be the bigger person and let him choose"
Conclusion: Calling Pepper wasn’t a good decision.
“Says the man who literally kidnapped me” Steve retorted
Tony landed on his tower’s top "even in slime, you look hot af" He chimed as he looked at a visual of the team and their conditions, more like ogled at steve’s visual.
Tony looked at Steve gobsmacked, confused, why ? Why was he being rejected ? He has everything !
to you ?" He asks nervously
