This is why he ends up ringing the doorbell to Tony’s home, his Secret Service detail huddled closely behind him, black unmarked SUVs parked on an almost empty street.
Once outside, Natasha pulls her phone out to call a car, shivering from the unpleasant cold November weather. A few taps and a ping later, Natasha tells Clint, “SHIELD will have a car to pick us up in a couple of minutes.”
“Does sitting on the information include Stark meeting with Danvers and Rhodes?” Fury asks in distrust.
He stands there for a bit as Anne putters about in the kitchen, not knowing what to do. With the girls and Darcy’s father out buying last-minute provisions at the store, it’s just Clint and Anne. He’s not used to standing by while people around him do all the work—that’s just not how he’s built.
“Which means she hasn’t let me off at all. The worst is yet to come.” He raises a blue and white tie with his right hand, and a red and gold tie with his left. “Which one?”
“This better be worth the check I’m writing after she and Miss Chavez wreck another bar somewhere in Georgetown,” Tony grumbles.
“I do not doubt either Erik or Darcy,” Thor interjects, supporting his wife.” If they say Loki is here, then I am certain of it as well.” There is finality in his voice, and the others do not hesitate to believe the both of them.
Cassie rolls her eyes. “Please. Just because she decided to come back into my life thirteen years after she left it doesn’t give her any rights to my holiday plans whatsoever.” After gently pan-frying the seafood, she dumps the spaghetti on the pan and starts mixing, sprinkling salt, pepper and bits of basil. “Besides, being a legal adult affords me the right to make decisions without the input or say-so of my living biological parent.” She turns the stove off after a few more minutes and flips the pasta one last time. “All done! Pass me the plates?”
“I apologize, good sir,” Tony drawls out with a perfect British accent. He can practically hear Tony bowing at the other end of the line. He has to admit, the humor is a welcome respite from the fatigue and sorrow that are trying to swallow him whole.
Tony chuckles. “Thanks, it’s the new trend these days. You should try it.” He places his cup on the coffee table and flops down on one end of the sofa with a gigantic sigh.
“Go right ahead. There’s another entrance to the house inside the library, it goes right into the garden. Feel free to stand imposingly by it,” Tony informs them. “I’m the only one who can open the basement, so just yell if you need to take a look at that as well.”
“I’m not sure invoking Clint was the best thing to do at this point,” he replies with a dark chuckle.
“A more detailed breakdown of the indictments is currently being distributed to the press corps by staff members of the Justice department.
“But I do. I do feel like I have to do this,” he insists. “I don’t ever want to make you think that my work will suffer whenever my personal life goes down the drain. That’s not good for me, that’s not good for the team, and that’s not good for the party.” Clint sighs and glances at Natasha. She’s looking straight ahead, her face unreadable. “And I don’t like being a burden to the team—Tony and Kate especially, propping me up like I’m some weakling. It’s not who I am.”
Tony rubs his temples. “No, we're not. But that's what the press are going to insinuate. I know you like Rumiko and keep in touch with her, so I wanted to give you a heads up.”
Clint nods in agreement. “They’re definitely a pair, those two. They’re invaluable on their own, but together they’re unstoppable. Tony and I wouldn’t be able to get anything done without them.”
America turns around and breaks into a smile. “Well, look who it is. Does your boss know you’re here, Bishop? Or did you take out a loan to pay for tonight’s damages?”
“Baby, you should have really taken a better look at Natasha. I could’ve sworn she had her fangs out when Darcy started talking about subpoenas.”
him. This whole affair with the budget is proof of that. And as much as she hates to admit it, Tony and blind trust don’t exactly mix well together, like alcohol and...well, Tony.
It occurs to Tony that this will be the first time he will face Steve since beginning their agreement. He doesn’t know how their new relationship will play out in front of their colleagues. Of course, the goal is
Steve chuckles. “Your guess is as good as mine, Mr. President. It’s my first state dinner, but I’m afraid I had to miss my meeting with Protocol this afternoon, so I am utterly uneducated as to what happens in functions like this. And as you can see, I’m going stag tonight, so I would not know how to initiate the proceedings, so to speak.”
“Everyone’s waiting in your workshop, as instructed,” Kate responds mutedly. “JARVIS is keeping an eye on them.”
Hill smirks, seemingly triumphant. “I think you know that your comfortable majority will never pass your Women’s Health Act with a school prayer amendment. That’s why you’re here trying to convince me to withdraw it.”
He hears her sigh and the tone of the conversation changes slightly. “Disappointed, obviously, as with the rest of the party. But you know Thor, always looking at the silver lining.”
and hits send. It’s a few seconds later when he hears a ring that he realizes who he had sent the message to. He’s surprised the reply is a late night call instead of a simple text message.
“I highly doubt that.” Tony kisses the side of Steve’s mouth. “Besides, you’re not the only one who hasn’t done this in a while.”
“I serve at the pleasure of the President-elect.” Bruce takes him in for a hug. “I’ll leave you to rest. We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.”
“Yet,” she says with a groan. “Remind me again why I decided to take pre-med at one of the toughest, most competitive schools in the world?”
“Since the shutdown. Remember when the press ambushed you before you entered the White House? I was watching that whole bit with Natasha. She figured it out.”
Bruce adjusts his eyeglasses and reads from the piece of paper he’d been holding since he entered the Oval Office. “
For all the control that Uncle Michael had on his life, art was the one thing that Steve truly wanted for himself, and over the years he rode an undercurrent of relief that his uncle never demanded him to give up his paint and sketchbooks. So while he doesn’t regret going on the path of least resistance, sometimes he thinks about what life would be for him if he had insisted on forging his own way.
“The job scares me,” he finally tells Steve, his voice small. “When I said yes to this, I didn’t…I’m not a born leader, Steve. I’m not used to being responsible for so many people. I don’t want to disappoint any of them. I don’t want my decisions to put them in danger. I don’t…” Tony exhales and closes his eyes.
Scott receives the papers that Tony is ardently shoving into his face. He scans the text, his eyes growing big as they reach the end of the first page. “Where did you get this?”
Tony’s brows furrow in slight confusion. “Did we already decide to have a coming out party without me knowing it?”
“A reactor this small could be enough to power a whole house, a big one at that. You wouldn’t need power plants to electrify cities anymore, or an electric grid for that matter. You’d just need the arc reactor at various sizes, depending on what it’s going to power.”
He dries off and heads to his closet where he is faced with a myriad of clothing choices. At this point he can’t even bring himself to care about what suit he’s going to wear, but his clothes have, to some degree, been a type of armor for him his whole life. Growing up under the shadow and the iron fist of Howard Stark meant that he had to create a public persona beginning the age of four, and he had to learn how to hide his true self from the world—give the people something about you to talk about, so they don’t have to talk about
Tony pauses, hesitant to ask his next question. Finally, he gives in. “How many times did he look at my ass?”
“I don’t think Rogers has ever been the problem,” Tony says thoughtfully. “If we were to be completely honest with ourselves, he submitted a balanced and relatively fair budget proposal. Granted, there were some things that went over our red lines, but there was still room for civil negotiations. Now we have tax cuts for the one percent and higher interest rates for student loans, among other things.”
He shrugs. “Fair enough. We’ll update them when we get the chance. Go ahead downstairs, I’ll finish my rounds and follow you in a bit.”
“Are we good, JARVIS?” Tony asks his AI once everyone had left. No bars were wrecked tonight, thank god, although he suspects something must have happened between Kate and America, judging from his assistant’s dour entrance earlier. He’ll have to deal with that later.
The straightforwardness of his statement annoys Steve a little. A regular congressman would not have the balls to carry that tone with the President of the United States, but Bucky Barnes isn’t a regular congressman. Not to Steve, at least, and that probably makes all the difference. This is when Steve realizes that he’s got to toughen up—he can’t have the personal clutching the professional by the throat. “With all due respect,” he says that last word a little more strongly than the rest, “but I’d like to be given the chance to finish speaking.” The President is more austere now, obviously trying to assert his authority.
“I’d be surprised if I didn’t have it in the bag already,” Tony tells her honestly. He hears glass breaking from inside the house. “My house is turning into a frat party.”
She raises her arms halfway in mock surrender. “Sorry, my bad. You’re not going to tell your boss, are you Billy?” Cassie asks their escort.
Clutching his wallet and gazing at the picture, Steve can’t remember a time when he was happiest, most contented, than in those stolen moments with Peggy. It’s not the passion or the intensity of making love that he misses the most, but rather the adoring smiles, the hearty laughter, the slow mornings in the kitchen, the quiet evenings in the living room. It’s the victorious times like these where he hurts, aches for Peggy and her warm touch and reassuring eyes.
With a cheeky glint in his eye, he tells his assistant, “Wait. I’m going to need you to make a call for me.”
Steve’s smile widens. “You could come early in the afternoon, bring all your stuff, and we could cook in the kitchen.”
“Can someone please explain to me how they came about with this conclusion?” Clint asks, frustrated.
“It’s been more than a week. We haven’t had any new information about this, and no one we know or trust has seen him around the city,” Pepper interjects. “Are we certain Darcy’s intel is good?”
Steve takes a deep breath and begins. “I am not happy with the way the Republicans in the House are dealing with the budget crisis. I understand that the House is probably the tenth circle of hell, and that Tony Stark is the devil, but that
“Yes. Came back last week from God knows where. He’s still a little nuts, but at least he had his pants on this time around.”
“No, you’re not.” She prevents him from turning away by gripping his forearm. “Do you even know what you’re getting yourself into?”
“Listen to me.” Tony places his hand on Clint’s drink and forces him to put it down on the countertop before Clint can take another shot. “It’s eating you up. And I know you take precautions not to let your personal life get in the way of work but Darcy’s passed along that you went as far as asking her to bring you a cupcake. Four times in the past three months, if my information is accurate.”
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
“Give me Stane,” Rumiko says suddenly, the forcefulness of her tone surprising everyone on the line. “I can deliver him.”
“Which is basically everyday of my sordid existence. Well then.” He sits down and opens the files set aside for him. “Shall we begin?”
, not subpoenaed, to appear before DOJ lawyers to testify regarding allegations that Justice Pierce is implicated in a number of fraud and bribery cases.”
Tony tilts his head and considers Steve for a moment. He’s impressed that the President managed to figure that one out. “I’m sure Maria already got a mouthful from you and Fury. I don’t need to add to her pain,” he clarifies with a shrug.
“Bye, Pep. See ya.” He watches as she bids a few more friends goodbye and exits through the front door.
Pepper sits beside him and wraps an arm around his waist. “Oh, darling. I don’t think even you can stop a bullet train with your own bare hands. He’s a great leader and an even greater man. Ask Clint, he’ll back me up on this.”
Well, this didn't take long at all! This chapter officially begins the third and final arc of the fic. I'm glad to be finally moving the plot along, and since I've already mapped how the final arc is going to play out, my only enemy to finishing this within the year at this point is grad school and procrastination.
Cassie’s typing stops abruptly, and she turns to Steve and her uncle. “Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me.”
Natasha raises an eyebrow, suspicious of where the conversation is headed. “I know that’s not the question that you really want to ask me.”
Steve doesn’t back down. “My office submitted a fair and balanced budget to Congress. Somewhere along the way, it was torn apart and transformed into this monster of a document. All of you know that I don’t want a continuing resolution. I want a budget, but not this budget that you’ve brought me. And if you can’t get your act together and give me one that is acceptable, then I want this government shut down until I get something that is presentable to the American people.”
“You shouldn’t be so hard on him, you know,” Clint tells her carefully after about a minute of silence. “He’s got the weight of the world on his shoulders, and we put it there.”
“Jesus Christ.” Tony swats them away. “Come on guys, stop accosting the man, for the love of god Dum-E, Butterfingers, return to your charging pods—wait, are you petting them?”
“Can I get a roll call and a quick sit-rep?” she murmurs, soft enough for the communicator to pick up.
Cassie and Tony are loading the last of the food and kitchenware into the black SUV that Steve had sent over to pick them up. Tony had packed up everything they needed—and then some—with an almost militaristic precision earlier that morning, much to his goddaughter’s chagrin.
Again, thank you so much for the wonderful feedback, and we hope your patience lasts until the end of the series.
“Oh my god. Billy, when you write the report for this little trip of ours, please make sure to mention that
He doesn’t know how long it lasts, five seconds, five hours, maybe five million years, but it feels as though they could go on forever like this, kissing against the bookshelves, their literary heroes and heroines bearing witness to something new and beautiful and quite frankly, scary. Steve’s hands cup Tony’s face, and Tony’s hands grips Steve’s hips, neither of them wanting to let go.
Tony wastes no time in taking off his coat and drapes it over the nearest armchair. He walks over to Steve, with a cup of tea in his hands that’s clearly meant for him. Tony smiles at him, all worn out but glad to be where he is at this very moment. He takes Steve’s face in his hands and gently kisses him as a proper hello. “Thanks for having me,” he murmurs against Steve’s lips as he accepts the cup of tea.
need you. You know your way around this world but aren’t involved enough for people to take you seriously, so they are more relaxed and will likely have looser lips around you. And, well…”
He laughs despite the fact that they’re in the middle of an argument. “No, not that, although that’s also true. I meant the other thing, when you realized how hard this job really is and you started to become jaded and disillusioned about our work. Remember that?”
About half an hour into making fun of Maria Hill and constructing the outlines of their battle plan, Pepper poses a very important question, “What about the President?”
“This has been quite the journey, and I honestly could not have done it without this fantastic group of talented and passionate people. You all have very bright futures ahead of you, and if I could employ all of you under my office, I would.” There’s a smattering of laughter. “I fervently hope that you continue on this path that we have walked on during the campaign. Our government needs more young people like you, people who want nothing more than a better future for the next generation. I could not thank you enough.” They all applaud.
“I don’t owe you anything, Hammer,” Pepper tells him with a scoff. “Especially not after that stunt you pulled in 2004.”
They all look at one another in absolute shock. No one speaks. Even Natasha is dumbfounded. Darcy looks absolutely elated, as if she was expecting this reaction. Clint is just leaning against a wall, trying to hide a smirk that’s playing on his lips.
“Understatement of the century,” Steve mutters under his breath, the technology clearly overwhelming him.
“I’m sure the White House will be glad to know that their choice of alcohol has been found adequate by one of their top military contractors,” Pepper responds, unimpressed.
“Mr. Stark?” The voice is gentle and familiar, and it’s clear that a man is at the other end of this call.
Tony groans. “You left those two alone together? Do you not remember the last time they went around this town without a chaperone? Christ, I’m going to have to pay for the damages. Again,” he complains to Clint. And to Darcy: “You, stop ordering my assistant around.” Darcy only shrugs, unapologetic.
When he gets in the car on his way home, he calls Kate immediately. “So?” she asks, clearly hungry for news.
-checked everything. We’re going to the White House, where I’m sure the kitchens are stocked to high heavens with anything and everything you can think of. We have everything. We’ll be fine.”
Phil nods in agreement. “Stark is crazy, but he’s not stupid. And he’s also a pretty fair-minded guy. He’ll see the merits of shutting down the government.”
“Yes, of course,” Tony replies quickly. He shifts in his seat and tries to condition himself back to normal. He rubs his temples and tries to smile—he’s the Speaker of the House, for crying out loud—and puts his game face on. “How can I be of service, Mr. President?”
“Oh god, we’ve turned him soft. Go, before both our bosses lose their minds.” Darcy laughs and waves at them, making her way to Clint’s office. Tony turns to Kate once Darcy turns around the corner.
“As of fifteen minutes ago, no. He was able to escape the DOJ safehouse in Georgia with his wife and kid before hostiles barged in, but we don’t know what his status is now. Tony, we need to call this in.”
“Of course you can. You’re welcome in the house anytime, Ru. It’s just that—” he rubs the back of his neck, unsure how to tell her.
Who knew that he would become the most powerful Democrat in the country? Not him, surely, not all those years ago when he gave his dad’s legacy the middle finger. He went to Stanford as a big, gigantic
this isn’t just some smuggling ring trying to profit off of your country’s most precious resource. Why else would you have finally agreed for the State department to send in a delegation to Wakanda?”
Steve crosses his arms, leans against the bookshelf and studies the man in front of him. “You’re a surprising man, Tony Stark.”
Tony blinks, as if processing what Steve had just said. “I’m just a guy who likes to tinker,” he replies slowly.
“We cannot do this here, Tony,” T’Challa tells him, his face grim. “Not even your White House is safe.”
“Aww, come on! Can’t you make an exception? Today is a beautiful day. We get to go out and play tomorrow, isn’t that exciting?”
After a quick debrief in the driveway while waiting for their respective rides, Tony thanks his team for a job well done and sends them all home. It’s been a long, emotionally taxing night for everyone, and they all reserve a few hours of rest before they regroup in the morning.
“180 degrees in the thigh, 170 degrees in the breast, and 165 degrees in the stuffing—makes the perfect turkey. Not even you can deny that, Cass.”
"Yeah, that was the best." Definitely involved making out at the Red Rock Canyon, going by her sigh. It implies a desire for a repeat performance and Tony is taken to staring at Kate and Darcy with a look of bewilderment. Kate catches his expression and she laughs, playfully smacking Darcy off her desk. Darcy complies, smoothing down her skirt.
Tony raises his hands in defeat. “Whatever you say.” He sits behind his desk to get to work. “Now, let’s talk strategy.”
godfather, and second of all, that’s nearly a seven-hour train ride!” Tony exclaims in exasperation. “And I had Kate confirm your
“Who isn’t enthusiastic about money?” Pepper shoots him an incredulous look, and he backs off. “Look, we got off on the wrong foot and I’m sorry. Will the distinguished representative from California allow me to start over?”
“First Billy the Secret Service agent, now the President of the United States. I would like it if people in authority positions stopped encouraging my goddaughter’s mischief,” Tony complains.
but he only smiles and kisses her forehead. “This is going to be a mess, Pep. We have to be ready for what’s coming,” he tells her, trying desperately to change the subject. Tony has gone from Too Much Tension to My Stunted EQ Can’t Handle This Anymore.
Thor nods. “We’re both perfectly healthy and there is nothing wrong biologically that should be hindering us from having a baby.”
America’s beautiful wild hair makes it easy to spot her in the crowd of government workers trying to let off some steam in the middle of the workweek. There are a number of people trying to get her attention, which isn’t surprising at all—America is bright and commanding, the kind of person everyone wants to be friends with. Kate was easily drawn to her during their first year of university, and they’ve been friends ever since.
It takes three minutes, but to Steve it feels like forever. “Line three, sir,” Sharon calls out from outside the Oval.
“But make sure to send a not-so-subtle message to the Party—tell them to keep it in their pants for a while. We will be watching them. Understood?”
“We fuck, Clint. And we work well together. That’s all this really ever was, I thought you knew that.”
Natasha tilts her head and smiles mischievously. “The Republicans are in the doghouse and we’re in bed with the President. I’d kiss Stark, but I don’t really want to get on that train, no offense.”
Pepper rolls her eyes. “No need to keep flirting, Tony, you’ve already slept with the both of us.” She takes a sip from her coffee and inclines her head, eyebrow raised as if to challenge Tony.
Kate takes a moment before she speaks. “Maybe you should move in. This apartment is much nearer to the Hill than yours, and you already spend most of your time here anyway,” she proposes gently. “You don’t need to decide now, but the offer stands.”
Tony smiles mischievously. “You know me, I like to live on the wild side.” Then his tone shifts, his face serious. “I’m not asking for kicks. I know we’re walking on some really dangerous ground here legally, but you have to give me something—anything—I can work with.”
to show that they’re more than just the President and the Speaker of the House. They may be Steve and Tony to each other now, but Washington is certainly not ready for that just yet. Tony can play his part well, but can Steve? The Jaws theme plays in Tony’s head as he waits for the President to make his grand entrance, even more excited at the events that will unfold. Whatever happens, at least he’s having a lot of fun.
Tony looks up at Scott, his face unreadable but soft. The professor sees what could have been gratitude, but it’s gone in an instant.
“None of us would be here without you. None of us would be here if we didn’t believe in your vision. And so help me god if 64.9 million Americans don’t believe in it, too.” The President-elect says nothing. Bruce tightens his clutch on Steve’s shoulder. “I’ve known you for years. You wouldn’t have done this if it didn’t feel right.”
“Even if he did, you know that’s not why I’m here. Taking care of you isn’t part of my job description,” Kate tells him, a little frustrated. “But sometimes, it can be part of being your best friend. You know how important you are to me.”
Their food arrives, and Pepper watches Natasha, her face not moving a muscle. This is the Democrats’ behind-the-scenes puppeteer deep in thought, putting the pieces of a puzzle together in her head. It takes about another five minutes before Natasha finally shows some emotion: she purses her lips, which means she’s not happy, but not entirely surprised that she isn’t.
“Believe me, you’re not the only one feeling that way right now,” Tony tells him with a small, nervous laugh. “I don’t know how to address you. I’m not entirely sure our usual exchanges are applicable in this setting.”
Bruce chuckles and places his mug on the President’s desk. He’s about to say something when Steve’s executive secretary, Sharon, enters and announces the arrival of the Vice President.
“Thank you, I will let him know.” Tony steps in closer, his demeanor turning somber. “Why didn’t you call me?”
Clint doesn’t say anything yet, or make it known how he’s responding emotionally to Kate being here. He takes a swig of his beer. “You doing okay?”
“I only trust Tony Stark with two things in this world: fixing my gadgets, and politics. He knows what he’s doing, Kate. What’s with the sudden doubting?”
She takes a few minutes before she gets up from bed. The day feels like it’s going to be an unpleasant one already. She’s had so many of these in the past couple of months, and to be honest, she doesn’t think it’s going to get any better soon. Talk about waking up on the wrong side of the bed.
“Yes, well. All the tests came out negative, which is good, so we’ve ruled out anything serious. I’ve consulted with the resident OB on duty, and she agrees with me that it’s fatigue associated with your first trimester,” the doctor informs them calmly.
“Look,” Tony interrupts. “I’m all for you guys coming to my house, eating my food, drinking my booze, and making fun of all my life choices, but we’ve been going around in circles and no one has brought anything new to the table. So either we make the first move, or we wait for him to do it.”
“Listen to me you good for nothing bastard. Tony is not a whore, he is not worthless, he is not anything of these things you you told him. I swear to God if you ever touch him, look at him or even breathe in his direction then I will kill you in the slowest, most painful way you could ever imagine. Now leave.”
“You do that, but tomorrow Ana! I don't need to be awoken at three in the morning to you throwing around pots and pans.”
“No, no, my boy. Sir believes that we are currently in England visiting your aunt Peggy. Oh, you should probably call her and tell her that you are alright. She has been worried sick and even though she is in no condition to fly she he's threatened to walk here from London unless she knows for sure that you are safe.”
The archer put down the eggs on the counter and slowly walked over to his girlfriend with his head bowed down. When he reached her she grabbed his ear and started to drag him out of there.
Arriving at the apartment put Bruce on edge and he couldn't help but to inspect the area for threats. He feared that there were more HYDRA goons around, spying on them at that very moment. His thoughts only escalated from there. What if someone had followed Fury to the mansion when he saved Tony? What if they were gonna come after him again? How could he have been so stupid? Thinking that there was any chance for him to be a part of a mob and still keep Tony out of it all.
“What the hell just happened!? You just threatened to kill him by ripping his spine out through his ass and now you are on nickname bases!?”
Tony froze and felt fear spread through his entire body. He blinked hard up at the scowling face, hoping that what he was seeing wasn't real. He opened his mouth and cursed himself when he heard his voice break.
Tony groaned when his back met the floor and he looked up at Rumlow who was walking towards him. He tried to cover himself with his arms to protect the most sensitive parts of his body but failed miserably.
When they reached the burning facility he had barely stopped the car before he and the rest of the team were out and running towards the fire.
“I don't know! I'm sorry! He was here and the- Right! He said he was hungry! He went to the kitchen to get some food but we were out and I think he mentioned something about groceries. He must have gone to the grocery shop nearby!”
Figuring that a quick trip to the store twenty minutes away wouldn't do any harm he called out to Clint, saying that he was heading out. Clint replied with a “Yeah!”, probably not even hearing what he had said.
It had been almost six months since Tony had been kidnapped by HYDRA and almost a year since he had met the Avengers and his life had turned upside down. He was slowly getting better but couldn't help but also getting more and more nervous the longer time went on. Rumlow was still in the wind and Tony feared that he would show up one day and take everything he loved away from him.
“Ah! Mister Stark! I'm very glad to see you awake, you have been out for quite some time and we were getting worried.”
Tony woke up the next morning from the sore feeling in his behind from the night’s activities and a full bladder. He groaned and tried to sit up from where he had been laying on Steve’s chest. The action caused Steve, who was still asleep, to also groan and tighten his grip on the boy on his chest. Tony rolled his eyes but would have snuggled closer if it didn’t feel like his bladder was about to explode. He managed to wiggle his way out of his lovers arms and limped lightly to the bathroom. When he stepped inside he let out a gasp at the sight in the mirror. He really should stop being surprised over the amount of marks Steve leaves on him after nights like these but it still does every time. He sighed and went to take care of his business and brushed his teeth afterwards. He then walked out only to find his boyfriend still asleep on their bed. Tony was thinking about waking him up with a blow job when he got a much better idea.
Suddenly the screen on his laptop went black and he cursed out loud. Within seconds the others were by his side looking at the screen with wide eyes.
Steve kept speeding, not caring about anything but to get to Tony, hoping it wasn't too late. He heard his teammate yelling Tony's name through the phone and running around the house without receiving any answers. Steve's heart kept pounding in his chest and he could feel the eyes of his teammates on the back of his neck.
Tony took a few seconds to process what he had just done before pushing Brock off of him. He pulled his pants up and winces at the pain in his behind and then started to search the dead man for things he could use. He started by removing the plain black T- shirt and putting on himself before he grabbed the keys on his belt, the gun that Rumlow had been carrying and checked it for ammo and also took the walkie talkie. He stood up and stared at the dead man and felt both relief and anxiety. He shuddered and started to limp slightly to the door before using the keys to unlock it and poked his head out to see if there was anyone there. The hallway was empty and he stepped outside and cocked the gun before locking the door behind him, hoping that nobody would open and realize that he was missing.
“Alright guys!” Natasha's voice could be heard throughout the room and everyone immediately shut up “Let's give these love birds some space, everyone come with me, I need coffee. And Bruce, you're coming with me and Clint later, we're gonna pick up Rhodey and Pepper from the airport. They haven't stopped calling since we told them.”
Pepper looked close to tears and her hands were trembling. Rhodey didn't look any better himself. His jaw was clenched and it looked like he was trying to fight back tears.
Steve just rolled his eyes and stood up. He went and made himself and Tony a couple of sandwiches and coffee and put them in front of the genius. Everyone ate and small talked for about an hour until Steve spoke up.
“Oh, that nice man Phil came over earlier today while all of you were out. He was looking for Mr Rogers but since he wasn't here we invited him in for a cup of tea. He told us where you had been and about how you had escaped and that they had found a survivor from the explosion. He said that they had him captured and also promised me and Edwin that we could have a go at him if we'd like to. Oh, how is the food everyone? Edwin and I spent the whole day cooking for Anthony's homecoming.”
“I'm sorry Tony. I know I shouldn't have but, it's  just… If I had been more careful then you wouldn't have gone through all this. I tried so hard to keep you out of this business, once you get involved, there is no turning back. That's not what I wanted for you, I just wanted to keep you safe.”
“Sorry about that. Now let's get back to business.” He nodded at Azazel who put a file on the table between them. “I managed to gather some more information on Tiberius Stone. I also sent one of my best trackers after him and she has been observing him all day. He was seen today in New York with another man who we managed to identify as Brock Rumlow.” He sent a curious expression towards the team at the different levels of horror appeared on their faces.
“Actually I'm meeting him this afternoon for some coffee. He said he wanted to apologize for the way he treated me before.”
“I'll run down to the store and grab some.” He said while changing his pajama shorts for a pair of jeans but decided to keep Steve's shirt on. He grabbed his wallet and headed downstairs. When he passed the kitchen everyone had started to clear the table and Thor was taking care of the dishes. Steve looked up at Tony from where he had been wiping the table and and asked if he wanted company which Tony declined, as much as he loved Steve and the rest of the gang some alone time was appreciated every now and then. He grabbed his jacket and headed down to the local supermarket.
When they finally made it to the room they had been reduced to moaning, kissing messes. Steve threw Tony on the bed but followed soon after, crawling in between the brunettes spread legs. Instead of attaching his lips to Tony's, Steve started sucking on one of his nipples and Tony let out the longest man yet.
“It's okay, it's okay, everything is going to be just fine” she soothed him and Tony was reminded of the first time his father had struck him. He had been five years old and accidentally spilled something in Howard's lab which resulted in the older Stark screaming at his son for fifteen minutes straight before back handing him and kicking him out of the room. Tony had immediately run to Ana since his mother had been at some gala for one of her charities that evening. He had ran directly into the red headed woman's arms, causing her to drop the small basket of laundry that she had been about to fold, and started sobbing. Ana was about to scold the boy when she saw the state he was in. Eyes red and full of tears that were spilling down his flushed cherubic face. Loud sobs were coming out of his mouth and the large handprint on his cheek was getting redder by the second. The woman had immediately understood what had happened and wrapped her arms around the little boy and picked him up where he cuddled closer to her, seeking comfort and protection. She had left the laundry basket on the floor, making a mental note to ask one of the staff members to pick it up later on, and held the little one close to her chest and carried him to the kitchen where she had iced his cheek while pushing down her anger that was directed at the boy's father, instead focusing on comforting the crying boy in her arms. “It's okay my love, everything is going to be fine, I'm right here and I'm never leaving you, I promise.”
The two men walked out of the living room, through the hallway and up the stairs. When they were out of sight Steve put his hand on the small of Tony's back and led him to the rooms. Tony just looked up with a small smile before turning his head forward again. When they reached the rooms they stopped outside one and Steve spoke up.
Tony caught himself staring and turned his head back to Bruce with a faint blush creeping up his tan neck. He cleared his throat and spoke.
Tony turned around to see the whole team standing by the entrance to the kitchen looking at him with curious expressions.
Tony blushed and hid his head behind his hands, Steve just put a hand on his knee and squeezed slightly and sent an unimpressed look to the team, though no one mentioned the slight blush on his cheeks.
Steve's face was starting to burn with embarrassment and tried to remind himself that he was a mob boss, he wasn't supposed to blush like a teenage girl with a crush. He looked down at the brunette and saw that he wasn't faring any better. The team looked at the two with amusement but changed the subject to spare the couple. They had talked for about an hour, catching Tony up on what he had missed since he got kidnapped, when they saw the discomfort spreading on Tony's face.
“Thank you for meeting us mr Lehnsherr.” Steve said gratefully while settling down on the opposite side of the table from Erik. Natasha, Bruce, Clint, Bucky and Thor sat down on either side of him.
“Tony.” Bruce started slowly “Please tell me that you aren't talking about Tiberius Stone here. You know,
After taking some deep breaths like Steve said and trying up failing to fight the blush that spread across his cheeks at the nickname, Tony calmed down again.
“Oh, I was just in the area you know and then I saw you pass by and decided that it was a good time to catch up. So how you been Tones?”
He got to know that Natasha had been born and raised in Russia, despite her flawless English. She had also taught him some basic self defense moves, the woman was scarily good with hand to hand combat.
“Ah, Anthony! I am most pleased to see that you are back with us, the good doctor and the rest of us all have been very concerned about you!”
Steve smirked and let go of Tony which earned him a whine and reached out to the drawer by his bed and pulled out a bottle of lube,
When he managed to get to the entrance he had about four minutes left since in his panic managed to get lost before he found his way again.
“Come on darling” he said while putting the food in the fridge “let's rest a bit until they get back. Everything will be just fine.” He grabbed her hand, placed a gentle kiss on it and led her to the living room.
“Yeah, you didn't know? His birthday was yesterday. Don't worry Steve, he's legal. It's Bruce I should be worried about, guy acts like a mama bear towards him.”
“Yes, his robot, it was his first AI, the boy is a genius. Anyway, we started talking and kind of became friends. A couple of months later I ran into him at a cafe. He had just ran away from home and was homeless, so I offered him a place to stay and recommend him to get a job at Nick’s shop.”
Steve chuckled next to him and put one arm around his shoulders and ate his own chocolate pancakes with the other.
When they had reached the location where they thought Tony was it was obvious what had happened. Cars were burning, windows to shops have been destroyed and people were in hysterics as police, firefighters and ambulances were all around the place, trying to help.
"Over there we have Thor, next to him is Bucky, aka the Winter Soldier" Tony looked towards the big blond man and the handsome brunette next to him with what looked like a metal arm, oh, what Tony wouldn't to get a closer look on that.
They laid there for a few minutes, catching their breaths. Then Steve slowly pulled out of Tony who winced slightly at the feeling. The blonde pressed a kiss to his cheek before getting out from the bed and to the bathroom where he wetted a towel and returned. He cleaned them both up before laying back on the bed and pulling Tony close to his chest.
“Ok, Bucky, you help me carry the bags to the car and Steve, you try and get DUM-E. Come on DUM-E, let's go see Tony.”
“Yes, yes… Okay Aunty, thank you… Mmmhhh, really? Okay, well, tell Uncle Danny I said hi, okay, yeah, love you to, bye!”
Tony saw his chance and plunged the piece of glass right into Rumlow’s neck and hitting the major artery. Brock collapsed on Tony's smaller frame and gurgled on his own blood before stilling completely.
Steve just muttered something in response before tightening his grip on Tony's hand a bit and dragging the laughing genius in with him.
Tony woke up slowly and tried to sit up while fighting the nausea that was arising along with the feeling that someone had bashed his head into a wall. He pulled his knees up and put his head in between them while taking deep breaths so that he wouldn't throw up.
“I can't calm down Bucky! It's been three weeks since he went missing! God knows what they have done to him!? Or maybe he is already dead in a ditch somewhere but we can't know that because we. Can't. Find. Him!”
In the bed laid Tony. What was visible of him that wasn't covered by a blanket was instead covered in cuts, bruises and bandages.
Rumlow, who had now recovered, was running his hands over Tony's thighs, hips and his sides. Tony, still dizzy from the blow to his head, weakly tried to push him off while groaning. Brock only chuckled and gripped his chin and forcing his head up.
Steve stood at the entrance at the room where Tony was staying and couldn't help but let his eyes wander on the smaller boy. He was beautiful, despite the large bruise on his face. He was also quite short, only around 5”8 compared to Stevens own 6"4. Though based on what he had seen back at the apartment the boy had some muscles, must be from working with heavy machines all day.
Maria Stark trembled where she stood, hands shaking as she held a smoking gun up. She was only dressed in a nightgown along with the first silk robe she had gotten her hands on as she hurried out of her room after hearing screams and gunshots in her home. Her usually elegantly styled hair was a mess and her beautiful face was sweaty and pale as snow, the result of a mixture of the horror within her and the lack of sun she had received during her years spent in a drug induced high. But her eyes showed nothing but fire and the kind of determination to protect her child that only a mother could have. When she saw that her husband was no longer moving and that her son was unharmed she immediately dropped the gun that she had picked off of one of the many bodies that littered around her house. She ran on unsteady legs straight at her son and wrapped him in her arms while looking him over for injuries while ignoring the tears that were streaming down her face.
“Wait wait wait! Tony, are you sure about this? I don't want you to feel forced to do anything you aren't a 100% comfortable with. And besides, it hasn't been that long since, you know. And I don't want you to feel pressured.”
Steve trailed one of his hands down to Tony's erection and started to jack him off. Tony moaned so loud that Steve was pretty sure that the whole house heard them and he loved it.
“Don't worry pretty boy!” he called out over his shoulders “We'll be back tomorrow and we are gonna have so much fun!”
When Tony reached out to grab a shirt from his drawer his face was suddenly covered in fabric. The removed it from his face and saw that Steve had tossed him one of his own navy blue V neck T-Shirt. The blonde wore a little smirk and raised an eyebrow at Tony's direction.
Tony looked around the room, noticing that all eyes were on him and that everyone were tense, like they were waiting to attack. He averted his eyes and looked right at Bruce who wore a guilty and worried expression. He sighed and dragged his hand through his hair.
Just as he was about to fall asleep again the door to the cellar opened and in stepped the man he hated most of them all.
“What the hell are you doing out out of bed!? You need to rest, you'll never heal if you don't take it easy!”
His thoughts, however, were cut short when the little window on the door is pried open and familiar blue eyes were peeking in.
He was really hoping that Coulson had found some survivors so that he could take revenge for what they had done.
Steve nodded his head with a small smile and started to remove his lover's shirt. He latched on the right nipple and started to suck, lick and bite on it while playing with the other with his hand.
When Tony gave him the “go” sign he gently grabbed his hips and started to pull out an inch before pressing back in. He repeated the motion before going out further and pressing in, all while picking up the speed. Soon he was almost all the way out, only the tip still in before he slammed back in hard. Tony threw his head back in pleasure and moaned loudly.
Steve woke up by mumbling outside his door. He looked down and saw that Tony was still fast asleep on his chest. Steve smiled down at him before concentrating on his friends voices behind the door.
He took a pillow and placed it underneath Tony's hips to gain him better access before grabbing the bottle and poured some lube into his hand before slicking himself up.
“I…” he started slowly “I honestly don't know what to say ma'am. We have been so focused with trying to find Tony that we didn't really think about informing anyone else about… About what happens to him. I can't even begin to describe how sorry I am.”
The waiter, a fairly handsome man who looked like he was in his later twenties, took their orders and kept sending Tony small winks and smiles which caused Steve to tighten his hold on him and only relaxed when the man had left.
That was the last thing Tony heard before he fell into a deep sleep, feeling safer now than ever in his boyfriends arms and knowing that his new family were right outside the door, keeping them safe
The team immediately sat down and looked at her in anticipation. The doctor took a chair and sat down in front of them and started talking.
“Yeah.” Was the response added with a chuckle. Tony looked up from where his face had been pressed against Steve's neck and looked into the beautiful blue eyes. Steve smiled at Tony when an idea popped into his head. He leaned down and pressed his lips against the brunettes. Tony responded immediately and put his hand behind Steve's neck to pull him closer.
“No you are not, you almost fell three times trying to go to the bathroom yesterday. And stop whining, we are going home now, I was expecting you to be jumping up and down in excitement, you have basically been crawling on the walls since you woke up.”
Tony's hand shot up to his neck and remembered the amount love bites on it. He blushed furiously and looked up at Steve who wore an identical expression.
He slowly made his way and sat down on the chair next to the bed and took one of Tony's small hands in his own large ones. He held it like it was made of china and would break in he as much as shook it slightly.
Jarvis just chuckled before a grim expression took over his face and he put a protective arm around the teens shoulders.
“The only one whose brains are getting blown out is yours unless you let him go.” Tony felt his whole body sag in relief at the voice. After a whole week of pure hell Steve's voice was like a blessing from above.
After about fifteen minutes they heard loud voices in the hallway and looked at each other with knowing smiles on their faces. Suddenly the door slammed open and the Avengers were tumbling into the room, followed by Ana and Jarvis. They immediately stopped when they saw Tony awake and both he and his mother were looking at them with amused smiles. Suddenly Tony was surrounded by his family, all shooting questions at him at the same time but all the noise faded out when saw Steve. To say that the blonde was a mess was an understatement. He looked exhausted and had deep bags underneath his eyes, his chins had some small fresh cuts on them along with some shaving foam hind his ear, like he had shaved in a hurry and didn't bother to be careful. His hair was a mess, he had not even tried to style it after his shower, like he just wanted to get clean as fast as possible to get back to his lover. Steve was wearing an old pair of blue jeans along with a black T-shirt and a jacket over.
“Of course, I hoped that we would never have to meet during such circumstances, I am truly sorry. But know that I will do anything in my power to help you, especially since you helped me when I was in your position.” While he spoke in the end his gaze drifted towards a young brunette with amazingly blue eyes and sinfully red lips who was wiping the counter of the bar with a towel. The brunette looked up when he felt eyes on him and smiled at Erik while putting the towel away and making his way towards them. The boy was a couple of inches shorter than Erik, probably around Tony's height and he was slender built. He had a large smile on his face when he approached them and bent down to press a sweet kiss on Erik’s lips. He then turned to face the team opposite and his smile turned into one of kindness and gratefulness which caused the team to stand up in respect.
Tony woke up to the feeling that his chest was on fire. He shot up but groaned in pain and looked down. His chest was covered in bandages with a little dried blood that had seeped through on it.
Tony gasped and arched his back when he felt Steve's tongue lap across his hole and he was gripping the sheets tightly. His cock was hard and leaking pre-come onto his stomach while he squirmed.
And always remember!! I'm a slut for kudos and reviews!! XD I love you all so so so much, never forget that!!!
Steve immediately wrapped his arms protectively around the smaller man and whispered reassuringly into his ear.
Tony slowly walked towards Steve, eyes dark in arousal and he got on the bed and settled on all fours in front of him. He slowly lowered his head and started to press kisses from the blonde's chest down to the base of his groin.
“Greetings my friends!!” Came Thor’s booming voice as he marched into the room with Natasha walking calmly behind the gentle giant. Both men jumped apart and started to blush madly.
Thor, Bucky and Bruce were sitting by the dining table and going through the security feeds from where Tony had been taken outside the cafe, trying to see if they had missed anything while passing around the pot of coffee between them and drinking straight from it (they had given up on using mugs after the fourth pot).
“Those are the rules Tony. And besides, you got shot in the leg, you are gonna have to sit in the chair for a while.
“Steve, I'm sure, I know what I'm doing and I trust you completely. And besides, the doc said that most of my wounds had healed completely except for a few burns and some broken bones, she just said to be careful. Please, let me have this?”
DUN DUN DUN!!!! Cliffhanger!!!! But the good news are that Brock and Tiberius are finally dead and it was painful XD
“Rumlow” started Natasha and cleared her throat “Rumlow is a member of HYDRA. He was the one who tortured Tony the first time he was kidnapped. If he got a hold of him again, I'm afraid he won't even be alive when we find him.”
“There is a basement near mister Stark's office that he suddenly forbid us from going anywhere near about a week ago. There has also been two men coming down there regularly during that time. That must be where he is keeping Anthony!”
Steve learned that Tony loved to build. He could fix and upgrade almost anything within technology and that he had designed a bunch of inventions himself.
Some of the Avengers went to get themselves and the others chairs and food, they were gonna be here a while. Bruce sat on the chair on the other side of Tony with a newly wrapped hand and a pinched expression on his tear streaked face.
I am so so so sorry for the delay but school is finally over (for this year, one more year to go!) so I haven't had time to writ anything. And also I have been fighting a serious case of writers block, but hey! Better late than never I guess?
“He did lose a lot of blood, especially from where he had been shot and I'm afraid that his chest has been through severe trauma and that his heart is weaker than it should be and that his lung capacity has gone down around 30%.
Maria was the last to leave the room, but before she did, she grabbed Steve's arm and glared into his eyes.
“Tony” she started with a soft voice. “You know how much we love you and don't you ever, and I mean ever, call yourself a burden again. Howard Stark is an abusive, drunk loser who missed out on knowing an incredibly amazing son.”
When the pants were removed, Steve was met by Tony's hard cock dripping precum on his stomach. Tony spread his legs to give Steve better access and the man settled between them. He gripped Tony's member and gave a few strokes, watching as the teen squirmed underneath him.
“HEY!” Came Clint's outraged cry “Why does he get waffles before me!? I've been waiting for almost an hour but I didn't get anything!”
Around six more agents showed up blocking the hallway he had come through. He was trapped from both ways and Schmidt chuckled darkly.
The blonde grabbed his hand and they started to walk in comfortable silence. When they were about to step into the kitchen again Tony suddenly stopped. Steve looked at him with a frown.
Tony looked around the room and saw that everyone was giving him small, encouraging smiles and felt Steve slightly squeezing his shoulder and he couldn't help but to smile back before yawned.
“WAIT! WAI-” his screams were cut off with a gurgling sound as a bullet pierced his throat and he choked on his own blood. He fell on his side next to Tiberius whose face was turned to him. The last thing Brock Rumlow ever saw was the battered face of Tiberius Stone, the blondes eyes, wide and empty staring into his soul.
“That was my aunt Peggy. She and uncle Danny live in London and since Jarvis told her what happened she has been calling me everyday to make sure I'm fine. They would have come here if they could but aunt Peggy is in no condition to travel that far.”
So Tony had moved into Bruce's small apartment and managed to get a job at an auto shop that paid fairly well and he had managed to get a schedule that allowed him the time to finish his college degree online. These days on his free time Tony spent most of it programming his AI that he had named JARVIS after his father figure.
"Of course it's a big deal Tony, you're turning eighteen. You are now legally an adult. Come on make a wish."
“We didn't want anyone to recognize him as Tony Stark. His dad might have found him and he really doesn't need that right now. And Rogers is a very common last name so we just went ahead with that. Plus, you are a possessive bastard, figured that you would prefer that.”
Tony's hair was disheveled and his lips were red and a little swollen from the kiss. He was a little breathless from the lack of oxygen the kiss provided and his pupils were blown wide. Needless to say, he looked hot as hell. Steve licked his own lips and smirked a bit.
He followed his mental map and turned left where he was met two armed guards heading towards him. Before even thinking he brought his gun up and shot them straight between the eyes. He kept running, trying not to think about the wounds on his body that felt like they were on fire.
Tony knew what he really meant, he didn't legally have to go back to his father even if he would be found. It was a huge relief and Tony couldn't contain the smile that stretched out on his face.
Tony peeked up from where he was hiding his face and looked directly into Steve’s eyes. Before he knew it he was out of Maria's arms and was crashing into the Captain's chest and wrapped his arms around his neck. Steves was hugging back just as tightly, his arms around Tony's waist and holding him as close as physically possible without injuring him any further. The blonde buried his face in Tony's neck, letting his scent fill his nose again, feeling like he could finally breathe again.
He took a shuddering breath and was about to stand up to find a way out when a pling came from the door and it was slowly opening and there stood the three men that had managed to turn his life into a living hell.
The three of them walked side by side to the common room, Thor had left a few minutes before to gather the others.
Alright guys! Last chapter! This has been one hell of a ride and I want to thank you all for sharing this experience with me and I love each and every single one of you! Thank you all for the kudos and comments they have really motivated me to write and evolve my English vocabulary! <3
He started to walk out of the cafe on swaying legs but had to stop after a few steps to lean against the wall for support. Suddenly there were arms around him along with Ty's familiar cologne that he had once loved so much.
What is this? An update? Dear lord I have to get better at this. I was actually almost done with this chapter a couple of weeks ago but I've had some trubble in life, I have had some pretty big fights with three of my "best" and only "friends" where they all ganged up against me even if the fights were about something petty and this Friday they "dumped" me so to say. Oh well, I guess 10-12 years of friendship doesn't mean jack shit to them... :P
planned to be more suave but the reality of the date is sharper than expected. He’s incapable of maintaining an unaffected mask in front of Steve because the fact is, Tony is very much affected. Steve’s hand is warm and dry. His fingers are broad. The brush of his body against Tony’s makes heat gather in Tony’s center.
against his own. It’s like pouring gasoline on a forest fire and Tony’s happy to burn. His fingers clutch at Steve’s jacket before he realizes he should be doing the opposite, mostly because Steve’s fingers have dove straight down between them and are frantically pulling on Tony’s belt. Tony meanwhile, tries to shove Steve’s jacket off but the damn thing gets stuck around Steve’s elbows because he’s still doing
“Well. Horatio just made a seriously bad joke and you didn’t even groan. And you’ve sighed at least three times since the show started and that was only ten minutes ago.”
They’re almost at the med-bay but Sam pauses. He stops and shoots Steve a mildly confused look. “Because it’s Tony? And you guys haven’t really made up after
The wetness between his thighs grows; it’s uncomfortable as hell by this point. Tony squirms in his seat, clumsy fingers struggling with his belt buckle. He wants to touch himself. He
“Funny you should say that,” Carol says, fingers tapping against her glass. “I asked him the same thing a couple of weeks ago and he refused to say anything then too.”
Feeling weary beyond words, Tony shakes his head, “Not this time, Sam.” Meeting Sam’s sympathetic gaze, Tony smiles weakly. “It is what it is. I knew that this is what my choices would lead to. It was a price I was ready to pay.”
Despondent, Kamala rejects Nova’s offer to hang out after they’ve changed. As she gathers her things from her locker, she decides she’s going to ask ammi if she’ll make her some daal chawal. Some good food and a nap should help her cheer up. She waves at Vision and Nova on her way out, wondering if Miles is still around. Maybe she could catch a ride with-
“I told you. Tony got whacked with a love spell of some kind and we need you here because if you’re not, he says his chest hurts.”
Tony’ll have to schmooze up to, or vice versa, if he lets the committee give the seat away to someone else.
“Sick to my stomach with worry? Counting down the seconds waiting for you to wake up? Torn between wanting to shake some sense into you and hugging you forever?” The man asks.
Steve waits a few seconds, waiting for Tony to continue. But when he doesn't, with his heart in his throat, Steve asks, “Think what?”
, you know? Steve’s had this epiphany more than a couple of times now, but it does him in every time. Tony used to be his best friend. There was so much love between them and now there’s nothing left between them except anger, distrust, and fear.
But like a hummingbird flitting between flowers, the look is here and then gone, replaced with a tight smile and a curt, “Steve. We weren’t expecting you. I imagine this isn’t a social call so, how can we help?”
Steve pulls out a cell phone that he’d confiscated a while ago from a weapons smuggler. It’s a magical trap that’ll help Steve figure out if Tony’s okay or not. Stephen’s put a spell on the device that’ll activate if it comes into contact with someone who’s being mind controlled. Not only that but it’ll render Tony immobile. Steve will cart Tony off to Stephen to break the spell and hopefully, that’ll be the end of that.
Tony shakes his head, tears gathering at the corners of his eyes again. He takes a step back, out of Steve’s embrace. “Not the way I love you.”
? What the hell is his mouth doing? That’s almost insulting! Shoulders up to his ears and cheeks hot, Steve steals a peek at Tony, who is chuckling warmly. “Yeah. Like I said before, personal grooming takes a back seat when you’ve got a kid.” He strokes the Van Dyke with a wicked grin. “It still looks good though, even with the white.”
The next day, Kamala peeks into Tony’s lab. The handsome hero is running diagnostics on his suit. He’s got a tablet and stylus in hand as he dictates his notes to FRIDAY. She frets for a moment, wondering if this is a bad time. Sure Tony had said that he’d help her with homework whenever she wanted but he clearly looks super busy and it’d be rude to inter-
Steve and Tony have totally forgotten that she’s there. Which, she can understand. Afterall, she’s supposed to be passed out. But it seems like they’ve also forgotten that they’re in a public place. Any second now, a nurse or doctor could open the curtains and see two of the most famous Avengers canoodling!
Tony opens his mouth to thank Steve and tell him no, it’s not something Steve can help with. But thankfully, his brain works faster and reminds him that
But he’s managed to reserve a private table at this Japanese restaurant Tony remembers Steve loving. In fact, his assistant went above and beyond and found him two tickets to a performance showcase show by the Philharmonic. He’s promised her a hefty Christmas bonus for that incredible feat because the show had sold out weeks ago! He’s not sure what magic she’d used but he’s grateful for it.
It hurts like hell to realize that they’ve both been nurturing the same insecurities, the same wounds. How much time have they wasted due to this misunderstanding? If either of them had been more open about their feelings for each other, how many tragedies could have been averted? How much hurt could have been prevented?
There’s a beat before Miles quietly says, “Kinda puts a damper on making superheroing a career, doesn’t it?”
Before Steve has time to process this new information, Tony’s turning back to look at him. Almost immediately, the good humor in Tony’s eyes fades away, replaced with concern as he studies Steve’s expression. “What is it? I promise I’m fine. Just some bruises but nothing more serious than that.”
Steve’s lashes are slightly wet when he blinks. He raises their linked fingers together to kiss Tony’s knuckles and tells him, “Lead the way.”
that swells in him; it runs deeper than the Marinas Trench. It’s dangerous to hope at this point. Either of them could die tomorrow. It’s a cost Steve’s ready to pay if it means restoring the balance in the universe. But… this is also reason to
be ready for this. This isn’t the truth he knows. Steve’s not sure he’s strong enough to accept this because it flies in the face of every assumption he’s held for... since...
Steve can’t breathe. His heart’s racing inside his chest. His body’s too hot and too cold. He’s shaking. He feels Tony squeezing his wrist and feels something inside of him creaking dangerously. A little more pressure and something inside of Steve is going to collapse. All his assumptions. His tower of righteous anger and hurt.
Tony doesn’t seem to receive those silent signals. Instead, he stands in front of Steve, looking happy-as-can-be and abuzz with energy as he asks, voice low but obviously pleased, “Were you worried about me?”
Jesus. The way Tony’s looking at Steve is the stuff of movies. There’s so much adoration there it makes Kamala want to kick her feet. “You could tell?”
His kind smile has a tint of melancholy to it that makes her want to hug Tony. The only reason she doesn’t is because he gently ruffles her hair and tells her, “‘Were’ being the operative word. There’s no going back from some of the choices we’ve both made. You find friends, you lose friends. That’s just a part of life.”
A gentle shoulder touch snaps Tony out of his thoughts. “Don’t be so hard on yourself,” Steve says gently. “If your heats are irregular, there’s not a lot you could do.”
It’s a flame that’s never really extinguished for him, his crush on Steve. It always flares up every time Steve’s single, various “what-if’s” and wild “maybe’s” stoke the fire on. His imagination tends to run wild imagining different scenarios in which they confess their feelings for each other and let biology take over. It’s particularly worse tonight because it’s a rare instance where Tony’s single as well. His omega-brain is preening with delight that
!” she interrupts, staring up into his surprised eyes. “If you had the choice to be his best friend again. Would you take it?”
Every part of tonight, he’s going to etch it into his soul, right next to the part of him where it says “I love Steve Rogers.”
“Isn’t it too soon?” Steve groans, biting his bottom lip when Tony’s lips kiss his jugular. Pride rushes through him at the whimper that slips through Steve’s defences.
Steve’s mind ticks off all the times Tony’s put himself in danger to save Steve. He remembers Tony saying that Captain America was more important than Iron Man and bites down a sigh. Steve hopes they can have a conversation about that later because Steve
wishes he could bail on this dinner all together but him and Pepper have a deal. He gets to bail on practically any event (provided there’s extenuating circumstances aka a superhero emergency) provided he will attend three events in full every year. The first event is the Maria Stark Foundation’s Annual Charity Ball. The second is a fundraiser all the Avengers participate in to help raise money for a children’s hospital. And the third is this particular dinner, whose proceeds go towards financing STEM and art programs for schools across the nation.
As Steve shakes Kim’s hand, Tony viciously stomps down on the green crawling up his throat. But that jealousy gets stuck, like a bone in his throat that won’t budget no matter how hard he swallows. He even presses a delicate fingertip against his Adam’s apple, wondering if maybe there’s a genuine physical obstruction in his throat but there’s nothing there. It’s all in his mind.
It’s the fear that hits Steve like a sledgehammer to the chest. Their relationship has crossed the point of no return, hasn’t it? It’s something he’s known but there’s knowing and then there’s
, why isn’t there more leg room? Tony wants to spread his legs and get a good angl- actually. Why does he still have pants on? There’s just too many things wrong with this scenario.
“I don’t think we can afford to wait that long, Stephen.” Steve grinds out. “A lot of things can happen in two months. Is there anyone else I can talk to?”
“Yeah,” Steve laughs. “Pretty much. But that’s what it was. It felt... things just clicked in that moment for me. The way you were looking at me, I knew that you cared for me the same way I care for you.”
Which is why, when they’re standing in the private reception area in Stark Tower, in front of the elevator that goes straight up to Tony’s penthouse, and Steve’s rocking back on his heels, asking, “So, when should we go out again? Full disclosure, I don’t want to wait another two weeks to go out again. So, are you free on Friday?” There’s only one thing Tony wants to do. He wants to kiss Steve.
Cap says something that makes Steve grin, eyes squeezing shut as his face ducks down. And then he looks up, facing the school. Then it’s Steve’s turn to freeze. There’s her answer.
“I know,” Steve murmurs back, hand coming to rest on top of Tony’s. Guiding it higher so that Steve’s lips can brush a kiss on Tony’s wrist. “But I want to.”
Jesus. They’re four simple words and yet they send a bolt of lust through Tony. His hand slides down, feeling the grain of Steve’s stubble, the pounding of his jugular, the softness of his coat. That last one needs to go.
“You twisted my arm for all it’s worth,” Tony grumbles, no heat in his words as he flatten’s the wrinkles out of Steve’s tie. Under his palm, Steve’s chest rises and falls slowly. Tony finds himself matching the next inhale and all he can smell is Steve. The clean, woodsy scent sparks heat deep in Tony’s stomach.
Steve grumbles something under his breath, far too low for Kamala to catch. Tony whispers something back that makes Steve make an odd choking sound.
Tony’s ready to weep with delight and crawl into Steve’s lap but Steve it seems, has other plans. Manhandling Tony plans apparently because he throws the car door open and yanks Tony out through the drivers side. He stumbles out, tripping over his own feet a couple of times on his way to the elevator.
He’s quick to tear his eyes away from the attractive sway of Tony’s hips and shift back to Tony’s face. He needs to focus on the mission. He needs to know which Tony he’s dealing with. And for that, Tony’s eyes will be the dead giveaway. When Tony had been inverted? His eyes had burned electric blue. If Tony’s lost his morals again, then his eyes would reflect that. But when he pays attention, there’s just Tony’s usual eyes. Except they seem to be clearer,
thinking about how his heat is less than a week away and he doesn’t have an alpha partner to help him through it. Plus there’s no one he really trusts so, Tony’s going to have a painful heat this time around. He’d think about hiring someone from a discreet, trustworthy agency but he feels too morose to even consider finding someone else so soon.)
“It’s kind of hard to explain,” Steve begins slowly. Tony’s metaphorically and literally on the edge of his seat in anticipation. Somewhere nearby, someone throws up. Kamala tries hard not to grimace at how incredibly unromantic the mood is. After half a minute of thoughtful silence, Steve looks down to grin at Tony. “It felt like the right time.”
, okay? If he has to choose between medical inaccuracies versus forensic-science inaccuracies? Tony’ll pick medicine.
Tony is smiling at him, far too gently, with far too much understanding, and with far too much love. It’s shameful to admit it, even to himself, but when Tony’s starts to rub his back? Steve feels his legs turn to water. How he stays standing as Tony speaks is beyond Steve’s understanding.
That is, until Maria Hill calls him and reminds him if he doesn’t submit his paperwork, she’s going to kick his ass. She sounds like she means it so Steve, with tremendous reluctance, pulls the reports closer.
“I won’t need them,” Steve tells Hill as they make their way to the landing bay. At least, he’s hoping he won’t. Between him and the other Avengers, Steve’s confident they’ll be able to hold Tony down if things go South. He has to assume that nothing has gone wrong yet because Sam or Carol haven’t reached out to him. “Has the team given any updates about Tony’s status?”
Steve’s answering grin is brilliant and bright. With a pained noise, Tony draws Steve back in for a kiss. And another. And another, until they’re clinging to each other. Until the only thing that’s keeping Tony’s feet on the ground is the fact that he’s anchored to Steve.
The look he gets from his best friend disagrees. Tony, however, finds his attention drawn to Carol because she looks ready to thump him. Probably for keeping her in the dark but come on! She should know that he’s not that type of guy! But abruptly, Carol’s indignation disappears. Instead, there’s pure confusion left behind.
, the man falls asleep. Steve takes a nap of his own but it doesn’t take long for him to wake up again. He’s the type of person who needs a quick nap after sex and after that, he’s raring to go. But Tony has fallen well and truly asleep.
He can joke with Steve, tease him, and even pick up his hand and kiss his knuckles when he feels the urge. He doesn’t have to hide in front of Steve. He could roll up his sleeves as he ate, steal a piece of sushi out from under Steve’s nose and offer him a bite of his eel dish in return. He can run his admiring eyes over Steve’s form as he delicately picks up some sashimi and savors the taste of it.
Ana glared at him for a minute longer before turning her glare to the rest of the team that were standing behind their captain with equally guilty expressions. A heavy silence hovered in the room, tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. In the end Ana sighed deeply and slumped down back on the couch, feeling decades older than she was. She rubbed her temple with her fingers while leaning into her husband's side. “What have you planned so far? Do you even know where he is?”
Dragging the man with him while limping backwards to the exit when he noticed the blood running down his left thigh. The goon behind him must have hit him with a bullet before Tony killed him.
Tony looked up towards her with a glare but the smirk was still there and she waggled her eyebrows suggestively. Tony and Rhodey were the only people she allowed to see her goofy side of her, to anyone else she was professional and sophisticated.
Tiberius just chuckled while basically carrying the struggling and drugged genius out of the cafe before anyone could spot them.
Tony didn't notice how Tiberius shoulders and smile tensed even more, how his eyes hardened and how his jaw twitched.
Tony fell to the ground with a groan and and pain exploded through his entire body when the man started to kick him wherever he could reach. Tony was on the verge of a panic attack. The smell of liquor, the screaming of insults, the beating. It all reminded him too much of Howard's abuse but he forced himself to concentrate on something else, like how the hell to get out of this situation.
After the trip to the cafe where Tony and Steve had their first date he, Pepper and Rhodey seemed to be glued to each others sides since you never saw them more than a couple of feet from each other. They had kicked Steve out of his and Tony's room for the night so the three of them could have their own little sleepover. They ate junk food and traded stories from the past year. It was a blast and Tony couldn't remember being happier than he was with his new family and his oldest friends.
Black spots had started to appear in his vision when the kicks suddenly stopped when a gunshot rang out. Tony looked up to see his attacker slumped on the ground with his eyes wide open and a bullet hole in his forehead.
After about an hour Tony had grown both bored and hungry, the fun of beating Clint went over after the first five times.
Tony just curled up on himself and debated whether it was worth going to work today or not. After laying there and argumenting with himself for a couple of minutes he figured that it wasn't worth the death stare he would receive from Fury. So got up and put on the same pair of jeans but a black T-Shirt this time. When he finished getting dressed and brushing his teeth he headed towards the kitchen. Bruce was nowhere to be found so he must have left for work, with a mob. Man, that was gonna take some time for Tony to get used to.
"It started a couple of years ago. I had just gotten fired after I lost my temper" right, Bruce's anger issues were nothing to joke about "and after that nobody really wanted to hire a doctor that could lose control like that. That's when a guy from the clinic suggested that I look Steve up, that he could get me a job. I did as I was told and went to him, after some time he offered me a job with them and even if I knew what I was getting myself into I accepted, I was desperate for a job. After a while I got to know them and realized that it wasn't so bad. They became like a family to me." Bruce finished with a soft smile.
This cannot be possible!” Ana exclaimed as she shot up from the couch she had been sitting on with Edwin beside her. Her husband was now staring at nothing, his face pale and hands shaking at what he had been told. At what had happened and possibly still happening to his precious boy. And especially by whom he had been taken by. He had been working for the Stark’s even before Tony had been born and it was only because of the love he had for the boy that he stayed. He knew exactly how cruel the older Stark could be to his only son and Jarvis had done everything in his power to protect the boy throughout the years. And the fact that it wasn't only Howard who had taken him but Tony's rapist and former partner set fear unlike any other in the old butlers heart. He had comforted Tony many times when he had weeped about Tiberius abandoning him like he was nothing and until this moment he didn't think he could dislike the man any more. And Brock Rumlow… well there isn't really an explanation needed now is there.
Bruce saw his friends reaction and hushed everyone. They gathered up their chairs and sat around him but Natasha quickly stepped outside and called a nurse before she settled on Clint’s lap who wrapped his arms securely around her waist.
Walking down the streets of Manhattan Tony kept thinking about Bruce and his job. Was it dangerous for his friend? How many risks were there? How did the whole thing even work?
After a moment of silence Bruce sighed and told them to take Steve to the infirmary. Bucky was supporting Steve from one side while Tony was holding his hand on the other. They made it to the infirmary where Tony had woken up the first day and put him on the same bed. Everyone left the room but Tony, Steve and Bruce. The doctor took his medical supplies and started to clean his friend up.
I'm so sorry for the long wait guys!! It's just that my depression has been hitting me harder than usual and I've just had such a hard time trying to write and finding motivation. But thank you all for reading this and having the patience to wait for updates! <3
He hadn't noticed the whole team looking at him and wait in for answers, to busy trying not to show his exhaustion.
“I would be happy, but I have to come back to this hell hole again tomorrow anyway for physical therapy.”
Tony did as he was told when Rumlow turned off the safety of the weapon and hesitantly moved towards the door when Tiberius grabbed his arm and harshly pulled him along the three men. Too weak to fight after basically being starved and dehydrated for a week Tony had no choice but to follow to avoid falling over. His head was spinning and each step felt like a struggle but he kept walking.
Sure, they fought sometimes, all relationships had their ups and downs, but their fights never lasted long, and besides, the post fight sex was mind blowing. So yeah, life was great, for now.
Edwin Jarvis was never the kind of man who stuck his nose in other people's business, he preferred to just do his job and stay out of trouble. And when mr Stark had told him not to go down to the basement under any circumstances he had not thought about it much afterwards.
"Thanks Bruce, it means a lot, but you didn't have to, it's really not a big deal." He replied but accepted the small cake anyway.
Tony broke eye contact with the woman to look over her shoulder to see Bruce sitting next to a man with sandy blonde hair and finishing putting bandages around his forearm.
Reacting without thinking he smashed his own forehead against the man’s and while the goon was unbalanced he grabbed him and used one of the moves Natasha had taught him so that Tony was being shielded against the rest of HYDRAs agents that had started firing on him.
Steve snapped his eyes up to meet Tony's own and started to slowly move forward, eyes never breaking contact. He wrapped an arm around the smaller man, close to that perfect ass, and whispered in his ear with a husky voice.
“Damn it! I knew this would happen! I told you I had a bad feeling about this this morning and I'm usually right about this! Why didn't anyone listen to me!?”
“Disappear. Your car was right behind us but when I looked back you weren't there and I thought something happened and I called and you didn't pick up and I freaked out and-”
“Listen here you ungrateful little shit” he hissed out “I have done everything for you. I have fed you, I have clothed you, I have given you an education, I even let you keep that disappointment of a “robot” you made. How dare you do this to me. Running away from home and leaving MIT after everything I have done for you? Do you have any idea how humiliating that was!? No, of course you don't, all you care about is yourself! You have tarnished the Stark name. If you weren't my only heir I would have gotten rid of you a long time ago.” Howard inched his face closer at every insult until their noses almost bumped.
Tony snapped out of his thoughts when Steve sucked on a very sensitive spot below his jaw. He let out a loud moan and tugged on the blonde's shirt, trying to take it off. Steve let go of Tony's neck so that he could take off the shirt and went right back to sucking marks on the tanned flesh.
As you all may know, the next chapter might be the last (still not sure whether or not I will make it two shorter chapters or just one long but we'll see I guess).
“You're very lucky, no broken bones. Just a couple of bruised ribs, a bruised cheek and a sprained wrist. You should be completely healed within a couple of weeks.”
“He is in one of the recovery rooms and he is sleeping. If you'd like, you can come and see him if you promise to be quiet and calm since it could otherwise disturb him and that would slow down the healing process. And doctor Banner, I'd also like to take a look at your hand in there.”
“Oh Tony” he laughed “did you really think that I'd just let you go like that? I knew that you would resist but it's okay. You will be mine again whether you like it or not And who knows? Maybe someday you'll learn to love it?.”
Steve held Tony closer to him and kept whispering in his ears while trying to ignore the knot that kept growing in his stomach.
Steve slowly removed his fingers after making sure that Tony was stretched enough, he wasn't small by any means and he really wanted to avoid hurting his lover.
That did change when Bruce had assured him that he would not be living there for free, he had also been in a similar situation and understood why Tony felt like he felt.
“Why did he do that to me?” He felt the hand on his head stop, there was no need to clarify who he was talking about. Maria sighed sadly before resuming her (failed) attempt at taming her sons curls, something she had struggled with since he was a boy.
“No, no, I'm fine. I just have a bad feeling, that's all. Like something is about to happen, something bad.”
“Bruce” the blonde started “I promise you that I won't hurt him like that. I really like him and I just want to make him happy. And if I ever hurt him you have my permission to do whatever you want with me.”
They reached the mansion after fifteen minutes and headed inside. Tony was met by a huge banner hanging over the front door covered in glitter and spelling “WELCOME HOME ANTHONY!!” in different colors.
Seeing his chance Tony surged forward and managed to get a hold of Howard's chin with his teeth. He ignored the cry of pain that emerged from his father and kept biting harder and harder until he felt the familiar taste of blood flooding his mouth. It wasn't until his father grabbed his injured arm that the young genius let go with a shout. He opened his eyes to see a furious Howard panting with a now bleeding chin and a piece of it hanging off. The older Stark let out a roar before he backhanded Tony which caused him to fall to the ground with a whimper.
Tony tried not to smirk at hearing the noises the Captain made while he swirled his tongue around the head of Steve's cock while sucking on it. He started to move his mouth downwards and kept licking and sucking until his face was pressed against Steve's pubic hair. When he saw that Steve was about to cum he released his length with a wet pop.
Tony learned that Steve had been in the army with Bucky for a few years until there had been an explosion which had cost Bucky his arm and they both were honorably discharged.
“Is that so? Well, can't I still get you an apology coffee? Just like friends I promise, please?” The question came with a small, innocent smile. A smile that Tony had never been able to resist.
He then went inside the elevator and pressed the button that would take him to the third floor where their apartment was. He walked out the elevator and dug up his keys and opened the door.
Tony had also taken classes online while being on the run and had graduated at the age of seventeen with flying colors.
“I want this kitchen spotless and you all cleaned up and ready by the door when I come down. You are buying me pancakes.”
Tony startled awake and looked around him with groggy eyes, wondering what all the commotion was about.
It all came to an end when Natasha was hit in the face with an egg and gave the men a glare that put ice in their hearts. Nobody even blinked, they just stared at her and felt the anxiety growing.
“Oh Tony, didn't you think that I was gonna finish what I started? Only this time you won't get away that easily. Oh, I've missed your tight ass…”
Steve snapped out of his thoughts when the yelling and running around of his team became too loud for him to ignore. He sat back down on the couch with his head in his hands, trying to keep the tears that threatened to escape at bay, he couldn't afford to look weak in front of his team right now, not when everyone was freaking out already. He blinked back the tears and took a few deep breaths before looking up. Clint was on the phone yelling at someone, probably Phil or Bucky, Natasha was trying to comfort a distressed Bruce who was sitting on the floor with his arms wrapped around his legs, Thor was pacing back and forward in the room while spitting out curses in Norwegian.
“Hah!” Charles exclaimed “you don't pay me at all.” He pressed a chaste kiss to the Germans lips and waved to the rest on his way back to the bar. Erik smiled after him before his expression turned serious again and he turned his attention back to the desperate mobsters.
“I was perfectly content with him being dead Clint. How did he even survive? I stabbed him in the neck!”
Tony looked up in surprise when he heard the familiar voice. He slowly stood up, never breaking eye contact with the figure in front of him. He blinked twice, as to make sure that his mind wasn't playing any tricks on him and cleared his throat.
He laid back down and curled up in a ball. Exhaustion took over and he unwillingly went to sleep, dreaming of Steve and his warm smile.
Well, it started when I went to the store close to the mansion because I was hungry and figured a twenty minute trip wouldn't hurt anyone so I went alone. And then there was the explosion and it felt like my chest was on fire, it hurt so bad.
“I'm so sorry bambino, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you from any of this, you deserve so much more my baby.” Tears were now streaming down both their faces and Tony sat up to his his mother, needing her comfort now more than ever. Maria in turn clutched her baby as close to her chest as she could without hurting him while steadily mumbling apologies, needing to feel him close to her, needing to know that her
He roared while throwing himself over Steve. The other Avengers acted immediately and tried to rip the doctor off from the leader but to no avail, Bruce was furious.
By the end of his little speech both of the scientists had tears welling up in their eyes. Bruce dragged Tony into a hug and Tony had to contain a gasp. Bruce usually didn't like physical contact and for him to be the one reaching out was something Tony had almost never seen before and he wasn't about to waste the opportunity and hugged him back. They stayed like that for a few seconds before they both pulled away and wiped the unshed tears from their eyes. Bruce chuckled before starting the car up again and started to drive.
“I know that I don't have to and I won't. I promise you I won't do anything that I'm not ready for, not like you'd let me even if I wanted to.”
After opening and closing his mouth a few times in an attempt to respond Tony stood up on shaking legs while wrapping the thin blanket around his battered body as much as he could to spare the woman even more distress. He limped towards the door so that he was face to face to Ana. The red headed woman reached her hands through the small window on the door and gently cupped the younger boys face while the tears she had been fighting finally escaped her eyes and ran down her cheeks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A knock on the front door of the mansion snapped him out of his thoughts and he put down his coffee and headed to answer the door. He walked past the living room where the team sat and watched the new season of Sherlock (because Jesus, they had waited so long for that), not tearing their eyes away from the screen for even a second.
The whole incident kept replaying in his mind and he felt his breath quicken while his hands started to tremble. Realizing that he was about to have a panic attack, Tony closed his eyes and tried to stabilize his breathing like Bruce had taught him when he would get flashbacks of his father's abuse. He clenched his trembling fist and walked shakingly to the supermarket.
“What!? Who did!?” Steve exclaimed, jumping off of the sofa while the rest of the team were rushing into the living room when they had heard his cries. He had asked to be left alone after Tony and Bucky's departure and they had respectfully left him to his thoughts. He had just started to cool off when he received Bucky’s call and now fear had replaced the anger in his body.
He brought up the hand he was holding and pressed a gentle kiss to whatever visible skin he could reach without worrying about hurting his sweetheart any further.
After another couple of minutes Brock moaned loudly while pushing himself as hard as he could into the teen while emptying himself inside of Tony.
“Well” this time it was Bruce who had spoken up “we could begin with trying to figure out where in the mansion he is being kept to make it easier to rescue him.”
“I said. Let. Him. Go.” Steve was borderline growling and he was standing with Bucky and Bruce on either side of him, all three with their guns up. Suddenly, a satisfied smile spread out on his face.
“Now I'm pissed.” Said the blonde and grabbed Tony's shirt while straddling him, effectively pinning him down.
“Ok, I think it's time to get some sleep. It's been a long day and you need to rest. Doctors orders.” Said Bruce while helping him stand up.
The team settled down by the kitchen island while Steve and Tony put the ingredients on the table and started.
“What the hell is that?” Came Steve's surprised voice from the doorway. He and Bucky were staring at the robot with matching surprised expressions on their faces. Eyes wide they tracked the robot's movements and Bruce couldn't stop the proud smile stretching across his face.
Tony was by the door to the weapons room when he heard how the HYDRA goons went crazy on the walkie talkie and tried to pick the lock as quickly as he could with some broken fingers.
He got up and went to the kitchen to get something to eat but discovered that there was no food and remembered Steve mentioning that they needed to go shopping for groceries this morning.
Tony threw his head back and his vision whited out while he came hard, untouched. White, hot strips of semen coated his stomach and he went limp.
Steve could practically feel the guilt rolling off Bruce in waves and sent him a sympathetic smile before returning his eyes to Tony's face.
Instead of an answer, a sob escaped Tony's mouth and he allowed himself to break down in front of the woman who had become a mother to him. He clutched her hand like a lifeline while he let out all the pain he felt after days of torture.
“Where the hell do you think you have been, you worthless piece of shit!? Huh!? Who do you think you are!? To run away from me! You are my property, you bastard! You are nothing but my punching bag! And who was that blonde lug you were all over!? And the rest of those parasites with him!? You're probably whoring yourself out to all of them! Are you that desperate!? You must be real cheap for them to be using somethings as fat and ugly as you! When we get back home you are gonna get a punishment unlike anything you have ever seen before, you worthless whore!”
“The one that raped and tortured me?” Tony felt Pepper tense up at that and she pulled him at bit closer to her.
“What!? No! We can't move here! What about my job!? And DUM-E and all my research!? I can't just leave it all behind just because some asshole decided to rough me up a little.” Tony was almost shouting by now.
