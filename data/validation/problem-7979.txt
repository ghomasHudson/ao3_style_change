“Rhodey? Really?” asked Steve. “I though Pepper would have been the one to insist on a traditional wedding.”
Tony looked up at Steve through the tears and a nose full of snot. “Really? He doesn’t look like me. I don’t have a beard.”
A sigh of relief drained some of the tension out of Steve’s shoulders. But only some. “What does it do?” he asked, squinting as Schmidt shipped a hand into the weapon.
Steve bit down on his lip, but he couldn’t stop a delighted squeak from leaking out. “You made weights so you could be like me?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Cap is a lying liar.”
“Sorry dearest, a promise is a promise.”
Tony listened again, waiting for the inevitable sign that a particular person was to blame for the call. Form a darkened street he heard a soft crack followed by a grunt and a thump of something heavy falling. Hawkeye.
A dark pain began to grow in Steve's heart. It wasn't right. Tony shouldn't be by himself commemorating this event all alone. He should have company. Friends, family, anyone who gave a damn about Tony should be reveling in this opportunity. But Tony had no one. No a single person was around to congratulate Tony on his accomplishments.
“You put this in your body?” His fingers gravitating to the hypnotic glow like a moth to a flame.
“It’s a little small, but it'll do for now,” he said, taking in the place. Draping his jacket on the back of one of the many chairs in the room, Tony proceeded to make himself comfortable in his new workshop. "Need to move some of the toolboxes around for one. And I need my gramophone. My records too. Pepper will be the one handling the move. And anything else that I’d rather not deal with. Speaking of which, where is she?”
Bucky whimpered. He pawed at the ground, pacing back and forth as if begging them to reconsider.
He looked away, already feeling the guilt gnawing away on his insides. It may be a question of semantics, but to Steve, the excuse made him feel like he was no better than those creeps working with Hydra. “I don’t want them Nat. I need them. There’s a difference.” And it broke his heart to confess that weakness aloud.
“Hell yeah I do!” said Tony, almost jumping up from his spot in the sand. He raced over to Steve’s bench as if Steve had fresh baked cookies and a glass of warm milk.
“I promise you, it won’t.”
Tony tried to shrug it off, but he couldn’t hide the smile on his lips. Steve was really good with the kid even if it was a little awkward seeing his younger self worship the very ground Steve walked upon. It was… nice? Seeing Steve accept Tony despite everything. It gave Tony hope for the future. That, for the first time in his life, he might not fuck up a relationship that meant the world to him. That maybe, one day, if he was super good, his dream could come true. The dream that Tony could finally be Steve’s…
Steve leaned against the doorframe, his chest aching.  Tony was slumped over the kitchen table, his head pillowed on his arms, his dark hair falling over his forehead.  His lips were parted, just a fraction of an inch, his breathing slow and relaxed.  There was a clean, empty coffee cup resting just next to his hand, his lax fingers just brushing against the porcelain.
Steve gave him a wide-eyed, innocent look.  “Man could make a fortune, if he figured out a machine like that,” he said, making his voice as earnest as he could manage.  Behind him, he could hear muffled laughter, and if he made the mistake of looking at Bruce, he would lose it.  “But it’s fine, you can just throw it away when you’re done-”
“Why do you smell like tequila?”
Steve smiled.  “You’re going to wear a snowman hat all night?”
Ellen managed a tight smile.  “Duck-”
It stopped.  Every fragment, every drop.  Froze.  And as he watched, his heart pounding in his ears, the droplets combined, flowing back into each other.  Without the benefit of the cup, the tea curled back into itself, and then, once it had found its form, the cup fragments fell into place around it.  Each shattered flake, back where it had been, a soft, diffused light rolling across the surface, erasing cracks, erasing time, and the cup fell back into his hand.
“I see you’re home,” Tony said, ignoring the way that Steve was laughing, the sound muffled against Tony’s shoulder.  He cleared his throat.  “Welcome home.”
In the kitchen, Steve was standing at the stove, wearing a battered pair of blue SHIELD sweatpants and a white t-shirt that clung to his shoulders like a second skin.  There was a simple white apron tied around his waist, and his feet were bare against the tile floor.  As Tony watched, his heart in his throat, Steve lifted the lid of a pot, leaning over to take a cautious sniff of the steam that curled above the gleaming copper rim.
Jarvis and May were perched on wicker chairs, a pot of tea on the tiny table between them.  May had put her broad brimmed straw hat on Jarvis halfway through the meal, and to the delight of both DJ and Peter, he'd left it on, the ribbons tied neatly under his chin.  Now, they watched the boys run across the lawn, their bare feet flying across the crisp, green grass as Peter tried to get a kite in the air.  An occasional burst of wind swept over them, hard enough to send the leaves in the tree above them rattling, but not quite enough to keep the kite aloft.
Tony stared at the screen, dismayed.  "Was I DRUNK?"
“It's none of my business,” he said.
“You are not,” she said instantly, and Tony laughed.  “Ten minutes?”
Tony's eyes slid in DJ's direction.  “I'll do the talking, and slip you secret notes when I need you to sabotage my many enemies.”  He arched an eyebrow.  “Do we have a deal?”
Tony waved him off.  “I promise I'll taste test anything he gets his hands on.”  Rogers was trying not to smile.  Tony wasn't sure how he knew that, but he did.  He braced his hands on the workbench.  "So if there's no problem, then-"
Steve rubbed the back of his neck.  “I don't think I'm going to be able to-”
The large solarium, just off the main hall on the first floor, was designed with huge glass panels that could be closed against the weather, or thrown open to catch the cool breezes of summer.  The marble floor gleamed beneath the electric lights, but the rising moon cast cool shadows across the rolling lawn just beyond the glass doors.  It wasn’t hard for Steve to imagine the summer parties that had happened here, the guests spilling from the grand hall and out onto the lawn.
Tony nodded again.  “This was the first time you were taken away.  And it took me a while to find you, to bring you back where you belonged.  It was the first time you were alone.  It was the first time you were...”  He tried to smile.  “You were forgotten.”
Tony didn't look up from his papers, but his mouth curved into smile.  "I am disliking that tone, Miss Potts," he said, scribbling a note in the corner of the blueprint before tossing it aside.  "I find it to be disrespectful."
“I'm concerned about short term survival.”  Tony gave up and reached for his scotch.  “I'll worry about the long run later.”
“Obviously,” Sam repeated.  “And what are you planning on doing with the truck?  Cause there's no fucking way you're finding street parking for it, and it won't fit in Tony's spot in the parking garage.”
Obie, for his part, didn’t even look up from his plate.  “You’re late,” he said, his voice mild.  He trimmed the meat on his plate with care, wielding his knife and fork with surgical precision.  “Quite late.”
“I beg your pardon,” Tony said, bent over his work, and Pym shook his head.
The leader made a grab for his arm, and Steve jerked forward, his heart in his throat.  “Hey!”
Her expression went still.  “Ah.”  She stood up, turning to set the plush on her chair.  “I think you’re lost.”
“Is THAT your-”
“Thank you,” Steve said, his hand still hanging in the air.  It dropped back to his side.  “We’ll…  Tell the rest of the team.”
The seats on Tony’s old private jet had been chosen to be as comfortable as possible, with buttery soft leather, full recline and a massage feature that had been known to calm even the most nervous of fliers.  Despite that, Tony barely paused halfway up the aisle to throw his bag  in the general direction of one of them before plodding the towards the rear of the jet.
It was ridiculous, to cling to Steve's hand like a lovesick teenager, to revel in the way that Steve's wedding ring bit into his palm.  But he did it, he allowed himself to do it, to scramble down the stairs right on Steve's heels, through the warehouse and out the door into the sunshine.  Steve shoved the remains of their meal into the trashcan beside the door, and Tony tugged on his hand.  “I'm not going to escape, so you wanna-”
“Jarvis is sending the address to the GPS, want him to drive as well?” Tony asked, throwing open the back door of the SUV so that Clint could load it up.
Pepper put a gentle hand between DJ's shoulders, guiding him towards the door.  “You don't need help, do you?” she asked him, but he was already shaking his head.  “Wonderful, I could tell you were a very self-sufficient young man.”  She opened the door to the hall and ushered him through.  “There you go, you can meet me downstairs, all right?”
“And which of us is the dancer?” She squeezed his hand, her grip strong and comforting.  “Steady, steady there, you’re trying too hard.”
He stood, and Steve took a step back, giving him room.  Across the room, the string quartet came to smooth end to their current song, letting silence fall as Steve offered Tony his arm.  All around the room, people went quiet, heads turning in their direction.  There was the soft sound of chairs being moved, as teammates and friends turned to watch them.
“If you don't come back, I'm going to come find you and carry you back,” Steve called over his shoulder.
There was no answer.  Tony's head tipped up.  “Jarvis?”
DJ slipped away from Rogers, darting over to catch Jarvis' hand.  Rogers straightened up.  “We don't want to cause trouble, Jarvis, we can just have a sandwich on the patio, if that's all right.”
“She’s a force of nature, buddy.  You’ve got a better chance of stopping the tides than changing her mind, once it’s made up.”  Rhodey gave Clint and Happy a serious side-eye.  “She hasn’t given up on Hogan yet, and she really should.”
“Nobility?” Steve asked, his voice wry.
"I'm good at recognizing disaster coming, but not actually stopping it," Tony agreed, his lips twitching.
Jan made a face.  “Let me know if you need help-” she started, but Natasha was already halfway out of the kitchen, sidestepping around Sam, who was on his way in.
Wordlessly, Jan held the file out to Tony.  He considered it, sensing a trap that he wasn’t sure he could avoid.  “Whoever he is, he’s got quite the file,” he said.  He took it from Jan.  “Shame we won’t get to read it.”
Steve was upright before he was fully awake, his heart in his throat as his brain tried desperately to catch up with his body.  “What the-”
“Right, what excuse do the rest of you have?” he asked.  He looked at Steve.  “I never knew about this country side of you.”
Tony paused, peeking over the back of the couch.  Rhodey was lying face down on the cushions, buried under half a dozen blankets and clutching a throw pillow to his face.  “What?” Tony asked, bracing a hand on the back of the couch.
“We do, Miss Van Dyne,” Pepper responded with a bright smile.  “Thank you for coming, I really was only hoping you might have something in stock that might fit him.”
Tony stood back and watched as the two of them rapidly filled the table with covered platters and bowls, moving with practiced speed and precision.  Once everything was in place, they stepped back, pushing the carts toward the door.  Tony handed them each a folded bill as they moved past him.  “Thank you,” he said, with a nod, and the waiter paused.
Peter gave her a stricken look.  “I ate half a pie.  One, at most, not even a full one.”
“Oh, yes, if there's anything this household is known for, it's restraint,” Pepper said.
The light died in an instant, and Harris slammed back to reality so fast that it nearly knocked him off his feet.  “What the-”
“It certainly is,” Pepper said.  She set her purse next to her on the bar and pulled out her phone.  “What about Steve?”
"No.  I can be absolutely honest and say I have no idea what the hell is coming out of your mouth right now," Sam said, his voice flat.  "I understand the words, but I still have no idea what you're talking about."  He hooked a thumb towards the door.  "So, what?  You're just going to avoid this whole area?"
Tony pointed a finger at Steve.  “You are responsible for keeping the urchins under control.”
“I would get started,” Okoye said.  To Tony, she said, “So, you are back to finish your tattoo?”
Steve smiled at him.  “I’m not risking my life,” he said, and Tony caught the front of his shirt, tugging him in.  The kiss was gentle and soft and like nothing Steve had ever expected to have.  When Tony finally pulled away, he was breathing hard.  Steve stole another kiss from him, his breath whispering over Tony’s lips.  “Stay here.  Where you’re safe.”
DJ shoved the pillow off the side of the bed, just for the satisfaction of hearing the soft ‘flump’ sound it made when it hit the ground.
Tony poured the sauce with hands that shook, his fingers white knuckled on the bottle.  “Plates up,” he said, ignoring the way that the words burned their way out of his throat, all sharp edges and painful pressure.  He struggled against the need to cough.
Steve made a displeased sound, but the tension was bleeding out of him with each breath, his shoulders relaxing, his head falling forward until his forehead was brushing against Tony's.  “We're not shacking up, Stark.”
“It’s not actually collecting that’s important here,” Tony said.  “It’s the satisfaction I’ll get from printing out that invoice and then stapling it directly to his face.”
"No," Tony said, at the same time as Steve said, "Yes."
“A solid counter offer,” Tony said.  He grinned into his coffee cup.  “I'll make the toast.”  His hair was dripping into his coffee, and he pushed it back with a sigh.  “After I find a towel.”
Sam gave him a slight smile.  “Yes.  Yes, they really, really did.”  He leaned forward.  “You have a book of naked pictures of Tony Stark.  That you drew.  Over.  And over.”  His smile stretched.  “And judging by the look of horror on your face right now, you had no idea you were doing it.”
Tony nodded.  “Yes.”
“Tell me this isn't the first time a bad guy's tried to needle you about your sex life, Cap,” Tony said.  Steve glared in his general direction, and Tony flipped up the faceplate of the helmet, shock taking away whatever tact he might've possessed.  “Oh my God, it is.”
A sudden, loud shout brought both of their heads around.  Tony watched, shocked, as a small, dark haired boy came running up the driveway, two of the hired guards in pursuit.  The boy’s head was turned back towards the guards, but he was sprinting straight towards the house, and Tony’s entire chest seized.
“I didn’t actually marry Darcy.”
"Yes," he said.  It was the truth.  Which seemed odd.  He'd expected panic, or fear, or anger, but...  Tony was there, smiling that tired, lopsided smile of his, and that changed things.  "Actually, yes.  I'm okay."
He winced.  "Ah.  Tis true."  To the young woman who was now clinging to his shirt with a deathgrip, he said,  "My apologies.  I was attempting merely to assist, but it appears that I have overstepped."
“Right,” Steve said.  And again, “Right.”
He was thankfully fully dressed when he walked out of the bathroom, because Steve was sitting up, staring out at the skyline.  Tony smoothed his tie into place.  “Morning,” he said, and Steve twisted around to face him.
“A path to the future,” Tony said.  He smiled.  “Want to come along?”
“Then I am well pleased.”  He shoveled the remains of a stack of plates into a garbage bag.  “Ah.” He bent over, coming up with a single unbroken plate.  He held it out to Carol.  “If you would?”  She flung it, frisbee style, into the nearest wall.  Thor nodded.  “As it should be.”
She nodded.  “You got it, boss.”  She headed off, and Tony turned to face the interloper.
DJ leaned against his legs, his head tipping up to stare at Tony.  “Like you.”
Steve looked down at his sketchpad, at the scribbles and lines that had somehow become Tony's face, the line of Tony's jaw and the slope of Tony's brow, the curve of Tony's lips and the arch of Tony's throat. He reached out, his fingers sliding over the picture. “I think I do.” He looked up. “It means, it's time to get things done.”
DJ's head popped up on the other side of the desk, and Tony's breath left him in something like a sob.  “It's okay,” he said, “it's okay, I'm sorry, it's going to be fine, don't be afraid.  It's going to be fine, I promise, just-”
“Betrayal.  All around me,” Tony managed, as Steve brought their linked hands up, brushing a kiss across Tony's knuckles.  “This is...”  He struggled to swallow.  “Rank betrayal.”
“You don't have to-” Rogers started, but Pepper was already gone, at something just under a run.  “Miss Potts!”
“I did put it on your calendar,” Jan pointed out.
Steve looked up in time to see Tony come through the door from the house, DJ’s hand slipping away from his as they entered the solarium.  DJ darted over to Pepper, who crouched down to catch his hands in hers and spin him in a circle. Tony wandered in behind DJ, a slight smile on his face.  He was stripped down to his shirt and vest, his hair rumpled, and a streak of grease just above his jaw on one cheek.  “Watch it, Romeo,” he called.  “She’s taken.”
"Am I supposed to have one?"
Steve nodded.  “Look, Sam-”
Stane pitched to the side, his body falling bonelessly to the floor.
Nothing about this was right.  And he was going to figure out why.
Steve heaved a sigh.  “You're not giving up on this, are you?” he asked, and he sounded tired.
“Judging by your Netflix queue, mostly bad 90's romantic comedies,” Jesse said.  “How many Bridget Jones movies did they even make?”
Tony went back to looking at the creature.  It stopped, and started rolling sideways, the movement at a 90 degree angle to the way that it was previously heading.  Tony looked back at Peter.  Peter gave him a brave smile.  "Ninety percent certain that it's a cat."
Tony walked across the room, and, without a word, threw himself onto the bed. Steve frowned, reaching out to stroke a hand over Tony's hair.  “Tony?” he asked, cautious now.  “What's-”
“Abso-fucking-lutely,” Clint said, peeling the ‘The One And Only’ name tag off of Tony’s jacket and replacing it with one that said ‘Tweedle Dee.’  “Now that that’s been taken care of?”  He looked around.  “Everyone get in the fucking car.”
“A button down shirt and a nice pair of pants, and an insanely tacky snowman hat,” Sam said.
“Oh.”  Strange pulled a chair away from the table and slumped down into it, pinching the bridge of his nose.  “My house did no such thing.  The-”  His face wrinkled up in disgust.  “The vermin that is currently infesting my walls tried to eat you.  My house did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It expelled you before that could happen.”
“I'm going, I'm going!” Steve said, laughing.  But she never let up, nudging him mercilessly in the direction of the gym.  Only when they reached the door did she dart around him, throwing the door open with a theatrical gesture.
“Telling you that it’s time to earn your damn keep.  You might be able to fool-”
Steve’s face relaxed.  “I think you need to lie down,” he said, and before Tony could object, he slipped an arm under Tony’s legs, lifting him up.  “It’s okay.  It’s going to be all right.”
“Yeah, 'course not,” Bucky said.  He leaned his chin on one fisted hand.  “You're just upset that someone's getting something from Steve that you're not.”  He blew a strand of hair out of his face and smirked at Tony.  “Huh.  Not sure what you'd call that.”
“Oh, pop culture mockery and pre-apocalyptic partying, that’s good, I can work with that,” Drew said, folding his hands together and cracking his fingers.  “Let’s do this thing.”
Tony’s eyes flicked in his direction, a soft smile on his lips.  “Kids driving you crazy, Cap?”
“Not that much.”  Tony cupped his chin in one hand, his thumb sweeping across the plane of Steve’s cheek.  “You okay?”
DJ shook his head.  “Designed a few.  But no.” His foot bounced against the side of his backpack, kept within easy reach.  “Have the armor.”
Tony managed a smile.  “Jarvis?  You might be an idiot.”
“We have to tell Mr. Hammer we love him every day,” Billy said.  “We’re good at kissing-” Steve made a grab for him, and laughing, the boy darted out of reach.  “I love you, Officer Rogers!”
“Eat your breakfast,” May said, taking the book away from them and closing it with a snap.  She brushed a kiss across Peter’s head.  “You’ll be fine.”
“So you’ve said.  Several times since you walked in,” Harris said.  He offered the Goldfish to Tony, who considered them with narrowed eyes.  Harris jiggled the bag.  “Jesus, you rich twit, just eat the damn crackers.”
“True.”  Jan held it out to Bruce, who gave his head a hard, sharp shake.
Tony choked on a mouthful of wine, and Rogers gave him a quick look, as if realizing too late that he'd gone too far.  Tony grinned at him.  “Ignore him, discussion ruins his digestion,” he said, setting his glass down.
The panic receded, just enough for him to draw a full breath.  He stared at her as she refilled the cup, her grip not quite steady.  But she met his eyes without flinching.  “I promise,” she said, her voice gentle.  “Everyone is fine.  DJ is safe.”  Her hand curled around the back of his neck, her fingers slipping through his hair to cradle his head in her palm.  “Drink.”
“I do,” Tony said.  “I miss her.  And my father.”  It was an afterthought, but it wasn’t a lie.  They’d both left a void in his life, in different ways.  “Do you miss your parents?”
“Long night, am I right?” Tony asked, and the man smiled at him.
Jan turned her attention back to Steve's chest.  "Justin.  Jimi.” She stabbed at the fabric, and Steve took an involuntary breath.  “Get his measurements."
Tony struggled against a smile.  “You should see the bathroom.”
"I hate to repeat myself, but again, Clint-" Tony started, and she picked up a magazine from the bench, rolled it up, and swatted him in the head with it.  Tony twitched to the side, clutching his head as if he'd been mortally wounded.  He stared at her, his mouth hanging open  "What-  What was that?"
“Is it your mom's blend?” Jesse asked.  She reached up, pulling a photo down.
“Monique would like to know if the delivery this morning was acceptable, Mr. Stark?”
Steve moved so fast that he barely had time to register it.  One second, he was halfway across the roof, moving towards Tony with a measured, deliberate pace, and then Tony blinked.  And just like that, Steve was right there, right in front of him, right on top of him, and he jerked backwards, his feet getting tangled up as his brain sent out a desperate, futile order to retreat.
Jan grabbed the front of his shirt, dragging him in until their noses were almost touching.  “Marry me,” she gritted out at the exact moment the door to the workshop opened.
“Where's the girl?”
Steve looked from one invoice to another.  “It’s…  I don’t see that on any of these,” he admitted, reaching for another from the stack.  “Or maybe Praline Patisserie.”  He looked up at them.  “Is it good?”
Looking at him hurt in a way that Steve didn't really want to think about, and he scraped a hand over his face.  “Jarvis?”
He picked up a few books, a sketchpad, and a stack of mismatched socks, shifting them over to the chair so there was room for him to sit down next to DJ.  He took a breath, and let it out, slow and careful.  He shifted, his legs stretched out in front of him.  "I need to talk about this, Deej.  I know that's probably hard for you.  It's okay if you don't talk back." He looked at DJ, meeting DJ's eyes without flinching.  "Is that okay?"
Harris groaned. “Oh come on, half the people on the platform pulled her back up.”
“And if I did choose to put him to bed, moving quickly was of the utmost importance,” Jarvis said, his voice echoing out of the closet.  He re-emerged, a quilt draped over his arm.  “As he had an unfortunate habit of kicking like a mule in his sleep.”  He paused, his eyes meeting Steve’s.  “Something to keep in mind.”
Tony sighed.  “I didn’t duck quite fast enough,” he said, because all of that was entirely true.  And entirely unrelated to the tattoo on his shoulder, but that was a conversation he was going to put off for as long as humanly possible.  “I’m fine.”
“I get to stop hearing questions that I don’t want to acknowledge, let alone answer, and you get to have a new, fresh child to spoil within an inch of his life.”  Tony gave a firm nod.  “The other one was getting large and awkward, he’s no longer cute, it’s, it’s not a thing anymore when he shoves half his face into a blueberry pie, remember when that was cute and not just a cause for concern?”
Tony grinned.  "Somehow, I knew that was just your size," he said, triumphant.  "What do you think?"
Tony made a swift retreat into the bathroom, closing it behind him with hands that shook.  “Oh, fuck,” he said, leaning against the door.
“Mine stayed on the rack,” Tony said, watching as DJ and Rogers loaded up the trunk.  He shook his head. “I rented a car.  And it looks like I’m going to have to rent another.” He tossed the back door of the car open with a theatrical gesture.  “Keep mouthing off, Mini-Me, and it’s going to be a minivan, and you’re going in the trunk.”
“Excuse me, I am a mature and intelligent woman, he's a five year old,” Jan said.  She aimed a tiny fist at his shoulder. “Jerk.”
Inside, there was a workman standing on top of the billiard table, his back to the door, his head tilted up to study the damaged light fixture above him.=.  A heavy drop cloth had been tossed over the tabletop, but Steve still flinched as the man moved, his worn boots bunching the cloth with each step.  His pants were stained with grease, a long sleeved shirt tied around his narrow waist.  His white undershirt clung to the lines of his back, the sleek muscles of his shoulders and arms on full display.  As Steve watched, caught off guard, the workman propped one gloved hand on his hip, his other pushing his dark hair back.
Steve's face went blank, his eyes blinking in surprise.  But before Tony could take it back, he grinned.  “Yeah.  That sounds great, actually.”  He rolled to his feet.  “You want to order, or-”
“I walked through the front door just in time for Sal to fling a pizza into the guy’s face,” Harris protested.  “All I did was pick up the gun when the robber dropped it.”
“It won't,” Tony said.  “But it's nice of you to try.”  In the background of the call, Steve heard a knock on Tony's office door.  “Stay out of the casinos, okay?  I've got prep work to do.”
“Too slow,” Clint said, sinking his teeth into a drumstick.  He held the platter out of reach, ignoring the curses that Happy rained down on him.  Steve watched, amused, as Clint braced a foot in the middle of Happy's chest, trying to hold him at bay.
“Only because it was between you and the gun,” Bruce said.  “I’d say that Jan could probably patch the hole, but…”
“Target identified.”
Steve leaned forward, bracing his hands on the tabletop.  “I’d call it a secret lair, right out of the funny books, Mr. Stark.”
Tony grinned.  “Porn it up, Rogers.”
Slamming the cup down, he grabbed a folio at random from the blotter, flipping it open.  “At this point, college is going to be a bargain.”
For a long moment, Tony was still, his head down, his body taunt as a bowstring.  “I wasn’t aware any of you have ever met a collar you couldn’t slip out of,” he said at last.  He shook his head, starting up the stairs again.  “And no one here seems to have any interest in listening to me anyway.”
“I do my utmost, sir,” Jarvis said, already striding away.  Tony made a face at his back.  “Very mature, sir.”
Jarvis’ lips twitched.  “Sir.”
"Yeah, that's why you were lying on my kitchen floor a few minutes ago," Steve said.  He caught Tony's face between his palms, and leaned over to press a kiss to his forehead.
“Cucumber, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Have you finished the engine reviews?  Mr. Stane will be here to collect them at-”
“He was selling me on your good points,” Sam said.  His shoulders rose and fell in a shrug.  “Which.  I know your good points.  But he seemed determined to highlight some of your more-” He held up his hands, index fingers and thumbs forming a box that he used to frame Steve’s face.  “Winning traits.”  He closed one eye and leaned back, as if setting up a camera angle.  “He’s pretty convincing, I’m seeing you in a whole new light.”
"The cat spent the night with our young guest, and he seems quite healthy," Jarvis said, striding out of the closet, a neatly pressed suit draped over his arms.  He spread it over the end of the bed, his hands careful.  "What do you think?" Jarvis asked DJ.  DJ clambered up to his knees, considering the suit.  He looked up and gave Jarvis a firm nod.  Jarvis's face relaxed into a slight, gentle smile.  "I agree.  It is one of my favorites."
Tony leaned in.  “Are you…  Are you crying, Parker?”
“I think he's done for the night,” Rogers said.  “It's well past his bedrime, and-”
Nakia gave T’Challa a speaking look, one hand resting gently on Shuri’s head.  “I shall consider your offer, your highness,” she said.
Pepper covered her mouth with one hand, trying to hide her smile.  "It does seem to be asking a great deal of him," she said.
Steve took his hand, and let Sam haul him to his feet.  “'Woo the fuck out of that man?'” he asked, his lips twitching.
“Okay, okay,” Steve said, taking hold of Sam’s wrists.  He was grinning, somehow. “It may not change anything, Sam.”
“I own a company.”  She slid a pin out from between her teeth like she was unsheathing a sword.  “You do realize that, right?”  She gestured at the gym floor, where dozens of fashionable people were hard at work.  “I have so many people, and you-” She stabbed the pin in Luke's direction. “Don't have appropriate formal wear.”
“If you bring Washington down on us right now, I will show you the true meaning of terror,” Pepper said, her voice dire.
Almost against his will, Steve smiled.  “I’m sure it’s not.”  He stood, and it hurt, everything hurt, and he wanted to crawl into the bed and pull the covers over his head.  He wanted to crawl into Tony’s bed and pretend that he didn’t care.  Pretend that he could collect a salary during the day and reap far different benefits at night.  He shook off the thought.  “I don’t want a job.  I want a home.”
Steve said good-bye, his eyes locked on Tony’s back.  Once Jarvis disconnected the call, he took a deep breath.  “You could’ve been more help there,” he said, his voice mild.
“He’s fine.”
“Done.” Fury pulled a chair away from the table and sank down into it with a sigh.  He looked up, meeting DJ’s gaze headon, a faint smile on his face.  “Seriously.  You okay?”
“Wait, you have stupid kitchen tricks?” Steve asked.
“Nice,” Moondragon said, and Carol held up the grease stained bag of pastry, one eyebrow arched in a question.  Moondragon held out a hand.  “I can’t say no to a beautiful woman,” she said with a winning smile.  “Especially not when chocolate croissants are involved.”
"Tiny, tiny bit," Steve admitted.
“Apparently you are.”  Iron Man spread his hands wide.  “Don’t know what you expect.  Just imagine-” He gestured at the faceplate of his helmet.  “You’ve seen my pissed off face often enough, should be burned into your memory by now.  Use your imagination, Cap, and just assume that I’m really goddamn angry at you, and fill in the blanks.  You’re a smart man, most of the time, you know, when you’re not doing something monumentally fucking stupid, you’re pretty smart, so maybe you can-”
“That didn’t work the last two times you tried to use it as an excuse, and it’s certainly not going to work now, so can we-”
“What about you, Captain Rogers?” one of the paparazzi yelled.  “You got a date?  I got a nice sister, I'm sure she'd love to meet you!”
Or maybe, if he was being honest with himself, too stupid.
Tony straightened up, climbing to his feet as if it took effort.  “Because the last time I wanted to say things like that, I was dying,” he said, his lips twitching.  One hand came up, fingers brushing against the front of his shirt, over the muted, steady glow of the arc reactor.  “You say stupid things when-”
Morrison frowned. "What does that have to do with anything?"
“Tony!”
Steve stared at the skyline.  “He's not.  He's going home.”
Steve leaned against the wall, his head back, his eyes burning.  He took a deep breath, and another, trying to get himself back under control.
“At the limited speeds that the quinjet is currently capable of reaching, this is an accurate estimate,” Jarvis said.  The phone buzzed again, and he added a pointed, “Ms. Potts is unlikely to give up, sir.”
Tony shifted, his hand flexing under Steve’s.  Before Steve could pull away, Tony’s fingers tangled with his.  In the low light, Steve saw his smile stretch, warm and sweet.  “Too early,” he mumbled, his voice rough.  “Go back to sleep, Steve.”
“I second this,” Natasha said from the door.
“If you decaffinate me, my heart will stop,” Tony said.
“Yeah, but where?”  The voice floated through the darkness, and Steve’s head snapped up.  What felt like several minutes ticked by, and then the shadows below the eaves shifted.  Clint leaned out, one hand braced on the stone next to him.  “I took first watch.”
There was a beat of silence.  "Ellen Ning," Marcy said.
“I suspect you’re right.”  Mrs. Parker gave him a look.  “So word below stairs is that you’ve been asking how the staff came to be here,” she said, holding her hand out for an apple.
"Yes, I know, I also don't care, give me your hand," Tony said, snagging Steve's left wrist.
“For the retention of my security staff, I’d prefer you didn’t.” Tony gave her a little wave.  “Thanks.  For.  This absolutely horrible conversation.”
Jan stalked out onto the balcony.  "I am going to throw this party," she said, placing a finger directly in the center of Tony's chest, right over the arc reactor.  "And you-" She gave him the tiniest little shove.  "Are going to show up." Another poke.  "In your nicest tux." Poke.  "And with your best party attitude."  Poke.  "And dance-" Poke. "Schmooze." Poke.  "And be the life of the damn party, Stark." Poke, poke, poke.
Steve frowned down at the folder.  "The business tycoon?  The millionaire?"
He let her dab at his bleeding knuckles.  “I dunno.  You lie. You lie a LOT.”
Rogers’ eyes darted to Stark, who shrugged, a wry smile twisting his mouth.  “Guess we’re both grounded,” he said.  He looked at Tony.  “You got one?  Cause if you do, it’s time to give it to the bellhop.”
“I ducked,” Stephen said, almost apologetic about that.
Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket, pulling up the file he’d been working on with a flick of his finger.  “Are you good at your job, Monique?”
“That’s true,” Steve said.
“I’d take over,” Pepper said, coaxing Steve out of their way, her hands clasped in his, “but I have my own problems.”
It was a disaster, it was chaos, it was something he had no idea he'd be able to survive until he did it.
Tony groaned.  “Listen, I don't think-”  He stopped, the words clicking in his brain a little too late.  “How do you know where I am?”
The staffer’s smile died.  “What?”
“Did you ask him if he could dance, I don't know, Midgardian dances?” Jess asked.
“Don’t do that,” Phil agreed.  “And if someone else is doing that?”
Stane’s teeth flashed.  “And kill him.  I know where your little pet cop has gone.  If there’s any justice to the world, Hammer’ll take care of him, too.”
She took a step back, her head tipped up in Steve's direction.  "I'm sorry, darling," she said, and Steve felt his face heat.  She rested a hand on his chest.  "Am I making you uncomfortable?"
“Yeah, again, good instinct there, but-”
Greer’s eyebrows drew up in a faint frown.  “Yes?” she asked, and it was strange when things that should be questions weren’t and things that were questions shouldn’t have been.  “I don’t want you to…  Tell me anything you shouldn’t, I know that’s not right, but I thought-”
“There's no room,” Steve said, and that was the stupidest thing he could've said, because Tony promptly twisted around, wriggling his way to the other side of the bed.  The blankets went with him, and he clung to Steve's shirt, his hand stretched out to hold tight to the hem.
He smiled.  “You start trying to pick out his clothes, and I'll make sure to pull you aside, okay?”
“Rude,” she said with a grin, taking the coffee from him.  She reached for the sugar, fluttering eyelashes in Harris’ direction.  “Look at you.  That suit is something else.”
Jan wrapped her arms around one of his elbows, leaning into his shoulder.  “I'm rooting for you.  Now.”  Her head tilted up, her eyelashes fluttering.  “Let me see your ring.”
Jessica was leaning against the wall next to the door, her arms crossed over her chest.  She was watching the goings on with a smile that was faint, but very real.  “Is this 'Achy Breaky Heart?'” Tony asked her.
“Right, I’m getting a slight disconnect between the words you’re saying and the way you’re saying them, so-” Harris started as the creature hopped down to the table, picking its way through the abandoned plates with a cat’s usual disdain for obstacles.  DJ watched, fascinated, as its body undulated through a series of curves, tail swirling around the stem of a champagne glass and paws flicking over the handles of discarded cutlery.
Steve’s inhuman cry tore at Tony’s ears as the unibeam forced the blond bulk up and away from the suit. Steve’s ragdoll like corpse fell back into a pile of wooden boxes, and slumped down into an unconscious mess as the light in Iron Man’s chest dimmed.
Steve’s ears immediately turned bright red. He squirmed in his seat and his eyes shot around the room looking at anything but Tony. “You just got your memories back. I’m not sure if I should say-”
Damn his stubbornness. “Steve!”
“Oh no, he didn’t,” whispered Bucky.
Tony nodded. “Is it weird to say that I’m a little jealous of him?”
“Not one for company? That’s fine,” Tony said, knowing when to pick his battles. This werewolf isn’t the first picky eater he’s had and it certainly won’t be the last. “Just promise me you’ll try a little bit before it gets cold. Or, well, colder than it already is.”
Steve skulked off the in the other direction. After showing them the weapons, Natasha had conveniently disappeared. But she couldn’t have gotten far, right?
And how can Tony say no to that?
“Steve? Steve. What are you doing, Steve?”
“Get down!” he yelled, seconds before a bullet buried itself in his arm. He fell down from the impact, clutching in arm in pain as flower of blood began to bloom through his shirt and jacket. A desperate warning cry of “Tony!” was lost amidst his own screams of pain. He had been shot before, but experience never blunts the surprise and shock at the initial injury.
Steve shrugged. “Sure. Tony would argue that the ones in California are sweeter, but Natasha, don’t force him to…”
“I’ll take care of that,” assured Steve. “Just get those two punks out before they mess up somebody’s face.”
Bruce eyed him warily. “No, it’s just unusual.”
Rumlow took his eyes off Tony and looked beyond Tony’s shoulder.
The kid peeked out from his hiding place allowing Tony to finally get a good look at the kid. The eyes were a recognizable shade of brown. They were filled with anxiety, but there a glint of curiosity that was all too familiar. The kid’s mouth was familiar. A bit too wide for his face, but that was to be expected. Tony always thoughts his lips were too big in his baby pictures. Add a wig and some rouge and he’d look like a petulant little girl. At least, that’s what Tony thought every time he and Steve looked through Tony’s family album.
Clint groaned. “Fine.” He threw his hands up into the air and walked out of the kitchen. “Way to ruin our fun Captain kill joy.”
Steve loosened his shoulders, trying to make as light of the situation as he could. “Just don’t knock me for saying the Brooklyn Dodgers are leagues better than the New York Yankees,” he said with a carefree grin.
Deal goes down and shit starts to hit the fan.
“You know I can’t eat raw meat, right? I’m going to have to cook it or at least cook some of it.”
“Favor for a friend?” asked Bruce.
“Then I’ll deal with it when we get to it," said a stubborn Tony. From here on out, he needed to be strong. No distractions. No running away. No dip worthy men sending him off course. This was his reality now. All that was theory was becoming fact. Whatever needed to be done to reach his goal, whatever responsibility he had to take on, whatever blood had to be spilt on him or spilt by his hand, Tony needed to be ready for that.
Bruce let out a heavy sigh. “Unfortunately, no. I’d like our Tony here to check the figures, but from what I can tell, AIM just threw a bunch of equations against a blackboard, said it was good enough to manipulate time, patched together a machine with computer parts from the eighties, and successfully pulled this kid out of Tony’s time stream. I don’t think we could replicate the experiment even if we tried.
Tony faced pinched in shock. "What? No!” disbelief was clear on his face. “I'm just getting really busy with the orders from work. Lot of people are count on me and I don't have as much time to socialize as I would like to."
Bucky was not happy with that answer. “Then what the hell are we doing here of all places?”
“I am not!”
“So,” said Tony, finally slipping on his suspenders like a civilized person. “What are you doing in my part of town? I’m guessing you didn’t come to bask in my glory since I never told you.”
As he tried to think of a positive way to explain how much he didn’t care for the establishment (too rich for his blood) a knock came from outside the phone booth. “Sorry. I gotta go now. Racking up a line for the phone,” he mumbled to the receiver.
Tony was not prepared for the sudden compliment. “Um… thanks?”
The resulting clatter of the metal falling was ear shattering. The bits of the wall crumbling on top of it all was cringe worthy. Tony’s breath was short and sporadic.  His eyes were wide and wild from the rant. He tried to calm himself by leaning on a metal table, but the tremors from his body made the table shudder under his weight. Tony tried to breathe. He tried to take deep calming breath like Bruce had taught him, but it was useless. His lungs felt small and tight. The unnatural weight in his chest felt like it was pushing in all the wrong places. He needed to calm down. He needed air. Why wouldn’t his body accept the air?
Tony glared at Rhodey. “I will literally rip your legs off if you do that.”
They loaded up as best they could without Nat’s help (that dame could hide a tank in her trousers if she really wanted to). Working as quick as possible, the boys shovelled bullets into magazines, loaded up about half a dozen guns, and stuffed their jackets, pockets, waistbands, and suspenders with as much loot as they could carry. Handguns, grenades, and small knives of various sorts were hard to hide on one’s person without rousing suspicion or dropping trousers, but the guys did their best.
“A lifetime of shit for lying to my face.”
“A little more.”
Boom!
“And I met my ‘someone special’ on my walk? That makes absolutely no sense, Pep. How could someone I’ve only just met become a ‘someone special’?”
Tony looked down at his mug. He rolled it around and let the tea slosh up against the rim of the cup. It was getting cold. “Sorry that I took his place.”
“You know, you should really give it a try. Food isn’t as overrated as you think it is,” Tony said, trading last night’s dinner with a fresh tray of food.
Steve snorted, but quickly covered it up with the back of his hand.
He’d have his work cut out for him when he finally appeared topside. How was he supposed to explain a random Captain America appearing out of nowhere? Would he have to explain it? Iron Man could alert the crew of something floating in the water. But what if they thought he was dead and just left him in the water? How would Iron Man convince them to drag a frozen body on board?
Tony looked over his shoulder as if he was looking for someone. “One drink,” caved Tony.
“Or this case, stretch and bounce back like a rubber band,” said Natasha.
Tony muttered a curse under his breath. “So much for first impressions.”
“See,” said Steve, placing a fork and knife down in front of Tony. “Adults can be wrong about some things. It’s important to remember that and think for yourself.”
Steve ducked down as the noise of ricocheting bullets resumed. There was another one? There was another version of War Machine out there? How many of these things did the Iron Family have?
“Who?” asked Tony.
“Dully noted,” Tony replied before shuffling around some projects with a free hand. He was going to get this figured out even if it killed him.
“Options? What did he mean by options?” asked Steve. Steve didn’t have a good feeling about ‘opinions’ going by the look on Tony’s face and the tone he used.
The kid stuck out his tongue, but did what he was told.
“How the hell am I supposed to know a thing like that?” Tony asked. Steve had called to ask about the Engineer as soon as he could get to the local mom and pop grocery. It was the only place he knew that had a phone.
“No, it screams Iron Family. See the helmet?” he corrected.
Tony sighed. A child with absolutely no tact. Yup, that was probably him. Or maybe that was children in general. Well, there was more than one way to find out. “What can I say kid, mid-forties will do that for you.”
“I’ve seen worse,” he said, as they walked out to a familiar black limo. “You’re engaged?” he asked, holding the door open for Pepper.
“Will you two just shut up for a moment,” hissed Tony. He pulled Natasha into the truck and slammed the door behind her. Jan squeaked as Tony pulled her away from the window and out of sight from curious onlookers.
“What happened to Ms. Summers?”
“Okay, fine! But don’t come crying to me when you get a stomach ache,” Tony groused as he pulled the cheese off his breakfast. Once the patty was free, he carefully slipped the morsel of meat through the bars and before Tony could even blink, the wolf snatched the sausage out of his fingers and gobbled it down.
Pepper took the question in stride. “Nothing official yet, but I’m hoping soon.”
“The location,” huffed Buck, casting a brief outline of a warm puff of air. “Something just doesn’t feel right.”
Chapter 4 and 5 need some minor edits, chapters 6-7 are in the major editing process, and chapter 8 is in draft form. Basically, your feedback can influence parts of the story. Just btw.
Steve smiled. “In that case, lead the way. Show me the world’s most delicious donut and I’ll show you mine, Mister Stark.”
“Tony! It was a contract with the British marines!”
When the truck finally stopped, Steve barely noticed the gentle rock of the breaks or the dying whirl as the engine switched off. The doors flew open revealing two gurneys on rickety wheels. With Sam and Thor’s help, War Machine was loaded onto one cot and Bucky was placed on the other.
“They are new,” Natasha confirmed. “And less likely to blow up in our faces when we open them,” Natasha added with a nod of approval.
Tony turned around and his stomach dropped. “Nope,” he squeaked. “But that might be just as bad.”
“In my original design, it was supposed to grab things.”
Sam shook his head. "Keeping my ear to the ground, but nothing so far. Who ever did this wanted to be noticed, but for some reason, they ain't talking."
“Yeah, my walk-in,” Tony murmured, slipping out of his seat to face Steve. Silver claps on the red suspenders clinked against the metal of the chair.
“I am.” Tony winced in pain as the needle pierced his skin. “But these things just happen sometimes. I went out for a walk, just minding my own business, and a guy just happened to jump me.”
“Steve?” He called to the motionless figure.
“Because it would make Mr. Ross really mad.”
Excitement flickered in his chest, but Tony quickly snuffed the feelings out. No use in hoping for something that wasn’t there. Tony turned his attention back to the fryer and began busying himself with last minute kitchen checks. “Everybody’s looking at our truck. We brought food. Free food. Everybody loves free food.”
The kid nodded, but he clearly didn’t buy Steve’s lie. “Were you sleep walking? Do we sleep walk when we get older?”
He hobbled over to the service counter and leaned out the truck window. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He wanted to remember this; a strangely peaceful evening in the middle of a war-torn country.
Tony froze in his tracks, the words slowly registering into his consciousness as they reverberated down the halls. Heads turned in their directions, and sharp whispers began to pass between lips.
“You won’t. Here.” Tony grabbed the rolling pin out of Steve’s hands and pushed the large man out of the way. “You roll like this.” Tony pressed into the pin and pushed the dough out with ease. He rolled the wooden dowel back and forth with long, practiced strokes. In only a few seconds, the dough had gone from a perfect circle to an elongated rectangle.
"Wouldn't have written the paper if I didn't think so," he replied with a smile. Steve suddenly felt very out of place. Jane spoke ‘Tony’ and Tony spoke ‘Jane’. Steve felt a strange need to pull his shoulders back and stand at full height despite Jane being more than a few inches shorter than him.
“I have to wonder though,” Steve closed the hatch with a gentle thump and pulled Tony out of his day dream (or night dream. Or was it just a dream since it was already night time?) Steve rubbed the back of his neck with a large calloused hand. His body was directed at Tony, but his eyes were darting around to everything but him. “Why are you so okay with the fact that I’m…well, we’re-”
“Well, I guess we can’t
“Oh my god he is!”
“Bucky,” Steve warned.
The sound of slow confident steps from the dark of the alley brought him back to his painful reality. He tensed and tried to right himself. Had the person seen it? Was he ousted as gay for good? Tony blindly reached for something to defend himself. His hands clenched a small, well weathered, rock and he held it up toward the oncoming person.
The man yowled in pain. His turned his face to the ground, but Steve wasn’t done with him. He dug his fingers into the man’s scalp, knelt down, and pulled the beading man’s head up to eye level so Steve could look him in those beady black eyes.
“Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful,” Schmidt murmured, practically frothing at the mouth.
Directing his attention back to the fight, Tony noticed that Hawkeye’s smoke was slowly clearing. In the back of his mind, he noted that Schmidt and his crew were piling into a getaway car like a clown trope. But that didn’t concern him at the moment. What concerned him was Steve’s wellbeing.
“So what?” probed Bucky, eying a large standing crate. “We’re just going to open a box and pick out some old tech.”
“By the time we get to the honeymoon suite, I swear, you’re going to hate me so much.”
Panic gripped at Tony’s stomach. His family was by the cloud. He had expertly left a trap and only to left his family to defend themselves in their time of need. Their armor might be able to protect them for a bit, but they wouldn’t be able to see shit through the gas.
She shrugged. “Who said I’m not?”
Bucky was right. Now was not the time to cower in fear. Now was the time to do what was necessary to get them out of there.
“But how?” asked Steve. Why would a beautiful Russian angel bless them with her presence now of all times?
Tony twisted his heel deeper into the sensitive flesh, but man didn’t answer. His squeezed his eyes shit and bit down on his bottom lip until a line of blood dripped down his chin and onto the floor.
Steve’s heart skipped a beat. His cheeks flushed hot with embarrassment. Steve’s entire world lit up in a flash of possibilities and just as quickly went out.
Pepper looked exasperated. “Tony, this might take more than a few weeks."
Steve nodded.
Not wanting to prolong it any further, Tony grabbed an unassuming jacket from the back and walked off toward the park.
“I didn’t put our picture there. Peter Parker did,” he said, pointing the credited name at the bottom of the picture. “I’ll give him credit, he makes it look much nicer than I expected.”
“It’s a very simple concept Rhodey,” Tony turned around once more to face his best friend. “I see him tonight, say goodbye, and move on with our lives. We focus on the mission, kill the sons of bitches that did this to me, and ride off into the sunset like the badasses we are.  Look Rhodey, I’m trying to do what’s good for the family. For once, I’m trying to be the responsible one. Can’t you support me in that? I’ll even throw in a smoking hot babe for you to fly into the sunset with. You okay with blonds?”
“On it boss.”
Tony wiggled down between the sheets, holding his new doll close to his chest. “That’s okay,” he said. “Big me can take as long as he likes. I like living here. It’s different, but much better.”
“Steve?” Sam appeared, limping out from behind one of the brick walls that had survived the attack. Sam's already dark face was marred with dirt tracks, and his dark curly hair was heavily dusted in gray concrete dust. Steve didn't even want to think what he looked like.
But Tony understood. A friend got hurt. Tony would do the same if he was in Steve’s position. Acting overprotective about the littlest thing.  Hell, he did that and more after the attack in Boston.  Tony waved it off. “No, it's okay. Just got an idea for some stuff at work. We're square.”
“That’s what I said, exadurashion,” Tony nodded, confident in his pronunciation.
“Well,” Sam looked a bit sheepish. “I ain't saying my number is coming up.”
“Of course Mr. Stark.”
“Uh…” His brain supplied no answer.
“Why not?” asked Bucky, giving a nonchalant shrug. “Nobody’s here.”
The blanket rustled and suddenly, a large, fuzzy ear popped up and twitched in the cool morning air.
“Espically then,” Tony said. “I don’t care what anybody says. As long as you promise to be the the ViKing of my heart.”
“Mr. Stane”
“Yeah, rather not take that option if we have to,” Tony considered aloud. “What about arms Pep? What are we looking at?”
Vikings were supposed to be strong. They were big, buff creatures with hands strong enough to break boulders, beards thick enough to rival forests, laughter loud enough to rival thunder, and enough salt in their souls that even the ocean would be jealous.
And yet, there was a small voice in the back of Steve’s head chastising him for being a hypocrite. A tiny voice reminding him of the mission and what would happen if he didn’t get Tony’s help. For the sake of the gang. It only made the guilt sink further into his stomach.
"No! No. You're fine. Just caught us at a bad time," Steve said, motioning for Sam to put the gun away. Sam gave him a confused look, but did as he was ordered. "How did you find us?"
Steve smiled. “As you wish.”
“And don’t even get me started on the delivery system,” she continued on, clearly in her own little world. “I’m a front desk secretary and yet somehow I get a form asking for fifty tons of steel and ten crates containing machine gun bullets and fourteen extra-long clips. You would think after I ask around somebody would have some idea of who sent it or where it should go, but nope. Everyone I talk to is completely useless. Most people would think the factory guys would know all the little ins and outs, but strike two there. And now I’m left with an unfulfilled request form hanging from the little space I’m supposed to call a desk, staring back at me like a disappointed kitten.”
Steve blinked in confusion. “What are you talking about Tony? I thought we were…” Steve’s strong, warm fingers reached out and ghosted over Tony’s arm. He jerked away, the heat searing into his body.
“See what?” asked Tony.
Bruce glared at him. “And a twelve percent chance that he’s not,” he said, pulling on the string a little harder than necessary.
Thanks go to
The blond man cleared his throat, looking just as uncomfortable as Tony. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to... Thank you but...I’m not interested in ‘that’ kind of company.”
"Anyone we know?" asked Steve with a worried frown.
“Oh my god. You’re turning back.”
“On one condition,” Steve sharply added.
“That’ll have to do for now,” said Steve, tying the cloth as tight as possible without causing Tony any excessive injury. “We need to get you to a hospital.”
Instead he gave Tony a smile. A easy, but heartfelt smile that said, ‘I’m sorry. I’m here if you need me.’ But he couldn’t say that outloud. That wasn’t right. Instead Steve said, “It’s fine. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.”
The man looked normal enough; two arms, two legs, nothing bending in ways they shouldn’t. The three piece suit screamed new money. Sharp lines and perfectly fitted seams accented his height, size, and power in ways that normal clothes couldn’t. But unlike normal people, the man wore a familiar shaped helmet atop his head.  Steve racked his brain. Where had he seen that shape before?
Tony shook off the gruesome thought and forced himself forward through the sea of people. He had to find Steve. He had to protect Steve, or at least explain that he wasn’t the bad guy. The guys who destroyed his heart were the bad guys. The guys who hurt Steve were the bad guys. Tony was the good guy.
“Admit it, you put up with it because you love your boyfriend more than coffee,” Steve said, laying down on top of Tony’s chest. His hands splayed possessively over Tony’s scars.
Her arms fell to the sides of her body in exasperation. “Tony.”
“Oh come on Pep. You know I’m right.”
A blond woman sat behind a solitary desk acting as a small barrier to a wooden office door neatly labeled ‘T. Stark’. Steve could barely keep up with her pace, but he could tell Ms. Potts was quite angry. “Ms. Summers, out of my chair!”
Jan squealed. “One of the Howling Commandos has a crush on Tony.”
“Ms. Johnson, is this man giving you problems?” A ginger dame equipped with heels that could kill sauntered up behind them.
“Well, I think that’s enough excitement for one day,” Steve said as he put the kid down for bed. Steve had picked one of the guest rooms closest to his quarters. The light gray walls made the room a little impersonal, but having the bags of clothes in the corner and Tony all snug in his bed, holding the Captain America plush in the crook of his arm made it less so. It wasn’t much, but it felt lived in. It felt like this room belonged to him. This was Tony’s.
Tony looked up and his jaw dropped at the same time as Bucky swung himself over the fence and down into the werewolf enclosure.
As Steve called the elevator, Tony tugged on his arm. “Why is big me in your bed? Does he have problems sleeping too?”
But by far, his arm looked the worst. Bucky’s right arm hung at an unnatural angle and was drenched in a sleeve of blood. Ribbons of Steve’s white shirt were loosely wrapped round the appendage in an attempt to stop the bleeding. A failed attempt. The once clean, white shirt had been deeply stained in living blood. But Steve didn’t look like he cared.
nice in the back of Tony’s car? This whole thing felt too good to be true. Any second, Tony expected someone to jump out of the bushes and yell, “Surprise! You’re fired,” or worse, he’d wake up. What was he thinking inviting trouble like that?
Steve desperately wanted to say no. He could find another way. Would find another way, but they were out of time and at the end of their resources. They were at the end of the line. Begrudgingly, Steve gave nodded in approval. “Let’s just get what we need and get out of here.”
The wolf cocked his head to the side almost as if he was thinking. First once side, and then the other. Then, he grabbed the food tray with his teeth and pulled it out of the way of the doggie door. Once the space was clear, he placed the chuck just outside the food slot and sat on his haunches like a domesticated dog waiting for a treat.
Well, it certainly wasn't going to be the only sketch of Tony Steve would draw in the book. He already was making plans for each stick of charcoal. "Yeah," Steve said in a soft voice that was almost too soft for his own ears. "That would be nice"
He tried to play it off cool. This wasn’t his first rodeo. He could control how he acted around others. But what do you said to a metal monster challenging your right to love a man, Italian or not. “I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” Steve said, more flippantly than normal.
Steve’s tongue. Steve’s tongue was in a different league altogether.
“You caused the end of the world!”
Bruce took an unsure breath, considering the possibilities. “I can certainly try. Don’t know if our guest is privy to information like that.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You’re an idiot. You know that, right?”
Steve felt his chest flutter. “I’d like that.”
“War Machine and Rescue, I need you up front and center,” commanded Tony. “Lost my helmet, so I need you two to pick up the slack.”
“Okay. Thanks dad,” Morgan said as she raced off to get changed.
Steve didn’t find it as funny as Tony. “Cut it out,” he said, gently cuffing Tony upside the head. “Don’t go putting crazy thoughts in his head.”
“You’d have liked what they’ve done with the place. Nat and the new guy,” Tony says, taking a swig of whisky right from the bottle. “Made Timely into a right proper town. Where the law is just and not something to be twisted by greedy, fat hands. I just… wish you could see it for yourself.
Making bootleg to help others make ends meet, taking only a small portion to support themselves and run their operation. It wasn't the optimal situation, but the depression was hard on everybody. Steve and his crew were just trying to make the best of a bad economic time.
Steve only sighed. This was no joking matter, and Bucky being an ass wasn't making things any better.
Steve stormed out of the building like a bat out of hell. He refused to look back to see if Tony was following him. He couldn’t look back. If Tony came after him, Steve wouldn’t be able to hold himself together. If Tony came after him, Steve didn’t know if he would give him a right hook or burst into tears.
“I’ll need a place to work eventually," mused Tony as they boarded the elevator to the top floors of SI. "Some place to stretch my legs and keep all hours of the night. Would it bother you too much if I use your office? I remember loving the view as a kid."
Panic set in Tony’s stomach. “Iron Family, move in now!”
“Noooo,” whined Tony. “You should stay here. In bed. With me. Where it’s warm.”
“Hey, the man laid out a plan. I’m not going to argue with a good plan,” Sam said defensively.
Tony sighed. “Figured you wouldn’t be cool with dropping off breakfast in person. Guess we have to use the doggy door.”
“I’ll be sure you get one Mr. Stane,” said Pepper with a courteous smile.
“Tony, I’m not siding with anybody.”
Those few words made the shaking stop. Tony’s face brightened a little at the gesture, and it made Steve’s heart hurt more. Just a few words made all the difference? What the hell? What type of people had he been spending time with? He wanted to do more to help Tony. Could he do more? Didn't matter. He would do more.
A panicked voice called out from the darkness. “Cap!”
“What goes through your head when you draw?”
which was so much fun to do. Second, I'm attempting to change careers, so that's hell in a basket to tackle. Third, and no so much fun, my grandmother passed away in May. I'm still in the process of grieving, so until further notice, I'll be working on
Tony rolled his eyes. He was about two minutes away from having an aneurusm. Either that, or a dead were on his hands. “No, you don’t,” hissed Tony as Barnes shed his clothes. “That’s a feral werewolf. You don’t know what he’s capable of.”
“One of these days Hawkeye, I will get the drop on you." It was an empty threat and both of them knew it.
“Told you he’d go for it,” said the man.
Steve gave Tony a quick nudge in the back and shot him a pointed look that said, ‘Apologize.’
“Goodbye Tony,” Stane said, walking out in an amused huff.
“I see you every day. I get back from work and you’re the first thing I see.”
The pure bright light enveloped his sight, the sheer power behind the blast pinning to the ground. Steve clenched his hands and tried to stay strong. He had to. He had to survive to survive the attack. He had to make sure Tony was alright. He had to-
“Gee, thanks, Tony,” Steve said with a sarcastic smile. “Glad to know I rank lower than coffee.”
“And is that what you brought me back for?" Tony asked with an unnecessary bite. "To be a glorified show pony? A replacement for dad!” Part of him knew what he was saying wasn't true, but it still hurt to have those lies floating around in the back of head.
Steve hummed. He took Tony’s fabric covered head in his mouth. His tongue swirled around Tony’s head. Then, he hollowed out his cheeks and sucked.
He waited on pins and needles, preparing himself for a shit storm. Who could it possibly be at this time of night? Insomniatic inventors looking for a late night muse? Late night sea hands checking for anything out of the ordinary?
Steve rubbed his face as he tried to wipe the unseen smudge off. Tony let out a fustrated sigh.
“I know,” pouted Tony. He rolled on his back to mask the heating in his cheeks. “Not appropriate, but don’t expect me to apologize.”
Steve nuzzled into Bucky neck, his natural sweaty sent wrapped around Steve like a familiar blanket. It reminded him of all those nights’ years ago, when he was a skinny little thing, huddled up against Bucky for warmth against the cold winter nights. God he hated his weakness. “I hate it when you make sense,” Steve mumbled.
“Like he’s waiting for something?” asked Jane.
“For the record, I’m fine too,” Bucky said as Natasha dressed his wounds.
“Mister Stark,” Natasha said with an equally polite curtsy as she closed the gate behind her black lace dress.
Something low, needy, and sinful pulsed below his gut. His mouth watered in anticipation, and Tony decided for one stupid moment that he would take the plunge and do something not responsible. With a low suggestive voice, he took a step closer to Steve. “And, just for the record, when I want something, I usually get what I want.”
Tony smiled. “Thanks, Jan. That means a lot coming from you.” Tony turned his attention to the red headed woman. “Natasha?”
A sobering chill ran down Steve’s body. He bit the inside of his lip and tried to stay calm. Steve’s heart pounded in his chest as understanding washed over him. Bones breaking. Screaming. Tony had one of their attackers in custody and he was putting the scum through the ringer.
He held the man tight in his arms and tried to do everything he could to retain the smallest hint as to who this man was. Steve buried his face in the man’s shoulder and tried to remember the smell of sweat and oil emended in his clothes. He rubbed his cheek along the man’s face and tried to memorize the burn of a precisely trimmed beard along his skin. Steve ran his fingers though the man’s hair, learning how each strand felt between his fingers. He wrapped his arms around the man’s waist, trying to hold the memory for a few seconds longer before it all vanished.
“I trust the animal will take care of itself,” Okoye said, digging into her saddlebags.  “You are the one who refuses to sit still long enough to eat more than a few mouthfuls.”
He reached the elevator and stepped inside.  “Jarvis?  Is Tony up yet?”
Pepper and Rhodey exchanged a glance.  “Probably just the cat,” Rhodey said, a little too quick.  A little too smooth.
“It's...  Small.”
He looked up.  “You gave me a home.  It sounds strange, it sounds stupid, but I was...”  He smiled.  “I was looking for something, and if it wasn't you, Tony, it was everything you brought along with you.”
"Yeah.  But for some reason, they also don't follow Steve Rogers, so make of that what you will."  Jesse was silent for a moment.  "Are you sure we're not being sued?"
Tony sighed.  “Saturday.”
Steve pulled his sneakers on, twisting his feet against the floor, testing them for comfort.  “Jarvis, can I get a weather report?”
“And I knew the moment that Abe dragged this kid into his kitchen that he was going to be nothing but trouble,” Isaiah said, with a firm nod.  He gave the bowl a stir with a silicone pastry brush and started sweeping the glaze over the cinnamon rolls with a quick, heavy hand.  “All piss and vinegar, trying to bite everything that got in reach.”
Tony slipped a little lower in the water, the ends of his tie floating along the surface.  "That's quitter talk, Rogers."  One languid hand fumbled next to the tub, coming up at last with a bottle of mineral water.  "So much quitter talk."  He stared at the camera, his eyes glinting with the sort of intent that twisted Steve's stomach into knots, and tipped the bottle to his lips.
DJ smiled.  “I can leave now,” he said.  His fingers plucked at the edge of the cup’s lid, pushing it up and almost off before shoving it back down.  “If I want to.”  He looked back at the window, the tension in his shoulders relaxing a little.  “But yes.  It’s home.”  He looked back at Fury.  “Or something like it, I guess?”
She nodded. “Tony wasn't.”
“Actually,” he said, shifting his legs, “I was just thinking that this was progress.”  Tony's fingers stilled, and Steve went back to stroking his hair.  “Usually, when you're upset, you tend to-”  He stopped, trying to find a diplomatic way of saying it.  “Find something that needs fixing down in the workshop.”
“Photo ops?” Steve asked.
“Yeah.  This is the best Christmas present ever,” Clint said.  He shook the quilt out, his fingers tracing over the different t-shirts that had been used to make it.  He smiled at DJ.  “How did you-  Did you do this?”
“Over-   Over where?” Tony asked, but without even looking back, Harris knew he was following.
“Yes, that’s…  That’s actually exactly what I’d heard,” she said, but she was smiling, wide and bright and real, and it took the sting out of the words.  “But he talks to you more than anyone else, so…”  Her smile faded, just a little, it was still there, but it seemed strained now.  A little uncertain.  “I don’t want to make things awkward, either, so I thought, maybe, if he has a significant other, or someone he’s seeing, and he’s keeping that private from the rest of the team, which, you know, that’s his right, but if that’s what’s happening, the person he’s most likely to have told is you.”
"The problem," Rogers said, his voice stern, "is that chances are, he's going to spend his entire working life in a small, windowless, poorly ventilated workroom.  And even if that's not the case, he's going back to the city soon enough, so for the short amount of time he has access to, you know, sunlight?" He braced his hands on the other side of the workbench, his pose deliberately mirroring Tony's.  "I think it would be awful nice for him to experience it."
"Is there a point to this?" Tony asked him.
Steve froze.  “A whole lot of men who are a whole lot smarter than me say it is.”
“I will have you know I tip very well,” Stephen said to DJ.
Jan took a deep breath.  “And the other half is mine,” she said.
“You say that now,” Tony said.  He took a deep breath.  “I am not looking forward to sitting in this hotel room until this is over.”
“Someone shot you,” Bruce said.
“No,” Tony said.
“But your premiums,” Pepper said.  She nudged a mangled carving with one foot.  “This will…”
“Right,” he said.
"Not really, because I've still got them," Tony pointed out. He slanted a teasing smile in Steve's direction. "If anything, he's falling down on the job."
Jarvis darted to the side, and before Tony could manage to push himself upright again, something moved to his side.  Something small.  And slight.  And fast.
Tony let out a breath that sounded almost like a laugh.  "Jesus, what a mess."  His head fell back.  "What an absolute mess, Steve, how the fuck did we end up doing this to ourselves?"
One of Steve's shoulders rose in a half shrug. “I'm fine.”
“You gave me a bottle of rum last year,” Benito said.
“I can’t go home,” DJ said, and Tony’s expression went still.  DJ looked at Strange.  “I can’t go home.”
Pepper frowned at him.  “Tony.”
He was so far from shore now that he wasn't sure that he'd ever find it again.
Tony's body swayed against his, and Steve took his weight easily, his free hand coming up to brush Tony's hair away from his forehead.  His skin was hot and dry, and Steve shook his head.  "C'mon, Typhoid Tony.  Time to go home."
“Last week,” Obie said, sipping his whiskey.  “So far, it’s going well, but we’re going to have to talk to our steel supplier, what we’re getting isn’t worth the price we’re paying.”
“Well, he threw the first bar stool, but Tony started it,” Peter said, and Tony gave up.
Logan shrugged.  “You chose your side when you tried to stop it,” he said.  “I'm sure they wouldn't mind making an example of a few of you.”
Harris leaned over the caution tape.  “It’s almost like someone-” He stressed the word.  “Notified him where we were and what we were doing, timed so he’d arrive right when he did.”
“Come in,” Tony called, glad for the interruption.
Steve opened his mouth to say something, but never got that far, his attention suddenly completely caught by his phone. The text was short, simple, and to the point. “That's your only regret?”
Tony considered that.  "Tempting.  But no."  He glanced at the bench, and reached for the toolbox.  "I've got work that I have to-"
Steve shut it behind him and set the lock just for good measure, then turned to glare at the condom that was lying in the middle of the floor.  “Great,” he muttered under his breath.  “That's classy.”  He picked it up with a sigh.  It was cherry flavored, which seemed all sorts of wrong to Steve, but what did he know?
"No, thank you, I'm not-"  He made a grab for his plate as Bobbi slipped it out of his hands.  "I don't need-"
“Well, I’ve been known to tramp it up,” Tony said, risking life and limb to take half a croissant off of Moondragon.
“Why do you think I can?” Tony asked her.
"Stop flexing, Thor," Jane said.  He grinned at her, and she flipped the end of a strip of silk at him.  "Or I'll tell them you should be in puce."
Steve batted his hand away, still grinning.  "Good to know."  He glanced over, his pale hair falling over his forehead.  "Go set the table."
“I suppose I could spare a slice or two,” Steve agreed, covering the loaves with a cloth and setting the dough to rise near the warmth of the oven.  “I've got cherry and raspberry preserves.”
Steve's heart was pounding, so loud in his ears that he was surprised that Sam couldn't hear it.  “No, I-”  He turned the book over between his palms.  “Tony asked me about my favorite book, and I told him-”  He shook his head.  “I told him about one I read, as a kid.  I didn't remember the name, though, I just-”
Tony blinked.  “Why not?”
“I think that’s my line.”  Tony took a seat at the end of the bed, leaning over to pry his shoes off.  When the second one dropped to the ground, he straightened up with a groan.  “You know, this would’ve been awkward if Clint or Darcy had beat me back here.”
“His house tried to eat me,” DJ said, his voice dark, and everyone went still.
“I don’t think that’s a  very good-”
“When they come in, see if you can keep them in the kitchen.  Ring me if you can’t.”  He paused.  “I don’t want my current negotiations to be misconstrued.”
"Yes, they are."  Everyone turned, as one, to look at Steve.  He stood, his hands braced on the table.  "They are involved.  Because we're asking them to lie for us."
The man opened his mouth, but the boy stepped in front of the reception desk.  “Today,” he said.
Tony barely glanced at it.  “I’m fine.”
“Because no one delivers at 10 am.”
“Take me to a hotel,” Tony muttered, and Happy laughed.  Resigned, Tony reached for the door handle.  “Your insolence has been noted, Hogan.”
“It has been exactly one week and one day, sir.  I am responsible for the household schedule and that does require me to be able to read a calendar,” Jarvis said, his voice brisk.
“Understood, and the Maria Stark Foundation thanks you for your kind donation,” she said, reaching for her clipboard and her pen.  It was a ballpoint, but there was quill attached to it.  For flair, Steve supposed.  “Please enjoy yourselves, and let me know if there’s anything you need tonight.”
“I regret so much already, what makes you think I'll even notice one more?” Tony asked.  He scrubbed his head with both hands, letting the suds go everywhere.  There was something satisfying about that.
It smelled...  Good.  Stark smelled good.  It was subtle, almost natural, a tangle of spices and scents that Steve had no words for.  He didn't know what they were, but he knew he liked the way it smelled, liked the way that Stark smelled, and that was a dangerous line of thought.
Steve set his thumb on the edge of the cap and flicked it free, and the soda immediately gushed from the neck, white foam splashing over his knuckles.  Cursing, Steve dropped his mouth to the neck of the bottle, trying to catch as much as he could before it ended up on his sketchbook.  Bubbles went up his nose, and he coughed, soda overflowing his lips.
DJ took a seat at the table, wondering if there was a way to get to his practice books without touching the cake.  Furbro kicked at his breastbone, and DJ lowered the zipper of his hoodie.  Furbro’s head popped up, and he blinked up at DJ.  “Don’t go far,” DJ told him, and Furbro chittered at him and settled down to chew on the teeth of his zipper.
Tony opened his mouth, and nothing came out.  “He’s got a point,” Harris said.
“This is nice,” Tony said, barely noticing when the keys slipped out of his hand and clattered to the front porch.  He sank a hand into Steve’s hair, tugging his head down.  “This is…  Let’s just stay here.”
He picked up his pen, tapping the tip of it against the desktop.  “You got any more of this?”
Steve was blotting at the coffee that had spilled on the sheets, his face tense.  “Leave it, it’s fine,” Tony said, tossing the flower onto the breakfast tray.   Steve gave him a look, and Tony couldn’t quite manage to hide his smile.
Wherever forward ended up being.
Natasha took a step back as Bobbi pulled the door shut, wiggling her fingers in a wave.  “Crush something for me,” she called as Bobbi pulled the car around.  She looked at Steve, and whatever she saw in his face made her smile.  “Do you have questions, officer?”
Okoye was staring at T’Challa, her face expressionless.  He met her eyes, and shrugged.  “She’s very persuasive, and at this point, I am open to any allies I can find.”  He took a seat on the wall, catching the apple Okoye tossed to him with a grin.  “As my own negotiations have found little favor with that party.”
Steve nodded, as if Sam could see that.  ‘Just fine.  Marx Brothers, then?’
Fury waved him off.  “I know.  Trying to keep your friend from ending up in jail or deported.  Commendable.”  His eyebrow arched.  “Stupid.  But commendable.”
“Do you not want wine?” Tony said.  “Because that's a mistake.  I have an excellent wine collection.  Amazing.  World renowned.  I know you Irish sorts stick with a good beer, but still-”
“Well, not her wardrobe,” Clint explained.  “Mine.”
“Quit while you're ahead, Mr. Stark,” Fury said, setting his tablet down and folding his hands in front of him.  “I see you've brought guests.”  He nodded at Rhodey.  “Colonel.”
Steve covered his mouth with a hand.  “Yes, we can make popcorn,” he said to DJ.  Tony mumbled against his fingers, and Steve gave him a look.  “And yes, we are going to eat that popcorn.”  Tony threw his hands in the air, making DJ giggle.
Steve took a deep breath, and then another, the shield falling, half-forgotten to his side.
Tony’s eyes narrowed, suspicion washing over his face.  “Okay?” he repeated.
“Is this just because you haven’t had a proper night out in the last year?” Pepper asked, one eyebrow arched.
“Generally, reconnaissance missions don’t usually involve conversation,” he pointed out.  He headed down the path along the edge of the house, scanning the windows as he passed each one.
"New engine," he said.  The tip of his pencil rattled against the gleaming tabletop, his brows drawn in tight over his eyes.  "Very high powered."
“You’re a natural,” the woman told him with a grin.  “Save your ammunition for the main event.” She looked at Harris, who was blowing the petal away from his eyebrow.  “And for the last time, you’re in Vegas.  I’ve been working for a 24 hour wedding chapel since I was 19.  What makes you think you can surprise me?”
"Ooooh, yeah, I know that guy," Jan said.  She put her hands on her hips. "Mine was a corporate raider with a soon-to-be ex-wife."  She made a face.  “Or so he claimed.  Unsurprisingly, that divorce never went through.”
“Busier than usual, Mr. Stark,” Reggie said.  “Think someone tipped 'em off that you were coming, otherwise they'd all be home in bed by now.”
“That is a lie and you know it, and marrying a childhood friend is not a way to get his attention,” Tony said.  “Go home and drag him away from his laboratory before you try to have a discussion with him, because you know he can’t be trusted if there’s a bunsen burner in reach.”
“The desk in my workshop.”
Tony.
"Yeah.” Sam smiles that little crooked grin of his. “Hey new guy, how would you feel about doing a rum run with me?" he asked with a wink.
“Kid…” Tony growled.
“To be fair, you do and you are in no way mature.”
Eventually, Tony’s patience ran low and time ran out. He recalled the car and tossed the uneaten rabbit on the pile of meat from that morning.
“Morning big me!” Tony said as he dug into the now clean pancakes.
“Just about,” reported Sam as he joined the group. He danced around a bit on the balls of his feet. Nervous energy? Sam was always down for a run or whatever you threw at him, but there was something eating at the guy. Steve was about to ask for an explanation as Sam spilled the beans. “There's just, there’s a guy Steve. Right outside our door.”
The arc reactor wined down to a low squeal, leaving Tony a panting, gasping mess inside the metal armor.
“And then we can prepoise to Steve?” asked Morgan.
“Bucky, honey, this is Tony Stark. Tony, this is my husband, Bucky Barnes. He and Steve grew up together. They’ve known each other since they were puppies.”
Rhodey pointed to the other side of the plane. The seat younger Tony occupied was now empty. “Tony’s gone. He ran off while you two were yelling your heads off.”
Tony swam down, prepared to push long forgotten garbage to the surface. But when it finally came into view, he gasped.
“I'll take you on the run. I'll do all the work, all the heavy lifting, and then I'll take you home. You don't have to participate in any part of this, okay? I'll make sure you do nothing illegal. And if anybody asks any questions, I'll take all the blame.”
Tony let out a silent breath, allowing the weight of the hand and the weight of his decision sink in. Everything from before, and now this on top. The world really was out to crush him. Maybe Steve did him a favor. If he was angry at Tony, maybe he would be too busy to be sad when Tony disappointed the world, collapsed from exhaustion, and never moved again. It would certainly save Steve the tears. Might even save Steve too.
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. He grabbed the cup with greedy hands. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting the heavenly scent fill his nose. Oh, wait. Why didn’t it smell like coffee? “Tea?” asked Tony, looking indignantly into the clear brown water.
“Hey, Steve. How’s it going? I heard you had a shitty date,” Tony slurred, a tray of raw meat balanced precariously against his hip.
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” mocked Bucky as they made their way into the secret back room. Clearly he wasn’t as intimidated by the architectural implications as Steve was. “You’ve been going on about him nonstop for the past two weeks. Hurry up and hook up already.”
Tony turned up the attitude to ten. “I have every right. It’s my name on the building, my name on the weapons, and me who gets blamed when shit happens. Because, guess what, shit happened. I just got a report, from a very reliable source, that one of our grenades brought down a building on someone. And I’m not talking about a metaphorical building here Obie. I’m talking literal, physical bricks, cement, metal pipes, and dead human bodies falling down on someone in the middle of civilian filled Brooklyn. Brooklyn, Obie! I may not be a fan of the place, but I sure as hell don’t want weapons with my name on it going off in civilian filled areas. It’s more than just bad for business. It’s negligent.”
… You know what, screw it. Tony was having a bad day. The werewolf was fed. Tony could take a moment to feed himself. Who was going to tell? The were that couldn’t turn back into a human? Maybe, but that sounded like a problem for later Tony.
Tony snorted in amusement, hiding his face in the palm of Steve’s palm. “What? Don’t think I can take care of myself?” he asked. Tony never really saw himself as the ‘damsel in distress’ type. But, maybe he would be okay with it if Steve was his knight in shining armor.
“So,” said Tony, breaking the silence with the shrug of his shoulder. “This is me.”
He shot a panicked look over to Bruce. Without needing to say a word to explain, Bruce nodded in agreement. “I’ll take care of Rhodey. Go find Steve.”
Tony’s mouth dropped. “You didn’t.” The smug shit eating grin on Steve’s face grew in tandem with Tony’s smile. “You fight dirty Rogers. Saying something like that on your home turf. You know I can’t say anything against you if I don’t want to start a riot.”
“I know you’ve been through a lot. SHIELD gave me your file,” Tony said as he pushed the wolf’s dinner through the doggy door. “Forced to perform in a circus. Put on display for everyone to look at you. I can’t even begin to imagine what that would have been like.”
Steve looked behind him, making sure Tony was with him before he continued, “Where’s Hammer?” he asked as Natasha and Happy slid out of the front seat..
“Jan?”
He started the coffee brewing before opening the minibar.  There were a variety of unfamiliar tins and packages lined up on the shelves, small packets of cheese and crackers, fancy chocolates and local delicacies.  He was actively considering opening the mixed nuts when the coffee pot beeped, the last of the coffee hissing into the pot.
“My apologies, sir,” Jarvis said, and Steve had to bite the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.  “What were you going to ask about?”
She disconnected, and Tony kicked off his shoes. “Jarvis, can you try to get Captain Quixote on the phone for me?” He stripped off his jeans. “Captain Tilts-At-Windmills. Captain Lost Cause. Captain-”
“That’s,uh, that’s my general state of mind, so…”  Bruce rocked back on his stool, rubbing a hand over his eyes.  “Not sure I can help you with that.”
Tony gave him a look over the top of his phone.  “I doubt they make it in your size.”
“Here I am,” Tony agreed, spreading his arms wide.  He gave her a wicked smile.  “Surrounded by temptation.”
“He has a greater chance of accomplishing his goals in that time frame, yes.  Thank you, sir.”
Steve looked up from his newspaper when he heard the front door open.  “Hey, Deej?” he called.  “Done helping Nat with the plants?  Want some breakfast?”
Steve considered the pot.  He poked at the water with his spoon.  Tony watched him, affection curling through him.  “I think we're almost ready to go,” Steve said, with his usual confidence.  Tony wondered how much of that was faked.
“How’re we doing?”
For a long moment, he stared up at the ceiling, fragments of a very hot, very confusing dream clinging to the edges of his consciousness, to his very frustrated brain.  He took a breath, trying to reintroduce some semblance of sanity.  “Okay,” he said, to no one in particular.  “That was fucked up.”  He pressed a hand to his face.  “Where the HELL did that-”
“I don’t know what I expected,” Clint said, “but it sure wasn’t this.”
“Because it was the only door you bothered to lock.” Steve reached for a knight, and paused, his fingers not quite making contact.  “Why did you lock it?”
“Please, I haven’t wrecked a car in at least six months,” Bobbi said.  Her eyes slid sideways, looking at Steve.  “You know why.”
Tony spared the bakery bag a curious look.  It looked like the real thing, good solid bread from a good solid Italian bakery. “Not going to turn that down,” he said, laying out the table.  “Did you grab a bottle of wine?”
“You know, I can never tell if he’s kidding or not,” Harris said.
“I gotta delivery tonight, and-”
Steve's eyes went wide.  "Oh, well, that's less his dating history and more his, you know, sexuality."
Tony nodded, already pulling his wallet out of his pocket.  “Enough?” he held up a few bills of the local currency, and pointed at the masks again.
“Yeah, that's not going to stop,” Tony said against Steve's shoulder.  He raised his head, just far enough to smirk at Bucky.  “His ass is a work of art.  I can't be expected to keep my hands to myself.”
“I...  Didn't?” he said, and Jan narrowed her eyes at him, her little mouth set in a scowl.  Steve blinked, suddenly not at all sure.  Maybe he had been doing that.  “Sorry?”
“No,” Harris repeated.  “Sir.  Please, no.”
“Right,” Tony said.  But his lips were twitching. He glanced at DJ.  “Isn’t that great?  You’re going to see a movie.”
Bobbi wrapped an arm around Bruce’s shoulders.  “C’mon, bossman.  You can take out your stress on the hedges tomorrow.”
There, at the base of the tree, there was a single white stone.
"Right.  That makes sense." As much as any of this could make sense.  Clint rubbed a hand over his eyes, taking a deep breath at the same time.  "Jay?  Why me?"
“Going!” DJ said, stopping long enough to hug Steve.  Laughing, Steve hugged him back, pressing a kiss to the top of DJ’s head.
"Dislocated shoulder, possible concussion, definite bruised tailbone, general bad temper," Bruce rattled off.  His smile seemed lighter now.  Easier.  "She would like everyone to know that she's most definitely not okay, and she is very, very pissed off about it."
Steve sighed.  “I never claimed to be smart,” he said.
“Mr. Jarvis?” May asked.
DJ blinked back at him, his eyes huge and wet.  “Please?”
His dinner went cold on his plate as he stared, unseeing, at the movie.  He wondered if Greer was as aware of Sam and Tony as he was, but she never seemed to even glance in their direction.  She seemed perfectly comfortable curled up against the arm of the sofa, her plate balanced on one knee.
Steve went still.  “Tony…”
“Worry about them,” Morrison said, waving at Steve and Ellen. His smile was condescending. “They're going to need a crash course in how to be on tv.”
“I couldn't eat another bite,” Steve said, holding up a hand.  “Not if I want to be able to fit in my pants when this week is over.”
Tony waited it out, the best way he knew how.
Tony smiled.  “Bold,” he said, and Steve wondered if that was a compliment or not.  Tony reached out, moving a pawn with a quick flick of his fingers.  “Does he have a hard time sleeping?” he asked.
Sam grinned.  “You might not notice, what with the whole 'throwing yourself off of tall objects' thing,” he said, settling down in a loose crouch in front of Steve, “but I'm usually cursing at you when I catch you.”
“Of course not, Tony,” she said, and with a wink in Steve’s direction, she left the workshop.
“It's the unfastened tie,” Steve said. He made another attempt at the damn thing, but his fingers were not obeying him. He gave up, frustrated. He had no desire to go back to the makeup and wardrobe department, but that was starting to look like his only choice. “Can you tie this?” he asked Ellen.
“He’s with Clint and Darcy, they’re looking for-”
Sam reached for it. “Yeah, but I'm sick of talking to you and if I leave, people are going to judge me, so I think it's story time.”
“Because we’re both waiting for the other person to break first,”  Clint said. Steve stared at him.  Clint shrugged.  “If I admit it first, he wins.”
“You should,” Bruce told him with a smile.  “Clint!’
“I mean, I've always thought so.”  Tony braced his hands on the edge of the bed, leaning forward just a bit.  “Still.” He smiled at Steve.  “Thanks.  For putting me to bed.”
"Okay?" Clint asked.  "Can I read the title crawl?"
“That’s probably a mistake,” Greer admitted.  She took the plate from Jess and balanced it on her knee.
By the time he reached the library door, he was breathing hard, his fingers locked on the straps of his backpack.  He paused in the hall for a moment, head down, air hissing between his teeth.  When he looked up, the familiar door of the library seemed to tilt in front of him, the wood flexing like a living thing, twisting against its hinges.
"Is...  That supposed to influence me?  In any way?" Tony asked.
“Stop it,” she said, taking a sip of the milkshake.  “We need him.”
“Right,” Tony said, and before he could manage anything else, Steve was there, his lips gentle against Tony's.  Tony grinned, warmth washing over him.  “Secretly shacking up.”
DJ took a deep breath, his chest exposing with the force of it.  Then he said something.  Something…  Wrong.  Something discordant and sharp and brittle, and it wasn’t a word, it was barely a sound, but Harris flinched from it, his heartbeat accelerating sharply.  Next to him, Darcy’s fingers latched onto his arm, her nails digging into his wrist.  He glanced at her, and she was staring at DJ, her face pale.  She didn’t seem to be aware that she was still holding on.
“And I invited you,” Isaiah said with a broad smile.  “Because polite, proper citizens won’t get anything changed for us today.  You-” He reached out, poking Steve in the chest with one bony finger.  “Might just make so progress.  You’ll sure as hell make headlines.  If you’ll just unclench your teeth and step up to the damn microphone.”
Tony struggled not to smile as Jarvis knotted the tie, settling the strip of silk in place and adjusting Tony's collar.  “Do you pay extra for the 'I told you so's, Jarvis?”
“I am never smelling anything again,” Tony told him.  He smiled at Steve.  “You didn't ask my opinion, but-” He patted the couch.  “I like your place.”
Frustrated, Steve headed up the hall, checking each door he passed, each window.  In some part of his head, he was counting steps, marking distances, looking for weaknesses.  He’d memorized the floorplan days ago, and his patrols kept his occupied, but there was little to be gained from them.
Her eyes cut in his direction.  “No.  I don't.  I think we still have time to spin this in a direction that both makes you seem sympathetic, even romantic, and minimize the damage this causes in the wider political sphere.
He blinked at her.  "Fine.  Why?"
Tony was silent for a moment.  “I’ve made a lot of bad choices,” he said at last.  “This…  Feels like something else entirely.”  He pulled away, pushing himself to his feet, his shirt slipping off his shoulders.  He shook it off, letting it fall to the ground with casual disregard.  He took a breath, his fingers cradling his side.  “I’m fine.  But if you’re worried…”  His smile was slow and sweet and promised wicked things.  “Perhaps you should come.  Watch over me tonight.”
“Sandy?” Bruce suggested.  “He looks like a Sandy.”
He blinked.  He hadn't even heard Sam come up behind him.  “Sorry,” he said, setting the box down on the foyer table.  “I was-  I was just-”  He didn't know how to finish that sentence, so he went with, “Were you saying something?”
“Uh, have we considered what we're going to do if this one is, uh, you know...”  Bruce paused, then looked up at them.  “Competent?”
“I mean, it wasn’t my idea,” Tony said, and Clint leaned out of the door, tapping his finger against his wrist.  Tony waved him off.  “I should get going.”  He paused, one foot on the stairs.  “Tell me you’re safe.”
“I could,” Steve said.  “But if Miss Potts is handling your employees, and I’m handling the boys from Hammer’s House, then who’s going to be taking care of DJ?”
The thug spun around, and Happy snatched the bottle from under his arm and fired it straight at the back of the thug’s head.  It hit a crash, glass shattering in all directions.  “Widow,” he called, his tone almost bored, and his head swung in Steve’s direction.  “Duck.”
There was no reply, and he gave the knob a slight tug.  DJ was huddled in the bottom of the closet, curled up in a ball, his face buried in his arms.  Steve crouched down in front of him.  “Did you have a bad dream?” he asked.  “Or just got scared?”
“Worth it,” Tony said.
She was already focused on her work.  “See? You’re learning already.”
“I think at least a week,” Steve told him.
Tony took a sip of coffee.  “You would've died.  Or killed someone.”
“We got a plan?” Clint asked, taking the platter of scrambled eggs from Darcy.  He sat down, dropping the platter directly on top of the plate and digging in.
“Is this-  Is this some sort of breakdown?” Tony asked him, and Harris pointed back towards the lobby.
“She really was the best hire you’ve ever made,” Pepper told him.  Rhodey cleared his throat, and she looked at him.  “I love you, but you were letting him eat three day old toast that he found in a desk drawer.”
DJ nodded, and without another word, he started up the aisle.  This time, determined not to lose him, Harris fell into step behind him.  He didn’t have to look back to know that Tony and Clint were talking in low tones, their heads bent together.  For some reason, Harris didn’t want to hear what they were saying.  He didn’t want to be adult about this.
“Harbor’s looking better and better,” he gritted out, even as he started walking up the pier, flanked on all sides by his sudden and unexpected escort.
There was a small lamp on the bedside table, one he'd picked up at a street fair a few years back.  Steve flicked it on, and crouched down beside the bed, aiming the phone in Tony's direction.  He was snoring quietly now, his face flushed, his damp hair flopped over his forehead and his arms wrapped tight around a pillow.  Steve smiled at him, his chest aching.  He reached down, tugging the blankets up over Tony's shoulder, and Tony mumbled into his pillow, his nose wrinkling.
He looked up, and Bobbi hadn’t moved, her arms crossed over her chest, her gaze level.  Steve’s mouth moved, struggling to form words.  “The hall beneath the hill,” he said, at last, and she smiled.
"It's not worth it," Stark said, at the same instant that Rhodey said, "Because he's lazy."
Duck pulled off his glasses.  “Ellen.”  He leaned forward.  “You're a good reporter.  You've got good instincts, and good sense, but for this-”
Steve shifted in his chair, and Tony's shoulders went tight. But Steve remained silent, an Toy took a deep breath. “No,” he said, giving Marcy his full attention. “We're already running the risk of a leak, there's no reason to put anything else in writing until we need it.”
Hammer exhaled, his whole body seeming to collapse in on itself, fragile and hollow.  He nodded once, and then again.  “You’re sure.”
“Excuse me, sir,” Steve said, and that was the best Captain America voice, the deeply disapproving but still passably respectful.  “You're telling me that you sent a fifteen foot tall robot into the center of the city with no warning to the citizens?  To what purpose, sir?”
“Only need one,” Steve whispered.
Which, he supposed, wasn’t the pillow’s fault.  It couldn’t be more or less than it was, and it wasn’t the pillow’s fault that he was here, stuck with it as much as it was stuck with him.
He swallowed. “They’re gone.”
“My uncle's an electrician,” Miriam said, and Tony started.  For an instant, he'd forgotten there was anyone else in the room with them.  She took the ring of keys from her father, crossing over to unlock a display case.  “All metal is conductive.  I looked into ceramic, but even that, like Mr. Stark says, it's a danger while working.”  She pulled out a black velvet tray.  “So he went with one that he could wear when he was off the job.”
He pulled his watch from his vest pocket, opening it with a brisk tap of his thumb.  He checked it with a faint frown.  “It is late.”  He looked up.  “And I expect this household to run as it always has tomorrow, which means that we should all take the chance to sleep while we can.”
“I considered it, but no, this is everyone.”  Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders.  “You want to open a few presents before breakfast, Deej?”
Jesse stared at her.  Ellen stared back.  “What?” she asked at last.  “What are you seeing that I'm not-”
Steve took a deep breath.  “The gardener.”
“And he found it,” Natasha said.
“Stane might be our kidnapper,” Billy parroted, his fingers closing on the money.  “I tell them that Officer Rogers told me that?”
“Can you help me with my bike?” Peter asked.
Tony's eyes slid shut.  “I'm not,” he whispered, and there was a note in his voice that Steve couldn't quite understand.  But they were dancing now, and he wanted to laugh, he wanted to cry.
There was a beat of silence, then, “Mr. Stark?”
The boy thought about that.  “They both think the other one will change his mind,” he said.  His head tipped to the side, the hood shifting lower over his eyes.  He reached up, pushing it out of his eyes.  “And they don’t want to risk it.”
On the seat next to him, Furbro stretched, his paws digging at the air for a moment before he curled back into a ball.  “Useless,” Tony told him, and one of the cat’s ears twitched, which was, Tony supposed, as much acknowledgement as he could hope for.
He was already moving, scrambling towards the trunk, towards his own armor, but too slow, way too slow, there was no way he’d get it open, get it on, get it-
“I was desperate,” Steve said.  The bag was warm in his hand, and he gave a hopeful sniff.  “Apple fritter?”
“Damn right,” Pepper called back, and, laughing, let Rhodey pull her into a spin.
“Fixing,” DJ said, holding up the piece of the gauntlet he'd been working on.
“No.  You wouldn’t.  But I would.” Nicholas reached for his tankard.  “You could not be bought.  You could not be threatened.  You could not be intimidated or influenced.  And if someone made the mistake of killing the royal family?  They would also have had to deal with you, and not a one of them was willing to risk it.”  He lifted his cup in a mock salute.  “You were the perfect prince.”
“I told you,” Tony said.  “I told you.  That website is a piece of shit, Jan.”
“Probably,” Tony said, trying to sound undecided about that. “Why?”
The party was still in full swing, and he had to admit, it had gone off without a hitch so far.  The food had been delicious, there'd been no super villain attacks, and everyone was, up to now, playing nice with each other.  If he could get through this, he could have cake.  He smiled to himself, wondering if he should make that offer to Tony.
Tony bit back a laugh.  “I take it I bled a bit on the way in?”
“Goddamn Google takes the fun out of everything,” Tony muttered to himself.  But he was smiling to himself, his steps light and quick as he headed for the wine room.
He looked at her.  “She said, some could come back from their time below the hills, and they'd be full of stories and laughter and music like none had ever heard.  They'd seen something amazing, and it lit them from the inside out, but they kept their feet on safe roads from then on, they kept to the bright places, and away from old oaks.  They held cold iron close, and sang soft laments of the way the old ones danced under the moon.”
"You set this dinner up," Steve said, trying to sound stern.  "And you're late."
She spread her hands.  “Biiiiiig block of ice,” she agreed.  “So, you can see why the border guards made an exception and let them bring you back.  Why they thought we needed a dead boy in ice that would not melt?  I have no idea.  But it was just interesting enough to let them haul you all the way down river, straight to the heart of the city.
Tony stared at him.  “What will it take to make you stop?” he said, and Steve grinned at him.
DJ blinked.  “Little bit,” he said at last.
“Right,” Tony said.  “The direction, as well as the agreement, I can see that you’re a little confused as to what-”
His fingers flexed on the brim of his cap.  "It's cruel.  Crueler than it needs to be," he said, his voice flat.  "It's playing with someone's life.  A child."  He cut a look in her direction, his jaw set.  "For what?  A pretty little picture to humanize Mr. Stark?  So he forgets about the whole thing in a week, and dumps the boy back into a place that barely bothers to feed him?  Where's the fairness in that?  Where's the humanity?"
Obie sighed.  “It’s been a while since you’ve put in an appearance,” he said, and there was a gently chiding note to his voice.
For a long moment, there was nothing, just the same empty, dimly lit flat that Steve had faced every day of his adult life.  Steve stood there, his heart in his throat, not wanting to hope.
DJ considered him.  "Because if I fixed it,” he said, slowly, “then he would know I could.” His eyes flicked in Tony's direction.  “You would know.”
"A very important one," Jarvis said, his hands tucked together at the small of his back.
“It’s pretty obvious,” Carol said, passing the plate of gyoza over to Rhodey.
Tony was laughing, his eyes damp, his breathing uneven.  “I’m fine,” he said, grinning at Steve.  “Steve.  I’m fine. I’m-”  His hands covered Steve’s, his grip solid and strong.  “Are you-”
“The joke's on her,” Stark said to DJ.  “Rhodey smashes things better than anyone.”
Tony nodded.  “You, too.”   Next to him, Steve raised a hand in a wave.  “Tell him…  We love him.”
“You sure did,” Steve agreed.
Tony’s stomach iced over.  “Today?”
“Probably to keep us from interfering,” Tony said, staring at the doors as the floors rushed by as the elevator sped towards the penthouse.
Either that, or he had to admit that he was cursed.  And he refused to believe in curses.
Rhodey crossed his arms over his chest. “You think it’s kidnapping.”
It was a man. He was a bit smaller in stature compared to Steve. But beyond his height, Steve didn’t know much about him. He couldn’t make out any details about the color of his hair of the softness of his eyes. The man in his dream was just felt like a missing piece of a puzzle in his mind. The absence of a person.
Tony threw down his tools in defeat. “What’s the matter with you? No, I am not breaking up with him. We weren’t together to begin with. I’ve known him less than two weeks and only seen him for a few hours during that time. There is no way we could be together.
“Tony, we tried. We failed. I’m with Happy now, but I’m not going to leave you. If anything, you need me more than ever for this stupid plan of your to work. But we’re not going to be like that Tony. Not again. I can’t do that again. You’re asking for something I can’t give, and I don’t want that to come between us. I know it’s rough right now, and it might be rough for a long time, but I’ll be here for you until the end.”
As soon as the door closed behind Stane, Tony’s posture shifted. He sat up straighter. And the playful glint in his eyes disappeared. He slicked back his hair with one hand before loosening his red tie. “Talk to me Pep. Any bugs in the system?”
“Oh come on,” Sam egged on. “If calls were free, I’d bet you’d spend hours on end talking his ear off.”
Steve just laid a quick peck on Tony’s forehead. “I love you too, Tony.”
Tony frowned. Red, white, and blond was looking for him? Really? Why would he be looking for Tony? He didn’t like Tony. Or at least, Tony didn’t think he liked him. When Tony offered him a donut to say thanks, the blond barely said anything. He just took the donut, muttered a quick ‘thanks,’ and walked to the other side of the truck without another word.
If Victor Von Doom talked well into the night as was egotistically standard of him, the next time he and Obie could ‘discuss’ shutting down productions would be tomorrow. But tomorrow and for the next week, Obie had meetings out of the country with the Germans, Italians, and the Japanese for some reason. And unless some sort of surprise happened, the company would keep trucking away like normal and those bastards would keep getting their illegal arms like normal. Things needed to change and they needed to change fast.
“Your regular.”
“No, we need to make our own. I want to be able to go and come whenever, how ever I please. Start with the few shops you scouted out, but if you see anything better, take it. No questions asked. And knock over a few joints in other areas too while you're at it. Don’t want the coppers pinning us down to early. We can get our own turf just fine while still remaining in the Gandor’s graces.”
“Got it boss.”
“Tony-”
Tony’s toes caught the sheet as they curled up. “Aah. Steve!”
“Okay, but he started it,” Tony glowered, shoving another piece into his mouth.
The wolf growled, but Tony didn’t pay him any mind. He dropped the remote-controlled car through the doggy door and sent it spinning round the large enclosure. The car bobbed and weaved through the trees and up and down the small hills. He drove tempting circles around the wolf, but the wolf didn’t even acknowledge the shrill toy coaxing him to chase the rabbit.
Tony pushed himself up on one elbow, brushing a kiss against Steve’s forehead, his nose, and his lips.  “I’d like to see them try.”
“You’re not sorry,” Tony said, and then, into the phone, “Pepper, I’m going to have to call you back.”  There was an indignant yelp from the other end of the call, but Tony had already stabbed his finger on the ‘disconnect’ button.
“Yeah, she can’t be trusted!  How did you not know what-  Did you-”  Sam shook his head.  “Did you think the general nature of cats had changed in the past few years?  Did you think that cats are different now?” He looked down at the scrawny little black and white cat.  “What the hell were cats like when you lived here?”
“Tony’s pacing around my apartment, trying to talk Pepper into lending him the private jet without actually telling her what’s going on.”
“Gay?” Rogers said, with a slight smile.
“Right, because that's logical,” Rhodey said, his voice wry.  “Wear pants.”
“Yes, but it's cold and I'm dry, and I'd like to keep it that way,” Tony said.  Even if a cold shower was probably a good idea right now.  He shifted his weight, glad he was wearing a heavy pair of pajama pants instead of just his shorts.
"That aside," Steve said, hipchecking the fridge door shut, "I'll be happy if it's the clean china."
Steve’s chest seized.  “No.”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  He gave up and fumbled in his pocket for the bottle of aspirin.  “We got married.  That's...  That's a thing that happened, so can we move on?”
Pepper looked over the rim of her coffee cup at him.  “He’s coming back,” she said, with the flat voice of a woman who was not interested in humoring his melodramatic ass.  “I thought you said you were going out with Rhodey tonight.”
Her head snapped up.  Duck was staring at his phone, one hand cupped over his mouth.
“I'd worry about her stealing your truck, but she doesn't have a driver's license yet,” Tony said.  He patted the bed next to him.  “Get your fine ass up here and we can watch something on your laptop.”
“And that worked?” Tony asked, amused despite himself.
Tony reached up, cupping the side of his face.  “Name it.”
He thought about that.  “Money,” he said at last.
“Excellent.” Stark turned around.  “Let's get you a stool, you can hold things for us.”
Steve took it.  “We have a deal, Miss Potts.”
DJ watched as her fingers went white as the braid tightened on her skin.  “I don't...  He doesn't... Think about it,” he said, the words halting.  “They forget.  That I am, I am still me.”  That wasn't right, and he had to stop and think about it, think about the syntax, the rhythm, the way that words worked, what it meant.  “That I have always been me.”
Steve followed her, torn between following her down the back stairs or heading straight for the front door.  "I was going to do a quick walk around the grounds," he said.
“Gotcha,” Darcy said, and Harris got the idea that she did, in fact understand.  Even stranger, he kind of understood as well.
Steve nodded.  “Understood.”  A ball came rolling down the street, and without thinking, he reached down to snag it.  A girl came running up the street, her schoolbag hanging over one shoulder, her skirts hitched up well over her knees.  Steve tossed the ball to her with a smile, and she caught it one handed.  Giving him a gap-toothed grin, she jogged back to where her friends were waiting, the red ribbons at the ends of her braids flapping in the breeze.
“Can I go with both?” Peter said.  “Because, yeah, both.  Both.”  He raised his voice.  "Get some sleep, Chef!"
Steve gave a bark of laughter.  “Fair?  None of this is fair,” Steve said.  “I’m done waiting for fair, I just want…”  He stopped, his mouth a thin line.  “Do you trust me?  To do what’s best for him, and for you?”
“Sit down,” Natasha said, her voice bored, and he scrambled over to the counter, his legs flailing through the air as he landed on one of the stools.  Clint slid the plate in front of him, and Natasha added a few hefty slices of toast.  “Officer Rogers, would you like some toast?”
He didn't know where his feet were, what they were doing, but it was okay, because he hadn't stepped on Tony's toes, he hadn't kicked him in the shins or yanked him off balance.  It wasn't perfect, he knew that, but it was smooth.  It wasn't easy, but it was worth the effort.  Because Tony was relaxed in his arms, his eyes locked on Steve's, a slight smile on his face.
“Oh,” said Tony, the reality of the situation finally dawning on him. Not only was he not in trouble, but Steve liked him. Like, actually liked him the way Tony liked him.
He placed a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Don’t make the same mistake I did Tony. You’re smart, I’m sure you can find another way.”
Steve could almost hear Tony squealing like a child on Christmas morning. “Wait! You met War Machine? Your boss took you to the meeting!? That must have been crazy! What did you think?”
Someone banged on the outside of the truck. “That’s just you, ya punk!”
Shocked at Steve’s speed, Tony hesitated a second too long. Tony dodged the first hit, but a left hook made contact with the chest plate. Iron Man was unharmed, but Tony winced at the sound of bone against metal.
“Can you…” asked Steve, pressing his fingers gently against the raised skin. “Are you…”
“Bucky, please,” begged Tony.
“Besides being a beast in the sheets? I don’t know,” Steve hummed. “Maybe that I’m a hopeless romantic and I made this for the most amazing boyfriend in the world,” Steve said as he reached over and pulled up a tray featuring eggs, bacon, and still steaming coffee.
“I don’t have a choice,” Tony whispered furiously as he pushed aside Steve’s hand. “It’s my name on the line, my design, my fault. I’m not going to sit here and watch while some lunatic burns down Manhattan.”
“Promise you he will,” assured Tony. “When Bruce is done with him, he’ll be right as rain.”
“But”
Always the fool, Barton. Always playing the fool. Pretending to trust others with planted information. Pretending to be the fearful associate to show the others how it’s done with no prior notice from Tony. God, he loved that carnie.
Steve’s eyes drifted over to the goon laying on the floor. The man was beaten up and bewildered, but he didn’t look the least bit sorry for what he had done.
"Tony," it seemed like the only coherent thought Steve could say. "You really didn't have to.” A part of him was yelling to give it back. Steve didn’t need charity from Tony, and he didn’t have time to dwell on such trivial things when the gang was supposed to come first in his life. But his hands held on tightly to the supplies as he brought the pad up to his chest. The solid surface pressed into his chest like it was meant to be there. No matter what his brain was telling him, Steve didn’t want to let go.
Steve hesitated a moment as he tried to figure out the best way to phrase it. “We need guns.”
“Fixed your heater,” said Tony, wiping his hands on a white handkerchief. Was that silk? “If I had better tools and supplies, I could make significant improvements. But for now, it’ll do what it’s supposed to do, make hot or cold air. Boring. I’d love to modify it to see if I could make toast.”
Scmnidt, to his small credit, sorted in amusement. “The only thing I trust you with is a mission; everything and everyone in this place, I want you to burn it to the ground.”
"Status report," he reminded his crew.
It had to be right. Balancing his debts. Saying his goodbyes. It sounded right in his head. So why didn’t it feel right in his heart?
Rhodey hacked out a cough through a drained laugh. “Hold you to it Tones,” he said, voice slurred with exhaustion.
“Anything else they don’t need to know about?”
Tony coughed up the last of his air, filling his lungs with ocean water. His shoulders itched under the wetsuit as red and gold scales popped out from under his skin and dotted his dark flesh like freckles all the way down to his now very scaly waist.
War Machine released a blast of energy. At the last second, Bucky pushed Steve out of the way, diving behind broken parts for cover. Steve fell face first into another blanket of dust as he felt the hairs on the back of his neck burn at the intense pressure.
“Right.” Time and place. Time and place. “Point is, somebody has been stealing some big, really dangerous items from my company. On record, we’re missing grenades, semi-automatics, military grade stuff.”
“He’s a good kid, Steve. Works hard. Makes me wish that all that kids that came ‘round here were as good as Peter.” Made him wish that more men were as good as Peter, but Tony doesn’t say that out loud.
“’Tis a compelling offer. Better than what we’ve ever been offered before,” said Thor.
“You sure? This guy seems to disagree with you,” Steve said, fondling Tony’s morning wood in one large, warm hand.
In the back of his mind, Tony heard metallic panes of the garage door rolled up with a loud ‘rata tat tat.’ He turned his attention just in time to hear a sharp hiss filled the tense air as gas flooded out and up the garage door. The same garage door right where Tony had left Rhodey and Pepper to fend for themselves.
Normally I'd wait another 12 hours before posting this chapter, but I'm having one of "those" kind of days. Enjoy the (for me) unusually long chapter. Don't get used to it. Next week is much shorter.
Not minding the fresh pools of red and the scattered bodies on the road, the chauffeur stepped out of the black limo and straightened his uniform and black mask. In a practiced motion, he got out and opened the curb door for his valued employer. The two forms that stepped out the vehicle stuck out like a straight-laced copper in a juice joint. The white suit, red dress shirt, and white tie the woman wore was almost subtle compared to her male counterpart. He captured the attention of every onlooker with his stark red three piece suit and gold pocket square. Unlike usual Mafioso, the man wore no tie. Instead, a bright blue light shown like a rising sun over the top of his gold vest. The only thing that made it the least bit subtle was a brown trench coat that hung off his shoulders like a second skin.
“No.” He could hear Pepper rolling her eyes as she slipped into the car.
“Nope,” Tony said, popping the word with a smug smile. “Calling it now. Today’s the first day I’ve ever made you laugh.”
Pepper checked her watch. “Obie is supposed to come down to check on you sometime, something about telling you how the board meeting went.”
Slowly, Tony opened his eyes. There was a metal ceiling above his head. He could feel quite thrum of a large engine under his fingers. Tony tried to move his arms, but he was strapped down. Go figure. The air smelled stale. Recycled. But there was a warmth in this place that quelled his panic. A tinted window on his left and something blond and familiar on his right.
“Tony!” Rhodey stood up and yelled in a clear sign of aggression. Tony should have taken it all back, but he knew Rhodhy well enough to know his best friend wouldn’t go through with acting out his rage. Despite all the signs present: clenches fists and teeth, tense shoulders, short breath, Rhodey wasn’t going to win this fight and they both knew it. It wasn’t even something worth fighting about.
Clint, Sam, and Natasha were all so focused on finding the strangest thing they could get Tony to drink that they never thought about what Tony would enjoy. They never considered compatible flavors or techniques. They just went with what sounded funny. Which, as Steve found out as he dove into the world of coffee, was a travesty.
“Someone’s gotta’ when you’re jumping off a plane without a chute,” murmured Bucky.
“Water then,” Tony said, pulling out a second glass. “Need to stay hydrated after a show like that.”
The tension in Steve’s body melted away. Tony wanted to see him. He came all this way in the middle of the night, just to say ‘hi.’ He felt like a fool for feeling this way, but knowing that he was special enough for Tony to come out of his way to visit, it made all the troubles in his life slip away for a second.
And oh god did Tony recognize that voice. Tony tried to go back to sleep, but Steve was insistent. Tony batted Steve’s hand away from his cock. “Steve, no.”
“I don’t want to be too cocky, but I think it looks good. What do you think?” asked Steve as he stepped back from the board.
“Huh?”
The cloud of dust finally thinned out enough for Tony to see Steve cradling the unconscious brunet in his arms.
The hairs on the back of Tony’s neck bristled. “None of your business Obie.” Tony’s words were brusque.
War Machine’s hand precariously began to descend to a small bulge under his jacket. “Is that a threat I hear?”
“You are stupidly stubborn Rogers.”
Tony conceded with a grunt as Clint swung a supporting arm around his shoulders. Tony hated getting up on that ice cold table that Bruce always said was ‘room temperature’, but he needed to get fixed sooner than later.
The man cocked his head. Then he licked Tony’s face, like a dog greeting his owner.
“Settle down you two. Tony, hurry up and eat your pancakes,” Steve said, putting down a perfect cup of coffee in front of
Also, 50k words! Thanks to everyone who has commented and supported me over these past few months. You have no idea how much it helps to see you enjoying what I'm doing.
“Didn’t say,” said Tony. He glanced at Steve. There was a bit of worry hidden in the corners of his eyes, but that didn’t give Steve any information as to what might be in store for him.
"What the hell are you doing here?" his voice borderline hysterical. Smooth Rogers. Real smooth.
“Yes, we do. See?” she said, dragging Tony back to the window. She pointed past the crowd of military men to a group of seven that had isolated themselves off from the normal riff raff.
“Very important in business,” Tony said with a smirk.
Tony suppressed an exasperated groan. Oh, for the love of- “He’s not a cat, Steve. Push him of and get over here. He’ll be fine.”
“Oh come on,” wined Tony. “I’ll show you mind if you show me yours.”
Steve’s cheeks turned pink. He dropped his gaze and let out a breathy chuckle. “I could,” said Steve and god, how did this beautiful man manage to be so adorable? “But I’d like to make what we have official before I do something like that.”
As soon as the clacking of shoes disappeared, Rhodey shifted a critical eye to Tony. Tony tried to avoid it by rustling stuff around to create a busy façade, but Rhodey wasn’t buying it for one second. “One of ours?” asked Rhodey.
He took a deep breath, trying to reason with himself that this was the right thing to do and everything would be okay. “And that make my job even more difficult.”
Clint smirked. “Only the important ones.”
Steve’s blood suddenly turned cold. “Tony!” Steve rushed over to Tony’s side. He ran a hand over Tony’s cheek. Nothing. Two fingers on Tony’s wrist. Pulse, still there. Thank god.
“Shut up Tony.” Steve used his Captain voice. He whirled around to face Tony. “We are going across the river to my apartment, and we are having a drink. If you want to leave after that, you can. But there’s no way I’m leaving you to celebrate alone, and I don’t have the cash to go to a speakeasy.” Desperation clung to his voice. This was something special, something that should be celebrated. Tony needed this. He needed this.
He landed on the floor, the chair only a few inches away from his back, and immediately curled his body into a fetal position. His fingers wrapped around the chair leg for dear life, but it was no use. Tony yanked the chair away from the man’s grasp and sent it flying into the wall.
“Am I still too young to marry you now?” Tony asked with a devious waggle of his eyebrows.
“I’m good. I like spending time with you,” Steve said in a voice so soft Tony wanted to wrap himself up in it like a blanket.
Slowly, Tony cracked open his eyes and saw red. Gorgeous, flaming red hair that belonged to his favorite assistant. “Hey Pep,” he mumbled, slurring the words together. “I ever tell you how pretty you are? Like, really pretty? Like, prettier than Lady Liberty herself.”
Pepper was having none of it. “Semantics,” she said with a glare.
“Well that narrows it down to some,” Bruce spoke, utterly deadpan. “If it looked like breathing physically hurt, but he wasn’t wheezing, I’d say a cracked rib or two.”
Steve looked at Tony, his face downright confused at Steve’s wonder. But there was something else. At that moment, Tony looked more than confused, he looked tired. He looked so tired and alone. Like the weight of the world was riding on his shoulders and he was about to pass out from the weight. On the exterior, Tony looked strong, ready to throw his swagger wherever he pleased. But on the inside, underneath all that, his soul was crying out for a moment’s rest. How did Steve not notice before? The puffy bags under his eyes, the weariness in his shoulders. Steve’s chest clenched. He understood the pressure all too well, and it hurt too much.
Times are a changin' as a silver sax be waillin'.
“How can I calm down after that what just happened?” Steve yelled, thrashing around in an attempt to get out of the mess. “He betrayed me. He betrayed us! And now I bet ya’ he’s laughing all the way to the bank for making me look like a fool.”
“Hey Tony,” yelled Clint as he popped by the dressing room. “Guess what I found for squirt.”
Thor nodded and once Bucky was securely in place, made his way over to the car.
“I’m not thinking.”
Tony’s normally focused gaze was soft, like embers gently flickering at the bottom of a fire. His lips were curled up into the smallest hint of a smile. His cheeks, normally red from the forge, held the slightest touch of pink as he held his hand across the expanse, waiting for Steve to take it.
“Home,” replied Tony, breathing in the rich smell of leather. He reached for the change of clothes Pepper had prepared for him earlier that day. A charcoal  grey suit and red silk tie. Perfect for taking over the world. “And schedule time to come back next Tuesday. We’ve got a lot to do if we want to make the territory ours.”
“Do the rest of you understand?” Iron Man said, turning his attention to the cowering children.  “My men of Iron will protect you from anything. But if you so much as utter a word of treachery to anyone, you better pray to whatever Gods you have that fate intervenes. Because I will not be as merciful. I know what it means to be in pain,” he said, tapping the glow in his chest. “Now, imagine my pain transferred tenfold to you.” His voice began to rise with the gravity of the warning.
Natasha hushed his with a pointed look. “See. Captain America eats his strawberries. You should have some too.”
“Tony,” Steve said, “He’s you.”
“I hardly see us as normal people Rogers.”
“Yes?” said Steve, busily whisking all the ingredients together.
Steve smiled back at him. “Hey,” he said. “How you feeling?”
"I just, you know…” Tony averted his gaze and the highs of his cheekbones flushed pink against his naturally pigmented skin. “I wanted to see you while I still could."
“Captain Rogers, it would be my pleasure.”
Anxiety began eat at his nerves. Did he take too long to get here? Did his duties as Iron Man finally destroy one of the few good things in his life? God he hoped not.
“Shut up Bucky,” hissed Steve.
“Why?”
“Who?” Tony demanded. He sounded hysterical. “Who else would give you guns? Because I sure as hell know you don’t have the money to buy them.”
“I don’t know. A while? At least since that time Natasha choose to spike me coffee with vodka. Not a fan of the flavor, but it woke me up real quick.”
“Bruce said we can’t touch or else the world will explode,” the kid said, peeking out from behind Steve’s back. “If you try to take Cap away from me, I’ll… I’ll…”
“Steve, it’s fine. I’m in a tinkering mood right now. Gotta use my hands for something.”
Pepper gave an ambivalent shrug. “You have been a bit spacy since you came back.”
Tony smiled. “I know,” he said. His voice was gentle. Completely different from the tone he used in the interrogation room.
The word ‘options’ sounded ominous. Steve wasn’t looking forward to whatever theses ‘options’ were. It would mean Bucky would have to make a choice. Or worse, maybe Steve would have to make that choice for Bucky. What if he made the wrong choice? What if he did what he thought was in Bucky’s best interest and he got it wrong. What if Bucky had to live the rest of his life with a glowing machine in his chest because of a stupid mistake Steve made. Would Bucky ever be able to forgive him?
“A pretty shitty one.”
“Everything ready for the run?” asked Steve, doing a last minute check of the product. He rattled the neck of a bottle around in the crate, checking for any unnecessary movement.
“Ah…” Damn. Tony had said his last name a few times. What was it? “Tony,” he said as uselessly tried to recall some semblance of a name. “Dark hair, brown eyes, about this tall?” His hand hung mid air like a floppy dead fish.
Sam took a cautious step back, holding his hands up in a weak attempt to protect himself from Steve’s wrath. “Steve?” he asked, his voice calm and gentle
“And does he know about…” Rhodey waved a hand around to all the stuff in the lab, but Tony knew he meant much more that what could immediately be seen.
Tony nodded. He looks back at the town, lights flickering in the distance. Timely celebrating a rare moment of peace, joy, and merriment abound. Laughter and gay carols echo across the empty plains and Tony realizes, at least for now, that’s not where he wanted to be.

“You settling in well?”
Rumlow gave Tony a wide, toothy smile. “Every single word,” he said, punctuating each syllable. “Well, every word that was important. Kept going in and out of consciousness. Do you know how hard it is to try and play possum while a couple of cake-eaters fuck their brains out in front of you?”
“So by all means,” she said, with a careless air. “Open a random box. Just don’t come to me when your face melts off because you get a glance of some experiment gone awry. You never know if the stuff here is just put away for later or put away for good.”
“What if he doesn’t feel the same way?” asked Steve. The potential of rejection had hung over him like a gray cloud for the past two weeks. It’s why he didn’t try to push the kiss as hard as he would like. “It’s not like the casual hookups you find around here.”
“Hm?”
The aggressive energy drained from Tony’s shoulders until all that was left was a mortified husk of a man. His lips formed the beginning of quick lies and excuses, but nothing came out. Giving up with a sigh, Tony ran a hand through his dirty hair and begged, “Can we just pretend you never heard me say that?”
Follow me on my tumbler and see all the shit I reblog.
“Well don’t,” a stern voice chastised the three men as if they were arguing children. “We don’t want to ruin a perfectly good evening.” A hand popped between them, breaking the tension. "Jane Foster," she said holding out her hand for Tony to take. Thank god for Jane and her instincts.
“But-”
Tony let out a heavy breath and rubbed a free hand over his face. They were safe, for now. Didn’t matter what Stane felt. It wouldn’t matter in the big picture. “Bring me the specs and any adjustments R&D made. I’ll take a look at them when I have a moment,” he said, voice heavy with exhaustion.
“Does that mean you’re going to let him skip on his vegetables too?” asked Clint. “Shouldn’t do that. Kids need their nutrients and that’s a steep hill you’re climbing, Steve.”
“No. They seem persistent to say the least.” Rumlow grunted in response when none of his men showed up with blood on their hands.
