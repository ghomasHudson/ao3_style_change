"I do!" Tony cried out. He came closer to Steve and grabbed his hands, bringing them to his chest to clutch them there. "I really want to marry you!" he stressed.
" Just the reaction Tony didn't want, and the reason he had tried to avoid saying it back at the pawn show where a cynical store keep had given him enough cash for the simple gold band to last them a week of living frugally, or as Steve called it, 'like normal people'.
"Then what?" Steve said with an easing in his heart. He was so sure that there was nothing that could shatter the bond between them if they
Tony looked down so he wouldn't be meeting Steve's eyes in the bathroom mirror. "Hmm. What's the plan tomorrow?"
The moment the hotel clerk looked up and saw Tony there, his expression turned secretive and he covered the receiver on the phone, as if Tony could overhear the other side of the conversation. Tony paused on the way to the stairs and studied him. The smile plastered on the clerk's face so bland as to be entirely fake, and Tony had been in enough situations like this himself to know the jig was up.
Being surrounded by Zola's private research was mind-bending. In these rooms lay the foundations of Project Insight. In here, Zola had began to conceive a container for his intellect that was a computer when his body started failing him. Perhaps it was in these very rooms that Howard had made the final progress with the super soldier serum that would eventually get him killed. In the corner of the lab stood the machine Tony wanted to use, a glass container with a space for a vial, and a computer terminal. He turned it on, and set to work.
, felt dangerous. Tony had always had a problem burdening people too much with his emotional needs. Steve was all manful handshakes, and Tony—Well.
Tony jerked back, eyes flying open. He was pressed back against the car door behind him, as if he could get out of Steve's reach. His thoughts were a chaotic mess. Did he want to get away? He'd wished Steve to reach out for him so badly just a little earlier, and now that it was happening, it felt worse than getting electrocuted. Tony was sure Steve could hear his shallow breaths in the awful silence that followed. He was panicking. Everything was made worse because Tony could see even in the faint light that Steve looked surprised to be so summarily rejected. While Tony curled in on himself, Steve shifted awkwardly in the seat. His eyes scrutinized Tony's face — did he look as shocked as he felt? — and Steve nodded to himself.
And as he came awake, still his heart felt leaden while he slowly blinked his eyes open, staring at the ceiling. His comforter really was quite heavy.
The thought crystallized in his head, and somehow it was Steve's voice that might have said it at one point or another, when Tony had made another call that risked certain death. Or maybe it was Steve making the call that put himself in harm's way and how Tony felt thinking he was dying. In a frozen moment, his eyes sought out Steve on the other end of the clearing, throwing off an alien and turning, suddenly. Steve saw him. Steve's eyes burrowed into his, bright pinpricks. In another instant, darkness would swallow even his brilliant spark. All of it existed still and immutable as if frozen in time. And Tony was going to save them, but he needed some help.
He crouched in front of Steve, grabbing his shoulders, looking into his face. The image of Steve bleeding out, dying, rose before his eyes and Tony's heart gave a violent lurch. "I would have never let you jump." The words blurted out of his mouth before he knew he was saying them.
Tony groaned, and drew Steve's shirt closed, careful of the injury. "Because thinking something happened to you was a walk in the park. You get that keeping things from each other has never made things better, right?"
"Everyone in attendance has the same clearance as us," Steve pointed out reasonably. "Let's go. There's nowhere else I'd rather be."
"I love you," he offered his hand, palm out. When Tony first glanced at it, then somewhat hesitantly took it after looking between the offered hand and Steve's face, Steve smiled and carefully pulled him closer into an embrace. He kissed Tony's temple. "I do," Steve murmured into the side of his head. Tony nuzzled into his arms, and stayed there, hugging him back. "I'm prepared to walk out there and say the vows I've been planning to say just like this. Because I would mean all of them. In sickness. In health. For better or worse. Every single word!"
It was scary how quickly he began to depend on Steve, again, once he gave himself permission to trust him. Tony didn't know what to do with all the warmth welling in his chest just then, so he swept it aside to deal with later. He moved his shoulder, a half shrug, and even though Steve's serious gaze was still acting like a magnetic force on him, there was more space to breathe.
Today — the day they signed the papers and got married for real — had been something they were both looking forward to. He thought.
. Tony basked, knowing it was all for him. "I've got you. Come on." Steve slid an arm around Tony's midriff, helping him rise. They stumbled to their feet.
—?" Tony put a hand to his heart and pretended the hairs on the back of his neck weren't standing up. "You know how I feel about dogs."
Tony kissed his bandage at the temple, feather light, and lay down on a pillow next to him, facing him. Their fingers lay entwined between them.
"Don't change the subject," Tony said, but came over as if drawn. His feet truly were killing him, and roughing it in the car the night previous hadn't done his back any favours, either. He scrambled down to lay on the side, on the golden-hued hay next to Steve, facing him, and tucked a bent arm under his head. Then nearly groaned in pleasure, as every muscle in his tired body seemed to want to weep in gratitude for being at rest. His feet especially. The earthy smell of dry hay teased his nostrils. The makeshift bed was rough, blades of grass sticking out, but surprisingly comfortable. Across from him, Steve yawned contagiously, and Tony found himself covering a yawn, as well. He tried to recollect his slippery train of thought. "You gotta
"4A," Tony showed him the thick iron key with a leather tag. "Let's get going before your young fans adopt you."
Steve pressed his lips together, then said in his quiet voice that meant he heard you and emphasized. "We have to go now. Something this high profile — Peggy must be in charge of the investigation. She'll be looking for us. We have to jump back."
He pulled his hands out of Tony's grip — Tony looked distraught about that, but his expression changed to surprise and curiosity when Steve simply strode towards the desk, and the truth serum in a vial there. It changed to shock when Steve grabbed the vial and drank it empty.
Tony drove another minute in silence, but it wasn't like there was anything on the way down to Jersey that deserved that kind of focused attention, and if there was, Tony wanted to hear about it.
"Natasha would have been great at this. This infiltration stuff," Tony clarified at Steve's quick questioning look. He clenched the wheel harder. "Hell, she probably wouldn't have dropped the ball in 2012. Maybe she and Clint should have gone there and you and me to Vormir, huh?" Despite the ease of his words, Tony found himself shivering. Between the nuke and the voyage to Titan, he was two out of two for terrible trips to outer space and not eager to repeat the experience. Natasha had read that about him in about two seconds flat and volunteered.
"Shall we?" Satisfied, Tony slid a hand around Steve's elbow. "Any national secrets you feel like spilling to our guests?"
"You know they grow up to weigh 150 pounds, right?" Newfoundland dogs were cute as hell though, Tony had to admit. He'd always had a weakness for a large animal.
"The whole island has no power; it's mayhem out there," Tony said, which Steve took to mean they were on their own. His heart sank a little more. The cold of the water suddenly registered more strongly, as if the knowledge unlocked some secret pathway in his head, and he shivered. Tony was telling him something; Steve focused on his voice rather than the thought of drowning. "Half the roads are flooded. I stole a big ass crane, I'm gonna hook it up to the grate and I'm gonna yank this sucker out. Then I'll come get you, okay? But you need to stay awake! Can you do that?" he sounded alarmed.
Tony grit his teeth. "Just a moment." Who designed this? What kind of a convoluted way of thinking would lead someone to put those two sets of instructions together?
Tony swirled around and spread his hands like he had nothing more to say. "I can't go outside like this. The first person who asks me questions will get an earful. I'm talking
The torrential dark water came up to Steve's chest before the thought occurred to him that he might not make it.
Tony thought, clenching his hands so hard the blunt fingernails dug into his skin. Even in the heat of action, Steve could have taken a moment to meet Tony's eyes, let him know what was about to happen. If Tony had been ready, maybe the whole thing would have gone differently. He didn't know how, exactly, but he did know that Steve didn't need to have gotten shot.
Steve looked at him, somber, through his mask. His eyes were all wrong, a different colour and shape, but something about them still rang true to Tony, a bit like understanding a word in an otherwise foreign language.
"Fifi. She's my PA's dog, actually," he answered, and mentally wondered what he was doing telling the truth. Appearing like a dog owner was clearly the name of the game here. But it seemed wrong to pretend with Steve, who was without a doubt having the best time. Fifi was milking it for all she was worth, naturally, licking Steve's hands and making him laugh in a way that was a revelation. She'd never so much as attempted that with Tony, perhaps sensing his anxiety. "You're really good with her."
Steve took the burger and began to eat. After a minute of slow chewing, he looked up. "What are you having?"
"Babe, remember to breathe," Tony entreated him, his hand a warm weight at his neck, massaging in circles. "Nice and slow, okay. You're safe. I'm here."
Tony rushed back in to support him, catching him by the elbows. Steve just stared at him blearily, from a chalk white face. Rapidly looking him over, Tony could see the red stain of blood trailing down from his chest near the shoulder. "You got shot?!"
He glanced back at the man by his side and caught Steve looking softly at him. His heart stuttered, and they both looked away.
"If we steal the right IDs, we could be in and out. They won't have any real shielding on the Tesseract. At least nothing I can't deal with."
Tony blinked at that onslaught of information to unpack. He took Morgan's hand, rising. "Let's go see Steve, then, and thank him." She skipped along at his side, as if they were dancing. "And what's that in my hand."
Tony rolled his eyes, but leaned into him. "Stop with that," he muttered, hiding his face in Steve's shoulder.
He was half-way down the stairs to the ground floor when he saw Steve, moving stiffly and more carefully than Tony normally saw him walk, leaning on the wall with a hand. He looked drunk. Tony registered the curious look from the woman at the counter, and filed that away for later, unable to focus on it now. He knew this wasn't alcohol affecting Steve. Tony hurried to him and pulled Steve's arm across his own shoulders taking some of the weight.
They looked at each other. Steve's expression slid from dumbfounded to fierce. "I want to be with you."
"You're not making any sense right now, you know that?" Steve offered gently. "And yet somehow I still love you." He grinned. "My lot in life."
"Not you, though." Steve said balefully, and Tony could feel the focus of his stare. "You're baseline human. It would kill you."
"Mmm," Steve nodded, looking somehow more focused than before. "Shouldn't you take a break? You've been on your feet all day." Steve shifted slightly, and patted the expanse of hay next to him, in invitation to lie down for a bit.
His hand on Steve's cheek felt real. As real as anything he'd ever experienced, and suddenly it wasn't a conscious decision at all.
He was a giant hypocrite, of course, because Tony certainly had had his share of jagged crying fits over the past five years. Above all stood out Morgan's second Christmas, when Pepper was on the other coast and Tony was stuck with a toddler that wouldn't go to sleep, and kept screaming no matter how he tried to soothe her. After Morgan was finally quiet in the early morning, he'd ended up in tears himself, wondering who was he kidding here. He had felt like the world's worst fake dad. How he'd wished he could have asked his mom what to do. She was thirty years gone, then, and in that moment, Tony had missed her so much he couldn't breathe. Even now, he had to clear his throat before he could continue, "Don't give up on the future yet."
"I—" Steve was reduced to syllables. His voice was a shadow and he kept having to gulp for air because his lungs seemed to be refusing to work properly. He strove to compose himself, but it was an illusory goal. All he could think of was the ache in his heart when he'd
Steve cried. Silent tears rolled down his face and the numbness around Tony's heart cracked at the sight.
"I don't know," Rhodey admitted with a sigh, "He wouldn't actually talk to me directly. He had FRIDAY relay the message, but the gist was: he doesn't want to see anyone until it wears off."
Steve's touch was like a key turning in a lock. Tony knew suddenly that he could let Steve into his home, and trust that Morgan would still be safe. That if there was any danger, Steve would put himself bodily between it and Morgan without a moment's hesitation. He'd die for Tony's girl, the same way Tony would. And Steve wouldn't resent Tony the times he had to put Morgan first.
. Well, what did he expect, meeting him in a park with a dog of his own? Fifi sensed a person she could get to do her bidding and leaped to her feet, wagging her tail at Steve, and shaking the pink leash in Tony's hand. Nervous around strangers, hah!
, rather than being locked up in his lab. Her dark eyes switched between Tony and Steve and seemed to say:
And Steve wasn't done. He was still watching Tony with an indescribable look in his eyes, their blue turned a paler washed out gray in the moonlight. "Sometimes I feel like you're a universal fixed point. And— There's a force of gravity, pulling me to you, into your orbit." Steve looked down after, like hiding his eyes would take some of the punch from the words. It didn't.
He'd asked that question before, but never with less need for any artifice over wanting to know the answer.
There was nothing he could do to make it better. He didn't believe there was a 'better' for people like them, watching the endless parade of ghosts of their lovers, friends, family. Gone now. No platitude about her living on in their memories, no assurance that time would heal all wounds would make a difference to Steve, but Tony had to at least try be there for him. So he remained close by.
to understand the science. I hate to say that, but we don't have the time. Instead we can duplicate the one vial we already have. Synthesize a replica of it."
"The reception is in half an hour!" Steve exclaimed, not at all like he'd been waiting for this day for possibly his entire life, except he has. Postponing it, even by a day, felt like a bad omen, like somehow all his hopes and dreams would be crushed into fine dust. It was unreasonable, sure, but he was
"Nat would want us to keep going," Tony said, squeezing Steve's hand. "C'mon." Tony caught Steve's elbow, helping him to his feet. "I've got FRIDAY modeling a glove that should fit all the Infinity Stones. Natasha lay down her life to give us this chance. We can't waste it," Tony said. "But I promise you. We get this done. We get the Snap reversed and everyone's okay? We can talk about it then."
Tony swallowed down his fear. Composing himself through his madly racing heart, Tony stretched out a hand towards Buster. He wasn't a coward, and the puppy was evidently well-natured. Buster didn't move, just looked at Tony with deep dark eyes that seemed to stare into his soul. He'd already forgiven Tony for his involuntary recoil of course, because dogs didn't hold grudges. A gentle giant. If Tony's hand shook when he bent down to pat the dog lightly on the forehead then that was nobody's business other than his own. The black fur felt soft against his skin.
"Tony?" Steve managed to gasp past the terrible knot in his throat, past the stinging in his blurring eyes. His arms came up to wrap around the other man, solid and whole —
"Then there's getting to Jersey. We definitely don't have the money to both rent a car and eat — you choose."
"I gathered that." They were hidden from view, but that meant they couldn't see out into the courtyard either, which left Tony feeling like an ostrich. It wouldn't be long before the base was swept and they would be discovered. "The main gates will be shut. We'd have to fight our way out." And that would be the end of their resolve to cause no harm or casualties to innocent people.
"It's gonna be fine," Steve told him. Tony threw him another wild look, full of unspoken words, and turned to leave.
By that point, the plan began to fall into place. Steve used one of his many talents to acquire them an older model Chevy, its black hood gleaming in the sun as Tony drove and Steve watched the scenery from the passenger seat, somewhat morosely. The drive was slow. Tony had always liked these older cars because they talked to you. This one was telling him her troubles with the whistling rumble of the engine. He couldn't spare the time to give it some much needed TLC, get it purring like it could be, so he kept well below the speed limit to avoid overheating the engine.
The barrels of golden hay stored inside the one-storey barn had made an excellent bedding once Tony unrolled them on the ground. They had the color a few shades lighter than Steve's hair.
On impulse, Steve caught his wrist at the last moment, stopping him in his tracks. Tony's look back at him was terrified beyond measure, as if he had only barely controlled his expression when he'd known Steve would see. Before Tony could even try to compose himself again, Steve squeezed his wrist. "If anything happens—No,
"Yeah, I have some thoughts around that." Tony stopped in his tracks and swirled back dramatically. He had the stage; Steve was watching attentively where he sat. "For the past couple of days we've been focusing on getting a second vial."
"Look around, see where he stores synthetic compounds," he directed at Steve, mind already on the screen in front of him.
Steve glanced over at him, then smiled. It transformed his entire face. "Hey," he said back in a voice that Tony was quickly beginning to identify as
He was still trying to wrestle the heavy grate off his leg with unsteady, cold hands, and it stubbornly refused to budge, essentially pinning him in place to the floor. The cold did not affect him as quickly as a regular person, but even with the benefits of the serum, his body was struggling to cope after being submerged in the icy water for so long. Tony had been gone for thirty six minutes since Steve started counting them in his head, to keep his focus. The one saving grace was Tony had been uninjured in the tunnel collapse, except for minor bruising, and after they had been unable to pull Steve right leg out on their own, he'd gone looking for help.
By the time Tony got back, carefully landing behind the trees and slipping inside the barn, Steve was sitting up, leaned against one of the pillars that held up the roof. Tony was both happy to see he'd had the strength to pull himself upright, and worried about the graying cast to his face. Steve's fingers stilled when Tony poked his head through the door; he had been turning the familiar steel compass over in one hand. Now he looked relieved, like Tony had been the one in any danger.
"Is everything a competition with you, still?" Steve wondered, relaxing into the possibility that this moment could exist between them.
Steve put one of his palms to cover Tony's, on the side of Steve's face, and pressed that palm into his cheek, against the start of a rough stubble there. His chest rose and fell like he'd just run a marathon, and Tony found his own breath speeding up. "I tried so hard to give you space. Whatever you want, I've given it to you. But this, you being like
"If you still want to, then tell me when we finish this," Tony entreated forcefully. "And I'll believe you." That much at least was true.
Steve's laugh might have been a sob. "You saved us. But it was too much. You—." He couldn't. Just thinking of it, of Tony in that state, brought excruciating pain. His right arm had been charred. Steve couldn't do this, his mind shied and skittered away from the memory. He opened his eyes and drank in the sight of this very alive, very worried-looking man straddling his lap.
"I'm with you," Steve responded, gathering himself and pushing away his weariness. He shook his head to clear it, and that helped. The water was lapping at his chin now, and he couldn't stand up, as much as he wanted to get out of this cold, murky water — he couldn't, without ripping his right leg off. The grate's thick wrought beams pressed down on each side of his thigh, neatly keeping him locked in place on the floor of the tunnel.
Tony was about to crow over the ease of their successful escape when his sensors registered Steve's grip starting to slip from his armor. If Tony wasn't clasping him to himself, he would have fallen.
He came to, on the muddy ground on the side-bank, on his hands and feet coughing up water. Tony was at his side, patting his back.
Then Steve was turning to look down at his injured right arm, his expression somber and full of concern. His fingers were gentle, turning it palm up to see better. And yeah, those burns did not look good. Tony turned his eyes away. He'd rather watch Steve.
Steve's blue eyes smiled at him, and then Steve ducked down and pressed a little kiss to Tony's mouth again. Tony grinned against his lips. All those PDAs. Steve was going to be unbearable with them, Tony just knew. He'd come on all rules and regulations, but he was going to be the one to break them all.
"So you see, I didn't mean this to happen." Steve lowered his eyes, somewhat bashfully. Tony wanted to kiss his eyelids, and he was almost incapable of remembering why he shouldn't. Typically this feeling incited panic and the need to back away, but something changed, a switch had been flipped. All he wanted was to be closer to Steve. Steve who continued in a rush: "I know what it's like to watch something awful and be unable to stop it. I didn't want
Feeling unaccountably self-conscious with Steve there, watching him, Tony twisted the faucets and splashed some water on his face, wiping it with the soft white towel from the rack.
Tony waved a hand. "No, no, you do it. I'm over it. Besides, I've got loads to do before we even need a car."
"But did you see Clint when he learned he could go into space?" Steve said softly into the oncoming dusk. "I think he actually cracked a smile. After that, no way was Natasha gonna let him go off on his own, what's with everything."
Tony swooped down to grab Steve around the midriff. "Time to go, Cap," he said and took off into the sky with Steve, fast enough that he could hope they wouldn't be tracked in the confusion, The sun's blinding rays covered their ascend. Steve clutched on to his shoulders with a death grip as Iron Man sped out into the blue.
," Steve stressed, when Tony turned to him, ready to speak, "I know you, and if you say it'll work, it'll work."
"Like...You don't remember." Tony sighed. "You and the others? We all kind of used the stones together? I can't imagine what that kind of power would—" He stopped and studied Steve's face. "Ah."
Tony pushed down the flaring temper and tried to stay calm for Steve's sake. The other man was taking in the surroundings with the lethargic look of the convalescing.
"Oh, hi there,"— Tony glanced down at the name tag on the lanyard —"Steve." He beamed at him. And watched recognition strike Steve like a pole-axe.
"Damnit," Tony muttered, hesitating. He didn't want to leave the shield behind either, but from the look in Steve's eyes, the thought hurt him.
The words were like pinpricks of sunlight piercing the cloud, colouring everything in a different light. Tony knew, of course. "I love you," Steve repeated again, fiercely.
"Yeah, twist my arm." Steve smiled. "C'mon, my best-decision-of-my-life. Let's not keep our friends waiting."
"Huh." Tony's glance at him was one of admiration. "Of course, you can hot-wire a car. ...Did Natasha teach you?"
"Hey, hey, you alright there?" Tony panted, wrapping his fingers around the bars to keep steady as the dark water rushed past them. Even though he could keep out of the water when he stood up, Tony was soaked through and through, previously-white shirt clinging to his shoulders and his wet hair plastered to his forehead. "I'm getting you out, okay." After a moment, he reached through the thick moss-covered bars with one hand and grasped Steve by the shoulder, shaking him a little. "Stay up, soldier." Steve realized he'd started to slip, and tried to shake himself awake. "That's it," Tony encouraged him, trying to keep hold of Steve while water swirled around him.
"Tony." Nodding, Steve held his eyes and said in earnest, "I shouldn't have assumed. And, um. Let me make it up to you?"
Steve smiled, happy all of a sudden. He felt like warm sunlight had touched his skin — except it was still dark, even with the half-moon out, and all of it was only Tony, only
Instead, Steve took out a rolled up wad of green bills and threw it on the covers. "I won some money at pool."
"Working on that." Steve drew a shuddering breath. "We're on even ground now." He didn't know if the truth serum was working, or if he'd even be affected given the supersoldier serum running through his veins. But he wanted nothing less than to tell Tony the truth anyway. It was a compulsion that had been there before, buoyed by his emotions, and if the serum helped them along, that only made it easier.
Tony's eyes flew open when he felt a jacket cover him. Steve had lent him his own. "You looked cold," he contended when Tony stared at him accusingly. His big hand stroked down the side of Tony's arm, once, twice. Whether it was the strident note in Steve's voice or the way those arms felt, for a moment Tony let him.
"You're going to show up to Camp Leigh dressed in a shiny polyester print," Tony cautioned cheerfully.
The image inducer would allow them to go almost wherever they pleased, but so far Tony only had a prototype that altered the colour of his eyes. In its final form it would cover the whole face, projecting a hologram of a different appearance, but even then though it conformed to muscle movements, it would not cover touch. They'd have to be careful.
He didn't have a good view of the road, so Tony went out of their hotel room, directionless, only knowing he couldn't stand back and wait. He had no idea where he'd start looking for Steve.
"A crane?" Steve murmured to himself, trying to connect the dots as to how a crane helped them. He was stuck a few dozen feet inside a tunnel. He knew if he could just focus, he'd understand Tony, who seemed to be leaps and bounds ahead of him.
"Not now," Tony rushed to say, staving off this talk until it didn't make him lose his mind. He was barely keeping it together as it was. "Not here. Tell me— Tell me when we get through this." He was asking for a lot, but that was what he needed.
"But we know he's got all the equipment we need to synthesize the particles, down in the SHIELD labs. My dad worked with him for a while, studying the serum. They were trying to replicate it from samples of your blood," — Steve's expression reflected his distaste —"but that's organic matter, DNA. The Pym particles is a pure chemical formula, they don't need to bind to human blood to work."
He'd thought about it back at the lake house, kissing Morgan's forehead as he set out for the Avengers compound. He'd thought about it a lot.
Tony put his hands on both sides of Steve's face, looking at him as if he could peer inside. Steve stared back with his blue blue eyes, and Tony lost every trail of thought, his mind becoming quiet and still. For a moment, all he wanted was to press his mouth to Steve's, to kiss him and whisper promises against his lips. Steve's eyes roamed over Tony's face, and his mouth fell open just slightly, so invitingly, seemingly poised on the verge of saying something, perhaps telling Tony to go ahead.
He leaned hard on Steve, one arm wrapped around Steve's broad shoulders, knowing the other man wouldn't mind. Steve was a little shaky on his feet himself, so they held each other up. Tony wasn't gonna be the one to say it, but pain killers were wearing off already, and his right arm hurt like it would fall off. And everything they'd lost, the struggles that came along the way, those were all still there, pressing on his heart. But that weight was bearable, because they had each other. They'd done it. They'd actually kept what they found, and didn't die trying. Nobody was more amazed than Tony, who'd from the first felt that Thanos was a curse hanging over him that would maybe take him down. But: Steve. Steve had shared the burden of the power of the Stones, and was pressed up against Tony's side now, holding him close. Tony let more of his armor melt away, just so he could feel him be closer. Steve was so warm.
"They've got Zola down there, working for them," Tony said, gingerly stepping around the issue that he was sure was playing on Steve's mind as much as it's been on Tony's. Zola was leading the Winter Soldier project. "You know he's spent a good part of his life trying to replicate Erskine's formula."
"I'm okay," Steve mumbled, managing to open his eyes that had started to slide shut. He tried to focus on Tony. "D-did you find help?" He knew if he didn't get out of here in the next ten minutes, the water would cover his head. Breathing underwater was not his forte.
"Is it really a truth serum?" Steve came closer. He took one of Tony's hands in his — Tony let him — and held it. It felt warm and normal to the touch, if a bit clammy. Tony looked awfully nervous, and something inside Steve eased slightly at the sight. Maybe it
Tony moved. In reality, it probably took only a moment, but with the mad thrumming of his heart in his ears, Steve felt like Tony's hand moved in a slow motion, settling on his cheek —
Tony had to stop thinking about it, or he would do something spontaneous and insane like turn around and hug Steve.
didn't want to wake up. "Just tell me. Please tell me," he said, feeling himself start to shake a little.
He braced himself for no response, but after a few seconds, the blackout was lifting and the door was opening, and there Tony was. He looked just like he always did — that is to say,
Tony stared out into the darkness outside the car. It took him a while to realize he never said good night back, and by then they both pretended Steve was asleep.
about being on this Time Heist with Steve set Tony's heart beating too quickly in his chest. Besides the hope that this plan had given to all of the Avengers, Tony had a personal interest in time travel since childhood, sparked reading Ray Bradbury and H.G. Wells under the bed-covers at night. While a big part of him was terrified of never seeing Morgan again, he was also nearly jubilant to get to travel through time. The very idea had Tony's inner geek freaking out. And then there was the way Steve had said he trusted him: certainly, and without reservation. The way he'd made the call to jump into the past, with nothing but one of Tony's wild guesses and his word to rely on. That kind of trust was equal parts wonderful and unbearable, both.
"Only that—" Tony waved a frustrated hand. Steve wasting himself away on a memory didn't sit well with Tony. He could do better than that. "Yeah, for sure, the rough winds lately have been very, very rough, but— Can't just curl up in a ball and cry, right?"
He heard Steve lock and bar the door behind them with a desk. They had an agreement that if Zola did show up, Steve would only punch him a little, but overall they preferred not to be interrupted.
"Then you know what you have to do," Tony threatened, swallowed thickly and tried to scan the horizon. He had to get Steve horizontal, so his major organs would be well supplied with the significantly reduced quantities of blood. Out here in the field they were too exposed, and Tony had a sudden urge to get out of the open. Steve's head landed on Tony's shoulder, which couldn't be that comfortable given the hardness of the armor, but there was little Tony could do about it at present. His armor allowed him to easily carry Steve's bulk, something he wouldn't have likely been able to do out of it. His voice softened. "Hold on. I'll find us a safer location."
And now, here they were, with an actual plan. Everything could still go side-ways, but at least they were doing
Steve was still next to him, but he was silent, keeping himself to himself. They looked at each other, across the divide between their reclined seats. Steve's mouth opened to speak, but he bit back whatever words seemed ready to spring out. After a long silence, Tony huffed and shut his eyes, tilting his face into his jacket, serving as a pillow.
"I...Yeah?" Tony looked at him, confused. Wasn't that what he just said? "That feels like a trick question?"
"Howard Stark's expedition ship recovered this in the Arctic," Tony had bullshitted to the face of a security officer at the inspection entrance gate when they opened the portfolio case with the gleaming Captain America shield in it. "We're bringing it down to the labs for study." Steve did his best impersonation of a stone-faced SHIELD agent next to him.
Tony moved his gaze down to the space between their chests, his free hand worried the material of Steve's shirt. "Well. As it happens. I have a lot of trouble saying no to you in general. Or keeping away. As a matter of fact this is something that you should probably already be aware of. As a thing. That I have trouble with. Or, you know, not kissing you, but in a totally non-life-saving way except, I uh, kind of think it might be? Life-saving? Life-altering, maybe? I mean, you do; you know?" He stared at Steve as if any of that made sense — it made perfect sense to Steve at that exact moment — and started to wind down with a stuttering, "And I—I—I need that." His eyes grew wider yet as he paused. "Wow,"— Tony went to jerk back, stopped by Steve's arm around him holding on tight—"I just said a lot of things I wish I didn't."
Tony didn't even get a chance to open his mouth before Steve threw one of the vials at the truck behind them. Several things happened in rapid succession. A vial with Pym particles splattered over the roof of a truck. Multiple voices cried out as the truck expanded to the size of small building, throwing the soldiers around it back out of the way. While confusion reigned, Steve leaned down, grabbed Tony under his knees and back, and threw him over the wooden fence onto the other side, to safety.
Tony shot him a glance over the shoulder. "What? Did you miss that we have a kid? No, we aren't getting back together. We are Morgan's parents, so we parent." He looked away, but his eyes met Steve's in the bathroom mirror. Steve's serious gaze pinned him in place, searching his own as if looking for an opening to peer inside. "You'd know that, if you came around more often than once a year."
His visits grew further and further apart. Tony knew a few years down the road Steve had gotten into some sort of support group and was working himself into the ground helping people cope with the new world they all found themselves in. Natasha, in coordination with FRIDAY, made a point of keeping Tony updated on major planet events, and apparently what Steve was doing with his life qualified. Tony never complained about the updates, of course, because the distance between him and Steve was a constant unrelenting ache. Even at night, exhausted from looking after his darling Morguna, sometimes Tony couldn't sleep, wondering
"Huh?" Tony said, eloquently. He'd already pegged Steve's reaction where it belonged, and it had not been in the getting-into-your-pants bucket. He had no idea what Steve wanted with him now.
Tony was going to let go of his hand, he was so obviously ready to step back, but Steve didn't let him. He used their clasped hands to pull Tony flush to himself instead, until Tony fell against his chest, his free hand rising to lay on Steve's shoulder for balance. Steve slid the other arm around his waist, holding him close. He still couldn't quite speak from the nerves, so they just looked at each other: Tony wide-eyed and startled, and Steve...he didn't know what expression was on his face, only that he wasn't letting go this time.
"—come save the world," Steve gasped out, and then he really had to stop and just breathe in and out for a while. It felt like asthma, this panic that squeezed his chest like a vice. "That's what you did."
"I don't hear any thunder." Steve also peered out. For a while, they watched the rain together. It struck hard against the top of the car, and Tony wasn't sure if he'd be able to sleep with the drumming noise. Eventually though, the April shower passed and left behind a sweet tang of fresh air and damp earth. The moon came out, nearly full. Neither of them was asleep, and Tony tried very hard not to let any of his inner confusion distort the comfort permeating the atmosphere. It almost felt like they were two friends, out camping. Not two Avengers on a desperate mission to rescue half the universe. Tony turned their improvised plan over and over in his head.
"Never said you were," Tony mumbled, drawing back physically, uncertain of his footing now. He thought he was comforting Steve, but looking into his eyes it felt like Tony was only causing him pain.
When he was done hacking up a lung, Steve let himself collapse down onto the ground, using the last remnants of his strength to roll onto his back. Tony flopped down next to him, equally spent. Their fingers almost but didn't quite touch.
"You went hustling," Tony said, wooden. He imagined the bar-scene: Steve hitting all the corners because he was good with angles, the locals getting frustrated. It was a setup for a bad fight. His voice was flat: "What is
Steve started talking, with some difficulty. His tongue felt heavy, and he had to blink to clear his vision, struggling to remain sitting upright. He told Tony about the Snap.
their way through, other people would get caught up in their escape. The chance of casualties was too high. He had to put on the suit.
"So... Amnesia?" Steve wanted that. That other world felt further away now, slipping out of his memories the way dreams did when you began to wake up. Tony being here with him felt right on a fundamental level. That gave him courage.
Sighing, Tony ran his fingers down to his chest where, hidden behind the t-shirt, the scars from Max's claw marks had healed, even if his heart would never heal completely. He rubbed the little puckered edges now and tried to put aside the thought of what Obie had to have done to friendly, lovable Max to get him to that edge.
Steve leaned against the doorway, while Tony examined the side of his face in the mirror. God, he hadn't really been sleeping much since Scott's visit had given him the final piece of the puzzle for the time traveling mechanism. The lack of sleep showed in the tired lines of his face; the last time he'd looked like this Morgan had been going through the terrible twos.
Steve looked startled and slightly confused. Hesitantly, he took his hand away. "You need to relax." He was whispering for no reason at all; there was nobody around for miles, only the sky and the stars to hear them.
"Then have mercy," Steve said with a curious mix of anger and hurt in his drawn voice. On anyone else, Tony would have called it pleading, but Steve didn't beg, even when he said 'please'. "Don't offer this only to pull away. You know how I feel about you, so don't do this to me."
"Change of plan: we make the jump now." Tony reached for the GPS device, but Steve's hand on his wrist stopped him.
Steve stared in silence for another moment, then his lips curved in a smile that felt...sweet. Endearingly, almost embarrassingly so. Heat came to Tony's cheeks, and he patted Steve's shoulder once, before letting go. His own reaction baffled him. He was thinking how nice Steve looked when he smiled, again. He thought that a lot. It wasn't as if Tony was unaware of the pull of attraction that lingered, ever-present, between them, but this was less that, and more a sense of belonging, come rushing back. As if Steve's troubles were his own again. As if, when he could make Steve smile, lighten the load a bit, then Tony's own heart felt less heavy and beat a little more easily.
Steve fought with his memory, before a fuzzy recollection of that evening surfaced. They'd been at an arms dealer conference; Tony couldn't bring his suit because of security concerns from the organizers. That's why Steve was accompanying him in the first place, acting as a sort of bodyguard. At least that was before they'd ended up chasing the bad guys through the underground tunnels beneath the town, ending up in this older section connected to the water system.
"Yeah, you sure could use a makeover. I'll go out in a bit, get you something to wear." And delay the inevitable: lying in the other bed listening to Steve fall asleep. The thought made him jittery.
"It's getting harder not to tell you all the reasons we shouldn't," Tony half-whined. He squeezed Steve's hand desperately. "Please. I can be convincing."
Tony had made the biggest production out of the proposal (lighting up the Empire State Building had been the least of it), and he'd been nervous to the point of shaking until Steve's equally affected and nervous yes. But after? They'd had a sort of post-engagement honeymoon period where everything was going so smoothly, and even their inevitable bickering disagreements had gotten softer and, well, loving somehow. They
Tony didn't meet anyone's eyes as he walked out of the Tower, trusting his shades to keep his face hidden from prying eyes. Besides, nobody would expect Tony Stark in the presence of a dog. His "dislike" of dogs was after all well documented. The most obvious sign of stress Tony allowed himself to exhibit was a tight clench on Fifi's leash. It wouldn't do to lose the dog in the City. But his anxieties about being yanked off his feet by his four-legged companion failed to materialize. Being that she was Pepper's dog, Fifi was of course well trained and walked calmly at his side, only sniffing the occasional fire hydrant or lamp post. Tony let her do her thing as long as he could keep his distance and not get involved.
Tony shifted in his spot where he'd zoned out for a moment, staring at nothing. "I'm fine," he blurted out. My, that water had been tasty. The smell of cooked beef made his stomach growl and the hunger pangs reminded him of other, worse times he didn't want to think about. "I'm not hungry," he said, to convince himself as much as Steve. He had to look away from Steve's probing gaze. "That's all of our money. Sadly, I neglected to wear more expensive jewelry I could pawn on our little trip. Unless you've got some?"
Hadn't they tested that already? When Steve had first come to him at his house (with Natasha and Scott, yes, but Tony only had eyes for him), Tony had said no and Steve had respected that. Tony could read his face, how much the answer had crushed him, but Steve didn't push, when it would have been so easy. That meant something. Steve let Tony choose. And in the end, given the freedom to stay away from the time heist, from the team, from Steve, Tony
"Cap," Rhodey said with a sigh, "That man loves you. The biggest truth I know is that he wants to marry the shit out of you. And he won't talk to me, he's just fibbing me off. FRIDAY says he refuses to see anyone 'until it wears off', which will not be tonight, according to Tony. So of course I called you. You can talk him down and get him to the reception." He said this with steady certainty. Steve hoped he was right.
"Cut the wire, huh?" Steve murmured, as if to himself. He looked up, piercing eyes focused on Tony, and for some reason more closed off than before. "I will, if you will."
"We should focus on getting back home." He pointlessly straightened the collar of Steve's shirt, wishing he could do more. "You just leave the rest to me."
"Shoulder. And it's better now," Steve said, almost smugly. Tony's blood pressure climbed and his eyes must have communicated his feelings because Steve sobered. "It's nothing. I was fine 'till the walk back. Anyway, we needed the money; it wasn't fair. You can't have to look after everything."
Steve added calmly, even as his hands clenched Buster's leash, "I swear, we don't bite." When Tony eyed him with skepticism, Steve had the gal to press his lips together, clearly trying to keep amusement off his face. Everything in Tony clamored to see that tiny quirk of lips become a full-blown smile. It would be beautiful.
"Don't go!" No doubt Tony could hear the fear in his voice, but Steve needed him here. If Tony left the room, Steve thought he would wake up from this dream. He
promise each other, except to fight on until their dying breath for the half of the universe that needed saving.
Steve's large hands closed around the glowing gauntlet on Tony's hand, collapsing to his knees right there before him as if called. Tony met his burning blue eyes. In the space of another second, an eternity existed between them. Steve's eyes were wet — that was all Tony was going to remember about that moment: not the terrifying power, not the firestorm he held in his hand. Just Steve and his beautiful eyes, looking right at Tony, as if they were talking. What were the things they were saying? Tony wanted to hear him say the words, just once. And he wanted to cry, to tell him
"You wielded the gauntlet," Steve whispered, refusing to open his eyes. What if he did, and Tony vanished? Steve didn't think he could survive the heartbreak, just then. It was a lie; he already knew he could get through anything, but he wanted to exist in this world, the fantasy, just a little longer. "Against Thanos."
, and he was allowed to be a little unnerved. He felt like this was the other shoe dropping, because everything had been too good to be true so far. Gathering his nerve, Steve kept his voice calm. "FRIDAY?"
Steve's eyes were welded to the spot where Tony's fingers wrapped around his. Tony squeezed once and hastily let go.
"Did you see that?" Tony said, maybe a little choked up, looking about at their safe, bright world. He still couldn't quite believe it. Around them, so many people were in various stages of post-battle celebration. They were chattering, laughing, maybe even laughing at the two old men, walking away from the battlefield, together.
"Tones," Rhodey's voice called at his back. And then a command, "Give them some space!" There was a little circle around him and Steve, both still kneeling in the dirt. Steve's face was wet.
. Sounds to me like your mind tried to twist everything for maximum imaginable pain. I can't even—This is a seriously fucked up dream. I'm so sorry you thought that was real."
Pepper looked at him, exasperated. "I promise you it won't be more than a half hour you have to watch her. Not even watch; just keep her company. You don't have to do anything, and you'd be doing me this huge favour." Wide and guileless blues again; he was such a sucker for them. "Natasha's usually spot on when I book her, but she had a family emergency. I gave her your number to call when she's coming up to take Fifi."
Pepper bent to kiss the dog's forehead, inducing Tony into the biggest eye-roll from all the way back behind his work table. She turned to leave, fingers rubbing the forehead spot on Fifi's head. "Be good."
Theirs was a relationship with a comfortable cadence to it. Tony reached out, Steve accepted; never the other way around. Steve was all about giving him time and space. Tony thought sometimes Steve was projecting his own needs on Tony, because Tony definitely didn't need as much space as Steve seemed to want to give him. Sometimes he was glad for the distance, because it meant he could control their encounters. Other times it only made Tony want to reach out even more. That always felt like risking too much: what if Steve wanted him to just
Then his mouth joined with Tony's mouth, right then and there on the battlefield, as Steve kissed him. Tony smiled against his lips and kissed back with everything he had, hungry for it. He had said he was going to believe him, later, when the war was over, but the truth was, deep in his heart, he believed that Steve loved him for a while. It was just that now they had a chance to do something about it. Tony had so many ideas for the future.
Already, it had occurred to Tony that he could fly back and take what they needed by force, before the order on the base was restored. Nothing in this decade could stand up to the power of his armor, not even close. He could crush any resistance, grab more of the vials and be out of there in twenty minutes, if necessary. But it would be hubris to expect zero casualties with a frontal attack. Besides, they would need more time for Steve to get better before they dared make the jump back.
Tony knelt down next to him, ignoring the protests of his scraped up knees. He propped himself up with one hand to lean over and peer at the sealed wound on Steve's shoulder. He'd done what he could while Steve had been unconscious, and thankfully it hadn't started bleeding again.
Even with Steve's attempt to soldier on, Tony wanted to fix this. But nothing he ever tried or said had truly made a difference to Steve. If they saved everyone with their absolutely insane plan, maybe then Steve could try to let the past go.
things like that. It was the past, bitter him, and he was tired of those corrosive feelings. He just wanted Steve to stick around. It came out sad and wrong.
The roar in Tony's head lessened by a fraction, a space opening up to feel another's hand that had been present on his own shoulder. Rhodey. Peter was there too, crashing into them from a wild swing, and lending them his strength. And more, more. Pepper. Thor. The raccoon that Tony remembered explaining, very sarcastically, how he had helped Quill contain the Power stone once, and now was doing it again, for the sake of his adopted world. Barnes made it to Steve's side, holding on tight to his other shoulder. Then it became a human chain, every Avenger, all the people Strange had brought to this battlefield to assemble on Steve's command, they were all connected. Every connection opened up space for Tony to keep on breathing.
Steve chuckled humorously. "Forget it." He twisted and tried to stretch, the space in the car clearly too cramped for his legs. With the car off and no artificial illumination, Tony could just pick him out from the little whispers of cloth against the seat and the faint outline of his chin, lit up only by the hazy moonlight. For a moment, the light vanished behind a passing cloud and Tony was irrationally afraid when it reappeared he'd find himself alone.
He'd had nightmares like this, after they first got together and he was undeniably happy. The moment his brain had accepted that this was serious, that Tony was here with him for real, Steve had started waking up  in cold sweat in the middle of the night after realistic-feeling dreams of being yanked out of time into another century, of being forced to wake up in a different world altogether, everyone being gone. His mind had conjured up scenarios of losing Tony and Tony losing him. It had been hard. Tony would spend more time with him on purpose, talk to him in the middle of the night, on very little sleep, just to let him get used to the new normal. Tony helped Steve relax into their relationship until he felt its undeniable truth down to his bones.
Steve chuckled and then groaned lightly when it jarred his wound. "Okay," he breathed out carefully through the nose. "Maybe you're right."
"This is it?" Steve looked with a bit of skepticism at the greenish-tinged liquid in a vial standing held up by a pair of metallic prongs on the table next to them.
Tony's hands stilled briefly and resumed their stroking. "That made it into your dream. Of course it did. You still feel guilty about it, huh?"
On the other side of this inadvertent prison, Tony was still peering into his face, studying him as if to determine if he'd be alright on his own again. The moonlight coming from the far-away opening was just enough for Steve to see the paleness of Tony's face. Tony was spending too much time worrying; he needed to act. Steve had to put aside his own fears and help Tony.
A soft, more somber look on Steve's face had Tony turning his eyes away, knowing he could deflect, wondering if he should.
Tony and Steve exchanged wide-eyed looks, reading each other's apprehension. "We gotta move," Steve said, and pushed Tony in the direction of the next truck. Tony ran ahead, crouching behind the second, bigger vehicle. Steve was a moment behind him. Tony's attention was split between the threat of many people with loaded guns and looking for a way out that didn't need Iron Man. Their new hiding place was close to the heavy wood and metal fence, that could get them out of sight long enough for some sort of plan to fall together. Of course, Tony had no hope of climbing the fence without his armor. He looked back the way they came. The path through the front gate was cut off. Even if they made it to their stolen car, they'd never drive through the check-point in one piece. And even if they
"God, that's messed up," Tony pronounced, staring off to the side at a wall as if it would yield answers. "You really scrambled your brain." He pulled Steve back against his chest. Steve didn't question why Tony was being so tender with him. It was clear that wherever he was, real or not, Tony and him had a very different relationship than the one he dreamt up.
"You wouldn't?" Steve found himself asking, somehow surprised how real the words sounded when spoken out-loud, and not only in his head. He didn't dare move lest he break this spell. Tony shook his head and silently nuzzled his cheek, as if that was his answer. Steve shivered, and not from the cold.
"Yes." Steve nodded eagerly, moving closer yet, until their breaths mingled. Tony's lips stretched in an answering smile; irrepressible.
"Then leave Fifi with your assistant." Tony turned to his work, attempting to ignore her. It didn't work. His amygdala was going haywire sounding the proximity alarm:
"Let me see," Tony pressed out, teeth clenching as he ripped at Steve's shirt to try to get to the wound. It was bleeding in sluggish spurts. The front of Tony's armor was entirely coloured a dark slippery red. They had to stop the bleeding or Steve was a dead man. The shot had been straight through. "I got this, I got this. You'll be okay." Barely keeping his hands from shaking, he applied the sealant from the armor to the wound. It'd saved him before, he could only hope it would do the same for Steve. With the sealant in place, the blood stopped flowing, but Tony was still supporting Steve on his feet.
"Cap showed me how," she said, matter-of-fact. Tony was going to have to stop using 'Cap' as an endearment, if his daughter was picking it up as Steve's actual name. "He was sad, but not ouch sad, but in here sad," she pointed to her heart, "and I asked him what made him happy, and he said you did, so I drawed him a picture, and he showed me how to make new clothes!" She pursed her lip and diligently showed Tony how the doll got its shirt clipped on, with little paper cut-outs wrapping around the borders of the doll.
Steve moved forward and clutched Tony to his chest, careful of his injured arm. It was nice. Tony let the armor melt away where Steve touched him, sinking into the warm embrace. He'd been hoping for more kissing, but—
you wouldn't have. You have the suit. You're faster and—" He swallowed roughly. "That's what scares me. If ever there's a choice and I—I won't be good enough to save you—"
A moment of silence lingered. "I know that," Tony whispered, just above the sound of running water. He yanked weakly at his wrist, and after another quick squeeze for reassurance, Steve forced himself to let go.
Steve lifted both hands in the air in a motion of surrender. "I'm sorry you feel that way." He was proud of himself for keeping that light and straightforward, and not at all like it stung. Tony didn't owe him every single thought or worry in his head. Steve was there for him if he wanted to share them though. "But if it is the truth serum—"
For a moment, when Tony opened his eyes, his eyes met Steve's and they were just the two of them. Two people transposed into another separate world together, one that was only theirs.
"Yeah, a good, big crane, buddy," Tony answered kindly, patting Steve's cheek. "Gonna work us a miracle here. You with me?"
kiss you!" Tony cried out from the side, his voice touched with both indignation and laughter, full of relief. He kicked his heel out at Steve's ankle, very lightly for all the rebuke in it, and for good measure, slapped at Steve's chest with the back of his palm. Tony's hand flopped there, lingering on top of Steve's chest, and rested, as if he didn't have the energy to move it away.
In all their times together, the sweetest thing that Tony ever called him was the flat nickname of Cap. Or maybe Mr. Rogers, in that playful tone of his — but that was all. Tony had never hugged him, never touched him with the kind of intimacy with which he was stroking Steve's hair now. He'd never lowered his face and pressed a soft kiss against Steve's mouth like that, murmuring, "Promise."
"Keeping it on for three years was sentimental." Logical, practical Pepper would approve of his decision, Tony knew with confidence. She'd stopped wearing hers years ago. But in the mirror Steve was giving him a look entirely out of proportion with the difficulty of the act for Tony, his expression gone somber and earnest.
"Knock yourself out." He waved a dismissive hand, setting it on his hip, and watched Steve indulge himself.
"Nevermind," he grumbled to himself, convinced this man was put on this Earth to stop him from getting a moment's peace. "Catch some Zs, we'll talk later." His eyes roamed the barn for any distraction, something to keep himself awake while he watched over Steve. If he stayed still for too long, he'd fall asleep standing up.
Tony thought back to a time when learning that Cap was willing to steal a car would have shocked him, back when he'd had Steve on the kind of pedestal nobody could live up to, back when Steve had struggled to live up to those expectations, before it all came crashing down. There was an aching sentimentality attached to the recollections of that other time, a world that was gone and swept away to live on only in their memories. But instead of making him sad, today the memories made Tony feel stronger, because, well, hadn't they made it this far?
, he thought with helpless frustration. Tony rubbed his bare arms. The nighttime brought with it a typical April chill and he was shivering.
Tony had told him to get a life plenty of times. He'd said it as a stinging insult during some of their earlier arguments — "You need a life, Rogers!" — and he'd said it seriously, once, after they'd had that conversation about retiring to a farm, to try to find the kind of peace Clint had found. Tony had looked at Steve and said, "Try living a little," and he'd smiled somewhat sadly, and never brought it up again as long as he lived.
Steve waited until he caught Tony's tormented eyes. "I'm glad you told me. And I still want to get married."
"Your uniform and shield." Tony shut the barn door and came closer, taking the shield out of the sheet that covered it and setting it next to Steve. Immediately, Steve ran his fingers across the Vibranium, as if checking the shield was real and whole.
"Still, though—" Tony mumbled against his mouth, kissing him and trying to talk at the same time. He'd thrown his leg over Steve's and was now basically in Steve's lap, sitting on top of the covers. "You dreamt I died?" Tony sounded curious, nibbling on the corner of Steve's mouth. His hands slid under the thin t-shirt Steve wore, stroking his back with soothing circles.
"I'll be fine," Steve said, looking and sounding tired. "You have to get back. To your family. Morgan." The last was barely audible. He leaned more of his weight on Tony, seemingly unaware he was doing it even as he listed to the side.
"Jeez," the blond said, when Tony finally extracted himself and stepped away — though not too far away. He allowed the helpful hand on his elbow to linger and side-eyed pleasantly surprising arms connected to that hand, noting the outline of muscle even through a frankly forgettable blue coat. His eyes slid over to the man's chest.
"I don't imagine all that different. Not everything's changed as much as you think," Steve said. "It's the little things that used to trip me up. But the rest..."
"Tony," Tony put in quietly. He turned to glance into Steve's unfairly gorgeous eyes, and had to stop trying to leave, hackles slowly lowering. He really was a sucker for pretty blues, and my, Steve's just beamed sincerity straight into Tony's heart.
"You died," Steve pressed past his lips just looking at him, unable to quite get his fill of the lines of Tony's face, his hair standing this way and that, no longer artfully tousled but just a mess, his dark eyes that Steve had never hoped to see lit up by the light of that bright intellect again. "We buried you. We
The moment passed in silence, Steve flipped the lid shut and put the compass away, sighing. He passed a tired hand over his eyes, but it wasn't to wipe away tears. Tony had never seen him cry, no matter what life threw at him.
"Mmm." Tony looked askance at the man, but Steve's eyes were still closed. His fingers moved vaguely, barely lifting off the ground. "Go. I'll be fine." Though quiet, the words were full of determination — a Captain taking charge of his own recovery. Tony watched the steady rise and fall of his chest, conflicted, then with a heart heavy from a maddening mixture of feelings, he went to do what had to be done.
All of Tony's anger — fear — vanished, as if swallowed up in the tidal wave of that realization. He stared at Steve for a long while. He'd known it, the moment he realized Steve was injured, that it didn't make sense. Now it played out in his head: how Steve would have had time to duck and chosen to plant himself like a tree and not move, so he could shield the man behind him. Absent his shield, he'd used his body.
with me—." Steve's voice broke, he breathed in shakily. His hand clutched Tony's fingers. "I'm not a saint."
All it was was a little touch, through the jacket, warming him up. At one point Steve straightened the collar, fingertips accidentally brushing Tony's neck. His touch was electrifying; Tony flinched back.
Standing among Zola's things, the research he would use to further Hydra's interests, Tony had a sudden wish to set fire to it all. But as they had seen with seemingly unconnected acts — Hulk taking the stairs in 2012 — the butterfly effect of everything that could result from their actions in this timeline was unpredictable. They had to stay focused.
real. This was undeniable. It couldn't be a hallucination. Unless Steve was still asleep? Drugged? Someone messing with him? But it didn't feel like a dream. Tony's mannerisms, his expressions, every hair-strand on his head and every dark eyelash were exactly as Steve remembered him.
Moments later, Iron Man was swooping over the fence, one armored hand still holding the briefcase with the Tesseract. The courtyard was in complete disarray. Smoke rose from one of the crushed gas pumps, and numerous soldiers were sandbagging it; they were lucky it hadn't blown sky-high. Tony spotted Howard splayed out against one of the cars, apparently unharmed, and Jarvis rushing to his aid. Steve was in a crouch with his back to them, so hopefully still with his secret identity intact.
At first, Steve had lain on the bed, on his side of the room, hands on his stomach, fingers intertwined, and staring motionlessly at the ceiling for a good while. Not asleep, but seemingly lost in thought. Preoccupied. Tony, too, had been distracted from his observations of Steve by the tech he was working on. The inducer would let them get to places they had to go.
The clerk looked Steve up and down. "What are you coming from: a kid's birthday party?" His eyes gleamed in that way a father's eyes gleam when he imagines inviting Cap to a birthday party for his own child, not that Tony's ever thought about it.
— and Steve clutched him to himself. If he was losing his goddamn mind and this was a dream, at least it was a good one.
Suddenly, he didn't care how much time they had to stick it out in the past, as long as Steve was okay. They'd make it through somehow; they always did. No matter what, so long as Steve was alive and with him, Tony could handle anything this century threw at him. He covered Steve's cold and clammy hand with his other palm, and squeezed back.
"Let me buy you coffee," Steve said. They both glanced down at the dogs that were watching the two of them with the look that faintly reminded Tony of parents watching precocious children. "We could find a place to sit outside. It's a gorgeous day." Steve looked around and actually breathed in a lungful, as if savouring it.
Tony looked down at their hands, and whispered, "I didn't want to tell you that I think you could be making a mistake marrying me."
"I guess?" Tony didn't pause the gentle stroking of the skin at the back of Steve's neck. Like scritches, the touch of his fingers soothed the raw edges of hurt. "You remember more than the last time you woke up, but it's jumbled. I think it's coming back, and your brain" — he waved a hand in the air— "extrapolated, filled in the gaps you didn't have with made up things of its own. Also, apparently? Your brain hates you."
The blond hunk was frowning at him. Tony wiggled a little so that he could get a foot out of the bind of the leashes he'd suddenly found himself in, while also keeping track of the sunglasses that threatened to fall off his head.
"Oh please." An eye-roll and Pepper started to tie the leash to one of the huge blue oxygen tanks by the wall, that was there for Reasons. "She'll just sit over here, won't you, darling." Patting the dog's head made Fifi squint her eyes in pleasure, butting her long nose into Pepper's hand, and no doubt leaving slobber all over. Tony shuddered.
, Tony thought. While Steve wasn't looking, he would switch the vials, giving Steve the original and keeping the duplicate for himself. Yeah, sure, this
Tony leaned in to kiss him once more, tenderly. He stepped back and composed his own hair a bit, pulled down his tux, then reached up to straighten the bow-tie on Steve's neck, and to pet Steve's hair back into shape. His brilliant dark eyes shone brightly as he took this time to compose himself while fixing what he could. Overwhelmed with affection, Steve contained any urges to ruin his careful work with more kissing, but it was a close call.
"Yeah, you're real ancient," Steve said with an amused lilt to his voice. He was taking off his coat and stuffing it under his head, like a pillow. Tony followed suit.
They walked back into the lobby together. "Stairs," Tony muttered low, hoping Steve's appearance would go unremarked. They weren't so lucky, however, and the desk clerk who had sold Tony their two-bed hotel room earlier did a double take. You didn't often see Captain America's doppelganger in full costume and shield stride into your no-frills hotel.
"You named your dog Buster?" Tony asked while looking at the dog, intending to segue into a gentle tease on how that was old fashioned, which never made it past his lips. The name must have set off some sort of a command in the dog's brain because it jumped up and then it leaped straight for Tony.
"You look fine, Tony. Is that the cover we're going with? Academic visitors to SHIELD science labs?" Steve had already picked the bed closest to the door, making the mattress sag heavily where he sat on the corner edge, elbows resting on his knees, and hands gripped together in front. His gleaming shield leaned against the side of the bed. He looked ready to defend the hotel room from an alien invasion and his somber gaze focused on Tony with intent.
"Never," Steve whispered fiercely, wrapping his arms around Tony's midriff. Steve's lips moved next to his ear, stirring. "Not as long as you'll have me."
"Better with you here," Steve said, turning fully, so his back was against the railing, and his arms were open.
He couldn't push the speed limit to the max with Steve in tow, as wind resistance threatened to rip Steve out of his arms, but he still pressed the edge of what he knew Steve could handle. It took a minute or two flying west to be certain they wouldn't be followed. Tony purposefully chose what seemed to be the less populated areas, where the chance of being spotted in the sky was lower. Steve hid his face from the wind by turning it into the juncture of the armor's neck.
Steve jerked as if electrocuted at the touch of Tony's mouth. Tony felt his flinch, started to pull back but no— If this
Twenty years ago he'd have been excited at the prospect of dog watching. Hell, he'd begged and pleaded Howard to get him a dog for long enough that his father had finally relented. A big Doberman, a man's dog, not one of those sissy poodles. Tony hadn't cared; he had only thought about playing, and petting, and running and having the best friend in the whole wide world. He had to leave Max behind whenever he went off to boarding school, but in the summers they were inseparable. At least for a while, until Obie took an interest in the wonderful workings of Tony's mind. Tony was still paying for therapy from that experience.
"Maybe lead the team again, with Nat?" Tony was mostly talking to himself at that point anyway. Steve was half asleep. "That made you happy, didn't it."
"I dropped them, Tony," Steve snagged his elbow. He was trying to catch Tony's eyes, but Tony could only look at the bruising all around the wound on Steve's shoulder, mind racing with potential complications. Blood clots, infections and nerve damage. "I've only got the one vial left." Steve tried to free one arm to go for the lone vial with Pym particles on his belt, but Tony hardly needed the suit to restrain him from moving too much. Steve struggled against him. "Tony! "
Clint, Hulk, Thor had all shown their pain and despair in a different way, yelling and arguing. Tony didn't know which one of them he was worried for the most. For himself, it was as if it wasn't true. Tony was numb, disbelieving of the idea that she could be gone, just like that, never to return. Angry arguments swirled; Hulk threw a deck bench into the lake.
," she said with the air of someone who was tired of explaining obvious things to adults. "Because it makes
He had his arms out in front of him to protect himself before he even knew what was happening. A second later, the logical part of his brain intruded, recognized Buster as a puppy who wanted to be petted, not a monster out to chew on his throat. Already at Tony's flinch back, Buster had let out a whine and plonked back down onto the grass, a foot away, staring askance at Tony with a slow wag of his tail on the ground. Tony lowered his hands, but by then it was already too late, and Steve had seen his whole ridiculous, comical overreaction. He was looking at Tony now with an expression of bewildered upset.
Then another pair of hands were grasping him around the chest, and he was pulled up, up out of the water until he surfaced with a big gasp. Tony was right next to him, grasping at his midriff, and yanking him up by whatever he could grab, by his shirt, and pulling him closer by the waist. They shuffled the remaining distance to the entrance of the tunnel, and dropped several feet over the edge into the reservoir of water with a big splash.
...what if he'd been smarter, better? What if there was a way to fix everything? With the planet, with the team, with him and Steve. He worked on Steve's shield to keep himself sane in between all the endless baby walks, naps, feedings, washings. It gave him a sense of purpose beyond being a Dad to prototype different styles of shields, measure their function, simulate how well they worked at knocking down bad guys. In the end he always came back to the original that seemed to fit Steve's fighting style best. Finally, when the shield lay completed in the garage, he would look at it sometimes and feel that same wistful ache, pulling at him like quicksand. He had tried to turn his thoughts away from looking for a solution, but couldn't stop himself.
"Hey, buddy?" Okay, so the anxious twist in his gut had nothing to do with the hot dogs. Steve either didn't hear or was too far down in his thoughts to respond. After another moment's hesitation, Tony gave in, pulling one hand from the steering wheel and set it on Steve's shoulder, shaking him lightly. "You falling asleep over there?" The feel of Steve's warm shoulder under the jacket was captivating; Tony's hand lingered.
"Are they ready?" Steve asked. He put out a hand for his duplicate vial. Even though his features were hidden by the image inducer, his hand was familiar, large, dry skin. Tony knew what it felt like in his own hand.
It was meant to be a joke, but Steve's gaze fell to his lap, where in one fist he clenched his compass, with Peggy's picture in it. "Doubt you'd get much for this," he said. His thumb stroked the shiny metal cover and Tony watched the play of emotion on his face. Steve caught his curious look, his lips curving in a self-deprecating manner. He went to shrug and immediately gasped as the movement tore through his wound. Steve's face drained of all colour and he swayed, crinkling the sandwich wrapper in a clenched fist as he propped himself up with both hands to stay upright. His brow furrowed against the pain.
In that moment, Steve heard splashing from the entrance of the tunnel and naturally thought he was imagining it. Then, with enormous relief, he recognized Tony, even in the near dark.
He became aware that Steve had never actually answered the question only then. Something like electricity sparked up his spine and he had to look away, searching desperately for something to break up the tension.
When they separated, Tony looked really and truly happy, perhaps the happiest Steve had seen him since the proposal had gone off without a hitch. It made Steve feel like maybe he could get this right.
from loving someone so much. He wanted everyone in the world to feel even a tiny bit as happy as he felt holding her in his arms. A minute later, Steve had flipped his Captain face on, and concluded his business in a formal manner, leaving promptly with a quiet, "I am happy for you, Tony."
Tony didn't look away from the screen. "You should see me when Morgan refuses to put on a warm jacket in the winter."
Steve didn't startle, but just turned slowly to blink at him. For some reason, Tony thought his eyes looked ancient today, as if all of his technical one hundred years was pressing down on Steve more heavily than usual. The question from yesterday stuck in Tony's throat, until he forced himself to cough it out, lightly, "You okay?" And then, because it felt like he didn't have the right, he carried on, "Is my driving boring you?" He just wanted something from Steve to go on.
Tony rushed up to set both hands on Steve's shoulders, pushing him to lie down on his side, back onto the makeshift bed of hay. "Rest," he said, low and unexpectedly angry again, but trying to keep it to himself. The anger rolled in his stomach, tangled up with worry, even as he worked to soften his voice for Steve's sake. Tony wasn't someone typically accused of gentleness, but he wanted to be gentle with Steve now. "We're not pawning your trinket." He curled one hand around Steve's fingers, curving them tighter around the memento.
"There's this one thing," Tony answered truthfully. Steve had a strong feeling that he wouldn't have said that if he could have held it back. That was disturbing.
Steve's blink back at him was sleepy-slow. He looked like he was a breath away from shutting his eyes and drifting off, and as Tony watched he blinked again in the same heavy-lidded fashion as he tried to keep his eyes open. Perhaps he was tired from talking; Tony could pick up the slack on that front.
Steve was in front of the mirror, straightening the black tux he would wear to the reception when he got the call from Rhodey. Rhodey was supposed to be with Tony, being his Best Man and all, so a smidgen of unease prickled at Steve's heart even before he answered the phone.
Tony waited, but Steve's voice petered out. "Hey, hey," Tony moved close, speaking softly, hands hovering above Steve's shoulder, biceps, before making the decision to settle with a light touch to the tips of his hair, hoping not to startle but to wake. The weakness passed and Steve opened his eyes again, resuming his answer.
There was a dull roar in Tony's ears. He waited a beat, somehow convinced that Steve was going to laugh and add: as a teammate. A friend. But all Steve did was lift a hand and stroke his cheek once with a thumb, so tenderly. "I do. Very much." His face was open, his touches were promises. Steve gave a thick swallow and Tony saw how hard he was trying to keep himself still and open, for Tony to take what he wanted. It was shaking through his frame, or maybe it was all the feelings pouring out of his eyes that kept holding Tony's gaze, and holding, holding.
"You don't remember it, but you admit I'm the best kisser." Tony whispered the last against his mouth, before ducking in to prove it, kissing him soundly. Best or not, the kiss was amazing. Steve felt enveloped by it. The brush of Tony's lips against his own, his questing tongue in Steve's mouth. All of it was new and all of it felt as familiar and as comfortable as if they'd been kissing for years.
Steve knew he might never see him again. He watched Tony scramble back out through the length of the tunnel, disappearing behind the corner and, it felt like, taking all the remaining light with him.
tired of not being able to help." He looked up at Tony with sadness shining in his blue eyes. "You always act like you don't need anyone."
What the hell was a Mungo Jerry? Was this how Steve felt in the future all the time? Tony had to get out of here.
Steve passed out on the way there. Tony very nearly panicked, but his suit sensors reported a steady heartbeat, and Steve's breathing was even when Tony hovered his bare cheek next to Steve's mouth to check. Tony had seen the serum perform enough miracles, he just hoped this time wasn't an exception.
Eyes glittering, Steve was studying his face and Tony hoped the dark was enough to cover his thoughts.
The battle-hardened edge faded from Pepper's eyes a little. "I know. Honestly, I wouldn't do this to you, but the dog-sitter is running late and I need to be on the plane to L.A. in"— she looked at the elegant rose-gold watch on her wrist —"fourty minutes, so Happy will already have to perform miracles with traffic."
Tony said nothing. He felt if he opened his mouth a torrent of words would pour out and there might be yelling. His eyes flicked to the small dark specs that soaked through Steve's clothing, above the wound, then he forced himself to focus on the way forward. He carefully led Steve inside the room, and locked the door shut behind them. "Let me see," he motioned to the injury with his chin, one arm around Steve's waist pushing him closer to the bed.
"Oh sheesh, are you okay?" The man grabbed his elbow to help Tony keep his balance. Tony barely managed to stop his sunglasses from falling off, before pushing them up to the top of his head and meeting the man's eyes. The guy was a bit taller than Tony, blond with the prettiest blue eyes, and a slight smudge of yellow paint right under his chiseled jaw that had apparently gone unnoticed. His brow was creased with sincere concern; his face was open. Tony was only conscious of that for a moment, the universe freezing as if they were caught in a still-frame, before reality reasserted itself.
Still, it was hard not to turn it over in his head. If Tony did get doused with a truth serum, as Rhodey had related, then why wouldn't Steve be his first phone call? At this point in their relationship, they didn't keep secrets from one another. Getting there was a long and winding road, but now they were solid. Steve knew Tony loved him. Rhodey was right that Tony had always seemed to want to marry him.
, the way Steve was looking at him. Tony spared another glance, taking his eyes off the relatively empty road. Steve's smile had faded to a faint cant of his mouth, but he wasn't looking away. As the sun finally rolled behind the horizon, its orange rays highlighted the chiseled features of the man next to him and turned his hair golden in a way Tony found unfair. Their eyes met and held. "Yeah?" Tony said, nonsensically.
"Some sort of latent trauma, probably," Tony waved a dismissive hand, tipping the sunglasses off his head down to his nose. "Exposure therapy will probably clear that all up. Listen, I have to get going—"
"People need saving, Cap," Tony reminded, with a shaky note in his voice, but made no other move. His breath came in short spasms, acutely obvious where their chests pressed against one another. Steve wasn't much better. He was so nervous he could hardly think straight, but somehow his voice came out okay when he asked, insistent:
Steve squeezed his hand and wanted to speak, but Tony was rushing ahead, talking very fast: "I'm a mess. Everyone knows that. And I—
He dropped what he was doing with the wrought iron door lock and came closer. Steve was lying on his back, on a makeshift bed of dry hay in a barn that Tony found out in the countryside. In his desperation, he'd kicked the door lock open before getting Steve settled, and was now in the process of patching it up, so that their presence wouldn't be discovered. The drafty, medium-sized barn stood on a dead-end turn in the back of a long row of oak trees, and the dust on the lock suggested infrequent use. Anyway, they wouldn't be staying long.
While Tony was distracted with endless, looping thoughts about what Steve had said, something in the engine cracked and an explosion of steam poured out through the openings in the front. Tony had to pull over to the side of the old road as the engine started to overheat. Steve stared at the dashboard like it personally offended him and didn't say a word. After a moment's silence, Tony sighed and got out of the car, walking to the front and popping the hood. A screwdriver and a wrench were two of the first shapes he'd taught his nanites to form, back when he was starting to experiment with the tech, even before he'd done something for the armor. So he was never without his tools. This time however, he could see the root-cause at a glance.
"I need to talk to Tony." Underneath the calm words his chest was squeezing painfully at the thought that under the effect of the truth serum, Tony didn't want to see him.
From the communications on base, he learned that Hank Pym had miniaturize and moved all of his research to an undisclosed location, so there was no hope of lifting a few more vials even if they made it down to the lower levels of the military bunker undetected. A rendering of Tony's face was on WANTED posters that were beginning to circulate, which significantly hampered his ability to withdraw money from the sparse ATMs in the city. He had managed to hack into a Stark family account on a single occasion for a sum he hoped would go unnoticed, and they subsisted on those funds since, including new, unbloodied, clothes for Steve, some materials Tony required for his work, and paying down the new hotel room. It hadn't seemed wise to remain in a rural location, where they would eventually be spotted and easily identified.
"The wedding is on track until you hear otherwise," Steve told him firmly before he hung up. His voice came out a lot steadier than he felt on the inside, but he tried not to give in to doubts. They could work this out.
At the blacked out door to the workshop, Steve paused, leaning his forehead against the glass for a second. Well, nothing for it. If his one-and-only had reservations about marrying him, it was better to lay them to rest now, rather than let them linger. Steve knocked lightly on the glass and called:
"Good God, Rogers," Tony sighed with heavy relief, in perfect summation of the dire peril they'd barely escaped from.
Tony lifted the fingers of his other, healthy hand to brush at the tear tracks on Steve's grimy face with his thumb. "Hey, you."
"You asked already." Tony gently tilted his chin up. "I love you," he said with confidence. "And you, Mister, are not getting rid of me so easily."
"I just need to be able to go outside," Steve glanced down at his Captain America suit in consternation. "It's Thursday, which means tomorrow is Friday, which means a whole bunch of soldiers will be doing their laundry in time for the weekend." Steve gave Tony a significant look.
he wanted Tony to keep going, to pierce that carefully constructed barrier he kept around himself and see the soft layers underneath. It did have to be soft, didn't it? Tony thought so. Tony thought if he ever touched Steve with intent, it would be softness all over.
Sensing defeat, Tony switched tracks, leaning back in his chair, tapping a pen against his lip. "Well, what's in it for me?"
Slowly, he shook the jacket out, and said, "Okay," pulling it on top of himself and shutting his eyes. "Good night, Tony." Just above a whisper.
He made it up the stairs in record time, even with the pounding headache. When he unlocked the door, Steve jumped up off the bed as if he had springs.
"I'm under the effects of the truth serum, you know," Steve murmured blissfully into his mouth, as they kissed some more and Tony's hands came up to sink into his hair. "Can't lie."
Steve smiled. It relaxed his features, made him look, if not younger, then far more approachable. Comfortable in his skin. Tony loved that look on him. That was probably why he went and spoiled the moment, blurting out, after a big gulp of air, "When I was a kid, like nine or so, I used to dream about it. Stealing one of Dad's cars and just...driving off. Never coming back."
They waited some more. Eventually, the green light announced the completion of synthesis, and Steve pushed the lever. The machine spit out the original vial, and a duplicate. Tony took both of them out of the dock and tried not to think about the ways things could go wrong, getting one of them stuck in the quantum realm forever.
"May I pet her?" Steve asked, with far more restraint than before when he'd been touching Tony, which just went to show.
Tony's Plan A had been to fly to Camp Lehigh at night as Iron Man, and pick up both items they needed, but Steve made a solid argument against unidentified flying objects over U.S. military bases in the middle of a Cold War. Tony agreed that their plan had to include not starting a nuclear war as a basic premise, so now they were onto Plan B: stealth. They could do stealth, right?
"Not a bad place to be." Tony peered into the dark and then drove a couple hundred feet before pulling off onto a poorly maintained off-shoot from the main road. They traveled another several minutes until all that was around in every direction was open fields and an occasional tree. He shut off the engine, and with it went the remaining light of the headlamps. The first smattering of rain hit the windshield and Tony rolled up the front windows, leaving the ones in the back rolled half-way down. That way they could have some air without being pelted in the face with the cold droplets of rain.
He flew on ahead, towards the Mad Titan. Things were happening faster than he could process now. With a part of his brain, he was still thinking about Morgan, about being a dad and about putting her to bed every night, and what kind of a world he would leave her. He was thinking about how unfair it was he'd never see her smile again. He was happy, dammit, he had a life, a family, a future. He could have Steve.
Steve's voice came soft from his side. "Remember what you said, about how we should have gone to Vormir?"
"I know," Tony said with simple certainty. "And I know there will always be more we could have prevented. Challenger. Others."
"I'm too old for this," he sighed as he pushed his seat back into a reclining position as far as it would go.
"You're here." Steve squeezed his eyes shut, butting his head into the crook of Tony's neck, shakily breathing in his scent. Tony's silky hair against his nose was the softest, most comforting sensation imaginable to bury himself in. It felt so real. Steve didn't know what to think. The last thing he remembered were vague snatches of a conversation with Sam. He was going back in time to Peggy, though Sam didn't know that yet. Bucky was saying his goodbye. Tony was dead. Yet, undeniably, Steve was holding him in his arms right now.
"Oh yeah! Heard about that," the clerk suddenly turned from incredulous to friendly. "Give'em hell, Cap!" And he gave a sloppy salute that had Steve pulling up an awkward smile in return. Everyone was a fan, Tony thought with an inner eye-roll. That was okay though; in the future, plenty of people liked Iron Man best.
Tony looked utterly confused. "How am I—You know what, I'm getting that doctor. This is the second time you—Hey!" Tony had moved to rise and do as promised, but Steve wouldn't let him. His hand hung on to Tony's shoulder keeping him firmly nearby, on the bed.
"It's true." He wanted to look into Tony's eyes even if they were angry at him once more. "You said... I lied to you."
. He just had to keep repeating it to himself, until the words sunk in. He looked over at the other man, only to watch Steve wipe his cheeks with his palms.
"Another but?" Steve's affectionate smile accompanying the words was like being basked in sun's rays.
Tony shooed Steve up the stairs before the conversation could turn any more detailed, as the Beatles crooned "Let It Be" from the small black radio behind the desk. They booked it up to the fourth floor — the climb made Tony woozy; Hulk little love tap had left his head throbbing — and Tony unlocked their room. It was a simple affair, two twin beds with a night table shoved in between them, flower curtains, kitschy wallpaper. Domestic.
with Steve? Sure, he talked about doing this together, but push came to shove and he had acted like he was on his own. Tony paced the length of the barn along the edge of the hay, once, twice. He hated to sit here and stew. "I need to make a run for food, and check on the situation we left behind." He needed to be
Only sheer luck had limited Steve's portrait and description to that of a generic blond male. Luck also held as far as his injury was concerned; it was healing nicely. The serum truly was a miracle: good became great, months of recuperation became days. Steve was walking, as long as he took it slow and didn't contort his upper body too much. A night's rest had done wonders for him; it had been good for Tony as well.
Steve shut his eyes, tilting his ear to hear better. Tony followed suit, and yeah, outside the barn the whistling wind sent the field and the leafery of oak trees around them whispering in a soothing chant. There came a faint rustle of Steve shifting next to him, settling in.
The air smelled of ozone promising rain and the lulling sound of tires on the old asphalt road counted off miles as they put New York behind them. Rays of the setting sun pierced the pink clouds where the road met the horizon and burned his retinas, making Tony's headache flare up worse. Tony attributed his rising nausea to that and maybe the questionable hot dogs from earlier. Their heating and A/C was broken. The chilly breeze through the rolled down windows only left him feeling clammy and unwell. After a bit of silent driving, he started skimming through the radio channels.
