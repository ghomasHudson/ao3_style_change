And it would be unfair of me to ask, given that. So instead, who was your favorite superhero growing up? And when did you know you were gay?
I’m so glad you’re not disappointed. For complete honesty though, I’m glad for two reasons. First, because I would hate for you to be sad about it.  But also,” Tony let out an audible gasp, “because I can’t stop thinking about you, about maybe meeting you, about kissing you. I know, that’s probably a little weird, since essentially we met online and for all we know you could be incredibly not attracted to me.  But I guess I just wanted to still have that possibility. Maybe when we graduate, when we’re ready to get out of here, we could meet up? See where it goes?
Rhodey reached out to shake his hands, something a bit like awe in his eyes, although a cynical glint gave away that he knew exactly why Tony was so interested.
“Tony, you’re so brilliant you take my breath away,” Steve said, open and true, so genuine and sincere it was painful for Tony to look at.  How could he just say it like that, make himself so vulnerable? Tony couldn’t say anything for a moment, swallowing hard.
He finds Steve on a rooftop.  It’s dark, a crescent moon barely lighting up the night sky.  He’s wearing the new uniform. He’s sitting on the edge, looking down at the streets below.  Tony knows Steve can hear his boots, the repulsors, but Steve doesn’t turn around. Stays with his unprotected back toward the suit.
I have great friends, and I had a great day today.  I almost wish you were one of my friends already, because they are all so great.  And I’ve been having that song from Capital Cities running through my head all day—‘One Minute More.’ So.” Tony took a deep breath.  “I think I might know who you are. Do you have a sister?
JustaShell: Someone else died.  And it should have been me.  It should have been me.  I’m the one who deserved it.  He died so I didn’t have to.  How do I live with that?
Steve shuddered.  Tony didn’t know what he was asking.  To watch the end of this.  Watch the light slowly burn away his dreams.
He wasn’t wrong, Tony thought.  On any counts.  He was so much better than Tony’s normal partners.  And Tony was happy.
“That’s Dr. Selvig’s volvo,” Tony told them.  “He’s sent me to get his briefcase out of it like half a dozen times just this month.”
They looked at each other for a second.  “Yeah, that’s really nice of you, Stark,” Pieter said for both of them.
Tony’s fingers fidgeted, the way they did when he was making rapid calculations or creating code.  “He said you’re enamored of me.”
He looked up, surprised.  Asking entrance? Pepper already gave him a code.  “What’ve you collected on the guy, Jarvis? Almost done?”
“Tony had to drop, already knew the whole curriculum,” Rhodey volunteered before Tony elbowed him in the ribs.  “Dude, Tony, it’s cool!”
Steve sat back, seeming to shrink in on himself, mouth tight. Then he shrugged, shook his head briefly.  “Nothing.  Nothing happened.  I was stupid, I misread some signals. We got our wires crossed.”
The table was set with perfect burgers.  Tomato slices, white onion, pickles.  Butter lettuce, not iceberg.  And a heap of crisp, salty oven fries.
Natasha handed out the index cards and Pepper drew a handful of pens from her purse.  Steve had an old fedora that he used to collect the cards.
Holy Hell.  Was Steve Rogers his email buddy? Tony tried to mentally tally all the things he knew about Steve and his mystery friend.  Senior? Check. Mom’s cookie recipe? Yep.  Batman, slightly weird parent situation, and best friend in another country… not so sure.  Actually, what did Tony know about Steve’s parents? Nothing, really. Tony’d never seen them. And he’d always assumed Sam was Steve’s best friend. They ran cross country together (Steve made Captain as a sophomore) and they were always hanging out.  But they’d both transferred into Shield High as freshmen, and he didn’t really know them before that.  He thought Steve had mentioned something about living in Brooklyn, and he was pretty sure Sam’s family was mostly in Virginia.  They’d just sort of had their own friendship going on, and gradually merged into part of Tony’s group too, when Rhodey and Sam started bonding over being in their words “The best-looking part of the track team” and Pepper had teamed up with Steve for their art project, two years running.  It was actually really impressive.  They collaborated on their planning and research, and then Pepper wrote the paper for her Art History class while Steve created the new piece based on their plans in Advanced Studio Art.
Steve sat up, still holding Tony’s hand, watched the light advance closer, desperately wanting to block out the sun, finally understanding Thanos’s desire to control the universe, if he could only turn back the clock on this one, live forever in this day.
At lunch, he brought his tray back to his office. Tony was a young CEO. A brilliant engineer, taking Stark Industries easily into the modern era.  He shored up contracts from the government, private companies. The weapons division grew, as it had under Howard.  He only had a single, thick file left when May came to collect him.
“In his third round of trainees,” she said, poised and collected. “Some brave woman in his second round reported him. Right before he flunked her out.  They wanted proof.  I’d made a reputation for myself—they sent me.” She kissed Bucky’s temple, removing her hands.  It wasn’t like they’d done any good anyway. He clearly already knew, based on his body language. “Nothing happened.  Not to me.  I wore a wire, got enough to make the case against him and got out.”
Tony was watching him closely.  He hoped J had gotten those files open.  He needed to know more.  “Waste of water, huh? Well, I will have you know, I just finished working on a prototype to filter almost a gallon a minute.  The water won’t be a problem.  And, you’re right.” That got Steve to look at him again.  “That was well done, Steve. Looks like you’ve definitely got a brain to match those muscles.”
“Jesus, what’s that smell?” Sam asked, clearly trying to figure out why Hammer reeked so strongly of sandalwood.  Bruce looked a little green around the edges, but he had what Tony recognized as his blandest smile plastered across his face.
Steve took his time, adding a second finger, relishing in the freedom to taste Tony, to be able to make love to him. He was going to make him feel so good.  He added a third finger, dripping lube, and Tony swore, pleaded with him.
Tomorrow, they will have brunch with Pepper and Rhodey and Natasha and Bucky. Rhodey will discreetly not mention how well Tony works with Steve in the kitchen, happy to chop tomatoes or move bacon to the paper towel lined racks as long as he’s standing close, as long as he gets that quiet smile from Rogers. Tomorrow Tony will explain the reactor, earning sympathetic admonitions from Pepper and Rhodey, curiosity from Natasha, and a gentle squeeze of his hand from Steve; he will, with Steve’s permission, explain Project Rebirth.  Tomorrow Pepper will have paperwork with her, already, to invest in and hire the consulting business that Natasha is creating with Bucky and Steve to prevent civilian casualties, reduce overall losses, and build better relationships with indigenous populations to preclude the necessity of military action (Bucky wants to call it Defensive Agency for Strategy, Hostility Inhibition, and Tact Support.  He pretends not to know what it spells.  Natasha has put the kybosh on that). Steve wants to bring on Sam Wilson, too, once he’s done with night classes.  Sam had said he’d spent so much time listening to people as a bartender, he just went ahead and enrolled as a psych major. Tomorrow Jarvis will make a note to send him a contract.
Pepper pulled out a wet wipe and passed it to Peggy, who scrubbed vigorously for a moment, making Steve’s skin pink and his eyebrow tousled.
. Vague enough that if someone else ended up seeing it they wouldn’t know it was about the glass in Obadiah’s outstretched hand.  Smart. Loyal. Tony’s heart ached a little thinking of Steve, knowing that Steve hadn’t betrayed him, wouldn’t betray him. “I know you think Miss Potts will be able to keep Stark Industries on this path of water filters and baby bottles, but… it’s hard to turn a ship that’s been going full steam ahead.  I think you’ll find she’s no match for me. Or you would, if you had more time.” Contempt filled his voice. For Tony.  For Pepper.
Fuck.  Rogers was just a little too observant for his own good.  But Tony knew that.  After all, Steve figured out Tony’s drive to stay sober after like a day.
Steve turned away from Tony, looked at the image.  Proof of his guilt. Of his love.  Same thing. He forced out a reply. “Yes.”
Tony winced.  He really did hate it when people called him that.  “Could you maybe just call me Tony, then?”
The next morning, before Tony’s alarm could go off, Howard had called, asked him what kind of idiot he thought he was, told him they weren’t there to solve the world’s problems, and hung up on him with a final warning not to waste his time.  Tony’d shoved the plan into a binder and hadn’t looked at it again until he came home from Afghanistan, the taste of dust bitter in his mouth. Howard had been wrong.  He had.  Tony repeated it to himself, over and over.  He owed it to the world, after creating the weapons, the Jericho, the Stingray.  He owed it to them to make it better.  Howard’s legacy would not be his.  It wouldn’t. That was a promise.
“Unpack.  Now.  Right after lunch.  The blueprints—those were good. You made them better. I already sent them to the production team.  You were totally right about the changes, although I’m not sure why you needed the greenhouse.  I mean, food gets shipped in, too. But I really should have thought about the extra school reinforcement. But no.  You, you stay.  I don’t release you.  You’re working for me. But what’s with the trees?”
“It’s true, huh? In the flesh.” Stark shook his head a little, clearing it.  “Jesus.  Dad would’ve been so proud.”
Tony swatted his ass fondly. “You like them funsize, huh, Cap?” he joked, thinking about how to fold a parachute down small enough that it wouldn’t inhibit her movement.
“What’d you think?” Coulson hadn’t dropped the mild tone but Steve could see genuine curiosity there.
Steve sighed again, heavy.  Well.  The therapist said it would help.  Actually, the therapist had stared at him for an hour.  Steve had just sat there.  He didn’t really have anything to say.  He had a lot of questions.  But he didn’t.  It didn’t feel right to just tell someone else everything.  His failures were his own to bear.  And he wasn’t sure what he needed to say to get reacquainted with the world.  Really he wasn’t sure he wanted to get reacquainted with the world.  It had gone on without him.  He was a relic of an age past.  Steve just wasn’t sure there was a place for him in this world.
Tony changed his passwords immediately. All of them.  He grabbed a snack from the kitchen, said hi to Jarvis and his mother, and locked himself in his room. He had an email.
(Mod)Wilson: Hey there, Cap.  That’s some good advice. We know what it feels like, to be left behind.  But if someone feels like you are worth saving, it’s a good place to start.  To make their faith in you real.
In his dreams, they died. They all died.  Erskine, Bucky, Peggy. His mother.  The Commandoes, all of them. He was drowning in corpses, the people he couldn’t save.  Over and over.
Steve unbuckled his seatbelt and got out of the car.  Then he turned around, one of the shop towels in hand, and started wiping down his seat.
“Nah,” Steve said, scratching the kitten behind his ears.  “You got him all wet is all.” Dear god, would this day never end? “I mean, with the bath.”
“Of course, Pepper,” Steve said, wondering vaguely how she managed the stairs in those heels. He already had a plan, anyway. A plan and a new friend in Sam Wilson, the bartender. Wilson was ex-Air Force, and fortuitously, someone that Steve’d met before on a mission outside Bagram.
“You are, hands down, the worst liar I’ve ever met,” Tony observed, without any real heat behind it.  It didn’t actually bother him.  It made sense.  Pepper had to hand down her knowledge to the next her, after all. Or, the next him? Her next him? Ugh.
“Here’s the thing, Cap,” Tony started, “you can stay if you want. But I don’t sleep the night through. And I might wake you up. And I twitch. A lot.  Pep couldn’t stand it.  Also, that one time, one of the armors tried to kill her—not her fault, not at all, so I’m sort of a health hazard. Not that you don’t know about health hazards, especially what with that killer caterpillars we just faced down, but what I’m saying is, you take your life in your hands with me.”
She nodded at him.  Then looked at Steve, gaze gentle. “Captain, no one will come to harm,” she reminded him, and his heart eased a little.
He stopped right in front of Tony.  Open gaze, clear eyes. Tony loved the determination he wore, the hope. It squished his heart, wrung it out.
“Alright, J.  Let the kid in.” He turned around to see Rogers push the door open, closing it behind him.  He hovered right in front of it, clearly unsure of himself.  It made the hackles rise on Tony’s neck.  He couldn’t be that disturbed by a little scarring, could he? He was in the army, for Christ’s sake.
Steve smiled, involuntarily.  “That was sort of weird for a pep talk, Buck.  But thanks.  I know you’re trying to help.”
He paused at the top of the stairs, but Tony’s door was already open.  He could hear swearing, too, now, and running water.  Well.  This could be bad.  He hesitated outside, a few scenarios running through his mind.  He tried to quickly rank them for likelihood of occurring and potential for embarrassment.
Loyalty.  Gotta like that. “Didn’t really think so.” Smiling internally, Tony popped another berry in his mouth.  “So, Steve? You got a last name?”
The front door was flung open.  Heavy footsteps came hurriedly toward the living room. Fuck, why was Obadiah back? Wanted another go at the reactor? Forgot his phone? Tony forced his eyes open, gasping. He didn’t have a lot of control, but Stane was going to have to look him in the eye. He let his eyes adjust, seeing the tall form enter the living room.
He couldn’t concentrate for the whole day, not that it mattered for his grades.  School was easy. But after school, there was still no reply.  Okay. No big deal.  Not a big deal at all.  Tony halfheartedly wrote a program to optimize routes for the school bus to get to school. He said he’d work on it for Principal Fury as part of his last detention.  It wasn’t difficult anyway, just needed to download the school maps and overlay one of his first game theory programs.  Basic choice stems.  There were a few odd outliers. Tony himself, not that he took the bus.  But the kids next door did.  Tony had offered to give them a ride once, but they’d just looked at him oddly. At first he didn’t even think they spoke English.  There was a housing complex on the north side that was oddly disconnected from the rest of the district by a golf course, but the kids there could all pile onto the same bus.  Steve Rogers lived out a fair ways, too, not all that close to anyone else.  Sam Wilson, maybe.  And then Natasha’s residence wasn’t listed, which was both weird and unsurprising at the same time, but Tony always picked her up at the same corner, three blocks after Rhodey’s house.  She didn’t need the bus.
Steve’s head was spinning, heart a pulpy mess.  Tony knew. He knew everything. And he was on Steve’s side.  A small silver lining on a disappointing day. Not Tony’s fault. People couldn’t change who they loved, after all.  Or who they didn’t, in this case. It was overwhelmingly good news, but Steve’s heart just couldn’t seem to keep up with the roller coaster it had been on. He didn’t know what to do with the news. With his freedom from Stern.
“Wondered where you’d got to,” Coulson remarked mildly, sounding as though he was leaning casually against the door frame.  He wasn’t.  He was perfectly, inoffensively formal.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replied, sounding enormously satisfied.  Obie and Barnes flinched at the voice. Natasha blinked rapidly.
“J.  Take a photo of this. Ask Pepper if we can put it in the hallway. Tell her Steve drew it so she’ll need to get clearance from him.”
Rhodey spun around a chair and draped himself over the back. “Yeah, man. Something about kidnapping a blonde giant? Or a giant kidnapper? I wasn’t a hundred percent sure I got what he meant.  I got that file he asked for, though.  Not a lot in it or anything. Not even a discharge photo. And I requisitioned everything. Hey, botface.  You been taking care of my boy?” Dum-E rolled over inquisitively.
“With pleasure,” Clint responded, looking positively gleeful at the opportunity to finally shoot Loki.
Peggy had hand-selected and blended a batch of teas for Bruce, and Bruce had designed a flight simulator program for Rhodey to use on his Xbox, still a point of contention for Tony.  Rhodey shamefacedly admitted to being the weak link this year. He bought a batch of throwing knives off of Amazon for Natasha (“But I spent hours searching for the right ones!” he claimed, “And that should count for something!”).  She still looked pleased, polishing them surreptitiously on her sleeve.
Over dinner, Tony helped Rhodey walk the line of what he could tell the senate committee without giving away any brand secrets. He was focused, but Rhodey was his oldest friend.
“I’m pretty sure something happened with the fall out from Loki.  You know how he can be.” Steve considered feeling bad for maligning Thor’s brother for a moment, but given the amount of havoc Loki’d put them through just this past week alone, he didn’t actually feel guilty.
Steve rode out of Manhattan, watching the sun go down, the wind bracing on his skin, whipping brisk around his face. This was worse than the ice.  This time he’d done it to himself knowingly, it was all on him. This time he had to live through it, instead of waking up after.  He wondered how long it would take, this time, to get to
Tony had never felt more powerless in his entire life.  He was literally powerless, incapable of moving.  He couldn’t do anything.  He couldn’t protect Pepper, or Steve, he couldn’t stop Obadiah. And God, that hurt. He’d trusted him.  The man had been like an uncle more than a business partner. He had been on the very short list of people that Tony thought he could rely on.  But Obadiah was wrong about Pepper.  If Pepper knew he was trying to get control of the company, she could flay him alive in a board meeting while still wearing her stilettos and not getting a drop of blood on her pencil skirt. She knew the SI better than anyone, including Stane.  Or Tony.  It was just a matter of her not being blindsided, like he’d been.
Tony was just wrapping up a modification to Butterfingers’s retrieval code when Rhodey came in through the garage elevator, bypassing the entry system entirely.  He looked exhausted, still in uniform and carrying a thin sheaf of papers.
“We won,” Steve said, smiling wryly, disbelieving—and still, somehow, sad.  He was close enough to touch.
He slept uneasily, dreams haunting him, claiming him.  It was always that same damn mission.  How had it gone so bad? In his dreams, the faces of his men haunted him. Bucky blamed him, angrily. He dropped Bucky, over and over again. The concussions from the explosion ripped through his body, he could feel the impact of hitting the ground, his vision a wreck of crimson and silver, minute grains of sand scoring into his eyelids, rasping at his face, the hot metallic smell of Bucky’s blood on his hands, the way it seeped into the sand, dragging his life beneath the dust, disappearing on contact. The tourniquet cutting into Steve’s own hands as he tied it around the stump of his best friend’s arm, praying that he’d survive long enough to be pissed about it. The limp drag of Bucky’s body, the civilian child wailing on Steve’s shoulder. His uniform had been soaked in blood—sweat, too, and tears—but the blood left streaks down his chest, painting him, proclaiming his guilt.
Steve was both humiliated and turned on, more images of Tony flooding his mind, unbidden, short white vinyl skirt hiding nothing.  Humiliation won quickly though, and he flushed, looking at the floor.
After he burned through one bag, after he’d gone through his paces in the gym, he showered and returned to his office. The files were still sitting in a neat pile on his desk. He’d been Fury’s good boy all along, never fighting, not a rebellious move.  He took Stark’s last file and slipped it under his leather jacket.  He’d finish reading it at home.
A twig snapped, to his right.  Tony’s breath caught. He willed himself away from hope.  It could be a stranger.  A cop.  A stray dog.
Hammer straightened his tie, the prick. “Woah, Tony, no need to get so hostile!” He smoothed down his lapels.  “Look.  You’re friends with the new girl. She’s hot.  So…” he let his voice taper off, a thick layer of slime trailing in its wake.
He could hear Tony saying almost the same thing, in the car on the way to mini golf.  But, he’d meant it generally, he was just being nice. He’d said himself that he was straight. Steve told the others as much.
Steve stood in his room, watching the sun go down.  This was worse than the ice.  This time he’d done it to himself knowingly, it was all on him. This time he had to live through it, instead of waking up after.  He wondered how long it would take, this time, to get to
Natasha looked surprised.  “He said that? He said, ‘Steve, I only have sex with people who have vaginas?’”
Tony could hear the frantic thread in his voice, the pleading.  He remembered the blown out, drained, lonely look on Steve’s face when he’d brought him water. He’d been devastated, guilty, those events weighed on him, preyed on him.
This was a little weird.  Weird wasn’t really good for data though. Hard to quantify the effects of the apple if “weird” was all he had to go on.
.  He picked up the cap from where she’d tossed it, schooling his face into a friendly, flippant demeanor before he turned back to her.  “Going to get me a date with another Mets fan?” he asked, grin clear in his voice.
“Just, tell me what you see.” He held his breath.  Maybe he had been wrong.  Maybe this was something else entirely.  He could have been overly suspicious, overly protective, like Bucky was always saying that he was.
God it was so good to hear his voice. He sounded tired, but Steve had never been so relieved.  “Tony, I’m so glad I got ahold of you!”
Steve put away the last dishes and picked up the set of forgotten blueprints to set them aside, take them to Mr. Stark’s office after he wiped down the counters.  They were clearly the same structures that had been displayed in Mr. Stark’s workshop today.  The same water distribution systems and restroom facilities.  The same kitchen stations. The same fence.  Now, looking more carefully at it, Steve could clearly see the design layout as a refugee camp.  The logic and design was beautiful.  The thought process behind the placement of facilities that ran on generators, that provided hot water.  He traced the lines with the tips of his fingers.
The bell pinged as Rhodey held the door open for Tony, sweeping his arm in front of him as if Tony were a princess.
“Alright, J.  Do what you gotta do. Relay the information to Pepper.  Get legal on it.  I want ground broken on those wells by next Friday, you got it?”
Tony was lying on his bed, fiddling with a panel of resistors.  Just before Thanksgiving break, Natasha had edited Hammer’s English paper for him.  Of course, she’d also taken a look at Tony’s, adding a number of snarky notes on his analysis of “Daddy Issues in
“Tony,” Steve said, gently. He tipped up his chin so Tony would look at him.  “Tony, I didn’t have any symptoms. Because I always feel that way about you.  I’m always in love with you.”
Sooner or later, Tony came to his senses.  Lying in bed, warm, he stared at the ceiling for an hour.  Realized Steve could do better. He’d been selfish. But Steve, Steve was acclimated now, to the present. And wasn’t that what being with Tony was all about, anyway? Getting used to the bright lights and the speed with which the modern world moved?  It was about time he moved on.  Better to do it now, before he truly broke Tony’s heart.  Before Tony was so far gone he couldn’t recover from it.
“Yeah, Clint just dropped it off on his way back,” Steve replied, although he didn’t turn it over.  “I wouldn’t worry about it right now.  We should work on the mask.”
Tony could see the intelligence, the determination, even in the tiny frame.  Like it was fighting to get out, just waiting for a body that could accommodate that much resolve.
“That was easy,” he muttered under his breath to no one. Taking off his safety glasses, he ducked under the accelerator and sat down at the worktable.  He examined the glowing triangle.  It looked stable. He grabbed a pair of needle nose pliers.
Maybe that’s what she’d meant.  He’d be the only one to get hurt. He’d know truly what he couldn’t have, and it would have all been a dream.  He looked at Njorun, pleading written across his face, but she just smiled at him.
Bucky opened the cabinet, noticed how the mugs were all aligned but didn’t say anything.  He poured himself another cup of coffee, slowly stirring in about a quarter cup of sugar.
Steve felt something loosen a little. He missed that.  Having people that he could share a joke with.  Having people he could talk to.  He could trust.
Steve dismissed the team, reminding Natasha to pick up extra chili sauce for Tony’s drunken noodles. He grabbed Tony on his way out to talk about the filtration systems.
Natasha’s reaction was so steady.  He could trust her.  He could.  He hadn’t known her that long, but she would keep his secrets.
He pushed open the door.  And found Steve.  Without the top half of his costume, pushed up against the wall by… Lorraine? Her hands were halfway down his pants and her tongue was more in his mouth than in hers, her corset completely unhooked and dangling from Steve’s hand.
“I’m sure this isn’t anything like what you normally get, Mr. Stark,” Steve began apologetically.  Then he added, “But, then, you live in Manhattan, so you probably don’t know the real thing anyway.  You wanna knife and fork with that?” The look he turned on Tony was pure innocence.
“They were actually something I was going to send to Cho, to help her with fabricating tissue,” Tony said, frowning. “But you’re right.  That’s a good application. Rogers,” he said, turning, “you make me feel like maybe I’m not that much more genius than the rest of the world.”
“Well, you had the pizza oven… I mean, it’s just, Jarvis said,” Steve struggled.  He stopped himself. Focused. “You had a pizza oven, and Jarvis said you liked pizza.  You had all the ingredients.” He didn’t seem sure if he should be embarrassed or not, and appeared to be erring on the side of embarrassed.
A large hand moved in front of his face and his phone was plucked from his grasp.  He could hear Steve saying his name again and again. Then a spotless, smooth finger hit the end-call button and the phone was tossed to the floor, an Italian leather shoe crushing it under its heel. Shit.
He brings the soup over to Steve, who can’t exactly feed himself in those restraints.  He spoons some up for him. “I could just take them off, you know.”
“That’s what I figured.  Could you freeze the frame when Batroc is speaking to his secretary? And, could you enhance the audio in the background?”
Apparently Romeo had decided he was going to sleep in Steve’s room.  He’d emerged from a nap and playtime bow-free, but extremely fluffy.  When Steve stood up and said he thought he’d hit the sack, Romeo trotted along at his heels.  Steve was a little disconcerted.  He’d never had a pet, and he wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do with him.  Still, Steve’s bed was huge so there was plenty of room.
“Sir would probably appreciate a sandwich for lunch, if you were so inclined. The kitchen is this way,” Jarvis indicated. And now, Jarvis might be artificial, but Steve was definitely sure the voice was slightly amused again.  But he followed gamely along.  After all, this was his mess to clean up.  He could at least start by making Mr. Stark a sandwich.
“I know you always put us first, Tony, but you should relax tonight.  You’ve earned it,” Steve told him earnestly.  “I’ll help you sketch it out tomorrow if you want.  I mean, I know it’s not a lot of help to do it the archaic way, but anything I can do.”
Steve couldn’t get his nerves to calm, deciding instead to start again on that email chain.  He continued sifting through different files and attachments, downloading them to his phone so he could move into the kitchen, where Tony was most likely to show up.  He archived one chain, starting on another.  It looked promising, communication between someone named Raza and a seller who called himself Iron Monger  from about a year and a half ago, just before the weapons started disappearing.  He had just downloaded a copy of their video call when Tony came up the stairs.
It was impossible not to read the last paragraph in a sarcastic, teasing tone.  Still, Tony didn’t mind.  Flying basically said he had a crush on him, on Tony, and Tony would definitely take that.
Very gently, she took his face in her right hand and brought his eyes to look at her.  She slid the left hand toward him, then drew it up to interlace with his fingers that were holding his shirt.  “Whenever you’re ready,” she said, clear and low. She kissed him.  “I’ll never walk out on you.” A plain gold band glinted on the table.
Right on schedule, Tony heard Steve’s footsteps coming down the staircase.  A quick conversation with someone, and then Steve appeared outside the door, perusing a paper file.  He closed it, entered his code, and strolled in.  It was quite a balancing act, since he’d brought his sketchbook, the file, two coffees, and had to enter his code.  Tony thought maybe he should write in an auto-open code for Steve.  After all, he was down here almost as much as Tony, and he usually carried in whatever Tony hadn’t wanted to pick up.
“I didn’t have the right recipe?” Steve asked, guilelessly. “The internet is amazing, but it has so many recipes, it’s hard to figure out which one to use.”
He placed both their clubs on the return counter and stretched, shirt riding up, and Tony had an overwhelming desire to lick the golden skin, fingertips working their way into his waistband, popping the button.  He stifled the urge quickly.
Tony drove to the party. He could catch an uber home.  Although, if he was being honest with himself, he was hoping he might be able to make out with Steve until tomorrow.
“Okay, well, maybe not quite as smart,” Steve amended. “So, I’m holding a chem study group after school Friday.  I mean it’s no
“If that’s what you want.” Steve shifts so he’s looking Tony in the eye and tries a grin.  “I’ll wait for your batsignal.”
Steve made his way down to the workshop, then knocked politely on the glass. He could see Mr. Stark inside, work gloves on, soldering gun smoking.  A robot arm held a piece of metal and another seemed to be holding a watering can. Steve waited for a minute.  But Mr. Stark appeared not to have heard.  He knocked again, a little louder.  Still nothing.
“Now with you gone, Stark Industries can get back to doing what it’s best at.  Making weapons that will help steer the world back on course.  With the balance of power in our hands.  The right hands.” He was holding the sketch of himself, examining the shading. And then Tony saw it, Steve’s neat letters.
Finally, he set down the book in the kitchen, next to the coffee maker.  It was almost morning. Dawn stretched rosy gold rays over the tips of skyscrapers, painting their high edges, lightening the sky, alleviating the mystery enshrouding the city.
He woke up hours later.  Dark again outside.  Tony wandered out to his kitchen aimlessly.  There wasn’t anything there when he left, no reason to think anything would be now.
Steve blushes.  It travels down his chest still.  “I thought it was something no one would expect from Captain America.  It’s so…”
“I… I didn’t make it.  I had a doctor’s appointment suddenly, sort of an experimental treatment.” His eyes were searching Tony’s, looking for something, seemingly. Whatever it was, Tony didn’t know what to give him, although he would have if he could. He’d probably give anything, at this point.
“Tony, you said… You said we have to be better.  That we exist to save lives.  That we fight to make sure that no one is above the law, not even us.  You were going to kill him.”
could be like Steve, at least a little more.  He brushed off Steve’s thanks glibly, but he could hear the wonder in his voice.
, he thought.  It was perfect. A small thing.  At least his AI took care of him. He set down the mug on the bedside table, stripped off his pants, and made his way toward the shower. On his way through the bathroom, he caught a glimpse of the dimming arc reactor in the mirror, sunlight filtering through the window to bounce harmlessly off the metal, providing almost equal brilliance to the false heart in his chest.  Maybe more like a month.
A couple strolled over the river, holding hands. They stopped and kissed in the moonlight before they continued away from him.  He pulled his jacket closer.  It had only been twenty minutes.  If Flying needed more time, well, Tony had said.  He checked ShieldSpies. A video of him was up.  Good quality, and it got the whole speech.  Natasha. Must be.  She had an uncanny ability to know his moves.  Comments shot back and forth, on the whole positive. More than he would have thought.  He watched the comments roll in, checked the time on his phone again.
For a second, Bucky sat, stunned.  Steve didn’t want to breathe.  He didn’t want to break the moment. Then Bucky lunged for Natasha, hand tangled in her hair, mouth on hers, bending down so much she was angled backward. He tipped her back, lifting her on to the kitchen table, pinning her down.
disinherit him, disown him.  His mother probably wouldn’t have a heart attack, but she wouldn’t stand up for him, either.  What were his options?  If Howard kicked him out, he could probably couch surf with Rhodey and Pepper until he could get on his own feet.  He just needed to start saving up some capital of his own, squirreling it away so that he’d have it when he needed it.  And pull his work off of the SI servers, so that he could patent it to himself and sell it, rather than just letting Howard market it as his own work.  Okay.  He could make that happen in… if things went right, if he worked hard at it, maybe a month or so.  Just so he’d land on his feet.
“You always catch me,” Steve says. “Caught me,” he corrects himself. He looks watery at the edges.  Then he pulls himself together.  “Anyway.  No team.” He gives what he thinks is his patented “I’m fine” grin.  It isn’t.
Tony closed the door.  Ugh.  Where had he gone so wrong? He’d only seen what he wanted to see.  After all, how many guys had had a friend move away? How many guys didn’t want to disappoint their parents? Basically everyone, on some level.  Even Tony, himself, to some extent.  And who didn’t love Batman? He’d heard Clint go on a rant that lasted the entire lunch period about how Batman was way better than any other superhero, and his entire thesis was that “he could shoot better.” Not only inaccurate, but extremely long-winded.
Tony paused.  “That’s a good idea.  He’s already helped out with SI France.”  Rhodey’s eyebrows shot up comically high, making Tony snort.  “I’ll have him start working on it tomorrow.  Can’t hurt, right?”
“Mr. Batroc, it’s important to Mr. Stark that the regulations are cleared and paperwork is signed before Monday,” Steve said.  “The accords have to be signed by the Communications Minister in order for us to start distribution. I’m not really sure what’s involved, but do you think you could get those signed by Friday night? I’m sure Mr. Stark would really appreciate it.”
Tony wandered through the crowd, trying to psych himself up.  How would he tell Steve it was him? “Hey, Steve.  I’m Shell.” That did not sound right.  “Steve.  Hey, it’s me, I’m Shell.  Steve.  You’re Flying.” Oh God, it just got worse. Finally he just got himself together.  He scanned the party, some shitty pop song telling him to ball up, but Steve wasn’t there.  But he’d heard them talking about how often Steve crashed at Sam’s place. He always stayed in the corner room.  Okay. Okay, he could do this.  He was Tony Stark.
Tony could feel Steve tense.  Were the tall blondies having some sort of argument? Who argued with America’s Golden Boy? Tony excepted, anyway.  For that matter, who argued with a literal demigod? Tony had always thought Thor was one of the most laid-back of all of them. Give the man a beer and some Super Smash Bros (it was the hammer, obviously, he loved the hammer) and he was happy.
“That’s quite alright, Mr. Rogers.  I am modeled after someone who did grow up in London.  I, myself, being an AI system, have not had a traditional childhood as such.”
Steve weighed the odds.  Tony wouldn’t thank Steve for breaking in and disrupting the mood if he had a guest in there, and Steve really didn’t want to walk in on him with someone else.  The thought of it physically pained him, although Tony could have anyone he wanted, and Steve really needed to face up to facts.  On the other hand, if he was under attack, he sounded like he could use some help.  And if it was just music, well, he could take the opportunity to tease Steve some more. He sort of liked having that, anyway, it was like having an inside joke with him.  Yep, he was fully aware of just how pathetic that sounded.
Stomach acid threatened his throat, he was going to vomit if he kept thinking about Hammer. He turned up the volume on Netflix and tried to block out the world, pulling the blanket over his head.  Somewhere around episode three, he drifted off. When he woke it was dark. Netflix had long-since paused. “Are you still watching?” No.  He didn’t even remember what he’d been watching in the first place.  He dragged himself to the kitchen. There was coffee, a yogurt he didn’t remember buying and a frozen burrito.  He ate the yogurt, microwaved the burrito.  It tasted a little freezer-burned, but he didn’t really care.  He bypassed the coffee entirely. Didn’t even want it. Tony checked his email again.  Nearly 10pm and still nothing.
Tony wasn’t sure he’d be back. But it wasn’t like he really needed another PA for much longer, anyway. Stop being maudlin, he told himself, and get back to work.
Steve snapped his mouth shut. He felt like he should say that he knew that, but… the Tony Stark he knew from the press, from the weapons he’d had pointed at him, from his experience with Howard…
Tony squinted at the file Rhodey produced.  “I don’t recognize that, but it also doesn’t look like my tenure.  That’s more Howard’s design, but… This little squiggly thing… Can I have this?”
Tony was watching the road, driving cautiously.  Thinking about Flying’s last email. They’d been emailing for weeks now.  And Tony knew so much about him—he wasn’t really into cars but wanted to save up money for a motorcycle.  He wanted intensely to get scholarships to go to school so it didn’t end up costing his family.  He’d taken the SAT three times to make sure he scored over 1500. He played a sport, liked reading, and couldn’t stand country music.  He loved Harry Potter and hated the Divergent series.  He missed his best friend so badly it hurt, and the guy had never sent a forwarding address.  He was funny, and smart.  He played chess but wasn’t on the chess team. He was fundamentally kind, good, like Sam.  He cried watching Up, wondering if he’d ever find that kind of love.  He knew everything about this guy except what he looked like.  Tony had tried picturing him, but it never worked.
So two out of five.  That wasn’t great odds.  How could he ask about another best friend or parents without being super awkward? On the other hand, Steve Goddamn Rogers---that was like Tony’s wet dream. Actually, it was one of his literal wet dreams, not that he felt like admitting it.  Do Not Think About That Dream. Tony refused to get a boner while Hammer was in the room.  Besides, he’d be mortified.  What if it wasn’t Steve?
Tony bubbled with pride. “No, I included it in the analysis portion, because it was endemic to the rest of the issues, and I led with it in the opening,” Tony countered.
“Shit, Steve, Obie’s coming back, he’s here to find my body; he has some sort of weapon, like a sonically powered taser or something, it paralyzed me.” They didn’t have any time, the footsteps were almost in the room.
“No apologies, Rogers, I’m a remarkably sexy man,” Tony said in the same teasing tone. “Is it, is it just a crush? You’re smitten by the lifestyle? Midlife sexuality crisis?”
“Right.  Well.  Well done, team,” Tony cheered, glancing around.  “Let’s all call in sick tomorrow.  I have something I need to do.” He could see the glint of Steve’s hair twist as he turned back to Tony, caught the hope in his eye. Maybe Tony hadn’t been sure, until then.  But now he was.  A committed Steve Rogers was unstoppable, immovable. The man had rescued his friend from behind enemy lines, against orders, with a parachute and a shield.  He’d fought against a force he had no hope of defeating, holding the line with his hands and his sheer will. He put down a ship in the Atlantic. He’d be there, when Tony was done.
He pulled Steve aside for a moment and the rest of them tried not to overhear too clearly.  Peggy headed back inside to grab her notebooks and leave the Neosporin and ruined shirt. Tony couldn’t make out many of the words, but thought he caught “proud” and “son” and “good.”  That cut a little close to home. It stung, really.  He blinked and tried to think of happy things.  Murdock filing paperwork next week, being finally so close to being free. The way Hammer had too much pressure from upcoming finals to harass Tony too much.  Flying, and the way that he did seem to like Tony, too.  He blinked again, and then his treacherous brain—
“Flying, No.  I really haven’t.  Ever.  Like I said, I don’t think my friends would care that much. They’re really the best.  But I don’t think my family would take it as well.  That would be a real blow to my family, especially my dad.  It’s hard to think that I wouldn’t live up to his expectations. That he’d be disappointed in me. Again. What about your parents? –Shell”
Tyranny? What tyranny? He’d never even seen these two. “Um, well, according to this a-hole’s accounting, about $850,000,” Tony interjected.  But seeing blondie’s crushed gaze, he added, “But it’s also priceless.”
“Nope, no apologies.  No thanks.  I was just making my rounds, realized I hadn’t done the proper host thing of putting champagne and fruit baskets in the rooms of all my guests, figured I’d make up for it with, well, water and ritz.  But, you know, ritz! They’re ritzy! Only the best for oh holy god, Rhodey’s wearing off on me. This is the end, I’ll have you know.  The end.” Tony strolled casually over to Steve’s bed and handed him the water and looked at him expectantly.  Steve drained the entire glass. “Now, I normally would say no crumbs in the bed, but it’s a special occasion.  You’ve been working for me for three weeks—twenty-one whole days!.  That’s the longest I’ve ever had a PA, besides Pepper. We should celebrate! This is only the beginning.  Tomorrow, after the thing, we’ll go do something fun.”
“I know, Mr. Stark. I wanted to talk to your new assistant. Captain Rogers, was it? Tall and blond.  Kinda hot, if you… go for that kind of thing. No judging! You and I, we’re better than movie stars, you know.  We’ve got power and prestige.” The leer was clear in Stern’s voice as he spoke to Tony as if they were part of some boys’ club, a frat Stern had clearly never grown out of, trying to build bonds over a mutual abuse of power. “We can do anything.”
He entered the room and turned on the light.  The one-armed man was lounging on a filing cabinet, but Tony recognized bravado when he saw it.  Years of practice in perfecting just that air of not giving a shit.  Tony scanned him. Missing arm. Remnants of a tattoo on his shoulder.  Loose hair, falling out of the pink hairband. Wouldn’t have really pegged him for a pink hairband kinda guy.  Military, probably.  Ex-military, anyway.  And he owed them, he did.  But he was also in the middle of dealing with a long and involved catastrophe that (Tony was 95% sure) involved corporate espionage, a pissed off military, and his weapons ending up in places they shouldn’t have.  He couldn’t let that happen again. That would not be his legacy. “I wish I could just let you go,” he said. “But I can’t.  You know that.”
Wasn’t he early? Well, shit, the workshop was a disaster zone.  On the other hand, Obie had been almost family for longer than Tony had been alive.  He’d seen worse.
“You have to actually eat the soup for it to do any good, it’s not Boggle.” He sounds amused, not annoyed. He sounds fond.
“That’s his sniper-bff.  Barnes.  He hates me, but, as you say, with good reason. He was breaking in.  I dunno what their thing is. Wouldn’t tell me.  He was knee deep in SI files.”
Steve pulled up sharply from his run, shaking his head to clear it.  He bent forward at the waist, letting the blood go to his head for a moment.  As he stood up slowly, he noticed there was a car waiting next to him. A silver Audi. Mr. Stark. Fuck. How long had he been there?
“Do… do you guys hear that?” Steve asked the others as they sat around the table munching on a biryani and roast chicken Bruce had just served up.
“You sure? Is there something else you wanted?” Tony asked. They’d been together for a while. Maybe Steve wanted something different, something new.
His mind kept straying.  Tony.  He’d really messed things up with him.  He thought he had been helpful.  He was pretty sure that he’d been able to keep most of the day to day chores off of Tony’s desk, managed to ease his mind sometimes.  Helped him, even, keep his cover at the gala.  He just shouldn’t have let himself get so carried away.  Steve grimaced, thinking of the romantic signals he must have been projecting.  Had Tony caught him ogling? Had he seen him when he’d mentioned the maid’s outfit? Had Steve’s words given him away? It was humiliating.  And Tony had never said anything.  Too polite, probably. He remembered a snippet of conversation from just a few days ago.
Tony’s friends were everything he said.  It didn’t change anything, anyway, only now Pepper’s parents didn’t care if he spent the night.  A small silver lining there.  They knew how to listen, and how to leave certain things lie.  Howard hadn’t been able to touch him—he’d disowned him, but he hadn’t been able to do anything. Matt Murdock was a goddamn genius, and Tony’s assets were ironclad against poaching.
More irony.  Tony was going to get his movement back, but the reactor was going to die on him before he could get down to the workshop. He was going to die before the paralysis wore off. This was worse than Afghanistan.  It was worse than anything.
“My parents are out of town this weekend, and Stevie and I are throwing a party! It’s a Halloween party, and everyone’s invited! Costumes mandatory! Or, you know, clothing optional!” He fist bumped Rhodey to punctuate.
“I think what you mean to ask is what Mr. Hogan’s last name is. Although I think he would be pleased if you merely continue to refer to him as ‘Sir,’ Captain.”
Steve coughs, like he’s a little embarrassed.  His tone says it too, he’s actually embarrassed for both of them. “Did you look at who’s running the school?”
Steve just smiled at him. “It’s okay, Tony.  Don’t worry about it. Any of your friends are always welcome here, too.”
“How interesting,” Pepper observed, pleased.  “Oh, the police are here! I’ll just pop out and meet them. Over here! Thank you for coming, we were
That was a very complete answer from an AI.  An AI who was clearly very fond of Mr. Stark.  But still, it sounded like it was warranted.  And sure, maybe the media was unfair. And yet, there was Bucky.
That was it.  That was everything.  Tony tried to send a quick message back, but it bounced back.  Undeliverable.
The next morning, Steve had coffee ready for Tony at his door, like normal.  Steve liked working for Tony.  He helped. He had little routines, orderly, like this one. Tony was a little sluggish, not surprising for the night he’d had.  He forgot to pull on his pajama top, and just threw on a robe to answer the door.  It fell open when he grabbed for his coffee.
“He missed a Spanish quiz, Tony.  His grades are dropping, even though he’s brilliant.  You gotta remind him to go to class.  Just, you know, next time you’re telling him he did a good job.”
Steve bit his lip. His face was always so open in the mornings, so clear, he turned to Tony broadcasting his affection clearer than words, smiling at him before kissing him good morning, every morning.  Now, his face was clouded, uncertain. The doubt seeped in, muting his eyes, shadowing the planes of his face.  “Have I been…” Steve stopped himself. It was as if Tony could see the younger Steve, his uncertainty, painted in translucent watercolor across his face now—the little guy that couldn’t get a date, who was always upstaged by his charismatic friend. What fools they had to have been, to pass up Steve Rogers. Steve’s lips pressed together, the little furrow forming between his eyes.  “Are you sure? I know I’m probably not what you normally date. But I’ve never been as happy as I am now. And you seemed happy, I thought.” His voice was a little frayed around the edges, soft, worn too thin and vulnerable.
Steve grabbed his bag, heading down to the garage.  Sam knew how to get in touch, Nat always had tabs on him. Tony could, if he thought about it, call.  He wouldn’t, Steve knew.  But he could.
So you’re a senior, huh? Me too.  Last Halloween here, and Shield kids always go all out.  What are you going to be for this, your final year? Big decision, right?
Scenario one: Tony had brought back a very enthusiastic partner and they were currently, um, busy, in the shower.  A woman, probably, by the pitch of the noise.  Tony hadn’t brought anyone back to the tower for months, and Steve was self-aware enough to know that he’d been more pleased by that than he should have been.  He started by telling himself it was because he wanted Tony to be in a stable, happy relationship. That he wanted him focused on the team.  It wasn’t exactly a lie.  He did want Tony to be in a stable, happy relationship (with him), and focused on (part of) the team (him).  He stifled the feelings pretty well most of the time.  He thought Natasha might know. He was pretty sure he’d slipped up when she had still been trying to find him a date.  But she wasn’t saying anything.
interesting! We haven’t had anything like this since school!” She beamed at the camera, clearly pleased with having such a complex task.
As the air lightened, Steve felt himself collapse, like his lungs couldn’t hold oxygen anymore, like his heart was slowly pulling itself smaller, his body losing its muscle, losing its will.  This was it, anyway, this was the end.  Somehow he’d have to explain to Tony what he was doing naked in Steve’s bed.  Chalk it up to magic, maybe.  How had he thought he’d survive this hit? How had he imagined he’d be able to go on?
And he does.  It works.  It works until Tony is outnumbered (he always is), surrounded (he always is), and the suit is damaged.  Giant sewer rats, the size of golden retrievers and glowing an unhealthy purple, mob him, razor claws scratching into the metal plates of the suit. Tony’s unsure what his next move is when a flash of black polymers catches his eye.  The fight’s a little more even.  Steve takes on more than his share, although Tony’s not sure that the suit is going to hold up well to the glowing purple claws.  He just hopes they’re not poisonous, too.  Eventually, they’re winning, only a few of the horrible sewer rats left. Steve’s caught one leaping toward his face when Tony puts down the last one on his side.  Tony turns, gauntlet raised, to blast the purple beast, and Steve flinches hard. It lets the rat scratch him deep across the chest. The suit holds up, but he’s bleeding profusely from his sternum. There’s a crack, and the rat goes limp, the glow fading.
“Let’s go, cupcake,” Tony said, indicating for Barnes to walk in front of him.  Heading up the stairs to the door, Tony inventoried the destruction the man had left in his wake.  How was it possible for a guy with only one arm to have broken so many things? Granted, most of the items in pieces had belonged to Howard, nothing that Tony himself held dear.  Except… the front door glass.  It was shattered.  And he’d personally (okay, well, Pepper had personally) commissioned that piece from some guy in Seattle.  But he’d paid for it.  And he’d liked it! Well, he’d at least liked that she liked it.  Close enough.  He stepped through the shattered panes, glinting sunlight in a brilliant rainbow across the walls.  It had been roses, he was pretty sure.  Irisis? No. It was red. Right, probably roses. Well, it was just silly to greet his robber’s buddy at the door like a butler.  He swallowed.  Not a day when he didn’t still miss the first Jarvis.  “I mean, you may just as well come in. Not like it’s secure anymore.”
“Tony,” Steve says his name like a sigh, like an embrace, “he would be extraordinarily lucky to be like you.” He waits for a beat.  Then, he asks, because he has to, because someone has to, and he hates that it has to be him, Tony can hear the reluctance in his voice, “What about the Accords?”
“Understood, ma’am.” Steve vacillated for a second. How would he survive the moment when he had to pull his affection back? And yet.  If it was the only way he’d be able to touch him. To show him.  If no one else would know. He felt a little twinge of guilt.  Would it be unfair to Tony? But she said, no one else would be harmed. Would it only be a dream? Then it would only be his loss.  And he knew that burden all too well. He knew how to say goodbye. “Yes.  I love him so much that some days it feels like I’m drowning because I can’t tell him, because I can’t lose him in my life.  If you can give me a day, when I can tell him, I can show him.  When he forgets, well… I think I can take the hit.”
Miss Potts eyed him speculatively, an eyebrow raised to incredible heights.  Then she turned her suddenly rather spiky gaze on Happy.  Happy swallowed, cowed.  She turned back to Steve, smiling kindly.  “Please, call me Pepper,” she said, extending an immaculately manicured hand.
Steve’s lips twisted—Tony’d hit a nerve. “Military doesn’t have enough style for you? Rather just sell the weapons to both sides?”
They ate sandwiches and played games for hours.  They’d ruled out Pictionary, since Steve could sketch anything incredibly quickly, and charades, since the Maximoffs’ pop culture had some pretty big gaps.  Tony always always won at Jenga, and Pepper could out-scrabble anyone. Natasha couldn’t be stopped at Clue, Steve and Rhodey alternated winning at Risk, and Wanda was so inscrutable that she could be holding a royal flush or a bunch of nonsense face cards and no one would ever know the difference.  Tony’s phone was in his pocket the whole night. A test.  If he got an email when he had an eye on Pieter, it wasn’t him. He wasn’t about to come out with it the way he had when he’d thought it was Steve.  He’d learned. But also, it wasn’t like he could just ask,
“Did you give him a microchute? If he’s slinging around New York, he should probably have a microchute.”
Tony shot a knowing look at the kid. Playing on Cap’s guilt at stealing the kid away from his aunt.  Sure enough, Steve’s gaze softened.  “Sure, Pete. Of course you can.” He turned back to the oven to pull out the bacon, missing Peter stick his tongue out at Tony in triumph.
He just about had it, he was pretty sure.  How had he not seen this solution before? Expanding the filter, widening it, increasing pressure, he could make the rate of flow more than quadruple.  That would make it usable.  Rate of flow should be nearly 3L/min instead of the previous .5L. The filter could pop out and be replaced, instead of replacing the whole unit.  Using UV sterilization that worked through a hand pump got rid of one of the more expensive filtering agents.  Cheap, easy to replace. Probably an ironic metaphor in there somewhere.
did that.  He was responsible for that smile.  He’d managed to lighten the load for Tony.  He might not be able to figure out his own mess, but he was able to help Tony, a little.  That had to be worth something.
“Of course, Tony. I’m looking forward to it.” Steve put his hand on Tony’s shoulder as they walked out of the common room.
“No worries, Rogers.  Look, make sure you feed yourself.  Mi casa, you know.  Besides, you sort of look like you need a lot of feedings. Not to make you sound like Shamu or anything. Just imagine that takes a lot of work to keep up.” Tony gestured at Steve’s general body, and Steve’s blush spread. Tony did not imagine the blush spreading across Steve’s chest.  He didn’t.  Or at least he tried not to. He took another bite, realizing it was the end of the sandwich.
Tony flipped it over in his hands.  It felt different. It moved differently. “I’ll take it. Just charge the account.” He grinned.  It was… interesting. Even if all he did was flatten it out into a frisbee for Rhodey.
Steve was clearly dismissed, so he grabbed the empty plate and glass, letting himself out, strains of wailing guitars cutting off when the door closed. On his way up the stairs, he ran into a couple, bickering amiably, talking over each other.  They shut up abruptly when they saw Steve.
“Steve,” he says, trying to put some of that in his tone, “I’m glad you called. It’s good to hear your voice.”
“Valorous conduct.  Weren’t a lot of details, but from what I could put together, he spent a lot of his time in Afghanistan running around and rescuing people.  He led a small joint command—international forces, did a lot of good. Ended up specializing in rescuing hostages.  His whole team got targets basically painted on their backs, they were so good. It all ended when his buddy got hit on a patrol Rogers was leading.  Most of them got out okay, but he lost a few men, and his sniper lost an arm. Rogers ended up doing some field medical on him and carrying him and a local nearly five clicks to safety.” Rhodes paused. “Looked a little like a setup, maybe. Or bad intel.  Not Rogers’s fault.  Not that
When he’d moved in, back after the Chitauri, he’d been amazed.  Tony’d winked, assuring him all the beds were that large.  In case of guests. They’d been in the phase of trying to settle in with each other, and Steve hadn’t been sure how to take that.  It was early enough in their relationship—friendship—that it was like a kick to the gut, thinking Tony was like Howard all over again, trying to needle him, thinking he was something of an idiot.  These days, he knew better.  Of course, now when he thought about that salacious wink it did something else entirely to him.
Steve really didn’t need that visual.  At all. The thought of Tony’s tongue licking—well, it didn’t help, although he didn’t think he could blush any harder.
“Good point.  Hey, speaking of, how did he metabolize the powder? What was the differential between him, Thor, and Natasha?”
“Sir, Captain Rogers’s phone is not being called by Senator Stern, but it seems that you would like to know that he is currently under discussion by text.”
“It landed on your boot,” Tony pointed out, tapping the filter and watching the particles float down. “I was a little worried about you, actually.”
Tony could feel Steve’s muscles tense, ready to release him when he remembered that Steve wasn’t the Ken doll he’d accused him of being before. That wouldn’t do.  He wound one arm around Steve’s neck, cupping Steve’s face with his other hand.  “I do know what you are. I do. You’re kind, and insightful.  You believe the best in everyone, never stop trying to make things right.  You’re the person who wants to make refugee camps feel like home, the person who gives everything he has for other people.” He paused, pulling Steve into a kiss. He ran a hand over Steve’s chest. “The package is nice, Steve, literally my dad’s greatest creation, since he was kind of an asshole who focused on designing new ways to kill people.  It’s nice, but it’s not what makes you amazing.”
“Well done, Rogers.  You saved us a bunch of money. What do you think, J, about $50,000 in delays, another $300k in market share once HammerTech has to work through the ethics committee?”
“And play audio?” Steve asked.  Once the audio was playing, Steve paraphrased.  “He’s telling someone to convert dollars into diamonds.  Look, I mean that alone doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but if you look at his office, see,” Steve pointed, “that’s a HammerTech phone—his third mobile—and that’s the one he was using, and that photo on the yacht was taken in Monaco.  Hammer lives in Monaco.  I ran a search, and it turns out the yacht is named
“Well, yeah, I did that,” Barnes admitted, definitely not the least bit sorry. Stane cradled his hand, whimpering.
Cap: A friend told me to ask myself if I respected that person, and if so, to respect and honor their decisions.  Give their sacrifice dignity.  Because that person believed in you. That you were worth saving.  Don’t know if it will help.
“Good.  And Steve, thank you so much for feeding Tony lunch.  Let me get you set up.” Pepper pulled out an envelope from her purse and shook it onto the table.  Here’s your credit card, for shopping for groceries and anything else Tony needs you to pick up.  That includes meals for you,” she said, giving him a keen look. “A key to the BMW.  That’s for your use for errands.  A StarkPhone.  It’s secure.  But if you’re teleconferencing, use the office next to your room instead.  Also, anything you need.  My number is on speed dial; it’s #2. Tony, of course, is #1.  Alright.  Well, I think you have a call going to SI France soon, right? We’ll get out of your hair.”
Steve had held his hand as he cried, held his head as he’d puked, and put him to bed.  Bucky would be horrified when he realized he was back to being a duckling.  Still, it was the least he could do.  Bucky had always been by his side, always had his back.  He’d had to assign him to some of the most difficult positions when he was the team’s sniper.  Too exposed for comfort, separated from the rest of the team.  But Bucky had never complained.  Never tried to pull rank or earn favor because he was Steve’s best friend.  He just had a job to do.  Watching Steve’s sorry ass, as he usually put it, trying to keep him out of trouble.
“Not at all, Mr. Rogers,” Jarvis replied. Steve could swear he was slightly less cold, but perhaps he was just getting used to having a voice direct him around through the ceiling.
Steve bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to draw blood, withdrawing his hand.  “Um. I’m not sure what happened. But yes, this is um, this is my room.”
The first time they finally fell into bed together, Tony realized he’d never get enough.  He’d never get enough of that single-minded focus, the heat of it, crawling down his skin.  Steve crowded him up against the wall, all-consuming, blocking out the noise, the distractions, everything that wasn’t a vast expanse of warm skin.
Hammer slipped his own phone open.  “True, Tony, true, my friend! But… I’ve got screenshots. And I airdropped them to myself.” He grinned again.  Disgusting.  “Besides, it’s not just you, is it? It’s your…” he sneered, “…friend.”
“On the bike?” Tony never had to hitch a ride.  He always took the suit.  But then Steve usually didn’t have the bike with him either, getting called in unexpectedly from a meeting in midtown. Something in Steve’s voice. “Sure, Cap.”
Pepper uncapped a pen.  “Great, glad you made it, Tony.  Peggy, you don’t have to play if you don’t want to, but you’re absolutely welcome to join us. I know you’re hanging out with these two a lot, anyway,” she nodded her head toward Steve and Sam.
Finally, he pushed the door open, stepping into the darkness.  He was surprised by the pool of light, falling on Steve’s smooth chest, haloing the heavy tome in his hand.
But through it all, Tony’s days were a little more lonely.  A little less meaningful.  A little less.  And it’s not like he had spent time moping on the couch—on the contrary. He’d gotten into MIT, with offers from Cal Tech, Berkeley, and, unaccountably, three from Harvard.  He’d somehow been voted royalty for the Valentine’s dance—whether it was someone’s twisted joke or just a strong statement of support, either way, he’d take it.  And if anything, his friends had all gotten closer.  But still.  Through it all, every day.  He still thought about Flying.  Still wondered.  Flying said Tony wouldn’t want him, if he knew. Said he didn’t want to disappoint him.  Like Tony mattered to him.  Like he cared.
A train in the Alps, the cold seeping into his bones.  Bucky, falling, over and over.  Clinging to his hand.  Sometimes, Steve would be the one falling, but Bucky would catch him, catch him, as if to say,
“Bucky! What did you think you were doing? I’m so sorry, Mr. Stark, it’s all my fault, I just—is that
“Hey, everybody. You all know by now, that I’m gay.” Tony’s voice shook, a little, but it was strong.  “I didn’t choose to say it that way, but it’s there. And it’s true.” He wiped his palms against his jacket, crown a bit askew on his head.  He looked at Pepper, Valentine Queen. She nodded encouragingly. Tony took a deep breath, then: “And I’m in love with the guy who is on the other end of those emails you all saw.  Flying, I don’t know what you look like, but I know who you are. I know you.  I know that you are kind, and generous, that you champion what’s right, and that you are smart, and thoughtful. I know that I love you. And I’ll be waiting for you, until midnight, at the place you mentioned you go to remember that someone is always in your corner.  Because I am.” Tony’s voice cracked a little at the end.  The room was a blur, nothing in focus. He handed the microphone over to Pepper, who hugged him tight, and walked out, not looking around, not looking back.  Silence held until he stepped out of the doors, but he could hear commotion as it latched behind him.
“You should really be talking to Pepper, since she’s CEO now,” Tony was saying, bringing his tumbler to his mouth. He smiled, suddenly, brilliant and real, as Steve saw him realize his glass was now benign.  Steve felt a flash of pride.
Tony shoved the thought away.  He’d have plenty of time for that later. Rhodes was always there for him, and he needed help on the Hill.  He grabbed the keys to the Bugatti.
He wasn’t being petulant.  He wasn’t.  But SHIELD monitored everything, every move he made, from the moment he stepped out the door to the moment he arrived back inside.  He was only sure that he wasn’t being monitored inside the house because he’d done a thorough inspection.  Very thorough. He’d found three listening devices and a motion tracker, but nothing else.  He put them all in the kitchen, under the very noisy little plastic coffee maker. So they’d know when he had coffee, every morning, and several times a night.  So what.  It was a good place for it.  Coulson had given him a strange look the next day, but he hadn’t said anything.  And Steve had taken to booby trapping the door—little things—such old spycraft no one would even notice it anymore.  A hair over the latch.  A perfect fingerprint on his doorknob.  No one had been in or out besides him.
“Sir has been actively developing the clean water project since returning from Afghanistan,” Jarvis announced. Where did that come from? It wasn’t like Jarvis to volunteer extra information.
“Sorry,” Steve stammered, guiltily.  “I’m sorry, Tony, he was just, and I couldn’t, you looked so… Jarvis, did you, um…”
After that, every night was the same, long after Tony told him to stop asking if he could stay, he’d already got his toothbrush in Tony’s cup and most of his clothes were in the dresser anyway. He wrapped Tony up, kissed him.  Tony slept the night through.
The smell of pizza caught him on his way up the stairs. Jarvis was the best.  How did he know to order pizza every time Tony got hungry?  Besides the fact that he’d been invented by a genius, obviously.
Steve took Tony’s fingers in his hand, kissing them.  “You don’t need to give me anything, Tony. Being with you is everything.”
“Steve,” she greeted him. “I’m so glad you’re here for Tony, especially with Happy gone.  I need to wrangle a new investor into clean energy.  I’m a wreck—I have to sign Johansson tonight—and I can’t worry about Tony.  Tonight’s going to be difficult, since he doesn’t want to let the public know, well, you know. It’s going to be rough. You’ll keep an eye on him, won’t you?”
Tony drove to school, distracted, but listening to his friends with one ear.  His mind was working overtime, trying to figure out who it was, who was the guy? Would he write back?
Steve was horrified, incensed.  “No.” He wished he could believe that kind of thing didn’t happen, but he also wasn’t naïve.  How many of those scenarios happened daily? Too many. “Were you…”
. “It’s true.” His side is already starting to heal.  It’s unfortunate. He likes focusing on that feeling. It helps.
“Bucky! What are you doing? I’m on my way to you. Didn’t I tell you not to be an idiot! Not to be a hero?”
“Tony. Have you seen ShieldSpies today?” Her voice bubbled, excitedly.  “Oh, my goodness.  I don’t know why we don’t have a club yet for this.  I wonder if ASB wants to start a club, or maybe the model UN would want to take it on.” She was already musing, and Tony had no idea.  He opened his laptop, logging on to Pepper’s favorite gossip site.
Barnes glared at Tony.  “I hope you know what you’re doing,” he said, although to be fair, Tony wasn’t sure which of them it was directed toward. He stepped through the shards of glass, muttering about indentured servitude as he went.
“I can’t, Tony.  Sam says… Sam says I have to know when you won’t say what you need, when you put your needs aside.  And he’s right.  So I won’t come in there.  Not without some way for you to know you’re safe.”
Tony still lingered in the doorway, obviously not coming back into the room where he’d woken up this morning.  He smiled though, a little tight at the edges.  “Right. Well.  Same.” He moved away, tossing back, “Take care of yourself, Rogers.”
“It’s going to be fine,” he assured her. He glanced at Steve.  “Sif’s got Crazytown in the cone of shame again.”
Happy scowled at him.  “Hm.  I’ll be checking through this more.  Your personal dossier was remarkably lacking when I pulled it from DOD.  Yeah, I have friends at DOD.  I’ll get to the bottom of it.”
Steve was feeling pretty good about himself. They had maybe only an hour left to go at this thing, and he’d be able to tell Mr. Hogan that everything had gone well, when he inwardly cursed himself for tempting fate.  Senator Stern walked through the door.
. Steve wanted to wrap Tony up and protect him, tell him how amazing he was, just be in the same space—he felt lighter and happier when he was with Tony, even bringing him coffee, getting to see him when he’d just woken up, lax and gentle, he wanted to spend every late night listening to him quantify what he needed to work on the next day, he wanted to shield Tony from aggressive reporters at press conferences and beam with pride at how he handled himself and hold him and comfort him afterward. He wanted to cover that ridiculous bed in a thousand silky rose petals and spread Tony down within them. He wanted everything with Tony.  He wanted to give everything to him.
“What are you doing here, Steve?” Tony asked when he recovered. He couldn’t tell how his voice sounded, grateful he could get words out at all, past the lump in his throat, the squeeze of it.
Tony had never been one to believe in fate. It was too whimsical. There was no proof, no science.  He still didn’t.  But there was something so right about this, about being here, with Steve Rogers, in his arms, Steve smiling down at him, somehow keeping all of him warm, keeping him close, keeping his heart. Somehow it felt exactly like coming home.
“Thanks, Jarvis.”  Technically, maybe, Steve didn’t really need to thank an artificial intelligence, but it just seemed wrong not to.  After all, he was doing something Steve had asked him to do.
The arc reactor was stunning. It was.  Symmetrical, perfect, and powerful.  It had literally saved his life, and then made him redeem it, so it was gorgeous on its own.  But seeing it rendered into this new idea, through Steve’s eyes. Something that Steve must have seen as worthwhile, too.  Something he must have seen as beautiful.
But that’s what made Steve who he was. He didn’t want to confront Fury. He didn’t really enjoy fighting, when it came down to it.  Tony shook his head, knowing Steve couldn’t see it.  Steve just couldn’t look the other way. He couldn’t turn away when he saw injustice.  Couldn’t.
“I think it is so. Sexy. That you won invitationals, Steve,” Lorraine purred.  “Our school is so lucky to have you.”
Well, Steve was straight, but at least Tony could understand.  He had good taste, was all.  Great taste, actually.  And he could see how a little bit of hero-worship could totally turn into a crush.  But at least Steve wouldn’t actually be competition.  For Tony.  If Pieter was actually who Tony thought he was.  Because he was, right? It made sense.  The cookies, the sport, the chess, the last year of school… maybe he learned to adopt that American accent by watching
He called Tony’s favorite pizza place, ordering eight large pies, two vegetarian (for Hulk, although Bruce seemed to eat anything), two all meat (Natasha’s order, mostly), and four olive and pepperoni (Tony’s choice). Thor ate everything, and lots of it.
A ping went off on Tony’s screen and he looked back at Steve with that warm, quiet smile.  “Nat’s waiting for you in the gym.”
Electronics! The electronics on a motorcycle. That wouldn’t be so far out of the normal scope, what with the Moritas owning an electronics shop. And they were still talking physics. Perfect. This was a golden opportunity, ripe for the taking, almost made for Tony.
“Tony, I. I’m just. You know what I am, you saw the photos.  That’s all I am. This is just a show, it’s not real.”
Steve ended up at the cell that held Njorun, the goddess of dreams.  She smiled at him, gently, golden hair flowing down her back in a shimmering river, as he opened the door for her.
“Just run along, Steve.  We’ll both be up in a few minutes. And thank you, for bringing down lunch.” Pepper smiled at him and started clicking her way down the stairs toward the workshop.
Tony calls him, sometimes.  The first time, he tells him upfront that they have sixty seconds before Ross can trace the call because he’s tracing almost anything that goes out of country.  He tells him not to say where he is.  Like Tony doesn’t know. That leaves them about fifty seconds for a difficult conversation. It takes dozens of calls, and Tony’s always the one who has to hang up. They both make apologies, explain, begin to maybe forgive.
“Please! I’ll—I’ll pay you back. I’ll… I’ll fix it.” Steve swallowed, even as he said it.  How was he going to find the money to do that? And it wasn’t like he could really fix a broken glass sculpture.
“Boys,” Natasha said, under her breath.  “But if you want a break from all the testosterone, Stark, you know where to find me.” She trailed her hand down his neck and over his chest.  Steve thought he was going to die.  How many times had he wanted to do the same thing? She walked away, heels clicking as her hips swayed.  Even Steve couldn’t help watching her go.
Steve hung his jacket on a peg, running a hand fondly down the sleeve.  Motorcycles seemed to be one of the least-changed items since he’d been dead.  Asleep.  He meant asleep.
Tony turned his gaze back on Steve who seemed lost in thought, eyes transfixed by their hands.  Tony’s skin held a deeper hue, leaving Steve’s to reflect luminescent, milky pale, in the moonlight. A breeze, summery but chill, stole through the window. Tony looked back at their hands. He thought he’d never been warmer.
“Right. Well.  Same.” Tony stepped back into the elevator. “About the getting in touch, anyway. Take care of yourself, Rogers, don’t miss me too much, save the manful tears.” He grinned, pressing the button to take him back to the workshop.
Bucky was resting peacefully, worn out, so Steve slipped out into the living room to call Natasha. He was midway through dialing her number when his phone started ringing.  Steve grabbed it before it could wake him up.
Laughing, Steve got down to business.  He laid out the aerials, pointing out where they’d done well.  He noted the shortening transition time for Hulk, and Thor’s lack of collateral damage, which is when Tony noticed that someone was trying to play footsie.  He wasn’t sure who it was.  Not Steve—he was at the front of the room. That was a letdown.  If there was anyone he’d like to be feeling up right now, it was the team leader currently trying to run a meeting. And his motivation wasn’t even to get out of a meeting this time, he just genuinely wanted to peel that shirt right off him and run his tongue down his chest.  But he always wanted to do that, so it wasn’t about evading the debrief. His mind wandered, as he deconstructed the word “debrief” into other, more enjoyable meanings that he could be doing to Steve. De-boxer-briefing, so to speak. So basically this was just like any other Tuesday. Except someone was rubbing a foot up his calf. He twitched, drawing his legs under him and glaring around the table.
“Uh, maybe you didn’t notice, but I’ve also been in the business of life? Didn’t hear? It’s okay, only been all the headlines for the past eighteen months or so.  Intellicrops? Vaccines? Body armor? Sustainable energy?”
Tony picked his up, squinting to read the text. Then he snapped a quick selfie of them both, obviously naked, Steve’s lips against his neck, Tony's hand somewhere clearly not platonic, typed a quick caption and pressed send.
Tony thought back.  He did remember seeing a new girl, flipping off a wolf-whistler across the cafeteria.  “Oh, right, totally. She’s super hot,” he tried to gush.  “That, um, that accent, that’s really…” he trailed off.
He left his sketchbook, pages filled with Tony, to brush his teeth thoroughly and brew coffee. When Tony lifted the blackout, he could tell him.  He could show him.
“Well, wanted to keep it authentic, Cap,” Tony said, gratified that Steve had noticed. He turned back to the design that Jarvis had up. “How’s it feel? They might be a little tight on your fingers but we can stretch them out, loosen ‘em up so you can really move around in there.”
So I guess, why am I telling you this? Well, your emails are the best part of my day, too.  Every day.
Steve turned away from Tony to face his friend directly.  Tony couldn’t help himself.  He noticed the set of his shoulders, ready for the confrontation, and the extremely shapely ass he would have liked to see under more friendly circumstances.  Barnes noticed him noticing.  But fuck it, he was Tony Stark, and that man had broken into his house.  So he grinned, to let Barnes know that he noticed the noticing.  Notiception! “Buck, you know you can’t do it,” Steve was saying. “Not with that arm…” he trailed off.  Took a deep breath. “And it’s not like I have anything more important going on right now.  It doesn’t matter for me.  It’s the least I can do.”
“Dude, aren’t you practically official with Natasha now? Cut the rest of us a break, man,” Rhodey griped at him.
Tony kept staring at the screen. That was the end of it, then.  Okay. He could deal. It was what, 3:08am?  And he’d missed two days of school.  Sure.
Natasha had the paperwork in motion to separate his assets.  They were at a lawyer that she somehow knew, Murdock.  His parents were out of town. That would give him a little bit of a breather. Even Howard couldn’t magically teleport here and beat the shit out of him without accounting for physics. That would give him the better part of a day. And that’s only if it made a major news outlet, not the little gossip site that served as a school rumor mill.  After all, yesterday it had hosted a post that said T’Challa was a Black Panther trying to bring down American society from within.  Idiots.
“He tried to poison me, twice.  Just this week. Didn’t you? You did. You know you did.  One more time and I’m bringing you down to PS 24.  Those middle schoolers will love you,” Tony threatened, fondly, “and they’re sticky. Your gears won’t last a week.”
When Tony woke up, on the pavement, sky blessedly clear of monstrous flying robot iguanas, the wormhole closed, the arc reactor ached in his chest, carving out space for itself, stealing his breath.
They tossed around names while the kitten ate an entire plate of chicken.  Thor thought they should name it Loki, and Tony could get behind that, since it was an asshole, and so was Loki.  Natasha called the kitten something in Russian, but none off the rest of them knew what it meant or could pronounce it.  Bruce didn’t feel like adding any names to the pot, and Clint wanted to name him Clint, which they all vetoed.  Finally Steve thought, since he was found in the Stradale, they could name him Romeo.  He turned pink when he offered up the name, but the team just teased him for being such a sentimentalist.
Suddenly his phone disappeared, snatched from his grasp by VP Coulson.  “Stark, take some time for the real world.  You can’t be wrapped up in tech all day. Take some time to breathe.”
Tony groaned.  “It’s so stupid that we have to be on one team. Shield High is big enough for two teams and then I wouldn’t have to—”
He sees Steve’s eyes widen as he understands, sees his eyes find the folded material on the workbench.  Then his jaw sets, stubborn. “The workshop is yours.  It’s.  You feel safe here.  I won’t take that from you.”
Steve looked up, regret clearly still in his gaze.  “Of course. If you really want to. But you look a little run down.  Could you maybe skip the conference? Have Pepper do it, as CEO?”
In all honesty, he had no idea how to handle the mess.  He wasn’t sure what to do.  There really wasn’t anywhere to turn. He chewed the inside of his cheek and slipped the phone away. Pepper glided up next to him, white suit glowing in the soft lighting.
He shut the door, leaving a perfect thumbprint on the handle, and followed Coulson up the stairs to the roof where a little red car waited. Lola, Steve surmised.
Coulson disappeared after introducing Tony Stark, but whatever he hoped to get out of the meetinng, Steve was pretty sure it wasn’t this.  Stark never even took off his sunglasses, flashy red-lensed things that hid his eyes, masked his gaze.  He turned those lenses on Steve, looking him over, expressionless.
Steve picked up his golf ball and tossed it lightly into the return bin.  “Nope. Missed my chance, never came back. Not until now.”
Steve seems to notice, covering for him.  He adds, “Besides, potato chips aren’t healthy.  Get the kid some carrot sticks or something. I didn’t do all those PSAs for nothing.”
The way he gave and gave of himself.  The way he'd smile at Tony in that secret smile that made Tony glow, because he saw him, he knew him, and he seemed to like him anyway.
Steve glanced at Sam, grateful, but didn’t quite seem to catch Tony’s eye.  Well, maybe he was a little uncomfortable, having heard about Tony.  Didn’t really seem like a Steve thing to do, but maybe Tony was just taking things personally. Seeing things that weren’t there. After all, Steve seemed a little embarrassed overall, not quite meeting most people’s eyes.
Tony was still marveling at his creation, basking in—pride wasn’t quite the word he was looking for, except that it was.  He’d made this.  It was going to save his life.
Steve’s lips twisted. That was not a smile.  Hm.  Well, Tony had long practice at being more than what he appeared.  They ate in mostly silence, but it wasn’t awkward. It was actually somewhat comfortable.  Steve wasn’t sure what it said about it him that this was comfortable.  But it was. Even when Tony teased him about the salt and pepper dip he made for his fries.  He thought Mr. Stark might just have been trying to put him at ease, since he had a faint, pleased smile when Steve grudgingly laughed.
Steve put his bookmark between the pages, set it aside.  “Well.  When I feel like I need more information to solve a problem or make a decision, I go to the experts. People who know more than I do.”
Tony reached for Steve with his free hand, slipping it around his neck, drawing him closer.  “Then you know that this is me. All me.”
“Oh jeez, Buck; what have you done?” the voice asked.  Tony could hear the engine of a bike shut off through the phone, then the heavy tread of footsteps.  Ugh.  A Neanderthal.  Tony could just picture a great, hulking brute, tattooed and bearded, leather vest… He did not have time for this.  The line went dead, just in time for Tony’s doorbell to ring.
“You saved me from myself, Steve. It’s probably three days of work you saved, plus whatever I’d normally have trashed while I was drunk.” His voice was weary and acidic, heavy with irony, buoyed by a false jauntiness. “Probably another $400k. You’re almost all paid up.” He hated himself. Reminding Steve of just why he was there, that Tony was the sort of man who took advantage of that kind of situation.  But the truth was that Steve
“Sure. I’ll be in later.  I love making friends.” Steve watched Coulson consider how to take his tone.
“Steven. You are such an ass!” Tony exclaimed.  Fucking Rogers, trolling him about the first Star Wars movies.  Tony told Jarvis to delete them from the catalogue, but they kept popping back up in the queue on movie night. At first he’d thought it was Clint, but now his money was on Steve.
“This is ridiculous,” Tony exclaims. He undoes the cuffs before Steve can refuse, pulls him up and resettles him on the couch.  Steve has that look on his face.  Damnit.  “Okay, okay, compromise, then,” Tony says. He cuffs one wrist to a water line.  It should be comfortable. He sits down on a stool nearby.  He towers over Steve. That isn’t lost on either of them.
Tony had recent experience with the military himself.  Owed a lot to the men and women in uniform.  Got a lot of them killed.  He could feel the suffocating heat of the desert, the stifling sand, the air that burned and exploded around him.  He tasted blood, sharp and metallic.  The humdrum vee.  How had he been so arrogant? He desperately wanted a drink for a second, like his lungs wanted air, instinctive, pressing, and sharp. But no, he didn’t do that anymore.  That’s what he owed them.  That’s what he owed Yinsen.  He shook his head once, to clear it. Blondie misinterpreted.
“Yeah, well, he was right!” Tony shot back. Rhodey grabbed his chest, faking a heart attack. Tony threw his napkin at him.  “Shut it.  I can be right, and he can also be right. We can both be right.”
“Look, Steve,” Tony said, cutting off Steve’s incipient apology for something he should never have to apologize for.  “I’m sorry.  That wasn’t like me to do something like that. Not anymore. I’m not. I’m not like that. I don’t. I’m not like that.”
“Hey man,” Rhodey said. “How have I never seen you working here before? I swear we’re in here like three times a week.”
Steve picked him up and turned him, loving the fact that he could, placing him gently back on a pillow.  “I love you,” he told him, just because he could, and then hooked his arms under Tony’s knees, lined himself up, and slowly pushed just the tip into Tony’s yielding body, hot and tight, the rim pulsing around the head of his cock, fluttering. He stopped, afraid he hadn’t loosened him up enough.  He ran his hands down Tony’s sides, kissed his thigh. “Sweetheart?” he asked.
Jarvis’s voice broke through his thoughts. “Sir? One: James Barnes, sir.  He’s on the premises, trying to breach secure files.”
“Great, Jarvis,” Steve said.  “I want to make chicken parmigiana tonight, and I’ve never made it before.  We have jars of pasta sauce, right?”
He’d wake, sitting up ramrod straight.  The lights from the neon beyond his windows were too bright, the reds and oranges, the blues, like the phosphorescence of bombs, the crimson of blood, the blue of the tesseract.
Steve turned his back, leaving the door open.  He could come in if he wanted.  Maybe he wanted to check where the listening devices were.  “Seems like he’s gone through a lot,” was all he said.
Pepper scrunched up her nose the way she did when she couldn’t puzzle something out. “I still don’t understand.”
Steve’s still bleeding steadily.  Maybe the claws were poisoned after all. “No. It’s not.  It’s what there is.”
No one paid any attention during class.  They may as well have canceled them. Instead, rumors ran rampant—Steve had ambushed Hammer and Hodge (both of them?), Steve had been painting Peggy naked, Steve had been dealing drugs—the rumors got more and more ridiculous throughout the day, but by lunchtime, the word was out.
Tony was practically exploding with excitement.  “Rogers, you don’t trust physics? I’m sure physics can defeat the Force, physics is the best it can do anything,” he started, getting ready to defend his favorite science.  A cookie hit him in the side of the head.
“I had Jarvis scan it, but the original is yours.  Stern won’t be able to touch you, I’ve already called him. And if he does, I’ll sue his ass for breach of contract. Or, I mean, I’ll have legal do it. Well, Pepper will have legal do it. Discreetly.”
Steve blinked at him, clear blue eyes. Tony couldn’t even look directly at him, instead watching the skyline.  “Did I do something?”
Or maybe it was him.  Maybe it was Tony.  Maybe Flying had heard the news, seen who Tony was, who he really was, and found him lacking.  Flying might not think he was cute. Might think he was a nerd. Maybe he just didn’t think Tony was attractive.  Not even his fault.
Speaking of which, Tony needed to pack up his belongings, ship them back to Barnes’s apartment.  Not like there was a lot to pack.  But Steve had run out of here without anything—just a phone.
Tony couldn’t look at him, buried his face in Steve’s chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heart.
“Tony, mind if we swing by and pick up Jimmy? He said he wanted a little help with physics before the final,” Rhodey asked, leaning forward in his seat.
“Tony, is that a little less shiny than it was last time I saw it?” Steve asked, his eyebrows coming together in a furrow. “Is it that salve I gave you?”
There’s a silence, on the other end.  It’s too silent.  The call is still live, but there is absolutely no sound.  No wind.  No ambient noise.  It lasts a few moments.  Then he can hear Steve again.  His voice is ragged, but polite.  “Of course.  I’m sorry for calling.  But please, keep the phone.  I mean what I said.  If you ever need me, I’ll be there.”
Tony closed the door.  “Where is this going?” Sending Steve away had been painful the first time. How could he do it again?
“Of course, Mr. Rogers.  But these matters are delicate, no? And we are working as quickly as possible.”
“No more carting you to swim meets, no more practice SATs… Maybe I’ll take up quilting, send you some blankets in college.” Mr. Morita messed up Jimmy’s hair, then turned back to Tony.  “You boys get going.  Make sure you show me what it turns into, now, and make sure it doesn’t go all Terminator on us.” He winked at Tony and waved them toward the door.
“Tony!” Mr. Morita exclaimed excitedly.  “You’ll never believe what I got in yesterday! Jimmy—go get that little box I put on the coffee table,” he ordered the kid in the back.  “Jimmy just finished his last college applications,” he confided in the boys.  “Says he wants to get a scholarship so I don’t need to pay for him to go to school.  I told him I didn’t mind, I’d handle it, but he wants to make sure he doesn’t have to ask.  He’s such a good son.”
Then Fury slumped a bit, moved to rest against the edge of his desk.  Tony felt a surge of pride, bursting out of his seams.  His man went toe to toe with the vulture and won.  He’d keep an eye on the programs, remotely, but Steve had won this round.  He was ridiculously hot. His principles, his will, his willingness to lay it all on the line.  And, Tony thought, watching Steve walk out of the room, the rest of him was pretty hot, too.
I don’t have a sister. I don’t have any siblings. I’m not who you think I am.  I’m sorry.  I hope you’re not disappointed.
Steve was still confused, but he felt pretty sure they weren’t talking about him.  He didn’t have any iridium, at least.  He got out of bed, glad that he’d decided not to go to sleep naked, but also slightly mortified that he’d worn the Iron Man underwear.  He drew himself up, trying to project confidence.  “What’s going on?”
He was so gentle with Tony.  Sweet.  Generous. And goddamn enthusiastic.  Steve anticipated him, fingers resting gently over the reactor, cleaned it up, wiped him down with a warm cloth.
“No.  Just running.” Steve wanted to tell him more, ask for forgiveness, demand answers.  But he was just so tired.
Pain, sharp—burning him from the inside, eating through his veins. Debris, falling all around. Heat, salt, sand.  Bucky, bleeding out on the ground.  The high whine of an incoming missile.  The sharp outline of the Stark name on the missile casing.  A puffy, grasping face with a court order, smiling slyly at him.  Burning pain. Debris.  Heat. Salt. Sand. Bucky. Blood. Whistle.
Steve paled. “Please, I…” He trailed off. What could he say? He felt overexposed, unable to see the whole board.
Tony flashed him a brilliant smile, brittle at the edges, putting his sunglasses back on. “I hope it was all you imagined it to be, Rogers.”
“Well, I’ll work for you?” Steve suggested, hand coming up to awkwardly rub at his neck.  “I could… help clean it up, and then do repairs around here until it was all paid off?”
“You guys should have ice cream tonight,” Barnes told Steve as they made their way toward the door. Steve turned crimson.  Nat reached up to give him a hug, slipping his phone into his hand. The two stepped out into the shadows cast by the sinking sun, blue silhouettes stretching long across the grounds, bathed in the scarlet and purple tones of sunset.
I’m glad you had a good day.  I’m getting there.  And I’m sorry about the email thing, I was super busy, but I wasn’t disappointed.
Hell, as long as he was wishing.  He could still feel the warm, firm pressure of Steve’s arms around him, however brief the moment had been.  The way the sunlight had glinted off his stupid eyelashes at the mini golf park.  The feeling of his hand on Tony’s wrist, gently stroking his hand, calming him.  The way he’d looked at him when Tony told him to go, like maybe he wanted to come back.  Like maybe he wanted in some small part to stay.  Like maybe there was something in Tony that was worth coming back to. Just having him around, being a friend.  Just being near him. It would be enough.
Tony stilled, ready to enter him, halting all his motion, a sea change from his normal frenetic pace.  He reached up, winding his fingers through Steve’s. He smiled, that same sweet, secret smile Steve had seen from him in what was not exactly a dream.  And then Steve lost the thread as Tony pushed inside him, his lips moving, but Steve couldn’t hear anything over his own pulse in his ears, the pressure building inside him, the feeling of being full, overfull, god too much it was too much and he needed, his heart racing, he needed, and then Tony was there, stroking his face, kissing him gently, a counterpoint to the steady quick thrusts, he was overwhelmed, but Tony had him, he had him, on the ragged edge, tipping over and the world brightened for a moment, too bright, too much, and he came, hard and jagged, ropes of white hitting his chest, his face even, and Tony just drove in, harder, quicker and shallow, barely pulling out at all until he gasped Steve’s name and pulsed deep inside him, hot and wet.
Rhodey shrugged, picking up another cookie.  “The ROTC info session ended twenty minutes ago. I came over right away. Sam sent me a photo of these babies,” he said, looking fondly at his cookie.
Steve blew out a breath he seemed to have been holding.  “I may end up getting demoted, today.  Or fired. Think you can find a place for me in your security division?” He smiled, finally, wryly.  “That’s sort of the extent of my skillset.”
“I know, you know what I am, what I’m not, I don’t want you to feel pressured, like I told you at the beginning, I’m just a kid from Brooklyn, it’s all I am, but everything that I am I want to give to you, I just, I want to make the world better with you. I want to make the world better for you. If you want…”
Nat sent out a text almost immediately—Hammer, Tony, Pepper, Steve, Sam, Rhodey… Picking up some last minute community service wrapping presents at the mall for Black Friday.  She brought everyone a coffee, handing them all out personally, including one for Hammer.  She instructed them on proper wrapping technique, folding all the edges under.  Steve was the best at it, all of his edges perfect and neat, but she helped Hammer more than the rest of them.  Of course, that was also because he was sloppy and lazy, but still.  It did end up with him getting more attention, so the beast was kept at bay. Tony was exhausted when he got home, and sporting three paper cuts.
Christ.  “I’m going to have to call you back, Pepper,” he said quickly, brain fritzing like his first two attempts at programming U.  “Um, Dum-E’s got his claw on the fire extinguisher again and he’s about to douse the carpet.”
“What’s up, Rogers?” Mr. Stark asked, not looking at him and continuing to solder the small metal joint. “Wanted to see what it looks like in Death’s lair?” He was being a bit nasty, he knew.  Still, the accusation had stung.
“Smoked him, man,” Sam teased them both. “Hammer couldn’tve destroyed him any quicker.” He grinned back at Steve.  “And then Cap here says, ‘Hey, Sam and I are going for a run after school, want to come along?’ with those goddamn puppy eyes we all know nobody can resist!”
Tony’s eyes went wide, but he did as he was told.  That was interesting.  He was never all that good at taking orders without question in the field, but now he complied without protest, stripping his shirt off and letting it fall on the floor.
Rhodey shook his head, getting in the car. “That’s like the nicest kid.  I dunno what it is, maybe going to church on the regular, but he’s seriously just the nicest.  Like, you remember little Pete, on the cross country team with Sam and Steve? He transferred into our physics class like three weeks late, the wrong placement or something, and Jimmy just up and gives him copies of all his notes.  Just walks right up, says Steve was worried about the rookie on the team and pulled in a favor.  And the dude’s handwriting is like, perfect.”
“Just instagramming the waffles, Cap,” Peter told him.  “These are like my favorite breakfast, can I bring some back to May?”
Romeo had finished eating. He hopped up into Steve’s lap, pawed around a bit in uncomfortable places, and promptly fell asleep. Tony stared at the kitten, a strangely sour expression on his face.  “Tony, he’ll love you too, once he forgets the bath,” Steve told him, consolingly, trying not to flinch at the sharp claws.  “Besides, I’m probably just the warmest, what with the superserum and all. It’s not personal. Here, just pet him.”
Sometimes I feel like I’m all alone in the world.  I have great friends, don’t get me wrong. They’re the best.  Really. Like I said, they’re great. We’re basically Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lay down our lives for each other type shit.  And my mom tries her best.  It’s just been so long since we’ve had a real conversation, one where she was completely paying attention, and where she just—like, just really wanted to hear what I was saying, or—Christ, just how my day was.  Just stupid shit like if I got a good grade on a test or something.
Steve had been confident in her abilities, but what had Nat said that got the senator to back off so quickly?
Steve ended the call, enormously relieved.  Bucky would be okay. Nat would be able to fix it.  He’d never met someone more determined. He went back to the bedroom. Bucky hadn’t moved, so he grabbed a book to keep himself company.
Steve came out of the house in a long-sleeved Henley, although a shirt couldn’t exactly cover the puffy nick by his left cheekbone.
Tony’s mind raced.  A guy, with a male best friend who moved out of the country. Well, no guarantees that Flying had always been part of the school. Maybe they both moved at the same time, if he said his friends were new.  That.  Really didn’t help the odds.  That still left approximately half the school.
Tony pressed himself closer into Steve’s warmth.  “Stay.” Steve’s whole body relaxed. “Then you won’t have to wake up to check on me in the middle of the night.”
She ignored his joke, crossing the room to look closely at him.  “If anyone deserves a break, it’s you, Steve.  But I know what running away looks like. I know that’s what this is. I won’t stop you, I just wish you didn’t want to.” She took the hat from his hand and set it firmly on his head.  “Remember. Don’t run—walk.” She kissed his cheek and disappeared from his doorway.
Steve paused when he was right in front of him. “Stop me if I’m wrong,” he said, low. And then he was kissing him—he, Steve Goddamn Rogers was kissing him, kissing Tony, this was amazing.  This was everything.  Tony leaned in to get a better angle, pulling on Steve’s lip with his teeth, hands dragging Steve’s hips toward his. This was better than he’d ever hoped. Tony was flying high on endorphins and the taste of Steve’s tongue in his mouth when suddenly, he realized, oh Jesus, wait, did he mean…?
Steve is smiling.  Tony can tell. “Besides, the kid is pretty much a genius, right? Like you?” His voice is somehow warm, even over the shitty phone.
Tony thought of all the things he’d miss, now.  Stupid things.  Little things, that he hadn’t realized he wanted.  The way Steve’s eyes always got soft when Tony stole one of Steve’s shirts and wrapped himself up in it.  The little notes he left, doodled, around Tony’s workshop.  He’d miss waking up with him, kissing him goodbye before Steve went on a godawful run around Manhattan.
"He's not really that bad, sort of," Bruce halfheartedly defended him.  Then he made a face. "Well, that is, he sort of is, but..."
Bucky eyed him suspiciously for a minute and made a dissatisfied sort of noise in the back of his throat as he stood up.  He stepped into the bedroom to drop the towel in favor of a pair of sweats, not bothering to close the door. From inside the darkened room, he called back, “You know, I bet I just turn a garden hose on you when you’re wearing a tshirt and some tight jeans and Stark would claw his way through a rosebush to get to you.”
Their voices blurred into a drinking song Peggy had been teaching them recently, then faded as they made their way toward the cars.
Steve couldn’t look at him anymore.  “Because of the blueprints. I know I overstepped.  I’m really sorry. I am. I didn’t mean to, and I just—“
Flying he’d probably think Tony was trying to force his hand by asking that kind of question in public.  Cookies?  Pieter and Steve both baked, but not that many guys did. Chess?  Again…
Tony just stared at him. Who was this guy? Okay, now he was seriously going to have to have Jarvis find out more. He hadn’t been bothered when Happy said the searches turned up highly classified missions.  That wasn’t surprising, and it wasn’t very concerning, either.  Half Rhodey’s missions were highly classified, too.  But this guy… He’d get Jarvis on it right away.
“You don’t want to have sex?” Tony asked, pressing his hips down, finding pretty clear evidence that Steve did actually want to have sex.
“Is he… all alone?” Steve knew exactly what that felt like.  He’d never been more alone, he thought, than now.  When he was younger, before his mom died, she’d always been there for him.  Bucky had been by his side forever.  But now his mother was gone, and Bucky was battling his own demons, with Natasha’s help.  Not that he begrudged that—he was overjoyed to see his friend happy.  It helped assuage some of the guilt he felt.  He’d been the one calling the shots that day. And he got out without a scratch. It was Bucky who bore the brunt of the attack, who wore the literal scars. “Does he not have other family or close friends?” He didn’t mean to pry, but this wasn’t the Tony Stark that the world saw.
Tony’s toes started to tingle after a minute.  After another minute, just the tips of his fingers.  His movement was going to return to him.  With an enormous act of willpower, he forced his head down to see where his shirt was still unbuttoned.  He huffed a tiny laugh, as much as he could with his current inability to breathe.  The center of his reactor was flickering violently, the light intermittent, and less than the dead spaces in between.  Obie’d done real damage.
Steve just smiled, a real smile—and that was luminescent, the warm benevolence of a kind sun.  Tony didn’t think he’d ever seen anything quite that astoundingly lovely before, and it was addictive. He wanted to keep making it happen, make it happen for him, make Steve smile.  He needed it.
“I am, actually,” Tony started to say before noticing that the question wasn’t directed toward him. He closed his mouth so quickly his teeth clacked.
Tony squeezes the uniform through the package delivery slot.  It barely fits.  It’s a little bulkier than the eighties-style get up Steve was wearing a minute ago. He tries not to look at Steve’s body, but it’s impossible.  He’s still so beautiful.  He’s still so familiar.  Tony’s fingers ache to touch him. Steve straps on the new uniform.  Moves around, twists.  It’s perfect.  He fabricated it out of a design he’d had sitting around, the basis of a new Cap uniform.  Better protection and flexibility. More streamlined. Steve looks breathtaking in it, the plunging neckline not much protection, but once Steve commits to a design, there’s no budging him.  He sticks to it.  Once Steve commits to anything, Tony thinks.
Steve doesn’t move as Tony cleans the burn, has to scrub at it to remove the bits of spandex that melted into his flesh.  He doesn’t flinch.  He just watches Tony, careful, expressionless.  Tony would be confused by what’s going on in Steve’s brain, except he knows Steve, now.  That gentle blank expression is just camouflage.  He’s bleeding inside, a mess, shredded up.  Tony can’t decide how he feels about it.  Not glad, though.  It doesn’t make him happy.
“Pity,” Loki sniffed.  He shimmered again, and suddenly there were two Tony Starks in the room, one lying tangled up and relatively unclothed in Steve’s bed. “I could look like him if that would help, it’s what your heart desires.”
He returned to his book to calm himself, sketching the arc reactor he’d only seen in person twice. It was beautiful. It was perfect symmetry and balance. The aesthetic was incisive, intuitive. For being a piece of machinery, it was startlingly natural. He pulled apart the pieces in the next sketches, aligning them into a Fibonacci spiral, then expanding them to cover the page in fractals, then building them into a sort of modified tesseract, finally manipulating each fragment into something new—clearly the arc reactor, but something resembling a sun, surrounded by planets, moons held in tow around them.
means anything.” Rhodes knew how exacting command could be, how much guilt a man could carry when one of his own died.
An hour later, Tony had lost by over twenty points. Even though Steve had to awkwardly bend over to use the tiny golf club. Tony blamed losing his ball once to the duck pond to some high-school-date related PTSD, and maybe two more points for ogling Steve instead of concentrating, but still, Steve had handed him his ass.  The fucker was leading by a dozen points when he looked at #18 (which went between the rotating blades of the windmill, through the scary clown’s mouth—opening and closing like a gasping fish, around three corners, and over a timed drawbridge), lined up the shot cleanly and precisely, and sunk a hole in one.  It was a par-9.
Steve blinked.  Oh. Tony wasn’t into men. He’d clearly misread the situation entirely, projecting, thinking Tony wanted him when he was just showing Steve kindness. Besides, Tony was more than Steve would ever be, a genius, brilliant and handsome and capable, and Steve was just a lab rat. A soldier, discharged, with no real skill set and no future. Whatever he had imagined before, it was clear enough now. Tony wasn’t into men.  He didn’t want Steve. It hurt more than it should have and it wasn’t even personal. Just Steve’s idiot heart running away with him.
So he wasn’t being petulant, Steve told himself, as he stayed at home, reading Stark’s file over a cup of the same tragically weak coffee. SHIELD wasn’t doing anything with him anyway.  All he did was read files.  May as well do that from the privacy of his own goddamn home.
When Steve touches down, Tony’s waiting.  He puts out a hand.  Steve just hugs him instead, a real Steve Rogers hug that Tony is embarrassed to admit he melts into, just a little. Steve says, “I know it hasn’t even been a whole year. It feels like it’s been a long time.”
Tony looked at her, briefly, then back at the road.  They were driving to the first big competition, Tony had the robot loaded up and was preparing to drive alone when Natasha had swung her backpack into the back and climbed into the passenger seat.
“Uh, Merchant of Death here.  You know, you two should really read up more on recent events, you know?”
Steve looked up, knowingly. He nabbed a piece of chicken and handed over the rest of his bowl.  Tony and the kitten both sniffed the air.  He had to stifle a laugh.
Second Thanksgiving at my house, 8pm.  Just bring yourselves! Oh, and someone tell the Maximoff twins, would you?
Satisfied that the crystals were gone, Bucky plinked the spoon pointedly down into the dishwasher, grabbed the mug, and made his way over to the table.
Tony made a funny choking noise.  Probably laughing at him.  Tony loved teasing Steve about being a prude, which he wasn’t.  Hell, if Tony could only hear the things Steve wished he could do to him.
“I’m so glad you decided we were on speaking terms again, sir,” the AI replied.  Somebody didn’t like getting shut out.
Tony started to laugh. “Loki, right? I mean, there’s no way I end up in Captain America’s very pristine very virtuous bed if not for that asshole.  What a dick. Sorry, I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable, but,” he laughed again, “not exactly my fault here, Rogers.  And I’ve been trying, Pepper said I should try to play nicer.”
“No, Bucky.  You don’t get to do that.  I know why you were doing it, but you gotta get yourself that arm.  Nothing else.  Nat’s counting on you, so… Just go home.  I’ll be fine.”
A cheer went up from on the bridge, a howl that was very clearly Peggy Carter, ridiculous and British, a “Get it, Rogers!” from Sam.  Tony was fairly sure he could hear Pepper opening a pack of tissues she would undoubtedly be using to dab at the mascara her tears might threaten.
Obadiah chuckled again, dropping the book onto the table and taking the pair of needle nose pliers from his shirt pocket. He sat next to Tony on the couch, a horrible imitation of camaraderie. “You know I’d… I’d feel bad, if I thought I was cutting your life short.  But, like you said, you’ve only got a couple days left anyway.  I’ll just… make this,” he pulled the reactor partially out of the casing, “a little faster…” He poked at the remaining cell with the tip of the pliers, a grating noise as it scratched, damaging it.  It flickered erratically. He smiled, a shark’s smile.  And now Tony saw exactly what Steve had seen.  How had he known? Obadiah slotted the reactor back into his chest.  “Howard’s kid.  I hate to imagine what he’d think of you now. Still can’t quite live up to the Stark name.” Stane patted his shoulder in a fatherly way, still chuckling.  He put the rest of the sketchbook next to Tony on the couch, crumpled the one of himself, and threw it in the fireplace. He tapped on the reactor again with his pliers.  The last sectional light went out.
“I’m in DC. I told him I was going to DC to get in touch with a contact from my old unit.  What’s going on?” her voice was sharp now. Not panicked, but getting there. Her voice was low and level, like always, but he could hear the nerves.
“And when you’ve settled, you can clean up this mess,” he said, indicating the shards of red and green glass covering the floor.  He turned and went back down to his workshop, flipping on the ACDC as he went.  Even if Steve was pretty, Tony had more important things to deal with. Things that wouldn’t talk back.
The water turned off. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and pushed the door open.  The door to the bathroom was open, the room illuminated, and the sounds of splashing and cursing came from behind it. It didn’t sound like fun swearing, more like frustration.  Steve crossed the floor quickly.
Steve woke up with Tony curled around his torso.  It was the first time since he’d been frozen that it felt natural to wake up in this century.  He pulled Tony in to his body, kissing him gently. And this was all he needed, it was like breathing.  He could feel Tony, hard along his thigh, and he had woken up hard himself.  But kissing Tony was more than he’d thought he’d ever get, and he was happy to bask in the warmth of him.
Steve was still holding it in his hand. He clicked it locked. “Tony, I…” He didn’t know what to say. He’d miss him? It seemed inappropriate given that Tony had just let him down easy. He’d be back? Steve wasn’t sure when that would be.  Or if Tony would want him back, after last night. And with the secrets he’d kept from him. Well... “Thank you.”
“I love you, Steve.  I’m in love with you. I’d fly through space for you without a second thought, darling.  You didn’t need an Asgardian for that.”
Apparently it was too late, Tony thought, his breath seizing in his lungs.  Apparently his heart was already broken. Thinking that tonight, he'd go to sleep, truly alone.  Tomorrow he'd wake up, and Steve wouldn't be there. There was no oxygen left in the room.  There was no point. He’d read somewhere that the pain receptors in the brain for emotional pain were the same as for physical pain. Now he knew it to be true. This was pain beyond imagining. He didn’t regret it exactly. Steve was worth it, every time.  But it hurt.  Worse than anything he could remember, and Tony’d been through a few rough patches. A deep part of him wanted to crawl his way into a bottle, drink it all away, but an even deeper need within him didn’t want to disappoint Steve still.  There’s the irony.
“Brock. Rumlow.” Rhodey said. Tony knew him, of course.  A little. Rumlow had studied with Rhodey for the SATs for at least two months, trying to better his score. He was funny, but it could be a little mean sometimes.  Tony’d just figured it was something like his own humor, covering up for his own inadequacies. Hey, Tony was introspective—he knew what he was doing with his deflecting type of humor.
episode on Syria instead.” The projections disappeared and Martin Smith’s voice started in the background as Obie’s Italian leather shoes came scuffing into view down the staircase. “Let him in.”  The door popped open.
Steve trained an evaluative eye on Tony, judging him, scrutinizing.  The intensity was staggering.  Tony looked away.
