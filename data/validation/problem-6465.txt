“You ever been to Denny’s?” Tony asked him, leaning against the side of the car while Steve went through the motions of filling up the tank.  “I never have.  And I never will.”
He enjoyed the work of Starfleet.  Sometimes it was tedious—certainly, operating under official guidelines would have worn down his sharp edges, stifled his creative mind until he became dull and uninspired—but mostly, it was a life worth living.
Resistance proved futile.  Even Natasha voted in favor of the stop; Bruce, alone, abstained.  Even knowing that ten future dollars equaled seventy-five real cents—and one real dollar equaled a standard seat at a baseball game—Steve felt the pain of sixty dollars in admissions.  To his credit, Tony
“Can confirm,” Tony said, already snooping through the backpack in Steve’s arms, ignoring his frown.
dying.  “I’m not dying,” he said out loud.  He watched from his periphery, not even daring to turn his head, as Marker suddenly turned and shoved his head back into the pool, emerging with the pole between his teeth.
—and arrive at the present moment, where Tony Stark stood in his laboratory, scraping a soft-pawed hand over his benumbed chest, careful not to press on it, spark any enmity between him and the heartless metal monster inside him.  The parasite clung tightly to his ribs, which meant only hard pressure really counted: a hug would not necessarily leave him teary-eyed, but a direct blow could be lethal, and given that the blue light was essentially a
The Nibirans clucked.  They hooted.  The elder muttered something that sounded disparaging and without consonants.
Shaking his head, Steve said, “Bruce, get the knife,” and Bruce took off like a shot, somehow both falling and not-falling out of his chair.
“Accident, mostly,” Sojef admitted.  “We first looked for uninhabited worlds with Earthlike properties, but few were so isolated they would not be found.  We began to look for an unlikely home.”
Tony looked at the glass windows, at Steve and Clint, seated on a couch.  “Yeah,” he said, losing track of the question in favor of watching Steve with Thallium curled up against him, her little horned head resting near his heart.  “I am,” he added, looking at Rhodes.  “I’ve got everything I need.  Except my
Steve, who had been passing the long boards carefully up to the roofers, sauntered over to tell Tony, “That takes all the fun outta it.”
Steve sighed, steered him adamantly away from the cooking area, and sat him at the table instead.  “No, I’m a
He could not accept it.  It did not matter that he had fought an alien army on behalf of a country claiming to be his own.  None of it or them resonated with him.  Even their voices sounded wrong, pulling him out of the reality he was trying to accept.
Sitting along with the Nibirans around the great ancestral fire of the sleeping volcano, Tony could not help but think about how strangely familiar the scene felt, like stepping into the caves at Lascaux.  They did not look like exactly like Terrans, but the resemblance was still striking enough that he could imagine them in Terran roles, a society that had no need for starships when food was plentiful and the rules were simpler.  But life propagated.  Life always wanted
All throughout the journey from hospital to his own home, Tony yearned for the familiar golden glow in the corner of the room, the black eyes to meet his own and assure in their own incalculable confidence,
faster than a speeding bullet—but he was a whizz on the rebound.  As the green streak of light sliced through an invisible pitcher and smashed into the fence, Steve caught the rebound.  He lobbed it back as gently as he dared in Bruce’s direction.  Bruce chose life: he scurried out of the way, and the ball bounced harmlessly past him.  “Come on,
Steve turned it back, holding the dial to prevent Tony from making another unwanted intervention.  The news anchors had already moved on.  Steve sighed in annoyance, sitting back.  Inspired, he reached for his pocket, pulled out his journal, and thumbed to a fresh page.
—” blustered Tony, while Thor grinned that same close-mouthed grin.  “God.  You really are a big brother.  I now know why Loki is the way he is.”
rather than the heart of the matter, and cut himself off mid-word when Clint dumped an entire pale of water over his head.
Stovok held out his own PADD, a Personal Access Display Device capable of sending messages at faster-than-light speeds—perfect for the traveling starship crewman.  “Captain Carter has requested our presence on the bridge.  It has been marked
Good thing, too, Tony thought, watching him effortlessly navigate the foreign terrain, while carrying Dr. Banner, no less.  Vulcans were inhumanly strong—born on a desert world, they had to be.  “Let me know if you need a break,” Tony offered.  Stovok looked at him, measuring him, before deciding he was unmeasurable, or simply not worth his time, shaking his head and moving along.  Puffing up his chest, Tony strode confidently in his wake, intending to overtake him, when another, louder rumble of thunder stilled him.  “We’re in for a storm,” he said.
“Like a plant,” Clint Barton chimed in, wolfing down another bite of shawarma.  “Still need soil,” he added.
, he thought, dragging it towards him so Marker did not try to bludgeon him with it.  He slid it through his hands until he could grasp the net at the base and unscrew it.  Moving slowly but intently, he planted the stick on the ground and used it to leverage himself upright.
that made Tony want to snarl back at him.  Or just shrink under the bed and not be seen anymore.  He looked away.  “Coma-dream,” he rasped.
“My shoes cost more than your rent,” Tony said, in an unguarded moment of good humor.  “Thanks, but—no thanks.  How much do I owe you, Aislinn, darling?”
Thankfully, Tiberius still loved to hear himself talk, and Tony was in a mood to sit back and listen.  He was not really listening until Tiberius said, “Is that what I think it is?”
“This is how we handle it on the farm,” Clint huffed, carrying the newly refilled, sloshing bucket over.  “You know, when shit’s misbehaving, you just,” he heaved the bucket, and Steve just stood, impassively, as Clint dumped it over his head.  “You just do that.”  And he dropped the bucket again.  “Now, I don’t wanna give you head trauma—”
Stovok stared him down.  Tony could almost see the colors of his thoughts—the orange of frustration, the violet of his rigid moral code.  He stopped himself from reaching up to confirm his suspicions.  “The sooner we comply, the sooner you may return,” Stovok negotiated calmly.
Hey, you. 🐼❤️ I have all the excuses for the slight delay in updating, but also, I present none of them, because I'd much rather just get back to this beautiful story and have a great time together, and you all have been really lovely about understanding that sometimes, life is just hard. But, hey, sometimes, I have a chapter! Now is that sometimes.
had been “Prepare for nothing, hope for something.”  Sparks did not fly in predictable patterns.  All that really mattered was the ignition.  He loved the ignition.  The moment when jet fuel caught fire and launched him into free fall.
“It is, of course, an absolute pleasure to meet you,” their guide—a man named Carlton, who seemed unbothered by the belated hour—simpered.  “I must say—you are even more impressive in person.”
Downing his drink proved an unwise error: Tony was fuzzy-headed when Steve materialized in front of him, between one blink and the next.  “You okay?” Steve asked.
But, I shall make it worth your while with all the fun in store, and still more coming soon! Thanks again for all the wonderful comments, you are truly amazing, and even just silent hits are spectacular! Thank you, champions! Carry on!
He wondered if it was beautiful, being able to reach out into the darkness and light someone else’s candle.
Tony did ask around the fifth or sixth or maybe seventeenth chant: “So, which one gets the lollipop?”
One last shallow breath.  Steve let the shield slide down, slip free.  Tony continued to grip his wrist, a stabilizing force.
Tony got to his feet.  He ignored the urge to inject himself directly between the Captain and her First Officer, setting himself beside Stovok.  He had nothing to fear.  Stovok favored him.  Tony had nothing to
“It’s also an empty brick building,” Natasha chimed in, tucking an arm around Tony’s in a familiar way, stilling his pacing, “that sentimental old men revere.”
“It’s hard to give up the god-thing, isn’t it?” Tony mused, then ducked quickly as Thor ejected a Gorn into their ship.  “Thor,” he complained, loudly, even as the hissing creature righted itself carefully.  It looked at them, claws uplifted, and Stovok
Tony toyed with a spoon.  “You were robbed, Peter Pan.  Or maybe you’re more of a—Benjamin Button type.”  Laying down the spoon again, he elaborated, “Either way—you’re not getting it back.  That time.  That—bright-eyed wonder.  And that’s. . . .”  He shook his head, met Steve’s eye, his own still bloodshot with fatigue.  “That’s
And drifted, allowing one arm to settle around Tony, because Tony was there and easy to hold.  There was something burning inside him, something that wanted to be warm and could not get there, but Steve refused to retreat inward, because at least he could feign warmth, this way.
“I hate you,” Iron Man breathed, many hours later, voice heavy in the helmet, which he had not removed, even once.
“Three million in backpay,” Tony went on.  “At least a hundred on the table, in sponsorships, donations.”
“Sure thing, big guy,” Tony said, back to sulking in his arms, apparently.  “Can somebody turn the grill off?”
Steve looked over as Natasha pulled up to a ticket booth.  The ticketer blinked twice at them, then waved them along without a word.  Natasha obliged.
“I would like to feed the hogs,” Thor said, his voice resonating impressively throughout the African hall, setting off the monkeys in a spirited display of hooting and jabbering.
Like Iodine, Tony had not spent much time with either hatchling.  Getting too close to Snow was a no-go; that meant waiting, hoping the hatchlings would come to him.  He came to long for their intrusions, for any proof that he was still worthy of a dragon.  Even just a little one.
Clint just moaned, “Popcorn,” while Bruce folded down on the grass a short distance away, nibbling on his own bag.  Thor shook the remnants of bag number two into his mouth without a word.  At the rate they were going, they would pack away the rest before the movie even started, Steve thought, shaking his head in wonder.
Bruce stared at the flask.  Steve felt the palpable hunger in Tony’s eyes as he, too, stared at the flask.
“Well,” J.A.R.V.I.S. began mildly, standing about six feet back from Steve, who was deep-cleaning the self-cleaning oven, for some godforsaken reason.
Hulk grunted again, slightly louder than before.  Clint, who had miraculously stolen the hose from Thor, foamed him up in a rainbow-colored soap, designed, Steve surmised, for cleaning cars.  The Hulk made an agreeable humming sound.  Thor, also covered in the blue-purple-pink wash, laughed heartily.
“Salt of the Earth,” Steve repeated, so very deadpan he almost seemed himself, before sighing nasally—gross—and setting the cookie box on the counter.  “If you want cookies—”
“We were more than friends,” Stovok said, pacing out the words.  “We were. . . .”  Then he commanded, “F.R.I.D.A.Y., resume.”
Tony pivoted audibly on the rocks towards Bruce, who was sitting next to him.  “How much weed did you put in that cake?”
“I saw the footage,” Hill clarified.  “Of the attack.  On the city.”  Steve wondered how blank his own expression might have been, that she felt the need to clarify.  “If you’re worried, Rogers, you shouldn’t be.  No one’s going to lock you up.”
The worst day of Steve’s life began like any other day, waking up in their shared bed, oblivious to any abnormalities until he went downstairs to fix himself breakfast and came back up to find Tony insensate.  So much damage had occurred in that short span that—
Steve—followed.  Tony stopped, tensing all over, until Steve stepped up beside him.  “Don’t walk behind me,” Tony quipped, almost playful but still a bit too flat to be sincere.
“Owie,” Tony moaned, in a masculine, dignified fashion, lying on a lounge chair.  “I’m dying, Steve.”
“They certainly don’t want us taking anything away from them,” Romanova mused.  Tony leaned forward a little, the better to see her.  “It’s far from the first time an alien race has tried to protect itself from outsiders.”
“It’s five o’clock somewhere,” Natasha dismissed, a distinctly deeper note to her voice, the Russian drawn out.
As they exited the hot wings bar, Bruce took Tony gently aside, grasped him by both shoulders, and said seriously, “Take me back to the hotel, or I will Hulk out right now.”
Steve’s hand lingered a moment.  Then, he said, “You do deserve peace, Tony.  And I will help you get there.”
Tony shrugged.  “We came, we saw, we—”  He paused as their otherworldly companion looked back at them expectantly.  “Perhaps we should talk about this later.”
,” Tony insisted, making a successful grab and a triumphant noise.  “If I get sick, blame it on Steve, it’s what I always do.”
“They’ll wreck you, if they don’t kill you outright,” Clint Barton had said, indicating his hearing aids.  He had added, “I can still feel them.  When they talk.  You don’t need ears to hear them talk.”
, Tony thought, and jogged towards them as fast as his uncooperative legs would allow.  Snow shook off, unfazed, but Steve was moving fast, still holding onto his neck and his dragon.  “Steve!” Tony rasped, voice dry from standing silent and still for so long.  Steve did not pause, entering the house.
Picking up the soaked hatchling, Tony shushed, “Shh, shh, it’s okay, you’re okay.”  Cadmium screeched.  Actinium and Curium followed Marker, who growled at them, as if to say,
Having a dragon at one’s side represented social status, too.  Those who had dragons beside them were considered very special, elevated above the average.  Simply having the love of a dragon was a rare and exciting thing.
—”  Any further tirade was lost on a moan, thin, spiraling, but Natasha twisted the edge, ignoring Steve’s own bark of,
Back to the wall, Thor snored, gripping the smaller and less intimidating version of Ol’ Pokey in a bear hug.  “Damn bear,” Tony grunted.  “Bet you ten bucks Romanoff got it off the plane.”
He blamed Gravemarker for it all—the dragon in the woods, the painstaking PT, the distance from Steve.
It was painful to wait, but he made himself wait, until darkness began to fall and he dared to scramble to his feet, brushing himself off frantically.  He felt stiff and sore, but a light jog warmed him up quickly, and he soon broke into a dead run, desperate to get back to—
“Anybody else getting a strong sense of déjà vu?” Tony mused, as their unarmed transport vessel approached the Briar Patch.
Steve finally looked at him.  Tony spat, “I hate you.  I goddamn hate you.  I hope they all goddamn leave.”
“I’m not doing this again,” Steve said anyway, just so Tony could know he was not some kind of pony to be trekked around.
He barely noticed the shield slipping away from his loose grip until she had pulled it fully away from him.  Defeated, he looked around the empty room—no monsters, no people waiting to escort him politely back to a room and explain that he really, truly, was not going home—and shook his head.
.  “J.A.R.V.I.S., grab one of the—heating pads, you know where they’re at.”  The suit vacated the couch, and although Tony stepped around so he could fix the straps on the splint.  Steve immediately tried to thwart him, one big hand resting directly over the undone straps.  “You let
“Adults only,” Tony agreed, wagging his eyebrows.  “Bruce found a place.  Right, Bruce?” he added, sticking his head back in the car, where Bruce was cowering in the backseat.  Popping back out of the car, Tony prompted the assembly, “Somebody wanna fly with Thor?”
Happy sighed.  Grimly, he said, “Yeah, well.  Let me know when you’re done runnin’ away with the circus.  If you think I’m mad, wait ‘til Ms. Potts has her moment.”
“Think I—mm.  Yeah, side was not a good idea.”  Grimacing, Tony started to roll onto his back, only to be intercepted by a series of clicks.  “Wow.  Christmas miracle,” he huffed, returning to his side, Tellurium stretching out at his back.  “Ohhhh, ow.  Killing me.  My back.  Is me.”
Tony huffed, then crawled between the two front seats and twisted the dial.  “There,” he said, sitting back.  “Everybody loves Gregorian chants.”
Tony Stark gripped his chest in fright, then looked up and dropped his hand.  He scowled at Steve.  “Don’t
J.A.R.V.I.S.’s announcement of a knock on the door made Tony stiffen, but Clint answered it, greeting Thor with a huge hug.  “Ey!  You made it!”
There was no reprieve.  “Just the guy I wanted to see,” Clint greeted, clasping him on the shoulder.  “Listen, I know this is your and Stark’s moment, but I have to ask: can we get cake?”
Stovok gave him a very unimpressed look, even for a half-Vulcan.  Then he slithered into the hole in the ground.  Stupid Vulcan.  Fearless bastards.  It was no surprise that Stovok had excelled in Starfleet—he was born to be excellent.
Tony shrugged, then began walking along, encouraging Steve to do the same.  “The history books leave out many sins.  Captain America’s bastard brother doesn’t exactly sell
“I don’t think you’re the hugging type,” Natasha went on, stepping forward.  When she was close enough to do so, she rested a hand over his wrist.  Her fingers were surprisingly warm against his skin.
In his dreams, Tony walked alongside Marker through a desert, one hand on Marker’s golden hide.  They had long conversations, talking about the weather and the future.  In an accent so thick with his clicks and warbles they nearly overshadowed his words, dream-Marker responded to him.
Barnes placed a hand on his knee and squeezed it.  “You know these guys.  They just want to keep us on our toes.  Keep us afraid of them, so they can operate outside the rule of law.”
“You have shown great courage, Captain,” Thor pronounced.  “You should make a fine addition to the . . . Warriors Four?”  He smiled to himself, a private jest.  “A name worth improving upon.”
Clint scrambled up like a greyhound on the run, all long limbs and yelping relief.  To Tony’s surprise, it was Natasha at his heels, looking calm, cool, and collected.  “When did
, but: “Fury should’a locked me up.”  That surprised even him, and for a long moment, the only sounds were the glacial waters, the glacial winds, and the glacial breaths.
“Perhaps,” Sojef allowed.  “But the plant is harmless to the body.  It merely induces a short retrograde amnesia.  Trusting you not to reveal our location . . . would have put our people at risk.  Forgive us, but our faith in Terrans is . . . somewhat limited,” admitted Sojef.
“I always thought you’d be a coffee guy,” Steve acknowledged Tony.  They were seated a short distance away, at a bar.
Thor followed Tony’s pointing finger, let out a huge laugh, and said, “Mountains, you call those mountains?”  He held up a hand, and, instinctively, Steve knew what was going to happen, knew
Sometimes, Steve wondered what it would have been like to have grown up in Ireland.  To have been surrounded by family, instead of growing up in an empty home, his Ma—God rest her soul—always away, returning late and leaving early, to help save other souls.  In a wry and oddly self-aware manner, Steve reckoned that he would have sat on barn rafters and dreamed of leaving it all behind for the city, to go somewhere something was happening, and do the good he was born to do.
About-facing slowly, he held still as she walked towards him, taller at the shoulder than he was fully upright.
Just as the music began to swell with the opening credits, Tony returned, dragging a noisy little wagon behind him.  There were twelve bags of popcorn on it.  “Voila,” he said.
Then he forced his fingers to release his shirt, tried to take in a breath.  It did not help.  He tried again.  The results were infuriatingly paradoxical: his chest expanded, but he did not feel the relief of a breath.  He felt only the urgency of the lie, of Everything is Fine.
,” Tony whined, gripping his head where the goose-egg wanted to form from Carter’s closed fist.  “Pack a
The Nibirans stared.  “Friendly,” he said, despite appearances, desperate appearances.  “We come in peace.”
“This used to be the ugliest outpost in the Federation,” Tony went on, waving his brandy freely, careful not to spill it.  “Can you believe that?  Used to rain three-hundred-and-sixty-five days a year.  Which is amazing, because Risian years are only two-hundred-and-eighty-days long.”  Snickering at his own joke, Tony took an ill-timed sip of brandy.
“All right,” Steve cut off.  “I get it.  I’m a dumb cuss who doesn’t know monkey peanuts from ice cream peanuts anymore.  I wish I could drink.  Anything I miss?”
“I don’t got any plans tomorrow,” Steve said evenly.  He saw some of the self-loathing retreat from Tony’s expression, replaced by hopeful curiosity.  “If you’re free.”
Once he was sure he would not have a heart attack, he let go of the hatchlings and tapped Marker’s wing.  Marker lifted it obligingly.  Tony blew hard on Actinium’s snout—the hatchling released him—and got to his feet.  Both hatchlings trampled after him, claws clicking on the floor.  Tony turned to them, one finger upraised in warning.  “
—Happy stood up, lurched around the table, and grabbed the back of Tony’s shirt, hauling him into his chest for an embrace.  It was three seconds long, and Tony barely reciprocated, only patting Happy once on the side as Happy returned to his seat, but Steve did not imagine the sheen on Tony’s eyes or the way he avoided looking at them, glancing around the park.
“‘Maria.’  And that’s all you’ll get out of me.”  And he strode ahead to catch up to Natasha, after all.
,” Tony snapped, thumping on the window.  Clint turned the car back off.  Looking back at Steve, Tony gestured ahead.  “After you, my dear.”
Steve’s heart picked up.  “They got rid of polio?” he repeated, unable to keep a relieved edge out of his voice.
Steve found some peace under the stairs, sitting on the cool porch, resenting the cool night more than he should.
Natasha followed him outside.  She watched him retrieve his bike, gripping it in both hands impotently.  “Leave me,” Steve rasped.
.  “Here,” Steve insisted, graciously cupping both hands under Bruce’s foot and boosting him up onto a support beam.  Bruce scrambled for purchase, offering Steve a shaky smile once he was up.  “Don’t fall,” Steve reminded him.  Bruce nodded, gripping the wooden support beam tightly.
“At least,” Steve replied grimly.  He would not kick up a fuss.  If he wanted to avoid the cold shock of being out in the real world, he should have stayed home.
And here we are! Back at it again. I still have plenty of ideas for this story and nothing but warmth and enthusiasm for it. Might be slow and steady for a while, but I do hope you enjoy and I thank you again for your tremendous support. You have been above and beyond what I have expected, and I really do hope you have been well.
Tony knocked on the door.  When no one answered, he turned to Steve, who reached for the key in his pocket, surprised to find it had survived the journey.
.  “I was in Hell,” he announced, surprised at how heavy his own voice was, anchored down to something.  He was exhausted.  But he was alive.  A slightly delirious, extremely painful giggle bubbled out of him.  “I think they made me the King.”
Natasha smiled a little, that small, almost familiar smile that made him feel more at home.  “Anyone stuck with Stark for two days is bound to go crazy.”
“I’m actually appalled it took you this long to notice.”  He finally stopped stealing Steve’s fries to work on his own burger.  Steve ignored his own food completely, laser-focused.  “Of course I am.  I’m an unstable mutating radioactive element.  It’s my job to rock the zeitgeist.”  Taking a bite, he gestured eloquently with a hand, indicating the park.
“We don’t have to talk about it.”  Tony held his ground stiffly, torn between retreating to patch himself up and swallowing his
Steve thought about it—lounging in the grass, sipping lemonade, whiling away the beautiful day—before shaking his head.  “Nah,” he said cheerfully.  “Not Irish if I did.”  And he marched back off to work.
Both Happy and Steve stared at him.  Tony just said, “Don’t ask questions you don’t want answers to.”
, he thought suddenly, leaning back against a rocky outcropping, taking in the scene, four men braced against the elements.
Tony knelt down and tried to look Steve in the eyes, but they were glazed, unfocused and empty. He needed to snap out of it. Tony would give him time to do so, knowing the pain of flooding memories first hand, when he had lost his own memories not so long ago, it seemed. With deep worry he focused on the man before him, placing his hands gently on either side of Steve’s face and ensuring his head was raised, unable to bear him looking so helpless.
“W-what!?” Killgrave couldn’t believe his eyes. He couldn’t believe that his perfect plan was falling apart right in front of him.
“No one asked you!” Steve used his shield to deflect a ray from its palm, but that was the rest of the holo-shields energy used, and it began to deplete and fizzle out. “And you’re not, Tony is human, and he has a heart!”
“Bucky, drop!” He yelled as loud as he could, watching the boy fly further and further away from him.
Steve looked up and at that moment Tony could’ve sworn Steve’s eye colour was different. He knew it so well after staring eye to eye with him on countless occasions, his eyes seemed lighter in colour, a pale blue rather than azure.
Steve brought Tony closer. There was something about what he had just said to him that made his heart flutter in return, he could feel it drum quickly, and rather than kissing him right away, he pressed the tip of his nose to the shell of Tony’s ear.
“It’s you… It’s you again,” he blabbered. That exchange of stares when he had woken up was enough to tell him that was the man he was searching for. “I knew you weren’t dead! Actually no, I thought you were dead, I’m not going to lie to you, but I still hoped that it wasn’t real… And you’re alive, look at you!” he exclaimed, now recharged and full of energy.
“A little sore.” Tony pouted, wriggling his derriere. “My battle wounds don’t hurt as much, but we’re in a hospital, I’ll patch them all up.”
“Yeah, I saw.” Tony rubbed the back of his head and got to his feet. His helmet was still in the room, and he needed it to keep safe.
Everyone jumped away from their little huddle and grabbed their things, ready to track down Tony and that robot.
Steve turned his head to look at Natasha; he knew from personal experience with the Guardian that he wasn’t an easy fight. Russia’s equivalent to Captain America was never easy, but they had history, a history that Steve didn’t know all that well. That being said, he knew little of Natasha’s past given her need to keep it largely a secret.
“Oh… Never mind,” Tony brushed Steve off, proud of his own joke as he waited to get to the basement level, tapping his foot impatiently to the elevator music.
As soon as the doors opened he saw his lab in disarray, the bots fallen, the screens flickering to life, a red flashing light and siren going on and off until Tony stepped inside himself and turned it off by commanding so. Seeing his bots lifeless made his chest tighten. Stricken with panic, he went from one to the other, seeing that they all had been taken down.
“Oh yeah, where is Doom? Where is Reed Richards?!” Tony asked, firing the repulsor blast only for it to bounce off the same sort of invisible barrier.
Tony, his body fought more, it pushed against the thoughts and commands in his head, but just at that moment there was a loud BOOM from behind them. The windows shattered with the sound – glass flying outward in every direction. The foundation of the building started to shake, the insides collapsing, but it certainly didn’t help that Steve and Tony where fighting right by the outside wall of factory. Salvation and safety was just meters away, all Tony had to do was lift them both and move – but the walls came tumbling down. Steve could see the high chimneys begin to collapse, coming straight for them both.
Taskmaster’s already fragmented mask took the brunt of the fall, clashing with the pavement beneath him and completely shattering the right side.
Steve’s chest hitched with each moan and gasp, the flexing in his arms as he worked against Tony’s grip and a desire to keep still and remain silent, trying to remain as inconspicuous as they were. Tony read  it all as he slipped lower and eventually couldn’t pin Steve’s arms anymore  so he let go in favour of curling his fingers around the lower edge of Steve’s shirt and lifts it only to discard it to the side.
Doom was showing no signs of tiring as he waved his arms, each blast becoming more powerful than the next, carving deep into the once spotless marble floors.  Every hit Tony tried to shoot was deflected and sent back, it simply wasn’t powerful enough. He needed all of his power for something powerful enough to surpass those blasts.
“And neither did you, Tony.” Reed said, brewing a fresh pot of coffee and stretching his arm over to hand Tony the same mug he had been using for days, realising that it had an extreme sentimental value to him. “Self deprecation should be avoided, I know for some obscure reason that you blame yourself for this but this isn’t your fault, it’s Zola’s. You shouldn’t suffer for what he’s done.”
“Listen, I know it sounds crazy, but you need to believe me Tony.” Steve said, imploring Tony for at least a little understanding, consideration or even belief.
With a heavy sigh Steve reluctantly nodded, placing the pencil down and scooting out his chair slowly so that Tony could take the appropriate steps back. “Only if they’re the ones with white chocolate stars on the top.”
The voices in his head weren’t getting any quieter, despite the calm state his Captain was in. The constant ringing and yelling, the pleas for help, the unrelenting weight of blame that he had carried from the day that he had returned home with Steve was getting heavier and heavier.
Steve could feel a drop of rain from his wet hair slide down his temple as he crouched down by the entrance, continuing to maintain some sort of stealth whilst he carried on searching for Tony. He was sure that the man was at least headed to the factory, so he had hoped that the conflict hadn’t taken him too far away.
Steve crawled into the large fortress of pillows and saw Tony, curled up in a huge duvet, sitting cross legged with an attempt at looking somewhat regal.
The Captain’s eyes widened, his head began to spin and there were images of him saying those very words to a man in a domino mask swirling in a pool of memories.
“Chief wants to see you.” She pointed to the office that overlooked the entire room, a large painted window with ‘Chief Fury’ written in bold, gold writing stood before them.
It wasn’t the first time that the Purple Man had managed to use Tony as his puppet. “Iron Man, Tony, you can fight this!” Steve yelled, just as he had done during their last battle with the Purple Man. Steve reached around for his shield, grabbing it from the magnetic strapping on his back and quickly ducking behind it, using it to bide himself some time to get to his feet.
Peatra’s job now was to implement his will against (what he was certain would be) the vociferous protests of the Stark High Council. His will ordered the cremation of Toni’il’s body, immediately and without examination. It was not so odd for royalty to make such a request; his own parents and grandparents had insisted on the same hands-off approach to their post-mortem arrangements. It also instated Peatra as Queen Regent until her and Toni’il’s heir was of age. The heir, of course, was the child of Peatra and Hapi, a bright little three-year-old girl with dark enough hair and brown enough eyes to pass as Toni’il’s even though she had inherited her mother’s pink skin and her father’s dimpled smile.
Tony entrusts his heart to. Steve will be careful with him where others weren’t. Steve will accept Tony’s
“You’ve gotta let him stay, Cap! Please!” Peter said, whirling around and begging like a kid who’d brought a puppy home to his mom. “He can obviously earn his keep, and I
Steve laughed, and Tony couldn’t help it. He reached up to cup Steve’s jaw in his hand, trace the curve of his smile with the pad of his thumb. No one had ever looked at him so softly. No one had ever touched him so carefully, as Steve ran his hands up Tony’s thighs, over his waist and back, until they rested flat against his spine. His hands felt as big and warm as Tony had imagined they would. Steve was so close, now, he blurred in Tony’s vision, so Tony had to shut his eyes, and his hands slid into Steve’s soft golden hair, and
Steve lifted the hand that wasn’t clutching Tony’s and stroked it down the side of Tony’s face, from his hairline to his jaw, before resting it against his cheek. Tony sighed, his eyes fluttering shut for just a moment. All traces of cold had fled: warmth flooded his body from every place Steve’s skin touched his.
But mostly he was trying to wrap his mind around this whole new version of Tony he was seeing, this secretive, authoritative Tony who’d had a life filled with people and experiences before he’d ever found his way to Steve’s ship. Steve was aching, suddenly, with the desire to know all the things he didn’t. To know Tony inside and out; to know things no one else knew about him.
“You didn’t!” said Tony. He patted gingerly at his ribs, which Bruce had wrapped with compression bandages. “I stretched the wrong way, that’s all. I’m fine.”
“If it affects how we enter Stark, how we land, how we proceed from here,” said Natasha, “then it has everything to do with this.”
Steve sighed, hauled him to his feet, and guided him into an empty chair. The Stark looked around at him with a startled grin that swiftly turned into an appreciative once-over.
He couldn’t pretend he missed being old, but he did miss being able to see his experience in the mirror. His Mark had stayed, luckily. He’d been nervous about that; his sleeping, uninhabited vessel was identical to his original body in every way except its lack of scars and blemishes, and its lack of a Mark. But as soon as his consciousness woke in the new body, the Mark appeared in the same spot where it’d always been.
Sam, sitting next to her with an arm draped over her shoulders, disguised his laugh as a cough. The rest of the crew averted their eyes as Tony had sighed and turned to Steve.
The way they got by on the Nomad, ever since Steve cut ties with the military, was by traveling the galaxies and bartering services in exchange for whatever they needed: food, supplies, cash if they could get it and had time to spend it. Cash had limited use, as there was no system of physical currency that was shared across the Intergalactic Federation; each world had its own. But using Links – the digital currency that could be spent on any Federation planet – was out of the question. Links could be traced. And Steve did not want to be found.
The Hydra’s “death” tipped the scales in Stark’s favor, and as Steve’s procession picked their way across the battlefield – Rodos clearing a path, the Hulk cradling Tony very gently in his gargantuan arms, Steve and his crew straggling along after – their allies were mopping up the last of the Kree. They’d won.
Overnight, Jan and JARVIS had gotten them far away from Centuri-Six. By the time he and Tony made it to the bridge, the rest of the team was already gathered there. The crew was so tense no one even bothered to waggle an eyebrow or make a cheesy innuendo when Steve and Tony walked in, disheveled and wearing bruises in the shape of each other’s mouths. That, more than anything else, told Steve something was wrong.
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony said. He tugged Steve’s hand off his hip and poured lube onto it, slathering it over Steve’s fingers before guiding them between his legs.
“You know I can put the armor on in pieces, right? I could, for example, wear the gauntlets and nothing else.”
The Hydra roared, and with the earsplitting, thunderous sound came a jet of explosive energy. At the last minute, Iron Man collided with the side of the Hydra’s head, throwing off its aim and sending the bulk of its shot into the air. Still, Steve was blown backward, as were a good number of soldiers. His armor held, and his shield held, and he managed to control his fall so that Natasha stayed protected and he didn’t land on her. But if Tony hadn’t sabotaged that shot, Steve didn’t know what sort of shape he’d be in.
Toni’il wasn’t meant for this life, cloistered away in a palace. He needed to be part of the world, really part of it: creating things, helping people, making the universe a better place. Peatra would take good care of Stark – the best care, in fact. But Toni’il had exhausted what challenges this tiny moon could offer him. He’d learned all he could learn here. It was time to move on.
Tony almost said, but then he realized Peter’s eyes were fixed on the shining circle of light emanating from Tony’s chest, where the outer casing of his artificial heart protruded slightly from his body.
“Uh, Cap?” he said. “Starks are, like, centuries ahead of us technologically. Maybe I should go take a look. He could be really helpful… you know I’ve had to scrounge for parts, I can’t always find the best stuff, and this is an old ship….”
“Tony, we’re a crew full of outlaws and traitors. We’re all running from something. Why would we judge you for that?”
“Okay,” he said. “We’ll land. We get what we need and we get off the planet as fast as we can. Tony, Peter – how long do you think it’ll take to make the repairs you need to make?”
Steve groaned and licked his lips. “Gorgeous,” he mumbled. Tony had to hold his breath. Steve explored him with both hands: one to wrap around the shaft, and one to play with his balls. If Steve’s hands had felt big on Tony’s back, that was nothing to how they felt now. Steve gave his cock a long, slow, firm stroke from root to tip. He squeezed the head, and when a bead of precum welled up in the slit, he wiped it onto his fingertip, which he immediately sucked clean.
. The fact his Mark was inaccurate – there was quite a bit of difference between a prince and a king, Steve thought – really said it all. Nothing would have ever come of this foolhardy escapade of his, and maybe Antoni’il’s death had just spared Steve a great deal of embarrassment.
Many of Steve’s peers refused the offer. But Steve hadn’t been cured of it yet: the longing that had driven him to the seas, and then to the warfront. The longing to be part of something bigger than himself. To do good and to help others and to contribute to a cause he believed in. That was his reason for existing. If he was needed one day, could he refuse the call? He’d never been able to before.
“Tony’s running from the law, just like the rest of us,” Peter said confidently, sounding pleased. “I knew it.”
Besides – what’ll he do if Tony brings a boyfriend back to the Tower one day, and Steve never even tried? Never even let Tony know he was an option?
well. The back of his neck went warm at the memory; he could only hope the blush didn’t show on his face.
“Um,” said Tony. His grip on Steve’s waist tightened minutely. Steve grinned at him, alight with adrenaline.
“Rat? That’s harsh,” he said. “Just think of me as… a souvenir. A very shiny, very pretty souvenir from the greatest moon in the galaxy.”
, and while Tony didn’t believe in fate, something in him crowed with triumphant delight at the thought that he was Steve’s. It was a bit like winning a lottery he hadn’t even known he’d entered.
Space wasn’t infinite, of course. Not really. Still, Tony could – and would – spend his whole life exploring it and still not see everything there was to see, or learn everything there was to learn.
“Did— did I hurt you?” he asked, stepping back from Tony as if nervous his very presence might cause Tony pain. “I’m so sorry—”
Tony was convincing. The guns were lowered, and Steve’s crew were allowed to come down, and from then on, they were welcomed on Xandar as any other visitor would be.
Natasha padded to his side and sat on the edge of the mattress. He heard her footsteps and felt the bed dip, but she stayed behind him, for which he was grateful; he did not know what she’d read on his face right now.
labs,” Steve reminded him. Not much! If Bruce had cared so much about having a fancy workshop he’d have stayed at the university, wouldn’t he?
(“No, we’re aware that the brain is the source of those things, but we place a… a symbolic and sentimental value on the heart.”
“As soon as I found out about your… your Mark,” said Tony, “I was going to tell you who I was. I didn’t know about soulmates. But I knew that— that I wanted to be yours. I just didn’t have
Peter, their mechanic, who was maybe a shade too young to be out in deep space on his own, consorting with outlaws – but Steve wasn’t his dad and wasn’t about to send him home if he didn’t want to go. He cracked a joke or three in the span of time it took Steve to walk from the doorway to one of the open seats at the table.
“If you’d had him before,” Tony said cheerfully, “you definitely wouldn’t have had to worry about any stowaways.”
“Mostly I thought it didn’t matter if you were straight or not, because you’d never want me.” Tony pauses. “Oops. I killed the mood, didn’t I?”
They docked in Xandar’s spaceport without issue. As they unstrapped their seatbelts and headed to the open hatch, JARVIS deployed the ramp that would allow them to step off to the ground.
They spent about a week on Xandar, going wherever they were told to go. By day they worked hard, repairing inner panels of the dome or replanting community gardens or shifting debris.
His hand found Tony’s cock again, and he jerked Tony in time with the rhythm of their bodies. He watched, rapt, as Tony’s eyes fluttered shut and his breathing stuttered and his bouncing atop Steve grew less controlled and more frantic.
“Just— just give me a second,” he said. He blinked dazedly at the ceiling, and then his eyes slid over to Steve – who still had a pair of fingers in his mouth, tasting of lube and Tony’s ass and Tony’s semen. “Damn, Steve.”
“The queen and the princess are in the safe room, with their favorite guard,” Rodos murmured to Tony, but Steve heard him loud and clear. “The palace has been evacuated, and as much of the city as we could clear, too.”
The trolley went zipping down Xandar’s broad lanes; the lantern lights started to come on as they flew past, and pedestrians drained out of the roads back into their homes. The world got quieter and quieter as the trolley took them to the outskirts of the city and beyond. The paved road turned to dirt and stone, more like a hiking path than a street, and the grey-skinned, bushy-crowned trees native to Xandar rose up around them. The ground sloped, and they went up and up, the trolley’s nose pointed skyward. They weren’t on a mountain, exactly; by any other planet’s standards, it was a hill, but it was also one of the highest peaks that remained to Xandar, one of the few that had managed to stay intact when the planet was shredded. It was too rocky for construction, but the Xandarians valued green spaces and nature. Steve suspected they’d leave it alone, one of the few places where Xandar’s rich natural life was still preserved.
Tony gently hits him over the head with a soft pillow cushion. “You're gonna sound like some uninitiated douche who's just telling the kid what he wants to hear. Tell the six year old what your favorite Disney cartoon is,” Tony says, stressing each word like a warning. It only made the blond chuckle happily.
"Is that what you want?" Tony asks when he breaks for air, panting heavily. Steve groaned, mentally slapping himself for slipping out his thoughts again. He really can't get his bearings right around Tony. Not when they're like this. Tony chuckles at the sight of Steve battling himself. "Steve, baby. Talk to me. Come on. Tell me what you want. We don't have to do anything that you're not comfortable with. We can just k-"
Despite what the masses think, Tony knows exactly what he's doing. As a child, Captain America was Tony's hero. Never in a million years did he imagine actually getting the chance to know his hero, let alone saving the world next to the man.
“I tell ya what,” Steve says, breaking into Tony’s thoughts. “I’ll put those in the oven, and I’ll grab us some milk and a couple of these. We can go down to your lab and have a look at the blueprints. Mark 43 wasn’t it?”
But he grimaces at the pet name, something Tony has always openly used when he talks to Steve. Honey. Darling. Sweetheart. Beloved. The only term of endearment that Tony has never used on Steve was baby. And Steve knows that baby was a popular term of endearment in the 21st century. Maybe the reason why Tony's not used it before, is because he never did see Steve as more than an object of lust.
After the hellicarrier incident, Tony actually thought they'd bury the hatchet when they kicked ass against the Chitauri, and ended it all with a solid handshake at Central Park. Yet the Steve Rogers who arrived at the Tower almost two years later was cold and standoff-ish. Tony could have easily been misled to think that Steve hadn't really gotten over their tiff in New York.
The blond sheepishly smiles and scratches his eyebrow. Tony notices that Steve does that a lot when they talk, and the stuttering mid-sentence was something that never happened when the Captain led missions or conducts briefings with the team. Around him, alone without spectators, Steve was someone else. Someone relatable, someone almost unsure of himself, but clever enough to return Tony's barbs.
Tony leans in and kisses the spot. He drops the icepack and cups Steve's face with both hands and he gently kisses the super soldier on the lips. Steve nearly jerks in surprise but doesn't pull away.
Steve chuckles as he leaves, knowing from experience that a hungry Tony was a grumpy Tony. Just as the elevator pings, he hears footsteps approaching him from behind. He turns, and meets Tony's gaze. The shorter man appears to have something to whisper to him. Like magnet, he leans to meet Tony halfway, tilting his face.
Tony clasps his hands behind his head and starts to pace, puffing air out of his mouth in frustration. Steve watches the man calculate in his head on his next move. Steve on the other hand had made up his mind. He was bleeding from the inside, and like Tony, he might need some space and get away as well. He slowly reaches out of Tony's t-shirt on the ground that was laying next to his feet (even his shoes had been kicked off) and he balls it up before tossing it to the man. Tony catches the shirt with one hand.
“Not so great. But I’ve been keeping myself occupied with all this,” Steve nudges back to the kitchen. “It helps getting my mind off the uh, nightmares. Keeps me off the roof.”
The corner of the genius' mouth automatically quirks into a smile. He nudges his chin up in question, urging Steve to carry on.
But Tony had read Maria Hill's mission reports on what had happen at the Triskelion. It was his tech after all. He also secured the files Natasha had dumped online so Tony was well versed with the fact that Bucky Barnes had come back from the dead as the Winter Soldier. He knew that Steve had dropped his shield and refused to fight the brainwashed assassin. Tony also knew it was more likely than not that Barnes had pulled Steve out of the river.
Tony wasn't about to take it personal, because Clint made terrible jokes sound good and Thor was funny as hell without even trying.
Just does it for Tony every damn time. He wouldn't dare call this - whatever it was that they do all the time - flirting, but the other man sure didn't seem to have any complaints or showing signs of discomfort.
He had fallen in love with a man, from the future, who was by far the most complex of persons he was ever going to meet in his new life, and said man was now staring at him like he had just taken the mickey out of him.
"Steve! Hey I didn't  - come on in, what are you doing over there?" Tony says, flicking his hand to motion Steve in as he gets up. "J, kill the music."
Steve blinks. His lips were slowly gaping and he caught himself in time before his entire jaw fell on the floor. He chews his lips, then clenched his jaw, and finally settles with pressing his hand over his mouth.
"You've been holding back on me, Steve," Tony says when they break for air, still drunk on the taste of his crush.  Tony peppers Steve's jaw line with kisses, inhaling his sweet scent. "God you're intoxicating."
like you Steve. I dont have everything figured out but I have to get this out of my chest. If you're uncomfortable I'll never bring this up again."
"Your man-WHATEVER. I can't believe you'd do that to me on purpose!" Tony says dramatically as he tries to evade Steve's grabby hands. When the super soldier gets a good grip of his elbow, he gets tugged forward and nearly stumbles. Steve catches him on time and stabilises him.
," Steve says before clearing his throat. Why was he such a dork?! He hesitates before answering this time. "I'm really not that hungry anymore.."
"Hey," Tony says in a low voice, trying to sound casual and seductive at the same time. He ended up sounding like Joey Tribbiani high on Koolaid.
Just like that, the tension's gone. They ease into a comfortable laugh but Tony was determined to make his intentions clear. He takes one large breathe in and goes for it.
Not wanting to give up just yet, Tony finally just offered himself. That he was just as available if Steve wanted someone to sit with him, keep him company. To his utter surprise, Steve didn't balk to this.
"Oh I'm fully aware that everyone needs to grease the pole every now and then," Tony says with a wink.
"I like you Steve," Tony interrupts, getting back to why he was in Steve's apartment in the first place. "I am
Once satisfied, he sits and starts to go through his letters without inviting Tony over, probably assuming that Tony was busy that day from the lack of interest the inventor was showing him. Steve was thoughtful that way, he would never impose.
Steve starts to tidy up the area, arranging the books scattered across the couch and floor. He picks up empty takeout boxes, used chopsticks and empty energy drink cans and he throws them out. Once that was done, Steve starts rolling up hardcopies of blueprints of previous armours before sliding them into their respective cases. He casually walks past Tony to keep them away in the shelves just above Dum-E's charging docks.
With one last glance at his reflection, Steve nods like a dork, a small pout in his lips and soft frown line between his eyebrows. He could do this, he tells himself. He's a confident, brave man. He’s Captain America. He's jumped out of airplanes without a parachute. He's punched Nazis and aliens in the face. He's taken down HYDRA in the different centuries.
me? Come one. This is amazing!” at almost every drawing that Tony would merely shrug his shoulders to.
Comically, Steve was utterly oblivious to Tony's reaction. He was busy writing back to his young fan. He inhales the rest of the assaulted chocolate bar before ducking his head back up to finally notice  that Tony was staring at him with crazy eyes. Like a true scientist, Tony breaks the gaze and randomly picks up two new bars and hands one of it to Steve.
"I leave you for four days and you turned into a wisecracking little monster. JARVIS, call Hill. I think Captain America's been body swapped with a 16 year old teenager."
Soon their mouths slot perfectly in each other, just a hint of teeth and tongue in the midst of the languid movements of their lips. Tony was experienced in the art of lip locking with both genders but he wasn't surprised at all by the way Steve moves; he was a mix of dominance and sensuality, unafraid and curious, eager but playful. It Tony was being really honest, Steve kissed like a very sexy woman who was very aware that she was in control.
It took Steve all of his willpower not to press his mouth against Tony's wet, supple lips right there and then. Likewise, Tony had to bite the insides of his cheek to hold still. Eventually Steve manages to muster some self control and draws back. He pulls his henley to inspect and wasn't surprised to find oil stains across his ribcage. He glances at Tony affectionately, who returns him a smug look.
“Yes, JARVIS?” Steve replies stern and low in his Captain America voice before shaking his head, feeling stupid.
He chews his lower lips, thinking, teasing. He runs a finger over Tony's lips, dragging down his lower lip before gently going in again, this time with more tongue.
It was either he had been misreading Tony all along, or Tony was having one of his self-loathing moments. Steve has learned so much about Tony from just observing him for months now and he quickly comforted himself from feeling the sting of Tony's words.
Taking that as his cue, Steve twists his body to dig into the box he carried with him and came back with-
"Is that... a positive or a negative? Use your words, Cap. I'm terribly male about these things, I'm oblivious."
“As predicted, Sir has begun showing signs of wavering following his 26-hour working spree. I would expect him to carry on with his work, but not before he rests between half hour to 45 minutes. You may find this window of opportunity beneficial to your cause. ”
. The same way most of the world is. Everybody loves Captain America." His last words were full of bitterness. Sometimes he just wants to be just Steve Rogers again. If anyone were to pay him any attention back when he was scrawny and unattractive, it was because that person genuinely liked him for being him.
"So you want me to go out with you, to this charity event, as your date," Tony says, returning to the main topic.
; Tony sighs to himself, noticing a long time ago that Steve has a habit of leaving his hair damp to dry naturally. Tony couldn't resist returning the smile that was plastered across Steve's handsome face.
Steve leans closer and bows his head to capture Tony’s eyes, his long lashes flutter as he smiles. “Only if you want to, Tony. When you’re ready. Doesn’t mean you can’t do what you love most and work on the armour in the meantime.”
“Tony,” Steve calls out happily, and Tony loves the way Steve says his name (when they’re not arguing, of course). He watches as Steve plucks the mittens off. He then licks his lips. The moisture on the smooth, cherry curves of his mouth captures Tony’s eyes, and the brunette had to fight the urge to lick his own. That would have been too obvious. “I didn’t think you’d be back so soon? Sorry about the mess.”
"Thanks, Cap. I mean, if this is your way of telling me I need a break every now and then, consider the message being delivered demonstrably loud and clear."
It was enough for Steve to flush a bright shade of red. When the brunette draws back, Steve couldn't resist touching his face where Tony had pressed his lips against. Steve couldn't help but grin like a cheshire cat.
A cold chill runs down the Captain's spine now, as he watches Tony's body language that screams regret. A mistake.
The brunette backs away slowly, creating a void between them. Tony had his eyes averted from Steve's. He rubs his mouth, licking his lips, looking like he was trying to get rid of the taste. He shakes his head again, and with each movement Steve's heart shatters little by little.
"Nah, it's fine. You know, I might never wash this," Steve says, blurting out this thoughts and instantly regretting it. "Uh, so uhm. I'll see you later tonight?"
"Heya, Cap," Clint greets as he hops over the counter and takes a seat on the marble top, dangling his legs. "Rough night?"
Truly, the man could have easily left him to drown with his demons. Steve was truly on the path to self destruction when he first moved into the Tower. He was still reeling from the lost of his best friend who he presumed had died decades ago. Steve was withdrawn, reliving the trauma and collapsing inside. The first person to reach out to him was also the last person he had expected to.
It took Tony two seconds to realise that the super soldier was stroking his wild hair gently as he reads a book with a free hand. When their eyes meet, Steve smiled softly and asked if he was hungry. The two ended up making dinner together afterwards, neither man finding the need to discuss the fact that they had been physically intimate for the first time.
He ducks his face away and starts to shake his head. Tony's hair was fluffy, fresh, a stark contrast to the rest of his worn out body. A stray strand of hair brushes across his forehead. Tony's body language alarms Steve a little but the clear bright smile forming on his lips comforts the soldier's nerves. Steve waits for Tony to say something, and the genius does not disappoint when he looks into the blond's eyes.
. Not just as a pal, a colleague or an Avenger. I like you, like I want to take you out, hold your hand and be your fella, kind of like you. I wanna know you better. If that's something you're open to."
Steve sighed, but not unhappily. “Just thought you needed a … pick-me-up? I know you’ve had a lot on your plate, you'e been dealing with Congress since the Mandarin, with the Triskelion mess that I made, and Pepper leaving, the suits... and I haven’t been all that supportive either. In fact the past couple of weeks, I’ve been taking so much of your time-“
“Awww geez, listen to this,” Steve suddenly says, jerking Tony out of his thoughts. "Sorry," he adds quickly, thinking he was disrupting Tony's concentration.
Either Tony was going to say yes, or turn him down and everything, everything he's worked for in the past months would turn to dust.But no backing out now. Steve wants to do this today.
He breathes out one last time before reaching out to Tony's hand and placing it on his hip, before steeling his nerves and resting them on his marble ass. He leans into Tony.
For a man his age, Tony took care of himself well. He was nowhere near Steve's physique but enough to put a lot of younger men to shame.
He leaps and grabs Tony by the elbow to stop the smaller man, unintentionally exerting too much force that it jerks the billionaire backwards. Steve instantly lets go of his grip, horrified that he may have hurt his friend, making everything worse. They look at each other, and all Steve could see in Tony's watery eyes was discomfort. He then notices the kiss-swollen lips that he had been devouring just moments ago.
Steve looks up from the carton he was twiddling. "You really like watching people, don't you?" Steve asks, his tone half-scolding.
"I can't believe it," Tony mutters to himself with a big grin on his face. He breaks a bar off his own KitKat and bites into it. "I'm in love with a serial killer, for-“
"Stark asked JARVIS to hold the elevator and bring you right back up. He started yelling when JARVIS refused. Or couldn't do it. Privacy protocols and whatnot. He tried to mess with the system manually but he kinda stopped half way. JARVIS must have sent you down here instead."
“Oh come on, you've made me watch a gazillion cartoons. There's gotta be one that sticks out," Tony coerces. "Come on,
“For your ease of mind, Sir has opened a pack of gummy bears," JARVIS replies, almost affectionately. "The last can of Red Bull has 23% content left and is currently at room temperature. It is unlikely for Mr. Stark to reach for it and there are none left in the mini bar. I believe Sir will need proper sustenance in approximately four hours.”
"I'm counting on that, doll," Steve says as he inches closer to Tony. He reaches out to touch Tony's hands stained with grease but the inventor backs his hand away and gives Steve a playful, non-verbal warning not to get too close. Tony was conscious that he was going to ruin Steve's clean shirt if he moved any closer but Steve presses his hand against Tony's back, boxing him in. "I'd want to hold on to you all night if you turn up in those fancy suits of yours," he whispers.
of you tomorrow. Think you two can manage that, Cap?" Clint relays, knocking Steve back. He doesn't answer. Frankly he wasn't sure himself. He's never felt this strongly about anyone, especially on the physical aspect. What they did earlier,
married, Tony. You've met her wife. Remember we bumped into them two Sundays ago at the coffee place?"
His eyes began to sting, feeling vulnerable again so he quickly moved away to toss the empty carton of milk into the bin. "Get some sleep, Clint. We're gonna need you sharp tomorrow."
Tony lets out a small laugh before composing himself to continue. "That Camaro over there? That's a gift for you and she's almost ready. Had it all planned - I'd take you out for a late afternoon drive, stop by the Brooklyn bridge before sundown, ask you if I could kiss you, make you mine. That sort of stuff."
"97. You said it yourself, you've watched them all with me. You gotta have a favourite," Steve says, nudging on the smaller man playfully.
Steve stands and prays silently, hoping that Bruce had turned in early that evening the way he always does the night before a mission, that Nat was going through her pre-mission ritual of sharpening her entire set of tactical knives in her quarters. Clint usually spends his time by himself at this hour; either on top of the roof or somewhere up in the vents. The assassins were creatures of habit, so since they rarely break convention, there was a good chance they would not be a bother.
Steve suddenly feels embarrassed, but clears his throat anyway. "I've got lube, Tony." Comically, Tony jerks back, feigning a surprise. Steve rolls his eyes, reading the man like a book. "It's not because I bring anybody home," he clarifies anyway just to humour the brunette. "It's for ... personal consumption."
Tony pushes himself from the table and walks towards the blushing soldier. "Unless I am physically unable to go - work stuff, end of the world reasons- why wouldn't I? I don't think I know subtlety even if it slapped me in the face."
It was only then did he realise what a big mistake he had made. If Clint had been all over the vents for the past months, he would have known about their ritual this whole time and yet he had never said anything to anyone. Feeling like a dick and not wanting to risk the progress he's made with Steve (they were finally moving beyond just getting along to maybe something
"YES. How could it be your favourite when you never finished? You stomped ..." The gears in his head start to spin. "...out of the .. room..." And then everything clicked. "Ah."
On the off chance that there was no world-ending alien invasion, a mission that would take them off the grid for weeks, or an Avengers PR event that required hours of schmoozing and socialising, Steve would religiously go to the mail room on Tuesday afternoons and go through the hundreds of fan-mail delivered to the team every week, ranging from soft toys to sketches, even undergarments and expensive art pieces.
So far nobody has made a comment that Steve received the most kisses. In fact, he was as heavily affectionate towards his team leader as he was unruly.
"I think you're hot, Steve," Tony says. The strain in his has wavered, the tension in his neck mellowed. "So
explained to him how biting horizontally into a whole bar of KitKat without breaking them makes one a sociopath. The archer further suggested trying it in front of Tony, knowing how the genius would claw his eyes out in horror.
Tony resigns into the sofa and closes his eyes. He tries his best to hide that growing smile. Because they're doing it again.
"He's a moron," Clint says without preamble, but in full context. "I'd give it a day. He'll come to his senses. And if he doesn't, well, I'll put an arrow to his knee."
", the super soldier said, mimicking Tony's voice and sounding nothing like him at all. "Besides, don't you hate Starbucks?” Steve points out as he slowly draws back, and Tony lets out a small whine at the loss of proximity. He masks it as annoyance that Steve was calling out his choice of beverage.
“So what is it, Cap?” Tony says, laying on his back and resting his head against his arm. "What's your favorite Disney movie?"
“Gee I don’t know. I haven’t watched that many,” Steve lies, already starting to think what he'd write back to Jacob.
Before the genius could dive deeper into his thoughts, he hears a code being punched into the door for access. Tony holds his breathe and looks up. Like clockwork, there he was. The man who stole his heart was at the door in cotton grey sweatpants snugged in all the right places, a white round-collared T-shirt that was two sizes too small for him and a shoebox full of letters pinned to his narrow waist. Steve's short hair wet at the tips but neatly finger combed.
Steve lets out a long heavy sigh and rubs his eyes roughly, hoping to eliminate any trace of tears. But his face was sticky, his nose snotty. If anyone decided to step into this lift right now, they would find Captain America leaving Tony's Stark's penthouse, choking back a sob, with hickeys peppering his neck and buttons missing from his shirt. The sight would even send the Avengers' alarm off.
Tony picks up his iced coffee and offers it to Steve. “Deal’s a deal.” He watches as Steve’s lips capture the metal straw without taking the cup, his tongue slightly drawn out. He takes a sip and plays with the beverage on his mouth before swallowing. Of course, Tony follows every movement with an appetite.
"Not just any kiss, Rogers," Tony adds, his eyes growing darker. "It's gotta be full on mouth on mouth, with lots of tongue and maybe a little action on the hood of the car. I also made sure the suspensions are upgraded to super soldier standards, you know, just in case," Tony winks. His voice narrating all the things he wants to do with Steve sends the jolt through the bumbling super soldier's body, and a low guttural moan escapes him as he closes his eyes and pictures Tony pining him down against the hood.
He presses his lips firmly against Steve's to keep him locked in the present. It works, because Steve was high again when Tony draws back.
Steve rolls eyes at himself and buries his face in his hand. He manages to glance over at the window panels, wondering how many steps does he need to take to get there and throw himself off the Tower. Before he could say anything else, Tony leans in and takes his hands apart and kisses him again, this time the kiss was feverish. Steve opened his mouth this time, letting Tony slide in to set the pace as he traces Steve's cheeks, sucking his lower lip.
sorry for the things I said earlier. I like you. A lot. I like everything about you, not just because you're .. hot as hell. That part is true, I took everything I had to push you away. But I got scared, and when I get that way I tend do turn into a manipulative asshole just to protect myself. You didn't deserve that, I was wrong, and I am sorry."
This cracks Tony up, ruining the euphoria. He buries his face in Steve's neck laughing, giving up altogether.
," Tony says without heat and already peeling himself away. "Says the guy who wrapped his arms around me knowingly I'm on grease monkey mode. Fine, get outta here. Don't be too late, I need to be fed and watered."
Steve walks into the carriage, hesitates for a moment before he allows himself to turn and face Tony, exposing the tears that had welled in his eyes and found a path down his face.
Steve's breaths were still short, his heart thumping its way into his ears. His chiseled jaw was still aching from the kiss that felt like it had gone for hours. He watches as Tony steps further away, shaking his head and catching his own breath as though he had just completed a sprint.
"Steve, I'm just putting it out there.  The second I step out of that limo after you do, the press are going to go nuts. Stuff that aren't exactly true are going to spread like wildfire, nobody really cares about the truth these days. It'll get really crazy. It'll get too much. You already hate the stuff they write about me, you're not going to like what they'll write about you getting involved with me."
“Excuse me? I flew back from the other side of the country for three and a half hours, and you’re kicking me out of my own kitchen?”
Steve got that reference but he refuses to respond to the bait. "I'll get some sushi on the way home. Take a shower, you smell like a gas station."
“Yeah well Daddy's home now. We'll get you sorted," Tony said without thinking. A flash of red spreads across Steve's face and the super soldier ducks his face away and clears his throat loudly. It did not escape Tony that Steve had flushed hard and it was definitely something he had just said.
And he wanted to make sure Steve knew how much he appreciated the gesture. He wraps his arms around the super soldier and tightly hugs him, grabbing the back of Steve’s neck to hold him close. Before he drew back, he kisses Steve softly on the cheek, making sure the pressure was light but meaningful. The kiss was okay, Tony reasons with himself, because he kisses everyone regularly. The entire team was aware that Tony does whatever he wants, including pecking people randomly when his mood was better.
Tony warns himself.He continued looking though, since it was in his line of vision – it’s a glorious view anyway.
At the edge of the countertop, Tony sees grocery bags. There’s an opened milk carton, two trays of eggs – one empty, the other having four left – and … pop tarts? Those must have been for Thor.
? Steve, have you even met me? And plus, don't flatter yourself. I didn't want you the first time I met you."
The three purpling blotches on Tony's skin that trail from his jawline down to his collarbone makes everything even more confusing. Steve's throat collapses to the sight, evidence of him marking Tony that way. He was sure he had very similar marks on the same spots on his body, but the serum would have taken cared of it in an hour. There was no time to think about that now; for once in his life he followed his heart instead of his head, and he's paying the price by having his best friend looking torn and miserable.
Steve remains unmoved, his back to Tony. The elevator will reach the penthouse any moment, so Steve prays that Tony says what he wants to say before the moment is lost.
It was a sweet, gentle kiss on the cheek, with Tony only slightly holding on to him close by his arm.
"He likes you Cap," Clint adds. "Whatever that was about, just give him time. Stark's a little messed up, heck we all are, me especially but it's no secret that he's into you. That you both are into each other."
The last sentence came out of nowhere and Tony’s breathe hitches. He sighs and looks at Steve – they’ve had this conversation before in one of those nights that Tony has spent sitting on the roof with Steve, calming the super soldier down from his panic attacks drawn from nightmares that never seemed to leave the captain. It was either Tony was there for Steve, or vice versa. Only difference was, Steve found solace on high places. Tony on the other hand morphs into a obsessive hermit when his episodes begin, so Steve would sit with him in his lab until he was ready to leave again.
“Yeah you like ‘em black, bitter and scalding. Painful to swallow but addictive once you have it in your mouth. Hey, that should have been on my SHIELD profile” Tony humors, then realizes what he had insinuated. “Thanks, Steve,” he quickly backpedals, chanting
They'd spend all of last Saturday eating the cookies that Steve had baked him (!!!!) and belting smash hits on the karaoke machine. At the end of it all, Tony fell asleep on Steve's chest. When he woke up two hours later, he found himself curled towards Steve's body, a hand wrapped across a broad chest and a leg tangled over Steve's thighs. Tony was basically using him like a giant, cuddly bolster.
Steve raises a perfect eyebrow as he welcomes Tony into his personal space. "Why would different rules apply?  What are you getting at?"
Steve tells himself. He was mildly annoyed by Tony's insinuation, as though the genius hadn't known by now that he wasn't seeing anyone special. Or that Steve had more than once hinted that if he
"And frankly, you in a tuxedo?" Tony says, piercing through Steve's thoughts. "I'm not even going to pretend that doesn't make me weak in the knees. They're going to have to pry me away from you with a crowbar," Tony says with a straight face and a slight shrug of his shoulders.
The softness of Steve’s gaze when he reads the letters kids would write him was Tony’s favorite part of their routine and it was highly distracting.
Even though he knew Steve was away on Avengers business, his treacherous mind was playing tricks on him, whispering to his head that he'd come on to Steve too hard. And Steve was not like any other person that he's fallen for.
Steve looks at him like he's stupid. Finally making a move on Tony was the hardest thing he had to convince himself to do. Years of pining, months of planning and several failed attempts of executing said plan later, he finally thought he had the answers to the mystery that he was trying to solve. His happiness was short-lived because clearly after a heavy make-out session that involved Tony clawing at his shirt and ripping off the buttons all the way down in a desperate attempt to get skin on skin, and Tony losing his own t-shirt in the process, Tony was having a drastic change of mind and was throwing a fit at what he had just voluntarily participated in.
Wandering in his head, Steve failed to notice that the elevator had in fact missed his floor completely and was on it's way down to the Avengers' common room as a default. Steve frowns and braces himself for awkwardness. When the doors slide open, the common room was dimly lit and unoccupied. Pleased, Steve steps out and heads to the pantry, dropping his shoes by the plants next to the elevator.
They smile, knowing without having to say more, what they feel for each other. But the genius had his concerns. "But Steve," he continues like a warning, as he clears his throat. "Have you thought this through? It's not the same for me to show up with you for this gig than it is for you to come along with me for one of my many shindigs. Different rules apply."
"You didn't get that reference. That's fine," Clint says, smiling. "But I don't get it. What was the problem? He seemed into it and then it's like he just switched off?"
"Not that I don't deserve the shoe in the face..." That was Steve's cue to start apologising again. But Tony waves a hand to stop him. "..which, by the way, was a pretty solid throw. Hmm I think the bleeding's stopped." Tony tilts his head back up, and tries his best to scrunch his nose, blinking his eyes dramatically. It's sore but not broken. "Yeah. A broken nose would have put a hamper to the mission tomorrow, wouldn't it?" he jokes.
"Tell me what I can do," Steve presses as gently as he can, desperate to keep his voice from shaking.
Steve sighs, his shoulders dropping. It goes without saying that his heart was on the floor. "What do you want me to do, Tony? I'll do it," he says in the saddest voice he's ever heard come out of him. "You don't want me around you? I'll keep a distance. I know it'll be awkward but we can be purely professional."
Because he was a sap who preferred handmade, old fashion snail mail, Steve would always pick out the hand-written letters addressed to him and neatly stack them in a box in order of envelope size. He would then make his way to Tony’s workshop with a spring in each step, punch in his access code to let himself in, plant himself on the carpet by the couch and work his way through the dozens of letters gleefully, tracing his fingers along the texture of the paper.
Steve breaks into another round of laughter, this time looking guilty. He then admits that it started off as a prank; Clint
Steve draws back to look into Tony's beautiful chestnut eyes. Steve presses his lips together and licks his lower lip. "After that, I was thinking maybe I'll buy you coffee and we can take a slow walk back to the Tower. Maybe I'll walk you right back to your door. Maybe I'd wanna come in if you asked."
As much as Steve tried to convince himself that Tony on was just going on defence mode, that he was clamming up due to his own insecurities, his inner demons whispering that he's never good enough for anyone, Steve felt the cut. It was deep and it drew blood.
Steve reaches the basement where his motorcycle was parked. He swings a leg over it and sits, eyes and hands still glued on his phone. His heart was thumping its way out of his chest though. At that very moment, he knew he was a goner.
“You’ll see soon enough. Now get outta here, they're not ready,” Steve says, reaching to grab Tony’s shoulders and twisting the shorter man around to lead him back where he’d come from.
"You know I am," Tony says, almost coming out as a jogged whisper. His gaze was soft and electrifying at the same time and it never fails to boil Steve's cheeks.
Their already rocky relationship became confusing when Tony kept showing up on the countless nights he'd screamed himself awake from re-occuring nightmares. Sometimes he'd frog march Tony out of his quarters and insist that Tony leave.  When he was really anxious he would yell at the man to just to shut up, to mind his own goddamn business. Steve was cruel, his words were harsh.
As far as Tony was concerned, at that time Steve probably trusted Tony as far as he could throw him. Never mind that Steve had super human strength. So it was a huge gamble, mostly his pride was on line, when he offered Steve help to get through this. Access to the best therapists and doctors in the field, basically anything at all that would make life a little more bearable for the suffering super soldier. Tony had the capacity to make a lot of things happen.
Was Tony that sleep deprived? Did Steve just said what he thought he said? “You baked me cookies to …?”
"Go out with me, Steve. Let me take you out. We can grab a cheeseburger and shakes if you want. Or I can wine and dine you like a gentleman that I'm known to be from time to time. Whatever you're comfortable with."
be a problem, but the God of Thunder was more honourable than most people. In all likelihood, if the Prince of Asgard bumped into Steve in the state he was in, he would respect Steve's wishes to keep the encounter confidential, with no questions asked.
His first order of business was to out their Tuesday afternoons activities and Clint did it the very next day during breakfast. Tony nearly spat out his coffee all over Thor's bowl of cereal.
Without realising what he was doing, Tony had penned his thoughts down at the back of a 12 year old's letter. Safe to say, that poor fan never got a response from Captain America.
Eventually, Tony learned about the insomnia. JARVIS picked up Steve's frequent visits to the roof of the Tower in the wee hours of the morning and this prompted Tony to go up there one night, only to find the 220lbs soldier standing by the ledge of the roof, choking back tears and shivering to the bones. It took a few tries for Steve to admit that that he suffered from panic attacks from time to time since he woke up, but it has increased exponentially since DC.
"Hey, you said you thought I was pretty," Steve says, feigning annoyance but Tony definitely managed to wrest a smile out of him.
Steve rolls his eyes fondly. He hesitates for a moment before answering. "Okay mine's Mulan. What's yours?"
The coffee machine at the common floor was actually the main reason why Tony agreed to take the detour. He needed his caffeine fix, regardless that he was running on borrowed time. When he reaches the floor, he finally understands why JARVIS had led him here.
"Alright," Steve says curiously before coming in and dropping his box on his usual spot on the carpet.
His tone was anything but mean. In fact, it quickly became clear to Steve that Tony wasn't purposely trying to get a rise out of him. He was just tired and clearly out of focus. "Linda
"I'm sorry, I can't," Tony croaks, pushing Steve into the couch before getting up and turning his back against the super soldier.
"Is this like, an honorary guest kind of invitation? Keynote speech? Either way yeah I'm free. I'd be more than happy to sign a cheque too."
Steve smiles sadly as he walks away to pick up his shoes. "Tony's a lot tougher than you give him credit for. Good night, Clint," he says, without turning around.
When Steve finally reaches his floor, the first thing he did when the elevator doors open was to swing his powerful arms to toss his shoes as far as possible across the living area. For an unknown reason he had been looking forward to do that since he left the common floor.
The genius could watch Steve all day long if life would permit it. Usually it wouldn't take long for Tony to abandon his tools to lay on the couch while Steve rests against it on the carpet. Tony absolutely loves the way Steve's ocean blue eyes would sparkle in the sun when he tilts his head to meet Tony’s chocolate eyes. Steve would practically gush whenever he received drawings and letters from kids. He loved showing them off to Tony and would go “Are you
The rest of the afternoon was pleasantly subtle. They managed to pull themselves together with Tony helping Steve go through the rest of the fan-mail. They would kiss every now and then between letters, but never went further than that. It wasn't a sprint to the finish line for either of them. They were just at the start of a very long walk, and whilst they would stop and enjoy the roses every now and then, the pace was comfortable for the moment.
Tony rolls his eyes, feigning annoyance and trying his best to ignore the innuendo. There was no way Steve could have meant what Tony had hoped he had. "How about right now?" Tony shoots back without thinking too far ahead.
Tony stretches his mouth, guilty. "The fact that this ratty old couch actually feels decent is clear evidence how sore my back is." Tony stretches his arms and legs as far as they would go before releasing the tension altogether.
me. You can't possibly want something from me that isn't a form of an apology. Regardless of the fact that - wait."
Steve laughs, leaning against the wall, watching the tired lines of Tony’s face. He had been gone for days cleaning up the last remnants of his old house destroyed in the missile attack, tying loose ends before the final goodbye. Tony finally found the time to sell the estate and completely move to New York, to live in the tower with his new roommates. The Triskelion fiasco took a lot of Tony's attention so after putting off the sale for almost a year, this was the last time Tony was going to be making frequent trips back to California.
He breaks into a silly grin. He thanks Tony’s trusted assistant and starts to leave his room, but he halts two steps away from the door. “JARVIS, could you uh check if Tony needs anything? Has he eaten since I - I mean
the scent. He dares himself to look and catches the super content expression on Steve's face, like he was so happy to be there. He was even humming a pleasant tune while he built a nest of pillows.
For a moment Steve appears unconvinced but then he warms up as his smile returns. "No, Tony, you haven't. Serial killer? I've been called worse."
“You literally are the peak of human perfection. You punch Nazis, you fight aliens, you take down HYDRA and you bake chocolate chip and peppermint cookies. What
The first few weeks that Steve moved in, the pair barely interacted at all. It irked Tony because he was really trying to be nice yet Steve was the only one treating the billionaire like second choice Susan. Tony's biggest problem was that the Captain was infuriatingly polite and he didn't exactly do anything wrong. He was just a tad withdrawn, never staying longer than necessary during meal times and preferring isolation than the company of others.
Thor, well, Thor was the exception. He made a habit of showing up unannounced, and showing up dramatically. That
am. That I'm into perfumes and baking and all types of things that ...... women do. I'm not exactly what you expected when you first met me. I'm not (Steve curls his fingers in inverted commas, something he learned from Clint obviously) -"
"I like you just fine," Steve murmurs to himself, getting ready to leave, knowing full well that Tony wouldn't be able to hear him.
It was a quiet second day of the week, no missions, no charity meet and greet, and Tony was nervously looking forward to Steve.
Tony bolts to the sink. He doesn't vomit, but he might as well since he can't seem to do anything right today. When he comes back with a glass of water in hand, he notices that Steve has started writing again. He has a sad frown on his face though, and Tony knew he couldn't pretend that he didn't say what he'd say. This was not how he had envisioned his confession to be like, but since the cat's out of the bag, he might as well ride the waves.
He was as gentle as he was stubborn. He wore his heart on his sleeve, always eager to welcome Steve in any shape or form the broken man presented himself. Before Steve realised what was going on, he found himself slowly trusting the inventor and wanting more of his company. Being around Tony made him feel
Steve remembers what he had whispered to Tony that exact moment. It was a silly joke, something only the two of them could make the connection. Steve remembers how Tony doubled over while the rest of the team just stared as the humour was lost on everybody else. That same day, Tony held his hand for the first time. It was nothing romantic, heck Tony was trying to read his palm of all things (and failed miserably). They ended up enjoying each other’s company with a bottle of beer each, away from the crowd.
He swallowed thickly, feeling guilty. How could he hurt him? How could he hurt this beautiful, loving creature? For so many years he had wished for a guardian, staring at statues and wishing one would come to him, and now one had and he was hurting him, pushing him away like he did to everyone he ever cared for.
Steve cupped the sharp edge that had been met with a thud of a titanium gauntlet. He knew he was going to feel that in the morning. But nothing hurt more than the dull drone in his chest that became louder and louder with every sudden shove away from the man that he was growing oddly attached to.
Steve followed Tony, grabbing his shield from the table and slotting it into the magnetic harness on his back. “You ready, Tony? I’m going to ask you for a lift… Since well….”
As they approached the city center it was clear with the amount of destruction that they were in the right place. Carol pulled her car to the side while people were running around screaming, flailing their limbs about and stumbling over one another trying to get out of the buildings that the bot was attacking. It wasn’t just stomping around the city clumsily like they’d expected, no, it was shooting lasers, flinging its huge metallic arms about, with its bright green eyes instilling fear into the local civilians that attempted to escape it. It echoed, its booming ear-shattering voice replaying the same message over and over again;
“Look at this… Judging by the blood sample there is a depleting amount of haemoglobin and an increase of de-oxidised blood which means—“
“Oh, like you? You’re a relic!” Now it became personal. “Fury kept you under because he knew you couldn’t handle it, and now look, you can’t handle it. You think destroying the future of technology is the best way forward instead of repairing it? And I’m supposed to be the futurist here, the one that destroys and moves on, and yet I take from your mentality and I’m being persecuted by the man who always sees the best in things… Technology isn’t your forte, Rogers, stay back and let me work.”
“Don’t talk about how half of our team just flew out of the window because I’m already thinking how much it’s going to cost to repair. I may be a billionaire, but come on.”
She fell to the side and struggled, tussling with the white fluid with that seemed to trap her, even with her immense strength.
“It’s safer! I know about safe, you want me to slam fire hazard laws in your face, Cage?!” She yells in that authoritative boom.
It didn’t surprise Peter that Tony stared at the man before him, jaw agape. But to the young man, this wasn’t Steve standing in front of him; this was a cyborg that was feared amongst the city that just so happened to incorporate the best traits of their once leader into its design.
Tony was reading through the files that he had ordered everyone bring to him, skimming each word and taking everything in. This was the man from the comic books, even judging by the brain patterns that were documented, the settings and reactions. Even in his fake world in his mind that he’d been thrown into, he was still a hero, helping old ladies cross the street, paying for someone when they didn’t have enough for their morning coffees. The man had a heart of gold which was something that Tony had admired, but in some senses deemed as nativity. He understood why Fury thought that he wasn’t fit to live in this world and it was even by Tony’s regard, Steve’s ideals were outdated. The people of today wouldn’t react kindly to a lot of his traits nor would they want to be helped. Women were no longer considered damsels in distress- they were powerhouses. If someone dare call Carol a damsel she would probably punch them so hard that they would fly through the stratosphere. But that didn’t mean that Tony didn’t have faith that Steve could adapt. He thought every word on the paper about his PTSD was a horrible excuse to keep him under lock and key, keep him as a relic and restrict him from growing. Tony scowled the more he read, but his line of sight was suddenly distracted by a small movement in the distance.
Tony palm faced forward, but Steve couldn’t quite get a glimpse of his other arm, it appeared hidden, the way that Tony was standing. But he did notice something by his feet – drops of blood were starting to trickle from Tony’s hidden arm, pooling on the floor.
Maybe he had gone to heaven if there was such a place? If so how very dare he leave him here to suffer like this. The thought had crossed his mind many times before, and he’d even gone back up to visit his coffin, his real coffin back where he had set it; in the block of ice, back to sink back into the cold seas which he had fallen into once upon a time. But overall this could have been a way of Tony repenting, even though he wasn’t a religious person he had to have some form of justification as to why he wasn’t seeing the hollow figure of his hero in the streets. There must always be a reason for everything and that’s how a scientist’s brain works.
“Training sessions with Mr Stark… Wow, it’s amazing how many of his memories stored are of you. Well, not for long.”
“Don’t mention it, Cap, really. Now come on, I’m getting hungry and a little tired so we’ll give this place one more sweep and head back to your new home.”
He groaned again, clutching his stomach as a pain seared throughout his body originating from his abdomen. Tony tried to scramble to his feet, apparently he wasn’t dead, but it took a lot of effort to get himself up. His entire body was stiff, and he couldn’t quite straighten out his neck. Thoughts and memories seemed to blur, everything was like he had just woken up from a dream of some sort.
, as Zola was one of his most worthy adversaries. He had been gone for hours and in that time was poked and prodded by a number of needles.
“I want to feel more of you…” Steve said, dazzling eye looking up, biting on Tony’s lower lip. It dragged and Tony was pulled down by the strong grip.
“Sending Vision back isn’t the wisest of choices if we’re dealing with Killgrave…” Steve thought aloud.
Tony’s eyes widened, he’d given up trying to fight the fact that this couldn’t be real.  He just needed this, he needed thee comfort and he needed to be held by the man that he practically worshipped once. He needed to be held by the man that he loved with all of his heart. He remembered when Steve had actually said that to him, back then it meant the world to him but now it meant even more. “You’re... Dead because of me...”
“Wait!” Tony quickly tugged something out of the pocket of his long jacket, fumbling as he tried to open the car door but eventually pulling it open and then jumping out, tripping on his feet but maintaining his balance (just) as he ran up those few stairs to meet Steve, taking his hand and placing something in it. “I almost forgot this!”
Luckily the curtains weren’t drawn, which probably meant that Steve left while it was still dark outside. At least they’d managed to spend one night together, even if it meant that Steve walked off shortly after their night of passion.
The police were all huddled around the small TV screen that they had in the office, chattering amongst themselves. Tony’s name propped up constantly.
“Didn’t you get the memo?” Tony pinned Zola down tighter, his fingers like vices, closing in on Zola’s arms and crushing them. “I hate magic.” He could hear the fizzle of circuits and felt the way that the villain that he was pinning down was slowly becoming immobilised. As much as he wanted to finish him there and then, he knew if he did so he would encounter numerous problems when he’d returned home. He had to keep in mind Cap’s teaching; killing should never be an option. Even though technically it wasn’t killing Zola, it was deleting him and emptying the recycle bin so he would never return to plague them.
He leaned forward and pushed his lips against Steve’s as forcefully as he could, shutting his eyes with the raw passion that he was trying to show, though he made sure that Steve was the one with his back to the crowd. They’d kept their infatuation under wraps for so long, he couldn’t have it becoming public news now. He pulled Steve closer into the darkness of the alley and continued with the smooch, only to be shoved back and then punched across the face again by the heavy gauntlet.
Instantly Tony’s eyes went from shocked to livid, and he raised his eyebrows indignantly. “It’s you!” He managed to shout, breaking free with a yank backward. He raised both of his hands and pointed them at Crossbones, ensuring his palms were facing him. His voice was particularly fuelled with bitterness, considering that this was the very man that had shot Steve before.
“Wanted to get rid of the second arm since the first was so entertaining but I’ll suppose I’ll let him keep one for now, until he’s done with my—our – bidding.”
“Stunts?”— There was a loud thud and both of Steve’s heavy hands smacked up against the wall, scratching at it. Tony jumped back, feeling his heart stop for one second. “—holy shit!”
Everything was well in New York City. The birds were once again singing, the children were outside playing and the town was safe and being rebuilt once again. The robot parts scattered around the city were being recycled and used for Tony’s new business – prosthetics for those in need. He was helping in more ways than one, naturally the philanthropist. Reed was back in the lab, being monitored by Sue more closely than ever. Carol was running her new sub-team, helping rebuild the city and monitor supervillain activity. And Steve and Tony, well, they had plans of their own.
“I’m on it Cap! Just let me handle these—“ He threw a solid punch at one of the things, “—ugly bastards first.”
“I’m not leaving you until I have answers!” His grip tightened, the squeak of his leather red gloves skimming across the metal surface made a distinct noise.
“Of course, Tony.” Reed reassured him, pulling away from the screens to walk to a hidden part of the medical bay. He swiping his card and typing in a PIN for the metal wall to fold back. This in turn revealed a quarantine room that they’d built in case of an emergency. Tony was well-prepared for situations like this, yes…but never did he ever think that he would have to use this room on someone he held so dearly.
He shook his head and found his hand dancing fondly over the neatly folded bedsheets. He curiously sauntered over to Steve to peer over his shoulder, and was awestruck by the intricate drawing Steve was working on. “Is that me?”
The boy did as he was told, pulling out the wires not as elegantly as Tony but still without damaging anything, holding it out for the man who took it as he leaned over, trying to work on his arm. “Mind helping?”
Steve replied with a simple smile, one that confused Tony, but most of all gave him a sense of ease he hadn’t gotten from his previous partners. It made him smile, warmer than before as he kept his head forward and let Steve take the wheel, driving to their next spot.
There were blanks in his mind, many of them but right now, all he could see was the dying man before him and blood on his hands. Forcing himself to his feet, he took slow, pained steps toward Tony, still juddering occasionally from the shock. His reactor felt strong, better than ever actually. It was as though he could feel Tony’s strength supporting him.
Tony held up his hand to speak, “Yeah, we were actually just on our way back to the lab to get everything fixed, Officer Danvers.”
“Will you two stop complaining? You’re clouding up my radio; we have to keep these airways clear.” Carol commanded.
JARVIS scooted over toward a green glowing object, barking at it. Tony meanwhile was looking around.
“Holy smokes…” Steve muttered whilst Tony rested his arm on Steve’s shoulder, clutching him for support.
Every single calculation flashed through his mind and he wriggled and squirmed to try and find some sort of solution. His chest filled with pain as his reactor faltered and it was then he was struck with the realisation of his impending doom.
“I wasn’t expecting brain surgery NOT to hurt,” Peter said, shutting his eyes. He could feel the metallic tips sifting through his hair, but he had to keep reassuring himself that this was Tony Stark. Brain surgery should be a cinch for him, but what worried him was that Tony was an engineer, not a surgeon. But the constant reminder of how many doctorates he had could’ve meant that he had at least one medical PHD stuck in there.
“Create the kid, Bucky, in his dreams. That’ll help him; it should reduce the panic attacks, especially if he’s got a security blanket there.”
The man fired the gun and hit the ground, his vision shaky from how scared he was of the two beasts that literally tore the civilian apart.  The gunshot made Steve take a few steps to the man that was targeting Tony, he snapped his teeth at the cop that fired again at Tony, this time Steve managed to intercept the bullet. It tore through his chest and failed to even phase the shadow of a man that was left standing, taking the opportunity of shock that flustered the cop to jump him, biting into his neck and hearing a blood curdling scream escape before he ripped further and further into him with his bare teeth.
“Are you implying that I’m not responsible? You know, you should watch who you’re talking to kiddo,” he jested in return, having missed the banter. It seemed to be a better atmosphere; they seemed to be a little more light-hearted, considering that they were in a broken down hospital. The ex-billionaire gently swivelled his body to rest on the bed, turning the pillow so that it was vertical, just tilted so his cheek was resting on it and reaching up and slipping his helmet off and placing it careful on top of the machine that was next to him. His armoured arm reached around the pillow and hugged it to his body, shutting his eyes. It was a relief to be on a bed again, to get some rest whilst his arc reactor powered up with the new cells in the places that were draining the most power.
“Captain America and you need to step away from the bank vault.” Steve said, taking cautious footsteps past the broken glass from the shattered window, hearing the tiny shards crunch underneath his bright red boot.
“You’re pretty angelic when you want to be.” Steve said, moving one of his hands from Tony’s shoulder to scratch the back of his head nervously.
“That guy’s wearing something that does NOT belong to him.” The ferociously upset voice yelled back as he leaped, bouncing off wall from wall eventually to stoop down in his crawler position in front of Tony.  “This is what we call a Trojan horse. Come on, Greek history 101. You know, I never got to finish that class...”
Steve coughed as his vision became blurry yet again, but his body was still desperately trying to fight against the sedation, opening his bloodshot eyes to glare at the evil genius in front of him. “You’re not taking me down with a virus, or with another clone.”
“Damn, I wanted to try a British roast, oh well, there’s always tomorrow.” He said, looking at the clock on his monitor before touching down. He didn’t land on the coast, it was an island that was off the coast, near Wales, but it wasn’t that hard to spot. Judging by the jurisdiction that SHIELD had over it, it was probably a man-made island, and those were a cinch to find considering the analytical capabilities that his suit had, it just took a single glance to find it.
“Handled,” the car replied, with Steve furrowing his brows with curiosity. He’d learned with his time with Tony to expect the unexpected, but what he didn’t expect was to hear the exhaust cough before shooting out a sticky white web-looking liquid that caused the two cop cars nearest to them to halt, getting caught in the mess.
Steve hit the ground shield first, making an even louder thud as the shield absorbed the impact. Tony’s foot didn’t allow Steve to pop himself up as it came down on his back with an extremely loud crunch. Two or three vertebrae were under extreme pressure from the solid armoured boot. Steve grimaced, turning his head toward the two men that stood in a stancethat was supposed to resemble power and authority.
“Hey, look whos here with presents.” Tony spread his arms and eyed the man who shuffled to his feet before him, staggering a little and stepping up to Tony.
“Don’t you worry madam!” Tony chimed in with his much louder, much more confident tone. “This may be an
The admission made Steve’s heart melt and, instinctively, he pulled Tony closer while they stepped in tandem through the empty and barren streets. “And what about those comics you risked your life for?”
His body fell numb.  He let the air carry him, accepting his fate. He held his arms outward and rest his head back, the winds cutting through his soft hair.
Tony let out a cry of pain, his bones being crushed by the pressure alone. A wooden plank separated the shelf from his face, laying there in darkness in absolute agony. He was sure that he blacked out for a while, especially after all of that high impact trauma he’d just gone through. There was numbness, then sharp jolts of pain that coursed along his spine. The image of Steve the night before was all that was keeping him awake, remembering the warmth in the man’s eyes the night before, visualising it perfectly when his eyes shut and how it made his heart flutter. Steve was the last man he wanted to see, he wanted to be in his arms just like the night before, warm, safe, secure.
“I’ll take that as a no,” Tony added, standing next to Peter though slightly slouching, the pain in his back was far too much for him to actually stand upright.
Then it was Tony’s time to shine as he jumped over Steve’s shoulders, aiming his repulsor to the centre of the machine, and then firing with a forceful beam.
Tony huffed and corrected his hat, glancing over at Steve. There was no way that Steve could blame those big blues staring back at him, sure, it was like dealing with a child so far… a child with about a dozen gadgets, but Tony was just trying to help and Steve could clearly see that.
He shut his eyes, hearing the distant rumble of thunder and heavy rain against the window pain. If he listened close enough he could hear each drop trickle down.
“There are more to deal with.” Vision gestured to the other red dots, tapping one of them to enlarge the image.
With a one handed salute, keeping Steve hoisted up in his arms he watched the others flee, seeing them move much more rapidly than they approached. And just like that, they were gone, away to deal with the other brainwashed ringleaders as such, who worked for this mysterious supreme leader. Every time something eventful happened he felt the need to lay out a firm plan of action in his mind;
his heart over the internal whirring of machinery inside him. His eyes fixed, wide on the fallen man.
There they lay in a broken down hospital, in the ruins of one, which was probably the least romantic setting for their first time. Nonetheless, in Tony’s eyes it couldn’t have been more perfect. Steve placed a series of tender kisses to Tony’s forehead, brushing away the strands that stuck to his skin, then rubbed his arms tenderly along his shoulder blades. Tony purred like a content kitten, kissing the centre of Steve’s reactor appreciatively.
“Better… But I’m still hungry. It does feel better though, I don’t suppose you have more burgers, Shellhead? I knew I could rely on you.” Steve smiled weakly up at him.
He turned his head and spotted two shadows standing by the highest point of the factory, on a balcony that was obviously made to be overlooking the production line. One was clearly the Purple Man, dressed in his usual sharp looking suit with his hands resting behind his back, but Steve couldn’t tell who the other person was; an even leaner frame than the Purple Man, hair gelled back, glasses – then he remembered what Tony had said about someone named ‘Hammer’ before, knowing that it was probably him.
“Janet’s right,” Clint replied. “I wasn’t too keen on this team thing to start with, but heck, if we can deal with Galactus once I’m sure we can deal with him a second time… Together.”
“You two go and find somewhere safe, get the chips out of Peter – just go!” Carol yelled as she rose to her feet, hovering in the air as her hands sparked with energy.
JARVIS was huddled up by the wall, his tail having extended into a wire that was plugged into a huge fuse panel outdoors. His eyes were lit up green with binary floating across where his eyes were usually as he searched through the security protocols.
Tony tapped his chin and gestured her to come closer with the broken radio, opening it up and fiddling with the circuitry. “Now this won’t function as a radio since the transistor is fried, but I can fix it up so it’ll send out a distress signal. Which, in theory, our radios should pick up.”
Steve smiled faintly in return. “It’ll be fine. Let’s get going. Splitting up the team was a wise choice, we’ll get more done this way, there’ll be far less damage done.”
The wondering thought was short lived, especially when he looked at the simulator and the schematics that appeared. “Perfect. Try that out on him, see how he responds. It’s better to keep him under.”
“What’s that?” He asked, seeing Tony pull something out of the back of his armour, handing it carefully to Steve.
Janet was busy taking photos of everyone, ensuring that she was getting the best selfies, even with Bruce who didn’t look too happy to be there. Hawkeye was having fun with Falcon, balancing a beer bottle on top of his head while sitting in front of the TV that took up the space of the entire wall, pressing buttons quickly with their tongues poking out as they fought each other in the latest edition of Mortal Kombat. Clint was having far too much fun trying out the brand new fatalities on Sam, who was getting frustrated and would occasionally nudge Clint to try and throw him off.  Natasha and T’Challa were obviously the cool kids, relaxing on the huge leather couches that Tony had bought for the living room. Vision and Hank were relaxing opposite T’Challa, and Natasha watching Thor down around 20 bottles of beer without so much as batting an eyelid. The music was loud, the atmosphere was happy and everything was perfect. The party lit up even more when their buddies from the Baxter Building popped over to celebrate.
“Listen, Steve…” He peered over his shoulder, trying to meet the soldier’s eyes. “I’ve lost my memories before, a long time ago. And I never, ever want that to happen to anyone else. It was so painful trying to remember everything, and you know, to this day nothing seems real. Not a single thing. Everything was what I read out of the papers, it was facts that I drummed into my head and that I tried so hard to make seem real, to visualise in precise depth, but I’ll always have that section missing. There’s only one memory that came back to me that I could never forget; and that was the moment that you first looked up at me when we had you on that table after recovering you from the ice…”
“But sir, he has triggers, even in his own time. Yes the easing process will be much better once we figure out a way to get him up to date by speeding up development and time for him in that mind simulator, but for now we’re focusing on trying to cure the lingering effects from the War. Once we manage to help him with those, then we’ll manage to start the time speed. But recently he’s been having severe panic attacks.” The lab assistant gestured to the screen, and on it was Steve in that street, clutching his head, gritting his teeth, down on his knees as ringing sounded through his head. The flashes of Bucky drifting away and falling into the ocean, leaving them behind flew rapidly through his thoughts.
Tony decided he’d need to push forward before more of these things came at him since he’d cleared a path but didn’t know how long exactly that would last, so he raised his legs off the ground, placing pull power in his thrusters and just used himself as a human battering ram. “Thank you Juggernaut!” He yelled as he pushed through the oncoming hoard and right to Zola.
There was a reluctant turn of his head as Reed began meandering his way around the large solid squares of machinery to his way out to get more food.
Waking up to the sound of helicopters flying over wasn’t exactly the wakeup call that Tony was expecting after a night of passion and lust. He groaned and pressed his face closer to Steve’s, kissing the super soldiers cheek, eager to see his eyes flutter open. His body shivered as the cold winds wisped through the broken windows. It didn’t help when he moved closer to Steve, considering the metal legs that his own were tangled with were only colder against his skin, making him shudder again but just clutch himself closer to any source of warmth. Steve’s torso was the best bet, making him chuff like a tiger as he nipped at Steve’s skin.
That didn’t negate the fact that it was a talking dog, which really didn’t help ease Steve’s confusion any, even with the explanation. Still, everything in the lab that he was standing in needed explaining. He’d never seen anything like it in his entire life. He curiously moved over to a lava lamp and prodding it, as though that was the strangest thing in the lab.
He knelt down and dusted off the stones that were covered with moss and dust, going from name to name. Each one a dagger in his chest.
“Well… The light… Sometimes… When you saved me a couple of times before, I guess they were particularly bright when… Well… The Red Zone, when you’d saved me there, then I returned the favour…” He shook his head, “And here I thought it was me being delusional from all the toxins in the air.”
It had certainly been a long first week for Steve; rescuing cats, one after the other. He did wonder how frequent this problem really was, if there were really that many cats stuck up trees, but having Tony there really did make the job a lot easier in the long run. He had all these fancy gadgets; from jets to torches coming out from the tips of his fingers. He would always get greeted by the others with small chuckles when they saw the scrapes and band aids that he was covered with.
Peter’s large white eyes narrowed and he aimed the next shot for Tony’s mouth, but the man tilted his head to one side and felt the sticky webbing spread over his cheek. A disgusting feeling that made him cringe.
, who would put a manhole in the desert?” Tony groaned, crouching down to remove the plate. Lo and behold, this also unlocked a passage to the undercover lab that Steve had likely been held in. Without a second of thought he jumped into it, sliding down the chute and resisting the urge to shout ‘weeeeeeeee’, after all, that would defeat the point of a surprise attack. The situation was serious but that didn’t prevent him from having a little fun with it all at Zola’s expense.
The shield flickered a few times, a drop of sweat trickled down Steve’s temple as he held himself in place, the heat from Doom’s hands being far more immense than he’d first ever anticipated, then again he didn’t expect to be dealing with a magic mad scientist who was shooting rays out of his fingertips.
“Yeah, well, depends what we find but that’d make things much easier. Why didn’t Oscorp think of that? Oh wait, like they care about the environment,” he rolled his eyes, seeing a searchlight drift by. “Quick!”
“Cap? Cap..?!” Tony spun around only to watch the star spangled man become cloaked by smoke. Then it came their way, the explosion.
Rhodey and Tony were arguing, which quite frankly was rare. Sure they would bicker and banter but not shout at one another.
“No Tony, what I’m saying is that it was our time to do this for you… I know you agreed but…”Steve stops and opens the door to reveal the fully decorated room. “…We were behind schedule, is all.” Which is what you would expect when a calamity of superheroes bundle together for a Christmas dinner.
The Captain’s eyelids languidly lifted, turning his head to cross glances with the weak dark haired man, or what was left of him. Palpitations of pain and rage were all that he could feel at that moment, and then he caught sight of his own blood stained hand, tainted with the black ooze that powered him. Steve raised it up, watching the seeping thick blood; red fused with the black of the augmentation fused blood curdle down each crease in his gauntlet.
“Yeah, true that. I am happy for being here, don’t get me wrong. Better here than being probed by an alien race or something,” he said with a shrug.
Steve felt his legs rocking, he could hear them creaking and he tried to get a footing, but it wasn’t easy. It felt like he was just learning to walk again, putting one foot in front of the other slowly but surely. The entire time Tony had his arm wrapped around Steve’s torso, just under his arms to help him stay upright. Un-level surfaces were hard to walk on as it was, Tony couldn’t begin to fathom how it felt for Steve while they were surrounded by a surface that moved under the slightest pressure. Whenever Steve felt unsteady, Tony’s grip tightened, his fingers curling into the remainder of the uniform that was left on Steve’s upper half.
Tony grit his teeth and shook his head, he could feel his eyes tearing up, he could feel the blood surge through his veins as the last sound of Captain America’s voice echoed through his memories. His body trembled and made his armour clatter, he couldn’t handle it. He couldn’t bear to think that he was gone. Countless times he’d run the scenario over in his mind and every time had the same conclusion. He kept trying to reassure himself that he’d be okay, but to think that his rudder was gone made his heart stop. He kicked the dirt with frustration and then placed his dirty hand over his face, leaning on a tree for support.
The suit still had his mind and was a darker side to him, a side he would never let show, filled with jealousy and possessiveness.
He placed Jessica down beside the plot they were digging and helped Peter out. “She’s probably…” It wouldn’t provide good morale to make a bad situation worse, especially in the boys head. “She might’ve gone into hiding, maybe she’s safe. But you know, she’ll find us and catch up eventually.” He clicked his faceplate up so his expression was in view, it was the least he could do.
Steve was up front, observing Carol pilot the jet and learning. It wasn’t too hard but he just wanted to make sure he was fully ready to drive it, though he could hear some noise coming from the back of the craft which caught his attention.
“That’s… The full line, the whole ‘I’ve been expecting you, Mr. Bond’. Which by the way is extremely flattering, I know I’m as suave as 007 himself.” Tony tipped his cap and smirked a crooked yet oddly comfortable smirk, meanwhile Steve was behind him still trying to figure out what exactly was in front of him rather than paying much mind to Tony’s antics.
He took a breath, raised his head and regained a strong confident posture again, exhaling as he folded the letter and kept it in his chest pocket of his white shirt.
Tony watched the two and gave them an eyebrow raise. Truthfully, their relationship was always obvious to him. In fact, it was something he admired; that subtle adoration. But Tony knew nothing about him was subtle, so he just admired it and knew he would never be a part of such a thing.
“You need to take him down, once he’s down we can search the building. Just tell me what to do and I’ll do it.”
“My name is Tony Stark – Anthony Edward Stark, alias: Iron Man and this… Well, is my diary? Captain’s log, some could say.”
“He’s a god damn soldier.” Tony snapped,  “Fury was blinded by his overt sense of entitlement, his logic was absurd and overprotective for a man who was used to running out into the field and getting hurt time after time.” His head turned to look down at Steve, trying to lull his gaze from that childlike awe to concern. “Now get out, and if I need you, I’ll call you.”
“Yup, got it!” They were so in sync, reaching toward the doors and using his enhanced strength, hearing the pistons in his arms activate as he used his force and pulled open the thick metal clad doors.
Steve breathed out at the sensation of the tight muscle wrapped around him and the extreme heat of Tony’s body, making sure Tony’s legs were resting on his shoulders as he began to glide his hips to start to move.
He would have assumed since they spotted him in a police uniform that he wouldn’t be called a tourist, but apparently the locals had a way of just
Steve wanted to get that sensitive reaction out of Tony, so he pushed his fingers deeper, resting his chin on Tony’s chest to observe his reaction which was a louder moan, filling the empty room with that sudden cry.
Hesitantly the boy handed the brick over. Tony licked a button that was just under his shoulder pad and wretched out one of the lasers that he had fastened there, a small precision one he had just in case he needed it, and now it was proving useful. He held it in his hand and directed the power to the stone, using it to carve her name and the date in the stone. Accidently he messed up the last number, but who could blame him. He scratched out the number and replaced it with the new one, internally cursing himself for getting it wrong in the first place. Was it wrong to be impressed with his own handiwork, even if it was on a headstone? Probably. He placed it down on top of the mound of dirt, placed his laser back on the rack just under his shoulder pad  and took a step back, looking at it with a heavy sigh with Peter standing just next to him.
“Out, both of you. Report to my office on the double.” He was sure they understood that meant get out of this place and back to the regular HQ in D.C.
“Oh, I just love winding you up, Steve,” he teased, his now fixed hand covering his mouth as it regained the appearance of a regular hand rather than the glove. “But yes, before I was on the streets as a detective I was a humble inventor.”
Well, that had been the case before they began to crumble from within, eroded by conspiracies formed within their ranks and by Namor’s appeal to the Cabal for assistance.  Life was just one big convoluted
Steve flinched lightly then let Tony stay as close as he was, wrapping his arms around the man’s lean frame, fingers gliding down his back wishing he could feel him more, his eyes saddening.
Tony was first, his boots lighting up then jets beginning to propel him upward. He straightened his posture into a more horizontal pose, turning his head toward Steve.
Even when he was flying earlier he tried to suppress how angry he was that this was real, that this could’ve been real. Internally he knew that the serum had really existed, after all, Extremis was developed upon the foundation of the initial serum, but that didn’t prevent resentment from simmering knowing that there could’ve been other heroes to help him had they been given the serum. Extremis was different, it was something he would never share for a number of different reasons, particularly down to the risks that came with it, but the super soldier serum in its purest form perhaps could’ve taken things down a different road entirely.
Steve nodded, proud of his friend too. It was hard to think that someone who just wanted to do a good job had so much hatred directed toward him because he was modified, that shouldn’t have made a difference. In society, moving forward, Steve yearned for equality and this was a small step that they had to take. If he had to pave the way, then so be it, he was glad to do so. “So let’s just keep up the good work…”
Tony wanted Steve to smile at that, at least let out a small chuckle but he didn’t even spot so much as a flick of the corner of his lips. The man was dead set on getting Tony to pull the trigger.
He had to get over it, he had to push himself up properly and find Steve under all of this rubble, but that was much easier said than done. Instinctively he kept trying to reach out using his left hand to accompany the right, but of course it was impossible now.
“In my defence-“ Detective Stark chimed in “-The first guy I didn’t know was afraid of heights, the second… He shouldn’t have used so much product in his hair, I didn’t know he’d be a walking fire hazard, the third guy – now
Steve rubbed his cleanly shaven chin, biting the inside of his lip with a pensive furrow if his brow. “You got any details?”
“Don’t lie!” Tony’s tone gradually became more ferocious. He didn’t want to lose Steve after he had just gotten him back, straight away he took a glance over his shoulder at Steve, making sure he was okay. The Captain was fine, his eyes focused on the man walking toward them and taking according steps backward, even though Steve was never one to cower away. He was only moving back because Tony was the one taking the steps backward until they backed into the main computer which they were using in the first place.
From loud wailing and pounding on the screen to scratching and tearing at the walls. A super soldier with a deadly virus infecting him made him into a creature that had yet to be categorised properly by the others. While rigor mortis was taking effect and causing Steve to walk with an awkward posture, he was still alive, somehow.
The Captain took a heavy breath as he felt one of the feathers on his wings drop and fall to the ground. It was a painful sensation, as though his heart had truly hit the floor and created this dull ache in his chest. The more Tony was doubting him the more it was hurting him, the more damaging it was to his heart as it instilled doubt in his heart and mind as to whether he was finally just losing it.
Peter was his priority, he was young, he was strong and he had the most to lose from all of this. The question was, was his armour up to the challenge?
Everything was on loop, a systematic loop that would change when the scientists added more variables to the equation. This was all to keep him safe, all to keep him in his bubble not only because he wasn’t ready for the world of
He nodded and began to look around to soak in his surroundings. This was the place he would now practically be living in. He’d be surrounded by these people every day so he had better learn to get along.
He punched the floor next to the man, leaving a large crack. For once, having a completely metal arm proved worth it otherwise he would feel that instantly, even though his armoured gauntlet. Tony got to his feet, turning around as fast as he could and running to Steve, only to be greeted by a punch to the face. The hefty metal gauntlet made full impact with his helmet and send him back to the ground. The genius looked up with horror; tasting the blood swirl in his mouth as Steve stood above him, eyes that extreme cyan once again.
Tony had remembered he’d programmed it differently, it didn’t run on the run of the mill software – this was something that he had worked long and hard for, including a chip that made it impervious to viruses.
They laughed and walked by unfazed, leaving the two to get out themselves, while Steve took a couple of steps back and began trying to ram his shoulder into the bars, cracking and bending his once broad shoulder but carrying on, throwing himself mindlessly against the gates until the bars did bend. Tony then scrambled to the mauled poll and began to pull at it until it bent even more.  Tony crawled out first; always finding it easier to crawl out of smaller spaces, Steve on the other hand had a little more problem with his broad stature but managed to tug his way past. Now that they were out in the open the injuries Steve had were far more visible; tears on his skin and casual gear, blasts from retaliation strikes from his kills. Tony didn’t nearly look as bad but Steve was starting to show much more wear and tear.
“Seen it for myself; Moon knight was with us, he was caught in that glass cell and he went insane. Went crazy and started attacking everyone, killed your friend in red, the blind punk. Then he just dropped and they took him away… The next day that was aired everywhere. ‘Superheroes are evil’. That headline with the footage was broadcasted around the world, so I’ve been told. Now everyone fears you guys, and we ain’t no different. They can’t tell the difference between us and you,” he explained bitterly, with a hint of disgust trailing his last few words.
“Not just any ‘mutt’, a sophisticated supercomputer, capable of hacking your systems.” JARVIS replied in his thick, pronounced Queen’s-English accent.
The car sat in the middle of the lab, ready to be worked on. Right away bots scattered around it, eagerly examining it.
…Not that he’d done that before. Actually, that was a lie, he’d done that before. Only once at a frat party during his time in MIT. Come on, he was 18.
Steve sympathised and gave Tony a comforting stare that spoke far louder than actions and was enough to stop any more tears. “I know. You gave me a home, Tony. And I trust with all my heart that you’ll be able to build something better, something bigger and something for us all. This time, it’ll be better.”
Steve’s heart was buzzing with adrenaline, running as quickly as he could and zipping past Tony to help this young woman. Tony pouted when he was overtaken, by foot no less, “Go go Stark rocket boots!”  he jumped up with his boots catching the light again, just as they had done before, the cyan glow illuminating the grass below whist he quickly sped past Steve- the boots allowing him to fly far higher than the already tall policeman was.
“I’ll hold you to that promise, Steve,” Tony murmured against his shirt, reluctantly pulling back to look at the screen.
Tony and Steve nodded, shooting and slamming anything that came near them, creating a path for Janet and Natasha to follow, approaching the huge metal doors that belonged to the upper lab.
“How?” He asked. Magic was never an explanation, even though he’d experienced it first hand with Doctor Strange and Thor being in their team.
“Where, Steve?” He asks, as though he were intent on helping out. Truth be told, he was more into the supervising gig, and watching helplessly whilst his home was destroyed in the process of decorating.
Steve summoned a small smile, one that tucked the side of his lips upwards. “Considering I’ve been here all of five minutes… I think we’re going to make a great team.”
“Tony, this is the best course of action. I know this may be hard on you since you were there at the time, and you and Steve are extremely close. This time, you
Tony skated on the road as though he were on a jet-ski, zooming down along with the strange car’s every move. The wind pushed through his jacket and caused it to fly and flap around in the wind, oh the joys of having long clothing. He was about to reach for his hat to keep it on but when he lifted his hand from the bumper he almost flew off course, so he quickly tried to hoist himself onto the back of the car. There really was no time to waste.
as they reached the top floor. The weighted silver doors opened and in front of them was the hoard of bots they were expecting, geared and ready to open fire.  Arrows shot through the window, firing and picking off a couple of bots – Clint was doing his work well.
“You know what, let’s not go to NYC, we’ll go there later. We’ll head down to New Orleans now – one of America’s biggest World War II collections are there, it’ll be easier to catch you up.” He gestured to the pilot and gave him the orders, with Steve left a little confused and dumbfounded at the idea that most of the objects from his age were now artefacts in a museum.
All of the others stared at one another and shrugged. The serious atmosphere dissipated for a  mere second as Tony glanced up and blinked, realising that none of them had really had a head on encounter with Hammer. This was personal, and no one really knew how much it meant to Tony. There was something about Hammer that irked him in a particular way. It made his blood boil to see a crooked man wondering around and trying to compete with him on such an amateur level.  He said amateur mainly because Hammer often didn’t fully understand the extent to which his projects devastated those around him. Plus, he reminded Tony of a friend of his from high school in the way he would always try and compete with him; Tiberus Stone. But that was another long story for another day.
Tony could hardly see. Everything was blurry and the room was spinning, but eventually he managed to get a somewhat clearer image. He was in an office, a huge office. A black desk before him with the typical paperweights on them. He shut his eyes for a moment, too pained to keep them open. When he opened them a silhouette stood before him, looming over him. He had his hair gelled back perfectly, arms behind his back standing in his debonair stance.  He coughed a little. Steve flinched at the sight, again his eyes flickering, eyebrows slanting in a way that indicated pain.
“Look at him, his body is weak, without the right blood in it, with that virus inside him it’s making him weak. We need to keep his strength up and the only way we can is by feeding him. Look here.” Tony gestured to the monitors. “You see how it’s metabolising fast and going straight into his blood stream, we need to keep getting him more food, come on, you get the food and I’ll keep an eye on hm.”
Steve stepped up to him, dragging the leaper’s feet on the ground effortlessly. “You okay there?” He asked with soft concern, eyes on his hand.
He was always so understanding, even when they argued, Steve would come across as though he’d clearly assessed both points of view. Tony scooted to the side, allowing Steve some space to sit next to him, though Steve approached with such tentative steps and sat slightly distanced from him, careful not to sit on the wings that were drooping lazily across the sheets, unable to support themselves.
It felt as though he was flying through a maze with all of these symmetrical, non-distinguishable buildings.  He raised his jets, aiming to get a little higher onto the rooftops so he could get  a bird’s eye view of things, though that meant he’d be easily spotted, he just had to rely on his speed and luck just for that quick moment.
“That’s JARVIS, one of my first creations. His AI runs throughout this entire lab, he can speak through any machine but since I built that robot dog in my teens, I’m pretty attached to it. So he chooses to stay in there most of the time and keep me company when I’m out and about.”
Steve’s eyes widened and he turned to Tony as though he’d just snapped out of a daze, staring at his hand then at the punching bag, rubbing his head.
“Stop!” Tony called from the back, trying to tug at the bot, but it just began to stride forward and grabbed Steve, carrying him over to something that Tony had locked away a long time ago, smashing through the doors and tearing through the locks as though they were sheets of paper.  Tony ran after him, knowing that the bot was going for something that he had long since stopped working on, one of the biggest and deadliest missiles he’d ever made back during the time that Stark Industries was actually a weapons manufacturer. Steve wouldn’t go without a fight, he was kicking and pulling away, but even with his extreme strength he couldn’t quite outmatch the huge suit of armour. Tony had to think quickly, and the only way he could stop the suit was to put on a prototype that he had stored away for emergencies, so he ran as fast as he could to unlock it. In the meantime the huge suit of armour pulled Steve to his feet, only for the super solider to give it a massive kick in the chest, throwing all of his weight into it. The soldier immediately tasted the rancid hint of copper that pooled in his mouth when more blood spilled. The sentient armour staggered back, just for a moment, and Steve took the chance to throw another punch at him. It was hard to fight something that was just a hollow suit of armour, but as he threw the punch his fist was grabbed and yanked back. Steve could feel his shoulder pop and let out a loud grunt while the armour grabbed the chains that had once held the huge doors shut, and wrapped them around Steve. Without even having to type commands in the huge suit managed to activate the countdown. The virus that was inside it was spreading, as it did when he had touched that helper-bot.
Steve wasn’t completely unconscious, he was still there and mumbling gibberish, his arms tightly wrapped around Tony who was having trouble balancing the weight of the man in his arms upon his unstable augmentation. Not to mention Steve had gotten significantly heavier with all of that armour of his. At least that gave Tony more parts to work with; Steve was a super soldier, he didn’t really need armour. He could survive without it which meant Tony could have more material to utilise.
“UGH!” he yelled, smacking away the arm as it crashed to the floor with another loud noise that rippled throughout the room, the sharp grey eyes didn’t look impressed in the slightest and only caused the hair on the back of Steve’s neck to stand, but he had to perceiver, if not for Reed, then for Tony. Now it was the cop’s time to use that distraction, helping Tony and tossing the tube of toothpaste that had appeared from his jacket back where it belonged.  He whispered a tiny “Thanks Steve.” Under his breath, gently pushing Steve back and in front of him so that he could protect him. In this type of situation Steve felt useless; he was up against someone with seemingly magical powers, projecting energy blasts straight at them.
Clint continued to laugh, telling the others that walked in who joined him in a chorus of giggles, each patting Steve on the shoulder sympathetically. Steve didn’t understand. There were a number of questions popping into his head at that moment; who was ‘the detective’ and what was so terrible about him? Every time he received a pat or a squeeze on the shoulder he could feel another butterfly appear in his stomach. His lips lined strictly together and he gulped nervously, his eyes going back to the guy locked up behind those heavy silver iron bars.
The first thing was first, he needed to get his armour fixed and Steve back into fighting shape and he needed to get his helmet back from the hospital.
“Sorry. Well, if it helps any, yours looks cooler than any I’ve seen, and I’ve seen loads on the market. Everyone wants one nowadays.”
The man with the eyepatch cleared his throat, gave Tony a filthy look and paused for a second longer just to make him squirm before he proceeded to tell his story. “That bomb was a bio chemical weapon. To this day, no one knows what it does exactly or who sent it, that’s why we need you. You’re the missing piece. You of all people should thrive in this new era.”
Steve gasped, observing how Doom lurched toward Tony and quickly waved his hands at him as a distraction whilst Tony got himself sorted. “Hey, big guy! Over here!”
The tension was thick. It was difficult to breathe. But deep breaths, just like Steve had taught him. Lungs flooding with blood from internal wounding would be no obstacle, because he knew the next few moments would be the last he had to save everyone.
Tony’s eyes opened with much protest and met Steve’s dark, lust shaded eyes, shadowed by his messy hair.
Steve winced, the shield finally fading which gave Doom the chance to raise his hand and slam it down with a tremendous back-hand, the metal colliding with Steve’s face as he dropped to the ground. It was the hardest hit he had ever felt in his life, and growing up in Brooklyn he’d sure felt plenty of hard hits before. The power of metal behind it must have added some extra weight, and if that wasn’t enough the hand was already crackling with energy that coursed through Steve’s system simultaneously and caused him to collapse to those smooth marble floors, unconscious.
“What can I say, I was busy you know, actually working… In space.” Tony retorts whilst waggling his finger at Luke, quickly withdrawing his hand before the man slaps it away.
Now it was part of him, more so than before. As if his arc reactor wasn’t enough integration. But as long as it was keeping him functional, as his reactor was, then it served a purpose and it did no harm. But that was his limit; he didn’t want to become any more of a machine than that.
He pointed to his arm. “See, augmented. But I customised it myself, got rid of some wiring, mainly inbuilt tracking technology that is in all of the augmentations. Basic GPS sort of stuff but it’s active in all of those things, even yours. You have to let me take it out, for your own safety.”
That second, it clicked, those were wings. Tony had wings. That instant Steve finally was hit with the realisation that all the past, all of what he had thought was a dream was in fact, reality. He felt his own wings suddenly fan out, taking him almost by surprise as he glanced back and noticed them. All this time he had thought that it was a dream and had lost faith, he had become blinded by other obligations of being a superhero that his own wings had become invisible. Now that he saw Tony’s, his own reacted, the feathers fanning out and shuddering at the sight of the shadows that indicated that Tony in fact, still had his wings. This couldn’t possibly be the angel could it? The angel that he was told to retrieve by that voice? Tony seemed to be a lot of things, but never an angel. Sure he was kind, gallant, loyal, strong, selfless… Okay, maybe he did possess a lot of angelic qualities, but he also used to be ruthless, a merchant of death and an alcoholic. That probably explained why his wings looked so horrid, so broken and destroyed and coated in black tar.
