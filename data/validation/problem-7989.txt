The paper gown is, at best, a size to small, but it was obviously made for the typical petite omega. Steve, with his broad shoulders and boxy frame, was not made for something so delicate as paper.
Toni was still laughing when Steve slid over a plate. Budda bowl with chicken, brown rice, broccoli, and almonds, all foods from the recommended foods list for pre pregnancy women. Steve had been meticulous in taking in information over the last few months. He had read every book and article he could get his hands on, talked to Dr. Cho about what methods were best and things to expect. Sometimes it felt he was 5 steps ahead and kept forgetting they had to get pregnant first.
“Relax, Steve. Makes this a lot easier if you stay relaxed.” The tantalizing fingers find that magical bundle of nerves and Steve is heaving like he ran a marathon to keep from coming instantly. They push against the sensitive spot top to bottom repeatedly. “Everything feels equal and smooth. The central line is intact. Now I’m going to put in the speculum and take a few samples. How are you doing up there, Steve?”
They finished quickly, the work always going faster with two. Tony stood, glanced at the clock, “Looks like it’s almost that time. What do you say about one more for the road?” He motioned to the wooden box off to the right of the altar. Just looking at the chamber sent tentacles of anxiousness throughout his stomach.
Once the samples have been deposited into their tubes and placed on the tray, Tony looks at him over the sheet, “Steve, You don’t have to do this. You stop now and no one would judge you. Your heats will return to normal and you’ll get better at dealing with them. No harm, no foul.”
Dr. Cho had recommended a few treatment plans that could help remedy the issues with Toni’s uterus. There has been tons of drugs, time in the cradle, even holistic approaches. Anything that could help and Steve didn’t have to know about. But it seemed like none of that was working, there was no improvement.
Steve must be sensitive, but he kept rocking back and forth to tease Toni. He hadn’t gone soft yet, that delicious full feeling still consuming her senses. Not much longer and she’d be joining him in bliss, orgasm just out of reach.
“Tell me, my child.” Father Rogers prompted.
Eventually, when Tony was fully hard, the hands pulled Steve off completely. “Clothes off and hands against the window.” Steve quickly stripped off his shirt and jeans, hissing as his burning length was freed from a denim prison. The glass was cold under his hands, like the ache that fills his bones when Tony is gone. But Tony’s here now, with him, so he is filled with the heat he craves.
“Lust is a hard one to battle with at this age, but acknowledgment is the first step in getting on the right path. You said you believe this person is interested in you, that is a good sign right?” Father Rogers sounded robotic, detached from the words he was saying.
Today was a good day.
Second time was while stationed in London after Project Rebirth. He met Jack Kenley, a Colonel in the British Armed Service, after a joint mission between both countries. Jack had been drafted into the Great War in January of ‘18 at 19 and ended up making a career out of his service. Steve was older this time, he knew what the feeling was he got when Jack would give him a smirk in the mess. This feeling led to several wonderful nights of exploration in dingy barracks and back rooms. Jack was older, wiser, and spent most of his life surrounded by men, so of course Steve would have been drawn to him. Steve always did know how to find danger.
Typically Steve didn't talk about his life before the ice and almost never before the war, maybe those memories were just too raw to relive again and again. But sometimes, times like now when they were planning for the future, he would get this kind of sadness about him that only seemed curable by putting words to memories, by telling stories of the ones left behind.
“Hi Steve. I’m Dr. Tony Stark,” greets the alpha. Steve knows he is alpha even through the required scent blockers. It must be in the way he carries himself or how the scent of alpha lingers on his clothes. He offers his hand to Steve to shake and Steve’s cock immediately takes interest through the paper sheet.
“Steve, right there, Steve. Babe. STEVE.” Toni wailed, walls clamping down on Steve’s hand. His other hand petted at her side to calm down her frantic jolts of aftershock.
“A few, none vaginally.” The term makes his skin crawl.
“Language, Tony.” It is automatic, Steve didn’t even think through what he was saying.
That must have spurred Steve on, because the pace picked up, that being the only encouragement he needed. “Steve, baby, that feels so good. You feel amazing on my dick.”
They had played around with including a few rougher elements in their sex life from time to time, Tony requesting that Steve pull his hair and throw in a few ass slaps every few strokes. But nothing like this. This was never part of what they discussed, hell, this wasn’t something that was hinted. Why did Tony let it get this far?
The latch on the door was the only sound in the room when Steve entered. Tony didn’t turn to look at him, just continued to look out as the rain pelted against the floor-to-ceiling glass window. He didn’t notice the tumbler in Tony’s hand until he sat it down on the side table next to him. They stood there, neither talking, for what was probably minutes but felt like hours to Steve.
“Any new partners in the last year?”
Three years later and not much has changed. Tony and Pepper are off living their perfect post-Thanos life and raising a beautiful dark haired daughter. Steve feels stuck, living the same miserable day over and over in the Compound. Wake up in the bed they use to share, try to heal those that are broken but ignore the burnt parts of himself, reminisce about the past, and go to sleep in the last place he held Tony Stark.
How do you come back from that? How do you pick up the remains of a ruined life and put it back together again? Answer, you don’t. You take these pieces and repurpose them in something new, to never fit as they one did, always carrying the evidence of the burns they’ve endured.
The first thing Steve noticed was the perfect red handprint on Tony’s right ass cheek, God, that must have stung. He was going to have a horrible time sitting down for a few days, at least. Next were the purple hickies that littered his back and neck, some were outlined by angry teeth marks. Finally he caught sight of Tony’s battered, loose asshole when he leaned forward ever so slightly.
“Do you have any questions, Steve?” He shakes his head ashamed. “Alright, give us a call back if you have any issues and see the nurse at the front to schedule your next appointment.” Then he’s out the door.
The final trial was during his monthly confessional Tony brought up a recent one night stand, retelling the event in agonizing detail from the lust he felt when he saw her across at the party to the mortal sin of fucking her that night. This was a two part test on his part, the first time he focused more on his partner; her beauty, what she liked, his lust for her. Then the second he gave more detail around his experience; what she did to him, his lust, and his pleasure. Both were much more detailed than necessary for a purging of sin, but it helped gauge Steve’s reaction. How much did he squirm, did his pants tent more after the second, did he breath heavier?
Tony purred as Steve wrapped his arms around his torso, “There you are, baby.” The rivets of water provided a slick slide as Steve’s hands traced the marks along Tony stomach and thighs, his cock hanging half hard just from these simple touches. Steve slapped the bite marks on the inside of Tony’s thigh and Tony groaned, finding pleasure in the pain. Well, that proves it.
There were a few moments where Tony thought he misjudged the situation, where he stood there with his dick through a hole like a bad porno. The first tentative lick came to the purpling mushroom head, lapping up the precome before it dropped. The tongue traced the sensitive veins below the tip. He whimpered when the tongue disappeared only to be engulfed by the heat of a hot, wet mouth.
“Fuck, Steve. Yes! I wanna be filled with you. Please, Steve, please.”
“You did when you made me the leader of the Avengers.”  Steve retorted.
Steve closed the distance between them in 4 long strides, moving faster than ever outside of battle, cradling her head gently. Toni prepared for a crushing assault of lips, but none came. Instead he gazed at her like she was a magnificent diamond; strong, resilient, beautiful. Blue eyes searched her face for trepidation, fear, for a sign to stop, but why fear the start of something beautiful.
“Understand?” Tony said again, expecting an answer. When Steve remained quiet, “I guess that’s how it’s going to be today then, huh?” was all he got before Tony’s palm slapped against his ass. Heat bloomed where the hand landed, sparks shot up his spine, this waks the good stuff.
Tony laughed, but the sound held no humor, “Is that what you say to your support group? God, who ever thought it was a good idea for you to be leading a bunch of broken people should be punched.”
Recent blood work has shown no sign of improvement of critical levels. Patient’s’ uterus continues to be a hostile environment for a fetus. Chances of conceiving, <2%.”
“Are we dating?”
The nerves ratchet higher as the floor numbers blink past. Why is he so anxious about going to the doctor? When he was 90 pounds soaking wet and barely 5’3 the hospital felt like home as much as his apartment did. It was always warm and had loads of people to talk to, something his lonely Brooklyn room lacked.
“We’re moving to California, not Mars.” Tony rolled his eyes. “Plus SI still has a headquarters here, I’m sure we’ll be back before you could miss us.”
The kisses descended back down after a few quick pecks to her lips, preceded by Steve’s hands tugging at her leggings until they were out of the way and off the bed. Steve’s soft breath ghosted over Toni’s soaked cunt, sending chills down her spine and quiet cries falling from her lips. A tentative tongue traced the pink folds of labia, moving them apart to lap at the tangy nectar between.
In the army, having the implant was not a choice, it was a byproduct of the job. Soldiers can not worry about being out of commission for 3 days every few months, who knows when the urge could hit. In a camp full of alphas? In the battlefield? That’s why it was standard that all omegas have implants and everyone wore scent blockers.
Dr. Stark cuts the strings and pulls out the speculum, “The cervix opens up at the apex of an orgasm, typically to let semen in. It is the least painful approach. You might bleed for a few days, but should be over by the end of the week. Your body will take about 3 months to adjust to the device and you might lose your heats within the first year. Given your history, I would almost guarantee yours will stop fairly quickly.. Take some over the counter pain medication and rest for today.”
Her bra came off next, revealing olive toned breast with dusty pink, pinpoint nipples. Toni has never had large breasts, especially after the arc reactor took up residence on her chest. While never one to be embarrassed by her body, self consciousness started to seep since Afghanistan. There are scars that marr tender tissue and slightly lopsided boobs due to the housing unit.
Humiliation filled Steve’s stomach, but underneath the hatred he felt for himself was satisfaction and pleasure. He clung to that feeling like a drowning man to a raft. Saying it the first time was always the hardest, admitting in those moments that he wanted to say it, to want Tony to be that for him.
“You sick fuck, what did you do? What did you do?!”
“Yeah, well. I never said all my ideas were good.” Tony finally turned to look at him. Steve just saw him an hour ago, but now he takes the time to really look. The first thing he notices is how tired Tony looks, today must have been hard on him, there is darkness around his eyes and an invisible weight on his shoulders. The one dark locks have faded into a light peppering of grey throughout, Tony will make an incredible silver fox in a few years. But those eyes are the same as the day in the lab, some things never change, even with time. “On your knees. Use your mouth until I’m hard.”
Steve, kind and considerate Steve, always took the time to get her off first or early on, even when they were in a rush. Toni asked him about it once and he said it was hard for him to get pleasure thinking that her needs weren’t fulfilled. She tried to tell him that getting fucked by a grade A stud was enough to fulfill her needs, but he insisted that it wasn’t right for Steve to come multiple times and Toni got none. Who was she to argue?
Arto nods. “Sir, yes, sir,” he grins back, and Steve laughs too.
He says it without an ounce of shame, and Nick genuinely doesn’t know if he’s being trolled or not. “My pleasure,” he says. “I like the kid. Not so much when he’s talking Stark at me, but he’s a good kid.”
They stop once in Pennsylvania to stretch their legs and get coffee. Steve has gone from making awful jokes to not saying anything at all. Arto has got no idea how to make it better so he doesn’t say anything either.
Steve clears his throat, looks at Arto. “If you’re coming, you’re not just walking out. You're coming with me to explain to Tony that you’re coming.”
Arto thinks about that. “Don’t you get scared that she won’t be your friend if she’s not there?”
"Always," Steve says. "You sure you don't want me to stay?"
He’s simply stating it as a fact, but it makes Tony well up alarmingly. He wipes his eyes on the back of his hand. “Yeah,” he says, voice thick. “Okay, are you taking this call to Steve or are we hanging up so I can call him?”
“Everyone stares when you drive this car,” he says.
“We will not,” Arto says indignantly, overlapped immediately by Steve saying, “Yeah I guess.”
If only children came with a manual, this whole parenting thing would be a butt-load easier.
Bucky’s eyes narrow. Oh no. Oh no, that doesn’t bode well for Arto. “Don’t make me make a point.”
“Hey Steve, I need you to come and sign some paperwork,” a voice calls from the top of the open stairwell, and Steve drops his hands to glare balefully at the bit of Clint he can see. He’s about to tell him to shove his paperwork, when he catches the way Clint is staring meaningfully at him. He acquiesces and goes over, following Clint down several steps so they’re out of tiny-spy hearing range.
“Sure,” Natasha says. “Shall we talk about how the Young Avengers including the love of your life are back in for training soon?”
“Hey, I’m careful,” Steve says, getting ready to throw Anna back up again.
“No, don’t go,” Arto says quickly. “I’m okay, I just want to go back to sleep.”
“No-one is going to be mad at you,” Steve says. “Me, on the other hand.”
Steve grinned and hugged him back. “Love you too, kidlet.”
“Knew he’d still be in bed,” he says pointedly to Peter and Omari.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. “It sucks, kiddo. But Kate is a different age bracket than you, which means it’s a no go. By all means, think that she’s pretty, but don’t beat yourself up over it. And also, I am not having a kid of mine marry a Hawkeye. I’m sorry, but it’s not happening.”
“In the workshop,” Clint says with an apologetic grimace as Arto grits his teeth. Tony has been in the workshop non-stop for
And he slides down the wall in sheer giddy relief as Omari picks up. “Hi,” he manages to say, his voice trembling as much as his hands.
Steve nods. “I guess we’re both pretty bad at talking about feelings, huh.”
“No,” Steve says. “Most days. If I’ve not seen him in a few days I’ll check in.”
“Bucky,” Steve lies.
“I’ve been thinking a lot,” Peter says, suddenly awkward. The atmosphere in the room goes from super happy to super serious in two seconds flat. “Hey, is Jarvis here?”
“You asked the one question that was guaranteed to knock me on my ass,” Steve says gently. “But I shouldn’t have reacted like such a dick. So I’m sorry.”
Tony shrugs. “Boredom? Habit? Because you’d started chewing them again?” He looks like he’s got something else to add but then stops and shakes his head like he’s waking himself up. His attention goes back to Arto’s nails. “So these are the real deal, huh? Ran out of your own polish?”
Behind him, Arto hears Steve make a strangled sound. Bucky runs into the room with Clint right on his heels; Bucky has just a towel wrapped around his waist and skids to a halt so suddenly that Clint crashes into his back, nearly dropping the baby monitor that he’s got clutched in his hand. “What did we miss?!”
“Will you be here when I get back?” Arto asks anxiously.
Next morning, Steve is awake before Arto. Arto knows this because Steve wakes him up by tugging on his ear in a pretty obvious case of petty revenge.
Arto isn’t thinking about how cute his baby sister is, he’s thinking about how her headband matches his nails.
“I like it. Very modern. Clean lines. Colours.” Tony waves a hand vaguely at the wall. “Hey, my home has an original Rogers on the wall. Probably doubled the value. I’ll call in an agent. See if I’m right.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Bucky’s already married, I can’t marry him,” he says, and then hastily backtracks, possibly when he sees the look on Arto’s face. “Sorry, bad joke. The only person I want to be married to is Tony.”
“It’s gone ten,” Arto says.
There’s suddenly a painful lump in his throat, the double-whammy of Steve offering to read the books for him and mentioning Tony hitting him hard. He nods mutely, tries to think of what to say.
And he pretty much has a heart attack anyway as he steps out of the elevator to find Anna toddling towards him as fast as her little legs can carry her. He makes a wordless exclamation and runs to her, scooping her up and making her shriek with laughter.
“Hey, Smart Art,” Tony says wearily as he turns back, brushing his knuckles against Arto’s cheek. “Hey, can I borrow your ears for a moment?”
Steve unhooks his sunglasses from his shirt, slipping them on and making a big deal of looking for other cars as he switches lanes. “Chicago.”
He texts Omari a string of multi-coloured hearts and barely has time to hit send before a hand is closing around his phone and tugging it away from him.
Tony looks up at Steve, smirk on his face. “Most definitely.”
“Don’t
sounds super childish.
“Whoa, time out,” Steve calls, and he’s up before he realises he’s made the decision to intervene. “Arto, stop.”
“No I’m saying it because you’re more important.”
Bucky pauses. “He has, kinda,” he admits. “Wow, deja vu. Me and Steve had this conversation like a week ago. So if it’s any consolation, you’re handling it better than Steve?”
Tony rubs his face, looks up to meet Arto’s eyes. “With your permission, I’d like to talk to Steve about this. About how we can help you.”
“I think he might be a tad spoiled,” Tony says, leaning down to heft Arto up off the floor and sitting down with him, rocking him back and forth and trying to shush him, a gentle hand running over his head.
"You are not, stop interfering with things you're scared of because you don't understand it-"
Arto nods, and holds on tight.
Tony sighs but capitulates and within half hour he, Bucky and Steve are digging into a mountain of handmake Stark pancakes. Once he’s fed and able to focus on anything but his belly he starts thinking about the whole Steve-and-Tony making up and making out situation. He’s still distantly aches with hurt over Tony’s choice to put himself at risk, and if he remembers the arguing and shouting it makes him feel really unsteady…
“Steve and Tony,” Arto whispers. “Fighting.”
“Yes, I’d say so.”
“No,” Arto says. “Maybe next time. Maybe next time I’ll make Bucky come with me.”
Arto would argue, but he kind of wishes that too. For once, he’s truly grateful for Steve’s dogged determination to fix everything for him; this is not something he wants to tackle on his own.
“Yes and there’s only ten and I
“I did tell him to call you,” Coulson says bluntly.
Arto laughs, climbing out of bed. “Fuck,” he says, running at his tired eyes.
“He can and will knock you off there,” Tony calls from his place opposite Steve at the island counter, eyes fixed on the circuit boards in front of him and screwdriver in hand. Next to Tony, Bruce is nursing a mug of tea between his palms and watching Arto and Clint with an amused smile on his face.
Arto runs. He runs all the way up to his room, pulling his phone out of his pocket. His hands are shaking as he finds Omari’s number and hits dial. He holds the phone to his ear, backing right up against the wall and feeling pretty much like his chest is caving in.
Eh, Clint’s smart. He’ll work it out.
“Yep,” Steve says, with a not-really-that-apologetic smile. “About once a year he asks me if he can teach you martial arts or boxing or something. Says it'd be good for you. Turns out he was right.”
Arto feels his chin tremble. “Bucky says I’ve.”
“I did,” Tony says. “No, I am not ordering you one of everything.”
“Arto, where are you?! You’ve not been at school for like a week.”
“No,” Arto says.
He reaches for his phone, starts to smile as he opens a text to Omari and Peter.
Steve hums at that, nodding. “Yeah, I’d probably ask Bucky, too.”
“Bacon and waffles?”
“Don’t sweat it,” Tony says quietly. “We got you.”
“Anna, Anna,” he says, pressing kisses all over her face. “I missed you, oh my god.”
What is his brain
“You’re a good child,” Steve says. “Possibly one of my very favourites.”
He pulls open the door and is promptly almost knocked over by a whirlwind of arms and legs and frantic babbling.
“I’ll always come back for you,” he says into Arto’s hair. “Always. You got that?”
“No,” Arto says, giving Bucky a
“You’re kidding?”
“He’s never normal,” Bucky says with a grin, and Clint pulls a face at him.
“No, Tony,” Steve says with a sigh, and goes to step in before the coffee table meets an untimely end.
He slides his phone under his pillow and closes his eyes, wishing he was little enough to get away with crawling into Steve’s bed so he didn’t have to feel so alone.
“I’m hard as nails,” Bucky says. “You’re like a half-grown super-soldier. And your dad may be gay as shit but he’s also scary as shit, so you’re wearing gloves. I don’t wanna get in trouble.”
“Are you going to ask me questions all day?” he asks, not looking up.
Rounding the corner, Arto and Steve both let out a string of curse words at the exact same time.
They drop off their bags at a motel and then head to a diner. It’s run down and tired looking but it serves burgers and Arto is starving so he doesn’t care about the peeling vinyl and cracked seats. Steve doesn’t seem to give a shit either, slumping back against the booth and ordering double portions of everything. That earns him a sideways glance, and Arto can pinpoint the exact moment that the server recognises them.
He feels oddly lighter after his conversation with Steve, like he’s given himself permission to let go of some of the anger that he was feeling towards Tony. The message from Tony has certainly helped as well, like Tony telling him that he expected them to have it out validates Arto’s anger, which weirdly makes it go away a little. It’s like knowing he’s allowed to be mad makes it easier to not be mad in such an overwhelming way.
“Where is your eye?”
“Uh, you’re babbling,” Arto says.
don’t talk to Tony.”
“Alright. I’m gonna go call Omari and Peter.”
Arto folds his arms over his chest. “Promise?”
“Good evening, beloved.”
“What if I poked it?”
“I did not sign up for this!” Tony shouts but Clint is already on his way out. “Find out why Arto is being weird!”
“Hey,” he murmurs.
White room. Tiles that are cold. He fearfully presses his hand to the glass of the door and feels it buzzing, vibrating. It gets louder. Rattling in its frame.
“You let go,” Arto pants, trying to kick Peter's feet away. “I was having ten million crisises and you weren’t there!”
Bucky’s mouth twitches, like he knows exactly what Arto is after. “Okay. I think they're bright, which suits you and the glitter is great. But a lot of people are going to start looking at you because you're blurring traditional gender boundaries and a lot of people are going to say it's gay as shit.”
“I don’t want to watch the gala!”
Tony feels his heart break a lot, at that. “Because you have one father who is hyper-verbal, one who can’t deal with serious conversations to save his life, and you spent the first six years of your life with no-one but Hydra scientists to talk to. Oh, and your best friend is practically mute and your other best friend is equally as socially awkward as you?”
An hour and a half later and he finally slinks out of the bathroom. Steve is up now, in the kitchen and unpacking groceries that he’s clearly had delivered. He gives Arto a flat look as Arto wanders in, and Arto maybe thinks he missed the mark on casual.
“As strong as you?” Arto says.
“I am defending him as my husband and your father,” Steve says. “I am not defending what he did.”
“He’ll do it,” Steve shrugs. “Won’t bat an eye.”
“Pancakes,” Arto says, leaning over the counter and turning beseeching eyes on Tony. “Please?”
Arto stares at Anna, at her fluffy dark hair that’s been rucked up by the headband. She’s still curiously tugging at it and Bucky and Clint are fussing with her, smiling and laughing. Even Sam is coming over, leaning over Clint’s shoulder and saying how damn cute she is. Christ, any more talk about Anna being cute and Bucky will actually explode with pride.
“That when we go home you learn some more self defence with Bucky.”
“Shut up,” Steve says evenly, looking down at the tablet.
“So,” Nick says easily, slipping his hands into his pockets as the glass door softly
“I’ll take Magic Maximoff,” Bucky says. “Fifty bucks.”
“Lies and slander,” Steve says. He does stop bouncing Anna around though, keeping her held up with one arm. “When did you get in?”
and promptly hates his stupid enhanced hearing.
Arto just shrugs. “Where’s Dad?”
“I know,” Tony says, and slips his sunglasses back on, pleased that Arto at least sounds like himself again. “Eat your pancakes. They’ll heal your broken heart.”
“No biting,” he says to Bucky, fingers tapping at the plates.
“So, your brain is breaking.”
“Is it a metal eye like Bucky’s metal arm?”
He does. Its electrifying: the sensation of taking it all out on the bag, the thrill of knowing he’s not supposed to be doing this, the idea that he’s allowed to just let go for once.
Still in full panic mode, he reaches out and abruptly hangs up the phone.
Arto nods dumbly.
“You moved us!” Steve interrupts. “Without asking!”
And he knows whose stupid fault that is. “Peter hasn’t tried to call me back.”
“No,” Steve says. “That’s bullshit.”
“If you insist,” Tony says. Arto feels a tension he didn’t know he was carrying dissipate at that, realising that he was automatically bracing himself for Tony to say no, that he was too busy. Maybe he
He stays there, stubbornly hiding his face until he hears someone else coming into the room. He’s hoping for Tony, but is still pretty relieved when he works out that it’s Steve and Bucky.
Arto’s mouth curls in a smile. “Lies,” he says, then looks around and grabs Bucky Bear. “Bye.”
Tony inhales and exhales heavily, his chest moving under Arto’s cheek and hand. “Yeah. I’m a workaholic and I’m not going to apologise for that, but I apologise for crossing the line.”
“Because I want to use my spider powers to help people and stuff you know? Fight crime. But your dads are Captain America and Iron Man and if they knew they’d stop me because they’ll say I’m too young.”
Damnit, his dad is a tactical genius. One who spots him coming a mile away and hangs up the call.
Steve stands up reflexively, forcing a smile onto his face. “Hey, Art, you okay?”
He pads over, dragging his blanket with him. Frowns and gently pulls at Steve’s ear.
Clint doesn’t look away. Maybe being married to Bucky has developed him resilience to the death glares. “Tony has crossed a line,” Clint says. “And you know it.”
” Arto interrupts with a whine. “I said sorry.”
He lurches awake with a gasp. Two strong hands are on his shoulders, helping him up into a sitting position. He’s all sweaty and gross and he can smell smoke.
Clint bursts into laughter, and Arto cackles delightedly. Bucky props himself up on an elbow, looking offended for a moment, and then just shrugs and flops back onto the couch. “Whatever,” he yawns. “I can be a fella and pull off a fairy outfit, right? Just make sure it’s something that shows off my legs.”
“Never,” Bucky says. “We’re on a mission here.”
Arto stomped in, skirt flaring dramatically as he did, almost as if the garment was channelling all of Arto’s indignant rage in flapping drapes of blue cotton. He stood next to Steve, folding his arms in a mirror pose of Steve and glaring for all he was worth.
“Turn it off,” Bucky insists, throwing a piece of popcorn at the TV. “Steve, stop torturing yourself, you freaking martyr.”
So a fucked up spider man then, not a lizard.
“Art, we know you’re scared-”
Arto swallows back a scream. “I never stopped you.”
completely okay I’d start to worry that you weren’t human.”
“School?”
“No.”
“You’re always working,” Arto snaps.
“Dad?”
“Look, they’re sparkly,” Arto says and Tony huffs out another not-quite laugh and folds his fingers around Arto’s.
“Well it’s true,” Arto says, and he shoves the pizza out of the way so he can muscle in under Steve’s arm. “I’m glad you’re my dad.”
to make,” Steve says, eyes on the road. His jaw is doing that clenched-jumpy thing which spells out trouble. “To anyone else it seems crazy but it probably makes perfect sense to Tony.”
“Hey!”
They stop again in a town somewhere in the middle of Ohio. Steve has apparently planned ahead because he pulls up at a garage that has two tesla charging points, one of them with a reserved sign hanging neatly in front of it. He gets out of the car with a terse “wait here,” to Arto, who refuses to even acknowledge that Steve has said anything.
Bucky snorts with tired laughter but nods. Arto stares at them for a moment, kind of caught off guard by the kissing and the name calling and stuff. They do know this is his room and not theirs, right?
“You are not the Illuminati,” Clint says, and holds Anna out. “Here.”
“Who were you talking to?” Arto asks.
“Stop, not in front of the b-a-b-y,” Clint hisses, covering Anna’s ears with his hands. Tony chokes on his coffee and Natasha fixes Clint with a look, half despairing and half amused.
A soft chiming distracts him. For one bewildered moment he wonders which app on his phone is making that noise, then he realises that it’s
, coming towards him with a shopping bag in one hand and his phone in the other. His focus is all on Arto though, eyes concerned and brow furrowed. “Arto? What’s up, pal?”
“School is good, right?”
“But he’s not moping or texting or lurking,” Tony repeats. “I can’t do anything about his terrible sense of self-preservation or skewed risk analysis.”
“We’re not stopping you?”
“It does matter,” Arto says forcefully.
“Tow,” she beams, banging her hands against the plastic tray of her high chair.
“No, not this time,” Tony says. “That’s for you to work out.”
“Okay,” Tony says, and takes off his sunglasses. “You are a great kid, Art. But we need to level honestly about this. How old is Kate?”
“He’s sixteen, he’s weird by definition,” Steve yawns, his hand settling on Tony’s side. “Just let him do what he’s going to do, keep an eye on him.”
Tony looks at Steve. “I could buy-”
“Is this live?” Steve asks suddenly. “Please tell me this is not live.”
“You want to keep it a secret?”
Steve holds his breath, very aware that, for most people, trying to leave a garage doesn’t feel like a life or death situation. Clint has one eye screwed shut like he’s bracing for impact and it’s oddly reassuring for Steve to see he’s not alone in his doubt. The car takes the ramp, slides out into the morning sun and thankfully, all Arto does is reach out towards Steve, holding his hand tightly.
“Thank you,” he murmurs. Arto climbs back into the bed to sit next to him, his heart swelling with pride and love. God he's so stupid lucky to have the family he has.
His head feels thick and woolly from crying and he thinks that if he sits up he’ll puke. The voice in his head is still there, rumbling in the background. It’s saying that it’s over. That he’ll be alone again. That Steve and Tony are never going to make up again.
“Bucky says I’ve got a lot going on.”
That’s Sam, sounding careful and concerned. And he’s not in the same mind-reading league as Bucky and Natasha but he’s still good at knowing when people are out of sorts.
“I wanted to tell you something,” Arto says.
“Slow down, we’ve got all day,” Steve says.
“Then stop acting like I’m the tyrant parent here,” Steve says, but he does kiss Tony back.
“Well I'm not going to tell,” Bucky says. “You think I'm crazy?”
“Stop yelling, Anna’s next door,” Bucky says without looking up at him.
“Steve, I’m hungry,” Arto whines, pulling at the drawstring on Steve’s sweats with way too much force; Steve opens his mouth to protest but there’s a tight tugging sensation around his waist and then the string is pulled lose, clutched in Arto’s fist.
“No, Art,” Steve says. “I am not talking about it.”
Arto nods again.
Sam gets out his phone and does a terrible job of acting casual as he phones Nat. Arto hears the words
“Okay, okay. What else did you find out?”
Steve reaches out and turns the music back up.
Bucky and Arto both say yes. Steve hands one to Bucky and gives Arto a can of cola. Eh, was worth a shot. Steve slumps back down onto the couch and for a moment everything is quiet and calm and okay, until there’s a loud knocking sound that cuts through the apartment. Steve leaps up off the sofa like he’s been electrocuted, diving for his shield; Bucky lunges for his backpack which has been sitting innocuously by the end of the couch all weekend; Arto feels his heart slam up into the bae of his throat, whipping his head around to try and find the source of the banging-
“Alright, here we go,” Tony says. Arto hears him take a deep breath. “So. I was messing around with nanites, right? They're microscopic robots. Smaller than red blood cells, like an eighth of the size. And we cooked up a way to use them in a way that’s equivalent to the super-serum. In theory, these nanites could be injected into a person and they'd be able to fix cells, keep them healthy. Could possibly cure all sorts of diseases and...other stuff. Keep cells healthy for longer.”
“You kick anyone and there will be consequences,” Steve says,
Anna shoves the last plastic penny into the piggy bank and throws her hands in the air like she’s scored a touchdown. Arto claps obligingly and flips open the side so she can get them all out again. From experience, he knows that this game can go on for quite some time.
The elevator spills them back out into the warmth of the apartment. Clint is at the stove heating something up and Anna is drawing on the wall and Steve is there letting her, oh
Walking with his new sneakers on his feet and his skirt brushing his knees, he feels vulnerable yet strangely brave. Powerful might be the right word, he’s not sure. He pulls his phone from his pocket and texts Peter, Omari and Nat.
“We are. I just...I can’t tell you this one. I wish I could but I can’t. You’re still my best friend, but I just can’t…”
. “If he’s not confused by his life as it is already, I think he can handle this one.”
“Can I take my shoes off?”
Arto thinks. God he’s so dumb. Going to Tony to try and make Steve happy when Tony was probably the reason that Steve was crying anyway? Fucking smooth.
“You okay, Smart Art?”
“Well, me and Clint are coming too, we don’t earn enough to pay rent in Manhattan,” Bucky grins. “And here Anna’s got a proper yard to play in you know?”
And Arto is really laughing now, even as the tears finally fall. He nods. “I remember.”
“Alright, I’m out of here,” Bucky says. “I’ll call you when airport security undoubtedly freak out and don’t believe my medical certificates.”
“Well, duh,” Arto says, letting go of him with one arm and twisting around so he can look at Bucky and Clint. He likes it here, being nestled under Steve’s arm. “You’re here and it’s in New York.”
“Leave him alone,” Natasha says. “He’s fine.”
“In how long?”
Steve orders them pizza. They lie on the couch with possibly every blanket that was in the penthouse, watching some Channing Tatum action flick on the flat screen TV that in no way matches the rest of the elegant and expensive decor. Steve gets his sketchpad about halfway through and starts drawing with a biro, elbow on the arm of the couch and head on his fist.
The workshop doors are locked when he gets down there. Unable to see where Tony is, he presses in his code but is met with a red light and an apology from Jarvis. Arto’s about at the end of his admittedly short tether so he resorts for banging on the glass with his fist, despite Jarvis’s alarmed protests.
seems completely inadequate, though it is kinda true. It would be the simplest way to get his point across obviously, but for as simple as it is it’s equally terrifying.
Arto watches for him a moment and then quickly leans over to kiss Steve on his forehead, before dropping back down and closing his eyes.
“Shhh,” Clint murmurs, both his arms now wrapped around Arto. “I got you. You’re okay. They’re just idiots who love each other so much they don’t know what to do with themselves.”
“Nope.”
Bucky looks alarmed, holding his hands up out of the way and grimacing as Arto winds an arm around his neck and clings on for dear life, still making muffled noises into Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky glances at Steve, still looking lost and like he’s got no idea what to do with Arto. In Bucky’s defense, Arto isn’t usually hands on with him, and is only ever close to him either because he’s with Clint and Bucky kinda comes as part of the package, or when he’s being restrained.
“Motorbike,” Arto says, twisting around and looking for the TV remote. “Can I watch Jurassic Park?”
” Steve says, sounding dangerous. “Tony, stop talking.”
Tony opens his mouth to say something but again he seems to give up. He just shakes his head and he’s turning away, already looking back to the fucking workshop like that’s more important than Steve or Arto.
“And you’ll get over it by destroying punching bags?”
“Steve’s sad,” Arto says without preamble. “I need you to come cheer him up.”
“Make that joke when Bucky is around, I dare you,” Clint points at Pietro. “And Kamala hasn’t met Arto properly, so you can stick it.”
He holds ferociously onto his anger as he goes to find Tony, carrying it like a flaming brand in his chest. Surprise surprise, Tony is in the motherfucking workshop. Bruce is there too and it looks like they're arguing as well, though in a  much more restrained way than Steve and Tony were. Arto thinks about punching the glass in, shattering the whole damn thing but before he can, Tony is up and at the door.
Arto feels his temper flash and flare. He manages to keep it in check. “Why else would I do it?”
“So you won’t be in danger?”
“You have a child too,” Steve points out, somewhat resentfully. “You will have to deal with this at some point.”
“Did he now?” Steve asks, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Natasha just gives him a
He may not be anything in that particular book, but he is something. He’s a boy who identifies as a boy but who likes things and maybe clothes from different parts of the typical gender spectrum. It’s so simple that it takes him a while to trust it, thinking that this whole thing has caused him and everyone around him so much drama that it really can’t be that simple.
“Good,” Steve murmurs, dropping his head back down onto his pillow. “D’you wanna talk about it?”
“Fuck you,” Arto tells the phone, his voice cracking, and then he storms out of the room and heads down to the communal floor.
“Not at all,” Steve says. “I trust her to be my friend even if she’s not there for me to ask.”
Arto pulls back and grins. Yes. Yes he does.
“No!” Arto protests, but Steve is already moving. Shield still in hand, he goes over to the balcony door and opens it. Tony shoots Arto a thumbs up then arcs round gracefully to land on the balcony with the oh-so familiar thud of metal on concrete.
They end up in a nail bar that's nothing like the one Natasha took him to. It's not as fancy and the staff barely glance twice at Arto, carrying on their own conversations in a language Arto doesn't recognise. They don’t even make a fuss about Steve, aside from a couple of people pointing him out to each other. Making a fuss over Captain America would probably get in the way of their frankly terrifyingly efficient work.
His jaw works and then he sighs, rubbing at his forehead. “Okay, point made,” he says. “Let me shut this all down and then I’ll come up with you.”
Steve passes him the phone. His lip is trembling and his eyes are all shiny and weird like he's gonna cry some more. Arto wants to reach out and grab his hand, but he doesn't. He's seventeen, he can deal with this without holding his dad's hand.
“Waste of money,” Bucky says. “Why?”
“Alright. I’m gonna sit this side of my desk and work,” he says, pulling up a holoscreen and swiping through a few menus. “You can sit that side and work.”
It’s Steve. He grabs hold of Steve’s arms, shaking. “I had,” he tries to say. “I had a nightmare.”
“Still a boy.”
Back in the car, Arto puts on more music that Steve probably hates and naps fitfully. He keeps thinking about the argument he overheard, the things Tony and Steve were yelling at each other. There’s a niggling doubt in the back of his mind that something else has happened, that the argument is not just about the amount of Tony’s spent in the workshop.
“Yeah, you want to learn? Here, give me your hand. Hi, I’m Nick Fury, nice to meet you.”
“Art? What’s wrong?”
“No,” Arto scowls, tired and grumpy. “No.”
Luckily, the universe has given him a Bucky Barnes to have his back. Bucky stomps in with bedhead and a scowl and looks between Steve and Tony before pointing between them. “Step away from the Keurig. Take any funny business away from breakfast.”
Change his damn mind. Please. He always knew that the best place for that kid was to be with Steve Rogers, and well. If there’s one way to make sure Steve Rogers does something, it’s to tell him he’s not allowed to do it.
“Where’s your other owner?” Nick asks, giving up on the chair issue. “I know he’s in the building.”
“Did anyone else write about Steve?”
“Yeah,” Peter says, sounding small. “Yeah. I am sorry. I really miss hanging out with you.”
“Hey.”
“Did it help?”
“You’re not exactly normal either,” Bucky points out. “Christ, let him in before the whole city works out where we are.”
Tony just stares at him. “Where’s Steve?”
“Are you staying?” Arto asks.
“I don’t expect you to be,” Steve replied, turning to open the door and raising his voice. “Arto, get in here!”
Steve, decidedly, does not. He ignores Natasha and leaves the room, heading up to talk to Arto. Natasha looks at Tony, wearily. “Can’t you at least try and stop him from interfering?”
“Are we going home now then?”
He's just screwing up the wrapper and wiping sauce off of his chin when Steve goes for it.
Whatever. He doesn’t even care.
Steve.
“He said I’m not allowed to
“Anytime,” Bucky replies, then ruins it by ruffling Arto’s hair with his metal fingers. “Later, loser,” he grins, and then he’s gone before Arto can even formulate any kind of retaliation.
“Arto went to call Peter,” he says, so that the rest of the kids hear it. He glares at Bucky who rolls his eyes and walks over to hand Anna to Clint.
get stronger. But Arto’s a super soldier and like hell is he letting his dumb, not-talking-to-him, spider-friend beat him.
Arto leaves and shuts the door behind him. He leans back against it and takes a deep breath.
Accepting the answer this time around, Arto hands over the coffee, which Steve takes gratefully. He goes to take a sip and then starts as he hears someone shout, “Cap!” It’s come from a pair of women, standing over by a family sized SUV. One of them waves and the other one smacks her arm, and they start squabbling amongst themselves.
“He can’t just ignore me and then call me like-” he hurls the phone across the room. It hits the wall right next to the window and falls down behind the curtain. He turns, wanting to tip over the fucking couch, wanting to kick the bedframe until it splinters, but finds himself face to face with Steve, who simply wraps him in his arms. Arto resists for a moment but he knows from years of bitter experience that Steve’s arms are like iron bands, and so he gives up. He just slumps against Steve, tucking his arms in tightly with his hands covering his face. Steve shushes him but he needs to scream, needs to somehow let out all the misery and pain from the past weeks, so he does. He screams into his hands, pressed tightly against Steve and he’s glad Steve has got hold of him otherwise he’s sure he would break into a million pieces right there.
Fuck.
And then he slams his foot on the brake as Clint appears out of fucking nowhere, standing nonchalantly in front of the car like he didn’t nearly just get run over.
“So, he’s got a crush,” he says, hoping he sounds calm and nonchalant rather than like he needs to go and check on Arto right-this-moment-now. “Who?”
“Bucky!”
It's Omari who breaks the silence. “Art, are you gonna wear your new sneakers? I wanna see them.”
“You’re young,” Steve says quietly. “You can work all this out in your own time. Hell, when I was seventeen I would go knocking down Bucky’s door if I’d not heard from him. Couldn’t separate us for more than a day.”
When he points out that he was young once too, the Teenage Stare just intensifies.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve says simply, then he sits up and leans over, picking up a plastic bag that Arto hadn't noticed was by his feet.
“But I’m always difficult and I used to fight you guys all the time and I used to bite people, and I still get angry and I swear and I’m too strong and now all this, I made a scene in the gallery-”
Natasha raises an eyebrow. “Why would you rename him? He’s not actually a girl, are you? Clint?”
“Yeah!” Peter enthuses, all his worry about hiding his spider-powers abruptly gone now the subject’s been changed. “Fashion show! Come on, show us!”
“Yeah, book,” he sighs, and drops a kiss to the top of her head.
Arto ignores that. Panic is rising in his throat, clawing up his spine. It’s joined by anger, too, a slow red haze that’s making it harder to breathe and talk and think. “What - what would have happened if you hadn’t got - hadn’t got the eighty-three percent?”
Natasha looks at him evenly, and then to Steve. “Your call,” she says. “Do I jump in here?”
Going away. With Steve.
“He is not he,” Bucky drawls, lying back on the couch and crossing his arms behind his head. “Not for another week or so anyways. Which means you’re probably going to be a lady for Halloween, right?”
Clint hums at that, screwing one eye shut as Arto’s fingers narrowly miss poking him right in said eye. “No, not really. I feel like me, I guess? Just different on the outside.”
“Alright troops. One hour and we’re going to retrieve furniture from the Tower and pick out colours for your rooms,” he says to Arto, bouncing Anna on his hip as she fusses, making grabby hands for something in his other hand. “And we’ll also get donuts for breakfast, as long as neither of you two tell on me. I don't want Aunt May to lecture me about diabetes again.”
“No,” Arto says. “I’m interested in beating the record for the Manhattan Island Marathon Swim, and being able to free dive for forty minutes. I’ve got goals, Nat, not wasting my time with stupid dating.”
“Well, shit,” Tony says, put-out, and Arto hides a grin in his hip.
“Alright,” Arto says. “Deal. Fresh start.”
“Wow, golly gosh, mister Captain America can tell time,” Bucky says, rolling his eyes as he climbs into the front of the cab, leaving Arto and Steve to get in the back. “Beer, second breakfast and retail therapy. We are not sitting around in the apartment all day.”
Steve ignores the joke. In fact, he is starting to look distinctly unimpressed, though Arto can't tell if that expression is being directed at Clint or at screen-Tony. "Maybe she’s wearing it to distract from the fact that Tony looks like shit.”
“No,” Bucky says slowly, like he’s explaining something to Anna. “You go and you and Tony will end up yelling at each other on a nationally televised event.”
“Well the making out can be our way of telling him that.”
There’s a long silence.
Steve reaches over to rest his hand over Arto’s fingers, gently squeezing. “Green,” he murmurs back.
“What?” Arto asks, pausing at Clint’s shoulder and looking confused. “He is a girl.”
Steve’s eyes are too bright. “Okay, I’ll stay,” he says, holding his free hand up. “I’ll just-”
“Dare I ask what it’s supposed to do?” Clint asks as he wanders over towards the refrigerator, his towel-cape swishing around his shoulders. “And didn’t you say you were buying team dinner?”
Arto just turns over, pressing his face in the couch cushions and refusing to look at any of them. His brain is a mess, like he’s Alice falling down a rabbit hole of pink confusion. God, liking his nails was one thing but wanting Anna’s headband is another, more ridiculous thing.
Actually, Arto was texting Peter. Peter had replied to the shoes picture with a series of exclamation points and now Arto is stuck trying to make up a text for Peter that doesn’t come across too angry or needy, and one that requires Peter to text back because he doesn’t want the back and forth to end.
Bucky just grunts in reply. Arto doesn’t know what to say, so he doesn’t say anything.
“Yep!” Clint shouts back and then he’s gone and Tony is left holding Anna up, looking at her with a resigned expression on his face as she kicks her feet and tries to jam her entire first into her mouth, grey eyes on Tony’s.
Clint looks at Arto, clearly baffled. “Jesus, Short-Round, Bucky bought it her because he thought she’d look cute, what’s the problem?"
Steve sighs, rubbing at his forehead. “Yeah I’d probably feel better with one too. Though the world isn’t black and white, not everything fits into a label or category.”
“Your dad is a billionaire, you can afford to get them done every other day if you want,” Bucky calls, walking around to take Anna so Steve can get out of his layers. She makes an indignant little sound, kicking her feet and squirming until Bucky rolls his eyes and puts her down. She runs at Steve again, hitting him in the shins and squealing.
Oh no.
“Yes,” Arto says immediately. “Steve? Please?”
“Mmm?”
He misses him.
“Come on, let me show you the balcony,” he says. “Art, you okay with Anna for five?”
“Get me Bucky Bear,” Arto says, stretching out a foot and pushing against Steve’s knee.
“Insulting you?” Steve asks.
then deletes it.
“Yeah, good,” he says, and hands her back to Clint before going down to the garage.
“More bacon needed,” Bucky says. “Steve is banned from moping around in bed.”
“Alright,” he says. “We can enter.”
“I don’t know, I’ve not read the books yet.”
Steve is momentarily at a loss. He can’t let Arto carry on if he’s going to hurt Clint, and he definitely can’t let Arto carry on if he’s getting tearful and irritable. However, he suspects that if he tells Arto that he has to stop playing, everything could go very wrong, very quickly.
Arto goes very still. He tries to swallow past the sudden lump in his throat. “Yeah. I wasn’t ready to talk to him,” he says weirdly defensive. “He ignored me for weeks and then Tony gave me the trip for Christmas…”
“I’m sure you’ll be fine,” Steve says, and leans down to kiss him.
It’s super late by the time he comes out. Steve is back: he knocked on the wall and then left when Arto didn’t respond. Clint appeared to slide a boxed pizza into the bolthole a few hours later. Arto was determined to not eat it but caved after only about three minutes of resolutely ignoring the smell of pepperoni and ham.
Arto shakes his head again. “What are we going to do today? Can we go out? Can we explore?”
Until he grinds to a halt in front of a painting of Saint George killing the Dragon, and it’s not even the dragon that he’s staring it. It’s the goddamn princess in the background, the one with the flowing pink cape that matches the colour of his nails, trimmed in some sort of fur. She’s wearing glittery jewels and a crown and he wants the jewellery and the cape and the dress, something long and flowing.
“Da!” squeals Anna. Arto just stands there, dumbstruck. Bucky carefully lifts Anna out of Arto’s arms, allowing him to walk forwards onto the patio, standing at the edge of the pool.
“I'm not allowed.”
“I was right,” Arto says, but it doesn't feel as great as it normally does. “I knew you’d done something, when we were driving up here I said I knew. ”
Tony narrows his eyes at him. “Now I’m suspicious,” he says. “What happened to the Fury who didn’t want…?” he trails off, but tips his chin towards Arto, no doubt alluding to the time when Nick had told them to hand Arto over.
“Why’re you sad?”
Arto shakes his head. “No,” he says quickly. “It’s okay.” He doesn’t tell Steve but he thinks maybe it’d be better if he just let all the polish come off. No more pink, no more glitter.
“Thought you wouldn’t come back,” he mumbles, and feels Steve’s arms go tight around him.
Arto thinks that they might still have some sorting out to do, but for now he’ll take it.
The gate opens itself, so slowly that it almost seems to be mocking them. Steve guides the car through the moment there’s enough space. Arto’s still craning his head around, trying to get a glimpse of this supposed mansion that Tony’s decided to move them all out to-
“You knock me down you face Bucky,” Clint says with a shrug. “Not a risk I’d want to take, Short Round.”
“Ugh,” Arto says. “Can you not.”
Bucky laughs so hard he nearly cries. Steve just sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers. “Don’t tell Sam he said that-”
Okay so they’re bickering now, which means no hope of serious conversation. Arto mentally sighs and waits for an opening to change the conversation again. It’s alright, he guesses he can wait.
“Green,” he mumbles.
“Oh shit, the January Gala,” Arto says. “Shit. Shit. Okay, I gotta go, I’ll call you later.”
So at just over 4k this is the shortest chapter I've written in years, but the story kinda naturally broke itself up here and also this was exhausting to write. Quite enough feels for one chapter I think.
Arto has to hug him again for that. Steve kisses the side of his head. “Want to wear them round the apartment?” he murmurs.
Somehow, he does. Well, enough to head back up to the kitchen and paste a smile onto his face, bracing himself as Arto runs at him and leaps. He catches him just before he gets kneed in the balls, hefting him up onto his hip.
“I’m not qualified for babies!” Tony protests, but Clint is pressing her forwards and while Tony doesn’t think he’d deliberately drop Anna, the risk of accidental droppage is probably pretty high. With that in mind he takes her, though does hold her out away from his body a little.
“But-”
“I’m up,” Clint says. “Arto?”
“In the car,” Steve replies.
And before Steve can stop him, Clint’s scrambling to his feet, pulling his battered old I-phone out of his pocket and holding it up to his ear without even bothering to dial, wandering back into the lounge. Steve gets up automatically, distractedly wondering what happened to the days where he'd happily hide in the stairwell and let the others sort out Arto-related issues.
“He’s going to break his neck.”
Arto smiles, plucks another from the bowl. “No,” he says, and pops it in his mouth.
Steve looks, makes a sympathetic sound. “Sorry, bud.”
(the news being that general mills were running a social media competition to win one of ten boxes of marshmallow only lucky charms.)
He puts the shoes on and stands there staring at his feet for a good few minutes, feeling like there’s a balloon in his chest that’s full of joy and rainbows and skittles and shit. He takes around fifty photos and painstakingly goes through them all to find the best one. When he finds it, he sends the snap to Nat and Omari and then after a while, he sends it to Peter as well.
“I only asked a question.”
“I got you,” Tony murmurs.
“Are they mad?”
"Lies," Arto says and then presses a kiss to Steve's cheek. "You can go now."
His pathetic excuse for a social life taken care of, he leaves his phone on the floor and goes to find Steve. It’s gone ten AM so he expects Steve to have been up for hours already, so it’s a shock to find Steve still in bed and fast asleep.
Natasha looks over the top of the magazine at him. “You are definitely a weirdo, but this does not make you a weirdo,” she says. “You hear me?”
Bucky and Clint make identical disbelieving noises. Anna looks between them and blows a raspberry, looking very pleased with herself.
“Okay. Beer, second breakfast, retail therapy, then actual therapy,” Steve says, leaning over to tap Arto’s knee. “I want you to call Julia.”
“Does Steve tell you what to do?”
“I don’t even have anything yet,” Arto says. “Well, just my nails.”
Steve saw red. How could Tony do this to him, how could Tony just throw him away like that? No, he wouldn’t take that, couldn’t take that. He would show him, prove to him, just how dirty Steve could be.
Tony snorted, “Yeah, I’m a real saint. It’s not like my motivations are pure here. I’m just as fucked up as you, just a different kind.”
Steve sits there in a torn gown with an ache in his ass as the evidence of his humiliation dries on his stomach. If this is what it is like to be omega, to feel like this, then how cruel is the world.
“Ya know, we never got storms like this in Malibu. This is purely East Coast precipitation. What do you think, Steve?” Tony broke the silence first.
“More than fine with me.”
Father Rogers is the young priest of the small Manhattan congregation that Maria had been dragging Tony to the last 5 years. The larger church a few blocks down served most of the community, but Our Lady of Divine Faith was one of the few churches in the area that still did Mass in Latin once a week and was almost completely funded by the Starks.
All fires must die at some point.
When you live with someone it is normal to spend time together, so they can’t pinpoint when romantic feelings began to fester. It went from group dinners to grabbing lunch together discussing SHIELD business to dinners because Toni got in late to planning nights out together.
They groaned together as Tony’s cock consumed him, the only thing keeping him from pushing back was Tony’s hands on his hip and shoulder, grounding him to the spot. Tony gave a few experimental thrusts before finding his rhythm, long strokes that punched little whimpers from Steve’s throat each time his prostate was grazed.
“Before we get started with the insertion, I’d like to go over some things.” Dr. Stark pulls up the forms Steve filled out on his tablet, “Let’s start with your medical history. You’ve had asthma, high blood pressure, heart palpitations, anxiety. Family history of cancer, diabetes, and heart attacks. My first question is how did you make it into the army?”
“She always wanted a big family, so she’d dream up that I’d have 10 kids for her to dote on. Gave them all names and personalities, anything to keep talking. She dreamed of the woman I’d marry and boy would she have loved you. You all would have gotten on like a house fire.”
After service, Tony set about doing the small duties he had been given; put out the candles, clean up from the offering, returning the books to their places. Maria’s warm laugh caught Tony’s attention and he saw her chatting with Steve. Never one to be left out, Tony blew out the last few candles quickly, instead of individually smothering the flames.
Steve hips pistoned erratically, his careful rhythm faltering the closer he got to coming, “You want my come, baby? You want me to pump you full of my seed, make you nice and round?”
When he returned, Tony sat him down and explained how normal it was to want that. That night Steve got his first punishment from ‘Daddy’ for running away instead of talking.
This would be the weekend.
Dr. Stark starts by raising Steve’s arm then delicate fingers start prodding under his armpit. The urge to twist away from the sensations is hard to fight and he flinches. “Just checking your glands to make sure that they are all good. Not swollen or hard. Now I’m moving on to your breast tissue.”
Steve’s head thumped against the glass, he couldn’t bear to look at the anguish Tony went through each time for time, “I-I know you are taking a risk, Tony. You didn’t, don’t, have to do this for me, but you do.”
Tony groaned at the gentle suction, the tight ring of lips. God, Steve was good, almost too good. If he wasn’t careful this would be over embarrassingly fast, great way to show a guy how mature you are when you cream after a few quick tugs. This couldn’t have been his first blowjob, no way a beginner was this good out of the gate. Even if before dedicating his life to the church, Steve had received some head from a former fling, he wouldn’t have this kind of skill. Steve had sucked cock before and that thought tore a moan from Tony’s throat.
God must have been smiling down on him, because Steve flashed Tony a quick wink at the end of service which he returned with a coy smirk. That was new, he had never winked before, Tony didn’t know those jeweled eyes knew how to do anything other than bow in prayer. Thank the lord the vestments covered the swelling in his pants.
Steve chuckled at that, “While you’re still rebooting, I’m going to grab some water.”
“Okay, Steve. I’m going to check your prostate then we’ll put the speculum in. After that one big pinch and you’ll be good to go.” It takes a herculean effort to not moan as Tony’s finger sinks into his canal. Steve can feel his body heat through the thin latex glove and it makes Steve want to come instantly. How can Tony’s fingers accomplish feats that toys can’t?
“Flip over baby, I’m not through.” Despite just coming, Steve didn’t go soft. It would be at least another load before he was truly satisfied.
“I would have loved her too. Except I don’t think 10 kids is going to happen.”
The soft press of lips was loving and passionate in ways foreign among all heartbreak. She didn't want to close her eyes or miss a moment, it was the kind of kiss that takes your breath away, not because it was forced out of you, but because who needs air when you have Steve Rogers kissing you?
After the Battle of New York, the hurt feels still lingered, looming over all their interactions. It took a few weeks of living in the tower together before Steve was the bigger person and apologized. He was sorry for undervaluing Toni as a member of the team, Iron Woman was just as important as Toni Stark. He didn’t just apologize though, he meant it and went on to show it everyday after which was new. Then he forgave her when she owned up to the mistakes she made in believing that Steve Rogers was nothing without the serum. They both thought the other was hiding behind abilities.
Where the fuck are these thoughts coming from?
He helped her maneuver another pillow under her hips, to keep everything inside and increase the chance of inseminations, another helpful tip from some article Dr. Cho had recommended. Then he disappeared down the stairs soon to return with water and snacks.
Toni turned away from the open schematics to look at him, mask of indifference firmly placed. “Did that not classify as dating back in the 40s?”
They don’t see each other again until they join forces to track down Loki’s scepter, stolen by Hydra. After breaking most of D.C, Steve takes Tony up on the offer to move into the tower while they hunt down the lost items. Somewhere in that time, they grow close, the first flames of love blooming between them as the months drag on. Their first big fight in this new territory was Ultron, but that only brought them closer together, clinging to the ‘what if’ of losing one another. This love grew like a wildfire.
“O-okay, that hurts a bit.”
Steve is a native New Yorker, growing up attending Mass in Brooklyn with his mother, but had decided to dedicate himself to the church after the horrors he witnessed in war. Steve would often say that the true beauty of God came from the uglies times. Once he took over, coming to Mass wasn’t such a burden.
Tony pushes at the muscles above and around his cock, gently inspecting the organs with deep pushes against his stomach. Steve gasps when those damn fingers find their way to his burning length unexpectedly. “Everything’s alright, Steve. Just checking for the usual, no lumps, bumps, or sores. Noticed anything strange recently?”
You’d think Steve had been punched from the noise that comes next, “Tony, I-I-”
The wistful look on Steve’s face was probably Toni's favorite, the soft smile and far off eyes. It was so rare that he could let the world slip off his shoulders, even just for a few minutes. What she wouldn’t give to keep Steve this happy forever.
What has gotten into him? Plenty of doctors have touched his dick over the years, even some alphas. Maybe his hormones were out of control without the implant? What else could explain his physical and mental reactions to Tony’s touch. He needs to get his head on straight before he embarrasses himself and the alpha further.
“Well, that’s good, but let’s not try for that today.” The warmth of Tony’s smile settles the fire in his veins. That smile could make the sun shine on a cloudy day and that smile, at least for right now, is only for him. “Let me know if you have any discomfort.”
The only spark of light were the days when Tony would stop by. While he is officially retired, Tony was still the benefactor of the Avengers and there were still duties to be fulfilled. Natasha would call him in if they had a decent idea that needed Tony’s input or business of the new Universe Security Counsel. Steve looked forward to these days like a child might wish for Christmas or summer break, he couldn’t wait to tear a married man away from his family even if just for a few hours so that he could bask in the warmth that Tony brought.
“Results of treatment: FAILURE.
The last form has the office’s logo at the top rather than the generic hospital form, these are new questions related to his visit. “When was your last heat?” Steve’s cheeks turn bright red like they did the first time that Dr. Erskine asked him at 16. He quickly writes down perfunctory answers then returns the clipboard.
Tony started making excuses to not come home on weekends just to avoid Sundays, blaming big tests or important projects for his absence. That was until Father MacKenzie retired and was replaced by the recently indoctored Steve Rogers.
The next thing he felt was the burn of two slick fingers breaching his hole. The intrusion pushed the air out of his lung and he gasped, why breath when a part of Tony was inside of him. The fingers were quickly joined by a third. Prep had become clinical since this thing between them had started, was it because Tony had gotten accustomed to a partner that automatically wet and ready? Just another difference between how it used to be and how it was now.
The hand continued down, tickling a trail down to her stomach, stroking over the flat plains, “How about here? How long til this starts to grow?”
After waiting 20 minutes, knocking at the door startled him and in walks a wet dream in a lab coat. The brunette man is beautiful in the classical sense, he obviously doesn’t have to work at being attractive the way Steve does. He must roll out of bed ruggedly handsome. Those eyes have a warmth to them that radiate security, a dazzling smile framed by neatly trimmed facial hair.
“Oh fuck, Steve. I’m close. Shit.”
Eventually Toni grew restless though, one could only dream about something so long before it was time to take action. They hadn’t come all the way out here to eat and sketch, they were here to make dreams reality.
Today was a good day
Steve chokes as Dr. Stark’s fingers firmly press around his nipple, it feels like there is a line of nerves that run from his nipple to his cock. The more pressure applied to his sensitive nub, the harder his cock gets until he is sporting a semi beneath the paper sheet. He prays that he doesn’t go fully hard during the rest of the exam.
Wait, did Tony
Steve knew he shouldn’t be up here. This was a bad idea.
“Since you wanted to be a brat earlier and not answer, you don’t get to come until I say so. If I let you. So you’ll have to earn your orgasm. Do you understand, Steve?” He felt the blunt tip of Tony’s cock at his entrance, teasing over the sensitive skin, but he wouldn’t get it until he proved that he was worth it.
Steve nods at this, “I went into the Army at 18. I had 3 implants while serving” Dr. Stark takes notes while Steve talks, which makes him more nervous about what he is saying, “I had the last one removed over a year ago. My regular doctor recommended that I stay off of it for a while since I hadn’t had a heat in 9 years.”
“Steve, let’s go make a baby.” Tony prodded, gently.
Steve thrusted his soft cock into the crack of Tony’s bubble butt, seeking friction to find pleasure of his own. He wouldn’t get off on hurting Tony like this, but this wasn’t about his pleasure, it was about proving that he could do this, he could be what Tony wanted even if Tony didn’t want him. He started by placing his own bites over the existing ones, claiming them as his own.
“They’ve been fine, pretty regular,” a blush crawls across Steve’s cheeks, “I-I normally have them alone.”
“That was amazing. Thank you, Tony.” Steve said, twisting until his back was against the glass and he was facing Tony. Something he said must have hit a nerve, because Tony’s mouth was pinched with irritation.
“Father Rogers, we are going to miss you so much. I can’t repay all that you’ve done for our family, for Tony, over the years.” Maria was praising Steve again, her hand resting on his arm. If Tony didn’t know any better he would say that mother and son had the same taste in men.
A bubbly redhead smiles at him from the check-in counter, “Hi sir! What can I do for you?”
Steve holds his breath as he pushes the door open.
“Yes, sir. I wasn’t paying attention, you caught me off guard.”
One last deep breath, “Except this person is a man. I’ve seen the way he stares, scared to want me but too hypnotized to look away. The way his eyes linger on my ass in painted on pants. Steve, I know how hard you get when I talk about the pleasure I get from sex. Steve, I see you.”
Tony started to fight against the restraints against his neck and hip, thrashing from side to side to shake off the hold. Steve was stronger than that though, a little twisting and whining wouldn’t stop him from showing Tony what kind of man he is.
Tony itched to run his fingers through Steve’s hair, comb the golden locks out of his face and watch as those pink lips encased his length. It took every ounce of self control he had to not thrust into the warmth, he wanted Steve to go at his own pace, make sure they both enjoyed this. What could be their first and only time together.
He bottomed out and gave them both a few moments to get used to the intrusion. Steve, for his part, hadn’t came since they called it quits. A week without an orgasm after having them daily had led to a serious case of blue balls. After a few test strides, he set a steady pace of deep, long thrusts.
“Steve, baby. I’m close, don’t stop. Please don’t stop.”
And they lived like that for months until Steve barged into the workshop, forgoing his usual poliet request to enter.
“Please don’t thank me for cheating on my wife,” Tony huffed out. He hadn’t taken off his clothes through their fucking, so with a quick tuck of his cock he looked as if nothing had happened. Maybe that’s how he lived with the guilt, pretending it didn’t happen.
Steve shakes his head.
Steve, the superhuman, carried the luggage to the master suite on the top level while Toni checked out the rest of the cabin. The kitchen was fully stocked with their usual grocery order, thank you Jarvis. Fishing rods and canoes were stored underneath the deck for outdoor activities. Everything they could need for a peaceful weekend away from the city.
Steve covered her limp form with his own hulking mass, kissing at any expanse of skin he could find until he made his way to her lips. They kissed for a while, getting lost in the pull of lips and tongues, but eventually Steve erection made itself known, demanding a warm place to land.
What about this appointment has him so nervous?
“Of course.”
“How long do you think it’s going to take for these to start growing, filling with milk?” Toni questioned innocently. Her hand caressed a supple breast, finger running over the soft skin, teasing sensitive nipples. Steel eyes tracked the movement, the tent in his pants growing more pronounced.
Tony pulls at the stethoscope around his neck. “I’m going to listen to your stomach real fast and then we’ll move on.” Fuck. Will Tony notice his dick tenting the sheet? Either way he will be in the region soon and see the humiliation that he can’t hide. Steve lifts his head to see how noticeable the bulge is, but is distracted by Tony leaning over his stomach mere inches from the throbbing pole. His imagination runs wild at the site before him, images of the gorgeous god before him leaning down to swallow the hardening length swim in Steve’s vision.
At the end of a curved, tree covered driveway stood a log cabin surrounded by a large lake. The house had a long wrap around porch with old timey rocking chairs. If they ever left the bed, Toni was sure she would find Steve on the porch sketching everything in sight.
“Oh,” was all that came to mind. Shocked overtook his brain and turned everything into white noise.
As excited as Toni was for motherhood and raising a child, she was most looking forward to Steve being a dad. If it wasn’t for him, she probably would never have children. The fears of the past and her lacking relationship with her own mother didn’t lean towards great maternal instincts. But the way he looked at babies in the store and families at the park melted the ice around her heart.
As quickly as the stroking starts, it ends with a pinpoint touch to his slit by a foreign object. “Just a quick sample. Now I’m going to check your testicles for any signs of irregularities in size or shape.”
Tony pulled out and Steve’s legs gave out. He crashed to the floor as the last of his strength left him and pressed his forehead to the cool glass. He heard Tony stumble back and sit on the edge of the bed. They were silent as they both came down from the high.
“Small tickle from the swap. We’ll send these off to the lab. Should have the results back in about a week and will give you a call if anything comes back as irregular.” The swabs barely register once he realizes what comes next. The insertion.
Steve pulled back his arm and let it go with a resound splat. Now Tony had a handprint on the left cheek to match the right. Steve had left his mark, staked his claim over Tony Stark. Who wasn’t tough enough now?
“She’ll get it,” Clint yawns, offering her another piece of toast. “Bucky’s now dada, which is two syllables.”
“You feel better after bolt-holing all day?”
He’s woken by a loud banging on his bedroom door. He jerks his head up and has a horrible bleary moment of disorientation, his brain flailing and panicking and trying to work out where he is. Not the tower, not the apartment, not a hotel. The mansion. Right.
“Pink glitter polish doesn't make someone gay! You're like the opposite of pink glitter and you're gay as shit.”
Steve nods. “That's true. You're not a finished article. I mean, look at Clint. How old was he when he got together with Bucky? He'd been straight up until that point.”
“Cool,” Omari says happily. “But what if anyone at school says anything?”
Steve fishes his phone out of his pocket and hits speed dial. Arto holds his breath but it rings and rings and then goes to voicemail, Tony’s voice telling them to not bother leaving a message because he won’t check them. Steve makes an irritated noise in the back of his throat and shoves his phone back into his sweats. “Whatever,” he says, and pulls Arto back around into a bone-crushing hug.
“But it’s fun watching you get all red,” she teases. “But seriously, the whole team are back in on Wednesday.”
Arto ignores that. He reaches out to take the pen, adding to Steve’s picture. He draws an angry-faced ghost coming at the shield, then a quick sketch of himself shouting ‘
Arto does. He gets his coat, hat and gloves and then ignores what Bucky says and goes to say goodbye to Steve anyway. He’s sitting on the couch in his room, staring out the window at the snow. Arto tells Steve where he’s going and hugs him tight. He tells him that he knows Steve and Tony won’t ever split up and Steve’s eyes fill with tears. He doesn’t actually cry though. Just nods and then gently shoos Arto out, telling him to text him if he needs him.
“Gross,” a voice protests, and Steve feels small hands shoving at his collarbone. “Steve, I’m hungry.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, now not looking at him. “Rogers roadtrip, I get it.”
He lets the conversation wash over him, sitting down on the floor and poking around the toys that are already strewn over the carpet. Anna crawls over in short order, obviously having decided that being held is for suckers. He waves her toy piggy bank at her and she nods vigorously, pulling open the compartment to get the big fake coins out. He reaches over to help and she makes a sound of objection, pushing his hands away and clearly determined to do it herself.
“You know we bought him a real version of that,” Bucky comments. “With a board and pieces and everything.”
Bucky stares after her, held in place by Clint leaning on his knees. “Why is she taking my baby to deal with a stroppy teenager?” he demands. “I object.”
“Who else knows? Where’s Bucky? Where’s Clint?”
and then curls up in a pathetic ball on the floor, crying.
Arto nods slowly, staring somewhat vacantly at the screen. Movement on the other side of the room makes him look up; Steve steps back in, looking tired. Arto and Tony both simultaneously hold out a hand, reaching for him. His mouths quirks in a weary smile but he walks over, taking their hands in his.
“What’s that boat on the river doing?”
Arto frowns, sits back with a huff. “Steve doesn’t have a therapist. Does Sam count?”
“Alright, next one Art,” he says softly, and Arto is already there, leaning up to gently rub at Clint’s temples and across his forehead. Steve joins in, and Natasha’s mouth curves into a soft smile as he works.
“What are those numbers?”
“Can I have bacon?” Arto asks.
“You know I love you even if you are weird,” Tony says, and bites back a laugh at the way Arto just groans in response.
“No you
Steve’s brow creases. “I think I know this one, but I want to check. You’re not questioning your sexuality?”
Startled, he lets him go. “Sorry,” he says, having a moment of wild panic that he’s hurt him by holding too hard, but Arto just tips his head back and beams at him, reaching up to touch Steve’s face.
Arto stares at him. “Okay.”
Stupid mainstream school. He should never have asked Tony if he could go.
That stops Steve’s rambling. He cuts off mid flow, but then forces that smile back onto his face. “I’m not, I’m good,” he says. “How about you?”
When he finds out, he goes perfectly still for around three seconds and then throws himself on the floor and starts to scream.
Arto grins at that but it fades quickly.
Arto sighs. “You’re not telling me to go to bed and go to sleep?”
“I am coming with you and there is nothing you can say to stop me,” Arto says. His heart is going too quick. It feels strange, like he’s been swimming non-stop for miles and miles.
“Well you’ve got it all figured out,” Nat says with a strange little smile. “You registered for the swim yet?”
Steve starts to wander, looking towards the next painting. It’s not as interesting as Saint George but Arto follows anyway. “Bucky’s not girly in any way at all.”
“People notice what’s different,” Natasha shrugs. “Oh look, Taylor Swift has a new boyfriend.”
he begs.
“They’re from the women's section,” Arto says. He flips one over to show Steve the pink soles, before turning them back around so he can show him the glittery silver, white and baby pink of the sides. “They’re women’s shoes.”
“I’ll go,” Bucky says, even though he’s sprawled out on his back on the couch with his head in Clint’s lap, Anna sitting on his chest, his hands holding her steady. “Shall we go, baby?”
Arto turns his face so he can peer up at Steve. “Can I call him?”
“The stingray it is then,” she smiles, and Arto is suddenly very grateful for her, even if she is a mind-reader. “You want to say goodbye to Tony before we go?”
Arto turns to gape at him, mouth literally hanging open. He turns the music down again on his phone and then grabs for Steve’s wrist as Steve goes to turn it back up again.
he thinks, grinning back and climbing out of the car, heading over to collect his son.
Tony thinks it over. “I’ll take it,” he says, and pulls Steve in for a kiss.
Steve clears his throat as Arto looks to him for confirmation. “Yep. Outside and inside.”
Clint blinks. “That was a lot of words. Are you okay?”
Steve takes the pizza box. “When it comes to you I do,” he says. “Get me a beer, I’ll sort these.”
“Yeah,” Tony says. “She doesn't have another option.”
Arto nods dizzily and complies. He slides back and sits on his ass on the carpet, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Steve stays within touching distance, still sitting back on his heels.
“I didn't know anything,” Arto says, crossing his arms tight across his chest. “No-one was telling me anything.”
“And I was so convinced it would work...I was so desperate for it to work that I decided to just go ahead and test it on myself,” Tony says. “And Steve was so angry because at that point we were only eighty-three percent sure it would work as intended.”
“It’s not about - shut up,” Arto says thickly.
Arto holds up what looks like a one-of-a-kind Starkphone. “Went to annoy the tech department,” he says. “The phone stays here so it doesn’t get upset by your inferior tech.”
“If I was a gladiator,” Steve says. “I’d still have a shield.”
“Help,” he says. “Steve, help.”
Steve replies by rolling Tony over onto his back, pinning him down and fixing him with a pointed look.
“Extenuating circumstances,” Steve says. “Damn, I should have seen that coming.”
And then Tony turns back to the reporter and holds up a finger, says, “Okay just one more thing.”
Arto reaches out automatically and claps a hand over Omari’s mouth. He’s shaking head to toe, quite clearly completely stunned. Honestly, Arto’s not much better but he’s grown up with the Avengers so weird is kinda the default setting.
percent sure it would work?”
“What?” Arto asks, reaching for the phone. He’s not expecting Steve to hand it over so he’s a bit taken aback when he finds himself with the phone in hand. He glances down and feels the bottom drop out of his stomach when he finds himself and Steve plastered over US weekly.
“How’s school?” Wanda asks Arto, and Tony watches as Arto tries to regain some composure.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures him. “Luckily for you, I was here to step up in magnificent style.”
“My nail,” Arto says, staring at it and then holding it out to Steve. “Look, it’s like torn, its peeled off.”
It’s the exact same shade of pink. Exactly. Like, he could camouflage his nails into the headband and never find them again. Exactly the same. He stares at it, and he can’t help but think that he wants one too. The same feeling from the nail bar hooks into his gut, pulling tight and making him feel all shivery and weird.
“I...I just had some shit going on. I’m so, so sorry.”
“Cute as shit, I think he said,” Sam says with a nod. “He was right.”
“What?!” Omari asks, sounding outraged. “No.”
“I’m bored though,” Arto says. “I don’t know what to do. I didn’t bring my X-Box.”
Tony just shakes his head again. He looks super tired. Arto reaches out to run his finger over the dark shadows under Tony’s eyes, then scritches his newly pinked nails through Tony’s goatee, tugging at the grey.
Nothing. Just the same blue ticks indicating a read message.
staring match over the kitchen counter as Arto sprawls on the couch, eating his way through a plate full of cream cheese bagels. Tony thinks Steve is just about to give in but then a spanner is thrown in the metaphorical works as Jarvis simply says, “Sir, the Young Avengers are on the way up.”
“Sorry,” Arto says, feeling his cheeks going warm. She ducks her head, smiles and hurries after her family. Arto watches her go until Steve elbows him, hard.
Arto just stares. “One of my best friends is a silver sandslash and the other is a spider.”
“You’re gonna go without Anna?”
Arto thinks of Tony, back home. Thinks of the time he and Steve spent together, how they are together. Yeah they’re sickeningly in love and gross some days but mostly they’re just...they laugh. Smile. Talk about things. Bicker about things. Want to hang out together, even when they’re not doing a lot.
A few seconds pass, and then from somewhere above them there’s a thud and a scream. Tony waits it out, and sure enough there’s more screaming and banging and then Arto and Peter appear, sliding down the staircase while both sitting on a wheel-less skateboard, clutching hold of each other.
, he never was. Not now Nick and Phil have dealt with it.
Bucky gropes across the lump that Arto presumes is Clint, picks up a phone off the shelf by the bed. “It’s like, two am, Short Round,” he says. “We’re sleeping.”
“Your dad is on TV!”
“Go,” Tony says, gently pressing a kiss to the top of Arto’s head. Arto nods dumbly then does as he’s told, leaving the workshop and heading for the stairs. He deliberately doesn’t look at the big crack in the door as he goes, nor does he look back to where Tony is back behind the screens.
“If you loved me you’d let me.”
“God, don’t,” Steve groans..
He’s almost shouting again. Steve just holds out a hand, patiently waiting for him to settle back down. Actually, fuck Steve being all calm and rational, he clearly isn’t understanding just how stressful this whole fucking thing is. Arto glares at him, dragging his blanket up over his head like a hood before going back to chewing on his fingers.
Then he remembers what it was like before he was a parent and was allowed to sleep for a solid twelve hours. “If you let me go back to sleep,” he mumbles, eyes already closed. “And you get ready without a fuss when it’s time, then yes. We will get there however you want.”
“Feels good,” Arto says between hits.
“What,” Arto says, pulling his headphones off.
He blows out a shaky breath, feeling that the message was exactly what he needed to hear.
That fucking room again. It seems like every time he shuts his eyes he’s back there with white tiles and trembling floors. He would have thought he’d be having dumb nightmares about Tony and injections and nanites and things going terribly wrong, not about that stupid lab.
Bucky snorts with laughter. “Yeah, I guess,” he says, walking over and leaning into the ring to grab a bottle of water. He cracks the plastic cap off, frowning as he looks Arto over. “Well you look like shit.”
“I know, shush,” Steve says. He sits down on Arto’s bed and then hauls Arto into his lap, holding him sideways. It seems to be happening a lot at the moment. “You’re okay. Just a bad dream.”
What's the worst that could have happened?”
The moment Arto claps eyes on him, he starts to cry again. Steve just crumples, his shoulders slumping and his face falling, and then he’s there. He’s on his knees on the floor, holding his hands out but hesitating, like he’s scared Arto is going to push him away.
"Incoming," Steve says, dipping the corner of a towel into the warm water then dragging it over Arto's pink blotchy face. "Sit still."
“Yeah and you know I’d take you-”
“Are all your lady Barton parts in working order? Because I think one baby super soldier is enough for this tower.”
He’s right, but Arto’ll be damned if he admits it out loud. He tugs his bag out of Steve’s grip and shoulders it, scowling. Steve seems to accept that as a response because he just starts walking, Arto following in his wake.
“Time to go,” Steve says, pressing the lid of his disposable cup back over his drink and ducking back into the car. Arto hastily scrambles into his side, pinning Steve with a narrow-eyed glare as Steve starts the car.
Steve looks at Tony. “We weren’t ever this bad with Arto, right? Tell me I wasn’t that bad.”
But. Going home meets facing Tony and that’s not something he’s sure he can do.
They get beer - milkshake for Arto - and second breakfast and then hit the shops. With Steve and Bucky flanking him Arto’s less panicked about browsing all the different sections of the stores they go in. Even with Steve’s credit card and permission to go nuts, his heart isn’t completely in it; he’s too distracted by thinking about home and Tony and how he pretty much wants to go back never, despite what Steve says.
Shopping.
The moment they’re in, Arto whips the map out of Steve’s hand. “Top floor,” he says. “Modern art first.”
shoots out across the room, attaching itself to Arto’s phone. Peter yanks his hand back and the phone sails across into his hand.
Tony's mouth opens and closes a few times. He's actually speechless, which Steve would find funny if he wasn't also indignantly sputtering. "No," Tony repeats. "What's no in Russian? No."
“Lies,” Clint calls back dramatically. “No beast shall knock me off the island of couch.”
"Am," Arto protests, then, "Green."
“Fuck you,” Arto says, voice trembling. “You hate my nails and you hurt Steve and you’re not even sorry.”
“Tow, tow, tow,” she says happily, tiny hands smacking at his collarbones. She leans in for a cuddle, resting her head on his shoulder. The lump in his throat comes back. Maybe he should just invite Anna on the trip Tony’d got him for Christmas. That’d serve Peter right.
“Dunno,” Clint shrugs. “Never came up. Come on, you know Nat. She knows my brain before I know my brain.”
Steve pulls a face. “I know we were joking but can you give me time to get used to the idea of you going out without-”
“Buck,” Steve says reproachfully.
He wakes up in his own bed the next morning. He’s tempted to stay in it all day but Bucky, Clint and Anna are leaving today and he wants to see them off. With that in mind, he drags himself up and through the shower, getting dressed and slipping his new sneakers on. His pulse quickens slightly at the thought of wearing them outside - where people can
Peter shrugs a little helplessly. “Steve’d tell Aunt May.”
“I can’t let you do that,” he calls easily, hands in his pockets. He’s not even got his bow, the fucking idiot, like he thinks he can stop Arto without it.
“All this at the same time that Parker is messing you about and Tony is…?”
“Yeah, supervised training when he’s twenty-one, yeah, everyone knows the deal, you are very insistently clear on the deal,” Tony says. Steve frowns at him and Tony leans up to kiss him. “Stop with the frown, I fully support you on the deal,” he murmurs against Steve’s mouth.
Arto groans. “Then what’s the point?”
His eyes are red. Oh god, he’s been crying. He’s been crying and he’s on his own. Arto feels a strange prickle of fear work down his spine and he feels suddenly very small.
“I don’t!” he protests. “I’m not into girls - no, I mean I am, I’m straight, I would be into girls if I cared but I don’t care. I don’t want to be in a relationship, I’ve got more important things to think about right now.”
The picture gets an insane amount of likes and comments, as does every photo of Arto that Bucky puts up.  It doesn’t top the picture of him wearing the Iron Man helmet, the one of him and Natasha painting Clint’s nails, or the one of him and Steve asleep on the couch, but it gets enough attention that Arto is convinced he’s going to win.
Arto shifts around so he can see a little better, putting his back to the other wing of the couch. Anna comes and plonks herself down on his knee, brandishing a book. He leans back so she doesn’t smack him in the face with the corner, watching as Steve leans against the counter, eyes fixed on Clint. He’s got a beer bottle between his fingers, tilting it back and forth.
Steve wants to burst with pride, and also maybe burst into tears because no matter how much they want Arto to grow more independent and confident, he doesn't think he's ever going to get used to Arto not needing him.
Tony gives him a
“Yeah, you dodged a pretty gross bullet there,” Clint sighs. “Though it’s not all bad. Right, I gotta go sign the Avengerlings in. Dammit, whose idea was it to put me in charge, I hate being in charge.”
“Because I love him,” Steve says. “And not being with him because I’m angry that he did something that might have meant I would have to be without him...there’s not much logic in that. Would kind of be cutting off my nose to spite my face.”
Arto lifts his face out of Steve’s shirt, looking distressed. "But then-”
“Do you tell Clint what to do?”
“It was a surprise!”
There’s a long silence. Arto looks at Steve. He’s doing that thing where he clenches his teeth together so hard that the muscle in his jaw looks like it’s going to snap. He doesn’t say anything though and neither does Pepper, and it’s getting kind of awkward.
“Came to see you,” Clint says. “I’ve got two days to hang out then I’ve got to go home for Young Avengers shit.”
"You know exactly what we're doing, and you know why-"
“Let it happen, Barnes,” Tony says. “She’ll be fine.”
Now that makes Arto raise an eyebrow because one of Steve’s major character defects is being overbearing. Tony obviously is thinking something along the same lines because he meets Arto’s eyes with a wondering look of his own.
“That he is,” Tony says, sounding intrigued as they step into the medbay. Steve can’t actually find any words this early in the morning. He settles for staring. Clint’s hair is the same, short and blond, but the face is different; no stubble, features softened slightly, longer eyelashes. And Steve can’t see much through the hospital gown he’s wearing, but he can definitely see curves.
“You are not calling me Clintina,” Clint says, at the same time Arto says, “no we’re not!”
Coney Island. They haven't been there in years. They haven't been anywhere in weeks, really. Steve has been off being a superhero and Tony has been working and working and working. No time for family outings, really.
“Yeah,” Tony says, understanding. “Me too, I think.”
Bucky responds by squirting the water right into his face. Arto splutters and tries to shove him away, but Bucky is just grinning like an asshole.
“What? She’s been sleeping through for weeks.”
fault he’s not going, instead of being because he’s scared. He’s not an idiot.”
“Fine. A shield with sharp edges,” Steve says, heaving himself up off the couch. “Want a beer?”
Tony waits it out.
Okay, that’s not where Arto expected this conversation to go. He honestly expected a conversation to make him feel better, not one that makes him feel dumb and wrong and like he’s got no idea how to be a proper person.
And Arto does remember, at least he thinks he does. He remembers getting up out of his bed and running after Steve as Steve tried to slip out the door. He remembers crying when Steve picked him up and carried him back to his bed-
“More like twelve, with traffic,” Steve nods. He looks down at the console, pulling a face at it. He doesn't say anything though so Arto leaves his music on, slumping down to look out of the window. He can see the Hudson sparkling in the sunlight, beyond that the buildings and skyscrapers that make up the edge of New Jersey.
“A box of only the marshmallow bits?” Steve asks.
“Tony’s staying,” Arto says. “He’s staying tonight.”
Once he’s got a suitable amount of coffee in him he wakes up enough to realise that
“What happened to him being spoiled?” Steve asks, wandering closer and still deciding if he’s going to be exasperated or amused.
“It’s okay,” Steve says. “It's just-”
Steve replies with some very not-allowed swears that he’d totally bust Arto for even thinking. “We’re on the way,” he says tersely and hangs up. “Arto, buckle up.” He takes his coffee back, down it in like four gulps and drops the empty cup behind his chair, before starting the car and gunning it.
“He inherited more than just your face and super strength,” Clint agrees. “You know if you call him out on being scared he’s going to flip out.”
“He likes Kate, Kate doesn’t even notice him, the world is unjust and his parents are ruining his life,” she says.
Fuck, he
Steve sighs. “Okay, have it your way. I’m sneaky.”
“I’ll be fun later,” Steve says. “Got something to show you.”
“But your taste in clothes doesn't?”
“Low blow,” Tony says. “Okay, we’re two for two on days where we’ve yelled at each other. What’s going on?”
“I know.”
Arto pauses, pencil suspended in front of the wall. “Or I could go?”
An hour later and they’re sitting in a place that advertises itself as a ‘high-end beauty lounge.’ It’s manned completely by women and is full of women and Arto feels very out of place, sitting on a stool next to Natasha’s chair with his shoulders hunched over and his hands in his pockets so no-one can see the embarrassing state of his nail varnish. Natasha seems completely at ease, sitting back while a young girl with so-blond-it’s-almost-white hair starts on a hand massage and manicure.
The man’s jaw dropped. “I did not!”
“What like he thought injecting himself with tiny robots would make perfect sense?”
Arto kicks the door. Tony’s mouth drops open in affront so Arto kicks it again. It cracks, a single line splintering up from where his foot connected with the glass.
Arto manages a watery, wobbly smile. He takes a hesitant step forward though doesn't let go of Steve’s hand, so Steve steps with him so he can edge forwards enough to take the bear from Natasha.
“What changed?”
is also a dick thing to say.
“But you don’t have to tell me that, you could have
“He just bought himself a new leather jacket, he won’t need his old one.”
Tony only hears a few seconds of conversation in the time it takes for him to walk from the top of the stairs to the kitchen, but it’s definitely enough to pique his interest. He wanders into the kitchen and just as he predicted it would, the conversation stops dead. Clint and Arto both turn in impressive synchronicity to look right at him; Arto folds his arms over his chest and glares down at the tabletop. Clint hitches baby Anna up and grimaces as she shoves spit-covered fists into his face.
“So what d'ya reckon, Short Round?” Bucky asks. “Green light on moving in?”
He descends into tears. Steve folds him up into a gentle hug, one hand resting on the back of his head. “I know,” he whispers. “I said exactly the same things when I found out.”
“I know, just hear me out. Wait an hour. Please.”
Exactly an hour later and they pulled over at a service station just on the outskirts of Chicago. He thinks it’s a coincidence really, until he comes back with drink in each hand to find Steve standing by the car already on his phone.
“Oh, and in that other room after the debrief-”
Tony waves at them somewhat manically, biting down on the urge to laugh at Arto, who looks very much like a deer caught in the headlights as everyone pours in. Kate Bishop - the Better Hawkeye - is first, all long glossy hair and designer purple shades, bow in hand and smile on her face. Pietro and Wanda Maximoff come next, side-by-side as always, bickering about god knows what. Wanda is so precious that Tony feels the need to adopt her stat, and Pietro is both hilarious and obnoxious, usually leaning more towards the latter. Finally, Kamala Khan trips out, nineteen and barely old or sensible enough to be a Young Avenger, but with a heart of gold. Actually, scrap the Magic Maximoff, Tony would adopt Kamala in a heartbeat. You know, if she didn’t have a perfectly good family already.
“Hey,” Tony says, sharp. “Cut it out. Move.”
“Use the master bathroom. Bubble bath. Don’t flood the place.”
“Whoa,” Tony says, holding up a hand. “Whoa, are you still mad about- okay. Yeah. That’s on me. I was working.”
Tony opens the door to the workshop. “Cut the alarms,” he says to the ceiling, then turns concerned eyes on Arto. “So the busting down doors thing is usually your dad’s game. What’s wrong?”
“Sure.” Steve doesn't look like he cares in the slightest, so Arto takes full advantage of that fact. The car pulls away, eerily silent as always. Bucky calls it the ninja car and absolutely adores it, even though Steve very rarely lets him - or anyone else - drive it.
He does throw the book across the room at one point, but he does go and pick it back up a few minutes later, so that barely counts as an actual explosion.
“I don’t know. If I turn up wearing a dress then everyone is going to think I’m gay!”
“You’ll be okay,” Tony says, running his fingers through Arto’s hair. “I promise, most sixteen year olds go through the same, everyone finds it hard to talk to girls, or guys-”
Steve looks up. “Hey pal,” he says. “You settle in okay?”
“Don’t forget when he’s in trouble at school, he’s yours then, too,” Tony says, finally close enough to reach out and push the paperwork down. Steve lets him without too much of a fight, sighing and rubbing at his eyes with his fingertips.
“I know I can do it, it’s only twenty-eight miles, it’s just how quick I can do it.”
“No,” Steve says. “He’s not picked up the phone all day.”
Bucky comes back in short order, sans Steve. “Steve may have not been too tactful about how he started that conversation, Stark flipped his lid because he has in no way shape or form even mentioned divorce and he’s pissed off that Steve thought it was true. Which I don’t think he did, but yeah. He didn’t open with that.”
Natasha huffs out a laugh. “Only twenty-eight, miles, sure.”
“Nope.”
He says goodbye to Clint and then makes himself say goodbye to the others, just to prove a point. He almost changes his mind when he’s got Anna in his arms and she’s resting her head on his shoulder, happily murmuring ‘Tow.’
Making Arto wash his own face seems like a battle that Steve doesn't need to entertain right now so he hefts Arto up and carries him over to the kitchen area, sitting him on the counter next to the sink. Arto watches as he turns the water on, reaching out to trace his fingertips over Steve's wrist.
“Tony,” Arto says, and Tony blinks himself out of his reverie and looks over.
“Not,” Arto says and reaches up to put a hand over Steve’s eyes as Tony-on-the-screen climbs out of the car. Steve bats his hand away and together they watch as Tony ignores the reporters, instead going around to the other side of the car to open the passenger door. For a brief moment, Arto panics that Tony has done something unprecedented - inconceivable, un
“Okay, so what’s the hold up?”
say that!”
“Good job you didn't get extensions on your nails,” Bucky says. “This wouldn't work if they were long.”
Steve sends a withering look right back at him. “He doesn’t know we talked it out and made up.”
“No, I’ll get you to harass his friends,” Steve says, not sounding remotely troubled. “Besides, Peter has a crush on you a mile wide. He’ll tell you anything.”
He swallows hard. Contemplates calling again. Feels the horrid twist in his gut turning into prickling anger, the sort which makes it hard to stand still, the sort which makes him want to scream.
“Around an hour ago,” Clint says, apparently oblivious to Arto and the tugging. “She screamed the entire flight, so that was super fun.”
Arto pulls out of his hands and starts edging across the garage, looking from car to car. He hovers near Bucky’s car, though sensibly doesn’t reach out to touch.
Over the sounds of plastic rattling, he hears Steve asking about home. He doesn’t go over but he listens very carefully as he plays with Anna.
“You’re not scared of him,” Arto says dismissively. “You’re not scared of anything.”
“No,” he yelps, trying to snatch it back. “Steve!”
“You are?” he asks doubtfully.
He just keeps his head low, finishing his breakfast as Clint tries to get Anna to eat hers, and Sam and Bruce chat idly about the news.
Steve blinks. "Excuse you?"
“Two to five business days?”
Steve bellows into the phone.
“Meet me in the garage then,” she says, no fussing about him acting weird, no trying to talk or give him hugs. She just tells him what to do and expects that he’ll do it, and today that seems like the easiest thing to do, and so he does.
At least he thinks Steve is sleeping. He’s got his back to Arto and he’s very still, but Arto’s not sure.
Ten minutes later and the car is hooked up to the charging point and Steve is unloading their bags. Arto gets out of the car to see a garage attendant staring at them both in awe. Steve has a quick word and the man is nodding vigorously, even going to far as to pop a salute as Steve turns away.
he thinks a little mournfully.
“Don’t turn on the TV!” he shouts, but damn shit
“You did,” Steve says. “And we appreciate you saying sorry, but be careful.”
“Stay awake, I'll be back,” he says hurriedly to Steve, scrambling back out of the room. And when he returns, holding out a mug of coffee like a peace offering, Steve smiles weakly.
“I hate to be the one to say this,” Tony says, giving up on trying to keep Arto’s ears covered and simply holding onto his shoulders instead. “But if you two have been…”
With Arto’s permission, he gets the hang of it pretty quickly, and he and Natasha rule the night together. Thor and the Warriors are the mice, and decide that pumpkin carrying is both fitting of the tale of Cinderella, and an excellent sport. Clint does not agree. Jane is the cat, which Thor finds vastly amusing. No-one is cast as either the stepmother or the ugly sisters, because Arto doesn’t like bad people and says he doesn’t need them in his version of the story. It does open up a few loopholes as far as plot is concerned, but they let him have it his way.
Natasha notices his silence and puts the magazine down. “What’s going on, Rogers?”
“If you can’t work it out then you don’t deserve to know.”
“Things will be okay,” Clint says, reaching up and down at the same time, awkwardly patting both Arto’s knee and Bucky’s shoulder. “It will.”
“Clint says I’m a weirdo,” he blurts out, eyes fixed on his hand, held carefully between the woman’s.
“No one knows who I am and I’ve been an Avenger for like three hundred years.”
Steve finally looks up. “No glitter?” he asks, leaning forwards to look at the samples on the counter.
And Arto is laughing and Tony is grinning and looking to Steve with a small nod, a reassuring hand resting on the small of his back. For one shining moment, Steve thinks that they’ve got this, that everything will be okay.
“Excuse you, your Dad is not obnoxious, he’s just stubborn.”
He thinks back to the white room. The one that keeps coming back in his dreams. Nightmares.
“Sure,” Fury says. He looks back towards the window, to see Steve still engrossed in his call. Arto makes a strange clicking sound, and when Nick looks back he’s staring through the window too, eyes on Steve. Looks like plan C involves staying here a while longer, because he can read that kid like a book and isn’t exactly going to up and leave him while he’s looking like that.
Arto feels very small and stupid at that. “I panicked,” he says, barely more than a mumble. He hears Steve moving around but carries on staring at the counter, trying to work out how he feels about Tony and home and this whole mess. He only stops his staring match with the marble when a plate of waffles and bacon is literally slid into his sight-line.
“Don’t go,” Arto says, looking up at Steve. “Tell Tony to come here instead. Neither of you go.”
Arto just shrugs. “Want you back to normal.”
“Sir, no, sir,” Arto says, already halfway off the bed, leaving his blanket behind. He has to take a moment to get his bearings and remember where the main bathroom is, but then he’s in and locking the door behind him. The bathroom is so insanely fancy, even more so than Steve and Tony’s bathroom back home. Everything is sleek and shining and the bath is a gloriously huge standing tub in the middle of the room. Even better – the bathroom is in the centre of the apartment so there’s no windows which means privacy, which Arto means to take full advantage of.
Arto stares at his shoes. “Okay yeah. Now I’m being a dick, aren’t I?”
They’re midway through breakfast when Clint chokes on his pancakes, eyes on his phone. He thumps himself on the chest, holding the phone out towards Steve. Steve takes it warily, and then as he looks at whatever it is, closes his eyes and makes a face that does not bode well for anyone. “
“Thank you,” Steve says, and Natasha simply goes back to her book. He looks down at Arto, gently running his hand over his head. “Come on, lets go.”
“No,” Steve immediately says, then actually looks at Arto and frowns. “Wait, you’re serious.”
“No way of knowing, I guess,” he says, and Steve thinks back to Coulson and his suggestion that they go and see Xavier. He stays silent for the moment; he’s unsure how he feels about the suggestion, and doesn’t want Tony deciding and then trying to push him to agree with what he wants. Going down that route is just inviting a fight, and Steve’s not sure he can handle fighting with Tony again so soon.
Tony lifts his head, raises a skeptical eyebrow.
Tony laughs. “Now you’re talking,” he says. “Just promise me you won’t try and interfere with Arto and his teenage angst again.”
“I’d have a shield,” Steve says, leaning forwards to add another empty beer bottle to the collection he’s got going on on the coffee table. Arto’d be worried if he didn’t know that the stuff doesn’t touch Steve in the slightest.
But he’s a Rogers, so he takes a deep breath and makes himself do it. It being taking hold of Steve’s wrist, tugging him back towards the painting of Saint George. Not looking at Steve, he points at the Princess.
Arto can barely get his brain working to comprehend what Bucky’s going on about. “He’s moving out?!”
Tony nods. “Message received,” he says. “God, I’m so sorry, Art. I should be there with you to help.”
“Tony would be calling him a skrull right now,” Steve says, watching Arto holding one of Omari’s hands. “Wow. This is exactly what we wanted, so why am I so annoyed?”
That’s good enough for him. He ducks back into the bathroom and makes sure the door is most definitely locked.
“Oh please,” Steve says. “You were texting Omari anyway.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Wow.”
Okay, so in chapter one I had written that Clint is turned into a girl by Asgardian Magic. As you do. Then I had a lovely chat with a user about the terminology used, the perceptions that the characters had of this event, and basically whether Clint is really a girl just because he has the parts. I learned a lot, and someone suggested writing a sort of coda to share what I (and Arto and the boys!) have learned. I'm in no way an expert on transgender issues, but did want to share!
Arto doesn’t reply. He stands there with his hands shoved in his pockets, avoiding Tony’s tired gaze. He doesn't know what to say. He knows his dad is super important and invents all sort of shit which helps the planet but right now he just wants Tony to be
Tony rears back like Arto has tried to hit him, his mouth opens and then he just as quickly closes it. He meets Arto’s eyes and shrugs. “Okay.”
When Steve gets back, he doesn’t even bother going to debrief. He marches straight into the tower, still suited up, and beelines straight across the workshop towards Tony.
“Can you sue them?”
“Took him for pancakes,” Tony shrugs, leaning back and smoothing his hands over Steve’s armour-clad shoulders. “I’m sorry, but the only way you could fix this one was by backing off.”
“Hey, I’ll be carrying something else for the next 10 months.”
A gloved hand rests on his shoulder, “You seem kinda nervous, Steve . So I’m going to walk you through everything I’m doing. It will be over with before you know it.”
That’s how he found himself standing outside of the master bathroom listening to Tony sing away in the shower. Shit.
See, patient.
His orgasm felt like a suckerpunch to the gut and his back arches with the release of tension. Immediately the paper gown rips completely and falls down his shoulders to leave him bare. His cock releases rope after rope of hot come on to his stomach, leaving him sticky and sweaty. Before he can even come down from the high, he feels an intense pain deep in his canal that radates through his stomach, “Jesus, fuck!”
It could be the stench of disinfectant that assaults his senses or maybe it is the immaculate hallways that make his skin itch after spending years covered in sand. Could be the fact he hasn’t stepped foot in a hospital since the day his mother died.
Dammit. Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes, threatening to spill. Toni hadn’t shared the horrible results of her reproductive health review with Steve, she couldn’t bear the sadness and disappointment this would cause. He was so excited when his came back clean, the fear of historical medical issues and the serum washed away. He wanted this so badly and she wanted to give it to him.
Steve had two options as he saw it, either run out of the bathroom with his now collected treasure or let Tony know he was there. If he tucked and ran, Tony would ask JARVIS who was there and he would be pissed. Option two, he told Tony he was in there, he could explain the situation and maybe Tony would go easy on him. If he kept it really casual, made it seem like it was normal, maybe he could defuse the situation. Normal for Steve to break into his ex’s bathroom while they were in the shower. Another SHIELD tactic, thank you Nick Fury.
The lips returned to suckle at the head and Tony could hear the repetitive slap of slap of skin on skin as Steve jerked off below. The vibrations of soft whimpers shot down his dick, pulling his orgasm from his body. “Fuck baby, here it comes.”
Like usual, after service Tony and Steve discarded the ceremonial robes after the last members left. He thought he imagined it, the first time he caught Father Rogers looking at his ass. He wouldn’t, he was a man of the cloth, didn’t Holy fathers take a vow of chastity? If he was looking at anyone it would be a woman, not another man. Was he still high from Friday night? Were all the drugs finally rotting his brain? Then it happened again, while Tony was picking up a dropped pamphlet. Okay this time he wasn’t making that up. That had to have been a look.
The rest of Tony’s conversation was drowned out by the heady rush that the word brought him. The call ended and Tony threw the phone on the bed, both hands twisted in Steve’s hair to guide him through a steady rhythm. Steve should be mortified, he was sucking a married man’s dick while he was on the phone with his wife, but none of that mattered when it meant being with Tony.
The first time Steve realized he liked older men was when he was eight. A couple in their late twenties had recently moved in a few doors down from him and Ma, the wife was a dressmaker and he worked at the shipping docks. He had a kind smile, but the hard labor took a toll on his body, leaving him with premature rough hands and lean muscles. Steve and Bucky would sit on the steps most days, since Steve couldn’t go any farther with his asthma, and he would look forward to seeing the husband come home caked in sweat and dirt, wearing a beat up tank top and cap. Then he would go in, kiss his wife, and the routine would start again. Steve didn’t understand the heat that filled his gut at this age.
