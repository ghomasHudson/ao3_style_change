A snort left Edward’s lips; he stopped touching Pepper’s hand and instead brought it to touch his jaw and his cheeks.
The white pearls of his teeth stained in red were shown when his pink lips stretched in a wicked smile.
-well, we aren’t match for any being if the underworld, they have lived more, they are stronger and surely more intelligent, we need undeads on our side if we want earth to still existing –
Edward Stark took his surrounding with cold indifferent eyes, his gaze went to the puddle of blood that his shape left when he was on the floor, Edward knew that this time there was no space for emotions, Tony was a weak emotional being, Edward was the brains and the indifference. With the betrayal of all the Avengers Tony needed someone stronger than him, someone who could support all the shit that was going to come because of the mess that they left behind.
The fight was an epic one, with gore, blood and violence, the hate that emited from the pores of the heroes that were left alive was palpable through the air, Captain Marvel, Rocket and  Tony Stark did a great job making a  plan to beat the shit out of Thanos, Meanwhile,
“Sweetheart, we are the same person if I am psychotic then you are psychotic too besides this way is more fun”
-Very unlikely, is for that reason that we need the drop of blood of five of you, we are going to call for a being with the same beliefs or at least with a connection with some of you-
Thanos was dead, now for good and forever, the infinity stones where in Strange’s capable hands and the heroes that had disappear that time now were alive… very much alive.
then? Pretty friendship with a pass for a unicorn’s party, the only difference is that instead of friendship you almost got killed by no other than captain tight ass and instead of a pass for a party you got a very lovely ticket to the land of the death”
In that minute the door opened letting the doctor walk into the room, he was an old man almost bald with little circular lenses and a gray moustache under his nose.
-Why are we here?- Clint was the first to ask. Everyone’s gaze fell on him. Almost all his hair was gray now, the humor that used to reflect on his face was gone and was replaced with tiredness.
He closed his eyes remembering the pasts events, Steve Rogers Kissing him, Steve Rogers inside him, thrusting with all his might while Tony moaned of the pleasure, Steve Rogers and his shield piercing his skin… Then, it came.
-T-Tony…He… I didn’t even, I didn’t told him that I-I l-love him- Natasha bit her lip, trying not to scream from frustration.
His honey brown eyes didn’t have bags any more, he had slept an awfully lot in the hospital after all, his hair reached down to his ears and his beard covered all his cheeks and jawline.
The mansion felt so right.The familiar place brought him comfort, he couldn’t wait to go to the workshop to greet DUMM-E, BUTTERFINGERS AND U, to build again and put his music the volume he wanted.Now that the Avengers wasn’t around anymore everything was calmer, it was the first time that he felt so good being alone.
“Tony? Who are you talking to?” Pepper asked from the doorframe, she was wearing a blue tube skirt with a white buttoned blouse, her stilettos making soft clicking noises as she walked.
“well I have to differ on that I mean I love myself I really do, but if you hate yourself is understandable I mean you are so fucking stupid, aren’t we supposed to be a genius? You make us look bad dude, how could a bunch of pathetic useless bastards deceive you?”
“Oh fuck yeah! When can I go? I swear if I keep seeing more white I’ll have the nurses paint my room red and gold”
“Oh no. sweetheart. I look like Tony stark” Edward got up a walked to the mirror. His reflection looked right back at him “But we both now that I am not you”
Ten years passed, Steve still looked pretty young despite being the oldest among all his friends, sure he had more wrinkles but nothing compared with the others, that was when he realized that he was getting older much slower than an average human being and for the first time in years he thought in suicide, Bucky moved to live with Steve to make sure that he was keeping himself alive, Natasha and Clint decided to live together just as friends, Bruce became a famous scientist and made Peter his assistant, Rhodey was getting tired of being a soldier and  Thor sometimes went traveling with The Guardians of the galaxy when they needed help, sometimes with Loki sometimes alone.
"Well, Clint can't really go until next week, because he's supposed to be teaching Angela some of the baking side of things. And I've got all kinds of appointments this week that I really don't want to reschedule. I know it's a huge thing, but it really would be great to set this up."
He sits down and types out a list on his tablet, trying to come up with reasons why the owners of Brewed Awakening might want to alter their plans. By the time he's come up with what he thinks are bulletproof arguments, it's time to pick Casey up from school. Tony leaves the office and walks down the street, a solid 20 minutes early, of course. He stands outside the gate of the property, watching the traffic and pedestrians while he waits. He spends some time staring at the empty building next door. The contractors are still busily working away – Tony's not sure what the space used to be, but clearly it hadn't been set up as an eatery of any kind. The contractors are having to install the counter, build a kitchen, the whole nine yards.
happening," Steve growls protectively, not even caring anymore about trying to hide how he feels. It doesn't matter. Tony's rejection of him doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that Casey is missing, kidnapped, and the man that Steve loves is in pain.
"I… yes?" Because of course it'd been good. Steve is probably the best thing to happen to Tony. And if last night is any indication, the spark is nowhere near the vicinity of being in danger of dying.
Steve assumes he's headed for Casey. If nothing else, he'd have to be a piece of shit to kidnap a child in the first place, so surely he wouldn't have an issue with using the boy as a human shield.
The server comes by a minute later for their order, and then swings by again with a basket of bread. They’ve been here often enough that no one ever makes a big deal about them, which is one of the many reasons Tony loves this place. As they chat, the tension they’ve both been carrying in the past days bleeds out of their shoulders, and by the time the server returns with their food, Tony feels as though there couldn’t be anything wrong with the world.
Steve doesn't want to think about how she could have known that that was information he really needed to hear. Part of him hopes it's because Rhodey had filled her in on what had happened in the Haven, while at the same time another part is hoping she has no idea.
"Yeah, he's a little banged up. Wrenched his knee pretty good but I think it's just a sprain. He should be okay but he'll have to get it checked out when we get back to the city."
Tony jumps to his feet and is halfway to the door before she stops him, hand resting gently but firmly on Tony’s arm.
"I wanted to do this the easy way," she says. "But you had to be difficult. Dad always said you were nothing but a pain in his ass."
He wonders, briefly, if Casey would have grown up to be like him, then he shuts the thought down immediately. It seems impossible, that he could have met that beautiful little boy, could have known that deep-down, unconditional love for him, and have it taken away like Casey had never existed at all.
"Outreach programs, huh? Is that what this is about?" Tony asks, nodding to the half-full jar of buttons on the counter.
"It has been," Tony agrees. "I'm really hoping that once I have this project up and going, I can be a little more hands off, and have a little more time."
just a random civilian, you know," Steve points out, lips ticking up in a smirk, but Tony waves him off.
Apparently, Tony had meant what he'd said about seeing them later, because after that, he starts coming in to grab his coffee every single morning after dropping Casey off at school. It's honestly the highlight of Steve's entire day. Eventually, Tony stops trying to pay for the coffee since Steve and the staff always refuse his money, but periodically he shoves money inside the suspended coffee and meals jar. It's a compromise that Steve is willing to accept. He's not going to turn down money for that program.
He doesn’t  want this. He’s got nothing against this woman or how she makes her living, but he doesn’t want this. He feels awkward and out of place, and even with her beautiful soft skin and curves so close to his space, he can’t help the way he yearns for  strong arms and shoulders instead, sculpted by hours working in a shop, of bright brown eyes and scruff covered chin. He shoves those images aside and turns his focus back on the woman. He’s got a job to do.
“What the hell?” Tony frowns and looks up just in time to see Clint rush into the space and duck behind a chair. “Clint? What the hell?”
Rhodey keeps talking, and Tony keeps staring across the room at Steve as he gives those great big thousand-watt grins to every patron that walks up to the counter.
Then, there it is. A door. Up ahead, a little to his right. A heavy door opening with a loud, metallic scrape, a thud against a concrete wall.
They undress one another slowly, gently. Each time Tony removes an article of Steve's clothing, he kisses the newly exposed skin. He's seen Steve naked before, of course, but this is different. He's covered in bruises – some fresh, some from the car accident that had been only a week ago. Tony kisses each bruise with a soft brush of lips.
"Hey, take it easy there, buddy, you've been put through the ringer," Tony says, resting a hand on Vision's shoulder.
The Whateley family founded the town, such as it is, in 1819, but before that I don’t think there were any white settlers on the mountain.
He tried to sound confident, and not think about how pale Thor had been on the way back, or the rasp in his voice and the gleam of fever in his blue eyes.
The yellow dividing line in the middle was the only color in a whole landscape that should have been ablaze in red, orange, gold, and pine green, even on a dank afternoon.
A familiar dark substance had stained its worn, smiling muzzle, hand sewn from castoff corduroy by some mother or grandmother.
Talk about that again and I’ll make sure you spend a month on long-range patrol with Squirrel Girl.”
Tony dropped him and the body crumpled to the ground in a boneless heap, leaving a dark smear that obscured a small section of carvings.
The splintery swaybacked stairs of the front porch creaked under his feet in a counterpoint to the chains on the old swing and a cool damp breeze sent the first fallen leaves of the season skittering across the boards.
He tapped his control panel and a map of West Virginia appeared on the screen between him and the team, showing sites marked with different government logos.
Though the thing at Steve’s feet remained prone and stunned, Machen continued to giggle on the wall above them.
The road snaked through switchbacks and sharp drops, an incongruous ribbon of fresh black tarmac, though the builders had not bothered with signs or guardrails.
Tiny wooden beads from a broken or disintegrated rosary lay scattered around the body and flaky streaks of something stained the rock black in the harsh white light.
As he trudged back up the marked and stabilized shafts, he realized that he had no idea if the sun would be up when he got out, but he hoped so.
The winding back road down the mountain was nearly as dark as the shafts of the mine, trees blocking most of the moon, and the few neighboring houses slept far recessed from the dirt track.
He had hurled it into a snowy wood one drunken, angry night, and in the sobering light of day had never managed to find it.
He had done that on purpose, as though Thor could still be protected if he diluted the sound somehow.
Something sinuous and black had begun to work its way out of the bullet wound, and it wriggled weakly in the light.
The cavern’s deep cold seeped through the thin layer of his breeched undersuit and the first serious shiver shook him.
When Steve heard the heavy step of Tony’s metal boots, he straightened up and forced himself to stop, but not before Tony saw him force himself straight and swallow hard to keep it in.
Can we stop it?” Natasha looked up, at Thor and Tony and Steve, and over to the wall where Clint muttered and struggled.
I’m stuck up here until my blood work comes back clean, but every time they test me I’ve gotten more of it out of my system.”
Fury’s file says the head scientist was a man named Doctor Machen, but everything on the guy is very, very classified.
The sharp click of a cocked rifle punctuated her request, and she aimed it at them with the ease of long practice.
He brought his hands up to climb the rope and found his fingers were playing with the buckles of his harness, toying with the idea of dropping, and he didn’t know why.
Just get it done quick and clean and come back, and if it maybe isn’t possible to salvage the place, I would not weep for its tragic loss.”
He wasn’t sure what he’d expected— more tunnel, more than likely, or a little dead end where the work had stopped— but he found himself in a vast cavern.
Tony tore himself away from Thor’s awful stare and sliced through the tentacles, hacking them away until Thor fell.
Santana’s suicide, Defoe’s sudden and aggressive cancer, the six new hires from North Carolina who had all vanished overnight…all of it he’d rationalized away, but he’d always felt in the dark byways of his mind that it was the shaft, the job he’d given them, that was responsible.
With Steve’s help, Thor sat against Tony’s left side and peered at them, his face still gray and cadaverous in the darkness.
Tony increased the audio and heard that it was not German he spoke, but some much more ancient and foul tongue that human mouths had never learned to truly replicate.
He felt tempted to shoot the poor man himself, but his scanners were really freaking out now and his mind raced to make sense of the impossible data they reported.
Although some of the gingerbread trim had broken off and the window glass was dark and milky with age, someone had painted it in recent memory and a crisp sign in the grass explained it was the Crow Mountain Municipal Building and Library.
Tony thought about the spray of gore as Steve sliced through tentacles and Sarah Buckman’s blood soaking him up to the elbows and wasn’t surprised.
“If Thor tries to return, I have authorization to send up Lt. Col. Rhodes in the Thorbuster prototype.”
A massive sound, something like Thor’s thunder and something like the awful goat laugh he’d heard several times before, shook the cavern and the portal quivered and shuddered and, to his horror, widened.
Thor and Clint had their horns locked over the box, empty save for one glazed cake donut, and they each seemed to be waiting for the other to back down or glance away long enough to snatch victory.
He hesitated at the tap, lip curled in distaste, and then drew himself a pale golden beer that fizzed like soda.
You two get me anything you can on Crow Mountain, and I don’t care who you piss off or how you get it.”
Tony picked him up and held him as he shook, not caring about the dire warnings his suit tried to show him.
He didn’t say anything about how they were supposed to wait but Tony could hear the annoyance in his voice.
“He hasn’t woken up yet, but Dr. McCoy tells me that he’s starting to make progress and they think he’ll pull through like you did.”
He returned to Steve and touched down on the relative safety of the ledge, but he still felt the vast empty space behind him and his skin crawled beneath the armor.
Thor grinned and raised his hammer, but above them all a series of sluices opened up and hosed the entire room with something pale green that smelled of ammonia.
He sat at one of the computer terminals farthest away from the mess and glared at the ruined lab like he dared it to try anything.
Thor met his eyes with a question, Natasha looked at Steve, and Clint suddenly found it necessary to devote all of his attention to making sure the disinfectant hadn’t damaged his bow.
Tony bumped against his chest one last time as he came to a stop, and then Thor’s arm went limp and spilled them onto the frost-rimed ground.
Tony thought of and immediately discarded a variety of questions, and they crunched their way over the broken glass in silence.
Thor and Tony left the porch as Jimmy Buckman cleared the treeline, or at least what had once been him.
His skin had gone necrotic dark and clung to his bones like a squamous, papery afterthought, and his eyes shone with a feverish gleam from his sagging face.
A late model Jeep Cherokee with a Mountaineers bumper sticker sat outside next to an older pickup, and Tony could see boxes or suitcases stacked inside the Jeep.
Steve seemed to find his issue with remembering dates more comical than infuriating, for which he could only be grateful.
Tony had difficulty locating the house even from the air. Ancient pines and maples formed a dense canopy that obscured the unlit houses and even the roads from his perception, and it took almost an hour to find the right house in the deepening dark.
They writhed and withered and their psychic shrieking echoed through Tony’s head again, changing character rapidly like a radio going up and down the frequencies, as though they tried to find one that affected the system that was causing their death.
Tony walked past them, forced so close by the cramped confines that he had to brush against them, even weave between them.
These were all off, blind and showing nothing more than a reflection of the abandoned dinner tray on the desk.
Steve put an arm around Tony’s neck, but another violent coughing fit ruined his confident demeanor.
If it’s abandoned, we’ll find whatever intelligence is around and come back here to plan a trip into the mountain.
He tried an experiment and this time the face visor of his suit opened without giving him any warnings.
He wondered what the others heard, but neither the shield nor the hammer wavered as the cavern below them caved in.
The visor slid up and at last they were eye to eye in the dim blue light of the reactor, as they had been on so many happier nights before.
He waded in with Steve behind him and this time, the remains of the research team had no chance to gain an upper hand.
The thought that Carlton might have secured himself to the post in the hope that his rescuers would be in time to save him, or at least take his report, hurt even more than the idea of his despair.
“Do you truly wish my assistance, or did you want to allow the Captain some time with his friend?” Thor asked.
With death, or worse than death, almost certain in the hours ahead, they both found a center of calm.
He could not hear it scream, but he felt vibration in the air all around him as the countless remaining arms flew his way.
Tony could, with the sensors turned up, faintly hear something from the other side, a hiss of metal scraping metal and a soft clink at uneven intervals that made him think there was something human causing the noise.
He went back to the door and looked through the plate to where he was still standing on the other side of the decontamination barrier.
Whatever had been working its way out of her made one last effort, grasping and straining for the outside world, but it fell limp and began to disintegrate.
He felt his face grow pale inside the suit, because he had never shown Clint the dead agent’s logs, or let him hear the strange recordings.
The prickle and burn spread from both thighs up into his belly and from his right armpit into his chest.
“You see a future in which humanity still clings to their electric replacements for campfires and numbs themselves to the true horrors of the universe with the pabulum of glowing screens.
“So how does an avant garde artist from New England end up doing a huge bronze for someplace so far remote as this?” Natasha asked.
A drawing pad and pen lay discarded on Tony’s bedside table, open to a sheet covered with sinuous, abstract black designs.
Tony’s stomach clenched and a series of tiny fans clicked on within the suit to dry the chill sweat that broke out on his skin.
Fog hung over the wooded hills, obscuring all but the rounded top of Crow Mountain and the cluster of grey buildings that grew over it like a scab.
He didn’t know why, but it reminded him of their first night together, of seeing that look in Steve’s eyes and knowing that what happened next was going to
Its ruined head hung limp amid the rolling mass of its tentacles, blind and dragging a rope of dark clotted brain matter along the ground.
Still, Thor answered the order, and a weak white corona of lightning crackled around the head of his hammer.
He let himself in and undressed in the mudroom, dumping his gray denim coverall in the washer for the morning.
No one wanted to talk about it, and it seems like the police departments in the neighboring towns don’t like to come up here.
He fired the boots to give him some thrust and leapt up, kicked his legs out straight and hammered the thing on his back between the slime-fouled stone and his shoulders.
“And I’d like to believe that there’s an innocent explanation for what they were researching, but I don’t have faith.”
The back of the room was similar but the table had no restraints and faced a half dozen morgue style drawers.
Report.” Tony noted he was still not back to first name status with his boyfriend, but he had bigger problems to deal with.
He still had his hand at his temple, but his eyes were focused on Thor as though the darkness was no impediment at all, and he whispered and crooned tunelessly to himself.
He shook his head and scrabbled at the thing with his gauntlets, but it clung like tar, sticky and amorphous.
He was no expert, but the figures didn’t look like they were all the same age or made by the same person.
He settled in to the work, calmed by the soothing routine of shifting and breaking and smoothing down a path.
Someone had knocked a tray of instruments askew, or perhaps the explosion had done that, and the scalpel blades were stained with the same dark substance.
All three of them recoiled from the huge, insensible thing before realizing that the lines were not tentacles but veins of coal and dark-stained carvings etched into the stone.
He used the reactor in his chest to illuminate the scene and he and Steve moved forward in practiced unison.
“And it didn’t say anything about alien parasitic fungal infections that make you lose your mind and throw yourself into a bottomless hole.”
Broken glass glittered and crunched under their feet where a table full of flasks and beakers had been overturned, the first sign of violence they had seen.
He held Tony’s hand, but now that he was awake he could see that the burning numbness spread from an IV in the crook of his elbow.
It was still almost impossible to see if the thing even had a central mass when it hit his helmet and latched on.
The money would be in the account tomorrow, he thought like a mantra, like saying the Lord’s Prayer each night with his mother.
Steve could cut or bash them down and pin them to the rough stone, and Tony could keep the others back with his light and burn them to a second, merciful death.
I…I called it the Thorbuster, but it’s really to neutralize any Asgardian level threat, and I would never…”
She stepped into the pool of moonlight from the window and the curve of her heavily pregnant belly came into view, swathed in a loose pink nightgown.
Even though they had their own seats, Thor’s shoulders still crowded into Tony’s space and his friend asked him a question with only his eyes:
Mjolnir burst through the creature with a spatter of black gore and smacked into Thor’s waiting palm.
He showed them proof of what the toxins here could do, and he convinced them that he could weaponize it.
They did not see Steve but it felt as though he walked behind them, their shared affection for him like a physical presence.
Nothing moved in the quiet country night except the trees that swayed in the wind further up the mountain.
The tiny bit of pain might as well have been someone else’s for all he could feel it, and he hated the disconnected, clumsy feeling of his gauntleted fingers.
His suit reported that the temperature had fallen to thirty-six degrees since sunset, though the cold didn’t bother his teammates.
Oily, featureless black tentacles whipped and writhed above the tops of the ancient trees, and it moved forward on a similar mass that left a slimy trail through the fallen leaves.
Tony kept his opinion about the odds of that to himself, but from the looks on their faces Thor and Natasha shared his pessimism.
Tony wished he could take it back, because it seemed they were still going for “cool and professional” in front of the others.
He felt tension in the room, his fellow Avengers quiet and on edge as they settled in to wait for Steve.
"Bring him downstairs," Hammer instructed Bates as he exited the room. Bates was quick to comply, untangling Tony from the chair and walking him after Hammer with a hold on the back of his t-shirt.
"It's been almost fifteen minutes already," he said curtly, eyeing Tony as he finally managed to pull the t-shirt over himself.
"Huh?" Rogers replies brainily. "Uh, no reason, just wondering. How does Rose react to him being away? I mean, I don't want to intrude or imply anything, but the man seems to hardly be at home. I'm just wondering how she's holding up." The alpha looks extremely uncomfortable after his admission, shifting slightly on his feet and twitching his fingers around his glass. Their friendship is still tentative at best, and Tony figures that Rogers doesn't want to offend Tony and start another fight. They had gotten off the wrongest leg possible, after all.
He turns his cool gaze back to Rick, as if urging him to say something, and when Tony turns to look at his husband too, he notices the tight set of his jaw and the carefully veiled disdain.
When Steve still didn't do anything to stop Natasha, Rhodey shook his head and rushed out of the viewing room.
"You don't even know if she even wants to run the company when she's of age, or if she'll present as an alpha. She could just as well present as a beta." Tony deviously smirks up at Rick. "Or, an ome--"
It's a month later, and everyone has just about settled back into the same old routine that they had prior to the mission that had gone awry.
"Not a chance," Tony growled automatically, glaring up at Ezekiel. His misery was quickly turning to anger.
The thought washed him with an artificial calm of sorts, all the way until Ezekiel opened the door to the dining room. He stepped over the threshold and held the door open for Tony. Tony grit his teeth and crawled after him, flushing and preparing himself for the humiliation.
Tony had to give it to him; asshole or not, the man was dedicated to delivering Tony to whomever it was that wanted him, no matter the costs.
"You fought him. And you lost. And everyone else paid for it." Ezekiel abruptly let go of Tony's face and grabbed a hold of his arm instead. He pulled on it harshly and Tony feared his shoulder would come out of its socket, but then he was falling down to the floor. He rolled over and glanced at his hands; his wrists were still cuffed, but the chain was now secured to only one of them, hanging freely from the D-ring.
"I'm not even sure why I'm surprised at this point. Coffee?" Rogers nods and turns to grab the fresh pot from the machine and pours Tony a cup. Romanov settles on the barstool next to him with Rose on her lap.
, the custody of (a) possible descendant(s) and the legal rights to the remaining property of both parties. This contract is lawful and valid until the death of either of the parties, until a clause is broken and the contract is redone or until the alpha descendant of ANTHONY STARK takes over the position as the CEO of
Even after too many tests, Tony can't still be too sure that Rose's really okay. She'd been exposed to palladium for whole nine months that Tony'd been pregnant after all, a little while after that, too, when Tony breastfed her, but somehow she has made full recovery if she even ever was sick or dying. Tony had stopped breastfeeding the moment it had dawned on him that the palladium was poisoning his body, and then continued to sleep in the nursery floor in the fear of Rose dying while he was in bed the next room over. Rick had wondered about his odd behavior, but never asked, and Tony never told him.
He feels himself blushing. "Why are you thanking me? You're not supposed to be thanking me. It's the other way around." He pauses briefly, awkwardly. "So, thanks," he continues, lamely, and exits his kitchen. "And don't break anything!" he calls back when he's out the doorway, and hears Rogers bark out a laugh at the comment.
However, a DNA match alone couldn't prove someone's involvement in a crime. False matches happened from time to time, or at least that was what Natasha had told him.
Tony's heart had begun speeding up as the car had slowed down. Now, as Marco pulled the keys out of the ignition lock, it was beating out of his chest.
Spider-Man glanced at Nebula, but the mask he wore betrayed no emotions. He turned back to Steve as he continued, "We think we've got a lead."
Then Rick had offered Rosie a flower also, and of course it had been a rose to match her name, and the girl had gone absolutely bananas about it and demanded it to be pinned to her chest as well as everyone else to wear a flower to their chest, too. She'd even gone as far as distributing flowers to the staff that had set the table and prepared their dinner, before finally sitting down when Tony'd gone to fetch her.
"I told you about my wife yesterday," Ezekiel finally said, breaking the suffocating silence. He had been circling behind Tony, and he jerked slightly at the sound of Ezekiel's voice.
She pulls her head away from the water bottle to answer, almost managing to get water all over herself. The water only ends up hitting Tony's jeans, thanks to the omega jerking the bottle back into an upwards position when he anticipates the toddler's move. "Yeah," she says, wiping at the droplets of water on her chin. "Please," she adds at Tony's expectant look.
"Be good and we'll see to getting you something to eat," he said. Tony wanted to snipe something at him, but he curbed the urge. Instead, he allowed himself to roll his eyes. They wouldn't buy his act were he to completely alter his behavior, after all.
Tony raises his gaze to look at the captain who looks uncomfortable at being put in the situation. "Sure, if he wants to," the omega finds himself saying. It seemed to be the right choice, as Rogers is once again settling down.
"Because you knew it was the right thing to do," Ezekiel replied, like it was as simple as that. "Because you knew that you shouldn't be in control."
Hammer laughed again, and Tony thought that listening to the sound of it was getting real old real fast. "To the
"You can't do anything, okay!" he exclaims, trying to get his point across before the two force him to cease the lockdown. "We are married, so he isn't breaking any laws and we have a contract that means that I can't get rid off him without losing everything, alright?" Tony's slightly out of breath from all the adrenaline, and he watches Steve and Clint standing there with confused looks on their faces.
Rick didn't want a baby to look after right away, so Tony was allowed to stay on suppressants, although Rick changed his prescription from his Father's supplements to the ones recommended by Tony's new doctor. Ones that didn't dampen his scent or stop his heats, just prevented him from getting pregnant.
"No, Tony, don't," Steve interrupts him, shaking his head and carding a hand through his hair. The alpha looks somewhat panicked, which is a rare expression on his face. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. I just--I don't know what I was thinking. You have an alpha and--"
After a while Rick has to leave yet again, and Tony is quick to follow suit, since now that Rosie is being taken care of he has a leeway to take care of SI business outside of the tower more often. He attends a couple of meetings and goes to see R&D before he has to leave so he can pick up Rose, and this time the whole ordeal goes on without any hiccups.
Tony likes Obie, he really does, since he seems to be one of the only alphas in Tony's life that treat him with at least some level of respect. Usually he just gets clumped together with the other upper class omegas, with their pretty faces and empty heads.
"Not so fast," was what Rhodey told him, and in that moment Steve wanted to punch him for ruining his relief. He turned to see what the man was looking at.
Tony raises his eyebrows, pinches his mouth, as if he's considering Steve's words. "Yes. For the time being," he agrees. Steve finally smiles.
Four hacked security cameras. A couple of knocked out goons. One alarm they set off that JARVIS intercepted before it went into the system. One and a half doors that Thor managed to destroy nigh silently.
"And how to overpower Tony and keep him subdued," Jim forced out, although it pained him. He swallowed and dropped his gaze to the box between Steve and him. Steve looked down to it as well.
, but himself being unable to hold the position of the chief executive officer (CEO) of said company, the responsibilities of that position shall be transferred from ANTHONY STARK to his mate-to-be, RICHARD DARROW, when the current CEO, ALPHA HOWARD STARK, so decides, or is himself unable to continue serving under the title. The transfer requires a lawful marriage between the two parties before it is valid.
How could his designs be out there? It was like being dosed with cold water, the blowback from that press conference over ten years ago fresh in his mind again. Obie's greasy fingerprints all over everything.
"Why not? It was published in 1929, when Captain Rogers was...hmm, I believe it would be sixteen then. Am I correct, Captain Rogers?"
Rosie hums like she agrees against Tony's collarbone, giving away that she had been listening in. Tony brushes a hand over her small head, trying not to think how full of tangles the toddler's hair currently looks and how he's going to spend the evening attempting to untangle it.
"Get up," Ezekiel told him. When Tony wasn't able to comply right away, he shocked him with the baton once more. "I said get up."
"So, let's not," Tony cuts in easily, flashing an obviously fake smile at the scientist before exiting the elevator that has just arrived to the common floor. Steve is there, because that's where he always is, and the captain perks up at the sound of the elevator doors. Unfortunately though, the man is too perceptive for his own good and seems to notice something is going on at the first glance at Tony's face.
Although, that scenario was highly unlikely, or so his doctor and his parents had been telling him since his first ever physical (which he of course had no memory of). All the signs pointed to Tony presenting as an alpha when the time for it came. And if not an alpha, then at least a beta.
He was lying face down on the floor, his arms stretched before him, circling around something. Another nudge caused him to groan irritably. He attempted to move his shoulder away from whoever it was that kept on bugging him.
ANTHONY STARK shall have a position within the company. His position will encompass the functions of an Advisor, and every decision made considering
"My wife," Ezekiel gritted out and struck Tony again, uncaring of the raised welts Tony could feel forming on his back, slowly purpling into bruises or splitting open and weeping blood. Tony cried out, desperately holding back tears of agony. "My
"Love you too, Daddy," she tells him, and squeezes his neck in a way Tony has interpreted to mean she likes whoever she's squeezing. He smiles and blows a raspberry against her cheek, causing her to giggle and let go of him. He brushes a hand over her forehead in an attempt to calm her down before sleeping, then gets up.
Tony lets the smile on his lips warm up a notch, and catches Rogers' cheeks reddening slightly. Maybe it's the wine, he thinks, although he knows that Rogers has a super soldier metabolism. It can't be the wine.
"Yeah, that's true, I guess." The coffee's finally ready and Tony grabs his mug and pours it full, taking a sip right away and cursing at his burnt tongue.
"Okay, baby. Get your toothbrush," Tony instructs Rosie when he holds her up before the mirror cabinet in Rosie's bathroom. He knows that it's not normal for a toddler to have their own adjoining bathroom, but unfortunately there aren't many things normal in Rosie's life (at least when it comes to her parents or the way they live), so Tony has decided to ignore the fact. Furthermore, every bedroom on their floor has a bathroom as well, so why bother changing it.
Then, abruptly, Steve makes a choking sound, and Tony's hands are already removing the tapes and pulling out the ventilator tube. Steve draws in a large, raspy breath once the tube is discarded, and Tony brings his hand back to rest on his chest.
Ezekiel said, indicating to himself, "had vanished. Her mother and father had vanished. She had no one. She died of
his inner voice chastises him, sounding suspiciously like a combination of Steve and Bruce on their mother hen modes. Hah, Steve's mother hen mode. He wonders when he'll see that again. Or whether, he adds darkly.
Which is a fair point, Tony has to admit. But it didn't seem like that to him. The man seemed to genuinely know something, and was all too happy to gloat to Tony about it. Normally, Tony would just ask the man himself once he was securely behind the bars, but Steve's shield seemed to have knocked him into a state of coma, so that's out of the question.
"First one out!" she exclaimed happily and Tony studied her face intently. It wasn't covered in blood as he had anticipated.
That caught Tony off guard. Tonight he was off his game, still unbalanced and raw from Ezekiel's treatment earlier, and if Hammer was going where Tony thought he was with this...he wasn't sure what he was going to do. Lose it, probably.
"Morning," Tony greets back, and lets the toddler change her strangulation hold from Rick's to Tony's neck. The toddler is still half-asleep, and seems to succumb into even deeper slumber once she inhales the scent of her omega Daddy.
He decided it was wisest to obey, so he slowly rose up to his feet, almost tripping as wooziness swept over him. Ezekiel steadied him with a hand on his arm. When he was standing still, firmly on his two feet, Ezekiel let go of him and took a step farther from him.
As he straightened however, eyes still fixed on the two men groaning on the ground, he was grabbed from behind, burly arms twining around his chest and pinning his arms to his sides. He growled and kicked, landing one into the man's knee, and his hold around Tony came loose. He turned, punched him in the nose and as luck would have it, someone else was grabbing him again from behind.
"Could you look after this for me," he instructs absently, gesturing to his kid and the stove with a circular movement of his hand as he starts walking out of the room.
"Hey," he greets everyone once he reaches the kitchen. Everyone echoes his word. Everyone except one.
"Shut up, Marco," Beard hissed back, sliding off the bench. He stopped once he was close enough to loom over Tony, one knee braced against the floor. "I don't take orders from you," he told Back Pain — Marco.
"That is not good," Steve said with no real concern to his voice. He felt like it was his duty to protest, but he didn't much care what Natasha did to Dr. Miller. Not, if she got a confession out of her, at least. All that mattered right now, was Tony.
"You won't be building anything, but you'll need to hold a pen. Even Hammer's not moronic enough to let you near tech," Bates said and Tony blinked up at him; had he just insulted his own boss? Bates seemed to catch his train of thought since he continued, "I'm loyal to him, but that doesn't mean I'm blind to his shortcomings."
Hammer's smile was just as strained now. "Ah, prison. Yes, very pleasant. Got out, no ankle monitor or anything," he said, brandishing his foot as if he needed to prove it. He gestured to Tony, flourishing the hand that held a flute of champagne. "In any case, what a lovely surprise. To believe that you, Anthony Edward Stark of all beings, decided to grace us with your presence..."
ALPHA RICHARD TERRENCE DARROW (born August 16, 1969) and OMEGA ANTHONY EDWARD STARK (born May 29, 1970) are to be wed the year they have both graduated from their studies (date to be settled later). The responsibilities and faithfulness in the marriage are considered as part of the clauses in this contract. A proper mating bond is required for this contract to be valid.
Tony supposed he maybe should have paid more mind to his tone, with what the way Justin Hammer's brow was currently twitching from anger, but he had been feeling on edge since he first heard that too familiar whine yesterday evening. Additionally, getting kidnapped and manhandled hadn't helped with the matter.
"You're too slippery for your own good," Bates told him, moving in a way that indicated he was tying the rope into a knot. "And your little stunt just now did nothing to discourage me of the fact."
I'm gonna confess that I seriously considered just abandoning all my works here on Ao3. It's been a shitty almost-a-year for me and you guys probably deserve a better explanation, but I think it's not gonna be that relevant to most of you. Also, you'll most likely appreciate an update more than a sad recount.
With that, he closed the door and left Tony alone in the bathroom. Tony almost wished he hadn't, since the moment he did, the crushing reality of what had happened with Ezekiel felt tangible enough to choke him to death. He felt embarrassed for crying in front of him. He felt ashamed for the accusations he had thrown in his face. He felt guilt for all those people that had suffered.
Steve commands. Tony rolls his eyes at him, but doesn't disobey. Although, he does descend a little, circling around to keep the base in his sights.
"We managed to escape when Nat got the chance to sneak into the facility's control room and brew up a commotion. Although, the complete ordeal required a slew of cool combat moves and a few collapsed walls, but--"
Steve swallows, and Tony dares to scent the air around him. He almost blushes at the scent of lust wafting off of the Captain. "Yes," Steve finally manages. "That was...adequate." He tries to keep his face serious, but Tony can tell he's about
And that got right under Steve's skin; he didn't know when exactly Nebula had found out, but he figured it had been before Steve had. Anger mixed with shame in his gut unpleasantly.
"Over there," Ezekiel instructed Tony, pointing at a spot on the floor and ignoring Hammer. Tony crawled over, for once grateful to be ordered around since it gave him something to focus on that wasn't Hammer's uncontrollable laughter. "Kneel up."
"Not my strong suit," Tony quipped, almost involuntarily because it just came so easily for him, and almost regretted it when Ezekiel changed the hold he had on his neck to cut off his air supply.
Rick seems content with that. He's clearly aware that something has changed in the captain's behaviour, and Tony's sure that Rick knows it's because of the mark on Tony's face. Because what else could it be about?
Tony was tempted to take the Thor-sized dose and was even scooping them up, but he thought of Steve and stopped.
Tony did not want to hear Agent Carlton die again, and he didn’t want to expose Thor to the awful whispering.
Tony soon saw he’d been grappling with only one end of the monster, and that his shot with the canon would likely have been wasted.
So I am thinking in writing a series of one shots, I have lot of ideas about Tony and Steve and I can't just wait to write them, so I will write them here, they all are going to be kind of short stories, and If i want to continue them I am just going to continue them here with the same name as the story.
And with a scream from Steve’s lips, Captain America saw the last moments of The invincible Iron man, it wasn’t painful, he had just disappeared.
“Pepper” said Edward with a nonchalant gesture “my beautiful pepper, pepperony, love of my life, can you please tell me why am I here? I am busy man you see, I really need to get the fuck out of here”
“Just… take care of yourself” Pepper kissed him on the cheek and left the room. The door closed and Edward spoke.
That was the Stark tower after all, the first place where The Avengers become a family, the first home they had… where Tony used to live.
“Yeah, of course I could bring you your electric razor but it will be difficult for you to use it in this state. I could help you”
The Sokovia Accords were the second, the fucking Sokovia Accords that Rogers refused to sign, the accords that eventually leaded to the destruction of the Avengers and the destruction of their relationship, those motherfuckers.
Steve, Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey, Thor and Shuri were trying to bring together other heroes from all over the world to fight alongside.
-let’s began- Steve got up from the couch –We don’t know when are Lady Death and her Knight going to arrive right? I don’t want to commit the same mistake I did with Thanos, this time… we are going to be prepared, this time we… we are not going to lose anyone-
-There are rumors, in the underworld- Everyone in the room pay attention to Loki- that a knight, the right hand of lady dead will be the first to touch earth, I don’t know why but I know that when the dead itself is involved is not for a good cause-
“The surgery was difficult; your chest is still tender. You will not have to do any kind of exercises or strenuous activities at least in the next six months”
And I forgot the best part, you fell in love with Rogers, you two actually had sex, who would have thought that the star spangled man had it in him um?
Pity he wasn’t there when the fight occurred, oh it would have been perfect, with Barnes without his arm lying on the floor, unconscious while Edward took charge of the situation, hitting Steve until blood came out of his now broken nose, with glassy eyes and broken bones, he would have fell down to the floor, he would have crawled and begged for mercy.
-Why blood?- Steve asked while Loki made appear out of thin air a dagger, he used it to cut in the middle of his palm and knelt to draw a strange symbol.
Edward laid down on the couch, running his fingers through his now much longer chocolate locks of  hair.
-Where is Tony?- Rhodey got close limping. Besides him, Peter Parker followed close with a dreadful face.
The meeting took place at now Peppe’s Tower, with her being the host to all the heroes that were going to reunite. Everyone was sitting in the large couch in the middle of the room, an uncomfortable atmosphere could be felt around all the house as heroes arrived.
The ceiling was pure white and the odor of antiseptic was all around the room filling it up, the comforting softness underneath his back instantly told him that he wasn’t in the Siberian bunker anymore.
He didn’t eve could entertain himself watching television,  all that was in that shitty (Non-stark) device was news about the rogue Avengers whereabouts, the civil war and fans’ cringey videos about Captain Assmerica.
“Yes, Mister Stark you can go, we have to do some checks up at least every two or three months but apart from that you can go”
-Let us be the judges of that- Wanda said touching in reassurance Vision’s arm –What is your hypothesis?-
-We are going to have to call a fucking zombie?- Clint crossed his arms, Bruce moved uncomfortably in his seat- I am not getting it-
-Oh god- he said with grief and sorrow while touching the infinity gauntlet that just a moment ago, was in Tony’s hands. –Oh god- he repeated trembling.
Panic shocked trough his body, the fear drowning his bones. The beep of the machine next to him began making frantic noises. However, the only sound that he could hear was his bones breaking as the shield pierced his chest.
“There was a lot of blood, all your face and your chest were covered in blood; I was scared I thought I had lost you”
Five years passed, Steve settled in an apartment, Bucky decided to live apart from him, Clint divorced, Natasha reappeared now with his red hair back and a few new wrinkles around her eyes and mouth, Bruce won a nobel for his studies in magic and science, Rhodey was still in the military and Thor was the King of Asgard with Loki as his strategist and sometimes adviser.
Steve slips just one finger in to the first knuckle, tonguing at Tony's cock as he does, and waits for Tony to get used to the feeling.
Tony grins, comes around the desk to wrap Rhodey in a hug. He can't help but think about the hug he'd shared with Steve. Coincidentally, the hug he'd received for fixing the oven, which was why Tony had missed that meeting in the first place.
Tony presses up, pushes up onto his knees and hitches a leg up and over Steve's lap so he can straddle the other man. Steve groans and kisses Tony more fervently as Tony sits on his lap. Tony shifts forward, feels the answering beginnings of arousal at Steve's groin, and lets out a low moan of his own as he lets his blunt nails scrape down Steve's chest.
The suit retracts, and Tony slides his hand inside the gauntlet. He immediately feels all the power of the four stones at his fingertips, and it's almost more than he can handle – would be more than he can handle if the gauntlet weren't focusing that power and containing it. He raises his hand at Thanos as though he were about to fire a repulsor blast. He won't be able to control the power once he releases it, he's just going to be a conduit and nothing more. It's more than he'll be able to take, but the realisation leaves him remarkably calm. He'll die out here, defending the world, defending the universe. He'll die, but it will mean something. It won't be dying in a cold cave because he couldn't fight back. It won't be dying of palladium poisoning because he couldn't find a solution to the problem. It won't be living through this mess while someone else dies for him. No, he's okay with going out like this.
Steve sees the questions warring in Tony's face as he tries to decide what to ask first. He must want to know so much –
"No, Tony, you can't just 'not,'" Pepper tells him with extraordinary patience. "This is a huge R&D project for us and the clean energy initiative, and it's going to be an incredible benefit if this partnership works out. They need you, and they need your brain. It has to be you Tony, and he's flying out tomorrow."
Steve's lips are smooth and dry, and it's a chaste kiss, by all measurements. Steve's lips slide against his for just a moment, and Tony is paralyzed. Is Steve really
"And then the Time stone," he gestured to his amulet, "and the Mind stone." He waved a hand in Vision's direction.
"Speak of the devilishly handsome," Tony says, not moving from his spot half-behind the oven. "Steve, can you answer it and put it on speaker for me, I think I've almost got this panel open, and it's Rhodey, so…"
to run into each other, well, wouldn’t that just be a coincidence? “She did, however, mention that you were thinking of moving out of the tower.”
He explains the situation, tells Evan he can lock up until someone else comes in to help. Evan nods and goes back to work, so Steve heads back to Bucky, who's just finishing up on the phone with Clint.
Tony stops suddenly, still, breathing hard. Steve realizes what he's said, wants to smack himself. He'd decided he wouldn't push Tony, would be here to help him and not pressure him, and within two minutes of the man being conscious, he's already broken his own promise.
He drags himself to his feet, and he has to bite viciously down on the inside of his cheek in order to keep from screaming when he puts weight on his knee, but it doesn't matter. He doesn't care – pain is secondary.
But before Tony can say much more, the cell phone Steve's still holding onto starts blaring, and it's Metallica's 'Master of Puppets' screaming from the speaker. He almost drops it, he's so surprised by the sudden buzzing guitar.
"Tony..." Steve says, stepping forward so they're closer. There's so much behind that one word. So much pain, and longing. Maybe Rhodey's right. Maybe they do need to talk while they still have a chance.
Steve blinks and watches for a second as Bucky waits for Natasha to pick up the phone. Bucky makes an impatient gesture with his hand, and Steve steels himself. He doesn't have time to fall apart right now, and he knows it. What's important is Casey.
"Oh," Tony says. Like he's not sure what Steve means. Like the praise makes him uncomfortable. "Is everyone else…?"
"You met me at the airport, and you brought me flowers and chocolate." Steve is staring at him in that way he always does when he can't believe how amazing Tony is. For a long time, Tony hated that look. It felt wrong, like Steve didn't mean it, or only thought he was amazing because he wasn't seeing the whole picture. But these days, Tony loves that look, he loves being the object of Steve's wonder and attention, and he loves feeling... well, loved. It was weird. But nice.
They're just friends, and he keeps telling Bucky that, but that doesn't mean he doesn't notice how handsome Tony is, how funny and smart and acerbic, how brilliant and good-hearted and what a great dad. He can't
Coulson steps back into the room just as Steve is about to hit critical mass and asks, “Is there anything I can get for you, Captain Rogers?”
They don't have their own website, but they do have a Facebook page. Tony browses it – mostly, it's photos of coffee and pastries. The latte art is impressive – Tony's not sure he's ever seen such skill. Every few days, there's a ridiculous meme about coffee, or some sort of pun, and it makes Tony want to grind his teeth.
Steve flushes again and internally curses his pasty skin. "No. We didn't – there's nothing to sort out."
When he reaches Tony's side, he's started seizing, his whole body convulsing. Thor is there, too, and he tears the glove off of Tony's hand. The convulsing stops, and Tony is eerily still. He's in the armour, so Steve can't see his face or check his vitals, but he won't let that stop him.
Tony's hand moves faster, stroking his cock harder even as the other hand drops to cradle his balls.
He realizes he's a little wired from the coffee, so he cues his tablet up to the NannyCam app he'd created, and watches the feed from Casey's room for a few minutes, as Casey sleeps. He's still, but Tony can see the rise and fall of his little pyjama-clad chest. He knows he's got a soft smile on his face, and he knows he's a ridiculously sappy dope, but he doesn't care.
"You make that threat a lot," Steve comments as he pours a large cup of fresh brew and slides it over to Tony. "Fortunately for me, I know how to stay in your good graces." His point is proven as Tony takes a sip and sighs happily. Steve smirks to himself. He makes a damned good cup of coffee, and he knows it.
"No buts," Tony insists. "Please. Go. Both of you. Strange is already there. If we don't keep Vision safe then all of this, every last bit of it, will have been for nothing." Wanda nods and takes Vision's hand. Together, they fly back towards the palace. Tony swallows hard and turns his attention back to the battle. In the few short minutes since Thanos stepped onto the field, the tables have turned, and definitely not in their favour. Tony momentarily forgets to breathe at the sight of the Mad Titan striding his way across the battleground. A wave of warriors charges him, but a flick of his wrist sends them flying back as though they all weighed less than a pile of leaves.
Except the phone in his hand buzzes angrily, and he jumps, almost drops it again and glances at the screen. It's lighting up with notifications, that Tony has a text message from Rhodey, then another and another, and Tony shakes his head, plucking the phone from Steve's lax grip. Right.
," Casey squeals into his ear, and even as Tony winces at the volume, he thrills in the sound of it. This is his boy.
He feels even more like a failure when he drops Casey off at school, and instead of running off to play after giving Tony his customary hug and kiss goodbye, he stays and looks up at his dad seriously.
was a sarcastic remark. The fact that he hadn't gotten one is only further evidence of how terrified Tony is right now.
Bucky looks wary, suddenly. He leans back in his chair, resting his spoon on the side of his bowl. "How so?" he asks carefully.
The day after the accident, Stark doesn't come into the shop at all, which is kind of weird, because Bucky was under the impression that Tony came in every damned day. Sometimes multiple times a day. He's also pretty certain Nat had mentioned something about Tony and Rhodes having a daily 'BFF' work meeting, every day at 9am. But 9am comes and goes, with no sign of Stark or Rhodes. At ten past nine, Steve glances up at the clock, sighs, and mumbles something about needing to go do something in the back.
It takes an incredible amount of restraint to not run over before the ground crew give him the all clear. The steps lower, and there, standing at the top just inside the plane is his Steve, tall and strong and perfect. It takes only half a second for Steve to notice him standing there on the tarmac, and Tony watches his expression flicker to surprise, and then pure joy.
"You've been – we've all been through a lot," Steve starts, trying to find a way to backtrack without making Tony feel as though Steve doesn't want him. "I don't want to – to put any pressure on you. You shouldn't have to think about that, about me, right now."
“Honestly, I don’t know. I mean, I just watched you beat up bad guys stark naked, and I gotta admit that’s definitely going to fuel more than one fantasy, so really, I’m kind of hoping to take you home and do very inappropriate things to you. Repeatedly. In several different ways.”
Steve turned to look at him finally, and although his face remained neutral his eyes still read anger, confusion, and hurt.
From the number of pills, it had been Thor; he cared nothing about dosing and always just dumped out a generous handful.
Another soaking spray of disinfectant began and two sets of heavy doors clanked shut between them and sealed.
Black tentacles began probing at the eye slits and seals and Tony lost visual and auditory communication with his team as his armor activated various defense systems against it.
Tony caught him in his arms and the propulsion system whined with the added strain, but he brought them both to the ground.
The leering face of the black goat shot past behind Thor’s back, filling Tony’s sight for one last moment before lightning ripped her and her blasphemous throng apart and hurled them into the depths along with tons of stone and coal and brittle human bones.
His own limbs felt heavy and clumsy, and only his right arm still felt like it even belonged to him.
He wanted to blame the moonlight, or the blue tint from his visor, but Tony could still tell that all the fluid was too dark, and too thick.
He fiddled with his suit instead, checking the power levels and the range of motion after the fight in the cavern.
The familiar turquoise tint made him feel better, as did the display of readouts telling him that Steve was unhurt, though he did have an elevated pulse.
A fine, cold mist of antiseptic surrounded them, and even though the filters in suit made it impossible, Tony felt like he could taste it at the back of his throat.
The crack of the rifle behind them startled them both, and in the long heartbeat of silence that followed they both heard the wet thump of a body hitting wood.
“I have something to show you,” she said, and though it might have been the start of the illness taking hold of her, she sounded worse than sick to Tony.
He paused and looked behind him, up the shadowy stairwell and around the room, as though he heard something.
They didn’t speak much at all as they made their way through the chuckling woods of Old Crow Mountain and down into the twice-abandoned mine.
He hated turning pages with the gauntlets on, but it seemed Machen had been as old school as everything else around here.
He looked tired and ill, and Tony wanted more than anything to find him somewhere to lie down in the Clean Zone, to take care of him as Thor had done so many nights, but they had no time and Thor would not have welcomed it.
His skin was pink from the shower and Tony found his concentration had instantly switched from calibrating the communicators to checking Steve for any sign of illness.
Thor scanned the trees and looked over his shoulder every few moments, and three times he paused so long to listen to the low rustle and drip of the mountain that Steve and Tony had to stop and wait for him to catch up.
The bald trees they passed were still veiled in heavy gray fog and the light that filtered through the dim white sky did little to burn it off.
Unable to see, hear, smell or even breathe, he still felt the portal pulling him in, ready to enfold him in the endless, godless dark of Mother’s realm, his own life and will no more significant than a candle flame at the bottom of the ocean.
Half a dozen modern vehicles, all black and unmarked, sat parked in the lot, but on inspection they were configured to hold cargo or equipment, but empty and abandoned.
Thor wasn’t big on relationship advice, mostly providing a sympathetic ear and a steady supply of alcohol, but he’d been right last night when he finally put one heavy hand on Tony’s shoulder and told him, “You tell me all the things you ought to tell Steve.”
It seems like it was a real scandal that he converted the natives and encouraged people to intermarry with them.”
In fact I rather hope word doesn’t get round or I’ll have all manner of charlatans and archaeologists bumbling around.
But most of the other shareholders chose to stay away from the town of Crows, and they were constantly bringing in new crews to work the mine.
He heard his mother’s voice calling his name, far away and faint as a memory, and he struggled harder, thrashing in vain with the tiny bit of strength he had left.
At this, Steve and Tony turned their heads to look at each other so fast that Tony’s armor made a tiny whir of protest.
His team had had over a dozen researchers and assistants, Tony knew, and he still had no way of knowing how many were down here in the dark, but he knew they were about to find out.
Tony took off to fly a few loops around the site, irritated at every single one of these scientists and Fury because he didn’t have time for this.
He sucked in a last mouthful of air as the vile fluid filled his nose and eyes and felt nothing except the animal will to survive, a stubborn refusal to surrender in her grip.
Steve had gone to wash the worst of the gore off, and Tony hadn’t been brave enough to offer to join him in the showers.
The look in her eye said Tony should not ask for the details, any more than he wanted to talk about what had happened at the Buckman’s house.
Though it seemed like for every one he severed, two more appeared, Tony freed one of Thor’s arms before he and Steve were overwhelmed.
Tony turned to the main computer and queued up the first entry he’d downloaded from Carlton’s recorder.
Water dripped off his body onto the floor and the upstairs phone jangled loud and discordant in the quiet house.
They went to the decrepit Company Store and Tony was surprised the rotten front steps would even hold him, much less the massive thunder god.
They each had more blankets than he remembered, and Thor watched over them with sunken, bruised looking eyes.
A modern sign outside the door said it was the Crow Mountain Congregation of the Old Ways, and the remaining letters of its announcement section seemed to promise a fish fry in honor of the ascension of the Blessed Alhazred, whoever that was, but it sat on a weathered hump of stone the same odd off-green color as the church and streaked with dark inclusions of coal.
He’d never tested for more than eight hours without exchanging the air, at least. “See what Fury says before we argue about it anymore.”
Tony could see now that the darkness of the portal was even greater than the lightless space beneath the earth, untouched by any light.
He faced his repulsors into the dark, and to his side he saw the flickering light of Mjolnir as Thor stood against the great crevasse at their back.
I came back to warn you, you son of a bitch, in case She can use him like She did with all the others.”
“Every gentleman should have a handkerchief,” Steve said. He wiped the sweat from his pale forehead and returned the cloth to his mouth.
The darkness and silence was so sudden and absolute that he thought for the space between his breaths and heartbeats that he had died, and he heard his mother calling him in for lunch.
Steve drags a hand over his face before sighing, and he seems to forcefully will his muscles to relax.
Ezekiel looked down at Tony with unveiled disdain. "Is everything prepared?" he asked Hammer, in lieu of answering his question.
"'S good," Rose replies absently, too occupied with inhaling the dessert to properly articulate. Tony sighs amusedly and brushes the kid's cheek with his napkin. The dessert is all over her face.
"Clint," Natasha says again, this time more forcefully, a little bit of her alpha mojo coloring her voice. It makes the beta deflate slightly, and he lets out an angry puff of air.
Ezekiel placed his free hand on Tony's left shoulder, over the spot he had struck three times, and squeezed. Tony whimpered, trying to pull away from the hand, and the tears he had been trying to hold back slipped down his cheeks.
Ezekiel made a non-committal sound, eyeing Tony's form up and down. Tony knew he must have looked awfully pathetic there where he stood, the bruises and cuts on his arms and face on display, his clothes ill-fitting and dusty from the basement and his skin pale and his eyes dull with exhaustion. He knew all that and felt impossibly conscious of it, but stubbornly refused to give into the temptation to shrink into himself.
Tony Stark, the most talkative omega known to the public -- nonverbal, when his alpha fucks him into oblivion.
"Hi, pup," Rick greets Rosie back, crouching down to pick their girl up in his free arm and planting a kiss to her forehead. She wounds her thin hands around Rick's neck and buries her nose in the crook of her Father's neck, scenting. Tony wonders how in the hell she manages that, with all the expensive-ass alpha scent enhancing colognes Rick continuously douses himself with, but there the toddler goes, once again, amazing him. Maybe she has some kind of a superpower. Or, maybe it's just Tony that has a problem with the smell.
Tony thought that his newfound infertility was due to the god knows what substances he'd been consuming in form of the heavy and cloaking suppressants that Howard had him on, or had something to do with the fact that Tony had been late to present and late in the development of his reproductive organs. Or maybe it was just the stress, or maybe it ran in the family. Maria's pregnancy hadn't been an easy feat either.
"Yeah," he replies and pushes the cup towards the alpha's chin, until he takes the hint and gulps down some water.
He watched as Becker brought his hands up to his ears, covering them tightly, and a familiar high-pitched whine entered Tony's own. His finger seized on the trigger and his muscles locked before slackening, and he fell sideways. The sound stopped as soon as it had started, only partially stunning him.
"Shut the hell up," he growled, keeping steady pressure on Tony's throat. "You know it's true. They can't stand the sight of you. Not your parents, not your friends, not even your beloved Avengers." He released Tony, who erupted into a coughing fit.
"No!" Tony gritted through his teeth, unwilling to go through with being restrained again. He fought against Bates and the bodyguard, making it hard for her to slip the cuff over his wrist. He growled and tried to push himself away from the pillar while Bates crowded him against it. When she finally managed to buckle the cuff, she took hold of his other hand and Bates held fast onto the cuffed one.
"Daddy, why do you have a boo boo here?" she asks, pointing at her own cheek. Tony's fingers cease their movement and he twists his neck to the side to look at his girl. One of the things he most hates in the world is lying to Rosie, and it pains him that he still sometimes has to. For example on occasions like this.
"Steve, relax. I'm not rushing into a fight, I'm just making sure these people get the fuck out of here. You're almost here, anyway."
He had remained in the middle of the room while Bates had left, leisurely fixing his collar and sleeves. Today, in addition to his discarded jacket, he had rolled up his sleeves and removed his tie, when yesterday he had been in a such a hurry to get his hands on Tony it didn't have seemed to matter. Tony hoped it meant that he had gotten the worst of it out of his system.
"Get the hell away from me," Tony told him, scrambling back as fast as he could, but Marco reached him easily enough. He grabbed Tony by the front of his shirt and lifted a little, pulling Tony back so that his side was against the end of one of the twin beds.
Tony rolls his eyes, exasperated, and listens to Rose's gasp. "Daddy," she whines. "Please, don't sulk."
Tony tried to hold the shame that flooded his system at bay, because he knew that shaming him was exactly what Ezekiel was aiming for, but he couldn't. He just couldn't, and the age-old burn of embarrassment flared from somewhere deep within his gut, traveling across his body all the way to his extremities. He could hear Howard's voice in his ears, comparing him to Steve, mocking him, and all those others that had come and gone along the years, commenting on his worthiness and lack thereof to stand next to Captain America or on his position against him regarding the Accords. He could hear himself there with all of them, questioning himself and his choices.
However, once Tony saw the look on the taller man's face, embarrassment flooded him again as he understood. Ezekiel had uncuffed his hands — he wanted Tony to
At the tower, he gets a few curious looks from the team, and after promising Rosie they'll go see Cap the next day, goes to take a shower to wash off the alpha's scent from his skin.
"Because I'm not good enough," Tony admitted. It was painful to say, but somehow a relief as well — like he was confessing his sins to a higher authority, and finally being dealt with the consequences of his actions.
He sat up on the floor around the pillar, groaning at the excruciating case of pins and needles in his arms as his nerves decompressed, and was distracted long enough for Bates to pull up a chair and sit down on it in front of him.
Frustration made him struggle harder and he tried to wiggle his way up the pole — if he could just slide the chain off the hook he might have a chance at escaping.
"Fine. Thanks. Did this little terror behave herself today?" He jostles the girl latched around his neck, causing her to giggle and latch onto him even tighter. Not counting in the short orientation day, this was only Rosie's second day at preschool and the morning hadn't been particularly easy; Rosie had cried and screamed at the thought of separating from her parent and staying with these still new and strange people for another full day, which, while a totally normal reaction from a toddler, had been a nerve-wracking and anxiety inducing moment for Tony as well.
"Dina," he said and the assistant twitched. "Fetch Stark a glass of water and a plate of something to eat. He has earned it."
Tony thought venomously, but couldn't bring himself to say out loud. His jaw had refused to budge from its clenched position ever since he had heard the car driving into the front yard.
Tony hid his wince at Ezekiel's words; he had hit home, right where Tony's biggest insecurities and guilt lay. And Tony was determined to not let him know that.
"Good afternoon, Omega Stark," he says and Tony smiles at the use of 'Stark' instead of 'Darrow' that he sometimes gets.
Hammer cleared his throat and Tony reluctantly shifted his attention to him. He lifted his cup. "So," he begun as Bates walked over and poured some coffee into the cup. It was piping hot and smelled heavenly.
Finally, we've got some fluff and Tony being happy for once *_* Gotta warn you, though, Rick's coming back home next chapter..... :P boo
"That's right," Ezekiel confirmed, "You're a selfish, narcissistic, conceited excuse of a human. You are a murderer with blood of the innocent on your hands. Not one soul could ever love you."
Hammer chuckled, but he did seem a little flustered. He was quick to recover, however. "Yeah, big words for such a small guy. We'll see if you'll manage to get to the door in here," he said. Tony wanted to punch him.
"So, how does it feel?" the man asked, turning around. "How does it feel to know you're a disappointment even to your greatest hero, Captain America?"
The man crouched in front of him and unclipped the chain from one of Tony's cuffs, twisting the other end securely into the palm of his hand and holding onto it.
Tony eyed the porcelain cups and plates on the table. "To the door," he said, choosing to leave out the fact that he had gotten his hands on a gun. Let them underestimate him. Marco and Becker wouldn't squeal, since it had been their incompetence in the first place that had enabled Tony to get as far as pressing a barrel against Marco's head. They wouldn't tell a soul if they knew what was good for them. Something told Tony Bates wouldn't be very forgiving, to say the least.
Steve would be so disappointed were he to see him right now. All those hand-to-hand combat lessons, and here he still was. Lying on the ground like an upturned tortoise.
Tony couldn't hold in his scoff. "And you're...what? Taking revenge twelve years later? Come on, Zeke. I know you and Obie were never that close, but twelve ye—"
Apart from the small amount of blood smudged on one of the bed legs, Jim couldn't have even told that Tony had been in the motel room. The site was clean and didn't hold any evidence other than the blood. There weren't any witnesses.
That got him the man's attention. He looked up into his eyes, slowly straightening up into his full height so he could tower over Tony. His hands came up to his throat and Tony mentally prepared himself for another choking, his pulse accelerating. But Boss' hands stopped by his bow tie, slowly,
In lieu of answering, Tony squeezed his eyes shut and leaned forward, planting his hands to the floor. He heaved his tired legs up so that he was on all fours, holding back a groan. He felt himself flush furiously.
sending his half-empty coffee mug clattering, not shattering, thank god, against the counter, probably scaring the crap out of the other three as he did. Clint and Steve were staring at him with wide eyes, the latter's hand still slightly extended towards Tony, and Natasha had a somewhat grim but a knowing look on her face.
Over the little under three years since that moment in the Stark family manor living room, they had met many times in galas and festivities where they'd been made to pair up because of their now official engagement. Tony even had a diamond ring as a proof of that, although he only wore it if he was expected to attend some public or formal events because of his family name. Anyway, the relationship between Tony and Rick hadn't warmed up any since Tony was sixteen, even though they were now used to pretending the happy couple that everyone expected to see (even if they already knew that wasn't really the case).
Becker followed him down, straddling his abdomen and taking a hold of his cuffed hands again. Tony opened his mouth to shout, but Becker's meaty hand landed on his face, instantly shutting him up.
Tony smiles crookedly at him. "I don't mind, Capsicle," that was a nickname he'd made up for the soldier one week ago, "you can ask that. It's nice to have someone else looking after Rosie too." Rogers blushes at that and, christ, isn't that adorable. "And she's holding up okay, I guess. She's used to it, and I try to compensate since I can do most of my work from home. She's though as nails."
"Maybe he is, maybe he's not. You, for sure, are not." The doubt in Tony's mind that had been niggling at him for years now seemed to be inclined to agree. Tony shut it right up, focusing on Ezekiel shaking his head at him. "Do you seriously expect me to believe all of that was a coincidence? That aliens, that that
, Tony, get that! Maria can't give birth to any more children, carrying you was hard enough for her. You know that, Tony. You were our only shot!"
"I—" He has to pause to swallow again. "I want to learn everything I would if I were an alpha," he answers truthfully. His Father's expression doesn't change one inch.
The wedding ceremony itself was long and dull as the priest rambled on about marriage and love and respect and the hierarchy of alphas, betas and omegas in society and in homes. The audience sang a few hymns in between the pauses the priest made, and Tony was made to stand there in front of everyone, facing Rick.
It was a little over four months after that, Rose turning three and Tony turning forty-three, half a month after the fall of SHIELD, when the Avengers finally began, one by one, moving into the Avengers Tower. Tony was probably too enthusiastic about it, but it payed off when he got to see the awe on his teammates' faces when he showed them their personalized floors that his enthusiasm had caused him to design. He'd also added a common floor and a gym, so that they'd have some boding time every once in awhile. And working out was important, or so he'd heard.
"I was thinking I'd take a day off today, go somewhere with Rosie. It's been awhile. Wanna tag along, Barton, that why you asking?"
Steve squeezes his neck, and even though Tony has for so long associated the action with Rick's intimidating, possessive or rage-fueled attempts of getting Tony to submit, now the feel of a palm touching him there fills him with heat from head to toe. He goes slack, a soft groan escaping his mouth, and
"That's way too long. I'm gonna have to break into SHIELD. Again," he says distractedly, ignoring Steve's lecturing.
Bates looked at him, then pulled on the chain to get him to move. And Tony was hardly to blame — it was almost instinctual — for using the momentum and striking Bates' hand off the chain with his palm. Bates' other hand was already halfway up by that point, but Tony had been expecting it and deflected it was easy. He managed to dodge one more grab by leaning away, before Bates planted a hand in the middle of his chest and slammed him down to the floor.
Ezekiel chuckled, letting go of Tony's hair and continuing with his pacing. "Is that why she left you? Or, why he spends all his time across the world, away from you, risking his life? Or, why your parents shipped you off to boarding school? Because they
"I was just messing with him," Becker said, his voice hoarse, "I knew a snob like him would get freaked out by it." To top it off, he smacked Tony on the ass with an open palm this time. Tony jerked at the impact, but didn't otherwise react.
"But I know tons of alphas!" he says somewhat desperately. He twists his head to glance at Steve. They are walking along a hallway of a SHIELD facility, and the bright overhead lights form dark shadows that accentuate Steve's features. "When did Fury say I would get access to the files HYDRA kept in the base?"
Dr. Miller smiled again, this time a little condescendingly. "I don't know what you're talking about."
Despite the warm temperature in the dining room, Tony could feel himself going cold again. "You're not suggesting what I think you are. Because it's not gonna happen."
They step into the elevator in silence, and Tony somehow feels like a dick all of the sudden. Bruce draws in a heavy breath, and Tony already knows what's coming.
Steve looked back through the window, a blank expression plastered on his face. Natasha was holding onto Dr. Miller's hair now, playing with her knife against her skin.
"That wasn't the case this morning, if memory serves," Becker interjected, throwing a disdainful look in Tony's way.
It was pointless; with his arms above him, chained around the pillar he could hardly move, much less escape from Ezekiel.
"Can you have FRIDAY send the location of the scene to the compound? To the team," Steve asked, eyes glued to the box and its contents. "Natasha and Bucky are going through CCTV footage to identify the perpetrators or maybe catch a licence plate. They could look through the train yard's cameras as well, see if there's anything useful there."
The doctor frowned at him like he was but a misbehaving kid. "That won't do, Mr. Stark. I'm afraid I'm going to have to remove all that, be it with or without your help."
Tony is frustrated to say the least, but he does know why doing it this way is necessary. And necessary it
"Kind of," Rick replies, shrugging and walking past Tony to place his briefcase on a side table by the wall. His hands move up to loosen his tie. "R&D messed something up again, but the new tech lead got it under control. Also, now that I remember; you'll need to review and sign a few papers by tomorrow evening. We need to send them along by the day after that. You were in that meeting about it, right?"
"And you won't get a chance to pull any of your shit again, you hear me? If you even consider it, I'll make you regret it."
sign that damn deal we've been trying to get for god knows how many months. We pulled an all-nighter so we could discuss the terms in-depth." He scrubs a hand over his face. "I'm exhausted, thanks to that."
"Oh, Ezekiel, please," Hammer drawled. He sounded carefree enough, but Tony could tell he was treading on thin ice. "We're all adults here, aren't we? Surely we can finish this food together before it goes cold."
He took the glass and eyed its contents. He glanced at Ezekiel, who seemed to be studying him. Not wanting to seem suspicious, he averted his eyes, then downed the whole glass.
It's about half an hour later when Steve reappears with plates of something with too much vegetables that still somehow smells mouth-watering. He sits down with them, and they eat while discussing softly, with bouts of companionable silence in between.
"Tony, hey," the alpha stops him, taking a hold of his shoulders and turning him so that they are facing each other. He has to bend slightly at the waist, since Tony is that much shorter than him. "You're getting way too hung up in this. That man was HYDRA. He could've said that just to mess with you."
They had been driving for the better part of an hour when the car finally stopped moving. Or, at least that was the amount of time that Tony was aware of, since that was since he'd woken up — they had probably been on the road for a lot longer than that.
, Tony almost protested, but held his tongue — his shoulder was still throbbing something awful. Whatever, it would have sounded weak, even to his own ears. He hardly believed it himself, some days.
He snaps out of his reminiscing as Omega Dunn answers his inquiry, "Rose did very well today." He smiles warmly in the little girl's direction, and Tony can't help but join in. "We all did crafts together and learned about some plants. Then she had playtime with the other kids. She's very bright for her age."
"Yeah, baby!" he exclaims, blasting with both of his repulsors now that the bullets have stopped for a moment. "Stay here, stay low! The others will get here soon," he instructs the people lined up behind him and gets a few fearful nods in return. He takes off running, wanting to reach the enemy before they cease being distracted by his armor. Between him and JARVIS, only about half of the unit still remains standing, but that's too much for Tony's taste.
said gruffly. Tony tried to focus on him instead of Obadiah's ghost and Steve's nagging. He was the fifth man of the bunch, as far as Tony could tell. "The paralysis is only temporary and we need to get moving, fast."
"Get your hands off of me," Tony demanded, struggling against his hold when Becker turned him over onto his stomach. A knee planted itself into Tony's lower back, and Tony heard Becker unbuckling his belt. His breath caught and he began struggling with new vehemence.
Tony tried not to think about wearing underwear supplied by Hammer as he pulled the briefs on. Still, it was better than going commando and anything would help with keeping him warm when he was to return to the chilly basement in the end.
"You too," Tony manages, head tilting to give Steve better access. Steve kisses his throat for his troubles and Tony can't stop the groan from escaping his lips. The hand Steve had politely kept by Tony's back inches lower, resting just above the curve of Tony's ass. "Oh, yes," Tony agrees, one hand bunching up Steve's shirt and the other twisting in his blond hair.
"Noted," Rick replies and turns to look at Tony, leaning against the side table as his fingers work the first and the second button of his dress shit open. His tie has been discarded on top of the briefcase behind his back. "But let's not talk about work, shall we? It's our anniversary after all, love."
Just over three months after Rose's birth, Tony has to deal with Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer. And also, he's dying of palladium poisoning. Fuck his life.
"What are you doing here, Rick?" Tony asks, feigning impassiveness, even when in reality he feels like jumping off of the hospital bed and punching Rick in the nose for interrupting his and Rosie's moment with Steve. He hasn't seen Steve in months and for the love of god he's adult enough of an omega to admit it that yes, maybe he did miss the alpha, and no, Rick is not welcome to ruin the moment.
"You don't get to talk about him," Ezekiel told him, the hand that had struck him brandishing a finger in his face. "He was right all along, you know. I realized it only five months ago when everyone that had vanished was returned, but he was right."
of all things to Steve?" he asks softly, mindful of Rosie still in the room, watching the three adults interacting in interest from her perch in Rick's arms.
The team has been living under Tony's roof for a little over two weeks now, and the engineer is finally beginning to get accustomed to having neighbours this close to his own apartment (the closest being literally two flights of stairs down, if you didn't count the common floor). He's also starting to recognize some of his teammates' habits and routines, one being Rogers' inhumanly early morning workouts.
It's true, it's not always easy. Rick travels a lot and Tony has to stay at home with Rose, and sometimes the distance gets to him, leaving his body craving for the proximity and touch of his alpha, and reducing him to climbing into their shared bed to catch a whiff of Rick's scent. He also tends to get more emotional during those days, which Rose and her sharp senses of course take notice of, and the toddler can be quite a handful in her fussiest and crankiest state. It's purely biological and irrational, since Tony doesn't
Tony purses his lips. "Get to bed, I'll finish up here and come right after." They usually slept in their bed together after the other had been away, trying to settle their minds and scent each other after being apart. Again, a purely biological urge because of the mating bond they shared, but nevertheless a real one.
"So," Steve says when they are done loading the dishwasher. The alpha clicks the hatch closed. "You didn't tell me what you were fighting about earlier. The reason he gave you that mark on your face?"
"I'm sorry," she said. To Tony, she sounded genuine. "I'm privy to all of Mr. Stane's dealings, so my activities are monitored. He would know something is going on and move you to another location before your team could come to you. And then, he would kill me."
He straightened up again, getting right on track with his spiel, "I can't say that I'm surprised it didn't pan out, though. I don't think there's a soul on this planet that could love you."
He's successful, taking down the first agent he reaches with a hard jump punch. The alpha agent next to him starts turning and Tony grabs her semi-automatic before she can point it at him. He ducks when she swipes a hand at him and kicks her in the knees. Before she's fully down another agent, this one a beta male if Tony's nose is correct, slams his gun into the omega's back. He goes sprawling on top of the alpha, but twists as he falls and blasts the beta into the chest. It propels him away from them, and Tony is left to struggle with the alpha.
"I'm not going to repeat myself, Tony. Either the necklace now or after you've made Rose cry her eyes out."
"Yes, Mom," he replied with a dry tone and watched as Marco lay down on top of the bed covers. He turned to his side and Tony craned his head to look at Becker. His pale eyes were already on Tony.
"Don't you think Captain America would have already come and saved your pathetic self, did he care at all about you?" Ezekiel pulled him closer, all the way until Tony's neck was straining. "Would he have left you for dead if he cared about you?"
Now we got that Tony whump...I hope you enjoyed the chapter. I promise things will get better for Tony eventually. Leave a comment! :)
For the remainder of the dinner, he tried to keep from inhaling the plate of food he had been given so he wouldn't make himself sick later. He ate slowly and drank the water when Dina refilled his glass.
Tony agreed; his belly ached from hunger and the tremors from low blood sugar were getting harder and harder to conceal, especially in his left hand. But he didn't trust Hammer enough to eat anything from his table, at least nothing he hadn't seen the other man try first. Tony didn't put it past the guy to try and drug him this early on.
"You're gonna regret that, as well as all the other shit you've pulled so far," he growled, yanking Tony out of the car. He fell to the asphalt below, upper back colliding painfully with the exterior of the car.
Hammer tutted at him, letting his hand drop off of his shoulder. "Come on now, Anthony. I know you're tired and hungry. The quicker we're done here, the quicker you'll get your reward."
The ceremony had ended with him and Rick exchanging rings and sharing a kiss on the altar, and then another hymn beginning as they walked out of the church along the aisle. Then it was time for the festivities, which were held in the ballroom of the Stark Mansion, where Tony listened to countless congratulations from the guests and to almost as much unwanted tips for life in marriage from other mated omegas attending the wedding. When one overly enthusiastic omega lady begun giving him tips on how to please his mate in bed and a younger male omega by his other ear tried to apply them to sex between two dudes, he felt like throwing up. He politely excused himself and went to get another flute of champagne from the waiter.
. Tony can't believe that he's questioning his current opinion on the world's most infuriating person — and no, it's not Rick. Rick is the person he hates the most in the world — because, dear lord, does Rogers manage to wind him up.
Rick answers by pushing a couple of fingers inside him. Tony's whole body jerks, and then he lets out an obscene moan when Rick's clever fingers find his prostate. He keeps the assault going all the way until Tony's a quivering, whimpering mess, his body basically begging to be taken by his mate. The scent of alpha, his own slick, and his and Rick's arousal in the air are almost overwhelming, and the feeling causes disgusted and desperate tears to make their way to Tony's eyes.
"Nothing useful," Steve muttered darkly, eyes turning back towards the interrogation room. "You guys get matches for the prints yet?"
Tony frowns at the question, confused that somebody's asking. "I don't mind it," he replies finally, deliberately leaving out that he actually prefers Rick being out of town rather than at home. The only thing he regrets about that is Rose seeing her Father less often. Rogers presses on,
Rogers huffs at him. "I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. And I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself." And,
"Noted." Tony can practically feel Rick rolling his eyes at him, but he doesn't mind it since two strong hands start massaging his sore neck in an attempt to alleviate the stress along with the tightly coiled muscles.
Jim watched as Steve peered carefully into the box. He had carefully scanned everything at the scene, recording all with FRIDAY's cameras and sensors to inspect later in greater detail. He had bagged the evidence — Tony's phone, glasses and some discarded articles of clothing — and taken them with him, so the forensics could look them over.
"Not feeling up to it?" he asked as he walked over, taunting him. "Too bad. You should have thought of that when you turned down my offer.
Finally, the part that everyone — except Tony — had been eagerly waiting for came. "Do you, Alpha Richard Terrence Darrow, take Omega Anthony Edward Stark to be your lawfully wedded mate, and promise to protect him and to provide for him, in good times and in bad, until death do you part?"
"He's early," Hammer was saying when he tuned back into reality. He was eyeing his wristwatch, an annoyed frown etched between his eyebrows. He stood up, meeting Tony's gaze as he straightened out his suit. "He must be eager to see you again, hm?"
He leans back and let's the computer load the data in peace, eyeing the progress bar on one of the monitors. Perhaps he can find something when he looks over all of this back at the Tower. Maybe it'll make sense then.
After a moment, the clock ticking past 12 PM, Rick pulls back. "I brought something for you. A souvenir, if you will," he says, pulling a small box from his pocket. They sometimes gave small (or not so small) gifts to each other, ranging from objects riddled with derogatory double-meanings (like Rick spitefully ordering Tony a S&M kit one Christmas or Tony giving Rick a packet of Viagra for his 40th birthday in front of his parents and his three siblings) to actual gifts, usually on the expensive side (like Rick buying Tony another car for his 35th birthday or Tony getting Rick diamond cufflinks for one of their foundations' charity galas that they'd hosted together last year). What can he say, they were a real messed up couple.
So, they went through the guests again to say goodbye to everyone as a newly-wed couple, getting suggestive looks or eyebrow wiggles for their troubles. Every wink or giggle made more and more of cold sweat pool at Tony's palms and back. Why hadn't he just taken some alpha home with him so that this wouldn't be his first time with one?
He groaned when his shoulder hit the ground painfully. "F-fuck off," he bit out, finally mostly in control of his mouth. His words slurred a little and his voice was rough, but hey, at least the message was clear.
P.S. I've explained some stuff about the timeline of my fic in the notes above, so if you're feeling confused/unsure about it after this chapter then please check my explanation out! :)
Hammer chuckled while Bates' face remained emotionless. "You could call him that. Let's just say that he owes his life to me and leave it at that. Loyal people are so hard to come by these days."
The team lands the Quinjet into the open behind the base, the cloaking still activated. There's some coverage, but the trees are tiny because of the horrible coldness and there's snow is up to Tony's thigh where he lands next to the Quinjet. The underground base is very up North, and Tony's grateful for the suit's great insulation. He pities Clint in his thin winter gear.
"No, I want to know what this is," the archer continues, not relenting. "I knew that your marriage was arranged but this? Who the hell even does agreements like this anymore?!"
He still tasked Sam and Bucky with going through the criminal databases to find a link between them. Rhodey had taken over interrogating Dr. Miller again, and after Natasha's methods, she seemed much more agreeable to speak with him.
"Could've just said you were mated," she tells him, irritated, and as she turns Tony hears a distinct sound of her uttering the word 'bitch', but he isn't hundred percent sure. His guess is confirmed though, when Rogers surges forward, his super soldier senses catching the word with ease.
Tony glanced down at the prints, then shrugged. "Not a fan, to be honest. Major design flaws. But at least that's consistent with the rest of Hammer Industries' products."
"Honestly, with the people that live in this tower I think we should have one in every room. At least once a week someone needs patching up."
"You are the scum of the earth, Tony Stark," Ezekiel finished by saying, his teeth clenched. He glared down at Tony for a moment longer, before straightening and finally taking in his surroundings; he eyed down at the table, then at Hammer, sitting there dumbly, and Bates standing behind his back. "You expect me to share the table with him?" he asked Hammer, waiting to be challenged.
"You know that Ezekiel will be back again today," Hammer drawled, his hands moving to rub at Tony's sore shoulders. Tony held back a hiss as his fingers moved past bruises and welts. "You'll need your energy if you're going to survive another session with him."
"Do you, Omega Anthony Edward Stark, take Alpha Richard Terrence Darrow to be your lawfully wedded mate, and promise to respect him and care for him, in good times and in bad, until death do you part?"
"I'll change if you go and wash off the smell of that disgusting cologne," he says as he turns to walk to his room, and Rick barks out a laugh before agreeing to Tony's condition.
"Yes, Sir," Bates replied, stepping close and scooping roasted vegetables, potatoes and beef onto Tony's plate from the containers on the table. After serving Hammer the same meal, he poured red wine into the glasses by their plates.
"Happy 24th anniversary," Rick says, opening the box and presenting Tony a beautiful golden necklace. The chain was slim and delicate and it had a small, thin plate attached to it in the middle, so that it would rest just an inch beneath the hollow between Tony's collarbones. Tony was about to wish Rick the same, although he hadn't gotten the alpha a gift, but then he took another look at the small plate. On its surface, carved with a precise and loopy font, was the name 'Richard'.
Tony shrugged. "Not really. I have been kidnapped before, I can take a guess. Money, tech, weapons, revenge, yadda yadda...What I am confused about however, is how you managed to pull it off so far. Not very like you, Hammer.
He cried out as his abused back hit the cold and hard concrete and reacted slow enough to Bates' follow-up that the larger man managed to pin him down.
and presses close to kiss the mating bite on the side of Tony's neck. "Good night, Tony." Then he leaves with a victorious chuckle, having won a round in their never-ending battle for dominance.
Tony bites his lip, but ends up nodding and quickly leaving to sit at the dining table when a thumb strokes over the skin on his shoulder. He's getting
"Yeah," he agreed and was about to continue, but furrowed his brows instead. He watched as Natasha placed a device on the surface of the door; it whirred and contorted, forming a locking mechanism near the handle. "Shit," Steve let slip.
In the end, Tony had added some security systems to the route that the breach had come through, and called it a day. Apparently, that had been a mistake. A costly one.
," Ezekiel spoke over him, "that were you and your other superhero friends allowed to roam freely, it would be the end of us."
When the alpha flashed Tony a bright smile from where he was bent over a coffee table, drawing animals with the three-year-old, the omega couldn't help the combined surge of warmth and sorrow that went right through him. His mating bite twinged on his neck.
"Hi, baby," Tony says through a yawn. He holds out an arm and Rose curls into it, and assisted by Steve he heaves the little girl up onto his chest.
Briefly, Tony considered the possibility of the food being drugged, but it didn't seem likely. Ezekiel could have just as easily plunged a syringe into his neck downstairs, since it wasn't like he needed to trick Tony to overpower him. The power imbalance was already pretty established by now.
"Thank you," she parrots groggily and waves at the members of staff peeking through the door to the kitchen. "Thank you, Father." She waves at Rick.
He pushes himself up, watching as JARVIS knocks out the last goon. "Great job, buddy," he congratulates and JARVIS turns the armor so that he's facing him.
"Thanks for the meal," he says absently, just to fill the silence. Rogers nods from his spot in the armchair.
"No!" he yelled, voice slurring badly, "Off! Off!" He struggled, but the woman stayed leaned over the leg. He felt another sharp pain and then the woman got up, something held in her hand.
Becker finally managed to pull him up, an enraged snarl on his face. Tony wasn't intimidated by it and sent a knee to Becker's side as soon as he could. He leaned away, arms bending to break the other man's hold. It worked, he was clear of Becker. With that, however, he was also imbalanced, and he fell to the ground, parallel to the car next to him.
"Please, I—" Tony let slip, barely able to breathe. He could feel the odd gravity pulling him down and taste the stale air he had breathed in on Titan. He could see Peter turning to ashes before him, clinging onto him and crying,
They spend the rest of the day cleaning in the aftermath. Halfway through the cleanup, someone tells Bruce what Tony had done, and the Hulk finally makes an appearance. Steve just stares at him tiredly, then turns away and continues helping the moderately injured make their way to the secondary medical tents.
But he'd found Tony again, in the Haven. He'd found Tony, and found everything he never thought they could have together – love, and a child, and joy.
For all that Tony is outgoing and expressive, there are times that he is very good at schooling his expression into unfluctuating neutrality. Probably an essential skill in the business world. This, however – unfortunately for Tony – is not one of those times. For a fraction of a second, his face twists up into an expression that tells Bucky he's hit the nail square on the head, and then his face closes off entirely.
He closes up the files, and by the time he's got them ready, there is a response from the nanny applicant sitting in his inbox. The promptness of her reply is another point in her favour. God, he really hopes she is a good fit. He can't bear the idea of having to start the search all over again. He was lucky enough that the school was willing to take Casey on for the last couple of months of this year after the move, even though technically Casey isn't old enough yet. But the school just simply isn't an option for the summer.
That night, Tony crawls into bed feeling pleasantly tired and comfortably sore from the training. He presses his face into Steve's pillow and breathes in. He's happy, but once Steve gets home, it'll be perfect. He pulls out his phone and sends Steve a quick message that just says 'Love you, miss you. Kisses,' and drops his phone on the stand next to the bed.
And then they're all ash on the breeze, and Tony crumples to the ground in a lifeless heap as Steve desperately calls his name.
“No, I don’t know for sure, but I can make an educated guess. And I’m a genius, so you know, my educated guesses are pretty damn good.”
Steve is already running, has been since Tony put the glove on. But he's not fast enough, and he can't get there before Tony uses the stones. The beam of light from his glove splits – into two, into four, into a thousand beams of light, flowing out from him and into all the beasts in the horde, into Thanos' generals, into every enemy on the battlefield.
"Well, uh, I'll leave you to it. Shout when you want out." With that, Tony turns and beats a very hasty retreat back to the bedroom. There, he digs through the closet and pulls out a spare blanket to wrap himself up in – and protect the bedding from his wet clothes – and flops dramatically on the bed. He is so screwed. There is approximately a 0.01 per cent chance that he is going to make it through the night with his dignity intact. Steve is just... too damn much. He's too gorgeous, too sweet, too strong. And the way he hadn't seemed to mind Tony seeing his vulnerabilities is... overwhelming, to say the least. It felt as though Steve letting him help was more than just necessity. It had felt like an offer of trust. It stirs up feelings inside Tony that he doesn't really want to consider. Feelings that are more than just a crush, more than just swooning over an attractive, kind barista. Feelings that he'd only felt once before –
"It felt so real," he whispers, voice hoarse. "All of it. Casey, our life, Steve. Oh god, Steve." He shudders as the warring memories of falling asleep in his apartment curled up with Steve, and waking up in the hospital bed in Wakanda. "Rhodey, we were..."
"You can't," Vision said, taking her hands gently in his. "Wanda, it's too important that you stay here."
"The Time stone doesn't leave my possession," Strange announced. "I've sworn on my life to keep it safe."
"It's fine," Steve says, managing to extricate himself from his own tangle and push himself up to sitting. "It's – it's not your fault I mean, mornings are – hoo boy, mornings, right?"
the one who forgets my coffee is beside my elbow for hours at a time, as well as my phone, my food, my basic hygiene?"
Steve feels like he's on the verge of falling apart at the thought of that. The dead, the injured. They'd won, but the cost had been high.
Tony is blinking up at him. His face is drawn, gaunt, and his eyes aren't bright and alert, but he's making eye contact with Steve and Steve can tell he's lucid.
Steve is straining to hear, because he doesn't understand, he must have misheard, but some part of him, somewhere deep in his lizard brain, there are alarm bells clanging, something isn't right, but he doesn't –
It also resulted in him and Steve both snapping and falling into bed together. Well, falling onto the shop couch together. But they did make it to a bed. Eventually.
Something passes over Tony's face, a strange expression that's part understanding, part sympathy, part something else that Steve can't identify. But for a moment, it feels like Tony can see inside his very soul.
Clint has it as well, as does Steve. But for them, it is warm. For Bucky and Natasha, it's like frost across a window in the dark. Glittering like ice and snow. A cold detachment that keeps them at a distance.
Tony had dropped him off at his meeting with the distributor, they traded numbers, and with a promise to call when he was done his own meeting, Tony left. It was well on the way to being a great day.
Once they've got the source of the problem dealt with, the rest of the clean up is surprisingly easy. Easy, but messy and time consuming. Tony flies back to the site of the battle in time to see the rest of his team struggling with keeping the King Blob in place. It's not, strictly speaking, necessary. The giant blob, like its smaller counterparts, has proven to be non-lethal, and they could just follow it around its tour up towards Midtown until they'd hit it with enough paintballs to reduce it to nothing, but leaving a trail of slime and paint around the city probably isn't going to win them any favour, and honestly, a messy clean up was going to be more work for him – and for the poor kids who'd landed them in this mess in the first place.
They had talked about it before, at least a little. How they'd fallen in love with each other in the Haven, how Steve had started to consider futures that he'd given up on, how even in reality he'd given up on hoping for what they had now between them. Tony had never stopped to consider that Steve might, after all that, still want a child.
The guy put serious effort into getting you shut down before you even opened your doors. He probably could have found a way to do it, too, with a little more time."
But each post has impressive reach. Whoever their social media consultant is, they're good at what they do. The problem is that, the more reach and social media success Brewed Awakening gets, the more people will be around to pose a threat to Casey.
Tony sighs and sinks back into the sofa, sipping at the cup of coffee he had picked up from Brewed Awakening on his way home from the office. He'd been looking forward to getting home to cuddle with Casey for a while, but he'd returned to a note from Natasha saying she'd taken him to the park for a bit before dinner. Tony knows they'll be home soon, but he still can't help but miss his son.
Tony keeps that eye contact, trying to project the maelstrom of feelings – happiness, joy, love, desire, relief, gratitude – as he slowly sinks down, bringing Steve into his body.
“I don’t know,” Steve says automatically, without thinking. He doesn’t have an answer to that. His therapist would probably be thrilled if he did. But. He’s still too busy being lost. The thought makes his chest seize up, the edges of that wound still so raw they might as well still be bleeding.
The morning does not start off well. His sleep is broken, and he wakes with a start from a dream that he can't quite remember, but that leaves him feeling out of sorts, a little disconnected, and unsettled. It gets worse when he goes to make breakfast and discovers that he forgot to stop at the store last night, so he's completely out of coffee at home, and there isn't a drop of milk to be found. Casey valiantly puts up with eating toast and peanut butter when he really wanted cereal, but his little face still looks disappointed. Tony feels a bit like a failure.
He works on the Stark Resilient stuff first – not because it's a higher priority, even though, technically, it probably is. More because the thought of leaving Casey in someone else's care for the better part of every weekday has his heart clenching painfully in his chest.
." The anger is laced with concern as Bucky presses himself up against Steve's side. Steve slumps against him slightly, and lets Bucky lead him through the shop into the back office. Steve drops himself down on the nap couch – another of Clint's bright ideas, one that Steve is incredibly grateful for right now – and stretches his leg out.
"We should shower," Tony says after another moment of basking in the afterglow, in the recovery of a truly wonderful orgasm. "We're gonna stick together."
Luck is on his side for once tonight, and he manages to make it back before Steve is done. He’s just putting the finishing touches on when Steve steps outside. Tony hears the sharp intake of breath, and turns to find Steve standing by the door, staring in awe and the beautifully done up table, lit up with candles and soft patio lights.
"Wow, I sure am glad I fought against the entire United Nations to keep you by my side, Buck," Steve says, deadpan.
"You can come with us, if you like," Tony says. "I know you – I know you care about him. If you're not ready to – to separate, or whatever, yet. I can make up the guest room."
Steve is glad he doesn't have to ask Clint to grab Sam – he'd been thinking it, but for some reason the idea of putting it into words had made him feel like it would make something worse happen. Like bringing in the guy who could help with trauma counseling would somehow create trauma.
“Not really,” he says honestly. “I mean we work together fine. For work. But you have to admit, we’re not doing a very good job of… living this close to each other.”
Steve sets the cookie down in front of Casey first, who dutifully thanks him before picking it up and taking a ridiculously large bite. Then he sets the cannoli in front of Tony.
. It pings around in his head – probably because it was a stupid thing to say and he feels a little mortified – but he shakes it off and brings his attention back to Tony.
Steve is honestly overwhelmed at how thoughtful and conscientious Casey is. Tony really is an incredible dad, to have raised such an amazing kid. Steve hopes one day he'll be able to tell Tony that without the words getting stuck in his throat.
"Tony! Oh, god, Tony, wake up!" He knows he sounds desperate, irrational, but he can't help it. He's already lost Tony once today, he can't survive doing it again.
He's still got bruises and cuts on his face from their run in with Ares (because of course, yes, let's have more gods come to earth hell bent on destruction), but he's healing well. They sit together in silence while Tony eats his cannoli and Steve browse's the day's news.
She thinks Bucky might have learned it in the middle east, during his time overseas. A necessary education in survival.
“You’ll still be expected to keep in touch and report to SHIELD,” Coulson informs him as Steve wanders around, examining the space. “You’re still a matter of national security.” He sounds apologetic, but Steve can’t really be that upset. On the whole, Coulson has been good, better than he’d expected, really. Steve respects the man, and honestly, he’s grateful for everything that Coulson has done.
He's still distracted by memories of Tony laughing at Casey and his silly jokes when he walks into the Brooklyn shop to pick up supplies. The store isn't due to open for another 15 minutes, so he lets himself in through the back and is stopped short, greeted by the sight of Bucky laughing, leaning forward to casually press a kiss to Clint's mouth.
. Rhodey is obviously great to Tony, they go back a long way. They're a good fit. It's not Rhodey's fault that Steve heard 'single' dad and automatically assumed 'unattached.' Rhodey is a great guy, and Steve's happy for them. Really. Whatever it is between them, if it makes Tony happy, then it makes Steve happy. "Yeah, like Rhodey."
Tony must take the choked noise for a laugh, because he gives Steve a self-deprecating grin, not quite meeting Steve's eyes.
They take their time under the spray, gently washing one another with Tony's vanilla spice body wash. They interrupt themselves with constant kissing and teasing touches, but they don't let it go any further than that. There'll be time again tomorrow.
a whiteboard – if they want to leave a message for anyone, that’s what phones are for. If they wanted to make a shopping list, that’s what JARVIS is for. And yet, one day, out of nowhere and much to Tony’s dismay, a whiteboard had appeared, bearing little cartoon caricatures of each of them. Since then, the damn thing and all of its constantly changing doodles have become a permanent fixture in the space, and so help him, Tony loves it.
Steve blinks in surprise, and it’s followed quickly by angry frustration. “Maybe because I can’t have a civil conversation with you without you digging at me and pushing me away.”
"Left again. For good, this time. I think it might be because I keep making stupid decisions like this, but I'm not sure." Tony smirked. "Probably for the best. For her, I mean. Safer, less stressful."
"Oh, that, sure," says Man-bun, turning to Hunka. "Stevie, you got an admirer. I was the manager yesterday, today is your turn."
A few feet away, Tony picks up a bar stool by the legs and swings it at one of the HYDRA goons with everything he’s got. It connects hard with the man's knee, and he crumples to the ground, cursing. Tony lets out a satisfied whoop that Steve can’t help but find it adorable enough to temporarily chase away all of the complicated feelings that he has regarding Tony.  Now isn’t the time to deal with them anyway.
Tony doesn’t budge. “Fine. I’ll do the talking.”  Steve doesn’t want to hear it, but Tony is between him and any reasonable way out, and he really doesn’t want to cause yet another scene, so he braces himself for the inevitable tirade.
Tony is spluttering, half-laughing at Rhodey's diatribe, when Steve comes over with a pot of coffee, pouring them each a refill. Tony can't help it, his face goes bright red, because what if Steve had
strange. He's strange, and that's all Steve thinks about him. He certainly doesn't have any thoughts or opinions on Tony's gorgeous, sparkling brown eyes or way the skin around them crinkles when he smiles and sags when he's tired. Steve didn't even
Steve swallows roughly. "They don't know," he admits, pulling the dome off a large serving bowl of stew. The spicy aroma of it is enough to keep his appetite from waning at the thought of Tony's uncertain condition. Bucky pulls two dishes from the cart's interior shelf and fills them with the warm, rich stew, handing one of them and a spoon to Steve. "All we can do is wait."
"It's Tony," Natasha tells him. "Tony is the one who's pulling away. But he won't talk to me, either. I've tried."
That gets a shaky laugh from her, and she and her friends turn quickly to leave. But she pauses for a second, and turns back to face him. "Mr. Stark, one more thing. How the hell did you figure that out? With the Polyethylene glycol, of all things?"
It had only been minutes, and suddenly a sparking gold ring – a portal – had opened up next to Tony, and through it he could see what looked like a rich, Victorian parlour. A tall, slim man with a beard and – for god's sake, an actual cape – had stepped out, as well as a round-cheeked Chinese man dressed in silk robes.
Steve stares up at him, and in that instant he thinks that Stark might actually be his favourite person that he’s met since waking up. Granted, he hasn’t met many people, but Stark is different from all of them. Stark’s the first to actually treat him as Steve Rogers. As a human being, not an icon to be raised on a pedestal or an asset to be handled. When he grins, Steve sees something that reminds him of Dugan’s playful nature, and Stark can hold his own around him as well as any of the Howlies could, and he looks gorgeous doing it. The thought of the past stings like it always does, but Steve pushes it aside for the time being as he takes Stark’s proffered hand and pulls himself to his feet.
Bucky shrugs. "Remember that night we were hanging out with Sam and you were sprawled all over me during the movie? He never asked about it so I just assumed you told him."
"Oh, yeah, the new coffee shop. We actually got a little flyer in the mail about it. This is apparently their second location – they've got one in Brooklyn already."
"She is pretty special," Steve agrees. Natasha looks slightly pink in the cheeks, but pleased, and she ruffles Casey's hair. Steve hasn't spent as much time with her as he would have liked but it feels like she belongs in their lives, and Steve is grateful to have her there. Both for the sake of his makeshift family, and because Tony can rest easier knowing that Casey has the best looking out for him.
“Okay…” Tony says carefully, turning in his chair to face Steve, arms folded over his chest. Steve is still looking around, studying the workspace with intense scrutiny, so Tony waits.
As it turned out, there isn’t much new that Tony is able to learn, but a lot that he is able to confirm. Aspects of Steve’s brain scans show similar patterns to Bucky’s when he first came in. The disruption in the pathways to access memories are clear. HYDRA has been ruthlessly efficient about cutting Steve off from himself, and it serves to reconfirm why the hell Steve can’t remember anything about his time before the kidnapping. The one good thing that Tony can see is that Steve wasn’t there long enough for HYDRA to start overlaying anything else. So, the good thing is, the serum should heal Steve’s brain, and he should start to remember. Eventually. Probably. The bad news is, there isn’t a damn thing Tony can do to help it go faster. They’re at the mercy of whatever Steve’s body and brain decides to do for him.
Casey comes running into the kitchen then, T-shirt soaked with water from washing his hands. Tony wonders fondly how much of the water actually got on his skin.
"We're not the police." It's Natasha, she must have gotten closer to Tony, and she doesn't even sound out of breath anymore. "You'll probably wish we were."
"You're allowed to mourn that kid," Sam tells him, sitting up and leaning forward. "And when Tony wakes up, he's gonna mourn that kid, too."
, and he would grind his hard cock down against Tony's, slide his body against Tony's like silk over steel.
The current drawing is of a cheerful, tiny cartoon Tony, sitting at a tiny cartoon table, eating a not-so-tiny cartoon sandwich. Above cartoon-Tony’s head is speech bubble reading, ‘Gosh, I sure am glad that I listened to Steve and ate this delicious sandwich.’
Whatever is wrong with Vision, Shuri's lab is going to be far more helpful than the medical ward. Vision leans heavily against him as they walk, but insists on getting there under his own power. Stubborn. Not surprising, looking at the factors that had helped create him.
He's saved from any further attempts to convince himself by the ding of the elevator outside the front door – Casey and Natasha have arrived home.
"I wasn't sure if you wanted to interview them or not, but either way, they're all expecting to hear from you."
"We feed them anyway," Steve shrugs. "I'm not going to turn away folks who need it. It's not just the homeless, either, though we do occasionally partner up with a shelter in Brooklyn to provide meals to them. I had a single mom come in a few times just after we opened up the Brooklyn shop. She'd just got out of a rough relationship, left her husband and took her two kids, was between jobs. Ran out of money before she ran out of month a few times. We helped make sure she and the kids didn't go hungry. Now she's back on her feet with a good job and in a relationship with another wonderful woman. They come in once a week for lunch and always donate a meal." Steve isn't sure why he's suddenly telling Tony all of this. He barely knows the man, and Tony has no real reason to care. But Tony is listening to him,
"I talked to Natasha. Called her when I heard you were stuck to make sure she was okay to stay with Casey overnight or if she needed reinforcements or anything brought over."
"Probably not," Steve says. Around them, people seem to either be being smart, and getting the hell out of dodge, or standing around watching with the same horrified fascination that Tony and Steve both are experiencing.
Thinking about that hurts, and so he tries not to. Which, of course, means that it’s all he can think about. He retreats into his apartment, and doesn’t have the energy to fight the surging thoughts.
The shop is empty inside when he arrives — thank god for small mercies. The few patrons at the establishment are sitting outside, enjoying the early summer sun and
"Yes?" Bruce says, blinking at him, and then eyes widening with the same high speed thought Tony was working on. "The energy signature won't be exactly the same, but we should be able to make it work. I mean, we still have all that data from the scepter tests."
It’s been a week since Steve has seen Tony, and longer since they’d had an interaction that hadn’t ended in them hurtling angry words at each other, and he’s forgotten just how good it feels to fight and banter with Tony at his side. He’s missed this, and he aches for the friendship they could have had if they could just… find a way to make it work.
Somehow, they manage to get there without Tony embarrassing himself with either a poorly-timed erection or by dropping to his knees and begging to suck Steve off. Steve takes a seat on the toilet while Tony kneels beside the tub and starts running the water, fiddling with the taps until he finds the perfect temperature. Once he's happy with it, he perches himself on the edge of the tub, facing Steve. Absently, Steve runs a hand through his hair, but halfway through he jerks his hand away as though he'd burned himself. Something passes over his face, but he takes a steadying breath, grabs a towel, and lays it across his lap. "There's still glass in my hair," he says quietly, and runs his fingers through his hair again, methodically shaking out the tiny bits of windshield onto the towel. It's safety glass, designed to shatter on impact into edgeless shards that don't cut, but it still sucks.
But he doesn't – he has to get up, get Casey's lunch packed, and make breakfast before Casey goes to school. Then he has to make his way to Brooklyn and be as charming as possible to persuade Brewed Awakening to change their mind about their new location.
"Tony, please," he corrects her. "Did you know about this?" He nods his head over to the under-construction building. Julie smiles at him, obviously unaware of the catastrophic inevitabilities that 'Brewed Awakening' will have on the neighbourhood.
"Tony, Rhodey's here," Bruce says, pulling him out of his thoughts. He squeezes Tony's shoulder gently, and excuses himself to go and help Shuri to give Tony some space. Sure enough, Rhodey walks into the lab looking every bit as wrecked as Tony feels. It's all Tony can do to keep from flinging himself at Rhodey, and clinging with everything he's got. But Rhodey is still at his side a moment later, arms wrapped around him in a tight hug.
He scrambles to undo his seat belt and shove the door open. He needs to make sure his team is okay. Bucky. Clint. His knee gives out as he tries to climb out of the vehicle, and the sand burns his hands as he tried to push himself up. He tries to stand, but his knee buckles again. He cries out, and swears, dragging himself through the sand as he tries to find his team. There's glass and shrapnel everywhere, but he doesn't care. He needs to find – he needs –
"Steve Rogers," says Steve, uncrossing his arms to clasp Tony's hand. He has a good, solid grip, but Tony purposefully keeps control of the handshake. "Of Brewed Awakening."
“Snoopy?” Tony said as he started climbing out the window. “They went full 1950’s dad-with-a-shotgun on me and demanded to know what my intentions were towards you!” Honestly, it had been excruciating. And he was pretty sure that a wrong answer would mean him waking up in the middle of the night with one of them standing over him threateningly. No, thank you. Best to avoid them all until they got bored and moved on. Or let Steve talk to them. Yeah, Steve could deal with it. It had been his idea, after all.
It's not exaggerating to say it had been, hands down, the best hug of his life. Steve's arms had been strong and warm and so tight wrapped around him. He'd felt truly enveloped, cocooned, and
Tony had fallen in love with him in the Haven, too. That's enough for Steve. It's enough to make him believe that Tony might still feel something for him now.
"Hey, kiddo, you have a good day, okay?" Tony says, going down to one knee so he can give Casey a tight hug.
"That's great to hear," he says distractedly, ignoring the fact that they haven't updated the StarkPhone in almost a year. Tony pulls Rhodey's pen out of his hand and scribbles his signature on a napkin. Obviously, it's an autograph seeker. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's been becoming more frequent since Forbes' spread on his – and Stark Resilient's – rise.
“Ha! Take that,” Tony says triumphantly, and turns around to face the fray again. They’re lucky that the HYDRA team and the club owner’s flunkies are doing a pretty good job of keeping each other occupied. It leaves Steve and Tony free to move around the room and incapacitate the ones who seem like they are the biggest threats.
"You are not fine! Don't argue with me," Tony shouts back. "Stubborn ass." This last is more of a mutter.
Steve doesn't mind it so much. He likes working with his hands, and with the bustle of the coffee shop, sometimes being able to work alone like this is a nice break. It gives him time to think, to plan.
, Tony thought, but refrained from saying. It wouldn't do him any good either way. Instead, he stared defiantly into Becker's eyes and waited it out.
It earns him a soft smile and that gives Tony courage. Courage to stop Steve with a hand on his arm. The alpha stops obediently, and Tony can tell that his hackles are raising when Tony's eyes scan the area, his blue eyes shifting to follow Tony's line of sight. But there is no threat, and Steve seems to get it right away when Tony leans in, touching his lips to Steve's, breathing his scent in.
"You need some Advil?" Bruce asks from the other side of the work bench. The beta had previously offered to help him with his steadily increasing work-load, and although Tony's 'guilt-complex' (Bruce's words, not his) which is bigger than the Empire State Building had almost forced him to decline the offer, Bruce's knowing look and the his own near crippling stress had compelled him into agreeing.
"Tony?" Steve croaks, grabbing Tony's hand and covering it with his larger one, and Tony uses his free hand to quickly pour and bring a cup of water close to Steve's face.
"I simply do what is required of me," she interrupted, leaning back in her chair like she had no worries in the world. She glanced at the one-way mirror, pushing a stray piece of hair behind her ear. She smiled at her own reflection, and Steve despised her.
"Bring him downstairs for me," Ezekiel said, eyes still on Tony as he stripped out of his suit jacket, handing it to one of the women trailing after him. "A chair will do this time."
Rhodey was silent for a moment, studying him. "Steve," he finally pressed, disbelief in his eyes. Dr. Miller's scream cut through the air, and Rhodey pointed to the interrogation room. "I don't like that bitch anymore than you do, but you need to think. This isn't right." He added more emphasis to his voice as he continued, "
He stood up and walked over to the table by the wall and Tony was filled with dread as he wondered what Bates might be retrieving from there. Now that they were free to roam, his hands flew to the bit of chain he could reach, fingers straining for the simple swivel clips. He stopped when, after a brief moment, Bates turned back and walked back over to Tony. In his hand he held a bundle of nylon rope.
home. A stylish, newly renovated penthouse here in New York. Tony had visited it a couple of times beforehand, having been given the right to dominate their furniture, and the large windows showed an amazing view over New York. The sea could be seen from the Eastern side of the building, also. The apartment wasn't that far from shore.
He let Tony choke for a while longer, watching him and keeping him pinned down to the floor. "Hm?" he continued, raising his eyebrows as if he was waiting for Tony's answer. Then,
"Okay, are you all done now?" Tony asks the kid after Nat has risen back up to stand, and Rose is making her way to him.
With one powerful movement, he flips Tony over to his stomach, and starts kissing down his back, pulling his shirt out of the way and locking Tony's hands in it. He presses his crotch against Tony's behind, and Tony can't quite suppress the gasp at the feeling of his erection dragging over his cleft.
"You'll see Steve when you get back, okay?" Tony tries to mollify her, but it doesn't do much. He takes a seat at the edge of Steve's hospital bed and leans in to whisper in her hear, "Maybe you can draw him another picture there? That way it'll be a surprise." It seems to do the trick, as the toddler perks up a little, and Tony answers Steve's questioning look with a small smirk and a wink.
"That won't help you get out of the contract, Tony. You know it won't. We're stuck with each other at least until Rose presents and takes over the company."
"Me too," Tony admits tightly as Steve rushes past him and out of the room. The sudden silence feels deafening.
crawl up the stairs and into the dining room, while Hammer hadn't managed to get one corrected blueprint out of him.
Steve nods. Takes a quick breath and gives the order. Tony let's JARVIS finish the sequence to unlock the doors to the two holding cells and the doors slide open half a second later. An alarm starts blaring.
Tony snorted. "Which there are a lot of," he mumbled under his breath, but sobered when Bates didn't seem particularly receptive towards his jab. "Fair enough," he said in a louder voice, shifting uncomfortably under Bates' intense stare, "So, I suppose Hammer wants my help designing something then, huh?"
"Stop right there, you prick!" Becker yelled from the other side of the room. Tony turned to look at him; his face was red with fury as he stood there, a sleep mark still fresh on his cheek. He was holding up another gun, pointing the barrel straight at Tony.
"I have work to do, too, you know," Tony calls after him, not really expecting to be excused from the 'quality time' they will be spending in the evening, but just to make sure his displeasure with Rick is made known.
"Uh, woah, spooked me over there for a moment, Cap," Tony tries to salvage the situation, heart racing, but Steve already has a dark look to his otherwise bright eyes. The Captain wasn't stupid, after all, and Tony's flinch with a bruised cut on his cheek were clues good enough.
He heard Ezekiel sighing, and when someone grabbed him, pulling him up, blood rushed away from his head and towards his feet. He passed out.
"Alpha Darrow is here to discuss a deal between me and him," Howard informed after a beat, apparently to no one in particular, but Tony was pretty sure he was the only one in the room who wasn't in the know. His Father just refused to acknowledge his existense, that's all. "We were informed of your first heat a couple of weeks earlier—"
"Rather I'm up late, actually," he chirps at the alpha, staring at the dripping coffee as if that will make it brew faster. He hears the captain sigh at him.
Yes, I'm still alive and kicking! Sorry for the long wait and thank you for all the lovely support, it means very much to me.
Natasha's usually unreadable face was openly displaying concern and her knuckles were white as she pursed her hands into tight fists. Tony was important to her, Steve knew, and this mission would in all accounts be personal. By her side, Bruce was pale, a little green around the edges. For him, this was personal, too.
"No, I—" She cut herself off to draw in a shaky breath, eyes traveling up to glance at the door. "I can't help you. But I can help
"Nope," Tony quips as he speeds past Steve into the direction of the kitchen, and he can tell that Bruce is making some kind of a facial expression at the captain. What the hell, they probably have some sign code for every time one of them steps into another landmine, so he probably shouldn't be surprised that Steve follows him into the kitchen along with Bruce.
"Yeah, yeah, blame it on me," Tony drawled, tensing as his wounds rubbed uncomfortably against the ropes and the pillar behind his back.
"Stop!" Tony yelled when Becker's hands touched his shoulder blades. They gripped the fabric of his t-shirt, ripping it to expose his back, tearing it down the middle. Tony let out a startled shout right after as the leather belt suddenly struck his upper back, leaving a burning strip of flesh in its wake.
Steve nodded, gritting his teeth. He heard a sudden noise, and turned his head to watch as Rhodes stomped out of the interrogation room. A moment later, the door to the viewing room opened.
Tony pinned him down to the floor with his knees against his back and a hand to the back of his neck. With his free left hand he pulled out Marco's gun from his waistband.
"Well, what do you think?" he bit back, trying to convey what he thought of Becker's question, while simultaneously attempting to stay subdued. Just thinking about acting meek and obedient in front of Becker caused chills to go down his spine, but he didn't want to anger the man either; he really wasn't feeling up to another roughing.
In hindsight, he probably should have seen it for what it was. They had security for these kinds of things after all, a simple fundraiser shouldn't need an Avenger operating as additional defense. But the waitress had seemed anxious and genuine and Tony was good at telling when people were deceiving him, and this wasn't it.
"Get up," Becker said, one hand already around Tony's arm to pull him up. Tony stumbled after him as Becker all but manhandled him towards the motel room's tiny bathroom. He shoved him in.
Before they can do anything else, they have to separate because JARVIS alerts them about Bruce, on his way to the kitchen. Despite the disappointment, they go laughing like teenagers as they flee into separate floors to avoid the beta catching them.
"It's alright, Mr. Stark," the doctor said, her hand brushing over his brow in a soothing manner. Tony whined, turning his head away even as the movement made his vision swim. His friends were allowed to touch him like that, but no one else. Pepper and Rhodey could. Happy. Bruce and Peter. And...Steve? Mmm. Steve.
," Rick says, emphasizing Steve's name in a way that suggests he doesn't like calling Steve that. Which, he probably doesn't, and he's only doing it to rile Tony up. And he succeeds in it, like he usually does.
"Annoyed, because I had to wake up to your bickering," Natasha grumbles, and Tony can't help but sigh in relief.
"You watch your mouth, you—" Becker's heated tirade was cut off by the sudden burst of laughter. It took him a second, but Tony recognized the sound of it.
"Natasha, how are you feeling?" Bruce asks, walking to her bedside and taking one hand by the wrist to check her pulse, although his eyes are fixed on the monitor that displays her stats. Habits, then.
"Steve, calm down, you're fine," he soothes, although his tone is harsh like it usually is. He isn't a very soothing person by nature. That was trained out of him.
"Rose," Tony warns, voice lacking all sterness it should hold, instead replaced with wavering caused by his own overwhelming emotions. It's been nearly three months since the three left for their mission, and no word has come through after the last coded message they received a few weeks ago.
Tony notices that Rick's smile has turned a tad more sardonic than before as he gazes down at Steve, so he reaches over and yanks the book from the blonde's hands. He turns it over and reads the title, written in a faded golden font on the simple green cover.
After getting the first bite into his mouth, Tony felt like he had waited long enough. "I do have one question, though."
"Shut up," Becker snapped, unsurprisingly, "You better not try and make a ruckus, or I'll find something to gag you with."
Bates and the bodyguard walked him out of the dining room and through the lobby again, this time stopping by a door that lead to the basement. As they trailed down the steps, Tony noticed the drop in temperature and the hairs on his arms stood up on end. The basement itself was spacious and dim, only lit by a couple of hopper windows. The floor was concrete and the walls stone, and along the roof and up the walls traveled a number of exposed pipes. One lamp hung from the ceiling, but it wasn't turned on.
Tony felt ill at the notion of Hammer calling him 'the goods', but he let it pass uncommented in favor of sipping his coffee.
"For what?" Tony asked irritably, "I'm not building him anything. Is there even a workshop in this dump? Because if so, I highly doubt it meets all the safety regulations."
he had thought at last minute, and gave them his old address instead, the penthouse being still owned by him and Rick, but now mostly empty and the whole building uninhabited. He was extremely grateful for his decision when the building collapsed in on him, almost instantly after he'd gotten on the top floor to check if anybody had taken the bait.
"Yes, yes, good to finally meet you, Anthony," Chester Darrow rambled pleasantly, standing up and cradling Tony's hand in his larger hands. Just cradling, not shaking. You didn't shake an omega's hand, especially if you were an alpha like his Father or Alpha Darrow.
"She's a nutcase," the man said, indicating with a thumb over his shoulder. He looked angry and tired, and there was a light coating of perspiration on his forehead.
"Thank me by helping me out of these ropes," Tony said, trying to sound encouraging but landing on snappish. Well, he would blame it on his shitty day.
"He doesn't love me," Tony clarified, this time with all of his essence, voice choked and nose clogged as a new set of tears made their way down his face. The pain on his shoulder was horrible, but nothing compared to the anguish he felt inside.
"You don't even believe that yourself," Ezekiel said cruelly, crouching to loom over Tony. "I know he chose his buddy over you. I know that he left you for dead in Siberia."
"You're all bruised up," he says, voice tight and slightly choked, like the fact that Tony has a couple of bite marks, a hickey and a cut on his cheek is killing him, like it's the end of the world.
"Yeah, I've heard about your sister's husband, even met him," he replies tersely, straining away from Rick's hand and against the one on his neck as subtly and passively as he can. He's really not feeling it right now.
His back, unsurprisingly, was the worst of it all. It was mottled with black and blue, sticky or caked with blood on places, and there was hardly any of his normal skin color to be seen. His ass had a few welts and his knees were bruised, but fortunately nothing felt broken or infected.
"I can't. I'm sorry," Dina said. She fell quiet, looking away from Tony. He was miserable, and so it irked him.
were wrong. And because of you and your selfishness millions have been harmed and killed. My father—"
"Answer the question," Ezekiel pressed, twisting his fingers painfully into a handful of Tony's hair and pushing his head back.
He wasn't able to contain the moan of pain at the movement. A burning sensation had flared up along the muscles of his back, and his entire back felt hot and swollen. Even breathing hurt. He didn't even want to imagine the mess of bruises and torn skin his back was sure to be.
Now though, Tony was trying a different tactic. One that would get him in his kidnappers' good graces and possibly have the added benefit of not constantly getting him roughed up or choked.
was in a car when her driver disintegrated." As Ezekiel spoke, he brought the cane down on Tony's back a few times, emphasizing his speech. "She survived the crash. She was brought into a hospital because of some broken bones."
Ezekiel let go of Tony's hair, holding his head up by his jaw instead. Tony tried to squirm away, but Ezekiel's grip was unyielding. "Haven't you wondered why you are still here?" he asked suddenly, his tone almost gentle. Changing angles, Tony hazily realized.
Tony didn't reply, but he was sure that was answer enough. Instead, he looked into Ezekiel's eyes; they were filled with what Tony could describe only as pure hate.
"Alright, Jarv, time to call my daughter's favourite godmother and ask whether she's free to babysit...." he babbles on as he leaves the room.
And it wasn't like it was a bad reward. Quite the contrary actually. Tony's body was begging for rest and food by now, and a shower and clean clothes would make him feel less like a pathetic wreck and more like a human being again. Some Neosporin and new bandages would go a long way, as well.
They finish their sandwiches leisurely, although Rose keeps whining at them to hurry up right after she's ready eating, anxious to get to the zoo. Tony calmly tells her to sit down and wait or they'll go home, and she does, pouting at the threat to everyone's amusement. When they
He pulled away, moving his hand from Tony's hair to grasp his jaw instead. He squeezed a little too hard and Tony sucked in a breath. He waited for Tony to look him in the eye before continuing in a normal speaking voice, "As for your question, you may call me Bates."
He cleaned his wounds as good as he could, but refrained from otherwise touching them. The dressings that the doctor had wrapped around his arm and leg, over the cuts she had done to remove his implants, were probably supposed to have been removed or changed by now, but Tony wasn't willing to expose the cuts to the damp and dirty basement, so he kept them on.
"Of course you can, sweetie," he says instead. Rose lets out a happy 'yay' at his answer, and Rogers lowers her to the floor so that she can continue to play.
Of course, even small amount of partying or any one-night stands were unacceptable for an omega, especially for an upper class omega, but Tony was a student and about to enter an arranged marriage and he couldn't give a crap.
