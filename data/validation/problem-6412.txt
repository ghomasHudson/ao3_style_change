“Well sweetheart, there are five different main classifications; Alpha, Beta, Omega, Caregiver, Little, Dominant, Submissive. Neither of you needs to worry about what it means to be dominant or submissive. Alpha, beta and omega are a grouping together that have more animalistic qualities, while Caregivers are Mama and Me. They take care of the littles, who are people with a younger mindset. Some little’s can go between what we call a ‘headspace’ so you could go a few weeks with being little and then can go a day or so with being ‘big’ or in an adult frame of mind. Peter, you’re a pretty young little, registering around the year to year and a half mark which means that’s how you're treated. You call us Mama and Daddy because that’s what we are. I better not hear anything else from your mouth little man.” He stuck Peter with a look that had him nodding his head, eager to comply. He saw the swat that Bucky got. No way was he inviting that.
“Clint? You’re not an Alpha? What are you? A Beta?” He stopped, hoping Clint would reply with an affirmative. When he didn’t Tony swallowed and asked more tentatively. “An Omega?”
Steve and Tony weren’t sure what to say to that. Natasha, no matter the world, wasn’t one to lay her emotions out there. He said this showed how passionate she really was about this world. They both knew she cared deeply for Bucky in the other world, so it stood to reason she would be happy to see him getting the care he needed.
Peter watched curiously as they said their goodbyes to the nice lady and went through another set of doors. It was nothing like he was expecting, memories of small doctor waiting rooms with one broken toy set in a corner were quickly swept away with the waiting room he was in now. It was just as big as the foyer with a lot of comfy looking chairs and the biggest play area he’s ever seen in a waiting room. It even had a slide! It looked a bit scary though so he was going to stay with Mama and Daddy, just for a bit. He saw Bucky looking around as well before turning to Mama and letting out an annoyed cry. It looked like he was done waiting.
“Yeah, the poor baby didn’t realise he was mumbling about how magical pacifiers were at helping him calm down and ‘maybe Mama will let me not sit in the cool spider-man car seat if I give him the pacifier?’ I was literally just standing there waiting for him to work up the courage to put it into my mouth and ask his question. It was precious.” He laughed.
Tony chuckled, “He sure does, we have to make sure he gets a lot of love as well though. I don’t want him feeling left out because Bucky is going to be smaller than him and need more attention.”
The rest of the team weren’t sure how to respond. Of course, Peter looked extremely cute, the brown ears matching the colour of his hair and sticking out from the top of his head while his top, jeans and boots were all the same shade of brown. Coupling that with his black nose it gave an adorable sight. Steve and Tony though, they looked as grouchy as the bears in the stories, clearly just dressing up because Peter wanted them to.
Tony grimaced, the last time Harley came over Peter went between being super excited to have him there to being super clingy with Tony.
Tony rolled his eyes at his new Alpha’s logic. “I’m sure we’ll be able to make it back to our area before that.”
“Peter if you’re not liking school you know we can go back to private tutors?” Steve hated sending him to school and would be more than happy to have him at home all day. Peter just shook his head though.
Peter sighed, he knew how to control his bladder! “Mama, I know when I need to wee-wee.” Damn it! That made him sound even littler!
Tony took a peek at Bucky who was looking miserable in his seat. He also had a pacifier in his mouth a string coming from it that clipped to his t-shirt. That was smart. Tony wouldn’t put it past Bucky to spit it out in frustration and then cry because he wanted it. Too little to realise that his direct actions have consequences. His poor baby was all red-faced, looking back at Tony and giving him puppy dog eyes that could melt the coldest of hearts.
“Clint? Are you sick?” He asked, not understanding. There was a deafening silence while they all waited for Clint to answer. When none was forthcoming Steve cleared his throat, deciding to get to the point straight away.
Bucky felt his diaper moving and looked at his Mama. Why was he moving it already? He only had a change. Did Mama need to see something or was he checking again? Bucky could have just told him he didn’t need a change. He never did because he was a big boy.
Bucky just let out another sob, not even caring when he saw Tony and Peter standing beside them, Tony handing something to Steve. He felt the silicone teat pass his lips and latched on with strong urgent sucks, trying to calm down but unable to. He didn’t notice them moving or being put down on the changing table, it wasn’t until the fresh air hit him did the situation become apparent. There was no way out of this and looking at Steve as he expertly diapered him said everything; he was expecting this for a while. He looked around the nursery and realised it wasn’t Peter's one. His name was proudly displayed over the side of the crib in big block letters and a Captain America and Iron Man plushie much like Peter’s were waiting inside. It was then he realised just how screwed he was.
“Peter, come see Daddy.” Peter looked over to his Daddy who had his arms out. He was pretty far away if Peter was to walk but with his arms out to help balance him Daddy would probably catch him. Peter turned, still holding onto the chair, just to make sure his feet were placed in the correct way before he let go and toddled carefully over to his Daddy. He only had to take around four steps and his Daddy was snatching him up and cuddling him close.
Peter hit send and then remembered his parents told him to let them know if he was going to put any personal information up so that they could discuss it first, did this count as that?
Bruce went into one of the cabinets and withdrew an exam box. Tony had put them in each room because they also doubled as first aid boxes for all classifications, which worked out perfectly for them. He took out a pair of gloves and put them on, before clearing his throat.
Steve’s arms encircled him and held him in a hug from behind, “I am sorry sweetheart. I promise it won’t happen again.”
It was pretty much a car seat but for someone his size. His Dad, being the genius that he was, took out the single seat in the car and replaced it with a ‘Peter proof’ one.
“B-but you always laugh more with Harley and never spank him and joke more with him.” Peter listed off everything that was bothering him.
“Where’re my pants?” Peter asked, looking around the room. Papa and Dad wouldn’t let him see his costume after trying it on the one time because he most likely would have spent the whole month wearing it.
“Well someone is a lot happier than a few minutes ago. We’ll still have to get Daddy to take a look at your head though, just in case.” Peter found himself placidly agreeing with him as if sitting on Mr Starks hip while cuddling into a plushie version of him was an everyday thing. He’d like to blame it on being overwhelmed with everything that’s going on but he knew that he was just enjoying the attention from Mr Stark, even if he was being treated like a baby.
“Glad to be of service.” He quipped, ignoring Clint’s pout at being outsmarted. This wasn’t their first time dealing with a tricky Omega. Tony had kept them all on their toes since they became a team. Now it just looked like they had one more to wrangle.
Bucky was another story. He was skittish and wanted to be loved but didn’t know how to ask for it. It broke Tony’s heart watching him, so he made sure to move slowly with him, showing him that he was accepted whether he was big or little. Being sick solidified that to him as Steve and Tony didn’t leave his side unless necessary.
Steve stood up and moved the both of them so that Tony was over the arm of the chair. He made sure he was comfortable before he began to ride him hard and fast, the slap of skin against skin making a loud noise in the room. All Tony could do was hang on for the ride. It was embarrassing enough with Bucky and Clint watching, he didn’t need them to see how turned on he was as well.
“Okay. I think I can handle that then.” Tony snuggled back, content to ride out this knot, thinking about taking a nap while he waited when a thought suddenly sprung into his head and he shot back up.
Peter didn’t like the sound of that. He wanted to go with Harley but he just knew it would be a no off all of them. Maybe Harley didn’t want to spend much time with him? He didn’t seem to be too interested in him right now. Even Dad was more interested in Harley.
Looks like he was going commando today. He sat down, trying to stop his giggle when the soft carpet tickled his bottom and worked the sweatpants up his legs, falling into the change table when he stood up to pull them up the rest of the way. Ouch. That was kind of sore. Peter’s lower lip wobbled but he bit it to try and stop his tears from coming. No! He would not let his emotions get to him! He finally got the pants up brow furrowing when they felt weird on him. They looked okay. Oh well. Time for the t-shirt to go on. He wasn’t able to get his other top off so it may just have to go on over it. He was sure the tower was cold anyway so having two tops on would be okay.
“Of course I am. If you come to Stark tower tomorrow, Pepper’s assistant will set you up on the system and you can start in the next month. That should give you time to sort out your affairs here.”
“Your calendar is cleared for the next week, Tony. I’ve told Pepper that your training has started. When we mated, I contacted Pepper to put the papers through so you’ve been authorised for the next week off along with however many more that I need in your training. All I have to do is submit a form explaining the reasons for the leave. Pepper is the only one that reads it though so it’s okay.” He rushed out when he saw Tony’s look of outrage.
Peter was glued to Tony and Steve for the rest of the day. Usually, Steve would be getting impatient to have the other person gone but with Peter, he couldn’t bring himself to be annoyed. So far, Peter had asked for very little. All he wanted was cuddles and someones lap to sit in. Tony, Steve figured out, was an indulgent father. He doted on Peter and Peter soaked up the love. Sure he was babied a bit for a 14-year-old but Steve looked up Omega biology in Pups and knew that it was common. They were much more innocent than their Beta and Alpha counterparts.
“He’s upset that I’m making him go naked, and that I smacked his ass for arguing,” Steve called on his way to the kitchen to get some snacks for them.
They began to stroll slowly towards the private testing centre, it usually catered to celebrities and other people that didn’t want the whole world to know that they were getting tested. If Steve were to go by himself with Bucky he’d probably have gotten away with going to a public one but Tony’s face was just too recognisable, especially after he made all of the little range a lot more affordable than his competitors.
Clint flushed as all eyes turned to him, he ducked his head to get away from the stares, Steve’s in particular.
“Can’t forget your sidekick can we?” He asked, handing Peter the plushie. Peter hugged it to him straight away, glad to have finally gotten the hug he wanted off of Ironman for it. He found it a bit funny that he was hugging the plushie of the man that was also cuddling him but he was sure that Mr Stark’s Iron man wasn’t as nice to cuddle with. The thought of him cuddling made him laugh slightly, cringing a bit when it came out as a giggle instead of the manly laugh he was going for.
He curled his toes into the carpet, looking at them. He was barefoot but no way was he trying to put on socks. He didn’t have it in him to take that battle on. Now time to walk out and let Mama and Dada know that he was a big boy. They had to believe him. He did just dress himself, he had no diaper on, and he got out of his crib without any help at all! How much bigger could you get?
“Clint, best not shout at an Omega’s Alpha when they’re in heat. If Tony wasn’t stuck to Steve right now then he would have gone for you most likely. You should know though if the exam proves you’re an Omega.” Bruce said mildly.
He sat back and watched as his Dad put his arms through the straps and connected it to the lock, tightening the straps when he was done.
“Oh. Harley’s an adult. Why didn’t you just say so?” Peter asked, taking back one of his hands and wiping his damp eyes. Harley being an adult changed everything. Peter never saw him like that but he got it. Adults had more freedoms than kids did. It made sense. “Does Harley hate me now?” He asked, worried that Harley really wouldn’t like him anymore.
Looking at Peter now he could see how much he wanted to do the Q and A. He was extremely excited when he woke up this morning to find he had 50 thousand people following him. Steve still had reservations though.
“Thanks for the ringing endorsement Peter. I’m sure that will help Jamie.” Peter nodded, happy he could help. He held Jamie’s hand until Dada had him in his arms before letting go, content to know that his Dada had it now.
Peter wasted no time packing his bag and racing to the front of the class, his cheeks stained red from the number of people that were going between looking at him and his Dad.
“It’s okay. I like it, you can call me whatever you feel comfortable with baby.” Tony grinned as the boy blushed harder at his own nickname but made note that he didn’t make any protests about it.
He thought the Harley should move in and be adopted by them because Peter saw him as a big brother and didn’t get that Harley had a mother and sister back in Tennessee to go back to.
Clint blinked. “Hold on. Am I hearing you right? You had a replica of your cock made for Tony? You, Captain America, let someone near you when you were hard that wasn’t Tony?” Clint couldn’t believe it. He opened his mouth to ask some more questions but Tony’s growl cut him short.
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve commented casually, gripping Tony’s hips and bringing him back so that he wasn’t getting any stimulation to his cock. “You know the rules. By my cock or not at all darling.” He grunted as he ground his hips against Tony’s ass, his knot already beginning to grow. Clint un-paused his game and changed to one player before continuing, Bucky watching on with disinterest, making comments on Clint’s fighting as  Steve continued to slam into Tony again and again. Tony came with a wail as he felt Steve’s knot expand in his ass. The knot sending aftershocks through him, making him spasm and squirm on the knot endlessly.
Everyone looked to it to see who it was as it was the first exciting thing to happen in the last 20 minutes.
“Sorry, Pete. I didn’t mean it that way. Here why don’t you have this chocolate? One of my friends got it for me when they went over to Ireland. I saved a bar for you because it’s so nice. It’s mint. I know how much you love that.”
“Come on my brave boy. You’re okay. Let’s go get lunch and then you can have a snooze on the way home. Do you want to hold blankey for me?”
“Well, I’ll leave you to it. Bring them down when they feel up to it, though? I want to cuddle my nephews for a little while.” With that, she stood up, gave a small salute and walked to the open elevator.
Natasha nodded as if she was expecting that answer. Steve and Tony stayed silent, waiting on her response. She was known to pause to gather her thoughts before she did. “I know that at the start we weren’t happy with how things turned out, and what our lives were now, being compelled by certain aspects of ourselves…” she paused for a moment, organising her words, “but, I can’t say I regret it when I see so many people that needed to be taken care of getting that. We have better infrastructure in place so that no one slips through the cracks. This world is thriving more than the other one was, and I know I’m supposed to miss it, but when I see Peter and Bucky so happy? So content and taken care of? How can I argue that we need to go back to our other world? This one is perfect.”
I have been away from this story for ages. Please let me know what you think! Comments and Kudos are much appreciated as always.
Finally, he sat back and looked up at his Dad, who smiled down at him. Peter loved that smile. It was so different from his press smile or his meeting smile. There was something softer about this smile that changed his Dad’s face completely, making it more relaxed.
Peter nodded sullenly, ignoring Harley grinning at him. He supposed he’d have to make do with lab time with Harley this weekend. That would be fun. He could probably even wrangle a later bedtime. He knew his Dad would cave if he asked. He just had to make sure Papa wasn’t around to make sure he went to bed early, which was doable because Papa wasn’t a huge fan of the lab and liked his alone time when they were busy there.
Bucky was not going to be happy one bit when he woke up, Peter distinctly remembered Mama saying that Daddy would carry him into the centre.
“Okay sweetheart, I believe you.” Peter poked his tongue out at his Papa and undid his belt before hopping out of the now parked car. He waited where he was, knowing his Papa would be annoyed if he moved from where he was until he was beside him.
There's a surprised, pleased little noise in the back of his throat before Tony can really think twice about it. He kisses back immediately, hands finding Steve's hips and using the beltloops on his jeans to pull him closer, press the both of them closer together. There's a pleasant mixture of electricity and energy building at the base of his spine, and it takes everything in him to hold back a needy whine. Instead, when he breaks off the kiss, he goes straight for kissing down Steve's neck, a teasing nip here and there for good measure. He lets out a huff when the back of his knees hit the mattress and he goes down, pulling Steve down with him. "Jeans," he says between kisses, hoping that Steve'll understand what he's saying. Sure, their shirts are off, but their shirts aren't exactly the item of clothing that's preventing what he wants to happen.
He shouldn't be here. Not when he's in heat and Steve's in rut. Rhodey would call him crazy if he knew what he was doing -- as it is, Rhodey thinks he's taking some time to get his head straight. But it's too late to turn back now. He's told Steve the address, and that the front door is open, and now all there's left to do is wait. There's an uneasy feeling in his stomach, and his shoulders feel weighed down with the knowledge that he's going to have to tell Steve about the loss of their pup sooner or later, but to tell an alpha in rut something like that probably isn't the best idea. Lord knows Steve's going to be emotional enough as it is.
They both knew he was little for a while now and were treating him as such when he allowed it, mostly when he was tired, and usually he only let Tony coddle him, always claiming it was his ‘Mama instincts’, with Steve he’d glare and move away from him if he tried which frustrated Steve to no end but made Tony laugh.
After the first few hiccups, lunch went quickly and before Peter knew it he was lifted out of the highchair and were leaving. The waitress thanked Mama again. Peter waved from his Mama’s arms, trying not to yawn. He was really sleepy.
Which meant he was going trick or treating and getting so much sweets that he be on a sugar high for a month! It was one of the rare occasions that his Dad and Papa let him have sugary food and he was super happy about it. Of course there were a few stipulations as always. They had to go through the bag and if anything was deemed ‘pure sugar’ then he wasn’t allowed to have it, no matter how much he begged. Papa said he’d collect him today instead of Happy so they could go straight to the tower and get ready while they waited on Dad to be finished in his meeting.  Nothing could get him down today! Not even Flash and his snide comments could make him lose the buzz he was on. He looked at the clock impatiently, why did time seem to be moving extra slow today? Didn’t anyone know he had some sugary goodness to get to.
“You need a black nose as well.” He declared, handing the face paint to his Papa who was struggling with the tie around his neck. “You do it, Papa. You’re the artist. Mama can do your tie while you do his nose.”
“So, once Thanos clicked his fingers and half of the universe's population was gone we used what Strange told us to go back and destroy the stone before they ever became a thing. The only problem with that was with the soul stone, it seemed to have its own entity in it, from what we can assume is an accumulation of the souls that were trapped in there over the years for whatever reason.” He stopped and looked at the two, “Still following me?”
“It was too and I don’t appreciate the lack of sympathy Bucky.” Tony glared up at him, causing Bucky to grin.
“I have something for you to wear but it’s not clothes. Around the tower, there’s no need. Especially this week with your training. This though, I want you to wear it all the time, okay?”
Peter nodded, putting on his most serious face. Tony bit back a smile at how adorable he looked. “I promise to look after his Mama. Bucky won’t be sad at all by the time we go to the test! I go too?” No way was Peter letting Bucky go through that by himself. He had to protect his little brother at all costs.
“Why aren’t you happy with me?” He questioned, unsure of what he did to have Tony’s ire directed at him.
“Okay. Let’s go have some food. I’m sure Harley and Mama are already there.” Steve said standing Peter up before hopping up himself. He was watching Peter closely enough to see him stiffen.
Peter lay down and relaxed, delighted that his uncle Bucky was here as well. There was one thing bothering him though. “Papa, am I not too old for all of this?” He asked. No one else in school seemed to have schedules as he did, or naps got spankings still.
Peter didn’t know it but they were trying to stop the jealousy from arising by giving him his favourite things today, like an unhealthy lunch (or as unhealthy as Steve was willing to go) and having some chocolate.
“Let’s go, bambino. I think it’s time for you to go to bed and then tomorrow you can eat as much as you like.” Tony said, giving Peter a pointed look when he took one of the seats instead of the car seat that was specially designed for Peter.
Clint could see why, Tony looked completely blissed out, hips moving back and forth, working the last of Steve’s knot. His legs were splayed wide open on either side of Steve, giving Clint a clear view of just how hard he was working the knot. “Sure thing Cap.” He nearly choked on his pasta when he opened what he now realised was a storage space and not just a decorative piece. Every type of sex toy imaginable was in this box that the lid on the inside labelled them as ‘Tony’s toys’. Steve was serious about this whole ‘Traditional Alpha’ route he was taking. He’d only heard about boxes like these mentioned on television. They were common in traditional households so that the Omega knew each room was equipped to deal with them should the need arise with their Alpha. Obviously, Steve was prepared to have Tony as his Omega because this had arrived at the tower a few months ago. There was dildo of all shapes and sizes, along with butt plugs, some of them had wires and remotes while some were of the old school variety. Anal beads, prostate massagers, a few different kinds of fleshlights, penis pumps, there was also chastity cages, why there was so many Clint couldn’t fathom, he only had one cock right? Along with different types of paddles and nipple clamps. Poor Tony, Steve was going to do a number on him with his training. He found the blue box quickly enough within the ottoman, everything else was put in loosely but neatly so it stood out. It was a long and wide box that had a good weight to it with three little-hinged locks and made Clint curious. Food could wait, he wanted to know what was in the box. He brought it over to Steve who was whispering quietly in Tony’s ear while playing with the come that was over Tony’s stomach always keeping his hand away from Tony’s angry looking cock.
It still takes entirely longer than either of them would like, to work Tony open comfortably around two fingers, and then again to three. By the time that Tony’s ready, Steve’s a mess, growling an almost constant, unbroken sound, nipping a little harder at his scent glands, than he typically would. Tony’s scent in the room is thick enough, that if there were any neighbors in the vicinity, Steve would be overly worried about throwing them off season.
He takes a step back from the ledge he’s been staring down, unlocking his phone, without turning his eyes away from the two figures that he’s watching, entirely too far off, to hear him speak. “Hullo?”
“Hey, baby. Can you tell me what’s going on?” Tony shakes his head, and as frustrated as that makes Steve, he’s sure to keep his face neutral. The last thing he needs, is to further set off Tony’s anxiety, by emoting too strongly, and making it seem like he’s mad at him, too. Steve’s just opening his mouth to speak again, when there’s a soft whir to indicate a message from FRIDAY.
“son of a /bitch/!” Steve progresses from 'functionally not a person’ to 'wide the fuck awake’ in something like a 2.5 interval. He's moving as fast as he can, laying Bucky out, and making sure his airway is as free as possible. Once that's done, he's vaulting out of the bed, making for the closet as quick as he humanly can. There isn't a lot in the closet here to be honest, there's some clothes, from all the nights he's spent here, and there are a few boxes he's never sorted from the last time they cleaned the main house. None of that is what he's looking for though. His hands are frenzied, knocking things over, until he finds a small wooden box that he rips open-- breaking the latch in the process but oh fucking well-- to dump it's contents. It's a tiny thing, all things considered, the plastic device he has in his hand, but it's big in every other way. His hands fumble as he rips the sterile packaging away, and gets back in the bed, straddling Bucky's hips. “Tony, tell dispatch he's had narcan, 4mg nasal spray!” He shouts iut without looking. No time. he puts the plastic applicator into Bucky's nostril, depresses the button, and prays. “Come on, baby, come on.” He mutters lowly, panic settling in his gut firmly. It's entirely possible, give his history, that Bucky is gonna need more than one dose, but Steve only has one more, and then they're fucked until Ems arrives.
"You live above an art gallery?" His first immediate question about that is whether or not it means that Steve likes art, or whether it's a place bought merely out of convenience - cheap rent or the like. He doesn't exactly know why it feels important, but Jessica's always talking about trusting gut instincts and curiosity, so he does that. "I'll be honest, didn't imagine someone who looks like you having an interest in art."
A sweet looking brunette nurse holding a clipboard pokes her head out of room 6-16, and smiles tiredly at Steve. “Captain Rogers? We have some information for you on your husband.”
“Which is how I know you’re fucking with me.” he smiles now, and it’s a slight thing, but god, is it distracting. “That has to be the most hipster shit I’ve ever heard.” Clint laughs again, and this time, there’s no guarding there at all. Which is… yeah, should be concerning.
“I’ve missed you.” It’s a difficult thing to admit for someone as emotionally closed-off as Tony tends to be, but he has a feeling that Steve feels the same way, so he’s a little less hesitant about saying something he’d typically file under: ‘Romantically cheesy. Never Speak Aloud.’
“Hmm, you're a year older than me then.” His voice comes out much thinner and raspier than he wants it to, and he distracts from it, by tracing over a scar on Tony's collarbone. It looks nasty, like it may have been a bullet hole. Steve smiles softly, in sympathy. “Looks like it hurt.” He keeps his voice low, judgement free.
“thing about comas, is you don’t exactly know what’s gonna happen. They pulled my life support, which meant the G tube I had in, but I was still breathing by myself. So while they waited for me to waste away… I dunno, I recovered. Miraculously. They didn’t think I was gonna make it but… I did.” Ed sighs, and again, tears well up in his expressive brown eyes. In Tony’s eyes, for all intents and purposes. “but not before Steve gave up. He kept taking missions, the entire time I was down, to… I don’t know, distract himself, I guess? After they pulled the plug, on the last mission he… he just gave up. Let himself get gunned down. I woke up three days later.”  Ed’s last few words echo in the space between them, and on a constant loop in Steve’s head ‘I woke up three days later. I woke up three days later. Three days later’… Steve feels completely guted, and the confession is enough to make him sink back into the chair and drop his head into his hands.
The hi he gets back isn't exactly he most encouraging thing, but he didn't exactly give Tony much to work with, did he? Three letters, one word, does not a best selling novel, or a good conversation make. He pines about what to say in response for so long that he just about decides that he's entirely socially inept. This shouldn't be so hard. Not with Tony. Tony, of all people, who’s been as good as his other half for almost as long as he’s been out of the ice. He sighs.
The newcomer sneers, obnoxiously, and raises a placating hand, that Steve sees as pure aggression. “Relax. You want me here.” Steve scoffs blatantly.
try to kick you, so, uh, be prepared for that?" He doesn't bother asking what Steve's work is, exactly, because he figures that if Steve wanted him to know, he would say. And the warning about kicking is only because it's a reflex from all the times he falls asleep at their main safehouse and Clint has to wake him the following morning to ensure he's not dead, hasn't been poisoned, or hit and not noticed.
“It's alright ma'am.” He gives her a half expectant half pleading look. “can I see him?” She makes a quiet little nervous noise, and shifts her weight.
shot me, and I'm pretty sure I'd still want to be with you," he says, and he ignores the slight scoff that earns from Clint over by the doorway. "Clint, call your contact and give them the codeword. We're fine here, okay? No one's in any danger, and I'm sure they need more help with the mission tonight. Just...give us some room to talk." Clint hesitates, glances from Bucky to where Steve and Tony are standing, and huffs out a breath.
“so, bodyguard.” Steve mutters to himself. It’s really not that bad of a job, low pressure compared to super heroing, and it’s not like he doesn’t have the body, the training, and the aptitude for it. “Who’s the target?”
Bucky glances over at Tony, like he knows any more about this than Bucky did. Tony shrugs slightly, chooses to sit down in the armchair when Bucky takes one of the spaces beside Steve—despite his brief encounters with drugs, Tony’s area of expertise related more to alcohol and its draws, so he figures it’s best to leave this one for Bucky to field. “Stevie,” he says, low and careful, and Tony might be reading into it too much, but he swears Bucky sounds hurt. He moves to take Steve’s hands in his own, but doesn’t try to make the blonde look at him. “Why didn’t you tell me, doll? You know…Honey, I would’ve helped you, kept you away from it. I don’t…I don’t want you going through what I go through.” Tony tries not to contemplate the very real possibility that his lack of a call for the past three weeks had something to do with this. It seems a little egotistical to think that he drove a guy to drugs, and he figures there’s something bigger that pushed Steve that far, even if the lack of contact aggravated it a little. “What did you take, Steve?” he asks, voice quiet. He’s seen Jessica go through rehabilitation programmes after any falls she has, but he doesn’t know jack-shit about how to help a person other than being there for them.
"Can shower in the morning," he says, and it takes everything in him to bite back a yawn. "And, for the record, I'm twenty-six, not sixty-two; I'll be right as rain in the morning." He might need painkillers for the inevitable hangover in the morning, but that's a different story entirely. He's also not entirely sure how many people he's given his real age to, usually hitting as high as he thinks he can with thirty to thirty-three, and even those earn him some raised eyebrows. That's why he tends to stay behind the metaphorical curtain when it comes to missions. Well, that, and Howard Stark's son isn't supposed to be associated with the mob.
Steve’s mind boggles, and he’s pretty sure that he actually staggers for a moment. He wants to argue, but the words make too much sense, it clears up too many questions. Why Tony’s the CEO of Stark Industries, the interest in Captain America, even the family resemblance, that Steve’d been denying to himself for months now. He can’t think of a single thing to say, and he must look like a fish out of water, his mouth opening and closing repeatedly, with nothing intelligent coming out. Tony smiles softly, and nods, like he’d gotten the answer to a question he’d been asking for a long time.
"If he didn't feel the same, I'm pretty sure there would've been a lot more yelling and cursing you out this morning, not telling you that he'll call you." "But," he adds after a second, his usual smirk tugging at the corners of his lips, "you are a pansy. Think the way you just described our first time goes to prove that." Before Steve can get offended or defensive, Bucky tilts his chin up, kisses him. "It's cute."
"'m ready," he says, breathless. "So, so ready. Please, alpha, please. I've missed you so much. Need your knot." As if to emphasize his point, Tony shifts how he's positioned so he's presenting properly: head pressed against the pillow, supporting himself on his elbows, and his ass in the air for Steve, ensuring there's a slope to his spine. After a second, he manages another broken, "Please."
He can fill in some of the blanks, himself. If they’re talking about drugs-- and in this neighborhood, and those ‘obviously doing something nefarious’ looks, they were-- there’s a good chance that Davis, meant Aaron Davis. But the problem with that, is that… well, Davis is on of theirs. He’s a bit of a loose cannon, he’s a fucking drug dealer, after all, but the guys got a decent head on his shoulders. So for his product to be killing kids, in the hunts territory, has to mean that either A: they have a problem further up the supply chain, someone flooding the market with bad chemicals, or B: Davis has gone rogue. Either way, means more paperwork, for Clint. He sighs heavily, and scratches his fingers through Lucky’s soft fur.
“I’m sorry?” he asks softly, shaking his head. It’s so rare that he doesn’t hear things these days, he must be really out of it. Dehydration maybe, or hunger, though he doesn’t currently feel it. The medic clears her throat and tries again.
When he wakes up the next morning, the first thing Tony notices isn’t the pain that flares up in the lower half of his body when he tries to move, nor the fact that the alarm on the bedside table reads that it’s half past two in the afternoon (they were both less than sober, stayed up half the night fucking, so it’s not really a wonder that they slept for so long). No, the first thing Tony notices is the feeling of a warm arm underneath him, and another thrown over his waist. He knows he needs to get up, that this is typically the part where he sneaks out and, this time, will ignore any lingering feelings he might have, but he rolls over in Steve’s arms instead. He watches him for a couple seconds, as creepy as that sounds. With the curtains pulled over, he can almost pretend that the filtered light is coming from an early morning sun instead of a mid-afternoon one, and part of him desperately wants to know what Steve is like in the mornings, after nights he hasn’t spent in clubs and getting stoned. Tony leans forward, kisses his nose. When Steve makes some kind of sound that lets Tony know he’s awake, he smiles a little, shifts closer and tries to content himself with just…existing for the next few minutes.
Tony said yes. He actually agreed to see Steve, to be in the same place with him after months of stereo silence. Steve whines softly, as he pushes himself up to sitting in the bed.
Steve’s brain is caught up in a loop of “oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.” And his thought process is much much slower than he’d like for it to be. He’s still trying to connect the dots of why Bucky’s here, how he knew where he was, and why the hell he looks so pissed, when he hears the barely there whisper of ‘red star’. The gallery is two stories tall, and Steve’s pretty sure his heart drops a good five. “Tony, wait”, he pleads, coming closer to the edge of the bed, where the brunette has escaped. He can’t think of anything to say that doesn’t sound like the most cliché thing. He wants to tell Tony it’s an open relationship, because it is, but that’s going to sound like a lie right now, because if it was, why wouldn’t he have said so in the beginning? Because this was supposed to be a one night stand. Right. Steve sighs, and looks to Bucky for help. “Bucky… Bucky, Jesus Christ!”
He’d be lying if he said he was disappointed to see Pepper the next time he woke up, but a small, niggling part of him wished it was Steve’s perfectly coiffed blonde locks in the chair next to his bed.
“Our good friends at A.I.M. are to thank for this delightful Project Runway-ruining interruption,” Tony said, crouching down to examine the device more closely. “Fury, get Richards on the line, I want him seeing this.”
“Family of Tony Stark?” a nurse called out, and visibly started when six superheroes suddenly appeared in front of her with inhuman speed.
Steve looked through the document, identifying it as a to-do list from Tony’s “Shit to Get Done” title. Most of the items were fairly bland - sign SI papers, repair the suit, review R&D designs. Scrolling down, the sight of his own name made him stop.
Tony wasn’t used to knowing other people's’ schedules. Even when he and Pepper were dating, he relied on Jarvis to inform him of where she was and what she was doing. This was a strange sort of intimacy he’d developed with the team. The kind of intimacy he’d expected he could have had with his parents, had they been different people.
Steve Rogers had never run from a fight in his goddamn life, and he intended to maintain that record.
Tony flipped up the visor to stare at the little green creatures, who were scrambling all over the street like over-excited puppies. They looking something like a cross between cats and salamanders, with sharp, upturned ears and long tails. Every once and a while, one of them would flick out it’s tongue, knocking over signs and cafe chairs and the occasional dumpster.
“Be there in half a minute, my friend,” Tony said, wincing at the ‘friend’. Shutting the phone off, he smiled apologetically at Pepper. “Hate to discuss and dash, but there’s a city to be saved.”
What these men didn’t seem to realize was that getting two people together was one of the easiest things in the world, even with stubborn asses like Steve and Tony. All it took was a little bit of alcohol.
“Don’t worry, Tony,” Steve laughed as he walked into the room, a tray of food in each hand. “There’s plenty more where that came from.”
A tidal wave of relief crashed through Steve’s limbs, leaving his hands shaking and his knees weak. Thor tightened his hold on his shoulder, and exchanged a happy grin with Bruce.
Clint looked up as he sat down next to them. “Fury’s apprised of the situation, and Thor and Bruce will be heading over here as soon as they get done with cleanup, which should be pretty soon. Pepper’s approved us all as next of kin so the doctor will let us know as soon as they have any updates.”
Steve nodded, swooping in to help Natasha fend off one of the creatures, then grabbing her around the waist and tossing her up and over the crowd of goblins. She landed gracefully on the awning of a cafe, aiming her Widow’s bites at their feet, keeping them corralled. Steve grasped Tony’s arm briefly, eyes shining on Tony’s screen.
“Now, Thor!” Tony shouted. The god aimed Mjolnir at the center of the group of goblins and released a bolt of lightning, just as Tony fired his repulsors at the same spot. The two beams of energy met in the middle, and Tony squinted as the intensity of the light grew to nearly unbearable brightness. Suddenly, the ball of energy exploded, sending the monsters - and Tony - tumbling through the street.
He wasn’t sure why he was so desperate. But there was this ache in his gut telling him that something was
And that was the other part of the problem - Steve was about as ramrod straight as a flagpole, and twice as virtuous as the American flag. Tony knew that he accepted new societal norms fairly easily, and he’d barely batted an eye when Tony told him he was bisexual. But Steve didn’t seem to be the kind of person to swing his way, even if Tony wasn’t already a notorious playboy.
“This is criminal,” Tony complained. “I mean, this is really the worst of the worst. What kind of sick, twisted person interrupts Project Runway?”
“Sir, yes sir,” Tony saluted, and spiraled upwards to blast a couple more of the ugly flying creatures down. “Jarvis, how are we doing on locating the originating signal?”
So, not only had Tony gone and made the mistake of falling in love, he’d managed to fall in love with the most unattainable person in the world. Sometimes, he questioned the validity of his genius status.
He couldn’t ask Tony to suffer through the conflict that his coming out was sure to bring, couldn’t ask him to have his name be raked through mud, to be accused of sullying the “pure” Captain America with his salacious ways.
“Whoever it is, we’re going to have to figure out what AIM wants with the technology now that they have it,” Clint chimed in. “I doubt dinosaur stampedes are their ultimate goal.”
There was a hint of fondness and amusement in her voice that too closely echoed Rhodey’s smile from the night before, as if they were both in on a secret he didn’t know. Normally, that would have driven him crazy, but for the moment he was content to let it be, instead allowing her gentle breathing to lull him into a daze. By the time Clint returned, with a nurse and an unusually quiet Thor in tow, he was already fast asleep.
“Bruce is with Richards,” Clint said, “trying to figure out how that thing that A.I.M built brought Jurassic Park to New York.”
Sure enough, Steve was in the gym when they arrived, studiously beating a punching bag to a pulp. He waved at them when they walked in, but immediately resumed his workout. Thor frowned. If he was distracted, the plan might not work….
“Sure,” Steve agreed readily, giving Tony a dopey grin. Tony blushed, focusing his attention back on the bottle of chemicals he was holding in his unbound hand - Thor’s attempt at matchmaking had left him with a sprained wrist. Bruce rolled his eyes, then turned to switch out the bottles he had.
Steve sat back, stunned. He had mentioned a couple of months ago that it felt weird to know that his first shield, from the war, was sitting unused in a vault in the Smithsonian, only to be trotted out during the annual Captain America display around the Fourth of July. Even if he hadn’t had a sentimental attachment to the shield, he grew up poor in the forties - even now, with enough backpay to keep him living comfortably for the rest of his forseeable life, and a billionaire as a best friend, it just felt wasteful for Tony to have to dig up the vibranium to make a new shield. However, when he had asked the museum for the shield back, the curator had talked around him about “national heritage” and a “gift to the country” until he couldn’t remember what he had been asking in the first place.
Steve glanced up at the genius, blinking blearily. “I, uh, think I’m trying to make a toy for Dum-E?”
But Tony? Tony was all enthusiastic (if a little off-key) singing, a surrogate father to his bots, a man who laughed so hard at Steve’s reaction to the Star Wars reveal that he snorted milk out of his nose. He was genuinely fun, and truly seemed to enjoy catching Steve up to the twenty-first century, whether it be teaching him how to use Google or explaining the difference between the Rolling Stones and Rolling Stone.
Thor Odinson, prince of Asgard, was used to taking a hands-on approach to his problems. He’d never quite mastered the tact and slyness that his brother used so effectively. He was, however, not a complete idiot, and knew that merely mashing the two mens’ heads together and shouting “Kiss!” would probably not be the best approach.
There was a genuine chuckle from Bruce at that one, and Tony couldn't help but feel a little pleased. A month ago, Bruce would have flinched away from references like that.
Tony landed next to Thor, who had gathered with the rest of the team near the entrance to Gramercy Park. “Any particular reason we’re not rushing in to smash them to bits?”
The PTSD, on the other hand, didn't seem to want to quiet down. Despite medication and a S.H.I.E.L.D-issued therapist, Tony still found himself jolting awake in the middle of the night, stars dancing around his head and the sensation of falling heavy in his gut. Some nights, he was able to calm his breathing, close his eyes, and fall back into a fitful sleep. Other nights - most nights, if he was honest with himself - he found himself down in his workshop, updating and redesigning his armor until it may as well have been its own person.
Steve nodded absentmindedly as he processed her words. Suddenly, their full meaning hit him, and he glanced in surprise between Natasha and Tony.
Suddenly, a screech rang out from down the street. One of the goblins reared up on its back legs, retractable claws releasing from its front limbs, and started slashing up a CVS storefront. Immediately, his fellow goo-monsters reacted, claws coming out and the sounds of screeching metal filling the street.
Tony grinned at him. “You’re a million miles away today. What’s going on in the upstairs freezer, Capsicle?”
“Hulk smash?” the Hulk asked hopefully. He’d been tasked with sitting on top of a subdued T-rex, but the big green guy was starting to get antsy.
Tony nodded, letting out an involuntary hiss as the pain in his head spiked. Clint got to his feet, his spine popping. “I’ll find a nurse, see if I can get you some more pain meds.”
“And A.I.M?” he asked. “Any idea what they were referring to when they said they were working with a collaborator?”
He headed out of the kitchen towards the elevator. Steve hesitated, wanting to reach out and comfort the inventor, but unsure if that kind of thing fit within the bounds of their relationship. If it had been Bucky, or any of the other Howling Commandos, he wouldn’t have given it a second thought. But the specter of the things that they said to each other during the attack on New York still lingered, even though their relationship had become much more friendly, and Steve wasn’t sure if the gesture would be appreciated.
Steve nodded, exiting the lab as quickly as he could while still maintaining a semblance of dignity. Once he’d made his escape, he made his way up to the training room to sort out his head.
“If you two are signing insults again I’m going to learn ASL just so I can insult you right back,” Tony piped up from his blanket nest.
“It can’t be that hard,” Bruce mused. “Tony may be stubborn, but he’s not stupid. If we play this right, we can probably get them together by the end of the week.”
“I’d say you’re at a little bit below that time you decided to use the suit as an electrical trigger for an IED and nearly got yourself electrocuted,” Clint said helpfully. “Pepper’s pretty pissed that you went in without backup again. Steve too.”
Dum-E trilled happily, waving his claw up and down. Tony smiled back at him, then reached for the small device. “Alright, let’s see what you’ve made here.”
Clint, of course, was one to talk, because the archer also had a habit of perching in high places and falling asleep with his eyes open, which terrified Tony every time he came into the kitchen looking for a midnight snack.
He was greeted in the kitchen by a stack of pancakes and a fantastic view of Steve’s ass. The supersoldier, wearing a pair of tight running pants that left very little to the imagination, was slaving over the stove, carefully tending to at least two dozen eggs. On the counter next to him sat two plates of pancakes - one regular, one chocolate chip - a heap of bacon, a bowl of fresh cut fruit, and a pitcher of orange juice. The other Avengers were hanging around in various states of repose, squabbling over the crossword and nibbling at Steve’s brunch feast.
He clasped a hand over his heart. “You wound me, Natasha. Everyone wants my input. That’s why I charge such exorbitant consulting fees.”
He staggered back to his feet, making his way over to the nearest bathroom and locking the door behind him. Catching sight of his reflection in the mirror, he hardly recognized the person who looked back at him. He was covered in dust and sweat, a thin trickle of blood on the side of his cheek from where one of the velociraptors had gotten in a lucky swipe. His eyes were sunken and haunted, the eyes of a man who’d lost too much.
Team movie nights were always a fairly intimate event - after the number of times they’d all saved each other, or seen each other naked (though she wasn’t sure Bruce had recovered from the trauma of the time he’d caught Clint and Natasha ‘cooking’ in the communal kitchen), no one here was opposed to a little bit of cuddling. Thor was laid out along the chaise end of the sofa, Natasha’s feet in his lap and her head resting against Clint’s shoulders. Bruce was sprawled on the floor in front of them, his back against Clint’s calves. Tony was curled up in a chair next to Thor, their feet intertwining on the end of the couch, and Steve was next to Bruce, his feet resting on the doctor’s stomach.
He closed his eyes, and Tony’s still face morphed into Bucky’s horrified look as he fell from the train, which morphed into the fierce, heartbroken face of Peggy Carter as they kissed for the first and last time.
“Not the worst you’ve had, sorry to say. Bit of a concussion, broken ribs, punctured lung from the broken ribs. Bumps and bruises from falling off of a six-story tall building.”
“No apologies necessary, Captain,” Rhodes said. “I know Tony. This is hardly the first time I’ve had to sit in a hospital waiting room worrying over his sorry ass.”
“One of our junior agents got too close trying to get radiation readings,” Fury’s voice crackled to life over the earpiece. “They didn’t like that.”
For just a moment, as Steve pulled the cowl off, his tousled blonde hair glinted in the sunlight, a smear of ash on his cheek. His blue eyes connected with Tony’s and Tony swore he saw something hidden in them. He stepped forward, wanting to be closer, but then Steve turned to congratulate Thor on a fight well fought, and the moment was lost. Tony’s heart sank to the concrete as he remembered the absolute truth of his situation.
Wandering over towards the table where he’d built Dum-E’s toy earlier, Steve brushed his hands along some of Tony’s holographic screens, accidentally bringing one to life. Curious, Steve peered closer at the screen. “Jarvis, is this something I can look at?”
“Dinner then,” Tony waved a hand. “I’m pretty sure I haven’t eaten since you brought me that sandwich.”
“Aye,” Thor agreed as he joined them, getting comfortable on the bean bag chair that Clint brought with him when he moved in. “On Asgard, it is a grievous offense to steal a shield brother's meal.”
Tony tries to bite back a grin, knows from experience that it’s a little difficult to kiss effectively when you’re smiling like an idiot, but he can’t really help himself. He does, however, manage to keep a comment about Steve ‘being easy’ to himself, because even if the guy walked right into that one, Tony doesn’t know if it’ll be perceived as a joke or an insult, and he doesn’t want to risk it. “Can’t exactly argue with that kind of logic, now, can I?” is what he voices instead, with something of a crooked smirk before he leans in to kiss Steve again. He’s got absolutely no qualms about making out with him for a while longer if Steve’s content enough to do so, and Tony’s already wondering if it would be too bold to ask for his number, or give Steve his. Alternatively, if he gets his hands on his phone, he can lock onto the signal from Steve’s and hack into it, though placing his number in Steve’s phone that way seems a little creepy, and a whole lot like it would give away that Tony’s not who he says he is. Which is to say, a normal guy with a normal job, albeit Howard Stark’s son.
“Hey, I wasn’t trying to--” clint raises a hand, to stop Tony right there, shaking his head slightly. This always happens, when he brings up the deafness. People trip all over themselves to apologize, even when it has, like now, not a damn thing to do with them. It makes Clint want to scream, but that’s not exactly easy to explain, and doesn’t do much to alleviate the unnecessary apologies. Clint sighs softly.
Steve’s in the kitchen of his apartment, the first time he hears it. The phrase ‘Civil War’, splashed across the bottom of the national news, impartial and unfeeling. The anchor is talking about riots at an apple store, following the release of the newest iPhone. That’s more important news, than the so called ‘Civil War’ between the avengers. The worst goddamn three months of his life, and it’s somehow less interesting, than a couple of white middle age moms mauling each other over a phone that’s less technologically advanced than the ones in their overpriced handbags. Not for the first time in his life, he wonders if coming out of the ice was actually to his own detriment.
“no, not… not really.” He huffs out a dry laugh, and turns away from the lifeless, pale form of his best friend. “we’ve been so damn busy lately, fifteen calls in the last two days, I don’t think he had time to do much more than sleep.” Famike nods, and scribbles down an additional thing, before turning to Steve with what appeared to be a pleasant smile.
“Not sure I should be takin’ advice on what’s sweet, from someone like you.” he says simply, matter of factly. Clint hates the fact that his stomach clenches violently, for reasons that he’s choosing not to define.
"I miss you too," Tony says, voice loud in the quiet bathroom. His fingers are trailing along the scar on the underside of his stomach now, because it would be so easy to tell Steve. It would be so easy to put it all out in the open and get it off his mind, clear his conscience even if he knows he has nothing to feel guilty about. But Steve would. Steve would blame himself and not want to meet up, even if the doctors Tony asked all told him the same thing: the trauma from Siberia isn't what caused the miscarriage. He hesitates for a moment. "Steve?" he says, and doesn't wait for a response before continuing. "Don't... Can you not take scent blockers? I don't... I don't like them -- they make you smell too clinical and not...not like you. I want to be with you, not you on five different medications.” Steve’s shocked, he can’t say he’s not, but he loves this omega than any other thing on the damn planet, and he couldn’t tell him no, if his life depended on it. He swallows thickly, and nods, feeling his stomach flip in nervous anticipation.
Steve goes through the full range of human emotion in the next five or so seconds. Elation. Trepidation. rage, loss, grief, hope, fear, bargaining, hysteria. He goes through so much, so fast, he’s left feeling dizzy, but he manages to settle himself, force himself to focus on what’s important. Ed knows what’s wrong. Ed knows, and he can help, and all Steve has to do, is make sure that it doesn’t affect a timeline. That’s… that’s not that hard, right? He scoots to the edge of the chair he’s sitting on, and fixes Ed with the most solid, unwavering stare that he can manage.
Tony’s working on some kind of prosthesis program, it looks crazy scientific, all bright gleaming metals, and flexible plates that move with a fluidity that seems impossible. A few of the more ‘pet project’ pieces can do truly miraculous things, like repel bullets, and crush with the strength of a coconut crabs claw, but by and large, they’re just arms and legs, and the odd hand, waiting for a recipient.
Steve’s reminded, perhaps morbidly, of wax figures. Made to look lifelike, had the right coloring, and the appearance of who they were meant to model, but… there was just something eerily wrong. All of Tony’s usual, frenetic, brilliance was just gone. Steve couldn’t even say that it looked like he was sleeping, because even in his sleep, he’d never seen Tony Stark look this still. A wave of nausea rolls over him, tightening in his stomach, and he’s quick to look down, try to steady himself again.
"Catch you on a bad day?" he asks, cutting three security feeds entirely. Jessica and Wanda are half a block away from the warehouse they're supposed to be raiding -- infiltrating it undercover before they bring out the big guns, literally. His tone's light, teasing, and he doubts that anyone would think he's in the midst of covering up a hit. Granted, it's a hit to prevent more future murders at the hands of pissed off drug dealers, but it's still a crime. He doesn't wait for Steve to respond, types out a message to Clint on the laptop. Jess and Wanda are going to need a driver, after all.
“I was… awake. For all of it. S-sort of.” Steve makes a pained sound, a quiet little intake of breath, and leans unconsciously closer to Tony.
Bucky gives Steve a look, mutters a, “Could shoot you instead, how about that?” under his breath even though he knows it’s irrational and it’s impulsive. This guy – Tony, Steve said – knows who he is though, means he knows that Steve is connected to Red Star even if he doesn’t know just how crucial Steve is to it, and Bucky can’t risk that getting out. They’ve remained relatively safe up until now, and he doesn’t need Steve’s one-night stand ruining it for them. In a more audible tone, he says, “Nobody can know what we’re involved in, Stevie. People always talk, given the right amount of persuasion. There’s an easy way to stop that from happening.”
“it’s… you’re sure it’s medically important?” she nods, and he sighs. “we were fighting mutants. A rogue group, small. Not particularly powerful, but fast. It… it should have been a routine fight.” His eyebrows knot together in real confusion, as he analyses his memories. He never saw any of the kids get anywhere close to Tony, so what the hell could have happened, to knock him down this badly? There’s a movement at the corner of his periphery, Famike shuffling papers, it would seem, and his attention is pulled back, for another few moments.
Bucky points through a glass pane, toward a corner of a room that’s almost entirely deserted. There’s a large plexiglass… “I-is that a crib?” Bucky scoffs, and rolls his eyes.
Tony’s taking full advantage of the fact that no one can see him, to make the most severe confused face he thinks he’s ever made. This guy, this Ed, if that is his real name, is right in that the Carbonell genes always carried strongly down the lines, but he god one crucial detail wrong. Tony’s mom… she doesn’t have siblings. She has cousins of her own, sure, but none with the direct name, more like Furlanis, and Bianchis. So whoever he is, he’s clearly lying, about something. Tony hangs around, listening and waiting, wanting to see if he could get a better inspection of this guy wearing his face and his name (or… the inversion of his name, same difference, as far as tony is concerned.) but he offers infuriatingly little about himself. eventually, tony gets bored, and begins to wander.
“I know he did. We haven’t met. Not really. Anthony Edward Armstrong, Stark, until ’91, when I found out the heir to the Stark fortune, wasn’t. thanks, Howard.”
Steve's all nerves, pacing the Halls of the gallery proper. Usually, the art helps settle him, sets his mind back to a creative space, but all he can think of now is Tony. Wondering where he is how he's doing, if he's actually going to show. It's madness. When he sees a cab pull to the curb and stop, his heart jumps into his throat violently.
“Don’t apologize. Please, honey, you… we were both wrong.” He steps into the house slowly, moving to the other side of the room, to give Tony as much space as he can afford him. Each step further away pains him physically, and it’s a damn near battle to get to the far wall, where he eventually leans, tucking his hands into his hoodie. This isn’t going to be easy on either of them.
Tony brings his hands up to cup Steve's face gently, pull him into another soft kiss, and he can pinpoint the exact moment he realizes he is well and truly screwed - in more than just a literal sense. He wants to be able to soothe Steve's nerves, assure him that whatever has him shaking isn't worth worrying about, but he can't find any words in him to do so. His legs have fallen off Steve's shoulders, and instead he wraps them around his waist, uses his weight - and the fact that Steve's gone remotely compliant from his orgasm - to move them slowly, until Tony's on top of Steve, straddling him. He leans down, presses another quick kiss to his lips before he moves to his cheeks, his nose, his forehead. He knows he's being overly tender about it, but Steve's shaking is lessening gradually, so it's fine, he reasons. It's worth it if it's doing something to reassure the blonde. Tony might not know what worries he's assuaging, but that doesn't mean he isn't going to do it nonetheless.
A comfortable silence stretches out between them for several long moments, and Steve doesn’t question it, because he doesn’t have to. In these moments of perfect silence, the two of them say much more to each other than words ever could. I love you. You don’t eat enough. I’m scared. You need to sleep more. so much that they haven’t ever bothered to say outright, but it’s all there. Steve’s relaxed enough now, that his mind’s a million miles away, when Bucky speaks again.
“Clint. What’s…” he trails off for a second, and Clint can practically hear the alarm klaxons firing off in his head, as he tracks where exactly this conversation is headed. “When did you last see doctor Cho, isn’t it about time to--”
"I love you too," he says quietly, leaning forward to rest his head against Steve's chest. "You weren't responsible for this, Steve. And I know you would've been a great dad if...if either of us had known, and it had gone differently" Steve smiles softly, thinking of Peter, and his excess of energy, trying to take care of Tony who’s got to be hands down, the worst patient Steve’s ever met. It’s amusing, but he feels a little guilty for smiling at it. Tony’s next words cut straight through him, more than he would have expected, and he shoves the feeling to the side, violently, vowing to spend as little time thinking about it, as possible.
Tony would respond to the fact that Barnes just called him ‘kid’ if it wasn’t for his brain refusing to move past Steve’s sudden confession. He thinks he might throw up, and he’s pretty sure he can’t feel his legs.  he’s painfully aware that he’s likely seconds away from getting shot while he’s just millimetres away from where his jeans (and therefore phone) are lying on the floor, a call for help he so desperately needs to make because he’s not sure how he’s supposed to cope with any of this. There’s also the issue of how he knows who Barnes is, what he’s involved in, and how he’s supposed to come up with a story without blowing his cover. Easier said than done, really, especially given that Steve’s broke his brain in less than two sentences.
He’s just starting to fade out of consciousness, just chasing the little dancing sparkles at the edge of his periphery, when Steve comes over. Sweet, blessed, merciful Steve. Tony sighs loudly. “Oh my god, Capsicle.” Irritatingly, his mouth says nothing, and Steve’s face is a grim, unbroken line. This… this isn’t looking good. The faceplate pops open, and Tony’s relieved, until he sees a look flash across Steve’s face. He looks… sick. Like he’s having a hard time looking at Tony’s face. Yeah, maybe he hadn’t been up to 100% lately. So he might have skipped a day or two shaving, but there’s no need to look like
is this a healthy poly relationship? not really. do i condone this type of poly? of course not. does it work out for them, in this specific instance? it's stuckony.
Nick Fury, the most stern faced person Steve’s ever seen-- aside from the exception of Colonel Phillips, who perpetually looked like his son had just told him that he wanted to become a professional unicyclist—sits heavily on a wheeled office chair in front of the too cushy couch that some agent showed Steve to, after they’d finally convinced him out of the gym that he’d been haunting like some malevolent ghost. The director asks Steve if he wants to take the shield and cowl back up, assures him that his secret identity from the ‘40’s was never revealed, even after they’d declared him KIA, and the only response that Steve can think of, is derisive laughter. It isn’t exactly in keeping with manners, but then, those seem more like a suggestion than anything in this strange age, and Steve thinks, maybe, that it can be excused.
“S’alright, Tony,” Clint assures him. He doesn’t have his bow, only has the pistols hidden under his jacket in the shoulder holsters, but they’ll be found and confiscated if Steve or Bucky have enough wits to pat him down, and he’s not entirely sure he can take them on with his fists without Bucky killing Tony. And if Tony dies, Pepper’ll murder Clint before she sets the entirety of Red Star’s territory on fire. “This doesn’t have to turn into a firefight, fellas. We all put any weapons down, I call my contact with the codeword to call them off, and we talk this out. Nobody’s here to harm either of you, and there’s little reason for you to harm us.”
“Clint,” Tony says, a note of warning in his voice. He knows that Clint wouldn’t be acting so cocky if he didn’t have a back-up plan, but he’d appreciate being clued in on what it was. If he has to guess, he’s saying that Clint was smart enough to call somebody before he came into the building. Whether or not that someone’s on their way is a different matter entirely, but he can hope.
Tony’s not stupid and he’s certainly not piss-drunk (yet), so he’s more than a little suspicious that somebody’s being so forward given that they’ve literally just met. He’s used to guys flirting right away – in places like this, they never really seem to want to waste any time, like Tony’s going to be distracted by a stray butterfly or something – but the flirting usually starts out more…subtly than this. A smile here a too-fake-laugh at something that definitely isn’t a joke there. Kissing his hand and talking about bed…Tony’s simultaneously turned on and terrified. His first thought is that Clint’s sent the guy over, or that he knows him somehow and has paid him in advance to do this, maybe as a joke to teach Tony about staying within the safe zone. That’s dismissed when he chances a glance over to the bar and sees Clint talking with Karen, not paying any attention to the floor.  Second thought is that this is somebody who wants to murder him – he’s not quite sure how anybody would’ve gotten hold of who he is and what he really does though – and third is that maybe this is real. Or as real as a one night stand can get.
Tony’s torn between immediately assuring Steve that they’ll be able to meet again, and slapping him. On the one hand, if what he’s saying about him and Barnes being in an open relationship is true, then the only wrong Steve’s committed is not telling Tony that he’s married, explaining the situation. On the other hand, Barnes looks just shy of murderous and Tony’s pretty sure that the only thing stopping him from being shot dead is the fact that Steve’s using himself as a human shield, which means Barnes isn’t exactly happy; there’s the whole ‘sleeping with the enemy’ problem; and there’s the issue of him not checking in with Pepper in now nearly sixteen hours. If Barnes doesn’t kill him, Pepper will. There are many more negatives than positives, but Tony’s apparently the rat that repeatedly presses the button to shock itself, because he can’t bring himself to give an outright no. He lets go of Steve’s hands, reaches over to grab his jeans and tug them on.
“I’d compliment your for Karpov, but that was three months of border fights for us. Nearly lost us midtown, and cost me personally 15k.” Yeah. He’s got a grudge. Clint shrugs, slow and easy with his hands kept where they are, unwilling to chance being shot (not that he hasn’t survived bullet wounds before, but something tells him Steve shoots to kill).
Immediately, Tony's worried. If there's something that's happened in the last three weeks and Steve hasn't told Bucky about it, it has to be bad. He doesn't immediately say anything about that though, instead reaches out to gently lift Steve's chin back up, make him look him in the eyes instead of down at the floor.
“I didn’t… I didn’t realize the addiction had gotten so bad, Steve. I used to go to AA every week, and then I just… I got busy. One drink became two, became three, became more days drunk than there were sober. We were so busy last week, so many people to fight, I guess… I wasn’t drinking as much. that combined with my heart issues, caused me to have a seizure. One wouldn’t have been much of a damage, but I got electrocuted by one of the mutant kids in the last fight, and the shock set my brain off again. not enough time to recover between seizures, made it just sort of… give up.”
“I like it rough,” he says, and hopes that the blush creeping up his neck can be passed off as a result of the kissing. “I want you to push me, until I think I can’t take it. And then I want you to push me more.”
If self-preservation (a thing that Steve was beginning to think might have been a foreign concept for Tony) wasn’t reason enough to prove that he couldn’t be Iron Man, Peter and Harley, were. The kids were Tony’s sons, and from what Steve could see, the light of his life, though he seriously doubted he’d ever admit that out loud. For one, they both tended to have a competitive streak, and saying that would probably start world war three, in regards to who exactly was /more/ the light of his life.
Tony mumbles something completely incoherent, and even he's not too sure what he's meant to be saying. He presses his face against Steve's hand though, and it takes a considerable effort to not fall straight back asleep with the comfort the gesture provides him. He doesn't kick out though, has enough awareness about him to recognize that he's not in the safehouse, is still in Steve's apartment. He doesn't know how long he's been out for, but it feels like a lot longer than thirty minutes, and he doesn't think there's enough light to suggest that it's morning, but his back's to the window, and Steve always could have shut the blinds.
be the truth, can it? It’s… preposterous. Steve shakes his head, and stares at Tony, his blue eyes beseeching.
"Missed you." It feels like the umpteenth time he's said it recently, but there's something better about saying it in person.
him. Or. My universes version of him. C’mon frozone, you can’t tell me that you haven’t laid out under the stars on a summer night, and just wondered if there were other places. Other whole worlds with other people just like us.” He trails off, and Steve’s only response is a slight frown. The worst part is that no, he really can’t say he hasn’t done just that. More than once. Ed continues, like Steve’s response was never really important anyway. “and if there can be other worlds, cap, why not other universes? Huh? Why not other places just like this big blue marble that are different, in one way, or a zillion?” Steve ‘humphs’ softly.
“Comes with the territory.” he shrugs. “Kinda need to know the competition. Mob life isn’t exactly the friendliest profession.” though, he does summon over the bartender, and order another of the dark red abominations in front of the Hunts enforcer. Clint reaches for his wallet, and Bucky shakes his head. “Like I said. On the house.” the air seems charged between them, for a moment or two, while they wait for the tender to come back, with a second square cut glass, chilled, this time, because Bucky actually likes himself. He takes a slow drink, waiting for the burn of something awful.
The kiss is relatively chaste, though it’s lingering and slow. It isn’t rushed, there’s no urgency, it’s patient, and giving, like everything that cheesy songs, sappy poetry says it should be. It probably only lasts a few seconds, but as Steve pulls away, he feels like years could have passed, outside of the perfect bubble of calm that they’re surrounded in. his breath comes with difficulty for a few more beats, and his lips where they’d touched Tony’s, feel absolutely electric. He huffs out a quiet breath, and leans to rest his forehead against Tony’s, a touch that the brunette leans into, which makes Steve feel like he belongs in a way he never had, even in his own time.
“you might say that. Always saw myself as one, anyhow.” He turns back to look through the small window on the door, the glass reinforced with wire mesh, to prevent shattering. “y’know, I served my country three times. Back when no one wanted to give me a chance. I still remember what it was like when people like me were considered crazy.” He laughs softly, and shakes his head softly. “kids these days have it so much easier. They can make their own futures.” Tony smirks softly, and folds his arms across his chest defensively, for no particular reason whatsoever.
Steve turns to look at the rest of the team, worn thin and ragged, several of them looking like they’re only a moment or two from dropping to the ground from pure exhaustion. Steve nods, gently, to himself.
“I wasn—” Tony doesn’t even finish his sentence, before Rhodey is rolling his eyes, and preparing to turn back to his file, and there’s another pathetic whimper that comes from the vicinity of the overstuffed chair Tony’s occupying. “I
Alright. first things first. this chapter is... major. there is graphic description of a opiate based overdose here, I will warn you if this is triggering to you, or if you are in an addict in recovery, tread /carefully/. this was triggering for me to write. feel free to head over to my tumblr @thejovialkynnadyg-ray if you want to ask questions or if you want me to explain a bit more about what happens.
“Tony, oh my God, baby!” He cringes, as soon as the term of endearment slips out, but it's too late. He's
“Are… Are you wearing a fucking ‘save Ferris’ shirt?” Steve prime looks down, at the grey T shirt in question and shrugs, like it’s nothing.
Tony adjusts the blanket that he’d just laid down in the crib, (which absolutely, isn’t Captain America Themed.) and sighs. “It’s not like I can just send you down to the store to pick up diapers in the middle of the night, Steve.”  The alpha winces slightly, and Tony whines quietly, taking a few steps closer, and brushing his fingers through Steve’s overgrown hair.
“You could say that,” he mutters, mostly to himself, as he sets about turning the faucets off when he deems there to be enough water in the bath. Tucking the phone between his ear and his shoulder—because putting it on speaker seems so far detached from anything remotely personal, for some reason he can’t parse right now—he unscrews the cap of a bottle of bubble solution, one that smells vaguely like the cologne Steve used to wear. Tony is unfortunately aware of how pathetic that sounds, which is why he’s never, ever going to admit to it aloud. “I can’t be there, though,” he adds after a moment, when there are far too many bubbles forming in the water. He’ll get lost under there. His voice is soft, but this time Steve’s meant to hear it. “You know that, right? I can’t—God, Steve, you know I’d love to be able to run away with you to…wherever the hell you are, but the UN would pick up on that immediately. I just…I wish I could turn back time, and tell our past selves to figure out some other way. But that’s not exactly a doable thing, huh?” He’d also tell himself from before the ‘civil war’ that he was pregnant, and to not do anything stupid, but too late for that. And Steve doesn’t need to know that either.
Steve’s eyes are closed, and he’s in all honesty probably closer to sleep than he is, wake. The two bundles that he’s holding on his chest are tiny, wiggly little people, and Tony’s heart swells in his chest, to the point that he wonders if he’s a risk for another heart attack. He reaches out with a nervous finger, and lightly touches one of the pups’ face, dragging his fingertip through  a mop of dark brown curls, not unlike his own. He’s so captivated by the tiny human in front of him, that the deep growl that splits the air around him, scares him enough to make him jump.
Tony doesn’t even think before he responds to that message, an ugly anger welling up somewhere deep in his belly.
there's a difference in cerebral and corporeal. there are lines in the sand, that can't be blurred, one isn't the other, they can't be compared. This is a one night stand, it's purely about sex. so, why does it hurt like this? why does it feel like Tony's held the broken parts of Steve in his hands, the parts no one else can see?
"What have I gotten into, this time around? I know that I had sworn, I'd never trust anyone again, but I didn't have to. You had me at hello." You Had Me at Hello, A Day To Remember.
Steve feels himself blush, and he nods, digging his hands further into his pockets. He’s still death glaring the floor, like he has a personal grudge with it, and wondering what to say, so he doesn’t exactly notice Tony stepping closer, until a gentle hand is resting on the side of his face, right over his jawline. Under normal circumstances, Steve would probably startle, probably step back, but this is Tony, and he’s more comfortable with him than he is any other human being alive on the face of the planet so it kind of makes sense that all he does, is look up and smile softly.
kind," Clint says, and anything remotely close to friendliness is gone from his tone. "We wanted you dead, you'd already be dead. Tony didn't know who you are, didn't know that you were married to Barnes. Hell, I didn't know prior to three days ago. And the only person who does know, doesn't know that Tony's hooking up with you. Hunt members die on your turf, you're looking at a war, Rogers. Given that we've recently taken in more recruits, I'm betting we have more expendable man power than you. Tony's not a mole. Thought he might've actually been doublecrossing the Hunt when I found out about you two."
There’s a moment, a brief, flickering thing, where Steve’s eyes are still unsure, but it’s gone almost as soon as it starts, and he growls loudly, the sound ripping through the room in its ferocity. He flashes forward, and pulls tony into a kiss so desperate, it’s got to be just off of bruising. He rolls them gently, and pins tony to the mattress face down, easily. One hand comes up to grip at the back of his neck, his fingers digging in, in just the right spots, to be an effective scruff. Tony goes all but boneless underneath him, and Steve growls lowly in pleasure.
“Mine.” He says softly, a rough whisper in Tony’s left ear, before biting the lobe, just enough to be an added layer of sensation. “Mine, Tony, god damn, I’ve missed saying that.”
Tony tells dispatch what Steve shouts to him, resists the urge to roll his eyes when the lady on the line tells him that not panicking is key here. She asks him to stay on the line until EMS arrive, informs him that the nearest on-patrol ambulance is only one minute away, and Tony wonders which god is watching over them tonight. The bad news is she’s giving him more information, maybe hoping to calm him down while Steve works to kickstart Bucky’s breathing again, and the ambulance headed for them is one from the Hunt’s territory. He knows, logically, that the nearest hospital is in Pepper’s terf, and that she might try to murder both Steve and Bucky if she figures out who they are, but he also knows he can’t really let that happen. “Steve, nearest hospital’s sided with the Hunt,” he says, hand over the receiver so the lady can’t overhear him. He watches Bucky’s chest, waits for a rise, doesn’t get one. “Forty-two seconds until EMS arrive,” he mutters, glancing over to the clock again.
It takes every little scrap of will that Steve has left, not to break down in tears all over again, but he's not exactly sure over what. Relief, because Tony isn't angry, because they're finally talking. Hope, because those words are what he's been craving to hear, since he dropped the shield. Terror, because what if it's all a trap. What if this is to lure him back Home, and hand him over to the UN on a silver platter. Worse, what if it's not, and he manages to fuck it up again, ruins whatever chance they could have had? Eventually, he realizes he's been quiet too long and he sighs, attempting to gather his thoughts.
Steve's completely gutted with that one single text, and he stares at the screen so long, he feels his eyes start to go unfocused and tingly. So this is it, then.  The way the best relationship he ever had ends, is with bitterness, and insults.
There’s nothing, but the sound of Steve’s breaths, haggard and harsh in the quiet antiseptic laced air around them, for several long moments. When he finally calms down enough, to speak, his voice is rough with raw emotion. “you… what?” Ed scoffs, andturns away, so similar to the way Tony is, when upset with himself.
"Don't have to apologize," Tony says softly, kissing up Steve's neck and finishing with his lips. "You've got your important work done. And I got sleep. Win-win."
“Tony. Tones. Do not.” Rhodey’s staring at Tony over an Air Force debrief he’s skimming through on the StarkPad in his lap. Tony hasn’t moved a single muscle, except to fiddle with the burner phone in his right hand, in the last half hour, and if anything spells trouble, it’s Tony Stark sitting still. The engineer doesn’t dignify him with a response at first, and really he’d be offended, if it didn’t mean that Tony was deep in thought about something. Which, again, isn’t exactly a good sign. Add all of that, the stillness, the extreme concentration, the fucking burner phone in his hand is painting a picture that Rhodey is damn certain that he doesn’t like.
He knows, before he’s in earshot of the hut, that Bucky’s awake. He always is. He likes to pretend that the nightmares aren’t still plaguing him, but Steve knows the exhausted set of his eyes, and the furrow in his brow. Hell, he sees it on himself every morning, after all.
"Also, for the record," he adds, turning properly so that he can rest his head against Steve's shoulder, and his words are nothing more than a mumble, "I like the accent. It's cute."
The quiet, alone with tony in the room wasn’t really so bad. It was awkward, sure, stilted, but it was understandable. Those in comas, don’t tend to make the best conversationalists, after all. The quiet, with Ed in the room, is just unsettling. It’s oppressive, and pervasive, and Steve can feel the last of his self control fading away in an evanescence of emotion.
“Are you gonna tell him the truth or am I?” His voice is sharp as the edge of a blade, and he’s not afraid to pull the trigger if he has to. He’s killed enough people for less serious offences, but crossing Steve, potentially (likely) intending to
“Tony. I don’t wanna do this with you, right now.” Tony looks hurt, and that… that sucks. It hurts, but it’s better than the alternative, of the poor guy thinking that all of Clints problems are his own, so, shit, Clint can take it. He just takes that pain, and shoves it to the side, buries it deep under the surface, under a small smile. “Promise I’ll see her soon, okay? Follow up scheduled for next month. Let me do the worrying about myself in the meantime?”
“C’mon, Tone, tell me what you like. Tell me how ta fuck ya.” His accent slips through, accidentally, and he'd be embarrassed about it, if he had more capacity to care.
—they don’t send me out to do field work. It’s how I got your number. Latched onto your signal last time I was here and used it to track the phone, bypass the security measures remotely. But nobody sent me here to do that! I—I meant everything I said, that I’ve missed you, and that I wanted this to go somewhere. I wasn’t sent here to harm
. He whines softly, and brushes gentle fingers through Tony’s hair, trying to ground him with touch as much as he might be able to. There’s blood on the omega’s face, that looks like it’s coming from his nose, but the winter weather’s been cold enough that this happens once or twice a week. There’s something else going on here. He settles behind Tony, wrapping his arms around him, and pulling him to lean against his chest, in hopes that it can help to soothe him.
Clint is so far past giving a shit about any one single thing, that he’s ready to throw a fist, as much as a dirty look at the guy that sits down next to him. But then he looks up, into ice blue eyes, and all of a sudden… “shit” he mutters softly. James raises an eyebrow, and nods.
Steve growls softly, tossing over Tony’s scent glands, and the newly refreshed bond mark. They’ll be tied for the next half hour, easy, and the room is over saturated with the smell of Tony. he tumbles contentedly, low in his chest, and pulls Tony in for a deep kiss. “you’re perfect. I love you, too.”
Tony can’t exactly recall anything that happened, before he fell asleep. He remembers being pissed off at the weather. Blood… pain too, but he doesn’t think the blood had anything to do with the pain. It’s all a confused, bizarre jumble in his head, and he doesn’t know how to make heads or tails of it. It’s almost like a dream, one that seems so vivid, when you’re asleep, but when you wake up, you can’t remember a thing.
"I don't know," he says slowly, even as he presses his ass against Steve's dick through the pajama pants, relishing the low hiss that it earns him. "Could always do some more math, get you ahead at work," he adds with a grin.
Steve shivers softly, Tony's kisses doing just enough to get his heart rate kicked up a notch or two. He smiles slowly at the brunette, and pulls him into his lap, fixing him with a considering look, before kissing him deeply. Tony's skin is sleep warm, and soft, wherever it touches him, and there's the slightest impression of lines across his skin, where the sheets had pressed against him as he napped. He's adorable, Steve thinks.
Tony’s upset at that admission, of course he is, but he’s pretty certain that he knew, deep down somewhere, that he probably wasn’t special. Getting a confirmation on that hurts more than he’d care to admit, but he can push aside his own feelings for the sake of remaining the level-headed one in the conversation, because Bucky makes a noise that Tony can’t put a name to at Steve’s confession, takes a deep, shuddering breath. “Others,” Bucky repeats, slowly, like he can’t quite remember the meaning of the word. Or like he doesn’t want to believe it. “You…Steve, we talked about this after I found him—” He nods in Tony’s direction— “here. You’re…I’m fine with the one night stands if you tell me about them, Steve. I’m just…I don’t like finding out after the fact.” Steve had enough decency to tell him about the redhead, yes, but he hadn’t heard about anything after that. Probably would have put the pieces together if he hadn’t been too busy suffering through withdrawal himself, at Sam’s place. Again, Tony takes a different approach. “Were the needles clean?” he asks, because it’s pretty damn important that Steve gets tested if he doesn’t know or can’t say for sure. “Did you…” And, God, this hurts to ask, and he knows he doesn’t have any right to feel hurt, that Bucky’s the one who holds that, but still, “The one night stands, did you use protection?”
Clint feels his left arm start to itch, at the inner elbow, and it takes everything in him, not to reach down and scratch it, Because that’s a tell, and if Tony knows that this particular conversation is making him crave a hit, he’s going to beat Clint within an inch of his life, if he’s lucky. Except… he’s never lucky. And he knows that. More likely, what would happen, is that the genius would blame himself for Clints ineptitude, would entirely take responsibility for shit that wasn’t his, and spend the next month and a half avoiding clint, out of the misplaced idea that doing so was somehow ‘helping’. He tries to convince himself that maybe he’s letting his anxiety get the better of him, and maybe it won’t happen, but hell it has before, more times than he cares to count. Clint sighs again, softly.
He rubs the back of his hands over his eyes, and looks back at the flower, since there’s little else to do. He feels a gust of not-quite amused laughter working through his lungs and nose without his permission. Suddenly he remembers why he recognizes the damn plant. It’s an opium poppy. Steve thinks that if Tony was around to see it, he’d appreciate the irony.
uhh, notes to make, in this fic Tony's aged down, to somewhere around 27. he's still infamous Howard Stark's son, but we fate bent, to the point that Howard and Maria are still alive at the moment, so Tony's more free.
Watching Tony fly that nuke into the wormhole, thinking he might not come back… that was what made it click, and for the worst fifteen minutes of his life, Steve wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to see the night sky as anything but dim and weak, now that it’s brightest star was staring down another galaxy, waiting to blink out.
Tony laughs. It’s probably rude, and yeah, Steve prime doesn’t seem particularly impressed, but then again, the real Steve probably wouldn’t be either, so maybe that’s a win.
"Very romantic, Steve," he says. There's no heat behind the statement, and his grin should be more than enough of a hint that he's joking. "Think I need another few minutes though," he adds, resting his forehead against Steve's shoulder. The alcohol has the unfortunate effect of making him sleepy - a tipsy Tony is a tired Tony - but he's fully willing to fight against the urge to shut his eyes and surrender to the dark if it means he gets to spend longer with Steve. A little loss of sleep sounds worth it.
"Fine. But I'm taking my guns with me. You don't call within an hour telling me everything's okay, Stark, I will bring the wrath of both Heaven and Hell down upon this place," he says, grabbing his guns off the table and putting them back in his holsters, leaving the same way he came in. With a smile, Tony looks back to Steve.
“FRIDAY. FRI, don’t!” he says, feeling this situation start to slip out of his hands. Exactly like he was expecting, the AI chimes indifferently. At least she has the decency to sound regretful when she gives them the news Steve had been dreading.
He can pinpoint the exact second his brain kicks into gear, sending about five different mixed signals about what he should do: shove Steve off the bed, apologize to Steve’s husband—(good God, Tony feels like a fool, naïve and willing to accept that maybe Steve was different) – get his clothes on so that he can storm out, curse Steve out in Italian – (Maria’s heritage is definitely good for something) – or maybe he should do all of the above. He tries to not pay any attention to the tight feeling in his chest, knows he’ll be making an angry phone call to Clint after this (because angry is better than tearful), but there’s still something off about this guy. About Steve’s husband. When it clicks, Tony’s pretty sure that he won’t be alive to call Clint, because his mouth’s working before his brain’s given it permission, and he doesn’t have anything to say about Steve.
He’s also painfully aware of the fact that he’s gone a little over thirty-six hours without messaging Pepper to inform her that he’s safe, and that’s three times longer than what she thinks is tolerable after one of her guys has been killed. Fourteen hours since he last saw Clint…Hell, if he hadn’t disabled the tracker Pepper placed on his phone earlier this month, he’s sure that someone would’ve barged in on them by now. Still, he pushes aside any anxieties he has and manages a smile, slow and easy. “Technically, I think it’s classed as lunch now. Little late for breakfast.” And it’s not an outright yes, but it’s sure as hell not a no. He’s sure Steve’s intelligent enough to read between the lines.
"And I was holed up in the office, helpin' Sam with numbers," he says quietly, because part of him understands why Steve might not have wanted to come into the office and talk if he was buzzed, because Bucky most definitely would have tried to talk him out of doing anything unless he was sober and certain. A few, long seconds pass, and Bucky tightens his grip on Steve ever so slightly. "Did you mean what you said?" He asks, and the idea of an answer terrifies him. "About falling in love with him?"
has the guy called him anything other than Tony or Stark. Unless it’s an insult. And the only other people who call him Tone – or Tones, depending on the situation – are Rhodey and Pepper. He also catches the accent, manages to moan out a curse and then a, “Hot,” before he’s kissing Steve again, far more desperate and passionate than before. He doubts that he’ll be able to come without a hand around his cock, but he can feel the tightness in his abdomen growing nonetheless. It’s only once he’s broken away from Steve for air that he realizes Steve asked him a question – sort of, given that it was more of an order – and his mind catches up to everything else.
Tony's words go straight to Steve's cock, and it jumps and strains against his boxers. Tony moans so prettily though, he isn't quite ready to break contact and pull his underwear off, and start the mad grab for lube and condoms. He leans forward the tiniest bit, and sucks the head of Tony's cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, before sitting back up. He smiles impishly down at Tony as he reaches over to the nightstand and fumbles around, grabbing until he comes up with a strip of condoms, and a bottle of lube. He briefly considers asking Tony to get himself ready for the sake of time alone but that sounds tacky even in his own head, so he refrains. He lays the condoms on the pillow next to Tony, and flips the cap open on the lube, dousing two fingers and dropping to an elbow, to rub gentle fingertips across his asshole. He looks up often, wanting to see every expression on the brunettes face, as he works in one finger, then two. Shortly after he gets the second finger in, he crooks them both, hitting Tony's prostate roughly.
He wanders down from there, as quickly as possible, fully intending to wander the various floors of the admittedly labyrinthine hospital until he finds something  interesting. He’s just rounding the corner on the end of the Intensive Care Unit, when he walks smack into someone.  He shakes it off, fully willing and ready to right it off as a mistake, when his brain processes, and slams back to him in a single quick burst. He ran into someone. His ethereal, noncorporeal spirit (or as close to one as he would be liktley to say he has) ran into someone. Someone with matter, and mass, and flesh and bone. All the other people he’s seen so far, he simply fades through. Which means that this interaction is now medically relevant. He stops in his tracks, and turns back around, stopping to look at the girl he’d just bumped into.
“I’ll go into pre-heat on Thursday,” he says, opening his eyes to stare at the ceiling. “Listen, Steve, if you don’t want to meet while we’re caught up in the middle of our cycles, I’m not going to blame you,” he adds, even though his hindbrain cringes at the idea of not spending a heat with his alpha, especially so soon after…everything that happened. The doctors assured him the damage to his uterus was contained and repaired, and it may make future conception more difficult, but it wouldn’t do anything to dampen the effects of his heats. “I get it. Emotions are gonna be high enough when we meet, and it’s probably idiotic to do that while you’re in rut and I’m in heat, but I’ll be there if you want me to be.”
to himself.) and grabs the patiently waiting section of rebar. He’s efficient with his movements, still in a hurry, despite knowing that the phone would automatically send the call to the hold memo, giving him ample time, provided that the caller was patient enough to wait the minute or two it would take to sort this guy out. Steve hasn’t ever really cared for the smell of burning flesh, doesn’t think anyone does, but he can’t deny it’s effectiveness. Gordon’s screaming again, despite already having torn his voice to shit, and Steve can’t help but to smirk briefly. Maybe he’s in a bit of a bad mood, after all.
this chapter of this fic is posted on 2/6/2018 (mostly. it's after midnight for me, but it still counts) because today is 60 days clean and serene for me. if anyone reading this is in recovery, I'm proud of you.
Steve growls lowly, near possessively, and bats at Tony's hand, where it's wrapped around his cock. It's not that he doesn't want the brunette to come, God, does he ever, it's just that… he doesn't want him to have to be the one to take care of himself. As soon as Tony's hand is out of the way, Steve's hand replaces it, moving smoothly up and down the shaft, his thumb dragging over the head lazily, and adding that bit of slickness to the motion. He looks up to Tony's eyes, wanting to check that everything's still alright, as he continues to roll his hips quickly. “Want you to go first, babe. Wanna see you come for me.”
Steve’s usually a patient man. Slow to anger, quick to forgive. But something about this, about being so fucking close to the answer, and still further away than ever is just enough to make him lose his composure. He’s standing before he realizes it, and he’s glaring daggers down at Ed. “Why would you come here, if you’re not any use to me! Why come find us, just to rub it in my face?!”
Steve’s not expecting much out of today --since it certainly doesn’t look like this guy is gonna talk anytime soon, but hes’s
Steve’s standing in the nursery, looking over the hundreds of blankest and stuffed animals, and toys they’ve bought their pup, when he hears the bloodcurdling sound. He’s out of the room so fast, that he nearly takes the door off of the hinges.
Steve nirs at Tony's words, concerned but completely unable to do anything about it. He's not going to deny Bucky the care he desperately needs because he wants to avoid a turf war. He rips open the second spray, and uses it, praying to every God he can think of, that this isn't how he loses his husband. Bucky stirs, just briefly, just a minor thing, and his breathing slowly picks up. Steve's just about ready to go boneless with relief, when Bucky gasps, and blinks his eyes open rapidly. “Baby.” Steve says in the most wrecked voice he thinks he's ever heard. “Don't you dare leave me, James, don't you leave me! This isn't the end of the line!” Abstractly, Steve's aware that it's been longer than Tony said. The ambulance hasn't shown up, and that seems wrong. Part of him wants to worry, to obsess about that, but most of his conscious mind is laser focused on Bucky, who groans pathetically, and shakes his head. Steve's opening his mouth to ask what he needs, when Bucky pushes him off of his hips roughly, and leans over the side of the bed, retching and heaving.
Bucky groans and shivers harder than he thinks he ever has. His teeth clatter, and he's pretty sure his bones are seconds from shaking apart. He can't even  find the strength to answer Tony, let alone tell him that he's the one Steve's been calling out for in his sleep the last three weeks. Steve leads the paramedics upstairs, straight to Bucky. He hangs back by the side while they check his vitals. His eyes are still pinned, and his blood pressure is elevated unsurprisingly, but he's stable enough that they can transport him on a regular gurney, no backboard. Not that he doesn't put up a fight.
Bucky smiles softly and nods. Natasha has this way of being supportive, even when her actions seem like she couldn’t care less. Lord knows she’s probably saved him and Steve from more emotional crises than he cares to count. He shoots her a sarcastic salute, and turns over his shoulder, pulling out his keys, in preparation to head to the gallery.
“did you see would pushed you? I’ll have to thank them” He winks when he pulls back, and yeah, ok, maybe that's a little over the top but he's not going to apologize, he's just going to shrug and play it off. The smile he gives Tony is somehow both charming, and predatory. “Tony.” He says it back slowly, with just the hint of a rasp, letting his voice drop an octave or two. “I’ll have to remember that.” he says thought fully, playing with Tony's fingers, idly, because he’s still holding his hand. He leans in again, under the guise of saying something private, and nips ever so gently at Tony's earlobe before growling out; “might be saying it later.”
Bucky stills, tenses to such an extent that it’s visible to Tony, and he lets go of Steve’s hands, stands up, runs a hand through his hair before he looks back down at Steve. His movements are jerky, and Tony wants to stop him from leaving because he knows how much that’ll hurt Steve. Tony doesn’t move, lets him say his piece. “You overdosed and I /didn’t/ know about it? How could…Steve, how could you not tell me? How didn’t…Why didn’t anyone contact me? I’m—I thought I was your emergency contact.” He sounds betrayed more than anything else, definitely not as angry as he could. Tony doesn’t know if that’s a good or a bad sign. From what he’s already gathered, Steve and Bucky’s relationship has withstood a lot, but that was because they always talked to each other, told each other everything, the good and the bad alike. “I’m…I need to clear my fucking head,” he adds in a mutter, stalking out of the room. He grabs his gun as he passes the table, doesn’t bother picking up his coat before he’s out of the loft, bad weather be damned. “He’ll come back,” Tony says softly, because he’s not sure whether Steve wants physical comfort or not. Hell, he’s still not sure where the hell they stand, but now really doesn’t seem like the time to question that.
"If you don't fuck me through this heat, I will go out and find another alpha to do it instead." It's a sentence designed to set off every instinct Steve might have when he's this far into rut because, if Tony remembers correctly (he always does), the possessiveness is one of the first traits that Steve gives in to. So Tony threatening to let another alpha fuck him should be somewhat effective at conveying his message, at the very least."I want this, Steve," he adds on a more serious note, before Steve can say anything. "I don't---I can't go through a heat alone. Please."
So we added some additional tags for this chapter, check that out. This weeks (which, speaking of, this is hella late, strep throat is a bitch!) chapter title is named for a song that's like hauntingly beautiful for the type of scene that this is. I really suggest you listen to it!
Steve's words work their way into his chest and nestle somewhere by his heart, and Tony makes a quiet little half-keen sound. It's pitiful, and it's one of those noises he'd be embarrassed if anyone else heard, but Steve isn't anyone else. Steve's Steve and, despite everything, Tony knows he can trust him.
“YOU CAN’T FUCKING SHOOT HIM, JAMES!” Steve’s panicked at this point, because he’s seen that look on Bucky’s face before, and it’s the face that says ‘I’ve already made up my mind, and nothing short of divine intervention is going to change it.’.
"How far will I go, to make it feel right? come home, I have to fix this on my own. replace my heart, because mine broke the day I let us end. Replace my heart, I don't wanna live by coping, I'm done with hoping, end."
Steve blushes lightly, and isn't that fucking bizarre, to start blushing now? “Yeah, uh. Born and raised in Brooklyn. It's not usually bad, but uh. Slips out every now and then.” And in that one sentence, Tony already knows more about him, the
His stomach cramps violently, and he whines softly, burrowing as much into himself as he can manage to. Something’s gone awfully, horrifically wrong, and he needs help. Now. He can feel his mind starting to kick into fight or flight, can feel the panic rising and cresting over him, and by the time Steve’s collapsed on the kitchen floor next to him, he’s so far gone, all he can do is shake and tremble through another violent cramp.
“thank you. I… I’ll be ok. I’m gonna be ok.” Even though he’s jut been telling her the exact same thing, now that his words are being echoed back to him, he’s confused, and nearly ready to ask her how the hell that could be. There’s a sudden silence, as a beeping sound that they’ve grown used to hearing, stops. He turns to look down at the theatre, and notes that sure enough, one of the main monitors has been turned off. He moves to look back at the girl, and she’s disappeared. He’s getting sick of people doing that.
“Tony. Promise me we can see each other again. please, baby.” His words are quiet, like they’re meant only for Tony, because they are.
Tony smirks softly, and shakes his head. “you’re no fun, you know what cap? No fun.” Steve rolls his eyes, and shoves Tony’s wheelchair slightly.
“I know, Tony. You have every right to be, I’m… I’m sorry. I should have told you about Bucky.” Bucky scoffs, and puts the gun back in his waistband, before crossing his arms over his chest.
bothered if Pepper catches on, sure, but that's because she'll try to run background checks on Steve and that never ends well. "It was a good intense though. Didn't really think you had a secret accent - that's pretty hot."
Things go well for months. Summer gives way to fall, fall to winter, and Steve and Tony manage to hide away in their makeshift little nest, the home they’ve made for themselves. It’s odd being back in the tower, at first, where they have so many memories lurking around, but slowly, it becomes something new. it becomes theirs. Tony’s getting more and more maternal, nesting on almost every solid surface, and checking, rechecking, triple checking the nursery. Steve smirks softly, while he watches him bustle around, on a completely unremarkable day.
Tony rises with Steve, gives a soft smile at his question. He knows that he should probably refuse, that Clint'll only worry if he spends the night with Steve, and that Pepper will murder him if he misses more work than is reasonable, but he also knows that Steve definitely needs somebody to be with him right now, both to prevent any potential relapses and to ensure that he doesn't slip into a negative mindset in general. Tony has to wonder if this is what Rhodey felt like when Tony was stuck in the midst of his alcoholism. Regardless, he gives a slight nod. "Course I'll stay with you, Stevie," he says, and he's not entirely sure that he's only talking about tonight. "C'mon." He tugs Steve gently out of the living room, towards the bedroom because he apparently remembers where that is. He only lets go of Steve's hand once they're in the room, pulls off his sweater before he moves to undo his jeans, because he is most definitely not sleeping in them.
“It's been two hours. I got a little absorbed, sorry. One of my… colleagues. He's shit with numbers.” He smiles apologetically, and moves to get in the bed with Tony. He's still partially clothed, of course, but he isn't about to be insisting that they rush to round two that quickly. He's more than happy enough to lay here and cuddle, sharing lazy kisses. Maybe that's the herb talking, but Tony doesn't
On the one hand, he wants to decline, say that it’s not a good idea. He knows that the second Steve comes anywhere near him, he’s going to crumble. According to both Rhodey and Peter (because Peter doesn’t know the difference between being helpful and pointing out something Tony’s been trying to ignore), Tony’s scent has shifted into something sour over the last few months, tainted with grief and bitterness. It happens to every omega that loses their alpha, through death or…whatever the hell Steve and Tony went through. A dramatic, tragic break-up, maybe.
But there’s still a reluctance to say any of that, because Tony’s lying too. He hates all of this, the situation they’ve found themselves in, but he doesn’t hate Steve. He sniffs, uses his free hand to wipe away a tear threatening to fall as he types out a message.
like that many) small time villains that tried to take them out over the last week, but his mouth, his entire
"Steve?" Tony asks, voice quiet, and he waits for the 'hm?' of acknowledgement from Steve before he murmurs a quiet, "For once in your life, shut up." It happens too fast for him to think about any possible repercussions, him leaning forward and kissing Steve. It's soft and gentle and quickly evolves into something that's anything but.
Steve sighs happily, and wraps his arms around Tony. His mouth doesn’t say anything, but his brain’s stuck thinking lovesick thoughts about how well the brunette fist up against him, and how very like a puzzle he feels, having found its missing piece.
Had this been any other hitman, anyone else at all, Tony wouldn’t have been as petrified as he is right now. He still would’ve been scared, sure, but that’s expected when you’re staring down the barrel of a gun. He’s had one too many close calls with death in the past year to think that the business, even from behind the scenes, is all fun and games, and he’s beginning to regret not paying more attention when Clint and Jessica were teaching him self-defense. He knows how to disarm somebody, but generally that person wouldn’t be James Barnes, and Tony wouldn’t be naked and covering himself with a sheet, and maybe he would’ve had enough wits about him to not sleep with Steve in the first place.
“You want the gods honest truth, he’s a fuckin’ wild card, Tony.” Clint finally sighed. “he could be a great ally. But he could be another Kazimierczak.” he gestures angrily, bitterly, to his right ear, and the bright purple hearing aid tucked behind it. Tony winces.
He hates the idea of leaving tony alone, of separating themselves, but he doesn’t want to do anything Tony doesn’t want. He’s been able to be ok so far, but it’s quickly becoming a slippery slope. He squirms briefly, and whines. “I know you said you didn’t want me to take scent blockers but… it’s getting worse. I get it if… if you want me to leave.”
They spend another five minutes solid looking for a way to get Tony out of the suit, and Steve merely rolls his eyes, and steps closer, touching the tiniest indentation at the back of the neck, where sure enough, plates start losing their cohesion, and falling off, into a brilliant, gold and hot rod red mess on the ground. Steve’s not prepared for seeing Tony’s face. He’s seen him injured before, of course, they’ve been on the same team for years, and Tony’s mind never stops, so there was more than once, more than a hundred times, likely, that he got hurt in his workshop, but this is… different.
Tony smirks, and leans up against a miraculously bare section of wall. “maybe a little, yeah. But he’s an icon.” There’s an awkward pause, where the two of them appear to be weighing each other carefully. Tony breaks it eventually, his voice more quiet and unsure than it had been before. “he’s important to me. I grew up on Cap stories. My… my father did a lot of work for project rebirth.”
Steve groans quietly and takes a step closer, wrapping an arm around Bucky's side, and hooking his chin over his shoulder. “I'm sorry, Buck. It's not an excuse, but I was buzzed before I left, and I blazed when I got here.” He nuzzles up against the curve of Bucky's neck, where he's sensitive, and can't resist soft kisses and bites, and whines again. “I really am sorry, Jamie.” And that's, maybe, a little overkill. It's a nickname he doesn't use often, doesn't hardly use ever, because it's got sentiment like no one's business. It's the nickname he called Bucky way back when, when they were just kids, who didn't have all this shit to be afraid of, or gang wars to fight, or product to move. It was the nickname he woke up screaming from every bad nightmare, and asthma attack that nearly put him six feet under. Bucky gives in, wraps his arms around Steve's waist, though that doesn't mean that there isn't still a dull ache in his chest, Steve's words about loving Tony echoing through his head.
He’s just to the edge of the room, just reaching out for the doorknob, when it’s flung open from the other side, and he freezes in his tracks. Maybe it’s an orderly meant to tell him what the fuck is happening, and who he has to sue, to get out of here. The form in front of him looks up, and Tony gasps instantly.
poor boys are so awful at communicating. but look at that, all their biggest secrets are out there, and now we can start healing! feel free to yell at me on Tumblr, @theJovialkynnadyg-ray! I'm ever so friendly! Chapter five, cough syrup, will be out Febuary 6th!
Clints first thought is slicing through his consciousness, before he has a chance to rein it in, ugly, and bitter, and beneath him. You had that. But that ship has sailed, and sunk, and sailed a few times more, so the sniper closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and lets it out slow enough that Tony probably can’t hear it. Probably isn’t listening for it, anyway. “Hi to you too, Tony, I’m doing great.” he pauses for a second and smirks, to himself. “Shoulda gone home, when you had the chance.”
“Get the fuck out of my bar.” he says, barely a whisper. Clint blinks, slowly, feeling pinned under the weight of those painfully ice blue eyes.
Tony huffs out a quiet laugh, and shakes his head. It’s not a promise, not a guarantee, but maybe… just maybe there’s a chance that they can reach an understanding.
“you’re gonna look so perfect Tony, all round with our pup.” He whines softly, on a particularly good thrust, and his eyes flutter shut of their own accord. “God, ‘m gonna keep you in bed, you wont lift a finger for anything.” It’s an odd avenue for sex talk, but he realizes belatedly, that it kind of seems like perfection to him.
“Steve, don’t you think I want to? Don’t you think this is killing me every bit as much as it is you? I’d love to tell you how to fix him. But I can’t. I can’t do that, or I’ll throw everything off balance.”
"You're not the one who's gonna have difficulty sitting for a week," he mutters, though there's a teasing lilt to his tone that should let Steve know he isn't actually bothered by this. He'll
“Yeah?” he asks softly, as he sinks back into Tony, gasping out relief as he does. His cock is starting to tingle at the base, and he knows he doesn’t have long left. Hopefully, he won’t need long, to get Tony to come first. He jerks forward in a particularly rough thrust, one that scoots them both further up the bed. He should probably feel bad, but right now, it’s just fuel to the fire. He leans down and nibbles over Tony’s earlobe, teasing relentlessly.
"But, uh, the miscarriage itself caused a tear in the uterus wall, and the doctors managed to repair it," he says, "but it will likely affect the chances of me successfully carrying to term in the future. I just...I thought you should know."
There's a sound torn out of Tony's chest that sounds halfway to a sob, and Tony doesn't know if it's relief from being so close to Steve, from hearing that after it all, he’s still Steve’s star, or if it's something closer to neediness, because Steve being near him both eases and worsens the heat at the same time, and that's ten different shades of confusing. He shifts ever so slightly, careful to not topple both himself and Steve (though he doubts he could really topple Steve, even if he wanted to) and uses one hand to push Steve's mouth away from his scent glands, instead ducking down to kiss him.
The aids are right next to the med minder, and there’s really no reason not to put them on, other than that Clint isn’t actually sure that he’s that ready for his day to start. It’s a strange distinction, probably. Ear on, means that there’s absolutely no more avoiding the waking world. But hey, the ritual is his, and those are important to him, so he lets it go, focuses instead on checking over the pills in the slot in front of him.One pink oval that’s a one and done, plus another that he’s going to have to take again before the days over, one white oval that’s more god damned horse pill than it is, anything else--he gets to take that one twice too, joy upon joys-- and he’s good for now.There’s a blue and white capsule in there somewhere, that’s truly the epitiome of medical festivity, but that’s for twelve hours later, and yeah, he’s learned that lesson a couple of times already, thank you very much. By now, the coffee’s done, and yeah, he should probably hydrate, or at least chase his medication with something other than grocery store brand black coffee, but he’s never claimed to like himself, has he?
Bucky moves, takes half a step back and brings his hands to cup Steve's face, make him look him in the eyes instead of hiding his face against his shoulder. "I don't want you to stop seeing him if that'd make you unhappy," he says, because he's willing to learn how to adapt and cope if it means Steve's happy. There's also a bitter little voice in the back of his head, telling him that Steve and Tony can't possibly have learned that much about each other in a night, that there could always be a deal-breaker for one of them. He doesn't fully trust Tony, and it's not just because Steve's apparently falling in love with him.
Clint cuts him off with a soft sigh, shaking his head, and looking back up to the TV, pretending to watch it, for a few blissful moments of stalling. “Blipped last month.” he says simply enough, trying to push past it. It doesn’t work, of course, and he hears the tiny inhale of breath, from Tony, before he can stop it. “C’mon, Tony, you know it happens.”
Tony’s body hasn’t ever done particularly well, at taking a fucking hint. All the way back to grade school, when he would get nosebleeds, at the most random of times, and for seemingly no reason. Imagine his surprise, to learn that chronic nosebleeds are something to look forward to in pregnancy, too.
“Three months and you didn’t move in sooner?” he asks with his signature smirk. “Tony got his location and I took him out the same day. Looks like Red Star are slacking.”
Steve's moans are ratcheting up in volume right alongside Tony's and god knows the telltale slap of skin on skin is none too quiet either. Steve’s not exactly used to holding himself back though, so it's no problem for him. he doesn’t have any neighbors in this part of town, sandwiched in by a coffee bar, on one side, and a tax preparation place on the other. Given that it’s some ungodly hour, he’s seriously doubting that there’s anyone occupying either space.
Natasha rolls her eyes, sets about cleaning where Bucky just was, though there is an annoying sympathy bubbling up inside her. “Hey,” she says before he gets the chance to walk away. “You two’ll work whatever this is out, okay? He was probably just too high to realize that he needed to tell you he was going home with someone, I doubt it means anything.” After a beat, she adds, “He’s Steve, and you’re you.” It’s said with a shrug, like that simple fact means the universe will fight for them, and maybe it will.
It’s not so long ago, that things were… as close to perfect, as Steve ever thought they would get. he had a home. A family to fill it with. He had hope for the future, for the first time in a long,
"Think I'm getting used to that," Tony says, voice quiet but earnest, and accepts Steve's hand, hugging him tight the second Steve pulls him close. "I was gonna tell you," he adds. "If we decided we wanted to be more than a one night stand. I'm sorry, Steve."
Things blank out for a while, and there’s little more than darkness, and heat, and the vague sensation that he’s not comfortable, no matter how he orients himself. just when it seems like it’s all over, there’s a scream that pierces the silence of his mind, and he tightens his grip on the pillow, senses on edge, only to realize it’s tony. it’s tony, in pain and desperate, worse than anything Steve can remember, and he’s on the cusp of tearing himself into consciousness, when his dream goes lucid, and he realizes that he’s still asleep.
stupid.” And it’s not like he doesn’t remember what happened. It’s not like he doesn’t have painfully vivid nightmares every goddamned night, about being left in a burned out bunker, broken down, in a busted suit. Being truly abandoned in every sense of the word. He
"There's something happenin' here, what it is ain't exactly clear... I think it's time we stop children, what's that sound, everybody look what's going down."
Bucky slides into the spot next to him, and leans forward on the mahogany edge of the bar. “Tastes less like shit, if you chill it.” he says, matter of factly.
it rough? Steve can't turn down that invitation. He pulls back, just long enough to manhandle Tony, to hook his legs over his shoulders, and grab his hips between bruising hands. He tugs him back, until he's sinking back into his body, and the resistance is still there, but it's so
Clint looks back and forth from Tony, or more accurately the impassive, glinting iron man mask, and Steve a grand total of three times before he manages to speak.
“Look at him, Steve. /really/ look at him. He’s unconscious, and barely fucking breathing. You know just as well as I do that this is a 50/50 thing, if not worse.”  Something ugly, and hot begins to uncurl in Steve’s stomach. He’s angry, he wants to shout this guy down, argue in Tony’s favor but… for all points and purposes, this guy is right. Steve sighs softly, and second Tony smiles like the cat that just got the pet Canary, before sticking out his hand.
“No.” Fury raises an eyebrow, looks Steve over with a skeptical eye and takes a long moment to consider what he’s going to say.
“Further than I want to wait, but not too far to survive.” There's a little voice in the back of Tony's head telling him that he should be far more wary of the situation at hand than he is. Out of all his one night stands in recent months, he doesn't think there's been once that they haven't used a cab to get from one location to the next, because he's pretty used to being about as wasted as his partner and neither of them are generally in any state fit to drive. Who even owns a car in New York, anyway? He can't think of anyone in his friendship group that does, though work's definitely a different story - need to move product somehow, and cabs aren't great for subtlety. Regardless of any worries - thank you, alcohol - he grins, presses a kiss to Steve's cheek before he gets in the car with a,
Steve smirks when he sees Bucky's jaw tense at Clint's comment about the wrath of heaven and hell. He's not sure exactly what words his husband's trying to keep behind his teeth, but he knows him well enough to know that whatever it is, it isn't nice. Once Clint's gone, Steve sighs and presses a gentle kiss to Tony's cheek.
“I just… I need to go work on something. Clear my mind. I’ll… I’ll have FRIDAY remind me to come back up for dinner, ok?” he doesn’t wait for a response, because he knows Rhodey isn’t going to exactly understand. He means well, he really does, but… this is something Tony has to do.
Tonys mind spins away from his quickly, and his hands are shaking in a mere matter of seconds. It’s a strange position to be in, really. he’s panicky enough to be breaking down, but sane enough still, to watch himself fall apart. He blinks a few times, and he could swear there’s blood on his hands. He knows from experience, it never matters how many times he washes them, they won’t come clean. They won’t come clean, because it’s not actually there. He sets his tools down gingerly, and takes a shakey breath.
“last chance, Tony. last chance to back out. You sure you wanna do this?”Tony stares at Steve for a few seconds, unwavering. If he's being honest, he's surprised that Steve is still this in control given how he's already at least a day and a half into rut. It's a miracle that they didn't end up with their clothes off the minute they saw each other, actually. When it becomes clear that Steve's going to need verbal consent and communication before he does anything, Tony leans close to kiss him again, then murmurs a,
Rhodeys crosses the space that’s between him and his best friend in two large steps, and kneels next to him. It’s only thanks to a lifelong career in the Air Force, and active combat, that he manages to keep a hold on his emotions.
“S-Steve?” his voice sounds about a thousand times more thin than he wants it to, but hey, he’ll take what he can get. Frankly, he’s shocked that he can speak at all, at this point. “what… what… how? And, /why/, actually?” Steve prime smirks, and takes a step closer.
Natasha raises an eyebrow at Bucky. It’s not as though she hasn’t seen him with his forehead pressed against the bar she’s just wiped down before – as annoying as ever – but it’s rarely over Steve going missing. “I’m sure somebody’s got an idea of where he’s gone,” she says, tone tinged with faint disinterest. “Maybe one of the techs can trace his phone? Frank’s been holed up in the VIP booth all night running diagnostics, and he’s either dosed off or taken something to keep him awake. You that concerned about him, Barnes?”
Tony looks like shit, and it’s clear that he’s dissociating , but that’s all that Steve has to go on, and it’s not
She looks regular enough, in a plain white T shirt, black jeans hugging her hips. She’s faced away from him right now, staring through the window of what appears to be an operating theatre. She doesn’t say anything immediately, just continues to stare, like some part of her is missing, and she curls further into her self, wrapping her arms around her body, tight. Tony’s just to the point of asking her if she’s ok, when she turns to him, with a quiet sniffle.
Hes not expecting the kiss that Tony pulls him into, and it's dizzying for several seconds. When Tony moans against his mouth, he can't help but to smile softly. “Yeah? Right there?” He thrusts forward again, a rough snap of the hips, hoping to pull a reaction from the lithe man under him. He sucks Tony's bottom lip between his teeth, and bites down softly, just enough to add a layer of sensation.
They spend something like two weeks after their shared cycles in a perfect, blissful kind of trance. They relearn each other, what makes them who they are, and what makes their relationship work. There are some days where they never manage to make it out of bed, too wrapped up in each other, in the nuance of skin on skin, and the intimacy they’ve been missing for months, but it’s not a guaranteed. There are other days, where they do nothing but talk, about everything. Thoughts, and fears, whet makes life worth living. This is what they should have been doing in the first place.
Bucky hates these fucking stairs. They’re steep, and uneven, and a bitch to navigate when it snows, which, wouldn’t you know it, it did last night. He’s grumbling to himself by the time he gets to the top, but he sets his personal grudge with them aside, to unlock the door and push it open. He’s seen his husband in a lot of positions before. He’s seen him nearly beat to death by some mobster, with a headcold so bad his nose looked three times its normal size, and he sounded like a cartoon, hell he’s even seen him beat other people to within an inch of their lives, and sometimes beyond. But for some reason, he really isn’t prepared to see him curled up in bed with a pretty little Brunette thing, kissing him like he was the oxygen he needed to survive. Bucky resists the urge to scoff, scream, or sob, and leans up against the doorframe of the bedroom.
“FRIDAY, contact secretary Ross.” He speaks to the AI without ever looking away from Steve. “You have two fucking seconds to get the hell away from him, Rogers.” Steve growls, instinctively, before he can stop himself, and he hates that he’s worried enough , that he didn’t have the presence of mind to cut the sound off. Appearing aggressive isn’t exactly fucking helping his case.
"When lonely days turn to lonely nights, you take a trip to the city lights. and take the long way home, take the long way home. You never see what you want to see, forever playing to the gallery, you take the long way home, take the long way home." -Take the long way home.
“Please! Please, I don’t know who the supplier is!” Steve rolls his eyes, and walks in two quick steps over to the fifty-five-gallon drum, still crackling from the fire he lit this morning (to warm the draft, he’d told himself.
He gasps, and feels his whole body tense, as he tips over the edge, into orgasm. He lets out a loud breath, something that sounds exactly like a shattered benediction of 'Tony’, and his hips still, as he feels the condom grow warm with his release.
