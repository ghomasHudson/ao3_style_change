The look on Steve’s face changed immediately. Confusion was gone, the unrestrained want from earlier returning, but there was something else too. It took a moment for Tony to realise it was warmth and fondness, the latter having never been directed at Tony before.
Filling Tony's head was a visual of himself, head pressed against the pillow, hair matted with sweat, ass in the air, Steve's cock buried deep inside him, cum staining his thighs. To have this image of him projected by Steve through their bond, along with pure unfiltered possessiveness, Tony was overwhelmed by just how right it felt, to have his body at the complete mercy of Steve.
“I could ask the same of you,” Steve said. “Why aren’t you running away?”
Steve’s fingers, long and thick, were brushing past his prostate, leaving Tony fidgeting and shuddering. “Come on, Steve. Stop with the teasing already,” he whined, squeezing one of Steve’s biceps.
Instantly, people were throwing dates around as if the two people concerned weren’t there. Tony tried to ignore it, because they had only just gotten together weeks ago, and now people were discussing their wedding? They haven’t even said those three magical words to each other.
Steve looks at her, feeling beyond relieved that she’s here too, but looking at the place they’re in, a wave of anxiety washes through him. If he’s back in his original timeline, wouldn’t this Peggy be from the original one too? Would it be possible that this Peggy knows what happened in an alternate timeline? Or will he have to act like nothing ever happened?
New coordinates: Wakanda.
Steve averted his gaze, and Tony knew he was right. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Steve doesn’t wait. With one more kiss to Tony’s temple, he gets up and heads to the bathroom. He searches for it, finds it in one of the side cabinets. When he gets back, he finds Tony completely naked, the rest of his clothes in a pile on the floor at the side of his bed. He has one hand on his chest, the other on his own cock, slowly stroking himself.
, Steve started fucking him like he meant it.
“I know, but why do you have it on me?” Steve asked with a smirk. “It’s not my month yet. It’s Thor’s.”
Steve can barely believe it, but after everything he’s seen and experienced in his life, nothing really seems impossible anymore.
"I need your blood." Being told since he was young that werewolf blood tasted horrible, Tony had never given any thought about drinking Steve's blood before. But blood, especially supernatural blood, gave vampires strength and energy, strength that would hopefully help him survive the bite.
Tony’s face got impossibly hotter. He was a male vampire; of course he couldn’t get pregnant. Using his elbow, he nudged Steve in the chest. “What are you talking about?”
When Steve opens his eyes, he expects to see white, or maybe even a blue sky.
He can’t see Steve’s face, but he knows that he is smiling. He can feel it. And as much as he wants to see his smile, he doesn’t want to ruin the moment. He stays there, feels as Steve turns back to face the sunrise and laces their fingers together.
Tony always knew his attraction to Steve went beyond that of the physical. Steve was one of the best people he knew; he was such a good guy that Tony almost couldn’t believe he was real, but he was. Just like Steve, he didn’t want to lose his best friend, but more than that, he also thought that with the long-standing animosity between their kinds, Steve would never look at him that way. So, Tony had given up hope of anything romantic between them for a long time, lying to and laughing at anybody who suggested anything like that. Sexual attraction, sure, but nothing more. To now know that Steve had felt the same all this time filled Tony with relief, but to know what Steve had put himself through, Tony wanted nothing more than to hold him and tell him that he didn’t have to pretend anymore.
If someone had told Tony several years ago that Steve would be eating him out, Tony would have laughed it off, pretending that he didn’t have a sexual fantasy about it. Now, all Tony could do was grab onto the pillow closest to him, forehead pressed into it as Steve tongue-fucked him. Being a vampire, all his senses were heightened, and the fear and arousal that came from having a werewolf’s tongue inside him left Tony a moaning wreck.
But now, in this new, unknown place and time, Steve believes he has a chance to start over, that both him and Tony have a chance to start their relationship anew.
“Maybe,” said Steve. “The thing is, the pact only forbids angels and demons from fighting. It never says anything about being in a relationship.”
She turns around, grinning when she sees Steve. “Took you long enough.”
Steve laughs as he takes a cup, recalling how he was a short, sickly fellow when the two of them last talked like this. “That’s a bit of an understatement.”
“Then why did you...?” Confusion had completely taken over Steve’s face, and Tony could see that he was trying to figure out this one-eighty change in reaction. “Are you… afraid of commitment?”
But none of that mattered right now, as all Tony could think about was the friction of the bed sheets against his erection, and the sheer heat of Steve’s large hands on his hips, lips slowly pressing kisses down his spine. However, as Steve moved lower, a sudden thought came to Tony’s mind.
Steve is still so awed by his presence that he can only repeat his name. “Tony.”
“We tell her about you, you know. Stories, memories, experiences.” Steve recalls his own time spent with Morgan, how she was so focused on listening to his every word about Tony. “All of us, whoever’s left, we tell her about you every day. Just to make sure she’ll always remember you.”
“You know that’s not what I meant,” said Tony. “Besides, we’ve already boned.”
Tony had never thought Steve would be capable of dirty talk, so to hear those words come out of his mouth, Tony couldn't help but squirm, wanton and ready for Steve to be inside him again. "Then what are you waiting for? Fuck me already."
Tony could only glare at him. “What? What excuse are you going to give me?"
Steve was close, his movements becoming erratic. He leaned forward, staring right into Tony’s eyes. “I want to come inside you.” And fuck, if that wasn’t the hottest thing Tony heard. The look on Steve’s face showed that even though he hadn’t asked, he still wanted a confirmation, for Tony to tell him that it was okay.
Steve dashes over to her and pulls her into a hug, one that she instantly returns. He never thought he would see her again. He didn’t get to say goodbye, he didn’t even get to see her body, so to have her here, physically here and hugging him back, Steve can barely control his emotions.
“What?” Tony wasn’t sure he heard him right.
“What we just did… would you call that incompatible?” The demon blushed at that response. He couldn’t deny it. Steve knew all the right places to touch, and Tony’s own body was open and receptive to anything the angel did. It was as if they were made for each other, Tony’s aching body attesting to that fact.
"I feel you too." With those words came relief, joy, and anticipation, feelings that Tony sent right back. He tilted his head back to seek Steve out, and Steve was already there, capturing his lips in a kiss that had him wanting more.
“I watched Bucky die,” he decides to say. He knows it’s a risky move, talking about another death, especially with Tony’s strong resentment towards that man, but he goes with it anyway. “He was one of the first to go. He was scared too. He called out to me. I didn’t even know what was happening until he was just dust on the ground.”
in his arms.
For the first time, Tony realizes that Steve’s broken and damaged too. Maybe not as badly as Tony, but he’s suffered enough.
With some effort, they tried to manoeuvre themselves so that they could lie on the bed. It wasn’t easy, what with Steve’s knot and all, but also because with every shift Tony made with his hips, Steve would come in small bursts, a sensation that had Tony shuddering. He powered through it, moving until they were both on their sides. With Tony’s legs still needing to be wrapped around Steve’s waist, it was an awkward position, a position that left Steve at Tony’s shoulder level, and Tony needing to bend down in order to look at Steve, but at least the both of them were more comfortable.
It’s not the first time Steve has said it, and Tony’s reaction, like now, has always been one of disbelief and uncertainty. Ever since the Accords, Steve’s greatest fear has been that Tony hates him. He told himself that he would be fine if they were never together again, but if Tony was so angry to the point where they couldn’t even be in the same room or hold a normal conversation without fighting, he would be devastated.
Steve’s brilliant blue eyes met Tony’s again. “And guess what? You’re mine.”
Softly, Steve asks, “Do you miss them?”
And it’s like the old man said. Whatever happens, they’ll do it together.
Over the centuries, demons had evolved to be more human-like, to make it easier upon themselves when it came to shape-shifting. The only ones who still looked like the classic stereotypes, coloured skin with blood red eyes and fanged teeth, were the older demons, the first generation, as well as the devil himself, Tony’s boss. But the usual traits were still there. Tony felt his horns grow, twisting their way out of his head. At the base of his spine, a forked tail sprouted out and swished about, as if stretching after having been kept in for so long. His ears became pointed, and his nails sharper, almost like claws. In the middle of his chest, a faint light glowed as runes etched into the skin, a circular pattern in the centre with jagged lines growing out of it. Last of all, a pair of jet black wings sprouted out of his back, falling back down against the mattress.
Controlling his breathing, Tony gets up and makes his way to the windows, watching as the blue and green planet takes over the view. It looks so peaceful from far away. Not as if half the population had just disappeared.
Steve's entire body was tense, but he still gave Tony's hip a reassuring squeeze. "I trust you."
“Whatever you want, Tony,” Steve said, pressing a kiss to Tony’s temple. “Anything you want.”
“I know she is.” Tony smiles. “And I’m already proud of her.”
The glint disappeared, replaced with a large grin. “Well, you still owe me that chicken.”
Tony turns to Nebula, and for the first time since they met, they make eye contact. No words are needed.
Steve’s heart breaks for the second time that day. Tony sounds completely… broken. He reaches a hand forwards, cupping the side of Tony’s face, turning it towards him. Another tear falls from the corner of Tony’s eye. He still doesn’t want to look at him.
With their emotions feeding off of each other, Tony felt like their high would never end, but eventually it did, Tony coming back to his senses to feel Steve's large body draped over him, warm and sticky with sweat. He was clearly exhausted, much like Tony was himself, but he was still holding himself up on his forearms so that he wasn’t crushing Tony below him.
“I want this,” Tony reaffirmed, and while it was incredibly hot for Steve to ask for consent, Tony had reached a point where he just wanted Steve to touch him proper. He felt Steve’s cock rub against his thigh, and in that moment all vampire instincts just flew out the damn window. Leaning forward, he whispered into Steve ear, “I want
He had no idea that things would turn out the way they did. He had expected a quick fuck, sex that would take his mind away from the pain. He just wanted to feel something, and Steve made him feel everything.
Tony involuntarily clenched at the thought, and with one final thrust, Steve slammed into Tony, his fully expanded knot firmly locking him in place. As Steve came, he bit down on Tony’s shoulder, hard enough to leave a mark but not enough to break the skin. The arousal from Steve’s cum spilling into him, along with the pain from the bite, finally pushed Tony over the edge, his own orgasm hitting him like a truck.
“Yes, but that’s not it. It’s just… I don’t want to lose you,” Tony said, surprised at how heavy this was all getting. But it was the truth. Sure, after a long day at work of catching bad guys and solving crime, Tony would want nothing more than to be able to go home and have Steve there, a warm presence waiting for him. Similarly, Tony knew that Steve would want him there for him as well, a source of comfort at the end of a gruelling day. But as much as Tony wanted that, he was afraid to think of how great the loss would be if they had that, if they got to experience all of that only to lose it. “And I’m sure you don’t want to lose me either.”
Then he notices that his pillow is moving.
With each word, Steve sped up, driving harder and faster into Tony. With one final thrust, Tony came with a gasp, the sensation completely taking over his body. His whole body tensed, and Steve followed soon after, reaching his own climax as Tony clenched around him.
“I didn’t know,” Steve said, eyes filled with mixed emotions. “I’m sorry.”
“I don’t care.” Tony cut him off. “Take as much time as you need. I mean, you’ve already waited this long, right?”
Rocket drops to his knees then, sobbing into his paws. Steve doesn’t have to ask. Along with Groot, he just lost his family. He’s all alone.
“Years. Decades.”
Now left alone, Tony collapsed with his back against the wall, tilting his head back and staring up at the sky.
So, he keeps repeating it, punctuating every repetition with a hard thrust. Every time he repeats it, he too uses it to say something else.
The previous pain of oversensitivity was soon replaced by pleasure once again, because as expected, Tony was hard again. Demons had developed short refractory periods to ensure the greatest efficiency in seducing humans and tempting them to sin. Tony had never been more thankful for this, especially now that Steve had stopped worrying about hurting him, fingers pressing bruises onto the underside of his thighs with every jerk of his hips.
He doesn’t know how long he sits there for, but soon enough, the sun starts to rise. The dark blues of the night begin mixing with the brilliant yellows of the morning sky, and light begins to fall onto the city.
Tony reaches down, holding both of their hardening dicks in one hand. He starts stroking them together, and Steve almost curses at the sudden contact. Resting his forehead against Tony, he loses himself in the smooth glide between skin, grunting when Tony moves a thumb over the head of his leaking cock.
“You’ve been holding out on me, big guy,” Tony said, looking back up at Steve with a wink. “Don’t even know if this can fit.” Steve’s breath hitched at that line, a hand moving to touch Tony’s jaw.
“I always have it with me. Keep it charged too.” Then, Tony looks away as he says. “I read your messages. I don’t reply them, but… I do read them.”
Tony shook his head. “Steve, I need to explain.”
“What about me?” Steve ask, pulling his fingers all the way out before shoving them back in, laughing breathlessly at Tony’s moan.
It’s true. Tony had always been told that angels and demons were the first ever enemies on Earth. Wars broke out over it. Religions had been built around each side, sparking conflicts every now and then. The only reason Tony had never really seen, much less fought, any angels was because of a pact, drawn up and agreed upon by both sides to preserve their numbers and protect mankind, the life source for both. Knowing that an angel was not only watching over him, but that it was his own personal guardian angel, left Tony feeling completely overwhelmed.
Steve moved back up Tony’s body, the bed creaking under the shifting weight, the heat now draped over his back. He felt lips pressed to his shoulder blade as Steve worked another finger into him. Steve spread his fingers, slowing opening Tony up, but it wasn’t enough. His fingers were just shy of brushing his prostate, and at this point, Tony was so desperate that he moved his hips backwards, fucking himself on Steve’s fingers, trying to get them deeper into him.
Then that smile slowly faded. “But before that, I wasn’t sure. I mean, look at us. Our kinds have been enemies for eons. It took me a long time to get over that, and an even longer time to accept my feelings.”
For obvious reasons, Tony didn’t have said gland, but he knew that the alpha wolf in Steve wouldn’t be satisfied until it had made its mark. However, a werewolf bite was more than likely to be fatal to vampires, and that complicated things. There was only one real way to protect himself, and even then, Tony wasn't a hundred percent sure.
“Everyone stop whining and just be happy for these two lovebirds.” Natasha was by her own desk, one of the few who didn’t lose the bet.
“Fucking hell, Nat!” Tony said, just barely managing to stabilise his cup. “Don’t do that!”
“Hey, I didn’t promise you that.” But Tony was weak to Steve’s puppy dog eyes. It didn’t take much for him to give in. “
In that moment, Tony felt warm all over. Fuck being self-conscious; Steve knew exactly what he was doing. The look in Steve’s eyes was one of the things that Tony vividly remembered from their one-night stand, and it was that look that Tony liked to recall when he touched himself, the one that would always get him hot and bothered. He could feel his blood slowly making its way down south, which would be the last thing he wanted to happen because a) he’s in public and b) he didn’t need Steve to see the effect he had on him.
They eat in silence as they watch the sunrise, the golden orb leaving the horizon. It’s a comfortable silence, a reminder of the better times. Tony recalls the moments they’ve spent like this, sitting together with no words exchanged, just enjoying each other’s presence.
“Me? Lonely? Please,” Tony replied, taking a swig of his beer before he could say something stupid like
On the bed, amidst the torn bedsheets and pillows, was a dark brown wolf, larger than any normal wolf. Its silhouette was just barely visible, but its blue eyes were bright, cutting through the darkness and staring right at Tony. With a growl, it leapt off the bed, making its way over, snarling and revealing two rows of horribly sharp teeth.
Tony opened his eyes, fully expecting to see disgust and terror on Steve’s face. Instead, all he saw was a face full of wonder and amazement, eyes travelling over his body as he took in the new parts.
It really doesn’t surprise Tony anymore, how Steve knows him better than himself. He doesn’t even know how to respond because it’s the truth. As much as he wants to, he can’t just give up. How can he when he’s partially responsible for half the world turning to dust, when he has the capacity to actually do something about it?
Tony has never looked more irresistible.
Tony looked at Steve incredulously. Did he really think this way?
Smiling, Steve walked over, standing in front of him. With both hands, Tony touched Steve’s face, his fingers slowly tracing the hard line of his jaw, the few wrinkles that had grown in the two years that he had last touched him like this. As he did this, Steve stared at him with such a tender look that he could barely breathe, hardly able to understand how he was lucky enough to have such a man.
Maybe it’s the lighting, the way the setting sun casts everything in a golden hue. Maybe it’s the fact that they haven’t seen each other in two years and he’s missed him every single day. Maybe it’s the beard. He doesn’t know why, but he has never felt more attracted to Steve.
“I’m fine. Nothing’s wrong. I just…” He trails off, eyes never looking up.
As Steve gets closer, things become clearer. The head of thick brown hair. The distinct facial hair. Bits of red and yellow armour. All of which can only belong to one Tony Stark.
Those three words took Tony aback. In his centuries alive, he never would have thought that anyone would say that to him, much less a werewolf who was his best friend and now his mate. Those three words sent a whirlwind of emotions through him, but they were all good feelings, feelings that mirrored Steve’s own. Steve loved him, and Tony loved him back just as intensely and fiercely, loving him in a way that he never knew he was capable of.
Steve immediately stilled. He said softly, “Do you want it to fade?”
Tony could barely believe what he was hearing. Steve had been hiding his feelings for five hundred years? “All this time, this was happening and you didn’t tell me?”
“I was being stupid… I’m sorry,” Steve repeated before forcing a fake smile, one that only worked to highlight his pain. “Let’s just pretend this never happened, okay?”
It was an attempt at levity, but Steve still appeared just as serious. Looking at how handsome he was, hair perfectly styled, wearing his fire department t-shirt, it finally dawned on Tony what he had been so afraid of this entire time.
So there he was, in the Black Widow, a small bar tucked away in a small corner of New York. It was frequented by both human and supernatural alike, but the former had no clue about the latter, so a human appearance was needed to even enter. (Not that Tony minded. He never liked how his horns messed with his hair. Neither did he care much about his tail, which always got in the way of his shirts.)
“No.” He shakes his head. “You’re lying.” But Steve hears it in his voice. He already knows it’s the truth.
“All this time.” Tony was still confused over this entire situation. “You’ve been watching me?”
As if on cue, they step towards each other. Tony collapses into Steve’s embrace, head burying into the blond’s chest. Steve’s arms wrap around him instinctively, pulling him in close.
“Steve Rogers, look at me.” Tony wanted to shout at him, but he knew he couldn’t, not when Steve was feeling so scared. “You didn’t force me to do anything. I came to find you on my accord. I slept with you because I wanted to help you. And when you told me that you wanted me as your mate, I agreed, but not out of pity or obligation, no. I wanted to be your mate because I wanted you to be mine.”
“Just looking at this.” Tony was amused at the physical intimacy. Steve really was like a giant puppy. “Surprised it hasn’t faded.”
Was he trying to make a fool out of him?
Immediately, Tony released a huge sigh of relief and sat down, running his hand through the thick fur. The wolf leaned his head into Tony’s palm, wagging his long tail behind him. Tony scratched the top of the wolf’s head. “You just a huge puppy, aren’t you?”
“Oh really?” Natasha had her eyebrow raised, her voice in a tone that told Tony that she already knew everything. “About what?”
There was no reply, and all Tony heard was Steve’s breathing. For a moment, Tony wondered if he had passed out. Then, the door swung open.
“Condoms and lube are in the bottom drawer.” Steve bent down to get them, giving Tony a questioning look. “What? I like to be prepared.”
There was silence. Then, the guilt and fear dissipated, and in their place came fondness, devotion, and reverence. A smile grew on Steve’s face, his blue eyes now bright and radiating happiness. “I love you.”
“It was… perfect,” Steve says, and in that moment, it finally dawns on him that he never had the chance to thank Tony. “But I only managed to live that life because of you.”
When Steve looks up, he sees tears forming in Tony’s eyes.
Over the next few weeks, Tony received even more gifts.
“Yup!” Rhodey said proudly as he went around the room collecting money. “We made bets on when you two would finally get your heads out of your asses and get together.”
Suddenly, she looks up. “I think it’s time for someone else to welcome you.”
“Well, I’m grateful,” Tony says, turning to Steve. “Couldn’t have asked for a better group of weirdos to take care of her. Honestly, I feel safe knowing she has them looking out for her.”
was something different.
Laughing, Steve pulls away, sniffling as he holds back the tears, noticing that Tony’s eyes are glossed over with tears as well.
After three more days, Steve’s rut finally ended. Steve had graciously allowed Tony to shower first, which he had, now standing in the bathroom as Steve took his own shower. Looking into the mirror, Tony scanned his body, only to find all the marks that Steve had disappeared, except for one. The bonding mark was still there, unaffected by his healing factor. He brushed his fingers over it, following the ridges left by Steve’s bite, pressing but feeling no pain.
Tony speaks up just as Steve says something too. Both stop, and Tony hates how awkward things are between them now.
“Why not?”
He let go, licking his lips for the remainder of the blood. Pulling back, he saw Steve’s eyes go dark. Tony’s lips were swollen and stained red, irresistible to Steve’s growing hunger. With a growl that sent a shiver down Tony’s spine, Steve said, “My turn.”
Tony closed his eyes, concentrating on the feeling of Steve’s huge cock in him, so full and so perfect, nothing like he had ever experienced before. It was almost unbelievable how good he felt, a feeling which only got better as Steve started moving, hands moving to Tony’s hips for better traction.
Thor is standing at the other end of the room, waving his axe around as he argues a point. It’s been even longer since he last saw Thor, and if it isn’t for his size and height, he would be unrecognizable with his shorter hair. He has a scar across his right eye, now a different colour from the blue of the other. It’s not just the appearance, but he can see that the god has suffered a great deal more than most in the room.
wouldn’t have let you. The team needed you, you know that. And I did what I had to do to bring my family back.” Natasha smiles at him. “We won. It was all worth it. So, you have nothing to be sorry about.”
“Or it could go perfectly well and we change history.” Tony rolled his eyes at that response, earning him a laugh from Steve. He pulled the demon’s hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to the knuckles. “Either way, it’ll be worth it.”
“You found your mate?” Tony asked, trying his best to pretend he didn’t feel a pang of jealousy and disappointment. “That’s… That’s great! Who is it? Have you done anything yet?”
“I don’t remember you being this good the last time.” Tony said, pushing back the hair that stuck to Steve’s forehead.
Steve is waiting for Tony’s response, but he can’t think of anything. He can’t find the right words to tell him how tired, how grateful, how scared he is. All he can focus on is Steve’s hand that is wrapped around his, how large and warm it is, how much rougher it’s become, how it touched him all over last night, how his fingers were inside of him, bent at just the right angle-
He wanders. He turns a few corners, goes through doors that aren’t locked, climbs up a couple of flights of stairs. Right when he’s starting to think that he’s lost, he opens a door to discover that he’s on a small rooftop garden.
“Nope, they’re for you.” Bruce flipped over a tag that was hanging at the bottom of the bouquet, showing Tony’s name written on it. “See?”
“Of course,” Steve says, and finally, they talk.
He has Nat, he has Peggy, he has Tony. And in this new place, wherever it is and whatever it is called, he’s comforted by the fact that he’ll never have to lose any of them ever again.
The initial pain from the bite having deflated his knot, Steve pulled out with no warning, leaving Tony feeling empty at the sudden loss, but also deliciously filthy as some of Steve’s cum dripped out of his hole, staining the sheets below him.
He reaches for his face, feeling no loose skin and barely any wrinkles.
Steve replied in kind, moving back and pulling on Tony's hips until he was on his knees, his ass sticking out. The movement had caused more of Steve's cum to leak out of his hole, the sensation of it drip down the back of thighs leaving him feeling utterly depraved, but also an emptiness that had him whining, desperate and needy.
Biting down onto Steve's neck, one thought went through Tony's head:
“You’re such an idiot, you know that?” There's no malice behind Tony’s words, but it still had an effect on Steve, and Tony could see his ears drooping and his tail hanging between his legs.
“You guys should just bone already,” Natasha said out of nowhere, completely breaking Tony’s concentration and startling him until he almost dropped his coffee.
“He really shouldn’t have,” Bruce said softly. “I can pay for my own beer.”
“I love you too, you dumb dog.” Tony was almost embarrassed at the amount of affection Steve was sending him. “Now come here and kiss me.” And they did, Tony’s arms wrapping around Steve’s neck as their lips met.
“And Captain Rogers.” Tony releases the breath he didn’t know he was holding. “They are in Wakanda, Sir. They were protecting the stone.”
He looks out the window and sees that it’s still dark.
Tony pushed himself up, looking around. The room had been cleaned up; the bed fitted with new sheets.
Tony finds comfort in that, because even with so many gone, by some miracle, he’s still here. Steve is still here. The rest of the original Avengers team are still here. And as long as they’re still here, they’re going to do everything in their power to make things right.
Bruce’s instantly blushed. These two, on the other hand, were, despite all their denials, pretty much a couple already. And while it was getting annoying seeing the two of them being so lovey-dovey towards each other, Tony was more than happy for his friend.
With no prompting, Steve’s own hand moved to cover Tony’s over the curve, no doubt as a result of their bond. Steve pressed a soft kiss to the top of his head, sending a single thought back:
They’re talking but he hears none of it.
Perhaps it's because he had already come before and he was overstimulated. Perhaps it's because of the bond. Perhaps it's another newly discovered kink. Whatever it was, he couldn't care about that right now, not when he was experiencing his second orgasm of the night, which seemed impossibly better than the first.
Tony was so aroused that he didn’t even care that Steve had ruined a perfectly good shirt. He cared even less when Steve nuzzled into the crook of his neck and took a deep breath, the wolf in him finding Tony’s scent. Tony knew that he should be afraid, with his neck exposed and so close to the mouth of a werewolf, but all he did was shiver at how intimate the gesture was, at the rub of Steve’s five-day old stubble against the sensitive skin, hand running through Steve’s hair to hold him close.
Confused, he pushes himself up, only to realise that his back no longer aches, the joints in his hands no longer sore. He looks down at them, only to see that they are free of wrinkles and blemishes, now looking like the hands of someone in their late twenties or early thirties.
“Oh, for God’s sake.” Natasha rolled her eyes, grabbing Tony’s collar so that they were eye to eye. “You go talk to him right now before I force you to.”
Steve took a step forward, crowding Tony against the desk, pressing their bodies together. Feeling that solid, warm body on his, Tony couldn’t help but moan. Steve pulled away at that. “We’re in the open, we probably shouldn’t…”
Lifting both his hands, Tony holds the sides of Steve’s face and pulls him in for a kiss, only this time, he lets it deepen. Tony takes his time to savour the feeling, because if their days together are numbered, he’s going to enjoy every last second of it, Fate be damned.
Steve stares straight at Tony. “You saved
So, Tony watched as this perfect specimen of a man played with the puppy, carrying it in his arms. Given instructions by the photographer, he started posing, and Tony was perfectly content just watching until Steve glanced over and they locked eyes.
Tony liked Natasha. She was a modern siren, her words a dangerous weapon that could control anyone to do anything. Tony learned that the hard way when he tried to sweet talk her the first time he entered the bar and she made him stab himself in the knee. Even though it healed within an hour, it still hurt like a bitch. Since then, they struck up some weird mutual understanding. Most of the supernaturals feared her, but he knew she had a kind heart underneath that rough exterior and striking red hair.
Tony releases a shaky breath. “I know, but if he was back home, then I wouldn’t have to…”
Thrusting his hips back, Tony gasped Steve's name out as the man's cock pressed right up against his prostate. He clenched, drawing another growl out of Steve. "
God, was it glorious. Tony was being fucked faster and harder, Steve thrusting into him with reckless abandon. Tony was in an uncomfortable position, aching with his legs held up, the burning friction as Steve’s hips slapped against his ass and the back of his thighs, but he absolutely loved it. It was as if some unknown part of him had finally been unlocked. The fullness as Steve’s cock moved in and out of him, the delicious ache of his muscles, the feral look on Steve’s face; in all of his dreams and fantasies, Tony had never imagined it to be as perfect as this.
Steve’s face was flushed red, self-conscious about all the sudden attention. Tony, on the other hand, stood up. “If you all must know, Steve and I have been together for almost a month now. We reconciled our differences during the fundraiser.”
“When the hell did this happen?” Clint shouted from across the room.
Steve said that he wouldn’t get it because he was a vampire, which was fine by Tony. He didn’t need a mate; all he needed was fresh blood every few days and he was good to go.
"I don’t want to hurt-" Before Steve could even finish the sentence, Tony dug his nails into Steve's arm, forcing him into consciousness.
They entered the elevator, and when the doors closed, Tony wanted to ask a question, but it never left his lips as Steve pinned him against the wall, hands on his hips and lips on his neck. Tony’s breath hitched as Steve’s mouth traced his neck and jaw, kissing and nipping the sensitive skin. He pressed a knee between Tony’s legs, rubbing up against Tony’s growing erection.
On his way there, Tony couldn’t stop wondering what had happened. It wasn’t like Steve to ignore his messages. Something must have happened to him in his rut. Tony recalled Steve’s last ruts, remembering that Steve had come out of them completely worn out and almost sickly, but Steve told him it was nothing to worry about. So, of course five whole days of no contact set off all warning lights in Tony’s head.
Tony looks into those blue eyes and sees everything. Concern. Understanding. Devotion. Reverence. Warmth.
Tony couldn’t control the sounds that he made at this contact, trying his best to focus on kicking off his shoes and jeans without hitting Steve. Once that was done, he reached forward to pull on Steve’s shirt. Steve broke the kiss, tossing his shirt on the floor, followed by his own pants, briefs and shoes. Tony watched this little show, staring at the perfect body in front of him, getting impossibly more aroused when he saw Steve’s large cock, remembering how full he felt when it was inside him those two years ago.
It has to hurt, if the grimace on Tony’s face is anything to go by. And as amazing as the feeling is, it hurts for Steve too, Tony being way too tight for either of them to find pleasure. Steve can feel the slickness of lube and knows that Tony had prepped himself, but it’s not enough when it’s this sudden. Tony tries to move but the pain is too much. That’s when Steve sees the tear that rolls down his cheek.
, Tony thought as he leaned forward, meeting Steve in a kiss. His life was finally going to be a lot more interesting.
After telling his part of the story, of what went down in Titan, he found a seat right at the very corner of the room and he’s been there ever since. From this corner, he watches as everything carries out. Shouting, arguing, pleading. Everyone’s tired, bloody and beaten, but nobody’s willing to rest.
So for me, I always imagined that Pepper and Tony have always remained friends, and that Steve and Tony got together after the first Avengers movie but broke up after Civil War (obviously). That's all the backstory you need to know!
“Well, we’re definitely not the first ones to have sex.” It wasn’t uncommon before the pact, Tony thought, for angels and demons to have sex. It was mostly angry sex, a spur-of the moment fuck, full of hate for each other. More often than not, it would end with both sides feeling disgusted with themselves for what they’d just done. It’s exactly because of this that there were few, if any, angel-demon couplings. After the pact was drawn, it made it even more unlikely. The inborn hatred towards each other made them the most incompatible of supernaturals. Again, Tony could only wonder how Steve managed to ignore all of that. “I mean, fucking is one thing. Being a couple… I can’t even imagine how that would work.”
, Tony thought. “As friends. We were talking like friends. All he said was that Thor wanted to pay for Bruce’s drink.”
Tony genuinely smiled at this. This was the one that finally convinced him that it couldn’t be someone within the station that did it, because as far as he knew, all their art skills were pretty bad. (Except for the sketch artist, but Tony was ninety-nine percent sure it wasn’t her, but only because she already had a girlfriend.)
Tony was getting ever closer; he just needed that bit more to push him over. It was at this point that his inability to form words turned into an inability to control the words coming out of his mouth, his brain-to-mouth filter completely turned off. “Oh my God, Steve, I’m so close - Fuck, you’re so big, I feel so full - We should have done this so much sooner - Only you know how to fuck me so good - Harder, I want to feel it tomorrow.”
Tony watched as Bruce pulled out a fifty. “Even you?”
“Because it’s the last thing I have from you.” That pained smile returns to his face. “And I was hoping that maybe one day, I could call. And you’d be there. When I needed you”
That caused Steve to pause, body still half off the bed. After a moment, he sighed, climbing fully onto the bed, resting on his side to look at the demon beside him. He frowned, his halo almost seeming to dim as he did so. “I don’t know.”
“How would I when I know you’ll be lonely without me?”
But he still wanted something new. Something to spice up the bland and routine of his days.
Tony watched as he moved back, standing at the foot of the bed once again, only then realising that besides his erect cock, Steve was still fully clothed, while he was completely naked. A flush reached Tony’s face, but the embarrassment soon disappeared when Steve took off his shirt, and Tony nearly drooled. Wide shoulders, muscles everywhere, not a single mark or blemish anywhere. Those gorgeous biceps flexed as Steve bent down to remove his jeans and shoes, and when he straightened back up, Tony could only stare at the man who was built to almost perfection. He was so distracted that he almost didn’t notice the pair of pearl white wings that appeared out of Steve’s back, or the faint ring of light that formed over the crown of Steve’s head.
Besides, it was only three days. It was just going to be like any other rut of Steve’s. He could wait three days.
It starts off soft and simple, but then Tony crosses his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling him closer until he’s sitting in the blond’s lap. The kiss deepens, but now, neither of them are in a rush for this to go anywhere.
She turns to Steve, hand coming up to rest on his knee. “And like you, I know I’ll get to see them again one day. I’ll just have to wait a while.”
It wasn’t long before Steve moved away, and from the corner of his eye, Tony saw him go to the bathroom. Tony took this opportunity to flip himself onto his back. This was going to be their first time; Tony didn’t want to miss the look on Steve’s face.
“Okay then.” Tony’s heartbeat picked up at how earnest Steve was being. “I’m all yours.”
“Why didn’t you?” Steve is sure he already knows the answer, but he wants to hear it.
Tony tried the door, and when he found it locked, used the keys Steve had given him. Tony opened the door, only to find the apartment in a complete mess. Things were strewn all over the floor, and there were claw marks everywhere, especially the sofa, with the spot where Tony had sat five days ago totally destroyed.
Then I begin to think:
But then they started talking, and it was then that Tony realized just how much he’s missed Steve. Because as angry and hurt he still is over the whole Accords thing, he still cares. And as much as he tries to convince himself, he has never stopped caring, and he knows that Steve hasn’t either.
As his knot grew bigger, Steve thrusts sped up, the bed creaking and threatening to break from the sharp movements. Tony, meanwhile, could only hold on for the ride, nails digging into Steve's back, realising that he was about to come untouched, something that rarely happened.
“Yeah.” Steve doesn’t even attempt to hide it. Why would he, when he’s so happy to see Nat again, after what she did. “I’m so sorry.”
As he pumped his fingers in and out of Tony, Steve continued biting marks along Tony’s chest, marks that would eventually disappear by tomorrow morning. “Don’t wanna hurt you,” Steve said, breathe hot against Tony’s collarbone. He spread his fingers, opening up Tony even more.
“Yeah,” Steve laughed breathlessly. He lowered his head, whispering low and rough into Tony’s ear. “And I don’t want to come until I’m deep inside you and you’re screaming my name.”
, he thinks.
“Then why did you take so long?”
Two years and he’s changed so much. Two years and he’s still the boss.
He feels Tony’s hand touch his, and he looks into those brilliant brown eyes as they call to him. It’s almost like he can sense what Tony’s asking for. He leans back down, forcing Tony’s body to bend with him. Just like his thrusts, he kisses Tony slow and deep.
“Oh God.”
“As if I’m that talented.” He then cocked his head over to the fire station. “They’re Cap’s.”
“I don't,” Steve says in response, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t try.”
He thought that when he first saw Steve, the feelings from two years ago would come back. Resentment, betrayal, heartbreak. But none of them did. Instead, when he stepped onto the airstrip and saw Steve running towards him, he felt nothing but relief. Then Steve was holding him, and for the first time since all this started, he felt safe. Warm. As if the world around him hadn’t gone to hell and he hadn’t just lost who knows how many people that he cared about.
Several endless minutes later, Steve finally removed his fingers. Tony sighed at the emptiness, but also in relief at the knowledge that Steve was finally going to move on. Opening his eyes, Tony watched as Steve opened the bottle of lube, using a decent amount to slick himself up.
“Of course.” Steve was smiling at him. “I could sense your dark energy the minute I walked into the bar.”
“For everything,” Steve says. “If I had known that the stone required you to… I wouldn’t have sent you there. I would have…”
Tony heard the click of a bottle lid, and a few seconds later, felt two slick fingers pressed against his hole. As they pushed in, Tony couldn’t control himself any longer, breaking out of the kiss into a long moan. Steve took the chance to press kisses and bite bruises onto Tony’s skin, along the collarbone, down the sternum, marking any patch of skin that was available, all the while opening Tony up with his fingers.
Five days later, and Steve still hadn’t contacted him. He wasn’t answering calls or texts either, which was strange considering that Steve always responded immediately. That worried Tony, eventually deciding to go to his apartment.
Why has Fate decided to bring Steve back to him?
The long moan that Tony lets out is encouragement enough, and Steve keeps going, taking his time to open Tony up, brushing his prostate every now and then. God, the sounds that Tony makes. Steve doesn’t know how he’s survived two years without this man.
Steve nods. “He did, for a year or so. It took him a while to come to terms with it, but he has.”
Tony's fangs involuntarily extended as the smell of blood reached his nose. "You ready?"
The mystery behind the secret admirer was finally solved on the day of the joint fundraiser, held by both the police and fire departments. Small stalls were set up, where anybody from either department could sell their goods, whether it be old clothes or handmade trinkets. The fundraiser was open to the public, so the small little road between the two stations was packed.
The answer is clear from her pained smile alone. “Of course, I do. They’re my family; I’ll always miss them. But as long as they’re safe and happy, then I’m content.”
He barely hears Nebula when she asks him for their next destination. It’s only after the third call that Tony, still looking at his hands, replies, “Earth.”
It took a while for both of them to get back to their senses, panting hard as they came down from their high. When they finally looked at each other, they couldn’t help but smile and laugh a little at how dishevelled the other was.
He knows that Steve still loves him even when he’s so broken and damaged.
Before Tony could think too much into it, Steve’s lips were back on his, hands running up and down his sides. Tony felt his whole body jerk up at the suddenness of it all, his hips grinding up against Steve’s. Tony’s hands ran through the blond’s thick hair, trying his best to mess it up even further. Steve pulled away, reaching for a pillow and placing it under Tony’s hips. Tony couldn’t help but smile at that, how the angel still cared for him at that moment.
Every year, the fire department would release a calendar that they would sell to raise money for charity. It was immensely popular, especially since all the photos were of the firemen, shirtless and holding cute little baby animals. Sure, Tony and the others made fun of them the first year, but after seeing how much money was donated, the entire police department considered doing their own.
Tony had never actually seen the photoshoot before, always opting to escape the noise and crowd, but since they had some time left, they decided to stop for a while to watch.
Tony hates how tense everything is becoming, so when they move apart, he says, “Would you shave the beard if I asked you to?” Because as good as Steve looks with a beard, Tony does miss his clean-shaven look.
"Yours," Tony sighed, thrusting his hips back again to meet Steve, whose movements became more erratic and abrupt, his breath punctuated with grunts and pants. Tony knew then how much of an effect he had on his new mate, understanding that Steve was just as much his and he was Steve’s.
Tony wanted nothing more than to take everything back, but before he could, Steve just said, “I’m gonna go” and walked away.
“Well I’m glad that I managed to exceed your expectations,” Steve replied, a goofy smile on his face.
But the smile he had on became a million times brighter when he spotted Bruce. Making his way over, he greeted everyone else before turning to Bruce. “Hi,” Thor said shyly, as if he wasn’t shirtless and didn’t look like an actual god.
If this were any other scenario, Tony would have hated how Steve was treating him, acting as if he were weak and fragile. But right now, he was more than appreciative of Steve's concern. "I'm fine, just give me a second… God, you’re big."
Tony tried again, his hand trembling in front of him. “It’s Tony! Your friend!”
Too caught up in these sensations, Tony didn’t even realize Steve had shifted him slightly until one thrust had him seeing stars. Every single thrust now rubbed directly on his prostate, and Tony knew it wouldn’t be long before he reached his climax, the heat and tension already building up deep inside him.
He looks at the man now, who is looking earnestly back at him, and can’t believe just how much love he feels.
He surges forward, capturing Tony’s lips in another searing kiss. This time, when he pulls away, the words come out before he can even process them.
The moan that escapes Tony’s mouth travels straight from Steve’s ear to his dick, because it might have been years since he’s last heard it, but fuck if it isn’t the hottest thing. He’s so lost in the sound that he doesn’t even realize when Tony pushes a hand into his track pants until it wraps around his hardening cock.
And Tony still loves him all the same.
He finally turned back to Steve and saw the worry that had taken over his face, clearly a result of the long wait. A small smile reached Tony’s face. “You’re crazy,” he scoffed. “This could all end horribly, you know that? And if it does, it could start a war.”
“I love you,” he says, pressing kisses down Tony’s neck.
The wolf didn’t seem to hear anything, approaching closer, its white teeth bright in the darkness.
Pulling back, Steve handed him more than enough money to pay for the drink. “In case you guys go for a second round.” With that, he headed back to his table, but not before saying, “I’ll see you around, Tony.”
“You better not.” Tony could only flush at how sincere Steve sounded, hiding his own smile behind his beer bottle, because he’d be damned if he let the werewolf know just how clingy he, a vampire, was.
Tony turned to see Steve sitting on a chair, with a long line of children in front of him, waiting to get their face painted by him. Seeing Steve with the paintbrush in his hand, it finally all made sense. How the secret admirer knew exactly what Tony liked, how Tony never saw any strangers hanging around the place, how they could so easily get the help of Tony’s teammates.
As they waited for the elevator, Steve said, “You know, you still haven’t told me your name yet.”
Tony wondered, turning to the person in question, but the question never left his mouth as he stared in amazement at how Steve’s hair managed to stay perfectly styled despite the strong breeze and lack of helmet.
Steve pulled his fingers out, and he said, “You know, you’re pretty masochistic for a demon.”
That small smile returned to Steve’s face. “I’ve watched you, Tony. You’ve made friends at that bar, and you look out for them. You even help the younger demons, you’ve become something of a mentor to them. You may be a demon, but you’re not all evil. There’s good in you too. I’ve seen it.”
At that moment, Steve looked at him, and with those bright blue eyes and warm smile, Tony knew, deep down, that this was the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, that those three words would come naturally sooner or later.
Then, immense pleasure, pleasure that wasn't just his, but Steve's too, combining and blending with Tony's to create a sensation so intense that it overwhelmed all of his senses.
But that’s not why Steve can barely breathe. It’s because this is the Tony he truly knows. Not the one he saw in the alternate timeline when he was returning the stones. Not the one who he took care of and watched grow up in the timeline where he grew old with Peggy. This Tony is the one from his own reality, the one he spent years arguing with and fighting alongside with. This is the Tony he had so deeply hurt, the one that he somehow managed to patch things up with even after everything. This is the Tony that sacrificed his life, the one that he watched die.
It doesn’t take long for Steve to realize that he’s talking about that young kid. Peter. He knows how much that boy means to Tony. To him, it was a second chance to be a better person. To make up for past wrongs.
Steve said nothing in response, only smiling into Tony’s hair and pulling him closer. Tony huffed, but burrowed into the warmth.
He glances up to Steve, who is sound asleep, snoring softly. He’s lying on Steve’s chest, with Steve’s arm wrapped around his waist.
“I've missed you too,” Tony said before pulling him in for a kiss. Once their lips touched, it was like a spark ignited inside him, and Tony wondered why he had pushed Steve away, why he wasted all that time when they could have been like this from the start.
But none of that has happened. No fighting, no arguments. They’re about to have sex, and while Steve knows that it’s probably not the right time for those three words, he can’t help it. It may have been two years since he’s said it, but Steve’s feelings for this man are just as strong as they were, maybe even stronger.
All the while, Steve nods and smiles, savouring the warmth and contact from where Tony is so firmly holding onto his hand.
Tony didn’t have time to dwell on these feelings, because the next thing he knew, Steve flipped him onto his front, bracketing his hips with his legs.
Steve smiled against Tony’s temple. “Just want to make sure you feel as good as possible, sweetheart.” Honestly, Tony would have hated that nickname if he wasn’t in the position he was currently in, but his body involuntarily shuddered, his cock beginning to leak pre-cum at the mere sound of Steve’s voice alone, rough and husky against his ear.
“For what?” Natasha looks at him with a sad smile on her face.
Tony wasn’t blind. Thor was attractive as hell, the number of people screaming his name and taking his picture attesting to that. Tony just wished they could be a little quieter, because they did still need to do work next door, and there was legitimately one time the station almost went into a state of emergency because they heard hysterical screaming, only for it to be the fangirls reacting to Thor flexing.
The change in Steve’s expression was drastic. It was as if a literal cloud had appeared over his head. The pain in his eyes was so intense that Tony’s heart ached, made only worse by the fact that he was the one who caused it. “I guess I was wrong then.” Steve couldn’t even look him in the eye. “I’m sorry.”
“Tony?”
“I’m serious! I-” Tony was cut off by Steve’s lips crashing onto his, now his turn to grind their hips together. The friction between their growing erections had Tony moaning, throwing his head back only for Steve to attack his neck, pressing kisses and biting marks onto the column of skin. His hands went down to undo Tony’s jeans, pulling them down along with his briefs, hand then coming up to palm his now fully erect cock.
Next to Bruce is Natasha, arms folded on the table as she listens. It’s not even her new blonde hair that surprises him; it’s the fact that for first time, she looks defeated. In all the time that he’s known her, she has always been confident, unapologetically badass. To see her like this… it scares him.
Steve positioned himself, kneeling between Tony's legs, hands going to his hips to pull him closer. Holding himself in one hand, Steve slowly pushed into Tony's warm heat.
As for the rest of his team, his family? It might be a while, but he knows he’ll see them again. He’ll just have to wait a while. Until then, he finally has a chance to make things right with Tony, a chance that he sure as hell isn’t going to ever let go.
Playfully rolling his eyes, Tony pulled him for another kiss, one that was full of pure affection. Sure, Steve was completely naked, and Tony’s shirt was stained with his own cum, but for Tony, the moment couldn’t have been more perfect.
Tony stills beneath him. “What?”
“You bought the calendar?” Steve asked, and Tony turned around to find the offending object, open to the very picture that Steve was posing for that day.
He had said that light-heartedly, expecting the same response from Steve. But after seconds of silence, Tony glanced up, only to see a look on Steve’s face that he couldn't place. He wanted to say something, Tony could tell, so he waited, hoping he hadn’t said something wrong.
Tony mouthed along the outline of Steve’s hard length, which earned him a groan from the blond above him. With a smirk, Tony reached under the elastic of the briefs, wrapping his hand around Steve’s erection, almost whimpering from desire when he noticed his hand barely managed to wrap around it. He gave it a few pumps before pulling it out, licking his lips at the sight before him. He’s watched plenty of porn throughout his life, and he’s been with enough men, both human and supernatural, to know that most of it was fake and to never expect too much. But Steve, Steve’s was big enough to put all of them to shame. To think that this thick, hard length was going to be in him soon was enough to make Tony shiver with anticipation.
Tony gives himself a mental slap. This is not what he should be thinking of right now but seeing as he can trust neither his words nor his thoughts, he decides to use his actions. Shifting a little closer to Steve, he rests his head on the blond’s shoulder.
Minutes later, they stopped. Tony got off first, taking off his helmet to get a good look. In front of him was a tall, red brick apartment block, identifying the neighbourhood to be in Brooklyn immediately.
“‘-than never to have loved at all.’ Yeah, I know, but it doesn’t mean it’s going to hurt any less.” Tony felt the warmth of Steve’s palm against his own, focused on it to drown out the noise going around him. “I’m just scared, you know?”
“Yes, you dumb dog. I’ll be your mate.” Tony rustled Steve’s hair, imagining his big wolf ears perking up.
“Tony?” Steve asks, instantly concerned. “Are you okay? Did something happen?”
The blond continued. “That day, during the photoshoot, I saw you staring, and the way you were looking at me, I just thought-”
Steve wants to say he’s sorry, but that’s the last thing either of them need. Instead, he lifts his hand to the side of Tony’s face and brings their lips together.
Rogers. He looked good tonight (not that he ever not looked good), with his tight button up shirt, his blond hair combed perfectly. Tony would have kept on staring if he hadn’t noticed Steve staring right back at him.
It was at that moment that Tony knew what to do.
“What-What are you?” Tony could barely form words, but he had to know.
Knowing that Tony is watching, he pulls his shirt over his head, letting it join Tony’s clothes on the floor. (Maybe he even flexes a little, just to show off.) He pushes his pants the rest of the way off, kicks it away. He strokes himself, relieving some of the tension, all the while looking straight at Tony, watching as the older man bites his lower lip to suppress a moan.
Letting go of his hand, Steve stood in the middle of the room, looking around. “Why did you bring me here?”
Instantly, he finds himself in the Avengers tower. Walking around, he notices someone outside, sitting at the edge of the quinjet landing pad, silhouette illuminated by the setting sun.
, Tony thinks, slightly optimistic for a second before the truth dawns on him.
“Who are you helping then?” Tony continued, attempting to get those thoughts out of his head.
Steve doesn’t stop until he hears Tony say his name. He pulls away and he looks, sees how Tony is red with a full-bodied flush, cock leaking pre-cum onto his stomach.
He can feel Tony’s shock, his body stiff and awkward, but within seconds, Tony relaxes, hugging him back just as fiercely. The feeling is overwhelming, and Steve doesn’t want it to end.
Tony felt the head of Steve's cock enter him, and that alone was so intense that Tony involuntarily stuck a hand out to grab Steve's arm.
“I love you,” he says, breathed out against Tony’s collarbone.
He knows that losing him is like losing a child.
He feels his pulse speed up, the onset of an attack. The Avengers could be gone. And Tony’s greatest fear will have come true. That all of them are dead. All of them except him, left to live among the dead and ruin.
As he calmed down, Tony became aware of Steve's hands, one under his own, the other on his thigh, trembling with intense, barely held back desire. It hit Tony then, how much Steve was holding back, how much willpower he was using to not give in to that carnal desire, to make sure that Tony was comfortable before doing anything and that he would enjoy it too. This realisation, more than anything, cleared his head.
Tony shook his head. Now that it was laid out in front of him, he couldn’t understand how he didn’t realise it earlier.
. This exposed Tony’s neck even more, and Steve pressed wet kisses and bit hickeys into the column of skin. Tony tried calling out to him again, but he shut right back up when Steve growled.
Seeing Tony like this, seeing him so broken, Steve just wants to hold him until all the broken pieces are forced back together again. But he knows Tony hates that, to be treated like a fragile toy, to be pitied. So as much as Tony may need it, Steve waits, letting him make the first move.
Thanos had done it. Gathered all six stones. Snapped his fingers. Now half the universe is gone. And Tony’s still here. Of course he is. Fate has never been kind to him. Fate would rather let him suffer in life than in death.
He wonders about who’s gone and who’s left. The only death he is certain of is Vision. That’s the only way Thanos could have gotten the mind stone. But Tony knows it wouldn’t have been without effort. Knowing Bruce, he would have contacted Steve. And knowing Steve, he would have done everything in his power to protect Vision.
, a go. And if you’re willing, I would like to really get to know you. Not that I haven’t already, but it’s different now that we can talk face-to-face.” A pause, then, “But if you’re not, then I’ll be fine with it too. If I must go back, at least I can take with me the memory and experience of having met you.”
“Hello Steven.”
“You… You’re an angel.” Even as he said it, he could barely believe it.
Tony wakes up to an unfamiliar room and an unfamiliar bed.
And for some reason, once he was done, they brought him to this meeting, where they’re discussing plans on what to do now, on how to get the others back.
Steve sees the moment when Tony notices him. He stops, a few steps away from the older man.
Steve’s eyebrows shot up at the request. For a second, Tony was afraid he was being too forward, but then Steve’s face settled into a smirk. “Your place or mine?”
Tony opened his mouth to respond, but closed it, knowing full well that Natasha could find a crack in whatever excuse or explanation he came up with. Instead, he walked away. “I need another coffee.”
Once he was out of ear shot, Tony let out a huge sigh. He hated the effect that man had on him. He couldn’t understand why he was still feeling this way after everything. Again, by the time the drinks came, he had pushed all these emotions to the very back of his head. It had been a long day; now was the time to drink and relax.
Tony closes his eyes, hoping that that isn’t the end of the list.
Steve moved back up Tony’s body until they were face-to-face again, those blue eyes staring right into brown. “Turn over,” he said, voice low and husky. Tony didn’t hesitate, flipping over onto his front, gasping at the sudden friction between his erection and the sheets. He wanted to move some more, but Steve’s hands were back on his hips, holding Tony firmly against the mattress as his lips were back on Tony’s skin, planting kisses down his spine.
He could hear the trepidation in the angel’s voice as he spoke. “What if… what if that’s what I want?”
A hologram of it appears, and before anyone can say anything, Rocket (Steve learned his name after he was finally tired of Thor calling him Rabbit), jumps in from out of nowhere. “I’d recognize that piece of junk anywhere! That’s Quill’s ship! Let them in!”
Then there is Steve. If he’s honest, he only looked at the others to avoid staring at the man. Steve’s at the head of the table, completely exhausted but staying awake to see this through.
Steve turns around to see Peggy, as young as beautiful as the day he first met her. She sits herself down next to him. “Thank you, Natasha.”
She smiles in return. “And Clint? How is he?”
Fate has brought them back together only to tear them apart.
All the while, Tony was just trying not to come right there and then. A hand in Steve’s hair, he pulled him forward for a kiss, trying to get as much of Steve as possible, as if to make up for all the lost time. By the time Steve added a third finger, Tony felt like a complete mess, his body flushed all over. He just wanted Steve to hurry up already, but he knew that Steve was going to make him wait, just like he made Steve wait for two years.
"I feel… good." With his mind clearing up, Tony realised that while he could hear Steve's thoughts, it was in broken up phrases and sentences, and that he could sense Steve's emotions more than anything. The connection wasn't perfect, but Tony didn't mind it one bit. "I feel
Steve’s eyes immediately went dark as he crashed their lips together, and Tony felt his entire body relax, sighing into the kiss as one single thought crossed his mind:
Tony could barely keep still as he watched those blue eyes track his every movement. It was a while before Steve finally reacted, bumping his nose against Tony’s hand, those eyes now filled with recognition.
“I just did,” comes the reply. He sits down, and Tony sees that he’s wearing
Steve gestured back towards Thor. “The big guy. He wanted me to let you know that he wants to pay for whatever Bruce wants.” Steve then leaned forward to whisper, “If I’m being honest, if you wanted Thor to pay for all your drinks, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind either.”
“Do what? Stop you from staring?” Natasha had that smirk on her again.
"You look so beautiful like this," Steve said on a particularly deep thrust. "So warm and open. Just for me."
“You’re in pain,” Tony said, close to pleading. “Just let me help you.”
P.S. Extra brownie points for anyone who spots the Hunger Games reference I threw in!
When they first kissed, it was like a fire ignited within Tony, and he wanted nothing more than to touch Steve, to have Steve touch him, to feel Steve inside him, to be fucked senseless.
“How’s Bruce?” By the look in her eyes, Steve knows that she still has a soft spot for him.
Nebula answers with silence, putting in the coordinates and piloting the ship. Tony’s grateful for it as he sits and closes his eyes, trying to hold back the inevitable panic attack. Besides the humming of the ship’s engine, the cabin is absolutely quiet, nothing but the weight of what just happened filling the air.
By the time he reaches the hips, Tony is a quivering mess, moaning at the slightest touch. Still, Steve takes his time, savouring the feeling of having Tony below him, open and receptive to anything. He kisses along Tony’s hip bones, now more prominent that he remembers, as he pushes the man’s legs apart. Avoiding his dick, Steve continues pressing open-mouthed kisses along Tony’s inner thighs, the latter now squirming at the friction between the former’s beard and the sensitive skin.
“Why would I lie, raccoon?” The scowl on her face weakens into one of sadness. “They’re gone. All of them.”
He doesn’t say anything in response. Not that Steve expected otherwise. He knows why it’s difficult for him to say it back, especially after everything that’s happened. It’s enough that he’s said it, and that Tony hears it.
“Tony?” Steve asks, and Tony realizes that the fear must show on his face. The blond’s eyebrows are furrowed, worry clouding his expression. Tony wonders if he should tell him what he’s thinking, but he knows that deep down, Steve realizes it too. Instead, Tony leans forward and presses his lips to Steve’s.
If he wasn’t already a demon, Tony would have sold his soul to get a taste of that man.
“So,” Tony said, running a hand through Steve’s hair. “Do you want to tell me what happened?”
Steve’s face turned red again, as he said, shy and quiet, “I think I just did.”
Smiling, Tony took that hand and moved it, placing it on the back of his head. He leaned forward, tongue darting out to lick the head of Steve’s cock, instantly feeling the hand on his head grip his hair. Taking that as encouragement, he licked all the way down, then back up, following along the vein underneath. With one final lick, he wrapped his lips around the head, slowly sucking his way down Steve’s entire length. Once it hit the back of his throat, Tony started swallowing around it, hand coming up to stroke the rest of what he couldn’t fit in.
“Yes, it has.” The doctor pours the drink into the cups. “And you’ve done a lot in that short while, haven’t you?”
“He killed Gamora to get the Soul stone,” she says, voice unwavering. “We tried to stop him, but... Quill, Drax, Mantis. They’re dead.”
Steve desperately wants to go, but he knows that he can’t leave without saying anything, not after everything he’s been through with her. “I love you.”
There’s something else there too. Something, a look, that Steve can’t place when he first notices it. It seems to stick out, but he finally understands what it is. It’s everything that Steve has been saying, something that Tony can’t express.
With a gentle push, she directs him towards the door. After one last look back, he walks through the door.
Steve raised an eyebrow, that smirk growing bigger, clearly not believing any of it.
“He’s good too. Been training all his kids in archery. Won’t be long before we have a whole gang of little Hawkeyes in the world.”
He has Steve.
, Steve thinks, kissing along the edges of the long scar. He can feel Tony watching him. He knows Tony always feel shy and awkward when Steve does this, but he does it anyway, because he wants him to realize that having that scar doesn’t make him anymore or any less flawed.
“Unfortunately, no. I’m here to help someone buy a drink for someone else. Although, if you wanted me to get you a drink, I definitely wouldn’t mind,” Steve said, flirting right back.
He looks into those blue eyes and sees them filled with wonder and love, all of it directed at him, and realizes that he doesn’t need words to tell Steve everything.
Coming down from his high, he feels Tony’s hand against his face, brushing the hair out from his eyes. He reaches up to hold that hand, turning to press a kiss to the palm. And finally, Tony smiles at him. A small, but genuine, smile.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice cut through his ranting.
As the medics rush to Nebula and all the focus is on them, from the corner of his eye, Steve notices movement from the ship. A small, hunched figure walks down the stairs. Steve is just about to activate his shields when he sees a small source of light shining from the figure’s chest.
“You need to get out, before I-” Steve stopped, taking a deep breath. “I refuse to force you into such a thing. There’s a horrible word for such an act, and I would never forgive myself if I did that to you. So please,
Even though he saw his name, Tony couldn’t believe that someone would give him flowers. “Do you know who did this?”
They aren’t enough to say “You’ve finally come back to me.”
She knows immediately. “Mr Hogan and Miss Potts are gone, sir.” A pause, then, “I am so sorry.”
Tony looked at his reflection.
Each thrust is agonizingly slow, leaving Tony breathless at the feeling of Steve’s thick cock moving in and out of him. Steve goes harder and deeper, and Tony’s moans let him know when he hits that sweet spot. He changes his angle, and now with every push back in, he soaks up the delicious sounds that escape Tony’s lips.
“What, you would have sacrificed yourself instead? We wouldn’t have let you.
“Yes?” Tony replied, still confused as to why Steve would stop in the middle of what they were doing to point out such an obvious thing. “Everybody in the department always gets one.”
He looks at this new Steve, and he feels things that he hasn’t felt for a very long time.
“But…” For a moment, Tony thought about what would happen to them if they actually got together and if they were found out. He was already from hell, so it wasn’t like he could be sent any lower. Maybe he would just be forbidden to ever go back to Earth. There was a good chance that he would only get a light reprimanding, then a praising from his boss for being able to corrupt an angel. He might even become famous for doing so. Being a higher-level demon, he knew that he would only face minimal punishment. But for Steve? Even humans knew what happened to angels if they sinned. “You’ll be forced out of heaven.”
“No, it’s not fine, and no, you weren’t dumb. It was me.” As Tony said this, he reached out to touch the back of Steve’s hand, to which the blond stared at him.
Tony could only stare at him, a million and one questions running through his head. Who the hell was this guy, and why the hell wasn’t he terrified of being with a demon, not to mention wanting to sleep with one? And now, he wanted to see Tony in his true form? Who, and what, was Steve?
Staring at the man, beautiful and perfect in front of him, Tony didn’t know what to say. So, he did the next best thing. He reached up, grabbed Steve’s face in his hands and pulled him down, kissing him with all the meaning he couldn’t put into words.
Steve resists the urge to reach for Tony’s hand. “Thank you, Tony. For everything. You saved the world. You saved the team.”
When, not if.
“Okay, I’m out,” Rhodey said, heading back to the station. “The two of you are too much.”
"Don't laugh," Steve said, feigning a pout which only sent Tony into a greater giggling fit. "The steaks ran out pretty quick."
Letting out a sigh, Steve turned to Tony. “I found the person I want as my mate, and I think this is the wolf’s way of getting me to do something about it.”
Then again, because the next few gifts were all sketches, Tony knew there had to be a contact inside the station, telling the secret admirer that Tony finally liked something.
He rubs his left arm, feels the numbness seeping back into his body, into his muscles, into his very bones.
, Steve thinks,
. Steve almost forgot that in his original timeline, Peggy was a huge presence in Tony’s childhood. Still, he’s glad that they finally got to meet again. “Yeah, I did.”
As Steve walked them towards the bedroom, Tony got rid of his shirt, pulling it over his head and tossing it to some corner of the room. Steve immediately attacked the bare, tan skin, mouth travelling along the base of Tony’s neck and collarbones, all the while gripping and massaging Tony’s ass. All Tony could do was hold on for dear life, arching his back to get more friction between them, his still covered dick rubbing hard against Steve’s torso.
Sleepy after two orgasms, Tony absent-mindedly trailed his hands down his torso. He almost dozed off until he noticed a slight swell to his belly. Running his fingers over his skin, Tony’s mind didn’t immediately register what it was. When he finally did, the blood rushed to his cheeks, burning at the realisation of just how much of Steve’s cum was inside him, completely filled up, just like Steve promised. It all felt so wrong, but so right at the same time.
“Thanks.” Tony takes it and finds that it’s still warm.
By the time Steve pushed in another finger, Tony was nearing his limit, wondering why Steve hadn't reached his. "Come on, Steve. What’s taking so long? I’m ready." The whine that left his mouth was so needy that Tony blushed at how desperate he sounded.
“Nebula!” There’s movement in the group. Rocket pushes through, runs towards her. “What the hell happened? Where’s the others?”
Looking back at Steve, Tony said, "I'm okay now" and gave his hand a squeeze.
That alone is enough to send Steve running down the airstrip.
Slowly, he shifts Steve’s arm away and crawls out of bed. He grabs his clothes and heads to the bathroom to wash up. His body aches, especially his back, and when he puts his clothes back on, he tries to ignore the itchiness from what he assumes to be beard burn along his thighs.
The defeat in his voice was so palpable that it took Tony aback. It was only then that he realised just how cruel he sounded. “Steve-”
You would think that tormenting humans and persuading them to make bad decisions every day would be fun. Which it was, for the first couple of hundred years. Now, it was getting a little tiresome. Day in, day out, doing the same thing all day, every day.
“What the hell, Rogers? Why the fuck are you giving me stuff? And why are you acting like some sort of secret admirer?” Tony was mad, seeing no reason why he would do such a thing unless he was trying to make fun of him. “If this your idea of a joke, you have gone too far, because-”
Ignoring the fact that he was slightly turned on, Tony inwardly sighed at how insatiable his mate was. Still, he couldn’t blame him; Steve probably wanted to make up for all the lost years. Tony did too, but they had the rest of eternity to do so. They had time. So instead, he smacked Steve playfully on the chest. “How are you still so horny? Aren’t you starving?”
Silence hangs in the air between them, heavy with so many things unsaid. Steve wants these things to be said, so he says, “Tony, talk to me. Please.” He hates how desperate he sounds, but he is. It’s been two years since they’ve talked properly, even more since they had a proper conversation that wasn’t an argument. He doesn’t even care that Tony still hasn’t looked at him. He just wants him to say something.
Steve notices the look on Tony’s face, and wants nothing more than to have the ability to send Tony back, to revive him just so that he can spend his life with his family, the one that he so completely deserved, one that he got after so long only for it to be snatched away.
As they talked, he heard the door to the bar open, and almost immediately, a calming aura filled the entire space. Tony turned, and when he laid eyes on the new customer, he nearly dropped his drink.
A silver of doubt and worry enters his mind. He thinks about Peggy, about how they had literally spent a lifetime together as husband and wife. He thinks about Pepper, about how Tony’s waiting for her too. He starts to feel guilty about having such thoughts, about feeling such things.
Face still red, Steve nodded. Smiling, Tony cupped the side of his face, running a thumb over his cheek. “Good. Now let’s get you down here.”
He carded his hand through Steve’s hair, pulling him down until they were face-to-face. Now, it was Tony’s turn to whisper into Steve’s ear. “
Minutes later, Steve finally withdraws his fingers. Tony sighs at the loss, and Steve’s hand is back on his thigh, rubbing soothing circles as he uses his other hand to lube himself up. He positions himself, and with a deep breath, pushes into Tony, not stopping until he’s buried all the way to the hilt.
“So, the gifts, the flowers, the sketches…” Tony looked at him incredulously. “Were you trying to… court me?”
“How could I? You said it yourself multiple times; you never understood the whole mating and bonding thing.” Sadness now clouded Steve’s expression. “But it’s more than that. You’re my friend. You’ve been my friend for six hundred years. I couldn’t risk it.”
Natasha scoffed. “That was two years ago, when the both of you were too drunk out of your minds to realise that you had feelings for each other.”
“Now?” Steve asked as he finished up the stars on a little boy’s cheek.
“Me too.” Clint called out as he caught up with Rhodey. “Any more of this cheesy romantic shit and I’m gonna puke.”
Travelling into Wakanda, Tony was so focused on getting here that he didn’t have the energy to appreciate the scenery. Now, he finally sees the country in all its glory. He can’t believe something could be this beautiful, the city bursting into view as the sun continues to rise, to shine its warm light. The hills come to life too, so far away but still so majestic. It all looks so peaceful and serene.
Tony recognised that tone. Whenever Steve used that tone, he was going to go on a long speech, lecturing Tony and trying to convince him to not do whatever it was that he was about to do. Tony always listened and nodded along, but not this time.
Steve was blushing again, but he didn’t look away. Still smiling, he asked, “So, how should we do this?”
Steve has said it several times before, and Tony himself has said it back, but this time is different. It’s been two years, and for Steve to say it after everything that’s happened, after everything they’ve just been through… Tony has no idea what to feel.
“That’s easy for you to say,” Clint mumbled as Rhodey collected the money from him.
Tony didn’t know what to think.
They talk, but it isn’t long before the bottle is empty. Dr Erskine gets up, and Steve follows.
The figure looks up, and with the biggest smile, he says, “Hi Cap.”
Despite what he’s always told himself, he has never really stopped loving him.
He was so focused on this that he didn’t even notice that Steve had stepped out of the shower until he was coming up behind him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. “What are you doing?”
Tony was frozen to the spot. In all the years they’ve known each other, he had never actually seen Steve in his werewolf form, but now that he had, everything was telling him to run, to make a break for it before he got hurt, or even worse, killed. Yet, a small part of him told him that that wasn’t going to happen. This was Steve for Christ’s sake. He was the gentlest man that Tony had ever known. He might be a werewolf, but he was still Steve.
“Seriously though, they do have good fondue here. And shawarma too, who knew!” Tony reaches out his hand to Steve. “Come on, I’ll show you!”
Tony pats his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t cry on me now, Cap. This was supposed to be a happy reunion.”
Tony immediately snapped back to attention, facing Natasha while blood rushed to his cheeks.
Steve returned with a bottle of lube, which he promptly threw onto the bed when he found Tony stroking himself to find some relief, biting his lip to stop the sounds he was making, eyes full of pure anticipation. Tony knew exactly what he was doing, making himself look as irresistible to Steve as possible, and by the way Steve’s eyes darkened even more with lust, and how he immediately got back onto the bed to pull Tony into a deep kiss, Tony knew it worked.
Steve knows that he loves Peggy. He always has, always will, but what he feels for Tony is so intense that he can’t put it to words yet he knows what he feels is real, feelings that have been growing with every word and smile that Tony has directed at him ever since they first met.
Tony’s hips jerk upwards, causing both men to break the kiss at the friction. Taking it as a sign things to move on, Steve reaches for the lube, coating his finger with a generous amount. He teases, rubbing two fingers around Tony’s hole before pushing them in, all the way to the second knuckle.
Turning back, he stole one last glance at Steve, who was now talking to the puppy. That one image alone made Tony’s heart beat ten times faster.
Steve reaches for that hand, feels it shaking. “Even if you did, if Thanos still snapped his fingers, he still could have disappeared. You wouldn’t have known.”
He felt Steve unbutton his pants, so he lifted his hips, letting him pull them off, followed by his briefs, sighing at the relieved pressure on his hard, leaking cock. The sudden exposure left him shivering, but was immediately warmed up by Steve, running his palms and lips down Tony’s thighs. While he removed Tony’s shoes and socks, Steve left wet, open-mouthed kisses down the smooth insides of Tony’s thighs, always careful to avoid touching his dick, which left Tony a whimpering mess, desperate for any form of relief. “Steve,” he breathed out, trying to get the blond to speed up.
Tony stared at him, trying to recall everything he had learnt about werewolves. Werewolf omegas had a bonding gland on the back of their necks, and the Alpha that made their mark on that gland would be their mate. Tony had always thought it would be more complicated than that, considering that mating was for life, but no, it really was that simple.
“You first,” he says, still unsure of what he actually wants to tell Steve.
“Are you kidding me?” Clint glanced at the man before turning back to Tony. “You show off your powers to hook up all the time.” He turned to Bruce and asked, “What’s up with him?” to which Bruce could only shrug.
Grabbing the helmet, he rolled his eyes before putting it on. He hopped on behind Steve, grabbing the man’s leather jacket as the engine started. Before he could ask Steve why he wasn’t wearing a helmet, the blond turned around and smiled, “Hold on” before speeding off into the night.
Tony has his head thrown back the entire time, shaking as Steve enters him. Steve can barely hold himself either, Tony so unbelievably warm and tight. He gives Tony a moment to get used to the feeling, and when he looks back to nod, Steve starts moving.
And of course, right in the middle, was none other than Steve Rogers, the captain of the team. Steve
So, maybe now’s not the time to talk about it, but Steve knows that they’ll get to it eventually. He’s still not sure how any of this place works, but all that he does know, and all that he really cares about, is that he’s not alone.
“Stop frowning, darling. You look horrible when you do.” Peggy’s voice breaks him out of his thoughts. “You’re thinking so hard that I can hear your thoughts. And yes, I’m aware of everything that’s happened in both realities.”
Something was definitely wrong.
“Good. Great.” Steve’s mind can only churn out the most basic of vocabulary, mostly because he’s too focused on staring at Tony. “How about you? Are you… at peace?”
If Tony is being honest, he doesn’t remember. Steve has this ability to make him lose his train of thought. But he’s always been able to think quickly.
Steve tosses the bottle of lube onto the bed. But he is in no rush. Tony is finally back after two years. He doesn’t know if what they’re about to do is going to be one-time thing or not. If it is, he has no intention of letting it end that quickly.
It’s a smooth glide in, seeing how Tony prepped himself before, but it’s still too tight. So, Steve spreads his fingers, opening the older man up for what’s to come later. Slowly, Steve works in a third finger. It’s been two years since they last did this, but Steve remembers, bending his fingers at just the right spot.
he was looking for. So he held back. He would still hook-up every now and then, if he felt attracted to that person, but after a while, it wasn’t worth it anymore. He focused on his work and he never really thought about it until now.
Again, Peggy understands him much more than he does. “We’ll have plenty of time for dances, but for now, I think there’s someone else that you want to see, isn’t there?”
“Tell me you want this.” Steve’s voice was low and husky, and Tony knew he should not have been as turned on by it as he was. “Because once we start, I won’t be able to stop.”
“Oh my God, are you blushing?” she smirked, so obviously entertained by what was going on her in front of her.
“Have you seen yourself?” Tony asked incredulously. “You were shirtless! And yes, while I find you unbelievably attractive, it wasn’t just me. Everyone was staring, even Nat! And you had a freaking puppy in your arms! How could I not look at you?”
Steve nodded. “I didn’t want to hurt you… but I didn’t want to lose you either.”
And just like that, Tony did.
Tony’s words are cut short, but only because Steve can’t control himself anymore. He pulls Tony into a hug, and nearly cries at how warm Tony is, solid and strong and
Tony feels his heart literally ache. Happy. Pepper. Gone. He can imagine them waiting, desperately waiting for his return, only to turn into dust. He can almost feel it adding on to what was already on his hands.
Steve shook his head. “I don’t want them. I want you. And I don’t care that you’re a vampire. You’re much more than that to me.”
Steve will always hate himself for how the whole thing with the Accords went, how the team fell apart, how he had to fight his own friends. Worse of all, he hated how he treated Tony. It was a horrible fight that left both sides and both men broken. In the end, what good did it do anyway? Nothing, and Steve regrets every moment of it.
A few days later, Tony arrived at work to find a bouquet of flowers on his desk. Convinced that the flowers had been delivered wrongly, he carried the bouquet over to Bruce, sure that they were meant for him.
“Stark.” Steve smiled, and goddamnit, why was he this cute?
“Yes,” he panted out, and was rewarded with a smile and a hard thrust against his prostate. It was all Tony could do to close his eyes and listen to the harsh sound of skin slapping against skin, focusing on his own climax that was building up.
He had never felt anything like it before. His lips were literally tingling, a sensation that travelled throughout his entire body. Steve’s mouth opened under his, hands moving back to grip Tony’s hips, pulling him impossibly closer. Tony could feel Steve’s growing interest, and if the bulge pressed against him was anything to go by, he was big. He couldn’t help but moan at that thought, only for it to be swallowed up by Steve.
“Very funny Barton,” Tony said dryly. “Why would I have a secret admirer?”
“I should have just called you,” Tony says as he finally looks up, and any fear that Steve has is washed away by the sight of those brown eyes. “Maybe if I did, things would have turned out differently.”
Un-beta'd so all mistakes are my own!
“Well, how about a new bet?” Natasha asked, a devious smile on her lips. “When do you think these two will get married?”
When Steve turned back around, the shock and confusion was clear on his face, but he still forced a smile. “I never thought of you as a person who liked face paint.”
It took a moment, but Tony decided that yes, he was. He wasn’t going to let Steve go just like that, not after everything they’ve been through.
“If it means keeping you safe and happy, then yes. I would do anything if it meant protecting you.”
Again, Steve is broken out of his thoughts when Tony suddenly speaks. “I’m starving!” He gets up, and looking down at Steve, he says, “Do you want to fondue?”
“At least you admit to it.” Natasha glanced between the two. “Are you going to do something about it?”
“Come on Steve,” Tony whined, turning his head to try and look at the other man. “Fuck me.”
“You know how some angels are assigned to watch over humans?” Tony nodded. He had never actually met any guardian angels before, but he had felt their power a few times when he got too close to the humans they were protecting. The effects varied greatly, depending on the angel. Best case, a headache. The worst he got was broken ribs, having been pushed by an invisible force. “Yeah well, some of us, including me, are assigned to demons.”
. He looks so… normal.
Immediately, Tony sat down and started searching. After a while, he found out that the white flowers were gardenias.
As the ship enters the atmosphere, a familiar voice fills Tony’s ear. “Sir? Sir can you hear me?”
“It may be, but still, I am so proud of you,” Dr Erskine says, and Steve remembers what he had said to him that night before the experiment.
Tony doesn’t know how much time has passed when Steve speaks up again. “What was it that you wanted to say earlier?”
It’s from this spot in the room that he truly sees how few of them are left.
There was no response.
“You need to go, Tony,” Steve said, voice rough and strained. “I’m… I’m still in rut.”
Tony can’t help but feel so small, so insignificant. Thousands of deaths just occurred in this country alone, but it seems like nothing has happened. Nature doesn’t mourn, it just carries on.
After that, it was coffee, which, although weird, Tony greatly appreciated. Written on the cup was: ‘I like you a latte’, which again, was a lame pickup line, but Tony did enjoy the pun. The coffee was made to his own specific preferences, which made Tony sure that someone in the station was behind all this.
Un-beta'd so all mistakes are my own!
“Steve.” Tony breathes his name out, almost a whisper.
Once they reached the bedroom, Steve lowered Tony onto the bed, the latter watching as the former stood at the foot of the bed and slowly took off his leather jacket, revealing the t-shirt that barely contained his huge biceps and well-sculpted body. He grinned, knowing that Tony was enjoying the show, locking eyes with him as he crawled back up the bed, holding himself above Tony. He captured his lips in a slow, deep kiss, before kissing his way down Tony’s body, occasionally teasing the skin between his teeth hard enough to leave marks.
“You know, I thought it’d be a few more years before you joined me here,” Peggy says, a small smile on her face.
Tony must have sent that desire out, because Steve was hard again, rubbing against the cleft of Tony’s ass, which only amplified Tony’s lust even more.
He remembers watching as Steve repeated it, seeing and hearing nothing but genuine love from that man. It wasn’t something blurted out in the heat of the moment, but it came from a place of genuine fondness.
“Nobody’s going to come up here.” Tony ground his hips up against Steve, causing the blond to shudder. “Besides, we’ve waited long enough, don’t you think?”
“Hey, you sure you’ve got enough food?” Tony asked, flopping onto the sofa.
Tony couldn't get enough, but he knew he had to stop. He wasn't going to leave Steve drained and exhausted; he wanted a round two, and he was sure that Steve did too.
Steve leaned forward, breath tickling the hairs on Tony's neck. He ran his teeth lightly over the bond mark, and in a husky voice, said, "Then come for me."
Next was a box of donuts, attached with a card that said: ‘I donut know what I would do without you.’ “This is stereotyping,” Tony had said in response. “Yeah, but don’t you like donuts?” Rhodey asked. Tony kept quiet after that.
“Werewolves mate for life,” Steve reminded Tony. He knew what that meant. They were immortals. It meant for the rest of eternity.
“What?” Tony glanced at his friends, wondering what the hell they were doing. Then, when it dawned on him, he looked back up at Steve.
Then, he remembers what Peggy told him
“Hi! What are you doing here?”
Perhaps it’s an inappropriate thing to think about at this moment, considering how the others are discussing ways to bring back the dead, but when he looks at Steve, he feels…
The first thing Tony noticed when he woke up was that Steve was gone.
Somehow, Tony managed to maintain enough focus to pull off his own jeans and briefs, even as Steve started nipping the fragile skin along his shoulder. Sure, it would have been hot as fuck to let Steve rip them off as well, but he still would like to have some clothes to go home in after all of this.
Steve rests his forehead against Tony’s, and all he says is, “I know.”
“Nothing,” Steve said, averting his gaze. Even if they weren’t bonded, Tony would have known immediately that he was hiding something.
“It’s me, Steve. You wouldn’t hurt me, would you?”
Luckily, the pain lasted only for a moment, immediately followed by a wave of calm washing over him, body relaxing into the mattress as he stopped fighting against the bite
“How’d you find me?” Tony asks, eyes never leaving the view.
As they move people into the palace, her bracelet lights up. At the press of a button, a voice comes through. “General, an unidentified aircraft has just entered Wakandan airspace.”
“So… what did you tell them?” Tony wondered what he had done, what Steve had saw as an emergency.
“Of course I’m sure,” Tony said, never feeling more genuine about anything else than he did in that instance, but there was a bit of self-consciousness tickling the back of his mind. “How about you? You sure you want a vampire as your mate? There are probably tons of werewolf omegas out there who would be better for you.”
He says it again, this time looking straight into Tony’s eyes. “I love you.”
“But it’s like you said, we’re mortal enemies. So why are you here?” Tony asked, still wondering why an angel would willingly spend time with a demon.
As Tony sipped on his own whiskey, Natasha said to him, “Saw you flirting with Steve.”
Steve’s hands moved to grip Tony’s ass, kneading the muscles and exposing him. Just as Tony was about to call out Steve’s name, he felt the other man’s breath against his hole, the name leaving Tony’s mouth in a choked gasp as Steve’s warm tongue pressed against his tight entrance.
Steve and the others follows, no mood to even question who the hell this Quill is and why he has a spaceship. Steve walks to the airstrip, trying not to think about the dust that covers him, that covers everyone. Even Bruce, who had become uncharacteristically chatty after two years, is silent as they wait for the spaceship to land.
He imagined what it would be like. He would have to tell the guys over at the bar. Natasha would probably gloat over the fact that she was right for pushing him to talk to Steve. Bruce would be grateful that someone else would be dealing with the trouble he caused. Clint would just laugh over the entire situation and how ironic it was for him to have a guardian angel. And Tony? It would greatly affect his work, considering how he could no longer use his body as temptation, but he was a natural born charmer. He could do just as well. The only real difference would be that he would have someone to spend his time with. Someone that would listen to him and be with him willingly. It seemed like such a foreign thought, but looking at Steve, he could actually imagine it happening.
“Holy fuck!” It had been awhile since he hooked up with anyone, much less have someone do
“I love you,” he says, over where the arc reactor used to be.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “I’m old-fashioned, what can I say?”
Those words bounced around Tony's head. Three simple words, but they were so genuine and so pure. Tony's heart was so full. In that moment, he wanted Steve to be his mate just as much as Steve wanted him. He finally understood how Steve felt, this deep longing and desire for someone to be his, a sudden possessiveness simmering under the surface.
“Neither am I,” Steve continues, shaking Tony out of his thoughts. “I’m going to be right there with you.”
“I’ve liked you for a while now,” Steve said, a shy smile on his face. “Way before we slept together. But after that night, when you told me what you wanted, I respected it. That was until recently, when I felt things were changing between us, so I thought…”
“Of course I did. I had to, seeing how I was Steve’s contact,” Bruce sighed as he handed over the money. “Don’t look at me like that. If I didn’t help, would the two of you have ended up together?”
Using more lube, Steve slicked himself up, positioning himself at Tony’s hole. The demon couldn’t help but tense up at that feeling, but all his worries went away as Steve pushed into him, inch-by-inch. The heat and fullness left Tony breathless, the tingling sensation now travelling from inside out. (It was only after that he realised that this was his body trying to reject the contact of the angel, his demon instincts warning him of the danger, only for him to ignore all of it.)
As his group gathered at their usual table, Tony looked over to see who was on the other side. On one end of the table was James Barnes, the only fireman Tony ever knew to have a prosthetic arm. Challenging him to shots was Sam Wilson, an ex-air force pilot. The two of them always acted like they hated each other’s guts, but virtually everybody in both departments knew they were friends with benefits.
This time, Tony’s the one to pull him into a kiss, and Steve can feel all the emotions behind it. He knows that it’s his way of reciprocating and for now, it’s enough.
Trying his best to hold it together, he asks, “Who’s still here?”
Nat smiles, getting up to leave. She tells him, “I’ll find you afterwards, okay?” and disappears.
Too caught up in his thoughts, he doesn’t even realize that the ship has been in hyper speed until Nebula speaks up. “Ten minutes to Earth.”
Waiting for the face painting session to be over, Tony headed over once the last child was done. As Steve was turned away, Tony sat down in the opposite chair.
Silence filled the room again as Tony tried to think of a reply. He had never actually given any thought about being a relationship. Being a demon meant that nobody would ever want him, so he had already accepted his fate a long time ago, prepared to face an eternity of singledom with hook-ups and fuck buddies along the way. Now that he had a chance, he didn’t know what to expect, or what would happen.
Tall. Blond hair. Incredibly blue eyes. Strong jawline. A ridiculous shoulder-to-waist ratio. All wrapped up in a sinfully tight white shirt, brown leather jacket, and jeans.
A pause, then, “Our kinds have existed for eons, Tony. I’m sure we’re not the first ones to have gotten together.”
Numb towards the dust that still covers his hands, no matter how hard he tries to scrub it off.
“Bruce told me to call, but I hesitated because…” Tony shuts his eyes, trying to suppress the bad memories. “Because of what happened.”
Tony sighed, at how he failed to realize any of this, and at the reality of their situation. “That’s why I pushed you away. I thought I should put an end to this before either of us had the chance to hurt each other.”
Pain. Blinding, searing pain. Pain that had Tony bite into the pillow to stop himself from screaming.
Tony turned to him, still wondering why the hell he was being so polite when they were waiting to go up to his apartment to fuck. But letting someone know his name wouldn’t hurt, so he told him. “It’s Tony.”
“I knew it!” Tony turned to see Rhodey with a huge grin on his face. He looked at everyone else in the room. “Time to pay up!”
Then Steve said those three words.
Steve wants to say something, anything, but he’s too caught up. In his moment of hesitation, Tony speaks up. “How is everyone?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “If you thought that was flirting then you obviously don’t know me. We were just talking.”
Tony was riding on the edge when Steve pulled away and pressed a kiss to the base of his spine, a finger coming up to rub around the wet ring. He moved away, leaving Tony cold again at the loss, but Steve was back before he knew it, a hand rubbing soothing circles on his back.
He can’t help but notice the way Tony says his name, the way Tony looks at him, the smile directed at him. All those were things he thought he lost after the whole fallout with the Accords, things he thought he would never experience again.
Instantly, Steve stopped, worry now taking over the desire that previously clouded his eyes. "Are you okay? Did I hurt you?"
All these ministrations left Tony breathless, torn between wanting to sit up and watch Steve, and wanting to just lie there and close his eyes to savour the moment. Before he could even contemplate what to do, Steve’s mouth closed around one of his nipples, suckling lightly while a hand reached up, thumb rubbing against the other.  Tony’s body jerked upwards, only to be held down by Steve’s free hand on his hip. He felt so warm with Steve’s large hands touching him, a sense of thrill hitting him at the thought of being pinned down against the bed by Steve’s large body. It was nothing like he had ever experienced before.
A shiver ran down Tony’s spine at the feeling of Steve’s warm breath against his ear. Mentally calming himself down, all he said in response was, “He just ordered a beer.”
Tony looked straight into them, trying to find the right words to express everything he wanted to say at that very moment. How scared he was, how unreal all of it felt, how the both of them were crazy for doing this. But all he said was, “Fuck me.”
He kisses Tony’s sternum, the scar where the arc reactor used to be. Steve recalls the first time they had sex after the surgery, Tony trying his best to hide the scar and make Steve ignore it. Tony had told him it’s a reminder of what had happened to him, of his terrible past. But Steve doesn’t see it as anything bad. He sees a miracle, because without the arc reactor, Tony would have died. Yes, it may have almost killed him, but it gave him life too. It’s because of the arc reactor that Tony has survived, and it is because of it that Steve could meet him. They may have gotten off on the wrong foot, but Steve can’t imagine what it would be like if Tony hadn’t entered his life.
“Shut up.” Tony didn’t know what was happening to him. He was a centuries old demon, for fuck’s sake. Why the hell was he acting like a smitten teenager over some random – but very attractive – stranger, he had no idea.
As the sun continues to rise, Tony hears footsteps behind him. He doesn’t need to turn around to know who it is.
“Well, you might want to control yourself,” Bruce said. “Don’t want you to pass out on the street again.” Bruce was a shapeshifter and one of Tony’s closest friends. He had a lot of trouble controlling his powers when he was younger, but he got the hang of it after a while. He was the friend that Tony called to get him out of trouble, to pick him up from the bar if he got too drunk, or to pick him up after a hook-up with a stranger. Bruce always complained about it, but still did it anyway, and Tony would always be eternally grateful.
“I got this for you,” Steve says, passing him a sandwich. “I wasn’t sure if you were hungry, but I was getting one for myself and I thought you might want one.”
Steve sighed. “I’m sorry.”
“Kinda,” was all Tony could reply. He didn’t really know how to describe his predicament without sounding pathetic for an eight hundred-year-old demon.
It’s an indescribable feeling. Tony never even thought he would get to see Steve again, not to mention watch a sunrise together. If someone told Tony that this is all a dream, he would almost believe it. But the ache of his back, the solid shoulder under his head, the warmth seeping into his palm, they let him know that this is reality. For that, he is grateful.
Before he leaves, he turns around and says, “Oh, and tell Miss Romanoff I said hello.”
. A sound so low and rough that Tony could feel the vibrations throughout his entire body. So he stopped trying to do anything, his legs falling to wrap loosely around Steve’s waist, letting the werewolf take him and use him and fuck him however he wanted.
Steve sighs in relief. He’s not sure how any of this works, but he’s happy that he’s able to be with the Peggy he grew old with, as well as the one that truly knows his experiences.
Just then, Steve moved away again, leaving Tony breathing hard, staring at him in confusion.
Steve nods, and without looking at Tony, says, “We’ll get them back.”
But something nags at the back of his head. Despite having most of his blood rushing south, a part of Steve knows something’s wrong, that Tony has something to say, but he can’t find the will to pull away and ask, his body is running on autopilot as Tony touches him.
Steve nodded in response. Slowly, inch by inch, he pushed himself into Tony until his hips met the back of Tony's thighs.
“God no. I have fantasized about my wedding, so no, it’s not that.” Steve was about to say something, but Tony stopped him. “And before you ask, no, it wasn’t the sex either. I… nothing can describe how great that night was. I might have been drunk, but I remember everything.”
“You know me so well,” Tony said dryly, turning to Steve, who was walking over with two beers in hand.
FRIDAY starts listing names, Tony relieved at how many have survived but also devastated at how many are lost. Then she finally reaches the names of the Avengers. “Agent Barton. Doctor Banner. Thor. Colonel Rhodes. Agent Romanoff.”
There was another round of screams, and Tony turned to see that it was Steve’s turn. And Jesus Christ, if Tony was any weaker, he would have had a nosebleed.
A few weeks later, Tony was at work when he saw Steve step into the bullpen. After handing a few files to another officer, Steve walked over, a bright smile on his face. “Hi.”
The feeling was so overwhelming that Tony felt like he was dreaming. He gripped hard onto the edge of the desk, knuckles turning white as Steve started to move. When he felt his hands slipping, he called out, voice now just a breathy moan. “Steve…”
For everyone who's commented, bookmarked or left kudos, you are just the best. Much love! Thank you for taking the time to read an obsessed fangirl's fic about how she wants these two idiots to reunite. Hope you enjoy! Again, all comments will be greatly appreciated!
And Steve smiles back, the same smile on his own face.
No, he thinks, Fate would never be that nice to him.
“Of course I was worried! I even visited you and everything! Don’t you remember the care package I gave you?” Tony looked up to see a smile on Steve’s face. “Wait, was that all you got from what I just said to you?”
Bonded werewolves shared a type of telepathic connection between them, where mates could read each other's thoughts. As a vampire, Tony thought it would be impossible for him and Steve to experience that, but having felt Steve's pleasure just as clearly as his own, Tony knew he was wrong. Maybe Steve's bite and desire to be mates made the connection possible, with Steve's blood in his system only serving to strengthen it.
“Why didn’t you get a new suit?” Tony brings up this question after Steve wonders about the new arc reactor. He gestures out to the city as he says, “It’s not like they couldn’t make you a new one. With their technology, it would have been amazing.”
Tony couldn’t help but scoff at how ridiculous all of it was. “Steve, you can’t be serious.”
The older man climbs onto the bed, over Steve. As the blond watches, he notices that Tony is avoiding eye contact. In the time they’ve been together, Steve’s learnt that this is a red flag, but before he can do anything, Tony positions himself over Steve’s cock, and guides it in.
Everything after that was a blur. Being welcomed back and hugged by everyone else. Carted off to the medical wing. He didn’t even have the energy to be amazed by Wakandan technology, how his wounds were seamlessly stitched up and made to look as good as new.
“I’ve missed you.” The words are out of Steve’s mouth before he even realises it.
“He’s good. In charge of the tech department now, along with Scott. Those two work surprisingly well together.”
That was all it took. Tony came with a groan as the orgasm hit, high on the euphoria that came with it. The pleasure he felt was unbelievable. No one had ever made him feel this good.
When Tony didn’t answer, he replied. “You still think we angels are all pure and innocent and naive? What part of any of this makes you think I’m innocent? Besides, everyone’s morally grey now. No one’s completely good or evil anymore.”
She points to a door at the end of the bar. “He’s just through there.”
It is in this silence that Tony is able to think, that he is able to feel. And with his aching body, he can only think about what happened last night. The things they did, the words that were exchanged.
So, what if his colleagues earned money off it, as long as he ended up with Steve, he didn’t really care. Maybe he would place in a bet himself; he could always use the extra money for the honeymoon.
“I forced you into this.” The feelings of guilt were stronger than ever. “You said it yourself that you didn’t believe in bonded mates, but I made you do it. You didn’t have to but you did. All because I couldn’t control my stupid urges. You only wanted to help, and now you’re stuck in this forever.”
That is all Tony feels. Numbness.
Steve’s only ever seen this vulnerable side of Tony, this part of him that he never reveals to anyone else, when they’re alone. Steve was the only one Tony could trust with all of that, and he betrayed him. And now, for two years, he’s suppressed it so much that when they’re finally reunited, it threatens to spill over in a huge mess of emotions.
And of course, he talks about Morgan.
The next thing he realized was that he no longer on the floor, but on the bed.
Half the universe has disappeared, but Tony and Steve are still here.
They aren’t enough to say “I’ve missed you.”
He looks at me with eyes filled with wonder and love
Steve can’t stop kissing him. Even if he needs to take a breath he only breaks away for a quick second before returning to Tony’s lips. Even as he lowers Tony onto the bed, careful not to touch his wound, they never move apart, Tony’s hands back in his hair, one of his own running down the side of the man below him, using the other to hold himself above.
And for now, that’s all that matters.
Demons weren’t supposed to reveal themselves, only in certain situations. And Tony was afraid that he would scare Steve away, but then he caught sight of those brilliant blue eyes trained on him, dark with so much desire and lust that Tony found himself unable to say no. So, he closed his eyes, focusing on his transformation.
He turns around, seeing rows of empty beds. At the very end is a lone figure, sitting on one of the beds.
“I don’t, but that doesn’t mean we should pretend like we don’t feel anything, or that we should push people away.” Steve moved to hold Tony’s hand in his. “Isn’t there that saying: ‘It’s better to have loved and lost-’”
Tony marched over to where Steve was. Noticing him, the blond looked up, and the sight of those blue eyes and warm smile almost broke Tony’s resolve. “We need to talk.”
Tony couldn’t believe what he just heard. “Are you crazy?”
“I’ve watched you at that favourite bar of yours. Drinking your night away. Picking up whoever tickled your fancy. Taking them or letting them take you in the restroom, the back alley, or if they’re lucky enough, back in your apartment.” He reached a hand up to Tony’s face, running a knuckle over the apple of Tony’s cheek. “But then it started happening less and less. Then it stopped altogether. I thought you were sick, but your energy was still as strong as ever, so that couldn’t be it. Then it dawned on me. They weren’t enough. They were never enough. They only knew you for a few hours. I’ve known you for centuries. They couldn’t take care of you the way that I knew how.”
He’s not sure what time it is, but the palace is silent, the only sound coming from his own shoes on the tiles. He’s not sure if it’s supposed to be this quiet, or it’s because half the population have been wiped out.
As they weaved through traffic, Tony couldn’t help but lean forward, resting his cheek against Steve’s back, seeking out warmth as the cool autumn air rushed past them. He could feel surges of energy at the points of contact, now completely sure that Steve was a lot more powerful than he seemed.
He doesn’t know where he wants to go, only that he needs to move. He doesn’t even know where anything is. He’s sure someone must have told him the layout and given him directions when they were bringing him to the meeting, but he heard none of it.
As Tony came back from his high, he could feel Steve slowly pulling out of him. He reached out to stop him, hand once again on his arm. “What are you doing? You haven’t finished yet.”
Tony thought for a second. Against his better judgement, he was curious about what Steve might actually be. Going to his place might be a great way to find out. “Yours. Definitely yours.”
But then he remembers how Steve held him, touched him, kissed him. How he looked at him. Even now, he glances at Steve, sees how his eyes are trained on the view in front of them, notices the pain and grief behind all that bravery and strength.
“I love you.”
It took a moment for Tony to process what he said. To take care of him? Tony had lived for almost a millennium, and he’d lived just fine by himself all these years, so why the hell would he need someone to take care of him?
Tony continues, voice wavering as he tries to hold back tears. “I should have never let him stay. I should have just forced him to go back home. Override the system of his suit or something.” He rubs his left hand, trying to rub away the dust that isn’t there anymore.
He was still so uncertain, so afraid to hurt Tony. Tony reached back for Steve’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “I trust you.”
“I don’t care.” Tony said through clenched teeth. “Just do it already.”
Wakanda is in chaos. The fields are littered with the dead and injured, covered with the fine dust of those that disappeared. Those that remained can only help, bringing the injured to whatever medical aid is left in the country.
“Thanks babe.” Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek, but when he moved away, he noticed the entire room had gone quiet. He looked around to see that the everyone was staring at them.
“How could I not when you look so irresistible?” Steve asked, his free hand running along Tony’s thigh. “But this isn’t your true form, is it? Show me. I want to see the real you.”
“What did you say to him?” she asked, arms crossed. “He looks like a kicked puppy.”
Steve’s face lit up, but there was still a hint of concern. “Are you sure?”
Steve had said those words hours ago, but he’s still no closer to finding the words to describe the immense tragedy of what just happened. Bucky. Sam. Wanda. Countless others. All gone and turned to dust at a snap. All that fighting and bloodshed for nothing.
“What if…” He started, heart racing as he prepared himself for what he was about to say. “What if you didn’t have to force me?”
As the door closes behind them, Steve holds onto Tony’s waist, walking them backwards. Tony’s hands are at his head, running through the still damp hair. Tony rubs up against him, and Steve realizes that he’s hard. Unconsciously, Steve’s hands grip harder and he grinds their hips together.
But the rest of the sentence doesn’t come. Instead, Tony’s hands reach up to grab the front of Steve’s shirt, and before the blond can process what’s happening, he’s being pulled down and his lips meet Tony’s.
Standing back up with two packets in hand, Steve opened the lube packet, spreading a generous amount over his fingers. Slowly, with one finger, he pushed into Tony, moving the digit in and out to get him used to the feeling before adding a second, opening him up for what’s to come.
Steve spread his fingers, slowly opening Tony up. Tony felt that it was almost too much but knew that what was coming was going to be a lot bigger. As Steve brushed past his prostate, Tony managed to gasp out, “What about you?”
He smiles at how well she knows him. “Peggy, I-“
Silence followed as Tony waited for a reply, taking the time to process his own emotions. He didn’t have to wait long though, because Steve soon said, “You were worried about me when I was in the hospital?”
"Don't worry, sweetheart," Steve said, voice low and rough. Using his thumb, he swiped up some of the cum, pressing it back into Tony's hole. "I'm going to fill you up nice and good."
Looking at Steve, Tony wonders why Fate is so nice to him all of a sudden. After everything that Fate has decided for him so far, why does Fate suddenly decide to let Steve live, to let them reunite, to let them have a chance to reconnect?
Tony looked over to Bruce, who was currently sipping his coffee, pretending that he was unfazed by all of it, when in reality, it was only because he had private access to such a view back home (minus the cats of course).
Tony keened at the sudden fullness, a mixture of emotions flooding him. Hunger, relief, desperation, embarrassment, and at the back of his mind, curiosity. He still couldn’t figure out what supernatural creature Steve was, not to mention one that would find him beautiful.
He doesn’t need words to show Steve that he loves him.
He leaves the bathroom to find Steve still dead asleep, having moved not even an inch after Tony left. He must be exhausted from the battle. Tony is too, the weariness still deep in his bones. He wishes he could sleep, but he knows he can’t. He’s too restless, the gears in his head already starting up for the day. So, he leaves of the room.
Confused, he looked to Wilson, who was the one at the stall. “Are these yours?”
Steve crowded him against the wall, one hand braced beside his head. Heat radiated off Steve’s body, adding to the internal heat that filled Tony after having seen Steve’s naked form. Being as close as they were, Tony had nowhere else to look except right at Steve, right into those eyes that were clouded over with various emotions.
Hi everyone, sorry for taking so long to update this! I was on vacation with my family in Canada, so I couldn't really edit this with them around. But anyway, here's the final chapter! I think it might be a little cheesy and cliche, but hey, don't these two deserve it after everything?
“I do.” Steve looked at him with nothing but pure fondness, and Tony wanted nothing more than to kiss him silly, but they were outside and there were kids around. So, standing up, he pulled Steve with him as he jogged over to the police station. Making sure that no one was looking, he went in, dragging Steve along with him. Ignoring Steve’s questions, Tony brought him to the bullpen.
Steve lets out a shaky laugh, barely believing his own two eyes. Even as he sits down, he keeps staring, hoping that this isn’t a hallucination.
“How was it?”
Paranoia starts tickling the back of his thoughts. What if this is all a dream? Or maybe it’s hallucinations, brought on by the trauma of the deaths?
He’s too lost in his thoughts that he almost misses what Tony says to him. “Oh, I’ve talked to Aunt Peggy by the way. Seems like you took my advice and had a good long life.”
“Look, Tony…” There was that warmth in his voice again, rounding out the letters of his name. “I want to give this, to give
Tony immediately turned away, pretending that he wasn’t just caught staring, that those blue eyes didn’t make him feel some type of way, a feeling that he hadn’t felt since their one-night stand two years ago. They were drunk, and when Tony woke up the next morning, the first thing he said was that they should pretend like it never happened. Not because the sex was horrible - Tony might have been drunk, but he was lucid enough to know that it was one of the best fucks he had ever experienced - but because… well, Tony didn’t know why. Not even now.
Tony can’t help but kiss Steve again, because they’re finally together again, and that was all Tony wanted.
“I love you,” he says, lips against Tony’s jaw.
Steve feels Tony’s warmth. He’s not dead. He’s not dust. He’s in his arms, breathing and alive.
Tony froze. He couldn’t even think about the emptiness he felt at the sudden withdrawal. He turned onto his side, staring at the blond. “You know what I am?”
“But you’re my idiot, so that’s okay.”
Tony doesn’t let him finish. “Don’t say anything, just-” He’s pulled back in for another kiss, and this time, he doesn’t hesitate.
The blond must notice, because he looks up, and they make eye contact.
Not that Tony was going to complain. He wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, the full skin-to-skin contact driving him crazy. Hand still in Steve’s hair, Tony pulled him in for an absolutely filthy kiss, to which Tony could feel Steve’s hands on him grip much harder.
They’re still alive, and now they’re together again.
“We’ll have plenty of time to talk later.” She presses a soft kiss to his cheek. “Now go. He’s waiting for you.”
“Obviously,” Bruce said, but then saw the look on Tony’s face. “Wait, you didn’t know?”
But Steve was already fast asleep, snoring softly, arms tight around his mate.
Tony’s hands went up to grip Steve’s back, claws drawing blood as he was almost bent in half, Steve fucking him hard into the mattress. It was so different from earlier, but Tony loved it all the same, watching as the angel slowly lost his cool demeanour, the halo blurring as hair fell from its previous style, sticking to the sweat on his forehead.
“I’m pretty sure ten packs of steak can last me three days, Tony,” Steve said, packing said steaks into the fridge.
With no hesitation, Steve grabs Tony hand. Following behind, he listens to Tony as he talks about all the food and activities they have in this place, about how Tony is going to bring him around to try everything.
So yes, Tony realised that he should have insisted, but hey, he was a cop. If anything happened, he had a gun. Hell, the whole station was full of people with guns. He would be fine.
Tony needed to know more. “When did it start?”
Not because he doesn’t love Steve, he does, but because those three words aren’t enough to convey everything that he wants to say.
Her eyes are watering, but Steve knows that she will not cry. He reaches up to hold her hand, knowing that she really is one of the strongest among them.
With every thrust, Steve seemed to get impossibly deeper, reaching parts that Tony had never managed to reach by himself. As Steve starting hitting against his prostate, Tony could only wonder why he and Steve hadn’t done this earlier, why he waited so many years to ask Steve to fuck him.
Tony looked at him, eyebrow raised. What did he think this was, a business meeting? “Look, do you want to fuck or not?” He didn’t intend to be so direct, but just standing near Steve was making his blood rush south.
They went on to discuss Thor and Bruce’s relationship, and Tony was more than grateful that the attention was no longer on him. He sipped his drink and laughed with his friends, all the while feeling those blue eyes constantly on him.
This image is immediately and permanently burned into Steve’s memory.
“We’ve known each other for almost six hundred years, Tony,” Steve said, taking a seat next to him. “Of course I do.”
Tony heard a sharp hiss from Steve, but he didn’t care. Whoever said werewolf blood tasted disgusting clearly must have never tried it before because Tony was euphoric. Maybe it was because he hadn't had a drink in a couple days, or maybe it was because it was Steve's blood, but Tony loved it. It tasted heady, rich, and slightly sweet; it tasted like Steve.
It was Tony’s turn to treat the team, so after getting all their orders, he headed over to the bar. As he waited, he could feel someone walk up next to him and when he looked up, the blue eyes that were staring at him from across the room where now right in front of him.
Steve’s smile was small but bright. “Yes.”
Steve steps out the bathroom, grateful for the long shower after what can only be described as the worst day ever. The meeting went nowhere, with nobody having any clue where to even begin or if the others can even be brought back again. Before that, he fought hundreds of aliens and even Thanos himself. Right now, he just wants to sleep.
Tony’s heart ached at the sound of Steve’s voice. He knew what Steve was talking about, but he couldn’t leave him to suffer through this alone.
Slowly but surely, Tony came back down, blinking up at Steve, who was bracing himself on his arms, hair stuck to his forehead with sweat. Tony shifted slightly, only for Steve to start coming again. A moan escaped Tony as Steve’s cock, still rock hard and deep inside him, filled him up and marked with more cum, leaving him feeling debauched but satisfied.
There has always been something between the two of them, something that’s been there from the very beginning, when Tony had just flown a bomb into space and fell to the ground, when Steve ripped the Iron Man mask off in fear, only to smile in relief when he heard Tony’s voice. There has always been something, but with everything that had been going on in their lives, they never had the time to act on it. More than that, Steve supposes, both of them were too scared, with neither ever having the courage to go forward. Mix that with all the disagreements and the disaster that was the Accords, Steve had virtually given up on anything every happening. And when Tony died, Steve felt nothing but loss and regret at the things that could have been, at the life that he could have had if he actually did something.
Tony doesn’t know what’s going to happen from this point on, or how he’s going to get the others back. One thing he does know, is that he’s not alone.
He can’t say, “I love you.”
Bruce laughed at how oblivious his friend was. “Everybody else knew it was him the second we saw the flowers. Only he would be that big of sap to do something like this.”
Steve.
Beside him, he could hear the angel sigh, before saying, “One hundred and forty years.” Tony looked up at that, and Steve continued. “That’s how long I’ve waited to meet you. I know that’s nothing compared to our lives, or how long I’ve known you, but it’s long enough for me to know that what I feel is real. And now that you’re here, and you can finally see me after all this time, I know what it’s like being with you and... I don’t want to let this go.”
It’s just a kiss, nothing more, nothing less, but when Tony pulls away, he feels as though there’s a weight on his chest. “I…” he starts, but he finds that he can’t complete the sentence.
And now… Steve was here, telling him everything he had known but never admitted. And Tony knew he would be lying to himself if his time with Steve so far, however short a time it might be, hasn’t been nothing short of the best he’s ever had. Steve knew all his sensitive spots, the places that made him moan, places where no one had ever paid that much attention to.
Tony didn’t always feel that way. Boredom started about a three hundred years into their friendship, and loneliness only appeared less than a century ago, but now that such feelings existed, he couldn’t stop them. As a vampire, Tony wanted to hate Steve for introducing such emotions into his head, but how could he when Steve also brought so much joy into his life?
He feels tears roll down his cheeks. He holds him even tighter.
Tony pulled Steve closer. “You are my alpha, and I will not let anyone say anything bad about you. That includes yourself.”
Tony’s knees buckled as he looked into Steve’s eyes, the bright blue now dark with lust and desire. To keep himself from falling, he lunged forward, lips meeting Steve’s once more. This time, Steve’s hands went to Tony’s ass, lifting him up until his legs were wrapped around his waist.
Cupping Steve’s face in his hands, Tony forced him to make eye contact. “There’s… something here, between us. It’s been there for a long time. I can’t put it into words, but it exists. And by denying it, you’re putting yourself in pain, and when you’re hurting, I’m hurting too.”
Tony glanced past Rhodey to see the members of the fire department on the far side of the bar, making a huge ruckus. Not that they hated each other; the police department and fire department have had a friendly rivalry since forever, especially with their stations being right next to each other. The pub was frequented by both teams, with each often trying to claim it as their own territory. Still, everybody from one side knew everybody else from the other, and they were all close enough to consider themselves friends.
Tony cupped the side of Steve’s face, to which the blond reached up to hold it in his own hand, turning to kiss Tony’s palm. Turning back, he smiled and said, “I’ve missed you.”
Almost immediately, a glint of lust flashed over Steve’s blue eyes, and Tony could sense his reply before he said it, his mate’s hands lowering to squeeze his ass. “You.”
At the word ‘my’, Steve’s mood changed immediately, now looking up at Tony, eyes bright and hopeful.
A second later, Tony realised how sappy he sounded. If anyone asked, he would have blamed it on the angel’s presence and his heavenly aura, but in reality, that was what he truly thought (although not in such a cheesy manner). And now that he had that thought in his head, it wouldn’t go away either. With that, his mind was made up.
Tony took a deep breath before speaking again, voice wavering. “Why?”
With Steve's cock in him, combined with his cum, Tony felt blissfully full. But it wasn't enough. He needed more. Thankfully, Steve started moving, his thrusts slow and deep, the urgency from earlier gone, replaced with a desire to milk the experience for all it was worth. With every thrust came a squelching sound, one that only sounded louder with Tony's enhanced hearing, a sound that should have been off-putting but only acted as a reminder of how Steve had marked him from the inside as well.
“What if,” Tony tried again. “I wanted this too?”
Steve chuckled, his warmth breath ghosting over the back of Tony’s neck. “You’re not prepared yet. I want to make sure you can take me.”
“No, it wasn’t, but I’m just happy that I had someone looking out for me when I was hurt,” Steve said. “Wouldn’t you want that too?”
Before long, Tony was on the edge, the coil in his stomach tightening every time Steve pushed into him. He was so close, his tail writhing below him in desperation and anticipation of release. Steve could sense it, and leaned back down, whispering low and rough into Tony’s ear. “Come for me.”
A swell of emotions run through Steve, bringing back memories of when they were still together. A better time before they fought, before Thanos. A happier time.
Tony could only smile at how careful he was being. “We’ve known each other for centuries. We act like mates already. This would just make it official.”
He shifts himself into a sitting position. Tony does the same, and looking away, says, “I’m sorry.”
Tony raised his hand, calling for another glass. Natasha, the bartender and owner of the bar, slid over another whisky almost immediately with an eyebrow raised. “Bad day?”
Just then, he heard the rustling again, now sure that it was coming from the bedroom.
It’s not what Tony expected, and he’s surprised by how sure Steve sounds. “How do you know?”
“Rogers.” Tony could only hide behind a smirk, trying to flirt his way out of the awkwardness. “What are you doing here? Want to buy me a drink?”
As handsome as Thor was, Tony had always felt more attracted to Steve and this was a perfect example why. He had a broad chest and shoulders, which tapered down into a much smaller waist, making him look like what was essentially a triangle. His huge biceps flexed as he waved a small little wave to the crowd. Leading into his jeans were those stupid pelvic muscles, the “v” that Tony had no idea how to achieve. And even though his legs were covered, all the jeans did was to accentuate his ass and his thighs. After all the years of only seeing it in pictures, actually seeing this image of Steve in real life was almost too much for Tony.
