“Sure I do, until Mr. Kinky Cow Eyes bats his lashes and you forget my number.”
Tony tilted his head to the side in thought, then peered at Steve curiously. “Listen to them talk about it, or talk to them about it?”
“Because Colin, you’re quite into the fitness, I heard you’re quite mad on yoga,” Graham pointed out, addressing his statement to Colin Farrell on Tony’s left side. “Have you tried pilates?”
“Ta mee breearrey shen,” replied Torin, swearing to honor Brigid’s chief priest as was asked of him. With his promise, the Mayor offered his hand to Ean. “Irree.”
“There is no cause for concern, Steve Rogers. Bones heal, but lives can never be returned. You are my ward and I stand beside you in this cornucopia of fisting.”
Tony’s lips curved up with a smile, a private little thing that caught Steve’s attention easier than sunshine on a cloudy day. He could feel his neck warming with a blush; even if it was at his expense, Steve couldn’t help but feel a tug of primal excitement thinking that Tony was smiling about
“No,” she whispered as her eyes grew wide in dismay, and she and Clint both stared at her as a golden light shone from within her chest like a bright, white star until it consumed her entirely.
But as he passed Professor Hawley as he made his way to the young redhead, the professor held out a hand to stop him.
Even with all his years of experience, this was the first time in a long time that Steve wasn’t sure how to contain himself. The world didn’t need to see everything, did they? Did they want to know that he was still reeling from the staggering excitement and shock, or how his heart felt so full with love and joy that it threatened to burst out of his chest?
Steve rumbled deep in his throat in reply, turning where he lay until his cheek was pillowed on Tony’s thigh, and he had an arm curled over Tony’s leg to hold him close. His open palm rested against Tony’s inner thigh with a light touch.
“Happy is en route to your location,” Jarvis replied almost immediately, its volume appropriately modulated to library whispering. “ETA 36 minutes due to unexpected traffic.”
Tony must have noticed that Steve wasn’t enjoying the absurdity as much as he was, because he cleared his throat and wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes. “Looks like we’ve got a second chance, babe,” he said, his voice a little hoarse after all that laughter. “You sure you want to marry me?”
It was the witch from Stromwell’s class! Steve didn’t know whether he should be sick or livid, and as Sharon held out her hand to him, there was nothing but contempt in her eyes.
When he turned to leave, Tony found he didn’t really want to. He didn’t want to be that far from Steve. In the end, the decision wasn’t difficult to make: Tony undressed quietly and crawled in under the covers. Steve’s voice floated through his consciousness, and Tony closed his eyes to relax as he listened to the sound of his voice.
But then he heard it again, broken and rasped over a voice hoarse from decades of disuse.
He glanced at Tony, but the visceral sympathy and heartache on Tony’s face only made Steve more uncomfortable. A part of him wanted to shout at him that he wasn’t that weird—he was just a foster kid. There were over four-hundred thousand of those in United States alone, and that was by conservative estimates. He wasn’t some freak to pity.
“Sex and the City,” Bucky said just to be contrary.
“Tony,” Steve raised his voice a little, trying to be heard over Tony’s spiraling self-doubt. “Tony, hey. Do you want to come over tonight?”
“Yeah, sure. You need any wrapping paper?” Steve agreed easily, and when Bucky nodded, he walked out to his little laundry room where he kept all the odds and ends that were important but didn’t belong anywhere else. He brought out a handful of colorful rolls and bows, scissors and tape, and helped Bucky set up in the living room.
“What about his duty to all of Rumlow’s victims? Isn’t it his fucking duty to help us capture him?”
Tony should have laughed and let it slide… except, in his half-asleep state there was a chance Steve wouldn’t remember this conversation by morning. It wasn’t that they were bad at communication—part of the excitement early on had been talking each other through what they wanted, what turned them on, but at least that Tony had experience with in the past. This was different. Never had Tony been allowed into a situation without practice and full information before. This was the first time he was flying blind, and without a chance to practice. These were embarrassing questions and insecurities that Tony wasn’t proud of, but by chance, he’d caught Steve about to fall asleep. With a little luck, Tony could ask his questions without his fiancé being any wiser to these irrational thoughts he couldn’t shake.
Bucky glanced at Tony, and then at Steve, who was definitely
“Once this is over, I will come for your life,” she whispered to him in a promise. Icy chills ran through Tony’s veins; it was the happiest he’d ever heard 006 sound. “Not you, you understand, but everything that gives your life meaning. Your family, your friends. Your lover will watch you burn.”
A small smile tugged at the corner of Steve’s lips when his mom mentioned his dad. He could almost imagine the kitchen the way it looked when he was a child, when his mom would be on the phone with her friends for hours, and his dad would sit next to her at the kitchen table reading the paper, looking for all the world like he hadn’t heard a peep until he chimed in to fill in a forgotten name or detail in Sarah’s stories.
Seconds turned to minutes, and eventually, Tony must have lost his limited patience. “Steve? Say something, please,” he whispered, leaning after him. Steve could feel the warmth of his hand hovering just over his shoulder, and it was almost as infuriating as if he had been touched.
“Did you make a decision yet, did you sign on?” Tony wondered as he took a sip of his drink. Steve had used that particular strategy of hiding his excitement many times before, and he had to smile to see Tony mirroring it back at him in a time like this.
“I think you should just go call him, Stevie,” Bucky cut in before either Sarah or Jenna continued that line of thought, and Steve couldn’t agree more. Anything to get out of the conversation.
“No, I’m alright, detective. I’m okay,” he promised in a hurry, not that Steve bought it. “I’ll, I just need to go home, I think. I’ll be fine.”
Like most of Chris’s questions, it left Steve and Tony quiet for some time as they mulled over their answers. This time, Steve was the first to respond.
Tony blinked at him at first, but soon whatever energy and hope he’d carried with him seeped away. He couldn’t meet Steve’s eyes anymore, and so he looked anywhere but directly at him, finally just frowning at the floor.
have a crush on Sam Heughan.”
Hey Steve, an asshole just got out of his trailer. He’s a big fan of Cap, can we call and say hi? Ok time?
Steve found himself unexpectedly pleased to have a comfortable rider behind him, and at the first red light, he couldn’t resist turning his head just enough to ask, “How you doing?”
“You’ve read passionate haikus about my testicles, detective. Call me Tony,” Tony observed with a wry grin. He shuffled a few of his piles - most letters were harmless, a few qualified as
“Mama always said it’s empowering that relationships can be based on love for us. You’re not stuck with someone because you’re dependent on your partner for money. She always said to love the person who loves you best, and who brings out the best in you,” Jenna said, mostly directing her words at Sarah. Or so Steve thought. He had just dared to breathe a sigh of relief when Jenna turned to him and said, “but she also says, it’s a hell of a lot easier to love people with money.”
“Oh, no, you don’t,” Steve growled from Tony’s left, and before Tony could even try to kiss the woman on his right, Steve reeled him in by the collar of his new jersey and claimed his lips in a needful, passionate kiss.
The summer solstice festival marked the beginning of the annual weeklong holiday. All around the kingdom people could lay happy in their beds, lazy and content, sleeping in after a day of games and incredible indulgences.
“Yes and no,” Steve admitted, and he swore he heard the moment Tony’s playful mood calmed into careful attention at the other end of the line. “What’s going on?”
For Consone’s fifth solstice festival and ahead of their fourth anniversary, Tony opened the day with a short expression of gratitude for the diverse advancements and victories both big and small across the kingdom in the past year. His address was their only official obligation of the day, and soon afterward they were both released to enjoy the food, festivities, and games along with everyone else at Eisenturm.
How he’d lost sight of reality, he wasn’t sure, but any way you looked at it, Steve was anything but alone. If anything was worth the work, it was love, but he’d be a fool to think his life wasn’t full of love without Brock in it.
- but his brain had disconnected from all speech long ago. Tony guided him onto his side, and Steve obediently did as he was told. He felt Tony brush a kiss over his shoulder and another over the back of his neck before he felt Tony’s long, lean body sliding up behind his, curving around him in a protective embrace. Tony settled so they shared the same pillow, and he pressed a final kiss over the back of Steve’s head before nuzzling into his hair. Together they drifted off to blissful sleep.
“I don’t care if I have to stand on a balcony to drop an anvil over his head, Wile E Coyote style,” Bucky promised, “that asshole hurt my best friend. What has Steve
This time, Tony’s smile was unmistakable. Steve felt tension bleed from his posture as he indulged in Tony’s happiness even from a distance.
Until Tony cut him off in his afternoon run…
?” Steve gasped, “The reactor was destroyed!”
“You’re his
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he asked, “You sure?”
He had struggled with Bucky’s fall from the train before and after traveling back to the future. He couldn’t save Bucky in the past because of the threat to the future…but he could save him now.
All of his weight fell onto Wade as he gasped shallowly for breath and Wade tightly clutched his arms. Wade exclaimed, “PETER?!”
Gone was the sad Steve and hopefully he was gone for good.
Was Stark waiting for him to make the next move?
Wade pressed his forehead to Peter’s and glared at his boyfriend as he grumbled, “That was the only time you’d bottomed…”
Steve’s blue eyes were wide with shock as he stared at Tony and he inhaled with a strangled effort but the air seemed incapable of entering his smoking chest.
you are going to die a slow, fiery death, broadcasted across every screen in the great U.S. of A!”
Wade gripped Peter by the hips and pressed their waists together. Peter was reminded that it was a man who he held as he felt Wade’s hard sex pressed into his and, dear lord, he didn’t wear a jockstrap like most supes with a form fitting uniform so Peter felt every inch of him.
Once again, thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed the series as much as I enjoyed creating it!
“Maybe she’s just considering her choices,” Steve guessed.
“Soooo, if you guys go on vacation and my birth certificate technically-.”
He blanched as soon as the words left his mouth. He all but confessed that he had thought what they shared was real.
“You holding onto my front should be the easiest,” Tony replied.
It was around this time that Peter and Wade made their entrance.
Wade pressed his face into Peter’s hair and inhaled the man’s soft scent.
Steve stiffly nodded and sat down on one of the cots, the only other available seating other than the chair Cable was sitting on at the desk.
He truthfully replied, “I’d love to go…”
Tony’s hands shot into the air as a sign of defeat and he yelled, “Rubber bullets! I would have never killed him!
“…I’m multitasking,” Tony retorted the obvious, nodding to his suit and Barnes.
bonded! How do we separate them??
“Come back with a hearty appetite,” Tony said with a cocky grin and Steve felt himself flush again. Yet his flush was no longer from embarrassment but exhilaration. He wanted to keep touching Tony and feel his lips on his own again. His earlier misgivings and embarrassments seemed silly now.
The black mass trembled but seemed to believe him. It shrunk again, this time returning to its shirt form. He caught Wade as he collapsed onto Peter. Again, Peter held him tightly and tears blurred his vision.
“And the Winter Soldier?”
Waist deep in the water, Tony’s joints were beginning to ache, even the flesh around his arc reactor was throbbing. He rubbed the skin around the reactor to try and dispel the feeling but received no such result.
Steve’s intense gaze raked down his body and focused on where his hips were obscured beneath the water.
Tony pressed his face into Steve’s chest and his fiancé held him tightly until they landed.
Steve relaxed at Tony’s words. He wasn’t hurt. Everything was going to be okay.
Steve watched him go with a forlorn expression.
“Ignore it solider,” his master commanded. “We gave you a fake implant to better disguise you. A zeroed out implant stands out too much.”
Tony paused halfway up the stairs and pulled Steve close as he murmured, “If you slept elsewhere I’d be fairly heartbroken.”
The Soldier felt his entire body shiver as if it was plunged into cold water. But, what really stood out to him was the way his heart seemed to stop beating upon hearing the name. It clenched tightly in his chest and stole his breath.
It began to expand and surround Peter.
dinner so we can get to know our son’s boyfriend.” Tony looked up to his husband and Steve deadpanned, “And that’s final, Tony. I know you aren’t happy about Peter’s choice but you need to accept it or you might hurt Peter in the process and I know that’s the last thing you want.”
Was the past going to repeat itself?
He was alone in a hospital room. Was Tony at the hospital too? Was he in another room, healing from his injuries, or did he-did he die?
Peter picked himself up and met Wade’s eyes. The merc was smiling at him, his eyes sparkling again, and Peter replied cryptically, “Maybe…we’ll see how the night goes.”
“I want to be here for you, Tones,” Bruce murmured.
She wiped away those tears and beamed at the both of them with a happy smile. She gasped, “Tony…you found your soulmate.”
“Projections may be off due to my limited information on Vision’s throwing capacity and how its inertia would be affected in the vacuum of space,” Friday stated.
“You’re approaching him now, Sir.”
He had to force himself to breathe and consciously remind himself how it worked.
New chapter! It would have been up yesterday but my internet went out! :(
A span of silence stretched between them, in which, Blondie and Twitchy just stared at him.
Steve was stuck in a loop with no way to escape.
“Is Jarvis piloting the suit?” Steve asked, gritting his teeth as he pushed himself up.
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s hair and inhaled his scent deeply. Steve closed his eyes and whispered, “I can get used to this too…”
“Tony Stark,” Steve said. He told the father about the time traveling but didn’t bring up their relationship. He knew Tony said it was acceptable in this era, but Steve still wasn’t used to sharing the information, especially with strangers. He asked, “When I mentioned him, you knew exactly who I was talking about. Is he famous in this era?”
Tony flew them back to his lab and as soon as they were in the building, Tony jumped from his suit and threw himself back into the arms his newly dubbed fiancé.
“Your big, smart brain is the reason,” Steve countered, grasping Tony’s hand and walking him toward the house.
And how
He loved Tony so much it hurt.
Clint shot to his feet and frantically gasped, “We have to go!
What was it about this woman who made him defy the impossible?
He was so pale and Wade pressed down on Peter’s wounds in an attempt to stop the blood. He turned to Wanda, about to yell at her to use her damn magic already when he saw…
“I know,” Steve whispered. He hugged Tony and buried his face into the armor of his neck. He repeated, “I know…”
Tony grinned and agreed, “I am a
Peter shook his head and murmured, “No, don’t bother him or Steve…I don’t want them worrying about me…”
Steve’s throat tightened and he grasped it, remembering his own drowning: the cold freezing his limbs, the salty water burning his throat and choking him with its soft caress. It was a torturous experience and horribly slow.
Wade nodded furiously to Peter and then they both separated as they tore off their individual shirts. Wade was then blessed with the incredible view of Peter's naked torso for the first time. The Spider-man costume was very form fitting so it had never left much room for the imagination but he'd never actually seen and Peter’s body was even better than he had imagined.
Steve snorted and replied, “
One of them placed a laptop on his desk and turned it toward him. Two excitedly gasped at the same time, “It’s him!”
,” Tony said, leaning into his husband’s hold. “He’s not like Peter…He’s a mercenary. He’s either going to hurt Peter or going to turn him.”
Hours later, Steve finally followed him down and he announced his presence by stating, "He's heading back to Queens."
To Steve, just yesterday, his future looked bleak. His best friend had just died and his implant was zeroed out. He thought he was going to be alone. But since he woke not only had the War ended but he now had a soulmate.
...and Bucky had to take this mission.
“So soon?” Steve gasped. He had expected to have to wait for the American team’s expedition to end. His eyes were drawn back to the docks and he looked at one particular ship that had to be bigger than the Empire State building. He marveled at its size. How did they keep such a ginormous thing from sinking??
Steve’s jaw dropped as he looked to the rings and Tony’s nervous expression. Everything made so much sense now that he felt ridiculous for not seeing it sooner. Steve’s hands rose to the level of Tony’s face then cupped his cheeks. Tony had enough time to blink before Steve pulled him into a mouth crushing kiss so hard that the older man fell over. Steve went tumbling down with him and continued to ravish his mouth with kisses when Tony was flat on his back on the tile floor.
Steve inhaled sharply and Tony probably wouldn’t have heard it if he were not so close to him. Steve slowly whispered at a lower volume, “I…I care for you too, Tony…” Steve enfolded him into his embrace and murmured, “I wish I could have been the one to travel to your time…then this would have been so much simpler…”
“Tony is in pain and is throwing himself at the Mandarin so he can escape it through anger,” Steve hissed. “He is not thinking about the risk. He’s a danger to himself right now!”
Tony punched him in the shoulder. Steve looked back to him with a frown and Tony grinned, raising his boxing gloves higher and dancing on the tips of his toes.
“Well…Bucky…we…I mean…” Steve stammered looking for the right words.
Tony sat on the guest couch and Steve sat close next to him. He would only need to shift slightly to lean into him but he held back…for now. An excited thrill ran through him and he and Tony exchanged wide grins.
Steve pouted and Tony forced a frown, when he clearly wanted to pout too. Yet as Tony looked at him he suddenly smirk and said, “I’m making you dirty too.” He licked a thumb and rubbed something off the side of Steve’s mouth. Steve looked down at himself and saw Tony left behind a trail of dirty grime wherever he touched him.
His scalp was tight and hurt all the more as his brows pinched together, pulling the skin.
Steve was surprised by the obvious admiration in Peter’s voice and, for a second, he felt it…what it meant to be a father – to have someone look up to him not because of him being a superhero but…because of their relation…because they were family.
Howard sat before him with a sigh and smiled at him. Tony hesitated to think it but…he looked almost proud?...Of Tony?
What he did not expect was to see an end to the footprints.
“What's upsetting you then?”
“No.”
Steve winced and said, “I know…”
Steve flushed and said, “Jumping right into bed doesn’t sound like a good beginning to a ‘stable relationship’…”
Tony chuckled, “No one ever said Tony Stark was the epitome of safety standards.”
“Tony,” Steve disbelievingly whispered his husband’s name under his breath. What was he doing here??
Longing thrummed through his body at the thought. If they still remained friends, maybe he could do casual? They’d still have a close relationship as friends. Maybe that would be enough?
Steve raised his hand for everyone to silently stop. Natasha came close to his back and he heard the light click of her safety being clicked off.
“Kiss me right there,” Tony murmured, his lips already kissing the top of Steve’s head. Steve could just barely feel his lips through his course hair but he could still make out their caress and light nibbling. It made Steve dizzy to know that Tony was doing that to Steve.
As soon as the village was in good hands and Tony’s heart felt full by seeing them all pull together, he went straight home. Unfortunately, CENTCOM at Edwards Air Force Base detected his flight so instead of returning home in time for Enigma’s usual morning run by, he had to evade some jets and then save one of the pilots.
Tony smiled warmly at his son and murmured, “I’m happy for you two, Peter. Wade clearly cares for you…sorry for being such a jerk about it in the beginning…”
“Anytime,” Bucky promised.
"You told him?" Bucky asked Steve.
Coulson sighed heavily and then redirected the question as he asked, “What did you want to talk about? What’s wrong?”
He flushed to himself as he imagined physically doing what he had done with Gwen…but with Wade instead. It was weird. He wasn’t going to lie. Would he let Wade kiss him tonight? He wondered what his lips would feel like. Would it feel rough because of the scars?
“You texted me, saying you needed to change the date to hook up the reactor to the city grid. How long of a delay are we going to have?”
,” Tony said in warning.
The week went by quickly as Steve was immersed in studies on how to adapt to the new century. Unsurprisingly, his studies focused on America’s military history and the new technological advancements.
Venom attacked Hulk again, drawing the green man into another fight. Iron Man, however, blast off the ground at a death defying speed and flew straight to him.
Tony heard the click of cameras behind them and he whispered, “The paparazzi need a show, my beloved boyfriend. How shall we let them capture us together now? A quick embrace? A gentle kiss? Or a slobbery French kiss that will make you quake in your socks?”
Steve looked tired and he replied, “As I’ll ever be.”
Steve hands twitched toward him want to hold him and apologize. He stopped himself but felt torn between who he wanted to be and…what he assumed wanted.
“…What…What is my mission then?”
“I have a feeling today might be our last time going to the courthouse,” Tony stated with a grin.
One by one, he went up to each group, thanking them and saying goodnight. Some of the last he saw were his parents. Both men hugged him and his dad held him in an especially long embrace. Peter returned it with just as much feeling his dad put into it. Usually, he would be embarrassed by his dad’s over-emotional reaction but today was different. Just two days ago, he’d wondered if he’d make it to his birthday.
Maybe this won’t be so bad…he was going to lose a lot of friends…but the few who were going to stand by him…those were the ones he’d want by his side in the end.
Hello! Sorry for the delay but as soon as I wrote this chapter out I decided I wanted to change the ending and had to rewrite it! Plus, I am in the process of moving so I have been busy with that process! BUT here it is! The final chapter! Yay!
“Harry wouldn’t lie,” Peter stated then stubbornly looked back down at his lap.
Her fingers dug into his shoulders and she gasped, “Really?”
“But we should discuss this first,” Tony stated. He turned to Pepper and said, “Pep, you’re great at discussing things. We should all discuss this.”
Tony scooped up a handful from the basket and threw it in the stove. The fire inside flared and promised to keep burning for a few more hours. Tony’s side of the bed was closest to the stove and should keep him warm throughout the night.
Coulson hung up with a scowl. Stark had to create this nightmare right as his alpha team moved into the city to search for Cap. He rubbed his forehead and the thought pacified him slightly. They’ll find Cap soon.
Kilian fell back from Tony with a scream and Steve ran back to his side.
mission on the directive. What if he really was not interested in the fact that they were soulmates? What if this was only a mission?
“B-But the future?” Steve argued half-heartedly.
“Hi, yes, thank you, Mr. Rogers – Captain, sir!” Wade garbled so quickly that neither man probably understood him.
“Hopefully, I can convince him otherwise,” Coulson whispered and walked past the doctor and opened the door to the interrogation room.
Steve wrapped his right arm around his face to attempt to protect it, his left arm hung uselessly at his side thanks to his shoulder's dislocation, but he could feel his skin blister and melt despite his actions. His uniform was made to combat intense heat but he could feel the fire eat away at it. He had to move now. If he did not move he was going to die.
Natasha rolled her eyes. Her soulmate was certainly a man of little words. She asked, “What’s your name?”
Steve cleared his throat and chuckled, “It’s a long –
we cannot operate without energy and I doubt any of us are sleeping tonight so food it is! I was thinking ahead because you clearly were too busy sitting around on the couch to do it!”
Minutes prior, Marcel had pulled him aside and told him the mountains of favor towards Steve’s defense was a very good sign. He did not want to make any promises but he heavily alluded to their winning the trial.
With various knots, he had turned the old jumpsuit into a bag he could kept slung across his back and tied to him with a square-knot across his chest.
In the commotion, Steve’s eyes were instantly drawn to Bruce. Even though he did not sit in the courtroom, the doctor still came to the courthouse as a sign of support as he had been doing throughout the trial. He must have followed the others when the civilians started to scream.
“I’m sorry I didn’t go after you,” Steve whispered suddenly. James glanced up at Steve but his friend was looking down at his lap. The smile Steve had been wearing when he first saw him was gone and his mouth was a hard, solid line.
Steve thought of Peter having to watch as Venom ate Steve and attack the rest of their family and whispered, “I hope not.”
“Well you are a very lucky man to be alive,” the man replied gravely. “You were on the brink of death when they brought you in here and…and you healed miraculously fast. I am the camp doctor by the way, I am Sergey, Sergey Pavlov.”
Hey! Sorry for the late posting! BUT it's still August 9th in my timezone soooo yay! :D
Tony turned back to Bucky and said, “My home is your home. You’re going to live here from now on. I’m going to make you a new arm and then you are going to live your life how you want to.”
Steve smiled at him with glistening eyes and immediately went to his side and pressed a gentle kiss to his temple. Tony automatically leaned into him and Steve tucked his face into his neck and draped his arm around him. Tony sighed contently and felt his body relax. He’d been on edge ever since escaping the void.
Tony did not notice but Bruce had slipped out to give them some privacy as they lamented together. The only reason they stopped was because Peter’s body could not take it anymore and he fainted.
“Level 20.”
Tony changed after his parents’ deaths.
?!” Steve hissed.
Friday was silent whereas Jarvis would have been berating him on his actions. He missed J. Vision may have retained his voice, intelligence, and memory components but…they were not the same. Friday was a good AI but she wasn’t his Jarvis who was programed with the same sass the real Jarvis had, had…After years of noise from the team and his family, the current silence was surreal…
him go down!” The Captain hissed his disbelief and buried his face in his hands. He painfully asked, “I screamed his name and he did not move.”
With the bandages back in place, Tony's reactor's light was hidden and they were free to move. Steve carried Tony to the medical tent and Gabe informed the other medics that Tony had an injury to his chest that Gabe was personally monitoring. Both Gabe and Bucky left them alone as Steve helped Tony settle into the cot and tucked him in.
…” Steve murmured in warning but Bucky kept going.
Their silver rings shined brilliantly in the light and made his grin all the wider.
Rogers’ amazement grew and his eyes widened almost comically.
They both leaned into each other’s sides as Cable approached. Cable had a metal arm like Bucky but also one of his eyes were glowing red and Steve could see more robotic flesh on his neck. He wondered if Hydra had a hand in that just like they did with Bucky, but he knew he couldn’t ask because of ramifications to the future.
Steve wound both of his arms around Tony and Tony leaned back into him. They both wordlessly watched as everyone realized the Goblin was gone…until he wasn’t.
They tip-toed back to their room and, as soon as the door was closed behind them, they both sighed heavily and collapsed into each other.
“They’re not like people, they don’t really have boyfriends and girlfriends,” he said to start, pacing himself so there’d be plenty to say the whole walk to the lion enclosure. “It’s more about being safe and healthy. The male lions protect the territory, and the females hunt.”
“People grow and change. That is life. But marriage is not about who is perfectly right, or who appeals to a list of preferences, it is about who brings out the best in you,” Tony said gently, all the while knowing Rhodey would be infinitely better with such a conversation. “There were many differences between myself and his Majesty, my husband, and I am grateful for all the ways he has changed my life. He challenges me every day, not with arguments or demands, but by simply being himself. His presence in my life has changed me, I could not be the man I was again. The changes are small at first, you understand; what suit or tie I will wear, or when we eat, for example. Over time, these changes grow, and for that, he has made my life richer and more beautiful than I ever imagined.”
“Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” Chief Fury rumbled in a tired, displeased tone. The chatter around the room quieted into a startled silence as the confrontation grew louder. “I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments to Lieutenant Robert B. Banner. Your fascination with the boorish disorder of the 21st exhausts my patience. You are setting a subpar example for sworn officers and personnel. Do you truly long so fondly for chaos and disharmony? I promoted a silver class officer to lieutenant, and this is how you repay my trust?”
“Tell me about your day,” Steve whispered. They were stretched out on Tony’s deep set couch, Steve lying on his back while Tony enjoyed his cushioned position on top. “Are you doing more book signings?”
“We will get there,” Dr. Odinson assured him, “but let us first develop a foundation. We will begin with you, Tony. Tell us about your family.”
Steve set his jaw, and quietly counted backwards from thirty before he started shouting at his date.
“May she rest peacefully,” Steve eventually murmured into Tony’s hair, following it with a kiss. Tony stirred in his arms and glanced up at Steve looking dazed and a little lost. Steve smiled back at him fondly, then pressed up to kiss Tony’s forehead softly, a lingering, unhurried kiss that left Tony pliant and warm and nearly smiling again.
uhhhhhh about time? It’s almost been two years. They should’ve gotten divorced and cheated on their respective SOs with each other by now.
There, on his bedside table, his phone vibrated with an incoming call. Tony pushed himself up and crawled closer to stare at the screen in his disbelief.
Tony blinked back at him, momentarily confused. It took him a few seconds to remember who held him upright, and that his feet weren’t in fact touching the floor.
“A lot of people go for this look,” Steve was saying in his defense all the while, then tugged his arm free to re-settle the leather jacket. “It’s polished, it’s fashionable, it could pay my rent for a month—”
“Steve? You awake?” he murmured hesitantly against Steve’s chest later that night. Steve stirred against him and stretched as he settled, but he vaguely mumbled something in the affirmative.
“I have nothing to report,” Thor began to say, fussing with the sleeve of his jumper with an embarrassed frown.
A flicker of movement on his camera feed gave Steve pause. He couldn’t be sure yet if it was a shadow or the movement he’d been waiting for, but either way, he turned in the direction of the old town square.
In perfect contrast to himself, Tony was beaming with excitement.
“No,” the guy answered after checking his list. “Maybe try the Lido deck.”
“Don’t make me call James, Tony,” she hissed at him under her breath, already levelling a long-suffering look at him that made it clear she meant it.
“Who could blame her?” Steve said quietly, not really comfortable enough chatting with the people next to him. But Maria looked at him with a questioning arch in her brow, so he elaborated. “A childhood friend of mine had an alcoholic dad. It was a living nightmare.”
“We will by the end of the day.”
Tony didn’t know whether to laugh or crawl under the bar and hide. “Typical? I just pretended to be seeing a complete stranger in a bar to avoid telling my friend how pathetic my dating life has been the last six months, and
“Hey,” he heard a gentle voice say. “Are you okay?”
“I’ll get into his computer, you try to find his safe.”
“Am I going to need a lawyer present, too?” Steve half-joked, but Tony, who always had a ready grin or a quiet giggle for Steve’s brand of sarcasm, could barely maintain eye-contact. His gaze skittered between the file in his hand and Steve, and given his blatant attempt to appear calm, Steve shut up and did as he was asked.
Steve stared at them, stunned.
“You are Tony Stark,” Rhodey reminded him, speaking slowly in his effort to follow Tony’s argument. “And you want me to help you get into a Doubletree hotel—”
It didn’t take long to get to the pier, and they walked out onto the dimly lit pier overlooking the coast. The ocean was dark around them, stretched to the horizon and beyond.
“For the record, you suck.”
The black flesh rippled again and Peter felt it tighten around him and restrict his body’s movements. Venom filled his mind and took back control.
Peter opened it and pulled out the round object. He stared at it blankly then asked, “What is it?”
Steve was not a flint or gay or whatever that other term Pepper used.
The witness nodded with a flush and Marcel glared at him for a few more seconds before stating, “What I find so odd about this dress is the fact that the stain is located on it.”
Tony was dead.
“Wade, I want to keep kissing,” Peter stated with an annoyed edge and narrowed gaze.
Steve stared at Tony’s outstretched hand with extreme trepidation. He could not tell Tony his name because then he’d notice the connection between his name and face, and no amount of beard or sunglasses was going to keep Tony from realizing who he was.
“He’s not the only miracle,” Agent Hill announced. “Come in, we have a lot to discuss.”
“Wakey-wakey Stevie, the Commandos want to go ov –.”
Tony had read the files so he knew what to expect but it still made his heart hurt to hear the confusion in the other man’s voice. He didn’t even remember his name. They completely erased him.
Tony’s heart nearly seized with the unearthly scream that woke him. He and Steve jolted and sat up sharply together.
“Mac was really the one?” Peter whispered with a small voice. He couldn’t help but note that Mac wasn’t there today but Peter still couldn’t believe he’d betray him like that. Mac was the oldest intern and was there on scholarship but he never thought he’d stoop to that…
Tony beefed up security around the Tower and the metal shudders on the floors they all lived in had not risen since the initial attack. Steve no longer took Peter outside on the balcony and his boy soon complained about wanting to go outside.
Steve was thrust into a dreamscape with no definition, just violent red and black colors clashing together and Tony screaming and struggling against an invisible opponent.
When he looked in the mirror, he felt like he was looking at a stranger and it wasn’t because of the beard or the longer hair…His eyes had no light and his expression was empty.
“When did the Man of Iron become a father?” Thor asked excitedly and Tony made a noise that sounded like a combination of a groan and an over exaggerated sigh.
Last chapter will be posted next Thursday!
“Jarvis, pull up all color photos of Steve,” Tony commanded.
“I’m waiting, Captain,” the Red Skull murmured, moving one of his feet forward for Steve to kiss.
He looked to Peter at that moment and seeing him smile made Wade’s insides feel all happy bubbly.
Peter’s heart wrenched seeing Wade so subdued under his mask again.
“Done,” Tony agreed with warmth blossoming in his chest. Before the press conference, he had to get Steve alone and make this relationship
Steve paused and stared blankly at the pen in his hand. Eventually, he carefully stated, “It’s something I do not want to talk about.”
“It’s movie night, I hope your reactor can handle the ‘epic laser battle’ we’re going to be watching in the next Star Wars episode,” Steve jokingly badgered as Tony finished off the pipe with one last concentrated blast from his repulsor.
Steve rolled his eyes and murmured, "I hope not...I did plenty of that during the War and don’t want to repeat that in this century."
The dreamscape moved upon Tony’s request and the ground beneath Steve shifted, pulling him away from Tony.
Steve jerked his face out of Tony’s touch, just enough so that no one else would see it, and hissed, “Don’t.”
Steve sighed heavily and leaned in closer to the hot spray.
“H-Harder,” Tony moaned into the pillow.
“We’re both alive and healing,” Tony replied. “…
Every touch elicited noises from Steve that would have embarrassed him had he been in his right mind.
“Okay,” he whispered to Tony. Steve looked to Peter, still on the wall, and said, “I’m going to leave my card here, call anytime.” He slid a business card out of his pocket and put it on the sofa.
Steve wildly nodded and Father Michael thoughtfully said, “Now that you mention it…Before the Hydra scandal, I remember reading something about him being in the hospital and Iron Man hasn’t been involved in any of the Hydra stuff so he may still be there…Let me google it – oh – ah – that means to look up the information on my phone, which connects me to the internet and, well, I don’t really understand the internet myself so I’m not sure how to describe it…”
Bucky stilled against him then lifted his head. Steve was shaking violently and even though his eyes were crushed shut, hot tears were beginning to fall down his face. Steve’s fingers dug into Bucky’s scalp and he gasped, “I’m sorry. Buck, I’m sorry. I can’t…Tony—Tony-. I know he’s gone but…” He blinked open his eyes, his lashes heavy with salty tears. He met Bucky’s shocked gaze and whispered, “I wanted you, Bucky but I-I did not know until he was gone but I
Bucky unwound his scarf and rolled his eyes to articulate
Steve’s expression changed from listening attentively, to confusion, to playful curiosity.
As the hosts, Thing 1 (Sharon) and Thing 2 (Sam) tended to float between friends and chat. Every time they popped back around, it was an automatic reset on the group conversation.
But Steve only laughed and crawled closer to kiss Tony quiet. “You’re amazing, that’s what you are,” Steve said with what Tony swore was a mischievous grin. Before Tony could explain that Steve must have misheard, that they were about to spend their first and only six month anniversary in his stale old dorm room, Steve said, “I knew this would be a busy time for you, so I made plans this time. Would you like to hear them?”
“And I don’t like it when you two gang up on me!” Clark called from the bathroom. Steve didn’t pass the message on before hanging up and following his dad to the bathroom.
“006. I must be dreaming.”
“Sleep well, my king. I love you.”
But someone else was going to hear the news first.
Tony could feel himself growing unexpectedly lightheaded and willed himself to look away. There was nothing like Sitwell’s bulbous face to remind him of what they were there to do.
“What I’m saying is that we can stay longer if you want to see the city,” Steve clarified with a long-suffering tone, “we don’t need to rush to Lucerne.”
- They arrive in Lisbon, and Tony falls in love at first sight. Until he meets Benedita, Steve’s romantic costar in this spy movie who is so beautiful and sweet and nice and lovely that it makes him see red.
“First of all, that’s
The brothers stood in the foyer, too shocked to move. Finally, Clint turned to Tony and quietly asked, “You think Reverend Stanley will be addressing the questions to you, or to her?”
For the second time that day, Steve startled out of his tumbling thoughts and blinked around himself to see who had spoken.
“It’s a long story, but he is a lot stronger, faster, and smarter than he used to be. We can’t underestimate him, we have to hurry.”
She made her way to Clint first, carrying a change of clothes and the vial of potion that would turn him from a donkey to a human man again.
By the end of his consultancy, Tony could confidently say he’d done everything he set out to do. Once the other websites got with the program, Tony had the data necessary to make a solid case for their theory - enough so that Captain Carter agreed to back their play. Most importantly, he gave them six viable suspects: six sugar daddies that the four victims all met within the weeks leading to their disappearances.
P.S. The person who leaked the nuptials to the Boston Gazette tried to confess, but Steve didn't want to listen.
All at once, Tony was all around and within him, and Steve could feel the warmth of his skin even if he couldn’t feel as much of him yet as he wanted. The memory of Tony’s lithe, powerful body riding the mechanical bull was still too fresh in his mind, and it was scary how quickly his heart was racing at Tony’s insistence that tonight was only about him. It was exciting, but scary in its passivity; with every touch of Tony’s fingers, every eager love bite, Steve could feel his restraint fading. The urge to take control was nearly overwhelming. His hands ached to bodily turn Tony onto his belly and open him up on his fingers, to fuck him until he sobbed.
“Tony,” Steve said as soon as Tony shut the door behind them. He hadn’t even let go of his duffle yet, and his tone was inexplicably cautious and uncomfortable that Tony’s eyes grew wide with concern. Were Dum-E’s guts all over the floor again? Had he forgotten to clean up and again left his room looking like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of actual chainsaws?
Tony was the only one who didn’t react with gleeful surprise. “
“Never interrupt a customer again, pet,” Steve growled through his teeth against Tony’s ear. His anger was palpable, and Steve’s disappointment left Tony cold and shivering after such a violent affair. “That is not your place.”
A man not much older than himself was sitting on the nice leather couch, clutching a packet of Hostess Sno Balls in one hand while he had a pink, half-eaten treat in the other. There was nothing sinister about it, or even that unusual, but Steve got the distinct feeling that he’d walked in on something rather private instead of simply interrupting a stranger’s morning sugar spike.
“Your dad?” Jimmy asked in surprise, “not your agent or—”
ridiculous,” he teased, easing himself onto the couch beside Steve.
Steve smirked at the question. “Es solo una suposición.”
“I’m fucking hungry,” the donkey complained after licking Tony’s plate clean, and Tony frowned. “You got any more turnips?”
“I don’t know, Sparky,” Tony said with exaggerated suspicion. He swept his soap lathered hand over Steve’s cock, balls, then the crack of his ass, forcing Steve to take a wider stance to steady himself so Tony rubbed his soaped up thumb slowly around the puckered rim. “That look of yours is filthy.”
an image that won’t haunt me forever,” Bruce said with a sigh of defeat while Tony continued his monologue.
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Maria said with a roll of her eyes, and she turned to walk back out to the sitting room where they’d been preparing to have the ceremony. “I got him hanging up the flowers, come see him yourself when you’re dressed!”
“Detective,” Tony greeted him with a deep, satisfied purr. “Is this a good time?”
“I’m just gonna cut to the chase. I’ve been trying to think of how to say it, but nothing I’ve rehearsed sounds any better than the truth. So, basically, all the sexual material in my books either come from my imagination,
“Even if I wanted to,” Steve said after a short pause to give his full attention to correcting the shading around Tony’s ankle, and even when he carried on with his answer, he still sounded distracted. “There isn’t much ‘special occasion underwear’ for men.”
“Patrol officer found another body this morning. It’s recent, TOD less than two hours ago,” Bucky explained over the phone. “Tony’s been arrested, Steve. He was found on the scene, victim’s blood all over him.”
“Ma used hazelnuts when I was little, since that was what we had,” Steve told Lila (and the rest of them) while handing out cutting boards and a few bags of nuts to adults around the counter. There were almonds, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts for them to pick from. Only Natasha and Rhodey seemed to get onboard with the unspoken request to chop nuts; both Bucky and Tony were happy to sit back and munch on handfuls of delicious nuts. “We didn’t get almonds until after the war, and I didn’t know what macadamia nuts were until… when did we go to America?”
From behind him, Steve snarled, a dark, fierce sound that silenced the room. The power of him, the unquestioned dominance raked through Tony’s body in a sudden rising swell of desire, leaving him shuddering and gasping with need. The thought of his lover, powerful and proud enough of his pet to fuck Tony in front of a full audience of creatures who craved the touch and taste of him, twisted in his mind as it appealed to the most immoral, depraved side of his character.
“Mr. Rogers, this is a surprise. How can I help you?”
Wade tightly clutched his leg, wishing he didn’t have to break that sweet woman’s heart.
“The media doesn’t know that. All they know is the eccentric billionaire and now he’s been spotted going out with a ‘male model.’ They’re going to think Steve is just another notch in your bedpost.”
“Wade, no matter what others say or think, you are perfect for me,” Peter reminded him.
She held it out to him in offering and explained her odd measuring by saying, “This is Asgardian liquor. Thor gave it to me, it’s the strongest stuff I’ve ever had.”
“What’s stupid?” She elaborated from her place on his bed. She was leaning back on his headboard with her legs stretched out over the mattress.
He had nothing of Steve’s or any keepsakes of their time together, just their memories…
Who was Peter Parker?
Iron Man’s head dropped and he stopped pushing Norman. Norman was so surprised that he loosened his grip on the superhero. Stark was a hothead. Where was the anger? The retribution?
“Do not remind me,” Bucky groaned.
The glasslike Hulk cage also arrived but it sat empty on the landing on top of the tower. SHIELD was crawling all over the island. Venom popped up all over but always disappeared before Avengers or SHIELD came in force.
There was no need to stir it in as the mass was already churning in on itself.
Steve shot off the bed and they both hurried back into the other room.
A light flush stained Steve’s cheeks and he leaned back into Tony’s side and countered, “You always look great.”
“It worked!” Eddie hissed excitedly.
“Touché. Alright, did you bring a bribe? If you have nothing to bribe me with, Pepper has not properly prepped you, and I’m not coming down.”
The affection drew Steve’s gaze up and he looked up at Tony with big, wet, sad eyes. It broke his heart. He didn’t want to see Steve like this. He wanted to see the man who stumbled into his life with a big smile on his face and wonder in his eyes.
“No,” Steve replied, his mind going back to the plane crash. “I was alone.”
James did not reply to either of them. His eyes were focused on the door. With horror churning in her gut, she knew that he had to be waiting for his orders.
“Wade, baby, you don’t know how happy I am to see you,” Peter gasped, trying to catch his breath. His left shoulder was busted and, with every heartbeat, its pain grew. Peter, however, was all eyes for his boyfriend.
The 107
The mass settled back into the beaker, its surface as smooth as glass, like nothing had happened.
“I don’t still love Bucky,” Steve interrupted. He flushed guiltily and said, “…I mean I did love him, now…I don’t know what I feel toward him. Heck, I don’t even know if he is alive…”
. All others scared him shitless.
‘I’ll be waiting! ;D’
“I love you,” Peter whispered into his mouth and his breath ghosted over Wade's tongue.
!” Steve gasped and grasped his flailing hands. Steve cupped his face and begged, “Don’t move. Please, don’t move. You’re safe!
Steve followed and they walked parallel with the long table between them until they met at the end. Tony pinched his arm and they both grinned with the secret flirtation.
“I can’t imagine why?” Peter replied sarcastically. They grinned at each other and their smiles were perfect mirrors of each other’s.
Tony nervously continued, “So…yeah…you weren’t supposed to see me. If you could just forget…”
Steve’s jaw dropped slightly and his heart did an odd flip in his chest, as he did not know if he should feel elated or horrified by Tony’s proclamation.
“No can do, Mr. Agent, sir,” Peter replied. Tony could hear the smile on his voice.
“First, I’ll go back to pacing,” Tony replied and went back to the said activity. “And then your guess is as good as mine.”
“I cannot reveal that without changing the future,” Jarvis stated.
“Lie?” Bucky whispered. Steve lifted his head and met Bucky’s confused eyes.
The doctor smirk and said, “I don’t know my boss’s number either. Cell phones, you know? How about you call your family and they can call your ranking officer?”
Steve scrambled back to his feet and ran to Tony, watching with horror as the man ripped off the rest of Tony’s helmet.
Tony clenched his fists, wanting to kill whoever did that to Bucky. They did it enough times to make him remember and dread it.
“I’m twenty-one,” Peter said and pulled his ID out of his breast pocket. He put it there for easy access, knowing this would happen.
He clenched his jaw as he too was overcome with emotion. He buried his face in her shoulder and whispered, “I love you, Aunt May.”
Peter took a steadying breath and stated to the nearest camera, “Find Eddie Brock. He helped me make this. He’ll be our best bet in getting it off –.”
Maybe Enigma wasn’t stalking Tony or keeping tabs on him for Obadiah. Maybe he had been keeping an eye on his progress with his suit for the government…
He looked to her and saw she was smiling warmly at the both of them. She whispered, “Now you really have to tell me everything.”
The Soldier felt sick. He was going to vomit. There was no stopping it but he could delay it long enough to separate himself from the others so they would not think him weak.
Steve quietly sat down at the counter and watched it all with an amused grin.
Looking to Sam, Steve asked, “Can we move the beds together?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Their lips parted and James whispered into her mouth, “James. I want you to call me James…only you. Everyone else can call me Bucky…but my true name belongs to you alone.”
He watched her entranced. Her lips were redder from kissing his and her hair was slightly rustled from its usual perfect appearance.  Her pale green eyes flickered up and focused on him. She stated, “If you want to kiss me again you need to finish cleaning those guns and then eat all your proteins.”
Their eyes met from across the room and Tony winked at him.
“Father-dearest, won’t you please tuck me in tonight,” Peter retorted with an obnoxiously, annoying, squeaky voice.
The video switched to a different camera. Jarvis focused the image on a pair of feet walking into the screen. It revealed jeans and then the dark sweater. And then…Steve.
What was he getting into?
“Fuck…” Tony hissed with realization.
He and Bucky had started off with bullies in alleyways but, with the war, Steve knew he was destined to fight. Anyone with a zeroed out implant were encouraged to fight…but Steve kept getting denied for his ailments.
Tony continued, “What the general public does not know is that I would not have lived, nonetheless escaped, if it were not for a man named Yinsen. When my suit was calibrating, the terrorists were coming and we realized we were not going to have enough time. Yinsen sacrificed his life so I would have a chance to escape. Yinsen was my friend and if my code only loaded faster he could have survived. I blamed myself for Yinsen’s death.” Tony pulled back and grasped Peter’s face. Peter’s tears were falling freely and he was surprised to see tears in Tony’s eyes as well.
Steve’s eyes widened with interest and he murmured, “Can we?”
“S-Sorry, it’s just…” He waved both hands in the general direction of Cap’s waist and gasped, “
Steve stuck his head back into the fridge and asked him, “Do you want anything else to eat?”
Steve could have pulled back but he kept his face buried in Tony’s chest and lightly kneaded the muscles in Tony’s back. Tony could not help but remember the inquires he wanted to make but did not want to this moment to end. As it was, this moment was confirming something Tony thought impossible.
Tony grinned victoriously and spun around on his heel, stating, “On the way here, I saw a couple of abandoned buildings that I was considering for hook up points for Steve and I, but they’ll do for a temporary charging station as well.”
razor…
upset Aunt Tasha,” Bucky pushed on. “And I remembered that I loved her too late. I hurt her, your Pops, and Uncle Tony in the process.”
Still grinning smugly about the bear in his hands. Tony leaned into Steve with a happy sigh. Steve shifted into the 21
The picture he was looking for was a professional one of his father in a suit. It was a large photo and it must have been 8 x10 inches. It was the clearest out of all the photos in the album with its high quality and it was the closest thing Peter had to actually looking at him.
His heart ached and his soul felt tired. He had thought his last struggle with the Red Skull had been hard, what with knowing he was going to die but…but this constant struggle to get back the amazing life he’d only had a taste of…and the constant failings…
“No, he won’t,” Steve interceded, turning to him and placing his other hand over their joined hands.
Wade’s near-instant reply was: ‘Holy-frickity-frack you can have insider knowledge and can help me write the best fanfiction EVER!’
They returned to kissing but both pulled at their remaining clothing, desperate to be naked and for their flesh to touch unencumbered.
Tony’s grip tightened on him slightly but he made no immediate rebuttal, a sign that he agreed despite eventually stating, “You being here to comfort me is enough…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks again and the next chapter will be out in a week! (a teaser will be out on my tumblr in a couple days!) :D
Bucky walked away before Bruce could say anything else. He went straight to Steve and met his gaze with eyes that were filled with turmoil.
“This…” Steve looked desperately at Tony, not knowing what to say.
Steve hissed and clutched his head. Blood began to seep from a laceration on his forehead. His eyes flickered to Tony inside the car. His boyfriend was enraged and by the way his hand went to his door handle Steve knew Tony was going to cause a scene.
“Wade is smitten,” Steve observed. “He hasn’t left Peter’s side since the fight ended.”
Steve nodded then went to the cabinet she point to and found the kit she was talking about. He silently placed it next to her then turned to leave.
Tony could not sleep a wink. The disgust on Peter’s face kept replaying in his mind.
“H-He’s gay?
“Ripely is hot,” Tony countered, settling onto the couch next to Steve.
He held Steve’s hands so tightly that his knuckles turned white and his muscles trembled. Tony gasped, “I-I love y-you.”
Wade didn’t let go of him and grumbled, “You don’t need to. I didn’t leave the window open in the first place.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He ran his fingers over the smooth stone. It was cold, nothing like Steve's warmth. Tony whispered, "There were a lot of things we both wished for between us but we didn’t get any of it so I guess that’s just the curse of our relationship…”
Fat tears were blurring his vision.
“I nearly peed my pants when I realized I was facing off against
“That can’t be Barnes, Steve,” Tony reasoned. “He’s dead! You saw him die with your own eyes!”
. Jarvis was able to scramble all the cameras that had Wi-Fi uplinks but there were a few older cameras without them that captured Stark with Rogers.”
“…Yes, Sir, maximum thrust should be able to do it but it will require both hand repulsors, at full charge, for full body removal…” Jarvis paused like the AI always did when delivering bad news. It was a long pause, longer than most, and Tony patiently waited. Jarvis eventually continued, “Sir, such heat on the human body, even with his healing abilities, I don’t think Master Parker –.”
Peter’s hands tightened on him and he demanded, “Are you healed?”
Howard bent down and stuck his head in the oven. The machine was simple in its build and he saw no obvious tampering, but his perfectly well-built oven was spewing noxious fumes.
“Peter…” Wade sighed heavily. He must have noted Peter’s pain and he cupped Peter’s face with both hands. He looked at him with sad eyes and whispered, “You’re badly injured…That was too close…” His thumbs traced along Peter’s cheekbones and then he bent down to press his forehead to Peter’s. He breathlessly continued, “Oh, Peter…What can I do for you, baby boy? I wish I could share my mutation with you...How can I make you heal faster like this? I hate to see you hurting…My baby boy should be lounging on a plush unicorn being hand fed chilled grapes…not in some SHIELD regulated hospital bed looking more dead than alive…”
Italian translations:
Tony’s mouth curved up into a drowsy smile. Soon he couldn’t keep his eyes open, but in a last effort to communicate to Steve that he wanted him close, that Tony was happy that he was with him, Tony’s fingers twitched around Steve’s gentle grip in a sleepy facsimile of a squeeze.
“Wait, Steve,” Tony interrupted, but Steve shook his head.
“You’re right,” Steve said, leaving
“The only thing I will need my assistant will be mailing to me by tomorrow night,” Steve replied after a beat. “You—will we ...will it make it?”
” she suddenly inhaled as the pieces came together. “You’re being deported.”
His words felt like a slap in the face. And she might as well have spit in his wounds with her self-satisfied smile, smug and knowing as it was.
He hadn’t made it half-way through his dinner before he realized the pounding storm and howling winds were suspiciously articulate.
Steve blinked back at him with round, owlish eyes. “Even… even, uh. Even if it gets serious?”
“Steve, are you okay?”
When Steve released him, Tony only had a moment to feel his aching, twitching hole well and truly gaping open before the canister was thrust into him, stretching and forcing his tight body to accommodate the imposing girth of the canister.
“Let’s go, Tony. Guess you’ve got your work cut out for you,” Steve said with a wry smile, grabbing his jacket and fishing out the car keys to be sure they were set. “I’ll drive.”
“It’s eight o’clock at night, you look like an idiot with that on,” he observed, tapping the brim of Steve’s hat lightly with his menu. Steve snickered quietly and half-heartedly batted the menu out of his face, but otherwise said nothing. “Dressed like a dumb frat boy and you’re still hotter than sin. It’s just not fair.”
Steve wasn’t sure what was going on until the passenger side window rolled down and he heard Happy’s familiar voice call his name. Steve crouched just enough to peer in through the window. “Happy? Where’s Tony, shouldn’t you be with him?”
“You are filthy rich.”
“What will the show be?” he asked, a little breathless in his excitement. “Am I—will they be fucking me? I’ve never; I mean, not that many, not at the same time—”
“They are dead,” Tony whispered, his words breaking and borderline hysterical in his shock. “So many dead.”
“But the rest of it is. Don’t get hung up on the
Steve crouched beside the platform then, cradling Tony’s head in his hands and pressing their foreheads together, grounding them both in one shared moment of peace.
slipped out.  “Come in—Marple, go in,” he told her so she wouldn’t run up behind him and trip him, but before he had to negotiate the minor step of his doorway, Mr. Perfect was there again, ducking under his arm to support Tony’s careful hop-steps.
“Then earlier tonight,” Steve said with reluctant finality as he laid out a photograph of the third murder. Another young woman who couldn’t have been more than 30, so full of life for someone so pale. “Page 34 of Sweeping Tide.”
This time when Steve led him into his place, they went to the living room first. Steve made sure they sat down; sitting seemed very important to him in this moment, except he couldn’t seem to sit still for very long himself.
“You weren’t just drunk, you were—”
He smoothed his lubed hand over his cock in a loose fist, lined himself up, and thrust in with such force Tony lost his breath with a grunt of surprise. There was no waiting, no adjusting, Steve pounded into him without abandon, soon losing himself to the way Tony’s ass and thighs bounced to the same maddening pace of his hips. They had only just started and he desperately tried to control himself, to make it last, but the jiggle and bounce of Tony’s beautifully round, perky ass was too much, he could feel instinct start to take over when Tony reached back and grabbed him by the neck.
With his lips obediently closed, Steve still hummed against the base of Tony’s cock. Tony groaned softly and glanced down in time to catch Steve winking slyly back at him before ducking his head.
Steve caught him. Tony gazed up at him with a dopey smile and half-lidded eyes, euphoric in his afterglow. Steve smiled back and bent to gather up Tony’s legs in his arms, lifting him in a bridal carry. Between softly whispered words of praise and affection, Tony murmured the number to their room. He nuzzled into Steve’s chest, and tired as he was, all that mattered was that Tony trusted Steve. Steve would not to let him down.
He needed to call Tony before it was too late.
“Steve?” Tony mumbled, slowly pushing himself up to sitting with small, careful movements. “What’re you doing?”
“Aren’t you worried?” Bucky eventually asked. “What if that woman changed her mind and swung back to pick him up?”
“What? What’s that?” Steve replied while holding the phone farther from his face. “I’m going through a tunnel, you’re break—”
He had been so wrapped up in staying alive and flattening the fiends that it took him much too long to tie the stray clues into a lead.
Breakfast was quiet the next morning. Tony had snuck off while Steve was getting dressed to have words with his dad, and whether Clint and Maria knew about the engagement rings was anyone’s guess.
Almost, until he heard the giggling.
“I am, because I wasn’t,” Steve admitted, even looking at Tony with a little smile. “It’s not easy because it’s simple. Nothing ever is.”
She laughed in delighted surprise, and happily took one of his offered fries. “I’m Amanda, it’s nice to meet you, too, Tony.”
Rather than responding to Steve’s question, Tony engaged the remote computer to call up the information directly.
“Tired of seeing you?” Steve guessed with an affectionate smile. “No, genius, I won’t get tired of seeing you. I’ll either be in the shower or on the couch when you get there, so just let yourself in, alright?”
“This is a little more delicate,” Tony said as calmly as he could. “We are gay monarchs. We don’t have an heir. We just united two kingdoms, not everyone is happy about that. We need to be careful.”
ngghhhhh that video of cap at the concert with tony’s mom learning how to dance got me fucking pregnant
All at once, the fight died in Steve’s chest. Blood drained from his face, and he stared at Tony’s hurt, angry expression in shock.
“If it’s so little you’re not sure,” Tony murmured, drowsy in his afterglow, “it’s not serious, Steve… feel fine, I promise, babe…”
Steve grunted again, a little more insistent this time in his effort to form a ‘no,’ but his tongue was heavy and his head was foggy and neither would cooperate enough to allow him to speak.
“Coffee? Saturday? Eleven o’clock, Maitre Choux on Harrington Road. I’ll wear something fitted. Sexy but tasteful, because I’m not trying too hard.”
He rewound the video back by twenty seconds and hit play again.
After a long day of poring over lab results from the crime scenes and tracking down witness for their testimonies, Bucky and Steve had popped in long enough to update the home team before getting on to a meeting at the 62nd. Long enough to thaw the icicles in their clothes into chilling rain before heading into the bitter New York winter again.
Steve stared back at him like a deer in headlights, and his surprise was enough to have Tony laughing.
Steve couldn’t resist walking back to him to cradle Tony’s face gently in his hands and lifting his head to press a kiss to his spit-slick lips.
Steve snickered and rolled his eyes, thumping Tony on the back gently to interrupt his list before it went on too far. “That’s enough out of you,” he said with a smile, then with a playful squeeze of Tony’s hips, he said, “Go upstairs, get comfortable. I’ll be right behind you.”
“He’s getting there,” Tony said with a smile. The memory of Steve getting there earlier that morning, and in the hours before dawn, and twice before midnight was enough to send shivers down Tony’s spine. Quickly, he cleared his throat before Bucky might notice and resumed wiping down his pristine car as a distraction. “Not back to work yet, but maybe next week. Desk duty for a while, he said.”
Steve shook his head and raised a hand to get Tony’s attention. Tony snapped his mouth shut and gave Steve all his attention. “I think I missed a step, Tony,” Steve told him. “What problem would you solve by starting your own company?”
The thundering sound of boots filled the hallway, and Rumlow laughed. Natasha was the first to react by running out to meet the coming threat, but Bucky stalled, staring at his best friend as Steve and Rumlow rolled to their feet.
Steve held on, fucking Tony through his aftershocks as Tony continued to shudder and jerk his hips in his pleasure, groaning and drooling around his mouthful of Steve’s forearm. Slowly, he eased down from the force of his orgasm, and with a deep, guttural moan of satisfaction, Tony rolled his hips back to meet Steve’s leisurely thrusts. He was high on endorphins, high on life, and all he seemed to need anymore was Steve’s fat cock filling him. He followed the gentle nudge of Steve’s arm, twisting so they came face to face again and Tony could reach his mouth, sucking on his bottom lip with lazy interest and watching the dazed smile that spread over Steve’s face. The next time Steve was buried to the hilt inside him, Tony squeezed down around him; he purred at the sight of Steve’s eyes rolling back into his head, and he chased the victory with a sloppy, needful kiss. This time he heard Steve gasp his name, quiet but unmistakable.
Sharon glared up to the sky and took that brief moment to brace herself before grabbing her boss by the arm and towing him a little further away from the nice bar they had agreed to meet up at. There, in the nascent shadows of the alleyway, she tried to explain.
Despite himself, Steve couldn’t resist smiling back.
Tony couldn’t contain his smile when Steve kissed the bridge of his nose, and he wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist to squeeze even closer. “Dawn and dusk,” he said, explaining in undertone. It was only for Steve to hear, after all. “There’s something hopeful about them. One thing ends and another thing begins. You can do anything, then soon it’s night or morning and you have a fresh start.”
“So long as she overnights it, and there’s no bad storms, that shouldn’t be a problem.”
“Are you going to introduce us or not?” Howard asked Tony then in the relative privacy when Clint stepped out of the room. “We ain’t seen you in seven years, and now you’ve been here five minutes with no manners and pitchin’ a fit?”
Natasha scoffed without having to look at either of them. “He’s sober.”
He cleared his throat, and really did his best to keep a straight face. “Well. She’s not wrong about that, kiddo.”
“Shh! I’m in,” Tony quickly hissed at him, turning back to the computer now that he was past the encryptions. The thumb drive did quick work of gathering all of Wayne’s browsing history and his saved passwords while Tony scanned the likeliest corners of his hard drive for incriminating evidence.
Tony turned his head to brush his lips over Steve’s, sucking on his bottom lip softly before releasing it reluctantly. “Pier first?” he said under his breath, confident that Steve was so focused on him that he would hear his question easily.
With bated breath, Tony scrolled through the countless photos of vivid colors splattered across the wall of a government building. The meticulous timestamps showed how, for eight whole seconds, the devastating words
“Never done this in a suit before,” Colin observed with a little frown, shaking out his arms in his button up. Without the accommodating stretch of workout clothes, or the freedom of nudity, Colin couldn’t quite find a comfortable position once his arms and shoulders braced to hold his weight.
The plan wasn’t perfect and Bucky knew it. If Bucky took Steve’s security detail with him, there was still a slim chance that someone would attack their undefended king and unravel Terrini in these delicate nascent years of peace. But if he didn’t compromise somewhere, Steve would take drastic measures. Worse still, Steve would never forgive him - even if Bucky was only doing his job to keep Steve safe.
Steve had not wandered out into the city to find him, but he had heard of this youth center, this little hole in the wall spot in Malasana between the hip restaurants and funky bars where boxing was turned into a healthy pass-time and basics of self-defense for young children who had few alternatives otherwise. And sure, he didn’t speak Spanish and they didn’t really speak English, but Google Maps still understood what he wanted to find, and he got there in the end. One day he just walked in, surprising the kids with a visit to make them happy and support a space that's introducing them to boxing in a positive way for positive reasons, and he wouldn't even really think to stay for too long - he wasn't there to disrupting anything, after all - but when he walked in, the first thing he saw somewhere in the middle of a gaggle of teens taking turns on the punch mitts was Tony. He had yet to turn away from the kids, and only his back was turned to Steve, but Steve could have recognized him anywhere.
Steve rolled his eyes, but rather than answering him, he stepped back into his hotel room, leaving the door wide open in his wake as a giant hint for Tony to follow. It wasn’t long before Tony stepped into the room and let the door fall shut behind him.
It didn’t matter that hundreds of outstanding engineers worked in SI’s research and development alongside Tony every day, or that Tony’s momentary absence would not lead to a deficit. SI was Tony’s commitment to their people; working was his duty. So for him to give in and stay home as easily as he did, Steve could only imagine how awful he felt.
“If you don’t think my personal hero would be safe in my hometown,” Tony started to say, quite serious in his tone. Like a charm, Steve’s hesitant little smile shone, and he watched Tony settle back down in bed, his body curved just so to casually leave space for Steve to move in close beside him.
Steve threw back his head with a laugh, and Tony found himself wishing it would go on forever. As his laughter quieted into tickled chuckles and a delighted smile, Steve settled more comfortably, watching Tony as if they were the only two people in the crowded bar.
His arms were raised directly over his head in a matter of seconds. The machine worked more slowly in adjusting his legs, turning him first to angle his hips down. That first step had been relatively easy, but Tony gasped at the pinch of discomfort and pain as the cuffs folded his legs and tucked his thighs against his torso. Inch for inch it raised his legs further. It didn’t matter how Tony pushed against the cuffs, the machine was too strong for his body, and soon his knees nudged up against his shoulders as if it was a natural position to lie in.
“So much,” Steve whispered softly, keeping his voice low for Tony’s sake. He used his elbow to bump the switch for the jacuzzi jets to come on, then climbed in with care.
But Tony didn’t take the cotton candy! He put something in Steve’s mouth instead then peered at him like he was the last to know that nothing in the whole wide world was better than cotton candy. Steve would’ve reminded him if it wasn’t for the incredible water on his tongue, and he sucked on the straw for more - but Tony moved it away.
“I’m glad you got in before the storm,” Steve told him in a quieter, more serious voice. “They were talking about shutting down Logan for the afternoon planes, there’s a blizzard hitting tonight. It’s going to be bad for a few days.”
All Steve had to do was wait, but patience had never been his strongest suit.
You made me miss the game winning goal in overtime to mess with me?”
He came out to find Tony snooping in his fridge with a confused look on his face. “It’s just me, Tony. How come?”
Steve wouldn’t have come out of the closet if it wasn’t real
Peter grinned and nodded in agreement.
Tony whistled and murmured appraisingly, “Very nice…but, we could straighten out your tie a little…”
Hello, everyone! I’m sorry for the long hiatus. Since I last posted, I had been badly injured in a car accident and then my brother survived the Las Vegas shooting. Needless to say, my family and I went through a lot of emotional upheaval and I’m just now getting back to my writing.
Natasha propelled both super soldiers back behind the door before Schmidt could speak.
Tony looked around them. They were in Howard’s personal, private tent. It was a big upgrade from the one Tony had been using with the Commandos. It was much larger and could probably sleep six more people. Instead, it contained Howard’s large cot and several suitcases. Tony’s attention was most drawn to the cot since he was sitting on it and it felt like it had a 40s version of a memory foam travel mattress in addition to thick blankets instead of sleeping bags.
“But—.”
“Who are you?” The current, older Peggy whispered into his ear from his memory.
Bucky distracted him by asking about his past. They went over the basics at first but Bucky was able to coax him into talking about their funnier escapades. He got Steve to laugh, drawing the first true grin he had seen from Bucky since the 1940s.
The irony of the entire situation was not lost on the symbiote. It seemed he was fated to die if he stayed or left his host.
“…Alright, now what?” Clint murmured.
“Yah, until Papa woke me.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Steve blush, it appeared redder than usual thanks to the red light of dusk. Steve sputtered, “W-Well…I-I mean… I can’t really dance?”
and he is dead because of
Bruce jumped up and pulled the holo to him. In a more calmer voice, he said, “Think, Brock. You made this. You know everything that went into it. This is your baby. You probably dream of its chemical deposition in your sleep. What can weaken it?”
Steve continued, leaning forward in Tony’s hold, “With him out of power, Hydra will crumble. We’ll get SHIELD back on its feet and right the world. If you kill him though he’ll be a martyr for Hydra…”
Norman Osborn had to dig his nails into his flesh and draw blood to keep from laughing aloud at the SHIELD agents. They came to his tower with a warrant to search the labs Mary occupied and did not even try to search his own personal labs serval floors below. Had they checked his labs they would have found the Goblin Formula and gamma-radiation devices.
He shouldn’t be attracted to Tony. Tony was not just his friend…he was a man. Men being with men was…wrong.
Steve's smile widened for the cameras as his real smile shone through. He whispered into Tony's ear, "That was me foolishly getting lost in the moment as I shared my first kiss with my soulmate."
“Never say never,” Tony retorted. He pushed himself from his spot and rounded the counter to Steve’s side. He pulled Steve away from the counter and into his arms. Tony explained, “Nothing is boring with Tony Stark and dancing is relatively easy if you have the right partner. Jarvis, music!”
Steve’s face blanked and his hold on Tony twitched. Steve whispered, “…W-Wha-What?”
“I've been feeling like the third wheel for like an hour now. I think it's time for me to turn in. Goodnight fellas.”
She cupped his face with both hands and gasped, “James?!”
“I got it!” Tony said, shoving the magazine into Steve’s hands.
When they left the tub, their fingertips had wrinkled with excess water and the tub water was freezing.
“Take Peter,” Steve hissed. He started to pull his son from his chest but Peter latched on tighter and screeched.
Steve returned the kiss with an appreciative hum and whispered, “Good morning, honey… It’s really morning already?”
Bucky’s hand clenched and he whispered, “Then…please, stop calling me that.”
Peter appeared thirty seconds later with a flustered smile and quickly dashed into the lab. As he came over to them, he said, “I’m late for my meeting with Eddie so I just wanted to quickly stop in and say hi!” He embraced Tony first and then did the same to Steve. He said, “I’ll see you guys later! Wanna do lunch?”
As soon as Peter left, Tony had Friday pull up the building’s security footage and watched his son make his way to the research labs, several floors below.
“Say it,” a voice resonated on the video, its speaker, the Red Skull, was unseen.
“Should I move on?” Tony murmured, one finger uncurled from the towel and lightly touched the base of his cock.
(in other words more superfamily!), and finally a fic where Steve wakes in the ice by himself before SHIELD finds him (and how he discovers the modern world and Tony)!
“Rogers, do you remember when we agreed that you would not go to the Frankfurt Book Fair because you were not allowed to leave the country while your visa application was being processed?”
Maybe Steve would even let some of them practice on him, finger and pry him open, load him with a canister.
“Que lindo eres, Star-Lord, you’re so handsome,” Tony promised the little dog who was absolutely insistent on licking Tony’s ears. “I—hey! Easy there, baby,” he said as he tried to corral the dog. Steve again reached out to help, but Tony quickly hugged the boxer closer to his chest before Steve could scoop this one away, too, and end up with
“Steve?”
The next night Steve found himself on Tony’s doorstep, hoping that Tony was home.
“Sweetheart, promise me.”
In one smooth push, Tony impaled himself on the curved dildo. What the toy lacked in length or girth, it made up for with a perfect curve that grazed his prostate with every thrust. Whether Tony rode it straight, bouncing up and down on the full length of the dildo, or spread his thighs wide to roll his hips to take it at an angle, it seemed to bend with a single-minded goal to knuckle over his prostate.
Happy only needed a few seconds to take Steve up on his offer. He told Steve to go on inside while he got everything sorted with the valet, and soon enough, they were both seated at a table where they could enjoy the delicate shimmering melody woven in a gilded harp. When the waiter first came to take their order, he addressed Happy before Steve, taking his cue from the way they were dressed. Happy easily fit in with the crowd in his classic black and white suit, but Steve, who’d been caught on his way home from work, still wore the standard red sweats and white uniform polo all the therapists wore.
who shall not be named rewatched Groundhog’s Day on the flight, I listened to a history show,” Tony replied with a pleased smirk, and Steve rolled his eyes.
As they did every year on the cold, dark winter night midway between the winter solstice and the vernal equinox, the township’s residents gathered to observe the ritual that determined their shared fate in the coming year. The original settlers built their town around the rock and hewed an altar from where the heart and blessings would forever reach its people. As a symbol of the union between the original Celtic settlers and the American Indians who founded Marham, two tall cedar posts flanked the altar and a willow hoop hung suspended from the ceiling directly over the stone altar. The cedar post was painted red and represented the body of First Man and the tribal ancestors of the American Indian tribe. With the willow hoop, these symbols provided a powerful warding against ill will on the cultures and people who lived in Marham.
He’s not like other people. He is respectful, he’s kind, he listens—not because he’ll get something out of it, but because it’s how you’re supposed to treat people! Who does that, Nat? Hell, I don’t deserve him. And I asked him out, what was I thinking? Have you seen him? He’s sex on legs, I can’t wait until marriage; I don’t even know if I want to get married but I’m horny as hell. I’m not a masochist, what is my life?”
Clint immediately stepped back out of the house and started to pull his boots off on the porch. He sat them down just inside the door in his effort to leave the clean floor unsullied.
Steve didn’t mean to laugh, but Tony’s words caught him by surprise. Tony’s smile grew more bright and irresistible until he pressed forward and quieted Steve’s laughter with a playful and uncoordinated mess of a kiss. Steve smoothed his fingers through Tony’s soft hair and drew him in closer, unable and unwilling as ever to resist his husband.
“You were supposed to dump me by date three,” Tony told him then, with an unusual calm. “You were supposed to get mad. You were supposed to curse me out; call me selfish, ungrateful.”
“One eight seven,” the serene voice of the station computer reported repeatedly, with no further clarification or urgency. “One eight seven. One eight seven.”
Bond laughed shamelessly. Water ran in the background, and Tony could picture the agent preparing a shower. “I like you,” he said, “what’s your name?”
“I am most impressed,” Jane told both Steve and the two tailors waiting to address any concerns. “One cannot guess at the alarming size of your protruding musculature with this design. Even from the back you look less like a murderous meat-eating barbarian. Captain Steven G. Rogers,” she said with a big smile, “To the full extent of my expertise, I deem you officially prepared for your first dining experience at Taco Bell.”
“The only seats left are at minimum $178,” she said after a brief search. “Corner of the rink near the Ranger’s net.”
Steve had enough sense to let go when those strong, calloused fists pounded at his chest, and he leaned back into the bed to watched Tony stare back at him, panting hard and flushed dark with excitement. But Steve’s attention were focused on this new prize that was his mouth, and he couldn’t tear his eyes from Tony’s kiss-swollen red lips, glistening with the aphrodisiac of his spit.
“Just because I can do the job doesn’t mean they’ll overlook my experience,” Tony absently explained, though he sounded fairly distracted by what he was doing. It was only a black screen full of code that meant nothing to Steve, but Tony was typing away with a confidence and speed Steve rarely witnessed.
“I do.”
It was Steve’s mouth being used, his lips tight around Tony’s hardening cock and his cheeks hollowed as he coaxed him to hardness, but it was Tony who was reeling. The shock alone drove him wild. Mere seconds ago Steve had kissed his forehead and offered him solidarity in reviving his presentation, and now, without warning, Tony’s cock grew firm, wet, and warm in the smooth, velvety sleeve of Steve’s mouth.
Steve, and before he knew it or had the chance to prepare, Steve eased the dildo out of him and slowly pulled out.
“I’m fine, Tony. There’s nothing going on,” Steve promised, turning them towards a flower stall in the hopes of distracting him. He had no business being attracted to observant people, he really didn’t.
Without a word, Bucky dumped his king into the chair and turned on Al Jazeera.
After all this time, the thought of escape had abandoned Tony’s consciousness entirely.
“What—boss, you sure it’s safe?”
“Can we help with dinner?” Steve said instead of answering Tony.
“Why don’t you take me to Bea in Hell’s Kitchen?”
His question was rhetorical, but Jane erred on the side of polite manners and shook her head. “No, Tony Stark. Was it exciting, sir?”
“Well, one way or another that man is lying, and I don’t care what a liar pays for,” Sam raised his voice to say to both of them. Steve had never more been tempted to throw his friends into the fucking river. It wasn’t even a temptation, it was an
It was slimmer than any phone Steve had seen, and if he hadn’t known any better, he’d never think it was more than a piece of polished obsidian. But apart from how slim it was, Steve couldn’t see anything unusual about it. When he looked up at Tony for an explanation, Tony flipped the phone over and slipped off the backing that covered the battery.
Steve grinned with genuine amusement, finally slipping out of his jacket to hang it up in the closet along with Tony’s. “Well, you made it sound serious,” he said in his own defense. “Make yourself comfortable, I’ll be right there. Drink?”
Tony and Clint exchanged uncomfortable glances, and it wasn’t until Clint pointed out that he’d done all the physical work so far that Tony steeled himself and said, “That is not the legend we have heard,” he explained. “We… we were searching for the Last Chief. She who prophecy says will unite men with the tribes of Women and bring peace when she becomes the Great Chief. No binding ceremony required,” he finished awkwardly.
It took a minute for Steve to process what he had heard.
“It’s a short about a kid who rescues a duck egg on his way to school, and on the way the egg hatches in his pocket. He can’t get rid of the duck because it imprints on him, so he tries to raise it secretly instead.”
“You’re a smart boy. You already know what’s about to happen, don’t you?” she said with a smile that was all teeth. “Close the door, Stark.”
“…Tony Stark, are you lying to me?”
“Fine, whatever. Sorry, ma’am,” he said to Jane before turning back to Tony. “Where’s the bathroom?”
Steve made a quiet, plaintive noise under his breath, just loud enough for Tony to hear. Tony took the hint easily.
As the fear ebbed, and Steve noticed that there was no pain, no overt discomfort, awareness returned to him in increments. It began with his gratitude for Tony’s self-restraint, for being able to stay so still and so calm; even his voice didn’t quiver with need. He remembered the first time he fucked Tony, and even now, after having had the privilege twice, he didn’t think he could be this calm if he tried.
Silent as the dead, 006 was standing in his studio. Tony gave a shout and nearly dropped his take-away. It took him a second to start shouting.
Tony swept in like the cool customer he was, and he didn’t stop moving until he found the relative safety of the non-fiction section on the second floor. He grabbed a book off a display and pretended to leaf through it to blend in.
Tony eyed him and his flowers. Then, with a cautious, bashful smile, he accepted the bouquet.
The lazy, instinctive rolls of Tony’s hips quickly began to lose their steady rhythm, and just as his breath was coming in short, desperate pants, Steve forced the canister in all the way and let it lock into Tony’s body as he climaxed, harvesting as much of the boy’s highly prized cocktail of hormones--particularly his serotonin, oxytocin, and prolactin.
; a loaded
Should I fear for my life?
Warning: sexy-time tags apply here.
In his experience Steve always stopped what he was doing to smile when he saw Tony, so to be greeted with a frown now made Tony’s stomach drop. He tracked Steve’s subtle nod until his gaze snapped to some unfamiliar suits crowding around his and Steve’s desks, clacking away on keyboards and digging through drawers. The laminated badges clipped to their suit pockets told Tony he couldn’t kick them out for trespassing, so instead he turned on his heel and marched into Fury’s office, intentionally slamming the door shut behind him.
“…Steve?”
The corporal saluted him and then reported, “Sir, the base is secure but you won’t believe what we found.”
Peter smiled at his uncle but his insides churned nervously. He noted that his uncle did not say yes and wondered about her being “agreeable” again. It depressed him greatly to think his own mother would not want to see him.
“You’re the one who is most in danger with that kind of knowledge,” she stated, seeing the truth.
“Yes, sir.”
and –.”
His lawyers exchanged glances then their leader stated, “We will do the best of our abilities to do so but it will probably come out during the trial. People will want to know. If you are questioned on the stand about it, you cannot lie.”
“Yes, Bucky,” Steve gasped, his voice cracking with emotion. “Yes, but I care for Tony too and I am in a relationship with him.
“You’ve been down here all week,” Steve stated like it was a bad thing.
“You two have been going through my stuff,” Tony stated, glaring at both of them. Neither Natasha nor Bucky looked his way and continued talking.
The small family left quickly, no longer feeling as welcome in the studio as the initially did and it was only when they were in the privacy of their car did Tony say, “I’m sorry she put you in the spotlight like that…”
He was half expecting to see Bucky but it was an older man in a combat military uniform. He had a white crew cut and a thick white mustache. He pointed an AK-47 at Steve, smoke was rising from the barrel. Staring down the barrel, the rounds from the machine gun burned all the more painfully in Steve’s shoulder and arm. The older man’s eyes were mad with rage and his teeth were clenched in a snarl.
Tony had realized he just learned a few things about Captain America: (1) He was a great kisser, and (2) He was no Boy Scout.
At the sound of its voice, Tony finally stirred. Everyone hovered around him worriedly and Howard felt a tinge of relief when Tony opened his eyes. Tony smiled for the first time since Steve’s death and wetly gasped, “J? Is that you, buddy?”
…I might disappear again,” Tony said in the best soothing tone he could muster.
“Don’t.”
“Mr. Brock, Dr. Banner says he would welcome your input. Shall I direct you to his location?” Friday said as he finished dressing into his mussed clothes.
Peter nodded adamantly and his uncle’s glare sharpened then he picked Peter off his feet and embraced him tightly.
Venom tried to trick him but the shadow of the boy’s adoptive parent stood up in his host’s mind and battled Venom in wits and mocked his trickery.
Peter looked up at Wade in shock. More people knew he was Spider-Man than knew he was Tony’s son and he almost let it slip to Wade.
He’d recovered memories in his weeklong stay in his cell but they were parallel to his confinement. He remembered being trapped, hiding in tight spaces, or the constricted clutches of
The doors unsealed as the rest of the team ran in. Bruce fell to his knees beside them with a first responders' medical kit but Wade did not react to any of them. He only had eyes for Peter. Peter stared back, his eyes half lidded and clearly exhausted but filled with love for Wade.
Bucky shook his head and replied, “No, it looks like this is a – a…a wow.”
– there was something I wanted to try.”
It was a place meant to hold criminals not him. He shouldn’t be there.
And Tony was alone, so
“And I think you’d guess right,” Steve replied. Tony chuckled and turned onto his side to fully face Steve. Tony pillowed his head on his folded arm and lay his other arm over Steve’s side. Steve tucked in closer and ran his hand over Tony’s naked back. Tony’s flesh was warm beneath his touch and was marred by old scars and the slight curvature of his back muscles. Steve sighed heavily and touched his forehead to Tony’s. He kept rubbing Tony’s back and murmured, “I don’t think I’m going to be sleeping at all tonight…”
But…more importantly, they were no longer in their era.
When they pulled apart, Tony clasped his neck and murmured, “Another year.”
pizza near here?”
Looking at it caused another wave of pain to flow through him. He made it fuel his anger. He lashed out at Barnes, wanting him to feel the same pain he was. Tony hissed, “That man was
The one Howard had written in the cure for Tony’s palladium poisoning.
He was gearing up his emotions to hear Tony’s voice but instead heard the familiar voice of his AI, “Hello, Captain Rogers, we’ve all been looking for you…”
Wade chuckled and replied, “Good, great, and
The medical examiner’s jaw dropped and he stared at the photo Marcel held with shock. Marcel continued, “We do not have an exact date for the ‘rape’ nor do we have any video from Captain Rogers’ private rooms but Mr. Stark has surveillance of the rest of the buildings. He also has video of Ms. Tyler entering and leaving his Tower wearing her uniform throughout her entire employment. We also have surveillance of Ms. Tyler putting the Avengers’ trash into her vehicle, including Captain Rogers’ trash. She could have easily attained his sample through there. So, in your expert opinion, is it sufficive to say Ms. Tyler most likely took a sample of Captain Rogers’ DNA, after he had consensual sex with his partner and had thrown away the excess DNA? Could she have put that same sample on one of her dresses and cried rape?”
When the other two left, Steve watched Tony work and wanted to help him but was at a loss on how to…eventually, he stepped next to him and wrapped an arm around his waist. Tony leaned heavily into his side and confessed, “I have no idea how they did this.”
—more friction, more of Steve’s touch, and all of Steve’s attention.
“Relax, darling,” Tony whispered, smoothing the heel of his palm over Steve’s back, rubbing slow, gentle circles over his muscles to help angle Steve’s hips better and help release the tension in Steve’s lower back.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony sighed in disbelief. “Are you really asking me out in an IKEA bed?”
“Got it!”
“Alright, longshot, but I think she’s my friend’s ex,” Tony explained while texting up a storm. Then, with a bashful grin, he added, “Remember Dr. Odinson?”
“Oh, finally!”
“Thank you for joining me,” Steve replied in a whisper, turning to better face Tony so that they nearly stood nose to nose when Tony relaxed down on his feet again. “Would you like a ride home?”
“Playing dirty now, are we?” Tony teased in a growl as he straddled Steve’s hips. “Fuck me—use me like you used to, and I’ll do anything you want me to tomorrow.”
“Why? I—”
It didn’t take long for Tony to catch on to Steve’s charade.
Steve hummed thoughtfully and shook his head in awe. “How do you know this stuff?”
“Of course, man, of course, it’d be my honor,” Tony promised, letting his brother go with a clap on the back. “Come on, let’s get this one in the bag. Hell, maybe Reverend Stanley’s got time for a second one?”
Distantly, with barely no energy left to sustain his conviction, Tony told himself that this couldn’t be a repeat of their first time. He wouldn’t be the passive sacrifice to Steve’s hydra tactics again, he couldn’t—he
(It wasn’t until later that night that two of the men he’d gotten close to on the week-long shoot invited him over to their place and showed him exactly how bold, hand-crafted leather armor could be enjoyed.)
“No, oye mami, voy a colgar,” he whispered into his phone in a rush, hurrying to get off the phone while Steve got comfortable in his seat. “Este chico es guapisimo. Sí—ciao, mami.”
will smack the white privilege out of that capitalist, war-profiteering republican—”
“Do you remember where I live?” Steve asked, waiting to hear Tony hum in the affirmative before continuing. “Be here at six, and we can walk from here. Maybe grab a bite to eat on the way?”
Tony gave him a flat look. “More like five minutes.”
Between the warmth of Steve’s body and his absent massage of Tony’s neck and shoulders, Tony had fallen back to sleep. He snored softly through the congestion, and privately Steve thanked god for the mercy of sleep. Carefully, he pulled the covers up over Tony’s shoulders. At first it was only to keep Tony warm, but for every increment Steve pulled the blanket farther up, the more he liked that Tony was hidden from view. The unhealthy sheen of his sickly pale skin made Steve wish anew that he could take it all from him. Why did the cold get Tony and not Steve instead? Steve didn’t have assigned duties for the next two weeks, and more importantly, he didn’t feel the weight of the kingdom on his shoulders the same way Tony did. Steve was only a figurehead, an ambassador at best. Tony was instrumental to the economy. As part of the unification, Tony leveraged global profit from Stark Industries to mitigate the cost of improving Terrini’s outdated infrastructure. They needed roads, railways, and better hospitals, and Tony committed his wealth to making it happen.
The helicopters were not fast enough to pursue, but in the end it didn’t matter. Rhodes had reached the right people in time to shut down all movement in and out of Machtberg fast enough that they caught up with the twelve men who abducted Tony before they crossed the border.
“Hey, Captain America: you’re safe from the pony,” Tony drawled, crawling over to the edge where Steve was now sitting on the floor. “You okay, Steve?”
Tony considered telling him. Recounting his earlier conversation with Bruce, which would inevitably be a compliment to his stamina and strength, then subsequently explain how his sexual prowess was more reminiscent of ancient Greek monsters than any mortal sex Tony had ever had.
“My hips are sore,” Tony murmured in agreement, nestled against Steve’s chest while his master carried him away.
Something slammed and shattered against the front door, and Tony jerked back instinctively. “Go away, Stark!” Thor roared, destroying something else against the door. But this time, Tony kneeled down at the door instead of retreating, pulling out a small lock-picking kit out of his wallet to start working on the door.
“It’s easier to get him into bed from here than from his workshop,” Bucky pointed out around a mouthful of caramel whipped cream. “And you look fine, blue’s your color.”
“Sounds like I’ll need my phone either way, babe,” Tony decided, and he turned to nuzzle at Steve’s outstretched arm to get his attention. “Where’s the coat room?”
“Found your treasure yet?” Tony wondered with a teasing innocence, arching his back and standing on the balls of his feet to push his ass up for Steve.
If Steve didn’t have a problem before, he certainly had one now.
“They live in Africa,” Flora announced, eager to show him how much she remembered from their talk a few minutes ago. “They eat trees and leafs and sometimes they eat flowers, but that can be dangerous, and they have really, really long tongues so they can eat leafs on the tree.”
“I think this is the Strand. This is how far the Thames used to reach,” Tony said even as he turned where he stood to confirm his guess. “This—then, that should be Trafalgar Square,” he told Steve while gesturing to their left. “Wanna go see?”
“I expected a lot of things to happen after three weeks apart,” Tony mused between a string of playful, feather-light kisses he brushed across Steve’s nose, jaw, and his lips. “Cuddling on a couch fully dressed never crossed my mind.”
In their effort to leave these cultural differences alone, Steve and Tony had initially grouped the summer solstice with Easter and Christmas. It wasn’t until plans for their wedding came into the fore that they took a second look. Their wedding day would not only be the anniversary of their union, but that of their country. Briefly, they considered modeling the Dutch tradition of King’s day, a nationwide celebration of their king and country, but it was quickly dismissed as a self-aggrandizing effort that did not fit with their intended direction for the kingdom. They were not alone in their effort to lift Consone and its people; to celebrate the unification and their achievements without recognizing the people and local leaders who made it possible felt insulting and wrong.
Tony Stark, helpless?
“Not for nothing, but that Kim Cattrall was hot,” Bucky garbled around another sizable mouthful of various cream and chocolate balls.
“So what happened that you’re free today?” Steve asked, changing the topic before the silence became awkward.
“I am glad to hear that, Mr. Rogers,” Hawley said and came around to take a seat in a chair opposite him. “Your intuition about the case has been helpful to the case so far, it would be to the detriment of the case to see you go. In fact, I have been impressed with how you’ve handled yourself so far,” she smiled, leaning a little closer until their knees nearly touched. “And this… misstep can be corrected easily. That’s why I asked to see you today.”
“Are you trying to kill me, child?” she demanded, smacking him when he tried to come in for a hug. “You work all day, you call your snacks a lunch—”
“There is no need, I understand, my love. I overreacted, and—”
“I’ll just need a minute to get dressed,” Tony said, snickering quietly in surprised amusement when Steve pouted at him. “Don’t give me that, darling. Undress me when we get back.”
Tony took Steve’s hand in his and brought it to his lips. “My love, what fool am I to deny myself your company?”
“With Thor’s help, we’ll go out and find people to date. Subjects. Decent, regular people; people our readers can relate to. We’ll see how we can manipulate each: for borrowing money, or getting copies of their house-keys. We’ll monopolize their time for ten days, to show how easy it is to begin isolating them from their friends and family. Warning signs that could save our readers.”
“I don’t want to be alone,” he said, opening his eyes again. He didn't know Tony that well, but for indescribable reasons he made Steve feel safe.
“I mean, I don’t know if you’ve heard,” Tony said with the excitement of a man with a plan. “But I scored an interview with Bruce Wayne earlier this year, and he liked it so much he invited me to his annual charity ball. It’s this week, Steve. It’s the perfect opportunity: we’ll have access to everything in Wayne Tower!”
“Don’t jinx us,” Steve chided him absently, licking his lips after their kiss.
“We call him the Captain, after Captain America,” Tony told him when he realized Steve was staring at the dumb-dumbs climbing up on the mechanical bull, only to inevitably be thrown from its back. “Rhodey—no, that’s—
“Hey!” Steve greeted them as he walked up to their table with a large basket of assorted muffins held in front of him in offering. “I’m here to join your study group. And, I brought sustenance! No nuts, but only four are gluten free, I hope that’s alright—and this dark one has no processed sugar, they made it with dates—”
He wanted them to think about the animals as part of their environment, and how the two might have changed over time. He wanted them to think about evolution.
He threw some necessities, jeans, and shirts together into a leather duffle, and by the time he was wrapping up his toiletries, Jan was finally at his door with a large paper bag.
It couldn’t be right; that was impossible, no released felon could ever be released into society with such a training! “Computer, this is no time for mischief—”
“Are you telling him lies, Flyboy?” Bucky growled at Rhodes, stalking up behind Steve like a shadow. He wasn’t as sober as James, but he was angry, and he had the Slugger. Rhodes slowly rose to his feet, but even unarmed, he stood his ground.
But now they’re BOTH off the market!
“Law student,” Steve corrected. “Right here in Boston.”
Pepper didn’t bat an eye. She pulled up a chair, opened her schedule for the day, and got to work.
Murmurs started to flitter around the room while Tony stood at attention and listened to Chief Fury's frustrations, until both Tony and Fury were distracted enough to turn and see what was happening in the station. The far side of the bullpen became translucent before their eyes, and a map of New Yorseylvania filled the wall. A small red dot blinked in the middle.
“Steve Rogers!” Tony cried as soon as he realized what Steve held in his hands, but Steve turned his back to Tony and ignored his continued attempts to get Steve’s attention.
Tony is working on what he thinks is his last project - a short series modern adaptation of
Tony grinned to himself and shook his head slowly. “Then why don’t we grab the ice, and you show me to your bedroom?”
He almost didn’t hear his phone ping with an incoming email.
“So they warned me against California real estate since the housing bubble is on the verge of collapse,” Steve continued, ignoring Tony’s very sensible question and noticeably redder than before, “but I couldn’t stop thinking that a marriage proposal isn’t just to say how much I love and appreciate you: it’s my chance to show you how incredible I think our future will be together. And, I could be wrong,” he finished wryly, “but I thought that was better expressed with a sixteenth century palace, eight guest houses, forty-nine bedrooms, and a pool than a sapphire ring.”
“Oh,” Pepper said suddenly as a jingling ringtone got her attention. “That’ll be Happy. Time to put Olive to sleep,” she said as she got out of her seat and pulled her jacket on. “It’s been so good to see you, Tony. Take care of yourself, so you can meet her the next time you visit.”
They met with the four detectives at the 62nd as planned. Detectives found CCTV footage from a Chase ATM machine that had captured a passing figure in a hoodie matching the description of the person seen with Giordani’s car near the shipyards. Although it was true that many people wore jeans and hoodies, it wasn’t as common in December. Steve grabbed a copy of the footage, thanked them for their cooperation so far, and warned them of the change in oversight.
Oh, GOD. I hadn’t even thought of that!!! I hope you’re right!!
“We, uh,” Steve floundered for a few seconds as it occurred to him how long it had been since he actually talked to his parents. He used to be better about telling them everything. How had he not gotten on the phone with them immediately after his first kiss with Tony? “I told him on Tuesday. We kissed, nothing more.”
“He died,” he said quietly, apologetically. “In an earthquake. In
“By his admission, Tony sometimes uses sex as practical research for his books. You’d have to read them closely to tell them apart, but basically, he said the scenes the killer used were all based in real experience. That can’t be a coincidence.”
“They tell me you are Captain America, or Captain Steve Rogers,” the old man said, his voice deep and soothing. Despite the scene only moments ago, he spoke without a hint of fear. “Your heroism saved the lives of myself, my associate, and countless museum patrons from a most egregious villain. I trust you cherish the peace and beauty of our perfect society as much as we welcome your revival.”
Tony shot Clint an irritated look, but Stephanie didn’t notice. She simply shrugged and said, “There’s no recipe, I just put them over the fire.”
“But then, people started coming up to me,” Steve continued, his expression warming as a smile curled his lips. “People who didn’t even know what team I played for; they probably hadn’t seen a game in their life, honestly. A woman told me her gay grandson had cried when I got transferred to LA. Then all he wanted for Christmas that year was my jersey. I lost count of how many people I met in the first week alone who wanted to talk to me and thank me, Tony, people of all ages. And people kept showing up, to every open training, to every game.”
Laughing, Steve nuzzled into Tony’s smooth cheek down to his meticulous beard, but he pulled back before giving in to those soft, tempting lips. “Impressed enough to say yes?”
“Is this research for the case?” Steve wondered, cautiously stepping between the books and the papers that took up the floor space to follow Tony.
“You’re doing great,” Tony told him with a smile, “How would you feel about a blowjob?”
,” he insisted when Rhodey and Bucky exchanged mutinous looks. “I don’t want to see either of you again until morning.”
