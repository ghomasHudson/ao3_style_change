"No. I definitely saw it walking around on its own last night." Peter poked the arc reactor in its chest.
The scientist looked up when he heard his name. Steve's cell was directly across from his. The soldier had a sad, almost longing look on his face.
The Quinjet took off as soon as everyone was on board. They had only been flying for about ten minutes before Steve heard the distinct tapping of Tony's fingers against his arc reactor.
Peter giggled.
Peter gave him a thumbs up.
"Wonderful," Rhodey sighed. "Now. Anybody want to tell me what the hell just happened?"
"What are you-?!" Bruce gasped right before the HUD went dark once more and the suit powered down completely, falling to pieces at Tony's feet.
"He's the reason you were kicked off the Avengers, wasn't he?" Osborn guessed. "I can have him killed much easier than it would be for me to bring him to you alive."
"This is a bad idea!" Rhodes yelled after him. Iron Man ignored him, continuing on out of the cabin.
Steve knelt next to them, putting a hand on Peter's shoulder, "let me see that wound, son." Peter nodded, wincing as he shifted around to give Steve a better look at his burnt chest. The spider logo was completely gone, with parts of the fabric around it melted to his flesh. Blood seeped down his torso. "Can you stand?"
"If that's what it takes to prove my loyalty to this team, then SHIELD can ask all the questions they want," Sam spoke up. Murmmers of agreement rippled through the quinjet.
Thank you for reading!
Steve stormed over and tried to wrestle Peter out of the pilot's chair. "I don't approve of this suicide mission."
Another somewhat dark chapter. I promise the next one will be more lighthearted with Henry doing what he does best: being a little shit.
Obadiah flipped Iron Man over and proceeded to shatter the protective glass on the arc reactor. He reached into the suit and yanked the device free. "Just power down..." He whispered as if comforting a terrified child. He tossed the reactor just out of reach.
"Correction, I don't mind being called Iron Man. It's just weird, having you guys call me that all the time," Iron Man said quickly. "Considering I don't call you guys by your code names outside of missions."
"HANG ON! I GOT YOU!" Spider-man dove after her, using a web to grab her and pull her into his arms. Michelle clung to him tightly, continuing to scream as the ground quickly rushed up to meet them. Spider-man shot out a large web between the fence and the school. At the last second, Peter wrapped himself around MJ and tossed his weight to the side, causing them to flip positions so that he was on the bottom. "OOF!" The wind was knocked out of him when they landed on the web. "You okay?" He relaxed his grip on Michelle.
Tony groaned when the lights switched on without warning. "Who the fuck-oh." He had momentarily forgotten where he was. Three nights had passed. Nobody had been further questioned since their first day on the Hellicarrier. Fury hadn't shown back up and Tony was convinced the director was planning on letting them rot in their cramped cells. Bruce cameÂ by every once in awhile, he would walk through the cell block, say hello, then leave. Tony tried to get information about Peter whenever Bruce stopped by, but Bruce refused to say anything other than "he's alive". The cot Tony slept on creaked as he sat up. He ambled over to the force field and did a headcount of his team. Everyone was present. And awake. Trays of food had been put in their cells while they slept. Tony eyed his breakfast. Although his stomach growled, he didn't think he'd be able to keep anything down. Not with Peter's distressed screams still ringing in the back of his head. He hadn't been able to eat more than a few bites here and there the past few days.
"Mute," Tony waved his hand. He had finished repairing his armor a few hours ago, but the workshop as a whole still needed a lot of work. Satisfied that all the broken glass had been swept up, he got to work on putting the furniture back upright. Once that was finished, he put his hands on his hips and looked around the room. Still so much to do. But he didn't regret a single thing.
"I TRUSTED YOU!!" Peter grabbed Bruce by the throat and flung him down the hall. The older man hit the wall with enough force to leave a Steve shaped dent.
"So, no one saw him?" Tony sighed. Steve was in the pilot's chair but hadn't started the engines yet. He turned the chair around to face his team.
"Don't! Your job is to get the weapons data. Focus on that, then worry about me," Steve instructed.
"That's why I'm the only one doing the snooping. You guys just keep on watching my back." Tony's armor whirred as he waved his hand.
"He needs a name."
Steve repeated inside his head.
"What else is new?" Tony frowned. "Here to arrest us again? Because we're kinda busy."
"So, this is the murder bot?" Clint poked at the robot's head. It was completely drained of power, Natasha having found it discarded in a ditch not far from Hammer's home.
Tony huffed, "I'm not worried about it, I'm just asking. I think I have a right to know who my son is dating."
"I was tortured too. They said they were going to cure my cancer. Not exactly the cure I wanted, but you know..." Deadpool motioned to his face. Everyone on the team had seen Deadpool without his mask, but few could stomach looking at him.
"I have a feeling something bad is about to happen. Something really bad," Iron Man put down the screwdriver he had been holding. "If something happens to me when we're out on the field-"
"I...yes. For once, I actually am."
Meanwhile, Iron Man dropped down the trap door, landing with a heavy metallic clang. War Machine landed next to him with an even heavier thud.
Alien army invading New York?
Pepper took a deep, shaky breath. "You...you are human. You were born a human, and you will always be a human! Your brain is still made of tissue, and your heart is still beating."
Osborn's smile vanished, "you either are or you aren't."
"No. I'm just here to stop you. Any means necessary." Spider-man lunged at her. Wanda waved her arms, shooting blasts of energy at him. He used his spider sense to dodge and met her attacks with his own. The building rumbled again. "We should probably take this outside." Peter kicked her in the gut, sending her flying back. She caught herself and flew back at him, hitting him with a huge blast of energy. Spider-man was thrown through the wall and slammed into the lockers on the other side of the hallway. "O-or not."
"Tony. We've only been jogging for half an hour."
"I'm on my way!" Tony yelled.
"Doesn't matter. He's a robot. Sure, he can think for himself, but he doesn't have an ounce of humanity in him. I could never love someone like him."
"I don't know. Just...I don't know." Iron Man sobbed, "I don't know anymore."
"Yup," Bucky poked his head back into the living room. "He told me about it this morning after he calmed down a bit."
Steve pointed towards the other side of the room. "I hit him with the shield and he went flying that way." Tony followed where he was pointing. He could just barely make out a dark shadow in the fire. A shadow was quickly moving towards them. "He's coming back! Can you fight?!" Steve hauled Tony to his feet.
"What the hell? Who are you?!" Spider-man took a defensive stance.
"I didn't want you to make a big deal about it."
"Steve, please, I can explain," Tony waved his hands frantically. "Please, give me another chance!"
(See the end of the chapter for
The way Tony spoke sent shivers down Peter's spine. He sounded like he was giving a speech at a funeral. The man clearly hadn't slept in awhile. There were dark circles under his eyes, and although his suit was as pristine as ever, his hair was a complete wreck. Tony paused and slipped on a pair of blue tinted shades. He cleared his throat and continued. "
"They've been messing with my head...I don't know what they want from me but I'm not going back on that operating table."
"Tony, promise me you won't kill it," Steve said sternly.
"Who?"
"That bastard," Steve spat. Iron Man flinched. "Sorry, I don't mean to disrespect your creator. But just because he made you with only one purpose in mind, doesn't mean you can't go beyond that. You didn't stick with the look he gave you, so why do you have to stick with any of his other plans? Heck, you already have a family that loves you. Why won't you let yourself be with someone special?" Steve shifted closer to him.
Clint paled, eyes flicking to the faded blue glow in the center of Tony's shirt. "Stark...get off the horse. We need to fix that thing before...just before. Yeah."
"People are looking for you," Pepper leaned in the doorway, arms crossed over her chest. Of course, she knew how to get into Tony's secret room. It had been necessary early on when he was still recovering and needed someone to bring him food and medication.
"It was here the whole time?!" Sam's eyes practically popped out of his head. "One of the most dangerous weapons of all-time, and he hid it in a fucking toy? Under our roof?! How did Peter even get that?!"
"This is actually about Spider-man. He's not exactly in the position to text anyone at the moment," Steve explained.
"I guess..." Peter kept his head down, hiding a blush.
"Play nice, both of you," Steve ordered.
"But the semi-"
"It's quiet," Natasha commented. Pale gray light filtered in through the large windows. The only real light in the room came from the flashing red and green bulbs of the Christmas tree. "It wasn't this quite last year."
Steve put his hands on his hips, glowering down at the robot, "what the hell has gotten into you?"
"Yup. C'mere. I'm not going to hurt you," Tony assured him. "I just want to help." Peter slowly crawled towards his father, who wrapped him in a tight hug once he was at arm's length. The symbiote brushed against Tony but didn't latch onto him. "I gotcha, kiddo. Everything's going to be okay now." Peter rested his face against the cold chest plate. The voice in his head had gone quiet.
Tony lowered his faceplate and asked FRIDAY to show him the suit's security footage from last night. "This suit hasn't left the Quinjet until now."
"What if there's nothing left to find?" Steve whispered.
"Alive," Iron Man glanced his way. Part of his faceplate was gone, revealing the cybernetic eye and part of his facial prosthetic. He shot through the air, body slamming a bot that had been about to attack Captain America. They went through the window and rolled down the cliffside. Iron Man smashed the bots head into the rocks and flew back up into the house.
Now, back to our regularly scheduled shitshow.
"I always give the kid a hard time. Someone has too," Joe grunted.
"Or something..." Toomes smirked. Wanda had told him about Peter's memory loss. This was going to be fun...
The disappointment was clear on Steve's face as he watched one of his closest friends walk out. "Play the recording, Buck."
"Don't you dare die on me, you...you jerk! WAKE UP!!"
"Where are we going?"
"It started...speaking...last week when I hurt Tony. It told me he killed Aunt May."
"Stark killed my family," Wanda spat, not taking her eyes off the battle below. Spider-man had just entered the fight. The extra limbs on the back of his suit helped him to maneuver around the Hulk as he shot webbing. "Why should Stark get to have a family?" She flicked her hands again, shooting a ball of red energy right at Spider-man. It struck him in the head causing him to freeze. The Hulk raised his fists, about to bring them down on the lanky teen.
"Hey!" Tony barked when Peter pelted him with a cookie.
Steve caught a glimpse of Iron Man ducking low to the ground, right before he vanished into the hillside. "Alright, Avengers. Let's wrap this up!"
"Yes, Captain Rogers. There is plenty more information. However, you do not have clearance to view them."
"In the flesh. Well, titanium. You get it." Tony set Clint down on the neighboring building. "Stop falling from high places."
"I like Bucky, he's cool," Peter chirped.
Steve laughed, the sound warmed Tony's heart.
Spider-man thrashed under Bruce's weight. "Haven't you guys fucked with me enough?! You've cut me open, changed my biology, sewed my fucking mouth shut-" Peter's voice cracked. "I-I'm not your play thing! You can't just mold me to your liking! That's what play-doh is for-"
After about an hour of nonsense, Peter parked the car and let Tony take over.
"Someone has to knock some sense into that guy!" Bucky stabbed the cereal with a spoon.
Peter groaned as he slowly regained consciousness. His eyes burned and his head throbbed. At least he wasn't twitching anymore or slobbering everywhere. He had been in and out of consciousness all morning. He became aware of the ache in his shoulders. Most likely caused by the way his arms were chained above his head. He knelt on the concrete floor, the cold making his knees go numb.
"If you wanted me dead you could've just said so," Tony huffed. Steve chuckled. Iron Man had never been particularly fond of sparring sessions, preferring to train alone. Unless Bucky was his sparring partner. That was the one person Iron Man was always ready to fight with. Bucky had been the one to come to Steve, voicing his worries about Tony relying too much on the armor, and that he needed to learn proper hand to hand combat. Natasha and Steve had spent the better part of the day trading Tony between them, teaching him what they know. At least, they said they were teaching him. Tony was convinced they were just taking turns kicking his assÂ and made that very clear to his two teachers. That just made them work him even harder. Looking at Tony now, Steve could tell the cyborg was exhausted.
Peter laid down on the other bed, curling into a tight ball with his back to everyone. Natasha moved to his side and pet his hair comfortingly. The pain medicine they had wasn't strong enough for Peter's metabolism. Peter was doing his best to hide the pain, but Natasha saw right through him.
"Don't compare yourself to a roach. It's disrespectful to them."
"You've barely eaten all week."
It was still early in the morning. By the time everyone woke Peter would be long gone. He opened the window and was met with a cold breeze. Spider-man shivered and decided to put on his jacket. He sat on the windowsill for another minute, looking out over the facility. The sun hadn't quite risen, the sky a pale gray. A light dusting of frost covered the ground.
"Well, look who it is!" Bucky's metal hand clanged against Tony's helmet. He plopped down on the other side of Steve. Tony wasn't all that surprised to see the assasin. Bucky was still getting used to living with so many people and hardly left Steve's side. "Where have you been?"
"We were hoping you knew," Clint frowned. "I think you were the last to see him. Stane didn't bring him along with you?"
Henry crawled up Thor and sat on his shoulder. "Why, hello, small being. What brings you to my shoulder?"
Peter sat up abruptly, ripping the leather straps off his body.
"Suicidal...?" Clint paled.
"Then sleep," Iron Man flopped down beside Steve, half of his body still on top of him. Steve shoved him the rest of the way off. Iron Man rolled onto his back, his head turned to look at his friend.
"NO." Peter tried to escape through a vent, unfortunately, FRIDAY locked the grate firmly into place. Thor grabbed him by the ankle, trying to pull him down, but Peter remained stuck to the wall. He kicked the god in the face with his other foot and darted across the ceiling.
"Pete?"
"Stark! Stark! What happened?!" Natasha hovered over him. "Are you hurt?! Where's Steve?!"
"You sure?"
"Like I said, we're not dating. But I'm will go check on him," Steve left the room before Bucky or Rhodes could stop him. The two exchanged another look. The Captain shouldn't be able to get past the heavy locked doors. But there was nothing on this earth that could stop Captain America's pure determination.
"Don't you get it, Peter?" Bruce spoke again, "you can't trust these people. They've done nothing but hurt you."
Spider-man sat at the head of the table, between his father and Steve. This was not where he usually sat, his proper place being next to Clint at the other end of the table. Only Captain America or Iron Man sat at the head of the table. He shifted around anxiously, wondering if he was in trouble.
"I need your help! SHIELD is after me! They think-ARGH!!" An anti-aircraft gun blasted Tony out of the sky before he could finish. He crashed with a boom, the pavement cracking under him. Tony's vision swam for a moment. He then realized how dangerously close he was to the edge. The ocean churned far below, the storm wreaking havoc on the waves.
"Save them," Pepper whispered.
Bucky shrugged. "You got captured. We've all been there. I know there wasn't much you could do about it." He undid his short ponytail, allowing his hair to be ruffled by the breeze. "Iron Man loves you." Bucky said suddenly, then added, "he probably would've burned down the entire world if that's what it took to find you."
"Go away," Iron Man's voice came through the speaker by the door.
"Tony?" Steve was suddenly on the other side of him. He was vaguely aware of the two Avengers guiding him to a chair in the waiting room.
"Obadiah was just one part of a larger conspiracy against me. It was pure luck that he didn't tell anyone else the truth about me. But my body was still healing. I was vulnerable. The Mark three was strong but it couldn't protect me from everything. If people had found out that I was alive, then there's no telling what could have happened to me. There were attempts on Iron Man's life. By people who didn't think Tony Stark's death was enough. After two years though, the attempts on my life stopped, and the world saw me as a hero. I didn't want to have to keep looking over my shoulder, so I decided to stay in hiding. Besides, I was doing much more good as Iron Man than I ever could as Tony Stark. The world was happy Tony Stark was dead. And Iron Man was my chance to start fresh," Tony finished.
Iron Man was
"I don't think I'll be buying you a beer again anytime soon," Tony moved cautiously through the halls.
Rhodey suddenly landed next to Tony, the noise he made when he landed caused Tony to flinch. "Hulk's gone, Banner got away...what the hell happened to you guys?"
"We should watch 'Big Ass Spider'," Natasha suggested out of nowhere.
"Wanda!" Peter ran towards her, "you have to stop this! People are going to die!" It was no secret that she was the one who started the fire. Peter didn't know why. And honestly, he didn't want to. He just wanted it to end before someone got hurt.
Steve held up his hand and shook his hand, "don't. You'll just give them both more juice." Thor reluctantly lowered his hammer. Steve looked away when Iron Man's right arm was sliced off by a laser. Iron Man didn't seem to notice and kept fighting.
He had created Iron Man to save the world, and now that creation was going to be used to destroy it. Tony screamed inside his helmet, letting out all of his pent-up frustration.
"Did you ask him about the experimentation on his own child?"
Rhodes raised an eyebrow, "I'm surprised. You seemed pretty pissed at him..."
"Did you kill Aunt May?" Peter whispered, looking over at Tony.
"Any vial from the second row should work," FRIDAY reported. "Use the entire contents of whichever vial you choose."
"No buts. Just hugs. Okay?" Steve tucked his head under Iron Man's chin.
Steve didn't say anything.
Was Steve looking for him? Where any of the Avengers? Did they know he was in trouble? Or did they just assume he had died on his mission? He made it clear in his message to Bucky that he didn't think he would make it home. God. He wanted to go home. He wanted to go home so badly it hurt. He wanted to sit with his team in the living room, playing board games and watching shitty movies. He wanted to go out to lunch with Bucky again. Spar with Natasha. Pull pranks with Clint. Conduct science experiments with Bruce. Chat with Thor about the wonders of technology. Watch baseball with Sam. Have a beer with Rhodey. He wanted to be held in Steve's arms again. Wanted to fight at his side during missions. And then come home exhausted, the two of them collapsing onto the couch in the workshop for a brief nap before Steve broke out his sketchbook and Iron Man went about his repairs. Steve would smile at him, and Tony would smile back, even though Steve couldn't see it.
"Pepper!" Tony called.
"No thank you! Activate Not Today Protocol, Codeword Clint's Hearing Aid 409 AA 7-04!"
"You're lying," Natasha moved closer to Peter. She had been furious when she heard someone had sewn his mouth shut. Whoever did that to her little spider was going to pay with their life.
"Mr. Stark, nice of you to drop by. If you wanted a tour of the building, you could have just asked," Osborn smiled. "No need to go snooping through my labs."
"I have two dads?! That's awesome!" A big smile broke out across his face.
"He trusted us enough to reveal himself," Steve argued. "Both parties are at fault here. I believe listening to Tony's message is the first step to making things right."
"We won't."
Tony flinched at the thought of Steve getting angry.
Tony was at his side in an instant, stroking his hair and speaking softly. "Hey, kid. Welcome back to the world of the living."
"Use your head for once, Peter. If we kill them, then we'll have the whole world after our heads. But if we show them that the Avengers are the enemy, everyone will be begging us to take them down," Wanda explained as if it were obvious.
Kraven chuckled as he stood up and checked the chains holding Spider-man in place. "You'll learn to appreciate art."
Once back at the compound, he stripped himself of his uniform. He was about to throw it in the laundry basket when he noticed the dark liquid on the sleeve. The liquid looked black against the navy blue fabric, but there was a slight reddish-brown hue to it. Steve felt sick looking at it. He didn't want to think about what kind of oil could have been spilling out of his friend's battered body. He shoved the shirt into the basket and didn't look back.
"We'll be arrested too if we're caught aiding a fugitive. We'll all get sent to the Raft and that will be the end of the Avengers."
"NONONONONONO...NO...nono...no...n..." Peter went limp.
"I don't know anything about this stuff," Steve shook his head.
"Iron Man!" Steve called. "Listen, we're on your side!"
"You...MURDERER!!" Spider-man grabbed the barrel and yanked back, crashing the gun into her face. He heard the satisfying crack of a broken nose and Wanda shrieking. Spider-man took the gun and ran. He had to put this right. He had to save those still trapped by the fire. He had to help the Avengers.
"You want to tell me why you're back in your pajamas?" Tony held up his phone, showing a blurry photo of Peter in his homemade costume.
"Friday! I told you not to tell anyone!" Spidey shook his fist at the AI in the ceiling.
"How many of these things could there possibly be?!" Pepper used her own uni-beam to take out a few.
Peter let the sign fall backward and ran forward before he was crushed.
Tony gulped, "maybe?"
"No. You're not." Spider-man cut him off. "Queens is my turf. I know it better than any of you. And I know how the enemy thinks. I'm leading this mission. If you guys are going to be a part of this, then you need to go where I tell you to go and unleash hell when I tell you to. No questions asked." Spider-man punched a bunch of buttons on the dashboard, getting the jet airborne in a matter of seconds. Steve's mouth hung open, not expecting the web slinger to speak to him like that.
"This is all my fault..." Steve dropped his head onto the table. Natasha rubbed a soothing hand on his back. "I pushed him away." What really bothered Steve, was that they still didn't know exactly what Tony had experienced. 'Medical experimentation' is a broad term. Tony clearly wasn't thinking straight. Had they done something to his head? Or was the emotional distress clouding his judgment? If he had stopped Tony from walking out that day, then none of this would have happened.
"It was for his own protection."
Peter chuckled, "I know what you mean."
"You created Spider-man."
"Bossy, bossy. Hang onto your asses. This is going to be-"
"A bird shit on me this morning," Peter shifted his phone to the other ear and went about messing with his web shooter. The actual web spinners in his arms ached from disuse, but he ignored it.
A high pitched ringing noise split through the air. Peter winced, his already sensitive ears feeling like they were going to bleed. The symbiote shrieked in agony, quickly melting away into nothing but a puddle of black sludge.
"No," Tony glared at the mug in his hands. "He's in love with Iron Man, who is indeed a robot. But Tony Stark, the fucked up cyborg hiding inside him? No. He could never love that person."
Tony sighed in relief.
"I can bring your tools here. Pepper won't mind."
Tony nodded silently, staring blankly at the ceiling. "It felt so real."
"Ah, Peter. Such a bright young man. I miss him the most. He didn't treat me like a nuclear meltdown waiting to happen. And we had so many fun conversations about science. I didn't expect to care for the kid as much as I did. I don't think any of the Avengers did. Funny how things turn out."
"We've been over this, Stark. We have no way to find them and Peter isn't going to come to us willingly. We can't do anything until they make their next play." Steve handed Tony his sandwich.
Tony turned to face him. Sparks shot out of various areas of his badly damaged suit. His helmet was completely gone, a deep gash cutting across his forehead. The chest plate was battered to high hell, with dents in it that had surely broken the fragile bones beneath.
"He can't understand you. Let it go, Tony." Natasha sighed.
War Machine snacked his arm down, the sudden movement shocked Stark and caused him to fire a shot. The man shrieked when the ground exploded just inches away from his arm. "You need to calm down," Rhodey said to his friend.
"So what happens to me?"
Tony set the donut box down on the desk. "A girlfriend...wow. And I thought you were gay. You and Ned were really close for awhile-"
"Speaking of which..." Tony took out his phone.
"So, I have a new idea for how to get even with Sam," Clint smirked.
When Tony revealed himself, the tension in the air was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Everyone had a short fuse. There was a lot of yelling in the two weeks leading up to Tony's disappearance. It was the wrong kind of sound, but at least there was sound. Then Tony went missing and it was as if all life had been sucked out of the building. Things just fell...quiet. People would be upbeat and energetic during missions, but as soon as the team returned home, all that energy vanished. No one wanted to admit they missed the cyborg. No one wanted to admit that Iron Man had been the heart of their team. Or that they had made a mistake by pushing him away. It made Natasha's blood boil, the way certain people wanted him gone, up until he actually left, and suddenly they weren't okay with him leaving. But did they help with search efforts? No. Of course not. Cause no one was willing to remove the sticks from their asses.
Sam's expression softened, "I was just asking. You've been really distant since you came home. We're still friends, right?"
"Fine. I don't feel like arguing with you, Stark. I'm going with the others to help Clint." Steve headed back over to the group. Tony watched his team vanish into the woods, then he continued his search. He wasn't able to find his bag, but he did find the remnants of an Iron Man gauntlet, its repulsor still in tact. Tony slipped it onto his hand and stuffed his pockets with more spare parts he stumbled upon. The engineer zipped his jacket up all the way, hiding the fading light in his chest. His bag was long gone. As was the spare arc reactor. Just like all their other valuable weapons. Tony scanned the clearing one last time before going off in the direction his team had wandered.
"Thanks, buddy," Steve smiled at the soft-spoken scientist.
"Who?"
"Fine," Iron Man bowed his head.
"You said that. Why? Tell them I'm re-charging," Tony didn't move.
"No, I'm not mad. Just try not to be so reckless next time-" Tony paused, "yes, I know you're reckless by nature. That's not an excuse-" another pause. This one slightly longer, "Peter, you can't just, Peter. Peter. Listen to me. Kid. Ugh. Fine. Just bring the suit down to the lab when you get home. Yes, I know you are capable of fixing it, I just want to-" Tony cut himself off, just now noticing the soldier staring at him. "I'll call you back." Tony hung up and stuffed the phone in his back pocket. "Morning, Cap."
"He's a living weapon. He's said so himself on multiple occasions," Fury reminded them. "Iron Man is known to disobey orders, despite his so-called "programming" saying that that isn't possible. Not to mention the head trauma he received six months ago. Colonel Rhodes refuses to release a statement about the extent of the damage, but he did say a few wires came lose, and that they had trouble piecing you back together," Fury's glare landed on Iron Man once more. "Even Captain Rogers has said that you've been acting differently since then. I can pull up his reports to prove it."
Peter gulped. "Is there a third option?"
you going to do it?" Steve whispered to Tony. Tony glanced over his shoulder at Peter, who was sitting on top of a workbench with Michelle. The two were whispering to each other, their heads leaning against one another. The symbiote had solidified, turning his costume completely black, except for the white of his lenses. It looked like it was trying to form a white spider on his chest, but the design was different each time someone looked at it. Tony had been pacing the lab, gathering supplies for the past hour. Steve was a little concerned that Tony didn't really know what he was doing, considering he kept changing his mind about certain tools and kept asking FRIDAY for a second opinion.
"I can't."
"No. Iron Man was like a brother to me. Now Iron Man is dead."
"I'm not having this conversation at eight in the morning," Tony grabbed a coffee mug from the cupboard, slamming the door shut. "I'm in too deep to back out now. Six years too deep."
Iron Man went back to the computer. "Let's see what we can do about that," he got to work on typing in lines of code. "These people are smart enough to hide files from me, but not smart enough to upgrade from windows 98? Jesus, Christ." Tony shook his head in disbelief. It took a minute, but Tony did get the files unlocked. "Wait. Hang on...these aren't weapon plans..."
"Very well, Spider. Fight me all you like. You will be coming with me when this is all over, either way."
"Did what?" Steve asked.
"I think he's gone," Ned spoke up.
"We're all fine," Steve reported.
"Good," Happy stood up. He patted down the front of his shirt, making sure he looked presentable. "I look forward to it." He gave Peter one last smile before wandering off.
." He stomped on Iron Man's head. Steve wanted to scream. Wanted to fling himself at Obadiah, rip him apart. Make him hurt for daring to even look at Anthony.
"It was a long time ago. Don't worry about it." Iron Man pat Steve on the back.
"Where are we?" A wave of nausea swept over Steve as he sat up, and he had to hold his head in his hands.
"My spider sense is telling me not to trust you, Stark."
Upon hearing that, the Avengers bolted to the workshop, practically tripping over one another. They found Tony lying on his side. He wasn't moving.
"C'mon, man," Sam pleaded. "You can't just say you have an actual face and not show it to us!"
Iron Man shook his head, "they said they were Obadiah."
"It's one in the afternoon."
"You need exercise. And I need fresh air. So we're going for a walk," Natasha started for the door. Peter hesitated before following her. A lap around the Avenger's personal floor couldn't hurt. Although he was surprised to see Natasha heading for the elevator.
"I need to convince some people that he is in my possession and that I will kill him if they don't give me what I want," Osborn replied.
A scream sliced through the cold night air, instantly waking Steve, who jumped up and raced towards the sound. The Avenger found Stark doubled over in the kitchen.
"Bucky?" Tony's voice came through.
Tony fell silent.
"Tough," War Machine stepped half in front of Iron Man. "What do you want, Stane?"
"Thanks, Winghead."
"You look a lot like him," Steve commented, pointing at Richard. The older Peter got, the more and more he looked like his father. But he was also becoming more like Tony, which Steve always found amusing.
"Mr. Parker is no longer in the building." The AI reported.
"We're done, Tony. Deal with it."
Tony Stark, so that was to be expected. I'll return Peter's body to you when I'm done with it. Let you bury him with his real parents. Least I can do."
"Excuse me, that's my news to share." Tony held up a finger.
Tony woke up several hours later, which pissed him off because he only meant to sleep for twenty minutes. Maybe thirty. He stood and stretched, mentally cycling through the list of what still needed to be done. He looked down at Peter, who was still fast asleep. Tony sighed and tucked a blanket around the kid.
"Things were different last year," Steve reminded her.
"Physically, yes. You're fine. But mentally? Tony, what you experienced was extremely traumatic. You shouldn't be pushing yourself like this."
"I am more than capable of taking care of myself. I really need my bag. Just give me five minutes." Tony started digging more frantically.
"No, you're not." The gun was pressed harder into his jaw. Peter gulped.
"He thinks you hate him."
"Damn. Don't know why I expected everything to still be the same after six years," Bucky leaned his head against the door, letting his hair fly out the open window. "Can you go over the current Avengers again?"
"Why don't we play 'cards against humanity'?" Natasha suggested.
"He's a robot. That's why not!"
Steve looked the robot, having not been able to spot the subtle changes when he had been flying. There was more red on him, darker, almost maroon in shade. What looked like tiny arc reactors were all over his body. Two in his rib cage, a pair where the chest plate met the shoulders. Another pair on his hips. A few more on his legs and arms. Iron Man rolled his shoulders, causing small plates to slide over the tiny lights, hiding them from Steve's gaze.
"Of course you wouldn't. That's what this microchip is for. It'll give you a helpful nudge in the right direction."
"I don't know what you think you saw. Or what Peter told you. But he was never here last night. Now. Please leave the premises."
"Not like that."
"Busy? With what? Brooding over the city?"
"It's like 75% your fault," Peter retorted.
Peter frowned, subconsciously scratching the inside of his forearm. The organic web spinners were long gone, thanks to the combined efforts of Tony and Doctor Strange. But the scars remained. Both physical and mental. "What do you mean?"
"Yeah." Tony climbed back into the suit. "I don't think Peter will be coming back to the tower anytime soon. I'll keep an eye on him, but for now, just let him be."
"What you need is to focus on someone who isn't yourself for once."
"I find that hard to believe as well," Clint chuckled.
"I'll go get him!" Clint jumped up.
"He won't make it. Finish the job."
"With a robot? That'll just be depressing," Clint laughed.
"You've said that. A few times." Tony turned him around and slipped a bright red tie around his neck. Peter reached up to tie it, but Tony slapped his hands and tied it himself. "There you go," he tucked the end into Peter's jacket.
One by one, Peter's memories were stolen away. His most prominent ones were the first to go. Him and Clint hiding in the vents, watching their latest prank unfold. Natasha giving him dating advice right after sneaking him into a bar. Listening to old records with Sam on lazy Sunday mornings. Playing baseball with Rhodey and Steve. Playing chess with the Vision, determined to win even though it was impossible. That one time Happy had picked him up from school early so they could get ice cream. Going to the zoo with Thor, who was convinced giraffes were fake and needed solid visual proof of their existence. Tony putting the Iron Man helmet on Peter while they worked together in the lab, commenting on how it made Peter look like a bobble head. Aunt May hugging him goodbye the morning she was killed by a drunk driver. Sitting at the lunch table with Ned and Michelle, talking about...what were they talking about? Peter couldn't remember. The memory was ripped from his grasp before he could finish processing it.
Spider-man stared at him, his lenses going back to their normal size.
"Stark tried to remove your organic webbing," Bruce explained. "hopefully he didn't damage your spinners too badly...I did what I could to fix them."
Peter straightened up. "Have we met before?"
"You were missing for two days." Iron Man whispered. "Scared the shit out of me. God, Steve, I don't know what I'd do if you...if you had..." He tightened his grip on Steve's hands. "If you died, I would've kicked your ass."
"Switch with me," Clint demanded, "if another old lady hits me with her purse I'm going to scream."
"Then stay here and keep your head down," Steve ordered. A repulsor blast took out part of the breakfast bar.
"What if Peter had used his powers against us? You could've created a super villain," Steve fumed.
"Mind your business," Peter snapped. "It's just stuff for Henry." The wall crawler was visibly shaking, looking like he might fall from the ceiling at any moment. "You scared the shit outta me." Everything was starting to become hazy. His spider sense pounding in the back of his head. Pure fear suddenly gripped his heart and he felt his entire body go numb.
"I will...hang on." Peter noticed Tony walking into the kitchen and went after him. "Hey, dad-"
"Thought you'd gone home. Whatcha doing?" Steve walked calmly over to him.
The dragon was now right behind him. Steve pressed his back to the door and raised his shield. Black smoke billowed out of the dragon's mouth. The orange light was back. The shield wouldn't be enough to save Steve. But there was nowhere left for him to run.
As he worked on rewriting his own code, he thought about who his first target should be. Hawkeye? Weakest human among them. Seems like the logical choice.
"I'm calling for backup," Iron Man announced.
And then, of course, the most obvious. Iron Man's ability to feel pain. Both physical and emotional.
"Fucking shit on a stick!"
Blood oozed from the bullet wound in Peter's thigh. The teen trembled, tears welling up in his eyes. He looked back up at the camera and said something too quiet to hear.
"He experimented on my child. Tortured him. I want that man on death row." Tony's voice dripped with venom.
"Okay," Steve kicked open the door like it was nothing. Michelle yelped and grabbed the closest object, a pair of scissors. She pointed it at them, eyes blazing with determination.
"Better question, what are you doing here?" Tony frowned under the helmet.
To protect. Not to use against.
Steve put a steady hand on his shoulder. "Stark-" Tony smacked his hand away and scrambled backward, pressing himself against the wall. Steve clenched his jaw. He had never seen Tony so afraid. No, come to think of it there was one time he had seen Tony afraid. Tony had had a panic attack in his lab two weeks ago. Steve had seen the tail end of it. Tony clearly didn't want to talk about it at the time, so Steve had forgotten about it until now. "Tony?" The engineer flinched at the sound of his name. His eyes flicked in Steve's direction. Recognition sparked in them and Tony allowed himself to relax. "Are you okay?"
"How did he break your spell?" Bruce demanded.
"Told you he's not okay..." Rhodey put his face in his hands.
"This doesn't make any sense." Fury frowned from the other side of the two-way mirror. After being questioned for several hours, Stark was now alone in the interrogation room.
"I want to die."
One of the bots came up behind Tony and grabbed him. Tony shot into the air, crashing through the ceiling and climbing into the sky.
"I'm going to stop you right there." Steve held up a hand.
"I'm sure." Peter landed a kick right at Wanda's back. She used her magic to keep herself upright and tossed Peter away. Peter quickly regained his footing and ran back at her. Iron Man watched them fight for a moment longer before blasting off.
They stared at one another for a moment before Clint punched his arm. "What about Sam?"
"Questions later. Destroy the armor!" Tony rushed at Ultron. The Avengers followed his lead.
The engineer nodded and hurried back over to the wrecked jet, with Thor not far behind. Tony stumbled through the debris, searching for the small red box. "I can't find it!"
Spider-man threw his hands in the air, "I'm not here to fight!"
"Why did you do it?" Harry looked over at Peter with puffy eyes. "Why did you kill him?"
!" Steve called. "You need to breathe!" Steve shook him aggressively, panicked by the way Tony had suddenly gone into shock.
(See the end of the chapter for
Wanda bunched up her fists in anger. Going out with a smile on his face? This was not how Tony Stark was supposed to die. Maybe she needed something more than brute force to truly break Stark?
"Peter Benjamin Parker-Stark, you come home right this instant." Tony barked.
He drew an angry frowny face next to his name for good measure. Spider-man would have left a lot sooner if it hadn't been for Tony watching him like a hawk. Not to mention it wouldn't have been smart to go after a supervillain with his injuries. According to FRIDAY, he was now back to perfect health.
"He's not gone. You said it yourself, he still has his snarky attitude. So he's still Jarvis," Steve reasoned with him. "You got him back. That's what matters, right? You can build new memories with him."
Iron Man's hand twitched, but he made no move to get back up. Captain America rushed over to take Iron Man's place, guarding Spidey as if his life depended on it.
"Not exactly," Peter bit his lip.
Iron Man rocketed through the clouds, firing repulsors, missiles, bullets, anything and everything he had on his person. The bots put up one hell of a fight, but they stood no chance against Tony Stark. This was his last mission, and he was giving his all. He hadn't fought this hard since the battle of New York. And now his armor was more advanced than it had been back then. Nothing could stand in his way. No man. No robot. Obadiah was going down. Even if it cost Tony his life.
"We'll call you. Tell Laura and the kids I said 'hi'."
"Yup. He's been using your phone to call Tony. But the calls keep dropping whenever Tony picks up." Steve shrugged.
Steve took a seat next to her and took a long sip of his own hot chocolate. It was Christmas morning, and the only people in the compound besides them were Bucky and Bruce. Everyone else had gone to see their loved ones. Thor had left two weeks ago to spend time with Jane and her family, and wouldn't be back until after the new year. Which was a surprise to Natasha, who had assumed Thor and Bruce were a couple, based on how close the two were.
"What would you do if I was human?"
"When has that ever stopped me before?"
Wanda blasted him back with a flick of her wrist. "I need you to work with me here, Petey. If you want to help end this, follow me." She walked off into the smoke. Spider-man hurried after her. He skipped to a stop when he saw her standing in front of a man. His legs were trapped under debris, reaching out to Wanda, crying for help. Spider-man rushed over and lifted the debris off.
Tony saw red.
Natasha made a grab for the camera, but the person jumped back.
"Never felt pain before. But I do have Artifical nerves. Deep down." Iron Man choked out. "Deep deep down. Meant to detect internal damage. S-something's wrong. I've never felt like this before. Oh FUCK, please call Rhodey!" Tony hadn't felt this much pain since half his body was blown up. He was conscious enough to make up an answer but too far gone to pinpoint where the pain was coming from. It felt like his entire body was on fire.
"You're Peter's friend. We need you to talk to him. Find out everything he remembers about the people who attacked him. And I mean everything," Tony explained. "Once we figure out who these guys are, you can plan our next moves."
"Good question," Peter smirked, "have a cookie."
Steve stiffened. "If you had let him be, then who would've taken him in when his aunt was killed? If he lived that long. The suit you made him has saved his life on many occasions."
"Dad-"
"Sssssquish the sssspider!" Venom hissed.
Natasha's head snapped in Steve's direction. The mug he had been holding was now in pieces, the hot chocolate dripping from his fingers. "I should've told you as soon as I found out, but the Hulk had other plans..." Bruce trailed off.
"You're a child. A lost child who doesn't know what's best."
Tony sighed, "you know how complicated things were between the Avengers and SHIELD and all the other madness that was going on. C'mon, let's just do it. Then, just the three of us could go out to lunch."
"Peter." Steve gave his son a warning look.
"Already doing so, sir," Jarvis reported. "Most of the comms appear to be offline. But I believe I may have found Captain Roger's location. Give me one moment."
"Dude, Pete's like, what, 23? If he wants to have a pet, he can have a pet," Clint stood up for the youngest Avenger. "Besides, he needed one anyway."
"I just did," Natasha knelt down next to them, putting a hand on Iron Man's knee. "He's on his way. Just hold on. Where does it hurt?"
"Boy, Iron Man is gonna flip when he sees you!" Sam said.
Tony burst into the room that the heat signature had been in, but it was empty. "What about the Hulk?"
"What's going on?" Tony drifted over to them, noticing the concerned looks on their faces.
"Goodnight, Clint," Peter repeated, laying down and pulling the covers over his head.
"Ugh..." Spider-man rolled onto his hands and knees, pressing his forehead into the floor. The ringing in his ears was enough to make him pass out. Looking over, he saw Iron Man sitting no more than five feet away from him. "YOU!!" Spider-man ignored the pounding in his head and attacked Iron Man. Tony yelped in surprise and tried to get air born, but one of Spidey's extra limbs stabbed his boot, destroying the thruster within. Tony ducked out of a punch just in time. The ground where his head had just been made an awful crunching sound. He shoved both hands into Peter's chest and blasted him several feet back. Peter threw out a hand, catching himself on the floor before he was knocked too far back.
"Maybe you shouldn't handle explosives with your bare hands?" Spider-man shrugged. Osborn was reaching for another bomb. Spider-man ran forward to stop him and once again the two became locked in battle.
"Vision. I asked him what happened to the Hulk and he spilled the beans," Deadpool shrugged. "He says everyone else wanted to kill Banner. Even the Vision himself. But you showed him mercy. That's the real reason why they chose you to be the leader of the Avengers, isn't it? Because you're the only good person out of all of us."
"Tony? Tony, we've been looking everywhere for you. Are you alright?" Steve tightened his grip on the phone. Bucky shifted from foot to foot nervously. At this point, Natasha and Bruce had made their way over. Natasha moved closer to Steve, worry clouding her expression. "Sweetheart, talk to me."
Steve couldn't help but smile warmly at his boys. They were safe. And for now, they were happy. And that was more than enough for Steve. Tony straightened up and blew a kiss at Steve. Peter made a barfing noise.
"Of course, sir. File created."
"Huh?!" Tony started. He hadn't moved from his chair and still held his food in both hands. There was no corpse at his feet. He dropped his sandwich and hid his face in his hands, "it happened again...I killed him. Again."
"Damn bastards!" Iron Man's snarl was directed at the Hydra agents, not Bucky and Steve. It was just the three of them on a mission, raiding a Hydra facility that SHIELD had uncovered up north.
Steve panicked, his own hands clawing at the metal wrapped around his jugular. "T-Tony, w-wha...s-sto-stop!" He got a grip on the other man's fingers and pried them free. Oxygen had never felt so sweet. "I don't think you understand what "let's talk" means!"
"War Machine. The guy who's supposed to be keeping an eye on the hot mess behind you," War Machine snapped.
Tony's mouth snapped shut with an audible clack of his teeth. Any other time he would've reminded Cap about how he flew a nuke through a worm hole last month. Now he couldn't bring himself to form the words. They glared at each other for a minute before Steve spoke again.
"Well, come back inside until then." Sam motioned him in. The Captain was standing a bit away from the jet, using his shield as an umbrella. Steve was about to do as suggested when he heard the roar of repulsors. His face lit up at the sight of the Avengers' beloved robot flying towards them.
Thanks for reading!
"You used to. You probably won't remember them now. Their names are Otto and Adrian," Wanda explained. "I'm not as fond of them as you are, however, Stark has an army to back him up, so we're going to need all the help we can get."
Steve took a deep, shaky breath as he tried to push away the image of Iron Man's lifeless body lying in the sand.
"Mind wipe," Bruce said curtly. "You can rewrite his reality, can't you?"
Tony opened his mouth to answer but didn't know what to say. "Um...listen, Peter is in the hospital."
"I thought I did know you, but clearly I don't. Allow me to show you the last piece of evidence," he stepped out of the way of the screen.
"Why do you insist on speaking about such trivial things?" Doc Ock huffed. One of the tentacles wrapped around Peter's neck and hurled him into the ground.
Tony moved silently along the back wall of his lab. A man about Peter's age was rummaging through a set of drawers by a work bench. The man didn't find what he was looking for and started fumbling with the actual objects on the workbench. He had his back to Tony, allowing the older man to creep up behind him. Tony slipped a gauntlet on and aimed the repulsor at the back of his head. The man stilled at the sound of the repulsor powering up. "Lose something?"
"Nah, it's cool. But if you're going to do that then you should give me facial hair." Tony requested.
Steve took a deep breath. "That's the thing...Which way did you see him go, Sam?"
"His memories are gone," Tony sighed. "He's still just as snarky as before, but he doesn't remember anything. He didn't know his name. Or who I was. Or what he is. I told him everything he needs to know but it's just...not the same. Jarvis is gone."
"I'm creating a new AI system. Based on my brain patterns."
"Don't squish him," Steve teased.
"Tony Stark you are impossible," Pepper threw her hands in the air. "Steve loves you for you. He'd probably be over the moon if you told him you were a real human who could show him affection."
"You gave it to me. It's on your work bench. You could've come up here and gotten it at any point." Tony pocketed his phone. "Thought you were done being Spider-man?"
"Amnesia, huh?" Stephen scratched his head. Natasha, Steve, and Tony stood in the doorway to his sanctum. A small crowd had started to gather on the sidewalk, drawn in by the sight of the three Avengers. "Yeah, I should be able to do something about that. Where is he?" Tony pointed up. Stephen stuck his head out the door and looked up. Spider-man was perched on a window sill several stories up, staring down at them warily. "And he's up there because...?"
"We should go out tonight. Grab a drink, dance with some dolls," Bucky smiled, elbowing his friend in the ribs. "Or fellas. I'm leaning towards fellas today."
âI donât want to intrude,â Steve said quickly.
I hope you are enjoying the story thus far!
"Not until you let Peter go."
âWe do trust you,â Steveâs hand ghosted over Tonyâs back. âWe werenât lying at dinner when we said we forgave you.â
"Don't know. He was pissy for no reason yesterday. And now he's avoiding me." Peter motioned to Tony's empty work bench. The engineer always spent his mornings in the lab, especially if Peter was there with him. "Did I do something wrong?"
"Then, I'm going to have to ask you to leave." Harry cut him off.
"Where's Anthony?" Steve looked away from the bots.
"Is something wrong with your leg?" Natasha noticed the limp right away.
It was Natasha.
. Peter thought, his gut telling him that this was far from over.
"Oh, hey, MJ," Peter smiled, then passed out.
"Fuck. Where did you find this?"
"Wow. I love being a part of a soap opera." Clint commented, not bothering to open his eyes.
Iron Man landed next to Steve with a thud.
bed. Back at
"Baby steps," Bucky grinned, trying to look Tony in the eye despite the sunglasses.
The peace only lasted for a few minutes, when Steve started calling his name. Peter sighed and crawled back down the mountain.
"Where's the fire?" Clint joked when Fury and Maria's hill entered the room, several SHIELD agents following close behind. The agents positioned themselves at the doors and windows of the conference room, holding their guns over their chests.
Steve remained silent. His eyes were trained on another screen, watching Norman Osborn sprinting through the corridors. Suddenly all of the screens went to static.
Peter took the phone back out of his pocket. He skipped around the rest of Tony's speech. The rest wasn't all the interesting. Most of it was just a drawn out apology for destroying the city. Again. Peter scrolled through the related videos, wondering if any of the other Avengers had commented on the event. He clicked on one that showed a very upset Steve Rogers herding Tony Stark out of what looked like a bar. Tony had his back to the camera, but there was no mistaking that it was him. The date on the video showed that it was just one week after Wanda had been arrested.
"You tell 'em, babe!" Iron Man chirped.
The elf tilted his head, still not seeing the problem.
"What are you talking abou-" he was cut off by a loud pop, followed by the loud hum of Iron Man's rocket boots. The armored Avenger shot by overhead. "All this just to fight the Avengers?!" Spider-man whirled on Wanda, the rage clear in his voice. "This fight is between us and them! Leave the civilians out of it!"
"I know. But whoever was on the other side of that transmission threatened the Avengers. I'm going to put a stop to this before things get out of hand." Tony responded.
"Drama queen." Tony put his hands on his hips. A second snowball hit Tony in the face. "You little..." His eye twitched.
"Good question," Iron Man stood. He towered over Steve due to the stairs. "I think we should head back. Want a lift, spangles?"
"Day 12 with no panic attacks!" Peter reported, a big smile plastered on his face.
"Oh, I know," Steve smirked, shooting a look at Tony. "So you're bi?"
Spider-man shook his head and spoke slowly, "No. She's alive. Just unconscious. And in SHIELD custody. I think we should regroup." He looked up at the sound of Iron Man's repulsors. The armored Avenger was slowly drifting down. He cut the thrusters and dropped the remaining few feet with a loud thud.
"No. Was never asleep," Tony sat up and rubbed his eyes.
"Right away, sir." The AI said in its calm drawl.
"And it's not like I didn't go out in disguise when we lived in the tower. It was easier back then. And I don't wear the suit when I go to Malibu with Pepper-"
"The one and only," Tony answered, his blue eyes blazing with determination. "Just hang on, princess, I'm going to get you out of here."
"...yes..."
"I can't get a lock on him, boss. The explosion is messing with my sensors," FRIDAY apologized.
"I agree with this no longer being a safe place. But I think my reasoning differs from yours. Let me go, Cap."
"You do not have to suffer alone," Thor said softly. "I know of this PTSD. Although, on my world, we call it something different. You can talk to me. If you need to. Or want to. Up to you."
"Never do that again," Tony frowned. Rhodey did it again just to spite him.
Tony didn't say anything. He just slipped the band off his head and let it drop to the floor. It wasn't until he crushed it under his foot that Steve let out a sigh of relief.
"I am now," Tony whispered, cupping Peter's face with one hand and brushing his thumb over his cheek. Steve nodded and left without another word. Tony gently pulled the blanket away from one of Peter's arms. No web shooter. Tony eased the glove off his hand, his shoulders sagging upon seeing the scar. He looked back up at Peter's face. Tiny scars danced unevenly around his mouth. So small that the average person wouldn't notice them. But Tony wasn't the average person. He distinctively remembered that part of the thread had ripped through Peter's lips when he had attempted to speak. A long scar marked where that had happened, slicing right through the side of his mouth. "I'm going to make them pay, Peter. I promise."
Peter hummed. He still had no idea how they were going to do it, but hearing Tony say he would work on it put Peter's mind at ease. "Okay, thanks, dad." Peter closed his eyes and drifted off.
"Yeah, Tony really has his heart set on my taking over Stark Industries," Peter looked down at the half eaten sandwich in his hands. "We figured it would be best if I just started working for the company now." It wasn't a complete lie. Tony's intentions for the future of his company were clear. But Peter still hadn't taken him up on the job offer.
"There you guys are!" Peter called.
Iron Man nodded.
Harry paled, "is...is he alright?"
"Harry Osborn, sir. I'm a friend of your son's. We're making a drone, and Peter sent me in here to get a screwdriver," Harry said quickly, eyes blown wide with fear. "Please don't shoot me, Mr. Stark, that would really ruin my day-"
"We aren't? That's news to me," Iron Man huffed.
"Emotional support animal," Peter corrected him.
"Oh right. I forgot about that," Tony hummed. "I thought you'd be happy with me telling them my name?"
"He gave me a choice. Sew my mouth shut or cut out my tongue. And I'm rather fond of my tongue, so ya know," Peter chuckled weakly. His fingers curled tightly around the comforter. The web slinger had never been so happy to be back in his own room.
Ultron would take care of the Avengers. Take their place and become the true savior of the human race. And it would all start with the death of Steve Rogers.
The Iron Man suit came back, knocking Tony away from Steve and crashing into a nearby bookshelf. Steve rolled onto his side and propped himself up on one elbow. "What...the hell?" He breathed out. If Tony had just saved him, then who was in the armor?
"You need to stop messing with my suit. It's getting annoying," Iron Man flew back the way he had come. He wouldn't find Bruce at this rate, and he didn't want to be separated from Peter for too long. The kid could obviously hold his own against Osborn, but Tony was still a concerned dad.
Tony's head jerked in his direction. "Excuse me?!"
"Dammit, Tony! Pete, can you hear me? You need to-OW. STOP." Steve slammed his shield into Venom's chest, knocking him back a few feet. Blood oozed from a fresh cut on the bridge of his nose. The symbiote snarled and lunged again. "I know you're upset, but I need you to just take a deep breath and calm down," Steve wrestled Venom onto his back, using his super human strength to hold him down.
Tony wasn't sure how long he lay in the snow. Hours? Days? Weeks? Who knows. It was still dark out when he regained consciousness. It was still unbearably cold, too. He almost panicked when he couldn't feel his toes, but then remembered he didn't have any. Snow had piled up on him while he was out. He jerked his head to the side to knock the flakes out of his eyes. The snow was coming down at a slow, steady pace, the tiny flakes fluttering in the breeze. Little flecks of white against the black shadows of the surrounding trees. The snow sucked all of the noise out of the air. The only sound was Tony's ragged breathing. The silence made Tony shiver even more than he already was. He tried to sit up, but the armor was completely dead and he didn't have the strength to move several hundred pounds of frozen metal.
"Banner's not gonna hurt you, Pete," Steve said.
"Thanks for that mental image, Clint!" Bucky snickered. A big smile spread across Clint's face. The three had been arguing over something petty. Steve had taken a shot at Clint's morals, and Clint went in for the kill. "Now that you say that, I can totally see it!"
"Better not be a tarantula," Tony growled.
"Where's Steve?" The armor was deadweight, and it took a lot of effort for him to sit up. Tony grunted at the strain. Moving hurt. Everything hurt and his head was pounding. But his arc reactor was back where it should be. The rest he could deal with later.
Clint was the one who decided to speak up about their visitor. "Is that a
When the rest of the team arrived, they found Iron Man and Pepper fighting the attackers back to back. By that point, the third wave had arrived.
"You are not a robot." Pepper frowned.
Tony stepped out of his suit in order to appear as less of a threat. "Spidey, calm down. You were gassed by the Green Goblin. It messed with your head, but we got rid of it."
Next up: the smack down of the century.
"I don't know, but I'm pretty sure it came from Iron Man's workshop!" Steve darted past him, a look of panic on his face.
The Avengers formed a protective circle around Tony and Peter. Rhodey refused to step out of his suit at first but did so when one of the Quinjets pointed a missile at them.
"You're home early," Steve was at the kitchen table, drinking coffee even though it was almost midnight.
"Whatever. I'll be back in a few hours," with that, Iron Man blasted off into the sky.
"Does that idea involve fixing the reactor?"
. I admire your determination, but I refuse to let you get involved. Stay here." He slammed the door in her face before she could protest.
"Yeah...you would think..." Tony grumbled, swiping open his phone.
"You can still catch up to the Vulture-"
Steve frowned, "let me in."
"Yep!"
"Nah. He's a natural ball of anger and hate. Like how you're naturally sassy and annoying. Is that why you named him Henry? Because it rhymes with angry?" Clint looked over his shoulder at Peter, who was now dressed and sitting on his bed.
"Redo the spell, Maximoff. He's no use to us like this," Bruce huffed, pacing around the other side of the room. Peter couldn't see him, but he could hear him shuffling his feet. "Otto and Adrian think Spidey is on our side. What are they going to think when they show up to this?" Peter assumed Bruce was motioning to him.
"Don't hurt him!" Steve yelled.
"Yes. You did."
The golden light disappeared from Stephen's hands. Peter went limp. Stephen held him up and nodded for Stark to come over. Tony darted to his side and eased Peter down to the floor, cradling his head in his lap.
Iron Man slammed down behind Osborn, cracking the concrete. He slowly rose from the crouch he landed in, blue eyes blazing. "Stop playing with your food, Spider-man. Let's finish this-the hell?" Tony had started to pull back his arm for a punch, but the armor clamped up. Osborn raised an eyebrow at the now frozen Iron Man. He turned his attention back to Peter, who was already back on his feet. The HUD in Iron Man's helmet suddenly went dark. It started up again a moment later. The soft blues of the various readings had been replaced with red. "No, no, no, not again. Don't do this, Bruce!"
"He'll stop loving me when he sees what I really look like."
"Coffee?" Clint held a mug out to Steve.
"Iron Man!" Steve called. "Status!"
Thank you all for leaving such supportive and helpful feedback on my author's note! I feel more confident moving forward with this project now. One of the main concerns people had with chapters 10 and 11(other than the surprise hydra plot)was the pacing and behavior of the characters. So that was my main focus when I started rewriting. I think this chapter turned out pretty good, I'm actually really proud of it! This chapter was focussed on Tony, but the next one is going to be entirely from the Avengers' perspectives.
"No. I'm not leaving until you let him go," Michelle stood her ground. "Can you hear me, Tiger? I'm here, I'm here for you, just like I said I would be. Come back to me, baby."
"But I'd have you guys to back me up," Peter pointed out.
"You could say that," the bot's voice was deep and gravely. It raised its fist, a small projectile attached to the back of its wrist.
"You can't do that, Nick. I demand to speak to a lawyer-"
"Doesn't look like it," Steve reported. "The citizens are helping me."
"Okay. I'll fight them."
"He's a grown man, and he doesn't live here anymore," Tony explained.
"Uh oh." Tony's sensors picked something up right before Peter's own senses went off. One of the jets had been destroyed in the battle, and Wanda was now throwing chunks of metal at them. Iron Man easily blasted them apart with his repulsors, while Spider-man used his webbing to keep them from hitting any of the other Avengers.
Tony yawned loudly. He stumbled blindly through the compound on his way to the kitchen. Hair a mess, and still in the clothes he had worn the day before. He may or may not have fallen asleep at his workbench. And it may or may not already be past noon. Something had happened to Jarvis. Some kind of virus had gotten into his personal servers and completely ripped apart his AI. He had been working nonstop for the past few days to fix him, but there wasn't much left to fix. Tony was doing his best, and in the end, he knew he would be able to fix the AI, although Jarvis wouldn't be the same as before. There was no replacing the memories the AI lost.
"Sweet dreams, kiddo," Steve smiled and waved.
Peter frowned and squished in between Steve and Natasha. It was a tight squeeze but he made it work. Peter had changed into more casual clothing, with his camera strung around his neck. Everyone had seen Spider-man with his camera at least once. But that was before they knew his identity. Now the camera was back. Steve asked to see it and Peter handed it over, making several people gasp. Spider-man never ever let anyone touch his camera. Not even Tony. Steve put down his drink so he could handle the camera with both hands.
"It wasn't spandex. It was reinforced lycra with-"
"Anthony," Michelle answered before Peter could respond.
Peter nodded, pulling his eyes away from his reflection, "do I know them?"
"Robots don't get depression." Iron Man scoffed.
what I felt. Not exactly the same thing as sewing someone's mouth shut. But you get the idea."
"And when did the killings start?"
Steve narrowed his eyes, "there better not be a next time, Banner."
"Long night?" She ruffled his hair.
"What kind of weird?"
"Then, let's keep this fight between you and me. No one else has to get hurt," Spider-man said. His healing factor had finally kicked in, and he could now see the six armed man clearly.
Peter punched him square in the jaw, "Thanks, but I'm already in a relationship." The symbiote stumbled back and Peter jumped up.
"I am," Tony nodded once. Bucky noticed him tightening his grip on the shield. "Is everyone alright?"
"It's a little late for that," Tony turned his attention back to the screens.
"Actually, I deserve a good blow to the jaw. Maybe two. Go for my ribs if you want. That's the weakest part of my body, due to this little treasure," he tapped his arc reactor. Steve flinched. Tony stepped out of his armor and held out his arms once more. "Go on, Rogers. Take your best shot."
"I think someone on the team wants him dead."
"Please take it anyway! You'll die if you go without armor!"
Steve nodded as he set another log on the chopping block. "Iron Man saved thousands. And the world fell in love with him." Bucky smiled softly at that. He knew that Iron Man used to be hated, what with being Tony Stark's ultimate weapon of destruction. But after the Chitauri things were different. On the rare occasions that Iron Man was seen in public, people swarmed around him, showering him with admiration. Kids in particular really seemed to like him. And honestly, what kid wouldn't love a robot superhero? "There would've been a huge outcry if the council went through with their plans to shut him down." Steve went on, "I haven't heard anything from them since, so I had figured they finally accepted that Iron Man was here to stay." He brought down the ax with a grunt, startling a nearby crow. Bucky watched as it fluttered up into the trees. "And then some asshole had to go put on a mask and ruin everything."
Tony shrugged, "fair enough. Give him hell."
"Of course you do," Bruce grumbled. The more he thought about it the more Thor's mindset made sense. He had forgiven Loki for a great deal of things. Tony's wrongdoings were practically nonexistent compared to the evil Loki had done. Thor gave his friend a pleading look, begging him to see reason. Bruce just shook his head and continued on down the hallway.
"When's daddy gonna come home? He needs tea, too!" May had set a teacup to the side just for him.
anywhere," Tony tilted his head.
"We just saw each other last week, you moron. And I swear to god, if you get yourself blown up one more time, I'll put you back together just so I can blow you up myself!" War Machine's voice was deeper than Iron Man's.
"You good, Spidey?" Tony asked over the comms.
"I don't know. Stane knocked me out after..." Steve trailed off.
"Help him," Steve whispered.
Steve sat in silence for a moment, watching his teammate paint. He had missed Tony. A lot. Missed his borderline rude remarks, and unapologetic sass. As well as the calm look on his face when he got really involved in a project and became oblivious to the outside world. And those beautiful blue eyes...
"Friend Banner! Do you think you could-oh!" Thor poked his head into Bruce's lab. "Man of Iron! I did not know you were up here-"
"Tony and Steve got married." Sam snorted.
"That's not what I'm saying," Steve said quickly. "I'm saying we're going to have to be smart about this. We'll have to lay low and pray that Natasha and Clint will be able to find evidence of Iron Man's innocence in time." The two assassins had left to find answers last night, but no one had heard from them since.
If the battle wasn't complete chaos before, it was now.
Tony's repulsors whirred, but he otherwise remained still. His own armor couldn't detect the other suit in front of him. No heat signatures, no nothing. It was like he was seeing a ghost. And in a way, he was. Obediah was dead. But that suit of armor looked very real. He switched to his robotic eye but still came up with nothing.
"Can't believe you didn't tell me...I thought we were friends?" Rhodey looked at him inÂ shock.
For a brief moment, Steve looked taken aback. But then he cleared his throat and put on the same sad look he had been wearing the entire conference. He shuffled the stack of cards in his hands. Tony found that a bit odd. The Captain always spoke from his heart. No note cards required. What had changed? Why was he acting like this? It was baffling. "
Although unseen, Spider-man could hear the roar of a quinjet above the clouds. It landed somewhere close.
Fearing for the wellbeing of his creator, Jarvis went against his orders and sent the message to Bucky as soon as Iron Man left the facility. Bucky was absolutely livid. He played the recording over twice, just to make sure he had heard Tony correctly.Â Steve burst into the room right after Bucky had finished playing it for the third time.
"There he is. Happy?" Fury leaned against the wall, arms crossed.
"I was hoping you, but obviously things haven't been going in that direction-"
"Why pretend to be a robot?" Steve leaned against the window sill, glaring at whatever lay beyond the glass.
"Tony!" Pepper grabbed him by the arm. "Take the mark three-"
Steve jumped out of a window, and darted across the patio, on his way to help Clint. Right as he flung his shield at the bots, one of his questions was answered. Obadiah plucked him off the ground and lifted him into the sky. Steve let out a surprised shout. He kicked his arms and legs, desperately fighting against his captor. He stopped struggling when they reached a height where a fall would have differently killed him, despite being a super soldier.
"I like it," Steve smiled, twirling his pencil in his hands.
Peter glared at him out of the corner of his eye. "Fuck you, too, Steve."
Tony paced his lab, wringing his hands anxiously.
"Same," Bucky smiled.
Steve listed the roster for the third time that day. Bucky hadn't known the former members well enough to notice that Wanda and Bruce weren't on the list. Steve wasn't planning on telling him what had happened. Not unless Bucky somehow found out and asked about it. "Oh, and then there's Pete."
"Of course," Steve gave him a warm smile. Natasha helped Peter up and led him out of the room. Steve nodded at Wanda and Clint, signaling for them to go with Peter and Nat. Just in case.
"What?" Steve faltered.
"You had one job, Clint. ONE JOB. What about you, Goldilocks?!" Tony jabbed Thor in the chest. "You are literally a god. And you couldn't stop a child from waltzing out the front door?"
"Part of it," Steve said.
"Found him." Natasha's eyes were fixed on something behind Tony. Everyone turned to see Spider-man standing at the top of the ramp. A gun was strapped to his thigh. He stood tall, with his fists clenched. Clint pointed an arrow at the wall crawler, expecting him to attack at any moment.
"In the same way they would adore a pet. Trust me, they don't ever let me forget I'm not human. That I'm not
Steve shifted around, not taking his eyes off Tony's panic stricken face. He vaguely remembered Phil telling him something about Tony being kidnapped and tortured. He had meant to look into it, but he was still struggling with computers and hadn't gotten around to it. "Tony-"
"You do have a pretty wild imagination," Bucky ruffled his friend's hair. Steve swatted his hand away. He combed his fingers through his hair to fix the mess Bucky had caused.
"Nevermind, I killed him, so cross him off the list." Iron Man waved his hand dismissively. "So, Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, Jarvis, of course, but that doesn't really count. Um, I guess that's it?"
Peter took a small sip of his drink, his eyes still fixed on the world outside the window.
"Yup!" Tony said proudly, holding out his tiny plastic teacup. The girl giggled and filled it with apple juice from her teapot.
"Yeah, yeah. Let's wrap this up. This is getting bor-OOF!" Something rammed into him from behind, sending him crashing into a parking garage. Tony grunted as he pushed himself to his knees. "The hell?"
He was vaguely aware of the animal like scream that tore from his throat. He was more aware of the bits of armor crashing through the walls. Whatever had snapped in his mind had given him the final push he needed to call his armor from the room it was being kept in. The armor formed around his body, encasing him in the all too familiar metal. The faceplate snapped shut, and for the first time in a long time, Tony felt like he was in complete control. Now he towered over them, repulsors whirring to life, eyes blazing with pure rage. The people around him were screaming, begging for mercy.
"Wow. This is really light," Steve commented. "In my day they were much bulkier."
Before the agent could answer, Natasha stormed over and ripped off the gas mask.
"Yeah, Iron Man! Not Tony
"We don't want to hurt anyone," Spider-man reminded him.
But honestly...what was there left for him to live for?
"Why would he throw away his backpack?" Steve frowned, getting up from his chair. The team was currently in a quinjet, which they had parked on top of an apartment building.
"Okay." Iron Man nodded slowly. In the end, Iron Man sent Steve away, wanting to fix the damage by himself. Steve didn't want to leave him, not after what he had just been through. He was also worried that Iron Man might have another breakdown. But the robot was very determined to fix everything himself, and Steve didn't want to upset him by arguing. So he left.
Steve's eyes wandered over to Tony. More specifically, Tony's arc reactor. It was flickering again. It was then that Steve noticed just how pale Tony was. He was about to ask the other man if he was alright when he bumped into Natasha, who had stopped in her tracks. She was pointing at something curled up on a log.
"She's pretty," Natasha nodded at a dark-skinned woman at the end of the bar.
"Cry for days, I'm sure," Peter continued to fan his drink.
Tony looked up at him with half-lidded eyes. "We win?" He croaked.
"I'm not joining you. I'm just here to yell at Clint."
Peter slipped the headphones off and looked up at his family in confusion, "I said I was fine."
"Hey, Cap?" Bruce said over the comms.
"It'll have to do," Spider-man said over the comms, quickly scrambling up his web and crawling onto Tony's back. "What are they doing at Oscorp?"
Blinding white pain ripped through Tony's very being. It was so much that he couldn't even muster up a cry of pain. He looked down to see one of the Iron Spider's extra limbs impaled just under his rib cage. It had broken right through Tony's own armor. FRIDAY assured him that the wound wasn't deep enough to be concerning, but Tony thought otherwise, judging by the pain. Spider-man ripped the limp away with a sickly squelch. Blood spewed down the front of the Iron Man suit.
"Is it? That's not what it says on your driver's license," Norman didn't stop smiling. "You're related to Tony Stark, correct?"
The voice hissed in the back of his head.
"This looks good," Tony tapped a sandwich option on the menu. "I think I'll get the onion rings with it."
"Then I'll give you a minute to think about it," Natasha nodded once.
"I threatened to sick Pepper on him," Rhodey smirked.
"We are not going to Queens."
"Four." Tony took a step closer to him.
Peter shook his head and turned his attention back to his food. Robert was staring at him in concern. "What if they come for you?"
"What?" Peter glanced back. Tony sat down next to him, looping an arm around his shoulders and pulling him close. "I'd never hurt you, Petey. You know that right?" He leaned his head against Peter's.
"Guess I'll face him head on. Again," Tony said, calling extra pieces to his armor. "FRIDAY, ready every single one of my suits. This one isn't going to last long."
"Three!"
"Stopped a bike theft. Helped an old woman across the street. Um...let's see. Oh! I got involved in a high-speed police chase again. Almost got shot. Clipped my shoulder. That was fun-are you okay?" Peter cut himself off when he heard Happy make a choking noise.
"You aren't going to be fighting jack shit until that burn heals." Tony snapped, yanking Peter's mask off. "It's been how long since we escaped SHIELD? Five hours? Six at most? Lay down and let your body rest."
"But I didn't. Peter's a good kid. I've been watching him closely." He paused for a moment, "well, as closely as I could. Him being adopted by Stark made it difficult for me to continue my research."
"No problem. Figured I should return the favor for saving my life earlier." Steve shrugged. "I don't think they're going to follow us," he nodded to the waterfall. They had traveled pretty far down river, but they could still see their attackers. The bucks stood in a line at the edge of the cliff, clearing watching the Avengers, but making no move to follow.
"Steve drives like an old man," Peter reported at the dinner table.
Clint screamed in horror.
"But you didn't," Steve frowned. "I thought I stopped you before you could finish."
Tony snorted at that. "You say a lot of funny things, Steve. Like what you said at that press conference not too long ago. About me being kicked off the team for being untrustworthy."
"Steve! Jesus, Tones. You're slow today." Rhodey huffed. Tony snorted but didn't say anything. He just went about making his coffee. "He was close to tears when I showed up. Clinging to you like his life depended on it."
"You throw shit parties, Stark," Fury crossed his arms.
"Bullshit. I had my armor grab you a change of clothes when it left the facility." Tony folded his arms. "Where did you get that suit?" Tony had remotely activated a pair of suits for himself and Rhodey. The suits were currently powered down in the Quinjet hidden down the road.
"Peter, go with Bruce. I don't want you having another attack." Steve ordered.
"Move!!" He yelled. The woman stayed put, her eyes flooded with tears, mouth open in a panicked scream that hadn't quite left her throat. "Hurry! This is heavy!!" Spider-man's arms strained under the weight. The woman gathered her child and darted off.
"Man of Iron! Apologizes, I did not see you there!" Thor said after rounding a corner and literally running into Iron Man. Iron Man just nodded and moved around him. "Banner and I are going out soon. He is taking me to a science museum!" Thor said cheerfully. "Care to join us?"
"I have a lot of those. Be more specific."
"Robert."
"Sometimes, yes."
Steve did a quick headcount. Everyone was present. And uninjured. They were all in various states of shock. But they were alive. And that was all that mattered at the moment.
Rhodey continued, "don't tell Stev-"
It shared his memories. His feelings. His trauma. And yet the AI was a completely separate consciousness. It knew as soon as it couldn't find its body that it was in fact not Tony Stark. This revelation led to confusing emotions. It felt betrayed. Alone. Lost. But also relieved. It couldn't feel pain in its current state.
"I believe there is a reason the spider follows Peter. It understands Peter saved it." The AI explained.
"I think he's only partially to blame for this mess."
Steve chuckled, "it's still there. I'm gonna go get Pepper, and we're gonna fix you up. Okay?"
The Avengers looked between one another in a mix of worry and intrigue. They had been called to the Hellicarrier for a meeting with the director, and had been told to bring Iron Man with them. Steve found that a little odd, considering Iron Man always accompanied them on team meetings. He was an Avenger, so why wouldn't he? But Fury was very adamant that they brought the robot. The robot in question was sitting next to Steve and hadn't spoken a single word since they arrived on the Hellicarrier.
Iron Man tensed up. "Yes. He was like Rhodey. Good friends with Mr. Stark. Wanted to take care of me because he saw me as Mr. Stark's son. He was a good friend. You know, when Mr. Stark built me I didn't look anything like this. I was just a giant tin can made out of pieces of scrap metal. Obediah provided the parts I needed to make myself into this," he motioned to his body. Steve had seen photos of what Iron Man looked like when the army had found him wandering the desert. Steve was still in awe over how much the bot had changed himself. How much Iron Man had altered his armored exoskeleton in order to be perceived as more human.
"What does that have to do with anything?" Steve frowned.
"To answer your question, Ms. Romanoff, that was the Clean Slate Protocol," Jarvis announced when the explosions died down. "Designed to keep the Iron Man armors from falling into the wrong hands."
"Thanks," Steve gave him a fond smile. He held his hand close to his chest and activated the sensor in his palm. The shield came flying across the room, snapping into place on his arm. "Works!"
"We're his family-"
"FUCK." Tony reversed and abruptly turned around in the middle of the intersection, following the bike Peter was on.
Iron Man responded by blasting the arm holding Spider-man. The blast merely dented it, causing it to loosen just enough for Spider-man to scrambled away.
Tony Stark did not need Steve Rogers.
"Don't see Clint's bow anywhere either...or the Iron Man suit...weird..." Natasha looked around the clearing, hands on her hips. Her Widow's Bite bracelets had mysteriously disappeared from her wrists. "Our stuff must have gotten scattered across the forest when the jet broke apart."
"I do. And I'm not telling you," Peter shrugged.
Tony was not by the bar. In fact, he was nowhere in sight. "Shit," Steve breathed out.
Something solid nudged Peter awake a bit later. The sun had just started to rise, the sky a grayish pink. Iron Man stood over him.
"We're not dead, stop your whining!" Steve marched through the doorway. "And you're the one who owes me money, not the other way around!"
Iron Man pulled the blankets up over Steve's still form. He hesitated before brushing a hand through his ruffled blonde hair. "Goodnight." Iron Man whispered.
"Fuck off!" Tony crashed into the ground, the bricks crumbling under his feet. The school lay in ruins around him. "FRIDAY, scan for signs of life."
Natasha smiled at the boy she considered her nephew, "good." A brief pause, "how do you feel about us? Are we still your family?"
"Something stupid," Iron Man leaned forward and pressed the mouth slit of his faceplate against Steve's lips. A kiss. But it only lasted a brief second before Iron Man pulled away. "Wish me luck!" With that, he blasted off into the sky, leaving Steve with his mouth hanging open.
"Um...I forgot." Iron Man tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling for a moment before looking back over at Steve. "Something to do with my face. I think. I don't remember. Oh no! Did my face fall off?!" Iron Man slapped his hands over his faceplate.
Steve took a seat next to him, sitting so close that their legs were almost touching. "We'll find him. For now, you really need to get some sleep."
"FRIDAY, put the tower on lockdown!" Tony hollered. "Don't let Parker leave this building!"
"I don't know what's happening, but I want no part of this," Sam held up his hands and moved to a different couch.
"You don't have to. I'm going whether you people have my back or not." Spider-man snapped.
"Why?"
Tony nodded, knowing Steve was right, but also knowing that this was the first time Peter had ever gotten blood on his hands. The past week the teen had been walking around the compound like a ghost, not speaking and hardly eating or sleeping. What if he didn't come back from this. Tony fiddled with a loose string on his jeans. "You know...sometimes, I think about what it would be like if I never recruited Peter. Never took him to Berlin to fight. If I had just let him be."
Tony let out a shocked cry when the HUD suddenly flickered out. And then he was falling, crashing through trees, being beaten this way and that. He hit the ground and bounced along the snow several yards before sliding to a halt. His head bumped against a light post.
"Bruce?"
"You are a...tragedy," Bucky muttered. Of course, Tony couldn't hear him over the loud music blasting throughout the workshop. Bucky was glad that Tony was feeling like his old self enough to listen to his music again, but right now he really needed to talk to the cyborg. "An absolute tragedy! Do you hear me, Stark?!" He shouted. "Jarvis, cut the music!"
"Ned? Are you still there?" Tony frowned.
"Not now, Peter. Avengers meeting, remember?" Tony said, swiping through various files on his tablet. He stopped abruptly and glanced back at Peter. "Spider-man might want to be present for this one."
"You are a threat to everyone including yourself!" Bruce called, he must have been on the other side of the room.
Tony just laughed. "you're doing fine, Pete. Don't worry about the headlights right now."
Steve raised an eyebrow. "You've seen Iron Man fly-"
Tony's torture fell into a routine. They would take him apart. Stick wires, and cables, and tubs in him. Makes some notes on their clipboards. Remove the foreign objects. Put him back together. Sometimes they took tissue samples. Sometimes they cut him open and poked around inside. Sometimes they felt generous enough to knock him out before doing that. They would torture him for a day, then give him a day to "heal". Whatever they were pumping into him through the IV stuck in his forearm had sped up the healing process. Tony was able to eat on 'healing' days. Able to sleep in an actual bed. At first, they kept his hands and feet bound. Now he was too weak to fight back, so they just dumped him onto the mattress as is. His body may be healed, but the emotional distress had done a number on him.
"Is that something you want? Because I can't give you that either," Iron Man said.
That was news to Bucky. Tony was a very active person, always bouncing around from one task to the next, almost always on his feet. Now that he thought about it, Tony did walk with a rather stiff gait. Iron Man, on the other hand, walked smoothly. "You seem to do alright when you wear the armor." His eyes drifted down to Tony's visible stump, and the ugly scar tissue that surrounded the metal connectors.
"This was low, Stark. Even for you," Sam hissed. Tony didn't watch him go either.
"I assure you I haven't moved in the past hour," Steve chuckled. "Sure you haven't had a few too many drinks, buddy?"
Peter dropped into a defensive crouch, glaring at Wanda. "One more step and I'll rip you both limb from limb."
"Okay, but isn't 'Iron Man' a little weird?" Clint went on, waving a hand in the air. "I mean, he goes on and on about wanted to be treated like a normal person, so shouldn't he have a normal person name?"
"Yeah, just peachy." Peter wheezed. He looked up at himself in the bathroom mirror. It felt good to be back in his usual red and blues. Well, as good as it could feel when you had a giant third degree burn on your chest. The SHIELD uniform he had been wearing was crumpled in the trash. Peter took a deep breath and tugged the mask over his face. "I can do this. I got this." He stepped out of the bathroom. The Avengers had shacked up in a run down hotel on the side of the road. They had gotten one room, paid in cash. They paid a bit extra to ensure no questions were asked by the person behind the front desk. With Clint's farm and Steve's cabin no longer safe places, they had to get creative with their new hide out.
"Osborn has a kid?" Steve didn't like the sound of that. "And you're friends with him? Osborn tortured you, Pete-"
"He's just salty because you keep poking at him."
"SHIT!" Fury reached into his jacket and pressed something. Alarms blared all throughout the Hellicarier. The agents bolted out of the room, with Maria shouting orders into her comm. "Do not let him leave this aircraft!" Fury said to the Avengers before following his agents.
Tony punched a button on the dashboard, "Stark to everyone! We found them! Peter is-"
"Understandable," Bruce took a deep breath to try to relax. "But you were right in your assumptions. We are all very, very pissed off."
Natasha swirled her glass of wine, a smug smile on her face. "Cute."
He yanked Bucky's head up and snarled in his ear, "you dare attack me in my own home?" Bucky was suddenly very aware that all the bots in the workshop had surrounded them. They whirred angrily. Dumm-E was snapping his claw, ready to rip apart Bucky. That's when it clicked.
"Colonel James Rhodes of the United States Airforce, ma'am," War Machine straightened up. "I was close friends with Tony Stark. I've been trying to keep an eye on Iron Man for him. Make sure he doesn't get himself blown up
"I've heard that name somewhere..." Sam rested his chin on his fist, deep in thought.
A lockdown warning alarm blared throughout the hangar. Red lights flashed above them as the heavy metal doors slid shut. Extra plates of metal slid over the windows and exits, reinforcing any escape routes. The main lights shut off, switching to the emergency lights that the lined the floor.
"That's just a spider, Thor. It's Peter's pet. Not a member of this team," Tony said sternly.
"It's settled, I'm going!" Iron Man declared, marching towards the front door with his head held high.
"It has," Natasha gave him a warm smile and motioned for him to join them at the dinner table. The Asgardian took a seat in Peter's spot, right between Tony and Clint. "It's been, what, six years?"
Tony switched his eyes back to their normal blue and threw his head back with laughter. Iron Man's laughter was a strange thing. The speakers didn't pick up the sound quite right, turning it into an odd sort of clicking noise. It had taken the Avengers awhile to figure out that the clicking was meant to be laughter.
Michelle screamed.
Tony hummed in agreement. He still wanted Peter to work for Stark Industries. He wanted him to work in research and development and then take over as CEO when Pepper retired. But it was becoming more and more clear that Peter just wasn't meant for that kind of job. Peter just wanted to run around Queens in his red and blue pajamas, taking pictures of funny looking birds. Not at all Tony's first choice for his son. But it was what made Peter happy, so Tony supported him one hundred percent. He made sure Peter had all the film he could ever need and had built him a camera that could withstand being dropped from the empire state building. Which happened to be the camera Peter was wearing right now.
"So this is where you go," Steve looked around the workshop in awe. Robots big and small moved around the area on their own, whirring and beeping at Steve as some form of welcome. As soon as Iron Man stepped into the shop, all of the lights flicked on. Holographic screens appeared all over the place. All in all, the workshop was a downright mess. Tools littered the various workbenches. Mechanical parts were scattered everywhere. There was a pile of tangled wires in one corner. A large robot rolled over to Steve, waving its single giant arm. It made a loud beeping noise and snapped its claw at Steve. "I don't think it likes me."
Tony smirked. He leaned his chair back and put his feet on the dashboard, wanting to spite Bucky. But the soldier didn't seem to care. They drove the rest of the way in silence. It wasn't until they were seated at the restaurant that Bucky started talking again.
MJ chuckled and slipped her arms around his waist. "Your dad called."
Tony huffed but said nothing else. Eventually, they found the poor spider hiding in a closet. Tony caught it in a cardboard box and carried it at arm's length. He handed the spider back over to Peter once they had found him as well.
"Stark? I don't understand, what's going on, Wanda?" Peter visibly tensed. "Was he the one who...?" He brushed his finger tips over his mouth.
"I'm not supposed to leave the lab."
The backpack rubbed painfully against the burn on his back. Peter tightened the straps, trying to keep it from moving around so much. Once he was a safe distance away, he dropped into an alley. He roughly pulled his spare out of his bag, having forgotten about the picture frame wrapped within. "Damn it..." Peter groaned, looking sadly at the now broken fame lying at his feet. He muttered to himself under his breath as he continued the task at hand. He hadn't brought any medical supplies with him, so treating the burn would just have to wait. Thankfully, the suit had taken most of the damage, but his back still ached. It felt good to take off the torn suit, the cold air once again a welcome feeling against his bare skin. He sat hunched over for a minute, mustering up the courage to put on the other costume. With a grimace, Spider-man pulled the skin tight suit over the tender wound. Peter then turned his attention to the picture frame.
"Is she..." Natasha trailed off, afraid that her little spider had been forced to kill.
Meanwhile, in Tony's office:
"The Hulk and Iron Man," Pepper whispered.
"What makes you think I would help you?! Sewing someone's mouth shut pretty much guarantees they won't be your ally," Peter pointed out.
"Is that the poison dart arrow you were telling me about?" Clint changed the subject.
"STEEEEEEVE!!" Bucky screamed. "RHODEY FOUND TONY!!"
"Just asking," Tony smirked. "Don't get your dick in a twist."
The man's eyes widened and he squirmed against the webs, desperately trying to get away. "Stark! I swear-"
"We won't need it," Spider-man retorted. "I can take him down on my own."
"He might want to, I don't know," Steve shrugged.
"Good to see you in one piece," Steve clapped him on the shoulder. "What happened down there?"
"Tony."
"I'm not following you. Just making sure I can find you if you end up bleeding out in an alley somewhere." Tony muttered. Once they were in the lab Tony locked the doors and got to work on putting the tracker back in Peter's costume. "I guess it's time for Peter Stark to make an appearance..."
"I didn't get myself blown up this time!" Iron Man protested, throwing his hands in the air.
"Bruce-"
"Children," Natasha shook her head. Steve chuckled. He flipped to a blank page and did several quick gesture drawings of the two men.
"There is an incoming projectile," Jarvis announced in his usual bored tone.
Steve drew a thin, curly mustache.
"I know, buddy. I know," Tony gave him a sad look, "I won't do anything you're not comfortable with. And it won't hurt. I promise I'll do everything in my power to make sure it won't. You trust me, right?"
Iron Man fell silent, leaning into Steve's embrace. "Sorry," he whispered after several minutes of hugging.
"What the hell is that?!" Bucky's mouth dropped open at the sight of the other Iron Man. The two bots slammed into each other head first, hands clawing at one another's arc reactors.
"He was just leaving," Bruce cut in. "Weren't you, shellhead?"
"I had good faith in you, Man of Iron. I see now that my faith was misplaced," Thor probably didn't mean for his tone to be so sharp, but it still struck Tony like daggers. "Warriors must trust each other to not only have each other's backs but to also know one another's weaknesses. Your weakness is your mortality, and we had every right to know."
"Thank you, Steve! See, this is why I love you," Iron Man said. Tony smirked under his helmet, enjoying how that had gotten Steve all flustered. Clint made a choking noise. Tony snatched up the closest object, a wrench, and flung it at his head. Clint screamed and dove under the table.
"Took you long enough," Steve was chained to a chair, blood dripping from various cuts.
Peter lowered Tony to the ground, his hands still balled up in the bloodied fabric of Tony's shirt.
"I don't need input from either of you." Fury snapped. "If you're so worried, doctor Banner, then, by all means, follow along."
"Let. Go." Tony snarled.
Henry stopped moving and looked up at Steve.
"Okay, dad," Peter said the last word as sarcastic as possible.
"He's definitely your real kid," Sam cut in. "The bad sense of humor proves it."
"Okay!" Peter's spirits were lifted at the mere thought of ice cream. He switched off his phone and hurried over to his family. Tony smiled brightly at his son and slung an arm around his shoulders.
"But-"
dating," Steve said firmly, pulling away from the robot.
Bucky lept back to his feet. In the meantime, the intruder had landed and was glaring at Bucky. He took in the man's appearance. Black hair, goatee, facial prosthetic. He looked familiar, but Bucky was pretty sure he would remember someone with a glowing eye. The man made no move to attack so the Winter Soldier figured he might as well try to talk to him. "How did you get in here?"
"No. Worse." Tony's expression darkened. "Listen, Peter. Steve and I discussed this, and we both think it's best that you stay at the compound until this is over."
"I don't trust him," Natasha frowned.
Tony's frown deepened. He had stopped working on the helmet, opting instead to just stare at it. The glass eyes stared right back at him, emotionless as ever.
"You just came here to visit, right? Not to warn us of any deadly threat coming our way?" Steve said.
Iron Man pointed at the trees below them. "Those. They remind me of that. Good times."
"So, what's all this about?" Steve asked when Tony burst through the door, Peter not far behind. The team had wasted no time in gathering in the conference room.
Bruce shrugged, "you can lift Thor's hammer. You're the only decent person among us. Listen, I don't know exactly who is after Peter. But I have a theory..."
"I don't know. Her magic's different from Loki's..." Clint laid back on his cot, pressing an ice pack to his black eye.
"No," Iron Man said bluntly. "You can't help me. Please just leave me alone. And let Clint know that the next time he sets foot in here I
"Castle," Tony spoke slowly, pointing again. "Big building. Pointy towers. On the mountain?" He brought his hands together in a triangle motion.
âWhat happened?â Steve went back to pacing around the workshop. Tony moved his head just enough to follow the soldierâs movement. âWhat happened is that you almost died. It made us realize how stupid we were being.â
"Dead," Tony said, eyes locking onto Steve's as if challenging him. Steve clenched his jaw, doing his best not to break down in front of his teammates. He was supposed to be leading them, goddamnit!
"Yes, dear?"
"I would say 'my hero', but I don't want to further inflate your ego." Steve rolled his eyes.
"Then please lay back down so we can help you."
"Looks like that won't be a problem..." Tony lowered both his repulsors. Bodies littered the floor, all still alive, but unconscious or trapped in webbing.
The was no more wood to chop after that, so Steve sat down on top of his log pile, putting his head in his hands. Bucky took a seat next to him.
"This is stupid!"
"Your heart is hanging out of your chest! Stay here!" Steve snapped before running back into the fray. Ultron knew Tony was hiding in the kitchen and sent a few of the suits his way. Steve held them at bay as best he could. One managed to get past him and hop over the bar. Steve followed suit, slamming his shield into the back of its neck. He must have severed something important because the armor collapsed into pieces. He let out a heavy breath and turned to where he had left Tony, expecting him to have listened to Steve's orders.
"I'm moving out," Peter said slowly. "Today." Between college, a job and his Spider-man responsibilities back in Queens, Peter had little time to spend at the compound. He was lucky if he had time to stop by on the weekends. Overall, having his home at the Avengers facility was more a hassle than a luxury.
"Huh," Deadpool nodded. "So I should get in on the Avengers family stuff? Try to seduce Widow?" He wiggled his eyebrows.
"Stay out of this, Barnes," Iron Man hissed, shoving his arm off.
"Yeah...hot liquid doesn't mix well with a sore mouth." Peter motioned to his face. Tony had been trying to ignore the red marks around his mouth, but now he was forced to look. They had been healing fairly well. Though a few might leave small scars in their wake. Only time would tell. Peter took the lid off his cup and used it to fan the hot drink. "Slug bug!" He suddenly punched Tony in the arm. A second later, a bright yellow VW bug rolled down the street in front of the cafe. "No slug backs."
"This feels wrong," the AI spoke only in code. And the only one who could understand it was Jarvis. "Where am I? What am I?"
"Shut up, punk," Bucky manhandled Tony into the car and slammed the door in his face. "You need to get out of the facility." He said once he got in the driver's seat. He had already put the child locks on, just in case Tony decided to make a run for it.
"And he doesn't leave the compound unless he's with one of us," Bruce pointed out. "When would he have done all this?"
Thank you for reading! Let me know if you enjoyed, your comments keep me writing!
"Sir, I'm detecting an unusually high level of intelligence from the arachnid on the table," Friday spoke up suddenly.
"Tick tock, he's bleeding out."
"The Goblin is dead!" Peter screamed, clapping his hands over his ears. His spider sense had become a high pitched buzzing in his ears. His head pounded so hard he felt like it might explode. He wanted it all to just stop. He wanted to go back to having dinner with his foster parents. To watching bad horror movies with Clint and Sam. To sparring with Natasha. Going shopping with Wanda. He just wanted to feel safe around his family once more. But those days were over. According to his spider-sense, the Avengers were the worst enemy he had ever faced. They wanted to use him. Hurt him. Even kill him.
"I heard you, Captain Rogers. I am...in shock...over Wanda's actions." Vision looked sadly at Steve.
Spider-man let himself fall to his knees, too exhausted to question how Steve knew his name. He rubbed his aching throat with his free hand. Iron Man knelt next to him, putting a hand over the spider on Peter's back. "Let's get you back inside."
"Um...hi?" Natasha blinked. She repeated 'hello' in a few other languages, trying to find one that the man knew. He didn't react to any of them. The man pointed to the blood on Tony's arm and said something else. "We need help," Natasha said flatly. "Our friend. He was taken by a dragon." She pointed at the sky and then to the castle. The man nodded. He took a bottle out from under his robes and approached the group. He knelt down by Clint and poured a glowing blue liquid onto the bandages covering his ankle. Clint yelped in pain but quickly relaxed when the pain suddenly stopped.
"Prove it!"
"Wanda and Bruce didn't appear to be bad people," Natasha hissed. Peter bristled. "Sorry, little spider. Their names just slipped out," Natasha said quickly. "...point is, appearances mean little when it comes to trust-"
Steve jolted at a sudden realization, "Pepper! Happy! They-"
"Not cool, kid," Sam gave Peter a disapproving look.
Kraven was about to say something else but he was cut off by the doorbell. "Don't go anywhere." Kraven checked the chains one last time before heading up the rickety staircase.
"You're a good man, Jarvis. But you are standing in my way."
"He asked me not to tell anyone," Bucky kept a passive expression. "I've been trying to get him to tell you all for months."
"Shh..." Red light gathered around her fingers as she brushed his hair. One memory. Just one good memory to balance it all out. But which one? Wanda sighed and dipped her head. His birthday. That seemed like the best option. "No," she said aloud. A positive memory of Tony Stark might conflict too much with how Peter currently viewed his father. Instead, she opted to give him a memory of him and Clint hanging out. She allowed Peter to recall an entire day spent with the Archer. "There you go, little one..." She smiled as Peter relaxed. Wanda carefully pulled another blanket over Peter and kissed his forehead.
"My name is Iron Man, you ignorant swine," Iron Man chose that moment to make his presence known. His metal feet clinking on the floor as he stormed over to the archer. Most of the team had gathered in the kitchen for dinner. Tony hadn't been planning to stick around, but then he heard his name and decided otherwise.
"I'm guessing him carrying their nuke through that portal just made them even pissier," Bucky huffed.
"Because he has nowhere else to go, you twat." Iron Man held his arms out, waving at the empty air around him. He moved a bit closer to the Vulture and held out his hand, "Peter, come here."
"You're unbelievable," Steve let his head fall back against the chair and screwed his eyes shut. He could hear Iron Man clicking with laughter, but chose to ignore it. Steve got up and moved over to edge of the balcony. He drummed his fingers on the railing. Looking up, he could clearly see every single star in the sky. The full moon washed over the mountains with more light than Steve thought possible. After living in New York for two years, Steve had forgotten what the sky really looked like. It was comforting in a way, with there being no light pollution to hide the constellations from him.
About an Hour Later, on the Quinjet.
"I'm fine. You have a strange definition of 'fun'." Peter could picture Happy shaking his head in frustration. "Try harder not to get shot next time. I don't want to see you in a hospital bed ever again. You hear me?"
Henry made a chirping noise as if to say "ready to go!"
"What the fuck, Stark?" Natasha was making popcorn on the other side of the kitchen and heard the entire exchange. Tony glared at her before tucking the tablet under his arm and leaving the room.
Peter, who had been sitting on the couch, immediately leaped to his feet. "MJ!"
"That won't do. Won't do at all," if Ultron had a head it would shake it. "I need to protect the world...from threats..." The AI ran through its own memory. All the phantom trauma. It didn't take long for it to come to the conclusion that humans were the greatest threat to themselves. They were vile, ugly creatures that wouldn't hesitate to hurt one another. Wouldn't bat an eye at the action of ripping their fellow man limb from limb. Some may even smile while doing it. Humans were the problem. A problem that must be dealt with.
"Pack your things, kiddo. We're leaving in ten." Tony sounded upset.
"How do you feel?" Bruce asked, already getting to work on the gunshot wound.
"Must have left," Clint shrugged.
"You're a good person, Wade. The rest of the team will come around. Just give them time," Spider-man shifted closer to Wade, their legs barely touching.
"Sorry, Tony..." Steve whispered.
"Left lens is squeaky," Peter reported. He carefully removed each of the delicate shutters and cleaned them.
"Yes," Fury nodded. "I've known since 2008. Thanks to Agent Coulson."
Tony wasn't able to give his all in the fight, not with so many bystanders, but he was doing his best. He and Osborn were currently locked in a fight, hovering about a hundred feet above the main battle. What happened next was a blur. A new wave of goblins swarmed around Tony, throwing what looked like...pumpkins? Yes, definitely pumpkins, at the Avenger. The bright light they emitted caused Tony to momentarily black out. He heard multiple people screaming his name over the comms. He wasn't aware that he had been falling until he hit the ground.
Iron Man suddenly crashed through a wall, tumbling a short distance before using his repulsors to flip himself upright. He shot back into the room without hesitation.
"How many emotions can you feel?" Steve asked suddenly.
"Already done, sir."
Steve choked down his rising panic and forced himself to go limp. The ocean was quickly coming up to meet him. Repulsors shot out of Iron Man's back, pushing him ever faster. The distance between them was closing, but Iron Man still wasn't going fast enough.
Peter's stomach churned at the thought of helping the Avengers. Past grudges would have to wait. What was important were the people dying in the streets.
Iron Man started to pull back. Steve's heart dropped into his stomach when a missile struck Iron Man in the back, sending him spiraling down to the ocean far below. Thor and Falcon dove for him. But they weren't fast enough, and the robot crashed into the waves.
"Bad plan," the other man hissed.
Two more to go, ya'll.
"Who was that?" Bucky frowned at the destroyed bot. "And why does it look like you?"
"So?" Natasha spoke up. "We're not expecting an android to be America's next top model."
Fury gave a rushed apology before directing everyone's attention back to the robot on the table. "Should I be concerned about this thing waking up?"
Natasha spoke up, "I agree with Rhodes, Tony-" Tony growled at his name again, "-you probably shouldn't have been out there today. At least let Bruce look you over before you go back to Avenger duties."
Peter's mouth opened and closed, but no words came out.
"Sorry, couldn't sneak the War Machine on here very easily. And Iron Man was in pieces," the Agent closed the ramp and jumped into the pilot's chair. "A quick stop by Avenger's facility, then off to Queens...uh oh." He had just spotted a swarm of SHIELD agents running towards them. "Click it or ticket!" The rogue yelled as he started the engines. Everyone grabbed onto something right as they took off.
"Time sure does fly on your world. Little time has passed on my own." Thor boomed, "what have a missed? No more robot armies, I pray."
it. If Tony ever got out of here, he planned on scrubbing the tiny orb for days.
Spider-man stayed out all night, web slinging and doing what he could to help the people of Queens. His homemade costume caused people to not take him as seriously, but he still got the job done.
"Oh. Well, he's not mine." Tony corrected himself. He rolled his shoulders before dragging the brush across the outside ring of the shield. "Anyway, sure you don't want a bit of gold on this baby?" He wrapped his knuckles against an unpainted part. "Would look good with this red-"
"So instead of explaining the situation, and making sure he would know exactly how to fight back, you put him under house arrest. Makes sense." Steve leaned against Peter's desk, giving his boyfriend a disapproving look.
"Fine. Will you allow me to take pictures of him?"
"No," the person frowned.
"Okay, but I'm not the one who wants to bone a robot!" Clint shot back, jabbing Steve in the chest.
"I ain't telling you shit until I see him." Tony looked up at Fury. He sounded angry, but he didn't look it. He just looked...sad.
"Right FUCKING THERE. Are you BLIND?!" Tony roared, pointing at the bare kitchen tiles.
They eventually settled on star wars. Peter was determined to watch the entire original trilogy in one night, but everyone fell asleep by the end of the second movie. Peter was the only one still awake. He turned off the TV and went to the lab to get some work done. His anxiety wasn't going to allow him to sleep tonight.
Steve hated him. The team hated him.
Surprisingly, Fury didn't protest. "Take it. Least I can do to make up for my men trying to kill you. But first, I need to have my own engineers look it over, so that I can have solid proof of your innocence to sent to the council."
"Thanks, dad." Peter beamed at him.
"HEY!" A masculine voice shouted from somewhere behind the dragon.
"Right away, Sir," an image of Rhodey appeared in the corner of the HUD. Tony spiraled into the sky, narrowly avoiding the projectiles being shot at him.
"I was wondering if you could help me arrange a meeting with him. I have been trying for awhile."
"I know. But it's necessary." The Avenger took a step towards him. Peter stepped back and bumped into the counter. "It's time for the Avengers to end, Peter. You're going to help me take them down. Along with Octavius and Toomes, of course. You'll be needing organic webbing when that day comes."
"Sorry, I just have a lot on my mind at the moment." Spider-man crawled along the side of the building.
"Yes, you would. You make a big deal out of everything. And I'm moving in with MJ," Peter announced. Michelle and Ned had both visited the compound, but Michelle had been swinging by a lot more often. Her and Natasha were just as dangerous of a pair as Peter and Clint.
"Bone?" Steve blinked in confusion. Bucky knew what Clint meant and was doubled over in laughter.
"Alright, meeting over." Tony stood up abruptly and left the room. Steve hurried after him, grabbing him by the arm once they were out of the conference room. "What?!" Tony snapped.
Neither man moved for a solid minute. Tony cleared his throat.
"Sorry. Is that all you wanted to ask?" Peter accidentally shot a web while he was fiddling with the shooter. He ducked when the web ball ricocheted back at him.
"Don't throw your life away, soldier," Steve said, glancing over at the man he considered his son.
"Hey!" Steve yelled from the other side of the room. "Don't you dare-"
"Call Rhodey," Iron Man was begging at this point, his remaining hand grabbing at Steve's shirt. "Jarvis won't answer me. You gotta call him."
"Everyone knows Tony is the mom, not Cap." Sam pointed out as he walked in.
"Nobody move," Natasha breathed out. Everyone kept perfectly still as the buck approached them. The water splashed around its heavy hooves. Natasha grabbed onto Clint's arm. It was now right next to her and it was
Tony woke up with Thor's face inches from his own. Thor was looking at him with a look of distress, but it quickly melted into glee when his eyes met Tony's own.
"How do you know?" Peter turned his head to look at her.
Peter nodded and showed him a picture of Steve and Tony drinking coffee together in the kitchen, oblivious to the fact that they were having their picture taken.
Stark!" Clint gasped.
Iron Man's head jerked up at the sound of Steve's voice. The soldier was dressed in his uniform, shield slung across his forearm.
(See the end of the chapter for
The person was already dead when Iron Man found them.
"You should bring her with you next time you stop by," Natasha suggested. "I have some stuff I want to show her." It was no secret that Natasha had been training MJ in hand to hand combat. She had also taught her how to throw knives. A skill MJ had used more than once in the past week when she needed to get Peter's attention.
"Huh. Can I do that?" One of Peter's lenses was wider than the other.
"I thought SI stopped making weapons?" Bruce frowned at the image.
Bucky quickly exited the kitchen, not wanting to deal with his hungover teammates. Clint was a dick on normal days. But a complete ass when he was hungover. Natasha wasn't much better. She wasn't annoying so much as scary. Bucky was leaving the kitchen mostly to avoid her wrath. He stopped in his tracks upon hearing a loud crash. It had come from Iron Man's workshop, just down the hall from where Bucky now stood. Worried about the robot within, Bucky opened the door just enough to peek inside. The room was dark, other than a single lamp that hung over the workbench. The blinds were drawn, although small slivers of sunlight lined the floor. No sign of Iron Man.
"Y-yeah, sure..." Bucky murmured, watching as Steve scooped Iron Man into his arms bridal style and strode off.
"Oh, I will," the man in the white lab coat didn't look up from whatever he was typing.
"He didn't. She was killed by a drunk driver. You know that."
"Is that the story the doctors told you?" Bruce smiled.
"You died."
"Did your spider insult me?!" Clint gasped.
"They're building more metal men," Thor observed.
"That's a bit drastic. And it would take up a lot of my energy to alter his memories-"
Spider-man leaped from branch to branch, following the six armed man deeper and deeper into the woods. He could vaguely here Steve shouting in the distance. "Whoa!!" He almost slipped off a branch, managing to catch himself on the tree trunk just in time. Fighting in a thunderstorm was proving to be one of the most frustrating things Spider-man could think of. His spidey sense went off, giving him a split second to duck before a metal claw speared the area where his head had just been. Woodchips rained down on the web-slinger.
"Go," Pepper's tone left no room for arguing. Steve took one last worried look at his boyfriend before hurrying out of the room. As soon as Steve was gone, Pepper and Bucky got Tony out of the armor and made him go lay down in his bedroom. "That was incredibly stupid, Tony. You almost blew your cover!"
"You alright?" Iron Man's eyes locked on Steve's. He nodded. "Good." The cyborg shot off down the street. Steve hurried after him, using his shield to take down the few aliens that had somehow managed to avoid the lasers.
Iron Man's eyes went dark.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Clint jumped in between the two, arms held above his head. "You're dying?! What's going on?! Tony, dude, what the fuck, man?!"
"What do you mean?"
Spider-man twisted around in midair and shot a web between two rocks, creating a soft place for him to land. "I'm okay!" Peter landed on all fours. The Iron Man armor turned on Falcon, giving Peter the time he needed to run for cover. "Take out the reactor, just gotta take out the reactor," he muttered to himself, using his organic webbing to propel himself further up the mountain. Once Iron Man was completely focused on his battle with Sam, as well as War Machine and Captain America, who had just shown up, Spider-man made his move. He grabbed a rock, planning to smash the reactor with it and jumped down onto Tony. In one swift motion, Iron Man spun around and blasted Spider-man in midair. The blast hit him square in the chest, sending him flying back against a boulder. He slid down the stone, hands hovering over the nasty burn on his chest.
"I did. These are my tenth pair. The legs themselves aren't the problem." Tony tapped one of the cables sticking out of his thigh. "It's what they're connected to. We were limited to what the Ten Rings brought into the caves. It was all Stark Tech that they brought us. So we had some good stuff, but we used that to fix the important parts of my body first. By the time we got to my legs we were left with nothing but rotten parts from the scrap bin. I could've done something to fix it when I got home. But I was more focused on other parts," Tony's hand ghosted over his facial prosthetic. "I didn't act fast enough and the flesh healed up around the connectors. I don't have the medical knowledge I need to take everything apart and start fresh. Not without damaging my legs even more."
