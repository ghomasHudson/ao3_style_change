Reaching the roof, Steve had to blink at the chaos he was seeing; part of Steve was irritated that he was interrupted from his calm life by the joke of the galaxy crashing into his life to kidnap him or something. They probably heard about a star landing on Midgard and decided to kidnap him to sell him for the highest bidder, just like they did the Power Stone. Unfortunately for them, they didn't know Steve all that well if they decided to come here unprepared. "Enough!" Steve snarled, letting his glowing increase in brightness which blinded everyone momently, causing them to cuss as they start rubbing their eyes, not even the highest and brightest technology managed to save their eyes from Steve's shine.
Dr. Banner had even commented about the pup being surprisingly healthy if they didn't count the pneumonia and being small for his age. Tony kept his mouth shut at that, but the look that the doctor sent him told him he knew, Tony spent the time ever since his baby born taking care of his pup, if it meant that he had to give his baby every bite of food Stane gave them and eat a few bites a day, Tony would do it, his baby was the most important thing for him.
Peggy sniffed when she heard Steven's words muttering her apologies to the man making him give a tired smile at that. "It's OK Peggy, just never think about it like that again…" Steven whispered which made the woman nod her head and pull herself out of Steven's hug to wipe away her tears. "Hey, Peggy, you said that Tony was twenty, how is that even possible? Wasn't he born in 1970? And what about his parents?" Steven asks which made the woman take a deep breath trying to calm herself lest she did something she regrets, Steven's words made the woman blink as she shook her head trying to regain her thoughts.
Tony wakes up with a terror-filled scream, gazing around the place he was in with fear blanketing him, nearly choking him; tears start clouding his eye, which made Tony blink his eyes several times to clear his vision, letting out a whimper of confusion when he saw that he was laying on the sofa in the living room, a blanket surrounding him keeping the warmth from escaping Tony.
His action only made the Alpha smirk at him before leaving the cells, leaving Steven and the servants alone, the Omega relax a little when the Alpha was out of his sight, and he looked at his left bruised hand with a scoff, another mark an Alpha leaves, so Steven didn't pay that much attention to it, he just put his left hand on his babe's back and start rubbing it gently while cooing to the baby, it took a while for James to calm down, but when he did, Steven relaxes even more at that and purred gently, which made the pup snuggled into him and give a broken purring sound.
Tony has to blink a few times at the answer he got, narrowing his eyes in disbelief as he got out of the labs, not without a bottle of holy water though, he was not an idiot to get out of his lab without some protection, he did pause before opening the door and took a sip of a cup filled with salty water, when he signed to Jarvis to open the door, he was greeted with the sight of a cute doll holding a scissor, which Tony spate the saltwater on, causing the door to shriek in pain and to fall apart before his eyes. "Jarvis, cross doll number 22." Tony called out hearing a ping confirming that Jarvis did just that, good. 22 dolls were destroyed, 185 left roaming the ground of his mansion.
"Bambino, nothing that causes you to cry is stupid, what happened?" Tony questioned gently drawing the boy in a hug when he saw the boy's lips quiver at the question, which made Tony struggle to shush him getting a few sniffles before the young boy finally calmed down.
With how much ranting and screaming Fury was doing, Tony could only groan and massage his tempers; first of all, Tony wanted to scream at Fury that nothing was his fault, but the fault of everyone at the party. Second of all, you would think that after the information dump two years ago, everyone would have known by now the truth about Steven Grant Rogers. With how unreasonable Fury was, and how much the PR has proven to be idiots, Tony knew that he was going to stay in this room for a long, long time.
Halfway done, with only the beard left to get rid of, Steve's phone starts ringing, which snapped him out of his chat with the barber and Bucky, he gave Bucky a reassuring squeeze before taking his phone to see who was calling, almost scowling when he saw that it was Tony; of course, Tony will call him now of all the time. Before Steve answered the phone he paused a little before turning it to the silent mood, not answering Tony's call, letting it go to the voice mail. Yes, it was petty of him, but Tony did the same thing to him, ignoring Steve's fifty-plus calls after he promised he will be with him today of all days.
Howard walked toward his bed, standing over Steve, gazing at him with unreadable eyes that made Steve more concerned than he ever was when he was forced to deal with Howard. "I hate you, I'm sure that you are aware of that." Howard stated, and Steve knew if he had the strength, he would have given Howard a piece of his mind; after all, who in their right mind will start their conversation with a dying person like this?
Steve narrow his eyes at the Omega's back then turned toward his son, who was looking at the toy with a happy look on his face. "Ne, Peter…" Steve asked gently as he lean down a little to look at his son. "What did he smelled like when you went near him? You know he is an Omega right?" Steve held his breath waiting for his son's answer.
"Steve…" Tony purr shifting in his place before raising his head to look at his husband… his husband looked amazing with his bed hair; it really gave him a unique look. "Do you think Betty would let us take Harley to the park tomorrow?" Tony asked, a smile taking over his face as he imagined how Peter was going to react when they take the two kids to the part tomorrow that is if Betty accepted to come with them as Harley's guardian.
In the end, even Tony can't hide from his birthday party, not because he can't, because he can! But because Serpentine decided to pay him a lovely visit and threaten Tony that she will haunt every person who arrived at the party if Tony refused to go with Steve as his plus one and announced their engagement. No don't get Tony wrong, he would
"Hey there, Pete…" Tony called out as he walked toward the pup hugging him tightly, which made the boy purr happily and snuggle into Tony's chest. It will be easy… Tony just has to pull a few strands of Peter's hair and then he will know, it was easy, he could even ask the pup and the boy will jump at the idea, thinking that it was nothing but a school project, it was so easy… but Tony found himself too frozen to even do it.
"Mama, Papa! Grandpa is here!" Peter's loud voice broke Tony and Steve from their moment, causing them to pull away with flushed cheeks to gaze at Peter who was scrunching his nose as he gazed at them. "Grandpa is here, and I cleaned my room!" Peter stated before he turned around, causing Tony to shake his head and chuckle, trying to stop his laughter when he heard Steve grumble about cheeky brats.
With a stuttering breath, Tony wrenched the closet door open the rest of the way, his heart pounding madly in his chest at the thought of him catching the person who entered his own home without permission. Instead of finding someone inside, Tony was confused at the empty closet in front of him; it wasn't strange that the closet was empty, not when Tony still hasn't unpacked his baby's clothes yet. At least Tony thought that there will be someone there, not the closet being empty and all.
"You don't look that much fond of me, son of Sarah." Odin said off-handedly which made Steven snort at that rudely which made Frigga look away from her husband a small smile taking over her face, at how red the man's face becomes, she was happy that someone was able to take her husband down a few pages.
"Peter will be so excited about meeting new friends; also this Riley seems smart, you really should have brought him with you." Tony chuckled as he arrived at the cashier giving Sam a goodbye nod. "Don't be a stranger, Sam, come and visit us soon!" Tony smiled as he waved goodbye to Sam and his kids.
The stars were beautiful, so is the moon when its light falls on the lake, giving it a glowing halo. Tony will always lay on his back and gaze at the beautiful stars, ignoring the cold as he took in everything with wide eyes full of wonder and amazement searching the constellation and keep talking about them, talking about the stories and myths that circled them; hoping that whoever was listening will get to enjoy them as much as Tony does. Tony knew that after his baby is born, he will always bring her here with him to gaze at the beautiful star and enjoy them as she was rocked to sleep by the calm waves of the lake.
"Thor, buddy, what are you doing? Get away from him before he tries and attack, it's not pretty when he goes into his fit." Tony said as he took a step toward Thor and Steven causing the star to raise his eyebrow and look at the metal-clad Midgardian with a raised eyebrow, he never thought that Midgardians were that foolish, but again, they were still infants since the last time he gazed at them, they made a big step by making those 'Trains'.
Steve raised his head at that and let a small laugh as he lowered his hands. "This is my AI, Edith…" Steve said tiredly making Tony look at him with a shocked face.
Two weeks, that's how long Steve and Tony had been in their honeymoon phase; two weeks since they flow to one of the Stark/Carbonell family villas and homes in Italy to enjoy themselves before returning to their life back in the USA. Two weeks the mated couple spent their time together, getting to know the other intimately in bed, gasping and moaning and sharing pleasure and happiness at the thought of finally being together and alone to enjoy their time while being uninterrupted.
"You will continue to hate me for his death no matter what I do, is that it?" The king asked, and Steven wanted to scream yes; he wanted to growl and snarls and hisses at the king, he wanted to tell him how much he hates him and how much he wished for Hela to descend on earth and take him… but for a second, just for a second, Steven decided to think over the king's question and decide his answer.
The angst! My heart hurts!
"Are you sure Steven?" Peggy asked, already knowing that the man, was talking about making his arrival a public for everyone, and Peggy doesn't really know what will happen if the knowledge of Steven arriving from another universe, and if what Steven said about Hydra was true, she doesn't know what they will do.
Steven was about to stop Peggy, after all, no matter what Tony did he was sure he didn't deserve to be treated like that, but before Steve could react Tony thrust his fist toward Steve and open it to show a small silver chain with two rings… two rings that Steve immediately memorized, Steve's hand went to his chest immediately only to discover that they weren't there, Steve had been so consumed by protecting Edith and making sure that no one took her that he forget about the most important thing to him. "Oh…" Steven breathed out as he extends his hand shakily to take the rings from Tony.
"Peter!" Tony could only scream in terror as his eyes took in the mansion that was up in flames, pain, hurt, and denial warred inside Tony because it can't be, it just can't be, can't be, his son can't be inside. Oh God, his son, and Steve were inside the burning mansion!
"Can you do something for me?" Tony asked with a strong voice, Steve kisses his forehead whispering 'Anything' making Tony hum at that. "Can you promise me to love me for the rest of my life?" Tony said caressing Steve's cheek, making the blond man smiled at him in confusion.
"Come on Megan, are you sure you know this element?" Tony teased the little girl making the four years old giggle at that and jumps a little while gripping Tony's hand tightly, both of them walking through the park after Tony volunteers to walk Megan from daycare to see Pepper in the park.
"A-aunt Peggy… please…" Tony finally whispered after an awkward while of silence that blanket the library, Peggy took a deep breath as she tried to calm herself while swiping her bangs away from her face and gaze at Tony with a harsh look on her face, making the man take a step back.
That made Tony growl and hiss at Stane, only to see Stane looking at him with a smug face, he was going to kill that bastard! "What the fuck?" Tony snapped taking a step after step intended to at least hit Stan and break something.
From the corner of his eyes, Tony saw how Rhodey and Pepper send each other a look, which secretly made Tony swallow; God, how he hated being forced to deal with situations like this, never once in his life did Tony think that 'Talking about ghosts and haunted houses' will be one of the situations he will be forced into. "Tony, Pepper, and I were wondering if you would like to move with us, you know back to New York. Howard and Maria moved to Malibu a month ago so-" Tony cut Rhodey by raising his hand, which made his friend press his lips tightly, making Tony feel a little guilty at that.
Pepper's grin seemed to widen even more as she and Steve exchanged a few short words before turning to Tony, causing the inventor to wince when she stepped on his leg to return him to the land of the living. "I will leave you alone boys, don't cause any trouble when I am gone, Tony." Pepper smiled giving Steve a nod before walking toward someone that Tony thought was Happy.
Telling their friends that the two of them were engaged was not that much of a challenge that Tony thought it would be, he still remembered his friends' shocked faces that turned happy and delighted at the news, even Rhodey, who already knows about the engagement start crying once again, which ended up with Carol trying to calm her husband who looked like a mother seeing her daughter at the altar; let's also not forget Winnie who starts glaring at her son until the poor man cracked and confessed that he was dating Natasha for the last five years, which was shocking to everyone but Steve, even Natasha was shocked and flustered by Bucky's confession; Winnie's face though, the expression was gold… and if Tony took a thousand of embarrassing pictures as blackmail materials… no one needs to know.
So what do you think?
It started with someone running fast, the road was deserted a little considering that it was early in the morning, it ends with Anthony panicking and hitting the breaks hard, but it was not fast enough as the car hit that person who runs in front of him, Anthony could remember how his heart nearly stop in his chest as he felt the loud sound of something getting hit, he remember rushing out of the car, heart in his throat fearing that he hurt the person on the other side, or worse that he killed him when Anthony reached the person lying on the ground looking at the sky, he nearly let out a whine as he realized that he hurt not only a child that could be in his fifteen but an Omega at that, a small Omega who was blinking dizzyingly at the sky.
Tony could see the Alpha let out a sigh at his son antics and walked toward Tony, so much for running away, when the Alpha stood before him, Tony wondered if he imagined the Alpha's eyes widen in shock, but the Alpha looked at his pup with a strange look then turn toward Tony. "I am sorry if my son caused you problems; he ran away before I could catch him, my name is Steve Rogers." The Alpha said as he offered his hand toward Tony, which made the Omega blink a little, thankfully the Alpha didn't seem like he was going to kill him.
Finally an update, sorry for the late one, but oh well.
"It's a little late, don't you think?" Steve said with a sarcastic tone, which only made Tony swallow. "You know, I promised myself that the first thing I will do once I see you will be punching you in your perfect teeth, but the thing is… you are not worth it… not anymore." Steve said looking at Tony giving him a once over before looking at his side. "Goodbye, Mr. Stark." With that Steve turned and starts walking away.
Sorry for the late update, hope this long chapter is enough of a sorry…
"Papa!" Peter squealed as he saw Steve arranging his pillow on the floor and run toward the Alpha throwing himself in Steve's arms purring happily when the Alpha hummed and start running his hand through the pup's hair.
"My… Queen…?" The king's concerned voice only made Steven bit the inside of his cheek harder until it started bleeding; at that moment Steven wondered if he can hate the king for causing his son's death if the Alpha was lied to by an oath breaker, or maybe the Alpha was lying? But why would the king do that when he must have known that Steven will do anything the king wished for if he told him that his son was alive and was here.
"Just as I said, the Avengers are going to be there to stop him, baby. You know we are not the only superheroes in the world, right? There are many other superheroes that are going to fight beside us." Tony explained gently causing his boy to him and snuggle into his chest, an action that made Tony smile gently…
He let out a shaky breath and crawled to his son… why was he even trying? He was the reason Jarvis died, his parents and Aunt Peggy died from an attack on SI, and Stane killed Angie, killing the last family he had, and his friends probably forgot about him, and his baby… God, his baby was dying in front of him and he couldn't do anything to stop it… he reached his baby and touched his burning cheek, he kissed his forehead and lied down beside him holding him tightly… Stark men are made of Iron… Pff, Yeah, right… as if that was true… he can't do this anymore, he can't, he can't! He wants out, out, out of here! But what's the use? He has no one, he promised himself a long time ago that he won't break! He was a Stark he was made of Iron… and Iron melts at the temperature of 1538 Celsius… Jarvis, his parents, Peggy and her mate Angie they all were 1536 Celsius just enough to bent him but not break him… but his baby… his Peter was all it takes to finally do it…
"The most important thing is that you take care of yourself Tony, but it's ok to spoil yourself once in a while." Tony and Dr. Cho said goodbyes after that, with Tony, going home in happier mood then he was months ago, thinking about what he was going to do, he already packed his things (Pepper and Happy did, they wouldn't even let him raise a spoon if they could) and he had already sent Dummy and his new AI into their new home. He finally finished the AI, and he ends up naming him JARVIS if he gave him a British accented voice? No one needs to know. He already installed JARVIS in his new home, it was an amazing place to be in, big and spacious, with lots of room for him and the baby (And maybe a Good Alpha if he found one) he already turn the basement into his new lab, even after finishing his house, there was still a lot of space in there to be used, and lots of rooms were waiting to be turned to something else other than guests rooms.
"Did you enjoy yourself,
“Do you need to ask?” Tony replies cheekily, giving Steve his hand, his grin nearly splitting his face in two when Steve secured the ring around his ring finger. “Thank you for not kneeling, I don’t think I could have handled the anxiety of you doing that.” Tony joked, getting a chuckle from Steve. “You still didn’t kiss me, I’m waiting.” Steve laughed, pulling Tony tightly toward his body before kissing him; Tony let out a content sigh through his nose, pulling Steve toward him until there was not even a small space between them, kissing him over and over again…
"Listen here, you home-wrecking bitch!" As soon as Harley reached Clint's house, Peggy started to shout, causing Tony to suppress a sigh as the woman finally decided to show her true colors. "Who do you think you are to prevent me from seeing my husband and child?! You are nothing but a homewrecker who dares to come between me and my husband! How dare you tell me what to do?!" Peggy started to scream in Tony's face, walking until she trapped him between her and the door, causing an irrational speaks of panic to take over Tony before he harshly shoved it down and pushed the other Omega away from him.
"No, I didn't." Peggy said in a steady voice looking in Maria's tear-filled eyes, and she really didn't, Peggy felt like the ground under her feet was shaking because she didn't know what the fuck happened other than what Natasha and Clint were able to explain, how? How could Howard do such a thing to Tony? For how long was Tony suffering like this without anyone realizing it? Tony was going to be a father… a father! And with Howard refusing to tell them what took a place, she didn't know where the Omega and the pup where! How old is the pup? Does he know about Tony? Where is the Omega? If he was Bucky's family like the Alpha always told her about then that meant he was dead, right? That meant the pup was dead and the Omega was dead and the killer was Howard, and Peggy was this close to having a panic attack in front of everyone because Tony has disappeared and no one knows where he was and where was she going to find the Omega that Barnes spent ten years searching for only to get nothing! Will she find him in the cemetery? Peggy nearly screamed her head off.
That caused the burly sentinel smiled deviously and strolled back into the room closing the doors behind him, Steven was able to pick up what he was yelling to rile up the other Vikings. And Steven quickened his step and forced James to do the same as they followed the Viking King out of the castle, but even in their haste, Steven was still able to hear it: the unmistakable noise of a massacre taking place, and Johann's screams echoing through the frigid walls of his castle until they ceased completely.
"Love…?" Mr. Stark looked at Steve as he put his checkbook in his right pocket and looked at the Omega with a blank look. "If I remember correctly Mr. Rogers, you are what? Nineteen and a half…? I presume I am right. Kids at your age… they change their heart like they change their shoes, you probably won't remember Anthony in a few years from now when you stop seeing him." The older Alpha said looking at Steve with a cold smile making the teen throw the man a dark look.
"You had that drink an hour ago you lazy bum! Now come here and say hello to Tony." Winnie glared at the Alpha who let out a long-suffering sigh and grumbled to himself as he walked toward Winnie who was standing near a brunette Omega that wore a fancy suit. "Tony, this is my son James, the one I have been talking about, James this is Tony Stark, you know…" Winnie said as she elbows her son in the ribs when he looked at the Omega with a bored look.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He is working aboard; Mommy said he is the best inventor in the whole world, even better than you." The pup said which made Tony's lips twitch up a little at that, an inventor better than him? That should be interesting.
So what do you think?
Steven could only hum gently to his babe, rocking him to sleep; his muscles relaxed every time the little pup let out a content sigh and snuggle closer to him. The Omega didn't want to think about the meaning of his babe's words, he didn't want to think about the possibility of him being pregnant in this place, and how did that even happen? Steven was so careful… he made sure to mix the herbs himself, herbs that took Steven a long time to gather, and even longer time to prepare so that no pregnancy will happen, herbs that didn't fail the omega for over six years. It made the Omega rage at that, hurt and pain warring inside of him, and he just wanted to scream… scream at how unfair the world was for making him bite more than he can take…
Steve could only gaze at Howard with wide eyes; he really couldn’t believe what he was seeing, but the cries of his baby snapped Steve out of it, making him rush toward his child. Seeing him, Peter let out a cry and raise his tied hands, and God how much Steve hated seeing his baby like this, untying his baby’s arms, Steve pulled his child to his chest, shushing him gently, trying to calm the overwhelmed babe, his baby was shaking like a leaf! From the corner of his eye, Steve saw how Howard went to the fallen Alpha, giving him a few kicks before leaning down and putting his fingers on Rumlow’s neck, probably to check if he was dead, which seems like he was, judging by the satisfied nod from Howard.
Latin form of (Nikolaos) which means victory; as for (Fiðr) it is Old Norse variant form of (Finnr) which meant wanderer...
Bucky swallows at that and walked to the door banging on it with his metal arm. "Open the door, Stark; I have a message to you from Steve!" Bucky hurls as he banged on the door, the music was cut so he steps back as he waited for what Stark was going to do next, heart pounding in his chest about what he was going to do.
So what do you think?
It took time before Steve was finally standing; his mind was begging this mortal body to hold on until they reached safety, he needs to get Peter to safety before he let this body collapse. Shaky step after shaky step Steve took, hoping that the woman with the reddish-brown hair will stay unconscious until they were out of here and safe.
When they reached the mansion, Tony had to smile at how his son snuggles into his chest, fast asleep, today was probably the most exciting day in the pup's life, not only he gets to play with kids his age, he also went to the zoo and had fun playing with the animals, had ice cream for the first time which half of it was feed to Steve's shirt and then tasted the best Italian pasta out there, the poor pup tired himself to sleep.
"I never asked you how you spent Clint's heat with him, did I?" Tony asked just to be a little shit, grinning madly when Angie shriek and whirl on Natasha who tensed like a bow, ready to dash any minute now that Angie's eyes settled on her, it was only a few seconds of intense staring before Angie charged at Natasha, which caused the redhead squeak (Something that Tony knows Natasha will choose death than admitting) and ran out of the room with Angie hot on her heels.
"Why are you playing the innocent here?" Steven finally snapped, he couldn't take this anymore, he has to get this off his chest or it will poison Steven for the rest of his life. "The Hydra king caught one of your people once, an idiot Beta who claimed to be your mate, a Beta with green eyes and blond hair; I made that Beta take a sacred oath, to take my son with him to the safety of Brookland and for him to give you all the scrolls containing the information about Johann. From the security of his palace to where he hid his treasure to the people he enslaved. I sent you a letter begging for your help as one of your people, but you never answered!" Steven hissed wanting to scream but couldn't unless he woke up the children which were something Steven wouldn't do.
"Promise me, you will try…" Tony whispered making Steve look at his husband's sad eyes, in the end, Steve nods his head making Tony smile at that tiredly.
"We are fine, doll, though we missed you, I wish you could have come with us…" Steve murmured, giving Tony another kiss on the cheek his beard tickling Tony's face making the Omega shiver pleasantly, an annoying knowing grin was pasted Steve's face when he noticed what his action was doing, though, Tony won't mention it, for he was too busy questioning how the older man was looking more handsome today than usual, maybe it's because Tony didn't see him and Peter for three days, and that made Tony pout fiercely because Tony sure as hell missed his boys.
"But that Mister was sad! He was all alone crying I couldn't leave him alone!" Peter said as he pulled on his father's fingers to steer him toward Tony, the Omega wondered if he could hightail it fast without the Alpha catching him, it would be bad if that Alpha thought he was going to steal his pup.
Me? I think I botched this chapter as I did to every chapter I update recently, I think it was on the rushed side and that the events don't line probably? T^T
"Papa, you are 'ere!" The pup squeals happily as he felt the Alpha's arms surrounding him in a hug after the Alpha sat on the bed.
Swallowing once more, Tony opened the door slowly, making sure not to make a sound as he slipped in. looking around, Tony let out a relieved sigh when he noticed that no one was in the room with him, this will give him time to search the archive before someone noticed that he was missing. Looking around the place, Tony quickened his steps as he went to search through the archive.
Tony put a sunglasses and start walking around his neighbor until he shrugged and took the bus to Manhattan, he didn't know why he wanted to go to Central Park exactly, but he just sighed and got out of the bus and start walking to reach the park, he was probably bored out of his mind, that's why he wanted to go to the park to get more bored, or maybe he was a masochist because going to the park meant seeing children and their parents, and Tony was a parent with a dead pup… it was probably the last choice, him going to the park to torture himself with something he wishes to have but won't get no matter how much his heart was pounding in his chest.
"Tony Stark." Steve answered getting a hum from his mother informing him that she was waiting for him to continue with his tale, and Steve was grateful that his Ma didn't make a big deal out of him loving a normal. "And… he hates me for being an Addams." Steve finally confessed, causing his mother to let out a sigh.
… Steve wanted to beg his husband to stop, he already humiliated him enough as it was, Steve knows that he was wrong too, but that didn't mean his husband has to overreact when he was the one who starts this chain, Tony lied to him about not having any work today so that the two of them can go to the doctor together, he promised him the two of them will have today to themselves. What Steve got was an absent husband who blamed him for his business meeting being ruined, a husband who abandoned him for the whole day and insulted and humiliated him in front of his brother; Steve could have handled this any day by brushing his husband's act away and try to explain to him what wrong they both did, but not today, not today, because… because…
"I… I brought you something…" Steve said, his happiness shifted into nervousness, which made the Omega's heart pound in his chest, part intrigue and another part scared, wondering what was the reason that turned his Alpha into this nervous mess. Steve though only pulled him to the sofa, and pulled Tony in his arms making the Omega shift until he was sitting sideways in the Alpha's embrace gazing at the man with big eyes waiting to see what was going to take place. "Here…" Steve murmured as he gave a covered book to the Omega, something that caused the Omega to raise his eyebrow at that.
They didn't stay on the floor as long as Steve thought, but it was long for the man to have finished his coffee and look like he was going to fall asleep which made the blond raise his brow, he thought the coffee would have alerted the man to forget about sleep, but Steve know for a fact that not everyone who drinks coffee is affected by caffeine, Sam, always tell Steve that he usually falls asleep faster if he drank coffee before bed.
J.A.R.V.I.S.'s words made Tony twitch even more, especially when Tony knew the name his parents choose to stay under the radar; Carbonell? Really? His mother's maiden name? No wonder no one found about them, who would have thought that the two of them would choose such a loosely name to hide under. "Prepare my suit, J, we are going for a hunt," Tony growled as he turned around stumping to his workshop, his mind already going through many painful ways of killing his parents and turning himself into an official orphan, fuck Howard! Tony knew that Howard would have done something like that, but he never thought that his mother was capable of doing such a thing and ignoring him when his near-death experiences were always podcast on TV daily.
It took a few minutes before Tony finally reached the house, getting out of the car, Tony couldn't help blinking his eyes as he took his home. It was the same as two years ago, nothing changed that much other than his vegetable garden getting run over by weeds, and looking around, Tony did notice that there were a few fruit trees around, still young, but obviously strong, all the same, it made Tony wonder when did Steven had enough time to plant them.
(See the end of the chapter for
The voice on the other end of the line made Sam give a tired sigh and start walking back toward his office. "Hey, do you want to go to Loki's tonight? I could use a drink… or two." Sam said making the line go silent for a little while.
"Please…" Steve remembers pleading with a shaky voice. "Please Buck… if you want to kill me just do it… please don't torture me anymore…" Steve sobbed beside Bucky's grave…
"So doctor, tell us the news," Tony asked, getting out of bed and ignoring how Steve tried desperately to get him back in bed; count on Tony to ignore his health and walk around the place after being admitted to the hospital not a few hours ago.
That was the joyful sound of his uncle Gomez made Steve smile a little, it had been years since the last time he heard the cheerful tone of his uncle; when he was young, Steve wished to have an amazing relationship like his uncle Gomez and aunt Morticia, and when he met Tony, Steve really thought he will have the relationship he always wished for, only for his hopes to dash. "Oh, I feel thousands of feet to my death only to survive and losing my left arm which was replaced by a metal one when Hydra took me as a POW, they tortured me for seventy years, turning me into their super-assassin that was credited with over a thousand hit, I was saved a few months ago by Bucky who survived being frozen in the arctic due to the serum." Steve deadpanned, waiting for what his family will say.
"You mean as well as livestock in his cell waiting for an unfair judgment." Steven snipped which made Heimdall pause in his walk and look at Steven with his golden eyes, Steven looked in the man's eyes with his blue ones, and he could see how the man's eyes widen every second Steven continued to gaze in his eyes without fear.
It was a few moments though before Peter starts squealing loudly and running to Steven to hug him tight. "Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! My lucky star is in our home! Daddy our lucky star is in our home!" Peter squealed loudly, not believing what he was told, holding to Steven's legs tightly while refusing to let go unaware that Steven was studying Tony who was in shock…
"All the news I read about, they only praise Rogers for his heroism and how he managed to expose Pierce, but that was not it? Those articles were just guilt-written words that were wrote in the hope of abasing the beast, was it?" Tony stated, leaning a little in his chair, his mind going over the articles he read and how perfect they nearly seemed, praising Rogers like he was a God, something that only happened after his death.
Day after day, he hated himself for being so envious of Pepper, the day she gave birth, Tony was waiting with Happy who so nervous that he was making Tony dizzy. When they finally went to see Pepper and her daughter Megan, Tony stayed by the door, refusing to enter the room, he refused to hold Megan when Pepper offered for him to carry her, that day he went home and nearly drank himself to death…
Rhodey rushed inside the workshop, his face pale and his eyes were terrified, probably planning on whisking Tony away from the ruins that were once called the Stark mansion. When Rhodey entered the workshop, though, he froze in his place as he took everything in, from the pink walls to the toys, to the dream of every girl under the age of thirteen, a contrast image to the horror that lay outside of the workshop.
If you are a horror fan, and like Stony/Stucky or Stuckony please go check my story 'The Rings' it contains lots of horror and heartbreak! Ha-ha...
Rhodey's eyes widen even more if that could have been possible, and the older man looked like he was one second away from a heart attack. "No… please tell me you didn't unknowingly agree to go out on a date with an Addams!?" Rhodey plea, and Tony's eyebrow twitch, how the fuck did Rhodey knew about 'Dating an Addams 101' while Tony was thrown in blind and deaf? "Oh God, you did! How the hell did that even happened? Didn't you say that you will die before you start dating once again after Ty?" Rhodey asked making Tony grumble his answer.
Tony closed his eyes, trying to banish the question in the far away corner of his mind… and maybe he wanted to learn a little bit about Rogers.
"Who? What do you mean by this? Who?" Stane shook him by his hair, but even then, Tony didn't react, he could only pray for his baby to be safe. When Stane didn't get the answer he wanted from him, he growled and push him back, making Tony stumble, trying to contain his flinch when Stane start shooting at anything that he saw moving, taking this as his only chance, Tony starts backing away, wondering which will be safer, his house or the raging lake. "Where do you think you are going?" Stane's enrage voice made Tony freeze in his place and he turned around to see Stane pointing the gun at him, which made Tony's heart drop.
It took three months later that Tony finally got the courage to get out of the house. It was not like it was something fancy, it was just that his birthday was tomorrow and he wanted to leave the house and explore the city, to see how much New York changed while he was away, it had been nearly half a year since he was saved from Obadiah, half a year of therapy and Martial arts with Steve, of meeting his friends every weekend and getting caught up on six years of pop culture with them. And as much as Tony was happy it didn't stop him from longing to go outside and interact with people, but the thing is, reporters still follow him around the place every time he went from his house to the clinic and the other way around; it was starting to get on his nerves! Especially when the only thing that Peter sees of the world is the Starks' mansion and the ground that surrounded it every day, his baby was getting bored, and Tony knows that, and he also knows that his baby was too polite to talk about wanting to see something new, afraid that if he did this calm life will change.
"I make the rules here, little Omega, I can choose to turn your people into slaves, you know I am sure that the brunette Beta woman will make a good living as a whore, the small girl can follow her footsteps too, the men will make a good addition to work in the fields, from dawn to dusk nonstop, the Omegas… I am sure some of my people will love to have someone who will warm their beds… it is an easy choice, do not make it hard on yourself, you and your son coming to work with me as my slaves, and I promise you that no harm shall befall your people, I will even provide a house and jobs for them they will be able to live from… or you can choose your and your son's freedom, you can finally return to your village, see your loved ones and enjoy the rest of your life in peace, I will even give you half of the gold we took from the Hydra kingdom… you can finally be free." The Alpha said gently, trying to make the Omega see reason here, trying to save him from a life of being forced to slave himself and his son just so he can save a few of Johann's slaves, promising half of the Hydra's kingdom treasure to the Omega was a little overboard, but the Alpha was going to think of it as a compromise for the Omega for staying with Johann's for years and being forced to have his pup… The Alpha nearly smirks in pleasure when he saw the doubt painting the Omega's eyes, and he knows that if he offered anyone this deal, they will take it without looking back, after all, no one was foolish to be forced to pay for crimes that weren't his.
Tony held the roses in his hand tightly, giving his father a nod, trying to stop the butterflies in his stomach from making him more nervous as he was. When the door opened, Tony's breath hitched as his eyes fell on his husband-to-be. Steve look so handsome in the suit he wore, causing Tony's heart to start racing in his chest; when Steve's eyes caught him, Tony knew…
That lead to where Tony was, here in SI, here with Steve in SI, here with Steve for his birthday party in SI… it was awkward to say the least, especially when Steve looked dashing in black. Steve as predicted was wearing a black suit, a black shirt, and a black-tie… practically a black everything; Steve's long hair was slicked back, showing his eyes, and handsome face, giving the assassin an irresistible look. Now, if Steve was a normal person like him, Tony would have abandoned the party a long time ago and jumped that piece of hotness not minding doing the do with him all night long. But because Steve is an Addams, (An Addams who kissed him without his permission at that) even the attraction Tony had for Steve was shadowed by a little fear, which made Tony refuse to take the first move to do something about the handsome man whose hand rested at the small of Tony's back since the start of the event.
Steve then rushed to the room closing the door behind him as he rushed toward the Omega, Tony was thrashing and screaming as he was having a nightmare, and when Steve touched his shoulder the Omega let an air-piercing scream which made Steve wince as he tried to wake the Omega up. "Tony please wake up!" Steve raised his voice a little as he let his pheromones loose trying to wake the Omega, after a few minutes of thrashing, the Omega finally opened his eyes which made Steve let a sigh of relief which vanish as soon as Tony starts sobbing and crying, Steve let out a sigh and he held Tony rocking him back and forth, shushing him gently which made the Omega whine.
It was nice in a way, the boat rocking him to sleep as he covered himself in warm blankets and enjoy the calmness. Sometimes when Tony was daring enough, he will go out to the middle of the lake when the sunsets; watching the sky being painted in the many shades of red, blue, purple, and oranges, then wait until the stars show up.
"Where have you been? I searched for you all over the place, didn't I tell you not to let go of my hand in new places?" The Alpha scolds his pup after putting him on the ground which only made the pup pout and looks down at his shoes.
Dammit, the author is sleep-deprived.
Harley's breath hitched and he turned around to call Peter once more only to see him running and laughing with Cooper and Lila running to the second floor and leaving Harley alone; a gasp left Harley's chest and he turned to see Mr. Tony and the strange woman causing Harley to swallow harshly and stood up, running toward the door and hoping to help Mr. Tony before that strange woman does something to him.
By the time he woke up, Steven knew he was shaken, he knew he won't get any sleep anymore, and he knew that this hunted image will be with him for the rest of his life, waking up, Steven turn his face to Peggy who was beside his bed trying to wake him up, and the blond man desperately hope that he didn't hurt the brunette, it had been years since Steven had nightmares this intense, years since he felt this drained, Steven sat on his bed and stood on his shaky legs leaving his bed, and from the corner of his eye, he saw all of the Avengers standing outside of his room, not knowing if they should enter the room or not, and Steven felt a little guilty for waking them up in the crack ass of dawn.
That question made the kid pause a little, which made Tony think of different scenarios for the kid's silence. "Mommy is working." The boy said then he nods his head as to confirm that, it made Tony pause a little and swallow.
"W-what did you do, Tony?" Steve's voice cracked as he said those words, and he only realized he spoke when the Alpha turned to him and blinked his eyes, grinning when his sight felt on his Omega.
"Guys, what the hell is wrong with you, this is a cat, C-A-T, cat, and a cute one at that, aren't you… Goose…" Tony cooed to the cat after reading her name on her collar, he saw how Steve was smiling happily at him and he tried to hide his flushed face by lowering his head to the cat. "They were so mean, weren't they? Calling you alien." Tony said which made the cat look at him then look at the table near them.
It wasn't like Tony didn't want to reach his baby, the thing was he can't; Tony was too frozen in his place to do anything but gaze at the person beside Morgan's crib with wide eyes. There standing beside Morgan was Steven Grant Rogers; Steven with his blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin, Steven who looked alive if not a little faded around the edge (Like mist surrounding him) Steven who was looking at him strangely before turning to Morgan like he was planning on picking her up from her crib.
"What did we miss?" That was Pepper, she was accompanied by Rhodey and Happy all of them holding so many presents and flowers; the three of them were late because Pepper and her mate had gone to the airport to give Rhodey a ride to the Stark mansion when they get the news that Tony had gone into labor at 1 a.m.
"Still worried about hurting me, Rogers?" Peggy smirks and he can't help but chuckle, tapping her arm. She releases him, rolling to her feet like a cat and tossing him a bottle of water in which Steven catches as he sits on the mat, taking a long drink. It's been decades since he's fought someone just for the sake of sparring and enjoying himself. Steven just throws Peggy a smirk, noticing that he did make her break a sweat, and he can tell already that's an accomplishment.
The sight of Peggy Carter standing on the other side of the door caused Tony to inhale harshly; his left hand automatically going to his belly as he remembered the encounter months ago; in the back of his mind, Tony couldn't help but wonder why it took Carter three months before she returned to their house.
"… I… l-love you…three thousand…" Steve whispered before swaying on his legs, the last trace of magic bending him to this body, finally left him, leaving Steve crumbling to the ground turning to stardust before he even landed on the floor underneath him, the last thing Steve heard before everything became dark was Tony's screams and cries of agony…
"Oh, really?" Tony raised his brow, a playful smirk on his face causing Steve to flash his fiancé a manic grin mirroring his. "You know… this wasn't really bad at all… I kinda enjoy it…" Tony hummed to himself trying to stifle a giggle before it gets out. Ah! So Tony was still riding the high of his first truly victims as an Addams, Steve couldn't even be prouder than he already was; his love was carving his place in the Addams family! "Tell your Ma that we can have the wedding next week… it would be fun." Tony let out a loose peal of laugh he couldn't hold in anymore, the sound of Tony losing it made Steve give a dark laugh of his own followed by a dreamy sigh…
By the time Steve's core collapse on its own, nearly all of the Chitauri were already dead, even some of the ships had fallen from the sky and landed in the battlefield. Steve though, knew that this was not enough, especially when Thanos was still struggling weakly trying to heal himself using the Infinity Stones… Steve heard the sound of something breaking inside him, and he closed his eyes tightly, as he felt his physical original body exploding in a supernova way, followed by the core in this body that held Thanos, sending shockwaves around all of Asgard and its sky and the space surrounding Asgard's realm.
"He is… with a child…" Braes's voice cracked as he whispered, realization painted his eyes, Braes' face was taken over by rage and he nearly turned to Hamar to finish what Starkad started, but thankfully the Beta was able to calm down and he turned to the Omega, knowing that saving the queen is more important than killing Hamar… everyone knows that not all Omegas can survive the shock their bodies go through if they received a fatal injury to the stomach while pregnant. "Starkad, take him to my hut, Bótey is there she will be able to stop the bleeding until I arrive, I will bring Petrus there shortly, I just need to send a word to Nattalegg and Klint, so that they will come and hold the Alphas until their trial." Braes send him a warning look when Starkad was about to protest.
"In here!" Tony called out from his place on the floor, waiting a few minutes for the rushed footsteps to reach him before raising his head from the book he was pretending to read to gaze at Maria, who upon seeing him seemed to relax a little and lose the harsh look on her face. "What is it, Maria? What was all that yelling about?" Tony asked as his brow rose followed by him letting the child book in his hands down, which cause Morgan to whine and move her arms in an angry fashion.
"I don't know what to do about this situation, Steve, it is hell, and I am afraid that I made everything worse, do you think I made everything worse? I don't know, Peter refuses to tell the truth and Harley is terrified that I would probably hit him or something just as bad as that… I knew you going to DC was a bad idea!" Tony whined ignoring the hum Steve let out from the other end of the phone.
' and sway a little before Steve managed to gather himself enough to hold his husband. "It seems that the reason for fainting was due to stress and being in an extreme situation; you really need to take more care of yourself, Mr. Rogers…" The doctor said a few more things, not that Steve or Tony were paying enough attention, not when both of them were lost and speechless.
The sudden change in the temperature caused Anton to raise his hand, stopping everyone from advancing any farther; Anton felt like something was watching, which made Anton feel trapped and uncomfortable, which his companions seemed to feel and express for themselves. "What is it, my king?" Tyber asked, only to get shushed by everyone as they looked around the place they were in, studying the trees to see if something was amiss.
Bucky's voice greeted Steve, causing Steve to sob in relief before flinching at the curses he heard outside of the bathroom. "Bucky… t-there is someone in the apartment, I don't know who but they broke in, please hurry up," Steve whispered shakily he wondered if this was his imagination and he was losing his mind or that someone really broke into the apartment, the growl and the slam of the doors made Steve flinch harder and hide in the tube behind the curtains, shaking as one of his hands went to touch his belly. At the end of the phone, the curses Steve heard made him shake, fearing that it was too late and that Bucky can't make it.
"God… this is a nightmare…" Steve choked, sobs leaving him as he hides his face in his hands, wondering what's the next step he will choose based on the dark reality that Bucky made him open his eyes for. The '
Until he felt his lungs burning, until he felt his body strain, until his breath was nothing but gasps, until his muscles protests... until his legs trip making Steve roll down the hill. Steve gave a groan of pain as he tried to sit, only to freeze as he saw Bucky standing before him, Bucky with his beautiful face that was as pale as death, Bucky who was wearing his blue coat, the last thing Steve saw him wearing, Bucky who didn't have his left arm… Bucky who was grinning at him, a dark look in his eyes, Bucky… Bucky who raised a bloodied knife… Steve didn't scream as the knife was thrust into his chest…
?' before tilting his head to the side, gazing at Tony like the genius just said something stupid, which was rude by the way. "But I didn't kill your parents when Hydra deployed me." Steve stated, which made Tony be the one who gave that dump 'huh?!' this time, because did Tony heard Steve right? Did that crazy Addams just say that he was ordered to kill his parents? "It happened seventeen years ago, I think? Hydra ordered me to kill your parents after leaving this Christmas party and make it look like an accident; before I killed them though, Howard asked to make a deal with me to let them live in exchange for his son's hand in marriage, who would have thought I would fall in love with you? I was planning to break our deal until I saw you in your tomb." Steve grinned happily purring in delight as he seemed to remember something pleasant.
Steve swallowed at the painful images of Peter and Tony getting hurt… Steve knew… he knew that if anything happened to Tony and Peter, he wouldn't survive this time, that his heart would completely break and all of his magic and shine was going to leave him for the rest of infinity. "Where are you planning on taking me?" Steve finally dared to ask, already steeling himself for what to come; Steve needed to ensure that his family, his lover, and the little boy he thought of as his son was going to survive.
Ohhh, the tension is rising!
"I will take of our son, I promise, just hang on, OK? Everything will be fine, just hang on." Tony's voice was cracked and breathless as he begged Steve to hold on, begging the love of his life to stay with him and Peter; Tony promised himself that when this is all over and Steve and Peter were alright, he promised he will finally do what he planned on doing years and years ago. Tony promised that he will take Steve and Peter away from here, away from New York and all the pain and hurt and Iron Man and the Avengers problems; Tony sower that he and his love and their child will settle in Ireland in Sarah and Joseph Rogers' house that he bought years and years ago, he promise all of that, he just needed Steve to fight and survive.
Bucky stood up in front of the house, blinking his eyes at what he saw, he remembered when he was young, maybe he was seventeen? He and Steve were so inseparable that their parents always talked about them ending up as mates, and fates seemed to take their sides when Bucky presented as an Alpha and Steve as an Omega… Bucky had hated himself so much every time Steve looked at him hopefully like the Alpha was going to ask him out any minute now, that hopeful look turned into a sad understanding that Bucky was never going to ask Steve out, that the two of them will never mate, that they will never live in a white fence house and have children and stay together until they were old and grey like how their parents always talked about. Bucky always hated himself for feeling relieved when he enlisted in the military, or when the Omega sent him a letter about falling in love with the Carbonell boy…
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course I will take you there Steve, don’t worry, where is Tony though? I thought he was going to take you and Peter to the hospital.” Bucky tried to start a conversation as he followed Steve who rushed to Peter’s room, hoping that his baby did what he ordered him and change into his shoes.
"I… let me remember baby…" Tony said closing his eyes to remember… once upon a time, when Tony was young, younger then now, Aunt Peggy gave him a jacket, a leather brown jacket and told him it was Captain America's jacket, and that she knew Tony will take good care of it; he remember when he wore it for the first time and the smell... "It was like being surrounded by warmth…" Tony said opening his eyes. "It smelled like… like a garden? I don't remember clearly but it smelled fresh… why did you ask that baby?" Tony questioned raising himself a little.
Steve smiled happily as he saw Natasha walking toward him when was the last time he saw the woman? A long time ago, so long that Steve had to stop himself from hugging the woman. "December 30th, 2050… or maybe it would count as 2051? Don't know." Steve hummed as he put the glass of water away, he didn't notice the shocked looks that were exchanged between his friends.
Tony was smiling all through breakfast, sending playful looks to Steve which the Omega only rolled his eyes at but an amused smile stayed on Steve's face as he went to serve his husband another cup of coffee, knowing that the Alpha will be grumpy all morning if he didn't drink his two-morning cups of Joe, which something that Steve always argued about with Tony, as he scolded him about his unhealthy coffee addiction.
"OK…" Tony said as he took a step back, planning on making a run for it because he can't, he just can't. "Please, next time, go and threat Steve, he was the one who refuses to let go of me." Tony stated as he made a run for it, ignoring Natasha's scream as she chases after him and ended up turning into a shoe-size spider halfway to his workshop.
. Steve wanted to say, scream maybe.
Steve heard someone call out, making him groan and try to open his eyes, which made whoever was in the room, with his talk in a frantic voice putting their hands on his shoulders trying to ease him into the soft mattress he was lying on. That made Steve opens his eyes then closes them, hearing voices talking above him. Steve tried to open his eyes one more time, and when he did his breath hitch in his lungs. "T…Tony…" Steve whispered brokenly raising his trembling hand toward the figure that was looking at him with a strange look…
Steve heard her sad said voice, and he sniffed at that whispering his 'Yes', he ignored his Avenger's badge that was going off like crazy beside him and look at the burning warehouse he was in, the glasses turn dark for a second then it start counting down from five making Steve smile and close his eyes as he heard the sound of the missile getting closer and closer toward his location.
The wedding resume like normal… if you mean by normal the Viking cheers and proud whistles the Addams family were letting out from their side, and the teeth grind and the killing intent from Tony's side; then yes, everything went pretty normal. It was only when they reached the part when someone objected that a little hiccup happened. If by a little hiccup meant that everyone on Tony's side, sane Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy (Who was crying his eyes out and saying
A shuffle from his left side caused Anton to turn around to see Fury gazing at Tyber with a narrow eye; Fury had never liked Tyber a day of his life, always doubting Tyber especially when he came back with the needed information from the Hydra king. If it was up to Fury, he would have probably killed Tyber on sight; this was why Anton tolerant Fury, the two of them see eye to eye on some things and agree on some others.
"Still, there must be some you can do as a counter back! An interview? A virus in his computer?" Rhodey asked, cooing when he saw a cute stuff doll dancing around; Tony though shook his head at how Rhodey seemed to be attached to the little terrors walking around, Tony didn't even react when the cute doll pulled out a small knife from somewhere and stabbed another doll who was crawling around making Rhodey jump back and let out a cry of denial at the action.
Steven Rogers-Barnes… they told him that was his name; what a joke, a few days ago his name was Steven Stark, so how did things change so much in the matter of a few seconds? What irks Steve so much was Bucky Barnes… Bucky Barnes who waltzed in his hospital room when he think that Steve was asleep; coming to sit beside Steve and take his hand in his to start with his round of apologies that never seemed to end. It makes Steve so angry, so helpless, and spiteful; Bucky Goddammit whatever-his-last-name-was was the one who T-boned his car, he was the one who killed his baby and destroyed his life with his husband… he was the devil that everyone took his side no matter what Steve said or plead with someone to hear his side of the story… Steve doesn't want the asshole near him in any shape or form, especially to apologize for something that was clearly his fault.
"Is that all or is there something else I should be aware of?" Steven asked through his grinding teeth, already knowing that the king gave him an impossible schedule to follow considering how big the house and the gardens are, especially the garden if it already has a stable in it, Steven knew that he will work before dawn even broke to Matins if he wanted to finish the work that the arrogant Alpha gave him, these kinds of chores need at least three other people with Steven to finish in time.
So what do you think?
"It was Peter's birthday…" Steve murmurs, which made Tony, blink. "My ex-mate went into labor so I took her to the hospital… I was there only an hour before May called me… she was hysterical, she was crying and screaming, I couldn't understand anything from her words, just that someone broke in and stole something… something important… I remember hearing the baby wailing in the background, and it was so different… like he was choking, or he was having one of his asthma attacks, I still wonder to this day why May didn't rush toward the baby… then… then I heard the sound of a car's screeching, followed by screams when I arrived at the scene, the police told me that Ben and the baby died, but May… May was still alive, but she hit her head so hard they don't know how severe the head injury was until they check it in the hospital… sometimes, I still wonder what was so important they allowed this to happen?" Steve whispered, already feeling Tony shaking in his arms, so he did the only thing he could do and hugged the Omega tightly…
The next time Steve woke up was to the sound of chattering in the background, he sighs through his nose in annoyance, he was tired and he wanted to sleep, something he didn't feel like in years and years since he took the serum, it ends with Steve opening his eyes to tell the person who was talking on top of him to shut up but when he opened his eyes the words he wanted to say left him as he saw Bruce and Tony talking to each other, and Natasha was standing with Peggy listening to Thor who was trying to explain something to them, Clint was there too, playing with an apple in his hand.
"Yes, you noticed, you noticed us until Stane. We were your family until Stane came into the picture. Jarvis was a family until Stane came, and then he was just the butler. Mom was your world until he came and then she was just an accessory you remember when you have to go to some awful party Stane wanted you to go to. I was your son until that fucker came and forces his visions on me, convincing you that he knew what I want when the only thing I ever wanted was to be a normal teen! When are you going to open your eyes Dad?" Tony screamed, making Howard look at his son with a shocked look. Tony wiped his tears away and huffed, he could already feel the eyes of every person in the place on them, just great.
"So finally you showed your face." Tony snapped as he stood up, carrying the pup with him frowning as at the redhead officer that was glaring at him. "Where were you when that fucker was going to kidnap the pup?" Tony nearly snarled glaring at the people hiding behind the officer wincing as the furious Omega hissed when the officer took a step forward. "Everyone with two brain cells and a nose can see that this fucker was not the pup's parent! Why the fuck didn't you do anything? Or was it because he wasn't one of yours?" Tony raged at the bystanders as he stalked toward the officer with a dark glare on his face, ignoring when the woman blink and looked at the man that was still lying where Tony left him looking at the Omega in fear, the people around them flinch at the scent of an angry Omega.
Tony could only gasp, his legs were shaking as he tried to stay still and not slide down the grey tiles; if Tony didn't know Howard's true intention, he would have agreed to go back home with the man, he would have agreed to be married to the highest bidder and live his life in misery if it meant his baby was going to be safe. Tony thought, he wasn't going to subject his daughter to live in fear, he wasn't going to let her be the sacrificing lamb who would get hurt every time Tony did something stupid or wrong. "Fuck. You!" Tony snapped, letting go of the window behind him as he slides down the tiles faster than he thought he would, crying out when he fell from the eaves into the bushes down below.
The day Steve returned, Natasha hugged him tightly than she steered him toward Peggy's office so he can go over the paperwork that was waiting, Steve spent his day in the office, approving and giving missions to the agents, he even appointed Pepper as the temporary CEO of SI, that day Pepper had stormed into his office questioning him about the news of Tony's return. She spent the day crying in his office, asking if she could come and see Tony, as much as it hurt Steve to do that but he told her she can't. he told her about the pup, about Tony being sedated half of the time this past week for attacking nearly everyone that came near him, he told her that it was not a good idea, that as soon as Tony and the pup gets better, he will make sure that Pepper was the first to see them. Pepper agreed in the end, with the promise of Steve updating her on Tony and the pup's condition every day.
"We thought… we thought about taking you Helheim… it is the only place that Thanos won't dare to cross." Gamora shuffled as she said those words; no doubt she was uncomfortable by saying these words, and why wouldn't she? Helheim was the realm of the dead and forgotten, the only place that Thanos hadn't dared to invade even with all of his power and might… after all, death is death, and people no matter who they were are always afraid of it. "Hela, the ruler of Hel agreed to give you a sanctuary, in exchange for Loki being cleared of all his crimes against Asgard." Steve could only nod his head at the words he heard but didn't manage to understand, the only thing Steve knew of was that he needed to leave Midgard.
"Is Betty here?" Tony asked getting a nod from the Omega as she gave Tony directions to the staff room, making the Omega hum at that. "I will talk to you later, Darcy." Tony said as he walked toward the staff room waving for the Omega, sending concern looks to Peter and Steve, the Alpha was crooning to the pup, and kissing his forehead which made Tony's heart flutter at the scene before him.
"W-what…?" Steve asked after he got himself together which made the Alpha frown at him and sigh at Steve while shaking his head like he was talking to some idiot, it made Steve stand on defense.
"Fuck off, Stane, fuck off!" Tony screamed and drops to the floor being careful with his belly. He gives the board a firm whack with the hammer before scrambling on his hands and knees to where the loose floorboard is jutting out, the exposed nails on its undersides like sharp little teeth and Tony pushed it down, slotting it into place between the other boards and hammers each nail back into place, his ears filled with the thundering of his own blood, his heart pounding staccato-fast.
When Steve finished the tests he left the room only to see Howard waiting for him, which made Steve swallow and stood in front of Howard, waiting for what the older man was going to do. Howard looked at Steve with cold and empty eyes, it made the other Alpha tense, ready to receive the hits his friend was going to lay on him, but the other man just sighed from his nose and turn toward Steve. "The day I found Tony's journal, I was in his room, I couldn't believe that my beautiful and smart son was lost forever, I just couldn't." Howard swallowed at that, trying to collect his thought. "I read the whole journal in one day… there was a map in his journal, he talked about the possible location that 'Captain America' may be buried in… there was only one dot on the map, with the words 'He is trapped in a mountain of ice' I never knew what it meant, but his seventeenth birthday was coming, so I did what Tony wrote, I went toward that dot and searched for that mountain he talked about, and behold, there you were." That made Steve fidgets, looking at the floor in shame, not knowing what to do. "He wrote at the end of his journal about the voice he continued to hear, never know what it was until you talked about it today…. I will only say this one time Rogers, if you hurt my son or his pup, I will bury you under the same ice I found you in, understood?" Howard's voice cracked, in the end, making Steve look at his friend with determent eyes.
Steve grunt as he started to wake up, his head was killing him, and his body hurt; for a second Steve tensed when he felt someone snuggling into his back, only for Steve to relax when he remembered that the person behind him was no other than Tony, who was holding Steve and refuse to let him go.
"Yes, Mrs. Rogers?" Tony questioned in a polite tone, tilting his head to the side waiting for the Alpha to say what she came here to say, wanting desperately to have a good day without someone turning his mood sore more than it already was, considering that he was still sad that his father didn't make it, or maybe he didn't want to show up, after all, Tony did brush him away for more than two years and a half, when all his father wanted to do, was explaining things to him.
What do you think about another Addams family AU? This time Tony is the cute Addams who tried to scare Steve and fail, as for Stevie… he is just in love with the cute kitten trying to get a reaction out of him.
A few months later when he was on a mission, after he begged and begged Howard to reclaim his place as the CEO, so Steve can finally go to missions again. Howard sighs but gives a tired smile to Steve, and gives him a paid vacation… he wasn't going to lose his best CEO just because Steve got cold feet… Howard's words, not him. So after months of absent Steve was finally going on a mission, this time Peggy had asked him to take Natasha and Clint with him, to see how the two of them will act if they worked together.
When it seemed like the fight between Bucky-doll and the spider won't end, Serpentine sighed and roll her eyes, going to the door and knocking it down, which got her a moan from inside the bathroom, and more choking and hacking coming from Bucky and the spider when the aroma of disgust, swamp, and misery was released… Ah, it reminds her of her youth!
The queen only gave a mysterious smile at that question before a frown took over on his face, tilting his head as he tried to listen to the sounds of nature that were coming from all around them; the frown on the queen's face was replaced by a mischievous look, causing Anton to feel uncomfortable at the conspiring gaze he was at the end on. "By the way, foolish king, it seems that one of the Stone's siblings is coming this way, if you do not want them to catch you, you better hurry and leave this place." The queen advised before turning away and started walking toward the direction of the town, leaving Anton freezing in his place. It was when Anton heard a branch being stepped on that the Alpha took his clothes and start running away, the thought of one of the Stone's siblings catching him nude made him sick…
"It's just a drink! 'm not even that drunk!" The man defended as he tried to take a step toward his husband, and in the back of Steve's mind, he had to admit that he was impressed with how collected the man was in his speech. "Sorry babe, come on…" Tony said as he pulled Steve toward him and tried to kiss his lips only for the Omega to turn his head away.
It was only a few seconds of walking before the Alpha finally spotted Tony, and his heart pounded with happiness as he rushed toward the Omega, hoping to explain to him and tell him that he was sorry for what he had been forced to hear, that they would find a way to solve the problem, and that Stane wouldn't leave unscathed. Before the Alpha opened his mouth though, the Omega whirled around until he was facing him with wild eyes, making the blond take a step back; fear rose inside of him at the look he was getting, the hair on his body tensed when the Omega's eyes connected with his and he saw the dark glee in them.
For a full year, the Starks and Peggy lived in the shadows... After Steve had awakened from the ice it seems like Howard had made Steve his successor and partner in SI which by default made him the CEO after his 'death', something that didn't help but made Steve felt like he stole that place from Howard's son. In his time as CEO Steve and Howard agreed on changing SI direction from a weapon making company into a company that's only business was in clean energy and other useful inventions… this change in heart, was because Howard had found his son's old journal, he read how his son wished that his father will get out of this war business, how Tony didn't want to be a 'Merchant of Death' how his son wanted to work with clean energy and create a useful designs that helped people instead of taking lives. That made Howard change the direction of his company to a road that will make his son proud of him… he hoped.
"This is the first time you refer to him as a son, quite the upgrade don't you think?" Steven said as he walked around Odin and continued on his way, finally seeing Thor who was getting out of his room with a fresh and clean set of clothes. "Thor, where is Loki?" Steven asked sharply which made the thundered jump a little and pointed to the door in front of him which made Steven nod his head at that and went to the door, knocking on it in three sharp knocks before opening the door, seeing Loki sitting in the small chair in his room, chains surrounding his legs and arms. "Loki." Steven said as he felt Odin and the rest of the party behind him stop inside of the room.
"So how are you holding up?" The doctor asked him after she gave him a sheet of paper to give to the secretary to make another appointment.
"I can't believe it! How… why… ugh! You and I will have a long chat when I am done here, I will make sure to kill both of you and Jarvis! Traitors who refuse to tell me anything until the last minute!" The Beta huffed as she tapped her leg, sending a harsh glare to Tony who hides behind Peter and Steve, which made the Omega send him a disbelieving look, though the giggle Peter let out, was worth it.
His father seemed to finally catch up to him, and Tony didn't know what to think about that piece of information; it was a year, nearly a year since Tony ran away from home, away from the nightmare that was Howard Stark. If Tony had to guess how Howard seemed to catch up to him, Tony would suspect Stane, after all, the man did fine him and nearly killed him if it wasn't for Rogers saving him and his baby. The man probably told Howard about this place and when he disappeared for months Howard finally confirmed Stane and his suspicions.
"What the fuck is wrong with you? Let him go!" Steve had screamed as he tried to pull one of the doctors away only for the huge Beta to push him aside.
That was until the older man told him that he was part a mutant, that his father was a mutant while his mother was a normal human being, that his mutant power came from him being able to live longer, that he was hard to kill, that he was actually born in 1888, it made Steve stunned, that he wasn't the only one that was out of time, it made him glade somehow, but it also made sense. How Fury survived when Hydra sent the Winter Soldier after him, how he was able to survive so many wounds that could have killed a normal person if he wasn't super. It all made sense and he was glad for that, but he was also sad that Fury didn't take the time out of his day to go out and find someone to be here with him, Fury will always pause at that and say that he didn't have time.
Which was a mistake as he was asked a question after question like no tomorrow, but thanks the lord for Peggy because if she wasn't there, he was sure he would have flipped the table he was sitting near at the reporters who were like sharks who smelled blood, asking a dozen question every breath they took… but Steven, he was a showman as much as his husband was, being in the USO made sure of that, and being the husband of the late Tony Stark, made him hound his skills of smiling at the camera and waving his hands.
That's how Rhodey and Pepper found them, with Tony laying on the ground with a book in his hand and Morgan sleeping peacefully on his chest. "Awe! Stay still, don't you dare move Tony!" Pepper whispered/hissed as she took a camera out of her person; snapping picture after picture of Tony and Morgan. That action pulled a chuckle from Tony who put the book away and shuffled until he was sitting up, Morgan held securely in his arms.
Tony didn't know what took over him, but he ends up in Steve's embrace holding tightly to the Alpha, trying to keep his sobs quiet last he woke his baby who was dozing happily in the Alpha's arm…
1992, Peter fell sick, and Steve finally rescues Tony and his son…
Ok so in chapter three, I explained the timeline as much as I can, but now I decided to make a few little changes, instead of the Avengers arc taking place in November instead it will take a place in September, for plot reasons of course!
… Tony's mind whispered, unsure if that was the truth or not, but it was the same mind that was whispering and chanting that this was not real, that this shouldn't be happening, that Tony was losing his mind.
"Yeah, well, I'm not Bucky, I don't know how you did it in the dark ages, but things are different now." Tony stated, pulling his hands away from Steve. "With how crazy you are, I wonder how the serum worked with you being messed up in the head." Tony muttered to himself, testing how his legs were able to hold him as he starts walking trying to find a way out.
"Don't you dare stand for him Barnes; this is between me and Stark!" Steve snarled at that causing Bucky to press his lips tightly at that. "The whole fucking day! The whole fucking day Peter was waiting for you outside, jumping at the sound of any car that got close to our house thinking that it was you! You could at least have the decency to call, but what did you do? What did you do Stark?" Steve screamed at the Alpha making him look down and mumble his answer, and Bucky felt his heart tug at that, how the confident Alpha was reduced to nothing by Steve… something that Bucky never thought the Omega will do considered that he hated bullies, but now... now Steve was acting like a bully. "That's right; you went to play Superhero with your fucking friends, leaving your son cry himself to sleep." Steve said darkly which made Bucky snap at that, especially when he smelled the scent of misery and pain coming from Stark… he knows that Steve will regret this when he cools down, and this was enough… this is enough…
“I wished to… inform you of something.” Tony responded with a hesitant smile, fretting when the woman's intense blue eyes landed on him, but Tony regain himself and give the woman a joyful grin. “Steve asked me to marry him, and I-“ Tony couldn’t even complete his speech, he was cut by the sound of breaking china, which caused him tense, when his gaze shifted to Sarah to see her eyes so wide and the teacup is broken on the floor.
"Yeah, it doesn't matter, water under the bridge and all that jazz, all forgiven, OK?" Tony waved his hand, wondering why Steven was looking at him with this strange look, that was making Tony's skin tingle, and he doesn't even know if it was a bad tingle or a good tingle.
"Yes, he used to beg me to make it for his birthday, every year… wouldn't eat it if it wasn't on the day of his birth." Jarvis said with a chuckle making Steve smile at that.
"Can you tell me about Peter?" Tony ends up saying which made the Omega look at Tony, and the Alpha had to stop his rumble of pride when he saw a small smile taking over Steve's face…
But the Omega didn't care about that, as he snarled and attacked the Alpha who hurt the babe, punching him in the neck which made the man choke and fall down, trying to catch his breath desperately. Six against one, was never a fair fight, especially when they didn't target him alone, but also two pups, one inside of his womb and another that was trying to protect him, but was getting hurt because of that, and Steven was thankful that his babe wasn't here with him, lest he did something to protect him and got hurt badly.
"He must be an important someone." The king ended up saying after a while of silence, looking at the Omega up and down before a dark smile took over his face. "Your freedom for theirs, Aye? Fine I will take your deal; for your sake, I hope your son knows how to clean well." The Alpha said which got him a snarl from the Omega.
Unfortunately, Steve couldn't come with him, having to stay an extra time with his boss Fury, the man was scary, Tony will admit, but he seemed so happy last time Tony saw him; Tony believed that it was because of the new comic that his fiancé was working on, but until this day, Steve refused to tell him what it was, stating that it was a surprise.
So while Tony was still in the Enemy/Lover zone, Steve still never trusted him fully with Peter, something that as much as it broke the Alpha's heart, the Alpha understood, because, for Peter, he was nothing but an inventor and a superhero, just an idol, not even a friend… he was just Uncle Bucky's packmate… as for Steve, the Alpha was nothing but heartbreak and possibly the person who destroyed his life, and probably he was just another heartbreak waiting to happen, something that as much as Tony hated to think about, he knows that it was true to some extent.
It was two days later that Tony finally dared to go to see Steve, mainly because he was afraid that the Omega will carve his eyes with a plastic spoon and never allow Tony to see his son after the stunt Howard did, though he still took pleasure in the black and purple nose that Howard was sporting because damn! The Omega only doubled his punching power since the last time he saw him, it made Tony shiver at the possibility of Steve saving that punch for him, he really should thank his lucky stars that Steve didn't punch him… yet.
What made Steven's eyes widen wasn't the face behind the mask, for Steven had known for forty years that the Winter Soldier was his best friend and brother; no, what made anger course through him was the black bruise on his jaw and the blooded mouth, the flaming hot anger nearly leashed out, and Steven felt the beast inside of him sang, calling for blood and death, and Steven's know that nothing short of the wail of anguish and suffering from his enemies will appease his desire for vengeance.
The first day of physical therapy was a nightmare of its own; Steve could only grunt and hiss as he tried to move his muscles for the first time on his own in seven years (As all the doctors like to say) apparently Steve was recovering well and faster for a patient who was in a coma for a long time all thanks to his husband who spent the last seven years taking care of him and helping him exercise his body; that thought alone made Steve's blood boil, the thought of Barnes touching him while he was asleep and defenseless nearly summon a snarl out of him.
"I don't know, are you sure you can handle me?" Steven asked, worrying about hurting Peggy. She only gave him a challenging and mysterious smile, which made the blond step in the boxing ring, sending a challenging smile.
The Viking Chief demanded as he took a step after step toward Steven, Steven could hear the people's choked sob as they were dragged by the Vikings who made a way for their king to stand in front of Steve, gazing down at his eyes, and smirking when the Omega glared at him. Steven inhaled deeply, this was his chance. If there is any way he could save his son and friends, then he would take it, consequences are damned.
"What's his name, the young master starts screaming as soon as he saw us, didn't calm down until everyone was out." Jarvis said which made Steve sigh in sadness and look at the small pup pulling him into his embrace to calm his squirming.
"Let me go! Let me go you fucker!" Tony screamed, his terrified gaze refusing to leave the gun that was pointing to his baby, causing his breath to hitch. "Let me go!" Tony's screams get louder, and Tony swears that his words were echoed by a growly voice, but went unheard because of the howling winds.
Tony watched as Natasha and Clint collect up their things, Natasha leaving the bag with the remaining food and orange juice in the kitchen, glaring at Tony as she ordered him to eat. Natasha and Clint said their goodbyes and head back up the trail, Tony watching as Natasha ordering Clint to move fast so they will be able to bring the mattress faster.
"He looks like someone you know, doesn't he?" Howard teased causing Tony to pout and send his father an annoying glare, which only gained a chuckle from the older man as he went to check the garlic bread in the oven. "Tony, I can already see how an amazing life that kid is going to have; the four of you have been bonding for over a year now, and Steve told me that Harley adores you, everything is going to be fine." Howard smiled, causing Tony to hum and lower his head, his lips twitching up in a smile despite himself.
God, his husband looked handsome in the morning, with all the sharp lines relaxed and the sun falling on him from the window, giving him a golden halo. His husband; a word that Tony will never get tired of saying, a word that every time Tony thought of, he had to stop himself from squealing like five years old.
"I'm sorry Bucky." Steve finally dared to say which made Bucky purse his lips, gazing at Steve for a long time before sighing and grumbling to himself when he saw the earnest look Steve was sending him, crossing his arms and sending Steve a knowing look.
That's why Steven can't be what he used to be, that's why Steven refused to be called by his true name. A useless and weak person like him has no right to be called by his birth name, not when he failed his mother, not when he failed his fiancé, and not when he failed his children. Steven will never respond to his real name, not when he wasn't worthy of being called by it ever again, especially after he let Johann name him and bond him and shackle him to the south.
"H-he… he killed m-my baby…" Steve sobbed, shivering as every sob he let out wrecked his body, the memories of Bucky crashing into his car was still as clear as crystal in his mind. "W-where is Tony? W-where is my husband?" Steve asked, wanting to know where was his husband when he needed him, wondering how his husband would leave him alone with Bucky when the man killed their daughter in cold blood.
"Steve…" Tony thankfully didn't stutter and embarrassed himself more than he already did, which was fate if he saw any. "Here, I got you this…" The Alpha said as he showed the Omega the flower bracelet he got him, and Tony can see the Omega's eyes widen a little when they fell on the Forget-Me-Not, Steve looked at the Alpha for a few seconds, before looking at the flowers, extending his hand slowly to take the flowers, touching the petals gently when the bracelet was secured in his hand.
"The ones who will execute the punishment are Loki and Thor, for the Omega that was hurt was one of their people." Starkad stated, which made Loki gaze at him with narrow eyes that soften as he nodded his head in thanks, followed by Thor who was grinning in a feral way as gazing at Hamar with hunger in his eyes, which made the man shiver and sob. "As for dear Hamar, tell me, which hand did you use to stab the Omega, hmm?" Starkad asked with a curious tone, which made the lesser Alpha shiver and shake his head, a plea shining in his eyes as he gazed at Starkad. "Which hand?" Starkad snarled, which gazed the kneeling man to whine pathetically and show Starkad his right hand, which made the Alpha smile like a feral beast. "Will then, it is of no use to you after today." Starkad gave Jamti a nod, causing the man to walk forward and take his ax from his belt, which caused Hamar to shriek and try to scramble away, only to be stopped by an arrow pointing to the back of his head, which informed everyone that Klint will make Hamar suffer worse than just his punishment if he dared to move again, when Jamti secured Hamar's hand he swung his ax in one swift move, cutting Hamar's hand, which caused Hamar to shriek and cry in pain, as he held his stump, trying to stop the blood from flowing. "Everyone! Standing in front of you now is an outlawed, he is no longer one of us, everyone who dares to help him will be punished in the same way he was. Klint, if you will please throw him out of the village." Starkad ordered, which caused the Omega to give a dangerous smile as he gazed at the moaning man who was shaking.
The third and final time he woke up, thankfully he wasn't sedated, so that provided him the opportunity to take in the barren room he was in; raising his head to see why he couldn't move his arms, glaring darkly when he noted that not only he was naked and that the sole item of clothes on his body was his suit slacks, but also his hands were bound; a few tugs to the shackles informed him that he could break free from them, but if he did that, then whoever kidnapped him won't show up, and that will leave Steven with more question than he needs, especially with his kidnapper having a powerful enough sedative that was able to knock him out, no sedative was strong enough to work on him, and the last one that work was fifteen years ago and it only knocked him for ten minutes before his body became resistant to it.
"Will you go out with me on a date then? No torture involved this time! I promise! You can be the one who plans the date and I won't say no to any part of it!" Steve said, his words causing Tony to stop in his place, thinking and rethinking about Rogers's offers. In the end Tony shrugged his shoulder, already knowing he was doomed from the start, at least then there was no torture involved in any future date…
"Vu are not zubozed to pe here; vu are zubozed to pe
Her words may not be understood, but the dark tune she used was enough to send the message.
Steve's eyes widened, the two of them continued dancing as they gazed at each other, studying, waiting; Steve seemed like he found what he was searching for because a huge smile painted his lips. "Thank you," Steve whispered with a joyful and relieved voice, causing Tony to turn his eyes to Steve once more, only for them to widen when he saw how bright Steve was shining, and how big his smile was… it was this moment than ever that Tony was proven to that Steve was a divine being and that Tony was pulled into his orbit.
So after a lot of instruction from Braes (Who still doesn't know that Steven used to be a healer, he has to, or he would have died at the hands of Hydra king a long time ago), and glaring darkly ordering him to rest and not do anything (Mainly directing his glare at the foolish king, who looked sick and tired, not that Steven cared about him or anything). Steven was finally released to go home, or as much as you can call it home with it being your prison and the place of this idiot king.
There Tony was getting lost between two choices, one was walking around the edge of what's going to become a lake once it rains, and the other was going through that lake-to-be, but unfortunately for Tony, it seems that all of his luck has left him today for no reason, the ground under him shook and broke off and because of that it ended with him falling, which by the way made him give a girlish scream, and Tony has to say that today was not one of his proud days, he spent the whole time screaming, much to his discomfort.
But what scared Tony was how the man said he will handle his teammates if they objected, like Tony's opinion was forfeited in this whole affair, which kinda made him a little mad that the man would immediately turn toward his friends thinking that their opinions matter without asking him for his permission, Tony was thirty-five for fuck's sake! He wasn't a fifteen years old girl that needed her father's permission to date someone, he was an adult!
!" The snarl in the woman's voice made Peter whine.
Harley seemed to pause at Tony's words, shifting in his place before nodding his head, a blush taking over his face causing Tony to chuckle and offer his hand to Harley, waiting until the boy gathered himself enough before taking Tony's hand, walking beside Tony when the Omega went to introduce him to Howard, who finally get out of the kitchen only to pause when his eyes fell on Harley.
"Oh honey, is this all for me?" Tony asked, grunting when Steve took hold of his cock; Tony turned his head to the side kissing Steve's neck, it was a few seconds later before Tony starts running his hands through the slick, letting out a moan when the scent of his aroused mate became stronger and stronger.
She wasn't aware of the eyes that were watching her, and when the lightning lit the room once more, the shape of a person sitting on the ceiling could be seen, and it was looking at the woman with wide red eyes, taking her in. Natasha turned around fast when she felt eyes on her, but she didn't see anyone in the kitchen no matter where she looked, the lights start flickering on and off, making the woman's breath speed up and she gulped… what was going on?
Tony could never gaze at any spider normally after that, always narrowing his eyes at them, wondering if they were a poor soul that Steve trapped into that breakable body. The third surprise… Tony prefers to never ever talk about it, ever! All he can say that it contains Clint mixed with a slim monster that is it, that's the whole story. Tony will admit though after he managed to run away the whole encounters became funny stories he told Dum-e while he giggled to himself, but even if it was funny to some degree…
Tony admit that it was fun, he was happy, overjoyed with how his babies opened up to him; this trip Steve took, proved to Tony that he can and he would take care of both Peter and Harley if the need arise or if Steve was too busy to be available. Considering that today was the start of the weekends, Tony was trying to think of a fun activity to do with the kids who were playing at Clint's house.
"You look nervous," Howard stated beside Tony, helping him cut the potatoes for tonight's dinner; his father's words made Tony pause in his place before fidgeting and continuing to steer the stew. "Steve told me that everything was going alright, so you don't need to worry, you know that, right?" Howard stated, his words causing Tony to sigh and nod his head.
"No, I didn't, Peggy didn't tell me about it either." Tony walked around, touching the art on the walls, humming as he sat on the blue matters, sneezing when the dust float all around the place. "We need to clean this place up." stated Tony as he sneezed once more, causing Rhodey to open the window, hoping to air the room before Pepper and Morgan showed up. "The Rogers family, the one who owned the house, Peggy told me about them having a son who was always sick and couldn't leave the house; probably his parents made this room for him before he died…" Tony's words trailed as he went to check over the corner that had books glued to the walls as if they were
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
"He is my son, of course, I will help my family; who are you to decide instead of me!" Tony snapped letting out a growl as he took a step toward Barnes, that display made Bucky smile and he hummed at that, snatching his phone from Tony before the Alpha destroys it.
which made fear take hold of him.
"I am sorry for your loss sir, I may only have known him for a few days and he was a great man… We don't know each other that much, we only talked for two weeks and I asked him to drop a letter for me, so why would Dr. Erskine mention me in his will?" Steve asked in confusion as he took the papers from the older man.
Stay tuned for the next part of the date!
Tony's eyes were wide as he took in Stane's words; his breath was erected as he tried to make sense of what Stane just spit at him. It can't be, it just can't, it can't! Ty was just a ghost from his imagination, he wasn't real, he wasn't! If Ty was real then Angie, Natasha, Clint, Bucky, Peggy, or any Goddammit one in the town would have pointed that to him; they would have looked at him and told him Ty was real. "There is no one in the town by the name Ty, so you are probably wrong." Tony stated, feeling a little pride when his voice didn't break and show Stane how affected he was, unlike his brain that nearly stopped working.
"I am not weak…" Tony said in the last offer so he would be able to ditch the therapy, but it seems like it was of no use as the Captain just throw him a knowing look and smiled.
"Mama…" His son moans making Tony jump and takes his little hand.
"We were going to tell you, Tony! We just didn't know how; we never could trust anyone with the secret, not after… not after the day the government came for Rogers." Natasha said, shuffling a little before walking the last few steps toward Tony and sitting beside Tony on the swings, letting out a sigh when Tony shuffled away from her, resuming his gaze at the lake.
In 1988, Steve was awakened from the ice…
Steve moved quickly, crashing his lips with Tony's causing his Alpha to grunt in surprise, but Tony didn't seem to mind as he starts kissing Steve as fervently as Steve did. They navigated their way through the office, stumbling every now and then but refusing to part. By the time they'd made it to the sofa, their kiss had turned into something more hungry and urgent. Steve took Tony's bottom lip between his teeth, surprising the Alpha. He used that chance to push Tony backward onto the sofa. Tony looked up at him, somewhat shocked and aroused at the same time, making Steve smile and bit his lower lip.
"How many times did I tell you not to run away? Do you want me to tell your Mommy about you misbehaving?" The woman said which got a pout from the pup that was looking at the ground.
Tony sang under his breath as he took Steve’s folded shirts, placing them in their place, ready to turn around until something strange caught his eyes. It wasn’t actually something significant, nor was it visible, it was just Steve’s leather jacket, even Tony didn’t recognize what the different thing that captured his eyes, after all, he saw that jacket over and over repeatedly, he even asked Steve to wear it for him a few times, because he loves the way his Alpha looked in it.
Steve’s heart pounded in his chest as his eyes fell on his lover; he wanted to run toward his Alpha and hide in his arms, hoping that the Alpha will hold him until all this was over. Steve saw Tony gaze at his house, and then at all the people surrounded it from police, reporters, and passers, and something in Steve didn’t sit right, he felt like something was wrong. The snarl that Tony let out when his eyes fell on the dead body being dragged caused Steve to feel chilled to the bones, for even with the metallic voice in the suit, the message was clear; his Alpha was out for blood.
So I was thinking…
"That doesn't matter right now; tell me Bucky, you and Tony fought last night, right? Tony came home late and drunk last night, you fought with him, and after that, I fainted, didn't I?" Steve asked, desperation coloring his voice, and fear start taking hold of his when Bucky threw him a confused and startled look, then he turned to gaze at Tony with an uncomfortable look on his face, like he wanted to be anywhere but here, and Steve felt his heart drop to his stomach at that.
It was noon when Jarvis brought the cake and drinks, which made Peter Wow and jump around the place, ordering Tony to hurry up when Jarvis told him that Tony is going to cut the cake, all in all, it was fun and the cake was delicious, they spent the time joking around and laughing, all the while with Peter acting like the birthday boy, which made Tony happy that his baby was all that excited and happy.
The day his beloved had taken her life, she was eighteen, after three miscarriages, and enough abuse, his beloved couldn't handle it, he remembers her standing on the windowsill wearing her nightgown as she looked at the sky calling his name over and over again, she was smiling as she took another step and another, and Steven as much as he didn't want to watch, he couldn't take his eyes away, he couldn't let his beloved do this alone… Anton, Tonton, and Antonette, how much can Steven handle before his light is forever dimmed?
Steve wheezed as he moved his hand toward one of the pockets his suit, just moving his hand hurt, he got the glasses out of his suit thankful that it didn't break in the fight, and maybe he should be thankful that the glasses were made from the same metal as his Shield, and was self-repair. "E…e-Edith…" Steve wheezed out, giving a weak cry when a wrong move made his broken rib press into his lung, though he continued his mission and wore the glasses activating it.
"That… that… ugh! Tony, we got to do something!" Pepper who was sitting beside him with a stack of paperwork growled, her hands twitching as she heard the annoying voice of Hammer spewing more insults at Tony and SI. The Avengers, Bucky, and Natasha (Who were frowning darkly at Hammer's insulting the Avengers) Bruce (Winced at the few japing words that Hammer said about the Hulk), and let's not forget Rhodey who was hissing and cursing at Hammer like it was a horse race. The worst thing of all was that Tony couldn't even disagree with Hammer claiming him to be insane, not when he was going to marry an Addams.
"P-please Steve, a chance is all I am asking…" Tony's voice cracked as he said that, putting the cup down, making Steve close his eyes at that. "A chance to be in your and Peter's life once more, please Steve, this is all I am asking for… if you hate it after that… if you want me gone after that I will, I will go away and never return… just please." Tony plea with Steve hoping that the Omega will give him a chance, hoping that his father didn't destroy his only chance at happiness because of his bitterness, hoping that Steve wouldn't judge him and kick him out for Howard's actions.
So the three of them were now on the spying mission Peggy assigns to him, and Steve was going to rip his hair out. Why? Because Natasha and Clint just won't stop bickering! No matter how much Steve shushed them, glared at them, throw stones at their forehead… they just won't stop! So after finally finishing their mission and heading down to Shield by a miracle, Natasha and Clint finally calmed down after Steve snapped at them for the twentieth time.
"You are not bothering me at all sweetheart, I will be really happy to get to know you; Peter told me you are super smart and love science, which is super exciting because I have been looking for a small scientist to help me with my inventions! Peter doesn't seem to enjoy bothering me in the workshops anymore." Tony pout, which gained him a giggle from Harley, who tried to stop himself before letting out another giggle, the display caused Tony's heart to pound happily in his chest, because he made the little fella smile.
The two pups were so shocked that they needed a few more minutes before gathering themselves and when they finally did the two of them pouted. "You said he will not notice us, Petrus," James stated, a familiar frown on his face that Anton was sure if he tilted his head and close one of his eyes, he would see the queen frowning at him… good to know that James inherited the scary frown from his dam.
Bucky said after Yinsen asked him about that Steve who made Bucky's eyes sparkle, hearing that made Tony's heart stop, he thought that the battery attached to him had finally run out and that he was dying.
It took them two extra days to reach the land, and in those days, Steven made sure to spend talking and teaching his friends a little about what they to expect in his people's lands, not knowing if he will be granted the chance to meet them once again when they were finally inland, so Steven taught them about his people's ways, how to not offend them, how to deal with their currency, the kind of food they eat, they kind of people they have, how to just lower your head and ignore arrogant warriors, how to never ever walk alone in the village but in a pair of two, last someone got the idea that they can torment them because they were slaves of the Hydra king… all the while he taught his son what to do and how to clean something, how to rush to him or Margaret and their friends if something happened, thanking the Gods when his smart baby just nodded his head and took everything in.
Tony sighed to himself as he took a sip from his orange juice, smiling a little as he saw the pups running around the place squealing and laughing, playing whatever game entered their mind, Tony hummed a little only to pause as he heard someone screaming his name, and then once again something small run into his legs and hug him tightly, looking down Tony's jaw nearly fell on the ground, because there was… "Peter….?" Tony asked which made the pup look at him with a happy grin that caused the Omega to smile despite himself. "What did we say about running away like this?" Tony scolds gently as he ruffled the pup's hair which made the pup laugh at that and steps back, only then Tony noticed the toy in his hands.
"As you wish, Mr. Carbonell, I will drive then." The woman said as she stood up, Tony following her not that far behind a smile made itself home on his face as he could do nothing but hope, happy that he finally made a life for himself and his baby, away from the pain and hate and fear…
"You know why I am here." Steven said gently as he set in the seat Loki pointed toward, both of them ignoring then rest of the people who made themselves comfortable in Loki's room without his permission which made the dark hair man scrunch his nose at that.
Anyways! A little bit of information on the timeline of this story to help anyone if they got confused; like me when I wrote this chapter.
"My queen!" Margaret gasp as she rushed inside the room, letting out a sob when she saw him leaning on the wall behind him, the tears in her eyes caused Steven to smile gently at the young girl and open his arms causing her to let out a sob and rush in his embrace, clutching his shirt tightly just like James. "I thought… I thought you will not wake up, after the seventh day, they said…" Margaret let out a sob, hiding her face in Steven's neck, being mindful of James who was snuggling in his breast, Steven hated that he was the reason that Margaret was crying, and as much as he hates it, he couldn't control what happened that day.
It took the whole day for Steve to finally lay down in his bed, sighing softly when he felt Goose jump on the bed and nuzzle his cheek before lying down on his chest, that made Steve smile as he pet the cat and gaze at the ceiling in thought, after what happened today with Goose, Steve thought that Tony will throw the cat away while screaming bloody murder, but Tony was actually… happy, energetic, Tony and Peter spent the day playing with Goose, with Peter squealing happily every time the cat licked his cheeks.
Steve didn't know what to do; he can see perfectly that Tony was breaking as his eyes took in the destroyed room, tears gathering in his eyes as his hands start shaking. "Tony… I… I'm sorry…" Peter whispered as he looked at Tony whose wide eyes were filling with tears, his breath hitching when he saw Tony's breath speeding up as the Omega opened and closed his mouth, not being able to say a word, which caused the Omega to let his tears fall.
"You are an idiot…" Bucky chocked leaning his forehead on Steve, getting a laugh from the Omega who looked at him with sparkling blue eyes, happiness taking over the Omega's body making him give a soft glow.
"It is OK, sweetheart, I got you," Steve whispered in Tony's ear, causing him to calm down and let out a sigh, leaning on Steve's chest and being grateful that his husband didn't point out how jittery and nervous Tony was becoming as he started to think that they missed something.
Steve also met Clint Barton, twenty, and an ex-mercenary and a new Shield agent that was the reason for them finding about Hydra… well, he was able to change the mind of a Russian assassin and made her join them and give the information? Steve was able to meet the woman, Natalia Romanov, a red hair assassin. When Steve entered the holding cell she was in… he and the others were met with insults in Russian, Steve was sure that the teen (Because that's what she really was, just a teenager of seventeen) didn't think that any one of them knows Russian… but Steve surprise her, and surprise everyone in the room because he starts interrogating the teen in fluent Russian right away… no one needs to know that Bucky's mother was Russian immigrated that taught him Russian because she missed home…
"Please leave…" Steven finally gathered the courage to say these two words, hoping that the king will leave him so that Steven can drown in the sea of his failure and foolishness. It was true; when the king called him foolish he was speaking from truth… Steven was a failure and his children's deaths were on him, not the king in front of him. Without giving the Alpha a chance to protest, Steven once again hid under the furs on his bed, wishing that if he hid long enough he will manage to hide away from his failure and stupidity. It took a few more silent minutes before the king stood up to leave; only when the door closed behind him did Steven allowed himself the relief of tears…
"So you found them…" Bucky hummed behind him making Steve jump and nearly run out of the room if it wasn't for the strong arms taking hold of him from behind and refusing to let go. "You shouldn't have done that, baby doll… it's OK though, I know you did it out of concern…" Bucky murmured, tightening his hold on Steve when the Omega tried to wiggle out of his arms; the tight hold made Steve whimper in pain, especially when Bucky squeezed his arms tightly in threatening manners.
"I came as fast as I can." The redheaded woman said as she stood near Peggy, she was nervous Tony could see that, but he didn't know how to act in front of the Alpha, if he had met her seven years ago, Tony knew he would have charmed her, he knew how to start a conversation and finish it, but now… now he felt like a stranger, an alien, who doesn't know what to do in this strange situation.
"Peggy…" Steve's panicked voice made Peggy leave Stane and rush to Steve… "Call the ambulance, fast!" Steve said as he jumps through the hole he made, making Peggy scream at him to come back, Steve looked around the place to see a dark corridor ending with a metal door, Steve run toward it all the while, hearing the singing get fainter, fainter, fainter… when Steve reached the door he could hear the sound of footsteps follow him from behind but Steve didn't mind them, he raised his Shield and start hitting the lock until it broke down and the door swing open, what he saw made him nearly trip as he took a step back from the shock…
(See the end of the chapter for
It was a few stops later before the three of them returned home, Peter hanging in Tony's arms as he yawns and snuggled into the Omega's chest murmuring sleepily about wanting to stay up, which made the Omega roll his eyes but smile happily at that, when he changed his baby's clothes and made sure he was sleeping, he went to search for Steve, finding the Alpha in his room, getting ready to bed. "Tony?" Steve's gentle tone as he questioned the Omega made the man swallow but he steels himself and gazes at the Alpha in the eyes trying to stop his eyes from wandering to the Alpha's chest, considering that the Alpha was in the middle of changing shirts.
"I am Iron Man." Tony cooed to the Alpha, grinning at the name he thought of in five seconds flat, this was fun, playing pretend and ignore everything around him for a little while.
"So… we want to talk with you about something." Tony started when the four of them sat in the living room to watch a movie; Tony couldn't help looking at Steve with a nervous smile on his face, not knowing how to open the subject of him being pregnant with Harley and Peter, should he blurt it out just like that? Or should he give them the pros and cons of having another baby in the house? "I… we… I… Steve a little help?" Tony asked a flush taking over his face at the thought of not being able to say what he wanted to say without blushing like a maiden.
"No, he only annoyed me, and if he knew what's best for him he wouldn't anger me." Steven said which made Loki throw him a look then glance at Dr. Banner an amused smile taking over his face as he studied Steven.
Steven smiled at that as he looked at the woman, happy that the woman was on his side. "Big enough that it will leave Hydra squirming, I'm sure the thought of them having the serum from someone not effected by werewolves' biology will be like a dream come true for them… I'm sure they will make their move after that." Steven said with a smirk, which made Peggy give an amused smile of her own and shake her head a little.
"You… you had the antidote? You were able to make it, right? You gave him the antidote, right?" Peggy asked, her eyes widen and her voice was so full of hope; and for a second, Tony's heart pounded like crazy in his chest, the thought of his father giving the antidote to his mate, nearly made him tremble, could his father have a change of heart? Tony's hopes though, had vanished as soon as Howard said the next words, leaving only confusion and pain and helplessness.
Steve opened his mouth and closes it not knowing what to say next. "What year is this?" Steve ends up saying, it can't be. Ha can't be back to the past because Peggy was standing there! A young Peggy was standing here in the room!
"What? Tony I will never force you to do something like this? Do you have such a little faith in me?" Howard asked looking at his son with a shocked look, which made Tony look at Howard for a long time.
The woman's breathe hitches as she finally reached her destination; her eyes were wide as she took in the changes that happened to the house in her absence. She raised a shaky hand to swipe some of her grey hair behind her ear, her head turning around as she took in the changes that weren't there when she used to live in the place that she once upon a time called her home.
"Marriage… what? Huh? What do you mean?" Tony asked in a faint voice, feeling like his voice was coming from miles away than a few feet, what in the name of God does that crazy ghost meant by marriage? Tony was never ever marrying anyone, not even to save his pathetic life, so what the hell is happening?
After returning home, Tony would usually prepare snacks for the kids as they changed and get ready to do their homework; after making sure the kids were set and that they don't need him for at least an hour or more, Tony would get to work in his workshop, trying to finish what he couldn't do in SI.
He still haven't found his baby boy, his baby that was supposed to be seven years and a half by now, a year pass without even having a picture of his pup to be able to define him by it, a year pass and Tony's hope was slowly leaving him, a year of following every lead and clue he could find about the pup, and nothing had come out of it, his friends were supportive, he could see it in their eyes, the hope that they felt every time he walked inside of his house after another appointment with another social worker, only for the hope to dash at Tony's anguish look.
And tell me what you think…
Steve and Tony knew each other for nearly five years, dated for two years, and married for a year.
That made the room goes into more awkward silence than before… since when Tony was dying? Peggy was trying to stop herself from biting her lip; Maria couldn't take it anymore and start sobbing, why doesn't Tony tell them about anything? Why does he hide everything to the last second? Peggy remembered the way Tony was acting a year ago, and suddenly the information in Tony's files that she sent Natasha to collect made sense because the Alpha knows that Tony was far away from the egoistic manic Natasha painted him as in her reports. "Is he… is he still dying from the palladium poisoning?" Peggy asked her mind going to Tony's sacrifice play a few days ago, if he actually did it because he knows he was dying and that it didn't matter if he died now.
After Antonette came Tova from Russia, a loving father of three, he loved his children so much, Tova died saving his youngest from falling into an iced lake, he died frozen to death… after Tova came Tonja from India, and it was kind of a funny thing because in that life Anton was born as a tiger, Tonja was one of the Maharajah's favorite pets, Steven had to stop himself from growling in disgust and pain every time he remembered how they killed Tonja to get his bones for witchcraft, so much for being favorite… after Tonja came Antonio from Italy, the man owned a beaker and was proud of his food, he was happily running the place with his sister who was expecting a son on the way… After Antonio there was Anthony from Britain who was never happy because he was forced to hide who he was, forced to hide that he was in love with his stable boy, and was never in love with his fiancé… after that, there was Andon from France, who was able to live with his male lover peacefully in the countryside… and then there were so many others that Steven lost count, but he knew their names and stories by heart.
The sound of the alarm going off made him jump from his seat, heart pounding in his chest; he stood up and went to the sticks that he arranged on the desk, his breath hitching as he put his hand on the first stick…
The second day after Steve woke up, he was moved to live with Howard and his wife, and their butler Jarvis… and Peggy and Angie who start living with the couple last year, ever since… no one told him since what… but the pain in their eyes that become glassy told him he shouldn't ask any questions…
"Anton! Are you hurt?" Jamti called out as he came running toward Anton, helping the Alpha to stand as they both gazed at the dead bear, before Jamti starts checking over Anton's injuries, the hunters rushed toward Anton surrounding him and the bear, gazing at Anton with concern. "I saw the bear try to claw your chest… what is this?" Jamti concerned voice trailed off when he saw something hanging by a cord over the Alpha's chest. "Is that… Goddess Eir amulet…" Jamti's awed voice caused Anton to lower his head to see the amulet, only for his eyes to widen when he noticed how the amulet had claw marks over it, informing Anton that the amulet had barely survived the bear's attack, but the surprise being that Anton's chest was bare of any scar or damage.
"A present? Are you serious? Six years with no word on your side other than threats and you dare to come into my home after nearly attacking my husband with a present?" Steve sneered, his hands clenching into fists, causing Tony to put his hand on the Alpha's shoulder, hoping to ground him and calm him down; the action didn't go unnoticed by Carter, for the woman scowled harshly when she saw Tony, only for her to still in her place when she finally caught the sight of his belly.
Their first kisses were shared in the elevator, behind closed doors, where no one was with them, only the two of them as they felt each other, kissing, caressing, holding; Tony will admit that he couldn't keep his voice down, especially when his husband's beard scratched him deliciously. The second time they dared to kiss was in the hallway leading to their suit, both of them not wanting to let go of the other even for a second.
Steven could hear a sob or two at the news, a lot of them were smiling happily at each other with tears in their eyes, and it made Steven happy to see his friends happy.
"Do I have something on my face?" Tony snapped gently as he put the pies on the kitchen counter with the rest of the dishes turning to Bucky Barnes who jump back from the angry Omega that was narrowing his eyes.
He remembered days sitting near the fireplace, both of them choosing the names they loved the most for their children, both of them planning where they are going to live, the places they will visit. Days exchanging kisses and promises and their hope for the future that betrayed the two of them in the end; Steve wanted to say that he was sorry, he wanted to go inside and plea with Tony to stop, he wanted to plead with him and tell him to always look up for the future, because if he didn't, then who would? Steve can never look far away, fear always holding back, but Tony can, he can and he will even if Steve had to drill it in his thick head.
Reaching the front entrance to the mansion, Tony planned to go straight to the bed and sleep this horrible day, possibly stay in his room for the rest of his short life. Opening the door, Tony nearly turned around and run away from the sight in front of him, and Tony would have success if Steve wasn't behind him pushing him inside with his huge body, uncaring that he just signed Tony's death.
"Who the hell are you?" Howard stated in a bored tone, which made Tony falter in his steps and for his hands to twitch in anger, count on his father to destroy the moment and sign himself for a beating; before Tony snap something nasty toward Howard, the man leaned up with a thoughtful look and took Tony in before an '
"So you are the leader? Took you long enough! Do you know how long I've been here waiting?!" Steven inhaled sharply and closed his eyes if he had thought that he will be able to reason with the leader about sparing his son then it will be even impossible because of Johann's foolishness. The Viking Chief, however, didn't answer. He just eyed Johann for a moment and then raised a brow, seeming to reassess the king with disapproving eyes. That didn't sit well with Johann, of course, who foolishly stepped forward as he continued to yell, "Are you not listening to me, you foolish savage?! You are in the presence of your king, so you better-" Though Johann wasn't able to finish his words because suddenly...
in his mind. In the back of his mind, Harley always wondered what it would have been like if Mr. Tony and Mr. Steve were his real parents, he wondered what it would have been like if he was raised beside Peter as his real brother and Mr. Howard and Mrs. Sarah as his real grandparents…
Peter fidget a little before relaxing at Steve's smile, a small smile taking over his face as he returned to his invention, a web shooter or something of that sort, which made the smile on Steve's face widen a little at how smart his baby was. "Because he is nice, and maybe he can help me with the web shooter, every formula I tried for the webs didn't work, so I wanted to ask him for help." Peter said off-handedly as he returns to his tinkering.
Steve on the other hand put the glass of water in his hand down, smiling at Tony like he knew something Tony didn't know. "You are from the future right?" Steve asked causing Tony to look at him like he was crazy, yes, part of what the ghost said was true, but how did he know that Tony was from the future? "The last time I saw you, I saw the date, and it said 1999, cool! But are you really from the future?" Steve asked, and Tony didn't know what to do other than nodding, ignoring how his heart gave a painful pang at the bright smile Steve sent his way.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, Fluffiest fluffs, sadness, cuteness! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
Confused about his feeling for Steven and Rogers; Tony bumped into Bucky who was recovering faster than anyone could have predicted. As much as Tony wanted to scream at Bucky for destroying his life, the two Omegas surprisingly get along well; it was then Tony asked Bucky how he knew he loved Rogers, and how he could tell if he really does love someone or if it was something else. Bucky was surprised and a little bit confused at the question, but he answered Tony as best as he can, detailing how he felt about Rogers and how could someone knows if he really was in love or in lust or something in between.
Steven turned his head to search for one of the Avengers, mainly to have an excuse to ditch the people that seemed to crowd him. He spotted Tony and a smile took over as Rogers was busy talking with Ross, (who is another person Steven should warn Peggy about). "If you will excuse me, something came up," Steven said giving his best smile, which made the Omegas flush and the Alphas laugh. In the end, they didn't let him go until he took their numbers.
Peggy picked her way through the debris, swearing to herself, and went to check the state of the bathroom and the second floor, hearing the woman swear made Tony focus on the British accent in her voice, which brought a pang in Tony's heart. The young man follows, looking over his shoulder, and sees the bathroom suite is still intact. A bath, toilet, and sink, all unharmed amid the devastation, though there are streaks of mud across the walls, and several inches of murky looking water in the bath.
?!' made Tony look at the ceiling before turning to his friends, Natasha already standing up looking at Tony like he lost his mind and turned into a full Addams. "I was there to witness S.H.I.E.L.D.'s downfall at the hand of the Winter Soldier and Serpentine not an hour ago just wanted to inform you that tomorrow's picnic with S.H.I.E.L.D. is canceled and all, so bye," Tony stated as he turned around, already preparing to take a long deep bubble bath before sleeping for the next 24 hours, he was done… Tony was done!
So imagine his surprise one day, when he realized that he was in love with a feisty Omega he meets a few months ago. It all started with Anthony rushing to work, it was actually his only day off in the week, so Anthony usually use that time to do the things he loved the most, inventing machines that will help people, not the guns and missiles his father forced him to create, today his father called him to complain about one of his project, not something that surprised him as his father always do that once a week, but what surprised him was his father demanding that Anthony to come right away to the company and solve the problem, no matter how much Anthony wanted to complain, he knew it would be worse if he did it, so it ends with Anthony having to suck it up and go to work on his day off.
Peter let out a small sigh when a long period of silence went without his mother answering him, he then returned to his web shooter. "It's Italian word…" That made Peter raises his head to look at his mother who returned to wiping the counter. "It meant a baby or little child." Steve said with a sad smile, remembering all of the times Tony… No, Anthony, never Tony… told him how he loved to start a family with Steve, how his Alpha always slipped and talked in Italian when he was happy and excited, making Steve try to learn a little Italian or he will be lost because his Alpha told him Steve always made him happy, and that's why he rambles in Italian.
. "I wanted… I wanted to give something special to my husband, so I... I gave a little piece of my Shield to my friend, she knew how to handle Vibranium, and she made those rings… I still remember my husband's face when he realizes what I did…" Steve gives a little laugh remembering the shocked, happy, sad, look on his husband's face when he saw Steve with the rings in his hand, and the parts of his Shield in other.
"Steven!" Steven can hear Peggy's voice, and he wondered if it was his imagination, because to say the truth the man was frozen still in his place, especially when the blond wolf (And is there even a blond wolf in the world?) took a threatening step toward him. It was not that Steven fears wolf or hate them, far from that, he actually adored them, and even saw a few when he was on a mission, but the feeling he was getting from those wolves were unnatural… it made his hair stand on its ends… he just needs a few seconds to unfroze himself so he may fight them because hell no! He won't let feral wolves walk freely inside of the mansion, not when people may get hurt... though it didn't stop Steven from thinking that he forgot something important…
So what do you think?
To all the lovely readers who got confused by the timeline of the story, this is a small explanation…
"You are wrong." Anton snapped, turning his back to the queen, trying to calm his racing heart, his mind still repeating the image of the nude Omega, causing Anton to flush even more in embarrassment, not knowing how to act in such an embarrassing situation. "Considering this lake is secluded, I decided to take a swim here; if I knew that this place was the gathering place for annoying Omegas I would have tried to find another one." Anton huffed feeling his cheeks flush at the snort the Omega gave, wondering if he was turning red all over his body… for all of his long life, Anton was never once put in such a situation before; he wasn't a floundering virgin or afraid of seeing a nude body (He bathed beside Nattalegg and Magna for Odin's sake!) It's just… it's different when it comes to Omegas. (3)
"Steve?" Tony whispered against his husband's temple, breathing Steve in; Steve's scent intertwined with Tony's, making the Omega float a little. In his arms, Steve shivered; Tony nuzzles him, holds him steady, and anchored him in turn hoping that his mate was feeling as happy and content as Tony was. "You really are the love of my life." Tony whispered softly like he was sharing a secret with Steve that no one will know.
Tony began to thrust faster and deeper the more Steve spoke. His movements became more haphazard as he got closer to his climax. Steve raked his nails down Tony's chest, letting out a strangled 'fuck' on a particularly good thrust. Steve locked eyes with the man beneath him and smiled. "Mark me, make me yours. Knot me,
"Why Tony, a little bird by the name Ty told me about you." Hearing that name made Tony freeze in shock and denial only the push of Stane's gun made him stumble but continue his way. "Told me about this strange town and how it was ruled by Barnes and Carter, whose word are law; he told me about the stranger who came months ago seeking refuge and how Barnes and Carter took a liking to him. If you had stayed home like a good little lamb you would have realized that money can and will buy everything, even information." Stane snorted at him as he pushed him forward making Tony stumble in his steps and nearly fall.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So how was your day?" Steve said as he stood behind Tony, gazing down at the Alpha who was giving him a dopy smile while looking at him with his head lying on the backrest of the sofa, and Steve before he could stop the idiot urge, he was running his hands through Tony's hair, knowing that the Alpha was having a killer headache, as always, after staying in the lab for too long.
"He is with you for half a year now, right? Did he improve in that time?" Tony asked as he leaned on the tree behind him, causing Betty to hum and title her head in deep thought. The Beta looked like she was a step ahead from ranting and complaining about her job, which by then Tony would have let her do it.
." Peter's soft voice was heard, and Steve wanted, he wanted to sit up and smile at the boy and tell him that it was OK, that Steve will be the one who will take him to the park today, so he doesn't need to be sad. Again, defying him, his body refused to listen to Steve's order, holding him a prisoner until it deemed it alright to let him go.
“Never, ever dare to insult my Alpha, ever again!” Tony hissed, causing Sarah’s eyes to narrow in his direction, a growl nearly leaving her lips at the insulting and disobeying tone, Tony used against her. “I don’t know what you have against me, Mrs. Rogers, and I don’t care if you hate me, but never insult Steve for something that wasn’t his fault, whatever Miss Peggy did, it is not justified that you turn all domineer and control Steve’s life just because of one failed relationship!” Tony growled, he can see how wide Sarah’s eyes became at the mention of that name.
"You are really planning on giving me a heart attack, aren't you, sweetheart?" Steve said as he entered the room, causing the three to turn their heads to Steve, calling his name as they tried to untangle themselves and rush toward him; Steve only laughed a little as he crossed the distance between them and sat on the side of the bed, pulling the three of them into a hug and holding them tightly.
Steve remembered how he met Tony years ago, how the two of them met by chance because of Natasha; Steve remembered the way Tony gazed at him, with wide eyes full of interest and a dropped jaw. At that time, such a thing had made Steve very uncomfortable; being fresh out of college and having spent years and years surrounded by uncaring cold Alphas who only wanted him for something or another, it was hard being around an Alpha who acted... differently.
Tony pouted, trying to ignore the sting of humiliation, pain, and rejection, which was not a first since Tony had to get used to it for nearly half of his life. Tony raised a hammer and start hammering his armor, and he was 2034% sure that he was trying to destroy the armor and not fix a thing about it; not that Tony cared, he was still salty about what took a place not a few hours ago.
Steve removed his pants, and then looked to Tony, expectantly. When Tony looked at him, confused, Steve smiled and gave a fond sigh. "You always say this sweater makes me look like a present, all wrapped up, so I wanted to give you a chance to unwrap me." Steve stated, gazing at his Alpha through his bangs, playing with the hem of his baby blue sweater.
Tony didn't know when his life starts being hell, but it was probably after Obadiah Stane learned he was an Omega. Obadiah was his father's partner, so Tony sees him from time to time in their mansion, he was no stranger to the man waltzing in their house whenever he liked, it always made Tony grumbled to Pepper and Rhodey about how the older man thinks he owns the place just because he was an Alpha.
Right now… right now, Tony was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, if he stayed here, something might happen, Rogers might attack them or the town's people might change their minds about letting Tony be; either way, it would end up hurting his daughter, something that Tony tried to avoid. On the other hand, all connections Tony had with Rhodey and Pepper were cut; all the calls went directly to his father something that terrified Tony, rending him useless and helpless, not knowing what to do, but not willing to go and investigate last Howard managed to locate Morgan and take her away from him.
Awe! Howard and Tony finally made up!
! For taking those… those... nothing but bags of meat side! The king curled his mouth into a sneer as he gazed at the Omega's unflinching eyes.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence (?), feelings, mention of past abuse (?), mention of rape (?), panic attacks, near mental break down, maybe fluff? And Tony finally gets his shit together while Peter being a precious peanut!… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Part of Anton wanted to ignore the Omega, to open the door and walk away without giving the Omega a glance, another part of Anton wanted to open the door, pulling the Omega inside and scream at him about how stupid and foolish he was, to accept marrying a child that couldn't provide for the Omega or his son, a child that could have been the Omega's own pup had the Omega married from a young age. Another knock on the door, followed by the voice of the Omega caused Anton to grit his teeth, licking the blood from his lower lip he decided to open the door, if this all blows up and ended with a shouting match it wouldn't be the first time, nor would it be the last if the Omega continued in his foolish path. "What?" Anton gritted through his teeth, gazing at the Omega who was raising his brow at him like he was an idiot.
"Are you alright?" Jamti's voice made Anton blink his eyes and turn to his friend, without really seeing him; it took Jamti repeating the question twice before Anton realized that his friend was looking a breath away from panicking and calling Magna, which will end with an even more disaster.
Steve gave a tired sigh as he held his son and checked his forehead fearing that the baby was getting sick on him, the knocking on the door made Steve sigh tiredly and made his way to put his baby in his small crib only for the child to start screaming again, that made Steve groan and he nearly screamed his head off when the door was knocked loudly once again. "Coming…" Steve muttered to himself as he went to the door hoping that it wasn't one of the neighbors coming to complain about his son crying, again. "Can I help you, sir?" Steve asked as he opened the door blinking as he saw an old man in his seventies standing there… great he was going to get kicked out by an old man in a sharp suit.
Zola chuckled at his words, making Steven grind his teeth until they hurt even with the serum running inside his body. "You see Commander, for years now, we have sought to recreate the same serum running inside of your counterpart body; the closest we got to create it was the Winter Soldier…" Steven saw how Zola pulled the rope in his hand roughly, making Bucky stumble before correcting himself as quickly as he can, loathe and fury built up inside Steven. "All of our experiments after that failed, and with your counterpart crushing the Valkyrie in the arctic, all of our hope of recreating stronger soldiers dashed with it. Imagine our surprise though when the dear Captain's body was retrieved from the arctic a year and a half ago, alive even! By that point we realized we can't recreate the serum without Dr. Erskine, who regrettably died years and years ago; but I didn't give up faith, I know that with the strong super-soldier Omega we have and Captain America, we could create the perfect soldiers! Imagine my thrill when you showed up, you! The purest form the serum ever conceived! With no instincts, no werewolves gens, no secondary gender to oppose you, you are the ideal candidate to help Hydra rise from the ashes!" Zola crow in triumphant, causing Steven's eyebrow to twitch in irritation, his glare increases ten volts daring Zola to try something.
"I think so, yeah." Steve's smile widens even more at the thought of the future that will come, the thought of their growing family, and his mate and children…
"What?" Tony asked when he turned his face toward his friends, both of them looking at him with small smiles and wistful faces, making Tony a little worried about the way they acted like, but both of them just chuckle and shook their heads. Angie chooses that moment to return with their food, coffee for Pepper and Rhodey, and orange juice for him, glaring at him darkly until he swallowed down the juice in a single long gulp, grimacing at the sharp taste and hating how Angie walked away with pride.
"My, my Mr. Rogers, and they say civility has died." Tony swoon which made the Alpha give a chuckle and shake his head, waiting until Tony seat himself and buckled his seat before closing the door behind him and went to take his place behind the wheel, unaware of how red Tony's face turned and how his heart was pounding in his chest like it was going to leave him any minute now. It was so easy, the flirting and banter the two of them shared, it made Tony happy that the Alpha indulges him and even think that he is funny.
Edith's voice made Steve hum a little and close his eyes for a little while sitting up. "Permission granted…" Steve said as he looked around the room, to see everyone looking at the ceiling with wonders and a little bit of fear? Awe? Surprise? Steve didn't know, but he couldn't look at his young self's face as he was looking at the ceiling.
"Sure, why not?" Steve joked, letting out a satisfied sigh when he finished the ice cream, when he looked up, he frowned when he saw that it was time for him to go home. "I need to get home Nat, I have to start working; if you come over tomorrow I will be done with the portraits by then." Steve smiled at his friend and agent, getting ready to leave, only to be stopped by Natasha who raised his messenger bag and raising her eyebrow at his forgetfulness, causing Steve to chuckle sheepishly; he didn't know what he would have done without Natasha and her always saving him.
with what looked like a map on the back of the paper housing the sketch of Wakanda and her Black Panther, but something deep down told Steve that he shouldn't trust anyone with this information even if he didn't fully know the meaning behind it, he doesn't know why, he can tell Captain Carter he was sure of that, she was Captain America after all, but something stopped him, and the Omega gave an apologetic smile to the woman. "I am really sorry Ma'am, but other than the house, I haven't heard from the doctor or his lawyer in years." Steve said with sadness itching in his feature at not being able to tell anyone of the little secret that he and the kind doctor had shared years and years ago, and the woman seemed to have bought it, as she let out a tired sigh…
The first time Steve opened his eyes, he saw that he was in a room, not a hospital room, but a beautiful one… Steve wondered to himself if he went to heaven, he sighs gently and closes his eyes for a bit… it was then he heard it, a gentle voice humming a song. Steve furrows his brows at that and tried to sit up, he looked around the place in hope of finding from where that voice was coming from… it was enchanting. After Steve stood up from the bed, he heard the door opened making him look toward it, only to gasp, because there stood… "Peggy?" it was Peggy, an older Peggy that may have been in her early forties, but still beautiful as the day he saw her.
Walking down the stairs, Steven paused when his eyes fell on the king's pup. The small boy was sitting on the steps while leaning on the wall behind him, letting out a huff of breath now and then as he curled his body into a ball, the boy was asleep, that's what Steven gathered when he kneeled the babe and touched him, and it made the Omega frown at the reason of why the babe was sleeping here instead of his room.
By this time, the room became silent as everyone looked at Steven who was looking at his ring, with a sad look lost in the memories of his husband. Bruce sighed a little and looked at Tony who was looking at his shoes in shame, it was the first time he saw that look on his fellow Omega's face, as the other O usually act like an uncaring brat, Bruce really hoped that Tony will learn his lesson now he was faced with one of the consequences of his actions, Clint and Natasha had already left the room, after hearing Steven's words, probably didn't want to bother the older man who looked so lost and pained.
"P-please d-don't… I... I'm p-pregnant…" Tony was able to choke out through the strong grip on his neck, hating how the person standing behind him just snorted and tighten his grip on Tony's neck causing him to let out a choked noise of pain, God, how much Tony hated himself when tears start sliding down his face when the man pointed the knife at his belly shaking it like he was mocking him.
"Oh, that? Nothing, baby, Mr. Stark was just teaching me a little Kung Fu moves to beat bullies!" Steve laughed nervously hoping that his son will believe him, it was a few seconds later that the baby squealed happily and rushed toward the Omega pulling his sleeves.
In 1999: Howard kicked Steve out of the apartment, Peter was born in August of the same year.
"That's because it's fall, baby, every year the trees change their colors in fall, then they fell off the trees in winter, only for new leaves to show in the spring." Tony said to the pup purring when the pup's face lighten up and start looking out of the window, taking in the different colors of the trees, it made the adults smile at the sight before them, especially Howard and Maria, as the two of them had refused to leave their son and grandson's side these whole two weeks.
"You… you are here; I thought… I thought you left… Howard…" Steve whispered shakily, trying to wipe the tears that refuse to stop; Tony was here, Tony was here with him even after Howard ordered him not to. The traitorous part of Steve couldn't help the hope blooming in his chest, wishing and praying that Tony was going to choose him, just this time he wanted Tony to choose him.
So back to where Tony started, it was awkward being in the same room as Steve, the man kissed him and the two of them weren't even on a date or something, he just showed up in Tony's lab (Making the salt turn black again, damn it!) kissed Tony like he had the right to do it, and disappear before Tony even had a chance to snap at him! It was so not fair and Tony hated the special assassin school Steve went to; how can they make him appear and disappear just like that?! (Tony was going to ignore that there are other powers at play and focus on the assassin part)
"About that, I talked with her, she said they only kept you here because they thought you were a suspect, they were actually waiting for me to come here and edify you." Steve said which made the Omega blink and when it finally clicked he hissed at the corner he thought he saw someone hide behind.
Tony still remember his family's corpses on the ground, he remembers the grieve and hurt on Steve's face, Tony remember everything in details; in the back of Tony's mind, the inventor wondered what happened to his baby when Thanos killed them all. "Shh, it's OK Tony, we will stop him, it's OK…" Peggy said as she kneeled beside him, pulling him into her embrace as she rocked him from side to side trying to calm him down and knowing that she was failing at it.
The thing was; Tony had promised him to come with him today. He had promised to never miss out on the first doctor visit with Steve, who was nervous as hell; he promised he will be here! But his appointment was approaching, and there was still no sight of his Alpha anywhere, and not only that; the Alpha wasn't answering any of Steve's calls or voice messages, leaving Steve a nervous mess full of anger at his husband's oversight. His husband always jokes about Steve's forgetfulness, while in fact, he was the one who seemed to forget everything and anything important that wasn't his job!
and the kids yawing and preparing for bed.
"P… P-Peggy?" Steve's voice cracked as he called his friend's name, wondering if he was losing it somehow or he was dead from the start… his friend was here… his big sister was here… hearing his voice Peggy raised her head from the book in her hands with wide eyes, jumping to Steve's side as soon as she realized he was awake.
"You are married?" Now Tony really felt like shit, not only did he borrow the rings without permission and damaging them, but the owner in question made them from his Shield for his husband who was probably waiting for the super soldier in his universe.
"We are coming to visit in four months from now, I'm sure you will need two capable fellas to help you prepare for the baby's arrival… and remember Tony, you are dead if I'm not the godmother." Pepper cooed while patting his cheek, which caused Tony to shiver and laugh nervously, Rhodey, the traitor, did nothing but back away, sweat sliding down his face.
"Don't you dare call him that!" Steve remembered shouting at the woman glaring at her with hate. "You have no right to call him that, especially after refusing to come when he asked for you on his…" Steve's voice cracked and he shook his head. "Get out." Steve ends up saying leaving the HQ not caring about his friends calling out for him.
When it happened, Steve was getting back from work to his home, he was in pain, but Steve didn't pay that much attention, thinking that it was Braxton Hicks, he was having those insane cramps in the past few weeks it nearly drove him insane. It was after he stood near the waiting crowd in the sidewalk waiting for the lightening signs to change he felt it.
Tony couldn't help but wonder why everything was taking too long, it was a stab wound right? It will be easier to treat a stab wound right? Then why are they taking two hours too long? Steve should be out of the operation room a long time ago; he should be out and annoying Tony like he always does, Steve should be out of there to pull his ear and call him stupid with that soft smile of his. Hell, Tony will even take a screaming Steve; he will accept being subjected to his mate's curses and screams if it meant that he will be alright and that he will get out of the operation room now.
"His history with Miss Potts; what does that mean Bucky?" Steve asked, already dreading the answer Bucky had in mind, but when Bucky didn't answer him, Steve couldn't help but clench his fists tightly. "Please, Buck, what does it mean?" The plea in Steve's voice seemed to crack Bucky, causing him to sigh as he looked at his hands in deep thoughts.
"I… I will… I will go and call Mr. Clint…" Harley said as he looked between the two adults before starting to run, leaving Tony sighing as he turned once again to Peggy, who look even murderous than she was a few seconds ago, which informed Tony that Harley's interruption put a wrench in whatever plan she had in mind.
"B… Bucky is alive?" Steve's voice cracked as he asked that question, looking at Steven like the older man hold all the answers to the universe. "You married him, didn't you? He is alive in your universe, he didn't fall from the train, he is alive… why are you doing here if he is alive?" Steve screamed as he stood up, looking at his counterpart like he was crazy for wasting his chance with Bucky to return to this place, Steve knows that if it was him, he wouldn't leave Bucky at all, not like his traitor of counterpart.
"One slave and the rest of them are workers… Magna, if you will please find jobs and a house for them…" The king spate through his teeth like saying those words were like a poison he was forced to drink and was trying to spit it out, something that gave Steven pride as he straightens himself and gave the king a mocking innocent smile, which gained him a hiss from the king, like an angry lion who got his tail squashed by a rock.
"Hello, little one, my name is Howard." If the boy's grin wasn't wide enough before it sure is now. It seemed that the little boy only needs this much of an ice breaker before he took the closest place near Howard and start chatting him up, telling Howard about everything and nothing, about what the little boy likes, what he hates, about the wedding that will take place soon and how Tony told him he can be the ring bearer.
Tony shifted in his place, before nodding his head and following Steve when the Omega headed to their bedroom. Reaching their room, Steve let out a tired sigh as he went to the closet, his mind was running around in circles that he wasn't focusing on when Tony starts ranting about this and that. "…And then he had the gall to play the victim! I am sure that Bucky has a hand in this!" Tony hissed making Steve close his eyes and count to ten.
"When… the bad men tried… to take me… Cap stops 'em… Papa hugs me, Mama." His baby said the word slowly so that Tony will understand how important this was and also not miss what the pup was going to say. "He 'as warm…" The pup purred at that nuzzling Tony's chest making the Omega laugh a little which made his baby grin happily. "An', an' he called me little on' and made me go wit' good people… Papa's big… like this!" The pup said opening his arms wide, making Tony smile happily at that.
Swallowing a little, Tony bite his lips nervously before knocking on the door in front of him, his hands shaking, and were steady only thanks to his suit, a few seconds (Or were they minutes, Tony certainly start losing time) the door finally opened, causing Tony's heart to nearly lapping out of his chest when he saw his father… his father who looked the same as he did seventeen years ago. Whatever harsh words Tony prepared for his father and mother vanished in the speed of light, leaving Tony breathless and shaking in his place, not knowing what to do or say.
"No Brother Clinton, what Brother Stark says is true; Heimdall informed me just now that Thanos is on the move. Without the Space Stone; it will take Thanos up to a year to reach Asgard, three to reach Midgard. It will give us time to prepare for the war." Thor stated with a grim face, causing everyone to shift in their place, gazing at Tony before turning to Thor.
"You better do Rogers." Howard said as he took the comm from Natasha and put it in his ear sitting next to the monitors.
I hope this helps.
The sight that met them forced their smiles to nearly split their faces; Tony was carrying his daughter in his arms, leaning on Steve who was resting on the bed beside him. No one noticed how but Peter had already slipped inside the room and was sitting between his parents staring at the baby with wide eyes. No one pointed at Steve's bandaged hand. All of them rushed toward Tony and Steve to congratulate them.
It nearly took the whole day installing the cameras and sensors outside, not to forget rebooting Jarvis after they installed him in the reinforced attic (Thanks to Rhodey). Now, the only thing left was inside the house; Tony didn't want to admit it, but it scared him shitless how Stane managed to get inside his house when it was still locked.
"OK, enough!" Steven's booming voice made everyone freeze in their place, especially the disappointing tone in his voice. "Clint stop fucking laughing and stand up, why the hell will you eat when you know that we will be traveling to space? Thor gets yourself together and go take a shower and change into clean clothes, and for God's sake stop screaming!" Steven's commanding voice made everyone shut up, Clint stood with the help of Natasha, trying not to look at Steven who was glaring at everyone, Thor grumbled and hissed at Clint before using his hammer to sail into the sky and head toward the palace to change his clothes, that left everyone shuffling on their feet looking at Steven who turns his face toward the small rounded stage in the middle, only to see the gatekeeper looking at them with a blank face.
Married… Tony was married to Pepper… how? How was that even possible? Were Bucky and Peggy really telling the truth? Was Steve really married to Bucky all along and his life with Tony was nothing but a distant dream? It felt so real though… so real that Steve was having a hard time believing that Bucky was the right one all along.
"You… y-you remember?" Bucky asked in a soft voice, his hands were shaking at the admission and hope was clear in his eyes as he took a step toward Steve; face vulnerable and eyes shining with tears. The sight caused Steve's lips to tremble, because… it was his fault?… Bucky was like this because Steve forgot who they were… it was Steve's fault, right?
But the thing is, Rogers was actually not that bad, he was weird yes, he has that unhealthy obsession with death and blood and gore and strange cursed things, that was for sure. But under all that creepiness, he was actually a sweet man, he was understanding for once, never making fun of her for being a woman. He even looked at her proudly and start telling her about how his cousin Wednesday was like her, beautiful and deadly and won't stop until in her vengeance until the blood of her enemy had soaked her clothes… which as much as it was disturbing, it was actually sweet… in a twisted kind of way…
"Can you tell me the name of his lawyer?" Peggy asked which got her a comforting smile from the Omega as the man told her the name, which made her curse internally, considering that she knew for sure that 'Chester Philips' has died nine years ago in a car accident… "Do you know… if Dr. Erskine left any message of any kind?" Peggy asked, getting desperate for any clue, hoping that she will at least find something that will help her stop Hydra.
"I am back! I'm back! Oh thank God, I am back!" The swamp/slime/goo monster cried, raising his hands and falling to the ground crying in relief. "No more living in the bathrooms! No more staying in this cursed mansion! No more chasing after that crazy Addams' affection! I'm done, you hear me? I'm done!" The monster shrieked as he stood on his shaky legs, only to start running while screaming 'I'm done!', it was a few minutes later before Serpentine felt him leaving the mansion's ground.
"I don't know… maybe?" Steve was unsure as he answered Tony's question, letting go of Tony before heading to open the door, with Tony behind, no doubt the two of them were trying to remember if they forgot something or someone. "Who is… what the hell are you doing here?" Steve's harsh tone caused Tony to still for a second before shuffling behind Steve to see the person who dared to gain such a reaction out of his husband.
13-Stolið minjar eða ekki, allir sem klæðast þessu eru undir vernd minni, þú snertir þá, ég mun ekki hika við að drepa þig. -A stolen relic or not, everyone who wears this is under my protection, you touch them, I will not hesitate to kill you.
"Who the hell is Ty?" Tony heard Bucky ask Peggy in what the older man hoped was a low voice, his question made freezing coldness surrounding Tony, and he raised his eyes to gaze at the older man with teary eyes, which caused Peggy to give her husband a nasty look.
"Thank you." Maria could only say as she took the cup from the Omega sighing gently to herself as she relaxed, even more, when she smelled the scent of Earl Grey. "I have to say, I'm sorry that only now I come… I only knew about your existence a week ago, forgive me, I don't know what to do." Maria whispered which made the Omega give her a long look before a sad smile taking over his face.
So what do you think?
What to do? What to do? Cutting all of his parents money and leaving them to deal with the financial problems is not Tony's style, he wasn't that cruel to take someone's hard-earned money (Even if it came from him and his company) Tony was tired of screaming and shouting and arguing with Howard, it hadn't worked for the twenty years he lived with the man, and it sure as hell won't work now when the senile old man reached his 99 years old and probably lost his hearing. So what is Tony to do with the problem that presents itself to him after seventeen years of him making peace with his parents' death?
Tony refused to believe that, he refused to believe that his son died on January 10, 1988, he refused to believe that he lost him at seven months and a half, he refused to believe that a drunk driver was the reason of his death; he refused to believe this play.
Maybe Steve wants real words, or maybe he just likes how Tony was begging for him; it was probably the latter, it would have explained why his husband was left with his suit's pants, even with Tony's desperate efforts to get him naked. That wasn't fair, but Tony was too impatient to care right now, and he also needed to be taken by his husband, so for that Tony hooked one of his legs around Steve's hip and managed to whisper to him several words. "Yes, Alpha, I'm sure, now please,
did the man not even realize that seventeen years had passed? That old fart just went straight to the cold shoulder phase and left Tony outside the house like a disobedient dog!
; Tony's favorite was
"I am sorry Margaret, though I am fine now, so please do not cry." Steven whispered, which caused the Beta to let out a sob before gazing at him with teary eyes; looking at Margaret's face, it reminded Steven that Margaret was still young, just fifteen springs, who didn't know that much about the world that asked too much of her. "I am here now, do not cry, you know I hate it when you and James do that." Steven kissed Margaret's forehead, which caused the Beta to shudder and hide her face in his neck.
Tony wanted to scream, he wanted to shout and order whoever was talking to shut up. There were so many voices talking at once, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand, and they were causing Tony a great headache as he tried to make sense. They all were talking at once, not giving Tony a chance to make sense of their words, causing Tony to chock in fear when he did; the fear increased when Tony opened his mouth to question them and nothing came out, no sound, not even a whine…
