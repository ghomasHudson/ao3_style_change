Steve was finally home, surrounded by his friends, utterly alone. “Where’s Tony?”
True to form at the exact moment Steve’s having this revelation, Tony’s having the opposite.
“Then why do you think he’d start with me?”
all the time. The voice is cold and calculating and Steve doesn’t trust it.
It’s not as if he can disappoint Stark more, it’s not as if Stark will ever want more. (
for you, Stark?” he hissed lowly. “Because almost losing you again really isn’t fun for me.”
Steve kissed him and Tony had been wrong: Steve’s tears were warm. A hand cradled the back of his neck.
It’s the heartbeat of grace before the fall. After Tony realized he’d lost before Steve ever told him they were playing; when he realized he’d compromised himself for someone who would never do the same for him. Before he fell to wrath and his other clambering demons. One last look before fate took them all.
Tony hedged. “Well, I probably wasn’t lying to you when I said I had a plan which means I just need to figure out what past-me meant. I didn’t bring us here on our honeymoon, Cap.”
Steve lets out a breath, head bowed. “I know why you’re here.”
Stark looks back over his shoulder. “You still here?”
“He’s not - ”
That was why Tony came: to pay his dues for his final sin. For leaving Steve behind and saving his life because for all of Tony’s talk of the randomness of the universe he believes in justice. Tony had been Steve’s keeper in the Ether but Steve had been Tony’s too.
Tony doesn’t mention the other Avengers often. Not to Steve. The context sours it: Tony attributes deaths by some mysterious formula known only to himself. Steve doesn’t count the war, doesn’t count trickery or mind-control or indoctrination or survival.
It’s nearly surreal to be touching Tony in a way that doesn’t hurt either of them but God, it’s better, so much better than being alone in this place that no longer feels like home. Steve starts speeding up, the raw pleasure a prelude to -
That’s where they’d left it: festering under every interaction but strictly off limits. They stick to the details now: the legalities of American interventionism, Vision’s visits to Wanda, Dr. Tanaka’s team. Dealing only with the symptoms and keeping far away from the disease. It’s not as if they lack for conflict - the shield is just the latest in a long line - but no one’s in the Raft, no one’s dead, no one’s fighting in the streets. No violence. No death squads. No ticking clocks. It should be better, the peace instead of the war, but the ragged broken thing inside of Steve can’t help but insist nothing’s won without blood.
They make it to the bed and it’s soft, so soft. It proves Steve’s point. They don’t need the anger. The fact that it’s common doesn’t mean it’s necessary. Afterward Steve feels numb in the best way. He’s tired and satisfied in a post-orgasmic haze. He watches without an inkling of fear as Tony dresses efficiently and pauses near the door. He picks up Steve’s sketchbook and the faintest of alarm bells begins ringing somewhere far, far away. Tony flips through the ruined pages, getting closer and closer to -
“You smell like the floor of my freshman dorm. How on Earth are you sticky?” An exasperated sigh. “I was never this sloppy when I was tanked.”
, my son. He knows you, and if you find it in your heart to repent, all can and will be forgiven.”
Bucky stares out at the corner with dead eyes. “He told me he forgives me.”
Steve has never wanted to die, he has only wanted to rest. “He saved me.”
“Do your worst, Cap,” Tony snarls through clenched, bloodied teeth. He isn’t smiling. “The doors will still be locked.”
He steps forward and drops a forgotten cyclamen onto the pyre.
“I - I’m going to help. If you let me, I’ll help.”
Except Tony had found someone he loved and married and mourned. It just wasn’t Steve.
“First off,” Tony snaps, “
Some expression Steve didn’t recognize flit across Tony’s face.
Tony throws his hands up. “This is me winning is it?”
“You were protecting Tony.”
“I’m not, some of these slabs look like they were struck by lightning, dumped into a burning bush and then smashed by Noah on the way down the mountain.” He turned to where Steve kept himself an arms length away in case God decided to smite Tony where he stood. “Alright, let’s get a look at that cut, Cap.”
He came down from his high still pinned. The inside of his undersuit was a sticky mess, semen drying tacky. Steve’s forehead was leaning against the cairn in the crook of Tony's neck. The drizzling rain had turned impossibly to snow; small, white flakes floating down and settling onto blond hair like a crown. Steve shivered when the icy droplets melted onto his nape and Tony yearned to lick them off. Instead he stuck out his tongue to catch the drifting snow, admiring the miracle for what it was.
“How did you find me?” Steve croaks.
Tony retracted his helmet. He looked awful: pale and sweating with dark circles under his eyes, but he still smelled like the sea. It made Steve feel wrong-footed.
There’s nothing Steve can bring himself to say. It reminds him of that moment in Siberia when he didn’t answer and Tony knew anyway. Already Tony’s shaking his head like he’s just waiting to hear it confirmed that nothing he does is enough to warrant Steve staying. They’ve spent a year discovering new ways to hurt each other before falling back into the same old ones. Steve has spent the last twelve months wasting away at the Compound and he can’t bring himself to volunteer to return to it. He can’t wait around endless days for a calamity dreadful enough they call him back into service. It will turn him in something else long before then: a hollowed-out tin soldier with no inner life of his own.
It’s a reminder of what they used to have. When post-mission bickering was just that. “Go to Medical. Get cleared.”
Every time Steve spares a thought for Tony in Bucky’s presence he feels like a traitor. Like Tony’s hands have left imprints on his skin and if Bucky looks too closely he’ll see them. He’ll know what Steve’s done and how much he’s enjoyed it and Steve would lose him all over again. Regardless of Stark’s current agenda, Iron Man tried to kill his best friend. That should be enough. What does it say about him that it’s not?
"Thank you," Tony said when they were done, holding Steve's equally dirty hands in his. "Next time, how about we stay in and watch dumb holiday movies until I'm so bored we have to make hot chocolate instead?"
No. This was because he could, he reminded (or, more accurately, reprimanded) himself. He refused to allow himself to believe anything else. This was because Tony was beautiful and because he needed to be tamed. This was because Steve was proving to himself better than his previous counterpart.
"Steve." He feels lighter. "My name's Steve."
. He couldn’t find it. Not under the soft water, the shampoo, the body wash, the generic scent of exhaustion and relief.
The muscle in Steve’s jaw jumped. “Could you be serious for once in your life!”
This particular stranger is clearly not an agent. He’s old but not stooped, wearing a grey suit and a tan overcoat. His hair is a shocking bundle of well-groomed white and so is his full beard. There’s a slim, silver-topped cane in his left hand and thin-rimmed round glasses on his lined face. He hasn’t seen Steve, his concentration is focused on fumbling his way through making tea. The old-fashioned kettle has been placed on the burner and he starts pulling open cabinets at random, searching for a cup, a saucer, a teabag, a spoon.
Stephen’s head fell into his hands. “Damn him.”
Tony’s glaring at him like Steve’s being unfair. “
Steve didn’t really wake because he never really slept. He blinked up at the darkened ceiling of his bedroom. The sheets were cool. Tony was safe and sleeping well in Seattle. Presumably. There was no way for Steve to know. He tried to ignore the insistent ice between his ribs but the lingering images of death did nothing to dull it. It was Tony, always Tony.
Tony’s voice in his head sounded like silk:
Bucky opens the gift carefully and smiles like no one could ever want anything more than tiny squares of baked flour and salt. “Aw, Stevie, you shouldn’t have. It’s just what I always wanted.”
Reed took pity. “You should go back to sleep.”
“Nope. Lang has a girlfriend. They’re going for theme naming. They think it’s cute. C’mon, who else?”
This isn’t seduction, this is something worse. It itches under Steve’s skin just the same. His eyes track over tan, scarred, blank skin but he keeps his distance. Tony huffs and walks up to him with characteristic overconfidence bordering on the suicidal. Like Steve couldn’t crush him and hasn’t before.
The grey wisps of smoke rise to the heavens. It smells acrid, awful and wonderful, like aftermath and catharsis. The wind blows a billow of smoke into Tony’s face and suddenly there’s cleansing fire in his lungs, burning him from the inside out, and then -
. It took him even longer than that not to feel cheated. As if upon getting Bucky back he was somehow owed a second miracle. “I think he likes it here.”
“I just need more time.”
Steve doesn’t get the chance to go to the council because two hours after FRIDAY comes back online and gives him the runaround, Natasha walks in and drops a thin file on the breakfast bar in front of him.
He didn’t hang up. With Tony’s voice in his ear Steve could pretend Tony was here with him. He could pretend he wasn’t alone in this new crowded Hell they just called life.
“That’s not - ” Steve tries to get himself back to what he’d planned.
“We’re in the Ether.” That’s what the glow was underneath the water.
Tony eventually slipped back under the covers and plastered himself to Steve’s front again. Steve tried to ignore the feeling of rightness. It didn’t belong to him and Tony had made it clear three times over that it never would. Under his palm he could feel Tony’s heartbeat. Fast. Too fast.
“Bed it is,” Tony says breathlessly as he tries to disentangle his limbs. “I hope you know what you’re doing.”
Even if the undersuit does no harm, it’s still a battle Tony’s losing. It looks like he’s being swallowed from the inside out by a monster. Like he’s caught in the pull of the undertow, dragged under to drown under a sea of perfect gold, and Steve doesn’t know how to help. He’s not even trying. Instead he stares at the car keys clutched in Tony’s fidgeting left hand. They eat up his field of vision until they’re all he can see.
A flood of emotions flicker behind Tony’s sunglasses. Steve only recognizes a few of them. He might never understand Tony well enough to recognize more. It might not matter. Tony tosses him the car keys anyway and slides into the passenger seat.
He sits on Francesca’s screened-in porch and watches the rain fall, soaking into the black dirt of the garden. He lets the faint soothing rhythm wash over him. A heavy shower: the flowers will love it. Steve does too. After a session he always sits on the porch for a few minutes to collect himself. It gives him time to process his thoughts and frustrations before one of the few people who know about Francesca picks him up and drives him back to the Compound. Today he’s waiting for Tony and Tony is, predictably, late.
“We’re definitely not in Kansas anymore, Toto,” he mumbled as he nursed the delicate bones in his wrist, pain singing sharply.
P.S. I may add a playlist chapter to this fic at some point so if it updates to six chapter at some point that’s what’s happening.
“I think he thought it was a type of mechanical bird that lives in water.”
Bucky isn’t fooled. “Siberia.”
Tony’s word had been law. His sanity had anchored it. Without him, Steve’s mind had run rampant. The forest of suicides went up in flames. Then the sky. Pain re-entered the world and the silence was replaced by echoing laughter. A Hell of fire and brimstone; punishment for his sins. But there was ice in him that never thawed. The flames had faded but the ice had followed Steve back from the Ether. That dam that held the beast back.
“She’s coming back.” Steve’s voice is steadfast.
“I was fine.” Tony’s voice was cold. “I don’t belong to you, Rogers.”
“FRIDAY, update,” Tony orders. He’s not climbing into the armor but he’s pulling on as many clothes as possible to compensate. The Iron Man suit shadows him.
. Zemo.” Tony shifts to lean back on his elbows. “I went to see him on my extended Christmas vacation.”
Maldecia is a fictional country that may or may not be the Philippines in all but name.
Tony’s eyes have a dark glint and when Steve finally figures out what he means he can feel a blush rush to his cheeks. There are things two men can do with each other that the two of them have never done. The combination of modern porn and ‘40s fear has rendered the act into something over-the-top and obscene in Steve’s imagination. He prefers hands and walls and silence, Tony likes mouths and dirty talk and off-label uses of furniture, but the closest they’ve come to something more involved is Stark’s fingers wandering to the skin behind Steve’s sac. He’d just assumed that Tony didn’t do more, or didn’t like it.
Steve pauses. “Bucky too, if he’s up for it.”
“Triggers.”
It’s two weeks before it happens again.
It all came undone. It had to.
In less than a second Steve had Tony pinned against the funerary cairn, million-dollar stones digging into his back. The front of the undersuit was now caked in dirt but somehow Steve kept himself clean. One hand snaked its way under Tony’s waistband and set a punishing pace. It was too dry and quick, the friction burning, and it didn’t matter. Tony came violently in his own undersuit, Steve’s arm the only thing keeping him up. The mixture of pleasure and pain was a radical sensation in contrast to the monotony of their aimless, want-less march.
Bucky snorts. “I don’t know which one of us he’s trying to convince. He lies a lot, I try not to mind but it’s hard to hear that.”
“What about Anthony?” Kovalchyk’s voice is much too calm.
Steve blinked up at Bruce. “Where are you going?”
There are days when the only thing that keeps him sane is visiting Bucky. Everything that surrounds the rehabilitation of the Winter Soldier is carefully planned and scheduled - up to and including visits from Steve. We need him to focus on moving forward, the doctors had said as if it was Steve who was the jarring ghost from the past and not the other way around.
Steve can tell Tony doesn’t quite believe it. They’ve all grown too accustomed to standing alone or divided, and Tony’s shouldered it better than most. Expanding the Avengers is a necessity to him but Steve’s wants to make sure it’s a reward too. That what is rebuilt can stand without them because the foundation is sound, and since Steve is not an engineer he needs to find other ways to help.
When he stares for too long Tony shakes his head and Steve knows his time is up.
"No. It wouldn’t,” Tony concludes, sighing. He runs a hand through his already messy hair. “I guess you’ll just have to trust me, Rogers.”
“Are you alright?” Steve asked, every time.
“Where’s Thor when you need him,” Tony grumbles, water dripping from his hair.
Kovalchyk tips his hat. "Goodnight, Steve."
Rhodes and Sam share a look. Then Sam claps Steve on the back. “Grab your coat, you’ve been requisitioned for an important Avengers meeting. Don’t wait for the Colonel to make it an order.”
“You wanted to know the future?” Stark’s tone is shallow, devoid of hope. “
Rhodey says gravely, finishing his signature with a flourish,
Steve didn’t recognize his own voice, distorted by the primitive force of his nature. All the Avengers took a half-step back. All except Tony.
Then, debt paid, he’d disappear and the countdown reset.
He wasn’t fast enough. Steve was always better at this and always had been. Tony’s sprained wrist was broken with an audible snap. Steve threw the shiv away and it skittered across the ice out of reach.
The words don’t seem to register. Stark stares at them, standing shoulder to shoulder, and shakes his head.
“So what do you have your money riding on, Rogers?” Tony turned, expectant.
“You smell like you now.” Warm and metallic and smooth.
It’s the Belgians who undo them.
No one says that out loud of course, so Steve does before Stark or some politician can convince them all that’s not exactly what they’re doing:
“I know,” Stark says, surprisingly sympathetic and his lips quirk sadly. Then, casually, horribly, he spreads his arms wide in offering, baring his weak points. “Show me.”
Tony stares into the sun.
“That’s what you called him.”
Bucky averts his face. “No. He’s been coming around to look at the arm.”
There was a silence and then Tony shifted and winced. “I couldn’t keep it, Steve. I couldn’t let him use me one last time.”
“You didn’t know that when you sat me down.” Kovalchyk picks up his cane and his voice is kind. “It means you’re not too old to learn from your mistakes, Captain.”
“You’re not subtle. I only got bruises on the days after you visited Barnes because I’m still good enough for sex but you can’t stand to look at me. I voice an opinion you don’t like, you crowd me against a wall and choke me on your dick. When you can’t sleep, or when Natasha ignores you, or when you’re just bored, you come around and pick fights. When I actually manage to do something
The Avengers threw Steve and Tony a Welcome Back party at the Mansion. The potluck table was laden with the offerings of busy people with unpicky palates. Sam had made meatballs, Jess had brought cookies.
Iron Man curled naked against the wall is a pitiable enough sight that Steve does as asked. He pauses on the threshold of his room to look back. Stark is shaking, minutely but enough, and it’s not from cold. Steve’s heart aches. Tony wouldn’t want him to see this; so much more intimate than anything they just shared, but any offer of comfort is tainted by their history. It’s still not in Steve to give him privacy, shutting the door feels too much like abandonment.
FRIDAY’s petty. The coffee machine doesn’t even turn on so Steve has to settle for cold, leftover sludge and a night on the couch. He’s still awake at nine when Tony comes into the kitchen. The coffee machine miraculously works for him and when he leaves for wherever he goes Steve finds half a pot left.
In typical Stark fashion, Tony ignores the fact he’s been blatantly caught out. “You gonna stare into my eyes forever?” He nips at Steve’s thumb impatiently before his voice turns husky, “Or are we doing something else?”
Father McKenzie once told him when Steve had still believed in priests.
, like it’s some deeply ingrained part of himself he despises. A weakness of character.
Tony’s fingering something from the inside pocket of his jacket. In the dark Steve can’t tell what it is until Tony draws it out and starts walking it across his fingers. It’s a poker chip.
“Who else will?” Natasha’s eyes are perfectly blank as she sinks the knife in. “There aren’t as many of us as there used to be.”
Tony smirks in malicious glee. “You’re going to hate him, I can’t wait.”
Steve thinks of the barren ice where nothing grows. “Then why plant them?”
Bucky’s pupils shone like black holes. “I would. I’d want to.”
Carol gave him a long, measured look. “You need rest, Cap.”
“He started it,” Stark interjects snidely.
“It wasn’t unfair,” Natasha says as she takes a seat across from the dead screen.
No one wants to argue. The agents all take flight for anywhere else. Natasha seems completely unfazed but Steve isn’t fooled. They’re alone in the silent foyer but that news segment is being broadcast live for a quarter-share of America; condemnation played off as investigative reporting.
None of Richards’s doctorates were in medicine. “What if Tony needs - ”
Steve grabs Tony's wrists. “Quit stalling. Do you think you'll fare better on the floor?”
Steve looks into dark eyes and finds nothing he recognizes there. “What did you do to yourself?”
Steve doesn’t know how to make this better but he knows how to avoid making it worse. “I know what I want." He scratches his fingers across Tony’s scalp and relishes the pleased response. "Bed,” he orders.
“Not that it’s any of your business but I already consulted Bruce about it. I’m fine, Steve. It wasn’t a long-term thing, I promise you.” Despite his words there was something sad in Tony’s eyes.
And then there was Reed with an exhausted smile on his face. “Welcome back.”
But MODOK smiled the same way Steve’s devil always had. His head wound didn’t bleed because this MODOK had been a robot too. From inside the fake-MODOK a white light started pulsing faster and faster -
“I’m glad Tony has you back.”
Clint called it once with good humour. The last time Steve had seen Clint he’d said it in a tone a good deal darker.
What right did Steve have not to be? He spent five months being worried and making stupid bets. Tony spent four years being stripped of his humanity. “I’m fine.”
There’s a gnawing emptiness in Steve’s belly. He ignores it on principle. “I’m not hungry.”
“Promise?” Natasha asks dryly with an icy glare.
Steve felt the broken ice roiling in his stomach. “But you were right. Reed got us out.”
His collection of perfect specimens increases as the sickness within him grows. By the time his birthday rolls around his daily haul produces enough intact blossoms to make his own bouquet. He arranges them in a round, glass vase; a carpet of flowers floating on water. His death jar: a record of love unrequited.
“Tony.”
Bucky says nothing, just stares at the white wall. The silence is the start of the spiral. The spark in his eyes is replaced by a flat expression of disinterest. Steve silently starts gathering the box of crackers and the garbage. This isn’t how he wanted the night to end.
Clint was confused. “I don’t have super-senses but you’re the one who smells like they took a dunk in a vat of Ocean Breeze. Tony only smells like the sea after he spends the night with you or are we all still pretending we don’t know about that?”
“Fury. Maria Hill. Whatever’s left of SHIELD.”
“Stephen tried. I said no and everyone was too busy trying to keep me alive across an interdimentional rift to argue. Can’t really fault their priorities.” Tony let out a deep exhale. “It was easier to keep it all inside when no one knew.”
‘Language,’ the blond chastises mechanically. And then there’s ashort pause before he says with a mischievous smirk, peeking at Tony under his long lashes, ‘Angelic baby blues, huh?’
Steve had to fix him back together after his melt down, and he feels bad for stealing Steve’s own rights to mourn for his missing teammate — and probably, the man Steve loves that he doesn’t know yet. It’s embarrassing to need Steve like that because it had always been the other way around, with him taking care of Stevie. But times can change.
Helping the two soul bonded doesn’t mean he fully forgive Barnes. No, that will take time. Lots of time because it’s about his mother. Maria Carbonell Stark whom Tony loves dearly. The woman who understood that Tony needed to be human before he could don the mask of a Stark man even when Howard was such a horrible husband.
And maybe he can’t fall in love with Steve — he is not — but he sure is allowed to be fond of him. That’s exactly what Tony does as he permits himself to throw a gooey grin at his teammate.
‘Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are on their way, sir,’ JARVIS announces.
Not everyone can stomach him as a person, so it shouldn’t be surprising that Barnes had wanted out before whatever they had could have progressed. Hell, Tony’s sure most of his friends are ticking time bombs and would one by one leave him in the future.
‘I think… I might miss you, Steve,’ Tony says as he closes his eyes.
‘Tony, it’s time for bed,’ Natasha informs as she walks into the workshop. She’s been very strict with his sleeping and eating schedule all thanks to Peppers request to Natasha to keep an eye on him. And when did the two scary redhead team up? Become friends?
‘Nice to finally meet you, Sergeant Barnes.’ Bruce reaches his right hand forward with a smile.
‘I can help you, you know,’ Steve continues. ‘But not unless you tell me what’s got you worried.’ And he sounds so damn sincere that Tony wants to cave in and say fuck to whatever is left of his moral.
His parents weren’t soulmates. Their union was nothing but a business deal.
So, not avoiding. Definitely not.
The hands of fate must have been having a laugh when they’ve finally fulfilled Tony’s wish. That or they were all pissed drunk with Loki because what other deity could have cursed Tony to such a fate: soulmate to none other than Captain America himself.
Barnes goes down to Tony’s shop all by himself now, refusing to have Steve around to metaphorically hold his hand. The other super soldier believes it’s better for his healing, to get slow independence on his own.
Tony looks weak and fragile and broken. And it’s heart-wrenching to see that he deflates the ball he’s been playing with the bots. There’s far no greater pain than watching his soulmate slowly ebb to death.
So, he’s spent his younger years and teenage years on trying to follow Barnes’ footsteps, the amazing sidekick who quietly helps save the world even when no one acknowledges how much he had done and sacrificed.
Barnes stares at the chair like a deer in headlights. The picture of fear is clear in his blue grey eyes.
Oh, and he’s tied up to a metal chair. Great! Why didn’t he notice that before? Right, because his brain was having a hard time processing everything with how painful it is to even blink.
He needs to escape. He’s not going to be leverage for these assholes. They’re not going to be able to use him, no matter the amount of colourful addition on his face, not to mention the twin knives that’s sunk on both his thighs.
And if Tony’s heart isn’t breaking he’d say that they both make such a beautiful picture and pair. Instead he ignores them both and ignores his pain as he mutely orders the soldier to the medical chair. He keeps it for when he’s injured in battles and refuses to go to the medical bay. Bruce reprimands him for it and keeps saying how he’s not that kind doctor, but nonetheless he still fixes Tony’s injuries.
As always, thank you to my lovely beta
And under three minutes the doors of the shop open, and in stroll the super soldiers. He turns his swivel chair to have a look at the both of them. Maybe he can desensitise himself by looking at them, just so it won’t hurt anymore. Maybe.
‘You’re thinking too loud,’ Steve tells him, he has an amused smile on his face.
He invited the two super soldiers to his workshop, where he feels safer. The suits will be around him in case he needed a quick escape when it all gets too much for his poor heart. JARVIS will keep an eye out of him, and so will his bots.
Maybe Rhodey will come for him. But his platypus is busy fighting more important battles that’ll save myriad of people who deserves to live. Not like Tony.
‘Steve’s been looking for you since the day before yesterday ,’ she tells him blankly. But knowing her, Tony’s sure she’s trying to watch him for reactions.
Few more hours and he’s going to to bleed out. And this could be
Well, they can’t blame him, he’s not very sane to begin with. Your soulmate being threatened and in the face of danger doesn’t make the most rational human being either. So, he waits, instead of voicing out his idiotic ideas.
fantastic!
So, who is Tony to deny Steve of anything? The super soldier’s happiness is important to Tony. Achingly so.
While Tony Stark is a narcissistic playboy who doesn’t know where parties end and priorities begin. And also, the Merchant of Death, can’t forget that bit.
One single word.
‘But when, Stevie?’ he shouts. ‘When he’s dea—’
Steve comes back to the tower with Barnes in tow. And stupidly, that’s not the knife that metaphorically kills Tony. No, it’s Captain America’s grave news about learning of his parents’ murderer: James Barnes AKA The Winter Soldier.
‘Wha—’ Steve’s motionless as he stares into the monitor, horror and confusion sits on his face.
‘It doesn’t always,’ Tony agrees just to humour this villain. ‘Word of advice? Accept it and move on.’
‘I’ve thought of that.’ He puts his hands on his hips. ‘Helen said she’ll try to drop in two weeks from now, since she’s busy with the Regeneration Cradle at the moment.’
Accepting facts is easy because it has logical evidence. But nonetheless, it doesn’t mean it will hurt less. No, it felt like someone took away the warmth and light that Tony relied on while he was looking away.
Another wicked smile as he scratches one of his eyebrow with his pinky. ‘Thanks, but no thanks.’ He pulls out a short knife from his back. His adept fingers plays with it, tosses the blade from one hand to the other. ‘We’ve figured something out.’
No one will come
Why is Steve even down here with him? Why can’t Steve sketch somewhere else? Ugh! How many gods did he piss off to be tortured like this? And that all-too-small shirt that Steve is wearing doesn’t help him control his ogling.
. Okay? Byeeeee!
Tony spits blood on the floor and glares at his oppressor.
This is long already and I am holding you back from your last chapter. So, once more, thank you for being here through the journey. And I hope you enjoy this last piece of the story.
‘Can’t tell you… because then, I have to kill you.’
Where is he? What is this cold, semi-dark place that smells of rust and decay? He tries to rummage his hazy brain for clues. And the only thing that answers him back is more pain. God, his head feels like he’s been hammered by Thor himself. It takes him back to those mornings with a hangover. Only worse.
Living with Steve is like having a taste of the what an amazing life he could be living with a soulmate. He’s not sure if it could be more awesome than what he’s getting now — all the genuine concern, the warm smile, the feeling of belongingness — or if he will ever get to experience it.
That's it. Hope you like this chapter! :)
Some people, like his parents do marry someone even when they are not soul bond. There is a statistics that say it works. But only a small percentage. Mostly, like Maria and Howard’s, fails. It’s like the universe cursing the union for trying to defy the odds.
Barnes nods.
Bucky thinks as the tears cascade his cheek.
At least his not bleeding out…
No time or place is safe for the traumas to make their appearance. Tony knows that. In a snap of a finger a moment can suddenly feel like your skin doesn’t fit anymore, or the room becomes too small or too loud or too quiet. It doesn’t make sense.
So, Tony keeps his mouth shut and only utters Steve’s name in the safety of his workshop when he’s alone. And sometimes when the nightmares come to haunt him, he mutters Steve’s name like a prayer as if to taunt his demons that he has a knight to save him. Even when he knows he doesn’t. Still, he pretends that he does.
And they both turn to Barnes, who looks annoyed at being ignored and talked about like he’s not in the same room as the two scientist.
Tony’s not sure if the stranger is humouring him as well, or he’s being honest. But he did say that
‘Are you okay?’ Steve asks him one day when they’re in Tony’s workshop. The super soldier is sketching while Tony’s stupidly marvelling how gorgeous Steve is.
‘Cap,’ he greets back not bothering to stand up. He then eyes the ex-assassin. ‘And you must be the infamous Winter Soldier.’ He refuses to call him Bucky. They’re not friends. They don’t have to be and that’s fantastic.
And that’s his last thought before darkness finally takes him.
‘JARVIS, I hope you’re tracking the source of this video.’ There’s a hardness in Steve’s voice that he’s never heard before. Steve is usually gentle when speaking to people, especially towards JARVIS or the bots.
So, Captain America has to shoulder Bucky’s hidden anxiety, and he has to worry for his friend. Hence, Steve looking worse for wear.
‘Is that a challenge?’ he retorts, raising his eyebrows at Barnes. A wicked smile playing on his lips.
It wasn’t his best moment as well, he gets clingy and panicky when he’s not in the same room as Steve, or when he doesn’t see the man. And the weight of Tony’s loss still brands his chest like an empty crater. It’s the sort of ache that won’t go away. It’s the sort of ache that squeezes your heart time and time again just to remind you that it’s there.
‘Steve,’ Tony mutters again.
But Barnes’ eyes are glued on Tony’s face like he’s disbelieving the genius’ existence.
This one is unbeta-ed because I wrote it sooo late, I couldn't find the heart to burden someone with my unchecked grammar. So, if there are any spelling mistakes or grammar error, please look at it with kindness and tell me in a soft voice, yeah? Thanks.
‘Tony.’ It sounds like a warning, but it’s usual for Steve.
But nothing.
It takes him another day to finally face the music. He hasn’t seen Barnes ever since Steve had brought his soulmate to the tower. Not that Tony’s excited on meeting his competition. Also, there was no competition.
His tormentor has promised a much better means next time he sees him; something wet he said, that had Tony’s breath hitching with fear at the vague indication. He’s still have nightmares about dirty water and gasping for air. And that might just be the last straw that breaks the camels back.
There’s that nagging thought at the back of his head as well that the spy had noticed his forced habit of calling Steve by any and all names but his first name,  throwing the most ridiculous nicknames he can find at the man while keeping him at arm's length. But it’s not as if it’s suspicious that Tony’s using nicknames instead of names because he’s quite well-known for it. The only question is that if Natasha had been keen enough to figure out his deepest and darkest secret.
He understands them both better because he took the same path and carry around a guilt that no amount of self-redemption could lessen the weight of. A road littered with blood and corpses. A road that he doesn’t want to take anymore because this is not the legacy he wants to leave behind.
There is instant relief in the ex-assassin’s feature. Although it is mild, because he still looks like he is ready to flee at the drop of a hat.
‘I see that you’re awake, Mr. Stark.’ A man appears from the only opening in the room. His English is accented with Russian that completely matches his hard military feature. He fits the perfect role of a HYDRA agent.
After the fall of SHIELD, Tony thought she would set up camp by Steve’s side. But she still guards his corner. If he allowed himself, he’d probably hug her and weep. He’s allergic to any show of emotion though, and so was Natasha. Although they have been subtly disgustingly sweet and caring with each other. Ask Clint.
Also just T/W: there is detailed (but not really because I can't write) torture in this chapter, and assumption that Tony is dead. If that's not for you, I'll see you next week where it'll be more fluff. This whole chapter is just angst. Okay, now on you go. Enjoy.
He truly wants to blame Loki for this awful luck.
whoever they is — needs him alive. So, they’re not going to kill him. That doesn’t mean that this bad guy won’t make him suffer though. Sadistic bastard!
Despite trying to avoid The Wonder Twins, Tony finds himself alone with Barnes more often in his workshop than the times he sees or talks to Steve. Not that Steve doesn’t try to have a conversation with him. He just refuses to speak with his teammate.
He’s been busy. Not evasive. And if Pepper found him that one time in his office doing soduko at 1am when he should be home she got him some coffee and closed the door, bless her. Because he couldn’t imagine haunting his workshop as usual, it was team movie night and both Steve and Natasha have override codes.
‘Please.’ Tony snorts. ‘You’re not as innocent as you’d like to seem, Cap. That could have worked with me before. But not now. I know that deep down those angelic baby blues, you’re a little shit.’
To say that it hurts Tony would be an understatement. Rejection has never been gentle with him, and to think after all these years he should be used to it by now. The years doesn’t numb the pain so that one can get use to it.
Just so you know I'm not late, it's still Wednesday here in Spain. :)
‘Oh please… They’ll bargain for you,’ the man spits, putting on his sadistic mask again. ‘You’re their precious teammate. An important person in society.’ He produces another knife. ‘Surely, they’ll come for you and exchange you for the Winter Soldier.’
as well,’ he adds. ‘Tell them to obey… or else they’ll have your body, back in a bag.’
Hello, lovelies! How are y'all? HAPPY NEW YEAR! OMG! It's 2019! And yes, I am late, as stated. All I can say is that I'm sorry. I wasn't really in a good place, and I kinda drifted off into a different place just to get everything off my mind. Thus, I am going to give a S/O to the manhwa that kept me company while on sabbatical:
And gosh, lucky him, he’s got burns littered all over his arms and legs. A few lacerations too on places he can’t specify, because every inch of him hurts that it’s hard to figure out which part of him is not aching. Just
And Tony... he belongs to be alone. Just like how Howard had always said.
He needs to keep calm and think of solutions, because if he looks closely into his current predicament it’ll only spiral him into thoughts that’ll push him into a panic attack. He can’t have that right now.
There’s no denying the presented facts. Barnes’ is triggered by Tony. He’s currently Barnes’ Boogeyman.
‘We’ll it’s hard to stay asleep when your place lacks warmth and cosiness,’ he replies and tries to ignore the uncomfortable dryness in his throat. ‘Also,’ he gestures to his handcuffs, ‘we need to work on consents and safewords for this kind of thing, don’t you think?’
By god, the only thing that’s missing is Steve winking at him or something.
. He watches and waits for any sign of motion.
But they’re not friends. They’re acquaintances, doctor-patient, housemates. Nothing more. And it shouldn’t be more. He should be afraid if he starts to crave for more.
But god is it clear to Bucky what’s happening. It’s written all over Steve’s face with how his eyes looks like he’s seeing Tony for the first time.
‘And then fill it with that star transition?’ he teases lightly. ‘No way.’
‘Well, that’s the plan.’ He shrugs, feeling embarrassed by the praise coming from another brilliant mind. Maybe an even better genius than he ever will be. ‘And I was hoping it’ll help Winter Wonderland here as well.’
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled as he tied off the end. His fingers had always been dexterous and mobile but now they seemed clumsy.
Like a year late, but here it is for posterity's sake.
All three reappeared fourteen hours later in the Mojave desert. They had Tony with them.
He hates that surrounded by people he cares about he has managed to lose everything. He hates that he can’t stop himself from sabotaging what little he has left. Something or someone has to change and everyone else already has. He feels like the lone straggling survivor after a disaster, staring at the rubble and unable to move on while around him the world adapts. Bucky’s re-emerged, Natasha’s a leader. Wanda’s left home, Sam’s struck out on his own. Vision’s becoming more human and Stark dug under his skin to become something less. Steve’s the only one who hasn’t changed. He doesn’t know how. He’s lost.
Steve doesn’t try to put an emotion to the expression on the figure’s face, he just fills in the lines as his memory dictates. It’s easier to concentrate on the details: the strands of hair held perfectly in place, the islands of light in wide black pupils.
Stark chokes back a snigger and Steve has to stop himself from digging fingers into shoulders. He takes his anger out on the shirt buttons instead. Stark’s dark head knocks against the wall under the assault and when he opens his mouth Steve just knows something poisonous is about to come tumbling out. That’s all Stark has left for him anymore and today with the dull glare of the shield behind him, Steve just can’t. He moves to cover Stark’s mouth with his own and then thinks better of it. He sinks his teeth into the cords of the Stark’s throat instead so that all he manages to exhale is a hiss.
“Why did you come down here, Steven?” Strange asked.
“Tony was bonded for nearly four years as
Steve knows what that feels like too, when it seems like Tony has to steel himself just to stand in the same room. “So I take it this isn’t his first visit.”
He couldn’t remember the last time he saw Tony’s eyes in daylight instead of hidden behind dark sunglasses. The jokes didn’t cover Tony's newfound tendency to clean his plate or the fact his personality dimmed when he thought Steve wasn’t looking. Whenever their borrowed car passed a church Tony held his breath.
“How are you doing, really?” Steve asks once it becomes clear he’s going to lose by a landslide. Again.
He stared down into the nothingness of the well as the mortar gave way under his palms, the stones crumbling and leaving him with nothing but handfuls of empty air. He was perched on the edge of oblivion, caught; the pendulum too far forward to snatch back from gravity, with nothing but the beckoning black maw of the darkness below readying to swallow him whole.
It's odd to hear his greatest fear fall from Tony's lips. “I don’t believe that.”
——————————————
“I’m sorry we met this way Captain but your fears with respect to your friend are unfounded,” Kovalchyk says. “I’m merely a consulting psychiatrist. Anthony just wanted my professional opinion.”
He can see the tension climb Stark’s spine. “I can’t change their minds.”
Steve called the bluff and followed through.
He doesn’t want to rifle through his memory to learn exactly when he stopped being
It’s been a nine months since Sam departed to serve out his time in DC. Ten since he’d stepped off the plane ahead of Bucky but behind Steve to be arrested on the tarmac, seven since he was formally discharged from the army. It’s been three weeks since their last video call when Sam had expressed his horror at Steve’s new beard.
Steve knows well enough that it’s all exaggeration, just journos filling dead space before the New Year, except the Avengers have to be above reproach. The line they’re walking is too thin. Tony knows this but doesn’t seem to care.
“Natasha bargained them down from
“It wasn’t that Nat and I didn’t trust you…”
Tony dragged himself up to look over the lip expecting some new unseemly horror. Except the well wasn’t filled with anything. It was bottomless, the blackness so black it played tricks on Tony’s mind and conjured images of all the monsters that lived inside. It was the perfect lair for a malevolent beast that guarded the key that would let them leave. Tony just had to trick him into giving it up.
The BARF glasses have slipped to the floor. The black frames are in pieces now. Irreparable.
“I know.” Tony taps his water glass. “So I drove around to the six nearest restaurants because you missed breakfast and you can’t afford the calorie deficit.” The food comes and he nudges all three plates towards Steve. “Eat.”
Tony can’t wait.
Iron Man’s behaviour in the field became erratic; flip-flopping between perfect obedience and willful defiance. Sometimes he followed Steve’s instructions to the letter, so silent over coms that Steve checked in periodically to make sure he was still there. Other times he was so needlessly headstrong that he contradicted every order.
FRIDAY only lets him out once the Belgians have come through. Special forces hit the HYDRA contingent on a rural highway 48 hours after leaving Antwerp. No casualties. It takes them a week to comb through the acquired intel and hand copies over to the Avengers but it happens. A perfect, politically-correct, hands-off success. They won’t always be so lucky.
Steve tips the two unaddressed envelopes from his jacket into Tony’s lap. “Take them.”
Steve closes his eyes and counts down from ten. “Just tell me why.” He’s sure he’s not going to get an answer until -
“He doesn’t need me. He has Tanaka. And Nat. He likes her.”
“A suit of armour, of course.”
“I’m under house arrest.”
“His choice,” Steve echoed.
“He’s trying to quit.” Sam peers over the door and Steve feels oddly put on the spot. He gestures toward the bare shelves behind the bar as evidence.
Tony doesn’t move at all, gaze sharp and assessing, like he doesn’t quite believe Steve capable of retreat. He doesn’t move away from the edge but he doesn’t move toward it either.
Nat smiles her small, uneven smile as Bucky offers his hand like a gentleman and Steve can hear the universe click into place around them. He has always believed in soulmates and now he knows, even before they do. He’s happy for them, individually and together, but he watches the soft curve of Bucky’s smile and understands that this is what it is to lose before you even knew you were playing.
The punishment never lasted. Death did not exist in Hell. There was no reprieve in the act of killing the enemy and no final damnation for the betrayal of a friend. Steve would sit with the body afterward and the Curse in his ears would die down to a rumble. Then Tony would wake, immaculate, eyes wide in perfect wonder. He’d make promises with utter sincerity and trip over himself to ease Steve’s discomfort. But those stretches of amnesia - of innocence - never lasted. Tony always remembered eventually. If the words existed that would have convinced Tony to let him go, Steve never found them. The final say was Tony’s and it was always
It's breathtaking to watch.
“Well I know exactly what you’re doing and it stops here. We need you,” Natasha says sharply, without sentimentality, but underneath Steve can sense her desperation.
“If you like.” Steve's instincts are going haywire. The stranger is clearly holding something back but how much of a danger he poses remains a mystery. He’s not a physical threat - he’s not faking the arthritic tremors in the hands - but if FRIDAY’s truly offline then there’s no way he came through the active floors. Which means he either came from the direction of the Avengers' private quarters or from -
Finally he slept. The ice quiet.
“He’s a victim too. What he did - what he was made to do…" Steve doesn't voice it aloud. "He deserves what everyone does.“
Tony’s never asked before because he knows already. Every set of lawyers that comes on a mission to bury Steve or set him free asks the same thing. The truth is complicated but it boils down to the same answer he’s always held. Principles aren't principles if you bend them when convenient.
Tony didn’t answer, just removed Steve’s hands from his torso and impaled himself to the hilt. It might have felt fantastic, Steve wouldn’t know because every bit of him was busy being horrified at the pain written in every line of Tony’s face.
Tony wondered how many of those funerary cairns Steve had assembled himself; if each of them was a death Tony couldn’t remember. If each of those devoured, hollow knights in the forest marked a suicide.
Tony fell and Steve watched with nothing but a blank stare.
Steve grinds his teeth. FRIDAY hasn’t given any indication she’s heard his alert. Vision and the night staff haven’t come running. No alarms have gone off. Who knows if Natasha or Tony are even in the building. The smart thing to do would be to march the stranger straight down into the Avengers active area but in a stunning display of shooting themselves in the foot, Steve no longer has access to that part of the Compound between the hours of 11pm and 5am.
After the elation of seeing Tony alive finally faded, Steve was left with the cold hard truth. It had been a month and Tony looked no better than when he returned; pale and thin, with dark circles etched under his eyes and a charming smile that no longer blinded Steve’s careful inspection.
“We should have guessed,” Spider-man yelled as he dodged gunfire, “
They’re facing off on the sparring mats: Bucky in hospital green and Tony in all black.
“The fire’s not hot,” Steve said, mesmerized. To prove his point, he extended a hand into the burning flames and then slowly pulled it out, uncharred. “It’s not even warm.”
Bucky’s heard it all before. He turns the tables. “Has he forgiven you yet?”
The artist in Steve had thought seeing Tony in the present would help. To see him without that expression of terrifying nihilism mixed with heartbreak that Steve can draw from memory alone. Instead it hurts in an entirely different way.
“Tony - “
It’s no reprieve that the man’s scarcely around to rub it in. Even in his absence Steve can feel the spectre of Tony Stark looming over him. It’s baked into the clean lines of the Compound’s design and the array of takeout menus on the fridge. In the inexhaustible supply of food and heat and creature comforts that serve as markers of his omnipresence. It shouldn’t matter: Stark’s housed, clothed, deployed and paid Steve to varying degrees since he woke. Only now is it oppressive, knowing how little Stark thinks of him. It exceeds common decency in sinister ways.
“Tony, wait - “
Most of the time Tony spoke of the other world with casual offhandedness, like it was a crummy vacation to a third-tier tourist trap. Comments like how bars in this dimension were so much more civilized, or how cotton sheets made an excellent change from straw but silk was better. He remarked quite often that running hot water was worth its weight in gold.
"Took off, probably. Or something. Doom's not interested in it anymore, I don't think. Not when it's no longer such easy bait for me." Ironman groaned, "I'm pissed off for fucking falling for it,” he said purposefully, hoping Tony caught on. He wouldn't be getting any passes simply because Ironman had the gall to kiss Steve.
Somehow he did manage to fall asleep, Pepper nudging him awake and setting the pocket watch he was fiddling with on the stool next to his bed. She seemed relaxed, and there was no look of impending dread clouding her eyes like he initially was expecting.
"Oh, God! Tony, I thought you'd been defenseless the whole time, and I was sitting here worrying about you when you've been carrying the damn armor in your body?" Steve yelled, standing to meet him.
“No, no see,” Tony tilted towards Steve, grunting in the process. “If I was being stupid I’d not only let you fuck me as hard and as deep as you’d like, but I’d love to sing you the star spangled banner during.”
"Uh, right." Trap, trap, trap. Tony licked his lips, suddenly very uncomfortable. Correction: more uncomfortable than he was before. "I see. That's why you strapped us together instead of inviting us over for tea."
Ironman nodded, reaching to grasp Steve's hand in their own, "I'm sure you can come. We have a gift for you, anyway. We'll argue about it on the way to the compound." He didn't elaborate that he meant the Accords. Nor did he express his desire for Steve to start therapy. Steve would have to stop being a wanted criminal, first. There was going to be lots of arguing.
Tony froze and then forced himself to relax. “Thanks, Cap.”
The last straw turns out to be a blank postcard. It shows a sunset over a shear rock face in Yosemite National Park. It’s addressed to Natasha in a tight scrawl Steve recognizes as Clint’s. He slowly turns the card over and over in his hands. Outside the window Vision, Falcon, Iron Man and War Machine are practicing aerial formations and attacks. Someone’s laughing.
Steve says brokenly, breath fogging in the cold. He’s clutching a bouquet tight to his chest, an offering to lay at the graves of those he has trespassed.
His stomach grumbles loudly. “I - uh,” he starts, embarrassed, as Tony’s eyes reopen, “I was wondering if you wanted to stop for dinner on the way back.”
Steve lay in silence and contemplated the mercy of forgetfulness versus the mercy of lies.
“You don’t give me orders, Cap, especially not here.”
He leads Steve out of the workshop, the lights automatically dimming behind them. He’s limping, muscles clearly stiff, as they go up a flight of stairs Steve didn’t know existed to one of the guest living quarters. Tony barely waits until they’re inside before he’s pressing himself into Steve, licking into his mouth. It’s not the worst cure for insomnia and even after a three week absence they fit as well as they ever did. At least Tony isn’t avoiding him now. Maybe he finally believes in Steve's goodwill or maybe he’s just desperate enough for a drink, or a friend, or sleep that it doesn’t matter that Steve is all he has left.
“I know Cap, but he can get confused sometimes when I’m not…” Bruce sighed. “Innocent and guilty aren’t always easy to tell apart. The Other Guy might have trouble telling the difference.”
“No, you didn’t. I told you that wasn’t what I thought - ”
Here is the unromantic’s view of Hanahaki’s disease:
The use of his first name hardly registers because Steve finally manages to grab hold of the freed bedsheets, shove Tony approximately lengthwise and throw them back over him. Then he's pulling on his own shirt and crossing the room to the door. He pauses at the threshold and looks back at Tony sitting bolt upright under the covers with a look of such confusion it’d be comical if Steve didn’t suspect dark undercurrents ran underneath.
Instead Steve sits on the edge of the bed, hunched. Tony takes a long time. Long enough that Steve would be worried if enhanced hearing couldn’t pick up a body moving under the shower head. Even once the water is shut off, it’s another decent stretch of time before the door opens and humidity floods the room.
Tony contemplates him and then shakes his head. “You’ll hate it - you already hate it - and let’s be clear: you have no say in what I decide to do to myself.”
It’s a romantic’s disease. The old stories say that the infected die of broken hearts, that the sickness in their lungs feeds on the unrequited love of the host. The supposed cure is as simple: to have that love returned. Many a Gothic heroine has hidden her affliction until her beloved confesses his love as she lays dying on her death bed.
Francesca looks over. “Don’t dwell on it, morning glories are annuals. I’ll have to plant them again next spring anyway.”
Tony might have been imagining someone else but he got the name right. “Steve, Steve, Steve…”
Tony swallowed. “Yes.”
“Gentlemen, if you’re going to settle this violently I would like to leave.”
Steve feels the soft hook of guilt catch. “You’re drinking because I scared you.”
“We don’t talk after.” Tony looks up with unseeing eyes. “That’s the whole point. Don’t ruin it.”
“Please,” he pleads softly and Stark’s head jerks up like he’s been slapped. “You're angry. Don’t take it out on him.”
Alright, let's roll.
"No, it was worse than that. Howard was my idol. He got to build amazing things and everyone loved him - or so I thought. And he loved you. Not romantically, you were just… the only good thing he ever had a hand in making. Or maybe he just missed the war when having a talent for making money and blowing shit up wasn’t
———————————
“You won’t turn me into your villain,” Steve said softly.
“Who are you?” Steve doesn't let his guard down or the man up. “What are you doing here?”
“My own personal cyborg bodyguard, apparently.”
Tony didn’t hide the bondmark on his neck but he gave a different answer every time someone asked after it. Reckless one night stand was a popular one.
(See the end of the chapter for
and the awful number nine.

happened.”
———————————
“I know the Winter Soldier killed your father.” Steve pushes it past his lips and it becomes real.
Steve peeled his eyes away. “Asked by who?”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Didn't you ever wonder why Bucky was avoiding you too? He's not too keen on being the reason you go insane and join the Dark Side."
“Francesca,” Steve corrects. “Her name is Francesca.”
The repulsor sings.
Steve stares down between his knees. “I want to stop making things worse. I don’t know how to say the right words. I feel like I’m losing things when I know I never had them in the first place. I can’t keep promises. I’m… stuck. And everyone else has moved on.”
The youngsters on the team gathered around the fallen armour, suitably awed. Miles looked over at Steve. “How did you know it was empty?”
Steve dropped heavily into the chair as Luke retreated. His listened to the maddening drip of time ticking by before finally breaking the silence. “You remember everything so why aren’t you scared?”
Sam’s shaking his head. “Man, when Jim said you were out of it,
Steve nods. He's planned this out, all his arguments and contingencies. He needs Kovalchyk to understand Bucky and the Soldier aren’t one and the same. He’s going to explain without violence this time. The Compound is silent, absent even the ticking of clocks. There’s just the two of them, a couple of sheets of innocent paper, and the truth.
Steve smiles, imagining the workshop littered with Kovalchyk’s copious cups of tea.
“Seriously?” Tony’s laugh was unkind. “You remember me as well as I remember you. I did everything I could to keep you trapped in the Ether. I pulled every trick I had: sex, lies, secrets, suicides. It was breaking you, I could see it, and I thought to myself -
“I’m just saying,” Bucky says slowly, precisely, “losing every week at basketball might not be worth you giving that up.”
“That’s a mouthful.”
Steve’s swallowed monster strained at his ribs, threatening to tear him apart. “So what do I do about it?”
“Who are - “
Tony took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. “So what do
Kovalchyk may not be a threat but he is a puzzle, maybe even a solvable one. Tony is not.
, was another.
“Which time?” Steve asked. He knelt at the edge of the crevasse and even this close to the heat he felt only ice. He was so tired. “I have so many to choose from.”
Tony snorts. “Too late for that. He knows you're in love with him.”
The scent of the sea made Steve light-headed. “Alright.”
The Iron Man armor hovers over the edge, five feet beyond where the roof falls away. Tony turns to stare at Steve, gaze askew and not entirely from drink. Steve’s grip tightens subconsciously.
The smooth synthetic face of crimson and green stares at him intently. “I do not know,” Vision replies in JARVIS’s voice but with more hesitation than the AI ever displayed. His eyes are gold; open and brilliant. “I can stop them, if that is what you believe would help.”
The stranger checks his old clunky watch and winces. “I don’t. My flight departs in two hours but I can realistically only stay for one. Traffic and security and that whole rigamarole.”
“Doesn’t surprise me.” Steve clasped his hands together. "I used to go to church every week. Never missed it. I always tried to do my best." He gave a heartbreaking little laugh. “And I ended up in Hell anyway.”
Steve hesitates and Natasha grimaces.
"I was your idol?"
“Hypothetically.”
“Are they…” Steve starts and finds his voice is hushed and small, “okay?”
and a repulsor was pressed against his ribcage, gauntleted fingers digging into Steve’s fresh wound, tearing the new stitches. The pain was real and the Ether wouldn’t save either of them from their mistakes this time.
Steve drops back. All the righteous roiling anger in him breaks like a wave and retreats, leaving behind something heavy and hollow that catches in his throat. He’s breathing too fast like he’s run a marathon without the serum and his vision refocuses.
Steve’s eyes narrow. “I think you’re making some of these people up.”
“Well that and spite.”
Steve glared. “You said you’d left us a way out so what are you looking for? A portal, a key, a machine, what?”
“I was the Devil,” Tony whispered hoarsely. “I had come to destroy them all, wearing the skin of their most hated enemy. The Captain was their saviour. He’d sent the Usurper Stark down to Hell and caged the demon they sent back.”
“How’re you holdin’ up?” Bucky asks once the visit’s winding down. He asks that a lot these days. Steve supposes he gets it from his therapists.
He rubs a hand over his chest.
“Breaking out the hard truths are we, Rogers?”
It’s still hard when a bunch of lawyers look at Steve like he’s a particularly dumb animal or once Bucky moves out and their visits drop off or when Francesca’s granddaughter takes ill but the last week of August he brings a black tulip back from Francesca’s cottage and plants it outside his windowsill. It’ll bloom next spring and Steve wants to be around to see it.
Stark comes back to the Compound two days after Christmas dragging a trail of tabloid headlines. They’re nothing extraordinary by Starkian standards: a fling, a fight, some trespassing. The gravestone of a former SI president gets vandalized in Boston. Stark’s new mansion in Malibu is rumored to have three secure underground bunkers. There’s an online petition to revoke Stark’s key to the city in Philadelphia. There’s another to get him charged with treason.
Steve’s anger crumbles to pity. “Bucky’s moving out, he told me this morning. You can’t stop him.” Tony winces. “He’s leaving, I’m not.”
Steve was looking down at him intently, oddly composed. “Are you alright?”
Steve accepts without thinking, letting the actual words of the argument float in one ear and out the other; a skill he honed growing up with too thin walls where the illusion of privacy had to make do for the real thing. The muffled fight reminds him of when he was young; his father would return home, drunk and disorderly, and his mother was awake and waiting. He feels as helpless now as he did then.
“You're worth it,” he says with conviction. He owes Bucky a life. Staying is the least he can do.
This is what the flowers mean:
Steve tries not to think about his loss of restraint in Stark’s office. It’s an aberration, a mistake, and not even the most significant one in his relationship with Tony. Steve hasn’t been avoiding him but their routines have always carried them in different circles and while in the past that had worried Steve, now he’s grateful for it. Because while he may have told Stark to forget it Steve finds that he cannot. He fixates like he used to do with the Avengers’ battles; replaying it in his mind, picking apart what missteps were made and how best to correct them.
Tony shivered, as if Steve’s voice had caused the chill. “Skin was too hot.”
“I didn't know. He didn't tell me.” The closer he gets to Tony the more he seems to miss.
the snide voice in his head says, the one the serum should have drowned, a
“He got back with Bruce about an hour ago, why?”
Tony’s mouth is warm and sure, and the pleasure in Steve’s groin builds until he realizes that besides the obvious he doesn’t know how this is going to end. He has little idea to what modern etiquette requires and when he lurches his hips back Tony’s mouth just follows. He can’t figure out an appropriate warning and when he goes to ask nothing comes out except a sharp, bitten-off exaltation. He holds on as long as he can but it’s nearly too late before he succumbs to temptation and touches. He threads a hand through Tony’s hair to tug his head away.
It wasn’t beautiful.
“Stop it. You called him that.”
He dragged Steve’s hand downward and Steve said the words he knew he should even as his fingers did as they were asked. “We don’t have to.”
as well as he could here - but he’d never trust Tony’s word for it.
Stark’s babbling. Steve may not be a genius but he isn’t stupid. He scans the globe, watching the numbers flex and settle as the typhoon lurches closer. He can see the flawed conclusion Stark’s come to and the absolution he must want if he’s sharing it with Steve. “You’re going to let the storm hit.”
“Captain?” Vision prompts. He doesn’t take orders from Steve anymore but the irony is he trusts Steve’s judgement in this: to know when the border is crossed between an argument between friends and a fight that desperately needs an intervention. Steve has no idea where that line is. Especially when it involves Tony.
“I know.”
“Stop what you’re doing to Steve.” Natasha’s voice is serious to the core.
Bury a Hanahaki corpse in earth and it will beget the most beautiful garden.
“May I?”
Steve knows why Kovalchyk thinks plants would help Tony with his guilt. They helped Kovalchyk’s father deal with his but that’s not Steve’s secret to tell. “You don’t have to do anything. I will.”
Bucky gives a one-shouldered shrug. “Haven’t worn it all week.”
to Tony. Someone who revels in the thrashing pain of others. Steve watches the fake, too-sweet pancake syrup drip off the last soggy square of French toast and wonders how it's come to this.
It’s a wonder Stark’s lies fool anyone. Steve doesn’t really want to hurt him, he just wants to prove his point so he reaches across the gulf between them and presses two finger to the blue of Stark’s ribs -
She gives him the slightly asymmetrical smile that Steve hopes is her real one. Her words cut deeper because of it. “You don’t know any more about me than they do.”
Steve weighed what Tony’s word was worth in this empty place, then he nodded reluctantly. Tony turned in the anointed direction and the two of them struck out across the muddy flats towards an as yet invisible exit. Tony walked just far enough ahead to maintain the careful charade that he knew where he was going. Steve stood just far enough away to be out of Tony’s reach. They trudged for hours in silence. Every time Tony opened his mouth the tension in Steve’s shoulders warned him off. If Steve had indeed met a tree in this place it was no longer to be found on the horizon.
Steve held on tight and didn’t dare pray.
Steve’s decided, he’s committed, (made another vow he swears he won’t break) but his internal resolve doesn’t translate into external action. Inertia carries him forward and a single step off the well worn track seems impossible. He doesn’t know where or how to start. He doesn’t even know how to articulate the problem. He thinks about cornering Kovalchyk, or asking his lawyer, or saying
The spike of adrenaline in Steve’s system has him across the room and inserted between them before anyone can blink. There’s a panicked look on Tony’s face and he holds his hands at his sides, palms forward, but with no repulsors to fire. The Soldier’s expression is wary as he falls into a defensive stance but his gaze flits over Steve’s shoulder to his prey. Without looking Steve grabs a fistful of Stark’s shirt at his chest and shoves him away, hard; the Winter Soldier is the pressing threat -
Steve’s lips quirked sadly. “You would say that.”
Stark is standing unnaturally still, impervious to Steve’s turmoil. He looks… smaller, warmer; more human than the untouchable mogul that has been ruling Steve’s life since his return. Stark’s just staring at him, brown eyes dark and wide and confused, and for once Steve can’t find a hint of dismissal or condemnation. He’s not looking at Steve like he’s a problem or a threat but like a puzzle Stark can’t quite figure out. There’s nothing guarded in his expression just uncertainty mingled with curiosity.
The safety zone is one step and a heavy door away but it may as well be miles. “I made a promise.” Steve grips it like a lifeline.
Steve was torn between anger and gratefulness. “When he wakes up you can apologize in person.”
“I won’t.” He can’t run after Tony now. Bucky needs him.
Her lips quirk. “I don’t think Tony’s up to it right now.”
Stark lets him look his fill. “You don’t know him.”
Maybe the Winter Soldier didn’t do it and Bucky’s just remembering old names in passing. Maybe HYDRA used a different hitman. Maybe Grzegorz just forgot how to swim and Steve’s making a big deal out of nothing.
Steve stared at the nameless motel art instead, letting the ache settle into the pit of his stomach. This was what it was like to be trapped in the labyrinth with the Minotaur and not know the way out. There might not be one.
“Wait, when was Jim in DC?”
“You call him Tony.”
This was an experiment with tropes I could never really get behind, mainly: omegaverse, fluffy Medieval AUs, we-were-married-in-a-different-universe, pregnancy-fic, and soulmate-bonding. I wrote this because any one of those could go horribly wrong. Really, really wrong. I'm not particularly happy with it but it needs to be done now. It was an exercise in writing an atypical reaction to trauma and I think it works as that. Do not take anything in this story as instructions on how to navigate a similar real-life scenario. Neither Tony nor Steve handle the situation well. Also, I'm sorry about what I did to Peter.
The dark line in his peripheral vision saunters forward until Steve can discern a figure in jeans and a dark T-shirt. He looks like the Tony in Steve’s better memories: comfortable and casual. Tired and not bothering to hide it. Stark always looks untouchable these days, as if he were made of nothing more than money and words, and to see him less so makes something in Steve’s stomach lurch in recognition. it's longing and helplessness tangled up with that voice that knows that even before they were never perfect.
“Not all of them. The perennials you only need to plant once and they’ll regrow provided the conditions are right. The annuals only live one season, they don’t survive the first frost.”
The victims aspirate flowers.
Later he realized what was missing.
his mind echoed.
————————————
“You and what evidence?” comes Tony’s reply. “You can’t be here because you’re confined to your room after dark. Doc can’t be here, he doesn’t have access. FRIDAY’s down due to a scheduled maintenance blackout. I'm safely locked away in my workshop downstairs. You want to take this to the council be my guest.”
It should have been a paradise. They were gods here. The Ether drew landscapes from the minds it was connected to but to Steve this endless, infinite place was a hell and so it had become one. It had Tony’s desert, Steve’s ice, and death-without-Death everywhere because the real thing wasn’t allowed. The mortal part of Steve knew he should have been long dead by now and so had taken this place that would not let him rest and had warped it into an underworld that punished them both.
Natasha shoots him a glare that would kill lesser men.
“What was it like?” Wanda asked, curious. “I heard you built a world.”
“Seconds, Captain Rogers?” Vision asks like nothing’s wrong. As if they’re not witnessing Stark’s last, oldest pillar of support crumbling and aren’t housed under his unstable roof.
“You know what pisses me off the most?" Tony asks hoarsely. "You keep pretending like you didn’t choose him then and you aren’t choosing him now. The Avengers matter to you - great - but stop pretending you’re looking out for me. You’re here for Rogers, Rogers is here for Barnes, and Barnes is here despite my previous best efforts. You and I aren’t friends, Widow.” Regret colours his voice. “We had our chance.”
Tony isn’t distressed at all. “FRIDAY would catch me.”
“I can’t sleep,” Steve says when it swings open.
Steve should have remembered the double-edged nature of all things Stark. BARF is both a therapeutic tool and a torture device. Who doesn’t crave emotional catharsis? That’s the temptation but beyond it Steve can see the bottomless pit of self-recrimination waiting. It’s a Faustian bargain; knowledge for your soul. A
“-top! Hey -”
“Lang was before Christmas. I don’t know for sure if it was Clint but someone kept following me to meetings and shooting at me with the arrows I designed for him. Anyway, Natasha didn’t seem concerned when I told her someone was taking pot shots at me, so either she hates my guts or it was Clint.”
“No. It wasn’t.” Nostalgia is a powerful drug.
No one can get hurt here. Not Bucky, not Tony. It can’t happen again and Steve can’t let it.
Bucky turns away.
A year ago this week, Steve drove the edge of his shield as hard as he could into the arc reactor.
Tony had stood with his back to the edge of the crevasse. The pit held the only true fire in this place and the heat rose in a hazy shimmer.
“Tell me he’s dead. Tell me he can’t hurt anyone ever again.“
Him and Tony have a history apparently. They’re in the same boarding school photos, they have the same arresting officer for public intoxication, and then suddenly nothing. The excerpts from their respective biographies reference a childhood friendship that ended in flames in their early twenties and put their respective companies on a collision course. The blond has given several interviews obliquely slandering Tony since then but they’ve had no connection, business or otherwise until last night.
“Nice?”
They went back. Steve had braced himself for a trial or a fight or forgiveness. He meticulously planned what he’d do if he got each one. He’d stepped off the plane onto US soil and surrendered himself, literally and metaphorically, to the powers that be.
“Well, well, well, look who’s been doing their assigned homework.” Stark smirks but it’s not playful. “Are you honestly trying to strongarm me into following the Accords? I don’t know if either of us will survive the irony of that.”
Every breath he takes causes the blossoms to ripple, the esters tickling his nose from the inside. He reeks of amaryllis, of lilies, of hydrangeas. Everything tastes bad when the rhododendron is so heavy in your nostrils you can taste it but it goes well with gin. From then on he prides himself on the optimal drink pairing for every brand of loneliness. Morning glories favour a pinot grigio, columbines a good Kentucky bourbon. Aloe loves a Long Island iced tea. The floral scent leaks out of his pores, overwhelming the alcohol on his breath.
“Steve! Cap!” Tony gasped. “What's going on?! What happened?!”
“I’d like it if we talked.”
He looked down. He’d re-opened his stitches sometime during the night. The wound was bleeding sluggishly through his white T-shirt. The red reminded him of the colour of armour.
Steve watches him go before retreating. Outside his suite window, Vision stands in the driveway, impervious to the rain. His liquid gold eyes shine in the dark, staring at Steve from 100 paces. Vision could have stopped them. Maybe he should have.
Steve feels his frame vibrating with the effort to keep still. “What did you do to Bucky?”
“Difficult when no one gives you the slightest bit of cooperation, isn’t it?” Tony says, panting in effort.
Steve stares straight out the dashboard. “I know you’re trying.”
“You can trust Nat with her part. She loves the Avengers. She’ll come back.”
Despite its narrowness the river was deceptively deep and the bottom dropped away almost instantly. Tony was a competent swimmer but he found himself fighting the current as if it were a riptide. The water was too viscous to be any form of true water. It was like swimming through syrup and with each stroke Tony sunk further in. The floating white tendrils snagged his calves and arms like kelp as he swam, begging him to follow and let the flow take him where it wont. He closed his eyes and the river’s triumphant gurgling rang happily in his ears.
It was not as wholly silent as Tony had first believed. He could hear the faint rush of water in the distance and he stumbled like a newborn ibis across the flats, navigating by ear until he found the river. Like the sky, the river was hardly archetypical of its species: it was narrow but the murky navy surface was streaked with stripes of white scum racing violently down the rapid course. Not for drinking then but it’d do for washing.
“I was going to say
“Well I wanted Rhodey but realistically who else were we gonna nominate? Viz occasionally forgets humans can’t phase through walls. You were not my first choice.”
“You shouldn’t thank me. The system's not mine.”
Steve stepped into the frigid water and held out a hand in invitation. Tony had the key. He rolled the magic word across his palate before swallowing it down. He could depart the Ether on his own but he wouldn’t. He’d promised Steve he wouldn’t leave him behind.
“Good,” Stark says and Steve glares, all careful neutrality forgotten. “The longer it takes to break his conditioning the stronger his legal defense for
“You tell me,” Steve’s frustration deepened, “you’re the one who brought us to this place.”
It was horrendously beautiful, like no Hell Tony could ever hope to deserve.
Steve frowns. “No, you’re not. You don’t like being hurt.” He hesitates, ten paces behind. “I don’t like hurting either.”
“Alright…” Tony says suspiciously. Steve starts undoing Tony’s tie, the silk rushing through his fingers. Tony frowns. “You’re not fighting me on this.”
Then Stark walks in armoured to the throat and that’s the end of that.
Jim’s been gone for six months and now he’s back, casually discussing his relationship with Tony like it’s a driver’s licence renewal: something you can occasionally fail at because if you both want it strongly enough you can just try again. He makes it seem so simple, like Leonardo da Vinci explaining how to paint.
He had walked a lot in the Ether. He had traced out the boundaries, following the seams far off into the horizon as they curved ever so slightly in their perfect geometry. Nine circles, one encompassing the other, all them holding within wonders that flickered between horrific and beautiful in the eye of the beholder. He’d always returned to the same spot he’d started.
Then Stark makes his fatal mistake: he steps too close. Steve could have sworn his left hand was locked to the railing but it shoots out to grab Stark’s arm. For a moment neither of them move, they’re teetering on the precipice, spoiling for a fight to take the edge off their mutual frustration.
, Steve, why did you think he was always so guilty around you? He knows he can’t repay you the way you want. I didn’t tell him, he just knows.”
Steve draws a steadying breath. “I have.”
“It’s beautiful.”
“…and you wanted him to come back.”
Steve can hear the capital ‘L’ implicit in list and knows Bucky means the list of the Winter Soldier’s assassinations. It makes sense that Stark would tell them. Tony doesn’t like to repeat mistakes either.
“So I owe you an explanation.” Tony sat close but not touching, a distinction not lost. “If you keep pulling the story out of Barnes, he’s going to keep leaving me panicked voicemails.”
“That’s odd, given you know so much about me.” Tony leans his head on Steve's thigh through the lawnchair. “He’s not a genius. That’s what I learned. I thought that he had to be; to play us all so thoroughly, but nope. He’s just a guy. He knew less than nothing about me, about you. He was just obsessively loyal and driven by revenge, and so saw it everywhere in everyone. That was his advantage: he’s only human.”
The haughty dismissal was the last straw. Steve bared his teeth and ripped the newspaper out of Strange’s hands and a moment later he was thrown across the room by an invisible force.
Tony doesn’t bother looking at him. “You didn’t.”
The Compound is dry. The Sitting Duck (and what a terrible name) has become the unofficial Avengers hangout for when they need a beer. It’s so normal now that it’s difficult to remember that Tony’s sobriety didn’t come easily. Steve can’t get drunk regardless of how many drinks he has. Tony can’t have one for the flood that follows.
He shivered despite the temperate climate and levered himself with difficulty onto sore, blistered feet. There were footprints in the mud leading off in various directions, criss-crossing each other like a hideous stampede. No birdsong broke the monotonous silence. The flat light made his bare limbs seem paler, skin dotted with smears of brown muck and dried blood. He was naked but otherwise mostly intact. There was a bump near his hairline that hurt dully when pressed. The skin around his collar felt raw. With numb fingers he traced the edges of three small, circular punctures in his abdomen. They weren’t bleeding but the internal ache made Tony worried they ran deep. He couldn’t remember how they came to be.
Tony had been right to run. It was he who had woken it in the first place.
because that’s worked out so well for us in the past - ”
It was the best he could do. He
“Tony's gone," Steve tells Bucky when they finally allow him to visit. "He wants to spend Christmas in Malibu.”
Tony knew he should have called for Steve. He had promised not to leave him behind but that vow fell by the wayside like it had so many times before. He struck out alone across the glowing ice, the sheets releasing great cracks at intervals underneath his feet. There were shadows moving under the translucent ice but the thickness obscured any details. Tony staggered towards the lake’s center on numb feet. He didn’t know what he’d find but if this was a Hell then it had been designed for Tony. If it was meant to punish him then so be it but he’d find a way to make whoever -
“How about
“I know you are.” The words caught in Steve’s throat. “
Four days from now, the 18th; skipping over the anniversary completely. Steve knows why Bucky wants this. He understands guilt and the need to keep your wounds from bleeding onto others and like the hypocrite he is Steve still wants Bucky to trust him with all of it.
“Stop calling me that!” Steve yells, loudly enough it echoes through the empty rooms.
Steve feels sick. He knows better than to rely on Tony’s forgiveness. “That’s not the way it works.”
“FRIDAY, who was it?”
Natasha nods towards the man in the cell. “It won’t be pretty." It’s said too sagely for it to be entirely hypothetical to her. "He’ll need you after.”
It all comes spilling out on Tuesday because Bucky can tell something’s wrong. “What do you think he wants?”
“Not yet.”
Steve can’t help the soft smile forming on his face. “Deal.”
Steve releases the breath he’s been holding for years.
“And it didn’t,” Kovalchyk reminds him.
“He was. That’s why we proposed him. They won’t see past the suit and the rank.”
Tony replies and there is old, worn bitterness underneath. Steve fell back in love at the same time he made sure Tony could never love him again. Maybe to survive Hanahaki you need both. Maybe that’s why so many die.
“Yours maybe,” Stark mumbles and Steve hates that the future seems to be built on easy relativism. It only makes him grasp his absolutes harder.
If Steve says nothing there’s no doubt Tony will strip naked in the hallway. Another performance, another stab at instigation, all of which means nothing because, “I can’t be bought, Stark.”
“FRIDAY, superimpose the radar map.”
The Soldier capitalizes on the distraction. He bucks Steve off and flips them in one smooth move. His weight keeps Steve down but leaves the assassin’s back exposed to Stark and that’s not a good thing either because even if the Winter Soldier has taken over Steve can’t let Iron Man take that shot.
He was rewarded with a smile. One of Tony’s real ones, soft and slow. That, at least, hadn’t changed. Not like the swearing, not like the bite.
“я выигрываю,” Bucky says in a flawless accent Steve’s never heard from him before.
“Neither did you,” Steve said in case no one had.
The string at Steve’s core tightens and he doesn’t know why. He’d never begrudge Tony his own reconciliation. “Tony must be happy.”
Steve holds his tongue. This is their line. Anything further could too easily cause irreparable damage to themselves or the garage. Steve is familiar with following rules of engagement. He lets the silence stretch, tacitly granting Stark's point.
“I think I got the same speech in reverse except mine was pretty much all yelling.”
“James Buchanan Barnes. The Winter Soldier.” Steve advances and the stranger retreats into his chair.
Tony gives a barking laugh, more hyena than human. “I can’t believe I used to think you knew what you were doing. I literally followed you into the jaws of death and despite constantly yelling at me for making shit up on the fly you’ve been doing the same goddamn thing.” He runs a hand over his face. “God you were such a hypocrite.”
“When you need one.” Bucky’s expression is genuine and Tony nods in acknowledgement.
“Stop what?”
“Beautiful?” Steve finished, utterly oblivious to his own allure. “You seem to think it is.”
Tony blinked, dizzy. This place wouldn’t let them sleep or die but it would let Tony forget for awhile. He got to forget Steve’s look of remorse as he drove the shiv between Tony’s ribs and then twice more. He got to forget being smothered face-first into the mud until he’d finally stopped breathing, and the act of tying his own noose with shaking hands in a forest. And each time Tony got to wake up new and full of wonder as Steve tried again and again to trick the Beast that had trapped him here into giving up the key that would let him leave.
Steve uncurls his fists and sinks into the chair next to hers. “It wasn’t true.”
“Why are you here?” Steve asked harshly.
“Yeah,” Tony sounds vaguely disgusted, with himself or the Accords it’s impossible to tell, “unfortunately for them I like my liquor and Rio sucked. AIM even offered me a job and before you yell, I’m pretty sure blowing their bunker to kingdom come counts as me turning them down.”
“You’re suspended,” Steve said without preamble when he found Tony in the common room that night. He still didn’t know what game Tony was playing with them all but it wouldn’t be a liability in the field anymore.
It’s hard sometimes to separate Stark’s startling brilliance from his very human fallibility.
Tony tears his eyes away to look at Steve and for once his gaze is unguarded. He looks broken; like Steve’s buried his shield into Tony’s heart and started to dig. Ages ago Steve would have said it was a fitting reply to a damaged shield left outside a door. Now that he actually sees the pain writ large he wants nothing to do with it. He doesn’t know beyond begging for a time machine how to make things better. He needs to say something but it feels like there’s a lead anvil sitting on his chest.
That same unfamiliar expression flickered across Tony’s face and Steve only now realized it was pain. Before he could move there was a familiar
, no. He only knows something bad happened and no one’s talking about it. And now you know and you won’t come home. You’re the second supersoldier to run across the country to get away from me. You’re gonna give me a complex.”
Tony wrapped his legs behind Steve’s back, preventing him from withdrawing. “I’m fine, Steve. Seriously.” He leaned up and kissed him softly, like Steve was the one who needed to be comforted. “Make me feel good?”
Steve’s glad his hands are confined to his pockets. “Don’t jump.”
A yawning chasm opens up beneath him. It’s a scene from his nightmares.
Bucky shifts away and Steve feels a chill even though the room is perfectly temperature-controlled.
“Why should I?” Steve retorted.
“Alright, lets take a shot at your version.”
What else can he do? He nods. “Thursday.”
Tony stopped pretending to smile. He hunched like a gargoyle on top of the parapet, beautiful and grotesque. “You’ll die.”
A heads up that the next update will be two weeks from now. Turns out I ate all of my lead time already so in the interest of not rushing the conclusion we're looking at the end of February.
“We should do this again,” Steve says. He hesitates to ask for more. “Maybe next Thursday? Or Tuesday? I know you’re busy.”
Sometimes when Steve gets up for his early morning run he finds Kovalchyk in the kitchen rummaging around for tea. He plays Scrabble with Vision over dinner these days because with Steve’s schedule filling up he sleeps through the night. He watches as Tony goes to galas with Pepper and comes back from galas with Pepper. His Spanish is still atrocious. It’s driving FRIDAY insane.
His gaze flicks open at the same time as Steve’s hand leaves his hair. Behind them the blue hologram of the world shows the spinning typhoon obscuring the Eastern edge of Maldecia. The percentages in the simulations jump wildly for an instant before stabilizing. Landfall means that so far the Accords have kept the Avengers back, so far they’ve kept their word. The mission’s gone from preventative to active.
She hasn’t answered his original question and her forthright stare dares him to ask again. “Trust me, Steve. Don’t wait up.”
Steve worries, unsure how to ask if Tony needs help.
“It doesn’t matter. You don’t want to,” Steve replied finally, eyes glued to the horizon.
Steve pretends that he was ever good enough to catch her lies. “Alright.”
“Please, just… trust me. I’ll do whatever you need me to.” Steve holds his hands out in surrender. “I promise.”
becomes
“Thank you, FRIDAY,” he hesitates, “I miss your voice.”
Iron Man, Vision and War Machine can take bullets just fine. The Black Widow can’t.
When he knocks Steve knows better than to open the door.
Wanda doesn’t come back. Her application for a US visa is rejected on the grounds of previous ties to a known terrorist group. She’s rerouted to the Netherlands who take more kindly to her situation. They remain heavy proponents of the Accords though and Steve is already prepared for the day that her gratitude towards her new home eclipses her hatred of Stark. Clint doesn’t come back either. He says he’s be better off in the wind and Steve just nods. No one not an Avenger ever learns Scott Lang’s name. He slips back into the US and Steve scans the daily reports for any news of his arrest.
“Maybe he’s telling the truth.” Steve can’t quite look Bucky in the eye for the envy he’d spot there. “And even if he isn’t - none of it was your fault.”
Rhodey warns.
Stephen arrived within the hour. He wasn’t alone.
He didn’t do anything more. Tony’s strength simply gave out and he slipped silently into the hellpit. Steve didn’t remember any sounds it was all just… blank tape. The soundtrack excised.
to drown out the memory of
Kovalchyk’s smile is nostalgic. “Howard Stark was one of the last pieces of the past my father dropped. I think despite their conflicting worldviews he admired Howard enough to want to like him. The last and only time I met the Starks, I was 17 and Anthony was one. Everyone called him Anthony then.”
“Bucky’s doing well.” That’s what Tanaka always says. Never
“‘Cause you don’t look great,” Sam continues. “I mean beyond your freakish figure you seem…” he shrugs without finishing. “Does Stark let you actually do anything around here?”
The soft click of the conference doors locking is the only warning Steve gets before he’s pushed up against the railing behind him. It’s only surprise that gets Stark that far, Steve rights himself ready to push him right back before -
There’s silence after that. Tony crosses his arms and stares out the window while Steve moves pieces of cold spinach omelette around his plate. The french toast isn’t sitting well in his stomach.
Tony made it to the edge of the copse in a daze, panting from exertion as Steve crept up nearly silently next to him. Stretched out ahead was an uninterrupted view of the desert. The dunes rose in peaks and troughs following some unknown pattern. The flaming rain streaked slowly through the atmosphere like the slow-motion debris from some hidden inferno. Spitting embers to make up for the absence of stars. The orange against the dark sky seemed so very alive as the meteorites fell and buried themselves in the sand before dying.
If Stark wants an outside opinion, give him that.”
Sam was at breakfast the next morning. “Steve…. What is that?”
The water never dipped below mildly cool. Tony had designed it that way.
But Tony had proved himself a different kind of Adversary. He couldn’t let the man he loved die even if it made him hate Tony. Even if he had to suffer at Steve’s hands over and over and over. It was those little-deaths that ironically kept Tony sane and made Steve madder. Every fresh betrayal begot another as they corrupted their paradise and dragged it further into Hell.
Tony’s pacing in the half-dark of the corridor, coiled and furious. He’s in a perversion of his normal business attire: jacket missing and left shirtsleeve half-rolled up. His tie is gone and so, mysteriously, are his socks and shoes. His hair isn’t the well-groomed coif he sports in the morning but sticking up in all different directions. Under the glow of the nighttime lighting the line of his jaw is too sharp, over-emphasized by his goatee. The dark of his eyes is alive and fathomless.
But there was nothing. On the screen Tony had been glorious in technicolour: fashionable and charming and untouchable. He’d smiled, lower lip curling slightly upward, a calculated ploy to draw his mark in. The interviewer leaned closer, unable and unwilling to resist the promise of more. For a moment Tony’s eyes flicked towards the camera and Steve had thought maybe Tony could see him.
“In that case let the record show I promised
Tony exhales through his nose. “I don’t know, I’m still pretty stuck in
. Tony talks to her like she’s a person and the rest of the Team and Compound follow suit. The fact she’s missing in action raises Steve’s suspicions further.
(Tony in heat had always been voracious and energetic, and God they used to have
They were real once. Him and Bucky. Before.
“I didn’t mean the kitchen.” Steve’s voice is hard. “What are you doing here?”
Then later, “He’d shave me. Sometimes he kept the beard, the mustache, sometimes he got rid of it all. He’d hold me down and just... decide who I was going to be.“ Tony ran a finger along the underside of his jaw. “He never even nicked me.”
He tell himself it’s better than fighting.
“I need help.” He only says it when he’s alone and it can do no harm. “I can’t… I don’t know what to do.” His reflection in the new coffee pot says nothing back. “I don’t know how to fix this.”
“You left me there.” Steve found himself crying silent tears. “The Ether fell apart without you.”
Steve swallows. “I’ve always thought so.”
He stays up all night watching as Stark’s future collapses into being.
. Tony hadn’t said it either. Steve swallowed. “I’m grateful I’m alive.”
Steve surveyed the crowded whiteboards, the running clocks, and came to the one conclusion he could. “How long has this been going on?”
He sets out to seduce Steve all over again with art galleries, good food, and great sex. With gadgets and donations and gifts. Steve smiles in all the right places, he’s appropriately grateful. When they hold hands Tony can feel Steve’s wedding ring against his fingers. It’s like the good ole days except for the lingering perfume of flowers ever lurking in the background.
Right.
Steve crashed into him; somehow enveloping Tony in the best, bone crushing hug of his life yet without damaging the bouquet in the slightest. It lasted only a few moments before Steve released him, but Universes was it the best few moments of Tony’s entire life.
Tony gasped and focused on breathing. Just breathe, in and out. In and out. Gotta make Brucie-Bear all sorts of proud.
Tony gave a half-hearted shrug, keeping silent the rest of way back to the mansion until he shut himself away inside his room.
"Tony, hold up!" Steve called from behind him, but Tony kept up his pace. He wasn't angry. He wasn't ... Ironman was him. They shared this broken body together, housing fragments of the pain he'd endured from Afghanistan, from Vanko, from staring into the blackness of space through the portal and falling aimlessly to his death. He did his research. After, after Siberia, he finally chose to see a psychiatrist. He was working on taking his meds and remembering to do his mindfulness breathing exercises. He was trying to stop the catastrophic thinking.
They kissed for what seemed like hours
“God Dammit I’m sick of this!” He yelled and threw his dining room table over. He threw the bottles, the glasses, all of it. He was bordering drunk, and everything still hurt deep inside his bones.
"Okay, lumberjack yes, rugged no."
Steve's eyes widened, the lights flickering back on with a swipe of his finger on the keyboard. "We're being monitored."
“When you’re feeling better I’d like you to come with me and meet Bucky and Gail,” Steve said briskly. He shifted his gaze on Tony’s throbbing cock, hoping to ease the sudden anxiety building in his chest.
"If we're all quite ready," Doom startled Tony, circling around the machine with a funky-looking wrench in hand. Seriously? He made his servant go and fetch just that? Tony really felt like he was in an old-school sci-fi but yet was more than ready to get his hands all over it, assuming it didn't kill him.
, He  thought miserably, clenching the sheets between his fists. “Pep, I can’t, I…”
“But I can do this.” He said to himself once she had left. “I can. Pep’ll handle the shop and I’ll handle being a hermit for a couple days.”
"Maybe Doom is more of a genius than I've been giving him credit for," he mused, gesturing for Steve to sit right back down before the Supersoldier regrets it.
“Cap.” Tony interrupted him, hesitantly moving towards Steve and the bouquet. “Steve,” Tony corrected himself, “are you trying to ask me out? Like, on a date?”
Steve snorted, feeling hot all over. “That’s a fantasy alright. I guarantee you’d be choking on my name.”
Steve would understand. He was always a kind and gentle man, patient when it mattered. He'd be happy to learn Tony discovered how horrid singing sober genuinely was.
Truly?
"Tony?" Steve asked softly, turning as best he could in Tony's direction. Well, at least being tied together back to back meant Tony had a fantastic excuse for not having to look at him.
Doom simply tugged at his shoulder, directing him opposite of where his guards where taking Steve. "Answers Doom was already glad to give. Perhaps you were aware the Legion was an intentional invitation. The Captain, unfortunately, is an unexpected guest." He was leading Tony into a rather ornate dining hall, draped in purples and golds. There were fruit bowls on either end of the dark wood table, while a fire burned inside the fireplace center of the wall. "Come, sit," Doom commanded.
"Hey, Tony," Steve said, hurt, but finally shifting his weight off Tony's much more lithe frame (he wasn't small, how dare you even think it).
"More than you can imagine," Steve replied, sorrowful. He began to walk towards the lab's entrance, "There's a chance there's a transport of some kind tucked away in here, figuring that we got here somehow. These guys, and the guards. But, since the place is mostly deserted we could blow a hole in the wall instead?" There was a hopeful glint in his eye. "We could, uh, finishing yelling at each other after?"
Steve touched his thumb to Tony’s eye. “There’s no need to for you cry, is there?” He grimaced.
This was the exact reason he was here in the first place.
"Yes and no. What, you thinking this is the end of it?"
"He mentioned some nonsense about a time machine. Totally sounds ridiculous because it is. I think he's got more dirt on my tech than he's letting on. And, I'm without a doubt that he's interested in my latest armor as well."
"Yes. Of course. Absolutely. But the suit’s also in me. Literally. Call it an upgrade if you will. I don't want tall, green, and probably handsy discovering it." Then he intended to explain the rest of it. Most of it, anyway, excluding the whole “Tony's an idiot when it comes to EMP's” thing. Instead, he was taken aback by Steve's genuine look of concern. "You're cuddling me."
"Everybody's bound to know we went at it by now, Steve," Tony decided to comfort him. "It's ...it's just--" This was the hard part. "Why did you kiss me? Why did you kiss me back?"
It soothed Tony's broken heart enough that he switched focus onto the room they happened to find themselves in. It really was exceptionally dark, but it there was enough light, once his eyes adjusted, to spot the glittering of machinery and tools scattered in disarray. There were various tubes and from what Tony could see, something that looked like a mini-submarine towards the end, near the wall. Stark--hah!--amongst the vague darkness were the beaming eyes of his Iron Legion was standing at attention a few feet where Steve and him were bound together.
He got himself to make a round or two days later on the main floor. It was bustling with customers and fans alike when he stopped dead, eyes locking with Steve’s beautiful pair of blues. They widened, hopeful, as Steve hesitantly stepped forward, breaking into a smile.
"The genius didn't think to bring a notepad." Steve said wryly. Then Steve was right there, hovering close and caressing a thumb along their cheek. "I can wait. Tony will tell me, won't he? How he feels? What he wants?"
Hours?
"Shh!" Tony cut Steve off. The sound of heavy footsteps thudded along the stone floor as a caped figure stalked through the narrow doorway. He was tall, dressed head to toe in glittering silver-looking armor that was adorned with a green, fluttering cape. Victor von Doom, ruler of Latveria, a small country in Europe. A Proud scientist and inventor, from what Tony could gather on the guy. Doom had all the juicy details about himself heavily encrypted, which was a pretty huge testament to his brilliance.
The silence stretched out, long and unending.
"The Legion's still missing."
"Did I do that?" A beat. "Ah, yeah. Okay. I absolutely did that. If you're mad about it, you should be a hundred-percent aware it's your own damned fault. I absolutely don't forgive you, by the way. I--I can't forgive you. Not right now. It's too soon." He averted his eyes. "But by the power
"Hmph," Doom cut in, stepping between them. "I see. This explains much. Bold of you to presume Doom would allow you the comfort of one another's company."
“A miracle then,” He said, voice rough with sleep.
"You weren't too upset about it!" They were getting off track. Something was off. Doom shouldn't have been so easy to take down.
Tony had never heard Steve babble like this before. Steve was nothing but the straight forward, to the point Captain. But, but Steve liked him so much that Steve was suddenly an adorable mess?
He kicked the unbroken bottles out the door and suddenly felt winded, picking one up and ripping off the cork, sliding down against the post. He’d kicked out his flask too, empty as his stomach.
The three of them--if this was going where Ironman hoped it was going. A bit of a bitter hope, on his end. A painful one, on Tony's. "Stay close." He focused on the task at hand, "And be ready." The backs of Steve's fingers delicately tracing the sensitive skin of his cheek made him shiver, their--his and Tony's--fingers tapping away, breaking down Doom's programming to its bare bones and initiating the self-destruct sequence.
“Pepper caught him before he could rile up the rest of the town.” She said, meaning Peter.
He drowned in whiskey to numb the pain but it numbed fucking nothing. There was no liquid courage, no nothing, not anymore. He drank to stifle the anxiety but was still hiding away like some pariah afraid to face society. He drank and he was still so terrified to even look at Steve in the face.
Tony agreed, apprehensive about continuing to follow Natasha. He wasn’t ever really alright. And no, he was most certainly not fine, but it was either turn around with his tail between his legs and stare at the ceiling till morning or break open the nearest drop of alcohol he could find because he didn’t know how to do this on his own.
“Delightful,” Tony merely sighed. Which meant Tony wasn’t going to listen to the medical aid at all. Instead, he had persuaded Steve to carry him down where his most recent servant, “Jarvis” was waiting for them, no doubt concocting his own plans to deal with whatever the hell was going on.
"I love you," Tony said simply. He finished that second cookie and stood up, slowly working on stretching his muscles.
"Hey, I get that reference." Steve gave a shit-eating grin, all-the-while still glowing bright pink up to his ears.
Tony scrunched up his nose in distaste, "Worried? You were Frenching me for like a whole thirty minutes over there!" He pointed down the hall with an arm. Apparently Ironman’s hints went right over Steve’s head in the heat of moment.
"Tony," Steve complained. "Riding you wouldn't be too aerodynamic. We'd have to embrace, I think. Am I the perfect height? Probably." Then he pressed the entirety of his body flush against Ironman's front once he turned Ironman away from the monitor desk. "Like this, yes?"
Footsteps echoed behind him.
The size of Doom's staff inside the (sort of?) fake castle was underwhelming. There were the four people in lab coats, and barely twenty guards plus the seven Steve took down in the lab. The caste itself was underwhelming upon further inspection. Horribly underwhelming. Besides the stairwell and the upper rooms, there was just one other room downstairs round another corner from the dining hall. Any transport used to escort Doom's tiny team of goons wasn't to be found, either.
"I can earn it. Even if I gotta spend the rest of my days doing it, Tony. This life... this life's been cruel. I need stop mourning it, I ...I do, too." He gestured with his fingers. "I love you, too. Wow," he laughed wetly, and it was then that Ironman realized there were tears staining his cheeks. "We're awful aren't we?"
“I’ll fuck you,” Steve said, keeping to the side of the bed. “I should have offered on the way over.” He was flushed at the thought.
Yet unfortunately, it was never a reasonable idea to just say fuck it, wear earplugs and fake a smile the whole time. Trust him, he's learned that one the hard way.
"Kiss him, to make up for ...earlier."
Tony fired up his repulsors, shooting Doom right in the chest and knocking him onto his back. "Wait, I really was here to help with your crazy-assed time machine?" He barely dodged Doom's slide-kick from the ground, jetting himself into the air. Then he aimed for one of Doom's hands, blasting it. It barely did any damage--Doom was good, Tony would grant him that.
Ironman snorted, and took Steve's hand, walking them inside the quinjet as Vision directed everyone else in their steed. "You're smarter than that, I'd hope."
“It’s my birthday. I’ll do as I please.” He said, hovering above Tony, risking a light kiss on Tony’s very dry lips. “You need to drink.”
So much so that whoever was in charge of monitoring Tony's body had started opening the lid of Tony's life-support pod for him. Steve had greatly preferred doing it himself, however, afraid they'd eventually make some careless mistake and get Tony killed before Steve ever had the chance of talking to him once Tony was finally conscious again.
Sheriff Rogers was always a tough son of a fuck. He rivaled Tony’s wit on the best of days, always managing to impress Tony when Tony decided to fake being shit-faced someday's, convinced maybe that was the day it'd all get better. Not that it ever did, anyway.
"Yeah, I kinda really do." Strangely, because he did.
Steve chastely pressed a kiss to Ironman’s--Tony’s--their nose, and replied, "Only sometimes."
Tony has barely heard a word. He was completely gobsmacked, his cheeks blossoming with heat as he opened his mouth to speak, but he was having difficulty processing. “Wha-what?” He eventually managed.
“I thought you’d be busy fucking one of your pretty girls,” He blurted. Then he winced; Good Job Steve. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean—”
Sure. Tony sat. But, during their brisk walk Tony had morphed into his other personality, Ironman.
There he found his and Steve's quarters by the crack in the door; first on the left amongst the row of other doors. "Rogers," he greeted upon entering, spotting Steve sitting on the massive, purple duvet.
“I’ll be gentle,” Steve swallowed and started stripping down. He wasn’t leaving, not until he knew Tony was going to be alright. His attraction—his feelings—they didn’t matter. It wasn’t like it was the worst thing he’d have to suffer. This was for Tony. “And, and you can sing whatever is you want.”
Tony stepped around Doom's body and booted up the console Steve had used, with also disturbing ease. "You deleted everything?"
“Sorry if this is weird,” Steve said, grimacing, clearly very nervous. “I wanted to ask you something. Flowers, are, a, the traditional route. I mean, I did think about having fondue but I ended up burning the cheese and uh. I thought you’d maybe like cheese over chocolates, because it’s your favorite--”.
"There wasn't much. It was heavily protected by several passwords, which were easy enough." Steve followed behind, and--God. Steve had finished in the blink of an eye.
He became angry, thinking about having kissed Steve just because Ironman kissed Steve. He’d let his emotions get the best of him. Steve cared, but caring only meant so much, in the end.
“Tony,” Pepper startled him out from the darkness, taking hold of his shoulder, “I think you’d like to catch your breath.” She advised.
“Sheriff,” Tony said. He stared at the bottles, idly arranging them so they were flat on the ground in a desperate attempt not to run. He was getting better. He was trying. Maybe he was hiding instead of running this time, but God, he was trying.
"Tony, let me do it," Steve argued immediately, stepping forward. He took Tony's hand very gently into his, bringing it to his lips and softly running his lips over Tony's knuckles. Tony couldn't help but flex his fingers, suddenly helpless in the moment. Steve had absolutely no idea. He had no clue about the difference between them, Tony and Ironman. That didn't stop the fluttering between Tony's ribcage. Nor did it stop how he was preening over Steve choosing to kiss Tony's hand and not Ironman's.
Weak. So, so weak.
"Tony," Steve repeated, this time sounding a bit like a wounded puppy. He didn't really think he could just show up and they'd forgive him, did he?
It wasn’t a cure, and it’d be a mess and hard work. But Steve was alive. They toughed it together before, they could tough it together tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that.
Things had been moving along swimmingly, and thus he wasn't going to delude himself to having anyone believe he sought out Tony like this for any form of comfort. He truly believed Tony was going to wake up. He'd voiced that opinion too many times already-- much more even to himself. Tony was still breathing, flushed and full of his warmth and color. Unlatching the lid allowed Steve to see Tony's skin in proper lighting, no longer tinted yellow by the small glass opening. There were no tubes or wires, as Steve assumed Tony build the pod specifically in case something like this happened.
"Now, now", he chided himself, clucking his tongue against the roof of his mouth. "You shouldn't mind me," He said, speaking to Tony's sleeping form. "I'm unfortunately still lost in my head sometimes. Which isn't fair to you, since I'm here to make sure you're doing okay. You know, as your friend. Always."
"You," Doom addressed to another of his poor lackeys, "Retrieve my equipment!" Which, huh, Tony had bots and Doom had actual people. Not that was anything wrong with people. (Assistants, Tony’s mind supplied.) Doom, though, Doom seemed to enjoy flaunting his status as ruler here. Tony definitely doubted Doom trusted anyone. The curse of genius, maybe?
"Doom has invited you because, unlike most, Doom admires your genius, Anthony Stark. As such, Doom requires such genius to aid in completing Doom's time machine," Doom explained.
"The rest of you--" Steve began, then amended, "You're in," he searched for the right word, "total agreement? I'm not sure how to..."
Steve blinked, a flush peeking through that damned beard. "Whatever ..." Steve tried. "Uh. Y--Yeah, um. Certainly unorthodox since we haven't even held hands. The uniform’s, uh, it's--"
God, Tony was so overwhelmed and beyond delighted.
Tony still had the other dildo inside him, and he spread his legs even further apart to allow Steve to kneel between them. “I appreciate the sentiment. It’s very touching,” Tony said, and then paused, taking Steve in. “My, my, you’ve really forgotten haven’t you?” He reached to brush a hand along Steve’s cheek, causing Steve to shiver and lean down closer towards him. “You darling, brute of a man. It’s been your birthday going on six hours now. You’ve missed the fireworks? They’ve been going all week.”
He was hesitant to move, savoring the afterglow, and kissing Tony's lips one more time, sensual and slow.  "Do wake up soon, Tony. Please. Don't make me go crazy waiting for you."
"Okay, first things first: how does it work? Second, what's specifically wrong with it? Then, finally, I’m hoping you've got the tools needed to mess around with this thing," Tony said, kneeling down to spread a hand along the device. It was smooth and cool to the touch, and when Tony gently pressed down, it sunk slightly into the floor. Weight-activated then. Pity, Tony always loved those cylindrical metal boxes that flashed pretty colors in old sci-fi movies. (That was a thing, right? Tony was positive that was a thing. Otherwise, he'd like to remind everyone it's been a good while.)  "Heh," he snorted at himself.
Tony breaks their stalemate. His lips twist and he turns away to conceal whatever emotion he doesn't want Steve to see. “FRIDAY’s back up in ten.”
“On my way.” Tony punctuates that statement with a swallow from his glass. “FRIDAY already notified Natasha and I’m shut out of the workshop ’til I’m sober.”
“But it’s not you,” Tony sneered, suddenly monstrous. “It’s
Peter handed Tony a wrench and Steve smiled.
Steve leaves the garage before he can make a third mistake.
“Bucky’s doing better.”
“That’s not enough and whoever taught you it was was an asshole.” Tony stands abruptly and his left hand is shaking. “Don’t come back this time, Rogers. Don’t send me a letter or a goddamn flip phone. Just find yourself a nice block of ice and bury yourself at sea.”
Steve chokes.
“You don’t need to worry about me,” Steve says, aiming for casual. “It’s really not that bad, just boring. I’ll take it over the alternative.”
“Don’t take this personally but I don’t know if I can dumb down advanced nanotech and solid state physics that far.”
Stark looking at him without hostility didn’t used to be rare and suddenly Steve needs more. He needs to recapture something of Tony and not of Stark. He runs his lips lightly across the other man’s collarbone and the skin under his mouth shivers.
“No?”
Steve crosses his arms. “It’s also against regulations to talk about classified Avengers missions with non-cleared personnel.”
.” It’s carved from his chest. “I want to understand why you would… You said it made you better.”
“I can’t go back.” He knows he’s severing whatever thin thread of hope is keeping his friendship with Tony on life support.
They didn’t talk about it. Their original sin.
“I’ll drive. You shouldn’t be behind the wheel like this.” He can see Tony bite his tongue around the
“Tony. Stop.” To his surprise Tony does. “I didn’t invite you here for anything to do with talking. I just needed a ride and I thought it was time you knew.”
Bucky mercifully lets it go. They knew men in the war who were dragged by certain sounds and smells back into the hells of their own minds. He knows to some extent or another, that those men weren’t the exception but soldiers got called weak for carrying the war home. There’s a new label for it now; sterile and proper. Sam would know.
Steve waits for the woman with all the answers to finish but she never does.
“Shit,” Bucky swore, once he recognized Steve. He was drunk and a mess. “How’s Tony?”
The video only last five minutes, but it feels longer. It plays on a loop, with them cursing every second of it. But they have to study it, in case it clues them to where Tony’s being hold up.
Bucky yells mentally in anger and desperation.
happen, Bucky’s not sure how he will survive. He probably won’t, right? He doesn’t think he’s that strong to survive this heartbreak. He can deal with HYDRA and all their torture, but not the loss of a soulmate. That feels too impossible. Even now, just looking at Tony suffering is killing Bucky, too.
Everything hurts.
Yes, he’s one, but there are times when he feels like he can’t do it anymore. Then he thinks back of the hell he went through and at the same time the hell he have brought, of all the amending he has to make for his mistakes. The latter alone keeps him moving forward, just like Natasha and Barnes, because he’s alive for a reason. And he won’t waste this second chance he got to turn his bloody legacy into something close to a shining beacon of hope for the future.
‘Who is this we?’ He’s trying not to look intimidated by the sight of the knife. ‘HYDRA?’
Bucky wanted to say yes… to both. He doesn’t give a fuck what happens to him or to that blasted sceptre. All he wants is for Tony to be safe, to come home. But of course, that decision isn’t up to him, and he knows that if they all follow his thinking it’d be a disaster, because honestly, he’s not even logical.
It’s almost a miracle Steve doesn’t ask him about his rather passionate feelings towards Tony Stark. But maybe Steve doesn’t notice it as well, too lost in his own worry for the genius.
He scans his memory for clues again because his heart rate is starting to quicken, and the arc reactor in his chest suddenly feels too heavy, that it’s making it difficult for his lungs to distribute the correct amount of oxygen in his body. And he’s not looking forward to the worst case scenario when he’s still in a middle of another worst case scenario.
Chapter title is from Maroon 5's
did he end up here?
And Tony just needs to say Steve’s name back and Captain America will know that he’s mated to no other than one problematic Tony Stark. Damn, all his baggages that Steve has to carry around if the genius let
Tony did glare at her. ‘You and Pepper becoming friends is one of the worst things that happened in my life,’ he whines but closes his holograms with a wave of his hand. He’s not stupid enough to try and disobey Natasha. He still wants to continue breathing, thank you very much.
Being pessimistic probably doesn’t help anyone. And really, he’s only hurting himself by thinking of the worst. Yes, the worst could happen. But not now, not when he’s got Steve to tell him that it won’t. He’ll believe Steve, he always will. Steve could believe for the both of them.
Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes are national heroes. They are legendary icon and honourable soldiers. They are beckon of hope. Light in times of darkness.
‘There appears to be an overlapping framework, sir,’ JARVIS replies as Tony’s screen fills with the arm’s 3D structure.
As always, thank you for my beta,
Can’t always get what you want.. This is it for Tony. He should start to accept that. He should. Even if it’s hard.
He wants to be happy with Barnes since they’ve somehow became kindred-spirits with how they both undergone body changes they never wanted. And he knows that the PTSD isn’t a walk in the park either.
What will Natasha tell him if she knows that he’s Captain America’s soulmate? Maybe request him not to get between Steve and Barnes. That’s what people would say because that’s the right thing.
Tony doesn’t ask how she knows. He only wraps himself into her tighter and wishes that she didn’t have to suffer under the Red Room. But he can’t change their pasts. He can only wish for a better path for here on out.
Tony shakes his head to control his rogue thoughts. He’s not going down that rabbit hole. It’s not going to help him get out.
Same goes for Barnes. And just like for Natasha, Tony can pave a great present and future for Bucky. Isn’t that what he’s been trying to do after Afghanistan to redeem himself from all the wrongs of his past?
for him.
‘And he also turns into a sublime green being that can get you and Cap a run for your money on being The Strongest Avenger.’ He tries very hard to ignore the sudden changes in Barnes, knowing it won’t do good if he hovers over him now like a mother hen. That’s Steve’s job. Not that he’s not concerned with Barnes’ well-being, too. It’s only that he understands that sometimes your nightmares haunt you with no warning or whatsoever.
And Bucky mutely asks for some miracle, staring at Tony’s motionless body on the screen. It doesn’t fit Tony to be this still when he’s always full of energy and life.
The video holds the usual disgusting torture of the engineer. But this time Tony looks like he’s at his breaking point. The pool of blood on the floor is also concerning. There’s a haunting paleness in Tony’s face that makes Bucky’s chest twist painfully.
‘Have you still not changed your mind, Mr. Stark?’ The evil minion occupies his stool once again.
Steve looks just as weary as Bucky is. They all do, but he thinks him and Steve has it worse. His other soulmate is being maimed, and somehow he thinks Steve can feel the negative and dark energy within him. It might has something to do with how they are soul bond.
That’s it. One word. And everything in Tony’s life is in chaos.
at least.’ He studies Tony’s face, and his eyes gleam of something sadistic. He smiles again and it makes the genius shiver because he doesn’t like this man’s wicked eyes that promises pain. ‘Things apparently didn’t go as planned.’
Shit! His head is pounding so bad it makes him nauseous just opening his eyes and looking around for clues as to where the fuck he is.
There’s this bald Russian guy that tortures Tony to beg the Avengers to rescue him in exchange for the sceptre and Bucky. The methods are simple: a few punches and a few stabbing. Nothing worse than Bucky had gone under HYDRA’s hands. But then, Bucky’s a super soldier, who heals easily; Tony on the other hand is a non-powered human, looking all bruised and battered with his injuries from the explosion and now the current tormenting.
The pain or jealousy didn’t arrive. Yes, there is pain, but it’s the same one he’s been nursing since Tony had gone missing and was tortured.
Barnes isn’t even looking at the man he’s being introduced to. No, his blue grey eyes are wide with shock as they dig into Tony’s face. His whole body is rigid with tension that wasn’t there like six seconds ago.
Every quiet groan and tormented scream rams into Bucky’s soul like ton of brick. Mutely, he promises terrible pain to those who’ve caused Tony’s painful screeches. Morality be damned. There is blood and suffering to be paid in full.
But it’s Steve. Tony loves Steve, and he knows his mother would want him to heal and forgive. And there’s also that grieving look in Bucky’s eyes that Tony finds familiar.
I suck at chapter summary, so I'll just gotta tell you in advance that I have introduced a new character from a different universe. The competition really. So, are y'all ready for Player 3? Well, you don't have much of a choice actually. LOL! But I'm crossing my fingers that you'll like them. And off you go and hope you enjoy!
Back on his first reason. Has these idiots forgotten that Steve is bonded to James, and would probably sacrifice anyone — much less Tony Stark — to keep his soulmate safe? Seriously, bad guys should study the laws of soul bonding too because they are just clueless as to how far people would go for those they love.
Steve whips his head back to the screen in a flash that Bucky’s amaze he didn’t break his neck in the process. Steve’s sudden alertness to Tony’s call is an embodiment of a siren calling to a sailor; like a sunflower following the sun in the sky.
His own hand digs into Steve’s shoulder as they both try to support each other.
It really has to be Loki’s fault.
Tony’s not sure why he’s trying to convince his tormentor that he’s team cares so little for him. He blames it on the lack of common sense and sanity when all he can register is the pain. The last time it hurt like this it’s because he was betrayed. And he was betrayed because he deserved it — he deserves to be alone since he’s never going to be good enough.
They leave the workshop together and got on the lift.
Of course, my beta for this chapter had been nothing short but amazing. Thank you so much
‘Hmmm...’ Bruce continues to stare at the arm. ‘Maybe Dr. Cho can help you improve the motor neuron function commands from his primary motor cortex.’
‘That is so rude of me,’ he jokes. ‘Brucie-bear meet the Winter Soldier a.k.a., Captain America’s best friend and soulmate, a.k.a. Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes.’ He gestures to the super soldier sitting on the metal table. ‘Barnes,’ he begins as he turns to the said man who appears to be quite tense now, ‘meet the incredible, brilliant , Dr. Bruce Banner. He has like seven Ph.Ds. it's frankly amazing.’
‘Hey, Bruciebear,’ Tony flashes his friend a smile and closes the metal panels in Barnes’ arm. ‘Dinner time?’
He’s about to ask his AI to turn the heat up; only that, he opens his eyes to an unfamiliar surrounding. The words die in his tongue.
‘They’re probably dead.’ She’s not meeting Tony’s eyes as she looks ahead on the TV. There’s enough nonchalance in her voice that sounded fake.
His burns, the old wounds, and the new one eats away his logic. Maybe it’s true that the team won’t come for him, especially not Steve who won’t even risk James’ safety. And he agrees with that.
his own subconscious repeats over and over again. He hates it because his own subconscious sounds like his father’s voice.
Tony expects the pain, the ones that always comes when they see him as he sees himself: a monster. Hate will follow fear in the process. And he’s not ready to see those emotions on Barnes’ eyes pointed at him. He couldn't stand to disappoint another one of his heroes.
‘No,’ Steve says in defeat and heartbreak. ‘Tony.’ His voice is wet and bleak and aching.
He can’t. Not even when everything about this reminds him of Afghanistan. The cold, the rusty smell of decaying metal, the foul scent of an unkempt room. Somewhere he can hear a faint water droplet that makes his stomach churn at the thought of dirty water and lack of oxygen.
Bruce nods. ‘Tasha’s finishing with the cooking so she asked me to come and get you,’ he explains, studying Barnes’ arm thoughtfully. ‘And this thing is connected to his brain?’
‘On it, Captain,’ JARVIS replies severely.
Steve scowls at him without heat. ‘That was one time,’ he insists. ‘And it was Clint’s fault.’
‘Yes.’ He stands up from his chair and pops his back into place. ‘I’ve had JARVIS scan it. It’s quite revolutionary. But at the same time it needs great improvements because it’s sloppy work, very inefficient.’
And before he can roll his eyes on Steve, Barnes grins widely at him like the brainwashed assassin can’t believe how lucky he's got to be to have discovered Tony’s brand of humour. It’s very special and rare, and it offends lots of people most of the time.
It takes two more days for the next video to arrive. It contains the same stomach churning gore of Tony’s torture. They can all see how the genius slowly withering, despite how he still has his sass intact.
He might have used kid’s glove on dealing with Barnes. Really, he should know better than tip-toeing around the man like he’s a walking time bomb. Didn’t he hate it when his friends did that with him before?
Bucky knows by experience what it feels like to have Tony say your name for the first time and be envelop by a phantom sense of safety and happiness. It’s like finding meaning to life all over again, and being lulled in euphoria. But he can’t imagine what it’s like for Steve when there’s also that dreadful emotion of fear for the life of a soulmate which had sat painfully on Bucky’s chest for days now. A few days that felt like years.
The man looks like an ex-convict no matter which direction you approach him from, Tony finds it a shame, he grew up watching the old reels of the Howling Commandos. He had always looked up to both Barnes and Cap. Mostly to the former because Steve’s shoes are impossible to fill. Even at the young age of five, Tony knows that truth.
He wants to say he’s getting punished for all the lives that drip so red from his ledger, he’s sure it’s worse than Natasha or anyone else in their team. Definitely worse. More reason to keep his mouth shut and let Steve live the wonderful life that he should.
Cold is the first thing that registers into his mind as he slowly gains consciousness. The pain follows like an inevitable addition to the discomfort. Why is JARVIS not doing anything about the temperature? He should be at least warm even when he’s in pain.
‘It’s past midnight, Antoshka.’ She raises an eyebrow at him like a mother silently reprimanding her child. ‘You have an early board meeting tomorrow.’
Tony only cuddles further into her warm embrace. ‘But then you’ll be stuck with me.’ He throws his head back a bit to look up to her. ‘What about your soulmate?’
It’s cold. It’s always cold, Tony notices. And he’s not sure where he is. He’s sure the bastards that have kidnapped him had stripped him of all his tracking device. Maybe it’s time to install one deep within his flesh like JARVIS had suggested.
Steve feels like a glacier, doomed in stages, while Tony could reignite in an instant. “I would.”
“I thought you said you’d stop me,” Tony complained bitterly.
“Look at you and your big therapy words.”
He never did and he never would, Steve knew that now. Tony belonged to a ghost.
“Wait, Agent Coulson? You’re kidding.”
“What would being unstuck look like?”
For an experience Steve has no intention of repeating it occupies more than its fair share of his thoughts. Part of that is the isolation. Despite his relative freedom in the Compound he’s still under house arrest and the agents who mill about remember that. They don’t associate with him: half on principle and half fearful of picking up the taint.
“No one. I’ve got this. Just…” he squeezed his eyes shut, “give me a couple days. It’s just a heat. I’ve had them since I was thirteen, I can handle it.”
On the anniversary of the UN bombing Avengers Compound goes on high alert. There’s a dull uproar around the world the following week; the merits of the Avengers and the Accords get dragged out and pawed over, interspersed with survivor interviews and ideologues on personal crusades. Steve watches rehashes of his own arguments in other people’s mouths and it doesn’t fill him with fire like it used to. It’s been a year: the arguments haven’t changed, the UN hasn’t budged. It’s not Steve’s war anymore. He’s a retired figurehead, nothing more.
The wooden confessional reminded Steve of a coffin as he climbed into the dark. “Forgive me, Father. It has been… a long time.”
“You’re better than that.”
“That’s what everyone called him. I don’t think he’d answered to anything else in a long time.”
She says nothing and plays with the hospital band around her wrist for a long time. “If I knew that…”
They spend the rest of the night sitting on the floor of the session room eating saltines by the sleeve. Bucky’s been doing better, staying present, but not nearly to his previous high mark. He hasn’t put the prosthetic arm back on either. At some point he pulls on the BARF glasses. Steve expected something more sinister with wires and sparking electricity and maybe mad cackling in the distance. Instead the glasses just sit oddly on Bucky’s face, too square and modern. Then again the frames weren’t designed for him. They were designed by Tony, for Tony.
“It does to me.” Tony’s eyes narrow. “Your sudden devotion to not sleeping with the enemy is inconvenient.”
"You have the worst ideas." Tony attacks Steve's mouth before he can retort. It's a dirty trick but Steve swiftly doesn’t care once Tony’s hands start wandering downward.
“Tokyo is beautiful in the summer.”
Natasha rolls her eyes and Steve winces. “Stop being dramatic. Steve lied to protect you. We both did. He’s always pulled his punches with you. Barnes is the one missing an arm - ”
he asks aloud.
“That makes it better? You not being as irresponsible as you could be? You’re an Avenger. You don’t get to opt out and break all your promises because you can’t handle the world sober. You need to be better than that.”

“Well, I do.” Steve’s taken aback by the vehemence in Tony’s voice. “Just how do you expect me to explain any of this? Christ.”
“We’re in Hell,” Steve corrected and Tony knew now that he meant it metaphorically and had from the very beginning. Steve gestured towards the hole in the ice and his voice broke. “You even gave me a home.”
Rhodes looks at him with concern and his tone softens. “They’ll be fine, Steve. Pepper knows who Tony is. We’re just giving them a night to themselves to have it all out, yeah?”
“And tell them what?”
Meals are delivered like clockwork and once upon a time the boredom would have had Steve climbing the walls. Now he checks the door periodically and sleeps in a daze the rest.
“You can’t,” Steve replied. “It’s not as bad as it looks, the pain’s manageable just... persistent.” And the sweet reprieve of sleep didn’t exist here. No blissful dreams where the pain faded from conscious thought.
The exhaustion they felt was purely psychological when they stopped to rest in a section of what Tony supposed had once been a mausoleum and was now more ruins. Slabs of marble and limestone had been pried off tombs and strewn about. Some were inscribed with a script Tony couldn’t decipher, others were burnt and covered in ash as if lightning or fire had erased them.
There’s a split second pause.
For all Tony’s forwardness he seems to be backtracking now. “I’m not saying
If you had asked Steve six years ago he’d have said Tony was like Thor - distant and godlike and occupying an entirely different sphere of life. Steve had been responsible for the others: Sam, Clint, Wanda… even Natasha eventually. They were his team. Tony was part of that team but he was never Steve’s. Tony was his own. Tony should have been fine.
“I won’t,” Tony had whispered, raising a bloody hand to trace Steve’s cheek. “I can’t. I love you.”
went unsaid.
Grinning. Like a madman, or at the very least like a man content to be exactly where he is; stuck between his best friend’s drunk ranting and the sleeping form of the woman he loves. Tony was never Steve’s. Tony was his own, and Pepper’s, and Rhodey’s, and -
“I absolutely did,” Tony said, voice colourless. “I assumed so many things I shouldn’t have. I thought I was invincible. I went looking for the Captain. I just assumed he’d help me because he looked like you.”
Natasha tentatively reaches out. It’s a rare gesture these days, pale hand curving over his shoulder. Tony shrugs off her hand like it offends him and it burns Steve to see something genuine rejected with so much contempt.
“Where did you get this?”
“Exactly where are you going?”
“Nothing heavy. Things. Baseball teams. Jello.” Bucky seems to figure out what Steve’s really asking. “Not
He moves with too much purpose towards the edge of the roof and in a flash Steve is on his feet and at his side, one hand wrapped deep in the back of Tony’s jacket, digging into the T-shirt below. Steve knows he’s stronger, faster, heavier than Tony. He knows he won’t let go.
Tony’s right hand dropped, his left was all that remained. “I don’t understand!” he screamed. “What did I do?!“
The North Wing of the Compound is strictly off limits to non-appointed staff but one of the medical technicians buzzes Steve through the door with a smile. It’s nothing more than natural friendliness but that’s rare enough these days that Steve conjures up a smile back. The rictus feels fake and plastic stretched across his face. He thinks that it didn’t used to.
Strange pinched his nose like he knew this had been a bad idea from the start. “I’m here to make you an offer. One, I should stress, that you can
The undersuit stuck to Tony’s wet skin as he wrestled it on. The material was a thin black blend shot through with electric blue but it felt as good as armour - bare feet be damned.
Avengers missions were routine but now they took on the flavour of monotony. Recon, raid, repeat. AIM, Roxxon, Hydra: they all bled red, and when Steve stripped his gloves off afterward the smears left behind never bothered him like they used to. He’d press a bloody thumb to the calendar on his desk, still turned to April despite it being late July. Time had run away from him but a row of red thumbprints marked the cycles.
“… tell Natasha to try that next. I already told…”
It’s a portrait of a moment that doesn’t deserve to be memorialized: Tony in a badly lit Siberian bunker in the instant after he learned everything, the instant before everything went to hell. (Steve remembers raising his shield, falling a half-step back, anchoring his boots.) It’s only now once Tony’s staring back at him from the paper that Steve can tell what he’s thinking.
Tony couldn’t come up with a plausible lie fast enough. “No. I have no idea what the fuck I was thinking when I brought us here. I don’t recognize anything and you'd think I would have remembered the haunted forest with an obsession with stealing my stuff.”
Natasha’s silent for a moment, still calm and collected. Outside there’s a thin layer of frost still on the ground. You could be fooled into calling it snow.
“He left a note: his own execution warrant written in Polish for his hand in the deaths of thousands and for the sickness in the minds of men. The police chief was an old family friend, they called it an accident to save us a suicide.” Kovalchyk finishes his tea with shaking hands. “My father was killed by his own hand and I’ve dedicated the entirety of my medical career to understanding why he thought it was the fair thing to do.”
Tony is unrepentant. “Wanna fight about it?”
There’s no way of knowing how long the blooms will draw his death out. Some Hanahaki cases go quickly, for others it takes years - for a select few, decades - but they all die in the end. There are no recorded survivors; only anecdotal evidence of miraculous recoveries. It’s difficult to scientifically test if true love’s first kiss really undoes the spell. For those outside the fairytale it’s left to suffer unto death for the whims of the heart.
The files she’s opened censor themselves. There are still pictures though. The man is Tony’s age: dark blond, smaller than Steve but most men are these days. In the most prominent photo he’s wearing a wedding ring and standing next to his blonde wife and two blond children. The president of some media conglomerate based out of the Midwest.
“ Steve’s jaw clicked. Tony didn’t even notice. “It was hardly a heroic tale of romance and perseverance. I just liked that you thought it was. You thought I got married and revolutionized the world. I didn’t want to admit to you how badly I failed.”
——————————————
Of course he does. It’s not the same for Bucky, who volunteered once and paid for it dearly. Steve’s bones ache from the effort it takes to keep himself here, feet planted where Bucky needs him. It’s that devotion that prevents him from stealing Quinjets and diving headlong into typhoons. He can stop himself from running off but he can’t stop himself from wanting to. He is war down to his bones in a way the Starks never were even when they were better at it.
Steve pleads.
“You can’t do this,” Steve said because he had to. Avengers didn’t avenge, not in the way that sent assassins after peasants.
Steve unwinds tape and watches Stark swallow two painkillers dry. For once Tony sits perfectly still. Steve is unerringly careful; fingers cautious and gentle, but the damage is already done. He never hurts Stark intentionally but he is never as careful as he could have been and that's their entire history isn’t it?
“I wonder who lived here.”
“It was dead.” Steve shrugged. “Or it might as well have been. I don’t know, it’s hard to tell in this place.”
“Well, are you going to try and kill him again?” Steve regrets it the instant it leaves his mouth.
The helmet assembles, obscuring Stark’s face and in some ways that makes it easier.
“You have any ideas on how to get out of here yet?” Steve asked like a broken record.
Steve resents the implication and the poison that lives under his skin spills out. “Why shouldn’t I? You willed all of this into existence; this team, the Accords, everything, right down to me being trapped here with you. You got the future you wanted,” he falters, “and I
It goes unheard.
Her posture subtly changes, it’s her training taking over but her voice betrays her. It’s low and scratchy, angry. “I can have you grounded whenever I want Stark, you’ve given me enough reasons, but you are not leaving me to do this alone. If you aren’t going to show up to fix this mess then why should I? You’re not the only one with better offers.”
realizing that he knows very, very little about what's going on in the lives of the people around him. He is surprised by Bucky and Tony, Sam and Rhodey, and Tony's extremis update all in one chapter.
Steve had thought it was over.
isn’t news. It’s nothing I haven’t done before.”
Steve’s stomach lurches. He’s felt this way before; torn between wanting to know more and needing to know less. There’s only one reason Tony would choose a man as unremarkable as Robert Kovalchyk to review the Winter Soldier’s files. Stark’s after a second opinion in more ways than one.
Steve stares at the dark head turned away from him. “Aren’t we allowed to be?”
“Want to bet?” Steve challenges because sometimes anticipating Tony is easy.
He forgets sometimes that he’s still alive, still married.
Tony sounds sincere enough but there’s an underlying thread that Steve only hears when Tony’s yelling about Bruce. Like he’s desperate for him to come back but showing it might kill him.
My outline of Tony’s version of the same year includes: punching Hank Pym, a trip to see Zemo, joining AA, getting stalked by Clint, sleeping with Tiberius Stone in a bid to see if all blonds who hate his guts are the same, ignoring most of Kovalchyk’s advice, getting kidnapped by Stephen Strange, setting up secret meetings underneath the UN, running into Fury in a graveyard, blasting Coulson out a window, hitting on a priest, and turning the entire city of Philadelphia against him.
since that’s the terminology you prefer.”
Steve catalogues all the differences between the Tony of his memories and the one standing in front of him. The laugh lines around still wary eyes, the pressure point at his temples that relaxes the tension through his jaw. He has a handful of grey hairs that look silver surrounded by a sea of dark brown. He studies every aspect closely; the sharp lines, the textures, the colours. He needs the memory of
