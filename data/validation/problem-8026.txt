And they were back to their regular programming.
She didn’t sit next to Steve. She didn’t sit next to the team. The floor seemed more comforting as she leaned her back to the wall beside the shelves she and Steve helped build. The entire compound had felt empty and impersonal. They had taken upon themselves to liven up the area, to give it a more avengers team feeling. Throughout the years they had spent together, their phones and Tony’s bots had captured enough moments for them to fill countless albums. Steve printed the photos. She bought the frames. They placed every single image meticulously and Tony wasn’t ready to admit it but that wall meant more to him than anything else in that entire compound.
“I’m sorry to interrupt but a ship from outer space has just entered the atmosphere.” Friday announced to the room. Everyone grabbed whatever they had of their weapons and rushed outside. Thor gripped his Strombreaker as he stood in front of his team.
“He’ll be fine, he’s a big boy,” Natasha continued with a full mouth, “that’s what his shield is for."
Could Tony be--
“The entire opposition will not be in the same building as the president how could they—"
Steve’s feet picked up towards the stairs and that’s when the computer blinked it’s last second and the entire building began to crash.
So far nothing.
"R&D has very special place in my heart. Managing people and deals can get exhausting. You'll find out."
“The Accords were not the reason, Captain.”
“TONY!” Steve’s voice pulled Tony back from the drowning voices. He pulled back gasping, finally realizing he had been holding his breath.
They were supposed to be together. They were supposed to be always preparing themselves for the worst. Tony wasn’t supposed to fly off by himself to something he wasn’t prepared for. Tony and her were supposed to be together, going to their dinner that he promised he would crack open a cook book for.
It gave him the title of Captain America. It helped his best friend re-gain an arm he lost in battle. And it introduced him to the man who constantly needed to invent, Tony Stark. SHIELD held a very strong importance to Steve.
"BULLSHIT. You made the decision for me! You decided on your own that it wasn’t worth me knowing, that I didn’t need to know, that I shouldn’t know. You don’t tell anyone anything unless they just happen to with you. You told Nat about Bucky, because she was with you. You told Sam because he was with you. You decided for me. You didn’t give me a chance. You didn’t give me the facts. You didn’t give Tony the facts.” She was pointing her finger at him, using the hand that clutched their photograph. The team was always giving her strength and helping her find her power—her reason to still be a part of them. Her anger stemmed from them, from the time they were happy.
What did you think? Things are starting to pick up. A lot of the characters names are coming from the MCU Hydra members or main villains. Please let me know your thoughts and opinions and if the chapter was worth the wait!

As the TV kept flashing every happy, teary cry of joy from the supporters, it also remembered to present the world with every heartbroken supporter for the opposing party. People had tears in their eyes, rooms that were once filled to the maximum with people lay empty and some sat on the floor looking like everything they believed in was taken from them.
Obadiah had his sleeves folded, tie somewhere with where his coat had ended up. If he had hair, that would have probably sticking up in different directions considering the times he had run his hand on his head. Blueprints and files covered his desk and a coffee cup sat dangerously at the corner of the table.
"Uh...well..." a cough, "I thought it would be best for someone else to bear the responsibility. It's the people's company, if they seem worthy enough, they should be able to have a chance."
"I am very busy and I am sure you are too, there is no  point in wasting time. What do you want?"
“I’ll make sure the detail is at its strongest,” Sam smiled back him.
“I was in a rush! All I knew was that I needed to jump, okay. There was a blast! You should be taking care of me."
The building was silent for once. All the volunteers were home, the phone didn’t make a sound, no one was running around. It was just them with numerous posters that asked to vote for Rogers. The morning sun shone through the windows, illuminating as far as it’s light could go.
“Sam told me that Steve took most of the damage?"
People being frozen.
“We need a laptop and you need to take a sit.” Natasha wasn’t strict, her voice was wavering. She wasn’t ready for this. Steve took his spot on the seat, motioning to the computer in front of him.
Steve didn’t realize how long he had been staring at them until Natasha shook him. There was a buzz in his ears that kept all the noise out of his head. The room looked like it was spinning.
Abruptly, Steve’s fingers closed the video and he stared at the screen as the numbers glared at him. He hasn’t heard his voice in ten years. Steve’s been craving to hear that voice, to mock him, to blame him for not coming back and trying hard enough. He needed to hear that voice and it was finally in front of him and Steve was too afraid to go further.
"That's what I'm here to figure out." Obadiah stared at Joseph for a couple of seconds and finally took his place on the seat and Joseph followed. There was a menacing silence between them and Stan tried to fiddle with his pen to try to create some noise.
“I know that machine. James Rhodes has it.”
“Why were you at Stark Industries during the blast?” His mom’s hand stopped mid to mouth as she stared at her son. Of course everyone knows about the blast. Of course his dad knew he was there.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Looks like you will have to follow me everyday now,” Joseph said to Sam.
“Sam are you sure Stane is not in his office?” Natasha spoke up. Her steps were light and planned.
“What was in that glass chamber?”
downfall if I say so, Skull."
“Maybe, he was taken alive, forced to tell the information behind his invention.” The face flashed in front of Steve’s eyes. Even if the eye looked lifeless and even if it was just the side of the face, he would know that face anywhere. He’s seen that face countless times, he’s worked with that face countless times. Steve knew what was really bothering him about the entire attack and it wasn’t the fact that the suit looked like Rhodey’s. It was because that face reminded him of Tony.
Steve’s feet lightly treaded across the dark hallway. His breath panted, still trying to keep up from the fight and his hands flailed around him. Tony was here somewhere, he was bound to be.
“Tell me you know more exits than the one we came through,” Sam ran after Steve as he made his way towards the door.
“It’s about Tony.” Steve finally spoke up and Sarah reached over to his hand.
“We need you to find out Steve.” Steve took in a deep breath and nodded.
“Everyone is slowly leaving, the offices look empty. So far you’re good.” Natasha walked behind Steve as he led the way. They both dressed casually, nothing to arise suspicion and nodding at the employees leaving for the day. It was casual and discredit. All the needed to do was go into Stane’s office, plug in a USB and they’d be done.
“Where
“Moles.” Nick pointed to the file in front of him. “And these are the suspects. With the exception of the people in this room, no one can be completely trusted. That is why Sam and James will the main heads of your security detail."
The file opened to more numbered files. Clicking the first one, the girls saw various designs of suits that resembled the designs to that of Rhodey’s suit. Every picture had a giant FAILED marked on them. Expect one design. Opening another file presented them with videos. Each other progressively got longer with the last with the shortest amount of time. Natasha took in a deep breath and brought that video to play.
building,
“You shield doesn’t always blend it.”
NAVIGATION.
“FRIDAY hasn’t been able to track the exact coordinates, nor does she knew exactly when the message was sent. But we do know his suit is…or was depleting.”
Sweat trickled down his forehead as his breath tried to catch up. His heart was beating so fast, almost threatening to jump out of his chest. The room was silent. The glass chamber was towering and cold.  Demanding him to do something, to not just stare. Steve’s eyes scanned the area and there was Tony. His back pinned against Skull with a gun to his head.
“What was I even think?” Joseph whispered to himself as he filed through the blackened papers. It was too good to be true. This one was messier than the others, more hurried and ill-planned—half letters were seen through the thick black lines, and scribbles covered the pages. As the other files proved to him, there was nothing useful in this file either, no matter how tempting it looked.
“I lost hope a long time ago, Captain.” She could see Steve’s face flinch away. Captain was impersonal for them. They were no longer the same people two years ago—she didn’t want to be the same person to him.
Steve told himself the first he came back there.
"I am not his babysitter. He's a grown man he's going to be things that he does not share with everyone. What makes you think that he would even ever tell
The big reveal! Please let me know what you think and your opinions. I would love to hear from you!
There was a grunt. It was light but Steve can swear he heard it.
And in shape of a man.
“Only Nat and Bucky but we’re going to stay back this time. Last time when we all left, even at different times, Fury knew something was up. We need to be more careful.” The boys nodded in unison as they stared at the folder. Every mission had always been either a dead end or missing information. They really needed this. For hope.
"You pieces of shits!" The door flew open and Stane marched inside. His jaw was tight and his eyes wide open. His hand was still clutching the life of the photograph. Pierce cursed under his breath. He finally had found peace seconds ago.
"Mr. President-
suggest?"
“This is not why I came to dinner for. You want to talk about my mission, fine. You want to laugh at my hope to find Tony, fine. But don’t try to stop me.” His dad was about to retort back but Sarah finally raised her voice.
"You promised me that I would never be found out if I gave you Tony's design. The reason you are even using that metal suit is because of me. And this is how you repay me, you little shit." Stane threw the photo at Skull. Catching it with both hands, Skull studied the photo. There was a reason why Joseph took a close up of the words, there was no way knowing which file these words were in especially things had been blackened.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is it?” Rhodey spoke up. Ever since she had got up and started ruffling through the paper work on the table the entire team had their eyes on her. She was quiet and in her own world and focused on finding the recent remnants of Tony that she forgot anyone else was there.
A loud bleep silenced their house hunting and they both placed their food down, completely forgetting about hunger.
“Something is wrong. I can hear your head filing through something. What’s wrong?"
“I’m sorry, Rocket.”
Steve exited out of the video and stared at the keyboard to regain control of his breath. He felt like rocks had started to settle down in his throat slowly blocking all chances for him to properly breath. The room suddenly felt incredibly small and a heat started to engulf Steve. His fisted hand flung across and threw a lap off its stand along with his mug making broken glass cover the floor.
“Definitely, it was funny because it Strucker doesn’t seem to have done anything that can be even a little bit stressful.” There it was, his mothers usual attitude towards the current president.
“Son, you made it.” Sarah smiled at Steve.
"I need to clear the air. I have been doing research into our own government better. Trying to know the inside information of what makes this government what it is."
“I’m not here to ask for forgiveness. I’m here to help, we all are."
“Does SHIELD know?"
“Stane can’t be."
“We had not prepped him well enough, we threw him in the machine the second we took the wires off of him."
“Steve. You okay?” Sam’s voice entered his head and Steve realized that he had stopped walking as his eyes scanned the room. Sam was already in front of him with his eyes bunched together in worry.
“The conversation can continue later. Right now, I want to have a good dinner with my two favourite men so do not try to ruin this. Both of you."
"What?" Strucker stared at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Joseph already suspects everyone in this room. He proved that with Stane." Skull was considering the idea. It's not like they haven't bugged someone's house before. The only problem was this time, all of this had to be done by the four present in the room, personally. There was no way Skull was letting any HYDRA agent handle this sensitive information.
“Yeah.” It was a silent agreement. Steve knows how uncomfortable James gets with himself and even though he’s never spoke about it James still blames him. Blames him for not being able to be quick enough to bring his best friend back. Blames him for not being able to find anything of his best friend. They can talk about anything, just not Tony.
"The Captain's team can bring him back." Maria spoke up.
“Are we finally talking about the important stuff?"
Moving his feet to the foot with the blanket sliding off of him, his phone vibrated silently on the table.
"What are you trying to get at?"
A figure appeared in the door way and let itself in.
“But the VP—"
“The man I met when I entered Earth, the Doctor, he had a Time Stone, if we managed to take that back—“
"Don’t try to sell me that, you knew about Bucky way before Vienna happened, you just didn’t want to tell me. You just assumed that because Tony and I have a longer relationship that I wouldn’t listen to you."
“No…that’s not true. You don’t know Quill. He loves playing jokes.”
Steve’s voice spoke with speed and urgency. His panting echoed in the ear piece. There were two many people for his liking, especially for a mission like this. As if they were waiting for him. Plus it was too small a room to be fighting in; the entire situation was not going well. He switched his shield to his other arm to slam it in the henchman.
“Yeah. But I don’t know why they wanted us to see that. It’s just a lot of failed experiments, what good does it do for us? They’ve never given up information so willingly."
“How are they Hydra?"
“Thanks.” Steve took a sip and nodded at his parents. “I am very proud. Politics never have been my strong suit but they already seem to have taken a 360. This is a good moment.”
What did you think! I definitely want to try to add some more Bucky and Sam in this. Even more Natasha and hopefully the other Avengers.
Tony’s face stared at Steve as the recording stopped. His eyes burning red, his veins popping, his hair sticking up. Steve’s never seen that much anger in Tony’s eyes, he’s always been calm, nothing made him react like that. This was never supposed to be. This was never supposed to be Tony.
Another recording cut short.
That’s when he realized.
The room was numb, the light from the curtains had escaped and Steve sat on the sofa with just the screen light burning in his eyes.
Thank you for reading!
Steve blinked at his screen, trying to take in all the information. His mind was building up a scream and his eyes were starting to hurt and his ears were burning up. There were so many voices, so many orders, so much development, so much control. His friend looked so alone.
The crunch of the photograph helped her blink back to the current conversation. The silence was gone. Thor was trying to figure out how to find Thanos again—who he could see, talk to, ask about the whereabouts. Bruce was already calculating in his head on how to bring out the hulk but also how to test the Stones and how to use them to work in their favour. They were working together to collectively construct a plan so they could surprise Thanos.
At the time Tony was being brutally tortured, Steve was out conducting missions, having family dinners, going through break ups and almost getting fired from SHIELD. He was not following leads, he was not trying to find Tony, instead Steve was continuing his everyday routines.
“You just want to look cool, man. Don’t even lie.” Sam piped it, sliding a cup towards Steve. “You look like you need three cups of coffee."
“So either the locals are still spooked about the building or they left before you.” Steve spoke.
his mind whispered to him. “Sir, should I shut it down from our end?"
“Good. How do the movements look?
"How did you get it?"
“Steve! Get over here,” Steve shot his head towards the voice, ignoring every other word the reporter had to say. Sam stood beside his father with an arm wrapped around him.
And suddenly he was all alone. Steve didn’t know if he liked this better than when there was someone in the room. He could feel his heart beating, he could hear the rhythmic beating consume the entire room. His hands were cold and rubbing them together he finally opened the first video.
“Cleaned up nice in here."
“Maybe he doesn’t want to come back?"
"How come research and development? Were you not managing the entire company?" Obadiah's mind was spinning, it was questioning and demanding answers.
There have been rumours about it might be. HYDRA is always conducting experiments in the dark corners, away from any suspecting eye, preparing their moves. It was what HYDRA so dangerous; whenever it seemed their secrets are out they come up with something new.
“Alright, he’s not done. Just missing. Where do you think he is?"
“You have your head so far up your ass!”
"I don't think I would be wrong in assuming that Steve is probably the closest to what he has to family. But that's a different argument. And you may be right in that you know what he wanted to do with this company but either way, I hope you are careful in who you deal with when it comes to weapons. Dealing weapons with the wrong people does not help in making friends."
“I don’t have more time to give, Tony!” A loud grunt filled the ear piece. Another groan. A scream.
She bit her lip as her body went through a shiver. Everything about her felt cold and miserable. Her grip on both the photograph and the newspaper tightened as she tried to suck in any tears that were threatening fall.
The building had seemed to have gotten darker. The large windows were constantly covered with blinds, the colours on the walls slowly losing its bright touch. The office didn’t feel the same anymore. But Obadiah had nothing to complain about. The entire building was his. Maybe under a different name but definitely under his control. The colours, the darkness never bothered him and the employees never tried to bring it up.
“Something happened at Stark Industries today. Nat and I were there looking through a few archives and suddenly there was an attack.” Steve was very particular in the information he was sharing. He didn’t need James to know that he was snooping around his best friends company and add another excuse to hate him more. “There was a metal man, almost resembling the one of Iron Patriot but darker. It was more silver and grey. With a lone star, almost like the communist symbol. I’m pushing it with the symbol but—"
After everything that happened, they’d assume the world would be burning but nothing moved. Even the leaves on the trees didn’t dare to move.
“Buck, your arm is like a second sun. Why do you gotta do this?” Steve groaned, covering his eyes while taking a seat on the high chair.
"That oversmart Rogers found this. And if he can find it, who else can."
MAY 2005 — Slow progress, meeting at expo unsuccessful
Numerous gloomy light bulbs were lined up against a dark metallic roof. The walls were dark, the room seemed small and a buzzing electrical sound carried throughout the area. The barred door opened led to a room full off ten guards wielding their guns ready to shoot. There in the corner sat a man with lost unblinking eyes.
“13 minutes ago, I had received a notification of depleting content of nanoparticles. There was a report of damaged particles. I can only assume Boss began using the particles to create different Bleeding Edge specifics. The suit is still quite new, it only carries a finite number of nanites and if Boss was constantly trying to rebuild to create different weapons the particles are getting lost and used. Even in combat, the suit is bound to lose particles. The report had recorded only 40% of remaining nanoparticles.”
Sorry for the wait, I was trying to get this chapter and the next properly planned out and interesting enough. I hope it was worth the wait!
“What happened?” Pierce spoke up.
“No.” He whispered as she held onto him.
“That’s that then.” Pierce spoke up.
Ever since Steve saw the videos he has been completely quiet. He's been in his office posting his wall with information that could somehow lead him to Tony. Steve knew, with evidence that his friend was alive and waiting to be saved.
“They came to me. When that Rogers kid lose the brain child behind all this we were near ruins. First, the kid tried to help and he still does—but then about three months later, came HYDRA. They needed weapons and that’s what we’re—I’m best at.” He looked proud. HYDRA came to him and not the other way around. Not a lot of members can say that.
Steve knew exactly what to do in this situation. He’s been trained, Tony’s watched him learn this techniques. Steve stared at Tony, reassuring him that it will be okay, they will be okay. Steve was going in an order—raising his hands, dropping the shield, and trying to conjure up a last minute plan. This is exactly how a hostage situation needs to go.
LOCATION.
But it's different now. Being the president-elect there were some things that he needed to work on. Joseph needed to work on his power voice and on his confrontation skills. Charisma has always come easy to him--and he is convinced that's how Steve got his. But having the power to squeeze out the truth was Sarah's job.
“So after the attack at Stark Industries, we went underground for a couple days.” Steve nodded along as Natasha spoke. “While we hid, I went through this.” She flashed the drive in her hand in front of his gaze.
“Hey,” Tony whispered.
happened?” Sam offered and Steve cleared his throat and turned the corner, leading the way. No matter how many he’s seen the place, it still sends chills down his spine as if someone is watching him.
“Whatever happened, like you jamming your shield into Tony’s chest.”
“What do you mean? What about the nanotechnology?” Bruce’s hands formed into fists. He was done looking at them, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t still angry at himself.
“We’ll give you some space.” With that, the girls marched their way outside the room, slowly shutting the door behind them.
“I would but there is no slack to give him, he already has too much of it. It was a miracle that he was elected a second time and he’s still not given a lasting impression."
hates
Moving the curser slowly and hesitantly clicking on the next video, Steve tried to keep watching them. He kept trying to catch a glimpse of Tony, his friend, the man he left behind. His eyes kept staring at the illuminating light coming from Tony’s chest. But before he could take in more information he would keep shutting the videos down before their ends.
Sam couldn’t be a prouder best friend. He knew how much Steve’s father was fighting to get to this point and he had helped in every way possible.
“Died. Yes, I was not able to save him and that metal machine killed him. In front of me.” There was silence in the room. Steve knew James was on the vice president’s security detail and he also knows that James is one of the best men at his job. He only ever heard rumours of what was able to defeat the iron patriot but never believed them. But there truly is a machine that is much more advanced and powerful.
“So he’s alive.”
Tony always wrote differently, depending on the urgency of the matter. In block letters, above all the news articles, in red pen read “Need cookbook, dinner at 8”. The word dinner was scratched out and overtop was written “home-cooked dinner”.
“There has to be a way to fix this.” Bruce whispered.
“Right, right. Of course. I’ll be there."
He's really bad at confrontations. He loves facts, he wants all the knowledge he possibly soak in. He likes things to be exactly what it says it is, but when it comes to questioning the truth of it he rather not do it.
“You look like a proud parent staring up at his kids.” Sam walked over with two glasses of champagne, passing one to his friend.
“Steve, it is incredible that you are spending so much time looking for your friend. It is commendable. But son, it’s been ten years. So much happens in the ten years and at a time even hope seems impractical. Sarah, tell him."
I hope this was worth the wait!
A light knock broke the silence.
“I am. But why Stark Industries? I can give you all the information you need from them, you don’t need to waste your resources infiltrating anything."
“Are you alright?” Her eyes blinked back to the computer as FRIDAY’s voice registered in her head.
"No no, I wouldn't ever hint such a thing. Plus that was Tony's thing, not really yours, right?" Stane stared at him, unblinking. Joseph knew what he was trying to do; everything about this visit was the rile him up and Stane's shoulders were starting to stiffen.
The wall dropped in front of them. Nothing was stable, the building kept shaking and Steve kept trying to backtrack out of the building with the shield in front of him. The machine kept blasting the walls as it crept closer and the floors around them, sending every paper and dust flying around them. Steve’s ears were ringing, he couldn’t pay attention to anything Sam was currently saying. By the looks of it, Sam was trying to shoot it.
“Steve—“ Sarah placed her hand on his.
Until the last page came into sight. It was folded and tucked nicely close to the crease, almost forgotten. Inside the folded sheet had a date circled—September 3rd 2006. The date of the assassination of President Chester Phillips. Beside it said
“Of course you didn’t have enough people in your ‘hands’. The results after the last three elections pushed the people so much they needed a change. And anyways, you were supposed to take care of the opposition.”
“Trust me, when I’m done, no one will be sitting.” Obadiah stared up at him and placed his little stress ball down near the picture of him and the owner.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We should go to the centre of the building, that’s where it—“he sucked in a deep breath as Sam continued to look at him. Sam needed his friend to face the facts, he needed him to face the reality but that wasn’t going to happen if Steve never speaks about it. And Steve never likes to talk about it.
“Congratulate your father for me, Steven. It was a good win."
There were only a few missions that Steve has flown with James as of late. And he’s only seen the machine only a couple of times. Everyone’s always in awe of it, with its high technology and advanced weapons. It’s almost like second skin on James.
“Or that, we’ve bled here too many times and we need something fresh."
Alright, so writing this was a little tough because these kinds of scenes are definitely out of my comfort. I really hope that it makes sense while you were reading this.
“It’s quiet and brighter than we thought.” Sam replied.
"What did you find?"
“That’s because of the Accords.” Steve whispered.
Her fingers slid the photo closer to her, turning it to face her.
“I gave you Project September!”
“Whatever happened two years happened, we need to move away from that and focus on fixing the wrong.”
“That place. That man in the office. I knew them."
“We can still do something.” Steve’s voice broke through the silence as his voice hung over the heads of the rest of the team.
This time was different. There were papers on the floors and not discarded rubble.
“Maybe less than 40%.”
"I didn’t want you to have to choose.” Steve had inched closer to her, close enough to see Tony’s scribbles on the newspaper.
“I hope to be expecting you at the your father’s security meeting."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alexander Pierce, the loser.” Pierce rolled his eyes, as if he wasn’t getting enough of it from the Founder. “Welcome to Stark Industries."
“Yeah, neither am I."
“Oh god,” Steve managed to whisper as he kept his hand on Vision. The entire world seemed to feel heavier.
“Mom, the man is leaving the post in a few months lets cut him some slack."
“Or very smart, coming back at our lowest.” Natasha replied. Bruce pulled his sleeve to his fist to try to call out for the Hulk again before it was too late. Steve looked up to the ship, getting ready to predict its landing as it came closer into view. Rocket’s eyes widened.
“He’s not dead."
“Thanks, Anna! I thought you’d be inside.” Steve smiled, patted her back while they embraced.
“Honey."
Steve wouldn’t be able to remember what.
“Good morning, captain. Ready for you mission?"
Finally being done with managing the presidential campaign for Joseph, Sarah had time to work on her baking skills. So far her days were spent either reading files with Joseph or reading different recipe books for new experiment. Steve was always up to try her new creations and when he had walked through the door this afternoon he was very excited to try everything she was offering. But now sitting at the table as his mom took her spot, his mind floated back to Stark Industries.
“Tony?” She looked up at him and his face, under all that dried blood and those injuries, had turned pale. His knees start to feel weak as he grips her tighter.
There was a man in the machine.
But how much of it was true.
"Mr. Stane will see you now, Mr. Rogers." Joseph quickly stuffed his phone in his pocket and flashed the receptionist a smile and half-way marched to the office door.
"Stane, calm down, this doesn't link you to anything." Strucker rolled his eyes.
"All I'm saying is that in all that information everything was easily blackened out, except," Joseph reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a photograph, "your initials."
"This Rogers is getting out of hand." Skull kept staring at the image as other information flashed before his eyes. All that information that could possibly link him to finding Tony, to knowing the reality of the iron soldier.
“Steve.” The dark spoke as a person emerged. She was dressed in black leather blazer on top a white shirt with the casual slim jeans. Her sense of an casual outfit while carrying dangerous secrets. “Congratulations.” She pulled him in for a hug.
what he is doing?  I am not his best friend."
“So you finally realized.” a voice spoke up behind Tony. Steve’s voice echoed in his head.
“Why are you with HYDRA?” Obadiah’s eyes did not waver as he continued to look dead on into Pierce’s eyes. Obadiah almost knew.
“We needed to know why SHIELD wanted this so badly. And why Stark Industries was willing to tear down their building to stop us from getting it."
Today he was expecting someone. Not someone wanting to buy Stark weapons but someone with more membership clearance. He let the room stay dark with the exception of a couple of window behind him. The natural light hitting him from behind gave his entire look an edge. Something to fear.
“Have a seat."
But instead they sat inside the crowded room as Anna tended to their wounds. Mostly Steve’s.
“Because we’re are the same as we were two years ago.” Rhodey had stiffened up as he fall his fall all over again in head.
Pierce sat in the room with Skull and Strucker yelling back and forth, flipping through Stark Industries files and making silent notes on who to fire and who he could possibly turn into his side. Everyone seemed to still adore Tony.
He could be gone.
“He loves to play stupid jokes on me. Where is Gamora?”
“It is the way it is being accessed. Rather than typing in a password, an old encryption code is running to decrypt the entire file.”
Hands still in the air, he took a step closer to the spotlight, slowly closing the distance. As closer he got the further they seemed to go.
“Stay safe kids.” With that, Pierce waved them a hand and walked out, leaving a sky full of clouds behind him.
“I don’t care, get out now! Something is coming, something—“ A loud blast erupted through the window panels on the side. Glass shattered everywhere, papers flying in the air, a white noise filled the air. Steve let Natasha out his arms as they faced the rubble in front of them. Sam’s voice kept picking up static but Steve hoped his voice was going through.
"How about we bug him?" Pierce annouced. His eyes were still stuck on his files as his hand crossed out another employee.
“I don’t see anyone in the entire floor, Nat."
“Tony, open your eyes, look at me.” Her voice loud, afraid. Between his blinks, he takes in a glimpse of her as his eyes close and everything around him goes dark. The last thing to reach him was her voice screaming his name.
“Nothing, just lost in thought."
“You still have it, right?”
“Hydra has always been doing human experiments. How is this one any different?” The words ‘experiment’ on the screen were starting to burn in his eyes. Something was wrong. Steve could feel their tones—trying to stay calm and collected. They were scared and nervous. Natasha clicked on the folder presenting him numerous recordings.
Pierce was quiet. The table was large. Different agents and members filled the chairs while Pierce stood at the end across from the big man, the Founder. It was a big secret reveal; this was what HYDRA had been hiding from him. The asset. He always knew it existed, there was a reason why the assassinations were so easy. They had a killer, they had trained a ruthless, emotionless killer and it was finally time for the big reveal. He was finally going to be in on the secret.
Blair House was absolutely enormous. The conference room alone was majestic. The seats equally spaced apart and the decor screamed of poise and beauty. The windows allowed the perfect amount of sunlight and kept all the traffic sounds outside. It was in complete privacy.
“Steve, I need more time. This server is taking forever."
“That’s why you have an ice pack.” Anna wrapped a cut on Steve’s arm. Sam rolled his eyes as thinking kept filing in his head, thinking about that compound.
“There’s no reason to lose hope.”
-----
“But you left him alone. You left me alone. You left us alone when we needed you, when we needed to stick together. But you left because YOU thought YOU knew better because you think you have the right to make people’s decisions for them. You know nothing! Now we don’t know what to happened to Tony because the team wasn’t together.” She shoved him back and threw the photo at him. "And you wrote you were doing what’s best for the team.” Steve held onto the glossy paper in his hand, knowing exactly what it was. She sniffed back her tears and kept her eyes away from everyone. She knew this wasn’t the right time to argue about what happened two years ago but her mind was trying to understand every little detail that happened and nothing was making sense. The only thing that seemed to make sense to her was how much she needed to see Tony and hold him and tell him how she feels. She didn’t want to think about the nights she had jolted out of bed because she heard Tony screaming in pain. She was trying to make her brain stop showing her moments of Tony waking up from nightmares about his chest. Tony had told her that his dreams weren’t just about Afghanistan—every time it felt like his chest was being ripped open.
“There is something here, Sam. At least someone was here and left before we came.” Steve walked over to the large glass box. The box that has always haunted him. He never figured out what it was for. There was no more frost evident and the cracks that had already covered the glass were larger.
“This is the video folder. There is a project Hydra has been working on for quite some time just not to our knowledge.” Natasha took a breathe and Anna continued.
“What’s wrong?"
“Steven."
“Right. Either way, it doesn’t seem completely out of suspicion. Especially since, things seem to be heating up. Our intel has been going through the roof, as if HYDRA has started to plan something big. It wouldn’t hurt to check this out.” Anna pointed at the folder.
And, this asset was their biggest secret.
“Pierce, this was supposed to be an easy win. We already had them in our hands.” Another voice spoke to him.
“Sounds fair.” Steve watched as Natasha attached the drive to the computer and the screen came to life. A folder opened to numerous files stored safely. They were all numbered with a specific order. Steve moved his eyes towards the girls, urging them to continue.
“I just have to see what it is. I’ll be right behind you."
“Ah, yeah. Sorry. I’m fine.” Steve lightly touched the corner of his shield, reassuring him it was still there and was ready to be used. Each time Steve made his way to the facility he was always hoping to find someone, some life just so he could fight them and demand answers.
“We can settle this in the best way. Just put down the gun and we’ll talk like grownups.” Skull smirked.  Expressions were filing away in Steve’s head. Skull already had something planned. Tony’s shoulders hunched up as Skull whispered something in his ear. Steve would always remember the look on Tony’s face—the horror that crowded his face.
WARNING
Sorry for the delay!
“Bullshit.” No one replied. This was supposed to be easy. Pierce taking over for Daniel was supposed to be an easy transition. But no matter how much they tried to influence Rogers, it just became harder.
Her mind went red, an alarm blaring in her ears, the fell apart again.
“Captain Rogers,” Fury’s voice shot his eyes wide open. It was too early for that voice. He could a cup being placed on the table. Everyone was already up and ready to deal with the day ahead of him. He’s usually one of them.
"Why are you here?"
It was Tony Stark.
Steve kept walking towards Tony, hands still raised up high. He was so close in saving him, and bringing him home. They were finally going to have that drinking challenge.
Bruce stared at his hands. What if the Hulk came out? The Hulk had come out before but he wasn’t able to land a proper hit on Thanos; what it have made a difference again? Could his loss of control over the big green man have cost them Vision?
“Steven, I know you.” Steve sighed, turning his head towards the sandwich and its homemade bean patties and guacamole with the perfectly placed vegetables. It was right amount of crunchy.
What do you think? Please let me know, any advice or opinions, anything. I'd love to hear it! Do you like it so far?
As usual please let me know what you thought of it? Is it still interesting, I hope so! I hope you liked it!
The leaves ruffled quietly. The air was thick. Everything was a pin drop silence. Little specks of dust surrounded what was left of the team.
"But Tony came, Steve.” Her voice had gotten soft as she saw Tony flying to talk to Sam, as she heard how much Tony regretted seeing his team caged up like animals. Her anger lessened at the thought of Tony arriving at Siberia, promising her he’ll do everything to help Steve and his friend. "Tony came to help you, to fight on your side, to protect someone he didn’t know anything about because you didn’t want to open your mouth. He came to Siberia as a friend. But you kept a secret. You lied to Tony. You knew what happened to his parents but you didn’t tell him."
Experiments. Numerous of them.
Her ears rang, her eyes stung, and her body backtracked through the room and out the doors. Thanos may have hand ripped through whatever was left of the team to get to Vision but they still weren’t together. There was no belief in them being together, it was only a necessity. They had no real plan. Even with Ultron, they had an idea on how to design themselves.
“Some locals said they thought large cargo trucks driving into the compound and others said they saw a large metal man. When we got there, it was empty."
“TONY!” She yelled as she raced towards the ship and closer to him. Tony took a couple steps away from the ship, moving closer to her, as she stopped in front of him. Her breath hitched and loud and her eyes filled with tears. She never thought she’d see him again.
“Plus, even with me, Fury was being suspicious."
Sam and Anna would be having lunch on the patio today.
“Steve, honey?"
“Of course, what brings you here, man?” They were friends through Tony and without him as a buffer things were a little awkward. Especially since James was taken off from Stark Industries.
“How did you know?"
“What just happened?” Sam flew next to Steve and stared at the sky where the armour flew away.
“I—“ Steve began when the computers began to beep.
“He couldn’t be that big of a fool.”
“Of course, Founder.” A mirthless laugh echoed throughout the room as the body stood up and walked over to him. And there he was. And his face really was red.
Clenching and unclenching his hands, Steve took in a deep breath, focused his eyes and moved the curser to the next number
“Or something of that sort."
“Nat, when the machine is switching hands, I’m running towards it. You make your way down.” Steve started to position the shield properly on his wrist and his feet getting ready to jump towards the giant machine. There was a lag in the arc reactors, every ten seconds, the reactors need to load up.
“Sam, we are in a middle of something!” Natasha didn’t stop typing.
“I couldn’t have done it without you, son.” Joseph gave Steve a pat before someone from the party stole him away. Champagne was being opened, loud, proud chatter was slowly engulfing the entire room. People were scurrying around with papers, waving their phone around while trying to get pictures with the new president. His mother stood next to his father dressed in her finest—a maroon, high necked sheath dress with a black half sweater.
“It’s not! Ever since two years ago we had a chance, we could have tried to do something, but we didn’t even have enough time to plan. We could have known about Tony.” Her voice turned into a whisper as her heart broke a little bit more.
“First congratulations Mr. Rogers on your win. I’m glad it worked out the way it did.” Joseph smiled at him, shoulder broadening. “Next your security detail. You can easily use the secret service to handle it but I wouldn’t recommend it."
"He isnt even the president, Strucker, and you are already losing control of him?!" Skull's face was redder than Strucker had seen before. Almost like a ticking bomb getting ready to explode.
“In what? Videos? Videos of what?” Looking back at the girls, they quickly looked away. Their eyes trying to stay away from his prying eyes. “Guys?” Natasha clicked on a particular folder and it opened to a specific folder—
Bruce shuffled in his seat, remembering something. “Why weren’t we together?”
“Sam, now!” Sam flew over to the reactor and shot in the light, frying all the technology. One of three. As the machine worked on trying to remove the shield from the arm, Steve grabbed its neck and swung himself around it, thighs tightening around its waist. He tried to smash the face armour, trying to bash it open to reveal any sort of wires to him. The machine reached up behind and swung Steve across the wall, throwing the shield out of its arm, strutted towards him.
“No you’re not. I’ve seen it. I was on a mission a while back, a job with the old vice president. There was a threat that a metal man was seen in places my suit has not been. His security thought that someone was trying to copy Tony’s creations. And ever since I left Stark Industries, I’ve thought the same. Never believed it, until I saw it in a fight to save the VP."
“What makes you think that?"
“Of course. But Steve remember, John F. Kennedy was also a good president but he never finished his presidency.” Steve stared at Pierce. His mouth opened and closed and opened and closed again. Steve wanted to say something but the entire assassination of JFK played in his head. His mind filling through various information, trying to understand Pierce’s words. Steve tried to read between the lines and he only keep up with one conclusion.
“You’re back. You’re really back.” She spoke into his chest and whatever was left of the suit. Her voice was breaking, her eyes hurt as she tried to keep her tears locked.
“We have other plans in motion that have better assets at work.”
“There has been no sign of his body, no sign that he died in that blast. Even if he hadn’t and he was killed by HYDRA they would throw that information in our face. There is something we’re missing."
Joseph folded his hands and then wiped them on his pants. Sucking in a deep breath, he pulled out his phone and stared at this wife's number. The numbers bolded in his head, screaming at him to call.
And there he was. Locked down in a chair with wires leading up to his head. He was still wearing the armour’s metal arm as engineers worked on the blaster and doctors studied the reactor on his head.
“Boys be careful,” Steve’s earpiece said as Sam and him entered the dark, moon lit factory compound. Everything seemed the same, as if the ten years were a complete stand still inside. Steve knew he had the entire building mapped out in his head—this wasn’t his first time returning.
“You think I CARE?!” The Founder faced Pierce, his face burning red almost as if it was ready to pop.
“Thank you. What brings you here."
“Pierce.” Steve got up.
flashed at the screen.
And pain.
“They already are, and either way at least they’re thinking about me."
“Take care of yourself."
“Morning sir."
“Oh my god. Of course. How long were you waiting to bring that up?” Her voice finally rose as she stared at him from the dining table.
“Quill—“ Rocket began when Nebula showed up at the entrance. With Tony right behind her.
SUIT SPECS.
The two glanced at each other then scanning the room for any exits. No windows and only one door. The door facing a different sound and that was obviously making its way toward them.
“You still don’t like to talk about him in the past tense."
“Honey—"
“I understand. All the information is easily accessed by you, but they have secrets. Saying you’re a friend of Tony Stark will only gain the same amount of information as he would get. Yesterday, Obadiah Stane and Alexander Pierce met up and Pierce had become director.” Steve stared at Nick. Pierce knew nothing about Stark Industries, he wasn’t even closely related to the company. There was no connection between Stane or Pierce either. “It’s HYDRA."
“Weapons is your speciality, not people, not master plans. But weapons. And I’m good with people, with plans. HYDRA still needs you but somewhere else. So if you still want to be known to the public as the man who protected Tony Stark’s legacy, I suggest you listen to what I’m saying and step down graciously and let me take control."
Steve shut off the recording before the screaming could begin and decided to skip the new few videos.
“The man with the ego. You realize that will be your downfall."
“Because it’s not Stark Industries anymore."
“We don’t know anything about the Stones but they had the ability to bring back Vision, they have the power to take people away from us, they would have the power to bring them back.” Bruce nodded.
“What did you find?"
The moment Joseph walked out the door, Stane's hand threw the crumbled photograph behind him. He was promised that nothing would ever lead to him. Skull had made it clear that he would be left out of all the information that could ever be found.
“Thoughts do not count for anything Alexander.”
Grabbing his coat, Stane marched down to the garage with the photograph squeezed in his hand.
“What is your problem?!” Steve stood up and turned towards to stare at her. His hands were in fists and his eyes a mixture of anger and exhaustion. They never had this conversation and they needed it—only they imagined to have this argument on a different day.
lingered on his lips as the dream played itself back in his head. Like always, the same dream, the same ending, everything the same. He ran his head through his hair, keeping it out from his eyes. That look in Tony’s eyes before the blast always keeps coming up, mocking him that he was never able to save him.
“He didn’t pop up anywhere? Not even maybe a glitch?”
“Quill?” Rocket whispered as she looked at him and back to the ship.
Tony had told himself and Steve.
"Then what do
“I had a couple of questions about your past missions.” James took him into his office.
Thanks for reading!
“We kinda hoped that you never would.” Tony turned towards him with a small smirk.
Steve watched his parents as they spoke to different people while getting pats on the back. His dad hadn’t even sat on the seat yet, nor had he been sworn in but people already looked lighter—as if a weight had been lifted off their shoulder. Weight of uncertainty about the future.
“He brought back Vision, even after Wanda was able to k…” Bruce took in a breath, “even after Wanda managed to keep the stone away. The Doctor, Doctor Strange, spoke about a Time Stone and I can only assume that is what Thanos used."
“Yeah? How come?” Steve stood by the bathroom door.
"No, you watch it, Schmidt." Stane's finger pointed Skull straight in his face. No one ever uses Schmidt in the building, everyone knows his name but never braved to say it. Skull only uses it when he's out making business deals and making the HYDRA plans come to life. He hated it. And Stane knew it.
Steve stood by the door, keeping his eyes out, ready for anything to strike. Natasha’s fingers typed fast, she knew if there is anything remotely related to HYDRA it would be buried deep. Under unmarked folders, suspiciously marked.
"Mr. President-Elect, have a seat." He didn't look at Joseph who silently thanked all the circumstances that kept Obadiah from facing him.
“Taking into account he could be anywhere in space, that report could potentially be hours old.” She hung her head, bit deeper into her lip as her mind connected the dots she kept buried.
“This tech is slower than what they usually have, it’s going to take some time!” Tony was scrambling at the keyboard, trying to do anything possible to make the upload faster but also trying to lessen the amount of minions fighting Steve.
“The encryption is harder than it seems. This file is locked really tight, Stane definitely did not want anyone to see this.” Natasha kept typing. Steve stood by her side, his eyes running back and forth between the door and the computer screen.
Sam flew up behind the machine aiming for its right knee cap, hoping that it reacts like a human. The right knee buckled and the machine flew on it and while leaning on its right fist, it turned its left hand behind him towards Sam and blasted. Sam tried to dodge, retracting his wings, but the blast was faster, cutting through the left wing. Down went Sam and up went his parachute. Steve kept his back leaned on what was left of the wall, panting, quickly trying to regain his breath. The machine came closer and Steve reached for anything close and slammed a metal rod into its side.
Bucky and Sam had been sipping their coffee when Steve walked in the room. He still hadn’t changed while the two were ready to face the day head on. Bucky’s metal arm shone brightly in the sun bouncing right into Steve’s eyes.
“Is this about Tony again?"
“Create another Iron Patriot?"
“I don’t know what happened.” Steve started and Nick’s expression never changed. “You know, I go back there sometimes for my own curiosity. And that’s what I did last week but as I was nearing the main room an explosion ran through and I was thrown back.” Still no change.
“With the damage that titan has done, we would need more than one stone back.” Thor interjected Bruce, “singularly the stones are strong but not strong as when they are when put together.”
“Dad, come on."
The boys filled into the seats facing Nick and he finally closed his file and looked up at them. Steve’s mom rubbed her son’s arm and turned her attention to the speaker.
“What is it missing?"
The name blinked continuously in front of her eyes.
As the power in the reactor was building up, Steve spun his shield away from his arm and slammed it into the right of the attacker. It was quick and strong.
“Then, before I say more, I’m sorry to be ruining the moment, but,” Steve faced Sam. He knew what this meant.
“Each time I think I’ve gotten in, it throws another wall at me. As if I running against another person who is one step ahead of me. I’ll get it."
Pierce’s voice echoed in his ears. There was more to that than just stating a fact.
“Guys, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.” Steve stared at both of them as they entered the small office.
“Why didn’t you use your wings, Sam?” Anna spoke up for Steve. A small smile stayed on his lips as Sam tried to defend himself.
After the grim meeting, Nick motioned at Steve towards the door. As they excused themselves, Nick closed the door behind and before Steve had time to set the conversation Nick started speaking.
“Just Steve remember."
A scream rang through the halls and his mind shut up and concentrated on that voice. He knew that voice. The scream yelled again and his feet picked up the speed, cut through corners, following the voice.
“Together.” Steve finally spoke.
. Natasha drew in a breath and double clicked not realizing the chain reaction that was about to follow.
His mind was not on his side.
Someone was inside the machine.
“Because there doesn’t seem to be enough people we can trust. The presidency has not changed for a long time, its been the same part different leaders and in all that time, what do you think they have done on the inside. Finally, we are seeing different colours and the opposition is not happy. They are losing their power but they may have suspected this. So for the time being, we do not know how much they’ve prepared for this situation or who is really on our side."
“None of them…they all just…”
It wasn’t working.
Again. Silence.
“How’s it looking?”
Under a thin manila file folder the New York Times sat comfortably. There was a thick coffee mug outline from her cup that morning. Different news articles were scattered throughout the page—some talking about the UN meeting with the Wakandian King T’Challa, another had an update about the Sokovia Accords, and something else about college funding.
The man in metal. The man with the fake heart. The genius boy wonder. He was supposed to be dead, ten years ago or mission in action. But here he was, kept under the Mad Zola’s control. Ready to comply.
“Mission report. Now.” Tony blinked and slowly turned his face back towards him.
“Yes? Sorry.” Steve said reaching for his mug as his mother pulled it away.
Almost praying to himself that this file not have another blacked out, Joseph opened the file.
It wasn’t moving.
“My apologizes, Founder. I really thought I had it."
“Not at all. It was only me.” Nick seemed pleased with the answer, maybe not entirely convinced but okay to move on.
“The Founder is not impressed.” an agent spoke up from the silence while turning towards him.
“Last time I was here, there were no working bulbs, but this time the halls are lit up.” Steve turned the corner, skipping the hallway and going straight to the end for the door and there it was. The large glass cell in the centre and a buzzing computer screen. It was just like Steve remembered, just how he saw it ten years ago.
“Is everything okay?” Steve nodded at the papers and his fathers hands automatically closed the file and placed a firm hold on top.
As the drone of the computer continued, she continued her pace to Tony’s R&D room, planted herself in front of a screen and began typing.
“That’s fine, I was getting tired of this place anyways, time for a change of scenery."
Steve shot up from his bed panting, hair tangled and sweating.
“How much of his suit is left?”
"We were supposed to be together.” She sniffed back the tears.
“Oh my goodness, Joseph!” More light chuckles as they all continued eating.
“Don’t you ever leave without me ever again.” She cupped his face in her hands as he closed his eyes, appreciating her touch. He leaned down to her shoulder and pulled her in a hug, with his grip tight around her waist.
For the past years, every electoral win had been a loss for the people. Everything was unstable, the country losing money, allies and support from the citizens. There seemed to be a restriction on positive and hopeful thought for the people, there was a fear of control and constantly surveillance. As if everyone knew everything about the other. As if they were constantly asked and regulated into conformity. Yet, everything felt the same. Democracy was still alive. People were still able to make their choices but it wasn’t the same.
It barely reacted. But when the mask turned back to him, Steve thought it looked angrier.
"Watch your mouth Stane!" Skull went back to the tomato red he was a minute ago.
The after party was buzzing with supporters and volunteers walking around congratulating each other. Everyone held a glass of champagne in their hands with pride that better things were coming. Joseph stood proudly next to his wife taking pictures with everyone.
“Stark Industries."
“SAM! I told you run the other way."
Also, poor Steve.
“It’s not Thanos?” She asked him.
Something was different this time. It was cleaner, things seemed to be in place or out of the way—the stairs were visible. There were dim lights this time, unlike the last time Steve came back. As usual Steve had come back there and as usual he found nothing.
“I understand your spirits about our government has been wavering. Everyone is uncertain about so many things that are happening in the offices. But tonight, you proved to us that while things seem hard and uncertain we can still pick ourselves up and even though nothing good seems to prevail we will still fight that towards the best. Towards positivity and sunny ways.”
A bang. It echoed from the walls and lingered in his ears. There wasn’t anything else in his ears and that worried him. He needed the chatter from Tony’s side. His constant complaining and quirks. This was too quiet.
“What is it?"
“Yes."
Right now, he hoped that this was the last piece in the puzzle.
“Mom, what if he needs me to keep looking? I can’t do that to him, I owe him that."
The screaming had just started when Steve bolted for an exit from that video. Yet, he continued. He needed to know what Tony had gone through even know he hadn’t been able to fully, completely watch a single recording.
“So I met the first lady today and she couldn’t find enough words to express how happy she is that President Strucker is finally leaving the presidency.” She sat in the middle of the two men . Joseph sat quietly eating the dinner while Steve smiled back at his mom, happy for the conversation.
"Excuse me?!"
“It’s not about bringing it up, we all know the reason.” Steve didn’t look at her. He could feel burning into his skull.
The sun shone through the curtains slapping him in the face, warming his cheeks, reminding that the dream was ten years old. Its been a week since he saw that metal machine blasted through the corridor of HYDRA’s compound. Since he read all about HYDRA’s failed experiments. Steve knew he was missing something. As if they gave him a fill in the blank document.
“Sam, where’s Sam?” Rhodey’s eyes kept jumping bush to bush, teammate to teammate. Sam wasn’t too far from him when Thanos flicked them away from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
AUGUST 2005 — OS found designs, patient becoming compliant
“I would have been but some things came up.” She waved a file in front of them.
“Sku—Founder, we made a mistake of sending him in so fast.” Zola piped in.
“It’ll heal, I just wasn’t expecting that I’d have to fight a giant machine while trying to extract information."
The computer kept its continuous sound beeping periodically through the speaker. The clock ticked away. Tony hated that clock, Tony liked the silence. He had said it reminded him of how much his brain was buzzing.
That’s the endgame.
“It’s most likely a scare technique. HYDRA has been quiet for too long and they crave attention so while they are failed experiments, they still want us to know how ruthless they can be. Freezing people to test their survival rates, its outrageous and terrifying. They want us to know they mean business.” Anna said. Hydra was making a point and they all knew it, they need that terror back. Hence the explosion. Their assassination rumours are scary enough but if they were willing to blow up their buildings then they want attention.
Files filled the entire table. Pages falling out of some, corners folded of others. Pens were scattered with the files and a yellow highlighter was held tightly in the grips of Joseph Rogers. He was staring at the file of the president who was killed before his inauguration. The vice president, who instead was sworn in and stayed in office for eight years also had a blacked out file.
I hope the images weren't too graphic or vivid. If they were, please let me know and I will fix that warning at the top.
"You had signed the accords. It was already too late.” Steve breathed.
He always worked great under pressure but Steve’s voice wasn’t helping him. They’ve done countless missions like this before, these are the only kinds of missions they’ve done. But Steve’s never sound this beaten up. They didn’t prepare for this.
“Tony, look at me.” His eyes keep blinking as they tried to focus and stay open.
"We are not killing him before the swearing in, you idiot."
I'm back!! I've been away to a trip to the mountains and it was absolutely incredible but I had not been able to write or post. I hope this was worth the wait!
“I’ll try my best.” Nat rolled over behind a wall and Steve waited. Each time a new blast started, there was an entry point. Steve’s stance became stronger and the machine changed its hand from left to right and Steve charged towards it. His feet were swift and light helping him quickly gain on the machine.
And they blantly decide to leave his initials on file.
“Being a president is always tough, the job never comes easy. But he will be a good president, his supporters will be proud."
“You need to start making your way out of there.” Sam ordered.
Taking support from the wall, she picked herself up and paced towards the dining table where only two days ago, she and Tony sat having breakfast. She needed the newspaper. One hand gripping the old photograph, she searched the table. Files scattered across the surface along with coffee mugs and Tony’s smoothie glasses.
There was large amounts of extensive research put into this—Tony had read everything they had on file to know about this. SHIELD has countless data on this organization, courtesy of both Steve and Tony, yet nothing completely revealed what the large holding cell did.
Also, "sunny ways" is something Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in his winning election speech. I had to.
“Take my picture with the president!” Sam threw his phone towards Steve. Joseph kept smiling ear to ear gladly patting his shoulder. He was still taking in everything, the adrenaline rush was going to make his cheeks hurt in the upcoming minutes. But he was glad to have the support of the family and friends.
“Either way, man, you’re going to be late. The security meeting is happening in an hour and your hair is still having a party. Get your ass dressed.” Sam put the coffee pot beside Steve as he rolled his eyes.
I hope it was worth the wait. Are you liking all the characters? I don't know how fast or slow I am going to move the story yet. But I'd love to hear any and all of your thoughts!
As the information continued to upload, Tony finally looked up at the glass box closely. There was frost on corners of the chamber. Small cracks scratched the surface. It looked painful, cold and lonely. Tony reached over to the glass and almost as if all the videos played simultaneously with volume on maximum in his head.
anymore!” She wasn’t talking about the avengers.
"We put a small bug in the Blair House and we would know everything that he is currently doing. At least we'd be up to speed to all his ideas and be ready to act before he does."
At the same time, Steve was trying to the bomb that Tony used ten years ago but it seemed as if he left no written records around. And Steve knew that. Tony would draw something out and try to follow it to the letter yet the modifications he would forget to add in until after he’s actually used it. Steve needed to know if that bomb was strong enough to kill his friend.
“Thank you. Thank you, everyone!” He raised an arm in the air for the people as everyone hushed. They looked so eager. Steve stood next to his mother with an arm around her shoulders with pride. “This is all possible because of you. Every one of you worked tirelessly with us, telling us what we need to focus on, what we need to strive towards. Because of your support, we have come this far.
As I said before, I hope the wait was worth it and you enjoyed reading this chapter. Please let me know your views and thoughts, I would love to hear them all!
“They were experiments. People were in those chambers, frozen in time and they tried to revive them. But none of them worked properly. Either they would never wake up, frozen too much, or they would wake up but without proper movements. No matter what, they all failed."
“Sir, I believe someone is trying to to access the Iron Soldier file on Stane’s server.” an agent spoke as she entered the Founder's office.
The two politely placed their glasses down and quietly made their way outside nodding happily at anyone who noticed them. It wasn’t quiet outside. Someone somewhere seemed to be celebrating. But while everything seemed bright and loud, a small corner near the campaign headquarters stood dark and full of secrets.
“Either excuse works, I’m happy to leave.” Natasha stacked out the Chinese take out food out of it’s bag while placing two beer bottles next to it.
“If you get blown up, I swear I will never forgive you,” Steve gave him a half smile and ran towards the sound echoing in the halls as Sam made his way the other way. Steve knew this was a death wish. But just what if it could be the answer he’s been looking for. Someone may give him some answers he’s been searching for. The sound was getting closer to him and it was large. Steve’s breath heightened as he slowed down towards a turn. A large blast ripped through the corner as Steve got shoved back.
“I told you to use the window on the second floor. Why wouldn’t you follow me?” Sam kept an ice pack on his elbow.
BLEEDING EDGE.
“You were careless.” The Founder was quick and sharp.
“Zola are you feeling sorry for him?” His face had gotten red, Pierce never thought it was possible that rumours could ever be true.
An overflowing crowd stood waiting for the new president and his speech. Ever since Joseph began to run for the presidency his speeches always struck hope and optimism in everyone’s heart. There was a way he spoke, the way he conveyed his future plans that made everyone positive about the future. He was a new hope.
“And Sam Wilson was not there to accompany you in your curiosity stunt?"
Screams. And more screams.
“Your suit. Tony built that right?” James sat up straighter in his chair. His eyes wandered from Steve to the door, unblinking. Steve could almost hear his head filing through conversations and memories. He was thinking of the right thing to say.
“These are all Hydra files, we made sure of that."
The next chapter is going to be longer and a bit more intense, I hope.
“You don’t owe anyone anything! You are constantly putting your life on the line and that is more than anything could ask for.” His dad fired back.
I am so sorry that I haven't updated in a while but I hope this was worth the wait! Please let me know your opinions!
"Either way, Project September needs to be put on hold."
"I'm considering my choices."
“It’s okay.”
“And without my shield, that ain’t happening. We’ll use the window at the next floor, come on.” Sam ran towards the stairs they had come down from. Steve also glancing once at the corner saw something. Something that was going to walk though his mind the entire ride home. It was large. And metallic. It was grey.
Together they looked the epitome of happy, with wide smiles and hands held together. It was a perfect moment. And Steve carefully, while remembering all the little details from the colour of the tabletops to the small fold on the campaign poster, stored it away in his head.
“It was my fault."
“I was not able to find any entries from the Boss after he was seen flying towards the saucer.” FRIDAY’s voice was barely a whisper, as if she knew she wasn’t helping.
The TV kept screaming with the cheers of countless supporters while a silence swept through the room. Papers laid scattered around the table with phones buried under them. Alexander Pierce stayed seated in the office chair with a arm swung around the top. His tie sat loose and pulled to the side while his collar lay uneven on his coat.
Zola stood next to Pierce as he stuffed his glasses in his suit pocket. The Founder stood in front of the man staring at his face as he sat there unmoving, motionless to all the movement. His hair sticking together with the sweat.
“You have another mission soon.”
“What?” he almost growled at Pierce’s smug face.
“And that’s why the Founder think you belong back in Research and Development.” The entire light was drained out of Obadiah’s face. Pierce was right, no one was going to be sitting as Obadiah jumped out of his seat.

Joseph threw another file down and opened another. As usual, the words were blackened out with the exception of some conjunctions and prepositions. Some dates were left out too.
But something always went wrong.
“How long do you think we were going to take before we realize your little tricks?"
Rhodey still managed to keep his step light, after everything, never losing his training. He knew about them and how they were growing together and spending time together. He understood how they built each other up and supported each other since they both down respectively. They had shared their quiet moments, where they sat in each other’s presence, gaining comfort and realizing what it meant for them to have each other. Rhodey knew about that stolen moment in Tony’s R&D where Tony and her stood so close to each other they could have felt each other’s breath. Looking at the newspaper, Rhodey squeezed her shoulder.
“The explosion at the compound last week. I need answers Captain Rogers.” Nick was serious, he was grim. He didn’t like being left out of the loop.
"I couldn’t tell him.” Rhodey stared at the both of them, his ears perked. Tony didn’t tell him everything.
“No, no sir. Not sorry at all, he’s just an asset. But no matter how much mind control we gain over him, Tony Stark will still have an emotional reaction to his company…to his friend. We should have prepped him longer.” The Founder sucked in a breath and slapped Tony across his face.
"Is everything alright?"
“Just president stuff, kid. Don’t worry. We should get started.” Steve gave him father a look and he knew there was more to the store. He knew his father was already suspecting the works of the past presidency and now that he had all the paper work at his disposal nothing was stopping him.
“I need to speak to President Strucker.”
“Dad I can’t have this conversation with you again. I already told you, there has been no body and that is not possible. If that blast killed him why would Skull take his body? If they had taken his body, wouldn’t it turn up one day? If the blast didn’t kill him, what happened to him? There are so many unanswered questions, I can’t just stop looking! What if I’m close?"
“It was a SHIELD mission.” From the corner of his eye, Steve could see his mother’s face drop. No matter how long he’s been in the military or with SHIELD, her face got the same look. "The company is under surveillance. Something is not sitting right with Nick and we had to check it out. It was fine. I’m here.” He added the last bit for his mom.
"Do you have any bright ideas about how to keep tabs on him? You can yell and turn red all you want, that isn't going to keep Rogers from doing what he wants."
“Steve, honey.” Sarah entered the room, bringing the light into the darkness. A soft touch stayed on Steve’s shoulder making him realize of his hands were covering his face.
“Don’t try to undermine me. I need to see the Founder.” Pierce stood up but the woman stood in front of him. “Agent, move."
“Mom?” Steve spoke up, expecting his voice to bounce on the walls. His parents heads shot up and automatically their expressions softened.
Strucker’s voice kept repeating in Joseph’s head. There was something about his tone that was almost threatening, warning him to keep away from the secrets. Joseph was on a mission to uncover every bit of information that was blacked out and unavailable to him. He needed to know what kind of office he was going into. He needed to understand the past, of what truly happened that resulted in the public demanding a new election early.
The video was fuzzy and hurried. It was too short to make out any specific details but as they slowed down each second, little pieces started to come together. There was a man struggling as pieces of armour were placed on him. His hands fighting to break lose. People dressed in long white coats started to scramble around the room with a little terror from the angry of the man. Finally breaking lose, screams filled the video as the man raced towards the camera using his hand blaster to wreak havoc around the room.
"How do--"
"BULLSHIT ROGERS. You knew about his parents. You knew what happened and because you chose not to tell him, you had to pay for the consequences. What ever happened in that bunker was because you wouldn't open your mouth. Because you decided to make the decisions for everyone. Because you thought you knew better. But you know nothing. You think because your name is captain that you know what to do, who to make decisions for. You know nothing, you came out of a bottle, the only thing you know is how to take care of yourself! Tony learns, he’s learning, he’s amending his mistakes. But you’re a hypocrite. Telling him you’re leaving him the avengers. You left him with an AI and a cripple. But you…” With the photo still in her hand she reached over to grab handfuls of his shirt as she stared up to him. Steve’s hand gripped the chair near him as he looked down at the love of his life.
The clock ticked away.
Stark Industries is a massive building. Every floor dedicated to a specific division for the company with the upper floors specific for member offices. Steve knew the layout by heart. He took it his responsibility to overlook the company as much as he possible could but also not cause any interference. He owed it to Tony.
Please let me know what you thought about it and if you have any advice! I would love to hear what you think!
Joseph only knew the surface about the man he was replacing. No other file had been blacked out so heavily. Nothing made sense, there was no need for secrecy, there shouldn’t be a need for secrecy. Personal information was covered, different policies were hidden. Specific things were kept away from him. Joseph dialled a number and spoke through.
Natasha pulled up the hammer again, locking and loading it towards the attacker but before Steve could speak up, the armour stood up straighter, turned around and flew away.
“How could we ever get close to the glove, let alone Thanos?” Natasha spoke up, still gripping the necklace in her hand.
“Just give me the entire pot, I need to drown in it.” Steve gulped the cup. “Fury needs to ‘chat’.” They all knew what Fury needed to chat about and they had a good idea about how it was going to go. Both men demanding answers but not offering any.
“After we looked at Loki’s Scepter we were able to figure out its properties, if I get enough time with the Stones or the gloves there is a chance to figure something about them.”
“I will kill him as many times as I need to.” Thor’s voice was rough. He was disappointed in himself. His people expected him to enact the revenge. He owed it to Heimdall. He owed it to Asgard. He owed it to Loki.
“Do we know where he is?”
-----
“I’m tired.” His voice was quiet, less than a whisper. His lips were dry. His eyes kept closing as his knees reach the ground. Her hands hold onto him, gripping his side and his shoulder.
"We need to take care of him." Strucker annouced.
“Let’s find out what Fury wanted to find.” Natasha clicked through files showing her images of new technology, old technology, James Rhodes’ suit designs, Tony’s work videos and finally came upon the file she saw before the attack
“What are you getting at Steve?” James had a particular look to him. His head was tilted to left, his brows still pulled together with one almost pulling up. He was not impressed and Steve finally let out a breath. He didn’t realize he was holding it in until now.
The photgraph was a snapshot of part of the paper that Joseph had been reading. Beside a date, OS clearly visible.
Sighing, Joseph closed the file and picked up another reading 2006 with a sharpie marker. Most files had been titled with computerized fonts and lettering—unlike this one. It was as if someone forgot it in the pile of files. Files that no one thought that any one would look through. With it folded in corners and almost scrunched up, the file had a different colour and it felt misplaced.
But this time.
“There’s no need for anyone to get hurt. Put it down.” And still nothing but Skull let him go. Tony was reluctant, his eyes looked everywhere in the room rather at Steve. While all Steve could do was stare at Tony and the bruises that Skull planted on his face. Tony looked scared and not because Skull managed to land a couple of fists at his face. Tony knew something.
I apologize for such a long wait. Writers block with other activities really takes a toll on writing. I hope the wait was worth it though and everyone still wants to know what happens next.
“Rocket.”
The girls were rushing out of the door, to their car, scrambling to call Steve and beelining into the Blair House. Tony’s face kept appearing in front of their eyes. The rugged beard and the mess hair, sweat pouring down his hair. There was anger piercing through his eyes, an almost animal look. It wasn’t the Tony they knew, the inventor, the futurist.
“Will you hurry up!” Without replying, Tony rushed over to the server and punched more keys.
“Sir, the crowd is waiting for you.” the organizer reminded him. Joseph takes in a deep breath as Sarah  helped him slip into his coat. Everything seemed to spin around him, he was cloud nine at this moment and he didn’t know if he could even come up with any coherent sentences to speak the crowd outside. They were waiting for him to wow them again. To inspire them and speak candidly.
Bucky’s disappearance, Wanda’s disintegration, and Groot’s good-bye played through her head. Every little cell was cranking its gears and working on creating a thought--an understanding of what had just played in front of everyone. The sun felt hotter, her suit stuck to her body tighter, her breath was uneven.
“Why do you still have that?"
Her mind corrected itself. As long she can’t identify those specks of dust as actually Tony then there was no reason to keep him in the past. The team sat silently in the dining area, an area Steve had grown accustomed to before he took the on-the-run life.
“Steve.” And there it was. It was the tone, it’s firm and strong almost gravely that Steve knew what was coming.
“Brighter?"
“Nothing is making sense, mom. That machine was exactly like the one James Rhodes has but Tony has always been secretive of his designs, no one knows the entire design. He always keeps some important piece of information to himself, something that brings everything together. And why would Fury even want me to go to Stark Industries, that company tries to stay transparent as possible. That’s what Tony wanted, he—“ Steve ate his words.
“Do you hear that?"
“How’s it looking so far?” the same voice whispered in both their ear pieces. Anna was sitting in front of a screen, keeping an eye out for any extremities that could unknowingly come towards the boys. Her eyes constantly moving screen to screen, staring at the camera views around the compound.
“Rhodey. Why did you leave Stark Industries?"
“He could try to contact me, if he is on the run how do I let him know I’m looking for him?"
It was a nice day.
“Sam, throw me my shield.” A screech started to build up and Steve grabbed Natasha’s hand and pulled her behind the large desk. And the computer was gone. The dust started to settle and there in front of them stood the same thing Steve saw almost a week ago. Metal in shape of a man. It was large, aerodynamic, and technological advanced. A large arc reactor shone brightly in their face. His arm was raised up towards them, aimed and ready to shoot.
“Cut the formal crap, Pierce. Let me show you something.” He walked Pierce out of the room and directed him to a room was surrounded by guards and doctors flipping through pages. “What you’re about to see is our biggest secret. We’ve been working on him for years. I knew this presidency would not work for you, you’re not charismatic enough. But it works in our favour.”
"So what, you want me to hack into it?"
I don't know why, but as I post each new chapter I get nervous.
“That’s my ship.” Everyone looked down at Rocket who kept his eyes glued to the ship. He was trying to figure out what to say at his team. Would he run towards Gamora? How would he tell them about Groot? Would all of them be in the ship?
Tony and her had changed a few since then. She had caught Tony looking at a picture of the entire team and beside it the photo of her and Steve. His jaw was clenched and his arms crossed in front of his chest. The next day they printed new photos but kept the picture of the team turned upside down on the corner, behind a frame that now held a picture that Happy had taken of the three of them.
They watched a few more video logs after the initial one. The video quality had considerably gotten better and it had become exceptionally clear that it was Tony. And the first number dialled on their phone went straight to Steve. With their rushed tones and fast breaths, Steve invited them to the house for a face to face.
The team hung their heads in silence. No one was moving but she could hear their minds producing names of people they wanted to check up in. Natasha’s eyes had gone towards the phone, back to the table then towards her necklace, and eventually closed. Her hands gripped the arrow that hung around her neck as her body refused to do anything else. Rhodey gripped his phone, trying to understand what he could say once he started moving through his contact list. Could he call his past trainees, his previous captains and generals? What would he say to them? What if they didn’t pick up, should he try different numbers? Rocket kept his fists closed—whatever he had of Groot he didn’t want to let go.
He’s been waiting, yearning to hear those words. He wanted someone to say those words to him in all these ten years, as if he was training himself on how to react when he would hear them. But now, when really hearing it in reality, it was as if the entire world was shaking and his breathing was quickening. The last moments he remembers kept playing in his head. That look on Tony’s face, the loud blast that engulfed him away from Steve. He wanted to say something, he didn’t know what to say. Should he repeat what Anna said? Should he question them on how they can be so sure? Should he even ask a question.

“And leave his entire company behind? And his friends and—"
“There are only a finite number of particles in that suit. The particles are used depending on he uses them and what happens during combat.”
“The Founder will see you when he wants to. Until then, he’s getting the asset prepped. You need to be patient and prepare your losing speech."
Sorry for the delay, caught up in planning the next chapter. I am going to try to get out chapters as soon as I can.
The room went up in a roar as everyone’s hands rose in the air to celebrate the results. Big letters spelling Rogers wins election with images of different locations flashed on the screen. There was confetti, cheers and tears. Hugs were being passed around in the room—everyone trying to pat the new president on the back for a strong win.
In front of him, the computer flashed it’s existence and his eyes were trained on the letters and numbers. His mind was chewing away at different scenarios that could explain its existence and they were slowly getting worse.
“Honey, you realize people are going to be talking about you the same way we are talking about Strucker."
“Tony’s last update came from his suit 15 minutes ago.” She announced to them. Rhodey was the first one to look up.
"We need to talk." Short and concise. An order. Obadiah's eyes finally left the design and looked up at the man standing in front of him. He meant business,
“Since Tony was there last."
“We didn’t realize you needed more help than what was already given to you.” Pierce rolled his eyes and rested his mouth on the back of his fingers.
“Why?” Steve piped it.
-----
“Because we had affectively closed down that facility after the incident. And, we had wasted our resources when we followed a hunch there before and found there."
Tony's screams echoed in the entire room. It wasn't like this was the first time Anna had seen the videos and heard the screams. She knew what was coming but she still couldn't truly face that reality.
