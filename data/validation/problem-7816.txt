“No you don’t,” Steve countered, sounding tired instead of antagonistic.  It was on the tip of Tony’s tongue to protest, because, of course, that wasn’t true.  He took care of himself just fine, but what did it matter?  It was over.  This whole, sordid mess was over.  He’d gotten what he came for, after all.  He walked down the front steps and onto the sidewalk, looking up long enough to watch the door swing shut with a bang.  Closure, Tony thought.  Probably a little more literal than Oprah had meant it, but still.
“I understood that reference,” Steve said happily. “Tony, we really should get going. Don’t want to keep Bruce waiting,” Steve said as he started to push himself up off the sofa. 23 and 25 sprang into action to help. 26 clapped excitedly.   Tony sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face.
“Peggy, it’s not really our—” Daniel started.
“Sure,” Tony nodded, holding his cup up like a promise.
.  For help.  Instead of…whatever this is you’re trying to do here,” Tony said as they started across the street.  “I mean, look, to be clear, we both know I’m not opposed to you taking off your clothes for money,” Tony added with a small shrug.  “I’m just saying.”
Some ghosts don’t stay buried. What was it he’d heard some New Age guru bullshitting on about her new book of soulmate secrets…the universe fights to bring two souls together. God, nature, destiny, science, call it what you will, but it struggles against our own free will to try to bring you together, gives you marks to help identify each other, sends a surge of endorphins when you do, so you’ll know. How many ways do you need to be told that it yearns for completeness just as people do?
“Guy loves numbers, what can I say?  I’m not one to judge,” Tony shrugged, grabbing his coat.  “The issue we talked about this morning handled?” he asked as he shoved an arm into the sleeve.
“Aren’t you two supposed to be honeymooning it?” Barnes asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow.  “What’s it going to look like, me showing up and third wheeling it?”
purpose, and it should probably terrify him, this knowledge, this certainty that the best possible version of each of them was the one where they loved the other, but all he could feel was a sense of peace, like everything before had been preparation for the chance to know this.
Tony growled, low and vibrating against Steve’s skin, his hands gripping Steve’s nape and arm like steel bands.  Steve tensed as Tony dipped his head, then startled as Tony licked a long, wet, hot stripe from Steve’s collar to just under his ear, his nose nuzzling against the curve of Steve’s jaw.  “I’m going to take you apart,” Tony warned, his voice a low, humming buzz in Steve’s ear.
Steve lifted his hand to his cheek and rubbed it.  Brock was staring at him, wide-eyed, his lip curled into a feral sneer.  Everything sort of slowed down to a series of scenes flashing in front of Steve’s eyes.  Brock’s face contorting.  A flicker of satisfied pleasure in his eyes.  Heat blooming on Steve’s cheek.  The feel of the table behind him shaking on its pedestal.  Steve’s mind screamed at him to move, to do something, but in that moment, he felt like he was one of those flies stuck on a glue strip, legs pulling desperately, wings flapping, trying to get away but unable to move.  A distant part of him recognized the symptoms of shock, almost dryly reciting them in his head, but for that span of heartbeats all Steve could do was stare, blinking slowly at Brock.  A terrible, dark voice in the back of his head, almost with relief, as disturbing as that was, thinking finally, finally we’re
“Yeah.  I know you can.  But, thing is, you don’t have to,” Barnes replied tightly.  “I know what taking this kind of step means, Steve.  Nat…God, if it hadn’t been for her, I don’t know what I’d have done after everything.  After we got home.  I was—it was bad.  My head.  My arm.  You—Jesus, you were a mess, and me—I was barely holding it together.  Couldn’t take care of me, much less you.  Fuck, man, some days, I didn’t want to get out of bed, but I had her.  Even then, that wasn’t always enough.  If she wasn’t who she is, she’d have left my sorry ass, the way I treated her.  I’m not proud of it, but I’m saying I know how hard this is.  Trying for something.  I know what the whole idea of this thing with Tony is doing to you.  I do.  I get it, Steve.  I really do.”
“Nonsense, they loved me,” Steve deadpanned.  “Well.  One of them did sort of throw a mortar at me.”
“Well.  I’m a shitty excuse for a human being.  I’ll just be walk of shaming it to my very startled, yet understanding, Uber now,” Kirk replied, sitting up slightly as he did.  “Sorry.  God.  Sorry, I really…my mouth sometimes, I don’t—”
“Yeah.  I missed y—” Tony began, only to have his words swallowed by Steve’s mouth on his, lightly at first, wind-chapped lips just brushing against Tony’s.
“Show me.  It’s okay, Steve.  Show me how much you missed me,” Tony husked out, catching Steve’s gaze from under lashes that were already wet and clumping together.  “Please.  Steve.  I need you to show me.  Alpha.
think, that the world is ready to know that people like you exist.  Oh, sure, they know about Captain America. Every school kid does. They put you in the pages of comics and on lunchboxes, turned you into some kind of legend, and they did such a good job, people forgot.  And you know why? Because they didn’t want to remember that there were people out there with abilities they couldn’t possibly match. That there are powers we are only beginning to understand. You think the public wants to hear about that kind of thing?  They want…frozen yogurt and a Starbucks on every corner, and to
He wasn’t sure how long they lay there, trying to find breath for words and then for something to say that wouldn’t ruin this.  It seemed almost too fragile to let words into it, like the whole thing would shatter if they spoke.  Maybe it would.
The underlying musk that Tony’s hindbrain recognized as quinetessentially Steve.
He could feel Tony harden under the steady rhythm of his hand, and quickened his pace, tracing a thumb over the sensitive head the way Tony had done to him with his tongue. He nudged closer to Tony, his own cock dripping now, standing upright against his belly, so hard he could barely think of touching it, yet wanting nothing else but to feel the familiar warm tightness of Tony’s body around him.  He slowed his hand, hearing a muttered curse from Tony that quickly turned into a stuttering groan as Steve pressed the palm of his hand to the place at the underside of Tony’s cock where his balls hung, full and tight.
“Wait! Don’t lea--” Steve shouted, jerking open the door in his rush to get out and nearly slamming his chest into the man, who was leaning with one arm nonchalantly braced against the side of the door.
“I will miss you, Tony,” Steve said, surprising himself with the admission, though he found he meant it, as strange as it felt to admit. The interruption must have surprised the King as well, because his expression faltered for a moment, eyes going wide, lips working soundlessly, before a practiced smirk took its usual place.
“But,” Steve said with a sigh that was both weary and exasperated.  “Wars are won by soldiers.”
“Good morning,” Steve said with a slight smile. He reached over to the tray and took the carafe of coffee, then poured the brew into the mug and handed it to Tony. Tony took a long drink, then put the mug back on the tray, sitting up slightly in the bed. There was a small, fond smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, like he was trying to keep from grinning and not quite managing. Steve took some of the food off the plate and offered it to Tony, who obediently opened his mouth to take it from Steve’s hand. Tony ate slowly, his eyes roaming possessively over Steve’s body while he chewed.
“Wh—what?” Tony stuttered, staring at Coulson.  “The President?  The President-President?  Of the United States.  Of America. The country.
His room was dark and spare, same as always, but tonight, he pulled the sketch out of his drawer, grabbed his charcoals and set to work, which managed to occupy him until sometime after midnight. Putting the drawing back in the drawer--he still wasn’t sure what he would do with it, it wasn’t really that good, but, he was drawing it for Tony or
, Tony smiled down at his phone, then switched over to the app and activated Covi’s motors. The drone whirred into the air and Steve’s face filled the camera again.  He was smiling now, wide and happy, his phone cradled in one hand.
“Matt?” Tony questioned.  Who the hell was Matt?  Not that it was his business.  But, who the hell was Matt?
“Hmmm,” Steve said against his stomach, the vibration thrumming through him.  “You feel better now?”
We’ve been so far apart, for so long, Tony thought.    Parallel lives that never managed to find each other.  He’d meant it as a terrible and obvious pun, then, of course, but now…now, he just wanted a connection.  A moment in time when they did intersect, in all the ways that truly mattered.  The lines didn’t start out at the meeting point, though.  They had to build, to grow, to work their way to that moment of connection.  They had to earn it.
Their mouths met again, more insistent this time.  Steve could feel the hard thickness of Tony’s cock pressing between them, and suddenly, he wanted more.  Reaching down between them, he grasped his own cock in his hand and brought it flush with Tony’s, cupping them both together.
That was unfair, he knew. She wouldn't do that in a million years. She'd be understanding and sympathetic and outraged on his behalf, and he could handle anything except someone being kind right now.
They were swaying together well enough, slowly at first, then more surely, Tony’s feet finding the steps from memory and Steve either figuring it out from Tony’s movements or his mind dredging up enough to get his body to remember.  Tony wasn’t even sure when the song stopped exactly, the realization that the room had gone quiet and they were just standing there coming in a crash out of nowhere, like waking up and finding himself wrapped in Steve’s arms, and that was not something he needed to be thinking about right now.  Not when he was this close and Steve was looking down at him like that, like Tony was answering a question he hadn’t known to ask.
Handsome or not, nobleman or not, he was clearly just a man.  Steve wondered why he had thought there was anything different about the man, though he supposed his own terror probably made the man seem more frightening than he really was, the way sometimes he and Bucky would tell stories to scare each other and then, that night, the shadows in his room would seem deeper than they had been before.
“Almost here, Boss,” Happy called from the driver’s seat.
“You are here for the King’s pleasure.  Nothing else.  I trust you will remember that.  The King has no interest in the…trivial matters of my position,” Zola said in a low voice.  “If the King is happy, then I am, of course, happy.  And if he is not, for some…
“I need to call Pepper and Rhodey.  Get the Board gathered for an emergency meeting.  Have JARVIS start analyzing records, see what he can find,” Tony said, though he made no move to dislodge himself from Steve’s embrace.
Underneath the check was the small drawing he had begun of the Grand Canyon.  He never finished it, but he thought there was something appropriate about that.  They were, each of them and together, a work in progress.  Maybe everyone was.  Maybe that was the point.
Steve sighed and went to sit down on the soft blue sheet Tony had spread out in the middle of their bedroom.  He twisted around and picked up the round pillow done in the design of his shield and held it in his lap, then picked up the small Iron Man plushie and the familiarly-masked teddy bear, giving Tony a long-suffering look.  Steve held up the bear in one hand and the Iron Man in the other in front of him, bouncing the Bucky-bear slightly.
“You shouldn’t be here,” Steve reminded him, the words coming out sharper than he meant them to be.  As he did, he could see something flicker across Tony’s face before he looked away.  It was the same calculating, assessing look he’d seen aimed at him over a woodpile, and he liked it even less now.
He pulled back and looked down at Anto for a long moment.  It was still strange to Anto how much the Others seemed to look at each other.  For Clan, it was rude for Omega to look at Alpha like this, but Steve seemed to like to look at him, and Anto liked looking at Steve, so he thought, maybe it would be okay, though only with Steve, he thought.   He dropped his eyes to Steve’s chest, only to have Steve lift his chin up with the curve of his hand. He blinked up at Steve, watching Steve’s dark eyes as they seemed to search his face. He felt Steve’s hand leave his chin to cradle the back of his head, fingers massaging at the base of his neck until Anto shivered.
“Can’t you just tell her about the car?” Tony whined.  “Well, not about what happened to the car.  He’s going to get me another one.  In red. God, she’d hate that, wouldn’t she?  Call it garish.  I know, I know, a car is not jewelry.  Damn, what’s her hang up with home shopping network, anyway?  It’s—well, it
“Can I—I want the uh. The same person. As last time. If he’s available,” Steve said.
. Keep it hidden. Don’t tell. Don’t talk about, not ever, because if they know, if they know, it will be bad, wrong-bad, and they would know. They would know about him, and they would look at him the way his mother did, with her pinched face, sadness and horror and shame warring with guilt and usually losing. Winner gets a bottle of chardonnay, he thought, the memory, old as it was, still able to sting. She’d loved him, true, but she’d hated herself more, and that was something he could never forgive. He’d needed her, at least, to love him enough to lie to him.
God, how had he gotten himself into this mess?  Well, probably best not to answer that, he thought grimly.  Dinner.  Smile.  Pretend to be dopey in love with the stripper for a few days.  Bring down Obie, Stern and Pierce.  Write said stripper a fat check.  Wash, rinse, repeat. Everyone gets what they want. No one gets hurt.  What could possibly go wrong, Tony admonished himself somewhat sardonically.  He knew how tenuous this whole thing was.   Hell, Vegas was the perfect place to build a house of cards, and why not throw in a little faux nuptial bliss while he was at it?  He could handle that.  He’d spent most of his life, and certainly all of his relationships, pretending, so why not?  Putting the proverbial ring on it shouldn’t make that much of a difference.
“People do some weird things,” Cam replied, drawing out the last two words, then letting out a low whistle.  “Lena said she heard one of the girls say Lord Stern likes them to pee on him.”
“Steve, hon, you tear all the bedding you want.  Hell, we’ll all go as the happiest mummies on the planet next Halloween,” Tony assured him.  Tony stretched his body across Steve’s and reached into the nightstand drawer, grabbing the tube and tossing it on the bed.
Everything would be exactly fine.
“Yeah,” Steve said, mouth flattening as Brock looked over at him. “Crazy.”
Steve sat him down gently in the belly of the helicopter on a jacket someone had laid out on the bottom, tore open a plastic package and pulled out one of those thermal blankets to wrap around Tony’s shoulders.  Rhodey hopped into the helicopter next to Tony, and he could hear the scraping whir of the blades start to rotate above them.  Someone in a dust-colored helmet with a cross on it was pushing up his sleeve and tapping at the veins there.
This was it, Tony realized with a stuttering grind of thoughts. They were going to shake hands and go their merry ways, and everything would settle back into place. His whole life would re-slot itself along the same track he'd been on, with nothing but the loss of a few days' productivity to show for apparently being married to Steve for a decade. It seemed so wrong, that this could recede without leaving a visible mark on his life, the way it had scored across his life the first time. He should be glad for it, but he couldn't quite manage to wrap his head around the dissonance to get there.
“He gave his blessing,” Steve said, though the words came out flat.
Steve shot him a questioning, disgruntled look, but started down the steps again, his backpack slung over one shoulder. Tony followed just behind him, which earned him another look, but Steve was being decidedly uncommunicative, which, for Steve, meant communicating everything with body language that was currently trying to shake Tony loose like he'd asked if Steve knew his Lord and Savior.
“You’re…” Steve began, then broke off, taking a deep, steadying breath and shaking his head.  His heart thudded in his chest so loudly it was like a drumbeat filling the space between them. He pressed his hand against his chest as if he could cease the traitorous beat, but it only seemed to grow louder, filling the room. Tony--or whoever he was--could surely hear it.
“I’d love to see the final product,” he said.
“What--what are you doing here?” Steve stammered.
Any minute now.
“What?  No!” Tony said, sitting up abruptly.  “Your mom makes me caramel apple pie with the fancy crusts cut into equations.  Don’t take away my math pie.”
“This one time…” Steve started after an awkward, expectant silence when it seemed there was nothing to say and too much to say at the same time.  “This one time, one of our convoy trucks shot at us.  Not the soldiers in it shooting at us, like friendly fire or something. The truck,” Steve explained, seemingly out of nowhere.  “The truck shot at us.”
“Anything of interest out there?” Steve asked.
“Hope.  Hope that we can be better. That all of this, everything he does, every sacrifice he makes that chips away at him, that it can all be worth it one day. That he can better.  Sometimes, he’ll hate you for it. He loves and loathes your faith in him. I think I probably do, too, to tell you the truth,” Rhodes paused, looking over at Steve as they walked down a set of steep steps where the corridor branched off to both sides at the bottom.  Rhodes reached into his tunic and pulled out a small bag, then dumped the contents into his hand, nothing more than a few spare coins.  He plucked one from his palm and held it up.  “See this?  The Royal Crest and Creed.  Means it is official coin of the Crown, backed up by the Treasury.  It holds its value anywhere in the world.”
.  Pretty good business model, if you ask me.  Anyway, the coins already had our regiment on them, along with the Sutler’s name, so you’d know where you could spend them, and so, sometimes...it was a thing to do to get your name engraved on them.  Sew them into your clothes. You know. In case.”
But, it was never enough.  He would think it was, hope it was, feel like it was, and then there would be some little remark, something casual, something just in the middle of ten other things, like it was nothing, and it would just gut him.   It would feel like all the progress he had been standing on suddenly got swept out from underneath him with that one, little dig.
He looked around again.  This place had the habit of not being exactly what it appeared to be at first glance, Steve thought.  Perhaps that was true in here, too.  Could someone be hiding? Much of the room was cast in shadow. The only light came from the grayish sliver that peeked in from behind thick curtains that appeared to be hiding a balcony and an eight-pointed candelabra sitting atop a long table.  Still, Steve could make out enough of it to know that someone certainly lived here. Someone...very different, Steve realized as he tried to take in his surroundings.  It was almost overwhelming, the sheer amount of--of stuff that was in the room. Steve didn’t think he had ever seen quite such an accumulation.
“Yeah, guess so,” Steve replied, staring down at his phone.  He glanced up at Brock and paused, letting the silence hang there for a beat.  For a second, Steve thought Brock was going to say something.  Tell him not to go. That this was a mistake.  He didn’t, and of course, Steve didn’t really expect him to, since they would be crazy not to do this. It would be stupid to be disappointed.
Probably best not to think about Steve and his appetites, though, Tony thought.  All things considered.  Or, all things we definitely weren’t considering, no Siree.
“Vestigus argues that valor is superior to numbers,” Tony said as he rolled a small metal cylinder against a hot iron that was clamped between two pincers atop his worktable.  “You’re this close to rolling your eyes, aren’t you?”
“I—I shouldn’t do this,” Steve said.
that would feel.  Tony wet his lips.  A line of slick seeped out of him, dripping down between his thighs.  He wondered if Steve would be able to smell it when he got home. Tony liked to think he would.  That Steve would come home and find the air thick with Tony’s arousal and know how much Tony needed him.  A few strokes, just a few, and he could take the edge off. Who knew how long it would actually take Steve to get home?  Traffic.  One of Coulson’s precious forms.  Cat up a tree.  You never knew. Anything could delay him.
Happy nodded in their direction, and tapped the breast pocket of his own coat and leaned conspiratorially in Steve’s direction.  “See? These guys are the real deal. That’s why I tell Mr. Stark this is the place to stay when we’re in Vegas.”
“I don’t think that means what you think it means,” Steve replied, taking one of the bench seats and maneuvering his backpack to his lap so Tony could take the seat next to him.  He pulled the Yoo-hoo out of the bag, unzipped his backpack, and took out a blue lunchbox with S. Rogers written across the top in black sharpie.  It was so wonderfully Steve, that Tony wanted to grab it and clutch it to his chest.  If he opened it up, it would have all of Steve’s lunch items carefully separated into baggies or containers, all probably labeled with S. Rogers.
Who’s pretending now, Steve scoffed at himself, and, later, he wanted to think he would have been able to stop, end it there, a quick kiss for the cameras, and that was all, except Tony groaned into the well of Steve’s mouth, and turned, angling his head against Steve’s and flicking his tongue over the seam of Steve’s lips.   Everything he had just told himself, every plan, every certainty, whisked away in that fraction of a moment, and he was drowning, in so far over his head, he couldn’t see the surface.  Tony’s mouth was pushing against his, tongue tracing Steve’s lips, then delving inside, deepening the kiss.  Steve’s hand had gone to Tony’s waist, twisting him, until Tony’s back was pressed against the glass, and Steve’s other hand intertwined with Tony’s fingers, trapped against the window above their heads.
Steve re-adjusted his grip on the shield, flexing his fingers around the straps once more, looking up at Tony from under his lashes.  Tony’s eyes were bright, gleaming in the afternoon sun that streamed through the tall windows, and his mouth was open, his breathing hard and fast.  The hand on Steve’s jaw spasmed, clutching hard for a moment, hard enough to bruise, maybe, Steve thought, and felt a rush of pressure that traced a path of fire down his cock.
?  Had his thoughts ever been fully his own?
“It’s okay, Tony.  Say your piece, James.  You’ve been itching to since we talked on the phone, so go ahead,” Steve said with an air of resignation.  His shoulders were squared, taut like he was waiting for impact.  Maybe he was, Tony realized.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I know that, Jarvis,” Tony responded.
Steve waited, looking around, but Shellhead wasn’t deigning to make an appearance this morning.
I’m being good and still, his mind hummed.
“Yes,” Steve replied firmly.  “Very much.”
“That so?” Tony mused, clearly trying to contain a smile.  He threaded his fingers through Steve’s hair, leaving the wet, spiky ends sticking up in points, then leaned over and pressed a kiss to Steve’s forehead.  “Sleep,” Tony said softly.  “You need to rest.”
Steve’s hands ran up and down Tony’s sides, over the curve of his ass and over the garters, then back up, sliding over the slip to tease Tony’s nipples, rubbing and pulling at the sensitive buds through the lace. Tony gave a long, keening moan. It was somehow better and worse, the way the lace felt on his nipples, soft and rough at the same time, like his mind couldn’t decide which sensation to feel.  His cock was painfully hard, throbbing and leaking with each tug or twist of his nipples, like there was a pathway between the two for pulses of pleasure to travel back and forth.
“Any particular reason why?” Steve asked.
“I’m on hold,” Steve said to Brock. Almost as if the universe had been waiting for him to say that, as soon as the words were out of his mouth, a woman’s voice came on the line.
The traffic waned when they exited off the freeway.  The road slowly elevated, carving steeper and deeper cuts through slashes of rock that rose steadily higher as they drove.  They were both quiet, lost in their own thoughts, but it was a gentle, companionable kind of silence.  The absence of talking, not the absence of anything to say.
“No, no, not---not like that.  I mean,” Tony broke off, sucking in a shaky breath and twisting in his seat to look at Steve.  “I’m not—I’m not saying this right.  Everyone there, everyone, was part of this roadshow thing.  Me, Rhodey, the generals out there toasting our partnership.  None of it was real, until it was. Way, way too real.  Not much in my life had been particularly real up to that point.  So, I was sitting there, with my arm in a sling and Rhodey playing nurse in the non-fun way, and I thought about that.  What you said.  And I kind of hated you in that moment, a little, I think.  Looking down your nose at me, all self-righteous and sure of what you were seeing when you looked at me, because I wasn’t that person, except neither of us knew it.  None of what happened was
“Your loyalty to your King is truly humbling,” Tony deadpanned, eyes narrowed on Rhodes.  “But, your audience should know that you have been wrong many times before.
f you don’t do this?” Tony repeated, his voice shocked and mildly appalled.  “Jesus. Wow. You die? Like, literally will die if you don’t--wow. So,” Tony continued shakily, “Shit, that’s...you’d really die if you didn’t, okay, okay, I’m just...I’m thrown here. You’ve thrown me.  Guess you have a pretty good incentive to be good to your mates, huh? Keep them happy, am I right? God, wow, that’s…”
Tony frowned, but tightened the knot into place, then patted his pockets for his phone, which was shoved none too gently into the center of his chest by a well-manicured hand.  Tony put the phone into his pocket, then shook his wrist where his watch hung loosely, reaching his other hand over to tighten the band.  His fingers skated over the clasp, fiddling for a moment with the small catch before it caught.
“You were not on suicide watch,” Steve said, rolling his eyes.  “Phillips was messing with you.”
And then, almost as he thought it, the world around him dropped into a deeper silence.  So deep it startled him into tipping over into a pile on the roadside, his elbow landing sharp on one of the half-unearthed stones that littered the edge of the roadway.  It was more than silent.  The sounds - and he could tell now that there had been many more than he had realized - were simply gone. The absence of sound filled his ears with almost a physical force, a rush of nothingness, like going underwater in the pond over by Bucky’s farmstead, it was a
Tony stood up in one quick motion and walked swiftly away from the table.  He stopped when he reached the living room.  Steve got up, too, not knowing what else to do, and started clearing the dishes.
Steve counted.  He wasn’t sure where the pain stopped and the pleasure began, but it had ceased to matter.  His whole body throbbed.  His chest was heaving with dry, wracking sobs.  His cock pulsed and strained. His balls were sore and full.  His ass was on fire.  None of it mattered.
“I guess,” Tony said, casting a look at in the direction where Steve had disappeared.  It was odd.  Being without Steve.  He hadn’t wanted Steve around, and then he hadn’t had a choice, and now…now, he was spinning in place, trying to figure out which way was up, all because his Alpha had left him.  Pathetic.  Get a grip, he told himself firmly.  It will be fine.  No talking.  No touching.  Just like getting to peek into Howard’s lab, but minus the soliloquy on how much of a disappointment you are.
The bed was still soft and sleep-warm, or maybe that was him, but the idea of moving just yet seemed wildly unappealing.  Moving meant an obligation to eventually get up that he didn’t quite want to make just yet, so he burrowed back under the quilted blanket and pulled it up to cover his head, making the light behind his eyelids darken to something that didn’t demand action.
“Let’s see…” Tony began, adjusting the scope.  “That’s…Virgo.  A bit there, see?” Tony said, shifting over so Steve could lean forward and look though the eyepiece.  “Supposed to look like a woman lying down.  I don’t know. I think the Greeks were drunk or something.  There are over three thousand galaxies just east of her left arm, though.  Here, let me just—“ Tony said, readjusting the scope just a bit so the spiral galaxy near the top of the Virgo Cluster came into view.  “So, kinda cool, I guess.”
“Sorry,” Steve said immediately, though he wasn’t quite sure what he was apologizing for.  He wasn’t intruding, not really, but it
“Fine, fine, we can give him some of it.  And I’ll sing kumbaya with him if he ever comes around again.  Happy?” Brock asked pointedly.
When Concerned Citizen, Beamer Owner and Wire Fan turned to answer a phone call, she looked up from her salad and over to where Steve was putting his credit card back in his wallet.  Her gaze slid over to catch Tony watching her, and for a moment, he could see something slip off her face, and she did look young, for that second.  Young and sad and longing, but then it was gone, and she was smiling at her Alpha again, telling him it was no problem, of course he had to take the call, and no, she couldn’t possibly eat dessert, don’t be ridiculous.
He blinked back the sudden stinging in his eyes and looked up at Steve with an expectant rush of, not excitement, exactly, but hope.  Maybe.  Maybe, hope.  Maybe he could hope.
“Looks like you’re stuck with me, Shellhead,” Steve said, giving the creature a slight smile.  “At least until rescue arrives. Which, based on our current tally of ships sailing past...might be a while.”
“Lies,” Tony said over Rhodey.
Steve sighed and rubbed at the bridge of his nose to loosen the furrowed ridges of his brow.   Tony needed him to do this thing for a few days, keep it professional, keep a respectful distance without getting emotionally involved, like he should be able to do, given what he did for a living, not trail after him like a lost puppy who needed a pat on the head.
Howard’s eyes bulged, whether from terror at Steve’s words or a lack of oxygen, Tony wasn’t sure.  Tony heard a sharp, shocked cry and looked over at the study door where his mother hovered with a hand at her throat, eyes wide, Jarvis just behind her with a similarly stunned expression, though he didn’t exactly pull off appalled with quite the aplomb that Maria mustered.
Well, about Tony’s money, as it turned out.
“I know you’re humoring me,” Tony told him.  “Or, you’re telling yourself that’s what you’re doing, anyway.  Humor me for a few days, and this will all go away.  I’ll come to my senses or whatever.  Jaunt back to my merry life at the Tower.”
A joke, a deflection, a hidden meaning you had to puzzle out, but it was there.
“Well, that’s a first,” Tony said with a snort of disbelief.  “What’d you talk about?”
“Ready for dinner?” Steve asked, hoisting the pizzas.
Dear Lord, Tony was
Tony looked out the door at where Preston’s legs were still visible in the hallway, then over at Ty, then up at Steve.  “How’d you do that?” Tony asked, blinking in confusion.  He tried to stretch out and nudge Ty’s leg with one hand, but the movement caused his stomach to roil in protest again.  “Can we go? I don’t want to throw up on Australia.”
“The show is always so nice over the lake,” Maria remarked.  “Girls, please don’t dive off the end of the dock. It’s actually quite shallow and there are rocks!” she called out.
“Blonsky,” Tony corrected, then grimaced.  Pepper shot him a look.  He clamped his mouth shut and looked down at where his hands gripped the steering wheel.  A blind date?  Seriously? That was…crazy.  He wasn’t lonely or whatever had Pepper in so much of a tizzy she was getting her Emma on.
“Yeah, yeah, it’s all fine,” Steve said.  “Brock, he’s…” he broke off, grimacing.
“I don’t—“ Steve started, looking down at his t-shirt and jeans and mentally cataloguing what options existed in his closet that he could beg Natasha to bring. He had that jacket he’d worn to Bucky’s hearing, but he almost laughed out loud when his mind supplied the mental image of him standing next to Tony Stark in tan corduroy with faux suede patches at the elbows and his one good pair of khakis.
When Steve got down to the lobby and stepped outside, it was immediately apparent which car was waiting for him, even if the black-clad driver hadn’t been waiting next to it, giving anyone who approached the stink-eye.  The sleek, black Bentley looked entirely out of place amongst the Subarus and Kias in the hotel parking lot, though the driver saw him and enthusiastically waved him over, as if Steve might have missed it.
“Always was for me,” Steve remarked, lifting one of Tony’s hands to his mouth, then placing a light kiss against the inside of Tony’s wrist, just below where his watch ticked as the second hand made its way around the undulating surface of the dial, sending a shiver lancing up Tony’s spine.  He had many other watches now, but he always wore this one to the cabin.  The cabin, in a strange way, kept its own time. He turned and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, digging his fingers into the back pockets of Steve’s jeans and giving them a little tug, pulling Steve’s hips flush against his belly.
“Howard, he was just—” Maria started.
“I do not like him.  This Lord Stone,” Nyma said.  “He made Marta cry.”
Peggy’s grip tightened on his arm, and she shot him a questioning look.  Steve realized his whole body had tensed, and tried to force himself to relax, though to little avail.
It had been accidental, maybe, at first, Steve knew.  Like Tony hadn’t been able to quite help himself. But, then, the second time, that was deliberate.  That was banter, wasn’t it?  Flirting? Maybe not flirting.  But...something.  Something
“No,” Steve said, swallowing hard and blinking at Tony, who smiled widely in return and just barely scraped his nails over Steve’s right nipple.
Steve nodded and swallowed thickly, throat bobbing like he was struggling with the effort not to say more, then walked out the door, closing it behind him without another word.
Tony waited, body going rigid, for the inevitable explosion.  Steve was staring at him, the wind brushing his hair over his forehead, but otherwise, he was almost preternaturally still.  Then, his face softened, and his mouth quirked up at the corners, lips flattening like he was trying to hold in a smile.  Which…was annoying, Tony decided.  He was pissed, and Steve was…laughing at him, which might be the only thing worse than yelling at him.  God-damn California DOT and their unkept promises.  Where was a fucking falling rock when you needed one?  He wasn’t sure if he wanted it to put him out of his misery or if he preferred to brain Steve with it.
“Thanks, Ana,” Tony said.
“Christmas present,” Daniel said.  “State of the art. Got its own stand, even, which, if you’re down a leg, kind of helps.”
“You were impaled,” Tony said with something like anger, exhaustion or frustration or all three tipping over into his voice.  Steve still felt a little off, true, but he was hardly an invalid.  He could sit in a conference room and listen to Hill’s mission review.  He tried to say as much to Tony, but when he started with the usual platitude chorus of “I’m fine,” Tony simply stared at him and then turned on his heel and walked out of the medical room, slamming the door just hard enough in his wake to make it noticeably deliberate.
“Eh, it’s really what they expect. Me and some big scandal or whatever, I mean. No offense,” Tony said quickly, holding up a placating hand.  “You do know that the literal last thing I am is ashamed to be with you, don’t you? Tell me you know that.”
Steve tried to ignore DUM-E for a moment, but the little robot just nudged him again, so he sighed in resignation and bent to take whatever it was from DUM-E’s claw, intending to throw it to the other side of the workshop so he’d have a chance to finish his talk with Tony while the bot searched for his toy. As he took the wad from DUM-E, he happened to look askance at Tony, only to find the other man staring at him with what could only be described as wide-eyed horror.  Steve started to ask what the matter was when he looked at the paper in his hand and caught the familiar red, white and blue color scheme.  He frowned, starting to peel the paper apart and spread it out, and sure enough, there was his poster, the one from marketing, and he tried not to be hurt by this, that Tony had destroyed it like this, using it as some kind of wastepaper toy for his bots, because really, it was just a mock-up, there would be thousands more, so it wasn’t like it was special or anything.  It was just…well, thinking about his careful sketches of Tony and what those had meant to him, what he’d been trying to convey with them, wanting the world to see Tony and not just Iron Man…yeah, it hurt that Tony hadn’t thought of his poster as anything but trash.  It was even a bit sticky in places and covered with the splatter of something caked on it, and he couldn’t pretend that didn’t sting just a---wait.
“Good.  Was there something I can help you with?” she asked.
“You called Steve,” Tony reminded him.  “There was yelling.  I heard. Like a reasonable person, I called Coulson.  He was very helpful.”
“Sure, sure!  That would be fantastic.  A Tony Stark poster drawn by Captain America?  We’ll advertise it as a collectible, limited edition or something,” Deirdre was already off, tapping away on her tablet, probably ordering another hundred thousand Hulk diving masks* or something equally disturbing.
“So, ah, this is DUM-E,” Tony announced, patting a hand on the bulkier robot, who whirred to life and twirled his pincer in greeting.  “And this one is U,” he said, pointing to the slightly more streamlined version who was currently attempting to dry-hump Steve’s leg.  U craned his claw in Steve’s direction, tilted it at an angle and opened the pincer’s wide, in what Tony would have called a smile in his head, if he did things like that.
“Holding things together about as well as you can imagine,” Stane replied, looking down for a moment in what Steve could place as a practiced bit of gruff sorrow.  “Place isn’t the same without Howard around, I’ll tell you that. The market’s been brutal on us,” Stane added, glancing around. “But, with the new product we have in the pipeline, I think the company’ll pull through.  Haven’t been this excited about a launch in years, to tell you the truth.”
He stopped then, slamming into some invisible wall that suddenly filled the space in front of him.  Tony stared, and yeah, he knew he was staring and it was rude as hell, but it hit him then, like a lock clicking into place as he took in Steve standing there in the flashy new suit Pepper had conjured for him.
Martinez hand surgeon New York.
“Hey there, Scrapheap.  Say hi to Steve,” Tony mumbled, flinging a hand wide and nearly hitting Steve in the nose. Steve caught his wrist and pressed Tony’s arm back in to his chest as DUM-E whirred and beeped excitedly.  The bot had always had a soft spot for Steve.  “Traitor,” Tony snorted gamely.  “No more upgrades for you.”  The bot’s crane arm drooped and his pincers spun, then pointed downwards.  “Maybe one more upgrade,” Tony called out as Steve carried him through the bathroom door and flicked on the light.  DUM-E’s claws spun happily, and he rolled in a circle in his corner until he hit the wall.  Stupid bot, Tony thought fondly.
“Here. Please,” Tony said, indicating the chair.  Steve nodded jerkily and strode across the room, finding himself sitting where Tony pointed and reaching for the plate of food without quite knowing how he made the decision to acquiesce.
them. Maybe not use them and think of Steve, not really, which was stupid anyway, because who wanted to be thought of when someone put on socks?
,” Howard grated out.  “God, why can’t you just, for once, do what you’re told?  Huh?  This is my work.
“Hi Anthony, I’m Steve.”  Too casual. Overly familiar. Presumed too much. They hadn’t even been officially introduced.
“Steve. These hopes and dreams…this future you credit me with seeing…who do you think fills those?” Tony asked quietly, rasping around the words and making Steve think of stone against steel, honing an edge to the kind of sharpness that makes men bleed. “They are yours already. We are not life and death, as if those are two separate things to be parsed. As if you can have one without the other. They are the same loop of thread. That is us, Steve. What is life without love? What is death without hope? Only through one can the other have any meaning. You think I want you to be something you are not, but that is who you have been trying to be the past few months, someone you think I want, not who you are, and it is tearing you apart,” Tony said gently, bringing a hand up to cup Steve’s jaw, thumb stroking lightly along the curve of bone there. “I see it. And it kills me, and I don’t know what to do to make you see that I would have you, just as you are. Not a perfect prince, but a good man. A soldier, who wields a shield. You think you seek the fight? The win? You have only ever sought to protect those who stood in the way of powerful people who would use fear and cruelty to abuse that position because they could. If that is death, it is one born of sacrifice. And what is that if not hope?”
“Huh,” Howard ground out, breath wheezing out a raspy huff.  “Jarvis let you use his name and social to register?  Wait.  Don’t answer that.  I’d hate to have to fire the best butler we’ve had.  Always had a soft spot for you, and we both know, that isn’t what you need.  Is it, Tony?  Come on.  You can whine and pout and put on a show of it all you want, but in the end, you want this.  You know you do.  If you need me to be the one to play the bad guy, fine.  Tell yourself I’m the black hat here, if it helps whatever goes on in that head of yours.  But, between us, let’s not pretend.  Not anymore.  Haven’t we done that enough over the years?  You are what you are, and you need this, even if you don’t want to admit it.  This is the best thing for you.”
His mouth trailed lower, down Steve’s throat beyond the collar, nipping and sucking at the skin where it stretched down to Steve’s shoulder.  There would be a mark there, too, Steve thought dazedly, as his back arched to reach more of the wet heat of Tony’s mouth.  Tony’s head dipped lower, to the hollow of Steve’s throat, then lower still, down the breastbone to the fold of skin where Steve’s muscles were stretched across his chest by the position of the chains.  Another puff of warm breath over his wet skin as Tony chuckled, and Steve realized his hips were canting up and down, trying to find some kind of friction that Tony refused to provide.
An almost overwhelming urge to stomp back inside and tell Brock about the money right then and there welled up inside him.  He resisted the temptation by a fraction, and headed down the stairs, shoving his arms into his jacket as he went.
“I--I know,” Steve breathed out, feeling worn and empty inside, where just a moment ago, it had been almost too much feeling to bear all at once.  “I know you don’t believe me, and I...I’m trying to be better about understanding why, but that means you talk to me about it, except because of it, you don’t want to talk to me, and so I’m...aiming to convince you, I guess.”
He looked down at the top of the table where the reflection of the lights above blotted out his own.  Better not mention the thing with the toaster, he thought. The words had a wild, slanted feel to them.  He had the strange sensation that he was disappearing. There was a fancy word for it now that the doctor had told him one day when she’d asked if he felt more himself when he was in the uniform.  He’d laughed and said that was who he was, and her little diver had bubbled some more, and Steve remembered the way the uniform clung to his frozen skin so badly they’d had to slowly heat him up while he lay there on the table until they could peel it off, like the ice didn’t want to let him go.
“I play a mean game of UNO,” Steve replied placidly. Tony watched Stewart’s expression falter then recover, enjoying it far too much because this wonderful obnoxious streak that Steve hid behind being an all-around decent kind of guy liked to rear its head at the best of times.  “I’ll just watch tonight though,” Steve assured their host.
“Wow!  Really?  MIT?” Steve parroted in surprise.
“I like that. You should always taste like me,” Tony whispered, eyes soft and slack.  He tilted his head to the side, eyes narrowing to shrewdness as he regarded Steve.  “Can you be still for me a bit longer?” Tony asked.  Steve nodded.  Or thought he did.  He wasn’t sure.  It seemed to be good enough for Tony.  Tony gestured then, looking over his shoulder at one of the guards, who walked silently over to the bedside table and then over to Tony, where he deposited the pot of warm oil on the table next to Tony’s chair.
So, really, not much had changed since The Event.
The man moved between Tony and Obie then, walking forward so that Obie had to fall back or end up slamming into him.  They were almost of a height, the two of them, but Obie was no soldier and this man, he seemed to have been made for war.  He was speaking again, low and hard in clipped, quick, unrecognizable words, his brows drawn into a deep frown.  He stopped once he had Obie backed nearly to the tent wall and jerked his head towards the flap where it swayed in the wind, then crossed his arms over his chest and planted his feet apart.  The posture somehow managed to make him look bigger and nearly completely block Obie from Tony’s view.
He let go of the door, put his bag down on the sofa and walked over to the kitchen sink. There was a vase of flowers next to the sink, dark pink blooms with delicate, spotted petals reaching out.  Stargazer lilies.  There were always stargazer lilies, everywhere they went.  Tony sucked in a breath, catching the familiar sweet, floral scent.
It wasn’t his concern. Some strange Omega he’d seen a picture of in a stack of files…the boy’s fate wasn’t in Steve’s hands.  It belonged to his parents, who would surely find a suitable match for him.  Someone who would take care of him, the way he should be cared for, not someone who could barely manage to get through a day without retreating to some half-baked fantasy life.  It wasn’t his concern.  It
“I would like that,” Steve finally settled on.  He thought it might even be true.
Steve closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the thin, flat pillow as the cell door clanged shut.  The guard, Hoskins, Steve’s mind supplied, tapped on one of the bars with his nightstick.  “Lights out in twenty, boys,” Hoskins muttered, then shuffled off, keys jingling against his belt.  It was a sound that was supposed to signal going somewhere, metal rattling against metal when Bucky dug them out of his pocket and held them up in invitation, but now, hell, probably for the rest of his life, it would mean something being taken away.
“I believe you were perfectly clear,” Tony replied, pushing himself off the worktable and finding his chair.  He plucked his goblet up, took a long drink, then leaned back and regarded Steve from over the rim, waving it in the air in front of his face with a disingenuous smile.  “But, by all means.  As you stand there in adornments I have given you, enlighten me all the more about how eager you are for someone to take your place after I have played the fool for the whole Court and city to see.  Please.  Go ahead,” he continued, lifting the goblet in a mock salute.  “Believe me, you have my full attention.”
“Don’t we?  Not directly, I know, but, putting aside our lobbying efforts, and I get that’s part of the way this works, but, we make it so much easier, Obie,” Tony argued.  “You know we do. So much easier for them to send our men and women—people like Steve—on a damn fool’s errand, and nothing happens to change it.  Nothing.  We’re part of a system that has zero accountability.  I’ve been…struggling with this for, well, a long time.  Since before you and I first talked, I guess.  Its more than just profit and stock options, Obie.  We have an obligation to do the highest good for this country.  I think we can do better.  I
The limo cut through traffic and took the exit off the main highway, making Tony’s stomach jerk along with it. He hadn’t eaten much since the cadre at the mansion night before last, and there was a sour, queasy feel to his stomach that left him vaguely lightheaded.  His mother had told him he looked thinner, which apparently meant the same as good.
“What are you even doing here, Tony?” Steve asked, too tired to muster much in the way of surprise.  He turned in his chair just enough to see Tony leaning against the doorway, wearing one of those strange t-shirts that always left Steve at a loss as to whether they were meant to be ironic or just some other kind of armor he didn’t understand.
“We’ll be there in a bit, JARVIS,” Steve replied.  “Tony? Tony, we have to go to this.  And you have the intern banquet to attend.  You promised Pepper, remember?”
“Yeah,” Steve admitted.  Well, they were back to him being the one making an idiot out of himself.  That took all of ten seconds.  Could be a personal best, he though drolly.  He rubbed his hands up and down over his thighs, smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles in the suit, wishing he had something better to do with his hands.   Mercedes-Pullman limousine.  Rolls Royce Phantom, his mind supplied.  He would have to write those down later.  “Sorry about that.   I know what Ms. Potts said about not saying anything.  I just—I thought if we gave them something, I don’t know.  Maybe it would help.  With this…whole thing,” Steve rushed out in one long breath.
Steve stretched out on the sofa as best he could.  He knew that tomorrow he was going to have to face the music with Ms. Romanov. He’d abandoned the client he had been assigned and gone off with some random guy he met all because the guy had asked nicely.
“It was not a criticism, my treasure,” Tony said, his tone gentling, bringing Steve’s eyes to his face as he raised their intertwined hands and brushed a kiss across Steve’s knuckles.  “It is just that I…I think your happiness would be breathtaking to behold.  I would wish to truly see it.”
There was a certain safety in being jealous of ghosts, Tony supposed. It was cruel, perhaps, the kind of thing you thought, but would never say out loud, as if speaking it made it worse, somehow more true for the saying of it than just thinking it. Almost from the beginning, it had been there, though, in the back of his mind, slithering itself around his thoughts and telling him it didn’t matter, not now. Whoever it had been, they were relegated to the unreachable province of Steve’s past, unable to intrude on what was left for Tony.
“Oh, yeah,” Steve huffed out, standing up and rubbing at the back of his head with a hand. “Figured you'd like that. Maybe let the name thing slide.” He was holding the composition notebook in his hand, the one with the list of payments and dates, and Tony wasn't going to touch that thing for anything under the sun.
“I might have suggested a barbeque.  Stop!” Tony said quickly when Rhodey raised his head.  “I know. It’s February. In New York.  I—seriously, I have a calendar and a map program.  Steve said yes, so shut it.  Speaking of my dearly beloved, I gotta leave in a bit to go meet him.  Thanks for the bus pass, by the way,” he added with a nod at Pepper.
be true.
Tony made a dubious noise, then moved to seat himself between Steve’s legs, though instead of doing anything Steve expected, just leaned over and nuzzled at Steve’s stomach, breathing in deeply.  He placed quick, featherlight kisses down the sparse trail of hair leading to Steve’s cock, then a lingering kiss just at the base before taking Steve’s cock in hand.  His hand was slick with lube, which Steve figured was a trick worthy of one of the Strip’s magician acts, but he didn’t question it.  A few firm strokes, Tony’s firm fingers pressing just under Steve’s balls, Steve was back to writhing fitfully on the bed and making obscene noises that he probably would have been embarrassed about if he still possessed the wherewithal to think clearly.  Or care.  He was fairly sure his toes actually curled.
“He is a good man.  General Rhodes,” Steve said, feeling his stomach go cold.  He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, breathed out, and looked down at Tony.  His throat worked, but no sound came out.
Steve had asked himself too many times the last few months if telling Tony would make it better or worse, if it would help or hurt, and he was pretty sure he was asking a question that didn’t have an answer so he wouldn’t have to answer it.
He reached out and straightened the fork again where it sat on one of the cloth napkins by his plate. It still didn't look right, not the way Jarvis always had things, anyway. He tried shifting the salt and pepper shakers to a more centered position on the table, then moved them back, then to the side.
“I feel better already,” Steve acknowledged, but his voice sounded a bit less tight and drawn, so Tony counted it as a win.   “You figure out the door lock yet?”
Tony was riding up front with Rhodey and several peers who had joined their caravan for some part of the journey, all seeking a moment’s audience, which relegated Steve back to his carriage with Cam.  As they passed one of the larger quarries, where huge pieces of stone the size of small buildings were being sliced from the sides, he could see a number of workers. Freemen and women with the surnames Mason, Miner, Smith, Cutter, and, of course, Stone, including the rather recently-ascendant Lord Stone, not that Tony would speak of him.  And slaves. Hundreds of them just at this one place, wearing simple metal collars with a white stone embedded where Steve’s golden one held a ruby. They were old and young, some with wrinkled, leathery skin who sat on the rocky ground and hammered stone, others as young as Cam or younger, Steve thought, who loaded wagons and poured water over stone where the cutters worked it.  The Lord of the Ridge’s massive wealth bought nearly limitless labor, which made him richer and richer, and each of them more and more disposable. It was backbreaking work. The sun beat down hot and hard, with no shade and little respite. They stopped their labors long enough to watch the King pass. Steve wasn’t sure if it was curiosity, respect or just a chance to stop without fear of reprisal, even for a moment.
“Oh, this is not going to go well,” Rhodey said, low and under his breath.
He ran a hand through his hair as he took in his reflection in the mirror, then straightened. It wasn’t really all that different from putting on his outfit for the club, slipping into a different skin for the night. When he looked again, he could see less of himself, like he had faded somehow, and he supposed that meant he was ready.
Shadows danced across the floor where the firelight spilled out of the workroom.  Torches glowed along the walls and candles dripped in the chandelier that hung above, but the large glow came from the fireplace, where Tony stood in a soot-stained tunic with the sleeves cut off nearly to his shoulders and dark breeches, stoking a flat piece of metal in the flames.
The room was dark, but, he noticed, as his eyes adjusted, there was a sliver of light shining from under the bathroom door.   The shadow of feet cut through it, making it move and ripple.  Tony heard a clattering sound that made him think of dropping screws, followed by Steve’s muffled curse.  He set the tablet that was still balanced on his knee on top of the small glass coffee table, got up and walked the few steps to the bathroom door.  Tony knocked lightly with the backs of his knuckles, letting the sound hang there for a moment before he spoke.
Steve felt Tony’s fingers dig through his hair, lathering it up with whatever had been in the bag Rhodes had given him. It felt amazing, sending shivers tingling down his back.  When Tony finished his ministrations, Steve ducked his head under the water again, then came up, shaking it off and running his hands over his face.
It was his first visit with Tony during the day, and he wasn’t entirely sure what they’d be doing.  Spending all day in bed seemed a little overly optimistic, given what little he knew about Tony’s heart condition, though he wouldn’t mind if Tony just wanted to—
“Thanks.  Hey, we’re in the Rolls, so,” Tony told her, gaze darting over to Steve for a flash of a second.
“Tell us what to do,” Natasha replied, as calm as any of them, though her voice quavered, and maybe it was that, the fissure in her armor that broke through whatever it was clawing itself around Tony like a vice, holding him in place, holding him together, keeping what he was seeing at some kind of distance that his mind could allow.  “Bruce.  You have to tell us what to do here.”
Steve advanced towards the line of men, the shield held in front of him, and studied the men.  Some larger than him, some smaller.  One a near behemoth, he noticed.  He turned towards Tony.
“Which I can tell went over well,” Steve smirked and ducked his head again to hunch over his sketchpad.
“This is crazy,” Tony said to no one in particular. He looked towards the window, where it opened onto the bright dot that wasn’t his sun, flanked by round shapes in the distance that orbited it.  “Why the hell not, right? What have I got to lose. Fine. Red pill me, Morpheus, let’s go.” He set the helmet down and laid back on the table, staring up at the ceiling. “Well. Come on. Let’s do this. My body is ready,” he urged, deadpan, when the alien didn’t move.  “So, this gift going to hurt or are you going to--oh, okay, magic finger time, got it. You should really warn a guy before you finger him, you know. I mean, rule to live by, but, oh. Oh, wow.”
He should send this to Tony.
“Hey, you don’t get the other twenty if you leave!” Hammer called out to her retreating back, then looked around, clearing his throat and making an attempt to straighten his jacket.  “Just a joke, folks, just a joke. Come on, can someone just...at least just, okay, move would you? Fine, just move, that’s it, there you go.”
“Margaret Carter.  Peggy to her friends. She was a code-breaker at Bletchley Park.  Started with SSR way back during World War II,” Coulson told him.  “Then, after the war ended, she helped found SHIELD.”
“You did, huh?”  Tony asked, eyebrow raised.  “About his wide…er.  Tie. Which, I’ve certainly not heard about. Ever.”
Right. Ain’t life grand? Oh, maybe there were others like him, but they sure as hell didn’t talk about it. Not exactly a twelve-step program or Facebook group. Who the fuck in their right mind would admit this?
Steve tore his mouth away, Tony chasing it with his own, and moved back as suddenly as he’d begun, hands flailing in front of him, crossing, then uncrossing, as if he didn’t know what to do with them.  When he finally looked at Tony, it was a look Tony had seen before, on a video with Steve holding a bag with a take-out hamburger with no pickles Tony wouldn’t remember to eat because no one was there to poke at him until he did.
“Yeah, yeah.  I can work with the whole romance angle with Steve,” Barnes said, rubbing at his jaw with his good hand.  “What else?  Let’s see.  Oh, you gotta make a big deal about the damn vases.  He’s not going to say it, he’s gonna pretend he doesn’t care, but he likes it when you get all weird about his art.  He can’t draw so good now—fine motor skills are shit with his hand--but he’s doing this program for veterans that Sam got him into.  Glass-blowing.  Helps with his hand, something about the movements and coordination, and, I don’t know, supposed to be this transformative thing.  The glass. Help veterans process trauma or some shit.  He’s terrible at it, but he tries.  So, notice the vases.  Do not make fun of the vases.  By, like, calling them bowls.”
“Incorrigible,” he accused.
“Yeah.  Yeah, always creative,” Howard acknowledged slowly in a flat, grim tone, as if he had the word stuck on his shoe and was trying to pick it clean.
“Sent,” Rhodey said a moment later.
Steve had a soldier’s ability to fall asleep most anywhere, but he knew from experience that this was one part of incarceration to which Tony had never quite adjusted.  He said his mind couldn’t shut down when it was so bright, though Steve suspected it was just one on the long list of things that Tony couldn’t control that discomfited the man in some way, like the quirk about being handed things, though apparently Steve had managed to rise to the lofty position of Taker of Things in Tony’s eyes.  Steve wondered briefly how Tony had eaten the past ten days with no one to take his food tray and hand it to him, then tramped down on the urge to ask.
Hey, that graduation thing that got randomly mentioned in there?  If you followed me on tumblr, you'd have already read about it.  But, because I'm nice (and have had wine), here is the link to that post:
The first two events passed by quickly enough.  Stone won the sword melee handily enough. Steve’s fingers itched for his shield, but Tony seemed largely uninterested, which was its own kind of victory.  One of Rand’s knights won the archery competition. Clint would have laughed his fool head off, Steve thought. The final event was the joust. Wine and sweetmeats were passed around, though Steve gave his share of the food to Cam.  Finally, it came down to Stone and one of Tony’s guards tilting at each other across the lists. Stone’s lance broke against the other man’s shield, unseating him on the first pass. On the second, both men went down. The third decided it in Stone’s favor, much to Steve’s disappointment.  His squire rushed out with a fresh lance, and he rode over to the King’s box, tipping his lance down in deference.
“They gonna kill the guy shooting at me?” Jim countered.  Tony nodded, once. “Then I’m using them.”
“People with power they don’t want to give up, let’s call them,” Fury interjected, raising his eyebrows until his forehead furrowed.   “People who don’t want some figurehead in a flag out there stirring the pot because he thought the world would have learned by now.”
Gave was a bit of a kindness, Tony knew. Threw it at Steve's chest and made some derogatory comment about it being a piece of cheap shit anyway was more like it. He'd have to add shooting himself in his own foot to his resume.
“Don’t talk to strangers, I got it,” Bucky cut in.  “I’m actually pretty good at that one.”
“Yeah,” Tony said after a short pause.  He looked down at his shoes, and toed some of the mud off against the wall with a dull thud.  Got you and Rhodey in my corner.  How could it not?”
We are not doing that, he told himself firmly, running a hand through his hair to hide the sudden tremor.
“You know me?” Steve asked, already certain of the answer if not how the answer came to be. If the man was what he thought the man was...
“I will literally buy another hotel for you to stay at,” Tony offered.  From the way Tony was shifting his legs on the sofa, Steve wasn’t entirely sure he was kidding.
“The cabin’s great. Really. It is,” Tony broke in over whatever else it was Steve was going to say.  “There’s a little pond with fish we don’t catch.  Steve likes to show them his collection of hooks, though, which I think is nice of him.  Gives them a bit of excitement.  Something to look forward to, with all that just swimming around, not being caught,” Tony continued with a nod.   Steve rolled his eyes heavenward and the corners of his mouth ticked up in a half-smile as he leaned back in his seat.  “I have my garage, with the ‘bots and all the stuff from Professor Thorne at Caltech—you saw the printouts, J, come on! All that data, and no one understands half of it. We’re just guessing. Educated guessing, but, it’s like cutting edge stuff! And Steve draws.  Or paints, sometimes, but not as much now.  Which is actually a good thing, but, ah.  Anyway, there’s a great view at night for my telescope.  It’s…nice.  The cabin, I mean.  I like it.  Here.  With the—in the cabin.”
“Five thousand dollars. Five thousand. You took—borrowed--five thousand dollars from Howard,” Tony tried out the words. Maybe if he said them out loud, they would make sense. “What happened to the five million?”
“Steve. Um, it’s Steve. I’m Steve, that is,” Blondie said quickly. “Well, the bus you want’ll be a good hour or so before it picks up again. It only runs a few routes that go all the way back to downtown on the weekend, so. You don’t want to pick the one that only goes part way and get stuck. It can be kind of confusing if you’re not used to it,” the man—Steve—said helpfully. “So--ah—you’re—you’re kind of…” he trailed off, but waved a hand up and down in the air, apparently to point out that Tony looked like a drowned rat, perhaps the wire-stealing kind, Tony thought nonsensically. “Would you—I have a towel. You could, you know, dry off a bit. If you wanted,” the man offered. “While you wait for the bus.”
“Fine.  God, you’re--quit being annoyingly observant and eat your pancakes, Gypsy Rose,” Tony flung out.  “Why
“Sorry, you’re breaking up, didn’t catch that,” Tony breathed out.  “Thanks, Rhodey.  I’m just---I’m trying very hard not to screw this up.”
It took that fraction of a second for Steve to realize that he had stopped pretending somewhere between a panic attack and Gene Simmons’ tongue.  This wasn’t a date.  This wasn’t real.  All of this, Tony’s attention and interest, this was for YouTube and Twitter and the Vegas police, not for him, not really.  In the real world, someone like Tony Stark would never be interested in much of anything beyond the obvious from someone like him, and that had been fine the other day, but now, Steve’s gut twisted, and he felt as if someone had doused him in cold water.
.  Something moved inside of it, a round, hard bulge that stretched the skin until it was glassy, and another something behind that.  A whole row of somethings was inside the alien’s cock, Tony realized with a start, like large beads or...he stopped, his mind going blank for a moment at what his eyes were seeing.
“He said The Palms, right?” Brock asked after taking a sip from his drink and smacking his lips together at the taste.
“How well you know us,” Tony muttered.
“Yeah.  He’s been with the company for ages.  After my dad died, he ran it for years.  He’s…well, he’s old school, you know.  Been in weapons for decades.  Hard to change all that overnight, I guess,” Tony explained, but Steve could hear the undercurrent of disappointment in his voice.
“Ms. Romanov asked me to see to this personally,” the first man said.  “So.  Here I am.  Seeing to this all personal-like.”
“That’s good, Steve.  You’re so close. You’re doing so good for me. You’re almost there. Come for me, now, Steve,” Tony urged, his voice like a chant in Steve’s head.  “Come for me, beloved.”
“Oh, the
He was missing something, some variable he wasn’t seeing, and it made his stomach twist in knots if he thought about it too much.   If he thought about it too much, he’d give himself a headache.
“Jealous,” Steve coughed into his hand and smiled up at Kirk, who was still focused on the painting with an intense sort of fascination stilling his features that made Steve’s stomach think it was on the Cyclone or something.  “It’s artistic license.  Looks better on top of a tree than a giant, exploding ball of gas.”
“Okay,” Steve said.  “As long as you need.  Whatever you need.”
Same answered with a swift, “Yo, Cap, world ending or is this social?”
, for the first time in so long. The tea did that, he knew from experience.  Made him sleep, so that was good, sleep with no dreams, but it opened his mind to all manner of thoughts beforehand, like his head just had to get them out, one way or another.
“Even though it was punishment?” Tony asked.  One of his hands splayed across Steve’s chest and he was drawing something with his finger. Steve thought it might be numbers, and found the idea strangely endearing.
“If he’s still sitting there when you get back, marry him,” Rhodey said evenly.
“Artistic license, then,” Tony said slowly, dropping his eyes for a moment before raising them back to Steve, all wide and liquid and gleaming.  “Sometimes, maybe…maybe it’s okay to see the world differently than how it is.  Maybe how things are, maybe that’s not everything they are.”
Tony stared at him, opened and closed his mouth, then shook his head.  “She played us.”
“Only if for some reason, I’ve been rendered unconscious and can’t replusor it. Honestly, there’s an asterisk, Steve, see?” Tony pointed.
Yinsen posed the question to Steve, who shrugged and gestured again.  “He says he does not know.”  But, if Tony wasn’t mistaken, there was something of a smile in Yinsen’s voice.
He broke the kiss, panting hard, heart pounding, as if he had been running from something, and caught Tony’s expression as he reached up to push a strand of hair off Steve’s forehead, all shadowed and full of a breathtaking awe that tore at Steve’s heart.
“Right, Thor.  With the magical mystery cure,” Tony muttered out of the corner of his mouth.  He had almost forgotten about that.  Of course, it would be a good thing.  Really good.   Really, really good.  If he kept telling himself that, maybe he wouldn’t feel like such an utterly selfish pile of shit for not immediately believing it.
“The largest one is for you and the King,” Cam told him, pointing towards the door at the end of the hall where two familiar guards stood.   “I will be just here,” he added, nodding towards one of the other rooms. The door was open, revealing a small bedchamber with a single bed, table, chair and small fireplace.  “General Rhodes is seeing to the soldiers.  He says he will camp with them, so it is just us. This way,” Cam continued with a hint of his usual imperiousness as two serving girls stepped out of the King’s room and plastered themselves, wide-eyed, against the hallway wall so that Steve and Cam could pass.  They gave quick curtsies, which made Cam grin, then shot off down the hall tittering behind their hands as soon as Steve had walked by.   Josiah opened the door for them, while Peran gave Steve a welcoming nod.
“Are you kidding?” Rhodey shot back, rolling his eye and pulling a face.  “You look…well, you’ve got dirt on your cheek.  Other cheek,” Rhodey corrected when Tony swiped at his left cheek with his shoulder.  “That’s probably going to bruise, you know.  You were flailing around a lot when they were trying to cuff you.”
that it had happened.  Just not like this.  Brock was, he supposed, trying to show he cared in his own way--making jokes, poking fun, maybe being a little crass--and here Steve was judging him for not handling things exactly perfectly when Steve himself didn’t even know what he wanted.  It wasn’t fair to Brock, but Steve couldn’t seem to quite ignore the swell of resentment in his stomach when Brock lashed out at Tony, even if Tony would never know.  Steve would know.  And he didn’t like it.
“Okay, okay.  Fair point. You communicated just fine.  Got your way most of the time, right?  Who am I kidding, all the time,” Tony muttered.  “We did okay, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Me, too, buddy,” Tony agreed as Steve stretched out and shook with another yawn.  “Me, too.”
“Nothing,” Steve said, shaking his head as much as he could within the confines of Tony’s hands.  “I am fine.”
“Unless it involves a recently developed exhibitionism and/or medical kink, I don’t particularly care,” Tony whispered, the last of it coming out in a nervous rush of laughter.
“Steve, here’s the deal,” Tony began. “If you tell them what you heard between me and Stern, they’re probably going to use that to get their hands on my technology. As soon as it’s out of my hands, Stern can get to it. One way or the other, he’ll have it. And if he does, it’s going to be bad for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that Stern’s dirty. I think you might know that,” Tony prodded.
“---got a fiver right here Rogers---“
Steve pulled his phone out of his pocket and typed a search into the internet window.  Yes.  Omegas still liked diamonds. At least, the websites said so. He had a lot of money now, thanks to the Army’s generous back pay allotment--seventy years of hazard pay adds up-- and Peggy making sure his Captain America likeness was part of his estate, which apparently was now all his, since coming back from the dead meant you weren’t an estate anymore.  He didn’t really understand the particulars of it, but he had more money now than he would have ever thought possible.  Enough to buy Tony diamonds.  Or whatever it was he wanted.
“When the trigger is released,” the King went on, his strokes growing harder and more rapid.  Steve let out a pleading whine, and heard a low, pleased chuckle in his ear.  “When the trigger is released, the counterweight falls,” the King said again, and the hand that was playing with Steve’s balls slowly slipped them through the metal ring.  Steve cried out, sharp and keening, and slumped over at the waist, curling in on himself.  “The beam is pulled upward,” the King explained as he carefully slid the golden ring off Steve’s engorged cock.  “The sling slips free and fires.”  The orgasm hit Steve so hard it knocked the air out of his lungs with a harsh burst and sent sparks behind his eyelids as he squeezed his eyes shut while his hips pumped his cock in and out of the circle of the King’s hand while ribbons of white splattered across the bed.
Slowly, the camera righted itself, though the angle was lower, and a jacket fold obscured the edge of the screen.  Daniel had been a Bureau man, Steve remembered, watching Peggy give a quick jerk of her chin over the top of where the camera was tucked to what must be Daniel’s side.
A heavily embroidered robe over a fabric so fine Steve could see the skin of his hand through it followed.  An incredibly intricate necklace of crystalized glass flowers that sparkled in the light.  A reddish-brown necklace of topaz beads.  A soft fur cured so well that the underside was like the velvet of a young deer’s antler.   Steve wanted to tell himself he was picking things at random, but each time something stood out, it was his mind saying how much Tony would like to see him in it that warmed his chest.
“That’s not who he is,” Steve said, keeping his voice even though his thoughts, terrible thoughts, roiled through his head.  What Stane said, though laced with hate and venom, was far too like his own inner voice, like Stane could see into his mind and pluck out his worst fears.  “If you think that of him, you don’t know him at all.”
“Yeah, it’s good.  Tell Nat hi for me, okay?”  Steve finished, disconnecting the call and turning back to Tony and the small table, covered in a white tablecloth, with silver-domes covering their dinner and a red rose in a small vase in the center.
Until they came upon the Stranger, that is.
God, what had he said up there, Tony wondered, rubbing a hand over his face and through his hair in a frustrated gesture.  Something about—fuck, coming back to the Avengers and,
“Shall we?” Tony said, indicating the door with a somewhat formal sweep of his hand.
“Oh, I am definitely not complaining there, Stroker Ace,” Tony said.  “In fact, I am somewhat concerned about how turned on I am by this. Now, come on, deal me in,” he grinned, giving Steve an exaggerated come-hither look.
He was in the mountains.  That much was clear.  His last memory was falling asleep in his bed.  He was dressed as if in haste, though, thankfully dressed nonetheless, in his nightshirt, a pair of pants, hanging baggy and unlaced on his hips, and his shoes, though they were not on the feet he usually wore them. He could feel his toes scrunching against the sides and carefully bent over to switch them so his feet fit into the well-worn grooves in the leather.
God, he was with
He couldn’t resist reaching out and running his hand through the mass of thick hair that was tending to curl atop Tony’s head.  It was as soft as he’d imagined it while he painted.  Softer.  Tony closed his eyes and made a low, humming sound of contentment, then opened them again and locked eyes with Steve.  His hands at Steve’s waist started pulling encouragingly at the bunched-up fabric again.  Steve lifted up his hips enough for Tony to slide his pants and briefs down his thighs, leaving his cock free to stretch out in the space between them, full and hard and dark red, the slit glistening where pre-cum leaked a steady stream.  Tony stared at Steve’s cock for a long moment, then wet his lips as Steve’s eyes tracked the motion.  He looked up at Steve from under sinfully long lashes.
No time to just sit still.  Sit still for Steve.  Be
Maybe it was like Tony’s other picture. Maybe Tony was giving everyone in the room the finger on the inside, Steve thought with a mental laugh, side-eying Tony again.   He was beginning to see how much of Tony was hidden under these layers, the way paintings became coated with layers of dirt and detritus over the years, keeping their true form hidden from view underneath. If he looked at those pictures now, would Tony’s smile seem so bright?  Or would he know enough now to see it didn’t quite reach his eyes?  Or maybe it was just Steve.
Tony still remembered being ten years old and watching on the news with Jarvis and Ana when they announced they had found Actual Fucking Captain America in the ice.  Okay, Brokaw didn’t say it like that, but he definitely meant it, you could tell.  Tony’s father had helped with the expedition that found him.  Credit where credit was due.  Howard had managed to do a couple of good things in his life, even if parenting hadn’t been one of them.  In the long run, helping create and then find Actual Fucking Captain America was probably a lot more of a legacy than anything Tony would ever leave.
Dangerous to Tony.
“It was ridiculous, is what it was,” Howard retorted.  “Making a fool out of himself.  Can you imagine what people would’ve thought if they’d found out?  Can’t even control my own son.  He’s signing up for, hell, what was it?  Intro to Computers?  What were you, learning Office for Christ’s sake?  God, that was an embarrassment.”
Steve swallowed, remembering Tony’s words, about how it was their mingled seed pouring from him, and felt a pulse of want spring from deep inside to the end of his cock, which gave a slight twitch.  Tony grinned, because, of course, he knew what was in Steve’s mind, but just finished cleaning him and tossed the cloth to the floor near his pile of clothes.  He sprawled out next to Steve on the bed and pulled the blanket from the end of the bed up over both of their legs.  A hand fisted on Steve’s chest, and he felt Tony’s head come to rest on his shoulder, breath warm on his skin.
The cloth had disappeared, dropped with a wet splash to the floor.  It was Tony’s hands now, working their way over the flesh of Steve’s back, pressing into the skin there.  Not a massage, just…feeling.  Contact.  A stroke here.  A brush of skin there.  A hard push, where the muscle met bone.  Molding, Steve thought.  Pushing something out or pressing something in, he wasn’t sure.
“He had a lab in New York City,” Steve gritted out.  It was an offer, Tony knew.  He could see the effort it took to just get those words out, but Steve did it, maybe because it
“What?” Steve said, pulling back and looking askance down at Tony.
Small ripples lapped at the shore, and the sea stretched out towards an endless horizon.  Nothing moved out there except waves and the occasional bird.. No telltale puffs of sails, at least.  He hadn’t seen a single ship since he woke up here, which meant wherever this was, it was pretty far off the usual trade routes and even out of the way of the less reputable crews, which, Steve supposed, was good if you were something like the creature and wanted to avoid much contact with the human world, as it seemed wont to do.  Not that Steve could blame it. Humans had, in Peggy’s terms, rather mucked it up, he could admit.
“And what of this prophecy of yours?” Tony asked, barely a whisper above the gurgling water. He tilted his head in question, though he kept his arms around Steve, his eyes narrowed, but his expression softer now instead of the pointed questions from days past. “The prophecy you believe will pull you away from me. What of that?”
“Yes.  For now. Just Tony,” the man--Tony--replied.
“None of it helped Yinsen,” Tony continued, ignoring Steve’s offer of absolution.  “Or his family.  None of that matters for shit to the people in Gulmira, staring down terrorists pointing my guns at them.  That’s on me.  I don’t care how you want to parse it.  I was too busy being Tony Stark, billionaire, genius, activist, philanthropist, Tony Stark, to notice little details like, I don’t know, money laundering happening at my own damn company.  Tell me you wouldn’t feel the same if it was SHIELD double dealing on your watch?”
be done,” he added, almost muttering under his breath as he glanced down at the table laden with papers and instruments, then lifted his dark eyes back to Steve.
“Really, what is one more keep to you?  We are a small holding, and have little of value anyway, as I told you.  The harvests have not been kind to us these past years,” Obie was saying.  Because you demanded too much of a share and made them overwork the land, Tony thought, though he kept his mouth shut.   “Omegas are hard to come by, even here, and even if you have others, you can’t have too many, now can you?”  Obie smirked, like he was sharing some kind of secret with the man.  The man’s face remained unchanged, but he did tilt his head, as if considering Obie’s words.  “He is beautiful, is he not?” Obie asked, sweeping his hand out as making a presentation.  “I would wager you do not see many like him.”
“Hey, Bucky, it’s me. Listen, something came up with Stark. Nothing—nothing bad, not really, just a stupid misunderstanding, but there, ah, there might be some stuff on TV or the internet about it. We, ah…we kind of accidentally got married,” Steve rushed out with a wince. “We’re getting it straightened out, of course, I mean, crazy, right? But I’m going to be here a couple of days, probably, just dealing with the lawyers and all. But, look, you can’t talk to anyone if they come looking for me, okay? Just—just don’t say anything to anyone. Nat’s going to stop by the apartment and grab some of my clothes, and just, you know, check on things,” Steve said, stumbling over the words a bit, because he knew Buck was going to resent the hell out of Nat stopping by, but also knew that would do absolutely nothing to dissuade her. “So, ah, it might be a bit before I make it back. Just, ah—just remember to take your meds, okay? They’re all on the list on the front of the ‘fridge. Be sure to take them at the right times, okay? You know what the doctor said about that. It’s—that’s important. So, don’t forget. Please. All the times are on the list. And do your exercises.   They’ll help. Your hearing is on Friday. I should be back in plenty of time for that, so don’t worry. There’s some cash in the box in the back of my closet, if you run low. Not much, but…if you need it. I mean, that’s what it’s there for. If you need anything, anything at all, just call.   Anytime. Day or night. Me or Nat, if you want, even if you just need to talk, or—“ the beep cut him off, and he was left with half-spoken words on his tongue, staring dumbly at the broken screen.
A flash of bright light cut through the room.  Headlights, Tony’s mind supplied, then immediately nose-dived into nervous motion.  He moved to the center of the bed and curled his knees up underneath him so his stockinged feet pointed out behind him.  A furtive glance at the mirror had him shifting around and stretching his legs out instead, drawing one knee up and trying to get his arms to look remotely like they were laying naturally at his sides.  There was still time to blow out the candles and hide under the covers.  He could tell Steve to wait out in the kitchen while he changed.  Steve would do it, if he asked.
Now, Steve was
“I tried that!” Tony burst out.  “He likes baseball, right? I do pay attention, Pep. Granted, not when he actually asked me to join them watching the stupid game, but let’s stay positive.  So, I asked him to go to a Yankees game with me, box seats, private chef, the works.”
“Because.  You have never been allowed to before,” Jarvis answered, eyes slowly lowering as Tony stared at him.  “Now, have another donut and drink your coffee.  I can’t stay much longer.  Your father is still recovering, and your mother has her tennis lesson.”
So, all in all, a win for Team Not as Bad as It Could Have Been, Tony thought dully.
“Who you are might be the only thing you can change,” Steve corrected, eyes firm and unflinching this time as he looked at Tony.
He could not take the pill. It would take a few days at least for his body to get the message, but his Heat would kick back in again.  An Omega in Heat…even if Steve didn’t want Tony, specifically, he’d be hard pressed to ignore that, right?  He could tell Steve he forgot.  Or that they weren’t working properly.  Steve would believe him.  Steve would take care of him…maybe Steve would even think it wasn’t that bad.  Steve might even like it.
himself from coming.  I want to come with him inside me, though, he realized, gripping the bedding so hard he felt the sheets pull away from the mattress.
“I know you worry, Steve.  About what will come. About how I feel, when I cannot say--when I cannot give you what I would want if things were--” Tony began, breaking off with a grimace of frustration marring his features.  “Vows said here, I think--I think they would
that he missed something in his design and (somewhat, slightly, maybe a tad bit) abrupt testing phase. Run before you can walk and all that.  In his defense, dying was a hell of a distraction. So, yeah, he could have missed something. A flaw. A slightly out-of-whack piece of equipment.  Some unknown he didn’t factor into his calculations.
“It was the right one,” Tony acknowledged easily.  And it was easy.  He’d known going in that he probably wouldn’t make it out, and, quite frankly, wouldn’t have wanted it the other way, him having to make the choice, even if it was a no-brainer.
Tony was still watching him with the same intent expression, but the edges were gone from it.
“Stone tell you that?” Steve asked, looking over his shoulder where he was hunkered by the bathtub.
“So,” Bruce started.  “Can you even walk?”
“You’re right,” Steve said.  For a moment, he felt heavy.  Weighted down, like he was wearing his armor again.  He could feel his gait change slightly with the sensation, and his hand tightened in the air around a phantom shield. “We weren’t always as we are.  We did only barely survive.  Maybe we won’t next time.  Or the time after that. Maybe you will last until the stars fall again.  Freedom is dangerous, I’ll grant you that.  But, an unjust society knows no true peace.  What you call safety, peace…it’s nothing more than an illusion.”
“No.  No, you are not. This is not
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, so, anyway.  Glad you found me.  I was looking for you, actually, and stumbled out here into Mr. Stark’s attempt at privacy, I think,” Steve interrupted, turning to Brock, who had a dazed sort of frown on his face.  “Sorry, again,” Steve added, shooting an apologetic look back at Stark.
Stern blinked at her, and one of his hangers-on leaned over to whisper something in the Senator’s ear. “Mimishtake,” Stern said after a moment.
“Okaaaaaay,” Steve said.  “That…is a very strange definition of ‘good news,’” Steve replied mildly.  Steve was so trusting, Tony thought, a fond smile forming. It was really sweet.  And made lying a whole lot easier.  Only about baby death fruit, though.  Otherwise, truthfulness was really important in a relationship.
“What if
“Go to the bed,” Tony ordered brusquely, dropping his hand from pendant and standing back up again. Steve wanted to sag with relief, the words sending a spike of want along the line of heat between his nipples and cock. “Get on your hands and knees in the center and wait for me.”
“The golden-coated one who kept trying to kick the stable door down and bite my hand when I offered it sugar cubes,” Tony replied, giving a pointed look at Steve while Cam did little to hide a laugh.
Steve might not want him, not the way Tony wanted Steve, but Steve cared for him.  Wanted him to be happy.  Wanted to take care of him, Tony thought, letting the chocolate melt in his mouth.  That could be enough.   Tony could be happy with that.  It didn’t have to be some sweeping, grand romance.  They could be friends.  Good friends, even.  The kind who laughed, watched movies, played chess, argued about books and…schemed to get SHIELD drone contracts.  Your basic secret handshake stuff.
“Sounds like you’ve given this some thought,” Steve smiled, though his mind stuck on the word years, tripping over and over it, unable to reconcile the fear and contentment that the word brought with it.  Years.  Tony saw them together for years.  Would he then retire to this Old Palace Tony mentioned, spending his days in luxury with the rest of the concubines who were past their prime? He shook his head, trying to clear it, forcing the frown that furrowed his brow to soften.  Too many questions over one word, he thought, though it stayed there, hovering in the back of his mind.  “I…may have heard your complaints before.  Once or twice,” Steve admitted, trying to return Tony’s smile and managing something akin to it by Tony’s pleased look.  Tony grunted in utter lack of surprise and dipped his chin to his chest while Steve went back to massaging the ridge of Tony’s shoulder.
building.  Whatever,” Tony said, leaning his head back and pinching the bridge of his nose.  “Thanks for…you know. This.  The car thing,” Tony clarified, waving his hand in midair.
The blunt head of Steve’s cock pressed against his entrance, hard and insistent, wet with Tony’s own slick.  Tony shuddered. His cock throbbed. His nipples stung. He was so empty. Steve pushed in, Tony’s hole stretching around him, even with everything Steve had done, and it burned and ached, so good, so good.  He moaned again, and Steve echoed him, pushing in, past the resistance of Tony’s body, sliding all the way in until he was fully seated, balls slapping against the bottom of Tony’s ass. He grunted, head thrown back, face a mask of ecstasy.  Tony’s mouth worked soundlessly, his throat clicking like he could feel Steve at the base of it, he was so deep, so deep inside Tony, like they were one.
“I know.  But, I’m going to work on getting you to understand,” Steve replied evenly.
“This is hand-doc or back-doc?” Barnes questioned.
“Clint, don’t be an idiot,” Natasha ground out, spreading her arms wide to indicate the watermelon-covered floor.  “Steve could slip,” she pointed out.  Then frowned and shook her head.  “Wait, that’s not—what I meant was—this was a terrible idea for a lot of reasons, wholly unrelated to Steve.  None of which I seem able to think of right now, but I’m sure there are many, many other reasons.”
He crossed the hall to his apartment and went inside, pulling his phone out his pocket.  There was an email from Obie, wanting to meet before the Board meeting this after.  Tony sighed.  He hoped that was a good sign.  It would be nice to go to the Board with Obie’s support.  He sent a quick reply and then tapped the number two button for Happy.
“True,” Tony acknowledged, huffing out a laugh.  “But, you’d come.  I know you would.  You’d be there.  Can you…can you let me be there for you?”
“Probably never was, but when has that stopped us?” Tony pressed, shifting his stance just enough to fit himself against the curve of Steve's body. He'd always fit so well there, like he was built to slide his arms around Steve's neck and let his hands wind in the soft down of hairs there on the back of Steve's neck, to rest his head on Steve's shoulder or push his hips into the solid bulk of Steve's thighs. “Tell me you don't want this. Tell me you haven't been thinking about this.”
A part of Tony, a large part, still couldn’t believe he was not only driving, but there was a car of his very own sitting in the middle of a garage of his very own being occasionally almost-polished by his ‘bots.  Not just any car, either.  The one he had spent so much time ogling in Car and Driver magazine that the pages were practically stuck together.  At this point, if Steve did ever question him about his sudden interest in laundry, he could just about legitimately blame it on the R8 with a straight face.
, he added because he couldn’t help himself.
“Is it because Clint swears he went partially deaf on purpose so he wouldn’t have to listen to you anymore?” Steve suggested.
Sometime in the early morning hours, Steve pulled his phone out of his pocket and searched the Internet for Mrs. Habersmith’s Rules for Courting.  It was out of print, apparently, but available through resellers.  Steve ordered a copy. Couldn’t hurt, he figured.  He remembered paging through books like that, never imagining he would ever have an Omega, let alone one like Tony.  Who could possibly imagine Tony, though, Steve asked himself with a small smile.  Certainly not Steve Rogers, with his lungs that didn’t work, his heart that didn't work,  and his twisted back that didn’t work.  Even his blood that didn’t work.  It sure as hell worked now, though. The serum fixed everything.
“Hi,” Jane said, with a short, stilted wave, eyes wide.
“Stan’s going to love the wi-fi when you get it installed,” Steve said.  He raised his eyebrows, then huffed out a laugh, and walked over to the small kitchen, leaning a hip against the counter.  “Wanda and Pietro…I know he takes a bit to get used to, but they’re trying.  They came here with barely the clothes on their backs, and now, Wanda’s working her way through music school, and Pietro…he’s a bike courier during the day, but goes to nursing school at night.  You’re doing good here, Tony.  Really.  These little things…they mean a lot to people.”
“For you,” Tony replied and let his eyes fall shut for a moment.  Another breath. His hand curled tighter around the tags.  He wanted Steve to touch him.  He wanted Steve to keep looking at him like this.  He didn’t know what he wanted.
“Yeah, they’ve probably chewed through the bedding, peed on your floors and chased your housekeeper away by now,” Jones snorted.
Cam grinned in return, clearly delighted at the idea, though Steve privately thought this was about as far from squiring as one could get.  Still, he saw no reason to dampen the boy’s enthusiasm.  Steve looked his reflection over one last time.  He barely recognized the figure staring back at him, half nude and decorated to tantalize. The material brushed across his cock like a light caress when he moved.  He would be half-hard by the time he reached Tony’s chambers, most likely.  He assumed it had been designed that way.  It was sheer enough and fine enough that little was left to the imagination, and he supposed that was the point, too.  Tony would see him like this and know that this was something Steve had done for him, and that would please him, Steve knew, not just because he liked how Steve looked, but because Tony liked the idea of Steve wanting to please him.
“Thanks,” Steve replied.
“I see you’re making yourself at home,” Tony observed, nodding at Barnes, who tipped the neck of his beer bottle in Tony’s direction.  “I’ve got a bit of an errand to run before dinner,” he told Steve, who nodded somewhat distractedly.
“I—what?” Tony said, shimmying to the left as the doors slid closed on a swirl of red hair.  He stared at the lighted numbers blinking across the panel as the elevator passed the various floors, momentarily thrown before his mind decided that whatever it was, it belonged in that great, black gulf of thought that he couldn’t deal with right now and dropped it in there, sending a vaguely ominous ripple down his spine.  The doors opened again, this time to the bright, white corridor dotted with things marked biohazard and signs somewhat mockingly offering directions to laboratories denoted with Restricted Access monikers.
“Sorry, love, didn’t hear them,” Ty said smoothly.  “This is Dan and Preston,” he added, nodding his head towards the two men who had followed him in.  “I was telling them about you. They wanted to meet you.”
“I’m just saying, you know they’d pay big bucks for something like this. Not a million dollars, but something,” Brock pointed out, then drained the rest of his beer and sat the bottle down on the small bedside table.  He flicked the TV off and shimmied under the bedspread, leaving them both laying silently in the dark.
“Just a few.  Basic stuff.  This community college up in Susanville? It wasn’t anything big, really,” Tony managed, though he felt like he had a mouth full of marbles.
Steve’s stuttering heartbeat calmed a bit at the man’s perfectly reasonable question, and he looked up, staring openly at the stranger now.
.  Steve grinned.
“Captain,” Fury called out as Steve walked towards the office door, making Steve slow his pace to a halt.  “For the record, I actually think it’s a good match. Agent Romanov met him a couple of times when she was undercover at SI as part of our…vetting process, you might say, for potential new contractors.  She was impressed, and if you know her, that’s saying something.”
“Here.  Try it,” Steve offered, taking some on the small fork and holding it out for Tony.  “I like you, too, Tony,” he said quietly, barely a whisper, tipping his head up encouragingly.  Tony huffed out a low breath, but gamely leaned forward. Steve felt his stomach lurch and tighten as Tony slipped his mouth over the end of the fork and took the proffered bite. It was strangely intimate, sharing food like this, though he supposed that was the whole point of this outing.
She nodded and got up to put her cup and plate in the sink, then walked over and grabbed her coat from the hook, stopping long enough to run her fingers through Steve’s hair until she felt it was straight enough and leaned down to place a quick kiss on his cheek.  “Call him or he’s going to Kool-Aid man through Brock’s door, okay?”
.  Sure.  Everyone had ideas.  From time to time.  Like, say, when their Alphas were away for three weeks.  THREE WHOLE WEEKS, STEVE, THREE WEEKS, people left to their own devices—quite literally, bless the internet--might get ideas. In his defense, Tony felt that this whole get-up practically screamed, ‘It was this or something actually combustible.’
The sound was louder here, and… familiar now, though it seemed so out of place that Steve hadn’t realized it until just that moment. “Is that--” he began.
.  Of course, he was sending Tony away.  Captain America.  Jesus.  Steve could have anyone.  Literally anyone, and he’d gotten stuck with some SHIELD hanger-on’s kid who he clearly didn’t want and didn’t need.  Captain America. Needing Tony Stark.  It was laughable.  It was so laughable, he wanted to cry.
“Never quite got the hang of dancing,” Steve admitted lightly, causing Tony to stutter to a halt.  “Or—did I?  I mean, maybe I did.  I—I don’t remember.  Damn,” Steve finished in frustration, hands going to his hips as his head dipped.  He took a deep, clearly meant to be fortifying breath, and looked back at Tony.
Tony nodded.  “Then Lady Van Dyne’s.  You’ll like her, and she you.  Then Lord Murdock at the Devil’s Table, since we must pass that way, anyway.  Wait until you see it.  This huge, red mountain, flat on top, where nothing lives, and Matthew’s keep carved right into the belly of it.  The people there are…closer to the earth than we city folk,” Tony added with a low laugh.  “They’ve manned Hell’s Gate for centuries, and it has never been breached.  They’ve held off raiders from the East and the Chitauri from the South.  A rough, hard people.  Demanding. Difficult at times, to be sure, but
Tony groaned at the burning friction. Was that what Tony wanted?  Fantasized about?  Had he thought about it back then, on the helicarrier?  Had he thought about Steve touching him like that? Tony’s hand jerked in Steve’s, then squeezed hard, clinging to him.
Slowly, Steve walked over to the bed, then sat down on the edge.  Tony made a small harrumphing sound.
“Wait, you
As always, thank you for reading.
But Tony had been unconscious and bleeding, and Steve had managed to get him out of the suit and behind a boulder just in time to watch what remained of the jet blow itself to dust.  He’d have to remember to tell Tony the auto-self destruct feature worked just dandy.  He readjusted his suit and went back inside.  Tony was laying on his back on the cot, arms at his side, staring up at the ceiling.
“Of course, right, you should—yeah,” Steve managed, putting his hands on his hips and looking down at his feet and then, by the look of it, the fascinating air conditioning vent above Tony’s head.  Great. Probably trying to keep from bursting out laughing, Tony figured.  “You.  You, ah.  You have,” Steve started, then tapped a finger along the side of his nose.
“You’re not going to screw it up,” Rhodey replied, his voice softening.
“I--I don’t know,” Steve frowned. “No one has that kind of wealth in the Free States.”
“There’s nothing wrong with denying and then running away,” Tony argued as they walked out the door.  He pulled it shut and locked it behind him, then walked around the staircase to knock on Steve’s door.  Steve opened it, gave Tony a quick, furtive look, then stepped out of the way so Tony and Rhodey could get by.
“Mostly, I assist the CEO with strategic planning decisions,” Steve deadpanned, giving Tony a raised eyebrow.  “It’s fine, Tony.  I do what I do, and they pay fair.”
Tony’s brow arched speculatively.  He sat up on one elbow and looked down at Steve with a harrumph that sounded intrigued.  “You believe you will best me,” Tony observed.
“If—and I mean if—something like that existed, which it doesn’t because we are nowhere near that advanced, but, I mean, if it did exist, then…then I’d be really interested in what else it could do.  That kind of power, the power to punch a hole through space and time like that--we could—it would be almost limitless, what we could do with it.  I—I’m—I mean the possibilities…” Tony trailed off shaking his head.  “I’d need to think on it for a few days.”
The apartment.  He turned back to Clint and Bucky, a question forming on his lips.
Steve withdrew his finger and worked it in a few more times, until he felt Tony’s body stop working against the invasion.  He added a second finger, which slid in easier this time, and used his thumb to rub up and down over the delicate skin below Tony’s hole, pressing just hard enough where he knew Tony could feel it as he kept up the motion with his fingers.
The prompt request was for Steve getting de-serumed and Tony being protective.
Steve was holding out a tray of colored pencils while the ‘bots whirred their pincers around to find the right one.
,” Tony pointed out.  “So, how about we all just agree to overlook me Doofenshmirtzing myself, huh?”
It took Tony a full three heartbeats to understand what she was implying.  He counted, because he could hear them in his head, pounding against the base of his skull behind his hears.
Steve looked back and then glanced down between them where Tony’s cock jutted from a thatch of dark, wet hair at the juncture of his thighs.  It was long and thick and curved slightly to the left, leaking copiously from the head.  He’s going to fuck me with that, Steve thought to himself, feeling a shiver of anticipation run through him.  He swallowed, feeling his throat work against the curve of Tony’s neck, leaning in and letting Tony’s cock slide between them.
“Of course, just do not venture too far. Take Ott with you, in case the tide starts to come in,” Tony said. Cam nodded and hopped up off the divan with his bag of flotsam.
“Ah-ha!  So, you
The knotting wrap was the most beautiful one he had ever seen.  Wrapped in a simple, cotton muslin, sat a long swath of red silk, embroidered with two golden dragons reaching out for a flaming pearl while gilt-threaded lotus blossoms and chrysanthemums blooms floated around them, edged in cresting waves.  A rich smell clung to it.  An old smell, but not unpleasant. Something familiar, sweet, but with a sharp hint of spice.  Cloves, maybe, he thought.  Reminded him of Christmas for some reason he couldn’t quite place.
“Time to go, Captain!” Tony shouted, grabbing Steve by the elbow and propelling them up the stairs. Sure enough, two floors up, there was a door marked with a red sign that read exit in German. Tony made for it, only to be hauled backwards by Steve.
Peggy certainly hadn’t been who he had been expecting to see when he opened his eyes on the other side of the portal or whatever Bruce and Shuri called it.  Wormhole, tunnel, bridge, Steve wasn’t sure if they had ever settled on anything in particular. A way. A chance. Hope. No one wanted to call it what it was.
“A wiser occupation, with a far better retirement, I’d say,” Josiah chimed in, though he was grinning.  “Quite the operation they have here, isn’t it?” he asked, scanning the pit with the same practiced gazes that Steve supposed most soldiers developed.  Threats. Exits. Weapons. It became habit when your life depended on it.
He shivered and closed his eyes.  At least he now knew what the things in the cabinet were for, though the knowledge wasn’t especially comforting.  Would Tony want him to do those things? Zola seemed to think so, but Zola’s words were poison, Steve knew.
“So.  Who is going to win?” Peggy asked, placing her hand over Tony’s where it held the figure.  Steve watched the movements of the figure slow, and finally, finally, Tony head lifted up enough to catch Peggy’s eyes.  He shrugged, then looked down again.
Stark was watching him somewhat skeptically, but nodded, then stepped aside, spreading one arm wide to indicate Steve should head back into the penthouse. He stepped through the door and scanned the room. Ms. Potts and Mr. Murdock glanced up at him from their places at the long dining table, which had apparently become some kind of war room stand-in, littered with papers, files and humming laptops emblazoned with the Stark Industries logo. Ms. Potts was talking into her cell phone, rapid-fire instructions that seemed to be their dinner order, all beginning with ‘Mr. Stark would like…,’ the fact that it wasn’t on the restaurant’s menu seemingly not an insurmountable problem.
“Alright, get going.  Take your fashion disaster enabler with you,” Pepper added.
He’d gotten one look at the stage and immediately taken back every not-so-glowing thing he’d ever thought about strippers. Strippers were wonderful. Strippers were the best thing God ever put on this green earth. And this one? Tall, blond and incredibly muscled, though not the scary-huge kind that made you concerned they were just going to explode if you poked them. All-American good-looks right down to his red, white and blue striped thong. God Bless America. Tony had never felt more patriotic in his life. He’d even sent a wad of bills back with the waitress in the hopes of some private time, but all he’d gotten was an apology, a seemingly sincere ‘His loss,’ and a refund from the sympathetic waitress. He hadn’t been sure if she’d been gazing longingly at him or the roll of cash. Actually, he was pretty sure which one it was, and that didn’t do much for his disappointment. The night hadn’t exactly ended how his mind had briefly envisioned, though he’d put those thoughts to good use later.
Tony looked over at Steve, who was standing almost at attention, watching Tony look at the stars with such an intense look, it made Tony’s mouth go dry.  He had thought Bonding meant losing what little of himself he still clung to, that hidden and shriveled part he buried under so many layers.  But, with Steve, he was more himself than he had ever been.
Who took care of Steve?  The five-million-dollar question, thanks Howard.  With Barnes sidelined, Nat’s hands full, and Thor locked away in some dusty monastery vault pouring over ancient tomes, who put Steve first, even just here and there, even if it was just when they could and not all the time?  Who made sure he got to doctors’ appointments, rehab, all that crap?  Made him rest when he needed to, got him to laugh about it when he could, cried with him when needed that, too?  Tony knew the answer, but he couldn’t quite let himself think it.
“Wait, how long ago, exactly?” Steve asked, smiling curiously down at Tony as he gently settled his hands on Tony’s hips.
He just had no idea what to say.  He’d spent so much time on the ‘should I or shouldn’t I’ decision that the after part hadn’t really been considered.  He should have a list.  Make a nice, neat list like he used to do for his art school projects.  Sexual Things I Am Not Ok With by Steve Rogers.  He felt a bit of hysterical laughter threaten to bubble up and just ended up blurting out the first thing that came to his mind.
“Alright. Tony,” Steve acknowledged agreeably, smiling a bit.
Tony crawled over on his knees, sitting back on his heels as he looked at Steve. This was what every Alpha dreamed of, after all. Their Omega bowed before them, fully presented and waiting to be knotted. Easily half the porn on the planet involved just this scenario.   He’d expected it to be insanely hot, of course, and it was, but it was…it was something more, somehow, some kind of deep promise bound with hope and love and not a little bit of terror.
“Okay, so he’s, what, weirdly possessive about the company?  I mean, he is, I guess, but…wait…the weapons.  The shipment that went missing and turned up on the black market.  He’s running the investigation on our end.  Coordinating with DoJ.  I just asked for an update,” Tony recounted.  “The damn weapons.”
Just great.
“Okay,” Steve said after a beat to consider. That seemed fair, and there was certainly nothing about it that should seem suspect, but Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t entirely true, either. Whatever this was about for Tony, and Steve still couldn’t quite fathom what that might be, he doubted it was as simple as Tony wanted to make it out to be.  Steve just wasn’t sure if Tony was only dissembling for Steve, or if he was deceiving himself to some degree, too.
“That’s not his name,” Tony muttered, pulling back and giving Steve a reproachful look, which just made his Alpha grin all the wider.
The thing was, Steve did see that. He closed his eyes and drew in a shaky breath. “Promise me,” Steve began. “Promise me one thing. One thing, and I’ll not bring it up again.”
“Thank you,” Steve replied, somewhat taken aback.
“Nope,” Steve answered.
They worked together, as one, all of them better for it, but even Tony could feel the difference when it was him and Steve.  He would have had to ask Steve what kind of books he liked, but if he landed and pointed his repulsors at Steve, Steve just raised the shield and directed the energy blast toward the approaching robots or Steve would raise his hand and Tony would grab him and toss him on the back of one of the bigger ones, giving Steve and his shield access to the vulnerable necks, as if everything was just done by unspoken agreement worked out in advance.  It was that easy, that natural.
From outside, he heard the rolling clank of the garage door opening as Steve unloaded Tony’s gear from the trunk.  The armor had been a last-minute addition to their trip.  Leaving it behind…had just turned out to be something he couldn’t do.  Thankfully, Steve hadn’t questioned it, just dutifully put it in the back of the SUV next to Tony’s Hermes suitcase and a big bag of mixed nuts, still in their shells.
“Yes, Captain?” JARVIS replied a moment later.
“We'll just step out while you two talk,” Pepper offered.
“As am I,” Tony breathed out, pulling Steve’s head down for another kiss, harder and deeper, full of promise and longing. They took their time with each other this time, unhurried touches exploring each other anew. Steve ran his hands up and down Tony’s chest, locking his arms around Tony’s back and pulling him on top of him. He liked the feel of Tony spread out over him, all warm skin and hard lines.   Steve kissed a long line down Tony’s neck and shoulder as Tony groaned and dipped his head to find Steve’s mouth again, the kiss turning hot as Tony melted against him. He wasn’t sure how long they went on like that, but by the time he moved Tony to his back and settled between his legs, Tony’s eyes were dark orbs, his skin flushed and damp, hair in disarray from Steve’s hands and every word half a gasp.
over the past year. Teammates, brothers in arms, friends. “You need to get some rest. And eat. It wasn’t your fault, either, Avenger. It wasn’t anyone’s fault except Hydra’s. We can’t save everyone.”
“See? We really can’t,” Steve said with a twisted grimace, caught between laughter and desperation, his body still thrumming with desire.  He leaned his head back against the trunk of the tree and thumped it there a few times, until Tony grabbed the front of his tunic and pulled him close for a long, searing kiss that promised more, before pulling back abruptly.
“Maybe,” Tony answered honestly.  “I don’t know. Have at it.  All yours.  The coffee, I mean.  It—you can have it.  I have—I need---there’s work.  For me.  My work. So, I’m just going to go.  Because of the work.”  Smooth.  Completely believable.  Natasha could take lessons.  He closed his eyes in abject horror and pushed himself off where he reclined against the counter, heading for the stairs that led down to his workshop.
“Thank you, Your Highness.  You are very generous.  I would…like more,” Steve replied flatly.
“I’m so sorry about this, Mr. Stark. I don’t know how they do this.   I swear to God they weren’t here five minutes ago,” a well-dressed woman with a gold name badge pinned to her blazer lapel said appearing at Steve’s shoulder.  “Security has been trying to clear them out all day, but we have so much traffic in here between casino patrons and hotel guests, they manage to crawl back in.”
“A Bond,” Steve said, trying out the word in his mind as he said it.  It was a warm thought, too, he noticed, warm and glowing with a soft, hazy sort of incandescence in his mind, and wondered when he had started to classify thoughts and words that way.  “Just like that.”
Tony flopped back on the bed, staring at the ceiling until he heard the door snick closed.  He rolled over and disengaged the gauntlet, though tucked it on the table by the bed.  Just in case.  A lot could happen in three seconds, really.  What was even the point of counting to three?  Give the other guy a running start?  Really, schoolyard fairness had no place when it came to threats to Steve safety.  Or happiness.  Or really anything that would annoy him.  Or hunger, because that obviously meant no sex for Tony, so that was definitely—you know, counting to three was just a waste of time in the strictest sense of the phrase.
“Steve,” Bucky said, not completely unkindly but with a firm resolve, in that quiet, serious way that Bucky, for all his frat boy shenanigans, could manage to pull out seemingly at will when it came to Steve.  “You are not dating Tony Stark.  What you are doing is letting him fuck you for money.  That’s it.  Oh, he may play nice for now, sure.  He’s getting all the sex he wants with no strings.  Meanwhile you…you want real.  And this…thing…with Stark is about as far from real as it gets.  How do you think he sees you?  Does he take you out to meet his friends?  Go to any fancy parties lately?  I saw he was at some big bash last Saturday night.  Clint had E on, and there’s Stark, pretty as you please, living it up.  And where were you?  At home, waiting for his car to come get so you could meet him.  After.  After, Steve.  You’re an after.”  Steve felt his shoulders slump and put a hand up to stop Bucky from saying more, because he really, really did not want to have this conversation now, but Bucky, as usual, ignored him.
Stark took a sip of his wine, rolled it around on his tongue for a moment and swallowed, keeping his eyes on Steve.
“Yeah, you do that,” Tony muttered. He flicked one switch, then another.  Tapped at various controls. Nothing seemed to want to do anything except blare doom at him.  “Can you shut the alarms off, I can’t hear myself think!”
It had seemed so simple, a lifeline when Clint had casually mentioned that he’d done it from time to time when he’d been short on funds.  No big deal.  He’d seemed so nonchalant about it.   All high-end, Clint had said.  No weird stuff, unless you were into that.  You had to ok everything beforehand.  All above-board, or as above-board as something like this could be.
Putting the phone aside, Steve steadied the hanging bag and took a swing, landing a solid hit that rattled the chains above.  It did feel good, he had to admit, the familiar rhythm of it like a heartbeat.  For the first time since he came out of the ice, though, it wasn’t pushing his thoughts away so much as helping him think them, he realized after his pace picked up.
“That’s not…” Steve trailed off, shook his head and looked down at the half-empty bottle of beer between his hands.  “That obvious, huh?” he asked with a grimace.
“Ugh, stop, Tahir.  He is not used to you!  What will he think of us?” Nyma cut in, slapping at Tahir’s shoulder.  “Do not worry, Raj’Inama.   He means that Zola had the metalsmith make a bronze cast of it, that is all.  Zola has many.  All sizes and shapes, whatever may be desired.  Christine likes Danen’s sometimes.  It is so nice and curved, and not so big I can’t use my fingers.  Fingers are best,” she asserted, dabbing her fingers slowly in and out of the surface of the water, watching the droplets drip back down with soft plinks.
“Yes, Master,” Steve replied, dropping his gaze down to Zola’s and holding it there until the other man looked away with a small humph of air.
“Well.  Let’s just say you breaking his nose in that tourney wasn’t without a certain amount of enjoyment on my part. Beyond you winning, of course,” Tony replied with a droll roll of his eyes.
“I think up all sorts of crazy ideas in the night.  I have trouble sleeping from time to time, as you know.  Somehow, the impossible seems possible around the time just before the sun comes up,” Tony replied with a sort of deprecating half-smile.  “Here,” he said, waving Steve towards the tub.
is with me.  That I should stop.  Now.  Before something happens that I can’t take back.”
,” Steve corrected, turning to walk over to the full length window, letting one fisted hand brace against the glass as he looked down at the city beneath them. Oh, Tony thought.  Well, that’s—that’s a different take on things, Tony thought mutely.
.  Did he like you a lot?  Did he like your mouth?”  Hammer asked in a low voice threaded with something that set Steve’s teeth on edge.  “I’ll bet he didn’t like it as much as I will.  Tony has such a reputation, but he’s never quite known how to properly enjoy his amusements.  He’d rather play with his little toys.  Build his
Shellhead hummed, that happy buzzing hum that Steve liked.  He was smiling a bit now as he listened to Steve talk. Steve wondered if maybe Shellhead could hear the affection in his voice when he talked of Peter or if it was something else.
.  About the furthest thing from it.”
He tugged the strap back in place yet again and twisted to the side, one hand on his hip and a small frown pulling his brows together.  He had no idea if he had gotten this remotely right.  Googling ‘vintage forties lingerie’ produced results that ranged from long, flowing gowns that would make the nuns proud to websites presumably called some version of WhoKnewTheFortiesWereThatDepraved.com.
“So, you have done your duty and may go rest and prepare to be dutifully impressed,” Tony grinned. “Where’s your faithful shadow?”
“You two are killing me.  Honestly.  I’d give my other arm if you’d stop with the doe-eyes and just happily ever after yourselves already,” Barnes snorted.
“More of a wormhole kind of guy than actual worms,” Tony replied, his mouth twisting into a grimace.  Probably better to get everything on the table up front than face whatever might result from Rogers being disappointed later.
“When is he going to stop this shit?” Barton asked, nodding at Tony. He was a Beta.  He totally did not understand.  Also, he was in the bubble.  Tony had never much liked him, to be honest.  Of all the Avengers, he was easily the most expendable, let’s face it.
But now, with Steve's arrival imminent, every step he'd taken, from his let's-test-the-firewall book order on up to a semi-sentient, laundry-obsessed bot seemed more like blindingly stupid self-sabotage than anything else. That's what Howard would say, no doubt. That Tony had one job, just one simple job, namely not screwing up
“What do you think?” Tony heard Steve ask as he was halfway through typing a reply.
“Of course!  That’s completely understandable.  I mean, you’re you, and he’s—well, he’s yours, of course you were.  Very, very sorry, Sir,” the man said, leaning a bit as if trying to see Tony behind Steve’s back.  “Can I just say,” the man continued as a couple of other officers came to stand next to him, one scratching his head, the other clutching a fire extinguisher in his arms as if it was the Holy Grail.  “I’m a huge fan,” the man grinned.  “Ever since I was a kid, to tell you the truth.  Would—would it be okay if we took a picture with you?”
“Cam,” Tony said, calling the boy to his side.  “That helm, if you please.”  Cam rushed over to the wall and plucked the helmet Tony had indicated, then brought it back, placing it in Tony’s hands.  “For you,” Tony said, holding it up. Steve bent his neck, and let Tony slide the helm into place.  It covered his cheeks and nose well enough, he thought, at least well enough to conceal much of his face.  It was bronze, he thought, and had wings affixed to each side for no reason Steve could figure, though leather neckguard that wrapped under his chin and across his neck, designed to protect the skin under armor, covered his collar, which he assumed was why Tony chose it.  “Suits you,” Tony said after a moment, then walked back over and stepped up to his chair.  “You are a visiting soldier, seeking to test your skills against our finest.  Would that you could wield a sword or spear.  I imagine that would be quite the sight.  As it is—”
“It—no.  But, it feels right, if that makes any sense,” Steve replied somewhat noncommittally.  “Like me, I guess.  Everything’s—it’s…where it should be,” Steve said with a wave of his hand.  Tony looked around at the neat, ordered room, and could see what Steve meant.  “It’s great, Tony, really.  Thank you.”
“I’d like to hear you play sometime,” Steve said, giving Tony a sheepish look.
“You’re right.  I don’t.  I want to, but, right now, yeah, I don’t.  Maybe I am getting in over my head, but I can’t not.  Steve, come on…it’s my life, too,” Tony replied.  “You think all that—that stuff I do, that shit you read in the tabloids, you think that’s my life?  This—this with you, this is my life.  Whatever that means.  However scary whatever it is you’re dealing with is.  Nothing—literally nothing, is scarier than the idea that I don’t get to have this.  Hell, we’ll go to therapy together.  Not like I can’t use it, let’s face it.”
It was over in a flash, and Tony wondered if it had been for the cameras furiously recording and clicking around them like a wall of small, intrusive, brightly-colored bricks.  But, then Steve smiled, that soft, warm one that made all the worries and questions seem to melt off his face, and it was just for him, Tony realized.   This look, that open, easy happiness that smoothed away everything else, that was for Tony.  The wide, pasted-on smile, the self-deprecating one he gave the paparazzi, the devilish one he flashed sometimes, those were looks he gave the world, but this one…this one was Tony’s.
“The King was detained longer than he expected.  You are to eat and wait,” one of the guards said, then turned and went back to his post without further explanation.
“Toast?” Tony asked Steve, shoving a plate of buttered toast Steve’s way.
,” Tony snapped, then brought one of his hands up to scrub over his face.  “I’m sorry, I just—I do not care to hear you so hard on yourself. You are not wrong,” he repeated, softer this time, but no less urgent.  “You have suffered. Tremendously. More than anything, I wish it were not so, but you have. Your mind still reminds you of that sometimes. Bruce tells me this is common enough with soldiers.  The war follows them. It follows you. Like a shadow. Sometimes, it seems so real, I can almost see it,” he sighed, raking a hand through his hair before returning it to hold onto Steve’s arms again, giving them a tight, reassuring squeeze.  “I wish you would take the elixir Bruce prepared for you. It would help you to sleep.”
Tony stood up, slowly this time, to avoid the chair’s tentacle-like legs.  “Night,” he said to Steve with a curt nod.
“Why not? If my nobles and guests want to find entertainment for the evening, they will find an abundance of it in the city, where they can use their own coin instead of mine,” Tony said with a low shrug, though the casualness was belied by the hard gaze he leveled on Steve. “The Royal Harem is a long tradition, I’ll grant you, but we were no more than ironmongers once with little more than the hammers and anvils of our forebearers to our names. Wandering the wastes, looking for a home. We didn’t have harems then. We built things,
“Big reveal.  Bit of showmanship. I get it,” Tony nodded absently.  “Guess we should get ready for dinner.”
Thanks again to everyone for reading along!
Steve stopped next to where Stone’s lance rested and held up the purse, dangling it from one hand in front of Stone.  Then he curled his hand into a fist and brought it down as hard as he could. The lance splintered under the force of the blow, the coronel breaking off and falling to Steve’s feet, and the railing broke clean in two, sending the lance point falling to the dirt in a rain of gold coins.  The crowd seemed to gasp in surprised unison, several of them rising to their feet in shock.
“Tony?  Shut up,” Steve said.  He smiled and shook his head, giving Tony an exasperated, but not unaffectionate look.  “I love you. And you were just almost
“I’m going to get you open now,” Tony told him. Steve wanted to nod, but any movement tugged at his nipples and returned sensation to them for a moment, so he steeled himself and simply let his gaze fixate on Tony, who was walking to their bedside where the small vat of warm oil waited. He disappeared from view. It had to only be moments, heartbeats, but it felt like eons. Steve made a soft, keening sound in his throat that gurgled up, choking and needy.
“How could you think that?  You were always the best thing that ever happened to me.  Even when it hurt.  I wouldn’t have traded any of it.  Not a second, Tony, not for anything,” Steve said, looking over at Tony with a soft, urgent gaze.
“Wasn’t doubting you, Shellhead, just impressed,” he added as he went back to rowing.  He felt the boat rock as Shellhead let go and saw him gliding along beside it, occasionally darting underneath or disappearing for some time, though never long.  When the island was a speck in the distance, Shellhead popped up and bent over the side of the boat, pointing at the mast.
“You want to hear it?  You want to hear about how I can’t draw anymore?  How I can barely make those stupid vases Sam insisted I try?  How some days, my back’s so bad, I gotta choose between the pain or being so doped up on the meds, I can’t think?  How I wake up screaming sometimes because, maybe it was just a loaf of bread, I don’t know? How I hear a car backfiring and I want to duck?  How I look for exits as soon as I walk in a room?  How I have to be at the back of the class, so the wall’s behind me, and not other people?” Steve bit out, slamming his backpack down on the desktop and bracing his knuckles against the wood, rocking back and forth slightly.  “I got nothing to say to you, Tony. That person, the one you fell in love with, the one who hung up Christmas lights with you and ate weight in mustard packets?  The one who wrote those letters?  He’s gone.  He doesn’t exist anymore.   You’re having this fantasy where we go back, pick up where we left off.  There’s nothing to pick up, Tony.  Whatever it was, its gone.  Over.  And you can’t buy it back.  Not even you.  You need to get that through your head.”
not really, not seeing what was happening, one razor-sharp fissure at a time.  It wasn’t like he was blind to why the rage directed at them was lined with a nauseous loathing that seethed deep inside his stomach.
“The Grand Canyon. Big hole in the ground. Kinda famous,” Stake explained, nodding his head from side to side, like he was mulling over the best description.
“Okay,” he heard Steve say softly, probably because he didn’t want any of the agents shuttling through the lobby to know that his Omega was already causing a problem.
“I know. I’m—it’s a lot.  Everything’s happening at once, and it’s…it’s just a lot, okay?” Steve stammered.
“Buck’s not mad at you anymore.  Says you may be an idiot, but not a total loser,” Steve offered with a grin.
“In time for dinner then,” Tony said with a slight nod as he frowned at the pouch of electrolyte fluid Natasha shoved in his hand.   “Okay, now you’re just doing that on purpose,” he accused with a hiss when she pressed a clean bandage over his wound.  “Friday, have, let’s say…two of everything on Gianetti’s menu waiting when we get there.  A triple order of the manicotti and that goat cheese ravioli.  And whatever their dessert special is. Better make it four of those,” Tony said.  “What?  He’s got a sweet tooth.  Just guilts you into not eating the dessert so he can have it.  Hand to God, I saw him creating a flowchart of strategies to convince Clint not to eat the last of the birthday cake, and number one was ‘Fake food poisoning.’  He doesn’t’ mess around, I’ll give him that.”
Lunch, Tony thought, was a roaring success.  Sure, Steve had given Tony something of a dubious look over the mug Tony picked out for him, though, to be fair, the Captain America mug was maybe a little childish.  He thought Steve might balk, but Steve had gamely poured his lemonade into it without a word.
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied.  “Voice modification activated.”
“You will not truly leave,” Cam said, shuffling his feet underneath him as he looked down at his toes before raising wide eyes to Steve, before glancing around and wetting his lips nervously.  The walls listen, Steve thought to himself, and knew Cam was thinking it as well.  Steve did not imagine someone was truly listening to them, not now, but words were like water here, and flowed their own way, no matter what you intended.  “You were only curious.  Because you are from far away.  You would not try to leave the King.  You care for him.”
“I thought they’d never leave,” Josh said when the door closed behind Sugar swish of sequins.
The Accords.  They’re sending them somewhere, the pieces that were left on the board.  A test.  A trial balloon to see who would balk.  Who would be in
But he’s so interested in the company succeeding, another voice, deeper and familiar, slithered through his head.  He doesn’t want you.  And he can’t set you aside and keep the company.  But, he wants the company to do well.  Do you really think Steve plans to be celibate for the rest of his life?  How do you know he doesn’t already have someone?  Someone not you.  Someone he wants.  Someone he’s willing to put up with you to get.  Someone he takes care of in all the ways an Alpha can.
“No,” Steve managed to husk out in a voice that didn’t quite sound like his own.  It was the truth, at least.  The King seemed to relax a bit at that, and the hand on Steve’s stomach flexed, the fingers dipping low enough to skim the metal chains that wound their way through the belt.
whatever
Tony turned back to the mirror and adjusted his cap, then tried to smooth out the wrinkles of his robe. Jarvis walked over and dusted non-existent lint off the shoulders in quick swipes of his hand.  Rhodey came to stand next to him and pulled at the bottom of his uniform jacket to straighten it.
, Tony replied.
Yes, Steve thought, blinking slowly at Tony.
Head down, eyes forward, Steve thought.  Play by the rules, their rules, and he could have whatever he wanted. Fury was good, Steve would give him that.  He made it almost seem like a choice.
“It’s not Barnes. At least, not so much Barnes—it’s…” Tony started, then stopped and used the pause to clear his suddenly dry throat, the familiar admonition not to say anything a drumbeat in his head.   “How much do you know about soulmarks?”
He expected her to get on, if only because she was, in fact, babysitting him, and they both knew it, as much as it rankled.  Considering what he had just left in his wake, he couldn’t really fault Fury for putting someone on him.  He probably would have done the same.
, he thought, and felt himself shiver, even under the scorching sun. That’s your heart wanting an excuse for what’s coming, he told himself, and gave himself a mental shake to clear the cobwebs in his head.
He couldn’t do this.  What they—he—the other Steves, or Tony’s fantasy versions of them—were suggesting.  Obviously.  That much was…well, it was obvious. Right?  Definitely.
“Come,” Tony said.  “I’ve waited all day to feel you again.”
Tony’s mind filled with dark, swirling paintings that hurt to look at, the way Steve stared at the night sky when he couldn’t sleep, the frustration that occasionally laced his voice when he didn’t understand something.  The way he had said he lost everything.  How loud it was here.  How alone he had been, needing something he couldn’t name.
, Tony would be interested.
“Well, it’s a classic,” Stark said, which was the same thing Iron Man had said about it, and Steve had to admit, the movie had been funny as hell.  “It’s weird. Okay? My life.  I get it. It’s complicated and messy and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.  This probably makes no sense to you, I know.  But, I’m telling you, all that stuff you see and read out there, it’s all just a stage and there’s a script and the audience knows what it wants, and I just play my part.  The guy behind the curtain, he’s…well, I don’t know, but not what you see splashed across page six.  That’s my spiel, so.  Come by the Tower, don’t come by the Tower, whatever, I’ll buy the sketches either way.  You got talent.  I mean that.”
“Didn’t Arnold just cover himself in mud and sharpen some twigs?” Coulson asked.
This is a request from anon for a Caveman AU!  It is A/B/O with Omega Tony and Alpha Steve.  This chapter is rated Explicit. Please heed the updated tags.  The non-con is off-screen between Tony and another character.  Tony thinks about it from time to time, but it isn't in explicit detail.  It is situationally and culturally not considered non-con by Tony (to some degree, at least at first) and by the group Tony is with.  But, it definitely is.    So, please use your best judgment and ask if you have questions.
, Tony texted back.
“I imagine it would be,” Steve agreed.
“Probably not, but do it anyway.  Though, let’s keep this between us for now,” Tony replied.
“Make me feel it,” Tony said with quiet determination.
Steve was quiet for a long moment.  “I didn’t get your voicemails and texts,” Steve said finally.
“Thank you,” Tony said agreeably, enjoying the feel of Steve’s hands massaging the lather into his scalp.  “I mean—Yes.  Yes, that was probably very helpful,” he amended quickly.
Tony crawled off of Steve and managed to stand in a graceful way that Steve felt defied physics, though he lumbered to his feet, adjusting his swim trunks as best he could.  Tony seemed to have no such compunction about the outline of his cock straining against his red Speedo, not that Steve was going to complain.  It was ridiculous and cliche and stupidly, insanely hot.
Steve sucked in a deep breath and closed his eyes.  It was easier to say it out loud that way, though he didn’t know why that was true. “I want--I want to--I want to come with you inside me.  Please?  Please, Tony, I--” he whispered brokenly. “I think I can.  Please.  If you…”
“Tony,” Steve said in an exasperated tone that set Tony’s nerves on edge.
“That its both a religion and a food group?” Steve teased, a smirk shifting over his face before it fell off, letting that carefully neutral look that Tony was coming to hate creep back onto Steve's face. “Come on. Get your coat.”
, Tony thought silently.
Not just metal, he realized with a start.
“Oh, Tony.  Of course, it is quite normal for you to feel things, whether those feelings are returned or not,” Jarvis said softly.  “But, I suppose you already know that quite well.”
.  Why?  Tell me why,” Tony pleaded, the last coming out in one long, shaky breath.  “Please.  Please tell me why.  I need…I need someone to tell me why.  I need something here to make sense because none of this—none of this makes any fucking sense!”
“You’re not serious,” Steve protested, with a tone that was already half acceptance.  “You are serious,” Steve corrected at Tony’s look.
“Please,” Tony indicated, waving at the table.  “Help yourself.”
Thinking about it again, his fingers itched to write it all down.  Organize the swirling thoughts that kept beating against his head into a neat, ordered list.  How it might look if this were actually real.  If ‘I like you’ meant something else.
“Yeah, oh,” Tony huffed.  “Anyone got anything beyond a single syllable?”
Steve nodded. Yes.  He wanted that.  Desperately.  No intrigue, no plans, no secrets, no lies, just him and Tony, and for tonight, for all the nights they had, he could give that to Tony.  Maybe that was his own penance, in a way, because he doubted he would ever find anything that approached this again.  He would always be Tony’s, collar or no.  He blinked and glanced away from Tony’s face, up to the canopy with its rich, vibrant colors threaded with gold.  He nodded again, eyes watering at the edges, and looked down at Tony.  One tear slipped out and left a thin line down his cheek.  Tony reached out his hand and cupped the side of Steve’s face as Steve leaned into the warm, familiar solidity of it, closing his eyes.  He felt Tony wipe his thumb down the path of the tear, and when he opened his eyes, Tony’s expression was filled with such yearning, it split open Steve’s heart and burrowed there, warm and bright, lighting up his chest with pinpricks of heat.
“Of course not, don’t be ridiculous.  But, you can from that,” Stark said, pointing at a dot in the evening sky that was slowly getting bigger.
“What do I say if they ask about the videos?” Steve wondered aloud.
“No kidding,” Barnes huffed.  “Tony, you okay there?”
Oh God, what if it hadn’t been good?  Why had he spent all that time studying thermonuclear astrophyics or clean energy solutions when he should’ve been focusing on important stuff like whether you were supposed to use some kind of scented oil in the bath and how to reinforce carpeting?  Stupid fucking MIT and their useless curriculum.
Tony threw open the door with more force than he intended, sending a shock of reverberation up his arm.  The SUV ground to a halt a few feet from the edge of the deck, sending a spray of dirt and gravel into the air around the tires.  Tony raised a hand in greeting and opened his mouth to call out, then sort of let it hang open, fish-like, when Coulson hopped out of the car and started walking towards the front door of the cabin.
“I guess because…they might hurt someone?” Cam said with a small frown.
One of Shellhead’s tentacles tapped at his shoulder, and Steve looked over to find his friend watching him, a silent question on his face.
He let out a puff of air through his nose and pinched the bridge of it between his fingers, rubbing at the dull, aching throb there.  He missed Tony.  So damn much.  He’d known that he would lose Tony one day.  He’d known that from the beginning.  To Pepper or someone else.  Someone who smiled and laughed and made jokes and got his references and sparked his wonderful mind.  Someone who took him places, who liked to step out with his fella, maybe showed him off a bit.  A bitter, caustic taste burned a path up his throat and an answering sting pulled at the corners of his eyes at the thought, but he’d learned the hard way that not wanting something to happen didn’t stop it from happening.  He shook his head, trying to clear it, and clicked on the file as much to close off that line of thought as just to get this over with.
“I fucked up,” Tony told him, grimacing and looking away for a long moment before dragging his eyes back to Steve. “I fucked up. A lot. And now, I have to tell you how I completely fucked this up, I know that, but it’s… complicated. More complicated? Is that even possible? Fuck, I don’t know. I’m…”
These are some snippets that I did over on tumblr for my follower celebration once I hit 10k followers. Of course, then drama happened and I ended up getting off tumblr.  So, here's a few things from various fics that people requested.  Sorry for typos, not beta'd.
“Thanks, Happy. Mr. Rogers, I’m Ms. Potts. We spoke earlier,” the woman said by way of introduction.  Steve nodded.  Not a conversation he was likely to forget. “If you’ll follow me.”
Shellhead was staring at him, eyes round and, well, almost yearning, like he was thinking about Steve’s words and finding something there that meant something to him.  Maybe he was. Maybe there was someone out there Shellhead cared about, or maybe he just wanted that, the way most people did. Companionship. Love. A person who was
“Raise the temperature five degrees, please, Nurse.  There are warming blankets in the hamper,” Doctor Glenn of the Rules Committee said through gritted teeth Tony could practically hear grinding together even through the mask.  Two nurses darted off to grab them and started wrapping them around Steve’s legs.  “This is on you, Coulson. Fury isn’t going to be happy about this, you know that.”
“This way,” Ms. Potts instructed in a clipped tone, barely looking at him and instead, scanning the lobby over his shoulder.  It took Steve a moment to realize that she was probably looking for reporters, though if she spotted any, they weren’t obvious to Steve.  She handed Steve a keycard and nodded towards the elevator.  “Do you have any questions about the NDA or anything else, Mr. Rogers?”
“What I get out of it? I get--” Tony started in a sharp, abrupt tone, then stopped and stared down at the table in front of him.  Steve waited.  “It would be an honor to be your Omega, Captain,” Tony said in a flat voice.
“He started it,” Tony said hurriedly.
“Good.  Me, too,” Steve replied, letting a grin slip out.
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Tony admitted, pressing his face into Steve’s shoulder so the words came out muffled.  “I know it’s crazy.  I
