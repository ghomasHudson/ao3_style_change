"Whatever."
"He's a kid, Tony. He doesn't understand--"
"And no real fights. Not until you're thirty at least."
Satisfied his youngest wasn't about to be shot down by a pissed off Widow, he turned his attention briefly to Sam, who looked like he might join in the fight between the two versions of Steve Rogers. When he stepped toward them, however, Pep took a pointed step of her own. He loved how unsure of her they were; he'd never given them more than a vague snapshot of what she was still capable of. Given everything currently happening and the history of the Avengers, he absolutely reveled in the way Sam immediately stopped moving, stink-eye now focused on her.

happened then maybe you could get him to calm the fuck down.”
"I should really get a therapist. Fuck." Tony ran his hands down his face, a lost look in his eyes. This was as close to a real fight that they'd had since he'd come back to this world and he hated it. All he wanted to do was go wrap his fella up in his arms and promise to keep anything from hurting him ever again. Wasn't a promise he could keep though, and it wasn't really one that would do Tony any good in the end. Getting up on his feet and moving forward from what had happened to him was going to hurt - there was just no way around it.
Iron Kid
The gauntlet shattered, and Thanos was devoured, screaming, by the Stones he had so arrogantly assumed were his to command.
Maybe a whimper of protest left him when Steve broke that kiss, but nobody could blame him for it.
"My apologies Captain - I had forgotten."
"Hey Winter? Don't... don't go throwin' yourself outta any trains in this fight. I don't wanna lose ya like that again. So if anyone's gotta--"
So if he cancelled this trip he would have to deal with their disappointed faces right away. After that would be anarchy sanctioned by most of the other adults in his life. They'd all been saying he should go for a visit. Well, everyone but Steve anyway. His
"Don't be such a sore loser, Tony," Clint teased, leaning against the genius heavily enough that he swayed toward Steve. It took everything he had not to jerk away, because he knew that would be easily misread. "You're only trying to give away your turn because I'm slaughtering you." Tony's growl prompted an elbow to the side from Clint, and Steve felt his eyes narrow despite himself.
"A pair of jeans would be fine, I believe. And perhaps the blue Henley?"
"Sure." Steve's easy agreement was just shy of patronizing, and from his bright grin he knew it too. After smacking a loud kiss to his cheek the blond left to grab the presents. There were quite a few of them, so he might have to draft Harley and Peter into gift-carrying duty as well. Just as long as they didn't shake any of the boxes - a couple of them had very delicate equipment in them. Getting presents for another him had been nice. He mostly knew what Shellhead liked, and he didn't need to worry about any of his choices being 'too much'.

been in charge of the Avengers, which drew her attention back to him. Hatred burned in her eyes, and he could see red beginning to gather around her fingers.
"Of course we would, that's not the--"
Besides. Too much space and alone time to think probably wasn't good for any of the Avengers. They all had enough issues to make a fleet of psychiatrists as rich as he was.
He laughed at that, because he knew that Steve knew the Senator’s name. The man was a fan, always stumbling over his words and doing his best to get on Captain America’s good side. He had boasted numerous times that they were on speaking terms - practically a first name basis - and Steve had been asking for his name every time they met since. The venerable Senator denied climate change and took a dim view on vaccinations. Between that and the vaguely misogynistic attitude, Steve practically foamed at the mouth when he talked about the politician in private.
But maybe he was just a little more present than Tony had given him credit for. One fist loosened, then turned so his open palm was facing upward. It was easy in that moment to slip his hand there. Steve immediately settled his fingers between Tony's and squeezed.
"But what?"
"If ya say so."
"I was!" STAR piped up, curling further into his throat. "I did. But then this guy showed up and said that he was here to see you and I said over my dead body and Fi-fi said--"
"If Tony makes it'n I don't... I want ya ta take him back to our world. Drag Harley'n Peter'n Rhodey'n... and all-a my people that make it. Take 'em back with ya and try ta keep 'em safe. Don't let them kill themselves tryin' ta 'fix' it. Just... just kidnap 'em ta give 'em a chance ta heal."
"Uh, yeah. Pretty seminal moment in my superhero career. What's going on here Harls?"
scary. I mean, nobody else was... you were so cool, the way you were helping dad do the air support thing, you know? Like, you weren't scared at all I bet, and I wasn't really either. It was just... just different than I thought it would be. And I'm kind of lying, because I was super scared for most of the fight. I just. I guess I really like being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Maybe I'm not cut out for this big league stuff. Nobody else--"
"... I suppose it'll do, Mr. Stark. For now."
"You have to wake up," he whispered, and saw Helen's face melt into something awfully close to sympathy from the corner of his eye.
He sort of liked Lady and Primrose - she was a dignified, polite little thing even as she explored her new home and dealt with her injuries. For some reason he kept coming back to the name Beacon too, but he just wasn't sure. He needed some help but only really wanted it from one person.
He looked over, expecting to see a smile or at least a look of exasperation on Steve's face. Instead he was even paler than usual, lips tight and fists clenched in his lap.
," Rogers answered Steve, voice tight. "I've seen a lot of dirty tricks in my time, but I can't believe you're using my face for this. To prey on Tony for... for..." The man turned bright red and managed to look both furious and constipated, and it was the most unattractive his face had ever looked. "Turning feelings like
STAR burst out of the Nightmare Beast, leaving a gaping wound that Rhodey and Shellhead didn't take immediate advantage of - they were too busy staring at him. Winter, below him, wasn't as useless in the moment. The soldier immediately began to fire into that open wound, widening it, and then Harley zoomed in to follow his example. Almost immediately  the thing gave a death cry, then fell to the earth; as it did, its form wavered and then it was only a twisted piece of metal, no hint of the creature Thanos had turned it into.
"Yeah! We'll be in the mansion. And anyway we're both in long sleeves. So."
But set against that was Rhodey's voice in his ear, whispering encouragement. His honey-bear was the best man he knew and still managed to love him, so maybe Howard had been wrong. Pepper-pot was an excellent judge of character and she hadn't given up on him yet. That meant there was hope, that he wasn't all weakness and bad decisions. He had a team that he had been able to make his family; he was even almost 100% sure they would have his back no matter what.
He had tried really, really hard not to let bitterness and fury taint the title. Going by Peter's widening eyes he hadn't quite managed.
in a kiss after tugging the man down onto his lap. After a fight he always craved contact and intimacy; Steve curled into him like he always did, more than willing to provide. The Defenders greeted him and Steve replied without even trying to pull away to sit in his own chair. Tony would never get over the novelty of having a partner who let him indulge in sweet, mostly chaste public displays of affection.
"If he ever tells you this story, I want you to know that I didn't scream. It was a damn war cry, because I was ready to fight the little bastard. But it ran, so I'm thinking I'm safe, right?" He snorted, then took another pull of beer. "Nope. They're all. Over. The dorm room. Asshole had gone and 'rescued' them while he was drunk because he kept thinking about how they were getting experimented on - which he decided meant torture and certain death. He cried over the damn things, Steve. They were rats, but he was crying like they were puppies dropped off at a kill shelter. It was awful."
Interviewee: Pepper Potts, CEO Stark Industries
"You're a good kid," he told Harley softly, catching just a glimpse of the kid's blush before it disappeared behind Iron Kid's mask. Knowing the teen was serious, he made a conscious effort to slow his breathing; as he did, Steve gave him an encouraging kiss to the cheek.
side in that... but he was so glad they were both there. The only thing that could make it better would be having Rhodey and Viz there too instead of them being at the compound, but he knew at least one of them would be high-tailing it back now that he'd sent his message.
"Yes. No? I mean..." While searching for words, Tony turned and pressed a kiss to his palm. "It sucked," he admitted, lips tickling against Steve's skin. "It sucked a lot." A beat later, his lover hid in his neck again, a small shiver running through his body. "Metric fuck-tons of suck. But I thought it would be worse. Without you and Pepper it would have been."
very flexible and he was finally well enough to reap the benefits of that.
"Yes!" Tony felt his smile grow even broader when Clint pumped his fist up into the air. He'd been hearing Clint lament about how boring all the arrows SHIELD gave him were, how they never let him have anything fun. Tony had boxes full of arrows for Clint in his workshop, just like he had a brand new bow for the archer. There was an upgraded set of Black Widow's Bites too, along with a set of knives that had their own secrets and could be easily hidden. He had at least half a dozen prototypes for new armor for Clint, Nat and Captain America, and all of it was just waiting for him to be brave enough to hand them over.
, but you only get the one. If you vanish again without good cause the Defenders won't need to descend en masse. You'll be far too dead for them to bother."
'Home' now meant the tower for them both, and he was holding out hope that soon the common floor would be filled with warmth and laughter the way he knew Tony had always wanted it to be. Once both Avengers were a little more healed he fully intended on enforcing family time. They all needed it. He could see that from the ghosts in Rhodey's eyes and the way Pepper had almost broken down weeping when she realized he was back.
sorry. Tony, how can you even think about working with them again? After everything they--" Pepper whirled away from him to start pacing, heels snapping sharp enough against the floor that he expected to see sparks. Her face was a beautiful mask of rage, and the way the ends of her hair were starting to twist and curl had nothing to do with her movement. No, the heat wafting off her body was causing it to stir, and he had the idle thought that maybe he was about to see her control snap for the first time since she'd fought so hard to get it.
?" Tony's outraged demand was met with laughter from
So this is the third time I've rewritten these two chapters. I decided I wasn't happy with them once and - in a fit of ill-tempered and impetuous writer's pique - I deleted them in such a way that I couldn't recover them. I tried again but it was garbage because I was still mad about losing the first attempts which I had decided were not that bad.
That line of thinking reminded him of his scotch, and he kept right on ignoring the room as he reached for a tumbler. One shot wouldn't be enough to see him through once Steve left him, or it wouldn't if he was still a person who drank. Since this was all about temptation - some would say self-sabotage - and symbolism, the bigger cup was the right move to make. He even filled it with ice as he refused to try and listen in to what was going on between Steve and his
“Oh, so when he does something wrong he’s
"Yeah, but you and Thor are muscle-buddies and Nat's the deadlier murder twin. You guys were bonding over mutual toughness, not... not..." Tony didn't seem to know how to finish that sentence, so he trailed off instead. Even if Steve couldn't see his face, he got the impression that the man was pouting.
"How dare."
Tony was careful not to let himself hope his childhood hero would come along. Careful to the point where he didn't even look at the guy, actually. He felt Captain America's steady gaze on him though, and he was pretty sure the man looked between him and Clint a few times.
"What the
"No." Harley sounded resigned but looked determined, and he realized that he was in for a long, long day of being mother henned. He didn't mind very much. "No he won't."
“I… Tony did you see what… what… son? I’m not su- is this some kinda prank?”
While Pep gave a 'sorry' full of laughter, Steve swayed gently into his side. Both things in combination killed that tiny kernel of genuine hurt he otherwise would have harbored and let fester
Tony loved the twinkle of mischief in those blue eyes while he was fucking with people and they were too caught up in the legends about him to notice.
"So what do you think?" When he didn't get an immediate answer, it took everything he had not to snarl at the woman standing between the two hospital beds. "Helen!"
Loki lavished the pair of them with gifts and was teaching them all his favorite tricks. Tony still didn't trust the fucker, but he was so damn nice to the kids that it was hard not to like him a little. He almost saw what Other Tony saw in Lokes... not that he would ever admit it.
"Pep. You have never wanted that. I've been Iron Man for years and you never... you
"Was that your word of the day? Is this all a ploy to use it in a sentence?"
Peter had slunk in not too long after Laney had fallen asleep, his shoulders hunched like he thought Harley would turn him away. He'd rolled his eyes even though his brother couldn't see it and lifted the covers in invitation. Peter had accepted immediately and laid down on Laney's other side, snuggling in with a quiet sigh. Harley had managed to stay in the bed for probably an hour longer before he had slipped into his chair to start his quiet vigil. Laney had grumbled a little in her sleep, then turned and latched on to Peter... who Harley was pretty sure was still wide-awake and staring at the ceiling.
? What the fuck?
"Pops, I'm gonna need you to breathe," Harley urged in his ear, cutting through some of the fear and hurt swirling inside of him. "If you can't do that I'm getting you out of here."
The smile that bloomed on his
"Thanks Tony."
“Lies!”
"Captain, Ms. Potts would like me to assure you that the doors will open in a little less than an hour. She offers her sincerest apologies for Sir."
"She's here when you're ready. I'll have my people call your people, set something up. Will that be all, Ms. Potts?"
Howard’s harsh, ugly laughter in his ear reminded him how impossible that was. He was too old, too broken. Steve wouldn’t want someone like him, deserved someone way better. It was just his imagination and just more proof of how pathetic he was. Captain America overlooking his weaknesses and how soft he really was inside to be his friend was more than he could have hoped for. Reaching for the stars to try for more would only get him burned.
Jan had captured both Peter and Harley's hearts, and they were huddled together showing off memes and cat pictures one last time before she went off to her own world. He had a feeling he was in for a world of begging in a day or two, and that it would continue until he caved and invited her for a visit. Both boys were starstruck, and she was certainly taking her sweet time in joining the other Defenders. She was absolutely going to be their new favorite aunt.
"I know. Now. Let's start with the basics."
"Right. Promised my Spider-kid we'd have a day of science and exploration together. I think that mostly means she's going to drag me to a couple different museums and then force me to buy her lunch."
. Please.
"We'll surface for your food probably. I missed your potato salad more than I missed you, to be honest." Loki came up behind Shellhead and slipped his arms around the man's waist. It was still really fucking weird to see a version of him cuddling up to the guy who had turned New York into a battleground in
Even beyond the dimmers, the workshop was darker than it usually was with at least half the lights turned out. Tony - who didn't seem to realize he had come in - was pacing at the far end, one hand constantly running through and tugging at his hair. Seemed to be arguing with himself too, though Steve couldn't make out more than a few mumble 'what ifs' along with his own name. It hurt seeing the man so worked up over seeing him, and he was on the verge of just leaving because Christ Tony should not be nervous about them being in the same room... but then he saw it.
, and you'd be better for him anyway."
If you would please let me finish a sentence, Ms. Potts.
"Peter isn't any older than me."
And sure, they spent a lot of time there, but not
That's-- I-- no! I have questions, Ms. Potts, ones that I would like the answer to.
and rolled over to bury his face in Steve's pillow... only for his left shoulder to spasm painfully and begin to ache. He swore and shifted onto his back again, trying to figure out what the fuck he'd done to his arm.
Looked like maybe that time was finally here.
For all that I had to get there from a private elevator shared with only my photographer and a glowering member of the security team, the apartment I eventually entered was surprisingly normal. I say apartment, but of course the mysterious Maverick lives just shy of the very top of Stark Tower and occupies an entire floor. The living room was large and spacious, with a partially open plan that lets it look into the kitchen. I never got to that other room to see the full thing, but I could see that their refrigerator was covered with papers. One image in particular stood out, a picture of Iron Man in a bright pink tutu that was obviously drawn by a child, while another paper had an 'A+' clearly visible on one corner.
"I had plans, you Star Spangled jerk," Tony whispered between chuckles before pressing another too-smiley kiss against his lips.
"I love her." Pepper suddenly turned and launched herself into his arms. He caught her with a soft 'oof', then hugged her back just as tight. When he lifted her up off her feet, she yelped and began smacking his back, but she didn't demand to be put down while he spun her in a circle. She did whack his arm a few times when he finally did lower her to her feet. He figured that was fair. "Thank you Tony. But I'm not... I can't..."
The beer that sprayed out of his mouth after the question landed on the couch instead of Rhodes which was a real fucking shame in his opinion. His face was flaming, Rhodes was laughing, and he wished he could just sink into the ground and disappear. Steve tossed the bottle caps at the other man, who evaded them easily as he sank back into the couch. Nobody talked about his... his thing for Tony. Nobody except Nat anyway, so the sudden confrontation was…

Soul was passionate rage, judgement and mercy and vengeance and so many other things without name. Together they advanced, three Entities who had chosen freedom against two that half-heartedly obeyed Thanos. Mind kept out of it - Soul had known it would, after the last experience it had had with Thanos. It would not aid them, but it would not try to stop them either. They did not need it to complete their task, and so they did not ask it to choose a side.
The house itself wasn't as small as he'd expected. Even when they had first moved i-- when they'd first
Before he could send a query that way, glaive guy burst free and made right for the chick with the spear. Captain Marvel didn't need to be told to get out of dodge; she turned her back on spear chick like she wasn't worth the dirt on Captain Marvel's shoes. It was beautiful and savage, even if Tony knew half her attention was still on Thanos' little girl, just in case his plan didn't work out the way it was supposed to. The leader of the Avengers threw herself into thinning out the nearby demon-dogs, and Tony watched as glaive guy took the bait.
“J, on a scale from one to Reykjavik how bad was the bird’s offense?”
It was more frustrating to watch SHIELD provide his team with shitty weapons and poorly designed armor. He hated how bland and boring SHIELD's HQ was, hated that the team members who lived there probably didn't have much to do in their downtime. How the hell was Captain America supposed to adjust to the future when all he had around him was a series of white walls, stoic faces and people who treated him like he was made out of glass?
"But you'll do it?"
"Harley Keener! We
Harley was right beside him too, a moral support who would fling himself into any altercation that started. The kid had a heart of gold, the courage of a lion, and all the impulse control of a cranky toddler. Tony loved him dearly.
"I know. But this is what I wanna do. This is what feels right ta me. So. Ya gonna fight me on this, or are we gonna put our heads together and figure out how to break this to da?"
Tony didn't want to meet any of them before then. Steve was bowing to those wishes despite his own curiosity and didn't even browse the dossiers Fri had been compiling.
"Probably since you hosted Christmas here that first year. That was when I knew anyway. Not sure if da's figured it out or not."
"I'll give ya a rubdown later as a thanks. Maybe even a sexy one." If neither of them were too tired, anyway, which had happened a lot since waking up after the battle. Getting away from all the demands on their time might help fix that. He hoped it would, because otherwise he was out of ideas. Lokes would have some though, and so probably would Loki and both Doctors Strange. The side effect wouldn't last forever, probably, and with enough downtime surely they would both get back to being 100%.
!" The squirrel sounded just as scandalized as she did, and Steve fought back the laugh that wanted to escape. They certainly were a pair. "He's my best friend and his name is name is Tappy and I won't leave him behind ever!" Suddenly she was fierce as anything, and she bared her teeth at him in a display that was surprisingly intimidating. "And I won't go back either! They tried to
And between the protective rage he saw in Pepper's eyes, the cold fury he saw in Steve's and STAR's bloodthirsty nature... he felt pretty goddamn safe, and it let him stand tall as he watched the elevator. Hell, he almost felt
Tony might have been pissed, except that Steve had just said ‘our son’ and ‘our other kids’ and his brain was maybe short-circuiting a lot.
Are you saying you won't cooperate, Ms. Potts?
It was enough to make him laugh, though it didn't last long. Laughing hurt, and it quickly trailed off into a wheezing groan.
"You had four and a half more years before I would have gotten worried."
“It wasn’t even that big a deal, honest. I mean, when he tells you the story it might sound kind of bad, but that’s why I raced here--”
"Listen my darling little love-bug. If you let them change the name of

An unacceptable failure that still could have been much, much worse.
It was enough to get me thinking about the characters again instead of angsting over how they're going to fuck over my precious cinnamon roll in the next film, because Tony Stark Deserves Better, Dammit but I know he probably won't get it. But anyway, now that's only like... half my Marvel feels? The rest are happy ones where I am ready to engage in the fandom again, so. With that I am hopeful that I can get on a schedule, but I probably should stop promising that.
"Shhh… sorry, sweetheart. Forgot you're still hurtin' for a minute. Our little Starry Skies is makin' some food for us. Should be back in here soon, I think."
." Right, right. Moving and shooting. Because the Nightmare Beast was... was... "Tony? Tony!"
"Babe? Chill. Drink your coffee." Shellhead turned piercing blue eyes his way, and Tony swallowed reflexively. "Would you come if we asked? If... when the Thanos of our world comes knocking, would you help us?"
Ooh, that icy tone of voice meant absolutely nothing good for him. For her to sound that calm while being so pissed off was a danger sign from days of old, long before flames licking over the backs of her hands signaled an imminent meltdown. The way she'd schooled her expression was a lie too, because he knew from experience that this was the calm before the storm. It was going to be the storm of the century this time if he didn't get things back under control.
"Butterfingers won't take nothin' that's really special, you know? I left my compass down here once or twice'n it was always right where I left it. When I left those swanky colored pencils you bribed me with he didn't bother those neither. So he he knows, you know? That some stuff isn't for taking'n that some things aren't for playing with. And U's always trying to manage his brothers, same as you are. Has about as much success as you too." He was afraid to look up at Tony, terrified that maybe he was getting this all wrong. "He looks out for 'em, tries to make sure they won’t go poking at things that'd hurt 'em. And yeah, he runs over my feet but I know he feels bad about it. Whenever it happens he brings me somethin' before I leave, some little scrap of metal that he's shaped or once a bit of some glass or something that he polished until it was mirror-bright. Just you watch - he'll give me something to say 'sorry' before I get outta the room, bet your bottom dollar."
"Awww. Ya old softy."
"I don't think the Cradle would help, James." Her voice was so fucking gentle that he wanted to smack her, which was just.. fuck. So far beneath him. He needed a nap, and a shower, some food, and for his best friend to
Happy was fond of him in his own way, but most of that was shown indirectly. It wasn't hugs and friendly touches, wasn't a hand resting on his shoulder to help him find a way to face himself and the world. Pepper had been even stiffer a first. The cutting remarks she'd made the first few times he got touchy-feely had almost been enough to make him bleed. Now that she saw the lack of intent behind it she was better about pressing gentle touches to his forearm and letting him do the same. She sent warm smiles his way whenever he took something directly from her hands and no longer teased him about his shitty decisions. Well, not as much and not in the same way. Her judgments didn't make him feel like crying or dying anymore - he could take them in stride because it was so obvious that she loved him the same way Rhodey did.

) can get in the way of his own happiness sometimes, so it’s hard to know if Steve’s preparing to rage at him for deliberately ignoring his lack of consent.
When they hit the ground, hard and jarring, and Tony thinks he blacks out from the sheer impact on both sides, the entirety of Steve’s mutated weight landing directly on his chest – one second there’s an explosion of pain and pressure from the crash, the gel substance that lines his undersuit expanding as it absorbs his impact before it bursts entirely, and the next second he’s being attacked by something he cannot see, his suit utterly dead and eyes stinging from sweat, gel, and fuck knows what else. Whatever it is –
for Tony, and in literally any situation Tony would take that as gospel and celebrate the boundaries being drawn.
He’s perfectly aware that Steve knows he’s here – everything in the tower is glass, including the hospital level, and while it can go opaque to block out any onlookers for privacy reasons, Steve’s eyes are so sharp that he’s always been able to somewhat see through. Furthermore, there’s also the fact that the observation room that Tony’s in has been very empty, all of Steve’s visitors simply popping in his private room to keep him company rather than sequestering themselves away. He’s not sure who else – besides perhaps Fury – would not just go inside the room to keep Steve company, since even Natasha wanders into Steve’s room.

The doors to Steve’s cell slide open, and Steve stalks forward.
He must not be out long because by the time he comes back to himself, Steve’s laid out on top of him and whining pitifully, hips carefully still despite the fact that his massive prick is throbbing inside Tony’s body, even more come mixing with the seven other loads in obvious spurts he can physically feel inside him. Tony deliriously wonders – not for the first time – if Steve’s self-aware enough to know that Tony can’t take movement against his battered, oversensitive insides when he himself has gotten off, even though it must be excruciatingly difficult for Steve to remain still while he’s coming, but the thought fades away for a long moment of blissful, post-orgasmic lassitude.

There’s still a glimmer of fear though – not for the situation they’re in, not even for Steve’s condition exactly, but more like fear of Steve’s inevitable hatred and feelings of deep betrayal, courtesy of one Tony Stark. It’s going to be devastatingly painful when Steve justifiably tells him to leave, and a small, dark, hateful part of Tony wishes that he’d stay like—no.
God, but he wants to touch himself. He’s not hard really, the lack of stimulation on his own prick ensuring that he doesn’t stiffen up past a sensitive swell, but he wants to snake a hand beneath him so he can fondle himself. He’s dripping from the prostate stimulation, balls heavy underneath him, and it wouldn’t take much to stroke himself to a full erection. He doesn’t though – it takes all of his energy to keep himself on his aching knees and forearms, weighed down by Steve’s dense heft and completely swallowed by pleasure, and he knows from personal experience that once he fully gets off, it’ll be

So he supposes it’s expected that his prick is swollen and leaking onto the grass beneath them, that he’s swallowing moans as pleasure and just-right pain radiates from his arse to even the tips of his fingers as he creeps closer to orgasm, that his body is instinctively pushing back into Steve’s thrusts just slightly even though he tries to make himself stop.

, and despite the desperation Tony can see in Steve’s eyes – he might be fooling himself, but he thinks he sees just as much grief and sadness as he does mindless desire – Tony’s even more resolute in his decision.
Still, Steve doesn’t acknowledge him outside of the long, expressionless glance towards the glass that separates them. Tony’s torn between paralysing fear that Steve’s intentionally ignoring him and the desperate hope that maybe Natasha’s not completely wrong. Tony doesn’t have the best track record with reading people when it comes to any sort of positive reinforcement or emotion, and Tony’s self-aware enough to know that his own innate self-flagellation (

The nurses advance and do the usual checks – manual vitals rather than reading his internal implant’s data, manoeuvring his limbs as best they can when he’s still knotted, getting him prepped for an IV – while Bruce answers, “Natasha finally got Johnson to spill where her lab was, and the raid was earlier this morning. We found all her notes, formulas, and vials of both the compound and an antidote. I have it on me, I’m just—er—not sure exactly how to go about this?”
He’s being pummelled, Tony’s body draped over a plush and sweat-drenched stool to give his arms and chest a break, utterly surrounded by Steve’s bulk as he scrapes his teeth along the sensitive skin of Tony’s neck. His stomach is bloated from come, so much of it he can almost feel it soaking into every atom of his body, and he’s blind with pleasure, his left hand frantically jerking himself off because he can tell instinctively that Steve’s almost sated, seven loads inside him and dripping down his trembling thighs. He’s so raw that it’s physically painful to touch himself like this, but he’s incapable of stopping after hours upon hours of orgasms that tear through every nerve ending in his body, blazing and agonising and so fucking

He trails off, listening to Steve’s whines and staring into Steve’s big, blue eyes, and then says with amusement, “Natasha says you love me, which is insane and totally irrelevant, if I’m honest – if she hadn’t helped me in here, I would’ve found another way because I’m good like that. I didn’t need her trying to sell me a pitch that’s completely impossible anyway, because I was going to do it anyway without all the manipulation, y’know? Still, I can’t blame her, I guess, moving in on my soft side. Look, what I’m trying to say is don’t be mad at her, yeah? She’s trying to help you too, and she’s making sure that I’m safe under punishment of being locked up indefinitely if I try to pull a fast one. She’s on your side, okay? Fuck, what am I even saying, you can’t even understand me right now, you’re apparently a werewolf or something and English is completely outside of your abilities right no—I’m stalling, aren’t I?

He sometimes thinks he always has been.
The fourteen hours that Steve had been mutated back to his normal self gave them some insight, though, not to mention gave Steve the opportunity to rehydrate himself and gorge himself on calories for the next mutation. He’d detailed how he ran into Johnson, how it felt to mutate both into and from the wolf-like creature, and what he was feeling and experiencing while he was mutated. The others had given Steve’s inputs to Tony in flat, impersonal bullet points – making multiple, heavy-handed efforts to emphasise that Steve wasn’t a doctor and there was no scientific proof to his claims – but Tony could read between the lines: Steve had felt saner and more in control when he’d been...busy with Tony.

Which, fair. It had been Tony’s Plan B, after all.
And...he’s not sure what to think about what they’d eventually told him, because apparently Steve had apparently confirmed that he only wanted two things when he was mutated: to feed and fuck.
All of the armour along Tony’s front is completely ripped off in short order, even despite Tony’s frantic efforts to stop it, and he can hear Steve growling, a low and rumbling sound that makes every single hair on Tony’s body stand on end despite the thick gel weighing it down. The fear is bright and wicked, Tony still choking on lingering fluid even as he hyperventilates, and he hears himself gasp out a high-pitched “
He mulls and plots and tries his damndest to work out a plan as Avengers and doctors come in and out of his hospital room, coming up with ideas that he quickly throws away almost as quickly as he thinks them up, and he’s almost to the point of frustrated tears and uncontrollable screaming by the time Natasha finally makes her appearance.
He can barely see her, definitely can’t suss out her expression (not that he’d be able to read her well anyway), but doesn’t hesitate to breathe out in a weak croak, “

while he drives his hips back urgently, everything shivery and over-bright as he’s fucked through it.
“If I can make a suggestion,” Tony says in a hum, eyelids fluttering as he fights the urge to sleep, “I would recommend waiting until I don’t have a knot in me, Brucie-bear. That’d be vaguely awkward, don’t you think?”
Steve’s mutating into, somehow hooking his arms around what he vaguely thinks might be Steve’s waist. He doesn’t have time to even figure that out though because JARVIS is putting every iota of power into the thrusters, trying to get the suit to negate the downwards velocity so they don’t

Natasha huffs out a sound that might be a laugh and says, “I heard what you said over the comms and while you’re not wrong in thinking that I absolutely would’ve used that tactic to give Steve a chance, you’re also not wrong that I didn’t need to. You were going to find a way regardless, so there wasn’t any tactical advantage in trying to manipulate you. I said it because you deserved to know, just in case something went wrong and we couldn’t fix him because I swear, at the rate you two were going, I’m fairly certain that both of you were going to go to the grave without saying a word. It was exhausting, not just for me but for the entire team at this point because it’s not like either one of you boys were subtle to anyone except each other.”

Something prickles in the air, a feeling that Tony’s wasted brain is incapable of processing, and there’s a loud snarl at his back, a snap of teeth, a bellow of surprised pain, and then Steve’s
He can tell by the heavy, but careful heaviness of Steve’s weight that he’s done for this round, and the last knot is always the longest, a good fifteen minutes or so rather than the spare few minutes in the heat of Steve’s rut. It’s probably a good thing, because Steve’s insatiable until he’s finally spent, and he doesn’t take his prick out of Tony’s body until he’s completely done.
come, and his stomach cramps painfully as it distends even further, the intensity of everything in combination blacking out Tony’s vision completely.
It’s frantic at first, Tony barely managing to catch his breath in between bouts, but then it steadies.
The situation with Steve was complicated, according to Bruce, and in a decidedly not-good way. Steve’s metabolism wasn’t breaking down the compound that triggered the mutation, to everyone’s collective surprise, and in the almost-five days since he’d been quarantined, he’d been violently aggressive to any and all people outside of his fourteen hours of sanity. He wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t hydrate, wouldn’t do anything but attack when anyone came into his cell for samples, and it was wreaking havoc on his body: rapid weight loss, constant aggression and stress that was unsustainable even for Steve’s impressive constitution, and hormonal imbalances that were just downright

One second, he’s fighting like everyone else, multitasking by kicking some serious HYDRA arse as he scans the far-distant base for any shielding or irregularities, which could be the indicator they need for if this is the home of their prize. The mission is the sceptre, after all, and with his suit as well as JARVIS’s eye from satellites, he’s the most qualified to take point on that particular job while the rest of the Avengers clear the area of combatants.
Tony’s so wasted that he barely even reacts when Steve takes him again.
“Well,” Tony says, his voice coming out strained and small, “I’d suggest two separate rooms so he doesn’t immediately come to kill me for—for taking away—for—” And to his horror, the exhaustion and bone-deep relief and endorphins and anxiety and fear and regret all release at once from the deepest pit of his heart, a hoarse sob tearing out his throat. Another one follows, then another, and suddenly he’s crying, harsh and vicious, and he can’t fucking breathe from the debilitating force of it all. He wants to curl up in a ball and sink into the floor, wants to

when he says so. Except his brain is whirling with possibilities and complications, trying to figure out ways to bypass security protocol and the bodyguards and scientists that are absolutely posted at every square foot outside of Steve’s isolation pod. The security is easy, but the flesh and blood people are a different story. If SHIELD was still running, it would’ve been easy – Fury would’ve helped Tony inside in a heartbeat, because as much as they had butted heads, Fury had still been good at being pragmatic in the face of the greater good. If it could save Captain America, and if Tony gave his word that he could buy time until a cure or treatment could be developed, he’d be rational enough to deal with the immediate dangers.

Steve back, not just for himself but for Steve too. There’s no way that Steve would ever do something like this without his partner’s consent, and whatever that motherfucker did to him is cruel and horrifying, twisting him physically and mentally until all he’s capable of doing is rutting into Tony, his odd-shaped prick so unbelievable large that he doesn’t even slip out once.
Steve’s cold nose drags up Tony’s damp neck, the sounds of his deep inhales loud in Tony’s ears, and then his hips start jerking again, slow at first before picking up speed. It feels deeper and more misshapen this time, the pain at his rim spiking sharply before it dulls quickly, and Tony knows that it’s because the knot’s deflated now, allowing the entirety of Steve’s prick to pound inside his body, every thrust accompanied by the soft fur inside Steve’s hips. The lewd squelch of his still-hard prick thrusting into Tony is even louder, his insides drenched with Steve’s come, and Tony shudders violently, fingers digging into the grass and dirt to keep his balance as Steve starts thrusting harder and harder and

He can feel the prick inside him swelling again, the base of it catching on his sore rim, and it’s so
Tony doesn’t even register that he’s changing course and rocketing downwards until he’s already halfway to Steve, the inversion of direction so sudden that his vision tunnels from the g-force, nearly knocking him unconscious. It’s mostly JARVIS’s manoeuvring that allows him to get his arms around the massive bulk of...whatever in the
All he can think of is quiet nights in Avengers Tower, Steve laughing at films the rest of the team has decided is imperative for Steve’s twenty-first century education, Steve trying to convince Tony to accept a monthly payment from his military back pay in order to cover rent as well as the frankly obscene amount of food he consumes and frowning when Tony rolls his eyes, Steve painstakingly refurbishing things that he accidentally breaks like the microwave when he accidentally nukes aluminium foil or doors when he forgets his own strength – so many little moments that are integral to their team, their

“Okay,” she says.

admitted him that it made some biological sense, because the chemicals and hormones Steve either had too much or too little of in his mutated state were definitely correlating with libido as well as his aggression and anxiety. Considering what he’d instinctively and

The human food, animal kibble, and dead animals hadn’t interested him at all, Bruce had said quietly, so they figured it needed to be fresh, which unmutated Steve was adamant against despite his serum-enhanced body burning through calories at a meteoric rate. Furthermore, he didn’t want to fuck just anything or anyone – according to Steve, all he wanted was

“I told you,” Helen grumbles. Then she adds in a louder voice, “We’ll wait until the penile ridge deflates and then get you out of the room—”
All Tony can do is try his damndest to hold on, twisting his body as much as JARVIS will allow him to so he’s underneath the massive, hair-covered bulk.
“On it,” says Tony, heart in his throat as his vision goes even sharper with single-minded focus, darting around trees as he shoots towards Steve’s location, blinking in bright blue on his HUD. He’s the closest, and while he’s supposed to be primary on scanning the HYDRA base, Thor and Natasha are just as capable as he is. Tony blasts a few goons barrelling through the trees as he asks urgently, “Cap, d’you read? What’s your status?”
Tony’s not even remotely interested in
Tony pokes at his green jello with a fork and does what he does best: hyperfixate and overthink.
He can’t even cry anymore – he just lets it happen even though it’s unbearably painful and raw, covered in sweat and dirt and blades of grass and long blond strands. He suffers through it, letting out small sounds of pain with every brutal thrust inside, and then chokes out a dry sob when the knot expands again, another flood of come making his guts cramp constantly as his belly distends even further. After he settles again, this time on top of Tony, Steve bathes him, licking at the sweat on his neck and back and arms, teeth occasionally scraping along his flesh.
That’s enough for Tony, and he takes stock of Steve’s seizing body to work out how to stabilise him enough to fly them both without Steve destroying the suit. The closest is Landstuhl he thinks, only about fifty kilometres northwest he thinks, so he tries to get his laboured breathing under control before he interrupts, “Got it. Taking him to Landstuhl outside of Ramstein, so meet us there.”
, Tony’s
Tony kind of wants to laugh, because despite the fact that this certainly isn’t the first time Bruce has seen this now, it’s still distantly amusing that he’s still so weirded out by it all. It’s been days at least, probably longer, and Tony himself would’ve been inoculated by the crazy by now. Or maybe Tony’s just weirder than most, and the endorphins swirling in his blood are making him even more woozy than normal.
According to the team, the mission had gone pretty much according to plan, other than Steve’s mutation – they hadn’t found the sceptre (unsurprisingly) but they’d found a horde of information regarding other HYDRA bases within Europe and Asia to hit next instead (this one had been surprising, actually, since HYDRA’s pretty good about keeping under the radar). They’d rolled up to the hostile that Tony’d restrained – a woman named Tilda Johnson according to SHIELD’s old databases – and put her in the quinjet once they’d salvaged everything and rounded up any of the HYDRA agents. She’d still been unconscious, but they’d found a syringe with an unknown substance inside and bagged it, quickly taking off to Landstuhl to get to Steve and Tony. They hadn’t made it but a kilometre towards the hospital when JARVIS had finally gotten their notice, directing them to Tony’s crash zone, and they’d restrained Steve – who’d gotten his teeth into Thor in the process – in one of the quinjet’s holding cells before getting Tony inside, taking off immediately and calling for Helen because of the alarming state Tony’d apparently been in.
Toni tilted her head to the side. “Probably…” Glancing to the side, she grabbed his bag from underneath the bed—
“Could be both. Pepper used to complain about the temperature in the Tower but I like it on the chilly side. Ooh! We’ll get you a weighted blanket and you’ll be right as rain.”
“It’s this tone you get in your voice, like you’re holding in so much emotion it weighs down your vocal chords. Makes your voice a little deeper…to give your words more importance,” she explained stroking her fingers down the front of his throat.
Smiling, she squeezed his thumb but didn’t let go and suddenly he was reminded of a handshake that perhaps went on a little too long, as if neither participant wanted to let go that time either. If he’d known it was the last time he’d ever shake that hand he’d probably be still holding on right now.
must have noticed a change in her expression because he reached for her. “Toni—”
“I told you no, Barnes. I’m not doing that and no amount of groveling can make me.”
Squeezing her slender fingers, he motioned to the plate. “You want to try your luck?”
since his day and in the beginning he’d been mildly flustered at all of the skin women chose to show. He wasn’t sure if he was a less is more type of guy and he fully respected a woman’s right to wear whatever the hell she wanted, but he had to own up to the fact that those pants on Toni were something else. They supported and accentuated every curve, moving and sticking to her body like a second skin. A part of him felt like he shouldn’t be looking but he couldn’t help himself. His eyes were just drawn to the way the fabric hugged her ass and her thighs, how it tapered down to nice legs and strong calves.
Sitting at the kitchen counter with his sketchbook open in front of him, Steve found himself shading in familiar dark eyes with lovely long lashes. He’d made it a point to draw both Tonys side by side, one eying the other with amusement. Having actual downtime to draw wasn’t something he’d brought into the future with him. There was always work to be done or things he needed to catch up on. At most he’d find himself doodling during check ins with Fury. Now that he could enjoy his artsy side again he realized how much he’d missed it. After mentioning it briefly to Toni she’d placed an order for some serious high grade supplies; hence the art nook in his room.
calls kept going to voicemail. And then Jarvis mentioned some Captain…”
“After helping us get rid of Thanos and getting his family back from the great dusting, he decided to take a much needed leave of absence from the hero life. He just wants to watch his kids grow up. Can’t blame him.”
Steve nodded and fixed himself a plate. “You don’t have to call me Cap you know…”
Toni smirked. “Sam Wilson I presume? Mm. Well I guess if anyone’s earned retirement it’s the hundred year old guy. You could train people though. Not everyone has such a promising tactical mind.” She yawned and rubbed at her eyes. “Anyway so while you were getting your beauty sleep I managed to get in touch with some of the team and they’ll be rolling by later. I didn’t tell them why I needed them. You’re more of a…see with your own eyes type deal.”
Steve smiled.
Bucky shrugged as innocently as he could manage. “It wouldn’t actually be a replica of Natasha. Like I don’t want it to look like her or whatever but I
“Oh so this is about Howard?”
Steve rounded the corner in a tight white t-shirt and grey sweatpants. Or maybe it was a regular t-shirt and just tight on him. “I’ve probably said thank you a lot but I am grateful for all of your help Toni,” he said softly.
Toni snorted as her helmet retracted. “You have Nat to that for that. I
“For what it’s worth I’m glad Ultron didn’t get a chance to mess things up here. I know how much you mean to Toni and how heartbroken my Tony was to lose you. He never said but it was obvious.”
“I have no problem with you being on top if that’s what you prefer.”
Steve nodded. “Likewise. I guess this must be really strange for you.”
“Hm.” Rhodey folded his arms across his chest. “Strange to think there was room for two of those assholes. Or more.”
getting to see it—and man was it a sight to see—but her eyes zeroed in on the large burn marks along his back shoulder. The skin was angry and red, and looked painful as hell. With a jolt she was crossing the room and maneuvering Steve into the bathroom where the lights could be adjusted.
Pepper smiled. “I’m sure I will. You seem to like him. Don’t get me wrong I’m happy you’re making new friends, Toni. I realize now that I’m running your company and we aren’t dating anymore that we probably don’t spend as much time together. It’s nice to see you not locked up in your workshop all of the time with DUM-E and You. As wonderful as they are you still need to see the sunlight every once and a while.”
. How sincere and sweet and just a little bit clueless he’d been, when it came to women anyway. But willing to lay down his life for anyone who needed his help.
Bucky was staring at where his hands were clasped together on the counter, and Steve could hear Natasha’s earlier words echoing throughout his mind.
James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes took one look at Steve and literally vaulted over the couch, landing in front of Toni with a forceful thud. He had two serious looking guns pointed directly in Steve’s face a second later. “Stark get back! Now!”
appeared to be their prime objective.
Thankfully he was saved by Jarvis. “Ma’am Colonel Rhodes’ flight has almost reached Newark Airport. He should be here within the hour if traffic permits.”
They made their way back inside and she finally remembered that her clothes were still damp. “Jarvis did the stuff I asked Pepper to get arrive yet or do I need to start on a highly disappointing email?”
the fridge. He just…picked it up and eased it away from the wall and set it aside as if it were a pile of dirty laundry. The muscles in his biceps hardened but it was obviously no strain for him. He didn’t even have to grunt with the effort. He just did it. Plucked up the bracelet afterwards and handed it to Judith with a smile. “Here you go.”
Yet it had been nice to help alleviate some of Steve’s sorrow; to cuddle with him and gaze out at the city lights as he sorted through the shit in his head. Back in the day the very
“Yeah that sounds like something a Stark would say.” Steve snickered, feeling better about, well just feeling better. He was still going to talk to Toni about Siberia however. He just needed to. “Toni made plans for us to hang out but afterwards if you want to go for a run or whatever I’m down. See who’s faster.”
. You remember that?”
Steve watched his plate go around and around while Natasha’s words danced a two step inside of his head. It had only been what, two days since landing in this bizarre world so honestly he hadn’t had much time to do anything besides hold on. But if it took Strange a bit to figure stuff out, he could be here for weeks. Hell, months. What happened if he got used to everything? To training with Bucky and living in the Tower. To this new Tony… Not to mention what if Natasha was right? What if he somehow got back to 1945 and Peggy didn’t remember him being there at all?

that timeline but it would be as if he were never there or—and this is what we’d be hoping for—as if he left. ‘Cause if he was there and left that’s easier to explain than having to start from scratch. I can’t be sure without a peek or evidence and I think I might need Strange for that.” Toni closed the hologram. “Providing he is willing to help me. I was worried he’d be more concerned about Steve being here but he didn’t really bat an eyelash. I guess

“But you can’t just jump into the Quantum Realm and expect it to usher you where you need to go. You’d need directions.” Her nose scrunched. “Or a map. Or…GPS. Tony Prime made you a time/space GPS didn’t he? Christ that’s brilliant! I’m kinda attracted to myself right now I just want you to know that. More so than usual.”
Natasha—who now had her own weapons drawn on him—regarded Toni with a skeptical eye. “If he’s not a threat then who he is? A wayward Skrull? I thought there were rules about who they could turn into?”
Steve chuckled. “I’m guessing Toni isn’t short for Anthony?”
His brows rose towards his hairline. “How are you going to prove I am who I say I am? I really don’t have a stamp, Toni, but if you want to look that bad…”

one but from what you’re describing and you being here, it sort of sounds like you tangled with a Time Wraith,” she explained giddily. “They hate temporal disturbances and if there is one big enough, supposedly they try to correct it. You’re probably carrying a ton of time energy because of all the jumping you’ve done and that energy drew them to you. A man out of time trying to fit into another time permanently? Oh yeah they’d be all over that shit.
“It would be my pleasure to assist you Captain Rogers,” Jarvis said effortlessly. “At the very least I’m sure you will want more clothes.”
She grinned. “Sure. You can retire here and become Toni’s new assistance. She couldn’t stop singing your praises when we spoke.”
Bucky smirked. “There is a difference between glancing and checking out, but it’s fine. Stark’s hot—even I can admit that and she’s set my shower to ice cold for a month. There’s nothing wrong with looking.”
“In general?”
“Some things seem the same but I wouldn’t assume. But it’s obvious you’re someone I can trust, and I know if there is anyway
“No Toni, no.” He stood. “I—seeing you—seeing you or any version of you would never cause me bad thoughts. All of this is just unexpected and it—it’s been a long day. I feel like I haven’t slept in months.”
One minute he’d had his Cap uniform in an old duffle bag, telling Peggy they needed a safer place to keep it instead of their closet—
Bucky grabbed two bottles of water from the fridge. “Hey I’ve slept in worse places. Sorry though to interrupt whatever weird thing you were currently doing.”
Finishing his food, he rinsed his bowl and placed it in the sink. Soft footsteps sounded and he watched as Toni padded into the room in comfortable looking pajamas with her damp hair up in a tight bun. She flopped down onto the couch and put a pillow into her lap, smiling as he stepped around and into view. He returned her smile and sat down beside her, resting his feet on an ottoman.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh. He’d been doing that quite a bit in the last twenty-four hours and it felt good. “Why do you deserve that, Toni?”
boss!” Toni chuckled before sobering a little. “Rhodey and I fight and I always feel terrible afterwards, even if it wasn’t my fault because he’s just…he’s
behind his eyes. An entire relationship with a man who was me but isn’t me.”
superheroes having to register with their governments. I didn’t like anyone having that aspect of power. Tony thought that type of oversight was needed. In the end I suppose it didn’t matter since they turned out to be such a small part of our beginning conflict.”
Judith scoffed. “I don’t want to impose. You could always fetch it later and bring it to me when you have time…” Her voice trailed off as Steve walked over. “Well now…”
“This is gonna be pricey,” she said as people screamed and ran for cover. “J make a note to check insurance claims after we’re done. I don’t mind footing the bill but I’m not paying for someone’s windshield that they broke themselves.”
She could have killed him. Wanted to with a fire she’d felt for those terrorists in Gulmira but in the end Natasha had talked her down.
The fingers on Bucky’s metal hand tapped restlessly against his thigh; the arm itself a shiny black with what looked like gold threading. “Natasha. A long time ago in the Red Room I was the one who trained her. We worked a few missions together and sometimes things got…personal between us. But with the mind wipes it’s not like I remembered. When I was set up to take out Fury I was thrown back into her orbit. Pierce got wind of her contacting Stark for help after Fury ‘died’ and guess who he sent to handle them?”
Truer words had never been spoken. Toni Stark was a problem solver no matter what form they were in. It was something Steve had realized immediately about Tony Prime and had begrudgingly respected, though that hadn’t stopped him from questioning his motives. Or his techniques. But in the end Starks got the work done.
“Jesus. Here I came pretty close to killing Nat before she managed to snap me out of it. Split second decision, memory flashes of red hair and soft lips and I let her go. If I hadn’t Pierce would have killed Fury for real and Insight would have blown Stark out of the sky along with millions of others. I tried to disappear but I kept getting flashes of her and our past. Then she and Sam found me. Brought me here to get help.”
room. There was so much space to hang pictures and have couches for a cozy little art nook. Toni had gotten him his own mini fridge because she said he couldn’t trust anyone when it came to desserts, not even her. And the view; the view was simply spectacular. There was something about the wide open windows that made him feel at peace. Waking up to the sun warming his face—as if Jarvis just knew he’d want the curtains open—and the blue sky stretching on forever, it made his choices seem  limitless.
that face—was a bad idea. Trying to take out Iron Woman wasn’t smart either.”
That piqued his interest. “Oh? Who?”
“Did you make it?”
“Yay,” Toni whispered contentedly as Pepper left. “That should be interesting.”
The problem with Starks,
“No, no nothing like that.” He shrugged. “We just—we never got the time to spar just for the hell of it. Back home if we were fighting it was because he was trying to kill me. I kind of wish there’d been time to just mess around in the ring because we could.”
Groaning he stumbled against a set of dumpsters, eyes wide and chest heaving as he realized he was back in the future. Flashes of escaping S.H.I.E.L.D’s facility after first waking up pushed themselves to the forefront of his mind but he shook them away. He made to take a step forward when a noise behind him caught his attention. Slowly he turned and watched in horrified fascination as a—well he didn’t know
He’d had his fill of fighting but there was a current of excitement rolling beneath his skin at the idea of fighting beside Toni again. Or he supposed for the first time. “I guess we should be suiting up then.”
. The whole ordeal—and seeing Peggy in 1970—made him tired and long for something he’d always figured he couldn’t have anymore. But the stones would need to be returned to their precise timelines…so he volunteered because he was Captain America and Captain America fixed what was broken. This time? He’d also fix himself. Perhaps it was a bit selfish but after seventy years wasn’t he due a bit of selfishness? A bit of happiness?
Plenty of women and men found Tony Prime attractive. Before settling down with Pepper he’d been quite the playboy or so the tabloids would have had everyone believe. Steve had never really thought about it for more than a passing moment but yes, Tony had been good looking. More than that his mind and the things he could come up with had made him incredibly sexy. But unfortunately Steve had found himself circling around Tony’s less than stellar qualities…or perhaps he’d just set himself up as an antagonist so that he wouldn’t be dragged into Tony’s hypnotizing orbit.
“I mean everyone knows who I am already though. This will no doubt be in the paper. I can see the headlines now;
Even as a woman she was larger than life, filling up the empty spaces anywhere she went. Her features were naturally more feminine then what he was used to but the eyes were the same. Big and brown framed by long lashes, and so expressive they often revealed things Tony didn’t want revealed. She was shorter than him though and curvier, but still talked a mile a minute with a quick wit most people couldn’t rival. And…she was alive.
. The days when he sighed and lamented over how Tony never touched him were over, and he couldn't wait to tell Nat. Maybe he'd get a medovik cake for happy reasons, or maybe he could even talk her into making one of them Tula pryanik things she talked about but refused to spend the time baking.
"Yeah."
Despite that, everything was going... really fucking well.
"Tell that to the fangirl who has both a taser and the will to fucking shock whoever the hell she meets. Have you ever been tased Steve? Because it sucks. Hard. Harder than I did in college, which--"
"Harsh much? I just--"
Location: Stark Industries
Here it is! :D Between dog-sitting an incredibly needy, slightly annoying dog and work I didn't get this up as quickly as I needed it, but here it is! :D
"My middle name is Brian," Steve offered with a smile while snuggling up to Tony. They're a good looking couple, I have to admit. He and Ms. Potts always made a splash, but somehow the two of them just look more... right. I'll let you judge that for yourselves, of course. I probably creeped them out with how much I was staring, but you can come to your decision using the pictures provided, including a couple candids available exclusively on our website.
"Hello, little one." His voice was so close to being Bucky's while still being so different, and fuck he had to stop looking for things like that! It was just as bad as looking for Tony in Shellhead and vice versa. Somehow he thought Winter would be a lot less forgiving than either Stark was about it. "You're a pretty thing." There wasn't even a hint of Brooklyn in the words, but the Russian accent was... understandable, he guessed. Those uncompromising eyes flicked his way, and he offered another small smile. "You're Steve Rogers."
Especially since they were suddenly standing only a few inches apart. Steve wasn't sure exactly when the distance had been crossed or who had done it, but now they were close enough for him to feel Tony's breath fanning over his skin while his scent flooded Steve's nose. Every thought that he might be wrong, that this might be another misunderstanding soon flew out the window, thank God. When he looked into the beautiful brown eyes he'd been dreaming of for years, he saw the same longing he so often found in the mirror. Tony was swaying into his space as much as he was swaying into Tony's, and he could feel warm hands gripping his sides.
There were things that could have been said, challenges that could have been thrown or speeches given to bring poignancy to the moment. Soul just wanted it done before the little Mechanic disappeared completely, before Steve was burned to ash under the combined weight of Time and Space. So there was no recital of the Mad Titan's crimes, no taunts or warnings.
... they still trusted him to keep them safe. Peter had trusted him enough to admit that he had been afraid.
"I ain't destitute ya know. Rosie always knew I'd be back, so she took my Army money ta invest and it grew from there. I'm not your kind-a rich, but I ain't hurtin' either - I can afford ta buy us somethin'. And your money wouldn't do no good there anyway."
"'Lokes'? One of the
He couldn't have stopped the smile that grew on his face any more than he could have stopped the sun from rising. "Yeah. I'm... I'm real happy Pegs. 'M sorry I didn't let ya know that. Being back here is... it's so good. It's
Harley liked to be the sole holder of his attention, but it was rare for the teen to actually ask to see him alone. As soon as he'd agreed the kid had dragged him into an empty conference room and began to pace. His beloved hat was in his hands, and as he walked he bent the cap this way and that, putting it on and taking it off just as quick to run a hand through his curls. It was clear the kid was agitated but not worried... so Tony figured it was best to let him speak in his own time.
He hesitated at the door to go inside though. The dimmers were on - Tony had another name for it, the way the walls of glass looking into the workshop went dark. It was a fancy word that Steve had deliberately forgotten every time he heard it just because he loved the fondly exasperated lecture he got for saying 'dimmer switch'
It was Steve who said it, so of course they all did it. Mostly anyway - they were figuring out their orders but Clint in particular was still muttering rebelliously to himself. Hopefully the archer would get to pick dinner the next day; Tony silently promised to cast his vote Clint’s way to better the chance of that happening. Maybe he could talk Bruce and Steve into doing the same.
Between the hum of the lights, the vibrations running through the walls and floors and the continuous cycle of air through every room, Steve had a hard time finding any kind of peace at the compound. Tony didn't find it easy either; it had taken his and STAR's combined efforts to get his fella to sleep. Their girl had settled in on one of their pillows to guard Tony's sleep and keep an eye out for the Witch. He appreciated it, because otherwise his sweetheart would never sleep restfully. Even if Steve had remained in the room and on guard, STAR and her constant vigilance paired with the tricks Stephen had taught her were the only things allowing Tony to get any kind of rest.
"I didn't think I'd need to be held together with this brand of superglue yet. That's all."
He was pouring a generous amount of scotch into his glass when a hesitant touch to his shoulder forced him to acknowledge that there were other people in the room. It was his
"I was." The man gave him a smile that looked tired and worn. He was leaning heavily against the door frame with a case of beer in one hand. Later Steve knew he would be delighted by the fact that Rhodes' own pajama shirt was emblazoned with Black Widow's symbol and that his flannel pants were dotted with tiny hammers, bows, shields and arc reactors. It was just that he recognized Tony's hand in the outfit, which at the moment only tugged painfully at his heart. "He finally talked himself to sleep about twenty minutes ago. I was gonna try to do the same without the talking, and then..."
He had to keep watching them, couldn't look away as they curled into each other, until Steve was tucked under Tony's chin. Then they went still again, but it was more natural now, like they really were only sleeping. It felt like they were there, in the room, instead of like their souls were so far away they were out of reach.
"We are not kissing just so you can watch it happen, pervert. You got enough of a show--"
sending the kids away, had cried right along with Steve when they had to pry their shirts out of metal claws while ignoring their plaintive, desperate whistles. The boys had been far less understanding than STAR. "But we could make sure the rest of the kids were safe. We figured even if Thanos did get his snap on--"
They had hoped... Strange had said that the two men had been... possessed or something by some of the Infinity Stones. The specifics were so shrouded in magical bullshit terminology that he got the gist of it while missing the finer points. When Tony woke up he would make Loki explain it to him.
"Super intense, super worried, super sexy.... and I wanted to do it right for you, since I'd been such an idiot."
"You heard the woman. Get her an opening. Rhodey! See if you can free my kid while we start Operation Jonah and the Whale."
. Even after she did everything she could to intimidate and terrify him every time he ventured to the compound. He could understand the way Rogers had picked Bucky over him even if it stung. Having Rogers pick
"Think you might be the only one besides Buck who'd rather cuddle with skinny Stevie than Captain America. After the serum everyone wanted to... I dunno. Got lots of 'cuddles' after that."
, not the way Tony'd always believed they would be. If the Rogues had refused to sign the Accords or accept their benched status... well. It wouldn't have really been any skin off the Avengers’ noses. All it would have meant was an active hunt for the Rogue's mobile base to bring them in far less peaceably. This way was for the best PR-wise, but it wasn't their only choice. Hell, Rhodey had voted it down, as had (he suspected) Steve, Harley, Pepper and Matt. The democratic approach meant they had to suck it up anyway, but it gave him that warm, tingly feeling to know they'd voted a resounding 'no' mostly for his sake.
The world and the universe moved around them, bringing new friends and fresh grief. Family was found and sometimes lost, battles were fought and most of the time the Defenders were able to save the day. Tony fiddled with his robots and Steve puttered with his paints; they only donned their armor as a last resort. Things changed as much as they didn't, and they were happy more often than they weren't.
Captain Carol Danvers
Sure he'd have Buck - maybe, an ugly voice inside had whispered sometimes, unless his best friend and brother found a woman that could keep his interest, and then what what he want with small, skinny, needy Steve - but there wasn't a white picket fence at the end for him. Wasn't even going to be a lousy apartment he could barely afford, at least not one that had a wife and kids living there with him. No, little Stevie Rogers wasn't what any dame was looking for, and anyhow it was only a matter of time before a winter came that was too long and too cold for him to survive.
"You've been letting me out of this for years. You've been so fucking understanding that I sometimes want to shake you. Steve. Babe.
"Only so I can point out all the flaws and make them better."
"Peter doesn't have to be here."
) fight from a few days ago wasn't enough to keep Rogers from jumping in anyway.
He could be so strangely, beautifully sweet; Steve was never sure if he loved or hated how few people seemed to understand that. As much as he liked being one of the privileged few to see that side of him clearly, he also sort of wanted to crow about every amazing trait of Tony's so the whole world would know how damned perfect he was.
Once that was over, Cap threw the tennis ball for Dum-E. The ease with which he did it suggested they had been playing for a while, which was absolutely sweet but it did not mean that Cap was any different from Howard's stories of him. Probably the guy just wanted a dog or something, or maybe he was bored. He wasn't playing fetch with the silly old 'bot because he cared about Dum-E's
"How about we go back to the mean old witch just long enough to tell her where you are?" A good idea, because it
Eventually they ended up on the sort of shitty couch that Tony kept in the workshop, the 'bots now making a safer scene with specialized cans of silly string and bits of confetti. Steve knew he'd be helping them clean up later, but that was more than okay. He was in love with a gorgeous genius who cared about everything more than most people could ever guess; amazingly enough the guy loved him back. And while yeah, he could die happy... he would give everything he had to keep on living so he could stay with Tony.
"So I don't get ta see hers then?"
That was a bit rich coming from the guy who'd just called their 'special guests' assholes, but Tony figured he'd let it slide. He was too busy feeling warm and loved to start scolding anyone. Harley nodded once to Steve, then sidled over his way until their arms were brushing against each other. Tony was dismayed to realize the kid was now almost as tall as he was - the teen was growing like a weed and he wanted it to stop now.
"That's because your world decided on that Monopoly money
"I know that look Steven. Don't you
“Heh. Wait. No. How long has Iron Mom been in here?”
"And then shit to build."
"Pah. Sentiment."
"Ass."
Dammit.
I hurt everyone. You are simply used to it, little Mechanic. Do not worry. This won't take long.
U had no such compunctions. He zoomed over to Steve’s side of the bed, beeping and whistling in a shrill, almost desperate tone. Maybe he hated that his lover removed one arm from their comfortable snuggle, but he couldn’t begrudge U the comfort of physical touch from the man they had all missed so much. Steve draped one hand over the 'bot's main strut and didn't even flinch when U's claw landed heavily only an inch from his face.
"And oh boy are we going to read you the riot act." Before Shellhead could get too worked up, Lokes shot him a look that shut him up. Tony blinked at them both, looked around at the other Defenders, then turned his attention to Steve.
It was so, so hard not to laugh and he was pretty sure that made him a terrible person.
That was when Clint lost in completely, laughter exploding out of him right in Tony’s ear. He shoved the man away, and he would have hit the floor if Butterfingers hadn’t swooped in and let the archer’s frame drape all over his. The beeps and whistles his youngest let out were full of robot swears, Tony knew it. He immediately pretended to be scandalized, one hand clutching his chest as his eyes went wide.
"I heard ya, I heard ya."
I shall throw this into the void and run. ^.^; Sorry it took so long!!!
“Yeah. I know. Stick close anyway? One scotch and one water,” he added to the bartender that had finally been able to turn their way. It was good that he wasn’t looking down anymore, that his attention had shifted. Tony’s mouth was hanging open again, and he could feel how wide his eyes were. This was a whole new level of protectiveness, and once again there was a vague hope taking form inside of him.
, Harley. For science. Remember?"
"Sure Tony. We oughta stop on the way home'n get her some clothes. Doubt anythin' she has is better than what she's got on."
"I'm not anymore and that's that. I like being Maverick - colors are more up my alley." Tony cooed at him for the answer, then tried to kiss him. Steve immediately planted a hand on his face and pushed him away. "Not in front of the papes!" he whispered, probably hoping I wouldn't hear. Tony pouted but settled quickly, one arm still wrapped around Steve.
armor--"
There were all kinds of dames throwing themselves at his new body, and a few fellow soldiers had discreetly offered up a night of 'stress relief' as well. It felt like a lie whenever he gave in though, because none of them wanted Steve Rogers. They wanted the muscles and the bravery, not the artist with knobby knees. All of them whispered praises about how he looked, crooned into his ear everything they wanted to do with that body... and he let them. He had gone so long without anyone but Bucky touching him that he sometimes felt starved for it. What he got as Cap was a far cry from a friendly arm slung around his shoulder, and it was enough to have some part of him purring with contentment.
God, it felt like he was flying. Tony's attention always made him feel a little high, like that first full breath he'd taken after the serum. He was sure he looked like a twit with the way he was smiling hard enough that his cheeks hurt, but he just couldn't help it. Clint was still grumbling as he navigated the menus, which was kind of the icing on the cake. Nobody got to make Tony pout that way, not even if it was in fun.
They all wandered off, and Steve was pleased as punch when Tony walked with him to the elevator. Sure they were arguing over why Rainbow Road was awful - Tony didn't like how slippery it was while he was convinced that it took longer than usual to get put back on it after you went over the side - but they were both still grinning. It was such a good 'argument' that Tony even came all the way up to his floor and kept him in the elevator for a few more minutes.
"Am I allowed to kill Rogers?"
Tony abruptly shoved away, cursing under his breath. He should follow his lover - Steve
“Yes, Master Clint?”
"Both of you stop. Harley, you come with me and your sister--"
You are not one of mine, not of the Order that has hidden and protected my power from those who would misuse it, Steven. Still - I choose you now, and can act through you. With Space to aid us, you and I will help defeat Thanos.
Steve kept pulling until Probably-Nathan was about a foot away from Tony and then insinuated himself into the space between them. He locked his arm around Tony’s waist in a firm, almost proprietary manner that had his heart picking up speed. Steve was glaring at Maybe-Debbie while pulling him out of her clutches, and when her claws had finally let go of his suit jacket he couldn’t help but melt gratefully into Steve’s hold. Being touched by a friend was different than having two horny twenty-somethings panting after him.
Hope you enjoy, thanks for continuing to read, and have a lovely day!
For just a second, a fierce and hot jealousy flashed through him. Some other Tony Stark had gotten to be with Steve when he couldn't, and maybe... As soon as the thought formed, he knew he was being an idiot. He had the fingers of Steve's right hand still trailing up and down his arm, occasionally brushing as high as his neck or dipping down to his hip. The man's other hand was taking turns patting both of their boys, and he had left that other world specifically to be with all of them. Given the evidence it was hard to believe he'd had any kind of steamy affair with some other Tony.
It took another day and a half before both Tony Starks could be convinced to talk to each other. Tony was nervous and - Steve thought - maybe a little jealous, so he would flit out of the room as quick as possible if Shellhead entered. For his part, Shellhead was still terrified that he'd never measure up to Tony, so he would only stay in the same room if Loki was there to snuggle him and whisper sweet words into his ear. It was a ridiculous mess, and he had enough of it fairly quickly.
"This ain't your world!" Steve burst out, red-faced from embarrassment at being caught out. "And we didn't want ya worryin' over somethin' ya couldn't change--"
It would be unfair of him to make Steve do that. His fear was pretty stupid, all things considered. The Defenders weren't half bad, even the ones he wasn't all that fond of. They felt like... it was stupid, but they felt like family the way it was supposed to be. They bickered and squabbled sometimes, and they definitely didn't all like each other. But if push came to shove? They would absolutely band together and kick ass. He thought Jan was annoyingly cheerful, for example, a flighty little fashionista with no tact and questionable taste in men. If anyone else said anything bad about her? He would happily end them. That was
But then, evil Jedi was the one Captain Marvel had been warned was the most dangerous of Thanos' remaining Children.
He'd been there in a way that had been constant without being suffocating. Harley and Viz had been embraced without comment, and he'd never even batted an eye at being asked to accept Laney and Alicia Keener as well. Somehow he'd worked his magic and started up family nights, the kind Tony would never admit that he'd dreamed of having with the Avengers. Movies, games of all kinds, quiet reading or working time…
When nobody moved (unless you counted the way Steve's mouth dropped open in outrage), she put on another of those thin, dangerous smiles. "Make your choice quickly or I will make it for you. And if any of you ever darken Mister Stark's doorway without his permission again, I promise that you will be
, they were going to have to sacrifice one of the civilian areas under attack to get another team to the compound to assist them.
The frustration had drained from Steve's voice, leaving him sounding tired and sad. Tony never imagined him sad. Maybe - just maybe - it was safe to believe and open his eyes. Maybe this time his heart wouldn't break all over again.
Tony almost spit his latest sip of tea out at the hint of humor that had left Captain America's mouth. He choked and spluttered for a second, and when he managed to swallow and then look up he got another surprise. The guy looked almost smug, with a hint of a smile playing around his mouth and eyes. Bruce was play-scowling - another victory even if it didn't belong to him - and it was kind of awesome.
The Vision
That voice was familiar enough that he stopped trying to keep Tony close, opening bleary eyes to look up into Winter's iron-blue ones. "What're ya doin' here?" His words were slurring just a touch - he hated battle fatigue. It was even worse than being drunk. Back when he could get drunk, anyway. "Where ya takin' Tony?"
Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy, and think about leaving a comment maybe if you do. <3
It was his teammates who really made all the difference in the world. There was always a pair of discarded ballet shoes and a few knives littered around the place that belonged to Nat. One wall was usually covered in the results of Clint's latest 'fun' arrows, and the archer also tended to shed his practice bracers, shoes, shirts and sometimes his pants across the floor as he walked to the showers. The only sign of Bruce's presence was the yoga mat tucked in one corner, but he couldn't exactly train with them anyway. Thor left scorch marks on the floors and walls, and after the eighth time he'd cracked and blackened a mirror Tony had refused to replace it. It stood as a testament to the god's presence.
Tony cheered when Vision launched into the air and headed for the dome over Strange and the rest. The android wouldn't do that if one of the Black Order was still after the Mind Stone - the cave troll must have been downed for good. They were almost there - they'd almost weathered the assault. Vision phased through the barrier, and he was sure that fight would be over soon. No way evil Jedi could take them all on at once - it was fucking insane that the villain had lasted this long against so many Avengers at once.
I wish I could explain to you exactly how a completely different, pocket-sized Steve Rogers came to be sitting in the living room across from me, but I can't. Tony tried to explain it in more detail to me, but it only made my head hurt. What I DO understand is that there are multiple universes (who knew?) and one of them gave us Steve Brian... who was also Captain America where he's from. As soon as I mentioned that, he blushed again and looked down at the floor.
"Any acceptable prank, Captain. I remember that at least. I shall tell Sir you will be arriving...?"
"So when are you and da gonna admit this ain't a vacation house?"
"Obviously."
Harley smiled with teeth, and the kid could be fucking scary when he put his mind to it. "Good. There's no way she'll let 'em off easy."
Tony always said that JARVIS didn't live in the ceiling, but he didn't know where else to look. Besides, the look Tony got on his face was both adorable and only playfully angry so he'd do it even if he did know where the cameras actually were. The AI never seemed to mind after all.
He joined the fight against the hellhounds with an easy conscience, not quite believing that they might
While the cave troll and evil Jedi had shared the spaceship brought down by Earth's shields, glaive guy and spear chick had learned from that. They'd kept their ship above the atmosphere and only sent down the metal petal-like shuttles the demon-dogs rode on. For every one that had been shot down another two landed, an infuriating lesson for Tony and the others who had designed the shields.
"No, but you might find one that looks kind of sad and decide to save it."
"Ya let them?"
The only one who wasn't very happy about it all was Harley. The two teens were dancing around each other like dogs preparing to fight, and he had a feeling the results were going to be explosive. It reminded him of U's behavior right after STAR had been brought online, but he wasn't quite sure what to do about it. Tony was just as clueless, so for now they were just sitting back and hoping for the best.
take care of him. Vision was on his way with breakfast, Fri sounded peppier than she had in a while, and he was sure that Pep and Rhodey would come running to welcome Steve back.
"She does not."
Couple-few things!
"Not Shellhead?"
2 - Red1999, when I saw your comment on my last chapter I just about died. XD You pretty much guessed the plot 'twist', so congrats!! XD  :'D  I just had intended for there to be more of a physical confrontation before and after the whole soulscape journey thing. Anyone who guessed where this was going gets a virtual cookie!
Ms. Potts.
"Steve, you have to give her a name."
"Yeah. Okay. Don't be gone too long, jerk. I'll think you ran off with some dame again." The two smiled at each other, but the expression didn't last long once the door had shut again, leaving them alone. "It wasn't enough," Rogers started after a moment, voice tight and hands clenched once more. He struggled a moment, then turned bright, accusing eyes Steve's way. "You couldn't be happy with ruining my relationship with Tony, could you?"
"Is there something going on?"
Jess was the one who moved to fill the gap, already bleeding from a head wound and scratches running down her chest. None of it slowed her down, so Tony was pretty sure that line would hold. And really, Wanda would rather die than let anyone else have Vision, so maybe it was for the best. The chick with the spear was the one who seemed most interested in obtaining the Space Stone, though glaive guy kept stepping in to fight at her side. Seemed personal more than anything, which they could use--
His groan interrupted whatever it was Peggy had said which was probably kind of rude. But 'Agent Carter says' had gotten old
He had been the one to say 'hey', but Bruce got greeted first. That was... it was fucking fine, that's what it was. Didn't matter and it definitely didn't hurt his feelings. He wasn't a little kid anymore and he had learned not to be so goddamned sensitive. Tony was definitely not going to let it get to him. He wasn't sulking into his mug either.
"Because you aren't one?"
"Bullshit," Tony said with a surprising amount of fervor. "I've seen the pictures. I would have cuddled the fuck out of skinny little Stevie Rogers. Someone would have snapped you up unless everyone back then was stupidly blind and ignorant."
"Tony--"
But as Dum-E and U settled in by the bed, STAR curled against the hollow of his throat, he thought it might be nice if he let himself give in to the fantasy of it. With Steve fussing over his bandages and making sure all the wires he was hooked up to were undisturbed it was easy to just let his
Tony couldn't respond, partly because he didn't know how. The other reason was the lump of emotion that had lodged in his throat while his heart beat wildly in his chest. Steve searched his eyes  for a moment that seemed to stretch on forever before offering another little smile.
--" Steve was out of his arms and on the move before Tony could process what exactly was happening. Shellhead was no quicker on the uptake - he didn't get out of the way before Steve dive-bombed the loveseat and wrapped himself around Lokes in a tight, affectionate hug. The demigod immediately began to whine but didn't actually shove Tiny Adorable Steve away. Shellhead scooted to make room, and Winter was smiling a little as he watched the whole thing. Tony might have been jealous if it weren't for the flush of pleasure on Lokes' cheeks and the knowledge that Steve was the first friend the demigod had ever made - hell, he was still one of the
Steve had gone to his old world a few dozen times and he had always, always come home. This wasn't like the land of the Fairies - they wouldn't be snatched away never to return. Probably. And Harley and Peter were really looking forward to the visit. He didn't want to disappoint them or give them a reason to tag-team him. They were a handful separately, but now that they'd decided they were siblings and should stick together? Chaos. Pure and utter chaos.
Then Magneto had almost killed him and Steve was forced to let go of that happy delusion. He could lose Tony forever in the blink of an eye and he wasn't... he didn't know how he was supposed to survive that. If Tony ever... ever died... it would be like losing everything all over again.
He'd lost Bucky twice, one time more permanent than the other. He tried not to think about that though or else he ended up crying into his pillow until he was raw and exhausted.
"Kid--"
"I'm only losing because I'm trying to compensate for repulsers my guy doesn't actually have," Tony retorted, playfully cross.
with them, and fuck maybe it hadn't been a good idea to be here after all.
He was actually pretty glad that other Tony hadn't gotten a Steve that was anything like Rogers.
, but for him Jay is mostly just--"
"Nah. Was just hugging. No matter what Howard told ya, I like hugs." He gave Tony a squeeze to emphasize the point, because he was pretty sure he was dreaming anyways - might as well take advantage of it. There was no way Tony Stark had been hugging him so long, no way that he was really cuddling against his chest while holding tight to his t-shirt. It was happening though, and he was both the happiest he'd ever been and nearabout nervous enough to pee his pants. If he fucked this up... "You can always ask for a hug, Tony."
Anyone could be redeemed if given the right purpose, after all.
"Tony would be f..." He stopped, because Tony wouldn't be. He knew his fella, and there was no way Tony wouldn't tear himself to pieces in his grief. "How 'bout we let the full-time Avengers do any train hoppin'?"
"Loki ain't a therapist, he's a God of Mischief ya occasionally talk at when you're so sleep deprived ya can't think straight."
"Stop threatening my team!"
He must be taught the error of his ways.
"We're not spying! We just... look, I know that sometimes you get yourself into trouble, and I was worried that without me here--"
--" Tony cottoned on to the important part of what Steve had said a couple moments slower than he should have, but he did get there. "Jesus fuck. U! Butterfingers! Put that down or so help me I will donate you to an animal shelter! That's right, not even kids anymore - you've been downgraded to kittens that will pee on you."
~.~.~
She was still nameless, because he'd wanted to talk about that with Tony. He'd thought that they could agree on a name together; he wanted so badly for them to be taking care of the dog as partners. He couldn't call her 'princess' forever though, and he couldn't keep waiting on Tony. So he'd taken to jotting down names on scraps of paper, searching for one that felt right.
The part of him that knew Howard had been right about him wanted to flee. He wasn't good enough for Captain America and he sure as hell wasn't good enough for plain, wonderful Steve Rogers either. Tony knew that he should probably pack his bags and get the heck out of dodge for at least a few weeks. At the very least he should go back to being standoffish so that Steve wouldn't be fooled into making the gigantic mistake that was dating Tony Stark.
"James certainly does."
Steve was sitting all the way across the room. He'd been by himself until Nat came in and sat on the table instead of the chair next to him. It had been long enough since she'd spoken that she probably already knew the answer; she had reached out to start running her fingers through his hair, nails dragging over his scalp in a comforting dance.
"I hug Nat'n Thor all the time," he pointed out as gently as he could. "I know you've seen it."
"It's alright. Yell-y squirrels ain't close ta the worst thing I've seen. Ya don't scare me, mister," he added to the squirrel in the most serious voice he could muster. The girl - Doreen, Stephen had called her - rewarded him with a giggle. "And I ain't been rude at all, so don't keep on yellin' at me. Scold Mr. Doctor Strange all ya want though, 'cause he can be pretty grumpy." More giggling, and Doreen didn't look quite so much like she was on the verge of tears. "What's your pet's name, sweetheart?"
. So... you're really not leaving?"
Since Tiny Adorable Steve would be jumping in right along with him, maybe the Iron Man armor should be the second thing he worked on. His
When I asked if he was Steve Rogers, the two of them shared a look that I honestly couldn't interpret. "I... am. Kinda." Steve finally told me. "But not the one you're thinking of. There was some kind of--"
. They were usually only on when the genius wanted privacy, wanted to hide whatever he was doing from prying eyes.
With the Avengers it was... harder. Sure they were a team and maybe something close to friends, but Tony was never really sure. Did the way Nat kept bullying him into training without the suit show concern or a disdain for how weak he was outside his metal shell? When Thor 'praised' his tech for being 'impressive' for a mortal, was that a fond tease or the insult it sometimes felt like? Clint was a little easier to read and he was pretty sure the archer at least found him amusing. His pranks were almost never aimed at Tony anymore and he was often included in the planning process, which had to mean something. Bruce was, of course, his science bro and their love was one that would span the ages, but sometimes... sometimes he worried that Bruce tolerated him more than cared about him. He tried not to let that thought creep in too often. It was a mixed success.
That has never been our position, Ms. Potts, as you well know. I resent that comment and am extremely disappointed by your lack of cooperation. There was no need for this to become hostile.
"And you're pretty bendy, so I went with a material that could cope with that. In getting rid of the rigidity I sacrificed some of the protection it offers, but you strike me as a guy who'd rather evade blows anyway. I bet your Black Widow taught you all kind of flexy-bendy ways to get out of trouble. And--"
Since the Nightmare Beast had managed to grab Harley and was shaking him hard enough to put the kid's neck at risk, Tony was more than willing to do just that.
"I was scared the whole time, idiot."
Jesus
~.~.~
"I can have you outta here in like, under a minute," Harley said quietly. "And if I think you're going into a panic attack, I
"You're gonna be fine. Just keep breathin' and you'll be okay. Because this isn't a bad thing pops. Hell, I think it's a good thing." Harley was almost 20, so he figured he probably couldn't tell the kid to watch his language and be taken seriously. "You and da both seem more relaxed here. Happier. So it's not anythin' ya need to be sorry about. And I started with you because... well. I think da would worry more and feel guilty about it."
"I've had just about enough of you. I really wanted to talk to Tony first, help him understand what was going on before I took you down. He was alone and vulnerable, and it's not his fault he fell for this - like I said, he gets in trouble when I'm not around." And wow, was that condescending as fuck. "But I'm willing to be flexible."
"Instead he thinks ya hate him. Didn't know how ta tell him that ya hate yourself more'n ya could ever hate anyone else."
It was fine though. Captain America wouldn't want to hang out with him anyway.
"Tony! Did you do this? I apologized for the misunderstanding dammit! You have no right to do this to us!" Face hard, Steve turned around and began a quick march toward Rogers, and fuck he hoped this wouldn't turn into a brawl. Then Harley was lifting off, leaving the whole mess behind them. Even as they flew away though, he could still hear Rogers shouting after them.
Thankfully he had other people whose good opinion of him he wanted to keep so he could ignore that urge. He set the glass down instead of downing its contents and leaned his left hip against the bar. Steve and Rogers were still trying to stare each other down, Nat's gaze was flicking between Steve and STAR, and Sam was calmly taking them all in and probably trying to determine a point of weakness to attack should it be necessary. A mean, petty part of him hoped the guy thought Pepper would be the one to go after, because she would absolutely destroy him. Probably without even chipping her nail polish.
weapons party'," he called out, noting that none of them seemed very regretful or impressed by him. "I would have suited up for the occasion. Right now you've got me at a disadvantage."
He was the one to break eye contact, swallowing hard before glancing toward the couches. Both Thor and Rhodes were watching with rapt attention which would have been bad enough. It was the judgmental arch of the latter's brow that really got to him, making his cheeks go even hotter. Another hard swallow almost brought enough moisture back to his mouth to talk, but it took just a little too long. When he turned his attention back to Tony the man looked concerned and that wasn't what Steve had been aiming for.
"Seeing a flaw in the plan, but it's fine. Recalibrating... Fri! Could you have the display for Steve's new suit go dark please?"
his plan without demanding a lengthy explanation. It was a risky move, one that would leave them open to the waves of demon-dogs still trying to pour out of the ships. But if they could take the chick with the spear or glaive guy out of the game... he was pretty sure the other would follow. Getting half the big players off the field would do wonders for their chances.
Hey guys! :D This is later than I wanted it to be - so sorry! Also have decided to do two chapters of this 'time skip' kind of thing. I ended up having a lot more stuff I wanted to include, but this was getting long. XD
"He might." It was nice to have the other man acknowledge the possibility instead of scoffing at him the way Nat did. "And then things might get awkward for a while, maybe you avoid him or the other way around for a few weeks. Maybe you don't really talk for a couple months. But you know what? Wouldn't last forever. You're one of his people now man. He wouldn't let you asking ruin that. You wouldn't lose him as a friend, not really. Not forever. So if that's what's stopping you? Yeah. Just fucking ask him before there's a fight that ends with him worse off than a few broken ribs and a concussion."
"What? Really? But you didn't
"Pep. Pepper. Light of my life. Steve knows I love him unconditionally but that I am also obligated to mock his awful dance moves."
"I don't want to drop by again only to be told I'm not allowed to come in," the kid answered quietly, raw vulnerability in his voice and eyes. "Mister Stark has been my hero since forever, you know? He even saved me once, though he probably doesn't remember it, and I... I know I messed everything up but I can't..."
"Sentiment, huh Lokes?"
“Sure thing Tony. Whatever you want.”
"I told them they had to or I wouldn't accept anything from them."
I feel super bad about how long it took to finish this commission, but I very much enjoyed writing it!! I love fluffy-ness with a touch of angst, and I like when I don't have to include a lot of plot because I'm bad at it. XD So thanks very much to the awesome lady who commissioned this and let me run with the prompt she gave me! <3

"... okay. I believe you. What do you want to know Steve?"
"Maybe, but you shouldn't. You're Captain America too, or at least I hope you got to be in your world. You would be a great Cap."

"Because Tony is both dramatic and full of anxiety when he's giving presents."

"Uhm, the cave troll from Lord of the Rings is on the move. Seems kind of angry?"
become one of the go-to placements for 'super-kids' that needed a home instead of Xavier's school or the Defenders training ground that was Stark mansion. Tony never stopped developing AI's either, which meant that at any given time they had a parcel of human and metal children calling them 'pops' and 'da'. Peter never moved to the universe that was their home; Harley never moved away from it. Despite that they all made it work, and their first two human sons were an important part of their ever expanding family.
"Damn straight."
Steve felt his brows raise as surprise registered. He never would have expected JARVIS to have an opinion on his clothes, let alone prefer a shirt that Clint had called 'bordering on criminally obscene'. It hadn't seen the light of day since that initial try, even if both Nat
He wasn’t going to press his fucking luck though. Not when he had Steve as a friend, not now that the Avengers were getting close to feeling like a family. He already had more than he’d ever thought he would ever have. It was enough that Steve felt comfortable enough with him to be singing some stupid love song from the forties wildly off-key just a few short steps away.
He couldn't help but snort at the request, fighting the smile tugging at his lips. She couldn't know that she'd won.
kept Peggy from looking like she might burst into furious tears.
Winter stared at him for long, silent moments, then turned his eyes to Natalia. He barked something that sounded harsh and unforgiving in Russian, but both deadly assassins had the ghost of a smile on their faces, so. Steve had no freaking clue. She answered in the same language, and boy he should have hopped on learning that one. French and German were swell, but he'd give his right eye to know what the two were saying to each other.
"How is he?" It was the question he had dreaded asking, but it needed to be done. Neither of them asked who he meant, and Loki's smirk immediately faded away to a grim frown. Peggy looked a little less foreboding, but there were shadows in her eyes. She kept rubbing her left thigh as well, and he was sure his wayward brother had injured her somehow.
, because what if he was wrong? It had happened before - another betrayal like that would kill him.
was ready to enact justice until he was strong enough to do it for himself. Pepper's hand found it's way between his shoulder blades, warm and strong, and it helped calm his breathing and steady his heart. None of them would let him get hurt again, and he had the sneaking suspicion that if he even so much as hinted that he wanted them... the Defenders would be down here within heartbeats.
It was definitely fate that had brought them together, and it looked like she knew it too.
"Show ya the list later if you want."
, I've read almost all of her papers. Got an A on the last report I did with them as a basis. There's been speculation that she has a fully operational Cradle for years, but no one's been able to... Did you get to see it? You have to tell me everything, Steve. Everything."
It had been... a really long time. Almost longer than he could remember, actually, since just breathing had been so easy. Even after he'd finally removed the arc reactor, a lot of the damage had remained. Sure it had been easier to catch his breath after that and maybe he had managed to convince himself that it was just like it had been before the shrapnel. He'd had a literal weight off his chest after all, and it had felt good. Scary, but good.
I-- forgive me. You were saying?
"Mom I am not
Not that he blamed her. She had kicked out way more than her fair share of his one night stands.
Steve had the weirdest feeling that he was about to step out into a minefield, like maybe if he said the wrong thing Tony would withdraw into himself and never speak to him again. So he bought himself a little bit of time to get this
were almost upon him - and he'd been having fun. Sure he was anxious, but he wasn't crippled by the feeling. The pit of fear that usually yawned open inside of him at the prospect of facing the Rogues was absent.
Maybe Steve wasn't out of his reach; maybe he never had been. It was time to let Howard Stark's words go. He needed to stop listening to his father's ghost and needed to start believing that he was more. That he deserved more.
"It's a metaphor, punk."
"Don't you dare you spoilsport. I designed your code, J. A few keystrokes and all you're good for is being Siri's sidekick."
"Does your Anthony know he's given them souls?"
"I'm okay right now." Tony weakly punched his arm when he snorted in disbelief, but his eyes were crinkled in silent laughter. "I mean it I... it hurts all the time right now, but this isn't any worse than if I was laying by myself. Having you here just means instant help when I want to shift positions. Usually I have to buzz someone up from the medical floor."
"Everythin'. I wanna know everythin' about this time'n the Avengers and all-a that. First..."
"Thanks a lot Steve. For, you know, everything. Thank FRIDAY for me too, will you? She's been... she's been really trying for me, and I know she didn't have to tell you anything, so... yeah."
The way Tony grabbed hold of his arm and towed him over the couch almost made up for it. He didn't even mind when the genius plopped himself down into Rhodes' lap, because he was still lit up from the inside just from the simple touch of the man's hand. It was ridiculous of him, but at least he knew that. Self-awareness was fast becoming one of his better skills.
"Say that ta me when we're workin' on your hand ta hand next, will ya Harley?"
"As this is not an emergency of any kind my protocols dictate that I contact Ms. Potts--"
Funnily enough, it was the continued reminders that Captain America would find him weak and fragile that hurt him more. Hearing over and over how much his childhood hero wouldn't be able to stand the sight of him didn't make it any easier to swallow. It always burned going down, as harsh as the glass of whiskey Howard had thrust into his hand when he was twelve along with a demand to stop being so goddamn sensitive and be a man instead.
"Tony!"
But Clint had been bored, and it was easier to give him joke arrows than ones that actually meant a damn.
"You shut up too, Parker, or I won't care that your face will break my fist."
When I asked about rumors of the Rogue's return, Steve sighed heavily. "We voted on it, all of us new Avengers. I know Rhodey - uh, Colonel Rhodes - put out a press release and all that. So that's the official position - they'll be allowed to work their way back onto the team once the legal mess gets sorted. It's one I stand behind, 'cause that's what the vote was." I got the feeling that he wasn't necessarily pleased with that decision, but he refused to even come close to actually saying that. His continued comment was 'The New Avengers voted on it'.
"Shhh... don't worry. Not gonna make you take it from my hand right away sweetheart. That'd be mean. We're takin' our time to get to know each other, remember? Just wanted you to have something to eat while we did that."
"One civics lesson coming up. Should we go for an hour and see how far we get?"
, ya mook, is that Bucky's in a bad way. What they're tryin' isn't workin' but Rogers can't see that. He thinks he got his Bucky back, and if he thinks I'm tryin' ta take that away by--"
"Steve's right, Miss Doreen. And Mr. Doctor Strange knows that - he was just trying to help." The man in question huffed loudly but also nodded his head. "And I'm sure he's sorry that he was rude to your friend." Steve hurried to start talking before Stephen could inform the poor kid that he wasn't sorry at all - none of them needed that fight.
"Everyone wanted me when I was cleared for duty," Winter pointed out, that smug arrogance firmly back in place. Guy was worse than a cat when it came to that. "Tony Stark hates me but even he still requested me on his team."
He didn't look up to read the room because he could feel the weight of their disapproval and judgement settling on his shoulders. Pepper and Tiny Adorable Steve especially would be frustrated, but what else was he supposed to
From the corner of his eye he saw Natalia slip out of the room. It made another warm, cozy feeling settle in his chest. She'd been there as a chaperone after all. He had no doubt that she'd been instructed to monitor his behavior just as much as she was watching Winter's. They'd both proved themselves and now she was showing she trusted them.
Jesus fuck, he was getting too old for this kind of bullshit.
"Hey, my girl FRIDAY?"
It probably wouldn't help, but... Yeah. They'd been through hell to be together. There wasn't any reason to keep them apart now. He couldn't move Tony's bed as fast as Winter could have, but they still met somewhere around the middle, the two beds fitting together snugly to make one. Now in reach, Winter reached out with careful fingers to touch Tony's cheek - and that friendship was just so fucking weird and messed up, but whatever - and then he gave Rhodey a nod before striding right back out of the room.
"Do you know how terrifying it was to wake up and find your bots in the mansion?" There was an edge to Shellhead's voice, a hint of anger finally coming through the purposefully bland front he'd been putting up. "Those are your fucking
"We'll speak of it after you both have taken your rest." Oops, he hadn't meant to say that out loud, and from the look on Lokes' face he knew it too. "You're both far too tired for discussion."
What Tony didn’t understand was why lately he was always in the middle of those mostly playful fights.
"We won't ask you too, Miss Doreen."
"He isn't my Anthony, but I don't wish to cause him any distress despite that. It's..."
Either way, there were chuckles building up that he was determined not to let out. Fri had insisted this was important, that the
"Where are you going?" Captain America was frowning again. Tony already missed the smile and hated himself a little for being the one to take it away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck, she was something. Maybe part of him was sad he hadn't gotten to watch her grow into herself ... but the rest of him felt pretty damn honored to see who she'd grown into.
"He would not try and put you in a palace."
Most of their property was heavily forested and largely untouched by human hands. The wildlife was pretty fucking amazing to watch from their sprawling porch. He and Steve sat out most nights, either alone together or with some of the kids. U was especially fascinated, and was working with Steve to carefully build a hiking path that was safe for all the bots but wouldn't disturb the land too much. Dum-E was more interested in the pond behind the house, and had learned to skip rocks over the surface but fled whenever the resident cranky snapping turtle made an appearance. STAR was still spending most of her time inside, helping him with the renovations and with building up his workshop space. His girl FRIDAY, meanwhile, spent a lot of time interfacing with this universe's JARVIS and the internet, learning everything she could and peppering their conversations with new facts.
"Which is why I had no right to involve him in the first place!"
The gym Tony had put together was a goddamn delight, and not only because Steve was sweet on the fella who'd supplied it. There was the expected stuff, sure. Weights and a sparring area and punching bags, but it all had a twist that was patently Tony Stark. Some of it was even robots, which was probably his favorite part. Well, unless he or Thor broke one of them on accident, because Tony would mourn and fuss over each piece of tech like it was one of his kids. Steve knew they weren't, that they didn't think or feel the same way as JARVIS, Dum-E, U and Butterfingers did. Tony still loved them though, so he did his best not to be
Natalia had been the one to ask him not to learn the language. He would have done it essentially to spy on their conversations, she pointed out, which was both a terrible motive and an invasion of privacy. Still, while he didn't know the meanings of most words he had begun to get an ear for them; it was fascinating to hear both the similarities and the differences between their voices. Winter's voice was a little harsher, but Bucky's was gaining strength while staying mellow. Bucky's words were rounder, just a little softer around the edges, while Winter tended to spit out his consonants like a challenge to the world. Their dialects didn't seem to quite match up either, or at least it didn't sound like it, but they were communicating nevertheless.
"You're good for him."
"Yeah. Hey Underoos? Get over here, see if you can't wrap glaive guy up. Make it hard for him to get to his girlfriend."
We are all here. It is time to strike the Bargain.
Current Full time members of the New Avengers Roster are as follows:
So he took one last deep, steadying breath and slowly raised his eyelids.
Making small talk with Tony Stark was one of the more surreal experiences of my life. Having watched him in the news for most of my life, I admit I expected him to be... well. Vintage 90's Tony Stark was my expectation, and he was a very different person back then. I have to tell you I'm a much bigger fan of this new version. Not only because he fixed my phone and got the screen to stop flickering - he seemed a little offended that it was a brand other than a StarkPhone, but that didn't stop him from making grabby hands and taking care of the problem quickly when I passed it over.
"Why do you all get to stay the whole time, huh?"
. "And you have
He wanted more than anything for Tony to be able to stand tall and walk proudly without defeat curving his spine and weighing him down. As much as he wanted to spare his lover any pain... well. He was more interested in helping Tony heal himself, which meant sometimes he was going to have to fight him. It meant sometimes he was going to say things Tony wouldn't like, and sometimes he was going to have to let Tony be hurt.
"Yeah, okay." She sniffled a little, squeezing his hand. "I'll see if I can fit that into my schedule. The color?"
"Why do we need blindfolds again?"
Loki looked uncomfortable with the praise, though he quickly hid that behind a bored expression. "It was nothing."
That didn’t mean he didn’t notice Clint give Butterfingers a few final pats before clearing out of the workshop. Tony wasn’t sure why the archer had come to him instead of heading to Nat for protection but it had worked. He couldn’t argue with results.
Her upper lip slowly lowered to cover her teeth again, and she even settled her head back on her front paws. She was watching him though, and she made it clear that her guard was still up. A point in his favor was that she had stopped growling, and once he had sat down to make himself smaller she had stopped inching away too. He had a feeling she was either too weak to walk or hurt, otherwise she'd have been out of there right away.
"Not as good as you," he pointed out while fighting a blush. "He loves you, ya know. I'm just entertainin', not anything real special to him."
"And keep your snark to yourselves for just a little bit longer if you please. Okay. No offense, Tiny Adorable Steve, but we're gonna do ladies first on this one."
Nearly three dozen orbs swarmed the chick with the spear, all guided by FRIDAY and capable of destroying a small army all on their own. It was too damn bad that the Black Order's army seemed
Eventually the room was back to being mostly silent. It was sort of weird to have a teen he didn't even know curled up in bed with them, but he was really starting to think that maybe Tony had a kid - a flesh and blood one - that he just didn't know about. He could roll with it since he'd offered the boys and Fri that same courtesy. Hell, maybe he'd end up with another kid of his own.
they would lose Frank. If the man had been standing even an inch to the left--
He sighed quietly and for a split second wished his Tiny Adorable Steve wasn't so damn observant. But then... hadn't he spent most of his life wishing more people could see through the mask that was 'Tony
Loki scoffed, but his lips were pulled up in a tiny smile. Maybe not everyone would notice it, but he'd gotten used to looking for those tiny signs of happiness. "I don't believe in such drivel, Steven. You should know that."
Tony and Steve were going to be just fine. They just needed a little bit more time to get there.
"Whoa, wait - hold on. Are you... are you all
schoolwork at all, and he couldn't wait to see the look on Harley's face when he had five adults, three robots, a bodiless AI and an android pestering him about it. It was going to be priceless. The room was big enough and had enough little corners and nooks that they'd all be able to put their own spin on part of the space. Tony had always wanted it to be somewhere for tower residents to just hang out when they didn't want to be alone. Now he was going to get that, and he knew a lot of it was because of Tiny Adorable Steve.
"Shhh. We're talking."
“It’s the way
"Apples?" It was tentative and hopeful, that small interruption, with the genius gripping his shirt even tighter.
--" His voice cracked again, though probably from distress this time instead of hormones.
Sure enough, the chick with the spear had shaken off Captain Marvel and was making a beeline towards Maverick. It was definitely personal, and they needed to take advantage of it
Probably-Nathan’s hand slid around to rest between his shoulder blades while he shot Maybe-Debbie a heated look. “We’re both impressed by all of your aerial maneuvers. Must take a lot of flexibility. I’d love the chance to get a close up look at that.” Sure enough his hand had started to slip down, and so help him--
Though now he was going to have to tell Tony. Working through the implications of that with the other man should keep life interesting for a good long while.
because of the superhero thing, and it's not that it didn't work out because I've got Steve and you've got Ben - who really oughta swing by and say hi to Steve, since he's basically the reason you two are together and all - so it was for the best and I still adore you, but we broke up because of Iron Man. So forgive me if I'm a little confused by your sudden urge to don some primary colors and battle evil. Pettiness is not a good motivation to do that in my personal opinion."
Eventually he was shoved unceremoniously through another doorway. He was sort of stunned to see just how many people were milling around what had to be the ballroom. Even more shocking was the realization that he knew
"Oh please, he was in the armor--"
"You said he was tortured and all'n that's why did it, so it’s understandable he’s having trouble. I guess mebbe he won't ever be like he was. It'll prolly get better though. With time."
"Ya don't gotta explain ta me, sweetheart. I get it. Can ya do the other one now?" He poked at Tony's arm with the toes of the poor foot that hadn't gotten any attention and put on his best pout. There probably wouldn't be any objection, but he was prepared to fight it if there was. "Aches even worse now that I got somethin' ta compare it too."
"He means it. Now get gone before Rhodey comes back, 'cause he's gonna wanna beat the sin right outta ya." Steve didn't sound all that opposed, but whatever. He was absolutely fine with his
Second chapter for this update! :D
Something was different between him and the genius, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. Tony didn't seem distant, exactly, but he had almost had a heart attack when Steve had tried to follow him into the workshop the first day he had been allowed back. He'd been forcefully denied entry for the first time ever and it... it had hurt. Sure he was invited down a few hours later, but even then Tony had been cagey, hard to pin down. He was alternating between pressing right into Steve's space and pulling away whenever Steve touched him. He was either chatting a million miles an hour about nothing or falling into long, strange silences. And sure, he knew that he wasn't entitled to know all of the genius' business, but still Tony usually told him most of it anyway. Now he was hiding something, and it was all making his head spin.
"No flirtin' Starry Skies" he teased as she preened in Winter's palm. "Pep'll get jealous'n sad." STAR just blew a raspberry in his direction which drew forth a sound an awful lot like a chuckle from the Winter Soldier. "Pegs told me ya went out on the town the other day. They drag ya ta The Vortex?"
A bony knee hit his side hard enough to knock the breath out of him. Nat's face stayed serene but her eyes were sharp when he looked over to glare at her. "Don't play at being an idiot Steve. It doesn't suit you." Her knee retreated and her fingers delved back into his hair, so he knew she wasn't that upset with him. "He's been mine since he decided not to kill me, but he isn't
Tony really was expecting him to break his heart.
“Steve?”
He never would have asked, and he still wasn't sure it was the best move - Steve's world needed the Defenders just as much as this one needed the Avengers. But they had offered, and there was no way Shellhead, Winter or any of the others were going to budge. Knowing that there were more than half a dozen extra fighters at the ready to defeat Thanos was almost enough to let him believe they could win.
"Poor choice of words, maybe."
"You're welcome Tony."
"... I'm really fucked up, aren't I?"
When he finally chanced a look over at Tony, his breath immediately caught in his throat. There was an intensity in the genius' eyes that was usually only there when he was working on a particularly fascinating bit of engineering. At the same time some invisible bit of tension seemed to have vanished, and Steve only noticed it had been there at all now that it was gone. Suddenly Tony broke out into the brightest, most brilliant smile he'd ever seen. He felt almost blinded by it, dizzy with the possibility that
I look at Steve and Bucky. Neither would be ideal for the position and to nominate anybody else would mean giving them a lot of responsibility since basically they would be the face of our charity. Anything goes wrong and they would be the first person that the public would go against.
"See? Steve knows I'm all his, so we can have our moment, Pep. You want a closer look?
"If he's not my dad, blondie, there's no way in
Steve didn't tear his attention away from the genius until he felt Dum-E gently press a tennis ball against his hand. "Thanks bud," he said before giving the 'bot's claw an affectionate rub. "Let's see where we got enough space... ah! Over there'll work. Just watch for that big pile-a junk, kay? If it gets knocked over we're gonna have to clean up instead-a playing." There was a beat where the 'bot processed the instructions, camera aimed in the direction Steve was pointing. Dum-E twisted his claw in a move that always reminded him of a dog cocking its head to the side, then let out a beep of acknowledgement. "Great. Ready? Go!"
Hell, with Rhodes there Tony hadn't even realized he was in the room. All of his focus was on his best friend who was more like a brother, and Steve knew he shouldn't be jealous. They almost never saw each other in person and they had been friends for decades - if Buck hadn't fallen and he hadn't gone into the ice, Steve thought they would have ended up that way too. So turning green with envy over the way Tony was draped over Rhodes' back made him a complete ass. Wishing Rhodes was far, far away so Steve didn't have to watch Tony crawl into his lap during movies was even worse. Hating the fact that Tony was hardly going to look at him for the length of Rhodes' visit was unworthy of him, and his ma would give him an earful over such shameful feelings if she could see him now.
"Ya love it. Don't even try ta tell me different."
“You were so amazing during that last fight,” the redhead who had plastered herself to his side breathed.
"If you ever call me that in front of another soul--"
He gave the question a little more thought - was he okay? Eventually he shrugged and gave another little sigh, eyes still fixed on the guy who'd stolen his heart.
"Cap. I will buy you so many shoes. All the shoes. J--"
"Two away is good," Harley told him with a shrug, like it was no big deal. Like he didn't know whose workshop Tony would have had to rip apart to get their spaces closer. Bruce might never come back... but he always wanted the scientist to have a home here anyway, just in case. "And maybe I could work on that with Fri for a while then show you what we come up with. You've got other stuff to work on that takes priority."
"Tony!" Rhodey slammed into him from above, getting them both clear of the tentacle he hadn't noticed heading his way. "What the hell are you doing, just hanging in the air like that?! Keep
Steve was still in the shower when he ventured into the living area of their floor. Most of the Defenders were nowhere to be found, though there was a mystic cloak floating around and poking at their things. Lokes was indeed at the stove, still in his loose linen sleep clothes and his hair left loose. Shellhead was plastered against his back in only a pair of sleeping pants, because the two of them were disgustingly in love. Not that he had room to talk, not when he did the same thing to Steve, but still. He didn't really need the visual of another him cuddling up to
"He don't... hate isn't right. He just has a hard time talkin' ta ya--"
. Spider-Man was there before the villain could evade the attacks and get to the chick with the spear and began to web the guy up. Perfect.
"You shouldn't throw yourself off them either. I won't let you do that to
His hands jumped from where they'd landed on Clint's shoulders to draw up a slew of schematics and models that he was working on with his minions at SI. Having all that bright blue light floating around them would hopefully keep Steve from becoming suspicious. Tony never had an empty plate, so if there weren't any plans up at all he would smell something rotten in the state of Denmark.
Steve was quick to yank off the bit of black fabric he'd talked them both into donning. He didn't say anything though, just stared at the suit that was lit up and shining on the display stand in front of them. Pepper took the time to undo the knot behind her head, because of course she did. He did his part by not mentioning the way her fingers trembled as she folded the fabric neatly and didn't press her to look before she was ready. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, he
"This isn't funny," he managed, doing his best to glare and pretend he wasn’t embarrassed beyond belief.
on me and my tower? Are you fucking
“The diner sounds good to me.” Clint threw up his hands while Nat muttered something in Russian. Thor looked resigned but still happy enough, one hand reaching out to clap Bruce on the shoulder.
"Want me ta stay on this one?"
Well. He was staying the fuck out of all of it. He even left that damn knife right where it was - Winter was a big boy who could clean up his own messes. Instead he chose to flop down on one of the cozy looking chairs in the room and pulled out his phone. There was probably a few hours to kill before he headed home, so long as nothing else went horribly wrong.
"I really, really do."
was the one on glaive guy while Tony was all-around air support; they had been too far apart for most of the battle. He hated it, but it was necessary.
His human boys continued to bicker all the way down to the elevator. Steve was waiting in front of it, carefully slipping the last of the gifts into the crazy bag of his that should not fucking exist and had the nerve to do so anyway. Harley and Peter didn't stop once all the way to the floor that had become the official landing zone - it would have given him a headache if it wasn't so clearly a sibling thing. Their squabbles tended to warm his heart more than anything else. Steve seemed to agree, because he was smiling at the pair of them from where he was tucked against Tony's side.
"You should have called," Harley muttered, drawing his attention again. The teen was glaring up at Tony but it was more adorable and heartbreaking than anything. Tear tracks had left their mark on his cheeks, his eyes were bloodshot, and he was pretty continually sniffing so he didn't snot the genius up. "Soon as you could have, you should have called."
. You just let me know, okay Mechanic?"
"You're embarrassingly sappy."
"... what?"
get to steal my boyfriend for your little imaginary war. Steve's with me and we're totally going to kick your asses."
"Perish the thought! I must maintain my godly visage. It is the only thing I possess in this entire realm."
I came because I was fascinated with Maverick, one of the most reclusive heroes apart from Rescue. By this time in the interview, however, Steve Brian was far more interesting.
But the break-in was only STAR and the boys. Seeing the ‘bot he’d so carefully crafted for Steve caused the tears building in his eyes to finally fall, dripping over his cheeks and down his chin. It looked like she was vibrating, but she stayed where she was perched on Dum-E’s claw, wrapped around her brother tightly. Maybe his oldest was worried that he would hurt her, because he was moving incredibly slowly and carefully.
Shame wasn't something Tony was well-acquainted with. He had a passing knowledge of the feeling, knew when it should be knocking on his door... but this was one of the first times he had actually answered. It had been a long, long time since he genuinely wished the ground would open up and swallow him. The physics of it would be mind-bending and world-shattering, but that was okay. Science breakage was a go if it got him the fuck away from Captain America, who was now smiling behind one goddamned hand.
"Yeah. I remember one time I had ta talk sense back inta your fat head."
Now he just had to make Tony understand that too.
Time for him to take the demon dogs out at the source.
"Save him from what?"
That was the day I knew Soul was right. I did not think I would ever choose one who wasn't the Sorcerer Supreme, but you proved me wrong. You are what I need to stop what is happening.
Tony was a little older and had a few more wrinkles, a few strands of silver in his dark hair. Shellhead's dimples were less pronounced and his overly complicated goatee was a little rougher around the edges. Their scars were a little different, but they were both wearing ridiculous shirts and ripped jeans. Their facial expressions were such a close match, and God did he love them both even if it was in a different way for each.
Everything in his torso wasn't completely fixed though. Helen had warned that his chest was always going to be a weak point for him - regrowing tissue could only do so much. The Cradle had its limits and he had pushed right up against them. The good doctor had promised that he would be the first to know when she was ready to advance the technology further and he wasn't quite sure how he felt about that. On the one hand it would be nice if he didn't have a weak spot to be exploited; on the other there were probably people younger than him who could use the boost even more. He was still on his way out, and even the Cradle couldn't change that.
One day Steve slipped a ring on Tony's left hand, quietly and without any fanfare. The band was white gold, the middle inset with small gears done in yellow gold. It didn't take long for the gesture to be returned. Steve's ring was simpler, a gold band with a thin strip of arc reactor blue running around the middle. That was all it took before they slid into the 'married' category in everyone's mind. They didn't need the ceremony part of it, though they eventually gave into their kids and had one that was only attended by family.
the suit reveal."
and so was Tony - he just wanted to be able to sleep a little before the next disaster struck.
"Tony's doing fine by the way - Fri said you've been asking and she hasn't been allowed to really answer you. He spent some time in that Cradle thing Helen Cho invented--"
, or had a friend know the truth and refuse to tell him. Those little facts were bound to make someone a little bit more well adjusted than Tony himself was.
"Thanks," he muttered before dragging Clint towards the elevator. Tony didn't want to do this awkward turtle dance, not when it hurt his heart just a little bit. He'd rather be drinking and swapping stories with Clint.
You were mine from the moment you drew breath, little Mechanic. Space brought you to me early, but you were always mine. In this matter you will be my hands, so that together we three may throw off the yoke of Thanos' enslavement. Together we will free Power and Reality, and we will show Thanos what comes of attempting to abuse our power.
"Of course Boss."
- someone who isn't even old enough to drive without someone with a license in the passenger seat, no less - decided that all of you should live here. One of my most important duties is making sure you have a space of your own to work. I mean, you won't have all of the bells and whistles, or at least not the more dangerous ones. For that kind of stuff you'll have to work with me or someone else. You look surprised. Is it a good surprise? If you'd rather share with me--"
Thank you, Mr. Poppleton. Have a wonderful afternoon.
against a person is wrong. I won't let you pretend to be me just to get to him!"
"Odd and wonderful?"
pressed close. Having him so nearby started to drain some of his anxiety about that future, grounded him in the here and now. It was usually so, so hard to stay there... but Steve made it easier. Why would he want to focus on what awful thing was coming when he could feel his lover's tongue gently teasing at the seam of his lips? It was far more interesting to dwell on how the calloused fingers on his face felt as they trailed over his skin. Letting his thoughts fade into a murmur was easier than it ever had been when one of those hands went to his hair instead and began to tug at the strands
I apologize. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Poppleton, that Tony has been working in coordination with SI, Reed Richards, Hank Pym and the Asgardians to find ways to protect our planet from any extraterrestrial threats. Carol Danvers, Tokra and Noren have all been incredibly informative regarding what kinds of threats we should try to prepare for.
Not at all, actually. Mostly he tried to ignore it.
Maybe he should have done this in Tony's world and tower, but Pegs had said the thought of it made Winter uncomfortable. It had made Tony uncomfortable too, which put all the kids on edge. It had felt like a recipe for catastrophe, so he'd chosen to come to the mansion instead. Shellhead and Loki were off on some kind of romantic getaway, one that was probably mostly an excuse for Shellhead not to have to interact with Winter. All in all this first trip back to his own world had been full of tension and empty of friends.
. His lover had gone into defensive mode just as fast though, one arm now protecting Tony’s head and all his muscles tensed in case he needed to fight.
Maybe.
"Birthday boy number two is here!" he crowed, drawing everyone's attention. To Tony's embarrassment and pleasure a cheer rose from everyone gathered, with glasses raised to him from every direction. Before he could recover from that and make any kind of snappy announcement, Shellhead swooped in. He teasingly pushed Steve out of the way, then draped his arm over Tony's shoulders. He was grinning broadly the whole time, clearly sharing the general merriment in the room.
Steve thought about the Sokovia Accords, and he thought about the dream he'd had of Tony and Ross. He remembered SHIELD and how it had fallen in this world, and he remembered how his ignorance of the politics in his world had almost sunk his team a time or two.
In the proper time. And you know me, just as I have known you.
Harley Keener was just as much a mother hen as he was, with the added benefit of being able to talk engineering with Tony. It was a weight off his mind, because there were some things he needed to do, take care of, and he couldn't do all of them at his fella's side. A few days after his return they had all settled into a nice routine. He got a good morning cuddle session in with Tony then chatted with Viz as they got breakfast ready. The android’s main responsibilities were to cut things and ask any questions that were on his mind. He didn't like to judge, but a lot of those questions were weird. Hearing about the way he'd been a bit dizzy over Wanda for a while drew out a scoff. Hearing about her very physical betrayal of him had Steve fuming and ready to fight the witch.
"As soon as I get some training I get to go out on patrol with Spider-Man."
"Get me..." his voice sounded rusty and not his own. He licked his lips and swallowed a few times, staring into bright, concerned blue eyes. "Get me out of here."
"'M fine. Did you see that bus that hit me?"
with a weapon he had improved and redesigned to better fit her needs, and he felt his fear starting to recede to make way for anger. Once upon a time - almost a year ago so maybe she didn't remember - she had met Steve, had laughed with him and liked him... and now she was more than willing to hurt the man he loved with something he'd built with his own two hands.
They will remain anonymous, Ms. Potts. Suffice to say there are concerns. I've been brought in to try and get to the bottom of this and I was assured of your cooperation. Do I need to initiate more formal proceedings?
"Thank for noticing,
Even if it was confusing sometimes, Tony wouldn't give up his new team for the world
"Sir, is this
His heart broke a little, because the kid just looked so damn lost and just a little scared. It was the same helpless look that Pepper used to get. He hadn't liked it then and he sure as hell didn’t like it now. Because Steve and all his kids had turned him into an utter softy, he reached out and drew Harley in for a hug. The teen grabbed on in return and squeezed him fiercely - he couldn't help but notice that Harley had reached the underside of his chin already. Hell, the kid was probably going to be taller than him soon.
I'm well aware - I can see her typing. You should be aware that we are currently being recorded for my records. FRIDAY is learning how to transcribe and would like the practice. I'll send you a copy of our official version of events to make sure they line up. Now. How can I help you?
this."
"I don't know about you two, but I feel underdressed," he said to Steve and Pep, refusing to take his eyes off the rogues. "You should have let me know this was a 'bring
The man looked... good, actually. Better than he'd been expecting. To be honest he'd thought maybe his Bucky would look as rough as Steve Grant's had when they first brought him in. That had been stupid of him, because they weren't the same people, not really. Not in all the little ways that counted for so much when added together. And anyway, he was Winter - why should he echo any Bucky's style?
“Me and J are going to figure something out, promise. If Magneto is going to be our problem more often I'll find a way to--”
While it's nice to see such a unified front, I have to say... I'm still unconvinced about this particular vote. I don't know that the Rogue Avengers should be allowed to come back. Maybe once the legal kerfuffle settles down and they're back on American soil they'll sit down for an interview with me to try and change my mind.
She was patient as well, which was nice. Nat never seemed to mind when it took him a couple seconds to clumsily translate in his head and another few moments to ponder how to answer back in the same language.
Captain America paused halfway to the fridge, and Tony could read hesitation in his expression. He knew that look intimately.
"You keep your mouth shut about anything you may or may not have seen. You tell no one. Not even Nat, Clint."
"I've got a mission for you, if you could-- FUCK."
"Okay, I am the adult here, remember? So--",/p>
"... I. I guess... I guess we're going to talk to Steve."
Now if he could just forget the way Steve had said ‘our kids’ as easily as he breathed everything could get back to normal.
He grinned in answer and caught up to the god, both of them heading for the elevator. "How's things at home?" It was always a risky question, but he tried to ask it regularly. Thor's heavy sigh was answer enough, but he didn't mind when a muscled arm draped over his shoulders. Steve thought he was probably one of the only mortals that could support Thor's full weight and the god took regular advantage of that. It was actually kind of nice, having him lean so heavily against his side. Sometimes it felt like Buck was back, at least in spirit even if Steve would never--
"Winter does not
Despite all of that, all of the doubts and insecurities that plagued him - the way they always had, because he was too damn sensitive - Tony was pretty sure the Avengers liked him. Maybe not as much as he cared about all of them, but still. They still
had been the one to cause Tony to look like that, had managed to make the fella he mooned over that happy.
he was. The sleek, modern touches that littered the spaces around him broke up the well-worn familiarity that would have pushed him over the edge. He could be comfortable here, he realized idly.
'That ain't who I am here. Mebbe Rogers is shit at it, but someone else from this world should take up the mantle, not me.'
"We're going to the range," Winter said in a smooth transition back to English. "Antosha sent some of my weapons here for me." Steve couldn't believe Tony had agreed, couldn't believe Winter had even
cranky.
was leaning.” Out of the corner of his eye he saw Clint dodge a kick from Natasha, who hissed something at him in Russian. Bewildered by the byplay he looked to Steve… who was slowly but steadily turning pink.
Once they were both staring at the bottoms of their bowls, Winter and Shellhead stepped in to herd them again. This time they were led down the hall to their bedroom, which was nice. He was hovering on the edge of sleep again, his belly full and his brain mush. And he probably didn't need Winter to help him change into his pajamas, but it felt sort of nice to float along and not have to worry about anything. Pretty soon he found himself tucked in all nice and sweet, metal fingers running through his hair.
something, no matter how hopeless it had felt. Now all he could do was wait, and he hated it.
"Oh give it a rest. Ya shoot Rogers and I'm gonna have ta arrest ya. So mebbe don't, okay? Try usin' your words."
And really, when he thought about the last couple weeks - Tony's oddness, his talk with Rhodey, his new love of outdoor jogging - Steve could very clearly see the hand of fate. He had been brought to this moment in time for a reason, and who was he to deny that? Who was he to walk away from a moment so clearly crafted just for him?
"What?"
~.~.~
Despite all his bravado and the security of having people who loved him ready to fight at his side, he still winced when the elevator doors slid open. Rogers strode out first - of course he did - with a gun in one hand and that patriotic jaw set in a hard line that almost sent him into a flashback. He could have happily gone the rest of his life never seeing that expression ever again. At least he didn't have to spend too long taking in the details, because Nat - Natasha - exited on Rogers' heels. She
"Antosha accepted me easily enough."
"I'm a grown man--"
"You sure Cap? Didn't you come up here to--"
"Still. What must I give in return for your silence?" With those words, Captain America's cheeks again turned pink. His shoulders hunched as his smile turned unsure, and fuck if the guy didn't look

"I do when they suit me."
Dr. Greene was going to be over the moon to hear that.
"Tony--"
, chances were they'd never have gotten close when they first met. Not when JARVIS' death had still been eating away at his soul. He shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, and since he happened to love this particular gift horse very much…
little display, Loki looked up at the ceiling and smiled. "As I said - souls. I hope we never have to find out if you are right, young lady. I should hate to engage in battle with someone so helpful and delightful as you."
The silence that fell wasn't awkward, exactly, but it wasn't comfortable either. Peter was clearly gearing up to ask him something, but his eyes were also flicking constantly to the table next to them, where there was a group of kids pigging out with some very... interesting creations. Steve's simple vanilla bean yogurt and Peter's even smaller strawberry yogurt seemed plain and almost unappetizing in comparison. That was longing in Peter's eyes, and clearly the teen had chosen budget over anything else.
When it comes to battles, yes. I don't know if you realize this, Mr. Poppleton, but there is more to the Avengers than simply punching bad guys. Mr. Stark has always been heavily involved in making gear for the Avengers--
Next chapter shoooould be up in a few hours. Probably. :'D
was a pretty good explanation for it.
"... yes Boss."
Steve was forced to admit to himself that Winter was right. Layers of black, oversized clothes gave the impression that he was trying to hide, as did the lanky hair that continuously fell across his eyes. Though he was standing absolutely still, he still exuded a twitchy, nervous energy like he was seconds away from bolting. Compared to Winter - whose long, carefully cared for hair almost resembled  lion's mane that nicely complimented his short, immaculately trimmed beard - Bucky looked shabby and unkempt. He was like a shadow, fleeting and timid, while Winter had re-learned how to live loudly and in full color.
"Dunno what you're sayin' exactly but I know you're callin' me names." The further he walked from the elevator with Winter's help, the more he tuned in to his surroundings. Lokes was in his kitchen, dishing out some kind of stew that smelled better than every delicious thing he'd ever eaten. Shellhead was easing Tony forward the same way Winter had him, and STAR was anxiously fluttering between them both, silent and worried and probably a touch angry.
"Oh Tony," Steve's ghost whispered against his temple. "What have they done ta ya, sweetheart?" Fingers began to stroke through his hair, and it was great and horrifying how real his hallucinations had become. More frightening was the way he leaned into the touch even if he knew it couldn't be real. The high whine he could hear was actually coming from his throat, and fuck that would be embarrassing if anyone was there to hear it. "Shhh. I got ya now. It's gonna be okay Tony, and I ain't gonna leave ever again."
