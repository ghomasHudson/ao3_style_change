“Why did you wait till just now, Jarvis,” Tony groaned. “Right now?! I made you to be intelligent to help me! This does not help! You could not wait a few more seconds?!”
Again, Steve helped Tony remove the piece of clothing. Steve ran his hands along Tony’s chest, looking for where the bandages were tied off. Tony observed, “You know, when you first put them on me, I never could have imaged us in this current situation.”
are not going to leave this alone. If there’s something iffy about that thing, we’ll take care of it.”
He was trapped until the suit miraculously came online again or someone release the safety valve inside his neck.
Iron Man’s head dropped and he stopped pushing Norman. Norman was so surprised that he loosened his grip on the superhero. Stark was a hothead. Where was the anger? The retribution?
Brock was yelling and struggling against the hold of the SHIELD agents that had jumped on him. He fell in their hold but continued to reach out to the pooled Venom with clawed hands.
"A better home," Steve agreed and swallowed the toast. Tony followed a moment later and drank the bubbly drink all in one go. Steve also drank all of his and Tony smiled warmly at Steve when he finished.
Venom surged forward with a shriek and Peter flinched back into Bucky’s arms as Tony screamed, “NOW JARVIS!”
Marcel smiled and turned back to the juror box presenting the photo of the floral dress. Staring at the twelve people, whose eyes were focused on the image of the dress with looks of shock equal to that of the witness, Marcel stated, “No more questions. We are done with this witness.”
Tony's eyes shot right back to hers and he nonchalantly shrugged and murmured, "Just making sure everyone is enjoying
“The proposal isn’t what is freaking me out,” Tony countered. “I am worried about what marrying me will do to Steve.”
James drank some of the water from the sink to clean out his mouth and settle his stomach. He pushed himself with a loud huff and then crossed back to where he had dropped his mug and where Natasha sat. He bent down and picked up the pieces of the mug slowly. He finally bucked up the courage and stated, “I love you, you know?”
“Nothing,” Wade squeaked, pulling down on his mask to try to hide himself further. “I said nothing! Just thinking aloud!”
When the elevator opened, the alpha exit for the team members who could fly was already open for him. He jumped into a sprint and leapt from the building, hooting with excitement.
Panzer didn’t question his move. He simply gave Tony more to work with which Tony was grateful for. It was just enough busy work to distract him from his conflicting emotions and the throbbing ache in his chest that wasn’t going away.
Steve tensed in understanding and then instantly fought his captors’ hold. The men grunted but held him strong.
Bucky’s brow was pinched tightly in confusion, but he nodded all the same and sat back down. Pepper brought in the pizza and tossed the two boxes on the coffee table in front of them. She then went to the side table and swiped the remaining vase away from Bucky. She darkly murmured, “I’m going to assassin-proof the house.
He’d been trying to protect Tony but only hurt him in the end. The wall had become a permanent fixture in the dreamscape and, no matter what Steve thought or imagined, he could not get past it.
He was already craving Steve’s embrace, the feel of his weight in his arms. Tony’s arms tightened around the pillow, a pale stand-in for his soulmate…
Steve jumped up and clipped on his helmet. Without another word, he ran to the back of the jet and leapt into the thick of it.
A box with levers and buttons sat in front of the chair and Hydra’s famous symbol was stamped to the front of it for everyone to see as a reminder who was responsible for this machine’s creation. It also had rows of numbers. The numbers were set to the date in his father's journal and Tony did a double take when he saw that. It was further proof this place hadn't been touched since then.
Thor lowered his hammer and murmured, “The Captain may not wake because his body still requires rest...”
Tony gave him his hand and chuckled, “Oh yeah, more than alright. Big explosions are always the best!”
Pepper predicted good reviews for all of them and his story was already trending online as he left the building.
Wade haltingly wrapped his arms around Peter and, feeling tongue-tied, replied, “I-I want to be with you too, Peter, but…”
“We’re going to have to wash the blood out of your hair before seeing Peter,” Tony murmured gently as he steered Steve into the elevator. “Jarvis, take us to my floor.”
After years of honed fighting, both Wade and Peter were fully awake in an instant and separated from each other like they had been training together for years. Wade grabbed a gun from under his pillow and Peter freed his fists from the blankets and faced the intruder.
It was hard to separate himself from his best friend but the rest of Peter’s friends were trickling in and, since it was his birthday party, he had to act as host and help those who knew him as Peter Parker transition into his new life with superheroes and the super powered. With all the outreach programs the Avengers were involved in, the team were well adjusted to getting citizens to relax around them and the two different parts of Peter’s life meshed together easily.
Peter dashed to the elevator and waved to the duo one last time before the door closed. Both of them looked so serious but waved back. Whatever they went through on their mission was still sticking with them.
Howard stuck his head out of the room and waved his assistant over. He gave her direction in order to get his people mobilized and start searching for Steve and thereby the tesseract.
on the team could now lay claim to the fact that they knew what Spidey looked like in his birthday suit.
Silence fell between them as they both got to work, but they were both smiling and the air was electric between them. The Soldier cleaned the guns quickly and his lips never stopped tingling from their kisses.
Sorry for the delay, my internship is nearing its end and they're trying to suck me dry before its end! I'll be done with it by mid December and will have soooo much time to write fics!!!! XD
Several files opened and Jarvis explained, “The team’s statistics are saved onto the hard drive.” The files were sorted in alphabetical order by the team member’s last names. The first was Dr. Bruce Banner and Tony quickly read over his file. He was impressive but didn’t seem to be connected to whatever happened to the time change.
“I don’t want Stark anywhere near this! He is not a part of the initiative. He is a consultant only and I
“He’s an idiot,” Natasha said, shaking her head and rolling of her eyes. “Is that really all he said?”
Tony flushed. He had said that, hadn’t he? And…he meant it. He wanted to check on the both of them. Peter had been hurt and, as they worked on Peter, Wade had looked completely broken. In all of the fights he’d been in with Wade, he’d seen the mercenary be gutted, decapitated, mangled, or worse, but he always kept smiling or joking.
Tony raised himself into the air again and used his camouflage technology to darken his suit to seem more menacing and stated, “Hydra. You are defeated. Stand down or you will deal with me.”
“Well, tell you what, I’ll give him a call right now and you can ask him to pick you up,” the man said, pulling out his phone.
Peter rolled his eyes, he may as well just go along with it now, and he did like to mess with Eddie. He countered, “Please, you’re going to have to do a lot more to get into my pants.”
“You both are here in a consultant capacity only,” Coulson stated. “Dr. Banner you are allowed to make notes and do
As Peter stretched him, he began stroke Wade’s dick and whisper horribly dirty and arousing things into his ear. He didn't think Peter had been capable of coming up with such filth nonetheless say it to him but Wade enjoyed it all the same.
Steve cupped the back of Tony’s head and drew him into a deep kiss. When they split Steve informed him, “I am in love with you and only you.”
Steve’s mind was racing, thinking back to all the different timelines he and Tony had transversed alone and together.
If Wade had woken up when Peter had needed him, he would have been able to grab a hold of him and stop Venom like he had last time.
He looked absolutely ridiculous and did not imagine looking like this when he saw Tony again but…when he crashed his plane, he didn’t think he was going to be seeing anyone ever again.
Tony smirked as he remembered the first time he noticed Steve’s telltale sign of lust. The gulp alone made his cock twitch with interest.
“Years apart though, Peg? And why go after the Project Rebirth guys two decades later? We are nothing without Erskine. We can’t make another super solider without him.”
“Peter, you should not break that,” Steve stated gently and took the large branch from Peter’s grasp. He stabbed it into the ground so it looked like it grew there. In a few days it would die but by then no one would question how it happened. Steve looked around them to make sure no one noticed Peter’s abnormal strength.
Steve sighed and shook his head. He wordlessly pulled his shirt over his head and dropped his sweats and boxers and joined Tony in the shower.
His Tony looked at him with warm eyes and a smile threatening to crack his lips if it hadn't already. His Tony wouldn’t have let go of his hand and would be giving him his hourly reminder that he loved him.
Wade snorted and replied, “I think Peter Parker has been surprised by one too many times and if a super villain tries this again, he or she will be very surprised when Tony Stark’s supposedly normal son turned out to be a little stronger than most.”
“I really hope both of you do not do anything like that again anytime soon because I do not think my heart can handle the stress,” Peter stated earnestly, leaning against the foot of Steve’s bed.
Though now…He snuck an appraising glance over the rest of Tony’s profile. An exciting thrill ran through him as he viewed his mate. It still felt forbidden but it made it all the greater that it was no longer bad. From his nice build to his dark eyes, the man was handsome.
“We made out and you almost made love to me on my couch!” Steve replied, with a slight shove to Tony’s shoulder. “
“Yes! You still haven’t won her over yet so you failed! We’ll start Project Winterwidow Part Four tomorrow!
Iron Man stood to Tony’s right, Gabe was on his left and had his fingers on Tony’s wrist, counting his heartbeat. The other two stood at the foot of Tony’s makeshift cot. Tony was in the middle of saying to Gabe, “- type of metal. So anything to counteract metal poisoning I guess…”
19 years was a long time...He didn't know what he was going to find and that was the most frightening part. What had become of his son in all of those years? How different was he from Tony? How much happier was he without him?...and how much better off was he without Tony in his life?
But now their cuddle session was coming to an end and Tony only wanted to get Steve back into his arms.
Bucky stopped breathing as he did it. In fact, it seemed everyone did and the only noise to be heard was the hiss of the metal.
Tony’s arms immediately wrapped around his head, pulling Steve in closer and tighter, like he was afraid to let go.
“Fine,” Steve replied. He joked, “I just got some sand in some very uncomfortable places right now!”
Two could play at that game. Steve bent over Tony and trailed his kisses down: licking along the pulse in his neck and nibbling at his collarbone. He stopped at the reactor, not knowing how to proceed and, as he looked at it, he noted some bruising.
Peter’s brow pinch in confusion and then he looked over his shoulder to the thing moving on his back. He murmured, “Don’t worry, it’s just Venom, my bio-shield, I’m using it as my new Spidey suit.”
But he couldn’t curse him with such a future. The ghost of his father was right, it was a fate worse than death.
Everything outside looked too bright with pastels and white light. It was too clean the buildings, the air, even the sounds…especially the sound of the radio. He couldn’t believe it was real.
They mapped out their fake relationship the rest of the night. Deciding on what the milestones of their relationship would be and crafting it to be believable and, as Tony quoted, “boring enough” that even the skeptics would have trouble finding faults.
Peter felt ill at the thought. Would Tony Stark release this? Even with the negative reaction he got from Peter?
Tony began to lather up his face with slumped shoulders and whined, “You're enjoying this aren't you?”
“No one else is going to breach the Tower ever again,” Tony promised him and rubbed his back. Peter’s lip trembled but he nodded bravely. It drew Steve to his son’s other side and he knelt beside the couch.
“I don’t care what it is! I need to save my family!” Clint hissed. “We need to split up. I won’t risk my wife or children!”
“Captain America needs to keep his glorious ass on that side of the country,” Tony stated with obviously forced humor. “Look Cap, the Mandarin hinted at bigger things to come. You know these wackos always go for New York first or if they want to be ‘original’ then D.C. The majority of the major cities are on your side of the country. Last I heard, Nat and Clint were in Afghanistan. You, Thor, and Bruce keep an eye on the east coast. I will keep an eye on the west.”
For the next few days, Tony wanted to relive Steve's glory days. They reenacted scenes from his past or constructed entirely new ones. The dreamscape reflected the forests of France, Italy, or Germany and they created giant shadowy figurines that stood in place for Hydra agents or the Howling Commandos. Tony had the time of his life and Steve would catch the boy smiling at him with sparkling eyes.
“I won’t tell if you don-,” Tony barely got the last word out before Steve was shamelessly kissing him again. Tony chuckled into his mouth and told himself to remember to seduce Steve by dirty dancing more often. After that, any form of rational thought left him when Steve reached into his underwear and grasped his cock.
“Yes, the big mouth,” Howard chuckled, leaning back into his chair. “When do I get to meet the lucky guy and make him ridiculously uncomfortable?”
Steve left without a word to anyone. He feared Ben would be the voice of reason. Or, with one look at Peter, he would realize how stupid he was being. Bruce would have done all within his power, save using the Hulk, to stop him and would probably have SHIELD on him before he stepped outside the building. Thor could do nothing because he was still in California, refusing to give up.
She threatened to quit because she thought he was going to kill himself and it tore Tony up inside to hear her vocalize the words. He hated that he made her think that way, but it hurt more to think of her not in his life anymore.
without Peter…” Steve countered, lightly stroking the side of Tony’s face. His voice dropped below a whisper and he hovered closer to him, their faces only centimeters apart as he said, “Tony, I want to save Peter from anymore suffering. If Bruce and Mary find a cure then they can use it on me but if not…if not – then I will sacrifice myself for him.”
Steve and Tony sat nearby on a bench. Steve wore his usual glasses and baseball cap and Tony wore designer glasses, his hair slicked back, and a fake beard.
They went back to work though they kept shooting him and Natasha sidelong glances. Natasha went into the quinjet and he followed her as closely as her shadow. They bypassed the seats and the team’s lockers until they reached the back where the large weapon’s locker was kept. She unlocked it and opened it without a second glance behind her shoulder. If Stark or the others were here, they’d be pointing out the danger of having him so close to such a large cache of weapons, especially since they fixed his arm.
Tony had been his best friend for years and he helped keep him together first after he woke, then after the Winter Soldier-Hydra fiasco, and then again with Peter. They had been best friends for years and Steve had been attracted to him for months and they had already dated for a few weeks but their compatibility was so great that Steve knew they were meant to be...
“You – You goddamn, jerk,” Steve cried. He wasn’t sure which of them moved first but one moment they were both staring at each other and the next there were crushing each other in a tight embrace.
That is why, twenty years later, frozen in the ice in a comatose state, Steve’s implant beeped and began its countdown as it finally found a connection with a newly inserted implant on one Antony Edward Stark.
“Yes, Tony. I am dead,” Steve whispered and his heart broke as he saw the devastating truth wash over the little boy.
Steve glanced around the room to see if there was a computer or phone he could use to contact his family but he was not so fortunate with this factor.
“Good luck,” Tony stated with a chuckle. Steve smirked in agreement. Bucky might not tell him anything in fear of Natasha’s wrath but he had to try.
Steve was ushered to the defense’s table and Tony quickly took the seat Natasha had saved for him directly behind Steve. He reached forward and grasped Steve shoulder reassuringly and Steve placed his hand over Tony’s and smiled gratefully at him.
Peter’s gaze snapped back to the photo of his father and desperately searched for anything recognizable.
Peter opened his eyes and smiled weakly at him. He leaned into Wade's hold and sighed, “You saved me, my prince.”
“And I have someone else with me who’d like to thank you for being here,” Tony said, and he turned to hold his hand out to Steve.
They were trying to figure out what to do with him. He and Venom could no longer be separated. The symbiote was a part of him now. It had given up on Peter and had finally accepted him.
“And…well…you saw what happened… I'm being held with this guy, Yensen, he says it would be impossible for someone to find us. We're underground, in a series of caves…I have to find another way out…”
Nonetheless he could not help but reflect on his old feelings. The old Bucky was still in that damaged shell just as the old Steve was somewhere inside himself.
Steve readily climbed into the bed with him and held on to Tony like he was the only thing keeping him on this Earth. Tony held him just as tightly as Steve muffled his sobs into Tony’s shoulder.
– I was looking for a photo,” Wade began with the easiest and most obvious statement. He felt his cheeks begin to heat. “A ph-photo for…”
The hours ticked by and they left behind their serious talk to laugh about the little nuances in life.
Steve mentally smacked himself again. Peggy was already fishing for Tony’s last name. Why did Steve have to be friends with so many people who were intelligence gatherers?
He and Steve discussed how well his friend was doing on the mission and in real life but, in the back of his mind, Tony worried over the problem that was Wade Wilson and the possible solutions to getting rid of him.
Tony was pretty sure SHIELD was still clueless about his relationship with Steve. So he collected his emotions and turned back and carefully asked, “What happened?”
Peter buried his face in May’s chest and the older woman placed a comforting hand on his back. Her lips were pursed in a thin, tight line, containing her upset and she looked down at her nephew with sad resignation.
Heimdall focused his gaze to the origin of the call. Thor, the Lady Sif, and the Warriors Three stood weary but victorious in an open field, realms away from Asgard. Thor was grinning up at the sky and such an expression told Heimdall his prince was exuberant about their latest victory. Heimdall lifted his sword and dropped it into the key slot, opening the bridge for his prince.
“I think I would like to wait until Wade is fully healed but, after, I have this urge to see Bruce.”
Steve’s eyes flickered up and met his and he hoarsely replied, “No…well, yes. I never cried like that before…”
Brock gulped and then whispered, “But it is still a biological entity so, theoretically, like us, certain things can hurt it but…but whatever we use could hurt Peter too.”
“Good afternoon to you too,” Bucky grumbled. He looked like he was in the middle of eating a sandwich but stopped to properly glare at Tony. Tony shot the man a wily grin and went straight to the coffee pot.
Tony returned the reactor to his chest with a heavy sigh and then looked to the Iron Man suit. He solemnly stated, “I can’t charge you anymore, Jarvis.”
With his other hand, Tony was unlocking all the secrets the flash drive had to hide, hacking SHIELD with Sam’s laptop, and making it look like the hack was coming from a small library in southern Maine. He wished for his holloscreens but made due with Sam’s outdated laptop and kept most of his grumbling about lack of a touchscreen to a minimum.
He popped open the bottle and downed the pills dry. They wouldn’t go into effect immediately and, the way his heart was beating frantically, he doubted he’d be able to fall back asleep any time soon.
Venom tried to slip away but Tony’s suit was locked onto its genetic code and automatically moved with it.
Peter’s stomach clenched as he remembered the feedings. They were his most vivid memories and probably will be as such for the rest of his life.
Natasha kicked him hard between the legs and he loosened his grip immediately with a groan. The man lurched to his feet and stumbled back but Natasha sat up sharply and was able to stab him in the shin before he got too far away.
It was a small town and early enough in the morning that not many people were out. The town was old and Steve was finally able not to feel too out of place. He spotted the familiar steeple of a church, rising out of the trees, and, like a moth to a flame, Steve was drawn to it.
Tony and Steve turned toward Peter and each draped an arm over him. Steve rubbed Peter’s chest and Tony patted his belly. Neither questioned him as to why he was there because it was obvious. This was the first time the Tower had been breached since Loki attacked New York and Peter had not been born at that point. It must have been frightening for him to suddenly realize their home was not a perfect haven.
Tony just found Steve. After all of these years of searching and waiting, he finally had his mate. They just indirectly told each other they loved each other
In their afterglow, they lay shoulder-to-shoulder as their breathing returned to normal. Steve carded his fingers into Tony’s and then brought his husband’s hand up to his mouth and kissed his knuckles.
Peter would be safer without him. He could grow up with Ben and May and no would have to know he was Steve's son. He would have an ordinary, safe childhood. Steve could not give that to him. It sickened him to think it but horrified him more with the truthfulness to it. Peter really would be better off without him. If he had been Richard's son instead of Steve's he would have never been experimented on by Hydra, he would have never been terrorized by Loki or General Ross, he would have grown up knowing his mother, and he would never have to worry about avoiding the paparazzi or a villain bent on revenge against Steve.
“All the snot you’ll get on your shirt is your own fault for talking like that,” Peter mumbled, rubbing his face into Steve’s chest.
“He would have killed her inside the quinjet when he had the chance,” Stark stated. He was already in his suit but the face shield was up. He looked at the Soldier and asked, “Right?”
Tony cupped Steve’s neck and Steve’s sky blue eyes rose to meet his. Tony smiled at him and earnestly replied, “It’s no problem, Steve…”
Bucky pulled back, his lips slightly red from Steve’s, attesting to what he just did. He hissed, “Don’t look for me.”
“He makes me laugh,” Peter countered, his heart breaking as he had to defend one man he cared about from another he also cared for. “He gets me. He knows both sides to me and he’s been there for me ever since the media found out I was your son! I
It took Peter a moment to remember the meaning to the acronym and then he burst out laughing. He knew there were websites that “shipped” his dad with Steve, he’d come across them when he first found out Tony was his father and researched him. He found it hilarious that Wade was one of
Peter leaned toward him and lightly kissed Wade, breaking him out of his line of thinking. Peter murmured, “I’m going to take a shower and drink half a pot of coffee.”
“Yeah, before Hydra got you,” Tony replied. Bucky stiffened and adverted his eyes from the picture. He started to shake and Tony worried his lip with his teeth before asking, “Do you want me to take these down?”
Peter lazily blinked open his eyes and stared at him with such happiness that Wade chickened out. He basked in Peter’s gaze for a few seconds and then he murmured, “I trust you.”
As he stared at the sleeve, it moved and covered the rest of his arm and hand. He watched in fascination as it spun around each individual finger until he lost all sight of his flesh.
She dropped the photo like it burned her and Ben’s shoulders dropped with it. He bent down and grunted in pain as exerted his bad knee. He picked up the picture carefully, as if the image of Peter was as precious as the boy himself.
The unit was too large to move by train so they were marching to the base. Under normal conditions, it’d probably had taken them a week…but, since they were traveling through a war-torn countryside with Axis and Hydra agents possibly hiding behind every corner, they had to move
Wade carded his fingers into Peter’s hair and he held onto him like he was the tether that held him down to the Earth. He was never going to grow used to those words leaving Peter’s mouth nor the idea that it was true. Wade, the miserable human being that he was…was loved, and by Peter no less.
Peter pulled off the rest of his clothes and Wade was gifted with the beautiful sight of Peter well sculpted butt.
Steve did not really wake up until he remembered why he was there and then all his emotional turmoil came crashing back into him. He fell back into the mattress and stared up at the ceiling. His tears had dried on his face and his cheeks were caked with the dried salty liquid. His throat was raw and his head hurt.
“I am sorry, Sir. I am unable to connect to the server. Suit systems are returning to optimum function, but outside communication is very limited. I cannot get a reading on
“It’s alright,” he said as he waved her off. He stepped past the suits and asked Bucky, “You’re not going to hurt me, are you?”
She returned to where she left the food with a slight spring he’d seen her practicing in her ballet classes.
Wade was in his Deadpool uniform again but he was holding some flowers. He stood as soon as Peter landed and announced, “These flowers are so gay but it’s okay because what we’re doing is gay…Though technically we’re both bi, which is why there are two different kinds of flowers here: Roses and daisies.” Wade covered his eyes and groaned, “I know I am a dork.”
There was a collective chuckle from the small gathering. Steve was so happy that Bucky’s barb went unnoticed. His best friend had become ordained as a surprise for their wedding. It felt right having him there. He had been there at the beginning of their relationship and it seemed right to have him there as they took the next big step.
Steve quickly separated the distance between them and held him as tightly as he could. Tony did the same and both of them silently cried the rest of the night, neither never letting go of the other.
“My room,” Steve replied breathlessly, his entire body tingling with excitement and anxiety. Tony’s hazel eyes grew a shade darker as desire settled in and he licked his lips. Steve whispered pointedly to Tony, his voice on the verge of shuddering, “I won’t need the bed.”
Tony grasped his arm and corrected, “All of us. It hurt all of us but there’s no way in hell we’re going to let it kill any of us…Be there for Peter, Steve. Keep an eye on that monster, don’t let it hurt anyone else.”
Peter noted the physicist trying to process exactly how he did it so, to distract him, Peter dived into telling them everything he and Eddie had done in the experiments. He neglected to mention the alien symbiote fused with their shield. Both would have become wary about it and would demand it to be quarantined until they better understood it. But Peter had interacted with it and his very DNA was infused with it. The shield was no danger to any of them.
Tony tightened his hold on his briefcase and said, “There is still one nonviolent way to subdue the symbiote.”
They both got so wrapped up in each other that they didn’t even think of what was going on outside of their own personal heaven until there was a knock on the door a few minutes later followed by Tony saying, “Would either of you care to explain why Pepper is ranting about Instagram and I’m getting emails from practically ALL of the major news stations on the planet??”
He did not know how long he lay there. It felt like a million years of agonizing waiting and slow, slow healing. A huge explosion jarred him from his focus.
The doctor peered inside and then turned to them, saying, “No one’s here but there’s a message for us.”
“He survived the crash, was frozen, and Fury just called me to tell me he kicked SHIELD’s ass thinking they were Hydra and is now running around New York!” Tony laughed, his eyes beginning to brim with tears.
Steve stepped up to his soulmate and pressed his hips into Tony’s and hooked his fingers on Tony’s hip bones. He murmured, “Maybe I’ve been thinking about what it’d be like adopting another kid.”
Wade shifted his weight and moved his body against Peter to better fit with him. They were chest-to-chest and Peter opened his legs so Wade could mold himself even closer to Peter.
She didn’t care about the danger at that point or the fact that James was referring to their love in the past-tense. She fell to her knees and drew her soulmate into her embrace. He pressed his face into the crook of her neck and did not make a noise and barely shook as he cried onto her shoulder.
“No,” Steve chided, sitting up with him. He reached out to Tony and lightly grasped his knee and said, “Just promise you will not go straight to Peter and demand they break up. Hear your son out before judging the man he’s seeing.”
Steve’s heart clenched and his head snapped up to meet Tony’s eyes. His expression was hurt and he was shaking his head as if to deny the truth.
When the volume got to a manageable level, Steve gave him a little squeeze and stated, “And we decided we didn’t want to wait so, we invite you to join us for our wedding.”
“Tony is my boyfriend,” Steve whispered in cautious explanation as he slowly sat himself up. As the back of his head pounded painfully, his last moment of consciousness filtered back to him. Did Bucky remember him? Or should he be treading cautious ground right now? Was he dealing with the Winter Soldier again?
Bucky glanced down at his shoulder, now bare of the red star. He put his hand over it and looked at Tony with a conflicted gaze. Finally, he whispered, “Can I think on it?”
A heavy fog lay over the town and the chill in the air made goosebumps rise up along his arms. He’d run away with no shoes, cargo pants, and a thin shirt. He was filthy after running through the sewers and riding out in the open on the train. Tony was going to make fun of him for stinking so much.
It was so strange with their roles reversed. It felt like a lifetime ago his dad was worrying about coming out with Steve but now here Peter was, wanting and worrying about coming out with Wade.
“I know so,” Steve replied and Tony awarded him with one of the happiest smiles he had ever seen to split the man’s face. It was powerful enough to make Steve feel like he had fallen in love with Tony all over again.
Tony nodded and took in a deep breath and pulled away stating, “We brought your uniform. Clint should have it.”
He pulled Tony to his feet and Tony leaned heavily into his boyfriend’s side. Steve effortlessly guided him to the small bathroom attached to the workshop.
Peter laughed and kissed Wade’s pout with a smile stretching his lips. He then slid out of Wade’s embrace and the bed. He playfully murmured, “I am filthy, join me in the shower?”
Steve did, laying out everything that had happened between him and Tony last night and earlier that morning. Bucky listened with a blank expression but cloudy eyes that Steve could not read.
Tony stated, “Coulson didn’t notice anything – he just saw your shoes. It’s not going to create this grand conspiracy that Captain America’s hiding out at my place.
Bucky had both his hands on his throat and was snarling like an animal. When their eyes connected, Bucky’s hold tensed then fell away altogether.
“Okay,” Steve replied, his eyes only staying on Natasha for a moment as his gaze was drawn back to Tony’s smiling face. He didn’t notice Natasha’s eyes studying the spot where Steve’s hand rested on Tony’s shoulder.
“You love me?” Steve hissed in disbelief. The broken bits of his heart healed at a rapid rate and he began to breathe more shallowly.
Seeing the love of your life for possibly the last time was far from “simple.” He could barely breathe as he walked toward Tony’s slumbering form.
“...This is the worst of it right now, Peter,” Pepper consoled, her hand moved from his arm to his back and rubbed comforting circles there. “It will die down eventually.”
Tony smirked at the irony and replied, “What I’m thinking of is going to need to be believable and unquestionably shows we are together.” Tony paused to let Steve speak but when the Super Soldier did not say anything, Tony continued, “We are going to kiss and we are going to look like we mean it.”
at least found a little something. The AI had recorded this guy running by the property twice a day for the last week in the least. In other words,
Bucky had a smile on his face. It was small and barely curved the edges of his lips but it was there as he spoke to Peter. It fell upon their appearance. It still managed to stop Steve in his tracks.
Bucky grasped his shoulder and made the man look away from the core. He stated, “You need to do this now, Howard, or Tony will die! Stop over thinking it.
Steve instantly left the balcony and ran inside, calling out to the AI inside the buliding, “Jarvis??”
The first half of the month no one saw Steve or Tony so the public did not know of the sad period Steve went through but the second half of that month was spent out with them in the public eye and they showed everyone they were together, happy, and confident. Their relationship quickly became so mainstream that the paparazzi were asking them more questions about the coming trial instead of their liaison.
“Yes…” And there goes his heart rate. Right back to super speed. Tony cleared his throat and grasped Steve’s hands. He murmured, “I wanted to celebrate our 5 year, 3-month anniversary.”
Tony fired again before the soldier could get up and the Hydra agent flopped back down and didn’t move.
He knew what Schmidt planned and he had to stop him! Tony would instantly assume the worst! Tony would-!
It was louder outside and if he went anywhere near any of the fence, Peter knew they would be able to see him from the front. Luckily, his dad left the suit near the back of the house but…overhead, helicopters circled. He felt their metallic eyes on him instantly and dropped his gaze. He took another breath to steady himself and then Peter walked up to the suit, trying to stand as tall as possible, which was hard in all of the clangor…
They helped each other up and the jerk picked a tomato out of his dark hair as he asked, “What were they wailing on you about anyways?”
“Oh no, just living out two—no, three—fantasies right now. All good, Steve, all good,” Tony whispered hoarsely and cupped his crotch, adjusting it slightly under the towel.
Steve hissed as Tony’s hot hand began to stroke him. Steve automatically rutted into Tony’s hand. He instantly flushed from embarrassment from his behavior but loved it all the same. It was better than he had imagined it. Tony’s hands were calloused and smaller than Steve’s but he rubbed him in all the right ways.
After all the agents were booted out, Tony gave Bucky a tour of the place. The ex-Commando checked all the exits and tested the locks. Tony let him move a potted fern in front of one particular window he did not like and even let him move one of the couches five inches to the right for whatever reason. He seemed to approve of the metal shutters and Tony said he’d keep them down until Bucky said so. Bucky nodded, giving him the impression he wasn’t going to waking up to views of the water anytime soon.
Peter tried to sit up, his entire body protesting from the impact. Venom’s tendrils, wildly jumped around him and whatever people that were around him backed away with shouts of frightened exclamation upon sighting the alien.
Wade’s grin was almost feral and that giddiness Peter had felt tingled into a thrill that shot down Peter’s spine with the velocity of a firework.
“Schmidt?” Sneaky asked, cocking his head to the side. He hit the side of his head and said, “Oh yeah, the Red Skull! Yeah, no, didn’t find him or his glowy key to the future.”
Vision wordlessly bent down and scooped the larger man into his arms. Vision and the agents moved with Wanda, keeping their guns pointed at the figure floating in front of her.
Steve would have been able to handle Mary’s hate. It would have been horrible but he would have endured it for his son. But if Mary thought of Peter as a monster…
“…Would you like to hear about the latest Stark Enterprise Stock Exchange prices or the rising attention in the media to your date last night?”
When he crashed the plane, he thought he was the unluckiest person on the planet to have lost so much but now…now he felt like the luckiest.
“Just a ‘fashionable’ new chest piece and your life is all,” Steve quoted ironically, rolling his eyes. “The next time we fight some dastardly villain, please protect your ‘fashionable’ chest piece.”
Steve quickly wiped at his eyes and huskily said, “I’m sorry.” Sam instantly lightly rubbed his hunched shoulder and Steve’s eyes overflowed and he cupped his hand over his eyes to hide the tears from his friend. He repeated with a shuddering cry, “I-I’m sorry. I’m so sorry…”
“I’m sorry, Sir,” Jarvis replied. “But it seems a powerful firewall has just been installed to Oscorp Tower’s security networks. Viewing Oscorp Tower is no longer a ‘cake walk’ as you so eloquently put it.”
“He is checking in on Master Barnes,” Jarvis replied and Tony released a deep breath that he had not realized he had been holding. He was not too late.
Tony darkly mulled over it. Steve was born in an era that outlawed what they were going to portray and his own religion called it a sin… He may have adapted to the 21
“I don’t doubt that, Nat,” Steve retorted. Tony had made it abundantly clear that he liked Steve’s body. He flushed again as he remembered the feel of Tony’s erection pressed against him. Steve explained, “And that’s not why I am stupid. I’m stupid because, for a moment, I thought it could be more than just lust…”
Tony fell back onto the cot and groaned, “Great, you’re worse than me. Pepper is going to have an emotional crisis…who will she mother the most?” He sat up and teased, “With your baggage, I think you’re going to move into her number one spot.”
Tony put his hand over the reactor and hesitated for only a second before turning the reactor and removing it from his chest. He placed it down on the counter and stepped away from it and sat down on a workbench, staring at the glowing object with trepidation.
He closed his eyes and thought back to that night, the heat of Tony’s touch, the weight of his body against his, and the soft press of his lips. Steve bit down on his lips as his cock throbbed for attention whilst he reminisced.
Steve laughed and pushed the man along. Their meal consisted of fresh oatmeal with brown sugar and raisins, a slice of hot toast, a small cup of canned peaches, greasy bacon, and an uncracked, hard-boiled egg. Tony slowed to a stop, staring down at his tray. Steve bumped Tony with his hip to move him along and Tony did but he was still frowning at his tray.
“And…tell him to not let my death drag him down. Tell him to live on and find another person to love. We could have had a future but it’s not going to ha-happen.” His voice finally broke and he took a shuddering breath and tightly stated, “Tell him to find someone else to spend the rest of his life with and to be happy.”
“We’re going to be really old by then if we’re fretting over our great-grandchildren,” Steve commented with a sad grin.
Steve flushed and quickly buttoned up his jeans. Then his adorable super soldier took one look at Tony in nothing but his tiny boxer briefs and then stepped in front of him to guard his decency, making Tony snort.
Did she look at him like that as she weighed the pros and cons of whether or not to kill him? Had her face been so blank?
He was saying it more to himself than the Captain. He was affirming the fact in his mind, making it real…He was telling himself that there was more to himself than what he had been programed. He once had a will of his own and if he reached out enough he might be able to grab it.
Tony struggled to sit up and his entire body was shaking just by pushing himself up to his elbows. Steve got up and stopped him by grabbing his shoulders before he could hurt himself.
The blast doors he’d shot down were now attached to the wall and looked practically new with not even a single bullet hole.
He forcibly sat between them, breaking them apart and wrapped his arms around their shoulders. Tony instantly frowned at him, displeased by his presence. A ghost of Steve's touch remained on his flesh and he ran his fingers over his chin as if to make sure he really was no longer there.
With his newly discovered and unexpected frame of mind, Tony wasn’t sure how he was going to react to his lover. He still wasn’t sure how he was going to handle his scheduled death. He pushed it out of the forefront of his mind but it was still lurking in the background.
Tony’s hand was warm in his as they walked through Central Park. His grasp found Steve’s easily enough, more so by the fact Steve made sure to hold Peter with one hand and kept his free hand by Tony. Tony grasped his hand quickly and, as he did, grinned up at Steve like a child who had found his favorite toy.
The President and agent wordlessly unbuckled themselves and it undeterred them from their work as they continued to weigh the benefits and cons to the embargo. Steve effortlessly droned them out and focused on the noises of the plane as he stared at the door.
“The Young Osborn,” Uncle Thor murmured with recognition. “But what of supervision? Your parents do not like to leave you alone without elders.”
Peggy’s voice dropped an octave lower and Howard wasn’t able to clearly discern her words but Tony’s paling face and growing horrified expression left no doubt.
If this worked then the next and final step would be to add their DNA. Peter tore his eyes from the dark mixture to look at his friend. When they study the final results, would he notice the minute differences in Peter's DNA? Should he confide in Eddie about his other life? If he kept his secret about being him being in a gay relationship, would he keep Spidey a secret too?
me,” Bucky hissed to Steve. “It looked like you two were five seconds from sucking on each other's faces.” He leaned in closer to Steve and in an even lower voice, grumbled, “
“Even the Hydra time machine was based off Tony’s design?” Steve gasped and sat down heavily beside Tony.
The Avengers murmured their confirmations then shouldered their away bags and slipped into the mansion. Steve made it over the threshold before Natasha got a hold of him and dragged him in the opposite direction the rest of the team was going.
Steve put down the tub and openly stared at the robot as its eyes followed his movements. He replied, “It’s – ugh – nice to meet you too?”
He had not fooled Pepper, who knew his entire schedule better than Tony. He had to beg her on his hands and knees to not tell Steve. She assumed he only did it to drink. She assumed it was a lapse in his recovery. She did not know there was more to the story. She only agreed not to tell Steve if he promised to use a Breathalyzer daily so she could make sure he did not go back on the wagon.
He could barely remember the last time he reacted to another like this. His college sweetheart? She broke his heart and he swore off love.
Natasha ran the back of her fingers over his cheek in a quick caress and then drew away to cock the gun. She commanded, “Let’s go back to the cold room.”
“Well, consider me surprised! Um, this is my friend, Sam Wilson. Sam, this is Tony,” Steve introduced them to each other.
When Tony and Peter left, Peter with a full belly and Tony with a large mug of coffee, Steve ventured into the living room.
The Red Skull came across another super soldier. The man was the long departed Captain’s companion but he had been broken and molded into a puppet. The man was weak whereas the Red Skull’s was still his own. It was the only reason he let the man live. The Red Skull took pleasure in ordering him to do things that would make Erkine's soft heart break.
The rest of the week was mostly a debate between Phil and Pepper, over what Steve would wear. First, they discussed whether or not he’d wear the Army’s dress uniform or a tuxedo like Tony. Once they finally decided on the dress uniform they then got into a debate whether he’d wear the more modern navy blue uniform or the one from his era that was olive green.
Wade reached for it with no hesitation and pulled it off with one hand. Peter took one look at his boyfriend’s sad eyes and reached out to Wade with open arms. He whispered huskily, “Come here, babe.”
He felt unstoppable. Obadiah was dead and buried several months now and he was still living off the high of being recognized more for being Iron Man other than a rich playboy or warmonger. So exploring an old building should have been more of an adventure than a dangerous ordeal.
It was more than just an image they could determine the future – it was their future – the future he and Tony dreamed of. A future in which they’d marry, and they’d take this photo, posed in the way so both of their wedding bands were shown: Steve’s hand, clutching Tony’s cheek and the Tony’s hand pressed against Steve’s heart. Both rings were still visible in the picture and it gave Steve hope.
“She attacked me first,” Bucky hissed, his face red from Natasha’s thighs crushing his windpipe. “I am only defending myself.”
Peter nodded but Tony countered, “But your supervisor would understand if you wanted to call out for the day.”
Steve came first and he collapsed heavily onto Tony. But his amazing boyfriend did not leave him hanging and he crawled down Tony’s chest, pressing kisses into his flesh as he went, and he finally took him into his mouth. Tony barely had a chance to grasp Steve’s head before he came.
“Yeah, he got hit on the head and now he’s feeling sick, but he says it’s not concussion sick so can you look him over?” Steve gasped out the words in one breath and had to inhale sharply after getting it all out.
Schmidt smiled and Tony’s spine tingled unpleasantly. What was going on in that freaky skull of his?
With a racing heart, Tony leaned in and cautiously placed a hand on Steve’s chest. Steve’s heart was beating just as frantically beneath his touch. Was this really happening? Could Steve be interested in him? He whispered hopefully, "St-Steve?"
“Yes,” Steve replied answering her last question more than her first. It’d been a few weeks since he first came. He did not know what the “intricate matters” she was speaking of were however…
“He told me he loved me,” Steve whispered, staring straight ahead like Tony. From the corner of his eye he saw Tony twitch. Neither of them told the other that they loved each other. Steve loved him and he knew Tony cared for him deeply. Steve winced and dropped his head as he felt himself grow smaller. Tony did not say anything so Steve whispered, “He kissed me…and…and I — I kissed him…”
Natasha was sitting on a bench overlooking a small park a block away from the ballet studio. She’d been in her new cover for a good two months and was patiently waiting for two things to happen.
Her eyes flickered down to where he was touching his implant and she murmured, “James will never respond to Clint. He has no connection to him.”
His eyes seemed to actually focus on hers for the first time since they were reunited. He wasn’t looking at her as an objective to eliminate. He was looking at her as a person and he stated, “I knew
His nurses left without a fuss and Tony clutched his wheelchair arms tightly, preparing himself for the worst. Bruce came up behind him and grasped his shoulder. Tony leaned into his touch, thankful for his friend’s support.
“Sir, after reviewing my scans, I have determined the angle of the bullet and, according to my calculations, the shooter was level with Master Roger’s apartments,” Jarvis stated.
“Oh my God,” Steve gasped, his voice laced with a combination of horror and restricted laughter. He explained, “This is a baseball Peter and no son of mine will not know what it is! Thank you, Bucky! We’ll make a Dodger fan out of him yet!”
“Believe it or not, I had to choose between meeting the Norse God of Thunder or talking to you. So, you should consider yourself lucky.”
Natasha scrambled to her feet and glared daggers at him. When he met her angry gaze, she yelled in Russian, “What were you thinking?? I thought you were being civil! I haven’t forgiven you yet and you think this is the best way to treat me when I finally give you a chance?? Don’t you understand my feelings on the matter??”
“’It’s nothing’ says the man making goo-goo eyes at the man of his dreams who he just so happened to walk off into the woods alone with today
When he, Peter, and Tony came back from the zoo she was waiting for them in the common room. She already knew who Peter was and as soon as they stepped off the elevator she told Steve she wanted to hold her godchild.
Natasha holstered her weapon and walked up to Bucky’s side of the bed. She and Bucky never broke eye contact and her eyes narrowed as she stared down at him. Out of nowhere, she slapped him. Bucky took the slap without protest and stared blankly at the wall over Natasha’s shoulder.
Bucky’s hands suddenly grabbed Tony, his fingers digging deep into his flesh. He gasped, “I’d be crazy not to...”
He closed his eyes and his mind ruminated on the parallels. He remembered looking down at the handsome stranger from the future, who trusted Steve with his life and the fate of the future itself. He had taken advantage of the time traveler’s closed eyes and had checked him out. And maybe had touched Tony a little more than usual just because he could with a hand to the shoulder, fingers tilting his chin, just as Tony was doing now.
Bucky let his head fall back over the couch and he murmured, “I love you, Steve. I always have and I always will.” Steve’s heart dropped at his words. This was not where he wanted the conversation heading. The anger that churned in his gut immediately frosted over into an icy fear.
She was an older woman with white hair cut short in a fluffy pixie style. She wore the traditional black robes and dark square glasses. She met Steve’s gaze and held it as he walked into the room. He was led to his lawyers, the handcuffs were removed, and he was seated in a plush chair. The lawyers murmured something to him but he did not hear them. All of his attention was focused on this woman as their gazes were still locked.
“Logan called me yesterday,” Natasha stated. “He went to spar with Wade but found Peter there too, with this ‘shield.’ Logan said it didn’t smell good.”
Bucky went flying across the room and landed in a crouch, catching himself with his metal fingers digging into the mat. His stare was cold as he said, “Stop fighting. You can’t stop it. These memories are worthless. They are getting in the way of the mission. You must never let anything get in the way of the mission.”
Peter’s lower lip jutted out. He pouted at Steve, like he had done many times to get his way. It was as if Steve somehow held sway over the universe and Peter expected his father to snap his fingers and produce Tony in an instant.
Peter's eyes trailed from the lube in his hand and back to his face. The flush was still on Peter's cheeks but a light entered his eyes that wasn't there a moment ago.
“I am sorry, Sir. I did delay but the young Master has started to cry,” Jarvis stated and Steve felt his heart leap into his throat.
He peered at Steve with large doe eyes and it took all within Steve’s power not to hug him. He looked so wretched and alone.
The imposter ran as soon as he saw them. Steve got to him first, wanting to question his look-a-like. They scuffled and when they separated, he could tell by the looks his team was giving them, that they could not tell the difference between the two of them.
Steve began to rise his hips to meet Tony’s thrusts, his hands were digging deeper into the mattress. Tony’s fingers clasped his ass harder, probably leaving bruises. His goatee scratched his inner thigh as Tony sucked and kissed him the flesh of his leg. When his tongue flicked out to taste Steve’s flesh, Steve knew he needed that tongue in his mouth now.
Tony lips did not pull away and were trying to smother him and consume him all at once. Both of them could barely breathe and had to gasp sharply whenever their mouths separated just enough to let some air come between them. Tony opened his mouth to him and his tongue plunged into Steve’s mouth to claim it as his own. Steve was beginning to slide down the couch and soon found himself laying on his back. Tony’s chest was pressed into his and his knees stapled his hips. He did not mind in the least. He liked the feel of Tony on him as he raged his assault on Steve’s mouth.
As soon as he saw the bullet ridden, barely sealed blast doors, he knew he found the place his father was talking about. One blast from his repulsors brought the doors down. They collapsed with a loud whine and landed with an explosion of dust.
For once in his life, Tony was struck totally speechless. When the silence expanded past the socially acceptable limit, Steve’s face crumpled and he looked away from Tony. His hand gently reached around Tony’s back and he lightly pushed him toward the shower. Tony willingly stumbled into the warm water and he leaned into the tiled wall, letting the water wash over his naked body.
From across the room, Susan Tyler stared blankly at him. She stood with the prosecution and the lawyer at her side was saying something to her but she seemed to be ignoring him in favor of watching Steve.
Steve smiled knowingly at his friend then looked to Tony and his boyfriend’s smile made him flush. They had been throwing out ideas when Steve mentioned dancing. Dancing was more of a social thing to do in the 1940s but the only “dancing” done in the 21
Tony did not respond or show himself. Steve sat himself up with a groan and looked back down at his broken leg. He bit into the flesh of his shoulder then pushed the bone back inside and nearly bit through his flesh from clenching his jaw as tightly as he did. A scream strangled his throat and blood from his shoulder filled his dry mouth, giving it much needed moisture. He swallowed the blood and let himself take in a steading breath then bit back down on his shoulder and straightened out the rest of his legs. He almost passed out from the pain but it had to be done, he could start to heal faster now that his bones were properly aligned.
“It does not matter you still can’t go. Kilian might be there and—,”Tony began to say as a suit landed behind him.
This chapter is a little shorter than usual because I couldn't help but leave ya'll with this one last cliffhanger! What can I say, I like to leave ya'll hanging! :D But, this is almost done! I will be wrapping up the story soon and everyone will live fluffly ever after, I promise! <3
Bucky turned to him expecting to see that he spilled food on his clothes but instead saw him clutching his chest with a pained expression.
He didn’t even have a chance to know he was going to die, nonetheless, realize that Tony had known he was going to die all along…
Eddie put down his bags and said, “Yes, most definitely, but dweebs nonetheless. No one comes to work on their days off.”
Tony came up to them and Steve dropped the subject. Tony held a cup of steaming coffee in one of his hands and the invention in the other. The coffee was already half gone.
After all his running, literally in Los Angeles and from the Hydra agents who were after him, he finally made it. Tony was right there.
“That sounds like a mission for the Commandos,” Tony stated quirking his eyebrow and smiling with a sly smirk.
He whispered, “I was never…” He took a deep breath and then pressed his forehead to hers and stated with conviction, as if to erase the first half of the sentence, “
Beneath his touch, the bitter tastes of Steve’s anxiety evolved into the sweet, sweet taste of desire. Steve was not flinching back, Steve was pushing forward, and, most importantly, Steve was kissing back.
“Oh, don’t you ‘sir’ me too!” Tony pushed his way through the bots and continued, “From now on, you’re only going to help me when I ask for it! Understood?”
The side of Tony’s mouth quirked up a little higher and he replied, “We no longer have any clues, but that’s good, we can write it ourselves…one thing is for certain, we’ll have each other.”
Tony was used to smothering his feelings and pretending nothing hurt. Growing up with an emotionally distant father and always being in the limelight did that to people.
?!” Steve screamed and pushed through the agents without a second thought. Many were flung aside but some were able to shoot him with their syringes. His body went numb and he stumbled the last few feet to Tony and collapsed beside him.
For a few seconds, Steve’s shock overrode all his emotions and he felt nothing. As he sat there, in the very room Peter had played in countless times, –
The Goblin turned the reactor in his claws and whispered menacingly, “But if you are dead then all my problems will go away. Your son will never become Spider Man. The Avengers will never form. Your company will flounder while mine will flourish. No…I don’t think I will return the reactor. I think I might just crush it.”
The next night Tony had a nightmare, Steve gently moved Peter to the other side of the bed then took Tony in his arms. He whispered, “You’re in New York, you’re in our bed, you’re in my arms…you’re in my heart. You’re okay, Tony,” Steve promised and Tony’s fingers dug into his flesh. “You are no longer in that dark place, you’re with me…the guy you jerked off to as a teenager, remember?” He felt Tony stop shaking then felt his mouth quirk into a smile against his flesh and he instantly relaxed.
Tony seemed to be hanging on to just his words. Steve gently cupped Tony’s cheek, caressing his cheek bone with his thumb. Those hazel eyes were cloudy with pain, despair, and love. Tony's gaze was locked with his, but Steve could already see those beautiful eyes weakening.
Steve turned and, without a care for the court, the judge, or anyone else who happened to be watching, grasped Tony’s face and pulled him into a deep kiss. The judge slammed his gavel and they broke apart.
Guilt instantly washed over him as he remembered the cause of Tony’s death. He felt guilty enough for wanting Bucky’s presence, it would kill him to think of kissing Bucky.
“Still, you are a graduate student living with superheroes. That must disrupt some of your study time.”
His nose suddenly tingled as it picked up another scent: cigar smoke. It was probably from one of Wade’s neighbors. Peter tucked his face deeper into the crook of Wade’s neck so he would only smell Wade.
“It’s mostly from shrapnel,” Tony answered the unasked question. “The rest are from a paltry surgery that was done in the middle of a cave with poor lighting and a patient who was awake for part of it…”
For the main ceremony, Ben took Peter home. Tony wished he could join him but he was Steve’s husband and he needed to be there with him until the very end.
“Hello, sirs,” Happy said with an overextended bow that made Tony sigh despairingly. From what Steve understood, he was trying to get Happy to tone down his master/servant vibe with no success. Happy informed them, “We already have company outside. The media knows Mr. Stark will be arriving with a special guest.”
Pepper bit down on her bottom lip and looked torn. Finally, she said, “…You look tired, Steve. Maybe you should get some sleep. The next couple of days are going to be crazy.”
Nonetheless, Peter found himself going into the hallway closet where Aunt May had stored their photo albums and the boxes of loose photos. He went to the bottom of the pile and pulled out the beige album.
The dust rose into the air and floated above the body as if deciding whether or not to return to it. The air was thin and stale with age, made more so by the lack of oxygen.
“…Coulson, is that all you really wanted of me?” The Captain asked with a weary expression. He had been sitting at the table ever since he got there but he looked tired and sad.
Tony threw back his head and laughed and Bucky smothered a chuckle. Steve flushed and explained, “It’s what guys from the forties called old fashioned people.”
Their hands scrambled as they both tried to touch each other everywhere but not let their mouths break apart. They rolled around until one of Tony’s hands shot out to the bedside table and blindly opened the drawer and reached in.
“You’ve been having a lot of those,” Steve murmured with concern. He scooted his chair closer and reached out to run his fingers along Tony’s jaw. “You’ve been getting sleep only a few hours at a time…We can talk to your doctor about getting you something –.”
Norman gritted his teeth. The Venom experiment had failed but he could still push forward with his plan. In fact, maybe he could use this monster to his advantage?
“Hand’ em over,” Uncle Bucky said, grasping Peter’s torso. He easily pulled Peter out of his pops’ grasp. Peter felt immensely baffled as he looked between his pops and Uncle Bucky with increasing misunderstanding.
The next night, went much like the prior night. As soon as Tony locked eyes with Steve, he launched himself at him and tried to kiss him. This time, however, Steve did not say a word. He gently dislodged his soulmate from his person and then put up a barrier between them again. He leaned against the wall and listened to Tony throw himself against it. Each impact was like a blow to Steve’s heart.
Bucky nodded toward Tony’s voice and urged, “Go to him. I’ll go down to the beach for a bit to give yous two your time.”
The top right corner had a child’s drawing of Captain America’s shield and on that same page was a sketch of the Hydra base.
He assumed Steve was not interested in being more than his friend and that he was participating in this fake relationship to help out his case…Could he be wrong about Steve?
Steve grinned mischievously and sat on the lip of the tub and leaned against the wall. Tony did not notice him and continued to rub down his body, leaving behind a trail of suds on his skin. Steve inspected Tony’s torso looking for any damage. Tony said he was fine but he would also say that if he was hurt. When he was sure he was uninjured, Steve leaned back and enjoyed the view. Tony’s newly cleaned skin gleamed under the bright lights of the bathroom and made his muscles stand out in higher contrast. He could not help but he aroused by his boyfriend’s naked body and started to grow hard.
Peter looked horrible, his skin was near-translucent and so thin his face looked more like a skull but it was him and…and he was alive. Breathing, shallowly but breathing all the same.
Peter didn’t know what to do with himself. He couldn’t look at social media or the internet without being bombarded by the news about being the Stark illegitimate son. He wasn’t ready to look at any of it just yet. Maybe in a couple of days…just not now…
Tony smirked but complied and Steve felt comfortable enough to carry on with his business. Once done, he flushed the toilet and bumped into Tony’s side as he went to the sink.
He didn’t know what was going on at first. He woke up as he was getting out of bed. He was still groggy with sleep so he didn’t understand
“Coming right up,” he promised. He stood and sat Peter on his good hip while turning off the tablet and handing it back to Bruce. To Bruce he said, “Thank you for checking over Peter.”
we cannot operate without energy and I doubt any of us are sleeping tonight so food it is! I was thinking ahead because you clearly were too busy sitting around on the couch to do it!”
Wade lightly pushed him forward and they walked together. Wade proudly pointed out the Ikea furniture he assembled, naming each one with its proper Swedish terminology. Apparently, Wade also had a roommate who helped him build these but she was out and, from the sound of it, Wade had sent her on vacation to Bermuda so he could show off the place in peace. Wade excitedly showed him everything from his small collection of ceramic ducks to the dusty garage.
He picked them all up and then held the four pieces in his hand, reading Tony’s name and the word “heart” and…and feeling his heart begin to crumble again. Tony did have a heart and, with it, he loved Steve and they were engaged and were finally going to go on a date and…
Steve glanced down at his husband and saw he wore the same glazed over look in Steve’s eyes. He must have seen the reports too.
, Sir,” Jarvis replied. “The man portrayed in the video claims to be an alien from another world called
The rest of the car ride was quiet with both of them looking out their respective windows and keeping their thoughts to themselves.
Steve threw his shield before Hulk could make another move and it implanted itself right next to Venom and Hulk. Everyone’s heads snapped in the direction the shield flew from and all of their eyes seemed to focus on him.
Tony stared at the mask clutched in his son’s hands and tried to keep from laughing. His illegitimate son looked just like him, was a genius in the making like him,
“…Steve,” Tony whispered. Several miles away, Iron Man stopped flying and turned to him. He was only a speck in the sky but Steve could feel Tony’s eyes on him. Steve stopped where he was and stared back. “Steve, I mean it I love you. I have for years…I just never asked if you felt the same because I thought you were straight…Do you...?”
It was the first time Steve was going to leave Tony alone for such a long period since they reunited...but he needed to be there for Bucky.
They were quiet as the company left and the silence continued for a few more moments after they were gone. They didn’t break eye contact the entire time, but Steve did reach out to him with his other hand to hold both of his. He rubbed his thumbs over the back of Tony’s fingers and Tony let himself relax into the intimate gesture.
Peter fell back onto this bed, trying to be as silent as possible as he pulled and struggled with the symbiote. He didn’t want to alert May to his presence because she may come upstairs to investigate and get herself skewered like Steve had.
The particular picture from the restaurant was attached to an article titled “Tony Stark is Dating – A Man!?”
Venom surged back down upon his son and Steve tried to draw Peter away from it. Yet Venom was still attached to his son so his attempts were in vain. He screamed, “GET AWAY! GET AWAY FROM HIM!”
Tony promised and the lie burned his throat. He was going to drink all night to catch up on the time he missed. His mouth was dry since he woke and he needed to quench his thirst.
“I-I’m fine,” Peter stuttered as his heartbeat returned to normal. “Just wasn’t expecting to see him…”
He set his internal clock. He would be gone no more than an hour, two at most. Peter would be fed and hopefully calm down without Steve and his grief to upset him more...
Tony nodded and then cautiously went back to fixing the socket. Bucky stared off into space, his expression was blank, but his eyes were dark with the depth of his hidden feelings.
“Peter, is that you, buddy?!” Tony asked, his anxiety was now burning through his bloodstream like battery acid.
Steve walked back to where the three men gathered and repeated, “I’m so sorry, Tony. He does not know his own strength. I can pay for the couch.”
His imaginings of a happy family was dashed and Bucky’s voice echoed, almost mockingly, from the past, “
Stark’s glare focused on his outstretched hand and then back to Wade’s deformed face. After what seemed like a long hiatus, he finally reached out and shook Wade’s hand and grumbled, “You’re welcome.”
Tony pushed up his welding goggles so he could see Steve more easily. He knew it looked bad. He was currently testing his anti-gravity boots to see how long he could stay on the ceiling with them but he grew bored so he took it as a perfect opportunity to do some work on the Hulkbuster suit from a different angle. Tony was welding upside-down which many would probably regard as insane but those foold just couldn’t comprehend his level on genius.
“Nanotechnology,” Peter supplied. “And that’s all I’m going to say…and don’t look at anything either.”
“I hope Iron Man flies in like last year!” One girls exclaimed, grabbing Steve’s attention. He saw a brief glimpse of Stark flying to his tower last week. Steve smiled at the memory. He’d love to see the suit in action again.
“Y-Yeah, yeah…” Peter stuttered in reply. Before he could second guess himself, Peter held out his hand and willed Venom to Eddie. The dark mass slowly slipped from Peter’s body and crossed the few feet between him and Eddie in one large tentacle. Eddie eagerly reached out and accepted Venom with an excited smile.
He was fighting a battle he saw no way of winning and it was against his best friend, a man he thought dead and what made it worse was the fact that Bucky had shot Tony.
Breathing more shallowly, Steve stepped into the nearest building, a corner grocer, and asked the man behind the counter, “Wha-What year is it?”
He stood and Tony stood with him, not letting go of his hand. He smiled at Steve and whispered, “I’m going to have to show you how to use 21
He dragged open the drawer and gently grasped the pill bottle. He held it tightly to his chest, afraid to take it.
“I don't need you guys right now,” Tony groaned to his bots. He still smiled at them as he waved them away, saying, “Shoo, shoo!”
Steve chuckled and said, “You know, my boyfriend might beat yours in the cute department, especially in the mornings. He has the rosiest cheeks.”
Without looking up at him, Steve whispered, “Forget everything I told you, Buck. It’s probably just a phase. I’m probably just desperate for somebody, anybody…Forget about it.”
But then he looked down at his precious baby boy and saw his eyes were open by tiny slits. He could barely make out the hazel of their coloring but he could tell Peter was looking at him.
The blue was the same blue from Pops’ Captain American uniform. From Pops, Peter learned the hard lesson of sacrifice: the cost it could have on oneself and your family. Pops knew sacrifice was a necessity and it was only with the strength of his heart was he able to carry the burden which it entails.
He needed to stop letting his heart dictate how he was going to react. He’d been doing so ever since he saw Tony covered in blood after the attack. He needed to be calm and collect to make sure Tony survived until they got him back to the future.
Steve dropped his head and murmured in an even lower voice, “I’m – I’m sorry about confessing to you like that…”
Tony's heart swelled and he cupped Steve’s jaw to press another kiss into his mouth. But that nervousness came back and Tony paused. He dropped his gaze and stayed uneasily, “We’ll have to come out if we want to be legally married.”
Because of his drowsiness, it took him a few minutes to remember the last time he was awake was when he was being pulled back into Venom’s dark embrace.
Steve settled back into the cot and wordlessly draped his arms over Tony. As Tony’s eyes closed, he heard Steve whisper, “You’re all I need too…” And then Steve pressed one more kiss on top of his head, making Tony clutch his shirt tightly enough to wrinkle it. He didn’t let go and fell asleep holding on tightly to his super soldier.
His stomach was starting to churn and he turned to the American’s leader. He gasped, “We need to find the Red Skull.”
Natasha shook her head and pushed a bunch of documents into Steve’s hands. She stated, “First things first. We need to bring you back to life legally.”
Wade nodded furiously to Peter and then they both separated as they tore off their individual shirts. Wade was then blessed with the incredible view of Peter's naked torso for the first time. The Spider-man costume was very form fitting so it had never left much room for the imagination but he'd never actually seen and Peter’s body was even better than he had imagined.
Marcel strode over to the juror box holding up the photo for all of them to see and asked, “And where was the sample on the dress?”
Tony laughed and said, “Nah! Nope! That ship sailed a long time ago! We're both big kids now, practically adults! I think we got it covered.”
He’d been in his office at Stark Industries and had his old notebook open on his desk. He was looking at the old formulas and morbidly remembering when he wrote them a decade and a half ago beside his son’s deathbed.
Peter watched Thor curiously and without recognition. He had yet to recognize him from his Avenger’s action figures.
“I-I know that. He told me the first time we met and even showed me a picture of you two kissing on his phone…”
Tony kicked off his jeans hastily, making Steve laugh. But then Steve’s weight settled onto Tony and he groaned in approval. Without his jeans on, he could feel so much more but it was also a reminder that he needed to get the rest of Steve’s clothes off now.
Steve sat up on Tony’s waist and Tony pushed himself up by his elbows. Tony picked up the metal box that had fallen from his grip and reopened it. Steve held out his left hand and Tony slid it onto his ring finger. Steve stared at it, breathless.
Steve watched the whole thing with interest. He couldn’t see the robots in question but Pete must’ve with his large, lensed eyes because he pulled his hand away from Tony’s neck and said, “Got’em all.”
Steve went in next, pausing at the top of the stairs to customarily wave to photographers. The photos were taken quickly and the photographers pleasantly called out their thanks. Steve paused just long enough to wish the paparazzi he dealt with in everyday life were so nice then followed the others into the plane.
“You are utterly insane,” Steve mumbled as he caught sight of the beard again. It was as well made one and probably was made by the same people who created movie props. Tony, of course, just happened to have it lying around. Tony grinned, his fake beard raised with his cheeks.
The corrections officer pulled him away from his legal team before they could say more. He was recuffed and he was led back to his holding cell.
Bucky went a few tables over to a group of soldiers he was friendly with and positioned himself within their sights.
“I was teasing,” Wade replied. He reached out and lightly grasped Peter's hand. He asked, “Come back to bed?”
“You did nothing wrong,” Peter promised him. “I ignored them too and, well, it’s gone. What we did or didn’t do doesn’t matter anymore.”
Howard had spent the night with his secretary, his current not-so-secret-affair-in-progress, so the two probably had the tent to themselves. Before, Bucky would have been a worried wreck about this. He would’ve wondered if they had sex, were too loud, if anyone heard…but now he simply worried for Tony surviving the night and Steve’s heart not breaking more with every passing moment for not being able to do anything for him.
“Don’t move, Tony,” Bruce hissed to his friend. “Tell me where you are injured. I’ve got to stop the bleeding.”
The first time Steve had uttered those words to him, Tony felt scared and had pushed Steve away. Now it made him undeniably happy and feel secure about his place in the world. Steve truly loved him. All of him. Tony and Iron Man. How could he be so lucky?
For the briefest second, Tony imagined Steve sitting next to him in his workshop as they shared a tranquil kiss. Being discovered would be the last thing on their minds. The vision faded and Tony ruefully agreed, “It would have…”
Tony stopped his pacing and fell back onto Steve’s queen sized mattress. He placed his hand over his arc reactor as if to stifle his frantic heart beneath.
Thor’s expression grew dark and murmured, “Much has happened in Asgard since I last came to Midgard.”
He just couldn’t shake this feeling that something was off. The few times Tony met his eyes, he could tell something was wrong by the way he looked at him.
Howard yipped and did a little victory dance. He then sat down and opened the notebook to one of the few remaining fresh pages and began writing out the cornerstone to the new element.
James peeked around the corner and then stepped out. He turned back to her and held out his hand, saying, “You gonna keep up?”
“We’re all good, Tony,” Steve retorted dryly. He turned back to Ben and said, “You can stay as long as you want and we will provide a car to drive you out through the underground entrance so the reporters won’t follow you…I’m going to take a quick shower and to change into some new clothes. You’re fine for another ten minutes?”
Steve kicked off his shoes and pulled his shirt over his head. He sighed, “It feels like years since we last were alone.”
He almost missed the sketch hidden behind the height of Potts’ briefcase. Coulson’s heart flipped as he recognized the pencil strokes and the combined forces of shock and jealousy warred inside him.
Eventually, he figured out the new suit could use the unused gold titanium alloy from an old satellite project and it’d not only fix the icing problem but would make the suit lighter and easier to maneuver. It was a win-win and Tony felt proud of himself as he leaned back any watched the pieces to his new suit come together on the screens.
“By all means, use that restless energy on me, Cap,” Tony flirted. Steve grinned and slid closer to him. Hook, line, and sinker. Tony Jr. was beginning to stir beneath the sheets. Steve bent down and lightly kissed Tony, his lips gently caressing Tony’s lips in the way that made Tony crazy.
But when Tony sighed heavily, they both loosened their grips and their moment ended. They let go of each other and Steve’s heart felt like it broke again as Tony’s hand drew away.
Wade lightly kissed those smiling lips and then traced his fingers along his face. There were dark circles under Peter’s eyes. Wade traced them and retraced them and then observed, “Did you not sleep well, baby boy?”
Steve placed him in the bed then paced around the apartment, trying to get rid of his excess energy. He could not sleep. He was too wired from his encounter with Tony.
Steve pulled his hand out of Tony’s before he got any more bad ideas. Tony’s hand twitched like he wanted to grasp his again and he looked hurt by the sudden break. Steve practically ran away before he would have to explain his actions.
The Tower was surrounded and they both wouldn’t be leaving in a long time without going out of their way. Luckily, all of Steve’s worldly possessions fit in two duffel bags so the move was quick. Unfortunately, Tony felt terrible for the guy when he saw Steve’s life
They went to the living room with the glorious view of the ocean. They sat together on one white couch and Bucky and Natasha sat on the other.
Tony almost eluded the subject, like he always did when the subject of his soulmate came up, but this time he lay his head against the back of the couch and began to talk. Pepper silently listened as he weaved his fairy tale about the perfect soulmate and his cursed existence.
“You were more than happy about me talking about our vows I just assumed –,” Tony began, leading Steve toward the front door.
Tony stewed over the questions as he trolled the internet. As he was looking for the photos, he was also making anonymous posts on websites about Steve’s case. He applauded the people who supported Steve and blasted the naysayers with negativity and an undeniable arguments in reply to their postings as to why they were wrong about Steve.
They were more dangerous thoughts about the Academy. Such notions had never come to mind before she met this man…or, maybe her eyes were not open
When Steve finished his account, Bucky fell back into the door and groaned, “Of course, the man you find for yourself comes with more baggage than Macy’s luggage department.”
Steve was originally going to make himself a sandwich but the sight of the Iron Man figure stole his hunger. He leaned against the counter and watched Peter.
He looked at his friend and saw the man did not acknowledge him. His gaze was dead and he looked at Steve without recognition or any of the warmth he remembered from their past together. Bucky clearly did not care if he was ordered to inject a deadly substance into Steve’s soulmate.
Wade groaned heavily and threw back his head. What the hell was he supposed to do?? He faced problems head on and made fun of their stupid faces! He didn’t dive deeper! He wasn’t serious!! He –! He hadn’t loved anyone like this before to truly care what was happening…
Tony sat down the workbench where he had the upgraded version of his helmet sitting, waiting for him connect it to the CPU. He put his hands on the helmet but glanced up at his husband who was standing before him, looking like he wanted to say something.
Tony stared at Barnes’ angry face and imagined Steve in his place, attacking Tony, trying to kill him, and unable to remember him. His heart broke simply imagining it. He couldn’t imagine what Natasha was going through.
“Hulk don’t want Puny Banner to come out,” Hulk muttered sulkily. Hulk stepped over to them, his anger evaporating with every step. His large green eyes fell on Steve and Peter and his gaze totally softened.
Venom might be faltering because he was dying without a host. His host was used up…Peter could be dead.
Tony carded his fingers into Steve’s hair and let the man dip him slightly. A few seconds later, they broke apart, both wearing smiles, but stayed connected via their clasped hands. They turned to their audience together and Steve announced, “Tonight, Tony and I would like to come out as a couple.”
“NAT! Please, not over the communicators!” Steve gasped, interrupting her. What was she doing?? He began to walk quickly, wanting to have a word in with the redhead in private. He quickly cleared the top of the hill and spotted the meeting point where the rest of the Avengers with the exception of Tony and Bruce were waiting.
He then pointed his gun down and, in quick order, shot both his knees. Steve fell with a muffled yell of agony. He instinctly fell onto his knees and the pain intensified by tenfold. He fell to his side as a nauseating wave of pain threatened to knock him out.
Peter asked, “I also wanted to know how you want to move forward. Venom has been destroyed but, with it, so has our experiment. We’re going to have to start from square one…but this time I think we should avoid using alien life forms as our base solution.”
Coulson squeezed his shoulder and silently left his side. He disappeared behind some double doors and Tony somehow inherently knew he was going to watch over Steve as they worked on him.
The Goblin was going to finally make his move. They had to return the reactor after the Goblin took it but before Tony would need it. It was going to be a very slim window for them to work in. With Jarvis monitoring the entire house, they, the Goblin, and even Obadiah Stane had to wait to strike when Stane’s reset brought down the entire system for a mere twenty minutes.
Tony whispered, “No, that’s a lie…I’m far from fine. How can I be fine when my husband is trapped within a symbiote and on SHIELD’s top kill list? And Peter…I thought I was screwed up after nearly dying in the void after Loki’s attack but this…God…
“It’s not spandex,” Peter sighed, dropping his head in his hand. He didn’t even attempt to deny the truth. Everyone on the Avengers already knew. What was one more superhero?
“What do you remember?” Steve asked in a whisper. He was afraid to raise his voice any higher, in case of enticing Bucky again.
“You are not joining the Avengers until you are done with high school,” Tony deadpanned before their son could finish. By the tone of his voice, Steve bet Peter had already brought up this topic.
Tony turned to Steve with a smirk and saw his husband was already looking at him with a twitching smile.
Steve crushed his eyes closed to stop the uncontrollable tears that instantly welled up. He thought he was getting a hold of it but it was the little things that always seemed to break him. He stopped the tears but he could not hid his shudders from Tony. His husband reaffirmed his grip on Steve. It was his way of letting Steve know he was there for him. Only when he trusted himself to speak, did Steve gasp, “He loved you, Tony. You got to hear him call you ‘Dad’ at least…”
Peter couldn’t stop his lip from wobbling as his elation pushed a surge of relief and joy through him.
He began to work 9 to 5 like an everyday American. Maria was much happier with the arrangement, but Tony was shy. He’d grown up without Howard being there and he was clearly unsure how to act around his father.
“Sir, is used to long periods of no nutrition and has been repeatedly reminded of the importance of sustenance,” Jarvis stated.
Marcel looked at the photo with a perplexed expression and murmured, “That’s an odd place for such a stain…”
Norman sighed overdramatically and put down his pen as if it were a heavy burden. He leaned into his chair’s arm and regarded them sympathetically. He stated, “Dr. Parker did not want others to know…Well, to be more specific, she did not want SHIELD to know she was alive and being that they are a spy organization that meant that no one else could know she was alive.”
He kept his eyes buried in his grasp and remained turned away so he could not see Tony’s reaction, but he did hear the tremendous pain in his voice as he replied.
They did not stop until the sun was beginning to set. The men jumped into action preparing their tents for the night and searching the area for enemy troops. Tony stood aside, not knowing what to do. He was supposed to be playing the part of an army man but he had no idea where his tent was nonetheless how to pitch it. With Steve still weighing heavily on his mind, Tony decided to search for him to have something to do and to not stand out.
“Remind me never again to fly with Clint,” Tony grumbled into his ear. Steve scoffed but adjusted his hold to look the engineer over. Tony’s suit was mostly whole but was severely dented and several punctures dotted where the armor’s weaker joints and suit connections met. Steve reached behind Tony’s neck where the fingerprint scan was to open Tony’s suit for him. Usually the suit would open fluidly without a sound but, as soon as it registered Steve’s fingerprint, it groaned and hissed as it came apart.
Once the serious business was done, Ben and Mary began to talk about his and May’s lives since Mary last saw them. Most of it revolved around Peter.
“Yes…Yes, of course,” Stark replied, agreeing with him too readily. He quickly crossed the room and picked up the sketch. Coulson frowned at the action. He wanted to look at it longer. He’d never seen a sketch of Howard alone before. Stark rolled up the image and asked, “Is there something you need me to consult on? Or do you have those notes for me?”
She kneed him in the gut and he shoved his elbow into her throat. She choked from the blow and he exhaled harshly from the hit. They broke apart again and began to circle each other again. The entire fight so far only spanned the course of a dozen or so seconds.
But, with Steve’s glare, his friend’s melancholy disappeared. Tony grinned to himself from his success.
“…They’re all worried about you but I sent them away. I didn’t want you to feel too smothered,” Steve explained. “They’ll come running if you ask though.”
A stranger walked in his front door and walked past Tony and downstairs to his workshop. The man smirked at him with distain and a high and mighty air that filled Tony with unease.
Venom hummed then relaxed its grip on Hulk. It dropped its head and, as its head touched down on the ground, the black mass dripped away and Peter’s wide eyes met his.
“That is 100% yes!” Steve gasped, kissing Tony like a man dying of thirst and he was the well of water providing his much needed sustenance. He paused to kiss him deeply, drawing a moan from Tony. When he pulled back, he whispered into his lips, “I love you.”
Tony circled the suit, it still had the additional weapons upgrades from the alternative future but the moniker was gone. Tony opened several panels finding the hardware where it was supposed to be…but, upon closer inspection to the chips, he didn’t see any of the company names that were usually etched into the covers.
The couple shared one of those looks now. They lost the masks of the unfeeling assassins and unbridled warmth flowed between their eyes. Steve smiled sweetly at his friends. Bucky had come to the tower with only Steve as his anchor to his sanity but now he had Natasha for an anchor. No, she was stronger than an anchor that could be moved at the tug of a chain. She was more permanent like a firmly built beam at the center of a bridge, standing immobile and tall while being supported by cables, girders, arches, concrete, steel, and such. Nothing would move her from his side.
As many of you probably noticed, I purposely let Norman escape and get away with what he had done. In my mind, he and Peter will be archenemies. They will share many fights and eventually Peter will discover his identity.
“Stawberry?” Peter asked, picking his head off Steve’s chest. Steve wiped the tears from his eyes and smiled sweetly at him. The sadness in his son’s eyes was instantly dashed by the excitement of the nearby dessert.
Peter wrapped his arms behind Wade’s neck and started to kiss him again as he dragged Wade across the hall toward his bedroom. A few frames were knocked off the wall in the process but Wade didn’t really mind because he was going to his bedroom with a highly-aroused Peter and only good things can come of this.
becoming a reality. To add to Tony's delight, Natasha had surprised Steve with time off for an entire week. It was turning into one of the most exciting weeks of his life.
“And when exactly did you two find the time to fall in love and become engaged in the five minutes…” Fury paused and then his glare burned hotter as he hissed,
With his breath constricting at the painful, unattainable truth of his words, he gasped, “I wanted to grow old with you…”
“Jesus Mother Fucking Christ,” Fury cursed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He rounded on Wade and hissed, “You had to snatch them up just as they’re getting started??”
Steve grinned and said, “When you meet him, please convince him of that. His current color scheme is red and blue.”
“No, he can’t be,” Peter desperately gasped as the image of the burned corpse seared itself into his mind.
some specs on what had happened and, since they don’t want little super soldiers running around, they obviously keep it locked up tight! Don’t worry, I’ve done this before! How do you think I found you?”
“I love you so mu—,” Tony started to say but Steve muffled his words with another deep kiss and pushed his fiancé back to the floor to better devour him.
Pepper rolled her eyes and moved on, “Reporters want to know if Steve's going to adopt Peter. Have any of you discussed it?”
He cut the connection before Coulson could reply and jumped on the access pad. As he walked across it, the suit was assembled around him and he was in the air in less than a minute. His heart was racing as he imagined finally meeting the man who had once been his childhood hero.
Steve went to walk away, wanting to be alone, but Bruce launched himself across the room and gasped, “No! Wait!”
“Tonight will be our last night to escape into the forest,” Steve observed in a whisper. They reached the coal container and Tony grabbed the scoop and Steve held out his basket to let him pour the coals in.
“Now who should we set up next?” Tony’s head moved beneath him as he looked around the room. Steve humored him and he picked his head off Tony’s and Tony lifted his head and his eyes spanned the room. His gaze landed on Clint and the corners of his lips curled up into a devious grin.
Soft morning light was already illuminating his room but he usually slept in much later. He glanced at his clock seeing it was early in the morning with the sun just peeking over the horizon.
The last few days he’d wake up and wonder if it was really happening. Sometimes he’d even convince himself that it was all a delusion.
Pepper whispered, “Forget my lists then. If this becomes real, if there are no more lies, then I believe you and Steve can get out of this with your heads held high.”
Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s flesh drawing a pleased murmur from Steve. Steve whispered into his lips, “I love you too.”
Fury looked over to his shoulder to his senior agent. Coulson stood by the Captain and had been silently directing the others to remove the tranquilizers and then was going to move him out. Coulson had been listening in and met Fury’s gaze. He nodded once but it was all the Director needed.
“I have to find out about your life one way or another,” MJ retorted, leading them to an empty couch on the far side of the room.
“I CAN’T STAND IT!” Mary roared, slamming her fists into the counter. Bruce backed away from her sudden outburst and stared at her with wide eyes. Tony just felt justifiably smug until she continued, “
Natasha had trained with James and she had killed with him. But, she had never been in the field with him, fighting hand-to-hand and special ops. They had only killed together from afar as he was training her in sniping and other long range kills.
Tony ran back to his side and yelled, “We have a transport van with the same alarm playing waiting outside! Can you stand?”
Wade bust down his door, brandishing one of the living room’s floor lamps like a kantana. His eyes immediately focused on Peter and he stumbled back like Peter’s very presence had pushed him. He caught himself on the doorframe and gasped his name like it was his last breath, “
Needless to say, when the shift was done, Peter stuck close to Eddie’s side and avoided everyone else.
Wade instantly tore off the mask and looked at Peter with his own eyes. Peter leaned into the car and then sat on the seat next to Wade. Happy was gone, probably shooed away by Peter to give them some privacy but Wade hadn’t even noticed because he was all eyes for Peter.
Steve’s stomach clenched with hunger like it seemed to always be doing since he woke but he cajoled, “You don’t have to…”
He doubted the way he was treated was the norm. Everyone was respectful toward him and, when he passed the other prisoners, they all grew quiet and watched him with large eyes.
The reactor was working but the next morning Tony couldn’t get out his of sleeping bag because he was feeling too dizzy.
Knowing Tony was teasing him, Steve did not back down and boldly flirted back, “I liked what I saw.”
His body moved forward as he tried to blink back his blurring vision. Only when he realized he was moving again did his heart rate begin to race.
Steve slowly pushed Tony’s bottom back onto the counter and helped him sit up. He cleared his throat and said, “Sorry…Tony and I…Well…”
His super soldier was shaking and Tony was pretty sure he could feel tears dampening his skin where Steve buried his face in the crook of his neck.
“Tell me where the flash drive is and I will get it,” Tony said. “I will look like just another patient. You are decked out in Captain America regalia. You’ll be recognized immediately.”
Tony walked up to it and lifted his face shield so he could look at it with his own eyes. He glared at it and tried to transfer all his livid emotions into the stare.
The other woman nodded and went back to the door. Mary watched her like a hawk then tensed as the door was opened.
Steve knew the exact moment Ben had met Mary. Not because he was a good guesser or he had calculated and measured his steps…but because his husband was one of the smartest people on the planet and hacking into all the cameras in the city just the watch Ben’s progression was an easy thing for him to do.
Tony scrambled off Steve and gasped, “We have to go after him! Why did he leave?? I told him to put Spidey on hold!”
Wade’s worry about the media’s reaction to their relationship stayed with him ever since Wade brought it up. Peter had never considered it until Wade voiced it into existence.
Steve’s heart caught in his throat and he turned back to Peter and tore at the substance with a renew vigor.
“I…I won’t sleep with him,” Steve stated. “We’ll just stay friends. Don’t worry, Buck. Tony probably doesn’t swing that way anyway…”
His eyes trailed to Tony’s abdominal muscles, where his fingers had trailed so often…and now will nevermore.
“We’ll bring him. He might be the only thing that will stop them. Natasha loves him and Bucky-,” he let the statement hang in the air but he and the others knew Bucky loved Steve.
“Steve…” Bruce gasped, his voice and his resolve breaking. He could not argue against Steve’s rational. How could Bruce agree to let Venom stay in Peter when Steve was willing to do it?
He changed the direction of his flight in a millisecond and put all of his repulsors on full thrust, going faster than he ever had before. He’d been flying over the greater Los Angeles area, looking for any signs of Steve to no avail until that moment.
“Tony!” He exclaimed, skidding on his knees to a stop beside him. Tony jerked and lifted his head with a confused expression and glassy eyes. He looked on the verge of crying and it crushed Steve to see Tony in such a state.
says you two are already married and Tony is pregnant with Steve’s super baby,” Bruce stated with a small smile. Tony laughed falling into Steve’s side.
She wanted nothing more than to die right there. Everything was hopeless. The Academy was probably going to torture them to death. She was never going to see James after today.
He was far from fine but he did not want to worry his aunt any more than she already was. She nodded and then murmured, “I’m going to try to get the reporters off the front lawn and then I’m going to make breakfast, okay?”
The last time Tony had been there was for maybe ten minutes after his press conference upon his return to the States and his escape from the Ten Rings…He hadn’t even gone to his office after revealing he was Iron Man to the press.
His rage burned deep as he confirmed it for himself. Videos of the Captain and his soulmate flooded the airways. The man hadn’t changed any since the day he last saw him and he looked so
Steve glanced out the window. The bus was driving on a highway going a nice cruising speed. The cars that passed them contained the usual commuters.
Jarvis turned on the water to Tony’s preferred temperature without his asking so, when Steve entered, Tony was already soaking wet.
“BUT I’ve done nothing to prepare for an epic anniversary!?” Tony gasped, acute horror lacing his voice as he worried about his new aspect to their relationship.
“Don’t be saying that until you’ve experienced a bon-a-fied Tony Stark birthday bash, kiddo.” Tony opened another hologram and stated, “Pep and I decided your birthday would be best done here at the Tower so we have control of who comes in but we need the final say-so for who those people will be. This is the list.” He pushed the holo screen to Peter and the glowing image floated over to him. Peter stopped it with a single hand and turned the list around to view it correctly. The Avengers and his parents were there of course, as was Aunt May, the interns he worked with, MJ, and the people he used to hang out with on the weekends from school, and…Wade.
When the crew called cut, the lights dimmed and the smile dropped from Tony’s face. With a cool glare, Tony murmured under his breath, “You and your studio will never get an interview with Peter, anyone operating under Stark Industries, or the Avengers ever again.”
Clint moved into action without a second thought. Bucky stared at Natasha the entire time Clint searched his person. Bucky’s face was as blank and unreadable as Natasha’s. Steve held his hand, unable to do more for him. He was glad Bucky was remembering more but he feared what he would remember with Natasha. It could not be good, especially if he was training her to kill.
Heimdall was the all-seeing and all-hearing guardian of Asgard. He stood where he had been stationed for hundreds of years, at the end of the Bifrost. The rainbow bridge had been repaired but was fragile. His duty to protect it and his home weighed heavily on his shoulders.
“…Should I be expecting Iron Man or Captain America knocking down my door soon? Because then I need to get my autograph booklet out!”
Venom no longer attempted to keep up its disguise and its black mass appeared as it tried to push away. Steve grunted but held onto Peter. Steve gritted through clenched, red teeth and hissed, “
A pulse of jealousy ran through Peter. Steve was getting more of Tony than Peter would ever have and he was slightly jealous by the fact that they would finally be able to be themselves out in the public…but that feeling came and then left.
Tony smiled ruefully at him as he remembered both Steve and Bucky’s impending deaths. He doubted the super soldier wouldn’t be influenced by those events. He asked, “What do you want to know?”
Internally, Natasha felt sick. Her soulmate had been erased. It was the worst thing that could happen to an agent of the Academy. His mannerisms made so much sense now. The Academy had taken away his mind, his will, his memories…everything.
Now his embarrassment doubled because he was doing this in front of the others. He mumbled, “Love you too, Dad.”
“Natasha,” Steve whispered. She turned to Steve, her eyes glassy and her jaw clenched in rage. “This is what he wants. Don’t give into him. Let’s lock him somewhere where no one can hear him and live out the rest of our lives.”
“She says her soulmate lives on the other side of the country and is annoying,” Tony stated. “She's kinda annoyed that my soulmate is so cool.”
Captain Rogers wouldn’t give up but he may be unconscious because of the super soldier serum. Rogers was able to heal himself, but what was the price? Did the serum require payment for working a miracle? Was that payment time?
Tony inhaled Steve’s musk deeply, still getting used to the new scent but treasuring it all the same.
“…No,” Tony replied, his voice wary. “I…Ah…At this point, I think we have to assume no one got our picture…”
Tony relaxed significantly and murmured, “Okay, good. Yeah, give me the good stuff, Jones.” He held his arm out to Gabe who proceeded to inject the drug into the appendage.
Peter buried his face into Wade’s chest. Even with his mask still half on he felt the need to hide himself from his mortification. They were officially entering their awkward stage of a new relationship where they had to figure out how they fit together and he hoped they could get through this quickly. He whispered, “I like you, Wade. I really like you and, whenever I’m with you, I feel happy and at ease. I haven’t felt that in a long time but, the fact of the matter is, I’ve never been with a man before so I need time to adjust to that fact.”
Loki stepped into the room from the balcony, his sly green eyes took in the gathered company and he smiled. “It is nice to see all of you again.”
SHIELD had a headquarters in Denver and they’d taken the priest there for questioning. After a few threats about calling Fury and noting how grumpy he was due to the lack of sleep he was getting, the agents relented to let Tony speak to the man.
The Soldier kicked Tony off Steve and Tony fell back with a choked gasp. The Soldier spared him a glance before holding his gun to Steve’s forehead.
stay in our era and he even said there’d be a time limit on whatever yous would have going on, but…but he isn’t like the others too…”
“Goddamnit,” Steve cursed under his breath as Tony finished his rant. Forget rash, this was downright stupid.
It only took him 19 years to reach out to Peter. He’d probably propose to Steve in half the time. So 9.5 years. Reasonable. Though not a round, even number. So he better make that ten years.
Suddenly, feeling a little weak in the knees, Steve sat down on the nearest bench, and gasped to his friend, "...That...it'll be dangerous, Buck."
Steve reached out and grasped Bucky’s arm. He whispered, “And you feel horrible about it. You aren’t the monster you think you are, Buck. A monster wouldn’t care about those lives he took, you do.”
Natasha shook her head and put her hand over his wrist, stopping him from pulling away. She said, “Stay and enjoy your party. I’ll check in on Brock and see if he’s ready to come back to the party.”
The Goblin had leapt up to the remains of a second level, where Clint had hidden himself, and was trying to catch the acrobatic archer. The Goblin mostly charged and Clint easily evaded him but the monster was watching Clint with a critical eye, studying his moves.
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony’s comment but hoped he was right. He did not let it bother him and ventured back into the thick of the party looking for his son.
“All this time – you said nothing – Tony could’ve been walking down the street and I could have –,” Steve aggressively replied.
After SHIELD and Pepper had left, they even made love for the first time in the bedroom, and then the kitchen, and then the living room…
Hydra had contacted him, needing labs and scientists to conduct their experiments. Norman had worked with them before so saw no problem with their experiments involving the remains of Captain America. In fact, Norman was fascinated by it. Every single biological engineer and scientist in the modern world wondered at the mystery of the Super Soldier serum and many had tried and failed to replicate it.
He did not need to come out to Natasha but he did inform her that he was telling everyone else. Natasha smirked smugly and told him she was proud of him.
positive about was that he cared for Steve and that was what he was going to focus on when he finally found him.
Whenever Tony walked into the same room as him, Steve instantly felt a comfortable warmth in his chest but with Bucky it was a fluctuating temperature that always varied. Tony made Steve feel content whereas Bucky made him feel…apprehensive. And just like the innate feelings he had with them he had different kinds of love toward them as well. He could not believe he did not see it before now.
Peter appeared thirty seconds later with a flustered smile and quickly dashed into the lab. As he came over to them, he said, “I’m late for my meeting with Eddie so I just wanted to quickly stop in and say hi!” He embraced Tony first and then did the same to Steve. He said, “I’ll see you guys later! Wanna do lunch?”
The question shocked him. Steve had hopefully imagined being with a man as a teenager, he’d shamefully dreamed of it as a young adult, and he had only just recently believed he could truly be happy with a man thanks to Tony.
“All I ask is that you two punks wait to go time traveling again for another thirty years at least,” Bucky grumbled.
Thor swung his hammer with a roar and slammed it down, knocking most in the room off their feet. Tony fired a few nano-rockets at some of the closer agents but he went straight to the imposing figure at the head of the group: Schmidt.
“Yup,” Tony replied, popping the “P” with a loud smack of his lips. He asked, “I know it’s frowned upon in this era but is it really that bad if there’s even an inkling of Captain America being gay?”
“Oh, yeah!” Tony laughed. He turned to Bucky and poked him in the chest and stated, “So no ammunition belt!”
He stepped out of the servers’ corridor and back into the main room. He saw the server walking toward Tony and he watched with dread when she reached Tony’s side. She whispered something in his ear and turned to her with a smile. Whatever his reply was made the server laugh. She slipped from his side and he watched her walk away with a sultry smirk.
, Peter,” Wade stated. “We may have only just started dating but I’ve fought beside and known you for years and not once had I ever seen you turn your back on a friend when the going got tough.”
Tony carried his Iron Man suitcase by the tips of his fingers of his broken arm. He wore a hospital gown and his face was still battered enough to be unrecognizable. Tony was pale and his face gaunt beneath the damage. He must have been using all his strength to remain standing. Tony’s eyes hardened as they fell upon the symbiotic tendrils pulling at Steve’s skin.
“…In my future, that Bucky died on that train just like yours did today,” Tony whispered. Steve’s breath hitched as he imagined the timeline. Was Bucky fated to die no matter what? The thought crushed Steve further. Tony struggled as he tried to continue, “…It – It…” Tony paused again and then quietly stated more slowly, “The same day I decided to save his life was the day that the future changed and, it may have been because of our relationship but…but I think it was mostly because of my resolute decision on
Natasha’s gaze spanned the room, taking in every single one of them. Bucky sat stiffly on the couch and Tony was suddenly very interested in his coffee. Steve glanced nervously at both men before turning to the assassin and saying, “Good morning, Natasha.”
Tony frowned as he touched the spot his friend had fallen asleep. He was going to have to ween Steve out of his habit.
“We’ll find you a girlfriend,” Tony replied. “We got to change the story about you. You masturbating into a sock is not a good image but you, using a condom, being in a consensual relationship with someone you love is! Also you haven’t publicly dated anyone since you were defrosted and now that it’s out that you are dating is huge. Everyone is going to want to know about the lucky lady who finally captured your heart!”
With his overly exhausted body, sleep was quick to claim him. He fell asleep dreaming of chocolate cake and Gwen repeatedly breaking her neck on the hard cement floor.
The whole reason Tony had started drinking was because he had come to this conclusion and did not know how to tell Steve.
With a paling face, he fumbled with his left gauntlet. His hands were shaky and tears were forming in his eyes. Bruce paled as he also realized what had happened.
“Yeah – Yeah, of course!” Gabe said, waving them toward the back of the tent. He pointed out a cot and Steve laid Tony out on it. Tony finally opened his eyes and turned to Gabe, saying, “Hey, man, good to see you again.”
They had a private ceremony with only close friends and family before the main one for the rest of the world. There was maybe three dozen people there and everyone spoke at the podium about Steve.
Tony copied Steve and stripped down to his bare skin. He looked filthy but Steve felt just as grimy.  They probably should have taken a shower first but Steve did not even have the energy to sit up now that he was laying down. Tony was with him under the covers before the last of his clothes hit the floor and cuddled close to Steve.
Steve held off his morning run in favor of watching the monitors with Cable and hypothesizing with him as to why Steve was disappearing now in the photo.
Fury looked surprised by Tony’s statement though a little suspicious still. Steve could tell by his tone that he was sincere and, Fury must have too, because he nodded curtly and then asked, “All I need to know right now…is there a time machine on the property right now.”
He didn’t want to hurt Bucky but his old friend was trying his hardest to kill them. Additionally, Tony was stubbornly ignoring his wounds and bleeding out.
“I’m glad Peter wasn’t upset by the interview,” Tony murmured gently into Steve’s chest. “I was worried he would be upset by all of the attention it would create.”
Wade turned around to see Peter’s father fall to his knee. He was clearly struggling to breathe by the way he was gasping. Wade lurched to get up and help him but Vision was by Tony’s side in seconds. He helped support him and stated, “The Captain says you are to be escorted to the closest hospital, no exceptions.”
His dad had given him a new one for Christmas and it was sitting in his bedroom at Aunt May’s. Peter had originally taken his old camera to the Tower with the idea of repairing the cam system within his lens. But, his dad didn’t have the proper supplies, and Peter never got around to fixing it since he had the new one.
They walked up to it and Tony observed, “You do realize…this will be the first ever picture we take together?”
Wade held her hands and haltingly explained what happened to Peter. Her grip was surprisingly strong and was the only sign to him that she was just as scared for Peter as him as it tightened exponentially through his account. Her expression was immobile and stout, and Wade felt comforted by it. If she could be strong, even when her world was on the verge of being destroyed, then so could Wade.
Steve spread Tony’s legs lewdly and his fiancé shuddered. Tony's hold on the bottle loosened, making it slip a little lower in his grip.
“General Ross?!” Tony hissed as he recognized the man. He knelt next to Steve and grabbed him as if to lift him up. Steve maneuvered Peter between them and out of the General’s sight. Ross moved his gun with Peter and Tony gasped, “What are you doing??”
His excitement was almost palpable. He had built and studied the model of the plane when he was a child and knew all of its workings by heart. The old model still sat on his bookshelf at the office.
Steve gently placed his son on the ground by his play workstation then went over to Tony. He did not notice Steve until he stuck the coffee under his nose.
“Tony?” Steve sleepily murmured in response to his worried touch. He held the hand Tony had grasped him with and asked, “What’s wrong?”
As they waited for the judge, Steve scooted his chair back and reached across the bar. Tony met him halfway and grasped his hand. The others leaned forward and murmured encouragements to Steve but he found the most comfort from Tony’s simple hold and warm gaze.
“Well that ‘squirt’ is in a relationship with Wade and they are very happy together and we are not going to interrogate either of them today…right?” Steve paused in slicing the slab of turkey he’d bought at the deli and looked between Natasha and Bucky, making himself clear in who exactly he was talking to.
“Surveillance mostly,” Cable stated and turned on a few monitors above his head. “We need to find the Goblin and then see what changes he’s going to make and then fix them. I’ve got a few people I can contact to help keep us informed. In the meantime, however, I’m going to start repairing the reactor.”
Steve passed them and Thor before finally settling into the empty spot next to Tony. His soulmate smirked at him but his eyes were full of warmth and love. Before the War, Steve hadn’t thought this was possible either. He never thought he’d be with a man or…be this happy.
Tony typed in a few lines of code and hit enter. The files began to download on to his server. They watched the files load and the different sections were listed off with the simple titles SHIELD have given each files. They varied from “Rogers, Steven: Pre-Serum Medical” to “Vita Ray Levels.”
Natasha sighed heavily and put down her spoon. She stated, “Look. I am not going to keep calling you ‘teacher.’ It’s weird and…” She sighed lightly and continued, “You are my soulmate and, if we are going to live together with that knowledge, then we need to at least try to be friendly. So my name is Natasha, what is yours?”
“You know exactly why,” Steve retorted and picked up his pace when he saw the enigmatic inventor’s tent.
Natasha did not react to his imploring lips and sealed her lips into a thin line. When he tried suck on her upper lip did she make her move and bit down hard on Bucky’s bottom lip. His blood flooded down his tongue and he felt her cooler blood mix into his mouth.
But he was Tony Stark. He wasn’t going to let a little thing like death keep him down. He might be dying but he could delay it at least. Maybe give himself enough time to right the future so Steve won’t be cursed to become the Winter Solider and…maybe even give himself enough time to reach the future and say goodbye before the palladium finally did him in...
“Yes,” Steve gasped, his voice hasher with the danger of joyous tears threating to spill. He remembered! Bucky remembered his name!
She claimed to have been cleaning Steve’s room when he forcibly pushed her onto the bed and raped her. She recounted every imaginary touch and word he said in great detail. He apparently said he had wanted her from the moment he saw her, that he loved the way she felt, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.
Tony stepped closer to Steve and looked down at him with a wily grin. Steve smiled back and was so filled with emotion that he murmured, “I love you.”
.” Tony waved his hands between them. Bucky would, no doubt, want to talk about him being from the future and Tony would have to make sure both men do not talk about Tony being from the future to the others BUT, first… Tony needed to know all the juicy details about Steve’s mano-y-mano activities!
Was Steve seeing Tony or was he already imagining somebody else? The thought pinched at his chest but he brushed it away.
Steve leaned his chest into Tony’s shoulder and placed a hand over Tony’s arc reactor. Steve replied in an equally mocking voice, “Bi? Single? I would have never guessed! Hey, did you know I am gay and I think you’re kind of hot? Maybe we should date? How about tonight? Dinner, on top of the Tower?”
“Don’t you dare talk like that,” Steve whispered fiercely. He madly looked around, hoping for a paramedic but the hall had cleared upon Tyler’s attack.
“But now it’s dark again,” Steve hissed into the comforter. Tony was dead. Bucky was no longer Bucky. Steve wondered if Peter would be enough to bring back the light again but he instantly threw away the thought. Before Steve found Peter, he thought himself cursed. People died around him and nothing went in his favor. His joy with Peter and Tony clouded him from it and he thought it was over, but he was wrong. He was still cursed. Peter could not be that light because then Steve would clearly be marking him for death.
Tony walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. He whispered, “I’ll still love you when you turn 100 in a couple of years.”
“This is it, isn’t it?” Tony gasped, his voice growing higher. He sat down next to Steve and nervously collected both of Steve’s hands into his.
The worst part was not being able to breathe. The heat alone was chokingly hot but the smoke cloaked his throat and filled his lungs with ash. He was drowning again but this time it was in this smoky, oppressive heat. He thought drowning in the icy Atlantic had been bad but he was so wrong. At least the cold numbed the pain. The heat only got worse, there was no solace to his suffering. He fought valiantly at his bounds to escape it but only succeeded in swinging.
Steve didn’t see what happened to the Goblin because his entire future was on the ground in a crumpled heap.
He didn’t move for a few minutes. His emotions were all over the place and he wasn’t ready to leave just yet. This was the closest he would ever be to Steve again and maybe his spirit was there like Bucky believed and Tony didn’t want to go if he was still there. Even if Tony couldn’t see him, he wanted to be there with him.
“That was Jarvis,” Tony stated with a grin. He’d never seen someone respond to Jarvis with such an extreme reaction and he had to muffle his laughter. He explained, “He’s my AI. He’s like…a really smart robot in my ceiling.”
The sorrow left Tony’s eyes as determination settled in. He sat up and, with a wave of his hand, the city opened up around them. He then hit a button and Steve’s bed began to rise, moving him into a sitting position. They were in the Hudson again but the ferryboat was long gone. Steve’s eyes panned over the city and he saw the dotted indicators for the Avengers’ locations. Tony stated, “The entire team is mobilized and searching as are the X-Men, SHIELD, and all of our friends and allies…but he’s disappeared.” Tony’s voice grew more morose as he stated, “We’ve turned up no clues as to where he’s gone…he might not even be in the city anymore or worse…he might – he might be…”
DUM-E took their moment as one to crash and came zooming over. It grabbed Steve’s outstretched hand and vigorously shook it.
Tony fell silent, staring blankly at his new suit, but his mind was in the past with his father and his obsession with the location of Cap’s final resting place.
“The coffee here sucks, I have been threatened with arrest three and a half times, and the internet connection is so bad it’s like living in the Dark Ages! But who cares about me! Are you alright?? No one would tell me
His shield was right where he left it, leaning against the wall beside his bed. He picked it up and unconsciously slipped it onto his arm as he jogged back.
Steve tensed, his mind racing with questions, and she seemed to have sensed them as she silenced them all by saying, “His mind was fragile. He could barely remember his past and he did not know how he had attained his power. SHIELD doesn’t want anyone to know someone else had managed to make a super soldier.”
“Oh…” Peter paled and he uncomfortably scratched the top of his head. He cleared his throat and said, “I thought Tony would have told you…I’m Spider-Man.”
me, my parents, and tried as hard as hell to kill Wade despite his abilities…” Peter hissed, gripping the bars around him tightly.
Tony smiled and tears began to fall from his eyes again as he honestly gasped, “You being alive is the farthest thing from being a disappointment.”
He went to put his arms in the straps but almost dropped the shield from the lack of them. The shield, luckily, bounced right back and attached to his arms via magnets that must’ve been embedded in the suit.
The last time Tony had spoken with his father, they argued about his future. Tony had wished he could take back that moment ever since. It was the last time he saw both of his parents alive and he hadn’t even said goodbye to them because he was so upset…He hadn’t know the true meaning of upset until the next day when he had to identify their bodies and face the horrible truth that they were gone forever.
Wade dragged his lips from Peter’s neck and against his skin until their lips met. Wade licked his bottom lip and then pushed in tongue deeper into Peter’s mouth. Peter groaned and wrapped his arms around Wade’s head to press them closer together. They began to rock faster and the friction between their bodies made their desires grow.
“Thanks, Gary,” Steve said, tipping his coffee cup in recognition. They both waved goodbye and slipped away drinking their caffeine and happily leaning into each other.
It was decades later and, at this point in his life, he was no longer Bucky. His identity had been destroyed years prior and he had no memory of his former life. All he knew was that he had to complete the missions his master gave him and that was all that mattered.
She smirked and her gaze spanned over all three men before her. She stepped into the room stiffly and closed the door behind her. By the way she moved, Steve could tell something was wrong with her midsection. She had reattached the two halves of her body but it seemed to be not done properly. She was unable to stand up straight and had to lean a little to the left as she walked.
The super soldier, thankfully, was nowhere near any media devices or within reach of the paparazzi. Steve was busily hitting the punching bag in the main gym in the Avengers Tower, only a floor below Tony’s workshop.
“Yeah, when he knows he’s going to be hurt…” Steve mumbled uneasily, “I don’t have that. If it’s something that effects his mind shouldn’t you be able to see it on those brain scans?”
“Uh, no,” Tony replied. “I rather like it here: I get to sit around in my suit all day, helicopters circle the house, Pepper won’t stop trying to pack my luggage—.”
“Aunt Peggy,” Tony said, grabbing her attention. Steve relaxed immensely at the sound of his voice. “You didn’t think the Iron Man suit was empty, did you?”
“Oh, stop with the scientific terminology, it hurts my mind,” Peter sarcastically said. “And hell yeah we should!”
“I’m so disheartened to hear that,” Coulson replied, his voice dripping with his dry sarcasm. “And I’m sure Fury likes it that way which explains why your request keeps getting denied.”
Steve’s hand shot out and grasped Tony’s. Steve gasped, “I-I promised you that I would not leave you for Bucky.”
“We’re actually doing this,” Tony whispered, collapsing onto a nearby chair. He and Steve were still holding onto each other and neither let go when Tony fell. Tony could feel his husband’s grip shaking. The great Captain America could do nothing for his son. Tony knew Steve must have felt torn up inside by this fact.
“We were called back in after Stark threatened the Mandarin…And as soon as we landed we were looking for you,” Clint replied steely. “It was not hard to find you, you left your vintage bike out on the street right in front of this place.”
As Steve stared at Bucky, he felt the urge to embrace him again. He was so thankful to have him back –
“First, everyone needs to calm down,” Steve placated, lightly rubbing his shoulder. “Only once we have all gathered our wits can we face what is going on here…Would you be alright for a couple of minutes if I stepped out to speak with Wade and Tony?”
The Goblin stepped out of the light, in full goblin form, and smiling with large spiked teeth. He held his hand up and looked at the time glove, murmuring, “Right on time.”
That night, however, Steve found himself facing Tony in Tony’s bedroom, outside was sunset and the sky was red, shedding its blushing hue onto everything it touched, including themselves. Steve looked to the sunset and then back to his soulmate. Tony’s eyes were glittering like diamonds in the dying light and Steve was drawn to them like a beggar man.
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied. A door at the opposite side of the room opened and Steve stomped over to it like he was on mission. There were a number of suits in varying colors, all enclosed in protective plastic covering.
In quick succession, Steve heard him hit the water, Tony inhaled sharply, water gurgled in the speakers, Tony started to struggle for breath, spitting out water, and then his armor rattled as he was hit by something. After that there was only a sudden silence.
“I know, I know," Tony replied. It was going to be hard. He wasn’t used to retraining himself but he’ll do it for Steve.
Tony’s instantly creased in confusion as his brows shot together and his eye widened. He suddenly smiled and said, “I did not know you had it in you to joke, Capsicle.”
Tony slowly got to his feet and walked over to Bucky’s trembling form. He kneeled next to him and gently placed a hand on his back. Bucky flinched like he was struck but Tony did not pull away, in fact, he decided he wasn’t going to hold back and fully enveloped him into an embrace. Bucky seemed to stop breathing altogether and Tony hissed, “I forgive you for what you did because you had no choice in the matter. They brainwashed you. They took your mind. It wasn’t
Bucky laid down next to Steve, wrapped his arm over his torso, and laid Steve’s head on his chest. He whispered, “Yes, he is.”
“I am sorry that I hurt you but now that you are awake you should leave. Next time do not follow me,” Bucky stated.
“Only hot dogs in the west,” Steve replied. Tony shook his head. By the sound of Steve's garbled voice, he knew someone was coming home with onion-relish breath and he was going to make that someone brush his teeth before kissing a certain genius.
When he reached the man’s side, the President grinned and said, “You look quite formidable now! The Mandarin would be a fool to go after me with you
“Uh nice to see, well, hear you too, Jarvis,” Steve said to Tony’s AI. Peter perked up upon hearing the voice and looked around the elevator curiously.
And because he didn’t, countless people were dead and Pops was a host to the symbiote, cursed to eat people to survive.
She smiled sadly at him. She probably saw through his façade. She pulled on their joined hands and pressed herself into James’ chest. His breath caught in his throat whenever she did this. He was always overcome with the clash of the newness and the familiarity of her touch.
Steve’s silence felt oppressive within the first few seconds but Tony refused to turn around to face him. Eventually, Steve left. His footsteps echoed loudly in the small lab.
Tony held him tightly and, in a frightened voice gasped, “I – I’m alright, Steve. I got my reactor back and defeated the bad guy.
“Yes,” Tony whispered. His hazel eyes were searching his, worried and anxious about Steve could only guess why. “I love yo-.”
“I’m going to meet my soulmate in a week,” Steve gasped in shock. He turned to the older man, unashamed by the tears gathering in his eyes and he brokenly asked, “I-Is this real?”
Tony had said he would check in on him in the morning but Steve had yet to see him since then and it was already late in afternoon. He told himself not to read too much into it. Tony always lost track of time…Yet Steve could not stop his heart from clenching.
“Find him an evil twin who does not know 1940s terminology?” Steve asked, brushing dirt off his uniform from his scuffle with his imposter.
That was how Coulson found them, surround by holograms with sour looks on their faces. Strike that…Coulson and a red headed woman in a tight, tight body suit found them like this.
