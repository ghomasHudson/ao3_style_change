He lit a cigarette while he waited for the connection, thinking how crazy it was that he could pick up a phone in one part of the world, and she could answer it in another with hardly any lag at all. Back in the day, they’d probably had to do this kind of thing by letter, or telegram, or whatever. Not now. Now the news of dismemberment and death could be had at the touch of a few buttons. He didn’t know whether that was a good thing or a bad thing.
But, apparently, in Dr. Anderson’s class, you did.
Tony shook the blanket out and looked at it.  He heard Steve come up behind him but said nothing, waiting.
Clint was the one who brought it to his attention. Thinking back, Tony wasn’t sure if he was the only person who
“I don’t want to go where you’ve been with anybody else.”
Wanda took the man’s cap and laid it gently over his eyes.  He looked like a kid all tuckered out from a day at the beach.  “All I saw was a young boy and a woman sharing a cookie at a kitchen table,” she said.  “It was probably his mother.”
“Promise?”
Steve was lying on his side in Tony’s bed, the covers pulled loosely up to his waist. His eyes were closed, and Tony just stood looking at him for a second, drinking him in, aching for how beautiful he was, how perfect, how right he looked lying there in that bed. The left side had always felt so empty before, no matter how many times Tony had tried to fill it with one random hook-up or another, but here now, with Steve lying so peacefully in that space, it didn’t feel empty anymore.
He scowled, but Sam was right. He
“When we fight,” Steve began, “we’re going to win.  Everyone’s going to come home.  I know it.  I feel it.  Don’t you?”
-wife,” he said, looking up into Steve’s blue--Christ, how could they still be so fucking
“Are you sure?” Tony asked.
He called Steve, but no one answered. He left a message on his machine, vowing again to get him a cell-phone for Christmas. Or his birthday. His birthday was right around the corner. A cell-phone would be a very nice gift. And then he thought about his
“You’ve waited for me enough.”
“Do you want…” Tony began, then licked his lips. “Can I kiss you? Is that okay?”
Steve grabbed his arm. “We need medevac.”
Nat put her arms around his neck and kissed his cheek.  “We’re all on the same side here, honey.”
He looked up when the bathroom door opened, and his heart leapt into his throat.  Those butterflies were back in his stomach, doing their thing--SteveSteveSteveSteve.
The sky started to spit down rain as Tony drove into town.  It got worse while he waited for the food.  He sat at one of the small tables by the window, looking out as the occasional drops turned into a steady drizzle.  It was fine.  He was a good driver, a little rain never bothered him, but he felt bad for all those folks at the lake who had geared up for a fireworks show.
Double handfuls of clothing flew past him, landing in her suitcase, open on the bed.
Eighty percent, the situation.
Steve smiled, thinking about Tony and the way he’d felt in his arms.  “I think so.”
I spot another bottle that was untouched the night before, shimmering in the orange glow that bursts through my window.
“He wouldn’t be workin’ for the government without me if he wasn’t,” Taskmaster confirmed.
“News just in. We have reports that a rogue robot is wreaking havoc down the streets New York City.
“Always taking the easy way out.” Steve snarled in return, grimacing at the feeling of the fluid being pumped through his spine once again as it had been periodically.
He swallowed down his pride for a moment and placed his hand to Steve’s jaw, being light with his touch. “I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to call you a relic.”
She held her hands out, the newly fixed eyeplates glowing as she let out a screech and surged toward the boy, full throttle. Tony raised his hand, narrowing his already blurry vision to get some sort of clarity before shooting his repulsor at the woman from behind, sending her forward into Peter.
“I’m sorry… Steve, I’m sorry… I’m so sorry.”
Steve yelped out in pain, screaming as he felt the metal shatter his bone.
“It got hit by lightning.”
Steve shook his head, trying to remind himself that he was lucky to have this job in the first place, knowing full well that he shouldn’t have been looking a gift horse in the mouth. “Just a little bored, is all. I’m sure we’ll find something to do.”
“I’m on fire?! Put it out! This is an Armani coat!” He waved his hands around. Suddenly, that cool collected demeanour Tony had before in the office, briefly, had faded into the image of a fumbling inspector.
The director glared with a sharp intensity.  He didn’t fully understand why that annoyed him so much; after all, she was right. He didn’t know anything about the real Captain America; he didn’t even know he was still alive after all these years.  Tony would be sure to research it all, dig up all he can from those hidden files especially since he was in the facility.
The Super Soldiers eyes didn’t leave Tony for one second, unblinking and cold.
“Oh come on mate, you gotta be kidding me.”
I am grateful for what I was left and many people misunderstand that. I am grateful for my fortunes and for being given the opportunities and materials to build my success story, however I don’t wish for my life’s work to be built upon what my father had left me. I loved his work but I hated him, and his creations echo his voice and personality. I wanted to start from scratch and make people who really helped me proud, like Jarvis and Pepper and even… Him. I try my hardest every day to redeem myself, to push myself away from those demons that want to pull me back. But like I said earlier, some days are harder than others. Some days I see the bottle glimmering and I reach for it, I swallow heavily and inhale that scent, shutting my eyes.
“Hey! Cut me some slack!”
Each tube began to open, members of their team falling, some awakening upon the glass tubes opening. Peter, Bucky, Rhodey, Pepper, Strange, T’Challa all stepped out, regaining their footing and breathing in the thick air. Norman backed up against the wall, eyes widened in horror as each and every one of the team loomed up to him.
He placed Jessica down beside the plot they were digging and helped Peter out. “She’s probably…” It wouldn’t provide good morale to make a bad situation worse, especially in the boys head. “She might’ve gone into hiding, maybe she’s safe. But you know, she’ll find us and catch up eventually.” He clicked his faceplate up so his expression was in view, it was the least he could do.
Some days are harder than others.
“Your wings will be beautiful once you start to believe.”
“It’s fine, I wasn’t expecting you to.”
Tony Stark was in immediate denial.
“What?”
“Oh!” Tony’s nose scrunched a little to the prod, before he lifted the blanket that was around him, scooping Steve under it and bundling him closer. “You know, a king is nothing without his knight.”
“Come on… I promise, I’ll give her what she deserves.”
“You got it, boss!” Tony extended his hands down, into the car window as the moustached driver screamed with fear, not knowing what on earth was happening – seeing these two long robotic hands reach into his car and fiddle about with the steering wheel, but all that happened was Tony’s hands getting slapped away by quite powerful blows. The driver was clearly a martial artist of some sort, a small slap was enough to get Tony’s hands back, feeling the pain even though his limbs were metal.
“2PM!? Already?!” He shouts.
Tony pushed himself up slowly only to see Janet blasting Whirlwind back with her stings. She was fuelled by the passion to get Hank out of there, and was clearly fatigued from fighting for so long, but regardless, she continued to throttle the clearly possessed villain until he collapsed again.
Steve began plucking at the remainder of Tony’s buttons to release him from the confines of his smart, dark red shirt, but it was extremely difficult to remain focused when Tony was letting out murmurs that echoed from the back of his throat.
Steve stared, eyes going back from the bar of soap to Tony again.
“Whoa, here already?” he asked, looking at his watch.
Steve could see the pain in the other man’s expression; the way his jaw clenched was a clear enough tell. He couldn’t do much to put him at ease, but he did trail his fingers down Tony’s neck toward the armour plate.
“Don’t touch me with that needle!” He barked.
“No one asked you!” Steve used his shield to deflect a ray from its palm, but that was the rest of the holo-shields energy used, and it began to deplete and fizzle out. “And you’re not, Tony is human, and he has a heart!”
It had been an entire day since Steve had been in quarantine. As promised, Tony didn’t sleep at all. The engineer was running on nothing but the constantly refilling pot of coffee that was several steps away from him. He sipped from a mug that was in his hand while he was staring at a couple of calculations. Tony had moved his workbench so he could face the observation screen and keep an eye on Steve while he was working. A day was nothing for a man who would spend days on end awake, so this was none other than a casual all-nighter for him. The rest of the Avengers had long since come to the conclusion that Tony Stark was nocturnal or that his blood was brown – filled with coffee.
Killgrave should have never been trusted, and it was obvious from day one that Hammer would be nothing more than a pawn in his game of chess.
Steve was really back home, back in Brooklyn, and it was like nothing had ever changed. It was strange being out of the battlefield, but a relief that HYDRA had apparently fallen with the Nazi regime, and that everything was slowly starting to self-regulate. The economy was getting better and the best part of it all was that the kids were free to run around the streets again, happy and carefree.
“Tony…” His voice lowered. “What happened?”
He couldn’t get it out of his mind that easily, especially when there was a sudden tense silence and Tony was pacing the place like a lion in a cage. As soon as they reached the work in progress that was the mansion.
Tony’s breath hitched and he reached for the soft sheets that he was pooled in, grapping at them, body rocking with Steve’s hips. He wanted to keep his eyes open to look at Steve, to look at the Adonis that was giving him this much pleasure already; beautifully sculpted, strong, handsome, with his mop of blond hair now a wonderful mess and not to mention that heavy jawline and distinct dimple in his chin.
“Judging by the schematics that JARVIS is giving me, it looks like something chemical. It doesn’t say who the designer is. I’m sending it through all of the technology and weapons databases that I know but it’s using tech that I don’t think I’ve ever seen. You think it’s safe to say that it’s Latverian?”
“Steve its fine.”
“Not buying it Steve, I’m not going to do it, I’m going to fix you.”
“This is just like making your own character in a video game…” He smirked. “Infinite possibilities, infinite dimensions… Reed, why
He wasn’t supposed to be watching. At this point Tony was supposed to turn the shutters and turn the glass into a blind, but instead he dialled it to a one way mirror so that he could see through. Reed, Hank and T’Challa weren’t in the lab at that time in the morning; they were catching up on their own rest as well as running samples in their own lab. Tony was the only one there and he was barely awake. Staying up for as long as he did was having a number of ill effects on him, especially his mental state. He felt like a wreck and strangely emotional, as well as exhausted, frustrated and upset, his body was trembling oh so slightly and his teeth chattered – the freezing cold atmosphere of the labs was actually getting to him. He covered himself up with a black turtleneck, and yet he still shivered, but he didn’t want to tear his eyes away from Steve for a second.
“It… Argh!” He grimaced, his entire body trembling.
“Then kill him!” Norman ordered.
Hammer was vindicated, standing above Tony as they unstrapped him, gleaming with pride whilst he took in the sight of the blood still trickling from the wound.
“Great!” The nervousness faded to glee. “It’s a date! Wait—oh, not a date—a uh, mate? Man date?”
That at least was something to be grateful for.
“What radar?” Tony growled.
“What the hell happened?” Steve helped Tony try to scramble to his feet, but he caught sight of him clutching his side, immediately his hands reached for it, to help support him.
The loud doors creaked just as loud as the staircase that he was on earlier did, the rusted hinges squeaking before letting out a low judder. Steve was prepared
“Peter, can you open that respirator and pull out the green power panel? It’s just behind the red power wire.”
It pained him to do so, but again he knew that treading on anything that would get Steve agitated may get him to reveal more information, and at this point he was piecing together everything he could get.
Tony looked at him sharply to hide how much that truly pained him. He wanted to reply with every bone in his body, but deep inside he knew that this was just a venomous retort fuelled by the death of a friend. This is how Peter grieved; he grieved with pain and darkness. He turned with Jessica’s limp body in his arms, trying to find somewhere for it. There was no point answering Peter, it’d only heat the situation up further.
Reed was close-by, having not heard the soldier respond until now. His eyes lifted from his notepad and he stared over Tony’s shoulder, resisting the urge to stretch his neck for a closer examination, but even he knew that would probably receive a slap in the face from Tony.
He had held both repulsors out, and kicked open the door with powerful force. His lights guided his path, even as nervous as he was to see an enemy he hadn’t seen in so long. To be honest, the thought of Hammer sent chills down his spine, the man was always so obnoxious, so twisted and insisted in constant low blows. Unfortunately, dealing with someone who called themselves ‘smart’ often meant that they would think outside the box, which was far more troublesome to predict, even with Tony’s simulator software giving him odds and statistics in the corner of the HUB display on his internal monitors. The eyeslits he was peering out of also lit his path as he stepped further into the dormant factory. He didn’t know why on Earth he should be nervous about this plan given that Hammer was inferior to himself in terms of intellect, it was the unpredictability and uncertainty that came along with it. But Tony reminded himself it was only Hammer he was dealing with, so there was no reason to be scared. Instead he held his head high and continued with renewed confidence.
“What?” Tony’s eyes shot open wide and he ran toward the monitors to watch how the blood was reacting on the screen, having put nano-cameras the size of cells into the blood that they were transfusing.
Instead the nose of snapping twigs caught him, following the sound. Crunching leaves, heavy breaths, someone was running and both Steve and Tony bolted after the noise hoping for a new kill.
“In theory.” Jan tilted her head.
It was time to find Steve.
Steve jumped back. “Holy smokes!”
He was going to answer, but something stopped him. “Never mind.”
“Dum-E…” Tony brushed his hand over the smallest bot and carried it up, placing it on the table delicately. “Dammit… How did this happen? Reed!?” he called out. “Reed, what happened? Are you okay?!”
Steve admired someone that spoke with that much confidence, noticing that proud smirk plastered over Tony’s face.
“So Reed and I were collaborating, doing our work for the police, who I at that point worked for as a newly qualified detective, and drafted up plans for the perfect police robot. Only thing was, our prototypes constantly failed. They needed something much smarter than AI, they needed real brains. Regardless, our work became well known and admired and wanted by dozens.”
Peter tapped his masked chin, “I don’t think you’d be far off with that hypothesis.” He said, crawling up to Carol. “Carol, you hear me? Do you know who I am? How many fingers am I holding up, and yes, thumbs count.” He said as he waved his hands in front of her face. She snarled through the webs, letting out that Amazonian scream that could make any man quake in their boots.
“The gas – people that inhaled it… Well, they started to deteriorate, some faster than others. More explosions started happening around the city, then around the world, now it’s practically part of the atmosphere. It causes a neural breakdown, the only way to stop it is this chip. The chip contains a small pulse that’ll push the toxin away, it has to be active.”
Doom spun on his heel, leaning in until he was inches from Reed’s face. “He is nothing but a tin man to me!” He pulled back, shaking his head. “I have always been capable of creating more superior creatures, robots with far more potential than being lackeys for the police. I could make an unstoppable army for my country – Latveria.”
“Can you talk me through this whole Big Brother thing? It’s been driving me nuts.”
“Why’s that sir?” A curious young intern enquired, peeking over her crescent, thick framed glasses, her clipboard held to her chest. “He’s a hero, wouldn’t it be best for him to go and join Iron Man and the others out in battle? I mean we could always give him therapy to help him with the issues that he has--”
“Tony I’m always here, I always am. Just remember that, I was your hero, so make me proud.”
“What is it Tony?” Steve asked gently.
A huge mountain of pillows and blankets, a small light in them glowing between the tiny gaps managing to escape – built around Tony’s bed was a giant fort of pillows.
“So they were his orders? To kill all heroes? So what about all of these people going on killing sprees, killing these heroes, are they under orders too?”
The blond was more confident than Tony had anticipated, though he did make a mental note of how many women would fawn over him and that natural confident persona that made the Captain who he was managed to transfer through to Steve, of course it would, Steve was the man behind the shield. The Captain’s strong arms raised, instead of stroking him with it, he was rolling his own hips against the dark haired man, the feeling of their lengths slicking against one another made constant moans of bliss escape the Tony’s hand heart shaped lips which were soon hushed by the crush of Steve’s lips against his own; heated, desperately, longingly tasting him. Tony’s hand scrambled over for the bottle of lube that had rolled next to him, letting out a soft murmur against Steve’s lips as a warning before lifting it up to his mouth popping it open with his teeth, making Steve’s entire body tense at the sound alone.
“They would have to be
So that was all of the fantastic four down and out.
“Let them handle their own business, Steve. Don’t get involved. I know it’s in your nature.”
Silence, then a short nod followed.
In response there was a lot of ‘that’s true’, seeming to be the general consensus. People were actually agreeing, posing that as the reason that people were afraid or weary of Tony in the first place.
Tony was pacing like a caged animal, walking back and forth. His black Armani shoes echoed a distinct clicking from the heel as he strode from one side of the lab to the other. His hand held his chin while his other patted his thigh, needing something to touch and play with.
“He’s got a wife--?! Never mind, just listen to what they have to say at least!”
Steve blinked. He saw no tripod, no huge box, but he decided to see where this was going. Tony pivoted on his heel, taking a few steps back and holding out his square black phone with a giant Stark Industries label plastered on its cover.
responsibility.
Steve dashed to protect Tony as quickly as he could, always staying a couple of steps ahead of him with his shield facing the beams. Each blast was taking its toll, the shields power fading with each passing moment.
“Watching you try to kill yourself.  That was worse, Steve.”
what I’m talking about.  A lot better than you do, that’s for sure.”
“‘Kay, Daddy!” she answered, then turned her eyes up to Steve’s. “May I take your coat?” she asked formally, and Steve bit the insides of his cheeks to keep the laughter in.
“Me too,” he said, and kissed her again. She was starting to feel a little heavier, her words coming a little slower as sleep started to come on. “But I’ll think about you every day, okay?”
“Maybe I’m okay with that.” Tony slipped his arms around Steve’s waist. They went around him so easily. So smoothly. Like it was meant to be. “Maybe I just want one more night with you,” he said, leaning in until he was speaking against Steve’s smooth throat. “Our last one ended so hard. And at the lake…” he shook his head. His hair brushed Steve’s skin, making him shiver. “Why can’t we have a little more time? Just one more night where we don’t think about anything but us?”
Tony rubbed his eyes, frustrated beyond belief.  “You always fucking do that.”
“No.  You probably don’t.  They weren’t like those kids back there.  They weren’t nice like that.”
Steve lowered his head gently against Tony’s, marveling at the soft feeling of his hair against his cheek. “Your father will change his mind,” he said. “I’m sure he will.”
live forever.
Tony sauntered toward him, hands in his pockets.  He wasn’t wearing a jacket, just a long-sleeved thermal under a concert tee.  Alice in Chains, this time.  Steve remembered Tony playing him an album once, going into raptures about “grunge” and the Seattle music scene of the nineties.  “Alice in Chains stands apart, though,” he’d said.  “Christ, Steve, listen to the melody.  Isn’t it beautiful?”
--Steve had felt with Morgan grew, as he watched her lead Dodger down the hallway, then just kept growing when Tony came toward him, put his arm around his neck, and pulled him in for a kiss. It was brief, friendly, and sweet. Steve’s heart thumped crazily in his chest.
“Sure,” he said.  He was still seventy percent asleep, so he hoped the question wasn’t too important.
Ross was nodding, his phone glued to his ear.  Blood gushed down his face.  “Yes.  I’ll stay right here.”  He ended the call.  Despite his bloody face and severely-canted nose, he looked almost cheerful.  “They’re on their way.”
Steve came to him, moving slowly in the water. He didn’t take his hand, even when he got close enough, just looked at it warily, and Tony laughed again softly. “Closer,” he said, and opened and closed his fingers a few times for emphasis. “Come on. I won’t bite.”
The portal closed after them, and there they stood.  The cell was small, uncomfortably so, what with three extra people now standing in it, and Tony saw there were no bars on this door.  No bars at all, and no light to speak of.  Just a little metal room containing one sorcerer, one witch, one genius, and one super-soldier.
Tony thought crazily, and then Steve’s hands were around his throat.
“Obie isn’t the boss of me,” Tony said, and he took another step, pressing almost completely against Steve. The fire escape was already small, and with the two of them on it together, there really was no room to move back. Not that Steve wanted to. He knew he should, but he didn’t. “I can see who I want.”
Steve’s other hand--the one not already holding Tony’s--moved to rest on his knee. “Yeah,” he agreed. “There is.”
“Was it meeting my parents?” she asked, flashing angry eyes at him.  “Is that what this is about?”
Tony picked up the pace, jacking him hard and fast now.  "You gonna come for me, baby?" he asked.
even as the left side stayed cold from the winter air, and he wanted nothing more than to rest his cheek against the snow for a little while to cool it, but he didn’t. The others had drawn away from him while he had stood looking up at the mountains--
Steve rummaged in the water and pulled out the last fork.  He rinsed it and put it in the drainer with the rest.  “You’re not really going to kick them out, right?” he asked as Tony entered the kitchen.
And then he stopped talking.
He shrugged.  “I don’t know.  A while.  I didn’t really realize what it was until Clint’s farm, though.”
“With anybody?” Steve asked. “I thought...I heard you had a lot of girlfriends in California...” he began, but Tony shook his head.
“That’s normal," Nat said.
Steve nodded.  “Thanks, Tony.  Thanks for doing that.”
"Is Clint with you?" she asked carefully.
“Yeah.”
A sick anger roiled in Tony’s stomach.  “But that’s not what happened, right?”
Steve’s heart pounded in his ears, his blood pumped wildly.  He leaned closer still, tightening his grip on Tony even more.  It was possessive, demanding.  He couldn’t stop it.  He didn’t want to.  “You need to stop talking now,” he said, and then they were kissing, and it felt more than merely right--it felt like coming home.
“The Tower’s fine.  Then Wanda can stay with you tonight and leave from there when she’s ready.”
“No, I really should go.  Walk me out?”
s, Steve?” he asked, marveling silently over how easily they had slipped into this banter. “Not really your style.”
? Do you carry that?”
to be on top.”
Steve turned back to Natasha. He’d almost forgotten she was there. In the face of Tony’s all-consuming personality, it was easy to get lost, easy to forget where you were. Easy to forget who you were, what you were, and that you had no business wondering what it would be like to just curl up in the eye of the storm that was Tony Stark and live out the rest of your life with him raging all around you.
“No, I said I’d do this.  I meant it.  I’ll take them.”
Tony ran his fingers through the hair at the back of Steve’s neck, pressed his thumb into the muscle there. “Are you sure?”
“What?  Think about your boyfriend, Doctor Strange?”
“You won’t leave me, will you, Tony?”
Steve shrugged self-consciously.  “It’s a big bed,” he said, and looked down at his hands.  He picked at one short nail, then glanced up at Tony with a shy, fragile smile.  “If you want.”
It was easier to get drunk in Malibu.  Or, more accurately, it was easier to
Tony sat up a little straighter, pulled Steve’s leather jacket aside--but just barely.  He didn’t want to relinquish that warmth, that comfort completely--and took the paper in his hand.
“Yeah.”
“Usually do,” he said, and was that a little snort of laughter he’d heard coming from the couch?  He thought it might have been.
"Come on, baby.  Come back to me."
Steve blinked.  Confusion dimmed his smile but didn’t lessen its charm.  Tony’s heart ached, doing a little double-flip inside his chest.  “What’s wrong with that?” Steve asked.  “We are friends.  Aren’t we?”
rousing.  Get your mind out of the gutter, you dirty, old man.”
“Sam?”
Tony looked up at him, concern turning his eyes nearly black.  “More nightmares?”
A runner of scarlet escaped his mouth as he drew in another breath.  The silence seemed very loud as they waited for the next one.  Instead, they heard the unmistakable thunder of the Iron Man suit overhead.  It flashed across the sky, the same red as the blood staining Steve Rogers’ mouth.
Also, I never know about putting real things in fics, but I needed a dog, and someone just happens to own the cutest dog ever, so there's that now. Welcome to my world, Dodger!
“It’s okay, baby.”
“Do you wanna get out of here?” Steve said before he could change his mind.
“Not all apologies have to happen because you did something,” Tony said.  “Sometimes you just say you’re sorry to be nice.  Because the other person needs to hear it.”
never forget it.”
“I’m sorry,” he managed, and bit his lips to hold in the laughter.  “It’s just something--
he thought, rubbing Steve’s back in long, soothing strokes.
“Yeah.”
, Steve thought fleetingly, and went in. He closed the door.
Sam sighed. “Call Happy.”
The reception was loud.
Tony breathed out a laugh of his own, then twisted in Steve’s arms so he could face him. Steve let his head rest on the pillow and smiled at him. Just a little. Just a tiny one, but it was filled with a warmth that Tony hadn’t thought possible in a moment like this. A moment where they were essentially breaking up--again. Tony touched his mouth with one finger, traced his lips, then ran up through his hair. Steve just stayed silent, watching him, that little smile on his face.
“I’m sure that’s not true.”
And oh god, holding his hand felt good. Natural, honest, and
“It looked like it.”
“No,” he whispered, and while his voice was serious, there was a little smile playing around his lips, and another one in his eyes. Along with something else. Something possessive and greedy, something that seemed more than happy that Tony had never gone this far with anyone else. Something that seemed more than happy to be Tony’s first.
Steve kissed him.
“Pfft,” Tony huffed, and left the house.
“I knew the answer because of
Tony could feel his own tears starting to well in his eyes, but he brushed them away with his hand. He nodded.
“Hundreds. Enough to fill your daddy’s whole bathtub,” he answered, and Morgan giggled sleepily, her eyes slipping closed. He brushed her hair back from her forehead.
Tony frowned, suddenly uncomfortable, suddenly worried it was too much.  There were a lot of zeros on that check.
Sam’s frown deepened. “Ready?”
Tony dropped his head down onto their clasped hands.  She removed one--gently--and ran it through his hair.  He let her pet him for a moment, reveling in the sheer comfort of it, then raised his head.  He tried to smile.
He ran a hand through Steve’s hair. “Maybe we
Steve wheeled up beside him.  “You cold?”
He had asked.  In Steve’s room in Wakanda.  Steve had been in and out, delirious most of the time from pain meds.  Fury had stopped in, sat by Steve’s bedside for eight hours, then right before he left, he’d asked Tony to come back.  To be an Avenger again.
“But not impossible.”
He’d thought about it alot. Every night for the last three nights. For hours.
He gripped her wrist in his before she could take the picture down. He did it gently but firmly, not wanting to hurt her--her wrist or her feelings. “Really, Mom,” he said. “It’s okay. I was just surprised, that’s all. I didn’t know he’d sent you a picture. I didn’t know you guys even still talked.”
(See the end of the chapter for
kind of a big deal. At least to me, because that one’s kind of competitive, but I think I can get it. I know I can. And that...you know. It’s nice. Knowing I can do something. That I’m qualified. That I’m good at something, and other people can see that too. It feels good.”
Tony kissed him again. Again and again. And in between kisses, he said
“Yeah,” Steve said. “You Starks have a real problem with being reserved. You’re almost boring.”
It didn’t take long to take care of things, and six hours later, everyone was assembled on the rooftop deck of the Tower, beers on ice, burgers on the grill, Bruce’s pasta salad sequestered in a cooler away from everyone’s stealthy, olive-filching fingers.
For several long moments, there was nothing.  Nothing but their breathing.  Tony began to feel disappointment.  It wasn’t working.  Why wasn’t it working?  He remembered all too well the images Wanda had implanted in his head years ago, why could she not do this now?  Sure, Steve had gotten steadily more stubborn as the years wore on, but Wanda still should have been able to breach his defenses.  Especially since he wasn’t supposed to be defending himself at all.  He was offering himself up, not as a sacrifice, but as a willing participant.  Shouldn’t she have done it by now?  Christ, she was powerful enough to crack an Infinity Stone, but not one grouchy ex-soldier who--
"I'm not mad," he said as Tony came near.  He didn't look mad. Just alone. "Are you still mad?"
He was nervous.
“Are you sure everything was alright?” the server asked, as she ran his card.
“You weren’t going to do that.”
getting better.  His mobility was starting to return.  It had been six weeks since Thanos.  Four of those, he’d spent in Shuri’s med-bay.  The first in a drug-induced coma, the last three awake, in pain, starting the healing process, learning how to handle things like this.
Tony yanked his hands out of Steve’s grip.
you to--”
“Nah. You were all hidden under that polyester tent they made us wear.”
“No.  I was just trying to speak in a way you’d understand.”
.” He held Tony tighter, and now there was no way to stop the tears. They came hard and fast. “We graduate in two days. Me and my mom are leaving as soon as the ceremony is over. We’ll be gone for three weeks, and by the time we get back, you’ll be gone. Then by the time
of her. Like they had to protect her from stuff that would hurt her.
Tony sighed and rubbed his face.
“Oh,” Steve dead-panned.  “Goody.”
“Nope. I’m not funny at all.”
“Where are we?” Steve asked.  His breath plumed out, giving his words weight.
“I’ve got a little experience with that kind of thing myself.  It sucks.”
changed.
There was a general chuckle around the room. Most of the people there knew what that was like. He blushed, because that felt good. Making them laugh. Sharing with them felt good too. It had been a long time since he’d done that. A long time since he’d felt comfortable enough to do that.
“Go away,” he muttered, and even with his head on his knees, Tony could still hear how wounded he sounded.  “Go away.  You’re not here.  Just go away.”
“Sit down and buckle up.  I’ll tell Jerry we’re ready to go.”
Steve shook his head fondly. “What about you?”
But he wasn’t alone now.  He had friends.  He had family.  He had Steve.  He didn’t worry about being alone when he died.  Or after he died.  Not anymore.  They’d all be there with him, and Steve would be there after.  He’d promised.  It had been part of their marriage vows.
Tony reached down and picked Steve’s hand up from where it lay on the bed. “Mmm,” he hummed, looking at it. “This looks good on you.”
“But it’s not, right?” Steve pressed.
Tony stopped giggling. The feeling in his gut--that flip-flop feeling--that made him feel all dreamy remained, but he stopped giggling. Steve’s eyes stayed on him, quiet and calm, but measuring. Like he knew the answer, but was waiting for Tony to say it. Maybe he was just being polite, too.
“You okay?” Tony asked from behind him.
"What?" Tony said.  "She's smart, crafty, resourceful.  She's like the daughter I never had."
“Stay there. Okay? Stay there. I’m coming.”
“So, did you just call me out here to offer me your head on a plate, or was there something else?”
He ducked into the nearest deli and sat down.  The waitress came over with a cup and a pot of coffee.  “Good morning, Mr. Stark.”
"I would live every second again, Steve," Tony said.  "Every single second."
“No.  It’s not.  Please, baby, do I?  Do I make you happy?”
?” he said. “I go to all this trouble, and all I get is an
Steve whined shamelessly.  “Tony, please.  God, you’re killing me.  Please.”
“Noon, baby.  Just like last time.”
“Fine.”
He shot her a look and a huff of breath.  She pulled him onward.  Bruce was making spaghetti for dinner, and homemade garlic bread.  A siren-song if ever there was one.
They turned their manic, polite eyes on Tony en masse.  “Mr. Stark.  We were just telling Captain Rogers about our organization.”
“Yes, you can.  It’s easy.  Just don’t leave.”
Tony leaned closer and put his head on Steve's shoulder.  There was no point in arguing. Especially during the lover's/happy hour.  "Fine," he said. "You're right. You're always right."
was probably just fine up there all by himself.  He probably felt pretty pleased with himself that he had let Tony work himself up and then left him all alone down here.
“Doesn’t like guns, does she?” Ross said.  His voice dripped with the same scorn his eyes held.  “I suppose when your whole body is a weapon you wouldn’t want competition.  Is that it,
A special thanks to those of you who stuck with me from the beginning, those who commented on almost every chapter/story. I kept going for you, almost as much as I kept going for me.  This may not have ended how any of us wanted, but I am a little in love with you all for being here with me through it. You're beautiful, wonderful, and lovely, and if I could hug you all, I would!
Two, Steve, damn.  Give me some credit.  Michael was
Tony shook his head slowly, any trace of iciness he felt at the mention of Steve’s years in exile melting away.  “I don’t know, baby,” he said quietly.
"You don't
“The Army."
Tony rubbed his face with one hand and drummed the fingers of his other against Steve’s thigh.  “Okay,” he said, sighing.  “Okay.  It’s okay.”
Steve shook his head. “Sleeping.”
Tony shrugged, smiled a little himself.  “I can handle it.”
Tony had planned on jumping on him the second they were inside, but now that they were here in this warm, happy, familiar space, he didn’t do it. He looked around instead, his eyes drinking in the apartment like a cool glass of water after a long, hot day. It had been a long time since he’d been here. He called Sarah every couple of months, just to see how she was doing, to tell her how he was. He liked hearing her voice. He liked that she always seemed genuinely happy to hear from him. He knew he should probably stop bothering her, but he kept calling. Those calls never lasted very long, just a few minutes, but it was nice. An indulgence he couldn’t quite give up just yet, like an alcoholic saying they’d wait until after the holidays to give up drinking...and then after Valentine’s Day...and then after St. Patrick’s Day...
Tony sighed and looked up at Steve. He was still pouting, but Steve could see something else in his eyes. Something that was warm and soft and tender. Steve wanted to believe it was love. He hoped it was. God, he
Tony ignored him and came back to Steve. He took his hand, and even though his heart was breaking, Steve held it tightly. Tony chased his eyes, and Steve finally let them be caught again. Tony smiled at him, and Steve tried to smile back.
“I’m going to the garage,” he said shortly.
“1970 Plymouth Hemi-Cuda,” he said.  “A ‘71 sold for 3.5 million a few years back.”
“We just came for a chat,” Tony said.  “And a quick cuddle, if you don’t mind.”
Steve blushed, nodding, and Wanda went to where Sam sat asleep in the chair by the window. She slid into his lap and soothed him with kisses when he stirred. Morgan followed and knelt back by the coffee table. She picked up a crayon and started to color. Steve looked after her, troubled. She hadn’t said anything to him at all.
“You force me to make that pasta salad for every-”
He wondered what Tony was doing right now. Wondered what he would do if he knew about Steve’s mom. The two of them were still friends. They spoke to each other. Tony had cared enough to send her a picture of his baby girl, and Sarah had cared enough to hang it on the wall along with the family pictures. That meant something. It meant something to Sarah, and that meant something to Steve.
He looked at all of them.  Sam looking at the stars, a contented smile on his handsome face.  Nat curled against Steve’s chest, her eyes on Bruce.  He looked back, steady, adoring, so obviously in love it was almost funny.  Would have been funny if Tony hadn’t felt the same look on his own face from time to time when he looked at Steve.
do.” He smiled again. “Of course, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t hope you both choose S.I., but you definitely do have a choice.”
Steve sucked his bottom lip into his mouth and closed his teeth over it.  His gaze had not left the car, and Tony didn’t think he had any idea how he looked in the cold dark, his eyes hungry, his teeth sunk into his lip.  The street lamp had put a crystal halo around his head.  He looked like an angel.  An archangel from the Old Testament.  Strong, vicious, righteous, smiting sinners with a vanquishing sword.  And why not?  Had he not wielded a God-weapon before?  Was that not, in all actuality, exactly what he was?  Or, at least, had once been?
“But other stuff could happen too,” Sam said, and Tony looked back at him. “You know that.”
“I don’t want to break up with you, Steve,” Tony said softly. “Nothing you’ve said, just now or ever, makes me want to break up with you.”
Steve nodded. “Okay.”
“I’ve fucked up a lot.  Take your pick.”
Sometimes they didn’t talk at all. Sometimes, they just sat there, books open, notebooks and pencils and pens strewn about, looking, for all intents and purposes, like they were studying, but they weren’t. Not schoolwork, anyway. No, during those times, they just sat looking at each other, eyes playing little teasing games while they studied each other instead. Not even the librarian came through much, so they felt safe doing it. Safe thinking that they were in their own world there, where no one would bother them.
“Who’s with him?”
Tony ran his finger along Steve’s jaw. “I wouldn’t mind it you stayed for a couple
“That was all of us.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered. “I’m sorry for the way things have been. I’m gonna try and make it worth it for you, okay? I’m gonna try and
Steve leaned on the railing and watched as the driver--the
“Why don’t people stare at the sun?” Steve said, shrugging. “It’s dangerous.”
“Why?”
“We’re just hearing this now?” Nat asked, her eyes resting once again on Tony.
want to learn about the intricacies of the Mayan irrigation systems. Don’t you?”
Tony pulled him down, kissing his mouth.  “I know.  Trust me, I know.  But I want to.  Don’t you want to?”
things--that were scary enough that sometimes I can’t sleep at night when I think about them too much? Knowing that I-I might hurt her?”
Steve looked at him sharply.  Tony shrugged.  Natasha had told him of their relationship, and the more he saw them together, the more true it became, but Steve was looking at him in a way that suggested he had never thought of it that way.  Or, at least, had never dared to hope he
“Yeah, you did.”
get my own drawer?”
Ross held it in his hand, looked at the chicken-scratch writing spelling out his name on the front, his return address, Steve’s name and address in the top left.  There was even a stamp on it.  Tony’s good, sweet, conscientious man had put it on the envelope himself that morning, marveling at the fact that he didn’t have to lick it to make it stick.
They had gotten intel of hostile activity in a small town a few miles from camp, and Colonel Phillips sent Steve and his unit to check it out. He didn’t actually think there was much to it, but he sent them anyway. Ever since 9/11, every bit of intel was checked out, even if it was just rumor. And there was another reason too. The month or two around the holidays were hard ones. Everyone was missing home. Missing their parents, their spouses, their hometowns. Phillips kept them moving as often as he could. Kept them busy. Busy hands made for peaceful minds. Or productive minds, anyway.
He didn’t turn when Tony came into the room, even though he had heard him.  Even without super-soldier hearing, a person could have heard even Tony’s barefoot approach.  It was midnight-silent.  Not even the street made much noise, not this high up, anyway.
“We’ll think of something,” Tony said, and there was a smooth promise to his voice that made Steve feel slightly weak in the knees. “Are you ready to go?”
like him.
“Um,” Tony said, and his voice was softer. Darker. “How
Tony thought, looking at Steve’s face, drinking him in as though he were a tall glass of water after a long, hot day.
“Son. The car’s waiting.”
He moaned softly into Tony's mouth, chasing that quiet, wanting to find the oblivion that was always there in Tony's embrace.
“What?”
, then it was worth it.
Steve kept walking. He didn’t look at Sam. He didn’t look back. He didn’t have to. He didn’t want to. Even when the sound of Tony’s car growling into life reached his ears. Even when it howled like a jungle cat as he punched the gas. Steve just kept walking. He didn’t look up. Didn’t look after it, even when it sped directly past them, made an illegal U-turn in the street, and passed them again in a showy flash of red and a squeal of tires. He just kept his head down and kept walking.
“So, Majorca, huh?” Clint asked.
They walked up to the door, the three of them, Tony, Natasha, and Wanda.  Bruce was taking his ban seriously.  Tony did not think he felt bad about it tonight.  Tony let Natasha handle the door.  She was a spy, after all, she knew her way around a locked door.  He and Wanda stood by, letting her do her thing.  Wanda picked at her fingernail, seeming bored with this part of it, and Tony thought she came by that honestly.  She could have opened the door in less than a second, but seemed comfortable taking a back-seat here.  Tony was less comfortable.  His hands shook, wanting to fidget, wanting something to do.  He shoved them into his pockets and gripped the lining tight.
He looked up.  Shook his head.  “They’re coming for you.”
Once he got the groceries and picked up his dry cleaning and had a burger with Jeff, it was one o’clock and he’d forgotten all about the call.  He checked his phone after lunch and listened to the message.  It was short.  To the point.  Not much more than a time and place, and now here he was.
And now, walking up to Mr. Barker’s office, it seemed ironic to him just how right that assessment had been.
“Loosen that stick up his ass a little?”
“He’s just a romantic.  He falls for the person, not the accessories.”
“You’re a smartass.”
“I’m glad.”
“It’s cool, Rogers,” he said.  “Last night on Earth and all that.  I get it.”
Steve smiled, feeling happier than he ever had in his life.  “Still…”
“What-” he inhaled sharply as Tony moved against him. “What are they doing?”
Tony tried not to feel guilt over that.
Steve gave him a smile. A tiny one. Just a flash of white teeth between red lips. “Just going to get a drink,” he said, and then he was gone.
mention my wife, and just show me the Quinjet specs?  I actually do have another meeting.”
“No,” Tony said, matching his tone.  “No, don’t.”  He reached out, laid his hand against Steve’s chest.  It was as firm as ever.
“What are you doing here?”
At three o’clock, pretty much on the dot, Tony heard a car in the drive.  Steve was in the shower.  Tony had repaid the favor, getting on his knees right there in the kitchen.  They only had a few minutes, but Steve was easy to push up and over, thank you, Dr. Erskine, and wanted a quick wash before the guests arrived.  Needed one.  They’d been a little careless.
“Tonight?” Steve said. “Nothing. I’ll work it out tomorrow. Just like I said I’d do.”
But he was nothing compared to the actual old man in the house there.
“Don’t stop writing.  In my opinion, at least, it’s a good thing.”
Tony laughed under his breath. It was relieved and happy. “Good, huh?”
Steve was across the room before either of them knew he was moving.  Tony flinched as Steve’s large hand closed over his elbow, but he didn’t pull away.  Steve’s touch was gentle.
“Do you mind?”
Tony nodded. “Yeah. Course, I did.”
“Okay, Daddy.”
Tony reached Steve just in time.  He put a steadying hand on Steve’s chest.  His heart was pounding like a racehorse.  His skin, deathly pale.
Steve nodded.  “I’m trying, Tony.  I’m just getting tired.  You know?”
Tony burned to know.
“What?”
This took a little longer than I had hoped--THANKS LIFE--but here it is!
He said nothing, did not move.  Nat touched his face gently.  “Steve?”
“I told you--”
nest too.
going to get tired of hearing that.”
a bath.”
She took him in her arms and held him against her, rubbing his back brusquely.  “How are you?” she asked.  “Really?”
“I don’t think you doing it on our kitchen counter with a spoon makes a knighthood official, Tony.”
Tony looked at Steve and pulled a guilty face.
“Fuck,” he muttered, then called him right back.
Steve moved closer, as close as he could get. “A beat-the-shit-out-of-Howard-Stark kind of mood,” he muttered.
“Well, listen harder.  I love Pepper,” he said, and when Steve looked away, Tony squeezed his hand maybe a bit harder than necessary until he looked back.  “I’ve loved her for years and I always will love her.  But being with you?  Baby, I didn’t have a choice.”
This one's a little short.
The party raged for another two hours after Natasha and Bruce left, and then people finally started dropping off.
“Uh,” Steve said. And that was all. His brain was a blank, black hole. He raised his hands helplessly. There was nowhere to put them.
whatever Clint said and letting it go. He wasn’t. He knew he wasn’t. That wasn’t him. He wasn’t a jealous guy. Never had been.
Howard swallowed the rest of his coffee and stood up. He held out his hand. “Thank you again for letting me come here.”
“Yes,” Tony said.  “Very.  And so was Sir Purr.”
Because he wanted that, too.  He wanted Tony to feel the same pride he felt.  He wanted to prove that Tony had done the right thing when he chose him, and if he’d done it Wanda’s way, it would not have been true.
“No,” he said sharply.  “No, I’m fine.”
“I meant you, dumb-ass.”
“No, Steve.  Please.  I don’t want to wait anymore.  Please.”
“I don’t like it when you do it, either.”
“I noticed.”
Tony wanted to shout.
Those were the kinds of things he had to write about. But, of course, he didn’t write about those either.
Bruce stared at him, horrified.  “You-You have us, Tony,” he stammered.
“I’m not.”
“What kind of message?” Tony asked. His voice seemed faint. Steve wasn’t sure if that was because Tony was speaking quietly, or out of some trick of his own auditory senses. It didn’t matter, he told himself. It didn’t fucking matter. Just tell him what was going on and get out. Get out.
“As soon as I get home.  Okay?”
Tony put his hand over Steve’s mouth. “Shut up, Rogers,” he said. “You’re dicking with my righteous indignation.”
And so what if he had never gotten around to that apology
Even in the dim light, he knew the shape of her body under those blankets.  He knew that shoulder.  He knew the sound of her breath.  Tears came, all unbidden to his eyes, and he thought he had cried more in the last twenty-four hours than he had since Peggy died.  But he didn’t mind.  These tears didn’t sting.
Tony kissed his temple.  “Did you not hear what I just said?
“Who?” Strange asked.  “Who was doing this?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"We talked about it before.  When you were in The Raft. We almost did it then."
Thirty-six hours and counting.
Wanda put her hand over Steve’s.  “It wasn’t for nothing.  We got to be together for a little while.”  Tony stared at them in disbelieving silence as Wanda kissed both of Steve’s cheeks.  “I love you,” she said.
“You heard what I said.”
Steve grasped Wanda with gentle hands.  “Will you go back to the Tower with Tony?  This has been a lot.  You need to rest.”
Tony sighed, resting his head in his hand.  He knew how much he was asking of her.  He didn’t want to hurt her, but he couldn’t stop being with Steve.  Not even for her.  Pepper was his past.  Steve was his future.  He still believed that.  Even if Steve wouldn’t answer his letters, wouldn’t see him, wouldn’t speak to him, he still believed it.  Would always believe it until he drew his last breath.
what you just said,” Tony countered, kissing him again. “What you said is that I was different. You said I mattered more than anybody else.”
Hope you enjoy this short chapter of pure sweetness.  Thanks for reading!
Steve cocked his eyebrow. He was still smiling, but now it was questioning. “How are we gonna do that?”
“I said, shut
“Don’t you want-”
“Hey,” he said.
But this, this he was doing now, maybe this was the first step in finally closing it.
Steve ran a hand through his own hair, looking a little like a kid.  That made Tony smile.  “In a goddamn prison,” Steve muttered.
“Yes, Ma’am.”
“I’m peachy, Dr. Banner,” he said.  “Fit as a fiddle.  Fine as paint.  Cunning as a cat a-running.  Did I miss any?”
“Captain Rogers?”
He fixed himself a cup, then took another mug out of the cupboard. He got out a spoon and sat it beside it. There was half and half in the fridge. They’d only had coffee together once, but Tony remembered how Sarah liked it. He had a good memory.
“I’m still having trouble with my left leg.  I’m doing all the exercises, but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping.”
Steve still saw it. Still felt it. Still responded to it.
Tony held him for a minute. Kissed him a few more times. Felt the reassuring beat of his heart against him, then said, “Okay, baby. Tell me about the walks.”
He didn't want to touch Tony with Ross' blood on his hands.
Tony laughed, and Steve thought he was still at least mostly asleep. “No, honey. I'm never going to leave you.”
Tony tore his gaze away from Steve. He shook his head a little, unconsciously. “Huh?”
Steve nodded and held him tighter. “I wanted you, too. I’ve been wanting you for three weeks.”
“I miss you, too.”
“You saved his life,” she said flatly, and grasped his hand again.  “I was going to let him die, and you saved him.”
-eleven. He took them outside when he was done writing. He lit a cigarette with his lighter, then touched the flame to the edge of the paper, watching it consume his words, his desire, his love with its cleansing fire, erasing them until the next time.
“Me too.”  He smiled at Steve, then looked at Tony seriously.  “We’ll talk to you tomorrow, Tony.”
Steve’s frown deepened.
"Fuck you, Stark," he said.
A wave of happiness rolled over him, and he wanted to say yes. He wanted to take her with him, and walk around the block with her, holding her hand while Dodger walked ahead of them. Wanted to listen to her laugh and chatter. Wanted to stop and buy her a hot chocolate on the way back home, and bring a cup of coffee for Tony, and take it to him in bed, but...no. No. He shouldn’t do that. He knew he shouldn’t. Not yet, anyway. “Um. I’m not sure if Tony would like it if I took you outside so early in the morning,” he said. “Especially in your pjs.”
mean he was sad or secretly relieved that Tony wouldn’t be there? Was that a genuine frowny-face? Or did Steve just put it in there for show? And that ellipsis...What the hell? Who put an ellipsis at the end of a text? Was Steve trying to fuck with him? What did that
“No,” Steve answered, troubled.  “No, but knowing it and...you know...having it happen for real are two different things.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he said miserably.
, the wedding, the vows, all of it, you know I’m down.”
Steve tightened his grip on Tony, sunk his head into his hair.  “It’s just for a couple days.  We’ll be okay, won’t we?”
Fury had said.
After awhile, Tony stood up.  “Sure you don’t want to go to Tahiti?” he asked.
“Yeah,” he said, but now he was nervous. Tony sounded a little doubtful. “They have this thing where you can pet the stingrays.” He bit his lip and put his hand on Dodger’s head, scritching him behind the ear, drawing a little comfort from that simple touch. “Does...does Morgan like stingrays?”
“That’s right, baby,” he said, then cocked an eyebrow, letting his eyes drift down Steve’s naked form. “And, um...about that. How would you feel about wearing a cheerleader outfit at some point?”
“I can get dressed,” she said, scrubbing her eyes with the hand holding the shark. They were still glassy with sleep. “I’m really fast.”
“Yeah.”
“No, sir. That’s not necessary.”
Steve smiled at him, brushed his fingers across his cheek like he'd done with Morgan. Tony hated how disappointed and resigned that smile was. He appreciated the fact that it was there, though. He really did. “Happy birthday."
was. He’d told Tony he knew it was pathetic. He still knew.

Steve jumped to his feet.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed.  “I do.  I know I do.  But I don’t have

tears that threatened again.
he had placed in Tony's hands to do with what he would.
Steve nodded curtly. “Then I want you with me.”
Tony started to hang up when he heard Strange’s voice say his name again.  “What’s that, Doc?”
“I never wanted that for you.”
“Don’t worry,” Steve said, his hand straying to the button of Tony’s jeans. “I’ve got you.”
But not surprised.
“‘Course I-”
Steve ran a hand through his own hair. He was nervous and shy, but god, that look in Tony’s eye gave him courage. Just like it always had. Like it had been doing since the day they met all those years ago as two lonely kids looking for that one person who could complete them. “Then we’ll see.”
“Hmm?”
Steve shoved his hands into his pockets.  He didn’t want to talk to it.
“Hey!” Steve squawked, and stumbled toward the edge.
“Baby, no-”
Steve touched the arc reactor, running his fingers over the soft blue glow.  “And you brought me back.”
Need and desire burned through him. He wanted it. Everything that Tony was offering, he wanted to take. And take. And take. As many times as Tony would let him. As many times as they could. But his brain held him back for a moment. Like a movie playing behind his eyes, it showed him what tomorrow would look like. The early morning sun lighting on Tony’s bare skin. Steve kissing his shoulder blade before crawling out of bed and dragging his clothes back on. Saying good-bye. Or not. It would be easier if he didn’t. It would be easier if he just left, closing the door behind him, taking a cab, waiting for the plane. He’d planned on doing all those things in the morning anyway, but could he do it if he and Tony spent the night together? He could. Of course he could. But it would be harder. Harder to leave. Harder to get on that plane with the knowledge of how Tony tasted so fresh in his mind.
“Hey, thanks,” Cap said. “Think that did it.”
Iron Man does his little head dip again. “I think the old tin can will hold up a bit better than your costume, darling.”
, as I think should be obvious.”
He can hear Tony rattling around in his bathroom. Probably he should be worried about that, but he can’t work up the ability to worry about much of anything at the moment. He’s not tracking time very well. After a while Tony comes back. Steve turns his head to the side to look at him, but otherwise doesn’t move.
He picks up the first plate, fumbles with the flexistraw until he has it unfurled correctly. The water is way too warm and tastes of plastic—he’s going to have to heat-test the pouches for BPA leakage when they get home—assuming they get home—but he stays with it, slow and steady, and by the time he’s sucked the entire thing down he feels somewhat better. He’s still dripping sweat, the boots still feel like they’re five times heavier than they should be, his forearms feel slimy in the confines of the gauntlets, his skin stings with what he is positive will be a truly hellacious sunburn in due time, and he would have a headache if Extremis wasn’t holding it off. But he can focus again.
“Wha’s a vogsec?” Cap asks, straw clamped in the corner of his mouth.
“I’m all right,” Steve says. He tugs at the flaps of his jacket. “A bit bruised from the mission, but that’ll be gone by morning. If I looked stiff, it was probably just this get-up.”
ah, jeez
The repulsor beam just sort of… splashed. He stared, momentarily stunned. That was
“Great,” Tony said.
“Then I’m sure when I see the bespoke suit of Captain America’s dreams, I’ll have the pleasure of knowing it was well worth my money.” Tony pats him on the shoulder, hand still heavy in the gauntlet. “Go wash up, we don’t want to be late and risk Jan coming after us with a stinger.”
“Gettin’ pretty close in here, Shellhead,” Cap rasps.
Cap had been up in the bow for a while, shouting back whenever Tony managed to connect a cable that caused something on the target screen to light up. If Tony is wrong about this—which is a possibility, he certainly does not read Vog’ilan writing—then they’re screwed. He doesn’t
Tony wants to sink his teeth into it.
“I’m sorry. I feel like I didn’t… I wasn’t doing much.”
“That’s not going to be an issue,” Steve mutters, turning his face back into his arms. “Can you just—”
He plugs one of the purple cables into the port on the back of his gauntlet, looks over at the forward console. Nothing. Goddammit. He suppresses the groan of frustration; that doesn’t help anyone right now. He’s feeling good about the purples in this panel, just gotta try the next one. And the next, and the next.
He turns back to the panel with renewed determination. Nobody who looks like that should die of incineration in an alien star with only Tony Stark for company, it’s just not right. He’s got a solemn duty to the universe to preserve this person, ideally in a shirtless state. He cuts one more quick look back over his shoulder. For inspiration and all that. “Sweaty’s a good look, you know, some people pay money for that. I’ve been reliably informed there are entire websites dedicated to versions of the look you’ve got going on right now.”
Tony chuckles delightedly. “Oh, darling, you certainly
“Don’t
The drive isn’t getting any power and they’re falling into the gravitational well of the nearest star. A procedure that can be classed as ‘time-consuming’ is not so helpful at the moment. Time consumed by the methodical testing of alien power connections is time that ideally would have been spent flying the fuck away from the giant sun that now fills the windows with a ferocious light.
“I didn’t turn any fucking thing on. You can feel gravity because we’re caught in a new gravitational field. The biggest gravitational field going in this part of space.” Cap stared blankly at him. Tony flipped up the faceplate, holding out some vain hope that his expression would better convey to Cap the seriousness of the issue. “We’re falling towards the sun.”
Finally he gets a hit on a wire that’s live on the right system. He plugs it into the gauntlet, turns to the console, and sees the powered flight system—or at least the system that was definitely active back when the ship was moving in a controlled way-- flicker. It dies back down immediately, but that’s fine, totally to be expected, it’s not like he thinks any of the ship’s main systems are going to run off an ancillary gauntlet power supply. He’s just trying to see which cables feed into the systems he wants to activate.
Stupid.
Steve’s brain informs him, unhelpfully, before apparently signing off. He’s suddenly kissing Tony, for real, and his grip tightens at Tony’s waist, probably wrinkling Tony’s jacket. He sinks his other hand into Tony’s hair, stiff with whatever Tony puts in there to style it, breaking apart to thick silky softness as he runs his fingers through it. Tony pushes his body up against Steve, hands falling from Steve’s face to deftly undo the bowtie that Steve is still wearing.
“Thought you liked. My dense ass.”
Steve bites down on one of his forearms. It’s been too long. It’s too much, he’s going to split apart, he can’t do this. A hand slides up to the space between his shoulder blades, rubs firm circles there. “Breathe,” Tony says. Steve takes a shuddering, unsteady breath. “There you go. Come on. In and out, nice and easy.”
“Just one of the many amazing discoveries I’ve made on this day,” Tony sighs. He flexes his fingers inside the gauntlets and drags his feet the few steps it takes to get back to the chestplate.
“Hey, Winghead, can we talk for a sec?” Tony asks.  Steve nods, not quite trusting his voice.
, though… well, I guess you need the super soldier shoulders to balance them out. Us mere mortals will have to make do with more modern tailoring.”
Tony’s hips hitch, sinking him deeper. The slight tremor in his body, which Steve can feel against the sensitive skin of his inner thighs, spread wide to accommodate him, says that Tony is still holding himself back. “Ok?” Tony pants. “Relax. Relax. You feel amazing, fuck, but you gotta relax, ok, let me in.”
The click-click-click of the Vog’ila’s hooves as it moved into the hangar was unhurried. The bastard thing probably figured they didn’t have anywhere to go, so it wasn’t in any great rush. Tony zoomed in on a tiny panel on the side of the ship. Whatever the hull was made of didn’t do much to attenuate x-ray radiation—he wondered if maybe irradiation wasn’t a problem for the Vog’ila the way it was for humans; certainly any human-built space-faring vessel was going to have a shit ton of radiation shielding—so he was able to peer into the opaque surface at least a little distance to see the structures and conduits underneath. He very carefully replaced the bit on his finger with a smaller one, slapped some targeting sights onto his HUD, and started to drill through.
Steve can’t think. The day’s activities began with him getting thrown into a New York cab by a gigantic centipede, and he’s barely had a moment to sit down since then. The only thought in his head right now is how good Tony looks, and how good Tony smells, and how much better he would smell if Steve got his nose right up into the carefully tousled hair at Tony’s temple. He shouldn’t do that. There are very good and compelling reasons why he shouldn’t do that, but right now he just can’t think of what they might be. His eyes drift shut as he nuzzles the side of Tony’s head. His lips brush against Tony’s cheek in a way he can almost tell himself is accidental.
“I’m sure, Cap,” he said, shifting the timbres on the helmet’s vocal filter so it had less of an electrical-buzz undertone, more organic than usual. Playing to Cap’s outdated sensibilities, but he’d never been above that kind of cheat. “I’m in a literal suit of armor, I’ll be fine. Just try to lead them off a little so they aren’t shooting so much in my direction.” He felt a solid click reverberate down the gauntlet as something small and mechanical inside the ship slid into place. “Don’t go too far though, you’ll need to get back here pretty quick once I get this thing started.”
“Have you ever, in your life, driven a Toyota Corolla?”
gala is raising money for the Maria Stark Foundation, which will do a lot more good out in the world than war bonds ever did. It’s just that he’d like a bit more time to let the adrenaline burn out of his system first.
, this is a
Cap chuckles briefly, winding something—fabric, Tony processes, a wide folded-over strip of fabric—around Tony’s head, pushing it up a little so it sits on his hairline, holding his (wet, gross) hair back away from his face, absorbing some of his sweat. Cap’s big hands are all over the back of Tony’s neck as he knots the fabric, then ghost briefly over Tony’s temples as Cap runs his fingers over him. Checking the fit, probably making sure it’s not too tight, some distant part of Tony’s brain supplies. The rest of his brain is busy screaming, obsessively cataloging the sensations like he’s never had someone else’s hands on his face or in his hair before. Which is just. Patently untrue.
“Furtive fumblings in the tents and trenches, hm? The dark of night, a helping hand…” Tony trails off, smiling reassuringly. “It’s all right, Steve. I get it. But if it’s all the same to you, I
He can’t quite tell what the cables are made of, but there is for sure something insulating on the outside and something conductive on the inside, so for now he’s assuming he knows enough to at least attempt to work with them. There are groups of cables bundled together in what looks like a pretty rigorous form of cable management, and the cables are definitely color-coded. He just doesn’t know what any of the groupings or colors
“Hang on,” Cap says. “Don’t startle. I’m coming up behind you, here—” There’s a tearing sound, and then Cap’s hands are at Tony’s brow, gentle for all their size. Tony freezes in place.
“Don’t need them,” Steve mumbles.
Tony knew he should back into the ship, get out of the way to clear the hatch for Cap, but he couldn’t resist another couple seconds of watching that crazy bastard, grinning to beat the band, running back to him.
Tony slowly unbuckles his belt. “Do you want more than
It’s been a long time. It’s been years, or decades depending on how he’s counting, and it’s never been this luxurious: fully undressed, sprawled out on a real bed, with plenty of lubrication to ease the way and seemingly all the time in the world. It feels better, it feels
They cruised on, silent for a time while Cap breathed in the slow deliberate manner of someone trying to fight down nausea and Tony tried to make sense of the limited data Extremis was feeding him. The plasma engine was basically okay, far as he could tell, and he thought that they probably had plenty of fuel. But the headache-y power draw feeling continued. It was definitely excessive at this point; they were well clear of the planet, there wasn’t any need for the engines to be working even a third as hard as they had been in atmo, but they were still drawing power like they were at full throttle. He reached out carefully and swiped across the control panel to flip it to a different screen; he’d figured out that much, at least. The new screen wasn’t any more comprehensible than the old one had been.
The doors behind him closed and he quickly smacked one of the buttons to turn the glass that he was staring through into completely opaque blinds. Tony jumped to his feet and looked behind him, still jumpy with his eyes darting behind him to look at whoever decided to waltz in.
I would stare at that bottle that sat by the corner for hours on end, watching the sun as it moves position, reflecting the light through the bottle and creating rainbows on my dark wooden desk. Refraction, I would think to myself, whereas I know most others would take the gleaming bottle edge as a sign to take another sip, but it’s been a long time. After attending AA meetings and holding that sobriety chip in my hand I’ve felt much stronger. I don’t even know why I keep those things in my office, probably because the crystal of the sherry bottle attracts other entrepreneurs or corporate big-wigs and encourages conversation. The bottle belonged to my father, and it’s one of the few things of his that I actually kept in my office.
“It’s not an obligation!” Tony quickly snapped. “It’s something I want to do, and I get to learn more about you in the process, exchanging info, isn’t that a fair trade? If you don’t like what I have to tell you then SHIELD won’t force you to work with us, if you do, then we can help you.”
Steve’s azure orbs did exactly the same as Tony’s light browns did; they widened, stretched open as they caught sight of the mansion. Tony’s slow pace switched to a sprint as he darted toward the gates, his hands wrapping around the signature gold they were painted with. He pulled away from Steve at that single moment, just to stare in pure horror at the Avengers mansion that was still ablaze. Dark smoke flew from the rooftop, shards of glass were scattered across the lawn, bricks that once built the mansion were now piles of broken slabs.
“Everything I expected it to be… Tony.” He cooed happily, feeling the man bundle close, the flutter of eyelashes a clear indication of Tony’s need for rest. “You’ve earned this…” Steve replied, proudly, thinking about the pursuit and perils that he had gone through to get where he was at that moment. And after years they were now together with Tony resting in the arms of his guardian angel, though at that moment it was Steve that was cradling his knight in shining armour. Their legs tangled together, and even though Tony couldn’t feel the real heat of Steve’s body from one side, at least he knew he was there and that was enough. There was a click of metal as their legs tangled, and Tony felt the cold brush of the other against his real leg, it made him let out a hum. Then they laced their fingers together, both metallic and real in perfect harmony.
“What on Earth? Don’t we have a backup generator?”
“Steve, holy—Steve!”
“Steve, I’m sorry… I had to, I… This is my fault…”
Doom sidestepped the blast, but his statue wasn’t so lucky and crumbled with a loud clatter.
Reluctantly he pulled back – remembering what had happened to Tony’s arm.
“We advise all citizens to stay indoors and turn off all electronic devices.
“The explosion killed them.”
“Sorry. Well, if it helps any, yours looks cooler than any I’ve seen, and I’ve seen loads on the market. Everyone wants one nowadays.”
“Yeah?”
The man raised the red gauntlet that began to charge with a recognisable high pitched noise, though it wasn’t pointed at Tony or Peter, it was pointed at Carol.
“Got it Cap, we’ll get you out of there, too.”
He could hear voices and shuffling and made his way up, though finding the marbled staircase a task in itself. He pulled himself up step after step, unable to walk up the spiral, ending up on his fours and climbing with Tony following close by.  When they had finally made their way up the stairs they spotted the door was open, someone had just rushed out. Steve ran out eagerly and snarled when the sun hit his skin but carried on walking to the gate of the mansion. It had been his first breath of fresh air in days.
Steve’s vision focused after moments of his world being reduced to a hazy blur, and he made out Tony against that blur. Just as Tony was about to touch him Steve shook his head and coughed out, vomiting out a large black spew of liquid that trickled down his chin, colouring his bottom lip grey.
“Steve!” He cried. “Steve, oh Steve. Captain… Love… Darling!” A flurry of muddled words poured from his mouth as his body was filled with the deep heat of Steve lighting a flame inside him.
The little boy continued to repeat his pleas whilst he moved under his bed, hiding there.
Hank and T’challa both nodded in agreement while they went to get the samples and try their best to replicate them. Tony recalled why exactly he hated this; Steve was extremely protective over his blood, it had the secret to the serum in it. He had been captured and tortured for the serum, having had his blood extracted, the serum being replicated but never to the potential degree that Steve’s was, it was inexplicable. Regardless, Tony followed the others and observed carefully as they began to try and formulate more of Steve’s blood for a transfusion.
“It won’t take long; JARVIS can usually handle systems like this in a cinch!” Tony reassured him. “Trust me Steve; I want to get Reed back to safety as much as you want to.”
“Where are the others that are supposed to live here?”
“My throws are always perfect,” he replied with an air that resembled cockiness.
Steve stood defiant to complete submission, but replied with a comfortable grin that could be interpreted as psychotic as he too leaned closer to the veneer. “Do you want to pass up on a valuable asset? That is my question in return, Tony.”
“Rest, yeah, that’s right.” Tony nervously stuttered, trying to lead Steve over to the mattress they had lain out the night before for him and making sure he was placed upon it. “You rest, sleep, get some sleep.”
“Go go Stark blacklight!” He commanded, but instead of a blacklight a huge chalkboard popped up and unfolded from his hat. “No no, not black BOARD, black LIGHT!”
Tony’s boots flickered whilst he was in the air, his air time vastly decreasing just before they shorted out. “Go go Stark fantastic-arms!” He stretched his hands out, trying to reach the bumper of the car but they didn’t extent to a normal length, no it was far beyond that. They extended with mechanical tubing stretching out to allow Tony to grab onto the bumper, just as he wanted. But oh no, it wasn’t
“You walked straight into this one…”
As he was about to hit the ground he felt a metallic thud against him, had he fallen toward a building instead? Another metallic clang and screech and he meekly opened his eyes to behold what the commotion was about.
Steve was getting used to the brand new cybernetic augmentations Tony created for him. The genius was fascinated with the bond that was created between the two by using a single drone’s parts, so instead of destroying it completely, as he had intended, he ended up modifying it and maintaining the core. There was no way he wanted to severe the connection between the two after they had gained something so strong, and become even better than before. Tony built on top of the legs, enhancing their capabilities too, and creating an even stronger bond between them. Besides, Tony wanted a candy apple red arm, and he’d managed to get that, giving Steve a patriotic red and blue paint job. But the best part? The cloaking devices. With a flip of a button the augmentations blended in and appeared as though they were normal limbs, which helped Steve with the adjustment process.
Slowly, Tony pulled back and opened his sapphire blue eyes, staring up at Steve with intense curiosity and wondering himself whether he would be awoken by the sound of the others barking at him to wake up, or Pepper scolding him due to being late to yet another meeting.
“What do you mean it’s shut my body down?” Steve’s eyebrows furrowed.
“I… It was…” Always flustered after doing anything remotely expressive, Steve took in a deep breath as he tried to calm himself down.  “… A kiss?”
Tony glared just for a second and mumbled to himself, “My tech isn’t shoddy.”
The Captain continued to stare out of the window. “It’s… Surreal.”
“Spider sense. Carol, look ou-!” By the time he spat out his last word, reaching up his hand, the webbing ripped open completely. An army of these entranced people, foaming at the mouth, reached toward Carol and Jessica, mobbing them.
the convincing one, I’m sure. Wait, do you smell that?”  Clint stopped in the hallway, turning his head. “We need to see where that explosion came from.”
“Tony..!” Steve hit the glass. “Tony wait!”
“So you’ve actually been behaving; why do I find that hard to believe?” he asked, cutting the wire that he needed to and then taking his time to hear more of the story.
“That’s it, keep going.” He groaned, shoulders shifting at the light tease of a touch.
He looked around, turning from side to side and then getting to his feet quietly, as to not disturb the sleeping boy. As carefully as he could he tip toed toward the door and craned his neck out, only to be greeted by a red gloved hand that wrapped around his neck and threw him back into the wall of the corridor with a heavy smack. He wretched in pain, coughing.
Steve’s body twitched and he pushed himself into the kiss. Tony made a small murmur beneath it with surprise, and then he felt a sharp pain along his lip. Flinching a little he tried to pull back, but Steve grabbed the back of his head and kept him in place. Tony made another sound of discomfort.
Steve stepped through the door in his bright blue shirt accessorised with a custom tie that he was given to match his shield, a gift from Carol, looking rather dapper even without the dark blue blazer that he was wearing earlier that evening. “I know, I know.”
Steve continued to hold onto him, regardless. There was something comforting about it, not only for Steve but for Tony too, as they both cautiously stepped closer and closer to the doorway at the end of the hallway; it was clear where they were heading, the only door that had a light behind it. There were many doors but all of them seemed so stoic, so devoid of life, so there only seemed to be one option.  They had to run down the hallway, then down the stairs at the end of it, with Tony scooping Jarvis into his arms to carry him down while they made their way down. Tony hated walking down stairs, particularly if there were that many of them, so he grabbed Steve too, yanking him as he shouted;
“I won’t hurt him..! He’s the only… The only friend I have here!” Steve wriggled in the restraints, watching as the suit diverted its attention to the countdown clock that flashed up on the giant blue monitors that were already lit up, blue backgrounds with white numbers, ticking down second by second.
Steve breathed out at the sensation of the tight muscle wrapped around him and the extreme heat of Tony’s body, making sure Tony’s legs were resting on his shoulders as he began to glide his hips to start to move.
“And just know I’m watching over you, my hero.” He replied, “This... This wasn’t your fault, you didn’t kill me, you didn’t intend for this to happen.”
Again, processing the information; Doom had been a possible culprit, but if that wasn’t the case now, then who else? A register ran through his head, but he couldn’t think of anyone that was this capable of doing such a thing, or a motive behind it.
Hank shot her a glare. “Don’t say that, we just finished dealing with him. I would much rather go without the huge amount of damage he had done to the city…” Besides, Hank wasn’t too keen on working side by side with Reed all the time. Whilst he did appreciate his genius from time to time, he knew being around him for prolonged periods of time would be infuriating. As much as he admired his dedication to the cause, the gist of it was that Reed could be rather oblivious and would often forget that there were others in the lab alongside him, attempting to help.
He hadn’t heard that thick of an Australian accent since his time at war, and even so, it was a rare occurrence. The guy stood in purple and blue, with boomerangs in either hand, leering at Steve as he approached.
It was clear by the frantic typing and the way that the white-coats gathered around the screen that something was clearly the matter. Their conference was quite abruptly interrupted by an ever so curious Nick Fury Jr.
Steve was the only man who could touch Tony like that, the only man who Tony would allow to do that, especially after what Howard had done to him as a child, he was almost afraid of men of authority after that.
“It had to be perfect, today especially.” Steve says as he takes a step in front of the tree, crouching down and searching for something small.
There they lay in a broken down hospital, in the ruins of one, which was probably the least romantic setting for their first time. Nonetheless, in Tony’s eyes it couldn’t have been more perfect. Steve placed a series of tender kisses to Tony’s forehead, brushing away the strands that stuck to his skin, then rubbed his arms tenderly along his shoulder blades. Tony purred like a content kitten, kissing the centre of Steve’s reactor appreciatively.
This was his era. This was Tony Stark’s future.
Tony’s eyes returned to the man in the box. Steve clutched his stomach again, curled up by his mattress in the same position that Tony had just found him in the second that he had walked in. It was as though the food that he had just given him had no effect, but at least it was promoting Steve to move a little. Lately he hadn’t been moving as much, though Tony didn’t blame him entirely for that. Being stuck and trapped in a small room may have made him feel more claustrophobic than ever. Within this last day Steve had taken a shower, which was progress, and had an inexplicable violent outburst that resulted in some injuries along his hand, and yet no bleeding at all.
The alarms in the house began to sound and both Tony and Steve turned their heads in tandem toward the speaker, Steve hobbling toward it with Tony clutching Steve’s arm at the time as he reached for the speaker, or tried to, realising it was too high up.
Tony reached down, grabbing Steve by the collar, but was quickly kicked back when Steve lashed out. Not that Tony could contain a strong grip even with his suit, one arm wasn’t enough to keep Steve pinned. Steve bolted for the railings, but Tony flew after him – tackling his body in the way a football player would – going right for his abdomen and keeping up the momentum as he smashed him through the pane of glass and out into the courtyard of the factory, shards of glass flying everywhere.
“You know why you’ll never build anything like me, Stark? Because you won’t be able to. Not any more, I won’t have you getting in my way ever again.” Hammer growled, so angry that spittle flew clumsily through the air with each word he spat ferociously.
“Now that’s better thinking.” Tony climbed on top of Steve’s shoulders and pushed the ventilation hatch off the elevator ceiling, pulling his body up and reaching down for Steve. “Take my hand!”
“You mean my right?”
“It’ll be better. You know why?”
“Today is the day I ask you to marry me.”
Christmas had approached quickly, looming upon a particular group of superheroes that day. It all began when the dark haired genius more commonly known as Tony Stark was waking up that morning. He groans and yawns wide enough that a plane could’ve flown through his mouth. Okay, maybe a plane was an exaggeration, but it was a pretty big yawn.
Clint asked, trying to lean closer to Janet to get the gossip. “Huh?”
“What? That’s impossible.” Tony’s mind was frantic, looking at the mess around him. He didn’t know where to start, and now Reed was missing too. “He can’t be alive.”
The new HQ for the Avengers was spectacular. It was something that the team had spent months building the tower from the remnants of the mansion and adding so much more.building and perfecting by themselves, building their own new home together. It was a tall, beautiful white tower with the signature ‘A’ branding the front of it near the top. It was so large that it felt as though it were piercing the heavens, but boy, was it a sight. Everyone in the city marvelled at how beautiful the structure was, given that it looked far more modern and sleek than your run of the mill office complex.
Right now it felt as though Steve’s heart was on cloud nine. It beat quickly, his cheeks already flushed as it was – thankfully the cold air cooled them a little, and the dim light of the street gave him some shade to hide beneath. Even if this was just a friendly gesture Steve appreciated it from the bottom of his heart. He was scared to get close to partners after losing his own, but this one was something really special, and he was very perceptive – noticing his love for the star design. It was more symbolic than anything; Tony had given him a star, which was probably why Tony was a detective in the first place, because he was sharp and smart. But he could see by the way that the other man shifted, the way his hands buried in his pockets and his head tilting, that he was nervous.
That part of him was long gone.
Peter opened his eyes as soon as his spider sense sent a blur of colours through his vision, slipping his mask on and crouching on the bed.
“Keep running!” Steve shouted, hoping to find the main lab soon by darting into the elevator and leading the others there. Tony grabbed the doors and slammed them closed.
Finally, after all these years, he and Steve could cease their bickering and work together in harmony to bring forth the perfect world that Tony had envisioned. This was just the start.
Johnny Storm
“Tony!”
When they’d reached the foot of the huge tower with Stark written on it, it all fell into place. Here Steve had thought that it was simply just a common name, given that he didn’t do much research into it. He wasn’t too into doing research about big businesses and companies when he was too focused on crime-busting. He actually cursed himself for not putting it together.
“I’ll love you until I die, and beyond that. Stay strong. –S Rogers.” It read, it was definitely Steve’s handwriting, that distinct messy scribble. He placed the paper to his nose and low and behold, it even smelled of him. He held the letter close to his glowing reactor that seemed to be glowing even brighter after he had found the letter.
“So basically your body’s systems have completely shut down, but the serum is helping them a little, well, it’s helping the blood flow through your body but it’s also pumping a bad toxin through it too. We have to find a way to get this toxin out of your body before it starts infecting anyone else.”
“Wings?” Tony scoffed, “What wings?”
“Tony..?” He whispered, skimming his metal fingertips over the man’s face. From the corner of his eyes, he caught the reactor with no light, and then he focused on the man himself. He couldn’t even breathe. He just stared at him. “Tony…” He whispered over and over, searching for a reply. His lips were moving but not a sound escaped them, mouthing Tony’s name and shaking his head as uncontrollably tears fell from his eyes, mixed with each drop of rain from above.
“That was just the first guy, and it was an easy fight…”
“I’m so… hungry…”  The very same whisper had been echoing through that confinement chamber since the attack. It haunted Tony’s sleeping state now...
He shook his head. “You’re my Captain, Steve. You understand me? Can you hear what I’m saying at least?”
“Try me!” Tony spat, his face plate folding up so he could stare eye to eye with the man who had killed Steve Rogers.
Fury muttered obscenities under his breath, directing his attention toward the press who stood there in anticipation, continuing to take pictures of the men that were stood there. Tony gave Fury a nudge of encouragement, that only enraged him further and he cleared his throat rather abruptly.
JARVIS barked again.
He was so needy and there was no denying it, but Steve was just the same. Years of built up tension and this was the result, hot, passionate lovemaking.
“I’m sure he’d love another reason to hate me,” Tony said, snorting disdainfully.
The clang of Steve’s dog tags was extremely pleasuring and Tony couldn’t quite explain why.
With Hammer down, it was time to deal with the puppeteer himself. The machine was huge, a mix of purple with purple crystals decorating the outside, and a range of wires all linked to the helmet that The Purple Man was donning. He stood with his arms out, head tilted back and glowing sparks of purple flying from his body.
“Humanity are the ones destroying the world, the minority are preserving it, with the assistance of technology. You’re outdated, Steve. ”
Steve stared in shock at the hologram that appeared before him and only him, hearing his voice. Everything looked so old, even Tony’s hair was much longer, and this was filmed in the days where he had only a moustache and not the signature goatee.
“Its fine Steve, I can do it.”
“That’s why we have help.” Carol stated, brushing off her blazer as she stood up and out of her car, gesturing behind her to the two men ushering the citizens to safety, one wearing a green bandana on his head looking rather stylish and the other in a uniform that was probably two sizes too small for him.
“Where are the others?” Steve asked while Vision floated toward Hank, lifting him into his arms and performing a scan.
Steve wasn’t going to mess around, not when he could hear the others approaching. He needed everything to be cleaned up by the time the others arrived to show that he and Tony were fully capable of handling the bigger cases. The leaper threw a punch, but Steve dodged to the left, ducking and then countering with a perfectly planted uppercut to his chin, sending him up to the sky. Batroc kicked his legs out, obviously using his best assets to take Steve out. Once more Steve punched Batroc’s right foot away whilst ducking under the left that flew above his head, tilting his body back and throwing his weight on the leaper which sent him crashing to the ground.
Tony tried to shake the image of Steve trying to actually bite him out of his head, closing his eyes just for a moment and trying to think of the few seconds prior to that, at least they were somewhat comforting. He could feel the tears swell, he could feel himself break down and fall to his knees – hitting the metal tiles under him. His wet skin touching the cold, making him shiver, but he was too distraught to even react to that. He had come to the realisation that his friends mind was being destroyed, as if the tests weren’t enough to prove that along with Steve obeying the one prevalent instinct he had; hunger.
be hunted down, stung, and dragged into the limo if need be.”
won’t take advantage. That trusting nature of yours is normally very commendable and noble and so on, but with things like this you need to be just a little bit selfish. Nobody’s going to look out for your well-being better than you.”
Steve takes a deep breath.
they were being pursued from behind, but there was at least some small chance that the way was clear up ahead.
It builds and builds. He’s distantly aware of his balls drawing up towards his body, of the muscles in his abdomen tensing, his legs going rigid, toes curling. Heat crashes over him and what feels like his entire body clenches down on Tony, buried deep inside. His last little shred of awareness is of his cock jerking in Tony’s hand, Tony’s fingers finally slipping out of their rhythm as Steve comes.
“I like the pants,” Steve mutters. “They’re a nice fit.”
“I haven’t done this—” Steve starts, brain struggling to re-engage. Tony’s eyes widen. “A lot! Or with the lights on!” Steve adds hastily. “I mean, it’s not like I made a habit of it. In the war, sometimes… well, there were times you needed something, just to feel good for a minute, you know? But it was always… there wasn’t… there wasn’t any
“Well, that’s something.” Cap shifted, sitting up a bit, then startled as his butt floated off the seat. He hastily adjusted to hook his ankles together under the chair. “This boat have artificial gravity?”
pull it off later if you like.”
… anywhere near me.” Wasp twists around, trying to see the back of her own suit. “I already got spattered when Thor hit it, and that’s burned
The cabin is already warm. It won’t be too long before it starts getting hot.
Steve shrugs one shoulder, not bothering to look up. He’s still feeling good, but he can sense embarrassment somewhere off in the distance, just waiting to ambush him. And is Tony really going to call things off? Now? Just because Steve doesn’t have any rubbers on him? “What’s it matter?”
The control panel flickered off. A loud sighing noise indicated that the engines had died completely.
The alarm blared at an actively painful octave, clearly not meant for human hearing. Tony had dialed it down to something less intrusive in the helmet’s internal speakers almost as soon as it started. It couldn’t be pleasant for Cap, though he didn’t show any sign of discomfort as they ran through the narrow, disturbingly high-ceilinged halls. The floor was hard and heavily textured, probably so the Vog’ila wouldn’t slip around on their clawed limbs; it generated a lot of disconcerting unfamiliar kinds of echoes and contributed to the weird soundscape.
Steve smiles sheepishly at him. “I went to your guy. He had me try a bunch of suits, but when I explained what I wanted, he told me that it was a custom job, and he’d have to bring in a specialty tailor for it. I said that sounded too expensive.”
Steve almost flies off the bed, choking on a noise halfway between a gasp and a shout. Tony laughs delightedly and kisses him, swallowing the follow-up sounds that spill out of Steve as he starts to stroke.
he upped the power, shot the door again. The beam splashed and dissipated again. There was maybe a slight discoloration to show where it had impacted the door, that was all. Holy fuck. Whatever that material was, it had some kind of energy deflection properties, he’d never seen anything even remotely like it, he could be looking at a brand-new element here—
Iron Man spins instantly in midair and fires a repulsor blast directly in front of Steve, just at the moment that Steve goes into a hip-slide, shield held up over his head. Iron Man’s blast hits the shield at the perfect angle and redirects into the centipede’s underside, scoring a deep mark in its carapace.
They ran down to the far end of the hangar, trying to put as much space and as many obstacles between themselves and the door as possible, skidding to a stop in front of a ship in the last row. Tony hit it with every scan he had.
Steve shivers at that. Tony’s smile turns satisfied. He skims his hands down the back of Steve’s head and rests them on the tops of his shoulders, then squeezes, digging his thumbs into the muscles above Steve’s collarbones. Steve can feel his back arching slightly into the pressure, pushing him into Tony’s grip. A delighted, calculating expression comes over Tony’s face, one Steve has seen most often when Tony is in the workshop: he’s taking in the results of a successful experiment, parsing them for usable data.
Tony strokes at the sides of Steve’s neck with his thumbs. The tension in Steve’s body eases promptly, like he’s a machine that Tony has programmed to respond to his touch. “You don’t have anything to prove—certainly not to
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.” Tony smiles—not his million-watt PR smile, but the smaller, warmer one he uses sometimes around the team. “I mean that. We could call it a night right here. Or we can do just what we’ve been doing—we can go on having a nice time without anything else coming off. Or—” He pauses and thumbs open the top button of his own waistcoat, looking Steve right in the eyes—“well, or everything else is on the table, so to speak. This can go as far as you’re comfortable with it going.”
“This is drawing a lot more energy than I expected,” he explained. “Launch seems really—
anything. I
“Did I—” Tony shakes a wadded-up washcloth at him. “What do you think I was wiping out of you just now, an ice cream float?”
“Sorry. Nice save, Shellhead.” Steve sheepishly rubs the back of his neck. Iron Man dips his helmet in the little gesture he uses in the field in place of a grin and pats Steve on—well, not squarely on the butt, but awfully close to it.
“Believe in the scientific method,” Tony suggests, and drops a gauntleted finger down onto the control panel.
The metal—or metalloid, or whatever it was—scratched under the bit. Thank fuck. OK. Now he needed to locate the locking mechanism, or some portion of it. Hopefully there was a locking mechanism. If the door was friction-fit… well, maybe he could disrupt the seal by drilling at one edge? But a locking mechanism would be a faster way through. The door was smooth and featureless on their side, so no help on the visual landmark front. He ran his right gauntlet in a wide arc over it, listening to the ringing scrape of metal-on-metal.
He’s trying to conserve power. The reactor is the best battery they’re likely to get, and the only thing that stands even a remote chance of jump-starting the ship’s engine. So he’s got all the suit’s atmospheric controls turned off, which was tolerable at first, but has since become pretty intolerable. The heat is getting to be a problem.
“I’m very versatile, you know. Either side of the equation works well for me.” Tony draws his belt out of the beltloops, thumbs the fine-grained leather as though he’s thinking of doing something with it, then tosses it aside. He looks back at Steve while he undoes his fly. “Is that something you want to try tonight?” He stops, one hand holding his pants up; Steve sways forward for a second before he gets himself back under control. “It’s not necessary, Steve, I’m serious; there are plenty of ways to have a grand old time with two willing participants, and I’d say I’m pretty well-versed in most of them. But it is something I’d be willing—I’d be
Steve finally does roll his head to the side again, careful to not dislodge Tony’s hand. He squints up at Tony’s face. “Are you going to hurt me?”
ship, now—and slapped the patch over the hole, broadened his beam a little to tack the edges down, holding the sacrificial strip against the beam to use it as the universe’s most make-shift welding wire, then focused the repulsor again and lowered the power to weld a continuous seam all the way around. No gas, so the weld was nothing short of hideous, probably not half as strong as it needed to be, but it was the best he could do and it would hold. It would just… it would just have to hold.
Although, of course, Reed has more experience in outer space than Tony does. There is that.
, but he can’t quite tell what. Without really thinking about it, he leans in to smell it better. He puts a hand out to steady himself, then freezes. Tony is still lightly holding the lapels of Steve’s jacket; now Steve has a hand on Tony’s waist, and his nose is perilously close to Tony’s right temple.
Three Vog’ila were in the hangar, carefully picking their way around the room. Tony kept the suit pressed up as close to the curve of the hull as possible, and Cap stayed as close to his side as he could without getting in the way. The Vog’ila were making noise continuously—trills and low burbling sounds—but when one gave a single, loud

going on.”
eager. All right then. Just relax, let’s see whether or not I’ve totally torpedoed the mood.”
“S’good enough for me,” Steve says. “Are you going to—I mean, do I have to go down to the drugstore or something—”
“I guess it doesn’t matter, really,” Tony says, after a moment of silence. He rests a hand on the back of Steve’s head, then starts petting his hair, almost absently. “I get tested every doctor’s appointment, and I’m clean—there’s paperwork I could show you, which you should definitely insist on seeing—”
“Don’t be an idiot,” Tony snipes. The process of separating out a bundle of cables in this panel is delicate; they’re thinner than some of the others, and he doesn’t want to disconnect any of them, because he’ll never be able to figure out where they’re meant to go. His hands are steady as he pages through them, delicate as he can be while still wearing the gauntlets.
Steve and Wasp watch from a safe distance as Iron Man carefully approaches the enormous carcass. Wasp gasps when something erupts from the crater with a new spray of centipedal goo, and Iron Man makes a boot-jet-assisted hop that puts him a good twenty feet off the ground, but it’s only Thor standing up and shaking off his hammer.
“No, I… yeah. That’s good. I… me too.”
He almost stumbled at the sharp patter that rang out against the shield. One of the lanky assholes must have pulled far enough ahead of the pack to think it had a shot. Thank fuck they were using physical rounds for now; whatever they were made of hadn’t been able to get past vibranium. He knew they had some kind of energy weapons, wasn’t too keen to test the shield against those, but for whatever reason they hadn’t used them yet. Maybe they couldn’t be used inside the hallways. The narrowness of said hallways meant that Cap couldn’t throw his shield—well, he
“I don’t…” Cap blinks sluggishly at him. “I’ll be all right. Go on, you need it more.”
—” a pause while the ship jolted through an air pocket—“really resource-intensive.”
The ship shudders slightly. There are no air currents in space, so he’s just going to work real hard at not thinking about whatever that could have been. If his sketchy weld job is failing… or if they’re close enough to experience solar wind as a physical force, or if they’re anywhere near a coronal mass ejection event, he’s not sure they’re going to be able to fly out even if he does get the engine working. And wow, he
“OK, that one’s bad, even for you,” Steve laughs. His face is still hot, but amusement defuses the situation at least a little, and he needs all the help he can get. Tony can flirt with anyone and anything, in any situation, and the interaction will barely leave a ripple on the surface of his composure, but Steve has never quite managed that trick.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut and turns his face back into the cradle of his folded arms. “Not a problem,” he says, muffled. “I haven’t been… it’s not a problem.”
“I suppose I thought it was all joking.”
Cap be able to hold them off by himself with little more than bootstraps and gumption? They’re
“At least we’ve established that much.” Tony cradles the side of Steve’s face with one hand; Steve sighs and leans into it, letting his eyes drift half shut. “I’ve had a nice time so far. Everything—anything-- after this is a bonus. But I need to know what you want.”
No, he realized with a dawning horror, as he finally managed to pull up something recognizable on the control panel: a visual tracker, some kind of live map. The notation was still impenetrable, but the little pictograms were clear enough. One of them plainly represented the ship. One arc showed the planet falling away behind them. One much larger curve showed the next closest celestial body. The panel used green squiggly lines to represent a complex of curving marks around that celestial body. Tony was no astrophysicist, but he recognized the magnetic field pattern of a star easily enough. And he could see that the little ship icon was fully overlapping it.
“Not a chance!” Wasp shouts, buzzing in a frustrated little circle overhead. “I’m protecting the city, not doing your dirty work!” Steve looks at Iron Man, puzzled. Iron Man stares back impassively, then taps at the side of his helmet. Steve thumps the side of his own head, resettling the comm in his ear.
Cap grabs the back of the nearest seat with one hand and braces the other on Tony’s hip. That’s just smart, because Tony won’t be able to fly the ship if he falls over. He can barely feel the warmth of Cap’s hand over the heat inside the ship.
“Oh jeez, gross, Tony.” Steve covers his face with one hand.
“And that’s bad,” Cap ventured.
.” Tony gives him a lopsided little smile. “That said. If you’d like another round at some near-future date, I could probably accommodate you.”
The largest single piece of the suit is the chestplate. There’s no way to swap it out for something else; without it, the suit is useless as a controlled environment, useless as armor. Many of the other torso pieces attach to it directly, so without it much of the suit will be unwearable even if the other pieces are, separately, fine. Tony won’t be much good in a fight, and he’s forfeited his ability to exit the ship while they’re still outside a friendly atmosphere. Of course, if it comes to that, Cap won’t be in any better shape. Captain America is many things but ‘sealed against vacuum’ is not one of them.
Tony hooks his chin over a shoulder to glare at him. Cap has a disconcertingly good poker face, for all that he’s supposed to embody truth and openness and all that idealistic crap, and it’s sometimes hard to tell how much awareness he has when he’s being the world’s biggest little shit. Cap just looks back at him evenly, eye kind of squinted on the side closer to the ship’s forward window. Tony turns back to the mess of cabling with a huff.
The gauntlet skated over the door’s surface smoothly, then stuttered as he passed it over a spot near the right side of the door, about two feet above his head. A rough spot. A textured indicator, to tell a Vog’ila where to put its hand (frontal appendage) in order to open the door? Maybe. Maybe. But all he had to go on.
” Tony lets the full extent of his disgust and disdain bleed into his voice. He’s a much better engineer than Reed is: faster to adapt, better at the MacGuyver-style solution cobbled together from whatever’s around. He’s not paralyzed if he doesn’t have the exact perfect equipment for the job. Reed, fine, if you need a theoretical deep dive, or something done about alternate dimensions, maybe Reed is your guy, but in the field Tony is worth ten of him.
“You were saying?” Iron Man sets Steve neatly back on his feet some distance away from the freshly cratered sidewalk.
heard Cap just fine, the helmet now locked in on the alarm frequency well enough to filter it most of the way out. “Yeah, fuck, here—” He slowed slightly, letting Cap run right up on him so that he was in an awkward half-crouch, almost plastered against the back of the suit. Tony twisted from the waist, flung one arm out and fired off a few blasts down the hall over the top of Cap’s head. He could just about hear a squeal and the chaotic thumping of something very tall, with a whole lot of limbs, hitting the walls and the floor.
Could they be called claws if they didn’t seem to correspond to discrete fingers or toes? The Vog’ila had more of a complexly forked hoof situation going on with their lower 6 limbs, but of course it probably wasn’t quite right to call them hooves either. A hoof was a very specific kind of anatomical thing, he remembered reading that somewhere.
: something blunter than his fingers presses at Steve, a huge pressure that feels like it has nowhere to go, and then there’s a sharp pain and a sudden fullness. Steve yelps, muffled in the pillow, and jerks his hips up, which gives Tony the room to reach under him and stroke his flagging erection with an aloe-slicked hand.
He hasn’t perfectly parsed their numerical system yet, but he can tell that they were a number of vogsecs away from the surface of the sun, and now they are a slightly smaller number of vogsecs away. With enough time, he’ll crack the numbers; math is universal, after all, and he can see traces of it as he explores the panel’s screens. Language is harder, but if he can get the numbers down to start, they’ll be in great shape. You can run almost anyone’s tech once you know their math.
“That wasn’t what I…
“Oh, I don’t—” Steve starts, but Jan continues right into his personal space and envelopes his arm in a flurry of structured fabric and perfume. She must be using her powers; there’s no way a small gal like her could possibly hang so heavy on the crook of his elbow.
to do. Either way. Or not at all.”
something happens that you’re not 110% into,” Tony says, and wraps a hand around the base of Steve’s cock.
Christ, he hated running in the suit. Even with the hydraulic assist it was a slog. But there wasn’t room to carry Cap, and leaving him on his own to face down a squad of angry Vog’ila was just not an option, even if doing so meant Tony might get to the hangar, or what they were calling the hangar, a lot sooner. And maybe it would be better if he did, because he was going to have to hot-wire one of the little ships, and it wasn’t like there’d been a chance to study up on Vog’ila engineering before this shitshow of a mission. If he blasted on ahead, he could make a start on one, maybe have it ready to go by the time Cap got there…
He’s decided that the mysterious unit of measurement that keeps showing up on the map screen is referring to distance. He’s calling it a vogsec. He has absolutely no idea how it stacks up to feet or miles or AUs or parsecs, but he thinks, based on the scale of the map, that it’s closer to miles than anything else.
Steve can feel his cheeks heating up. “Tony. Knock it off, this is a classy event.”
Tony drops the bottle onto the bed and sits down next to Steve. “Darling, I hate that I apparently have to be the one to have this conversation with you, but you very much do need them.”
They came to a branch in the hall. “Left!” Tony gasped. When Cap didn’t respond, he took point; fine, Cap could cover his six if he wanted. A few steps down the left passageway he realized Cap probably couldn’t hear him, even with the comm-link. Nothing for it—the hall was too narrow for Cap to pass him now without stopping, turning the suit parallel to the walls, and letting Cap awkwardly scrape past him. They didn’t have time for that. It was probably better for Cap to bring up the rear anyway; they
“I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t an option,” Tony says reasonably. He removes his shirt and waistcoat together and gently tosses the bundle onto the chair with his jacket. Steve has seen the reactor before, but he’s never been able to look at it like
Of course, it wasn’t like he was only, or even primarily, a programmer. The Vog’ila engineering logic was unfamiliar too, and their materials science was foreign to him, but at the end of the day they were subject to the same constraints of physics that Earth was, and there were only so many ways to make a thing move, not move, or go really fast that didn’t violate the physical constants of the universe.
won’t, that doesn’t mean someone
The surface of the sun fills the forward view with a terrible yellow-white light, so intense that it’s almost tangible. Tony’s usually not all that aware of his skin as a boundary between himself and the outside world, but now it feels as if the light is pushing against every centimeter of that boundary, like it’s trying to seep in through his pores. He has to stay here, this is where there’s work to be done, but there’s nothing for Cap to do. He could move deeper into the ship, farther from the window, try to find something that will at least block the light a little, even if it’s unlikely any part of the ship will actually be any cooler in temperature.
The first Vog’ila burst through the door, body held almost horizontal with its 6 legs splayed out momentarily as it brought itself up short. When it straightened, its head was a good 9 or 10 feet off the ground. Its light-sensing eyes, clustered around the top of its head, squinted in the relative brightness of the hangar; the four main eyes lower down rolled in different directions as it tried to locate them. Tony hunkered and let Cap cover them both with the shield; no sense in presenting a super obvious target until they absolutely had to. He hadn’t gotten a good enough look to tell if it was holding one the physical ammunition weapons or one of the energy guns, but he was hoping and assuming that Cap had and was planning accordingly.
Cap glanced at him, a tortured expression on his face. He so obviously wanted to run out and fight, but he was battling with his innate desire to coddle a baseline teammate. Even though Tony wasn’t technically baseline any more. Even though anyone in their line of work basically gave up all right to or expectation of coddling. They’d been down this road a million times before; it was one of the many things they’d fought over that led to the current state of Tony-sans-Avengers and Avengers-sans-Tony. There was a Vog’ila clattering down the rows of ships towards them, though, so: not the time. “Go, hit them all you want, don’t be a hero, just get me enough time to figure this out.”
In the forward windows, orange streaks of flame and wisps of ice-white started to give way to the deep black of space. “We’re clearing the atmospheric envelope now, actually.” There was a very slight whine as his shock absorbers eased off to match the reduction in pressure.
“Fantastic.” Tony steps back and starts unbuttoning his waistcoat in earnest. “Do you want there to be mutual touching?”
“I only stayed behind because you all
“If you distract me from figuring out this ship’s drive and we plunge into the sun as a result, that can be your fault,” Tony grits out from between clenched teeth, which he thinks is a very magnanimous concession under the circumstances.
“Modern’s… all right,” Steve says. Instead of breaking at the tops of his shoes, Tony’s trouser legs end just above the ankles, showing off his violently red silk socks. His jacket has a brilliant crimson lining to match, and its hem falls neatly at the waist: no tails for him. His lapels are neither notched nor peaked, a clean unbroken line all the way around instead. His waistcoat—white, with an expensive-looking white brocade all over—is so close-fitting that it’s hard to imagine there’s any other fabric underneath. His bowtie is undone, the black silk flags hanging out of his collar, which has also been opened, shirt unbuttoned to the top of the waistcoat. Steve can just about see the top of the reactor, and more light spills out when Tony leans forward to preen under what he has accurately determined is Steve’s regard.
Tony wrinkles his nose in disapproval, but moves on to unbuttoning the rest of his shirt. “Do you want more than that? Do you want my mouth on you?”
Steve shoots Tony a panicked, wide-eyed look, but Tony just grins at him and winks.
“Oh, you’re doing it right. It’s just that your version of ‘right’ apparently crystallized in, what, the 1920s? The ‘30s?” Tony sidles a little closer and pinches the edge of one of Steve’s jacket tails between his thumb and forefinger, rubbing the fabric thoughtfully. “Tails are a white tie thing, these days. And those loose-cut pants…”
“But I didn’t even… Did you—did you, um.” He blushes harder. Tony raises an eyebrow, but waits patiently. “Finish?”
Carefully, experimentally, he braces his knees against the bed and shifts his hips. The fullness inside him shifts with the motion, and he jostles Tony’s hand where it still loosely grasps his cock; he can’t help the moan that punches out. Tony’s hand tightens in response. He braces his free hand on the bed and starts to move in earnest, draped over and in Steve, breath hot on his back. It takes just a couple thrusts for Steve to catch and match his cadence, rocking back into Tony with what little leverage he can manage. That encourages Tony to speed up, go harder, and once he has a good rhythm going he doesn’t hesitate. Soon enough he’s pounding into Steve, and working Steve’s cock with an expert, practiced touch, even though the angle must be awkward.
I’m not sure of.”
,” Wasp says, landing just beyond Steve and sizing back up as soon as her boots touch the ground. She runs her hands down the sides of her suit in dismay.
with that tailor.”
“I was the best man for the job and you know it,” Tony says, swallowing down the impulse to say any of the rest.
“I didn’t do anything,” Tony said, rapidly flipping through HUDs and swiping to a new screen, because he could feel what Cap had felt, now that he was paying attention: they had light gravity back. Had he inadvertently tripped an artigrav system?
“C’mon!” he shouted, not bothering to turn off the speakers this time.
Cap laughs again. “More clothes, fewer clothes, jeez Tony. Make up your mind, you’re worse than a cat.”
“I believe in you,” Cap says, which is just pure on-brand ridiculousness: who even says that, apart from Captain America? And it’s not an answer to Tony’s question, so it just goes to show that he’s not even listening.
“Oh, well, if you wouldn’t be
Both of Steve’s eyebrows shoot up before he can stop himself. Tony laughs. “OK, ok, there’s a little bit of the pot calling the kettle black there. But I
Tony’s not here to solve alien math. He has to—he has to do something. Fuck. He has to get them out of here. He’s probably dehydrated. There’s… there’s probably heat stroke. Heat exhaustion. All of that.

“If… if that’s an option.”
There are two emergency water pouches, one built into each thigh plate. They’re the termini of the suit’s water reclaimer system. He originally borrowed the concept from Dune, and it seemed like a good idea at the time, but even though he knows the water is perfectly good, and he’s used it in a pinch to wash out a wound or quench red-hot metal, he’s always been too grossed out to actually drink it.
The clattering stops, replaced briefly by the sound of running water, and then Tony reappears, a variety of damp and dry cloths draped over one arm like a butler. A nude butler. Steve grins at the sight. Tony shakes his head at him, smiling. “Well. Don’t
Cap winced a little at the whine of the drill, but Tony was at least 80% sure any residual noise from the alarm would cover it. The more important thing was that he was also 80% sure he was drilling in towards a system hub that, when he could get close enough to physically jack himself into it, would let him override a bunch of the ship’s electrical controls, including the doors, engine, and basic steering.
“This is fucking crazy, you realize that, right? This is actual alien technology. I don’t know what half the materials are, I don’t know what they’re using for a fuel source—oh, wait, I think it’s a plasma-based engine—”
But it
“I still feel like I didn’t contribute all that I could,” he insists. Tony sighs, but Steve forges on. He may as well—it’s not as if his face can get much redder. “I’d like… if you were all right with it… I’d like another chance. To show that I can do more.”
you can do is get just a couple measly samples for me—”
, at his leisure. The icy glow it gives off makes Tony’s skin look warmer in contrast, velvety smooth under the black hair that draws a line down the center of his torso. Steve had been in the process of getting his own vest and shirt off, but he’s frozen now, caught between the desire to continue his task and the mouth-watering, fingertip-tingling need to just reach out and
“We have that big gala tonight, I am
“Black tie!” Iron Man adds. “No lab coats—” Hank, who had come up from the basement to take possession of the vial, grumbles indistinctly—“and sleeves are
“Hey, Cap? Can you grab my helmet?”
“Yeah,” Steve says, nonsensically. Tony is still standing very close, close enough that Steve can smell something faintly spiced, either a cologne or some sort of hair product; it’s reminiscent of
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve mutters.
Steve is thinking about
“That’s not
He shakes his head, which serves the dual purpose of dismissing Cap and telling the helmet that it’s on active duty again. All the HUDs come online at once before sorting out to his usual home settings, most of the others sinking away into nested tabs at the edges of his visual field. This all takes place against a white background, but in the moment it takes for the HUDs to go through start-up, the helmet’s lenses auto-polarize, and he can actually
“Oh, but discussing fashion at a gala is very classy. Practically tradition, really.” Tony leans back against the counter and smooths a hand down the front of his waistcoat, ostentatiously luxuriating in the feel of the embroidered design. He stops just above his belt buckle, which draws Steve’s eyes there entirely without his input. Tony’s tanned hand stands out beautifully against the snowy white fabric. “You know, the only real problem with modern suiting trends is the fact that the pants are tailored so close, sometimes it can be difficult to get out of them. It’s much easier if you have some

surprised him, but the following cascade of satisfying thumps as mechanical bits fell into alignment was as universal as the speed of light. A door opened in the side of the little ship and he could feel the hum of energy-bearing systems coming online; even without the ability to hack Extremis in directly, he was still finely tuned to shifts in nearby electromagnetic fields; it was a haptic sense, like an old man feeling the humidity change in his joints.
