was, in fact, a movie for people who did like Christmas, since in the end even the Grinch had to admit that there was something magical about the festive season. For fucks sake, he even helped return all the presents he’d stolen.
In the workshop and in the Iron Man suit, in Armani and dirty shirts, the laugh lines around his eyes and the straining muscles on his arms.
The waitress stopped by to bring their drinks. Steve didn’t do a very good job of hiding his sceptic looks towards Tony’s order - after a few minutes Tony held up his drink and offered it to Steve. “Wanna try?”
“Thank you,” Tony hurried to say, then immediately ruined it by letting his mouth talk on without a filter. “I’d tell you where everything is but I’ve never used the kitchen except for the coffee machine.”
Tony felt someone’s eyes on him and met Natasha’s gaze, who was watching him as though he was a puzzle she was working on solving.
Tony couldn’t enjoy the movie. The way Steve left bothered him. It was late, Tony wasn’t sure what time it is, but he knew everybody else was asleep. His mind couldn’t stop thinking about Steve and he wondered what emotional turmoil he was dealing with. No one in the Avengers ever talked about their emotions, everyone chose to skate by the topic because that’s a whole Pandora’s Box of trauma none of them are willing to open. Nonetheless, out of everyone Tony thought had the most trauma, Steve was not even on his top five list. Everything about the man is perfect. He wasn’t force to undergo any dangerous trial and errors. Everything perfect about Steve was handed to him in a small vial created by his father. However out of anyone, Tony knows just because your outside facade seems perfect doesn’t mean it is.
“I never seen you cook,” Steve retorted, a playful grin on his face that struck a chord in Tony’s heart.
He zoned out the rest of their argument. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Steve, who watched Thor’s and Bruce’s argument in amusement. There was something about Steve’s face that Tony liked that every time he saw Steve, he would stare. He caught himself smiling and turned away, face warm and eyes desperately searching to find someone else to talk to. He spotted Clint, who still occupied the grill. He hadn’t talk to Clint yet since the barbecue started.
Steve complied and they both sat together. Neither of them spoke, instead embraced their surroundings. The stars were outshined by the New York City lights, but the skyline was still beautiful. Sea salt emitted from the ocean and they could here the faint movement of water. Peaceful is the only word Tony can describe it. After the battle with Loki in New York, they deserve it, the city, the Avengers, him. He hopes Steve knows he deserves it as well.
Step 3: We bury the evidence.” He set the marker down, facing the class. “We throw so much information at the jury that they leave the courtroom with one overwhelming feeling…doubt. Thats how you get away with murder.”
“You’re up early,” Tony said. He grabbed his coffee mug, an iron man mug designed by a fan, and Clint poured him a cup.
“And I didn’t think Captain goddamn America could be anything other than straight. You’re going to get all the conservatives mad, you know?”
Steve gripped Tony’s collar and pulled him into a kiss. They heard whooping and hollering from the other Avengers. Steve smiled into the kiss and it didn’t falter when their lips separated. “Looks like we did,” Steve said.
Steve pictured a stripper in a poorly made Halloween Captain America costume. It took all of his energy to laugh at that image. “Tony,
“One more thing,” Fury added, garnering everyone’s attention. “Every year, I have six of my students to come work with me. I use this assignment to decide whether or not you’re capable of joining my team.”  Fury walked to one of the book shelves. He held up a slim glass trophy.  “The top student gets this. My first recognization trophy in the region.” He smirked at the trophy. “Consider it an immunity. Having this allows you to get out of one of my exams. Useful considering all the hard work I’m going to put you all through. Now go. Find a defense that will clear my client.”
Tony was still eyeing the leftover glitter with desperation, when the door opened again a few minutes later.
, Tony muses. He can feel Steve’s body heat beneath the blankets, and their shoulders are pressing against each other.
The small parcel, given to him late at night, when they were on Tony’s floor. Steve’s hopeful yet nervous smile.
“Tony Stark!” An elderly woman bellowed as she draped her thick red coat over one of the chairs on her table. Tony frowned, trying to decide whether he was supposed to know her or not. “Oh, it’s such a joy to see you again! Say, how’re you finding New York?”
He doesn’t need to see the pile of ashes on the chair and sink onto his knees with tears running down his cheeks.
“Okay, that’s enough,’’ Tony said sternly, gently tugging Steve backwards by his hand. “Why don’t we all take a break, huh?’’
It’s obvious that this is a thing of Steve’s own mind. Tony’s voice had never been so cold and cruel. Angry, yes, but never cold.
Tony isn’t quite sitting on the couch. He’s halfway slithered down to the ground, with his head lolled to the side.
When he pushes the door to his son’s room open after knocking gets him no response, the only thing he sees is a vague lump on the bed and Tony realizes he shouldn’t have waited so long.
He’d tried to be a good father for Peter, to raise him alone and not let him get between Tony and Steve. But it was draining, and Tony knows he didn’t even do that good of a job as it is.
“It’s Dream magic,” Steve says, swallowing. Dreams include nightmares. He thinks of the—spirit that had attacked them. Maybe he should bring it up, but he’s only now gotten Tony to not hate him. He shouldn’t.
Stay away. Don’t touch, because anything Tony touches he breaks, and he always has wanted to touch Steve the most. He knows how Steve feels now.
“She really respects you too,” Tony notes, sounding fond again. Too? Steve agrees that Giselle must respect Tony very much, but that’s uncharacteristic of Tony to say, Steve knows that now. “So griffins like you back, I’m not surprised. Two iconic symbols, standing together. Hey, it’s like King Arthur and his griffin all over again, I should get a memory capture of this hanged on my wall.”
Steve curls his hand around Tony’s arm. “Tony,” he whispers, hurt, like the world is crumbling around him, or maybe it already has.
“Worth a try,” Tony says. “She’s a good person. The people here have always loved her. If I want to undo the rune, I need to know her original intent so I don’t accidentally make gravity stop existing because someone dreamed about flying.”
Tony licks his lips. “Yeah.” He sets the fruit on fire, lets it burn, crackling with the flames. After it dies down, Tony splits the fruit again and hands it over.
“It’s not yours either, Iron Man,” Steve says, jaw clenching, unclenching. He has hardened his voice into something stronger, like the tone Captain America uses in battle, but it just sounds brittle to Tony.
His magic flares, his arc reactor glowing pleasantly. Warm but not overwhelming, something comfortable but electric at the same time, something that’s feels so alive, both impossibly raw and sharply refined. A breath of fresh air, a hum that’s constant but never falls into the background into nothingness.
(Only for himself, because he is greedy and selfish. He’s certainly not going to build anything for the world that has given him nothing, obviously, and the world is envious and angry. But, eventually, they have nothing they can say in front of him but praise, can only be drawn in by Tony’s magnetism and watch him show his bare, unmarked wrists.)
“I’ll frame it in gold,” Tony says. “Or even vibranium, that’s a thought.” He grins. “Wanna lend me your shield?”
Wanda’s lips part in surprise. She narrows her eyes, fingers twitching like she wants to cast a spell, but refrains. “Then good luck to you and yours,” she says. “Now we would like to enjoy our peace. In peace,” she adds pointedly.
Tony has a point, but Steve doesn’t want to dwell on it. It’s not that he doesn’t appreciate humor, but it’s unfamiliar, rusted. The silence between them is tense, until Steve, surprising even himself, is the one who breaks it by saying, “There are at least two dictionaries. Let’s not be critical of Asgardian scholars now.”
Steve looked down again and pity was all Tony could feel at the moment. He could tell the man was struggling to keep his emotion in check, but not even that perfect face prevent something from slipping. Tony noticed a bench.
Half the period goes by until Mrs. Larsen finishes talking. Quickly, Tony shoved his phone into his pocket.
“Lovingly? No, our stares are our own secret coded language.” He swallowed the last bit of his burger. “Hey, if you like Steve, there’s nothing wrong with it. I mean, lately you two have been hanging out a lot, which is good for team bonding, but I’ve noticed you’ve been pretty accommodating to Steve.”
“Or,” Tony added, “maybe I keep escaping death and eventually its coming after me, or maybe the big man up in the sky is keeping me alive for some fucking reason, I don’t know.” He chewed his bottom lip and is scanning Steve’s face for a hint of emotion. Compared to his face, his eyes carry empathy. Tony continued. “Remember when I went inside that wormhole? I saw something, I keep having nightmares about it. It’s like stuff that hasn’t happen yet. It’s just…a pain in my ass to be honest.”
Tony went to the kitchen. He had woke up later than usual. Clint wasn’t in the kitchen like he usually would be, but the coffee maker had brewed coffee in it. He poured himself some coffee and sat on the high chair. Around ten minutes later, Steve arrived in the kitchen. Blue marks painted his neck and Tony smirked since it was his doing. He still wore the same clothes he did when he first walked into Tony’s room.
When Tony killed the engine and looked over to Steve, the blond was staring out the window with his mouth hanging open.
Tony was contemplating whether or not convincing Steve that the kiss had just been a dream would work, when he came to a conclusion of his own. “You kissed me.”
Tony runs at his eyes and tries to make sense of the time. It’s probably still morning; he never sleeps longer than one to two hours.
Tony’s shoulders fall. The fight drops out of him and leaves him feeling incredibly empty. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have...”
Peter, being Peter, just nods and makes a break for the Compound the second Steve hands him his small suitcase.
A mangled version of Steve’s name escaped his lips and broke their kiss. Steve’s cheeks were colored a lovely shade of pink, and his breath tickled Tony’s chin, rough and fast.
When Steve finds himself opposite of three determined pairs of eyes and hears the doors to the training room slide shut, he doesn't have to ask.
He brings Tony the bouquet of white stargazer lilies that Steve bought for him about a week ago on one of his runs. Little gestures like this never failed to bring a smile to Tony’s face, and from their very first date on, Steve’d made it his personal mission to make Tony smile as much as possible.
And well, Tony felt like denying Steve now - with that face he was making - would be a capital offense.
Tony frowned at the snippy reply, even as he complied and tugged off his socks, pants and jacket. Sure, he’d made a joke but he did that all the time. Why did this one seemed to bother Steve so much, he couldn’t explain.
Still, Steve found it hard to relax on the ride back. He could smell Tony thicker now, in the small room of the car, and he’d spent the entire evening yearning to pull him closer and scent him. And judging from the looks Tony was giving him, he was having similar thoughts.
“Dad, he’s...” Peter swallows. “He’s been in the workshop all day. And last evening, he was... I haven’t ever seen him like this, Papa.”
And yeah, there’s a storm of emotions fighting for space in his heart, but he’s not about to deny his son this, even if something in him is shivering nervously.
Natasha just looks at him. “If that’s true, how do you think he feels? Tony Stark, trapped in his own body, completely dependent on others, with no means of communicating.”
It kind of feels that way now, though. With how ridiculous everything seemed just two years later, when both of them was facing Thanos alone.
Rhodey smiles sadly. “I know. But he’s going to come back, and he’s not going to love you any less when he does.”
And then, just as they’re blasting the last of the aliens, a giant portal opens directly next to Steve and stumbling out comes probably the weirdest group he’s ever seen.
“Goddamnit Steve!” Tony exclaims. He let’s go of the table and walks towards Steve, until they’re a mere meter apart. “We haven’t seen each other in two years! So stop pretending to care!”
He doesn’t even know where they are exactly; everything’s been a blur since he saw Thor carry Tony out of the woods.
Steve wants to cry. Whatever he said, it would all be too late. The damage is tone, and it’s been years since Thanos.
“I should go look for him,” Tony says, both to get out of the situation and because he knows that Peter will still be upset.
“But we haven’t opened any presents yet,” Peter finishes. “I thought you’d want to be here for that.”
In that moment, Tony’s suit appeared in the sky, dropping Steve’s shield into his hands and assembling itself around Tony in seconds.
The news host regards Ross with mild interest. “Do you think this behavior is incriminating, considering they are part of the United Nations?”
Peter seems to be completely frozen next to him, so Steve gently places a hand on his shoulder and asks “Can we see him?”
Tony feels a headache building behind his temple. “Steve,” he says calmly. “If you continue to try to avoid getting near me we’re gonna have a problem in the next few hours.”
His house is quite big, he’s living in the suburbs of Washington, far away from the busy humming of the city, and it makes him feel restless. He knows it’s because he doesn’t have as much to do as he used to, before his retirement. Occasionally, he still drives by the Compound to oversee the training of the new Avengers, but he forbids himself from doing it too often. He’s retired for a reason, after all.
With their combined forces, they manage to turn the tide; force Thanos army further away from the forest and surround them, until they’ve got all of the aliens either dead on in their control.
Steve simply shakes his head. He hadn’t - that hadn’t been his intent at all. He needed to tell Tony how sorry he was, how he’d never meant to hurt him. And since he hadn’t been brave enough to call, he’d sent the letter instead, knowing he had to do
From the very first day, Steve’s been disgustingly sweet to him. Wrapped his arms around him in bed, brought him roses from his morning runs, kissed him on the forehead and smiled that wondering smile, as if he couldn’t believe his luck. (Ridiculous.)
Bruce leans against his workbench. “I’ve seen Steve head to the training room earlier.” He watches Tony cautiously. “He seemed distressed.”
Steve was still confused, but Tony was staring at him with so much hope in his eyes that he couldn’t say no.
The words were so quiet that Tony almost didn't hear them. Steve was looking at him with an earnest, content expression on his face, as if there was not a cloud in the sky.
A guy with a weird masks and repulsor blasts on his shoes, a screaming man with a naked, blue torso and a woman with what looks like antennas growing right out of their head.
He took a deep breath. “Look, Tony, you’ve been so kind to me the past few weeks, so I was wondering if you would like to come have some coffee with me.”
The first few bombs hit Thanos effortlessly, with Tony flying in a safe distance, but then the titan lunges after him - fucking hell, Tony didn’t even know he was able to run - and gets a hand around Tony’s left leg.
Steve stares at Strange. He’s never thought of himself as particularly bad with kids, but all of a sudden, he feels helpless.
To his surprise, Peter just nods and sits down. He reachers for a piece of bread and starts nibbling on it.
Tony bit back a sigh and indulged the forced attempt at conversation. It wasn’t Bruce’s fault, after all, that Steve and Tony couldn't look each other in the eye anymore.
By the time the landscape got more shallow, Tony wasn’t feeling the snow in his boots anymore. He was almost inclined to admit that Steve’d been right in saying the hike would be worth it.
A cone fell out of a tube on the right and was transferred to the front, where a perfectly portioned scoop of ice cream fell into it.
Tony resists the urge to shift nervously. Steve was right; for the upcoming battle, they’d be in different groups - him trying to kill Thanos, and Steve trying to destroy the gauntlet once they get it form Thanos and bring back all the lives that were lost.
From that day on, they invite him to training every other day, and if Steve starts to feel truly grateful for the
Later, Steve is in the training room they’ve been provided with, wondering where exactly he and Tony went so irrevocably wrong. Was it him protecting Bucky? Was it Siberia? Or those two years they didn’t even talk to each other?
Tony opened his mouth to tell her that no, he wouldn't be leaving New York again as abruptly as he had the last time, and stumble into his office, shaking and desperate for work to take his mind off of Steve. But it wasn't like he'd planned to do that last year either.
Tony was surprised Steve was still there, since he had an entire floor to himself, but the Captain seemed perfectly at ease. (And Tony found comfort in his presence, so he didn’t call Steve out on it.)
Steve responds in kind, frames Tony’s face with his hands and moves against his lips ever so softly.
Steve looks at Tony and can’t help but feel dismay. They’d worked long and hard for Tony’s self-esteem to get better; Steve shouldn’t have let this get so far.
“You’re sick, Tony,” is what comes out of Steve’s mouth before his brain can remind him of the fact that they’re unofficially officially not talking about that.
“I think,” Tony said, still taken aback. For some reason, Hammer’s words sounded like they were reaching him through a thick blanket. “My answer will be no. Jesus, have you at all paid attention to Stark Industries in the last two years?”
More so because Steve’s loving but shy smiles still make his knees weak than actual surprise, but it does make him wonder.
Peter eventually stops rambling when one of the teachers stop at the table to congratulate him on his work. Steve steps back a bit to give them space, and Tony follows him.
And this was so, so important. It made him nervous to the point where, when Tony met him in front of the elevators, Tony immediately frowned at him.
When he wakes up that day, he thinks of one too many teenage romance movies that he’s been forced to see. How in almost every one of them, there’s the scene of the heroine and her love interest sharing a last intimate moment before going into battle.
Tony extended his hand to Steve, and Iron Man and Captain America flew into the sky, off to save New York once more.
He keeps his arm around Peter shoulders as he steers them away from the building, towards the trees on the outskirts of their property. Just enough of a walk to put space between them and the building, but not enough that it would feel like they were leaving Tony.
Steve sighs. “I don’t regret not supporting the Accords. I couldn’t have signed them with good conscience.”
But that’s how they got into this mess in the first place, so he doesn’t. He listens and agrees to the plan like he’s supposed to. (At least for now.)
For example, the fact that he’d never really gotten over it, and that he sat there every year waiting for the clock to strike midnight.
(Even though his heart was screaming and there was an empty void in front of him whenever he imagined a life without his husband.)
Normally, he’d associate all the music and the food and the lights with how cold and quiet his own childhood had been, but with Steve at his side, it all made him feel warm and fuzzy.
(He considered, just for a moment, if he should let Peter have Tony’s room, but he couldn’t make himself go through with it.)
He wakes up in what must be a medical center, with machines attached to him that he doesn’t recognize, and architecture that doesn’t make sense to him either.
Tony’d had a few rude awakenings in his lifetime, but he immediately decided to put this one among the worst.
“You knew about my parents and you chose to lie to me,” Tony says, cold. “And you thought a simple letter would cut it?”
Peter doesn’t even pick up on the fact that Steve doesn’t believe him. “Come on, you have to try some of the cookies! Oh, and Pepper was so mad at Dad for making a mess in the kitchen, maybe if we’re fast enough we can watch her make him clean it up!”
His teammates come and go, but none of them can really reach the horrible place Steve’s mind is stuck in.
“He... told me I’m doing good with Peter.” Steve hesitates. “Despite, you know, having to do it alone.”
Steve hurries to his side before he even realizes what his legs are doing. “I’m here.” He takes Peter’s hands in his, tries to ground him.
He contemplates just hiding in his room and have Rhodey make the Captain leave, but his pride refuses, so after half an hour of contemplation, he finally drags himself into a standing position.
Tony frowned and returned to the ballroom, making a beeline for the bar. (Maybe he could spot Steve from here… Just to make sure he hadn't been dragged to dance…)
“It’s nice,” Tony says, who’s been looking around the spacious living room for the past five minutes. “It suits you. Although, to complete the American Dream you’re missing a wife and two and a half kids.”
But Peter’s suffering enough as it is. He shouldn’t have to worry about the little things too. Like Tony and Steve being unable to lead a conversation that doesn’t turn ugly.
If she’s concerned at his utter look of.. caring, she doesn't show it. And Steve doesn't think much about it either.
A whole delegation awaits him, of what he presumes to be warriors of Wakanda, as well as those that are left of the Avengers. Plus a pissed-off looking raccoon.
It was tempting to make something up, dent the role he played in it all, but he already lied about this once, and the repercussions still send knives of guilt into his heart every time he looks into Tony’s eyes.
Silently, Steve asks himself the same question. He knows Tony accepted the accords because he wanted accountability to his actions, not because he held any particular sympathies for the secretary. But he’s never really thought about how it must’ve been for Tony, to work with a man who thought of him as nothing better than a vigilante with a staggering death toll on his account.
Finally, a hesitant smile spread across Steve’s face. “If it’s no bother for you, I’d really like that.”
But Tony shakes his head again, more insistent now, and he continues talking as if he hasn’t even heard her. “I’m going to go back to Washington and then I’m going to make him stop saying that, he doesn’t even have any idea how hard we’ve been trying -“
Steve swallows. Tony’s standing there, in one of his most expensive suits, with silver in his hair and wrinkles across his face. He’s as gorgeous as he’s ever been, and Steve wants nothing more than to make everything right between them, get those years in the tower back, when Tony was his and they were both happy. But he doesn’t want to spend this conversation fighting.
Tony gets risotto and Steve orders pasta, then proceeds to sneak these weird, almost shy glances at him.
He’d always dream though, of someone smart and witty, who’d be able to hold their own, but wouldn’t mind letting Steve take care of them once in a while.
Steve swallows against the pressure building up in his throat. Their old life is there right in front of him, and yet still out of reach.
As it turned out, even though Steve had more experience with the outdoors than Tony, the conditions got worse a lot quicker than anticipated. By the time they came back to the cabin, snow had begun falling as well, getting thicker every minute.
“I really do trust you, you know. You’re super important to us,” He proclaimed when he watched Natasha steer the Quinjet into the sky.
Tony took the chair opposite Steve and tried to get a look at the letters Steve was looking at. “Hey man.”
“But, uh, if it’s too much for you, we can also just wait until the sun’s gone down and use it to stargaze.”
“Someone’s gotta catch him!” Steve yells into the comms before he’s being slammed into the ground by one of the aliens.
Tony, as usual, wasn't fazed. “As a matter of fact, I think I do so better than you, considering you have yet to say anything useful.’’
“Since the battle ended,” he clarifies. “We won, by the way. Which doesn’t mean you’re allowed to self-destruct.”
He didn’t know if Tony was watching him or not, but he found it didn’t matter all that much. Knowing Tony was there made him feel safe and comfortable.
He turned around to check on Tony every few minutes, his cheeks a lovely red and with a stupid, encouraging smile on his face.
Tony has him drink some tea and then curl into the bed again, carefully placing one of the cold towels on his forehead. It doesn’t seem to do much good though; in fact, Peter’s slipping more and more into delirium by the time Tony lets him lie down again.
He knew Steve didn't like these kinds of events. The many people who wanted to talk to him, wanted a piece of Captain America, even if it was just a handshake, made him nervous. Tony’d been surprised when Steve decided to come along to this one, even when Tony had made it abundantly clear that he would be fine going by himself.
He was getting better at taking time for himself every now and then, either to train or to paint, but going away for God knows how long on a
He let himself fall onto his workshop couch and tried to relax in the blessed silence. After dinner, Natasha had suggested playing Poker, which lead to quite a tense competition between her and Clint that Tony had had to cut short, as Bruce had been looking on increasingly nervously. They had decided on watching a movie afterwards, and even though Tony had taken the opposite side of the couch, he had still felt Steve’s presence, just as tense and uncomfortable as he was.
All he knows is that somewhere in this building, Tony is fighting for his life and Steve might never get to ask all of the questions that are burning on his tongue.
It’s small things; the way Tony gets increasingly frustrated with his back, the hair coloring that one day appears in their bathroom. Steve lets it slide, mostly because he knows Tony won’t appreciate Steve pointing it out.
Natasha’s there first, singling her presence by gently putting a hand on his shoulder. She doesn’t say anything. When Steve gathers the strength to look up, her eyes are troubled and angry, but above all sad. After a while she leaves, no doubt to bully some poor doctor to update her on Tony’s condition.
decision to make, not yours,” he tells her firmly, even through the tears wetting his cheeks. “So let me out of here and drop it.”
When they’ve cleared their plates, they move over to the couch. Even though there’s only three of them, and the room is consequently a lot quieter than Steve’s used to, the old ritual of having a movie night on New Year’s Eve does wonders for his mood. Tony and Rhodey bicker with each other just like his old teammates used to to, and he slowly unwinds while taking sips of his wine.
It was true. Steve was swaying slightly back and forth, a faraway expression in his face, much like the one Tony had seen one too many times in the mirror.
Tony grumbles and hides his face in Steve’s chest. He’s avoiding the conversation, but that’s okay. Steve will just tell him how stunning he is that much more often now.
Tony gently cards his hands through Peter’s curls to keep him relaxed and tells FRIDAY to let Steve in. Barely a minute later, the door opens, revealing his ex-husband’s blue eyes.
Tony briefly avoids his eyes, then meets his gaze with newfound resolve. “Let’s... Let’s go upstairs, yeah? It’ll be a bit quieter.”
“I’m sorry,” was the first thing that cake out of Steve’s mouth and all Tony could do was stare. “I shouldn’t have... said what I said. Earlier, I mean. I realize you probably don’t feel the same way and -”
Doctor Strange closes the portal to Titan; Steve guesses his name from what Bruce has told him. Unfortunately, that also eradicates any doubt that the boy really is Peter.
“He was.” Tony fights down the lump in his throat. “He- When he got his powers, he was running around in a onesie. A
Once they were situated next to each other beneath the blankets, shoulders touching just barely, Steve began to talk.
Steve can’t blame him; it wouldn’t be surprising if the kid went into shock, with everything that’s happened to him.
“I love you,” Steve chokes out. He gathers Tony into his hands and carries him down the stairs as fast as he dares to, murmuring reassurances, promises, begs.
Memories of evenings and nights spent together. Memories of Steve looking at him with such tenderness, that -
(A part of his brain wonders why so many of their team had to go, and yet, that man was still alive, but he quickly shushes it. It’s not going to do them any good, thinking like this, he knows that.)
He tries to answer her, or at least he thinks he does, but it proves to be too much effort, and he gives up.
. You didn’t trust me to make a compromise. You ran off without thinking of how this would affect Peter. And then you left me there, in Siberia. I could’ve died.”
Tony takes a deep breath, as if sterling himself for something. “Thank you for watching Peter. You know, last week.”
It’s been about six days, and Steve knows Tony’s had times when he went off the radar for even longer.
They sit like that for a few hours while Peter sleeps. They check his temperature every half an hour and continuously place cooling towels on his forehead, but it takes until the early hours of the morning for Peter’s fever to break.
It’s awful. There’s no sign of discomfort or struggle on Tony’s face, and yet, watching him hover in that void between life and death is like hammer to Steve’s heart.
Tony has failsafes for this exact scenario, built in after Steve woke up from one too many nightmares and
He tries to cut Steve off, but the latter holds up a hand and barrels right on. “Now, you shouldn’t have been drinking. Especially not with Peter around. But I’m not doubting you, or your ability to be a father for him.”
Which was how, a few moments later, Steve was tugging the red and golden hat over his ears. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
“Alright.” Peter gives him a lopsided smile and drops back down into the sheets, immediately out like a light.
Tony huffed and stared at Steve’s shoulder, mourning the fact that he couldn't use it as a pillow, as for some reason Steve’d decided to sit too far away from him.
“That’s not the problem,” Natasha answered grimly. “But he shouldn’t be on a potential battle ground with his... condition.”
They both decided to get their Crêpe with sugar and cinnamon, and the sweet taste added to the fuzzy feeling in his belly.
Steve’s done a lot of crying in the past half a year. He finds his eyes watering anyway, as if it’s been weeks, not months.
They were all stood a few feet away from Steve, who’d been in the middle of the explosion when HYDRA’s laboratory caught fire in the midst of their fighting. By the way some of their opponents had smirked when the ominous red dust surrounded their teammate, that was exactly how they’d planned to infect Steve with the serum.
It wasn’t like Tony was trying to be a pain to Pepper on purpose; the obnoxious tree really did make him feel uneasy. Every year, it reminded him of the one that Howard used to have set up in their living room, and that didn’t exactly mean happy family vibes. Cue him avoiding Christmas trees wherever he possibly could.
Tony felt a headache build behind his eyes. It’s not like isn’t used to the team banter, but usually, they have Sam with them to diffuse any real fights.
But then, in the evening , when they’re both laying in bed, sated and sweaty, that changes. Steve’s always found Tony beautiful when he’s relaxed like this, and tells him as much, just like he’s done a thousand times before.
“I’ll need to do some blood tests,” he says, so friendly it almost makes Steve want to shake him. “If you would roll up your sleeve, please?”
When he did it the first time at a party for the Maria Stark Foundation, he’d been watching Tony get more and more closed off during an argument with a female Alpha, and when she laid a hand on his shoulder, Steve wasn't able to help himself. He put himself between Tony and the woman, a low warning growl rumbling in his throat.
He sees Peter’s eyes in front of him, huge and terrified, and finally feels calm at the memory, because he’s about to make everything right again.
Steve chose a small café near Queens which he’d discovered shortly after he woke up from the ice. Back then, no one recognised his face and the staff had always been kind to him. When he’d debated over where to bring Tony, he’d figured Tony would appreciate not being treated as a celebrity for an evening, so he’d called ahead and they had immediately agreed to give them a secluded table on their roof terrace.
It came easy to him, maybe even a little bit too easy. A little joke there, some meaningless conversation here, and dinner was over in a flash.
It’s like he cut bonds holding Steve back, because as soon as the last word leaves his mouth, he’s stumbling into the room, to the other side of the bed, where he crouches so he’s eye-level with Peter.
“We discussed if we should relocate to the compound,” Steve says, carefully testing the waters. “You might be able to work more efficiently there.”
He heard her chair scrape across the tiles as she stood. She walked around the table and gave him a hug with one arm around his shoulders. He leaned into and felt her lips press against his hair for a split second.
(He’s been trying to drink less, because one day Peter had a minor freakout because he worried for Tony’s health - and that just wouldn’t do.)
Steve goes and does the same thing, showers and puts on clean clothes, goes to find food and gets Bucky to update him on the rest of the team.
“I found out on a mission about two years ago.” He breathes in deeply, shoves the memories of Siberia away and keeps his voice collected and gentle for his son. “I didn’t tell Tony then. He found out in Siberia.”
When he steered his Jeep into the broad driveway of his two-story wooden lodge though, those three days of inappropriate comments were definitely worth it.
For a split-second, they shared an alarmed look. Then, they jumped out of their chairs and towards the edge of the terrace. Tony was tapping away at his watch, calling one of his suits, Steve presumed.
At first, Steve hadn’t been able to talk. There was a weight as heavy as a boulder on his chest, and the only sound he was able to make were small, choked off sobs.
It all goes well and according to plan; Sam flies the gauntlet to Bucky and Wanda, who will be working to destroy the stones for good. Everyone who is resurrected fights alongside them immediately.
They need to distract him if they want to grant Thor a chance, and they can’t exactly use their communicators to form a plan.
He recognizes FRIDAY threatening to end Lockdown Protocol on her own behalf, which just seems ridiculously funny to him; he’d created her after all, who was she to abolish protocols he’d put in place?
Instead, Steve walks over to Tony’s little personal area of the workshop, where he had a couch, a cupboard and even a small fridge for when he inevitably looked himself in for days at a time.
Steve knows that the kid’s most likely pushing through the confusion and would be going into panic any second if he didn’t get an answer to his question. But then again, answer to his question would probably do the same thing.
When Steve wrenches the door open and steps outside, Tony starts to convulse. His muscles spasm, his entire body is wracked with cramps so severe Steve can barely keep his hold on him.
He was wearing his biggest parka and the massive boots that he almost never used. And yet, he was still shivering and he was pretty sure some snow had already fallen into his shoes.
The guilt has filled him up with so much energy that Tony is just about ready to throw the plan to hell and go kill Thanos with his bare hands.
They get Rhodey off the hook by promising Ross that he’ll be there to keep the citizens in line. It’s a lie, and they both know it, but by now, they’re simply trying to get back to the compound in peace.
So yeah, Steve loves seeing Tony’s wrinkles deepen and his hair turn gray, but he has the increasing suspicion that his husband wouldn’t agree with him.
It’s been better, ever since Steve took him home from the shelter. Whenever lonely evenings stretch into the night, his dog is he only thing keeping away the horrible loneliness.
Of course he does. These days, he always spends the better part of the day looking at Tony, he’s bound to see changes.
“FRIDAY will have an eye on Tony,” Steve reassures him, because he knows she always does. “If he needs us, she’ll tell us.”
The effect was immediate. Steve’s cheeks colored a lovely red. “This isn’t funny, Tony. Get under the blankets before you freeze to death.”
As he leaves him room and heads for the kitchen, he realizes he hasn’t felt this lonely since he woke up in a completely different century.
“There’s nothing any of us can do. And you’re no good to him if you don’t take care of yourself.” Steve speaks carefully, knowing that in the state Peter’s in, he would get upset quickly.
“God, am I glad Hulk and Sam stayed at the tower,” Clint grumbled when they’d finally managed to lock Steve out of the cockpit. “Imagine if he told Hulk he’s the strongest Avenger.”
Clint just shrugged. “I’ll happily take that chance.” Then he took the tinsel from around his neck and started wrapping it around the treadmills. Tony paused in his assault of the boxing bag to stare. Apparently, Clint was very much not kidding with this.
Steve what was going on. He didn’t, though. His parent’s death was public record, so Steve probably knew anyway, and the things that hadn’t been on the tabloids weren’t topics Tony liked to discuss with, well, anyone.
Ever since Steve got to know Tony better, the 16th of December has loomed before them like a dark, stormy cloud. Steve always offered his comfort wherever he could and made sure Tony didn’t self-destruct too much.
“I know.” Steve hovers there for a moment, staring at the Compound with a strange look in his eyes before turning around and walking back to his car.
Sometimes, when he did manage to sleep, he saw it all happen from an outsider’s perspective. He saw himself shattering Tony’s arc reactor with a force Steve’d sworn to never, ever use against him.
“Do you feel out of place now?’’ Tony asked, and it came out exactly right: challenging, but open and patient.
No, that wasn't it. That wasn't it at all. Steve’d lost too many people he loved in the field, and was terrified of losing Tony, too. But he had to be the team leader first and foremost. Often enough, they didn't need to have that fight, because Steve had had no choice anyway.
Steve doesn’t know what to say to this kid, and before he can figure it out, the earth beneath them starts to shake.
He doesn’t want to to go through that again. He wants to turn around and push Steve’s existence away as best as possible. It hurts too fucking much to even consider another possibility.
Steve feels his breath quicken. He has the overwhelming urge to apologize again, but he knows that that’s not what Tony wants. He’s said sorry already, but they never really talked about what happened.
But Tony doesn't respond. His blood is slowly coating the ground and Steve feels terrifyingly alone.
The first day Tony’s back home, Steve sets about making the room as comfortable as possible. He moves some of Tony’s framed pictures downstairs, gives Tony the blanket he shares with Steve and has JARVIS read him the weather and his location every morning, just like before the crash.
Neither Steve nor Tony answered him. They were both too busy staring at each other with shock and confusion in equal matter.
“No,” Tony cuts him off. “You listen. I don’t care what you all think about me, you cannot let Peter hear any of that, you hear me? He’s been suffering enough.”
Ever since they separated in Siberia, Steve’s only seen him once: when he stumbled out of that alien ship and lost consciousness. Bleeding out on the ground.
She sighed. “Don’t worry, Tony has no idea. But do yourself a favour and ask him out already. I don’t even want to know how long this has been going on.”
Some of these days, Steve hates the serum. It’s pulsing through his veins and makes twenty years feel like five to his body, while Tony’s blood has turned against him.
Even with dark blue, purple, and grey streaks in his hair and on his skin, Steve is gorgeous, beyond gorgeous. There's an inner beauty to him others easily miss - either too awed by the cowl and the shield, or dismissive of his old timey charm. He’s courageous and earnest and virtuous, sure, but that’s only part of the picture, like a… like a colouring page yet to be filled. He is
Tony gets into the zone, trading quips back and forth with Nat as he targets all the safest pieces first. Despite already being about three drinks down, his hands are relatively steady.
Steve coughs again and hides his face by turning away to rummage for something behind the couch. Still as smooth as gravel, the punk.
Iron Man and Thor will go ahead to get additional intel and send it back to J.A.R.V.I.S. who will project it on the quinjet so Nat and Steve can plan a course of action. Bruce will start filtering the other data, together with Iron Man and J.A.R.V.I.S. -- Steve keeps being in awe Tony can do all these things simultaneously and better than most people to boot -- and Hawkeye will get them there asap, while keeping in contact with agent Coulson. It's a system which runs better each time they are called upon, and now is no exception.
The tense silence between them stretches long enough that Tony feels a little fear mixed with his indignation but then the guy nods to himself as if coming to a conclusion and eases back into his normal demeanour, dropping the scary angel schtick.
“Sir?” JARVIS’ voice breaks through and Tony spares a thought for how his baby is grown cause he sounds so hesitant. As if he’s as out of his depth as Tony is. “I apologise, I didn’t anticipate such a strong reaction. I only meant to give the creature what he wished so he would leave.”
Tony shifts to face the guy squarely, “Provided you let me restore my AI back to his former self.” His voice is hardened and leaves no room for negotiation on this point.
When the blond had shoved Tony away to go make demands of his AI, Tony had felt a dawning sense of horror at having let himself be manipulated so easily. Obviously the dude was just showing Tony affection because he was trying to get information out of him. And Tony, like an idiot, had fallen right into his trap. And that too, so soon after Sunset, so soon after Tony had caused major losses to his company because of her corporate espionage.
"Well away from them if we do it." If just waving causes his eardrums to explode Steve doesn't want to think about what opening another portal will do.
Steve starts running the moment he sees the bot starts shooting out electricity and all the little ones stutter for a moment. "The large one feeds off the smaller ones! Stop frying them!" he yells frantically in the comms.
Let Bucky take his immortal soul or whatever, he had more immediate concerns like the fact that the camera mounted on his penthouse door was apparently working just fine despite the fact that it was on the same sub-system as the ones inside.
"Need something… used ta use Vaseline," he says, pulling back to see Tony's reaction to his old timey suggestion with a grin.
“There’s no ploy here, Captain Righteous. I’m not some criminal mastermind sitting here twirling my moustache with a nefarious plot. You wanted me to tell you the truth, well I am! You don’t like it, that’s your problem,” he says throwing his arms out in frustration.
In a second, everyone rushed to their seats, everyone clamored down as the professor walked in. A bald African-American man with a black eyepatch entered the classroom, carrying a black briefcase.
“Great,” he muttered. He opened his eyes and stared at the screen. His eyes rescanned the blueprint of the upgraded foot pulsers. He swiped to get full 360 view of the pulsers. He made one minor change to the design and swiped it away.
“Ah.” Neither said anything as both avoided making eye contact. "Hey, I’m sorry for ignoring you in class, I didn’t want any trouble on the first day of class.”
Steve swallowed the popcorn and reached out for a water bottle. “I don’t have a sweet tooth, but to make you happy…” He took one of the fun sized chocolate and ate it.
Steve followed Tony to the dinning table. Immediately, he spotted the stack of pancakes, decorated with patriotic colored whipped cream and sparklers sticked on it. Definitely Tony’s idea, but Clint’s creation.
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know, I’ve only been here for a semester. Long enough to know some of the small things going on.”
“Good job team, I say this calls for a celebration,” Tony suggested as they walked into the living room. “Maybe drinks? Barbecue? Clint, I heard you’re very good on the grill.”
Tony shrugged. He has grown up with media attention surrounding him, it shouldn’t phase him at this stage of his life anyway more.
Tony shrugged, not able to agree with that statement. He chugged a good half of his coffee before motioning for Clint to refill.
“We have ground turkey meat,” Clint shouted from the fridge. He pulled out two pounds of the ground turkey and placed it on the counter. “I can make a mean turkey burger.”
“No, but normal you wouldn’t typically go out the way to connect with someone to the extent you do with Steve.”
He pulled away once he felt out of breath. The dread that plagued him before dissipated. “Holy shit,” he breathed. Tony went in for a kiss, but quickly stopped himself. Another dread weighed on his mind. “Wait, you’re drunk.”
“But do come to us with answers, we appreciate that more,” Maria addressed the class. She gave Phil a warning glare who brushed it off.
“The Commonwealth v. Carina Tate was a case of attempted murder by the defendant Carina Tate. Ms. Tate worked as an assistant to the victim, Taneleer Tivan,” Clint explained. Steve recognized that voice, but couldn’t quite place where.
“Turn on the a/c, all the way up,” Tony demanded. He closed his eyes. Frustration took over. He was getting all hot and bothered over hand holding, hand holding for god’s sake, how pathetic could he be? Steve didn’t even follow through on what it meant so it had to mean nothing. He felt a lump grow in his throat. “Jarvis?”
“Okay class,” Professor Fury’s voice cut through the room and everyone immediately went silent and shuffled as fast as possible to their seats. Following behind Professor Fury was his two assistants, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill.
Fury spoke, catching all the students’ attention. “The trial starts in two days. Tomorrow, I’m giving you all the chance to present a defense for the defendant. Stark?”
Steve set his laptop down next to along with his notebook. He rubbed his temple, feeling a pulsating ache starting. Day one of class and Steve was already struggling. He needed to write at least 100 defense claims to make up for being the last to present. He couldn't risk embarrassing himself again in class. Steve didn't care about joining Professor Fury's team, only succeeding in class. If he failed, he wouldn't near the end of it from Bucky.
Once everything was cleaned up, Steve followed Tony up to the balcony. They both sat on the lawn chairs placed out. Between the lawn chairs was a cooler.
Steve nodded, not looking up. He wondered what he had gotten himself into with this class. “My class is different from all the other law class,” Professor Fury finally spoke. His hands were clasped behind his back and he moved step by step behind his desk. “Unlike my colleagues, you will actually practice law and the way you’ll practice law is by doing so in the courtroom.” He stopped at the center of his desk. He scanned the classroom. He unzipped his briefcase and pulled out a clicker. He pointed it at the projector screen. A mugshot of a young woman with wavy brunette and dyed pink tips appeared on the screen. “Our first case, is the aspirin assassin.”
“Yeah,” Steve admitted. He glanced over to Tony, who was currently chatting with Rhodey. Tony carried out what Steve asked for. He could have easily planned a party without consulting Steve or not throw a party for Steve, but he did. Tony has been…more than a great friend. Something triggered inside of Steve and he knew right then, he’s in love with Tony.
Steve shook his head vigorously. “I’m not drunk, Tony. Tipsy? Yes, but not drunk and I know what I want and what I want is you, right now!”
“Pancakes,” Clint repeated. He started to get up, but noticed something odd. He pointed to the extra cup on the table. “Did Steve come here?”
“You’re very smart,” Steve pointed out. Tony knew that. “I heard that you might be our class’ valedictorian.”
Steve decided to explore the tower more and see all the hard work Tony put into designing the tower for the Avengers to use for their own benefit. Steve discovered Tony created a training room, equipped with training exercises and timed events. Tony said he based the idea off of another team who had something similar. Next to the training room was a standard gym with multiple of expensive workout equipments.
“Valedictorian?” Tony questioned. Tony grinned at the thought of being valedictorian, standing in front of the whole school, giving a speech, his father watching in the crowd maybe finally being proud of him- “Isn’t that too early to call?”
Concerning the previous barbecue, what Clint said did conflict his thought process. Tony didn’t love Steve. Sure, his heart would race whenever he was around Steve and yes, he does like spending his free time with Steve, and maybe he stares at Steve a bit too much, but Steve is a very attractive person, even a straight man couldn’t deny that. He’s just a man who enjoys Steve’s company, just like any rational person would. Besides, they were friends and its natural for a friend to want to plan their friend’s birthday party. He would do the same with the other Avengers if they hadn’t had a birthday party in over 60 years.
The others all reported having hazy memories following the mind control, like it was all a dream that has quickly faded upon awakening. JARVIS isn’t the only one with missing time.
“I just want everyone back,” Tony says. “I want you back. We shouldn’t have—we—“ He shudders. “God, Steve, we lost so much time.”
It’s because Steve doesn’t want to fight, and Tony… has no idea what to do with that (except he does: he keeps antagonizing Steve in hopes Steve will hate him, because hate, hate is a lot easier than love).
“I don’t need to sleep,” Steve says, and he’s already told Tony this. He doesn’t know why Tony is insisting on hearing it again, or why his voice comes out hoarse.
Tony waits for Steve to come to him. Steve always goes where he is needed, after all. Tony is hoping he will see reason, will choose Tony over what ridiculous notions he may be holding onto, but with the way he breaks into the building and frowns behind his cowl, Tony doesn’t think that will happen.
“Are you?” Steve asks quietly. He’s touching his wrist, where the metal band to cover his soulmark is. It’s a bright red, part of the Captain America suit. Tony’s eyes follow the movement before they flicker back up to meet those deep blue eyes.
“You were going to die! That amount of force, even some blond superhero of science like you can’t take it. Why did you do it?”
Steve looks at Tony curiously. Tony’s eyes, completely neutral, flicker over to meet his gaze fleetingly.
“Let me make you feel good. I want this. It’ll be the best you’ve ever had, nobody wants you more than I do,” he says, palming Steve through his uniform. Steve gasps, face crumbling, eyes sliding shut for a moment. “I’m never going to forget this either, Steve—”
Steve hisses, grabbing Tony’s arm, and there is a heated anger in his eyes. He looks so hurt. Tony recoils, jerking away, tail smacking Steve instinctively. He nicks Steve’s cheek and Steve lets go. They both know that Steve doesn’t have to—in terms of brute strength, the super soldier is stronger.
“Such as the one that magic must have a caster, and that there must be a cost,” Steve finishes for Loki. The others look at him. Steve shrugs. “It explains the random disturbances.”
“Tony,” Steve breathes, placing a hand around Tony’s neck, and pulls him in for a kiss, shivering when Tony gasps and touches Steve, fingers trailing downwards to Steve’s thighs. Tony tastes like what Steve never knew he could have, or even want.
Tony lies there on the ground, eyes shut. He stays there for the rest of the night, for hours, each moment wasted rotting him, but he just can’t get up without sobbing, until he finally drags himself up when the sun peaks in through the windows. He takes a shower, longer than he deserves, it’s not like it can really clean anything, and exits his quarters. He checks his eyes in the mirror one last time, but it’s probably not the last.
Yeah. Clint is going to be just fine. It’s the world that needs to catch up with the healing. “The memory lift came back. We pieced together the scene from what pieces he can remember. Ser, we’re going to need someone who can deal with a really high level of magic,” Natasha says. “And knows how to deal with this.”
“I believe you,” Bruce says. He glances towards Tony, who is contacting someone with a communication crystal, then lowers his voice. “Captain, I might be the one who’s studied the Knights’ antimagic for a living, but Tony knows, and cares, a lot more than he lets on.”
Steve hauls him to the washroom and slides Tony into his bathtub. Tony rakes the sides of the tub with his claws to get a grip. Steve doesn’t even make a sound, just turns on the water.
“When Heimdall told me the good Captain was on the way as well, I was delighted.” Thor smiles reassuringly. “Worry not. We are not weak like Midgard’s genies. We do not share the same limits.”
That is likely very true. Steve doubted it, too. He scans the room. The suits. Iron Man, Tony calls himself. He looks at Tony. “I think the problem is you don’t believe it,” Steve says. “The only person who needs to believe it for it to be true is you.”
“Steve.” Tony looks at him. “Steve, dear. You don’t need magic. You just didn’t steal a ripe fruit.” He shakes his head and laughs. “You stole a fruit—are you a fruit thief, is this going to become a thing? I don’t want to have to explain that to SHIELD when we come out of this.”
(And damn it, he still needs to stop thinking of it as Afghanistan. Obie made it clear that the torture is inconsequential. It’s the metal suit he built that matters. Don’t let the torturers have so much control over him, not when he’s made something so glorious. So why can’t he believe that, too?)
Tony huffs, lips twitching up. Amusement looks much better on him than bitter wariness, which Steve knows wears a person down. “Odin was kind of a dick, I’ll have you know.”
Tony sighs. He looks at Steve, as earnest as he can ever remember himself pretending to be. “I’m not trying to die, Steve. I didn’t say that. I’m trying to not kill.” The sad smile is probably overkill, but it works on Steve every single time.
Tony tilts his head, glances back at Steve. The edge of his eye seems to glint, reflecting all the blue light that glows from his fingertips. “You’re not exactly lauded for your stealth,” he says, and he’s right. Steve was never the one known for his stealth skills. “Otherwise SHIELD would’ve used you a lot more.”
“I know. You understand it. It chose you, too,” Steve says. “And I believe in you, Tony. Thanos even acknowledged you had a connection with the stones, didn’t he? You’re strong. You’re the strongest person I know.”
Steve can’t bear it. “Let’s go,” he says firmly, breaking Tony’s focus. The ball of magic dissipates, but an eerie dark afterimage remains in the air. Tony grimaces. “Ground zero isn’t here.”
The vendor hates it too. “The Scarlet Witch,” he snaps, “has done so much for us. She and her brother have made Sokovia a much better place.”
Anguish is colored blue, the same color Tony painted his sky. This is what the sky looks like when it’s falling.
Steve grits his teeth, thrusting into Tony’s hand despite the visible effort to not do so. When he spills, he holds Tony close and lets Tony rub against him, and he looks like Tony has stabbed him when Tony takes his hand and licks it clean and comes without being touched.
“I forgot,” Tony says. He didn’t want to stop. Their little escapade had been… fun. Now that they’ve paused on their little road trip, Tony’s not so sure they can restart it. “You should’ve left me in the prison, Steve.”
“I’m fine,” Tony says. The water sounds louden, stream morphing into a river. He flinches suddenly when a water droplet splashes onto his face. He wipes it away quickly. “Sorry.”
Steve takes out the scrap of parchment. He moves to hand it over, but Stark just leaves him hanging with a frown. “Can you read this?” Steve asks.
There’s no ice to shield Steve’s heart now, nothing to prevent him from feeling all the emotions he’s been trying to hold back. He feels mortality in him—he feels reality in him. He’s just as alive and real as any of them. Just like Tony.
Steve doesn’t need to ask to know what that expression is on Tony’s face. He doesn’t want to know why it’s fear, but can guess. Steve holds out his hand. “Let me help you steady your magic.”
“I’m a futurist,” Tony says. “I wanted to build a future, but was that the kind of future I’ve been building?” Broken and hollow and dark. He shakes his head.
Tony always says something flippant as the world crumbles around them. He’s used to dancing on the brink of death. Thor asks if he is courting destruction and teasing Death, and Tony just laughs.
“Lights, a hundred,” he rasps, scrambling towards the washroom. He reaches for his RT but finds no relief. This time the problem isn’t tech related, it’s mind related, and Tony has only ever been able to fix one of those things.
Most of the time, people take what Steve says as truth. “I can tell if the summoner has ill intent,” he says.
“Chaos,” Tony says. “Well, most people still use incantations, you know. Abracadabra, all the classic tongue-twisters.”
Tony looks surprised. “Okay, really, you would know that, how? You literally just woke up. Your armor, the adaptable dragon scale as it may be, doesn’t match the magic decay of this time yet.”
“I’m sorry. It wasn’t your choice, Tony,” Steve finally says, says first. The rage is gone. Or hidden. Tony’s not so sure anymore. The memories tell him that Steve could never hide his rage, but they seem to be faulty these days. Maybe none of them knew Steve as well as they’d believed. “I wasn’t thinking.”
“Tony. I care. Not just about everyone,” Steve says. “I didn’t… didn’t just do it for everyone. I did it for you, otherwise it would’ve—it would’ve taken you too.”
Steve tries to remember why he chose to join the Knights. He wanted to save people, even though he knew even if he bled out, there wouldn’t have been a drop of mana in him. He wanted to prove something, anything.
Captain America had ruined his childhood enough already, now he has to go and ruin the rest of his life, too.
“Why wouldn’t I be faring alright?” Tony asks, patting Thor’s hand lightly. “That’s rhetorical, don’t answer, I'm sure you gods are too busy to answer rhetorical questions. I’m here for something else.”
Tony doesn’t like the idea of Steve liking him on first impressions. He’d rather Steve be here as a recon mission, sent by SHIELD. He can definitely imagine Fury sending him. Good soldiers follow orders.
“I’m all for pranking the Captain, especially when it’s not my castle that’s being damaged,” Tony says, “but sadly there’s more we have to do right now.”
Tony wants to laugh, but then he thinks he might never stop. Penance, salvation, regret, these words (almost) mean nothing, not when compared to the knowledge that Captain America is falling apart in his mouth. There is nothing submissive in the way Tony can speed his heart up, can stop it at any time.
Tony pulls Steve down for a kiss—he needs to know Steve’s secrets, and he finds that he tastes blood on Steve’s lips already. He lets out a whimper—Steve tastes so fucking good, Tony sinks his teeth down, eliciting a surprised, sharp inhale. Tony’s still so hungry, his entire being aches, like he’s being pulled by gravity. He presses his claws against Steve’s chest, lightly enough to only draw red lines. He briefly considers carving his name here, on what is his.
He’ll have to find Steve. Maybe in the morning when Steve wakes up, Tony will be able to fix things.
She pats Tony’s back once and moves away, like that much human contact is too uncomfortable. Tony agrees. But it wasn’t so bad.
Giselle stops when the snow becomes too much for her to fly Steve. They thank her and Tony tells her to put it on his tab.
Annoyance flares inside Tony. But it’s fine. He’ll just show Steve that this Tony is the better choice. Freedom isn’t worth death. Nothing is worth death. Tony had been a coward to let it happen, let the world break when all he ever had to do was close his hands and grasp the solution that’s been right in his head all along.
Tony sighs and presses his lips to his wrist, wonders what a kiss from Steve would’ve been like. Maybe in another life.
Tony tries to think back. Tony’s own memories get fuzzy, sometimes. “Right about when we escaped the facility. You should’ve seen the other guy.”
The sudden light hurts his eyes, afterimages leaving spots in his vision, but they aren’t enough to blotch out what he's seeing. Forgotten things. Why can’t he process those flashes of memories? Is he—
This plan was, though, and this wound is worse than Tony planned it to be. He hasn’t eaten in a while. It messes with his regeneration.
“All the rune wars devastated the griffin population,” Steve says. “There was one made specifically to capture them, and after that...”
Tony laughs a little, breath hot at the hollow of Steve’s neck. He shakes his head. Damn it. The pleading note in Steve’s voice rattles him more than he enjoys it. “Please what? If you don’t want me, then fight back. You’re strong enough, aren’t you.”
Bruce looks over what Tony and Steve have gathered as information, “So you need to find out where this rune originates from,” he says.
“What happened to taking my advice on not using magic?” Steve asks, feeling weak that he can’t do anything for Tony right now. It’s his fault Tony had to use magic again. His fault they’re stuck here.
“You forgot,” Tony says, amused. Pleased. “I’m glad to hear that I was a good distraction. It’s okay to be scared of the cold. I’m not—not judging, seriously, I’d be the last person to play judge.” He bumps his shoulder against Steve’s. “Look, I don’t… I don’t offer something unless I want it too.” He looks vaguely alarmed by what he said. Steve’s heart beats a little faster, and his smile feels too honest, too open. Tony licks his lips, eyes flickering down and back up. ”Since it’s honestly hour, why not, right. I like your company.”
Damn it. Tony saw. “I’m fine,” Steve lies, the words heavy and his chest hurts, even when it shouldn’t, even when he’s really just a summon.
When the attacker relents, jumping back into the fog of the snowstorm, the motion is quickly followed by two bursts of red from Tony, pure, raw attacks, his magic lashing out. They chain together loudly, hitting nothing.
Steve smiles at Tony, hoping it will give them both strength. “The future is going to be a good place, with you,” he says.
Tony shivers. “Oh,” he says shakily. He sees Steve’s face and quickly smiles, “No, it’s fine, it’s just different. People usually… don't touch it. Can’t. It’s too much.”
He sees himself smile back at him, sharp and cruel, and he wonders if this is what he looks like to the world.
“What isn’t,” Tony says, and he’s amazed how steady he is right now. He’s frozen in horror, realizing that he himself is the one who has to be convinced, not Thanos.
Night falls. It belongs to Tony now, safe for all those who once feared it. Now, fear implies guilt.
Well, as far as he can tell from the contract that’s burned into his soul, Fury truly believes summoning Steve is the best option they have for the entire world. Steve can accept that. The few times he’s been in the wrong hands and not wanted to accept the contracts’ terms… they have not been easy. Thankfully, he’s always able to maneuver between loopholes. Not all summons have had that option.
Thor lifts his head up, glances at the throne behind him. “Ah, I am! Yes. The throne is treating me well. Thanks to Asgard’s people.” He smiles and looks to Tony. “Man of Iron! You have upgraded your iron.”
“I shouldn’t have this. Nobody should,” Tony adds, feeling Steve’s breath ghosting over his lips, voice cracking. “But I need to.”
“Congratulations. You figured it out,” Tony says. It’s a weird guess to sound so sure of, isn’t it? Cross one thing off the list.
Tony builds himself an armor. Keep others out, keep himself together, it’s an open and shut suit. If he’s honest, Iron Man is not just to protect other people. And he is honest about this, it’s not his fault nobody believes him. He never said he was a superhero.
“Oh good,” Tony says, “sure, remind us of those incompetent wish-warping genies, from Midgard, why don’t you. Thanks Thor.”
“Why do you never use that sleeping draft you have?” Steve asks. “I’m going to start thinking they’re poisoned.”
It’s kinda funny, isn’t it? Being disowned would’ve been better. Then Tony wouldn’t have to inherit Steve’s death from Howard, too.
Steve always has words to comfort others, always has undying faith even when the world is ending, and that happens a lot. It must be easier to save others than to save himself, right? Cap is a soldier, good at compartmentalizing even if that’s not a good thing to do.
In the end, Steve tries to get Tony to clear the area. He knows it won’t work, because Tony is Tony, stubborn like Steve, stubborn when it matters. And it always matters to them.
Steve gasps, hands coming onto Tony’s shoulders suddenly as if he’s realizing what’s going on, but not with enough pressure to actually push him away, just enough to make Tony pull back and pause. “No… Tony, I wasn’t asking for this. I can’t. You don’t have to do this. Not as—payment.”
“Move whenever,” Tony says shakily but gently, fingers carding through Steve’s hair. “Take your time. It’s okay. You're okay.”
“Yeah, under the influence,” Tony echoes. He should be better than that. “No, really, that’s fair, Steve. That’s.” It stings, and. “That’s fair.” He sees the hurt and guilt skittering across his face, because Steve never thought to guard himself from Tony, did he? “There’s always going to be a next time, Steve. And a last time. It’s kinda part of the job description. There’s not really a retirement plan, is there.”
Steve feels awkward, but he can’t let Tony see that. “Respect isn’t a joke,” he says, trying to maintain his usual cool composure, unaffected, like the memorial statues of the Captain.
He gives Obie the benefit of the doubt, because as much as he thinks he can’t believe or trust others, he really does want to.
“Okay,” Tony says when he pulls back and shifts back and down, mouth at Steve’s crotch, hands on Steve’s hips. “Okay. Let’s hope this works, hmm?”
Steve drops it. It’s not something he’s interested in discussing with Tony. All Tony seems to want to do is fight. “Do you think you are a hero, flying around and dealing with conflict like a rogue?”
Steve exhales, feeling his lungs ache, ice piercing through him. Tony’s magic is so alive, so close. When Steve stands by him, it feels like he’s being licked by fire.
When they fix reality, gold is going to be important in Sokovia again. Steve sighs after Tony leads them onto a different path.
A few days (yearscenturieslives) ago, if a situation like this happened, he might be thinking that maybe it’s long past the time for the shield to break, for his contract to fail, for the world to learn how to fend for itself. He might be thinking that the world shouldn’t need the Captain anymore. It always does, though, and that’s what Steve has realized. The truth of it just hasn’t ever hurt this bad before.
?” Tony’s voice wrenches him out of his drifting. Tony is almost touching Steve, hand hovering by Steve’s, close enough that it makes Steve shudder. He could reach out and grasp Tony’s hand right now. Tony has shifted his mask off again. He must be cold, too, but all he emits to Steve is heat. He glances fleetingly at Steve’s shield, doesn’t comment on its fracture. “No freaking me out here, got it? I’ve reached the freakout limit of my—my life already.”
“Try me,” Steve says, undeterred. He’s always ready for a fight, but that doesn’t mean he’s not always ready to listen, too.
“It’s good that you’re here to stop me, right?” Tony asks. “You know, I appreciate it. You, pretending it didn’t happen when it did.”
“Well, I’m weak, Steve,” Tony says, a shaky laugh bubbling out of him and yeah, he really does not need to have another breakdown right now, he should be better than this. “And who’s left?”
“The stones’ power, they cancelled each other out. I’m not sure how I’m… still alive,” Steve says. “I heard your voice.”
Steve tenses. His heartbeat quickens. He doesn’t withdraw his hand. “Tony,” he says hoarsely. “We can’t.”
to rest a bit? Even without the Scarlet Witch insisting?” Tony plays with the water in front of him, raising a hand out of the spring. The bubbles slip out through his fingers, drift towards Steve. They pop when Steve pokes them. “I won’t tell.”
“Well, never let it be said that sorcerers are ever subtle,” Steve says, blinking at the literal rip in reality in the distance, deep in the forest. It glows, a deep red, moving chaotically like something out of a dream.
Tony can’t lose Steve’s life again, but… there is a way, isn’t there? Strange saw fourteen million futures that diverged from that certain point in time.
Then, he just wanted to be able to get Captain America riled up and human so he could be able to say to Howard, see, not such a perfect soldier after all.
Steve sets foot in what appears to be a workshop. It’s messy, an order that only the man who makes it can see. He pauses for a moment to get a sense of the place, expecting Tony to attack him on sight. They said he was impulsive, a risk to work with.
Tony smiles at him, then starts a small fire in his palm. Steve shivers. It’s very bright in the dark, setting Tony’s dark eyes alight.
“Like I’ve unmade you? Huh. Or is it—oh I see you, now. Do you enjoy this?” Tony asks, laughing, because it’s all so fucking funny. He tried so hard, so hard to just—act human, with jokes and smiles and actual sex. For Steve. No point playing human now. Steve is right. “I’m so disappointed in you, Steve,” he says softly. “I’ll have your heart, Ste—
“Right.” His gaze sweeps over Steve. “So you admit that soul contracting is just glorified slavery.”
He says it so coldly that Tony realizes he really means it, is seriously considering it. His father is going to throw him away because he’s of no use to him or to Stark Industries anymore. People without living soulmates aren’t stable, aren’t reliable, aren’t worth the time or faith.
“Y’know, I was going to say that’s because you can’t have been in Novi Grad, it’s such a young city, but I thought so too,” Tony says warily.
He’s not so sure if what he proved turned out to be true. “Guess the world needs people like you, now,” Steve says.
“I wouldn’t have been fine,” Steve says quietly. He looks back at Tony for a moment, looking so sorry. “I have a reason to side with reality, and not the dream the rune wants you to make real. Who’s making you do this, Bucky?”
“Hm,” Steve says. “Politeness has really changed over the years.” He smiles, a hint of sadness on his lips. “Is that why people try to steal your work?” He guesses this is part of why Tony doesn’t work on weapons anymore.
“Alright,” Steve says. He hadn’t wanted to ask before, but Tony is hurt. His magic is hurt. “Your arc reactor. What is it for? Is it safe?”
That’s an oversimplification of what the Sorcerer Supreme does, and yet, it’s fairly accurate at the same time. Steve respected the Ancient One, but she definitely has had her fair share of lies of omission. Steve understands that. Sometimes, people prefer the history that’s a lie, the methods that are the same but are called something that sounds nicer.
“Hi. Sokovia’s sorceress, right,” Tony sounds so friendly that Steve finds it weird. Tony was definitely not this amiable when he met with Steve. Though Steve supposes he did trespass. And threw a few barbs. It was in retaliation. Alright, so their first impressions had gone a little awry, but they were on much better terms now, he thinks. “Wanda Maximoff?”
“Hydra,” he repeats, shaking with the fury and ruin of a man who has lost his world. “The world is not right. So many people have died or lost themselves. Tony...”
“I don’t even know what you’re even fighting for.” Tony is so sick of this human, being so stubborn about something he won’t say.
In the end, time washes everything away. The tides will dilute the red, fading, failing, until they are nothing but seafoam, whispers of their story, their world, forgotten. Only the clear waters remain.
Pain shoots up Tony’s left arm. His hand shakes, it cannot stop. He feels a sense of déjà vu. He gasps sharply, stumbling forward.
He smiles at Steve and dares him to ask why, and Steve does. He asks every damn time, seems to really want to hear the answer, and Steve won’t give up, no matter how much he should.
He nods, not trusting his voice overcome with emotion as he is. Steve moves until he's covering Tony from head to thigh, and kisses every inch he can reach while he pushes his cock against Tony's. The first touch has him moaning against the skin on Tony's shoulder.
He stands still for a moment to hide his face in Tony’s neck and snicker against Tony’s skin, but having his eyes closed like that makes the world spin even more, and he pulls back to smile at Tony. When their eyes meet, Steve can’t help but burst out in giggles again.
The city has changed a lot since he last came here. Everything is fast now. Loud. Buildings look designed to try and reach our heavenly Father; huge expanses of glass mirroring the midday sky.
“Fuck,” he breathes out, dropping his phone onto the sheets and rubbing at his forehead. God, what did he do last night….
Tony smiles, not sure how he's lucky enough to have an AI friend who can convey quotation marks by tone of voice alone.
“Hey! You two! Stop being all lovey-dovey and give your vote for Jenga!” Clint calls out from across the room, throwing a marker cap towards Steve and Tony.
They're too big together, even for his hands, but still it feels like the most perfect thing as he starts to slide his hand up and down.
“My hero,” Tony laughs at the fumble, his heart swelling with fondness at the boyish look on Steve’s face. He’s never heard Steve laugh like this and he lets go of his worry, lets himself enjoy this moment, this camaraderie between his team, his family… and a very affectionate and giggly boyfriend.
Tony barely looks at the time but he knows it’s been upwards of an hour, maybe more. He minimises the windows and places the tablet to the side.
“There’s still a lot to talk about,” Tony shrugs, “with the…” he waves vaguely between the three of them, and it makes James pause. He’s pretty sure he would never fantasize a talk about feelings.
“You’re a disgrace to the name of science, Brucie,” He says, although his attention is divided and he walks over to where Steve is sitting, still looking at Tony with a happy smile.
"Fine, then I'll never tell you about that undercover mission in Algiers me and Phil ran," he says nonchalantly, taking a sip of his beer before bending over his work again.
Dummy. He hasn’t ever met a robot like Dum-E, and he’s not sure what to make of him. Dum-E chirps and puts down his ball, so he can gently prod at James’ metal hand. James’ first reaction is to rip the pincer off the strut, but he is here for a reason and refrains.
"All. Ev'ry… everything," Steve breathes. He thought about this, after a date. Or a sparring session. Or really just any time, feeling very ungentleman-y. He wants to treat Tony with the respect he deserves, but it's almost an inhuman effort to
JARVIS goes quiet at that and Tony is left with his own buzzing thoughts. Sighing, he pulls out his new phone and dials, waiting as the call connects, unsure of what he’ll say but knowing that he’ll feel better after talking.
“You aren’t drinking that?” Tony asks Bruce who has occupied 'his' armchair, the one at the best angle to see the TV, the rest of the room, and close proximity to the side table, which Tony has to walk past to reach the couch. “Knowing your physiology’s close to Cap’s, it might actually get you buzzed.”
“I like living on the edge,” Steve grins and licks the corner of Tony’s mouth and there goes Tony’s whole train of thought. His eyes close on their own volition and he’s
He might try to hide it, but Steve can tell Tony's worried. He can't say it's for nought, and it's Tony's correction that makes his internal alarms go off.
around him is almost on the painful side of too much. Almost. With the grip on Tony's hair he keeps him in place, until he is completely spent and collapses onto the mattress with a sigh.
play,” cutting a look at Clint who sticks out his tongue, “where we all go around saying something we haven’t done and whoever has done that thing has to take a sip of their drink. Or a shot.”
"That was the bee's knees," Steve says with a soft smile, gently running his fingers through Tony's curls.
“Beta JARVIS is online. Awaiting connection with the network. Diagnosis report number 7834 is read for perusal.”
Tony's eyes will be wrinkled at the corners while shining with mirth. He knows, and he's very fond of that look, but not when he's absolutely soaked in bird shit.
He's got an ace up his sleeve, though. "Twice," he adds, surging forward again to press his lips against Tony's and rub his cock against Tony's hips.
Steve gasps. He has never seen the arc reactor like this, and for a second he can't do anything but gape at the glow of the bluest blue. It's breathtaking. As gorgeous and inventive as its wearer.
“Hey, big guy. You sure the mead isn’t getting to you a bit?” He asks, teasing him slightly but mostly concerned.
Tony’s breath seizes up at the feeling of the pointy end of the sword digging in under his sword. It holds his head at an upturned angle looking into the blond’s bright blue eyes.
Tony in addition to just seeing him, James is starting to feel for him as well. Tony so obviously, totally, completely throws his whole self for grabs at Steve,
He pulls back to grin at Tony, the recollection of that day clear behind Tony's eyes. It had been a disaster, but a fun disaster, with both of them unrepentantly cheating to win. Steve had fallen head over heels ever since those first moments together.
Thor salutes Tony, before downing his cup in one go, and he refills Steve's when he pours himself another one. Steve lost track of how many he's had now. Can't be more than two. Or three?
"It's the light. And the cold," James says quickly, before his stupid brain makes some more stupid assumptions.
care about the safety of others, or have you been corrupted that far already?" Steve demands, voice rising. He can't believe the callousness of this boy. "Everywhere this creature goes, death and destruction follow in its wake. I've seen entire villages lain to waste; every man, woman and child slaughtered, and
- and wow, Tony doesn't need that image on top of the other - and awkwardly rubs the back of his neck.
There is one promising moment when -- through some manipulation -- Steve and Tony end up on the roof terrace instead of inside the restaurant (all Stark's billions are worth nothing against a threat from the Winter Soldier). Soon Tony's teeth are chattering and Steve scoots close to offer him his jacket. James holds his breath when they smile so sweetly at each other and Steve holds onto Tony's shoulders longer than necessary.
resting casually on his knees as if breaking into someone’s place and waiting for them with a sword was just another Tuesday.
“Fuuuuck, Steve!” Tony cries out, gripping his bicep, feeling the muscle move underneath his palm with every movement of Steve’s hand, “Jus’ like that, baby, feels good.”
Steve smiles at Tony and puts his arm around Tony's shoulders. Their relationship is still new enough to make him feel all giddy at every touch they share, his stomach doing this odd swooping thing.
"No, Steve," Tony protests, holding up his hands in defence as he backs away. "I had nothing to do with this, I'm just an innocent bystander who happens to invent appliances that run on vibranium and talk Mandarin when they're sleep deprived. Besides, it could be good for your--"
A flickering catches Tony’s eye as he speaks and he glances over to the overhead light blinking in morse. C...O...A.
"It's okay, I'm glad you're here now," Steve smiles, and leans in a little to press a kiss to Tony's cheek. Because that's what boyfriends do. And Tony has the absolute best cheek, all handsome and soft. (His boyfriend!)
“I gathered Clinton has had his 100th brush with death today, but escaped her evil clutches once again!”
. It’s probably just heartburn. The way too much alcohol and not enough food kinds. Not… anything else with heart in the beginning and a different b word at the end. Something that rhymes with fake.
With JARVIS’ words, Tony’s reminded of the AI’s namesake and the kindness he exuded. What would Jarvis do? Certainly not gawk at the person losing their shit without helping.
“I’m okay. Don’t need you stupid magic people coming and fucking up my equilibrium with your stupid soulful eyes and stupid names like Polemistés and Bucky.”
He's aware he's bypassing Tony, undoing whatever it was that caused the young man to lean in and trust him, but this is too sudden. Too monumental.
"No!" Steve yells, but it's too late. He runs after them but there's no way he can keep up with the carriage once it picks up speed, misshapen and sickly as he is. He falls to his knees on the soot covered road and weeps.
“God, look at you, you’re so...nngh,” Tony’s words end on a moan as his heels dig into Steve’s ass when Steve lifts himself a little to watch himself thumb over the head of Tony's cock.
Steve realizes at the same time as the demon that it isn't bound, and he watches with horror how it takes a step forward. It's then that the demon turns its head to gather its bearings, and Steve gets a full frontal look of its face.
He stops his trek at the lounge chair when his eye falls on the sketch book that lies open on the ground next to it.
"Because you can tell by the way their blobness vibrates at the corner, right?" Tony snarks, but Steve can't afford to smile at the joke.
Doombots. Why is it always aliens or Doombots? It’s like Steve and his team are starring in a poorly written action series. (Steve might’ve developed an addiction to these in the last months, with Batman as his favourite one so far.) They're small ones this time, resembling cockroaches of a foot long that skitter up all available surfaces.
He stands, and in four long strides has he closed the distance between them and is holding his swordpoint at the boy's throat.
"If you say so, sir. Systems are fully back online, Home Alone protocols reinstated. It's a pleasure to meet you, mister Polemistés."
Tony looks up to see Steve managed to put the flowers down on a relatively chocolate free space - the floor near the elevator - and is standing next to Tony with that huge, goofy grin of his that spells trouble with a capital T.
There have been other times where he had the opportunity to disappear. The recollections are vague, they'd done their best to erase them, erase all that amounted to him being
He’d be a little offended but then did also leave the guy to have his crisis alone and had been working on plans for the targeting missile that had been rattling around in his head. He’d much rather be working on bolstering JARVIS’ code, making him take cyclic backups in offshore servers, giving him more control to protect himself in case something like what happened twice in the past two days happens again. But after Sunset ran away with some proprietary designs and more insider information than she should’ve, Tony needs to appease the board, to show them that he’s capable of leading the company.
“Sorry we weren’t here sooner,” Steve suddenly says with that sincere face of his, breaking James’ reverie.
“Hey, easy, soldier,” he replies, placing a hand on the broad, tense shoulder in front of him, softer than he would have if the traitorous second thought hadn’t come into his head. Or maybe not because he can justify that he’s just trying to match the guy’s energy - the soft, understanding tone that he was using on Tony. Which totally didn’t affect Tony one bit. No siree.
Whatever smart thing Steve might've come up with is moot when suddenly the Avengers alarm sounds and everyone jumps up.
“You didn’t know… you didn’t know he was a - what he became,” he vocalises, coming to the realisations as he speaks, turning them into words of comfort - whatever paltry comfort someone like him can offer.
