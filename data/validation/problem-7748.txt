“Would that be all right?” Steve asked, with an almost touching earnestness, stilling his fingers inside him for a moment, like he actually thought Tony might say no.
“You’ll pay for that, Rogers!” Brock called out after him, anyway.
“Good,” Steve said again, not quite able to track enough to think of another answer.  “G-green.  Green, Tony.”
of pain that had Steve crying out, full-voiced, almost a whimper, and bucking up back against Tony, he couldn't help himself, and then Tony fucked into him again, and there was blood rushing back to his nipples, back to his painful, bruised, sore, aching tits, and then Tony’s hands came back, fingertips massaging into the sore flesh, rubbing into the flesh, sliding up toward his nipples like he was milking a goddamn cow, squeezing warm where his nipples were already on fire, tugging at them, and Tony’s cock pushed past his sweet spot and the pleasure surged through Steve, was everywhere inside him, over his skin, every raw, sensitized, desperately firing nerve-ending, and Steve came again without a single touch to his throbbing cock.
Steve knew he was going red now.  He was probably red down to his damn
“You’re always a picture like this, Rogers,” Brock said almost fondly.  “So desperate, princess.”
He tugged Steve down beside him, like that.  “Good job,” he muttered, and Steve felt warm, because he’d said he was
“’m good,” Tony panted. And it was true, there wasn’t as much of the strain in his muscles, in his thighs, as he usually felt, and Steve had gotten him good and wet, good and open.  To prove it, he lifted himself up with his thighs, pressing his calves against the floor, until a few inches of Steve slid out of him, rocked himself over it, then let himself slide back down.  The feeling was utterly overwhelming, not even exactly pleasure, just intense
Tony’s face was burning, but Steve’s big strong, warm hand was rubbing at the back of his neck, so sweetly and perfectly, and he felt so soft and warm and relaxed, Steve still deep inside him.  He felt sweet, relaxed, easy.  He let Steve stroke him, praise him.
Eventually, though, after a long time, when Tony’s skin was really, really warm and starting to look adorably red, Steve put down that one, too, leaned forward and put both hands on Tony’s luscious rear cheeks and squeezed.  Tony yelped, jumped, shivering, gave a tiny little choking moan as Steve rubbed his thumbs along the inside of his crease.  “Awful warm here,” Steve said, gently teasing, and Tony moaned again, gasping, squirming under him.
Tony’s face darkened, and he saw, as if in slow motion, his mouth form the words
He gave Tony’s cock one last soft squeeze, rubbing teasingly at the head where he was most sensitive, and Tony gave a whimpering little soft punched out moan, all breathless and rough, and then tugged his hand away.  He had to adjust himself again, couldn’t resist the temptation to rub at his own cock just a little before he pulled it away.  Tony was just so beautiful in his pleasure, when Steve teased him, worked him up like that, and the best part was that Tony loved it, too, loved when Steve teased him, worked him up, made him want and left him wanting for a while.
Tony’s smile was still a little strange, but something relaxed around his eyes.  “Same goes for you,” he said.  “Knock ‘em dead, Steve.”
“Yeah,” Tony managed on a heavy, dizzy breath.  “That’s it.  That’s just exactly it.  You look so good on my cock,
Steve swallowed, told himself that it was pointless to ask again, now that Tony was so deep he would agree to practically anything, and that Tony’s earlier consent was enough, he had to trust him, trust his word, and then got the strap up in his hand, took a deep breath.
“What, you think I don’t mean it?” Tony teased.  “You think I don’t find you handsome?  You’re gorgeous, sweetheart.”
“Well, you are a little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” Tony said, but he was smiling now, slinging his skates over his shoulder.  He looked Steve up and down, and then said, “All right, a big ray of sunshine.  A very big ray of sunshine.”
“Mmmm,” Steve said.  “Wow.  Oh, wow.”
“Shh,” Tony said, and when Steve looked up, he was smiling again.  “No hardship,” Tony told him, and Steve knew that was Tony’s way of saying how much he liked this, lying here together, warm and soft, and relaxed.  He snuggled in to drape an arm over Tony’s chest, turn his face in toward the warm skin of Tony’s neck and press a kiss there.
Objectively, Tony did think he looked … nice.  Sexy, seductive, even, all vintage androgyny in a way he’d hoped desperately would turn Steve on, and it seemed to be doing the trick.  On his own, Tony would probably have opted for jewel tones and velvety fabrics, deep and rich, but he knew Steve loved to see him in sweet delicates, soft pastels, and he—he had to admit it was different, but not bad, made him feel even more fragile and vulnerable than usual.  He’d chosen baby blue and white, colors Steve often wore himself when he dressed up like this, or chose to put on Tony, to the point where wearing them almost made him feel like, like he was showing how he was, he was Steve’s, when he put them on.  He was all soft silk and lace today, like the white lace applique babydoll he was wearing, feathering down softly over his sides, just brushing the top of the garter belt, trimmed in powder blue that matched the corset-style lacing of his garter belt down the front, with a blue silk ribbon tying it closed.  He’d matched the powder blue shade with his eyeshadow, lined his eyes carefully and coated his eyelashes thickly with mascara, even curled his hair.
“Good boy,” Tony murmured again, pushing him down, pushing his knees out and down again, spreading his legs wide.  “Open up for me, all right, that’s my good boy, my good sweet pain slut, such a goddamn slut for pain he can’t help himself, right?  Can you, Rogers?”
“Jesus, took your sweet time, huh, sweetcheeks?” Brock said.  He was grinning as he appeared from around the corner, took a swallow of the beer bottle he was letting dangle loosely from one hand as he braced it on the corner.
“When it comes to you?” Steve asked.  “Guilty.”
Steve was still in that same pleasant haze as Tony coaxed him back up to his feet, rubbing his thumb along his mouth as he did, his bottom lip, crooking it gently between them for just a few moments, rinsed off his backside, his buttocks, nudged Steve into gripping the sore skin with a gasp and spreading himself so Tony could rinse off his crack, into the sensitive skin of his hole, rubbing at him with two fingers, opening him on them just enough that Tony could push them inside and rinse him out a little, spreading the water inside with his fingers and not the spray itself, murmuring softly to him all the while, praising him, until the very humiliation of the cleaning had Steve feeling even more dizzy and good, hazy and bright and wonderful.
And fuck him, if it didn’t sound good.  If it didn’t sound like exactly what he wanted right then.  Steve didn’t—hadn’t known what was wrong with him—he still didn’t.  He just knew that something had gone bright and hot all over inside him, had rushed down to his cock and made it jerk, leaking wet and hot up against his pelvis, just at the thought of being
“Rumpy pumpy?” Tony suggested, eyes gleaming wickedly.  “Frickle frackle?  You gonna bend me over and show me the fifty states?  Let me lick your candy cane?  Jingle my bells?  Give me a ride on your sleigh?  Fill up my stocking?”
Tony gave a desperate, aching groan, though, and so Steve opened his eyes again, saw Tony looking at him pleadingly, licking his lips eagerly.  Steve helped him work himself down, until Tony could brace himself with both arms and lower his mouth over the tip of Steve’s cock.
It was hard to think about anything else once he was under the water.  It beat down on his shoulders and chest and rear with a kind of burning intensity, flaring all his soreness and raw skin into immediate, throbbing pain, but a kind of pain that felt good, cleansing and perfect.  He wavered, gasped, must have, because Tony pressed another kiss to his temple, to the side of his mouth where it hung open, wet and slack, even as his hands came up to slide gently over Steve’s shoulders, and he murmured, “I’ve gotcha, stud, I’ve gotcha."
When he woke up, he felt very, very cold.  He was shivering.  Brock wasn’t inside him anymore, and his hole felt wet and sticky.  Messy.  He dragged his knees up toward his stomach before he opened his eyes, realized Brock had tugged the blankets back off him.
“Like what you see, big fella?” he teased.
his cock—but.  Well, it had made him feel really good.
Steve felt himself go warm all over, like he stepped into sunlight, like he’d been submerged in a warm, comforting bath, his skin tingling like Tony’s words were the rays of the sun against it.  He shivered, pressed his wrists against Tony’s neck, clumsily trying to cradle his head, twist himself up for a kiss, felt himself smile even wider.  He’d done just what Tony wanted.
There was a reason he’d over-applied his lipstick so copiously.  Tony wrapped his lips around the head of Steve’s cock and sucked, playing at the tip, pushing into the slit, with his tongue, hearing it as Steve panted, moaned, loudly, trembling under him, then pulled off and looked, pleased, at the red ring of lipstick that had left, cherry-red and incredibly sexual, just under the head of Steve’s cock.
But maybe he could … introduce himself to Stark?  He was sure the other skater wouldn’t remember him; it had been years, and—well, Stark had been through a lot in the intervening time.  But everyone else was visibly giving him such a cold shoulder, and it didn’t seem right to just leave him there with everyone pointedly ignoring him. Steve was the one Stark had beaten out at Nationals and pushed into fourth at Worlds.  If he said hello, maybe it would ease that freeze in the air a bit, somehow.
That was when the Avengers alert went off.
Steve spent long minutes after licking into him, soft and hot and slick, the muscles of his strong tongue insistent but soft on his inner walls, until Tony felt like he was wet, dripping, shivering with the gentle wetness and pleasure of it.  He could feel himself slowly relaxing into it, despite the invasiveness, the hot wet warmth and demanding slickness in a place that felt so strange for it to be, and then Steve reached up with one slick hand, still holding Tony open with the other, and started to rub at Tony’s now free cock, stroking it gently, tugging at it, smoothing his palm soft and smooth over the head, and Tony sighed low and trembling, shivered, rocked forward into that strong, firm, callused palm, feeling himself really relax.  Steve was licking deeply into him, letting it go slick and wet so that Tony could feel the cool air against the skin over his damp ass cheeks, the heat of Steve’s breath, his mouth, deep inside, even as Steve continued to massage, to tug at, his cock.
“You’re so good,” Steve murmured, still smiling, his eyes fluttering closed as he leaned in, let their foreheads press together, gently, hands sliding up to stroke through Tony’s fluffy curls, pushing them back off his face and making Tony sigh, close his own eyes in pleasure as his fingers tugged lightly in his hair, before Steve pressed a warm, damp kiss against Tony’s smeared, swollen lips.  Tony heard, felt himself moan, arched up into it, braced himself against Steve’s sides as he leaned in against him, and when Steve pulled back, Tony felt dizzy, hot, panting, and Steve’s lips were red with his lipstick.  He smiled, reached up to rub his thumb against them.
“Yeah,” he breathed.  “You do that for me, all right, champ?  Get your hand around your cock and think about how my dick felt in your mouth—how I tasted—all hot and heavy, huh?  Filling your mouth up really nice, all hot on your big strong tongue, big fella, yeah, you’re doing so great, Steve; you’re perfect.  Damn, you look so good; never going to forget you like this.  You look incredible.  Can’t wait to see you come with my dick in your mouth.  You’re gonna come for me, right?  I want to watch, I want to see you shoot off like this, cover yourself in your own spunk while you hold me in your mouth, huh?  I bet you want that, too.  You like it when I watch you come, don’t you, Steve?  Sure, it embarrasses you, you flush bright red, but that’s part of why you like it so much.”
“Tony,” he groaned, through his wet, soft lips, his own voice so low and groaning and husky he almost didn’t recognize it.  Tony just grinned, smiled and rubbed at his hot, prickling tit with his thumb, along the curve of it, up under his nipple and over, and Steve gasped, squirmed under him.
Tony gave a breathless, disbelieving little laugh, with a catch in his throat like it was almost hysterical, and there was a strange sheen in his eyes.  “Okay, yeah, there you are,” he said.  “Now you decide to join us, right, of course.  Doing a great Capsicle impression there, big guy.”
“Okay,” he said, practically under his breath.  “Okay.”
Tony felt like he had done that for a long time—his thighs were trembling as Steve stroked them, gently, up and down, murmuring breathless praise, rubbing at his thighs, at the backs of his knees where he knelt, up over his ass—but it was like he’d lost his sense of time, like it had ceased to matter, because it wasn’t like he was going to get hard, wasn't like he was going to come.  There was just him and Steve’s cock inside him, and Steve hadn’t come yet, that was all he knew, really.  So actually it couldn’t have been that long, because Steve never took all that long to come the first time, but it felt like a long time, and Tony’s breath was burning in his throat as he panted, when Steve cupped his hands against Tony’s ass and squeezed, stilling him on his cock.
.  Not like this.  Not now.  Not with him.  And—and when Brock called him those things—part of Steve burned with shame, even while his cock sat up and took notice, even as he gasped and arched his back and ground down onto Brock’s dick or his fingers, desperate for more, and he wasn’t sure—wasn’t sure which one was the real him.
“I do want, fella,” Tony said, smiling.  “Don’t think less of me, all right?  I’m just doing this because you’re my steady.”  He let the skirt fall back over his garter belt, then fell to his knees, turning around so his back was to the mirror, hopefully giving Steve a nice view of his backside as he slid his hands up Steve’s bare, powerful, hot flushed thighs and closed them in his briefs, pulling them down to Steve’s knees in one gentle yank.  Steve’s dick sprang free, already hot and flushed and drooling, foreskin partly retracted to reveal the pretty head, flushed pink and slickly, shiny wet with precome.  Tony stuck his tongue out, leaned forward to lick at it, drag his tongue over it, slide it around the sensitive hot wet skin, so hot on his tongue, slurping and curling it wetly like he was licking frosting up off of it.  He knew it had to look amazingly lewd, sexual, between his cherry-red lips, and also knew that Steve was incredibly visual when it came to sex, so he wasn’t surprised when Steve sucked in his breath like he’d been shot, his abdominal muscles clenching, fluttering, and his cock jumped under Tony’s tongue, leaking soft needy spurts of precome against it. “Mmm,” Tony said, and licked it up. He rubbed at Steve’s thighs, up over his belly, and then leaned down, taking that big, blunt, wet, hot cockhead into his mouth.
Tony couldn’t help it, he moaned at that.  “Oh,
Tony was obviously flustered now, avoiding Steve’s eyes and practically sputtering.  “I—I,
“That’s a first,” Tony muttered.
He was all right, Steve thought.  He should tell him he was all right.
“Thanks,” he murmured. “For lookin’ out for me.”
Steve blinked, his brain still feeling soft and thick and slow, and licked his lips.  “’Course,” he said again, swallowing against the hoarse words.  “Every time, Shellhead.”  Tony was holding him, and it felt so, so good, his arms around him, his body against his, blanketing him.  Tony’s body was keeping him warm, he thought, and smiled to himself, floating on it.
Steve apparently took that as a request for
, Steve thought, still a little painfully, men sometimes dated other fellas now, out in the open and everything—he wanted to, but who had a wonderful relationship with Ms. Potts, where they had date night together every Saturday, and half the time it seemed to be just staying in and having dinner together and . . . .  And it was wrong to be jealous of what they had, Steve told himself, firmly.  At least, of course everyone wanted that, a relationship like that, or he figured they did (he definitely did), but it was wrong to be jealous of it in the way—the way he was.
He bet if he’d had a vagina he’d have gotten really wet for Steve.  He wondered if Steve would have liked that.  He bet Steve ate pussy really nice.  Even if he didn’t, Tony could have taught him.  Tony knew all about it.  It’d have been like how Tony had helped Steve learn how to suck better cock, taught him all his tricks.  Tony sighed pleasurably, fondled his soft cock a little more, feeling at the sensitivity, letting Steve stroke his stomach, his sides, his thighs, watch him in the mirror.  Steve’s gaze kept focusing on his mouth, and Tony smiled, feeling pleased at that. Sexy.  Steve had really liked that lipstick, huh?
“So, so good,” Steve promised him, still petting his hair, and saw Tony’s lips quirk up into a tiny, pleased smile.  “That’s it,” Steve told him.  “Good boy. So good for me.  Taking that so perfect.  Sucking me off so damn nice.”  He reached down between Tony’s legs as he spoke, hitched one up and out to the side, exposing him just enough to give Steve a dramatic view of Tony’s still very hard cock, hard and red and wet and needy, then used his arm around Tony’s thigh, above his knee, and another around his waist, to hoist him up, drag him back into Steve’s arms, back to his front.
. “I’ve gotcha.”  He ran his hand down over Tony’s shoulders again, down over the slope of his back, very damp and sweaty now, and squeezed one still rosy pink curve of his rear, before he took a step back, teased the tails of the flogger up over Tony’s leg, then tossed them back again and started on Tony’s rear and thighs.
“It is, though,” Steve said, and reached down between Tony’s legs, hefted it gently in his hand. “Soft like this, too, sweetheart. It’s one of the prettiest cocks I’ve ever seen, and I love how it looks on you.”  He squeezed it, gently, and Tony trembled under him.  Steve kissed his shoulder, ran his fingers back, stroked his hole a little, softly, with his fingers.  “This is pretty, too,” he murmured, as Tony trembled as the oversensitized skin, the tender muscle, was massaged by the tips of his fingers, “so smooth and soft right now, and it’s easy for me to do,” he crooked his fingers gently inside, pumped them in and out until Tony was gasping, “this,” he said, “so sweet and open.  Just for me, huh?  You only open up just for me like this, so sweet and open and soft and relaxed.”
“I’d finger you a little, but I don’t want this oil getting in there, sweetheart,” Tony said after a moment, “and it’s all over my fingers right now.”
“I hear you,” Tony said, a soft, fond smile curving one side of his mouth, lopsided and rueful and warmly tender, as he pulled back, and Steve had to catch his breath, it sent so much emotion through him, pulling tight in his stomach, surging in his breast.  “So,” he said then, still squeezing at Steve’s nipples, stroking and rubbing them like they were the controls to some advanced plane or computer readout or something until Steve was trembling all over, groaning on each breath, shivering down to his toes.  “How do you feel about clamps, stud?”
A moment later the spray was on, hot and filling the space with steam immediately, just how Steve liked it, almost too hot to stand it.  Tony was already turning pink, which was adorable.  Steve gave Tony an appreciative look, belatedly realizing Tony had stripped off at some point and was finally naked—the lush muscles of his strong thighs, the high, beautiful curve of his rear end, the sleek strength of his shoulders and back and chest, the way his pretty cock hung between his legs.  Tony saw him looking, because he grinned and raised his hands above his head, stretching them back and shaking his hips and rear in a way that made Steve swallow a little convulsively.
“Well, I’ll give you that,” Steve said, with a little laugh.  “Guess I don’t need to be able to say it if I can do it, right, Stark?”
, Cottontail.”
“Doing good?” Steve murmured, and Tony nodded, his head spinning, his body throbbing, aching for something, needy and hot.  He ground his hips down against Steve’s fingers, looked up at him questioningly. “You want me inside?” Steve murmured. His fingers petted at Tony’s cheek gently, slid over the back of his neck, petting through his hair, and squeezed. “You ready for that, mister?”
“Sorry,” he said.
Anyway, that had been the first time.  Brock had had him three more times that night, and let Steve rub off against the bed while he fucked him one more time, though he’d made Steve beg for it, again and again, and he’d let Steve kiss him, again, after, twine his fingers in his hair and taste sex and musk and desire on his tongue, had let him use his shower (Steve had slid two fingers inside himself, marveling at how easy it was to relax the muscles now, even though they were raw and sore and red and flinching at the abuse they’d taken, felt his wetness inside from Brock’s come and flushed, face hot under the hotter spray even as he turned into it and closed his eyes, floating high and dazed and dizzy on the beautiful hot self-consciousness of it all, even as he worked his fingers inside, cleaned himself out as best he could), had even fed him breakfast.
“You came so beautifully for me,” Tony said immediately, warmly, and Steve flushed, ducked his head down, but he also smiled, enough that his eyes crinkled up.  Tony rubbed at those little eye crinkles gently with one finger, then slid it up over Steve’s eyebrow.  “Gorgeous,” he said.  “You’re so gorgeous when you come, handsome.  I love seeing you overcome with pleasure, just lost in it, giving yourself over to something so good.”  He stroked his hand back through Steve’s hair.  “Did that feel good?”
So yeah, he knew Tony had been fretting himself over Steve being reckless.  That was why it was so ironic that when it actually happened it was total chance—Steve hadn’t expected anything like that, hadn’t even been thinking about it. Maybe he should have been, but he honestly didn’t think the A.I.M. cell they were chasing had had time to set up any kind of explosives in the area—they’d chased them out of the area where they’d set up their base, hadn’t they?  That was miles away.  So when would they have done it, and why would they have done it over here?—so when he chased their attempt at a new super soldier into the abandoned building, he’d been more worried about the floor giving way under their combined weight or putting his foot through rotted floorboards than an explosion.
inside him, and he was so full, so thick, so
Tony kissed him eagerly, needy, opening his mouth and leaning into Steve, letting Steve push his tongue into his mouth, stroke it gently over his, filling his mouth up soft and wet and warm as Tony panted and trembled on his fingers and opened his mouth up for him, let him in, his cock aching, throbbing as he rocked back onto Steve’s fingers, up over his hips, against his chest.
practice,” he said.
“S-sorry,” he blurted.  That was it, what had been circling around his mind for months, that—“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
, and—and Tony was wonderful, and giving it to him, and—all he seemed to be able to do was moan, but he let his mouth hang open, wet and soft, and when Tony reached up toward his face, he turned his face toward his hand, pressed his mouth wet against his palm, and panted against Tony’s hand, hoping that it conveyed something of what he felt.
“I like the sound of that,” Tony said, looking down at him with the softest smile.  He leaned in, brushed a kiss over the lotiony tip of Steve’s nose.  “All mine, huh?”
“Now,” Tony said.  “Now that you’ve come, lovely, you can put all that enviable focus to work on me, right?”  He winked.
And then he’d slapped Steve’s rear the next day as they were suiting up, about to head out on a mission, snapped the strap of his uniform, of his shield, and Steve had flushed bright red and said, “Rumlow, not before a mission, cut it out,” and he’d just winked at him and he’d said, he’d said, “Well, what about tonight, big guy?”
“Mind if I do a few things, too?” Steve said, smiling a little fondly, sheepishly, now, playing with the strap of Tony’s garter.  “While you’re working on cleaning up for me.”
Steve beamed at him, smiled up at him.  “That’s good, Tony,” he murmured.  “That’s so good.  You’re so good for me.”  He slid his hands up, over Tony’s ass, his hips, slid them down over his groin, let his thumbs slide gently, pressing soft, against Tony’s neatly trimmed pubic hair, framing his caged cock, then slid them up again, over Tony’s belly, up over his sides, thumbed gently at his nipples.
“I am feeling good,” he managed to rasp out, his voice weak and reedy, really a hoarse gasp more than anything else.  “So, so good, big fella.  You’re so good with your tongue, you know that?  It’s so firm and strong on me, I can really feel it.  So hot and wet and around me.  I’m really loving that,
“Now, shush a moment, sweet thing,” Tony said.  “You did not leave me hanging, all right?  We can take a moment for you to feel good any time we do this, for you to enjoy yourself.  That’s what I want, all right?  Trust me, I was perfectly happy to watch.”  He leaned over, let his fingers trail up along Steve’s sticky, hot, wet cock, watching him as Steve’s eyes widened and a delicious shiver traveled through his entire body at the touch.  He slid his fingers up to the oh-so-sensitive head, rubbed his thumb against the tip, reveling in the wet, smearing slide of it, the way Steve choked on a breath and writhed, arching himself up off the bed even in his sideways position.  He slid his wet thumb down, rubbed at the sensitive spot just under the glans, just above Steve’s foreskin, pushing it down as he did.  “I told you to bring yourself off because I wanted to watch you, and you did,” he purred.  “You did
Steve gasped, writhed, losing himself in the white hot pleasure, tossing his head back, and his hands slid down, gripped at Tony’s hot sensitive shoulders, only half on purpose, and Tony cried out softly, wetly, a broken little hot needy cry, panting around Steve’s cock, and Steve did it again, barely noticing the way Tony rubbed his cock against the bed between Steve’s legs as he did, but still somehow logging it in the back of his brain, and then Tony was sinking down on him again and he couldn’t think at all, just enough to slide his hands back up and tangle them in Tony’s hair, holding his head, feeling his muscles flex with the effort of will it took not to just yank Tony down on his cock and thrust up into his sweet, perfect throat.
known what that meant until Brock had explained to him in exhaustive detail one night, after he’d fucked Steve twice and gotten four fingers up into his hole, and was using his hold to make Steve jerk and jump on all fours, laughing at him and calling his hot little cockpuppet, his slutty hand-sleeve, his loose pussy, because that’s what he was, Brock had said, a hole, a gaping, hungry hole—and Steve had come, when Brock teased a finger along his prostate and slapped at his cock and called him a hole.  His face burned.  He wondered again why he was like this.  How could he like this, to be demeaned, to be slapped, to be spat on, to be—
“Please,” he gasped, barely any sound behind it, barely a whisper.  “Please, that—that felt good.”
“Okay,” Steve said. “So long as you’re feeling good to keep at it.”
Tony dragged in a breath, tried to remember how to breathe.  “Whole different story,” he managed, took another breath.  “Yours isn’t the first cock I’ve gagged on, sweetheart,” he said, letting his tongue drag over the words.  “I’m a full service throatfuck.”  Steve’s brows drew together, and he flushed a very deep color of red.  “I have a
Hadn’t it been?  Steve forced himself to think, not just respond, even though his thoughts felt hazy and thick, soft and slow.  “More, Tony,” he said finally, hazily.  “Sir.  Please.”
.  Everything in Steve’s body pulled tight and soft at the same time at that, hot and needy, on fire with want.
“You know I do,” Steve breathed, fighting the urge to just sink to his knees in front of Tony, press his face to his thigh, wrap his arms around his hips and thighs, maybe suck his cock, if Tony wanted him to.  Tony pranced back over, shaking his hips and all, and gripped Steve’s hands in his own, smiling down at him, running his thumbs over the backs of his hands, before he pulled him up.  Steve just let him, let Tony slide his hands under his wrists and brace him, use all that strength to help lever him up to his feet, watching the flex of Tony’s muscles with dreamy appreciation.
,” Steve managed, trying a smile that felt crooked and lopsided on his lips just to try and soften it a little, lighten it and make it feel less serious, less
Steve nodded, his eyes dazed as he looked up at Tony, something wide-eyed and soft in his gaze, his tongue going soft against Tony’s cock, mouth hanging open.  He gave his own cock another tug and groaned, softly, in the back of his throat.
“No one could please me more,” Tony whispered, and he meant it, and the way that made him feel raw and naked and exposed was worth it for the way it lit Steve up until he was practically glowing.  His cheeks were red, his ears were even redder, and the flush went all the way down his neck, down his belly, when Tony glanced down at it, and he was beaming.
“Look at you leak, honey,” Tony murmured, warm and knowing.  He stroked his shoe up along Steve’s cock, pushed the sole against the wet, leaking, weepy tip of his cock, let it smear up and down the rough treads until Steve was whimpering, sucking at his own lips, his teeth, to keep himself from drooling helplessly, the only thing he could do, unable to wipe his mouth.
“There you go,” Tony murmured.  “I’ve gotcha, big boy.”  Steve gasped, moaned, just at the words, the confirmation of what he’d been thinking, a needy little
“Um,” Steve said.  His breath was warm, damp, feathering over Tony’s lips and chin.  He pushed his chest up under Tony’s hands, apparently unconsciously, and Tony obliged him, plucking gently at his nipples, squeezing and tugging, with both hands. He realized it was distracting, but he couldn’t resist giving Steve that little extra pleasure.  He kept fondling at his heaving chest, tugging at his nipple, with one hand, reached down with the other and rubbed at Steve’s cock, pulling on it gently, sliding his foreskin up over the head, until Steve was panting, hard and throbbing and furiously hot in his hand.  “Uh,” Steve said again, breathy.  His hands squeezed at Tony’s side, one coming up to his arm, almost kneading at the muscles.  “God, Tony, I—God.  That’s …” he was jerking his hips up into Tony’s grip, his cock very hard now.
“I hear you,” Steve said. “I’ve gotcha.”  He reached up, rubbed a hand over Tony’s shoulders. “I’ll give it to you.  At my pace, you hear me?”
—pushed inside him, almost easily just with his own precome to slick him up, God, two at once, and Steve was glad of that, he was already a little relaxed from before, and he could take it, he liked it, the sudden pressure and fullness, a little hot and dry and raw, a little bit of stretch, was enough to make him jolt, but also settled inside him like a comfort, heady and hot, the feel of Tony’s callused fingers firm inside him, filling him, the pure pleasure just in that, feeling the pressure, feeling Tony’s clever fingers crook into him, filling him like that, pressing into him inside.
“Sure thing, slugger,” Tony said, with another soft, warm smile.  “Anything you want.”
Steve gulped, his strong throat working.  Tony reached out, let his fingers trail down Steve’s cleanshaven throat, over his neck, his Adam’s apple, his pulse.  Steve shuddered under him, his fair skin flushing as Tony touched him.  “That, that’s what I mean,” he said, and took a breath, clenched and unclenched his hands, then pet awkwardly at the sensitive skin on the inside of Tony’s thighs and had him shivering all over with the sensation, the simple vividness of that touch.  “That’s what I mean,” Steve muttered again.  “That’s—I know you do.  That’s why I—I mean, you worked at it, right?  Learning how to—to take it any way.”
Tony was kissing down his spine, groaning as he thrust into him, his cock still kissing over Steve’s sweet spot with every thrust, but a bit wilder now, harder, and that was what Tony felt like when he was feeling good, getting into it, and that made everything in Steve feel sweet and pleasurable as honey, slow and sticky, like lolling out on his back in the grass on a warm day and feeling the soft spring air on his face.  That was almost better than the heightening pleasure each thrust of Tony’s sent through him, or the pain in his chest, or the prickling sensitivity of his sore rear end every time Tony’s hips thrust up against it.  He felt himself whimpering, his cock leaking, just at that sign of Tony’s pleasure.  The head of it felt so sensitive, wet and achy, and he could feel himself dripping.  Oh, lord, he was so messy, he felt so good, he felt . . . he
“So sloppy,” Brock’s voice came, replete with satisfaction, and Steve buried his face against his arm and gasped.  “So damn wet for me.”  Fingers tracing along his sore rear, along his crack, over his sticky hole, nudging inside and pulling until Steve gave a heaving breath that made his chest burn like he’d run a whole marathon in just the amount of time Brock had spent fucking him.  “Mmm, I bet you want more,” Brock said.  “Bet you want that slutty hole filled.  Bet you wanna come.”
Steve’s jaw set.  “Better, then,” he said.
it, sweetie pie.”
“Bunny.  My cuddle bunny,” Tony said, patting Steve’s belly.  “I’m not the only one with a nice tight pair of
Tony winked and sucked off the whipped cream and the cocoa clinging to the marshmallow, then pulled it into his mouth with his tongue.  It sent heat shooting down Steve’s spine, pooling in his belly and his dick, and he shifted, very aware that his cock had come to attention and in his soft boxers and lounge pants was probably very obvious.
“No, I have, honey,” Tony said, his voice that low, husky, teasing tone that always went straight to Steve’s belly and made his cock stiffen.  “We’ve done your back, now it’s time to do your front.”  His hands smoothed down the front of Steve’s shoulders, circled over his pecs in a long, smooth swirl of his firm, hard palms, calluses catching against Steve’s skin, his nipples, and—oh.
“Still doin’ all right, sweet stuff?” Tony murmured, and Steve nodded, groaned, even though he could hear himself breathing heavily through his mouth, trying to catch his breath.  Tony braced Steve’s face in his hands, one against his jaw, and pressed a quick kiss to his cheekbone that had Steve catch his breath on a groan.  “Does that hurt how you were hoping?” Tony asked then, in another moment, and Steve groaned softly, again, but managed to nod.
“All right,” Tony said, smiling warily, brightly, as he dug in his bag and slid a pair of sunglasses over his eyes.  Steve had a sudden feeling he’d retreated behind a shield, a curtain, like a suit of armor, as he squared his shoulders, took a deep breath, and turned that stunningly bright smile on Steve.  “Let’s do this thing.”
Tony’s hand—the gauntlet—was on him a moment later. Holding him still?  But then both of Tony’s hands were on him, without the gauntlets this time, firmly feeling down his sides, pressing on his gut. Steve thought, with a dizzy, heady kind of flush, that Tony’s thumbs were pressing in right above his groin, even though he shouldn’t have been thinking that way at all when he knew Tony was looking for internal bleeding or obviously broken bones.  And it was—it was inappropriate, about a teammate, in the first place.  “I scanned you with the armor’s sensors,” Tony said, and Steve caught wisps of sound that time.  “No spinal injuries that I can see.  I’m sure it’s not news to you that you hit your head, huh, big fella?”
“Or so they say,” Natasha said.
“I’ve got some water for you,” he said.  “And a few snacks.  I thought I’d hand feed you.  How does that sound?”
“I . . .” it felt like a ludicrous question, but then Steve remembered how desperate he’d felt for a touch to his cock, anything at all, for so long in there.  But then Tony had touched him, he’d milked Steve’s last orgasm out of him for what felt like . . . like
, since they’d started, and Steve felt like he might just vibrate out of his skin.  His hips wanted to jerk so badly.  He felt so hot under his skin, like he’d gone molten from his core out.  His cock was on fire, all blazing heat and burning, hot sensation under Tony’s teasing fingers, so sore from his foot and now all sensitive pleasure from his fingertips.
“And you’ll stay here?” Steve asked, feeling selfish. Tony had so much to do, and he was keeping him here, tied to his bedside.  “Are you sure?  You don’t have work to do?”
Tony took a deep breath, had to blow it out.  He felt dizzy, warm all over, lightheaded, just looking up into Steve’s face—Steve Rogers, braced over him, staring down at him with determination, asking Tony to direct him how to suck his cock properly.  He could never have imagined this, not in a million years.  It felt wilder than his wildest fantasies ever had.
Tony panted, gasping, feeling himself stretch, letting his hand fall to his side, and there was a moment of pushing back, Steve’s cockhead sliding over him once, twice, pushing in bluntly and his ass resisting, trembling, the rim opening, stretching, but not enough, and Tony had a breathless moment of sucking in air, wondering if he was open enough
Steve wasn’t exactly surprised when Tony pulled his hands away, one cupping Steve’s hip, the other going back to the back of his neck as he pressed a kiss against his temple, another against his hairline, mere seconds before he was convinced he could have worked his hips just enough to come, the hot tight tension just beneath the head of his cock winding up, he was almost there—and then Tony was petting his neck, rubbing one hot palm against his hip, shushing him softly as Steve gave a wretched gasp that was almost tears and slumped against him; not exactly surprised, no, but it didn’t stop the desperate gasp, the feeling of utter betrayal that washed through him just for a second—or the way his cock throbbed even more hotly, heat twisting in his belly at the denial, a moment later.  He hated the feeling of being denied, of pulling back from the brink, unable to get there, his body so ready to tip over the peak but unable to, like he was sliding back down the side of a mountain he’d almost climbed, he
“I know you do,” Tony said.  “Trust me, slugger, I know that.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony groaned.  He bit his bottom lip, licked at it.  He could practically feel himself salivating.  “That’s the stuff.  Look at that big ol’ salami, huh?”
“I’ve always liked lingerie,” Tony said, but—well, it was true; Steve wasn’t wrong.  He wore panties all the time, they made him feel good, but playing it up like this, well, it sometimes made him feel self-conscious, embarrassed.  And not in the good, twisting, hot sort of way, necessarily.  Sometimes it made him feel—uncertain, strange, a little bit insecure in his masculinity.  He’d been a pretty boy.  One reason he’d first grown the mustache was to look more, well, manly.
It would be okay, he thought.  If Tony wanted it.  He stroked the inside of his thighs some more, slipped his fingers in between his legs and teased gently at the soft space behind his balls until he was panting, then stroked his balls gently, the base of his cock again, until Tony was moaning.  Only then did he smooth his hand up again, run it over Tony’s hot, rosy rump, a deep, deep scarlet now.
Steve pulled off, smiled up at him, eyes hazy, and just the sight of that, his face red, mouth messy and wet and swollen, his eyelashes low and heavy over his eyes, had Tony’s cock throbbing.  “Yeah?” he said, and God, his voice was already low, but that was nothing but a hoarse rasp, as if he too felt overcome, and it went straight to Tony’s belly and twisted up with heat, throbbed in his dick.  “Good,” Steve said, then, and then pushed Tony’s cock up with his hand, pressed a kiss against the inside of one thigh, then the other, against his balls.  Tony heard himself gave a high-pitched whimper and covered his mouth with one hand, pressed his open mouth against the back of it.  Steve smiled at that, and then dragged his tongue up along the underside, a long, dragging, perfect wash of heat, closed his mouth over the tip and sucked, bobbing his head up and down—not enough to hit the back of his throat, but enough to give Tony the feeling of fucking and oh, oh,
Tony murmured to him, soft and slow, kissed the curve of his ear.  He pulled his fingers out of Steve, and Steve heard himself whimper, then realized how hard he was gripping Tony’s hair and dropped his hand with a flinch of guilt, opening and closing his fingers as he realized how hard they’d been curling inward, and the flinch sent the weights swinging again and he gasped at the pain, the constant tugging pressure against numb, aching tits and nipples that throbbed and prickled despite being just as numb.  Steve blinked, and tears spilled over, ran down the sides of his face, out of his eyes.  He heard himself gasp again.
“Yes, for you,” Steve agreed, his mouth slow and heavy, as he leaned forward without opening his eyes, let his face rest against Tony’s, his mouth soft against the side of his neck.  He could feel Tony swallowing, convulsively, the way he moved his face in against Steve’s to brush his lips over his cheek again in the barest brush of a kiss.
“Yeah,” Steve said, a throb of excitement leaping hot and hard in his chest.  The idea of the pain, of having his clamped nipples weighted and pull and painful like that, the effort it would cost him, was good enough, made him feel hot and achy and wanting down to his toes, made his cock jerk and leak, but it was more than that, it was the idea of doing it
Tony made a sound, self-conscious, tilted his head down.
“Sweetheart,” Tony said, low and thick, and pressed a soft kiss against Steve’s hair, against his temple, that sent warmth through him, a gentle glow that made Steve relax against him even more.  Tony’s fingers carded gently through Steve’s hair again.  “You’re taking it easy, all right?”
That was a bit—well, it was true, of course.  Steve couldn’t blame him for that.  But that hadn’t been how he’d expected this to go.  He shook Tony’s hand all the same, tried a smile.  “We met before,” he said, sheepishly.  “Years ago, now.  I was … um, I was smaller then.”
Tony smiled at him, stroked his arm, reveling in the feel of the coarse hairs under his hand, the strong muscles and warm skin revealed by his short sleeves.  “Just like that,” he said.  “That’s just perfect.  Lovely.”  He smiled at Steve a little more, to show him that he didn’t just mean his position.  “Do you feel secure there, supported, like you have full range of motion?”
He was just dried off after the bath, and he’d dabbed on a little of the light vanilla cologne that had made Steve inhale him like he wanted to eat him for breakfast the last time he’d worn it (green and fresh and a little floral over vanilla and sandalwood and musk, it was gentle and green and tender and struck him as on the androgynous side of masculine, so he’d thought it would fit), and sure enough, Steve was taking deep lungfuls of the warm sensitive skin just behind Tony’s ear. He felt vulnerable and pretty and exposed and uncertain and incredibly turned on as Steve nuzzled in behind his ear, laid a kiss there, and took another slow, deep breath, stroking the front of his thighs and making Tony squirm.
“Y-yeah,” Tony breathed out, moved immediately to obey, pulling at the soft laces holding his panties together on either side until they pulled free and he could tug off the soft little scrap of silk, revealing the heavy metal cage pulling him down between his legs, his high tight balls with their metal ring encircling them at the base, holding them snug against the cage, too.  He dropped his panties on a nearby sofa cushion, then leaned forward, let his own fingers skim down over the cage, braced one hand on Steve’s shoulder. “How’s it look?”
“God, you’re beautiful,” Tony was whispering in his ear, and his voice sounded raw, taken apart, broken open, utterly.  He raised his hand, stroked it against Steve’s cheek, brushing away wetness that Steve realized was overwhelmed tears, turning it against his skin in a soft, lingering caress, rubbing his thumb against the curve of Steve’s cheekbone, slid it down, fingers and thumb swiping up the come that had landed on Steve’s jaw, rubbing it gently off his skin.  Steve took in a deep, unsteady breath, and Tony kissed the curve of his ear again.  He felt very very—soft.  Warm and floating and good.  He swallowed, gasped, and then felt himself smiling, soft and hazy, up at Tony.  “Sweetheart,” Tony murmured thickly.  “So good, Steve.  So good for me.  You did so well, sweetheart.  You did perfectly for me.  Coming just from your tits and your sweet little hole, huh?  Just how I wanted, you did just how I wanted.  Just perfectly.”
“Am not,” he said.  “Besides, I’m supposed to think you’re the most handsome man I’ve ever seen.  It’s all part of being a good boyfriend.”
Steve’s eyes were fixed on the cage, and he was biting his bottom lip, sucking on it, rubbing his hand on the caged underside again until Tony was shuddering.  “So, so pretty, Tony,” he murmured, voice going low and deep and sex-rough and more than a little New York, and there was a flush spreading hot and red down over his face, his neck, his chest, down over his nipples, his cock already hard and bobbing, leaking so much precome it was sliding down over the shaft, the foreskin, making it glisten.  “You’re so sweet, all locked up for me, aren’t you?  So good and obedient.”  He slid his fingers, his palm, gently up and down the base, making Tony shiver, making him leak a little more wet precome.  He could see it bead up at his slit, fall slowly to splatter onto Steve’s wrist.  Steve smiled softly, licked his bottom lip.  “And you still love my hand on you so much, sweetheart,” he said.  “Just look at you, all wet.  Leaking and sweet for me.”
, with his thumbs, his strong, already oiled hands.
“That’s Tony Stark,” Natasha purred, leaning over his shoulder.
“Thank you for this, Tony,” Steve murmured.  “You’re so beautiful, and you really look beautiful like this.  Even now, look at you.  You’re just so, so … so beautiful.”  He ran his hand down over Tony’s stomach, pulling Tony back against him, against his chest, between his legs, and Tony sighed, leaned back against him, looking at himself in the mirror.  He really did look well-used, all smeared smudged makeup and tousled curls coming down around his face, his soft cock between his legs, his belly heaving, his panties down his thighs, his stockings slipping down, garter belt and lace skirt shoved up around his belly.  He reached down, traced his fingers over the stockings, feeling the silky lace against his sensitive skin, rubbed his panties between his fingers, traced his fingers gingerly over his soft cock.
Tony heard himself moan, and then Steve’s mouth was back on his cock, sucking and hot as he moved up and down, bobbing gently, never taking Tony in far enough to flirt with the back of his throat, but still an intoxicating, dizzying pleasure in the perfect, seductive motions, the warm wet heat of him.
“Another day, another dollar,” Tony said, grinning, closing the tin of lotion and returning it to whatever pocket he’d been keeping it in.
.”  The emphasis on that made Steve flush, made awareness curl hot and tight in his belly, made him gasp and his cock jerk.  He leaned in, just like Tony said, and Tony petted his neck, squeezed gently, then slid his hand down Steve’s sore back, leaving him flinching and hot, his cock drooling with need with every touch, jerking every time Tony’s hand skimmed over a welt, to grip Steve’s other cheek in his other hand.  He squeezed so hard that Steve cried out, felt a hot wash of pleasure, welling up hot and hard in his cock, felt it jerking, the head prickling hot with need and pleasure, precome dripping from him like a faucet, and whimpered, because he
Tony smiled back at him.  “Oh, it will be,” he promised.  “And then we’ll come back and fall into bed together?”
“Strip down for me,” Brock said, idly, and tossed back the rest of his beer as Steve hopped to.  His hands fumbled on his boots, with his slacks already sliding down, and Brock laughed, laughed again as his dick sprang free, sore and hard, and sent a spatter of precome up into Steve’s face.  “Filthy,” Brock said, and grabbed Steve by the back of his neck, kissed his forehead, and shoved him toward the bed.
, throbbing and prickling, desperate for some kind of attention, pressure, or friction, or anything, but Tony hadn’t been touching him at all, had used Steve’s sensitivity—in his nipples, in his rear—to get him off three times already.  His cock felt wet and sticky and aching, and it
“Good,” Tony said, licked his lips, apparently all his eloquence, his coherence, gone.  “’s good.  ‘s nice.  Smooth. Warm.  I don’t know, Steve, honey, please.”
Tony smiled a little, the expression a tiny hint of a smirk, obscure and still hard to read.  “So you decided to be my escort?”
Steve moaned, cheeks a flaming red, red all the way down under his shirt, even over his stomach where his shirt had ridden up to display washboard abs and pale skin flushed like a sunset, but he nodded, sucked harder at Tony’s cockhead, lapping at the tip with added determination.
Steve made a sound in response, but he thought it only came out as a long, low
“Taking me to bed?” Tony asked.
“I can get you on something serious until you fall back asleep, at least, if you want,” Tony said.  His face was very serious, grave, as he looked down at Steve, worry in the tightness around his eyes, his mouth somehow soft.
Tony groaned, grunted, and his face scrunched up, brow furrowing, before his eyes fluttered open.  His face was open, unguarded, sleepy-soft, mouth slack and face blank with sleep.  The lights from the tree flickered over his face in a multicolored rainbow in the dim light of the room.  Steve leaned in, pressed a kiss to his eyebrow, then to his nose, one to the line of his beard, then one to his mouth, and was rewarded by feeling it curve into a soft smile underneath him even as Tony kissed back, his mouth pursing upward into warm, wet kisses against his, Tony raising his head even as Steve pulled back to follow his lips with his, chasing Steve’s mouth with his, warm and lingering.  Steve raised his hand, pet gently along Tony’s forehead, his eyebrow, his cheekbone, as he pulled away, not moving far, staying close enough that his breath still feathered over Tony’s lips, and he could feel Tony’s own against his own wet mouth.
“Merry Christmas, sweetheart,” Steve replied, and covered Tony’s hand with his own, stroking the back of his hand just as gently, turning to press a kiss against his palm.  Tony sighed, a soft little exhalation of breath, his eyes fluttering closed.  He kissed Tony’s palm again, then reached down, grabbed a marshmallow covered in whipped cream, and held it to Tony’s lips.
“Anything you want,” Steve said, dreamily, still smiling up at him.  Tony was the best thing, he thought.  The best, most wonderful thing he’d ever seen.  “Anything at all.”
“How bad is it?” Steve asked.  He wanted to reach up, touch his face, make sure he wasn’t burned too badly, but Tony was holding his hand now and he didn’t want to waste that. Tony’s thumb was rubbing warm circles on his hand underneath the tape.  “Did I—there was an explosion?”
“Tony,” he heard himself moan.  He rocked in his hips despite himself and his cock swayed between them, up and down, came up and hit his belly with a wet noise that made him flush.  It
“We worked together,” Steve agreed.  Tony was grinning, looking down the stairs as Steve carried him up, apparently reveling in the novelty.
, stretching Tony out wide, and then Steve tugged at him, adjusted him slightly as he drew back a bit and slid into Tony again, and then Steve’s cock was sliding directly over his prostate, and Tony gasped, cried out, choking on his own breath, writhed, whimpering helplessly, unable to help it. “I’ve gotcha,” Steve murmured again, “so beautiful, Tony, that’s it, that’s so good.”
Being in chastity, having his cock locked up, constrained at Steve’s pleasure, not for his own, always seemed to make Tony more aware of any attention paid to his back door.  It wasn’t his favorite form of sex, receiving-wise, but he didn’t mind it, either, and with Steve, attention to his anus, to his prostate, had taken on a new kind of excitement for him—the massive, impossible pressure and thickness and fullness of Steve’s dick inside him, the patient way Steve would curl his fingers and rub at Tony’s prostate, smiling at him as Tony’s breath went uneven at the pleasure and his hips jerked back on Steve’s fingers, needy for the press and rub of them on that sensitive place inside.  But being in chastity made him, well, focus on that more, the idea of being penetrated, of having Steve down his throat, in his mouth, or deep inside him, pushing inside his ass, opening Tony wide for him, taking him deep, made him ache to be penetrated, needy to have that firm pressure on his prostate, feeling something inside, as if to make up for the lack of stimulation on his cock.  Like this he wanted Steve to take him, to fuck him, to make him feel warm and aching and full inside, burning with the stretch like from a good workout, give him that stimulation and pleasure even if Tony couldn’t come, to feel Steve come inside him, wet and full, and feel like he’d done a good job for him, that pleasure suffusing all through his body and almost better than feeling it himself.
“I’m sure,” Tony said softly.
“Yes, sir,” he said against Brock’s hot mouth, mouth rubbing wet through his stubble, because he knew it would make him hot, would make him happy.  “Just you, I understand, sir.”
“Oh,” Tony groaned.  “Steve, tiger, that’s incredible.”  He found himself stroking Steve’s face, along his jaw.  “May I come in your mouth?  I’d love to, fill you up, feel that heat around me as I finish, or on your face, your amazing body—cover that chest with my come, you’d look incredible, a Tom of Finland Jackson Pollock—”
“Not just yet, big boy, no,” Tony said, his voice sounding fond, fond and warm, as he pressed his face to Steve’s, nuzzled back, pressed a kiss into his hair, against his temple.  His fingers tugged at the weights again, slipped back up to tease at the tips of his nipples, making Steve ache and shudder with the burning numb heat that was gathering there, spreading through his clamped flesh, more so with every tap Tony laid against his clamped nubs, sending another dull shock through Steve and making him jerk.  Every one made his cock leak.  The tip of his cock felt so hot and hard, burning and aching and on fire with need, throbbing with desperate, ignored want, it was almost painful even without a touch, and Steve still found himself dreaming of those touches all the same, of Tony’s fingertips on his sensitive, wet, slippery cockhead, slipping and sliding and drawing slippery shapes over the thin, raw-hot skin until Steve was moaning and shaking and dripping, smearing wet against Tony’s fingers, maybe his thumb, pushing into his slit, making him shake, making him tremble with the delicate little touches to that sensitive, so sensitive spot that made Steve feel hurt so good, feel like he was going to vibrate right out of his skin, he burned for it, he ached for it, for Tony to touch him, to squeeze, to get his fingers around Steve’s cockhead and squeeze and stroke at the base, anything at all.  His cockhead burned with need, with want, and he could feel, almost hear, himself dripping messily against the bed.  Way messier than a pussy, Tony had said, more than once, a few times, and Steve felt himself flush red hot at the thought all over again.
Tony’s fingers petted through his hair.  “You could come just from this,” he murmured softly, nudging gently at the base of Steve’s cock with his foot, and Steve nodded, moaning into his waistcoat, even as Tony moved his foot off his cock, slid it under Steve’s length to nudge gently at his balls, bouncing them and Steve’s cock slightly on the toe, then pushed it back farther, nudged at Steve’s hole, teasing, pushing enough that he gasped, whimpered, feeling very wet, very tender, as Tony rubbed the leather along his lube-wet crease, tapped the toe of his shoe against his sensitive opening.  Steve heard himself gasping, felt his chest heaving.
“I don’t know about that,” Tony said.  “Wouldn’t want you to think you could just go around getting yourself hurt without getting a talking-to from me, would we?”
, and he’d still been wearing his fingerless gloves, and it had hurt so perfectly, the way he palmed the back of Steve’s neck when he did it—brought him back down, deeper into the kiss—
Tony gave a soft, moaning groan, his cock already throbbing insistently in the cage just at Steve’s words. “That sounds good, sweetie,” he murmured.  “It sounds really good.”
Steve nodded, mouth still on his cock, and his lashes fluttered.  He gripped his cock, groaned, pushing his hips up into his hand, and damn but that was hot, the sight of it so obscenely, ridiculously hot Tony’s brain almost went offline just at that.  Steve Rogers, Captain America, blatantly getting off on sucking Tony’s cock, lips wrapped around him, even as his t-shirt clung to his abs and shoulders and he pushed his giant cock into his own hand through his pants.  The other was clinging warm and steadying to Tony’s asscheek, still, Steve’s fingers pressed almost painfully tight into the curved muscle of it, and that in itself was hot enough to make Tony’s cock throb all on its own, the fact that Steve was holding Tony to his mouth so tightly, so desperately.  Like Tony would have pulled away voluntarily from that hot, wet, softly open, giving mouth, God.
Steve, predictably, flushed even darker and ducked his head.  He reached up, rubbed the back of his neck.  “Well, uh, uh, thanks,” he mumbled.  “I—I mean.  That’s real good of you to say.”
“Are there any left?” Steve asked dryly.
It all seemed to happen more quickly then, time sliding into a soft, easy meld, a mash that settled around him, things slipping and sliding into each other, and all of it felt cushioned around him, warm and good.  Tony slipped his fingers out of Steve, and Steve thought oh, yeah, he was very wet with lube, as he felt air chill on his hole, and then Tony’s cock was there, warm on his hole, the head hot and thick, and he bore down and Tony gasped, moaned, said, “Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, Steve, honey, just like that, just like that, stud, so good, opening up for me so beautifully, you’re so good at that,” and it felt so good, so, so good to hear him say that, that Steve moaned a little.  And then he was moving, Tony was moving inside him, and he was hot and hard and thick, stretching Steve out wide around his length and his heat, and Steve’s thighs trembled, and he fell to his forearms, locked them against the bed, let his head hang down forward between them. Tony ran his hand up and down the broad slope of Steve’s shaking back, along his spine, and he shivered it felt so good, and then Tony was fucking him.  He swayed with each thrust, the clamps on his tits swinging and sore and his tits numb yet throbbing, and Tony hit his prostate and it was so good, all so good, his prostate tender and almost sore but the pleasure still arching through him, high and sweet and all-encompassing, his whole body prickling, and it was so good, every time.
Steve smiled up at Tony quickly, eyes bright and very flushed.  “Yessir, sure do,” he said, then dipped his head again, swallowed heavily.  “I mean,” he said.  “I do for me—you—you always make it so good for me, but if you learned how to do it, I mean.  I’d like to make it—make it good for you, too.”  He squared his shoulders and took a breath, raised his head again and met Tony’s eyes.  “I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’d like to give you a blow, this time, mister,” he said.
.  Steve had been really pleased—thrilled by Tony’s reaction, but pleased with the flogger itself, too, the way it threw, the way it fell on Tony’s skin, not too heavy, soft and perfect for the way Tony liked it done to him, exactly what he’d wanted.
“And that’s your job?” Steve asked, smiling despite himself at the thought.
And Tony had loved it. He’d laughed, but he’d touched his tongue to his bottom lip, bitten it, the way he did when he was actually feeling something real, his eyes had been bright, and his face had softened, in a way that told Steve he was genuinely touched, especially once he’d realized that Steve had meant it for Steve to use on, for, him, in particular.  It had been specially made for them, with white doeskin tails (the finest leather Steve had ever touched in his life; he’d made certain of it, thin enough to be gentle on Tony’s skin, light, soft as a lady’s fine glove, and almost squishy to the touch) and gold fittings, a patinaed metal handle, every inch of it crafted just to look
Steve figured it would probably be unforgivably whiny for Captain America to complain about how far away the bathroom was, but, by God, he felt like it was the Pyrenees all over again.  He sighed and pressed his face closer into Tony’s shoulder, let Tony’s hand come up and stroke at his short hair, tousling it gently, stroking evenly.  He let Tony stroke his hair, soothing and gentle and slow, until his mind was nothing but a soft haze, and he followed automatically when Tony lifted his face with one hand, pressed a gentle kiss to his mouth, which fell open just for him, then squeezed the back of his neck gently and slid his arm around Steve’s waist, pushing him gently in the direction of the bathroom.  His feet felt heavy, his legs wobbly and liquid, but Tony was guiding him, and then they were there, and Tony kissed the back of his neck again and he was somehow inside Tony’s big walk-in shower, sitting on the bench, as Tony fiddled with the spray.  He leaned back against the wall, but the smooth onyx surface was uncomfortably cool and present on his sore, welted shoulders, and he winced, rounded one shoulder and leaned forward again, only to feel Tony’s sympathetic gaze on him.
red, baby.  So, so red.  Like the strawberries on top of your cupcake tits.  Or maybe maraschino cherries.  Prettiest flush I’ve ever seen.”
serving, and he’d thought—maybe he could impress Brock this time, maybe he’d learned how to give him a better blowjob—but that wasn’t what Brock wanted from his dirty mouth, of course not.  He would have wiped off his mouth, if he could, almost moved to do it, but then he felt the belt around his wrists, and of course he could have broken it, but—but he didn’t.  He didn’t want to.  He just stood there with his stinging eyes wide and his mouth dirty and hanging open and let Brock run the cool glass of the beer bottle along his hot, swollen bottom lip.
that, God, and then struggling to strain his thighs to push down, lift himself up so that he could sink back down over Steve’s dick again.  His caged cock felt heavy, swaying between his legs.
“Can I get a scoop of peach and one of lemon?” Steve tried, because Tony’s smile was so soft and so—so winning and he couldn’t help it.
, all through him, like there wasn’t a single part of the whole universe not infused with pain.  He might have groaned.  He blinked, and the world swam in front of him.  He didn’t remember having closed his eyes, but he must have, because then the sky came back from wherever it had gone.
