Dear Tony,
Right. That. As far as he’s concerned, they had no plans in the following week: the remaining heads of HYDRA had been captured, no extraterrestrials causing catastrophe around the globe, cancellations of boring meetings at the headquarters. Yup, they’re fine.’
Tony should be here with him, holding each other’s hands and walked beyond the tunnel. He always wanted to show off his little genius to his mother; they would get along perfectly, he thought.
*****
He noticed Nat zoned out cluelessly and hopelessly beside him. Tony admitted he had never seen her in this state, feeling out of touch. He waved his hand in front of her, causing the Black Widow to startle from her seat.
So, he decided to help Peter on modelling a new design for the sixteen-year-old boy's web shooters. Only he knew about Peter's secret alter ego, which was the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Even his Aunt May, who was Peter's only relative remaining, doesn't know about it. According to him, he didn't want to risk losing another loved one again.
“The simple life.”
“Bruce, we need you here right now,” he requested through the comms. “Steve’s been operated and I need your help in sewing the incision.”
“A reminder that some of those bad memories will be gone forever, while others could resurface after the effects wear off.” Tony added.
A doctor approached him with a black paper-type folder presented to him. He got hold of the folder and opened it to reveal several old and new health evaluations and reports of Steve Rogers. He skimmed through every sheet of data, learning the soldier’s anatomy in detail, along with the effects provided by the serum.
"It hurts so much, Rhodey. Why on earth would he do this to me?" Tony started sobbing, grasping onto the flip phone.
He was fortunate enough that the previous incident was just a minor setback and didn’t compromise the whole experiment. Call him a perfectionist all you want, but he wouldn’t back down from an issue and pressed on and on until he’s satisfied and reached his goal.
Bucky was right. He should have noticed the body’s chest movements before turning into an overthinking machine. Steve was probably fine in there as the operation hasn’t begun yet. Now, they have a chance to get him out of that table. First things first, they should try and talk things out with the Reed Diamond-lookalike doctor.
He was about to ask when he heard Clint’s voice coming from the kitchen and he looked at the archer. There was a pack of chips and chocolates in both of his grips, and a Captain America mug in Bruce’s left hand. His favourite mug. He could see the hot vapour rising from the mug and smelled the bittersweet aroma of coffee. The two of them were already on their way towards him and Nat.
“Since he mentioned your name like some kind of mantra,” he turned his focus on Bucky. “If you ever hurt her, an arrow will be shoved inside your ass.” The archer was overprotective with his best friend as their partnership bloomed since an assigned mission in Budapest.
“Thanks, Pep.”
“I recall being pinned down by the falling debris above me. He helped me out. There were some fragments I remember being in a position to attack him with his face battered.” Tony’s blood was boiling, but he tried to remain calm. “I remember pulling him from drowning and ran away. Hiding from the world because all of my memories – before the war and serving as a HYDRA assassin – came all at once. It hurts.”
“Me too.”
And Bucky was right, unfortunately. JARVIS had confirmed a hidden base underneath the abandoned bank, with two passages connecting the above and below.
“Honey,” Tony broke their peaceful silence. “Make a wish before the shooting star disappears.”
They called the night before the mission and Steve’s reactions were a mixture of happiness, devastation, self-loathing, and guilt after discovering and confirming the identity of the Winter Soldier. If Steve’s emotions were a concoction in the lab, it might be as volatile as a radioactive nucleus.
“I see you have awakened, Captain.”
A question he wished to never respond, moreover to think about it. The man out of time, losing almost everything in the past, and apparently the future.
"It seems that the Captain America is a hero after all even though he had made big mistakes in dealing with the Sokovia Accords' issue," she clarified with pride in her voice. "I don't know about you guys, but Steve Rogers and his friends deserve a second chance. They are human, and so are we. The decisions are on you, Director Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross,”
“You- you killed my mom.”
“Cross my heart,” Tony gestured a cross sign on his chest with his fingers. “Calm your mind, and think of beautiful things.”
I have to call him back, he thought anxiously. Tony searched for Steve's number, which was the only contact in the phone, and pressed the dial button. Unfortunately, luck was not on his side as he heard the voice of a telecommunication operator speaking out the words Tony didn't expect to hear at all.
“We will get you back, honey.”
When time flies, it's actually been a month since Tony last received the news about Steve. He knew that if Steve was captured by the cops, his boyfriend would be detained and locked in the most heavily guarded cell in the Raft. He understood Steve's condition.
“I’m fine, Tony,” which earned a glare from the genius. “I can still live without one kidney to support me. And the sutures won’t hurt me. I promise.”
he made a hurtful conclusion from his line of thought before closing his eyes.
I wish I had more time with you. I wish I never made those stupid mistakes to you. I wish we could be together someday.
“Damn straight, we are,” Rhodey claimed.
The red dot stopped moving instantaneously at a restaurant in SoHo. Tony noticed it and started to panic, but his mind reassured him that the soldier was fine. He probably wants to drink a cup of tea there, he thought. He sat by his working table and waited for the red dot to move again.
Nat flicked every switch on the panel and they were already levitating, getting ready to become airborne. Tony gave her an approving signal and she nodded, pushing down the thrusters, manoeuvring the Quinjet on course. He looked back to the jet’s front windscreen, thinking of their success in finding Steve. Deep down, he was certain he could bring Steve home, safe and sound.
“So, I experimented on her; planned dozens of hypotheses and failed. Until one day I ultimately decided to cut her open and harvested her blood and organs, just to find the right DNA code about the woman’s gifts. As they always say, discovery requires experimentation.” That sentence gave him the creeps. Something terrible was definitely on his way to ruin him. “In the end, my research came to a favourable outcome. Her DNA is now in my veins, and I cheated death. In fact, my whole body regressed to my middle-aged self and it has been the same until now.”
Steve nodded unwillingly. Although he believed he could withstand a hundred more of those jolts, he didn’t want to waste his energy just for resisting. He should save his strength when he could find a chance to escape, even just a tiny one.
"I hope you can accept my apologies, Steve as much as I have forgiven you. I love you," Tony got up from his seat and placed his lips on Steve's forehead. He wanted to make sure that Steve had his last kiss with him.
“Great. When this mission ends, I’m going to mop my hangar.” Tony groaned, looking at the circular-burnt pattern on the floor caused by Thor’s teleportation medium.
Helen guided them to Steve’s ward on the upper floor and spotted their beloved captain in a hospital gown, sleeping to the static noises of a distant television.
He had no other choice but to heavily depend on two courses of action: beg his kidnappers to release him that may end up in a blood bath or wait for backup.
“Thanks, Thor.” He smiled sadly and set foot in the Quinjet, taking a seat at the co-pilot’s chair. He then examined all the flight systems and panels, as the engineer he is.
In a flash, he noticed an old picture frame on the coffee table. He picked it up and inspected the photograph closely. The picture made Tony grinned happily and sadly at the same time.
“He loved you and admired you, even when you fought during my absence. And I know you love him too.” Steve’s eyes went wide, shocked that Bruce knew about his feelings. The doctor noticed his reaction and chuckled lightly. “Steve, I’ve known you for more than a decade. Your gaze is always locked on Tony whenever he speaks. Don’t forget that ear-to-ear grin you gave him every time he pats you on your shoulder.” He wasn’t wrong.
“Shut up, hobo.” Sam laughed. Steve looked at the both of them and they were happy in each other’s presence. He was proud that Bucky had found a home to return to.
“Captain Rogers’ body is still missing from my scans, sir. My theories suggest that he may be kidnapped.” Of course he was kidnapped. He groaned while pinching his chin. Possibly HYDRA, and it made sense, considering Steve had toppled HYDRA’s evil scheme from eliminating thousands of innocent civilians high in the sky.
The super soldier rushed towards Thanos, attempting to beat him. He smiled at Tony while holding off the alien's large fist-
“Oh God, stop mother-henning me,” they both laughed, clearing the ruth tension in the air and enjoying each other’s presence.
After a few minutes of complete silence, Bucky voiced out. His voice started roughly as he regained some memories, but it was still coherent to the human ear.
Steve slumped himself on his bed and stared at the ceiling. Did he had to face all of this alone? Maybe it was meant to be. All of his friends were either on an outbound mission, considered retiring and signed the Accords or voluntarily be placed in a cryochamber.
Whitehall walked closer to the captain’s lying body while putting on a new pair of latex gloves and face mask.
“I can see why Steve adores you. He’s lucky to have you.”
He wasn't so sure if Steve truly loved him. Tony started to wear his fancy clothes and accessories one by one but his mind still pondered about the soldier. He slid into his coat and thought of Steve. He straightened his tie and thought of Steve. He wore his watch and thought of Steve. Did he actually meant to say those words during their call? Tony still loved him, but the present was holding him back to move on from him. He was still in denial with the Siberia incident.
"Hey, Steve," Tony replied. "Mind telling why are you calling me at this hour because I need some sleep," He was still confused with what Steve wanted from him, trying his best to forgive him.
The last step was supposed to be modifying and polishing any biological errors inside the incision site, and it turned out to be flawless; the super-soldier serum really factored into the rapid healing within the body.
The funeral was simple, as they didn't want to attract Ross who would come and arrest them. Everyone delivered their speeches, talking about how lucky they were to have someone who was as caring and loyal as Steve Rogers.
“We’re here.”
Tony scoffed with a mocking salute. “Hey, can I call you Bucky?” The man nodded. “Okay, Buck-O, I know you want to come with us to redeem yourself, but your brain is still attached to your brainwashing programme. You know the risks and I can’t let you do that because I’m sure Steve and Nat won’t allow that. Let me and Bruce help you with that brain of yours.”
After the minor scuffle, Rhodey and Pepper saw him and rushed towards Tony, giving him a warm hug. They knew about Steve. Tony cried his heart out, grieving the loss of his boyfriend. The loss of his other pair. He wished he was there to defend Steve from Thanos. He ignored his visions and he regretted it.
“But why did you want Tony’s help? How do you know him?” Bruce questioned.
“Nat, you’re with me with the satellites.” She smiled and nodded attentively. “Let’s go track my lovable, patriotic, son-of-a-gun husband.”
“I hate it when you’re right,” Tony scoffed in annoyance as he saw a smug crept up the man’s face. “So, you’re saying?”
A minute had passed and the rest of the team had arrived with Bruce rushing into the room. They welcomed their leader back and patted Steve carefully to avoid any sudden pain. Steve beamed widely to see all of them were here for him. It was nice to see the six of them back together after a long time; maybe seven if Bucky decided to stay and do therapy.
They remain in their intimate position for a while. Tony was savouring this moment while his fingers danced around the blonde’s hair, making spiral and wavy marks on it. He knew Steve didn’t mind because they were used to do this regularly in the mornings on their bedsheets, just before they took off for a warm shower. The memory still bouncing in his mind.
He heard Steve's long message, each and every word, digesting its meaning. The voice note lasted for thirteen minutes before Steve ended his message with 'I love you'.
Peter said another 'thank you', waved his hand at Tony and left the Avengers Compound with Happy driving him back home.
Steve went under with a smile on his face, seemingly forgotten he was ever kidnapped by HYDRA.
Questions about the here and now were storming into his brain. Why did they argue in the first place? What was Tony supposed to do at the moment? Why Steve couldn't ask Tony to join the super soldier in their secret expedition? He was worried for his boyfriend on getting hurt because he didn't return the phone call. He loved him and at the moment Tony knew that Steve still loved him.
“Steve, what kind of tunnel?” Tony asked and started to dwell anxiously on the question.
As Steve came into his life, he felt calm with him because he understood what was Tony going through. He would give him soft talks and hugs and kisses to make him realize that Tony had Steve on his side.
Steve brushed his husband’s dark hair softly, breathing in Tony’s natural scent that smelled like home. And his home was indeed the man hugging him. They were admiring the beauty of their surroundings. For him, this was a moment he would cherish for the rest of his life.
The news of Peggy’s death and the defamation of Bucky happened simultaneously; two people who played a significant role in Steve’s past life. Her funeral was graceful but he didn’t get to say goodbye to his first love. And Bucky, he could tell that his old friend wouldn’t detonate a bomb willingly. Zemo framed him at a very high cost: hunted down by every federation around the world. And when he could finally prove Bucky’s innocence, his alliance with Tony went sideways, and well, it’s complicated.
“You’re going for therapy after we save my husband, make amends with the people you hurt before, and don’t tell Steve about this.”
His heart fluttered and he blushed at those words and planted a soft kiss on Steve’s lips, cherishing this moment – Steve was rescued and safe, and that’s all that matters.
After the both of them finished inventing the gadget, Tony gave it to Peter for him to check and probe with his web shooters, but the teenage boy was doing his own agenda after their project. He was checking on his smartphone. Typical teenagers nowadays, he thought. Tony hemmed loudly, making Peter to look up at him with worry. Why was he worried?
Hearing the news not only gave him waves of worry, if truth be told, but he was also on the verge to distance himself from everyone.
He felt being cheated and there were many people who have betrayed his trust. But in this case, he kept holding onto Steve instead of throwing him out of the picture. He still had a little faith in him. It's just... bewildering. Why do he have to go and make things so complicated? He reflected on Steve and let out a small laugh.
This situation reminded him of a time where he and Steve started dating – the blonde man anxious on announcing their relationship worldwide because of the swarm of paparazzi intruding their tower lobby every single fucking day.
“Looks like the Captain America couldn’t handle a bunch of watts.” Whitehall said and he no longer felt shocked. The man in front of him put down his prod and continued to walk.
Only this time, the booboos weren’t the only ones he should kiss it better.
Truth be told, Steve did have good dreams.
“Well, I’m sure we all adore this fluffy relationship, but what about my fluffy relationship? Steve is still out there, scared and lonely. So, I suggest Barnes tell us his location.”
“I don’t think I’m straight, Platypus,” he remarked jokingly, causing the rest of them to laugh and silence surrounded them.
Gradually as time went by during the past nine hours, one by one left the room to have some shut-eye in a waiting room specifically provided by Helen herself. Bucky was the last person to leave and invited Tony to come and join them.
Both of them walked towards Tony’s automatic-driven fancy car. Ultron really did a number on all of them; Bruce vanished, Thor and Clint returning home while him and Nat stayed at the Avengers compound.
“Yes, honey,” he put on a smile to make his husband feel heartened by his presence. “I’m here.”
JARVIS did a whole scan around the room, detecting any presence of life beyond the room’s walls. He discovered behind two rows of walls were a few dozens of men – definitely HYDRA goons – were rushing towards the front door, rifles in their grip.
“Oh, Tony.” She said and hugged him close, with the genius’ head on her shoulder. Tony teared up more, causing Pepper’s blouse to be drenched in teardrops. She didn’t care. It was one of her roles as Tony’s closest friend along with Rhodey and Happy – ensuring that he deserves happiness and not grief, especially since Afghanistan.
“Let’s not go there, Clint.” Bruce reminded him. “I’m sure our lives would suck without him.”
Tony had been working in his lab for ten hours since dusk to invent a nanotech suit for him. He had done experimenting some chemical substances, calculating each probability and tinkering with mechanical equipment to build the suit. It is way more convenient and lighter than wearing the metal suit, he thought.
"FRIDAY, have you done rendering and enhancing my suit's tech?" Tony asked his one-year old A.I. "And also upload everything in it,"
She sat on the tiled floor next to him and lent Tony her handkerchief to wipe away his tears. He was reluctant at first, but he accepted her offer. “Pep.” His voice started shaking. “He- he's gone. I don’t know what I’d do if he’s gone forever.”
He looked back at his soulmate's grave, said a little prayer and waved at the grave.
He stared jarringly at the soldier as he holstered the gun. This man seriously has some manic issues regarding a bad guy’s punishment for either doing a minor problem or a psychotic action. Tony stormed off from the scene and rushed towards the room. Steve was still unconscious and he needed some help.
He did manage to convince Steve that their relationship would be a good example and Captain America was the perfect pioneer to do so. Steve contradicted his statement and said Iron Man was the most ideal role model, and they continued this debate before shifting the conversation on the bed. In the end, Steve decided to debunk their romance tabloid stories together and here they are now, except that his husband was in the hands of HYDRA.
“It’s fine, Hap.” It was never fine. His husband was still out there while HYDRA might be planning god knows what on that stupidly, handsome, one-of-a-kind man. Oh, god. What if HYDRA is currently torturing Steve right now? What if-
A doctor across from him had prepared a jar filled with a pickled solution – composed of high amounts of salt and vinegar. This would ensure the organ would preserve for a long period, preferably until he could examine the structure itself and extract all of its genetic content and nutrients.
“As your boyfriend? Without a doubt, yes!” They resume smooching while Tony has slipped his hand on Steve’s buckle, halting their kiss. He gives a longing and craving gaze at Steve. “But before that, I think we both know we deserve this.”
Steve Rogers.
"Yeah, me too. Stay safe f-for me, okay?" Steve said. "And please get some rest because you really need it after a long night in the lab,"
“Remember,” Whitehall reminded him, although his brain was trying to process the words. “Discovery requires experimentation.”
I love you 3000, Tony.
The words that came out from Captain Rogers’ mouth a while ago caught his attention. He muttered a name, asking the said name for help and to rescue him like a damsel in distress.
“Give me one reason why are you here before I blow you to bits.” He warned while his gauntlet began to charge up.
He was marching towards Tony with a 'stabbing-you-in-the-eye' face when suddenly the rogue Avengers led by Steve Rogers, came out of nowhere.
"Tony?" Pepper's voice rang in his head, his vision was cut off but was horrible enough to look back at it.
Tony walked towards his nanotech suit and began his test drive outside the Avengers Compound. It was what Tony wanted the suit to be; perfect and flawless. His moves were more agile and flexible, all of the ray beams were top-notched and his network connections were wider. Gliding in the air was as smooth as ever since before.
They landed and disembarked the Aven-Jet at a nearby cemetery that had been swallowed by ivy roots and floating mist. A perfect covert spot to have the stealth advantage. Bruce remained in the jet and stayed on guard in case something bad happens.
“Okay, fine. And stop with those pretty eyes of yours. You’re making me want to do things,” he kissed his husband’s cheek and his lips trailed to Steve’s, pursuing another smooching session. “So,” he spoke in between the kisses. “where do you want to go?”
The goon’s face suddenly went frightened as Bucky instantly shot him below his left shoulder and he dropped down to the floor in a heartbeat.
Fast forward to six decades, he was the only original member alive. He got to watch his friends dying peacefully, with each and one of them giving advices to him before their passing. Tears still ran down his wrinkled cheeks every time he attended a friend’s funeral even when he had a foot in the grave. Bucky was the last one to leave him, his only connection from childhood. His best friend got a happy ending for himself: marrying Sam after the both of them neutralized the threat caused by a group called the Flag Smashers. Every so often, their dynamic jogged his memories about Tony and himself. Even after all these years, he still missed him terribly.
Tony was in his lab to monitor Steve's movements in London by pinpointing his recent location. His eyes trailed around the moving red dot on his holographic screen. He wanted to make sure that Steve was safe and sound.
“Let’s go,” he said to Bucky while charging up his repulsors. “They’re gonna divert their attention for us to find Steve quickly.”
He clung himself closer to his lover while Bucky removed all the metal straps on Steve’s body. Hints of relief were then displayed on Steve’s face despite having to endure the burning twinge below his abdomen.
As he arrived, Pepper was already waiting for him, murmuring about Tony stalling her dinner time. They walked towards the genius' lab while Tony clarified everything to her. She nodded and turned on the holographic screen to do some research. After a few minutes, she informed Tony on what she had found out.
He rises up from his bed and immediately hugs the man. Happy tears roll down from his eyes, grateful that Tony is there for him after leaving the real world. After waiting for decades since Iron Man saves the whole universe, his patience pays off to finally meet him. “I miss you so much, Tony.”
Speaking of location, he should have a discussion with his teammates. He also hoped that they would help him find Steve, even when the probability to pinpoint the exact location of Steve would have zero margins.
“Steve, wake up.”
“Oh, they possess dark magic and hunt stray people after dawn, unlike the ones we watch during our movie night.”
They arrived in front of a locked bunker-style door. Hauer unlocked the door and revealed a room he always avoided stepping foot in. An operating room. There were six people in the room, all of them wearing white scrubs and face masks; probably doctors and surgeons. He felt anxious about HYDRA’s upcoming plan on him and didn’t like it, one bit.
“Tony…?”
“You- you never called me Barnes before.”
“Follow us to our lab.” Bruce invited Bucky, waving his hand to the elevator. Tony followed them not behind.
“Tony,” his husband’s voice cut through the silence. “What’s next for us?”
“He’s HYDRA. And a Nazi guy. What do you-”
“Well,” Bruce said, picking up from his embarrassment. “At least Romanoff here didn’t have to worry about her lover.”
“No problem. This will take about 30 minutes to at least remove fifty percent of your HYDRA programming and hopefully restore your old, sweet memories.” He winked at Nat, making her nudged him at the waist.
“Are you sure? You are always the earliest at the table." Tony seemed slightly confused.
1918 - 2016
“Steve.” Tony snapped his fingers, breaking Steve’s trance. He looked back at Tony, grinning sheepishly. “You know, I just want peace at this point – resentment is corrosive and I hate it.”
“A few hours ago, you told me to make amends with my past,” the Winter Soldier aim his gun at the man while Tony nodded, confused with the random sentimental talk. “I can do it right now.”
“Yeah, Pepper and I will go out for a grand dinner in about ten minutes, not that I’m saying the dinner just now was awful. We both planned this yesterday and I don’t want to miss it. Why did you ask?”
"Actually, I do. Your captain failed to protect the Infinity Stone and gave the extra-terrestrials a chance to annihilate our world,"
“You sick, twisted HYDRA monster.”
"Because the Avengers are under the government's laws. If you ever try to violate them, you will be punished," Ross said. "I got my eyes on you, Stark. Try and go to London and I'll make sure that it will be your last trip,"
“You just have to drink the solution.” Bucky made way to Bruce’s lab desk, his eyes focused on the blue-coloured liquid in a measuring cylinder. “It will immediately detect some of your brain’s neuron cells that are once disordered by HYDRA and suppress those memories – in the form of electrical signals – from reaching the synaptic terminals.”
One by one, the captain’s clothes were stripped off excluding his shorts. He then rubbed a chlorhexidine antiseptic on the patient’s lower abdomen. After applying, a sterile drape was covered over the body and a medium-sized hole was cut around the operating site area. Two doctors aided to clip the drapes at every vertex of the operating table; they were ready for the experimental procedure.
okay?” Steve was about to form the ‘I’ syllable and Tony cut him off. “And don’t give me the ‘I’m fine’ bullshit.”
“You remember me?” She asked genuinely. Barnes nodded. “How?”
Clint coughed slightly to gain everyone’s attention. “Nat, care to explain?” His face really displayed raw confusion and Tony agreed. He was also confused with this vague situation between Barnes and Nat. He could only assume the time she was in Iran, he was there too. Probably they dated until Barnes’ programming was activated.
“Thank you, guys. For everything.” They broke off their group hug.
Steve looked him in the eye and placed his wide palm on the back of his hand, feeling heartened with the gesture. “They’ll be fine for a while. I just wanna have some lone time with my cute fella.”
“Yeah, I heard you have someone named Betty.” Tony joked while his eyes kept focusing on the screen. He didn’t have to guess on what would Bruce react because he knew the guy was too shy to talk about her as their relationship was always private. And as he predicted, Bruce’s face went crimson red and covered his blush.
He didn’t realize his heartbeat raced swiftly until he heard rapid beeps from the ECG machine and Tony was mumbling words he couldn’t quite hear properly. Maybe the genius was comforting him to rest. And he did.
Tony would’ve solved their problems by brainstorming multiple ideas but the board members had been ignoring him for a while since he was once caught having sex with his husband in his own office two months ago. Pepper gave him a warning glare while the other board members decided to not let him speak and voice out any opinions.
Then, he heard the heart monitor beeping faster than normal. Tony turned around to see the sparkle from those ocean blue eyes coming to life and stared into his own chocolate brown eyes. Steve was awake and grinning.
It’s almost seven in the evening and everyone that he had requested an hour earlier had arrived, seated on a long couch. Bruce arrived the minute Tony sent out his message, followed by Clint a few moments later, and Nat who showed up looking exhausted. According to her, she was helping with the clean-up in the aftermath of the S.H.I.E.L.D vs. HYDRA incident.
“Count me in.” Nat interjected. Bruce nodded.
“Not helping, buddy.”
“Tony!” He plants another kiss on Tony’s right cheek, causing the genius to blush. Both of them laugh at that particular memory and lay down on the bed. Steve desires this domesticity with Tony and he is determined to achieve it. Now is the moment of truth. “Would you like to go on a date with me?”
Since HYDRA was in his mind, he wondered how Whitehall managed to survive all these years. And he also had preserved his youth. Did he take the super-soldier serum? That can’t be the answer since the serum only could slowly age someone’s length of life. But this, the man standing in front of him was seemingly immortal.
“I will miss you, Tony.”
Clint fixed his seating posture and made a dismissal sign. “Ex-girlfriend. Who cares? She is always stubborn as hell. And a charmer too. Now she’s with some British guy I don’t recognize.” He tore open a bag of chips and grabbed a bite. “Enough about me.” His mouth still chewing. “What about you, Bruce?”
“Bucky, you’re with me,” Tony said while Nat nodded in agreement. Bucky became shocked but simmered down when Nat glared at him. “I might need your help in finding Steve’s position in that bank as you know that place all too well. They are going to retrieve any remaining HYDRA intelligence to be disposed of. Bruce, we need you to stay in here. If we found an injured Steve, you’re our best guy to treat him – unless the Big Guy is needed.”
He watched Whitehall signaled one of his doctors to come forward. Another sedative, he thought. This might be his last sedation before he couldn’t stand the twinging stabs and pain from the procedure.
He knew he shouldn’t be too worried about Steve – even Thor sensed that he was still alive – but he couldn’t resist the sinking feeling he had, murmuring about Steve’s safety. His only wish right now was to hope his husband wasn’t severely injured or beaten to death.
Steve’s eyes opened widely and confirmed his previous thoughts. His back laid on a vertical metallic board, provided with the metal restraints over his body. He tried to unshackle himself but it wasn’t worth the effort – the restraints seemed to be unbreakable and couldn’t be broken down by a strong force, even for a super-soldier like himself. Not even a single crack was made on the strap.
“I know. Don’t worry, we will help you find your husband. I’m confident that you and your team can find him.”
After a minute, he reached the end of the passage and landed safely in a gloomy room. If it wasn’t for the suit, his ass and legs might suffer from the drop. From what he could deduct after a quick glance, this was a storage room – he wasn’t sure what were they keeping; probably guns and ammunition. Tony heard the shaft rattled and Bucky touched down to the cement floor.
His time was running up. Alone on the deathbed and staring at his old sketchbook, he dwelled on the thought of enjoying the life Tony used to talk to him on the other side. The life of getting together with a loved one.
He just had to hope they were on time before it’s too late.
Tony couldn't find those words to express what he was feeling at the moment. He was devastated. No way Steve was dead because he was the great Captain America. The man that he loved, the man who reconciled with him after the civil war via a relic phone was gone forever. Even so, Tony was still rejecting the fact that Steve was dead. He needed proof. He needed to go to London.
“Tony, none of those things were your fault.” Pepper placed her hand on his knee while looking straight into his eyes. “He went on the mission because he loves you and he doesn’t want you to get hurt again, not after Killian. Steve knows you were trying your best to help him and he appreciates it because he is too damned in love with you.”
Then, the Sokovia Accords took place. He couldn’t sign away his freedom of helping people to the government despite there were some good clauses pointed out by Tony. To add insult to injury, he really couldn’t have faith in any government agencies; not after HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD a few years back. There were many possibilities playing in his head, regarding a traitor disguising themselves to take down an organization. The issue itself shocked him. Steve tried to see from Tony’s point of view, on how they would make this successful, but his shoulders couldn’t bear the additional weight.
Here lies,
Is this real? Did he really mean that phrase?
“You can always use a gun.”
After a few moments, one by one they left the cemetery, leaving behind Tony and Nat. She marched closer towards the man and gave him a hug.
As the car left, he began to wonder what Steve was doing at the moment, considering after defeating the Wrecking Crew. Was he hurt? Nope, Steve will be fine, he thought and brushed off his overthinking skills and went to the kitchen. But, deep down in his heart, he wanted Steve to come back.
“Oh, it’s nothing.” Steve gulped, figuring out a topic to steer off from his original plan. As he expected, Tony would always prioritize Pepper than himself. “Clint, Nat and I wanted you to join us in playing darts.”
“We have a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And maybe not die trying will be nice.”
"And?"
“I think it’s… the other way ‘round.”
His close friends also came to visit his husband and checked up on Tony, including Sam who was asked by Pepper to come along. Happy gifted a chocolate box for Steve, Rhodey and Sam talked about the HYDRA infiltration and Steve’s kidnapping while Pepper sat next to him, giving him two cups of coffee.
A bunch of noes came out brokenly out of his mouth and he ran towards the table, intertwining his fingers with Steve’s as he examined the surgical site. His right kidney was gone and there was a tiny puncture in an artery. Did the dead doctor torture him simultaneously with the operation? This was downright callous and his blood started to boil.
Tony just gave a plate of deals to him, which was in fact terrifying for Steve; how could he guarantee they would survive an expedition back to the past and retrieve the most powerful cosmic entities scattered across time? If they failed, would Tony be even furious at him? He had no choice but to trust Tony’s newest invention and accept to his terms. For him, it was a chance to rekindle their friendship and bond. A bond that had been through multiple sticks and stones.
He wished Tony was here to end his misery. The misfortune of being kidnapped unconscious by HYDRA. The torment he was going through at the moment.
“You don’t miss Bobbi?” Nat asked, raising an eyebrow.
He wore his latest Iron Man suit he built recently and traced the phone's signal. FRIDAY informed him that the flip phone was located at an old apartment in Brooklyn. It took Tony less than five minutes to reach there.
“Barnes.” She said coldly, her green eyes giving out a deadly gaze while her gun still pointing at the Winter Soldier.
Did he offer an olive branch to him? Judging from his facial features, Tony was telling the truth. Of course he would because he wasn’t a liar like the soldier himself. It was the kindness and earnest shown by the genius that surprised him since they weren’t on speaking terms for five years – seven if you begin counting from the Civil War aftermath.
He was thrilled to reunite with Steve again. He wants to kick him in the shins for being a self-sacrificing, wonderful and idiotic fool, but he also wants to kiss the man’s booboos away. Call him a sap, he just missed being with his husband.
“Good job, team.”
“Hauer, please tape this man’s mouth.”
“My body will heal itself eventually, you know.” Steve gave him a reassuring smile – he didn’t want Tony to worry too much about him because Tony had done so much for him. “I will be out of this bed in no time.”
She was right. Tony couldn't do anything to stop Steve from his trip. He didn't want Steve to get hurt. He didn't want to lose him again. Despite everything that they have went through, he wanted to fix his relationship with Steve.
"Tony?" A voice he wished to hear it again every day and at the same time to ignore the hell on the other end.
“Paris?”
Tony’s reply confuses him even more. “What?”
He eyed the surgeon, conveying a message to start the procedure immediately.
“Sounds like a deal.” Both of them stick out their hand to shake in the negotiation. He tried to control his nervousness from reaching his hand and maintained a firm smile. They were never this profound since Sokovia. His eyes wandered from their handshakes to the other man’s brown eyes – one of the reasons he fell in love with him and was glad to see the same gaze he first saw after Iron Man saved New York from catastrophe. Too bad the feeling wasn’t mutual. And that’s fine.
"Tony, I wasn't expecting you to be here in Steve's hideout," the female blonde talked to him after she recognized the person trespassing her neighbour’s home.
“Ah ah ah.” He made a ‘no’ sign with his pointer finger, as an indication for him to shut up. “If you dare interrupt my upcoming storytelling to you, I will ask my assistant to jolt you again.”
"Because you won't allow us to go there, goddammit!" Tony shouted in full volume.
Tony was about to reminisce deeper when he touched a metal surface at the back of the picture frame. He flipped the photograph and found the flip phone. He activated the gadget, investigating on what went wrong during the time he tried to call Steve back. The phone's SIM card was broken.
“Heimdall informed me about the Captain’s distress just now. I came here immediately to help him,” he placed his large hand on Tony’s left shoulder. “Fear not, Man of Iron. I will assist in finding your dearest, beloved husband.”
"So, you are not on my faction in our so-called breakup?" Tony asked and she nodded. "Looks like I'm gonna arrest you,"
He was about to finish his train of thoughts when a sudden power cut happened before he could say knife and they were covered in darkness. The whole tower was in total blackout according to JARVIS, however, the next few seconds shocked him. Not because of the power generator being fixed all of a sudden, but the unexpected emergence of the Winter Soldier himself. He wore a brown cap with a black jacket and stood behind the kitchen counter with his hands held up high.
*****
“Tones… it hurts… so much.”
*****
In a blink of an eye, the shooting star vanished while his vision crippled like waves and he was not lying on the shaggy grassland anymore. His back felt cold as if he was on a glassy surface. He saw illuminated lights above him and a few doctors were surrounding him. He was back in the operating room.
Of course, he once had a family, but it wasn’t the same. Even when his father was never there for him, he had his mother, Jarvis and Ana. Too bad his mom and ‘dad’ died too soon in an accident in 1991, while Jarvis and his wife grew out of age, years before he was kidnapped in the middle of the desert.
“Fair enough,” Bucky replied, agreeing to his terms; as long as he could be next to Nat.
In a split second, that man shoved the prod at his torso and he felt a sudden electric jolt running through his veins. It hurts like hell. Every inch of his body was screaming for help. He had never suffered being electrocuted in his life, so this experience might scar him in the future.
He couldn’t imagine the unfathomable torture his husband was going through the moment Steve was kidnapped. If he figured out this place much sooner, Steve wouldn’t have to endure such pain by these HYDRA scums.
"Reporting live from Grand Central Station, ex-Avenger and wanted fugitive Steve Rogers was spotted here with his team to defend the citizens of New York from a hooligan group called the Wrecking Crew,"
Hope lingered in his head and he whispered some words of motivation to himself. He had to stay strong for himself. For Steve.
"I'm sorry, Tony for everything you have been going through," he started to speak and massaged the man's shoulders.
“You can thank us after we save Steve.” He said, longing to be in Steve’s arms since his disappearance for the past twenty-four hours.
“It’s not your fault, Steve,” he ran his fingers across his husband’s chest gently. “You actually did a good job in that part because he came to the tower to ask some help about it. Find the right solution, fix his brain, yadda yadda yadda.”
His team messed up big time at Lagos. Everything would be as smooth as silk when that bastard Rumlow bombed himself in the middle of the crowd, only for Wanda who kinda failed at containing the explosive flares. Steve couldn’t blame her as she was the youngest and least experienced amongst them. He blamed himself for not training her well.
Tony was the first to step into the room, sat next to him and stroked the scruffy blonde hair of his lover. Nat touched Steve’s cheek with Bucky holding her close, Bruce and Thor stood on the corner with a weak smile on their faces while Clint sat cross-legged on the white floor with his hand acting as a prop up for his head. They’re all waiting for Steve to wake up and welcome him back.
The man showed himself and it hit him. He did remember the guy, one of the most distinguished people of HYDRA 70 years ago.
"No worries, Mr. Stark. Besides, it wasn't your fault that he left you," Peter replied.
“Don’t just stand there. Hop in!” Happy called out with his hand signing inwards and Tony went straight into the vehicle in a hurry.
“I’m home.”
A few of his men rushed into the room and cleaned up the corpse, along with the spilling blood on the floor. That should teach the others a lesson, he thought and put the gun down.
The genius continued to monitor the satellites’ search radar on his minimalistic, holographic screen. He ran through every potential coordinate that could possibly detain Steve: Nevada, North Dakota, Illinois and others. Fuck, this search was a lot harder than taking an aerial picture on Area 51 with his tech.
Speaking of the nation’s patriotic icon, Tony clicked on his chat bubble with Steve on the tablet and read their conversation last night. His husband had sent two pictures to him: one was a photo of Steve, Nat, Maria Hill, and a newbie named Sam if he was not mistaken. The other photo was Steve himself, smiling goofily at the camera with a caption that reads “See you tomorrow!”, which was today. Steve and co. were on a mission to make HYDRA’s plans meet their ends after the sudden news of the organization had infiltrated a lot of firms, companies, and agencies, including S.H.I.E.L.D. Steve had also told him about the once alleged story of the Winter Soldier that turned out to be true and the guy behind the mask: James Buchanan Barnes.
“Thank you.” Bucky spoke softly. “You have every right to be mad at me. I’m not sure if I deserve it.”
“Aye. The HYDRA men were a breeze for us, especially for our friend Clint here.”
Then, FRIDAY's voice had alerted the billionaire.
Bucky and Sam came along, giving way for the cloud of sadness to fade away. Both of them hugged him and wished the soldier good luck on returning the Infinity Stones.
The doctor must have noticed his gawking eyes and let out a chuckle. “I’m sure you are surprised to see me again after almost seven decades. I will tell you how I got here. But first.” Whitehall signalled his assistant to step forward. “Let’s take a stroll down the memory lane, shall we?”
"Oh, Steve," Tony said while placed the dead man's hand on his teary cheeks.
Whitehall appeared on the far side of the table wearing a full set of blue-coloured scrubs, grinning like the devil himself. “Had a good dream just now?” He laughed and held a pair of surgical scissors in his grip. Steve wanted to hurl so badly because they were treating him like a lab rat.
Tony stared at him for a while, not believing what Steve had said. “I’m gonna pretend I didn’t hear that.”
Instead of walking to the end of the tunnel, the super-soldier found himself dancing steadily around the kitchen with Tony; both of their hands caressed each other’s back with their heads met one another.
His husband pecked him on his forehead. Having Steve reassuring him about his condition definitely soothed his nerves, although he knew his husband is a self-healing super-soldier. They’re gonna be all right.
“It’s up to you, doll. All I want is to make up for all the time when we were apart.”
“Really?” Bucky asked in shock.
Two bullets flew past between them along with the piercing sound of a gunshot and their eyes followed. Both of the shots went through the doctor’s torso. Blood flowed out from his body and within a few seconds, he collapsed to the ground.
Thor and the spy twins were there.
He wanted to turn back time, to cherish those moments, never wasting any second with Steve. It was just a wishful thinking. His mind became a hope-making generator.
Tony actually did what Steve requested him to although he was hesitant at first. Some actual shut-eye.
“No problem. Besides, Pepper had told me about Steve. I’m sorry to hear that.”
He slept just as he ended his call with Steve until something happened mentally in his head after catching a six-hour nap. Tony woke up abruptly, rubbing both of his eyes to brush off the nightmare. However, it felt like a vision. A real premonition, just like during the Ultron days. He couldn't get it off his mind.
“I know where Steve is, and I need your help, Stark.” The mention of Steve made him jumped a little. So, this guy was the one behind his husband’s abduction…
He took out a blue marker pen and traced a linear line, extending from the upper front of the pubic symphysis to the medial part of the anterior superior iliac spine. A doctor grabbed his marker pen and gave him a surgical blade. Already sanitized and wearing a pair of latex gloves, Whitehall incised through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the anterior rectus sheath, revealing the inner anatomy of the captain’s body.
The same metal straps were restraining his hands and legs from before. His spark for escaping the HYDRA base was gone as lethargy took over him after he woke up from the dream. Steve could only hope Tony would come and rescue him in time before it’s too late. He wondered if the Tony in his dream was real; someone that he loves turns out to leave him in the end. Would his husband leave him if he found out Steve was weak and couldn’t escape a bunch of HYDRA goons?
Whitehall chuckled again. “Oh, you will be dead in a couple of hours. The cutting-you-open process is the one that’s going to take us some time. The organ extraction would be straightforward.”
Tony couldn't speak out those three words to his boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend; he wasn't certain of it. He needed to take some fresh air.
Whitehall raised his eyebrows in irritation and shot the doctor at the heart. He repeatedly pulled the trigger, lashing out his rage on this man. After a dozen of shots, the doctor – having multiple holes on his body – laid unmoving on the floor, blood pooling around his corpse.
Tony landed on the ground and tapped his newly designed arc reactor. In an instant, his suit wrinkled and moved towards the artificial heart.
Then, Nat handed him an envelope that was slightly soaked from the pouring rain. She gave Tony a weak smile and walked away.
“I have some satellites that could do that, but it will take a long while to cover the entire globe. I better get going.”
Tony cried again. One part of him was broken because Steve was gone. Really gone. Steve died with severe guilt in his heart and mind. He couldn't imagine what had Steve went through.
“You’re a cheesy man, Stark. It’s nauseating,” which earned a hard nudge from Tony. “I’m glad both of you met in this century together.” Bucky smiled and his footsteps faded as he walked away from the room.
“Alive and not brainwashed? Yes,” the Winter Soldier chuckled and stepped closer to the table. “Glad to have you back, pal.”
After what seemed to be a long shower, Tony stepped out of the bathroom with a red towel hanging around his waist lines and took a peep at the clock. It was an hour after noon started. Then, he remembered about Steve's call in the morning. He was travelling back to New York, his original hometown. He didn't come back for Tony, but he came back to defeat the new villains.
Tony started to sob. He began to think that it was his fault for not picking up the phone. He imagined what Steve was going through without Iron Man by his side, always haunted by his mistakes towards Tony every day.
He should try and hurry up with the operation because he knew their base’s defences wouldn’t last long when the Avengers have a god and a Hulk on their side. However, fretting about them would cost more of his time, so he must focus on his revolutionary vision.
After forty winks, he woke up with Tony still keeping him company next to him. The genius who was previously scrolling his smartphone noticed Steve’s awakening, offered him a glass of water but earned a declining wave from the super-soldier.
“Breaking news! Captain America was last spotted on the fallen Helicarrier and seemingly his body fell into the Potomac River. We haven’t yet discovered the Captain’s body, so stay tuned for more updates.”
His thoughts were interrupted when Tony barged into his room, inviting him for their daily dinner schedule with the team. Steve beamed a smile at him.
Tony was frustrated. How did HYDRA manage to get away easily and undetectable by one of the advanced machines he had ever created? He always thought the red-and-eight-legged-octopus-logo organization would be quite behind in technology.
Tears were streaming down his face after his mind became an overthinking machine. He glanced at his old sketchbook in his backpack, the remaining glitter on its cover still shimmering aesthetically. Steve didn’t have the strength to continue drawing at this moment; gloom and apathy washed away his determination to aspire. Aspiring to feel wanted and loved by the man he cared.
The rest of the team arrived shortly after; giving Tony a big hug and waited anxiously for the medical results in the hallway.
“I’m sorry, hun, for what he did to you. I swear to God I’ll kill him again even it wasn’t me who killed him in the first place.”
“Precisely.”
“Doctor Werner Reinhardt.” A wicked grin crept up on the man’s face.
As he was about to leave the headquarters, a limousine drove into the compound. The car parked in front of the standing Tony and the window was winding down to reveal a man. Thaddeus Ross. What the hell is he doing here? He thought.
“And what’s that?”
His vision might betray him at the moment, but Tony knew what he had witnessed as he entered the operation room. Bucky set foot in the room and he too was shocked by the current situation they were facing: Steve had been cut open at his lower abdomen, meaning that HYDRA had performed the surgery on him.
Surprisingly, those were the only shots fired. Both of them looked in the opposite direction from the room and spotted a goon who was wearing a pair of goggles on his head. The guy seemed shell-shocked looking at the dead man, probably indicating that the doctor was their supreme leader.
“A cup of coffee is enough.” Clint nodded and he went to the communal kitchen, not far from their workplace. Bruce followed him while Nat decided to stay with Tony.
He told his friends that they were welcomed to leave as the night grew older. The three of them declined the offer, stating they wouldn’t give up this early and were willing to stay up all night and day together just to find their beloved friend and fearless leader. Tony smirked at their answers, feeling happy with their presence around. It was a nice sentiment.
"That’s me,” she introduced herself. "I was the one who became your boyfriend's therapist during these civil times,"
“Please tell me nobody kissed me.”
I will always forgive you Tony even when you channeled your rage towards me because I love you so much. I'm just hoping you will forgive me for my sins, for my mistakes towards you. For betraying you... I'm sorry Tony for everything.
He stormed with rage towards Barnes and knocked him out on the floor on his front torso, his gauntlet grasping both of his arms to prevent him from escaping or worst, hurting him and the team. Barnes growled in pain, but he didn’t move a muscle to tackle the genius off of him. Tony didn’t care; this man was responsible for Steve’s drowning and kidnapping.
“The room is not just your typical room to perform surgery,” Bucky continued with his explanation. “’twas also the place I got my mind erased and swapped countless times.”
Upon completing his mission, Steve stepped down from being Captain America, gave the mantle to Sam and continued to fight alongside the Avengers. He trained and advised each and every one of them to fight for what they loved. For years, new and young ones replaced the old ones, giving way for his old friends to retire and live a tranquil life. Tony’s daughter, Morgan joined the Avengers too at the age of twenty-two, replacing previous Avengers’ head scientist Helen Cho, and helped improve and enhance everyone’s gear and tech. Tony would be so proud of her.
Steve stood on the quantum portal, both hands holding the stones and Mjolnir. Bruce gave a thumbs up and Steve was on his way to complete his mission, guided by the Time-Space GPS. His mind came up with an idea – live in the past and let his aged-self get back to the original timeline after returning the stones. The idea itself was tempting, considering that he knew Tony loved him since the beginning.
better get going.” Nat corrected, then she placed her hand on his shoulder. “Tony, you don’t have to do this alone, you know. Let us help find Steve because we are his friends, and you are our friend, too. The more assisting hands, the better.”
He expected and wished that Steve would call him on his birthday. That's all that he ever wanted at the moment. He didn't care about those colourful presents. He wanted Steve to be here with him. The longer he waited for the flip phone to vibrate and beep, the more he questioned about Steve. Did he failed to remember his birthday? Did he neglect Tony?
“Me too.” Steve shared the same sentiment.
He was aware that Iron Man would search for his missing husband right now, but he doesn’t have to worry about the so-called billionaire; he straight away ordered all of his men, including the doctors and surgeons, to barricade their hideout and keep an eye out for any Avenger or S.H.I.E.L.D agent present around the building.
He and Bruce immediately put on a new set of scrubs and masks while the others decided to stay in the observatory room, not interfering with their two geniuses. They said their encouraging wishes and left the room.
Tony asked FRIDAY to turn off the news and decided to head to the kitchen. Peter thanked him a lot of times, knowing that the man who stood in front of him was his idol. He hugged Tony and surprisingly he returned the hug, arms opened.
“Count your days, Barnes,” Nat warned the Winter Soldier while settling down on the pilot’s chair. Tony could hear Clint’s giggle behind him regarding the assassin’s rocky relationship with her, much to Bucky’s dismay.
“Hey, it’s not your fault for what happened to my parents. You absolutely deserve my forgiveness. Just remember a few things.”
He snuggled down in Steve’s arms while Steve stole a kiss on Tony’s ruffled hair. “You’re so beautiful like this. But it will more perfect if you actually get a well-deserved rest. When was the last time you took a real nap?” Of course he fucking knows. Steve could face a million problems in this world and still would know that he was not resting.
All of them breathed a sigh of relief, except for Whitehall who was furious with the incident. His eyes hunted around for the doctor who caused this mess, only to be spotted by the exit.
“Since when did you care about Barnes?” Nat asked Clint, who was wearing a black sleeveless, turtleneck vest with a tinge of purple as his new outfit.
Then, he noticed another object in the envelope. There was another note in it.
He was proud with his latest project although it was already six in the morning. If only Steve was here with him to witness his newest suit. He could still hear and imagine the soldier's sweetest compliments for him and his rants about Tony not getting enough sleep. If and only if he was here.
“Never expect you to give me the pep-talk, Robocop.” Tony laughed, sending a ‘thank-you’ look to Bucky who took a seat behind the redhead. He felt reassured and confident after listening to Bucky’s so-called speech. Fretting a lot about his husband could cause more damage control to himself, and probably to Steve.
He’s dead. What the hell just happened?
“Who did?”
Tony rose from his chair and left the conference room hurriedly, ignoring the murmurs of the board members. His office was the only spot to shed tears privately. He wanted to lash out his emotions in his bedroom, in
All this time, he thought his dad was to blame for his mother’s death. The truth just came out of the bag, or in this case a person, who was responsible for their deaths and was fucking right in front of him.
"I'm leaving to London, back off!" Tony exclaimed.
He looked back at the minute they were both fighting over a mystical sceptre that happened to create Vision. He recalled the time him and his boyfriend had their first date in a fancy restaurant after the battle of New York. He remembered the second they shared a bed and their first kiss at Clint's farmhouse (or safe house according to the archer). He recollected a fragment of a moment where he shoved harshly at the super soldier for not telling him the truth. The truth about his parents' death. He felt torn into pieces because apparently his boyfriend loved his relic best friend more than the billionaire himself.
"I'm fine, Peter and thank you for helping me, through... all of this," He gestured his hands towards him.
And then, there was a bottle of beer in the highest kitchen cupboard. It was perfect. No one will come to see this, not even Steve, he thought. He slid a rolling ladder along the side of the wall and moved towards the cupboard. He climbed the ladder, grabbed the bottle and descended down.
Tony had got his second chance and he did roll the dice of risking losing himself or his family in the process. They were going to bring back everyone without leaving anyone behind. He was going to see his best friends back. He missed Bucky, Sam, T’Challa and the rest. Steve also had to make sure Tony made it back in one piece. He had to.
Rhodes (he made it clear not to call him Rhodey after what he did to his best friend) and Carol hoisted Tony up, proceeding to the medical room and checked up on him. Steve stood there, stunned with everything going on. A month had passed since the Blip. His best friends, especially Bucky and Sam were turned into ashes in front of him, followed by half of the people in Wakanda and apparently, fifty percent of Earth’s population and the universe. Everyone lost their loved ones, including themselves. The day the Avengers lost a battle because they became divided and parted ways. And their co-leaders weren’t together to guide them.
“Too tired… for another sedation,” Steve breathed out wearily.
One of the male doctors accidentally tripped over a camouflaging cable while his hand was trying to find a spot to hold on and minimize the impact. The smack of his hand caused a pair of forceps to fly off the trolley, landing inside the surgical site of the body. Blood immediately spewed out in large amounts as the sharp edge of the instrument punctured one of the nearby arteries. Within ten seconds, the bright-red liquid almost overflowed the void cavity.
“You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them.” Bruce chimed in with his advice.
Spending two years hiding from the world gave him time to ponder, to reflect on himself that he was just as helpless and useless as he was before the serum. Being Captain America wasn’t his strong suit and forte after all. He couldn’t be the national icon for everyone. He couldn’t be the perfect man for Tony. The man deserved someone better than him; a caring, honest and trustworthy partner, i.e. Pepper.
“I don’t deserve you as my friend.”
Once the two of them approached the large commercial garbage bin and opened its lid, revealing the hidden vent, Tony straight away dug his left foot in it. He sensed the same judging glare from the soldier. If only he could stab this man’s eyes…
"The ex-fugitive was here to defend a precious item called an Infinity Stone, but he was surrounded by Thanos and his minions. Unfortunately, the captain's neck was snapped by the leader, leaving the aliens to retrieve the stone and teleported themselves to-"
“And friend.” Clint added. Tony groaned and they started doing their tasks together.
Bruce managed to stitch Steve’s incision up in less than ten minutes. Tony carried his body and flew to a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical centre not far away from the ruins of the Triskelion, along with Thor who had created a wind tunnel to travel there faster. He met up with Helen Cho and her colleagues and demanded an immediate check-up on the man. They settled Steve’s body on a gurney and rushed to the ICU, leaving him alone in the foyer, wishing a godspeed recovery for Steve.
“You’re asking me if I’m okay? Huh.” He scoffed, clearly irked with Steve’s ‘putting-others-first-before-himself’ trait. “The real question in the room is are
“Seems like they have a cloaking vehicle.” Clint chimed in. “Probably a Quinjet.”
After placing the kidney into the jar and sealing it tight, he put it down on the surgical trolley gracefully, ensuring the jar wouldn’t stumble and fall. Then, he ordered the doctors and surgeons to prepare for the next operation without fail. In his mind, he planned to harvest the pancreas next as the said organ won’t cause much harm to the body.
Tony flew back to the compound. He needed to know the details of Steve's expedition in London. The flying Iron Man requested FRIDAY to call Pepper and asked her to meet him at the headquarters.
“I just did the best shot ever. Ha. Take that, Barnes.” Clint screamed excitedly and beastly.
“As much I like to see who would win this battle, we got work to do.”
“Who’s the Big Guy?” Bucky asked, making everyone laugh.
“I… I know you’d be here… with me…to the tunnel.”
Then, FRIDAY detected an unknown noise in the lab. He flew with maximum velocity heading towards his lab, worrying about an intruder or an explosion. He wasn't sure about it since the A.I. couldn't recognize the sound.
“So, I’m pretty sure the others are dying to see you.”
Tony fondled and smiled at his classic, shiny wedding ring chosen by his cheeky husband. There was an unforgettable memory about the ring – Steve dragged him to the rooftop at midnight while he was working on his new suit. He revealed a red-and-gold coloured ring with the word ‘Together’ carved on it, hidden in his fist. Of course, in a heartbeat, Tony accepted the soldier’s proposal and kissed him affectionately, surrounded by the bright lights of New York City.
He had failed his husband. Steve might be dead because of him. And top the guilt mountain off with HYDRA about to cut him open because they were always obsessed with the super-soldier, knowing that people around the world only paid attention to Captain America and not Steve Rogers. How was this fair to him? His husband had taken great care and protect him during the Extremis and Malibu incident, but what form of kindness did he return the favour?
Watching the soldier lay unconscious on the metal board made his heart flutter – he was going to carry out a fully experimental procedure on him. He first analysed the captain’s brain activity and life functions from the observatory room through a glass window that separates the room from the operating room.
All of the registered Avengers were fighting against an army of extra-terrestrials led by a buff, purple guy named Thanos nearby an unknown jungle. Beforehand, the alien was demanding a stone from Tony and his team, or they would face oblivion.
"Oh, let me get to the point," Steve started to clarify. "By afternoon, I have to leave Wakanda since the international cops have detected my location. And I'm pretty sure there might be no chance for me to get into hiding anymore.
“You talk too much, Captain. Schmidt used to mention that you were always chatty with your patriotism.” He chuckled, reminiscing about working with the Red Skull. He then motioned one of the surgeons to step closer to his board. There was a syringe filled with some sort of liquid in the surgeon’s hand. “Alas, I have some work to do. Please make sure he is completely sedated and regularly check his body vitals. We need him in good shape.”
“What?” He asked with irritation in his voice.
Steve. Oh gosh, how were they still delaying the inevitable when his husband might not have a lot of time? Thank the heavens that Nat reminded him and everyone else.
“You all right there?” The footsteps came closer, accompanied by a metal arm emerging from his left side.
"When I went to comfort him, I noticed some cuts and scars on both of his arms, indicating that he may have tried to... so I gave him every motivational talk and hopes for him to live happily but he was still in his grief state,"
His heart shattered and he leant against a wall that hides them from being spotted by the doctor, muffled up in tears in his eyes. He hung his head low, hiding his sadness from Bucky. HYDRA was using him as their dissecting project? Was this their whole plan the whole fucking time?
He blacked out.
“You guys seem to get along.”
“I was assigned to retrieve the remaining stock of the Super Soldier Serum and kill your father. And I did.” His voice breaking, full of regret. “I made it look like an accident; Howard recognized me, and I brushed it aside because I don’t remember him at all. I-”
Sometimes, he wondered about the odds if he asked Tony on a date. Failure will most likely to take place since the said billionaire was in a relationship with Pepper Potts, the CEO of Stark Industries and one of Tony’s closest friends. He thought that the only way for Tony to notice him more was to level up to everyone’s expectations: being the perfect Captain America he ever was.
“That obvious, huh?”
He needed to get Steve out of his fucking mind.
“You’re going in without me by your side?” Bucky whined, giving her his puppy eyes.
The next day, Steve was discharged from the hospital despite being instructed by the doctors and Tony. Hearing advices to rest from each person that he met made him having lots of wishful yearning, thinking that he wasn’t neither good nor perfect enough for everyone else, including Tony. Reflecting on that thought worried him of his future; probably destined to be alone the whole time.
Steve’s eyes wandered around and spotted Bucky near the room’s entrance. “Buck… you’re…”
"Babe, please come back to me," Tony said with a little hope in him. "I know we had a rough fight before, b-but I'm here now. I-I will always love you and I can't fathom myself if you are gone,"
A flip phone?
God Bless Captain America.
“No. Thank
“For your information, I will begin the procedure right after this and I will start with the organ that hurts you the least: your kidneys,” he approached towards his upper body, pointing his finger at his renal area. “The doctors will sedate you again to keep your body from moving and no, I won’t inject painkillers in your body. Consider this a retribution for going against HYDRA, but your body will serve us well, Captain Rogers.”
“Maybe that’s enough storytelling for the night,” Tony cleared the air and walked forward to the decaying wooden gate. He spotted the abandoned bank the far opposite from the cemetery and road junction.
I know that this will be a rough time for you because now that I'm gone. It's so excruciating to see you low, and I wanted to be there for you but after leaving you broken on the inside and outside made me think twice.
Peter placed his hand on his mentor's left shoulder to pat him. Tony felt relieved and continued to watch the news.
As they were on track, Tony couldn’t help but take note of the base’s archaic design and maze-like layout, which was slightly impressive considering it’s underground. Which comes to the question: was HYDRA been around the community since the Medieval ages?
He closed his eyes and grinned at the thought of Tony.
“We’re compromised. They know we are here as if they expected our arrival.” Nat’s voice rang through the comms.
“Tony! H- help me- e, Tony,” the captain whimpered. “It- it hurts… so m- much.” He went quiet after a surgeon rushed to inject the sedative, dose after dose until he was under sedation.
One of the board members turned on the broadcasting television and, in an instant, contrast headlines popped up on the screen. Oh.
He shouldn’t be upset about Tony and Pepper’s marriage. Realistically, he should be stoked and congratulate the man but his envied mind created fake scenarios of him and Tony, living a happy ever after life.
All of them laughed including Tony, capturing the lively domesticity surrounding their atmosphere. His husband must’ve been proud of his friend for breaking free from HYDRA’s mind tricks. And Tony was proud of his husband.
"Hello, who's in there?" And then he heard a baseball bat dropped to the floor, letting out a small creak.
More tears were running down his face and his sobbing became louder. His chest started to ache.
A former student of his, Baron von Strucker, had informed him about two new Sokovian individuals that had different peculiar abilities: one has the powers to move at the speed of light, and the other is both a telepath and a telekinetic. Surprised with the good news, he requested Strucker to continue to study their activities and behaviour so that they are prepared for his future experiments. He thought of going to Sokovia after this operation as their gifts kept him intrigued for a while.
Bruce looked at him with a sad smile and placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I know you blame yourself for what happened to Tony, but he made his choice. He knew the risks better than all of us when he wore the gauntlet to save us. To save you, especially.”
“I’ll think of it, Tony.”
Whitehall grinned happily behind the mask, proud of himself as he reminisced the day he successfully cut open the ageless Inhuman he captured a few decades back. He was one step closer to achieve his goal, and this experimentation was an astonishing breakthrough – opening endless possibilities for discovery.
Steve was still staring with fond eyes at the man who just saved New York from an unauthorized missile launch. He realized that maybe this man is the one he should be together in the future. He realized that he was indeed in love with Tony Stark.
This causes Tony to make up his mind to break his chains of sobriety. Steve was the one who guided Tony to stop drinking alcoholic beverages. Despite being stubborn at first, he did listen to Steve's advice because he wanted to be with him until the end of the line. At the moment, the one who meant the most to him was the one who didn't show up at the door or to the very least, called during his birthday.
“He needs me, and I need him,” he said, maintaining his focus on Steve. “I can’t let him wake up without me by his side. He’s been through a lot… and we promised to be there for each other.”
All of the men in the room chorused a synchronized ‘yes, Herr Whitehall’ before exiting. He heard rattles of rifle magazines and stomps of heavy boots in the corridor, preparing themselves with limitless ammo and protection. They were given the order to shoot-to-kill anyone that tries to approach Whitehall and his operation room.
“JARVIS, look up to any info on the relationship between the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes, and HYDRA.” Tony requested as he slouched on his chair while ignoring angry orders from the board members to pay attention during the meeting.
“Whatever,” Bucky exhaled a sigh, probably fed up with the archer. “You two should come down here and help us with Steve.”
“We’ll prepare the Aven-Jet.” The archer said, leaving the communal floor with Nat.
An hour had passed by and the red dot still hasn't moved an inch on the map. His mind was spinning and his hands were shaking. An average person would spend thirteen minutes to drink tea, and why was Steve spending a lot of time there? What was happening on the other side of the world?
And it was also Tony's birthday. Ever since they met, Steve would never forget Tony's special day. He remembered the times when Steve would give him a wonderful birthday present for him and organized a party for him. All of his friends and teammates would be there to celebrate his birthday. Steve always promised a special treat for him after the celebration which made Tony loved him even more.
Within thirty minutes, the whole team caught sight of Helen walking towards them with a tablet in her grip, eyes full of relief. She announced Steve was safe and that’s all that took for Tony to let out tears of joy. He didn’t listen to her further explanations as he was deep in his thoughts. His Steve was alive and well.
"You don't have the fucking rights to do it," Tony said, starting to sob. "He was doing his job to protect me and all of us,"
The rest of the team were not far behind as he turned his head around, except for Bucky. Where is he?
As he was contemplating on that matter, Happy had arrived with his limousine and honked, causing Tony to startle.
“But we’ve already gone to a magical island on our first honeymoon. Tahiti.” His husband put on his round, puppy eyes and stared at him. He couldn’t say no to that; it’s been proven again and again that Steve’s signature puppy eyes will always make him melt inside, it’s a crime.
“He can handle this, birdbrain.”
Faint sobs were heard from the other end of the call. For Steve, it must’ve been great news as his childhood best friend was still alive after all these years. Tony assured his husband that everything would be fine and promised to bring back the brainwashed Bucky from the trenches of HYDRA. Maybe he should start digging some info on the infamous Manchurian Candidate of HYDRA.
The scientist couldn’t finish his sentence as he heard a loud bang piercing through his ears and felt a throbbing pain on his torso. He looked down at his chest and noticed two red stains spreading across his blue scrubs. His head was spinning while his eyes lose control of his surroundings.
“After all,” Whitehall grabbed his surgical blade, pointing it around the pancreas’ placement. “Discovery requires experim-”
"How did you know?" Tony asked with surprise.
“You okay? You seem to have an epiphany there.”
It wasn’t supposed to end this way.
Bucky briefly put into words the layout of the base and from what he can gather, the only potential spot regarding Steve’s whereabouts was the operation room.
I'm sorry, Tony but I have to go now. Sam said that an alien named Thanos has come to London after the arrival of the Black Order. Please protect the other Infinity Stones for the sake of the Earth, because I failed protecting my part. I felt like I'm a failure since I know that I have failed you.
“Yeah, it wasn’t pleasant. The doctor, Whitehall or Reinhardt to be exact, wanted my whole body for his experiment: finding a way to merge a lot of powers in one single body. Bastard kept repeating a weird phrase, it’s irritating and scary. I’m glad I don’t have to hear it again.”
Was Tony okay? What would his husband react if his mission went sideways? Did Bucky manage to snap out of HYDRA’s hypnosis?
Great, his mission failed, so he stared at the elevator with defeat. He started to think that maybe he didn’t prepare and embrace himself for this situation although he obviously knew the outcome of this plan. How was he the Captain America when he couldn’t thoroughly lay out a perfect plan to score a date? Was he beginning to lose his professionalism? Or was he incapable with the four-letter word?
Tony put up his neutral face, opened his car door and turned to Steve for the last time. “You alright?”
The doctor entered the room, showing his watch to Tony that he was running out of time to speak with Steve.
And there in front of his own eyes, he lifted up his glasses to witness the aftermath of the surgery. The sight of the reddish, healthy kidney lying magnificently in the void cavity of the abdomen. After more than two hours of intense and detailed surgery, he could finally see the beauty of the organ. He confessed that the soldier’s kidney was distinctive from the ones normal humans have: large in diameter and volume, along with its healing effects that were visible to the naked eye.
"Boss, you might want to see this,"
Bucky’s voice interrupted his thoughts. He looked up and saw a weak smile on his face. “It’s not your fault for what happened to Steve. He would be proud of you instead.”
He was about to blast the window with his iron man suit when the car immediately drove away. To hell with that bastard, he thought.
“At your service, oh captain, my captain,” he propped his arm around Steve and cuddled closer, engulfing the special super-soldier warmth.
“We’re going into stealth mode to avoid being detected. Thor, you’ll be our big guns. Clint, you’re with me.” The two of them nodded.
Tony was scared. The chances to locate Steve became slimmer and slimmer with every hour. And every hour wasted could lessen Steve’s chances to live. He felt like an absolute idiot and he was not going to let that slide away. He was not going to let HYDRA give another painful event for his husband to remember.
A few hours after Tony had visited the dead corpse, all of the registered Avengers and the rogue Avengers attended Steve's funeral, along with Sharon, Nick Fury and Maria Hill. Everyone in New York City and the world didn't knew that the Captain America was given a funeral because of the government's orders.
Tony stretched out his arm, offering a truce to the Winter Soldier. Confused and thankful, Bucky reached out and took his hand. They shook hands, feeling the mutual agreement. He noticed tears lingered in Bucky’s eyes, and maybe he felt the same way. Forgiving him was his final closure to make peace with his past.
"Tony, I know you are not that kind of person and the reason you're here is to find Steve,"
Tony grabbed a stool and sat next to him. He asked what was bothering him moments ago, only for Bucky to look away. It was understandable for him to not spit out their emotions in front of someone they only met an hour ago, and still recovering from his past life. For him, the soldier did a great job at handling his own emotions.
He got up from his seat and ambled towards the window, taking in the sights of Washington D.C. while thinking about his current situation. He won’t leave Steve alone and even if it takes weeks for Steve to wake up, he will stay in this building without failure.
“Yeah,” he took out his handgun from his back pocket, locking its barrel in position. “Don’t give up just yet. Steve is still in there, breathing. He might’ve been sedated and we have a chance to wake him up.”
Reflecting on his choices and thoughts, he had made his solid conclusion. Even though they had their rough moments, Tony always felt like home with the super soldier. Memories like these were bittersweet for the both of them to improve and love each other.
“Yeah?” Tony scoffed, leaving Steve questioning the meaning behind that dismissal. Did Tony doubt him about his expression of care? “Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.”
“I love you too, Steve.”
He stared at the man who was walking in circles around him with his hands behind his back. “Please, do call me Daniel Whitehall. We are in a new era, so we have to change with the times, including me.”
“Some of us aren’t mythical gods,” the archer complained. “Go fetch Cap before I run out of arrows.”
Tony fell to his knees, sobbing loudly. Pepper darted towards the sorrowful man and patted him on his shoulder. She was worried about Tony's current emotions.
“Me too. I thought I wouldn’t have a chance with you since you were with Pepper. I thought you hated me.”
“Let’s not go there, boys, or I have to cut off all your tongues.” She chuckled lightly.
Every previous image in a timespan of a week flooded his mind.
Bruce explained about Bucky’s condition and the temporary neural-inhibiter diluent to the spy twins. Both of them nodded, swore to never let Bucky out of their sights.
He dismissed that thought away. Tony would never give up on him. Both of them vowed to never abandon each other for the rest of their lives at the altar. He loves his man and Tony loves him too. The echo of their wedding reassured him of their solid relationship.
The results showed no traces of the anaesthetic drug. Zero. Nada. Of course HYDRA did the operation on him without the fucking drug. They knew he was a mighty super-soldier and Captain ‘Murica for god’s sake, but they didn’t know about the man behind the flashy cosplay named Steve Rogers, who was also a normal human being and had a heart of red and gold.
Tony. And Bucky.
Yours,
"I f-forgive you, Steve even though you broke my heart, literally and figuratively, and I'm sorry I couldn't say it to you sooner. I'm s-sorry I didn't p-pick up the phone. I didn't know you were suffering with all of this,"
The cycle didn't stop. Tony kept repeating the process without worrying about his health. He ignored all those ted talks from Steve about the disadvantages of drinking alcohol. He didn't care. He wanted to drown in his own fantasy and leave the real world, filled with despair, for a while.
Steve thought of his husband to keep his mind stable and at bay.
He smiled at the genius and closed his eyes. Steve wished he would be by Tony’s side until the end of time and make him the happiest person on Earth.
"I'm sorry, Tony and I love you," Steve said, waiting for a reply but heard a dead line on the other end.
When Steve volunteered to wash the dishes, one by one the Avengers said their wishes and walked towards their respective floors, leaving him and Tony alone as the genius also volunteered to help him. This was his chance to confess and reveal his undying feelings to Tony.
"Steve talked a lot about you until he left this morning," she said. "Every hour he would cry because he regretted for betraying you. He never forgives himself and wished he could go back to the past and fix his relationship with you.
“Pretty sure Mr Metal Arm here is afraid of some ghosts.” Clint patted Bucky’s shoulder jokingly as he noticed the man grimaced when he came close to an unfurnished tombstone.
Fuck, he just couldn't do it. It was tough. Tony missed him so much. He wished Steve would stay with him, agreed with the dumb accords and told him the truth.
“Wait, what about Pepper?”
He collapsed. He failed HYDRA.
Fortunately, from what he could deduct, Steve would live for the next couple of hours if the incision site had been sutured and sealed. He may be one of the smartest men in the entire world, but he wasn’t specialized in biology although he knew the basic fundamentals of the particular study. There’s only one person that could help him at the moment.
“All right. Tony, is there plenty of surgical instruments to do it?” He glanced around the room and found a rack of the equipment. Tony nodded and hummed a yes. “Great, just point the way for me.”
Like some unpredictable mistakes, Whitehall didn’t foresee a sudden disaster in front of him.
He thought he was about to lose his mind with all the shit happening at the same time. Handling them was proven not to be in Steve’s dictionary.
Maybe two is better than one.
Tony became distressed. His mind was telling him to track the last known location of Steve's phone while his body was giving him hints to rest more. He opted to follow his guts.
"I hacked into the London street cameras and saw Steve and the rest are heading to that place just seconds ago," Pepper ended her talk.
As the elevator dinged for the communal floor and its doors swooshes open, Thor grabbed him by his shoulder, his voice ringing out, announcing Steve’s arrival. He saw the rest of team were seated, their plates still loaded with food. Guilt began to develop for letting his friends wait for him. Tony offered a chair beside him and he took the opportunity to sit next to his crush. The six of them indulged in their dinner for the next couple of minutes and they talked a plethora of topics.
“I know, and I’m sorry.”
He completely fell to agree with Tony’s statement. Steve couldn’t imagine if he decided to retire just like Tony. He’s technically a 31-year old man whose journey and responsibility as Captain America was just getting started. The idea of family and stability itself was unfathomable for him to digest because Tony wouldn’t be alongside him anymore, in addition it was just an unrequited love. He had to keep fighting for the man he loved. “The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out.” It was true after all, although he still had hopes for Tony to love him back.
Loud beeps were produced from the heart rate monitor just at the same moment Captain Rogers stirred from his deep slumber.
The Winter Soldier confessed to Tony that he was the one who murdered his parents.
“You. You’re always beautiful… inside and out.”
The A.I. changed the map tab on the screen into the news tab. Tony was confused at first, but eventually watched it.
There was a total silence surrounding them. Thor would always tell the team about his adventurous tales back home. Even if the stories may be exaggerated but authentic, they wouldn’t want to face one of those Asgardian stories if they ever came to Earth. Loki was one of its examples, and the God of Mischief alone had messed up half of New York City. Imagine a larger threat than Loki…
“Yes, we do.” Steve chuckles and they continue to be intimate with each other. “I love you, Tony.”
“That should teach him some manners. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. That discovery was a breaking point for me to think outside of the box. I always wondered the possibilities that somewhere around the planet, there are more people like her – born with gifts, preparing to be unleashed to the world. I like to call them Inhumans. Now, HYDRA is on its way to find more of these people with the help of the Obelisk so that I can experiment with each and every one of them. Their powers are worthier to be in the hands of HYDRA, especially me. Then, we can accomplish world domination, now that our identities have been exposed to the public.
It took Nat and Sam ten hours to travel back to the states with one of Tony's private jets. As the two of them disembarked the plane with Steve's body, Tony rushed towards the corpse. He wanted to convince himself that Steve's death was not an illusion to him. Reality was right; his boyfriend's neck was severely broken and there were no pulses.
“Where the fuck is Steve? Where is he?!” He shouted. Clint and Bruce surrounded the super-soldier, anger written on their faces. Nat stood behind them, watching Bucky getting confined by the team.
He knew the consequences of his actions when he refused to sign the Accords, but he didn’t expect another of his failed plans to be foiled: the outcome for keeping the truth about Tony’s parents. It was too late for him. Turns out, Zemo had knowledge about the death of Howard and Maria Stark and he used this information to tear him and Tony apart as an act of revenge for the destruction of Sokovia. Tony looked devastated and in anguish, probably the first time he saw the man been in a condition like this. He tried to reason Tony but there was no use; the trust and compassion between them shattered and broke into a million pieces. The fight between them was pointless; Steve ordered Tony to stand down but they continued to take up arms. He should’ve known – nobody would listen to him or negotiate with him when his mind was too stubborn to face the truth. Even Tony.
“Oh, Steve.”
Steve didn’t realize a sharp edge of the needle was planted on his neck until he felt dopey and stupefied. This might be his last conscious moment before an everlasting sleep might come knocking on him and they would perform the surgery. No amount of brute could help him escape his metal restraints. The light of the end of his tunnel got a bit teensy-weensy every minute. He wondered if heaven was waiting for him, possibly his Ma. Most likely she anticipated his son’s arrival, to be united after almost a century of seeing each other.
“Promise?”
“You knew him?” The three men asked her in unison, confused with the sudden acknowledgement by the man in front of them. Nat ignored their questions and continued to stare at Barnes.
"Come back... be here, my love,"
After I left, I would have a mental breakdown in the middle of night every day, because I can't stop thinking about you, about how you are living your life without the person who broke your trust. I just hope that soon you will get better without me.
He sighed. This procedure must be in a perfect, flawless flow to obtain the desired outcomes. Clumsy and inadequate actions should not be tolerated under his surveillance as there were no filed records of failed experiments in any history book. It was considered a taboo among HYDRA scholars; many scientists were blacklisted and executed for their incompetency to produce a one-in-a-million result.
He picked up the kidney promptly and lifted it into the air, visualizing the organ as a trophy cup. Satisfaction overfilled inside him as he was too stoked to resume dissecting the captain’s body and harvesting every organ. The surgery just secured his triumph and legacy within HYDRA. He would also become the supreme pioneer for this project. Many younglings will be inspired by his discovery, sparking off profound ideas to contribute to the innovation of Inhuman DNA. Herr Schmidt would be so proud of him, continuing his work for the sake of the organization.
“But–”
Clint suggested they have a midnight snack before resuming their work. Bruce and Nat agreed while Tony was reluctant to accept the offer. At this point, every second counts and there was no time to procrastinate, although a cup of coffee might be useful to fuel him through the night. Steve might be on the verge of danger and he hoped his last resort was not to blast every HYDRA goon who kidnapped his husband until their skins burn.
Their love was radiant as a ray of light
“Back at the tower, all of us place some bets on when will one of you confesses to the other; Thor and I gave you two a month, Clint said in three years while Nat smiled, saying and I quote, “These two idiots won’t confess until one of them dies.” Guess she was right all along.”
"I-I know you are still mad at me, Tony... but you have the right to do so and I'm deeply sorry and apologize for everything I had ever done to you," Steve's voice began to break. "M-maybe I was taking you for granted and you deserved someone else worthy than me,"
Bucky nodded and kicked open the door. No HYDRA goons were wandering around their mossy corridor. All they have to do was to get to the operation room before the time runs out. Bucky led the way in a swift state with Tony treading behind him. He also kept his eyes peeled behind him for any pestering goons that tried to muddle in their way.
“What about Asgardian ghosts?”
Steven Grant Rogers
“I know,” he sighed, wishing all of them would go to therapy after this. “Now, come inside because Steve needs our… help…”
Nat’s face went smug when she scanned Bucky. The said man ran after her and they were locked in an embrace. Not a surprise for him since he noticed the Black Widow always put on worrying glances whenever the words ‘Bucky’ and ‘HYDRA’ were mentioned in a sentence or a conversation. At least, they were reunited safely.
Barnes didn’t look at his way as he was staring at Nat like he did something wrong. Was he afraid that she might kick his ass again, just like their first encounter a few days back? “Natasha?” They heard his raspy, shaky voice for the first time.
“Huh? Friend only?”
He lay on a meadow filled with flowers, watching the glimmering comet gliding across the night sky. Tony’s with him; head on his chest and left arm wrapped around it, taking in his warmth.
"I'm sorry for everything Tony," she said. "About not trusting you and about Steve,"
Love,
“Now, I’m going to tell you about me.” He stated and they were heading towards a place Steve assumed to be another section of this HYDRA lair. “Back in 1989, there was a young woman who had amazing powers. She looked so young that her gifts were similar to one of the super-soldier serum’s abilities: longevity. As a matter of fact, I had met her back in the ’40s, the day I found out the Red Skull was dead because of you. The woman appeared to be ageing at a slow-moving rate.
Sedated? No. He must get out of here. Steve watched Whitehall leisurely exiting the room before looking back at him. “No need for worries, Captain Rogers. Consider this your contribution to the specialization of DNA spectrum.”
“You’re not worried about the bad stench?” The soldier asked, but backed away when the genius hissed at his question and slid through the shaft. Tony didn’t care if he had to create a new gizmo to get rid of the bad smell, Steve’s safety was his top priority. Bucky then entered the bin and followed his best friend’s husband.
If you want to move on without me, it's your choice. But I know deep down in your heart you couldn't do so. I want you to live for me, to carry on our legacy, as a team and as partners.
Tony walked wobbly towards the source of the sound. Eventually his nerve cells weren't transmitting enough impulses throughout his body and his blood pressure increased due to the high alcohol level in his bloodstream, causing him to stumble and fall. His body was lying on the cold, hard floor, unable to move any of his limbs. He channeled his remaining energy and efforts in him to try and crawl and pick up the phone, but it was useless.
He has a point, Tony thought. Both of them have so much to catch up on these past few days. Probably the best thing to do after Steve has been discharged is to immediately go on the planned honeymoon and ignore all calls related to work. They deserved this long vacation.
“It’s all my fault.” He pulled away from the hug and sat cross-legged on the floor. “I let him on the mission. I wasn’t fast enough to debunk all the details on the Winter Soldier and Steve might be dead because of my incompetence.”
“That’s enough information we can get.” Tony stated, immediately rushing to his holographic screen and tapped in the given data. “I think I can put together the pieces of the puzzle. And. There.” He pointed out to the map of the abandoned bank and confirmed the presence of a Quinjet there. Steve was definitely held hostage there, and he had to go to that place before it’s too late.
His thoughts were interrupted by a shouting Rhodey who unexpectedly entered his lab. The War Machine was screaming happily about his finally functioning legs during a test run a few minutes earlier. Rhodey then noticed his best friend was still in his state of grief, so he approached him.
Tony froze for a minute after listening to Pepper's explanation. It can't be, he thought. The vision he witnessed in his dream about a month ago. The word Thanos. The dots were starting to link one another.
“You should go first. I’ll catch up with you guys in a bit.”
Upon hearing the question, he backed off from the hug and slapped his husband on the chest, causing Steve to groan slightly.
“Wait, Bucky and Nat? Together?”
Whitehall pulled apart the plastered tape on his mouth without hesitation. Steve couldn’t help but let out a sore groan. He was outrageous. He had a desire to break free from his restraints and knock this man off senselessly. Sadly, his brute strength couldn’t assist him at the moment.
“But there is one more problem.” Whitehall brought a chair and sat next to his board. “The idea of merging my longevity and other Inhuman gifts might be crucially fatal due to its differences in their DNA bases. Normal people would have purines and pyrimidines as their pillar for a nucleotide, but Inhumans have an unknown extra base in their nucleic acid structure and this type of base varies from one Inhuman to another. When fusing both Inhuman DNAs together, it might cause the double helix structure to be dense, thus hindering genetic information to pass through and ends up with DNA fracture and severe agglutination.”
No, no. It can't be, Tony thought anxiously. His hands were playing with hair stressfully.
“You’ll get there one day.”
“Really, you can do that? Wait, of course you can.” Both of them chuckled. He might start to have a liking for Bucky. “Thank you, Stark.”
“How about we go for another honeymoon?” Tony saw Steve’s eyes lit in excitement. “I’m suggesting… the Maldives.”
Steve nodded. Tony smiled, understanding the captain’s needs and exited the room. He sighed nervously. Steve decided to step up his game to win Tony’s heart as he planned to ask him out after dinner. Within a few minutes, he rushed out of his room to the elevator, head spinning with lightbulb-ideas to spend the night with the genius.
Steve giggled. They had been in this situation before where Tony returned to the tower exhausted and injured after a major scuffle with the alleged ‘Mandarin’ guy. Steve almost had a panic attack after witnessing the absence of the arc reactor’s glow on Tony’s chest. He ran towards the genius, slinging his arms over his and walked him to Tony’s floor. Although Tony had reminded him that he was good, Steve still insisted to help. After Tony described to him about his incident, Steve’s mind went into complete worry. Poor Steve, terrified with the idea of Tony leaving him alone in this world. He had the rest of his friends, sure, but Tony was just… perfect.
I was thinking a lot lately after you didn't pick up my phone. You have the rights to do so because I'm not worthy for you. You deserve someone better than me.
He was thinking a lot about himself and Steve. Lots of thoughts popped up in his mind, giving him a hard time to think properly. Who was the one making mistakes in this relationship? Who was the most loving one between the two of them? Who was the one hurting? He needed a solution to reduce his mental pain.
“It’s a long story,” he chuckled, recollecting the sudden moment, minutes before he and Bucky found Steve. “Anyways, the team and my family send their regards; Thor came back, Happy gave you chocolates and Sam did visit.”
“I went to the Smithsonian before sprinting here. There was an exhibition of Steve and your name was on it. They said you’re one of the three smartest men in the world, so I trust you to help me. Help me get this HYDRA programming out of my head.” He looked at Nat sadly. “I can’t trust my own mind right now.”
As he opened his eyes, he noticed two things happening all of a sudden: Tony was missing by his side and the shooting star was charging towards him. Did the heavens denied his wishes, or was he unworthy to make such a wish? His thoughts didn’t matter because the fiery meteor became bigger and bigger by the second. If this was his ending, Steve could accept it – he had savoured his precious days with the person he loved the most, even if it meant his lover would leave him before he could say the three holy words.
“I’m not your fucking lab rat!” Steve growled, trying to snap the metal straps with maximum force. “You won’t get away with this, Whitehall!”
“For almost a year I had been researching about an object named the Obelisk – believed by Schmidt himself that it holds the key to something I fully didn’t understand because everyone that touches it dies. I experimented with the Obelisk’s powers on different types of people, ranging from gender to race; they all gave the same, lethal result. Until I met this woman. My men forced her to touch it and she wasn’t affected. On the plus side, the Obelisk glowed for the first time, in front of my own eyes.”
He's not going to take revenge on Bucky. Doing so won’t bring back his dead mom. The past had left him and he had moved on. This guy didn’t deserve it too; Bucky was coerced into doing a lot of worst things in his life, only for his memories to be wiped off every single damned mission, just like a robot. He didn’t even get to grow old and live his life. This was Bucky’s second chance to live normally and find his true identity. And Tony’s going to be the man to help him.
Tony shook his head while the whole world stopped revolving, white noise interfering with his hearing. What did he just listen to? Nope. That can’t be real. His parents died in an accident; the coroners have confirmed their autopsies. He remembered his mom said they were on a business trip, never informing him on what kind of business. Unless…
A few hours more and he would unlock the secret to his immortality and soon gain new gifts. Maybe Captain America had its own uses to HYDRA after all. He might have to buy a poster of the soldier to remember his act of service. Besides, a major discovery does require experimentation.
Demise surrounded him with darkness.
Was his choice of saving Bucky and leaving Tony alone in the Siberian bunker worth it? If he did the opposite, would things resolve or combust even more? Either way, he figured that Tony will hate and despise him in an indefinite period – presumably hated him since the very beginning. Tony probably didn’t care about him; the genius possibly had incinerated his truce/apology letter and threw away the burner phone. Steve was fine, he appreciated the fact that he was bound to not be with Tony.
"Thank you, Nat. It means a lot to me, especially now that he is gone forever," Tony shed his tears. "We didn't have our proper goodbyes,"
He nodded. “Yes, please.” She grinned and stood up, lifted the genius, and walked through the door. Then, Pepper took out her phone and immediately dialled Happy. Tony was grateful to have supportive and caring friends like her since he started his journey as Iron Man. She, along with Rhodey and Happy, was another family he never had in the first place. He couldn’t imagine a world without them in it.
As they were boarding the Quinjet, a group of clouds formed around them, indicating the presence of someone they have been missed for a while. A radiant beam of white light shone just next to their jet, revealing their teammate and friend.
He landed himself on the sidewalk and entered the five-story apartment with his regular clothes. The tracked signal led him to a studio room. Between Tony and the room was a wooden door with a 'do-not-disturb' sign on its doorknob. He approached the door and twisted the doorknob, ignoring the hanging warning. To his surprise, the door wasn't locked and he went inside the studio.
“I promise you this will be the last one,” he grinned. “No more of that nasty liquid.”
He resumed his disturbed previous cyber hunt at Stark Industries and started digging up all of HYDRA’s data from his private server. He also requested his A.I. to call in his available teammates to have a small meeting on the communal floor. According to JARVIS, all of them were present at the moment except for Thor, who was currently not on Earth. The Prince of Asgard once mentioned a few months back that he had to run a few errands back home after an alien spacecraft nearly wiped out Greenwich.
He recognized the voice anywhere, even if its sound frequency barely passes the threshold of hearing. Steve was calling his name and happy tears trickled down his cheek. Tony placed his palm gently on his husband’s face, drawing in the fine features he fell in love within the first place and the distressed feeling displayed on the blonde’s face.
The three of them walked to the hangar where the Aven-Jet was located. At the loading bay of the jet, Nat and Clint were making provisions with their stingers and arrows. Tony whistled to them, gaining their attention.
Suddenly, his brief happiness and drowsiness was interrupted by a familiar sound. It was the flip phone's ringtone. Steve was trying to reach him. His hopes skyrocketed in his mind, wanting to hear Steve's voice again.
Steve’s face formed a smile, a genuine one. Happiness bloomed in him as the man he still loved came to help reverse Thanos’ snap. Nat, Scott and him once tried approaching the genius but he rejected, stating that he should cherish every moment with his wife and daughter. That statement broke him to bits – Tony was married during the five-year span; a long time stretch since he last saw the man lying on a bed unconscious and he didn’t know about it.
"Hey, it's gonna be okay," Rhodey reassured him with a smile. "If you need any help, I'll be there for you,"
“Will do.” Bruce answered.
“Leave that to me,” Nat intercepted. “Retrieval of the information went well.”
“You don’t have to apologize, Steve.” Tony puts his hand on the soldier’s cheek, wiping the remaining tear tracks. “I forgive you a long time ago, for everything.”
“Yeah. I think so.” She picked up a pen and twirled it randomly with her fingers. “I’m just... having a hard time processing everything in the past few days; HYDRA and S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap is kidnapped, Sharon’s, Sam’s and Hill’s leads came to a dead-end and the return of the Winter Soldier.”
“Friend Tony, don’t worry about us,” Thor pitched in and he heard shrieks of pain from the goons. “We can handle this.”
He took out a gun beneath his scrubs, aimed at the said doctor’s legs and fired. The bullet managed to graze below his kneecaps. The man stumbled to the floor and turned his head towards Whitehall, his black eyes begging for mercy.
He can sense it. His husband is a hundred percent inside the building. God forbid, if Bucky leads them to the trap, he’s gonna kill that son-of-a-bitch. But, he trusted the Winter Soldier to aid them along in this mission because he recognized a sincere attitude when he sees one. He’s glad Steve had chosen the right friend to live with throughout the early 19th century.
But at the moment, Tony was alone and yes, he did received gifts from Rhodey, Pepper and even his mentee but he wasn't in the mood to be happy. His birthday seemed dull without Steve.
The billionaire requested FRIDAY to broadcast the latest headlines on his holographic screen, or his new-fangled magic picture box, according to Steve.
The envelope was from Steve. He gently flipped open it and there was a letter in it. Tony began to read it under his umbrella.
After he finished his sentence, Steve was instantly injected with the syringe. The effects of the fluid kicked in within seconds: he couldn’t feel his fingers, feeling light-headed and his body became weaker and weaker with every attempt of movement. He tried to fiddle with his wedding ring, but he couldn’t feel the polished surface of the ring. His vision went blurry caused by the tears forming in his eyes. He was not going to break his promise with Tony on going through everything together. This will not be his ending.
Was this the end of all his endings? Certainly.
So much for evolving across generations when their main goal didn’t change a bit: world domination. Same old HYDRA with their ‘cut off one head, two shall replace’ motto. He wished he could sniff out any infiltrators back in the day and have them executed by the law.
“Yeah, man. Cap is literally one of the reasons why I joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in the first place.” The archer stepped closer towards them. “I owe my whole life to him. If he’s dead-”
Everything was going to be okay.
Supposedly, after this mission in London, I wanted to return to you, apologise a lot to you and might propose to you. But, now that I'm gone, it was just a mindless dreaming.
After ten minutes of driving, Happy pulled up the limousine and announced that they have arrived at the tower. Tony said his thanks again and quickly made his way to his lab. The genius activated his holographic screen and it showed various sources of his missing husband.
“Turns out, the answer to the problem is right in front of me.” The scientist grinned, already risen to head towards another door of the room. “I have been studying the super-soldier serum formula for years and it is the only recipe to stabilize multiple Inhuman DNAs simultaneously. Don’t you worry about your pretty face, I only need all of your organs for my future projects. A syringe of your blood isn’t enough to accomplish my vision.”
“No-”
"Sharon?"
And just like that, Steve shut his mouth and formed a wide smile. “You know me so well, huh?”
It took a couple of hours before the groggy effects were worn off from his body. He rushed towards the living room and took hold of the phone. The billionaire flipped the phone open and saw two notifications on the small screen. One missed call and one unread message. He decided to read the message first which turned out to be a voice message left by Steve. Tony turned up the volume and held the phone's speakers close to his ears.
Steve grabs the man’s cheeks and bring his lips close to Tony’s, sealing the distance between them. He feels like falling from cloud nine. The taste of Tony’s lips is luxurious and tender and he craves for more. Is this pretend? Tony must have felt the same way because he is also passionately kissing the soldier with love and lust.
He and Nat turned around, smiling at Bucky’s curiosity. Maybe he could be on the team, he thought.
“You mean
“What?” He was confused. Did Tony actually love him and didn’t hate him after all this time?
Another tedious meeting for the day, he thought.
” Tony countered Bruce’s reply. Nat then gave a loud cough for the both of them to pay attention to her.
“Who’s Bobbi? Clint’s girlfriend?” Bruce handed him his cup of coffee and Tony immediately took a sip.
He gave a nod to Bruce, and the scientist began injecting a high dose of painkillers and sedatives into Steve’s body. Tony saw his husband began to relax and his eyes started to close, indicating that the effects have kicked in. The genius put on a smile, in hopes Steve would have good dreams when under sedation.
“I thought we have established that,” he kissed him on his tender lips, wet with affection and desire. Despite a tube from the infusion pump was inserted through his right arm, Steve did his best to pull the genius close and deepened their kiss. It was perfect as they ached for each other so much. This was their first kiss since Steve left for the mission – their only comfort when they were apart was having late-night video calls. They broke off their kiss and Steve placed his head on Tony’s shoulder. “Love you too, silly head.”
“It’s
Bucky backed off and avoided him, horror scribbled on his face. Deep in his heart, Tony really wanted to strangle the man in front of him for murdering his mom. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair that he lost one of his life supports at the age of twenty-one. His mother could still be alive to this day if it wasn’t for Mr Staring Machine here. Gosh, now he had to deal with this emotional burden all over again – the denial, the depression, the grief and everything in between.
"You have an appointment with your mentee Peter Parker in an hour, so make sure to get ready," she informed her long-life business partner.
The walk back to his temporary room left him crestfallen. He kept his head low to hide his sad face, despite getting a handful of stares from the people of Wakanda. Steve didn’t care, his life came undone after the so-called Civil War. The thought itself made him uncomfortable.
“I can come with you if you want.” Sam offered.
Now, looking at his empty coffee cups and then at Steve, he probably would think that his husband will lecture him if he ever found out Tony had been drinking more than a cup of coffee without a meal to accompany with. The thought alone made him smile to himself, wishing they were back to their lovely domesticity at the tower right now without any villains devastating their moment.
For Tony, his friendship with the team had grown significantly for the past two years. All six of them were so different yet had the same values; Thor frequently beats Clint in a video game even though he is an Asgardian, Bruce falling asleep while watching a late-night movie, Nat grocery shopping all by herself and sometimes bought her stuff only, and he and Steve… so many memories, ranging from their bickering to their intense kissing and to their honeymooning. And so far, they were all living the best of their lives in the tower because they had each other.
Being alone was better for him than getting together.
“If you say so, although I’m not entirely buying it.”
Stark. Tony Stark.
“I’m sorry.” Soon after he said it, Tony punched Bucky in his teeth, causing the super-soldier to crash on the floor. Bruce, who witnessed the scuffle in front of him, continued on finishing the diluent before a major brawl might happen in front of him.
When she mentioned the Winter Soldier, he noticed Nat frowned and looked away, seemingly avoiding to say his name out loud. Tony knew Nat was injured when she first encountered the mindless assassin in Iran, but why did she become nostalgic about it?
Unfortunately, Tony didn’t notice the presence of his sweet and annoying closest friend standing in front of him. When did Pepper enter his office unnoticed?
Tony threw the flip phone towards the wall with an amount of force, but the phone didn't break or had a single dent on it. He was frustrated and began to fret about Steve's whereabouts. Tears were streaming down his face as he felt guilty for not picking up the phone. He slumped against the TV cabinet, crying his eyes and heart out.
Tony stretched out his right arm into the air, signalling JARVIS to initiate Grab-and-Blast Protocol. An Iron Man gauntlet – from the Mark XLII armour, his latest model – flew in his direction. It wrapped itself around Tony’s right hand with a hissing sound and he aimed the repulsor at the man. He also noticed Bruce getting behind him while Nat and Clint defending themselves with a gun and arrow respectively. How did they get their gear so fast and were they keeping their weapons underneath the couch this whole time?
Blood vessels that were unassociated to the renal part of the body were clamped with a few hand retractors. The retractors were also used to keep the incision site wide open for him to carry on with the operation.
He aimed his repulsor and blasted at the corpse’s body with a large burst of concussive force, leaving a circular scorch mark on the chest. That felt kinda good, he thought.
“Just spit it out, Rogers. I know you have been dying to say it.” A Cheshire cat smile appears on the genius’ face. Does this mean…
“JARVIS, any news about Steve?” Tony spoke into his StarkPad that Pepper gave him before exiting the building.
