‘You don’t think something will happen? One of us will get attacked?’ Wanda asks, a worried frown on her face.
Wade doesn’t respond, just pushes Peter’s mask up to his nose and presses a kiss to his lips. ‘I got my very own spider-kiss!’
‘No boss, there’s one more body underneath the rubble but I’m not sure you’ll be able to get a positive ID by sight.’
‘Well of course, Captain Rumlow,’ Tony shrugs. ‘Sergeant Barnes is the first soldier to have received one of our prosthesis, why would I not want him as part of my personal security team? Not only would it show how successful we have been, but it enables me to monitor the arm in the coming months and years to see what issues may arise and how easily they can be solved. It will make it easier to improve subsequent models.’
'I don't know,' he admits, eyes scanning every car he can see; he reaches into his pocket for his phone to give Sam a call. He knows what's coming before it happens, but he can't stop it without being too fast for a normal kid. As the boys come closer he nudges Ned out the way and takes the full force of the shove from both of the boys; he doesn't catch himself, falling to the floor and wincing at the pain in his knees and hands.
I hope you all enjoy this chapter and the one I'll be posting in a day or two. And to everyone who is watching End Game: stay strong! We'll get through this together! (Though I've been psyching myself up for two weeks to watch it and I'm in no way prepared!)
Steve finds he can’t form words around the lump in his throat as Rhodes stands up to leave, patting his shoulder as he does and leaving the super soldier with his thoughts.
‘I passed,’ Bucky’s grin is wider than Steve’s seen it since before the war, his friend’s face filling the screen in front of him.
‘It’s like a sixth sense,’ Peter explains, ‘it lets me know if I’m in danger. Anything from something being thrown at me, to helping me dodge punches, to someone who wants to hurt me. It’s a bit like an alarm system. But around Deadpool it’s never gone off.’ He snatches the apple out of the air that Bucky’s just thrown at him without turning round. Then throws it back and turns and glares at the dark haired man. ‘Told you.’
Tony’s reply is a shrug as he takes the lid off the box. He puts a fist to his mouth, Steve assumes to keep back any noise he was about to make, and, reaching in, takes out a small handgun.
‘Let us take the smaller branches off now and then we can drag it to where we shall have the feast,’ Thor cuts across the bickering. ‘Then it will be easier for us to go and carve the table when we have spare time.’
Clint laughs and grins up at him. ‘Hulk, buddy, if it weren’t for you there would have been no point in me being here. We missed you, Big Guy, it’s good to have you back.’
‘No,’ he shrugs Steve’s arms off, ‘don’t blame yourself. I’m the idiot that can’t be honest about the fact I’m not perfect.’ He ignores any other comments and heads for the door. ‘I’m going to lay down for a bit. I’ll see you at dinner.’
This time when he falls, he lets go of Wanda, her body rolling an arm’s length away. He thinks he can see Steve fighting to get back towards them, but black clad soldiers have materialised out of the mist between them.
‘Alright you lot,’ Bucky roars over the noise, ‘now it’s your turn! Get into groups of four and lets see how well you can do.’ As everyone starts to get into their groups he joins the two of them. ‘Well done, boys, got to admit I’m impressed you both made it without a dunk in the mud.’
‘From information I have access to it appears she has not been making enough money to cover repairs. The ship is falling apart and can’t run efficiently enough to make enough.’
Steve feels like breaking something. Preferably Rumlow’s neck. He knows what Tony’s going to say before he answers. ‘The hit, Captain Rumlow, was on me. I was lucky. Or you’re not quite as good a sniper as you think you are.’
‘It is!’ Wade agrees quickly, looking back to Peter. ‘It’s just… you’re the first person whose seen my face and hasn’t reacted with some form of disgust. I hadn’t prepared myself for any part of me to be called “gorgeous” so I just…panicked.’
After a lot of coaxing, Tony had agreed to let himself be fed with some veggies (Steve's word, not Tony's) and some chicken nuggets that had undoubtedly been meant for kids – Tony didn’t recall seeing adults eating animals-shaped nuggets ever. The only thing Steve had allowed him to grab with his hands had been the sippy cup filled with apple juice. A sippy cup which Tony hadn’t been too keen to use, he was perfectly capable of drinking from a normal cup and he was sure there were plenty of cups with childish designs among the ones Steve could have chosen from.
Thus, waiting didn’t seem to be the best option. No matter how Tony looked at it, it was better to get this over and done with as soon as possible.
“Does my baby need a change?” Steve asked as he stepped into the room, startling Tony. That question was not meant to embarrass Tony or nothing of the sort. Steve hoped the tone of his voice was able to show him that, since he was trying to sound as affectionate and understanding as possible.
Tony's and Clint's relationship? Well, every time I picture this verse, I imagine them not getting along that well. I don't know, I guess the fact that I've seen some of my friends' kids doing the same had influenced my point of view. I mean, my friends think that their kids are gonna be very good friends just because they are the same age and we are friends, but sometimes it doesn't work that way.
“That you want you both to try age playing,” Phil stated just like that, and Steve had to cough a few times to avoid choking with his own saliva.
"You can take this stupid speech of yours and shove it up your ass Rogers. I don’t believe you. I haven't been able to figure out what exactly you'd get from all this, but I'm sure as hell you won't. If you keep this fucking charade, I'll fucking kick your ass," Tony snapped, glaring at Steve as he got rid of his grip violently.
Eventually, Steve knew that he –or maybe Tony himself– would get it refurnished, he had already been looking through a lot of websites –JARVIS was very helpful for this– where children’s stuff for adults were sold. He had already thought about getting some stuff, but restrained himself from doing it, afraid that Tony would get mad at him for it. Despite that, it was still a shame that Tony had destroyed all of the nursery’s furniture; the furniture might not have been pieces of art, but everything that he had built had been simple and symmetric, yet beautiful.
With his own hands, Tony crushed every single one of the bars of the crib and threw the pieces around the room. The pillows and the mattress were ripped open and the stuffing was yanked out easily, until they were empty shells with nothing left inside. The rocking chair and the changing table were used as a baseball bat and baseball respectively, neither one of them looked like they used to after all the batting. The wallpaper was torn off meticulously, until the only thing that could be seen was were the a white walls. All the bottles, diapers, and other supplies that were kept in the changing table drawers had been piled up and turned into ash – well, Tony might have made use of the repulsor beams, but only a little. Everything was completely destroyed. Total destruction was necessary in order to avoid anything possibly being fixed.
“Can you tell Steve to come?” Tony asked as he sat up, feeling bad enough to crave for Steve’s care.
So, it turned out Tony could actually be a ‘little’, not just pretend to be. That was good news, wasn’t it? If Tony wanted this to work out, falling into that kind of headspace was essential, otherwise he would never cease to feel just like an adult wearing a diaper playing a kid. Steve might get frustrated if all this was only genuine for him. But what had just happened proved it could be genuine for Tony too. That was definitely good news then, Tony did want this to work out.
When Tony was a child, he had barely had toys. Whether it had been because Howard hadn't allowed it or because his mother had been too busy dealing with other things to realized his son didn't have anything to play with, Tony didn't know nor care anymore. Besides, it hadn't really mattered that much, by the time Tony could have cared about not having anything to entertain himself with, he had been sent to boarding school, where maturing was indispensable and toys didn’t help with that process.
That didn’t help to ease his anxiety or shame at all, because right after Steve said that, he lifted Tony’s hips and slipped the diaper under him.
All of a sudden, Tony’s chest tightened to the point where breathing was becoming almost impossible, something that turned to be fairly painful when the sobs caught in his throat began demanding to be let loose, and the attempts of his lungs to expand to get more air didn't yield results. Tears started welling up in his eyes, and the mixture of a blurry vision and chocking sensation made Tony dizzy. He needed to calm down and think things through. He wasn't going to allow himself to lose it over something like that. If those things ended up happening, Tony was going to man up, suck it up, and deal with the consequences in a dignified manner.
By the time they reached the elevator and rode it to Tony’s floor, the breathing Steve felt against his neck became rhythmic, Tony had undoubtedly gone back to sleep. Steve was grateful for that, it was always easier to deal with Tony when he was already asleep.
After that afternoon he had come to realize he could achieve such mindset, Tony had fallen into it just three more times. One after a fairly awful battle, in which Steve had scared the hell out of everybody as he had pretended to die to surprise the enemy. Another after the annual Stark Expo, which Tony always enjoyed but utterly exhausted him. If Tony also took into account what he considered to be have been the first time, everything seemed to indicate that what sent him into his little headspace was stress, experiencing strong and staggering emotions.
“I… I just–,” Tony trailed off, looking at his toes as if they were the most fascinated thing he’d ever seen.
“Morning, sunshine,” Steve greeted one more time, unsure whether Tony’s brain had been lucid enough to register his first greeting or not. Tony didn’t answer, he just stared at him with his brows still drawn up in confusion. “What is it, sweetheart?” he asked as he brushed a wisp of hair off Tony’s forehead, his body tensing, afraid of Tony’s reaction.
“Tell who what?” Steve asked without taking his eyes off Clint, who was sitting on the floor very close to the TV. Phil had asked him to get away from it because he was going to harm his eyesight, but if Clint tended to be a bit too careless about these things, his Little self was worse.
“Good, because I’m not planning on wasting the afternoon, Pepper won’t be happy if I don’t meet the deadline,” Tony stated, voice determined. That was a lie, of course, because Steve knew the only times Pepper really got mad at Tony was when he missed a meeting or fell behind in the paperwork he was supposed to look over and sign.
Steve wasn’t Clint’s daddy. Clint had his own daddy, and his daddy was perfectly sound and safe. Why hadn’t Phil stepped up and dealt with his Little’s distress? That was his job as a daddy, wasn’t it? Why had Clint had to be usurping Tony’s place? If anyone had to be on Steve’s lap that should’ve been Tony, unquestionably, because Steve was
“I still don’t know what I’d like to do,” Tony acknowledged, face hidden in the crock of Steve’s neck.
"Hey, no, no. You're not falling asleep in the shower," Phil warned, shaking him gently but firmly. Clint just grunted miserably. "No, come on. We already made Tony wait too much."
“Well, you weren’t planning on leaving this mess like this, were you?” Steve asked with a disapproving tone of voice. Tony groaned loudly as he let himself fall back on the floor. He should have built that maid robot before opening the boxes.
“Well, wherever it was where you were taking me,” Tony said, voice a bit annoyed. “Seriously Steve, I’m busy, Pepper’s gonna be furious if those papers are not signed by tomorrow morning.”
“Okay, see you later then,” Steve uttered before leaning forward and pressing a quick kiss to Tony’s lips.
When all the food had been eaten and the table had been cleaned up – seriously, nobody understood why Steve made them do that themselves if Tony had a lot of people take care of the cleaning of the Tower – they decided to move into to the living room. It wasn't movie night, but somehow they had made the habit of watching a movie after a difficult and long battle.
Phil raised a confused eyebrow. “Is that it? You don’t want me to diaper you because I’m not your daddy?” he inquired. Tony didn’t answer, though he didn’t need to, the burning on his face did it for him. “Okay, okay, it’s okay,” he said more to himself than for Tony, “I tell you what, why don’t you wear a pull-up? You can put it on, and you can take if off whenever you feel like going to the bathroom,” he proposed, and he was relief when Tony didn’t seem to dislike the idea.
Tony lifted Raawry so he could hug it to his chest, suddenly overwhelmed by how badly he felt like crying.
Allowing himself to suck on his thumb, Tony snuggled up to Steve and closed his eyes. Tomorrow he would deal with this whole situation. Tomorrow he would check JARVIS’ code. Tomorrow he would talk to Steve about minding his own business. Tomorrow he would hear that inner voice that told him how wrong this was. Yes, tomorrow he would face reality. Tomorrow, because right now Tony would let himself enjoy the moment.
“You must be hungry, you haven’t eaten anything,” Steve pointed out as he ran a hand through his hair, feeling more and more frustrated by the minute. A caregiver was supposed to make sure littles were safe and content, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he had been doing a lame job up until now.
"Of course you can, kiddo," Steve agreed, chuckling when Clint shook his hand anxiously so Steve let go of it and ran into the room, straight to the toy chests.
“No, I take it back… I take it back, I don’t want this anymore… let me go, please, let me go!” Tony demanded, panic in his voice, as he succeeded in turning around and crawling a little away from the captain before this one caught him by the ankle and pulled him back.
‘I agree,’ Vision adds. ‘Not only is it showing we care about the local communities, but it will give people a chance to actually meet us face-to-face. Perhaps we should do some randomly distributed tickets? So members of the public can come as well?’
He can’t help it. The memory that comes to mind first is one of the many times he was recalibrated. His present screams mix in with his past self, echoing around the workshop.
‘I think they might,’ Peter interrupts, his voice quiet. He’s trying to remember something he read in Strange’s library. ‘We might want to ask Doctor Strange, but I seem to remember something in a book in his library about a multi-verse. How there are infinite versions of us out there all created from different choices we made. Like, remember how he looked at all of those futures before the Battle of Wakanda?’
After that odd entrance of Tony, he had remained glued to Steve, and he had refused to let go of him no matter what. Steve didn’t really mind, there was no way he was going to leave Tony unattended, especially when he was crying; though he had to admit that dealing with Clint while he had all Tony’s limbs around him almost strangling him wasn’t easy. It had been an odyssey just to get Tony to let go so Steve could dress Clint, and Tony had only agreed to be put down on the floor, but not to get away from him.
Steve sighed heavily before smiling in a way that was everything but happy, “we still suck at communicating, don’t we, JARVIS?”
And from then on, Steve had soaked up everything JARVIS helped him to find about Age Play on the Internet. What a headspace was, the age ranges it covered, how some people liked to pretend they were children of the opposite gender, and so on. The more Steve knew about the topic, the less likely it’d be to mess things up when hanging out with little Clint.
“No!” Tony shouted, and he covered his mouth with his hands right after, eyes wide open in realization of his slip-up.
“What’s the matter?” Steve questioned with a frown on his face, straightening up a little as he turned down the TV volume.
By the time Clint and Tony were all clean up and apparently calm down, Steve was more than ready to go to bed, the fact that is hadn’t even started to get dark outside not being important. His idea of putting them down for a nap sounded more appealing than ever now. He took a book from the shelves before getting comfortable on the bed, allowed Tony to climb onto his lap and began reading. If that didn’t make them fall sleep, Steve didn’t know what he was going to do. His eyelids felt extremely heavy, and it was a matter of time before he fell asleep himself.
“I thought we were getting cookies,” Steve commented, and the word ‘cookies’ was all Clint needed to forget about the diaper.
“Stories are for babies,” Clint argued, sulking. Steve had noticed Clint was paying more attention to the story than to the cars he was playing with on the floor, though Steve thought it would be better not to point that out.
Steve would never frown on Tony’s habit of sneaking out of a hospital before being discharged – or examined, for that matter – because he had been about to do exactly the same when Phil entered the room with the discharge documentation in hand. Good, a picture of Captain America jumping out of a window, bandaged and in a splint, would certainly make headlines and cause a big commotion. Steve had enough problems to deal with right now to have to do some damage control with the press on top of that.
“Captain Rogers, the pizza’s arrived,” JARVIS announced, in the exact moment in which Steve was driving himself crazy trying to decide who he should comfort first.
“So am I,” Tony assured, “Have you ever touched his hair? It’s literally and figuratively not from this world! I’ve been trying to talk him into starring a shampoo commercial, and last time he almost agreed, but Jane didn’t let him.” Steve couldn’t help chortling.
Whenever Steve tried to stand up to put him down in the crib, Tony would wake up and refuse to be put away. Steve got it, he wouldn’t have minded holding his baby all the time he slept, but he also thought it was a good idea for him to take the nap in the crib after having acknowledged he liked it. Therefore, Steve waited patiently, and after several more minutes and two more failed attempts, he was able to move Tony around without waking him up.
“Are you sure?” Tony asked, stopping himself from leaning on Steve by keeping both hands holding Steve’s shoulders, arms not bending at all.
Now the only thing Tony needed to do was get used to that little headspace, because his first experience with it had been quite scary. Tony had never needed someone as much as he had needed daddy right now, and he wasn’t sure how to cope with that. Daddy had been there today, but what would Tony do if he needed him as badly as he had now and daddy wasn’t there?
After that event, after those couple of days he had spent under the care of Phil, his head had been a wreck. Those days had been embarrassing, it would take Tony a lot of time to be able to face Phil without setting his cheeks on fire – though, for that to happen, Tony needed to stop avoiding him first. Nevertheless, excruciating wasn’t exactly the word Tony would use to describe the whole experience, but terrifying. Tony had been terrified.
“There where?” Steve asked, positioning Tony in the middle of the room, right where he could have a look at everything there was there.
Steve smiled satisfyingly once more before turning on his heels and walking towards the door, his mind already thinking about what the best way to take Tony to the room would be, without being too suspicious.
“There you go, keep it up,” Steve said when he saw Tony settling down, allowing himself to smile a little. “I mean it Tony, I’m Ok with his, I even would like to help,” he continued once he thought Tony was completely settled down. “Let me help you.” But that last sentence just unsettled him again.
“Don’t like it,” Clint complained, scowling. Or that was what Steve thought Clint tried to do, because his pushed-out lips and pink cheeks made it look more like a pout.
“I beg your pardon?” Steve asked, taken aback. What on earth had Phil meant by that? Why on earth wouldn’t Clint want to be around him? As far as Steve knew, Clint loved hanging out with him, especially when he was Little. Even if Steve didn’t hesitate to scold Clint when he was stepping out of line, he did let him get away with things that he normally wouldn’t when Phil was in charge, like eating more sweets, playing video games for more time or going to bed past his bedtime. That had earned him the title of ‘favorite uncle’, so what Phil said made no sense. Perhaps Steve had misheard.
“Kiddo, relax, nobody’s here. Everybody left an hour ago. And I already checked with JARVIS, there’s no one awaked anymore,” Steve informed, tightening his grip as a way to soothe him. It took Tony some minutes to relax, drowsiness making his brain take more time than usual to process the information.
“I’m afraid any of your pants would fit over the pull-up, buddy,” Phil stated, and by Tony’s expression, he could tell Tony hadn’t liked hearing that.
“I strongly suggest a break, Sir, perhaps spending some time with Captain Rogers will avoid you the inconvenience of having to sign everything all over again.”
“Are you working on a watch?” Steve asked from where he was suddenly standing over him, startling Tony into falling out of the chair. When the hell had Steve arrived?
“I'm sorry buddy, but your daddy's not here,” Phil informed, regretting letting those words out of his mouth almost immediately. Tony’s sobbing worsened considerably. “Hey, hey, take it easy buddy, your daddy’s not here, but Uncle Phil is,” he dared to say. Hopefully, referring to himself using such term would make Tony feel more comfortable with him being there. Or that could also cause him to retract more.
"I know sir, but as I said earlier, your instructions were very specific and clear. And if I may say sir, you haven't finished.” And with this, Steve couldn't help to chuckle once more, earning another glare from Tony.
“No,” Tony told him as he grabbed the waistband of his jeans, preventing Steve from pulling them down. Steve got a little bit surprised, he really thought Tony was more than asleep.
your fault. Any of this was. In no way. Battles are unpredictable, when we signed up for this we knew bad things could happen, we can’t always come out unharmed. This time it was my turn, and you had nothing to do with that,” he assured, face stern but somehow gentle at the same time.
But if Steve was intentionally pushing Tony out of his comfort zone, he also made sure to reassure and praise Tony every time he did something childish, however insignificant it was. Calling him 'daddy' always earned Tony some cuddles and kisses, drinking from a bottle was always accompanied by praises, and so on. Steve wanted Tony to link good feelings with every experience, since he was certain that would help him to eventually become totally comfortable with all this – the way Tony shyly smiled every time he was told he was a good boy was proof of that.
What Tony wasn’t counting on was how deep and fast he would fall into his littlespace once he saw Steve. With little Clint. When he opened the door of his bathroom – where JARVIS had informed him Steve was – and saw Steve bathing Clint as the latter played with
“So I’m imagining things? You don’t behave differently every time we have Clint over?” Steve remarked.
However, Tony couldn’t just go to Steve and tell him he had changed his mind after how he had reacted, could he? He knew Steve had been more than willing to play a father for him, but what if he had changed his mind too due to Tony’s outburst? Or what if Steve hadn’t and Tony’s curiosity turned out to be just the result of having an unfulfilled idea in his brain, and after trying it he discovered he didn’t like it after all?
It was a shame that that feeling of relief lasted less than a minute. Phil was expecting to find a sleeping Clint on the bed, after all, he had already been sleepy and it had taken Phil quite a long time to deal with Tony; but what never occurred to Phil was to find an empty bed. Where the hell had Clint gone? If Phil was dreading the idea of having to look for Tony all over the tower in case he ran away and hid, having to do the same for Clint was even worse. Tony didn’t climb vents, but Clint did.
“Wait a minute,” Tony heard Steve saying when he was few inches away from the living room. Those were good news, Steve hadn’t left. He might have gotten bored and had come outside to watch some TV while Tony slept. He hastened his steps, the urge for being cuddled by Steve becoming impossible to quell, and Tony would have run towards him instead stopping dead if Clint hadn’t been standing right between Steve’s legs, struggling to get away.
Tony kept his eyes fixed on him for some more seconds before turning around to see the outfits. His face contacted a little, the frown marring the skin between his brows indicating he was actually trying to make decision. Good. He hadn't showed any signs of wanting to back out so far, and Steve was extremely grateful for that.
Without further notice, Steve slid his hands under his armpits and scooped him up. Tony tensed, and let go of the teddy bear he hadn't realized he was still holding so he could cling to Steve. No matter how many times Steve did that, Tony’s brain refused to understand he was not going to fall.
"That's it, you can go," Steve announced, giving Clint a playful smack on his behind when he turned around to go and sit down on the floor in front of the TV. His diapered bottom.
‘Well…it’s more I have a friend who’s a brain surgeon who ends up being the only doctor who can stand me long enough to actually treat me. Plus he knows even
‘Even I know what Christmas is, brother,’ Loki rolls his eyes, ‘how have you been able to avoid knowledge of it?’
‘Thanks, Karen. It’s good to hear your voice. Guys? I’m suited up. Deadpool’s got a comms link and is taking Ned to the roof. Can someone take him to the jet?’
The door of the plane opens and a soldier steps out, rifle held ready in his arms as he stands to one side; another two follow him out and quickly make their way down the stairs, standing to attention at either side of the bottom. All of their attention fixed on the door of the aeroplane.
Sam and Quill both let out shouts of surprise as their legs are taken out from under them and they end up dangling from the trees by their ankles.
As they pull away he hears the satisfying click of the cuffs and feels some of the tension leave his shoulders as Bucky rubs the skin around his wrist. ‘Welcome back to America, Barnes. I hope you didn’t pack for a short stay.’
against his armour and Tony looks down to see the Mind Stone glowing on the back of his gauntlet. ‘What the-’
‘AC/DC too loud?’ she smirks. ‘Obviously you didn’t have Peter in the room when you were testing them.’
Ever since Tony had walked off that spaceship with Nebula supporting him, and the genius had collapsed into his arms it’s taken every shred of his self-control not to pull the shorter man back to him.
‘Palladium. Exactly Anthony. So what you need to do is give us the schematics for the arc reactor, and tell us how to create your new element – what was it called? Yinsinium wasn’t it? Give us all of that and we’ll let you build your own reactor. One that won’t slowly poison you.’
‘It was pretty awesome how Harry put him in his place at dinner though,’ MJ scoffs, ‘I’ve never seen him turn such a bright shade of red before.’
‘Apologies. One of my babysitters decided to check we were behaving ourselves,’ he taps his forehead.
‘Yeah, man I do remember the amount of controversy about that, even though I was so young when it happened. It followed her for a long time, even after he died of cancer. That’s how I learned why no one messed with Peggy Carter,’ Tony laughs, ‘they’d taken me out somewhere for the day, I think we were just walking around a park with some ice cream and someone came over and basically told her off for having a black man as a husband.’
Thank you for everyone who is reading, and for those of you wonderful readers who have left comments. I'll be responding today I promise.
‘We need to get to the rest of the team now,’ he says. ‘FRIDAY I want a Quinjet ready to go by the time we get to the facility. Guys? Car. Now!’
A/N: Hi everyone. Thank you so much to everyone who is sticking with this story, and especially those of you who have left kudos and comments. I hope you're all still enjoying it.
Not when Peter himself basically had it committed to memory. Well it was the first time Mr Stark had texted him rather than passing a message through Happy:
‘You threatened to maim high schoolers,’ Tony points out, ‘I dread to think what you’d do to a mercenary given half the chance.’
Vision nods in understanding. ‘Have you told anyone else about this? Have you spoken with Tony whilst you were training before?’
Tony watches the man leave, unable to get rid of the smile on his face; when the blond is finally out of sight he sighs and turns around. ‘Place the call, FRIDAY, its way past time I spoke to the old man again.’
He can’t quite place the emotion behind the words, but it makes him turn and sit down on the edge of the building with a sigh. Deadpool doesn’t move closer as he explains, keeping as much identifiable information out as possible. ‘People died because I didn’t have my
Tony crosses his arms. ‘Yeah, wouldn’t suggest it Ross. See as long as he hasn’t touched American soil, he’s still under Wakandan jurisdiction. You really want to start a fight with King T’Challa? Actually, please be my guest, I’ll reserve front row seats. Screw it I’ll get them for the whole team.’
Steve briefly wonders which was more obvious: Tony’s actions or his reaction to them. ‘Why?’ he asks, instead of voicing his other question.
‘The only thing I hate about these damn things,’ Quill’s muffled voice comes from inside his where he’s gotten stuck, ‘is getting them on!’
‘Make a wish, Pete,’ Sam says. He does as he’s told, closing his eyes and blowing out all of his candles. There’s a chorus of cheers and Sam hands him a knife to cut the cake with. ‘Though I’m not sure I should trust you with this if Nat’s been training you.’
‘Thor we are not doing a hunt and that is final!’ Loki shouts over his shoulder as he walks over to the teenager. ‘Take it off the heat but make sure you keep stirring otherwise it’ll go solid.’
Bucky gives Hammer a blow to the back of the head with his metal fist and the man goes limp, the soldier slinging him over his shoulder and turning towards the exit. ‘I’ll come back as soon as this trash is in the Quinjet. Scott you alright to stay there with Steve and help defend it until we get back?’
‘Mr Stark! Mr Stark do you feel that this may be some form of karma for all the people that were killed with your weapons from your time-’
‘He’s only tried basic flavours so far,’ Peter explains, voice half muffled from where he’s still buried his face in his arms.
Natasha enters the common area the next morning, the tablet in her hand causing the worried frown on her face. She sighs with relief when she sees Tony and Steve sat at the breakfast bar with Vision, Peter’s sat in one of the chairs reading a book for school. There’s still popcorn littering the floor where they’d sat watching the two films last night. They’d only been saved watching the third by the fact that both Peter and Wanda had fallen asleep and had been carried to their rooms by Steve and Vision.
‘How much longer?’ Deadpool hisses in his ear. Peter jumps, not realising the merc had gotten that close. Why does his spidey sense decide to take a holiday around the man?
Tony places the box on a table and sits down, running a hand along his face. If Steve was a betting man he’d say the inventor looks as if he’s about to cry.
‘That makes more sense,’ Nebula says, thanking Natasha as she stands up. The red head pulls the other woman to her feet and helps guide her over towards the entrance of the rink.
Wanda frowns and concentrates. Relief washes over her face and she sags against the bars. ‘Yes,’ she breathes, ‘yes I can.’
‘I’ve offered help where I can,’ Strange interrupts, ‘but I am afraid I am not as useful in that field as I once was.’
‘I wish you could come with me,’ he says more to himself as they open their lockers. He looks over to see his friend’s eyes bugging out of his head, his mouth open.
Peter starts to open up about what happened when he faced Beck; Shuri finds a lead; and an old enemy rears his head.
‘Seems to be the tradition now,’ she responds, ‘and Clint always joins us the day after so it means I still get to see the family.’
Just as Tony thinks they’ve won, it manages to lurch forwards, pulling both Steve and Peter off their feet, it swings behind itself, catching Steve and sending him flying across the park.
‘Hello?’ he calls out, hearing his echo carry. ‘Doctor Strange?’ There’s no reply. After a minute or so he sighs. ‘Alright well in that case I’ll just see if I can find him. I mean he does
Sharon’s smile of greeting turned into a frown. ‘Unfortunately not a general social call. I’m here to see him,’ she gestures at Tony.
Do let me know what you think. Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos! I will make sure I get round to finishing all my replies to comments this weekend. Sorry my weeks are just super full at the moment so weekends are about the only chance I get to respond.
‘I mean,’ Wade shrugs, ‘needs a shit ton of cleaning. Not to mention more than one coat of paint. But it
He’d asked Doctor Strange if Wade would come back. ‘That’s up to him, Peter,’ had been his reply. As cryptic an answer as Peter had ever received, but it had given him a little more hope.
The sound that reverberates through every person on the battlefield is nothing like the thundering rumble that accompanies the Bifrost that had been heard just now. Loki looks up and feels every drop of warmth drain from his body despite the blistering African sun.
he shoots back, with Loki relaying the message. The whole team laughs and a little more of the tension leaves everyone.
Tony takes on some reports. Peter let's Deadpool help out on a patrol, but things don't go according to plan.
‘We target the rest of your team,’ Hammer explains. ‘One by one. Perhaps starting with your dear little intern, Peter. Or should I say,’ his eyes sparkle dangerously, ‘now what was it you called him? Your “kid” I believe it was when we went to the school. How long do you think he’d last with everything we’ve done to you? He is young so he may be able to withstand more. Maybe we should go a little harder on him at first-’
‘You know I said earlier we need to do this more often? Can we skip the alien invasions next time? Because I feel that we tend to do a lot of alien invasions when we’re in New York and we really need to broaden our dating activities.’
Peter starts shaking his head and then pauses, and the look he gives Wade has him slightly concerned. ‘How about a deal?’
Peter just laughs and releases Tony, then heads towards the elevators, leaving the older man with a matching grin on his face at the other end of the corridor.
Bucky laughs. ‘Well Iron Man has this thing about looking for secret entrances ever since he found one back when the team were working against HYDRA just after the first Battle for New York. If he’s on the comms when any other team is out, he’ll get people to check.’
‘Oh for the love of….just walk and move like you would normally. You won’t be flying so we’ll leave that lesson for another day.’
‘And if we let the two of you go to the one here,’ Ororo interrupts carrying some drinks for the three of them, ‘then we won’t see either of you for the rest of the
‘I suppose that is why she’s foremost in my mind at the moment. That and I am not used to…’ he sighs again. ‘I am still not used to this dynamic with the team.’
For six months Tony has worked non-stop on getting the Accords changed into something that he hoped Steve and the others could live with. Or at least come back and help him change more. He’d argued, he’d bargained, he’d
Bucky looks up as the structure, weakened by the earlier fire, starts to crumble above him, beams sturdy enough to hold up the room start to buckle. If he keeps going he’ll be able to reach Wade and hopefully push the merc towards an exit and get him off his fixation for finishing off Francis and focus on getting out. But he’s not sure they’ve both got time to get out.
It was Friday. They had one week before their deadline was up but since they watched Bucky’s memory of killing his parents they hadn’t made any progress. Vision said it was as if Bucky’s brain was fighting back against them. They couldn’t get further than the third trigger word before his body would start reacting and he’d lash out. Tony had a black eye and split lip to prove it. He’d just got back from one of Ross’ summons and had had a lot of fun trying to convince the council his injuries were due to an accident during training with one of the bots going a bit haywire.
Peter opens his mouth to say something, but the sound of a robbery below them distracts both of them from the conversation.
Stark laughs. ‘Nah, he’s not really. He managed to plan a way to get to speak to someone to help you, I’d just say he’s not all that up to date on celebrity culture. Which, as I said, I’m really not complaining about.’
‘Judging by that reaction? Probably. At least partly anyway. So let me guess: he had you talking shop right?’
‘As do I,’ she nods. ‘Nakia told me of the fight with your cousin. I am sorry for the pain it must have caused you, to have someone who should have been family turn against you.’
doing really well at a new ballet move and then you walked in and ruined it by distracting me,’ she huffs, letting Natasha pull her to her feet.
Pepper’s face hardens again and she nods. ‘Fine, but he’s still not getting access to any of his projects. I’ve given the medical team instructions that he’s not to be allowed any of his gadgets. I’ll see you tomorrow.’ She leaves without another word.
A/N: Come on guys! Did you really think I was going to kill Tony?? Also: I definitely got guilt tripped into posting this early because apparently I've upset people too much.
‘Besides surely it’s better he starts trying drink when he’s with people he can trust rather than kids his own age that are just going to try and get him drunk,’ Bucky counters.
He laughs then groans. ‘Yeah, alright you got me there.’ He manages to shuffle closer to her so he can take hold of her hand properly. ‘Have they done anything to you?’
,’ Bucky cuts off Steve, pointing a metal finger in Peter’s face, ‘you were supposed to tell us if that little shit continued?’ Then he turns to Harry. ‘By the way you are my new favourite person.’
It’s not a long break at all. Basically I’m thinking of doing one short multi-chapter story separate from this, or a couple of one shots, and then coming back and finishing the next instalment, so please don’t panic about this not being finished. I really am enjoying this series and have so many ideas I'm looking forwards to seeing your reactions to there is no way I'm abandoning it.
‘He, Nat and Rhodey had a shooting competition earlier,’ Wanda sighs, ‘and the prize was the winner got their next turn at cooking done by the losers.’
Tony stands, for what he hopes is the last time, on an increasingly familiar stretch of tarmac; Wanda and Vision are standing next to him, and Happy is back at the car. He’s decided to treat them with the limo; it rarely gets taken out and it’s got space for the largest number of people. He doesn’t even attempt to stop his fidgeting as the plane comes into sight, and does his best to ignore Wanda’s smirk.
trust him, either.’ He runs a hand over the back of his head, pulling a face. ‘I’m not making much sense am I?’
‘Unless it’s offering your backside as a place to store my shoes you can forget it,’ Natasha spits at him.
Tony just laughs in response as Natasha makes her way over to them. ‘Here you go, Tony, here’s your present,’ she smiles at him. They’d decided that each person would receive one of their presents at Yule and the rest at Christmas, similar apparently to something called a Secret Santa which seemed to make sense to the rest of the team but still left Loki a bit clueless.
Strange’s Cloak slips from his shoulders and goes to explore the room, it seems particularly fond of Peter and tries to help the teenager by pointing at different contents of the table.
And at that moment, he looks at Tony. The inventor is looking at him with a defeated look on his face, as if he knows what Steve is going to choose. As if he knows that Steve is going to leave.
‘One of them is Hulk?’ Tony offers as a finish to his AI’s sentence. ‘Shit, we need to get Hulk contained and I don’t have Veronica.’
‘Yeah,’ Wade’s voice is more subdued this time, ‘they’ve been more successful this time. HYDRA’s going to have their own army of mutants.’
Together he and Natasha push against the shield, freeing themselves from their shelter and scramble out. Natasha definitely more graceful than him.
‘Wanna go kick some bad guy ass?’ Deadpool grins as he lowers his mask. ‘We may need to restock on tacos by the time we’re done.’
‘Excuse me?’ Bucky demands. ‘How is the mind controlling maniac going to be of any use with healing?’
‘It looks like the one my grandfather got us the last Christmas I was here,’ Quill’s tone is a little wistful.
A/N: Hi everyone. Sorry I'm a little late updating this week. I'm going to try and update every Friday, but if you don't see a post it'll definitely be here by Saturday.
‘Stark, move out of the way,’ the Secretary orders. ‘We are here to arrest Steven Rogers on charges of treason. The rest of your little team is free to go.’
is a key factor in keeping that team together. Tell our friend he has to find a way to break that boy’s trust in the team and bring him to us, or he’s to find a way to take him out. I don’t care who or what he has to sacrifice to do it, I’ll make it worth it.’
‘Deadpool shut it down,’ she explains. ‘Seems he managed to escape and then took it upon himself to shut it down. Very permanently.’
I can see Widow making her way along the side of the truck. She’s only got one driver to take out but it’d make too much noise. I’m being too quiet.
‘Oh now we need more information,’ Sam says, putting his cutlery down, and Steve gives him and Bucky his best ‘Captain America’ stare, but it doesn’t faze them one bit. ‘Is she cute? Is there just one? It’s not a crazy cat lady is it?’
When they pull apart Bucky looks thoughtful. ‘Yeah,’ he nods slowly, ‘maybe I’ll try. Anyway,’ he gives himself a visible shake, ‘I better see what those two drama queens are up to.’
Bucky nods. ‘Yeah the guy’s a nutcase. I was put up against him a couple of times in my later missions; bastard made me muck up quite a few as well. He’s a damn good fighter, though he never shuts up.’
‘We’re on it, Tony,’ Wanda nods, and then starts to usher the gathered people behind Thor to follow Vision; the group goes fairly easily when Thor reassures them they are safe.
‘Ajax,’ Francis frowns. ‘The name is Ajax, little spider.’ Peter grinds his teeth at the nickname but says nothing. ‘And I want to make one little stipulation of my own.’
‘Hence why he got in touch with me,’ Nick continues, ‘and we started putting our heads together to try and find a better solution.’
‘Because that is exactly how you’d get Ben to give you an extra bag of candy,’ May shakes her head, exasperated. ‘I think I need to speak to Tony about how to handle you.’
‘No,’ comes the firm reply, one hand turning him to face him, ‘because I promised you before that you are not alone. I broke it once and I won’t break it again.’
The people Bucky passes stop talking when they realise who is walking down the steps of the auditorium, and Steve has to keep in his laughter at Peter’s face when he catches sight of the man walking towards him. Steve is still a few steps up when Bucky reaches the teenager and pulls him into a hug, obviously shocking a lot of people in the auditorium. After a couple of seconds the teenager returns it.
Natasha manages to do as she’s instructed, praying as she does to a god she doesn’t believe in that she’s not making any of his injuries worse. The Wakandan materialises back at her side and hands her a gun.
. Do you want to eat tonight or tomorrow? I know for a fact your super-soldier stomach is going to start protesting if we don’t get this finished within the hour.’
‘There’s a bottle in my bag over by the door,’ he gestures with his head which leaves him spinning around in a circle, ‘dammit. There’s a bottle in my bag that has the label ‘anti-web’ on it. Can you get it out for me? If we put it on the webs holding me I should be able to get out and then sort out all the err…’
Natasha sighs. ‘Sam it’s barely been half an hour, and we’ve been busy getting things sorted in that time. Please don’t be difficult.’
The rest of dinner passes without incident. Peter’s quite surprised to find Rhodes is making an effort to get to know Wade, Tony pulls him aside later and explains.
‘Well that was…intense,’ Ned says, putting down his next completed model and picking up the next one Peter should be working on. Peter just nods. ‘Hey, Pete? What is he like? The Winter Soldier I mean.’
‘Nice to meet you, Tony,’ Steve smiles, shaking the offered hand. There’s callouses on the palm and fingers which proves his story of being one of the main people on the projects. This wasn’t one of the pampered rich boys who usually came to Stark’s parties, this man was a worker.
‘Drax! What was that for?’ Peter demands as Drax empties a bowl of flour over his head. ‘Now I look like a ghost,’ he sneezes.
‘Please can we not talk about explosions in the lab where I can hear?’ Steve begs. ‘I need to sleep at night.’
‘Actually, Rhodey it’s your War Machine suit,’ Clint tells him. ‘You think I can get it programmed to move shit?’
‘Of course I am, May,’ he says as he says goodbye to Ned and walks to his room, only half listening to what his aunt’s saying. ‘Spider-Man gets grounded for not doing his homework,’ he mutters to himself as he gets out his suit. ‘If that ever happens Sergeant Barnes is never finding out. I’ll never hear the end of it.’
technological geniuses of our time and you still need me to do the computer stuff?’ she teases through the comms.
Rhodes laughs. ‘Mama I promise we’ll be fine. We’re not looking after ourselves anyway the rest of the team is here, plus Laura and Clint are coming for Christmas so she’s going to be in charge of the kitchen.’
‘The park,’ he replies, firing up the suit and sending some distracting shots towards the alien. ‘Come on big guy, let’s go sightseeing.’ Now that he’s got its attention it comes lumbering towards him, reminding him very much of how Hulk used to be before they convinced him working with the team was a good idea. ‘Yikes,’ he says, as the alien grabs the ankle of his boot and throws him into the side of a tree, thankfully they’ve managed to reach the park where it’ll be easier for civilians to get out of the way.
protect him. And the fact that you hold back from using your abilities against people that you could end up seriously hurting, even with all the reasons they give you for doing it? That speaks volumes about you, kid, it really does.’
look after himself; not to mention he’s got a good enough relationship with several members of the team, and his aunt and Happy, that I’m sure he’ll let
Peter knows he’s taken the man by surprise. After a few moments he bursts out laughing. ‘Oh this is fantastic!’ he crows. ‘Sure, Spider-Man, I’ll take your deal. If only because you’ll help me get someone else I want. If I have you, Wade Wilson won’t be far behind.’
‘Why would they have guards when most of the test subjects end up not being able to move?’ Wade adds. Natasha is glad Bucky doesn’t have an answer any more than she does.
to talk to him. Which he knows is ridiculous, but there’s a small voice in the back of his mind telling him that Tony should be including him in more of the conversations.
Just then there’s what sounds suspiciously like an explosion and the sound of lots of people shouting and hurrying past his cell.
Another roar gives him his answer for where the second person is: behind a chunk of fallen building.
‘Oh, right, sorry, yeah. Um… well…. can I come up here three weekends a month rather than just two?’ he turns those big brown puppy eyes on Tony.
‘In very basic terms I suppose you could say that,’ Tony says, sliding across the floor on his stools. ‘It will allow you to relive memories but you will still be in control as to when the memory stops and which memory you choose. Reliving it in this way allows you to see and process everything while Wanda and Vision see if they can help speed up the healing process.’
‘Well?’ Sam asks, throwing a black sweater towards her, which she soon realises has a red spider wearing reindeer antlers knitted across the front.
Loki grins. ‘No I actually enjoyed that part, just don’t tell Thor or he’ll renege on our deal. Though I suppose part of that enjoyment came from spending time with people away from the Warriors with no risk of Thor feeling I was avoiding him. No it was celebrations like the hunt that I didn’t enjoy but Thor would insist I had to join in. I much preferred spending time with Mother preparing the entertainment because we could work together using our magic to create more and more elaborate creations each year.’
As one the Jotuns send their ice powers forwards, creating a wall of thick ice that spreads out in front of the machines; Bucky can see shimmering light through the wall and knows Loki must be enhancing it with his Asgardian magic. When the machines hit the ice the shockwave can be seen in the strain of the Jotun warriors.
‘What do you ‘not from here’?’ Rhodey asks. ‘Like not from America or not from Earth or something else?’
‘Is the child’s relationship still the main topic of conversation?’ he rolls his eyes as he heads towards the fridge.
‘Don’t even go there,’ he huffs, then feels bad at taking out his frustration on yet another person who doesn’t deserve it. ‘Sorry Happy, just been a rough first day back.’
‘We should return to the facility before- ahh!’ Vision cuts himself off with a pained shout as he falls to the floor, the tip of a spear showing through his stomach and being pulled back, as he falls down another alien shape can be seen behind him.
‘Oh come on now we need more information,’ Sam says, putting his cutlery down, and Steve gives him and Bucky his best ‘Captain America’ stare, but it doesn’t faze them one bit. ‘Is she cute? Is there just one? It’s not a crazy cat lady is it?’
‘Lila what did we say about asking those questions?’ Laura chastises her daughter, then looks apologetically at the teenager. ‘I’m sorry.’
‘Well I’m glad you listen to one of us when we protest at least. You shall have to stay very close, Winter, to protect me.’ The puppy yelps in agreement causing everyone to laugh.
Loki puts a hand to his head and groans. ‘Perhaps I was not as recovered as I believed,’ he admits, ‘but they will have reached their destination. It just took a little more out of me than I anticipated.’
Right sorry everyone. Wade is taking a break because he obviously can’t be trusted to deliver a message.
‘I mean,’ Bucky says once the two men have left, ‘that was a proper Tony scowl you had going on then kid.’
‘I definitely don’t doubt your ego,’ she rolls her eyes. ‘When you said they could be activated remotely you failed to mention they could be
‘You talking about the same thing I am? Because I’m talking about a tree and I seriously hope you don’t look at trees that way.’
‘It’s fine, Steve, I promise,’ he replies. They continue to demonstrate different obstacles, and each time Steve realises how much Peter has to hold back he can tell the soldier’s frustration is building. He’s just not sure if it’s more with him or the situation.
‘Hey I am perfect thank you very much,’ Tony says, fiddling with some of the many screens that littered his workshop and refusing to meet anyone’s eye.
‘You and me both. But Steve when Nat and I were talking to Peter… it scared me how much he feels for Wade. I don’t think
Steve opens his mouth to reply then frowns and closes it, before saying quietly. ‘So did I.’ They look at each other in surprise for a couple of moments. ‘How long has it been since you slept through?’
‘I hate you,’ Steve groans, burying his head in his hands again and trying to block out Bucky’s sniggers. Though he doesn’t try that hard. It’s good to hear him laughing again.
‘You and me,’ Wade grins at Harry, ‘are going to find some time to exchange embarrassing Peter stories.’
They’re quiet for a little longer, taking comfort in each other’s warmth; Tony is still trying to process that this is real, that Steve actually wants him. Part of him, that sounds suspiciously like his father, is telling him it’s too good to last. ‘Steve?’
‘Ah Miss Romanov I was hoping to speak to you,’ Justin Hammer’s smirking face has Natasha’s blood boiling, then she notices the other people on the video call and it runs cold.
She looks over her shoulder as Sam and Quill come over, her hands up as she finishes stringing the lights on the large tree they’d already set up. ‘No thanks, Sam, we’re good. We’re going to start on the ornaments soon so you might want to fetch your wings, and don’t let Pete convince you to take him up on his webs: Tony’s forbidden him from decorating the tall one saying he doesn’t want any broken trees or bones in the run up to Christmas.’
‘Merry Christmas,’ she replies, then holds his face so she can look at him properly. ‘You’re carrying a lot of worries, young man, I suggest you find a way to lose some of them. You don’t need to be carrying so much at such a young age.’
He’s pulled out of his thoughts by the sound of his name being spoken through the door he’s stood outside.
‘When I started listening to you,’ she responds, then releases him as the rest of the team join him and they head towards the courtroom.
he behaves himself then you may invite him to Christmas. Is everyone content with this?’ There’s a chorus of agreements. ‘Are you happy, Spiderling?’
‘I can think of some other ways you could keep me quiet. Or at least preoccupied,’ he says, raising a suggestive eyebrow.
‘Thank you.’ Loki turns back to the Jotuns. ‘We also need to inform you of the impending threat of the Titan Thanos. Jotunheim may need to go to war in a matter of weeks, or the universe could fall.’
‘I’m just hoping we get acknowledged by the team when we arrive, then we get to be as cool as you will be for this entire trip,’ is Ned’s response.
Thor and Valkyrie have been demurring to Loki’s obviously superior knowledge in the case of Yule preparations, and the trickster has been in charge of organising everything which has meant he’s using his ability to be in two places at once, if not as a solid shape, to his full advantage. Peter, Wanda and Vision can tell when it’s one of Loki’s illusions, rather than him, and Thor can as long as he has something to hand to throw at Loki’s face. Sam also suspects Bucky can tell, but the man is more stubborn than Steve and Peter combined when he wants to keep something to himself.
‘Didn’t think I still deserved to do it without checking,’ he replies, and is relieved Tony doesn’t ask as he reaches to turn the water off before helping him stand up again, and helping him out of his underwear before getting him into the tub.
Tony’s caught somewhere between laughing and crying at the whole situation; so he just looks between the two super-soldiers with his mouth opening and closing as he tries to find the words to express his thoughts. ‘I’m not sure whether to be more pissed at the fact we have to get that thing home, or impressed that you actually managed to lift it one handed,’ he settles for.
‘Strangely enough turning half of the last team into war criminals doesn’t really help with a recruitment drive.’ Tony presses on before anyone can interrupt him again. ‘The fact is the majority of people with enhanced abilities on this planet who are willing to do something to help others are either already at our base, or they’ve been sent into exile. If we’re lucky things will continue as they have for the past six months where none of us bothers the others. If we’re not someone finds some leverage on one or more of them and I don’t particularly fancy going toe-to-toe with any of them again. If we bring them back we’re all in the same place, and the likelihood of someone finding a way to pit us against each other is smaller.’
“Well… Then… I… I don’t like it! So quit it already!” Tony stuttered, clearly shocked by the other man’s straightforward answer.
Steve had been very nervous imagining what would happen once Tony woke up and saw Clint there. His heart melted when Tony appeared in the hallway, rubbing his eyes with one hand and holding his teddy bear with the other; but then a feeling of dread sank into his stomach when he saw Tony’s expression. Getting mad, yelling at him, refusing to continue age playing, kicking Clint out, those were some of the many things Steve had imagined happening, so it had been a kind of relief when Tony just panicked and clung to him.
“Well, technically, I’m older than you,” Steve observed, and he internally hesitated whether to say or not what he uttered next. “I’m old enough to be your daddy,” he joked, making sure the last word didn’t sound like an innuendo or anything like that. He paid close attention to Tony’s reaction to it.
As a reward for continuing being such a brave boy, Steve offered to read him a story, suggestion that was more than well-received. The fact that it was just an excuse to put Tony down for a nap didn’t need to be informed, nor did the idea of taking advantage of the situation to present Tony with an opportunity of making another choice: whether to drink from a bottle while he listened to Daddy or not. After some squirming and blushing, his baby decided for the former, and he even admitted he liked it when the bottle was held for him – something that turned out to be quite difficult while holding a baby in his arms and the book he was reading, but Steve managed.
“It’s a deal then,” Steve declared, gathering him into a tighter hug this time. “You don’t have to worry about anything, baby. Let daddy take care of everything.”
Steve walked as slowly as he could so he wouldn’t disturb his little boy’s trip to dreamland. They went straight to the captain’s floor, which, thankfully, was directly below Tony’s. He might as well have stayed at Tony’s, but there were no longer any of the supplies necessary to put him down to bed sleep on Tony’s floor. Everything was kept in that nursery, and now it was completely wrecked.
Steve had promised to stop this when Tony wasn’t comfortable anymore, and Tony was going to make him be true of his word.
If honesty was something Tony deserved, being tricked or manipulated was something he certainly did not deserved. And Steve was afraid he may have been doing that.
“Me? Do you want daddy to help you out of that icky diaper?” Steve inquired, biting back the smile that wanted to form. Tony nodded shyly, a strong flush creeping up his face. Cute. “Okay honey, I have no problem with that, quite the opposite actually, I like to make sure my baby doesn’t get a rash,” he complied. “Can daddy place you on the changing table?” he asked, getting another shy nod for answer.
“You'd better be wearing clothes when I take off the bandana,” Tony warned as Steve pushed him down the hallway, "well, no, now that I think about it, I hope you're not."
“I’m OK, relax,” Tony replied a bit grumpily. He appreciated Steve’s concern, though it sometimes was a little annoying too. Tony might not be as strong as Steve, but he wasn’t a weakling either.
But of course, there was a day when Tony couldn’t bring himself to ask JARVIS to turn the screen off. Or rather, a night. Steve hadn’t been in their bedroom when Tony had gone there well into the night, which made him wonder where Steve could be, since it was incredibly rare he went late to bed when not being in a mission. Tony thought about not making too much of a fuss about it and go straight to bed, and he would have done that, if his brain hadn’t reminded him about the possibility of Steve being with Clint.
One of the other things that had refrained Steve from bring up the topic with Tony was that he didn’t want him to do it just because he had asked. Steve wanted Tony to want it too, to like it. To really enjoy it. To help him cope with things like it had helped Clint.
“Party pooper,” Tony complained. “Seriously Cap, couldn't you wait until I finish? Everything that doesn't involve nudity can wait.”
Phil pursed his lips as he refrained himself from commenting further. Tony seemed to be mad at him, and Phil got the feeling that it would be worse if he tried to do something about it. Sighing slightly, Phil focused his attention on Clint once more, or that was what he had intended to do before catching a last glimpse of Tony’s face. His cheeks were flushed and he looked kind of pale. That could certainly be caused by how much Tony had been crying. However, Phil instinctively reached out to touch a hand to Tony’s forehead, and he furrowed his eyebrows in concern when he sensed how overly warmed Tony felt.
“Don’t worry kiddo, we’re almost done,” Phil informed to Tony as he helped Clint to put on a pull-up, ignoring the mope that appeared on Clint’s face when he realized how different that pull-up was from the ones he usually wore – though he knew better than to argued right after he had being scolded. Tony didn’t answer, he just kept sobbing uncontrollably while he turned his head away.
“Noted, Sir,” JARVIS confirmed, a blatant tone of disapproval in his voice that Tony preferred to ignore.
This situation had gone downhill further than Steve had expected, and the worse part was that, now that he thought about it, there was no one to blame but themselves, all this had happened due to their lack of communication skills. Having given Tony some space and time to reflect and organize his thoughts hadn’t been bad, but now Steve knew he should’ve been a bit more persistent. It wasn’t like he’d force Tony to do anything against his will, but Steve could’ve insisted on finding out what had led Tony to decide quitting age playing, especially when he’d really seemed to enjoy it.
“I said I’m staying with you,” Steve said with determination. Tony snuggled closer to him, feeling secretly grateful. “And when you wake up, we’re going to talk about why you didn’t want to tell daddy you were feeling little,” he scolded, though there was no heat in his voice. Tony furrowed his brow in confusion.
“Shhh, remember we have a deal, sweetie pie,” Steve reminded, earning a huge moue. “Besides, it’s not anything difficult. The only thing Daddy wants you to do is to go and touch three things in this room that you do want to keep,” he informed.
“C’mon,” Steve encouraged as he gently pushed his baby away and gave his diapered bottom a couple of pats.
The Avengers had had a stressful week. They had assembled three times, and even if the battles hadn’t been that hard, they had been the type of engagements where the people they had been fighting got under your skin and onto your nerves. In addition to that, Tony had had to deal with some complicated issues with his company, problems that apparently Ms. Potts hadn’t been able to deal by herself as she usually did. And on the top of all that, he had clearly been trying to avoid letting his Little side to come to the surface. He had not been very subtle about it, it was obvious he needed to slip into that headspace to cope with the stress.
‘Are you asking me if I’m intending to marry him instead of Captain America?’ Peter notices the tightness around Tony’s eyes that gives away the man is not happy. He’s become very good at reading his mentor’s moods so as not to annoy him. That’s a definite warning sign.
‘What happened?’ Steve puts a hand on his shoulder and Bucky tells him how the argument started, and then seemed to escalate beyond control.
‘Right I’m getting bored. You’re taking too long to tell me the evil plan. Let’s skip to the fun part: where I get to hear it between your screams of pain.’
‘One’s over in Central Park, taken out by Wanda, big hulking thing with a hammer to match,’ Steve tells him. ‘The other’s over there.’
‘Pepper’s way to get rid of me for a couple of minutes,’ Tony replies. ‘Basically people place a sealed bid and whoever has put in the highest amount wins a dance with the nominated unlucky bastard. Usually me.’
‘Yeah I’ve already had that talk from Mr Stark,’ Peter snaps, standing up and facing away. ‘I should go,’ he says, preparing his web shooters.
‘Apart from Wanda you mean?’ Sam’s voice is grim. ‘I think if they did they would have used them when they attacked us. In case Wanda wasn’t knocked out. They’d have been idiots to go into a magic fight and leave their own magic user at home.’
‘Do I want to know why you needed us at a Christmas tree seller?’ Tony asks, stepping out of the suit and letting it close up behind him. Rhodes stays in his, the suit giving his legs and back extra support.
Steve ducks as the seat next to him explodes in gunfire. A figure drops down next to him and he just manages to pull back his punch in time.
time you respect the law is the one time I don’t want you to. Or is it that you’re just using it as an excuse and you don’t actually want to sleep with me?’
‘Only if you plan on stabbing me in the back, which is no more than what you do to me on a fairly regular basis,’ he replies, leaning back in his chair.
him to go back. Damn stubborn kid. When we watched the others dusting he must have known what was going to happen to him because he…he was asking me to help him…he said he didn’t want to go and I…I couldn’t stop it, I couldn’t help him…and then,’ Tony’s breath catches, ‘he told
of them? I mean I get you haven’t really done polyamory outside of the bedroom, but why didn’t you think about giving it a go?’
‘So you see,’ Tony picks up the story again, ‘the prince and the princess live happy and safe in their home, protected by so many guardians that love them that no monster will ever be able to touch them.’
Maybe it’s because the other man doesn’t push it, maybe it’s because he’s held onto this secret for so long, but Tony feels his mouth open of its own accord. ‘At the end of the fight,’ he croaks out, ‘when they finally got me down Steve drove his shield into my chest plate and cracked the arc reactor. It… it went out.’
‘I will point out,’ Loki says from his spot on the sofa, ‘that you are wasting time arguing about the Spiderling’s affections when the being capable of destroying half of the universe is on his way here.’
So I found these last two chapters quite tricky, mainly because I was a tad worried about having Tony and Bucky bond a little too quickly. I get the impression, though, that the two of them are actually very similar in some ways, and in the ways that would make them good friends. Tony's whole spiel on blame I think is also something the two of them will struggle to come to terms with, and the two of them are really the only ones who can understand what the other is going through.
May puts up her hands and leaves, and Peter’s left with Ned’s calculating look. ‘This wouldn’t happen to be Deadpool would it?’
So without further delay (and before Wade decides to come back from his sulking) here’s the list of options:
He slows down trying to give himself more time to work out what they were picking up on. ‘Pete you alright?’ Ned asks him.
‘You will need to repair the hole in the wall, though,’ Steve points to where there’s a sizeable dent in the wall, his backpack laying on the floor underneath it.
‘You’re a good man, Barnes,’ Thor says, coming to stand next to him. ‘And I rather think that our friends will be glad to hear you haven’t won or bought any trees during your disappearance.’
‘Wanda that’s not fair!’ Steve says from behind him, but his complaints are lost to the shouts of celebration and congratulations from Sam and the two women as he crosses the finish line.
‘Thanks. I, um…do we have to go up now? I’m not sure I want to face everyone again just yet after that tantrum.’
Peter nods. ‘Daredevil gave me those addresses. Deadpool had done his own investigation and got all of the addresses except the Expo as potential places for HYDRA activity. He’s checking out some of them and getting back to me. Daredevil’s keeping tabs on things and will let me know if anything else comes up.’
‘Thankfully not that often,’ Bucky laughs, ‘it tends to be hidden compartments where people have stored information they don’t want us to find. Between all the different team members we tend to be able to find anything that someone has tried to hide.’
‘Get in line boys,’ Natasha says. ‘No one’s training Baby Spider till I’ve taught him how to kick your sorry asses.’ No one even tries to argue with her.
Steve looks from Loki’s shocked face to the four Jotun in the cave entrance, nudging Bucky over to their two friends.
‘You mean like you and Steve do?’ the teen cocks his head to one side as he takes in the new information. ‘I get worried about using my strength though,’ he admits, ‘all the people I face are usually normal humans and I don’t want to do any permanent damage.’
‘You going for the record of longest walk down stairs?’ he asks with his usual snark when the group finally reaches the tarmac. Ross had insisted on the armed guard, he hadn’t insisted Tony be nice to them, nor polite. ‘And what’s up with the metallic armbands?’
“That’s good to know,” Steve observed, “otherwise, I’d be always checking if you need a diaper change from now on,” he joked, and he moved a bit to the side to avoid being splashed, as Clint spat out the soda he had in his mouth.
And as usual, if you spot any mistakes or grammar incongruences, please let me know, I actually didn't read this chapter as many times as I usually do. n_n'''
Eventually, on those days when he got so tired of fighting back the desires of his Little side, he started to build himself a nursery. He was awesome at creating things with his hands, so carpentry was a piece of cake for him, really. It didn’t take him long to create everything he ever dreamed of having. A crib, a changing table, a rocking chair, a high-chair. Everything a nursery usually had. JARVIS had even helped him to get all the supplies needed. It was amazing how many things one could find on the internet. Adult-size diapers with very childish designs, pacifiers, and bottles with nipples big enough for adults. Even onesies big enough to fit him!
“I know sweetheart, I know you do,” Steve said, sounding a bit distressed, “and I’m sure your daddy will be here soon, but right now you’ll have to settle for uncle Steve.”
I hope you had enjoyed it, sorry for making you wait this long, though I won't promise I'll update soon, because, well, it might happen, it might not. I promise I'll try my best to write the next chapter asap.
Without further delay, Phil reached the bedroom, opened the door and entered. Tony turned his head towards the entrance instantly, and Phil witnessed how his expression changed from hopeful, to disappointed, to finally horrified. Before Phil could do anything to avoid it, Tony got off the bed and ran towards the closet, closing the doors behind him.
Phil couldn’t help feeling a bit stupid for not putting two and two together sooner; after all, he had seen Clint rushing through a room to get to the bathroom several times, just as Tony had done. By the time he had gotten up from the floor and gone into the bathroom, it had been too late. Even if Phil had found Tony struggling to unbutton his jeans, the wet spot on them that went from his crotch to all the way down his legs, as well as the relatively small puddle surrounding him, were an undisputable proof that he had already lost control of his bladder.
