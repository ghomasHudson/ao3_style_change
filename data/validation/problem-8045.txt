He's still sitting on Clint's bed hours later when Bucky enters the room without so much as a knock. He takes one good look at Steve's face and takes a seat across from the blond on what had been Wanda's bunk. She had always felt safer with Clint nearby.
Except he regrets his seating choice when he finds himself at eye level with Steve focusing on him with a heightened interest. Natasha reappears, and Steve stands momentarily so she can slide into the booth. At full height, Tony really feels like fate is playing one giant prank on him. Really? Does the guy
They're crouched, ready to fight whoever is coming at them. It shouldn't come as a surprise to them when an armored body flies into the building and lands on two feet, the same way it always does. It's almost a familiar armor, though instead of the red and gold that they're all used to, this armor is black with just the slightest traces of red.
"What's going on, Stark?" Natasha asks, and while she does as he asks and reclaims her seat behind Wanda, she looks wary. They all do, he decides.
"Oh god. There's two of them." Sam grits out, melodramatic and exasperated.
, Clint. You were supposed to enjoy the life you built up with your wife and kids. I didn't call you because that part of your life was supposed to be over with."
"Not a problem," he tells her, and he pretends not to notice the way her eyebrow twitches, "I'm not going."
"Don't do that to yourself." Bucky interupts with a stern shake of his head, and Tony looks up at him, surprised that
the way Steve's heartbeat picks up. Reluctantly, he peers up at Steve, and the look in Steve's eyes causes him to inhale sharply.
The name piques Tony's interest immediately, and he finds he isn't faking it when he reaches out and firmly shakes the outstretched hand, "I've read about you, Dr. Banner. I hear you nearly made Manhattan explode in a puff of green smoke. I'm a big fan, really."
"How many times have I told you to call me Sam, Thor?" The army man from earlier calls out from the other end of the table, and Tony's gaze shifts from him to Thor in amusement.
Tony just watches him walk away with his shoulders dropped.
"Tony. He wouldn't want you living here by yourself." Natasha's creeping closer almost unknowingly, her batons tucked away and her hands up in a placating gesture like Steve had chosen to go with earlier.
"So what do we do?" Clint demands, his eyes alight as he jumps up from the sofa in a bout of pure rage-fueled adrenaline.
He doesn't know how long he lays there, blankets drawn lazily over their naked forms; but he doesn't really mind, knowing their legs are tangled together underneath. Steve's growing erection is poking into his hip and causing blood to rush down to his own crotch; but that's also not something that presses into his mind. Not much, anyway.
"When I met Steve, he was a scrawny runt, getting into all kinds of trouble. He had a load of health problems and had a temper that was actually several times bigger than he was, physically." Both Bucky and Tony snort at the imagery the words provide, because not much has changed about Steve, if that's what they're going from, "We were best friends, growing up. We went to school together, hung out at his Ma's afterwards, taught younger kids how to hunt and protect themselves. Somewhere along the way, yeah, feelings developed, but we both knew it wouldn't last. I'm older than Steve by a year, so when I turned 18, I wouldn't have known if he were my mate or not; but even if we
"Please." Tony adds, and he's aware that he's pleading for it.
"We don't want him to rise to the bait, but he's been working on designing a weapon for him," Bruce concludes, and though they all see James's growing discomfort, he has the right to know all of this.
Steve rocks on his feet, and his expression is wide and pleading and so earnest it reminds Tony of a puppy. It's not fair that a man with such a burly physique can have the expression he's wearing right now and get away with it. He doesn't make any effort to move on his own, though, and that seems to be enough to frustrate Steve into pulling Tony along whether he wants to go or not. His fingers are intertwined with Tony's, and his hand is only slightly bigger yet seems to envelope his hand fully.
Just another day, except Rhodey was in their midst.
Tony brings it back down to the earth as Bucky and Natasha help wrangle Wanda back down. She's still flickering with rage but as long as they can stop her from going straight for Tony in his vulnerable state, they'll do what they have to.
"Couldn't you have stopped it?" Scott asks this time, sitting up just a little straighter and challenging him.
"Not a chance, sweetheart." Steve replies, and he doesn't seem bothered by the fact that the kitchen is bustling with activity when he carries Tony in.
"Bro, I call best man." Clint calls out, and both Bucky and Sam throw handfuls of berries at him for his gall.
The trio releases the breath they've been holding all together, and Clint and Natasha hurry into the portal before Tony can, possibly to tell the others that Tony's agreed to go along.
"You two have a lot to discuss so we should get going."
It was the least he could do for Tony Stark.
When he turns, Captain America's hand is literally denting a multi-million dollar metal suit like it's a toothpick, "Medical. Then debrief. Then you can go."
"Tony, I-" but while he's great with battle plans and throwing a shield around, he doesn't have the slightest clue on how to talk about his
"I got the particle accelerator running now. Just a few hours more and-" Tony begins, shrugging one shoulder as if he's not impressed with himself.
Stephen remains silent, his eyes passing Steve to where Bucky is sitting in a question he refuses to ask out loud. Steve can hear it plenty loud even without having it voiced.
"I love you, Tony."
He cups Steve's face in his hands, using his thumbs to dry the tears that are slowing but still sliding down his cheeks. Steve doesn't even fight it, and his own hands lift off of Tony's waist to instead splay his own fingers around Tony's.
"We decided to take a break before I left for Malibu." Tony tells her with a long sigh, and at times like this, he finds himself wondering why Pepper had removed the minibar from the office.
"If any of you are squeamish, now's the time to get up and walk away," Tony warns them, and he waits a beat to see if they'll listen. They don't. If anything, his words added to his behavior about the situation only convinces them to stay. Really, he might have just landed in the midst of the most stubborn pack in existence. He takes a deep breath, running his hand through his hair once more like he's trying to brace himself, "Alright. I don't know if any of you know my full story, but by the time I turned 20, I had four PhDs in varying engineering concentrations. I was young and arrogant, I'll say that now; and I had enough money to get away with basically anything.
"And why do-"
She turns to leave, even though there's no real way of leaving the sanctum without Stephen's assistance; and though Vision flashes Steve an apologetic grimace, he rises to leave with her.
It's only when the coffeemaker starts dripping that Steve seems to notice he's home. The blond is quieter than he should be, bulging muscles and all, and wraps his arms loosely around Tony's waist as he leans into the slighter. Tony's surprised by his strength, but Steve manages to keep him from planting face-first into the counter.
"You couldn't even call me and warn me?" Steve continues, and he stops just before Tony, reaching out and firmly planting a hand to the side of Tony's head.
Tony wants to laugh as much as he wants to cry. He's not too good with emotional vulnerability, as stated before; but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to spend more time with the alpha that fate had chosen to be his. Instead of answering, Tony lets his features soften into the most genuine smile he can manage with the inner turmoil he's facing and closes the distance between them. The kiss starts of chaste, just a brushing of their lips; but Steve reacts quickly, bringing a hand to the back of his head, fingers curled around his neck as he plunges forward in response.
"Is it worth it?" Tony asks,
Steve wants to say how unfair that is. He wants to defend Bucky, his best friend from childhood who he'd lost once before and regretted every day; but he also regretted letting go of Tony Stark once, too. Did he really have to make a choice between teammates and friends again?
Tony lifts a hand to cup the side of Steve's face, and he ignores the tremble of his fingers, "I'm here, honey. I'm here, and I'm safe. I'm with you."
Steve clears his throat, leaning past Tony to pick up the mug he'd discarded. He turns away, his focus on the sink as he washes it out, "Enlisted out of high school. Never had the time."
Tony and Clint look at each other one more time, nod like they're in perfect unison, and turn to jolt away from Steve as quickly as their feet can take them. Which turns out to be impossible, because Steve catches them by the collars of their shirts. He pulls them back roughly, but angle them away from his body to ensure that they're the only ones who are caught by the force. There's a loud thumping sound when their heads knock against one another; and whines follow from both of them.
"I'm fine, Steve." He sighs, raising a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. He has to count in his head to keep himself from instigating an apartment.
With his anxiety bubbling in his chest, and adrenaline coursing through him, Tony spins on his heels and runs to the garage. He's not sure if they're planning to go back out or not, but it really would suck if his plans to get out unnoticed were to be thwarted.
"James Rhodes is the difference." Natasha concludes, and her gaze flickers to Sam for the shortest of moments. So does Steve’s. It's not hard to come to that conclusion.
"I have some work to do in the garage." Tony tells them, lifting his shoulders in an effort to stretch them out. Both Steve and Natasha turn in his direction, but he turns around and heads towards the side of the house, "Really. Go shower, take up a room for the night. See you tomorrow, maybe."
Surprised, Tony jerks back in his seat, and Steve's own eyes fly open again. Tony swallows a heavy lump, his eyes darting past Steve like he's being trapped, "Are you sure I'm welcome? It's your pack and I don't want to intru-"
Nodding, both Tony and clint roll away from each other to opposite sides of the threshold; and when Steve gets close enough, both of them kick their feet out. Steve stumbles as his feet catch onto their ankles but remains steady; and then all that rage is back as he turns his head back in their direction.
Yeah, the original plan was just to stay for a night, but was it really appropriate of him to ask them to continue trailing after him like they had been? They've been following him for years, after all, and in two small cars. One night wasn't nearly enough time for them to stretch their legs out, was it?
“But, Tony Stark is needed to save the universe.” Stephen concludes, and he turns his gaze to Wanda as if daring her to contradict him, “Any one of you can be replaced, at the end of the day; but there will be no universe left standing if Tony Stark isn’t on our side.”
Tony stares for a moment longer, then sighs. He knows this is a bad idea. Now that they've got a taste of each other, their fate has been sealed. He knows this. Steve knows this. Maybe Steve planned it. But Tony went along with it even though he know.
"Oh, Tony." Pepper says with a sigh, and while her voice is usually so soft and unassuming, everyone else is so quiet she's practically shouting. She turns to the rest of the pack, her shoulders slumped like she's got the whole world balanced on top of them, "We'll need a game plan. Someone to stay with Tony. The rest of you will come with us to the wake. There are stylists up-"
Hearing his voice causes a reaction that Tony hadn't realized he was waiting for. The little bots he'd made at various times of his life whir and chirp as they come over to inspect the group. It's a solemn kind of reason for them to be visiting; and yet, he feels so at peace within arm's reach of his bots.
He wants the touch, just doesn't want to ask for it in case Tony is uncomfortable giving it. While Tony isn't a virgin in any sense of the word, a nervous giddiness fills him at the idea of pleasuring Steve. He trails his hand up to Steve's crotch, palming the erection that presses against Steve's black sweatpants. The muscle twitches under his grip, and then Steve's hand reaches out to still him.
"He must've really loved the guy, huh?" Bucky muses, mostly to himself. He wouldn't know much about Tony's past with the Air Force colonel, and that wasn't anything they could fault him for.
“You say he’s the only one who can stop that mad Titan who is coming for us,” Wanda continues, and her face is scrunched up in frustration as she waves a hand to gesture wildly over the team, “but we have a whole team here, and we have the whole of Wakanda, Thor, and the Hulk. Why do we need a man whose only interest in the past was to tie us down and turn us into slaves? We can save the Earth without him!”
"So it really happened." It's a statement and a question all at once, and Tony doesn't hold himself back when his fingers itch to just reach out and touch the man's bulging bicep. It's as firm as it looks, and Tony clears his throat as he forces himself to take a step back. Married or not, that probably wasn't appropriate.
Once or twice throughout the drive, he or Steve would try to strike up a conversation; but in all truth, nothing was set in stone until they figured out what to do about Obadiah's alleged treachery. Steve would go talk to the others whenever they stopped for gas, and even managed to convince Tony to stop for coffee. It was the middle of the day and they didn't really need it, but the moment Steve used those puppy eyes on him, he had no choice.
Tony licks his lips as the blond draws closer, and he knows Steve is following the movement with his eyes. Steve ducks his head, lips parting so that he can take Tony's tongue into his mouth and suck on it with slow and teasing strokes of his tongue. Tony moans at the action and feels his back arching just slightly, if only to get more of Steve's body on him. One of Steve's arms winds down around his waist, holding him steady and crushing their bodies together, and he grinds against Tony in a way that makes his heart skip several beats.
One of the little bots rolls up to Natasha, having recognized her from years passed. She laughs a little bit as she bends over and presses her palm onto the trop of his head, "Hi, Dum-E. I told you I'd come back."
"Talk to me," he says again; and this is much more like a plea as his hand shifts to the side of Tony's head, grip gentle yet firm.
"Where are we going?" Natasha asks, but a glance in her direction tells him she knows exactly where they're going.
"I was really looking forward to them pancakes, too," Sam grumbles, and his wings are folded on his back but ready to unfurl in case he's needed again. Even now, Steve finds himself more than glad to have his newer friend join their team.
"Alternate realities?" Scott asks, and he leans forward in his chair in interest, "I'm no quantum physicist but the gist of it is-"
... or is he?
A week later, Tony pulls off the highway onto the busy but near empty streets of a small village in Virginia. There's not much going on here, which is something he knows to be grateful for. He is a little irritated too, believe him. It's hard not to be, he thinks, as he drives his little sedan through dirt roads towards a big house secluded by woods around it. It's one of the houses his mom had given to him in her will, and while it's been maintained regulardly by housekeepers, it looks almost as though it's been abandoned. He wonders if Howard remembered this house, or if it were as unimportant to him as Tony's existence had proven to be time and time again.
Pepper smiles. Her's isn't forced, but relieved, like she's impressed and pleasantly surprised by Tony's decision, "Is there anything else, Mr. Stark?"
Tony asks, amused despite himself.
Like a robot, Tony steps over to the countertop and reaches for an empty mug. He's never been too big on food, but Steve wasn't mad about the Clint debacle and was basically pleading for him to eat a little. He'd have to take the small mercies where he could get them.
? Are you expecting to hook up with me in a diner in the middle of nowhere? Is that how mating works nowadays?" Tony asks, bitter and astounded by Steve. Why did his heart flutter at the thought of it, though?
," Sam chortles, then, and it's a full-bellied sound that really makes Tony want to be annoyed. He can't, though, because it fills him with a sense of peace now that Sam's more relaxed than he was when he entered the garage.
Later that night, Tony is roused from his sleep just momentarily as a gentle hand cards through his curly locks. The touch is fleeting, almost as though the person who's touching him is afraid he'll disappear; and when his eyes finally pry open, it's Steve who's sitting at the edge of his bed.
. His nose twitches, and Tony's suddenly desperate to find where the scent has originated from. Yes, he's at a diner and the scent of honey isn't entirely out there, but it's distinctive and curls around him like he's meant to absorb it. It's coming from the right of him, he realizes, and his eyes zero in on one man in particular, with a face that seems to haunt his every moment whether he's awake or not.
On the Friday of their first week together, Tony's come home early. It's almost dinner time, and the scent of pasta fills his nose as he walks into the apartment. Steve had given him a key the first day with a charming, nervous smile on his face. Tony felt like his heart was going to burst.
responsibility."
"Tony, you stole my heart the moment I found you trapped in a car, drowning." Steve tells him, and all of his anger is gone as he leans forward and brushes his lips against Tony's temple, "I never thought I would see you open your eyes again. I'll take every bit of me you give. It's got nothing to do with fate, or settling. It's knowing I could've lost the most important person in my world and then being given another chance with him."
Steve looks up at him, his lips a little swollen and his eyes glazed over; but there's so much warmth there, and love. Tony feels like he's swimming in it.
And a little grumpy.
The blond's pulse is slowing down, but Tony can't help the way concern floods him. What could Steve have possibly seen that terrified him so much? And then he reminds himself that they were strangers when they met and got married. There was still so much they barely knew about each other; and Tony had no right to pry into his history or bad dreams.
Bucky looks at him for a long moment, silent and contemplative. Steve realizes it's the first time in a long time that he's had the chance to speak to just Bucky, alone. Not including the minor argument they got into when Bucky first met Tony, of course.
Steve shoots Bucky a dirty look, but the metal-armed man looks unrepentant as his eyes focus on Rhodey. His gaze flickers ever so slightly, like he's found something strange, but he seems to fade into the back like the rest of the pack. Rhodey, too, falters for just a moment as his eyes find Bucky's; but he's a lot better put together than Bucky and manages to flash a smile in his direction.
"I just needed a few minutes to take a shower first."
"What the fuck is going on?" Tony hears Bucky ask distantly, but it's drowned out by the sound of Steve's footsteps getting closer.
The second week is -- different. Not better. Not worse. Just different. Bucky is still around daily, but leaves earlier than he had the first week. Tony feels guilty for getting in the way of their friendship, and can't meet either Bucky or Steve's eyes when he gets home and they're both there.
He'd been friends with Howard once upon a time, when Tony was a child who was sent away to boarding school. How Tony ended up his mate was totally by chance; but Steve can't help the anger that builds. To Howard, for neglecting his child for so long and not valuing him; and to Obadiah, who was seen to be a better father than Howard himself and still wanted to kill him.
"Where are you going?" Steve asks from behind him, but he's not reaching forward to stop him and it gives Tony the thought that his presence really isn't welcomed at the moment.
Tony leans forward, over Steve's lap, licking a stripe along the blond's shaft and enjoying the slight tremble of his body.
He cuts himself off with a sharp inhale, and Tony finally sees how much he's hurting the blond. It makes his heart clench. He knew he was going to hurt Steve since the day he woke up to find they were married; and yet, seeing it first hand-
"Thanks for dinner." He says then, and he's out of his seat and the room so quickly that he's sure no one can stop him.
Stephen's words ring in his ears. If they choose one, they lose the other. It shouldn't be a contest. There shouldn't be a moment's hesitation. And he realizes that maybe that's where his entire relationship with Tony has gone wrong. He shouldn't have to hesitate when it came to his friends. He should've never acted like one was worth more than another.
He opens it, pleasantly surprised that it's fully charged. He opens the contact list, hoping there are some clues as to who he's supposed to be contacting and finds a few familiar names:
He knows that from the start, he's always expected so much from Tony. The only thing to him, though, was that Tony was always so much harder on himself than anyone else was. Maybe it was the guilt of what he'd gone through or maybe it was something else, but Tony was never able to just give himself a break.
Steve feels his heart clench, because the hatred in which Wanda’s voice is saturated in isn’t becoming of a hero. Sure, Tony’s made plenty of mistakes before and during his career as a superhero; but if he’s necessary to save the world, that should be enough of a cause to help him in whatever way they could.
Tony looks up at Steve, then, and the blond is biting on his lower lip and his eyes are asking a question he can't seem to word out loud. Without removing his mouth, Tony reaches out and grabs for Steve's other hand, curled into a couch cushion and keeping himself steady. Tony brings that hand to the back of his head and Steve gets with the program quickly.
Tony had sent Pepper a message as he pulled into a gas station, telling her they were on their way. She didn't ask any questions about who was coming. She just told him they'd be waiting for him at home.
"I'll be damned. Tony Stark is Iron Man." Hawkeye breathes out, and he shares a dirty look with a bemused Black Widow, "We owe Furt 50 bucks each."
Okay. Well, If Howards text was ominous, Pepper's was just plain terrifying. It did come with instructions, though. Watch the news, then call. Okay. He can do that.
Tony grins as he lets the metal sheet fall back onto the table. He can work on it in a few minutes -- he would never leave coffee waiting too long. He shuffles back over to where the coffee is sitting, and he pretends not to notice when Sam's eyes narrow on his forearms and hands. Unfortunately, metal is still pretty sharp; and this garage doesn't come with the safety gloves he knows he'd typically need for working with it. Not that he ever wore it in the first place, but it sounds like a good excuse in his head.
"Bird brain?" Sam counters, and some of the tension is rolling off of him as he sits down on the only stool in the garage.
He shrugs as he finishes the story, pleasantly surprised in his own ability to remain composed; but the anger that racked his body did well to lessen the panic.
As the ending credits roll, Tony shifts the pizza box off of his legs and stands up; and he's not the only one to stand. Natasha stands, as well, and she walks over to the light switch and flicks it back on. There are several hisses and Clint throws a cushion at her, but Natasha won't be deterred. Neither will Tony, and he crouches in front of the television stand, opening the cupboard and pulling out a bottle of scotch and a clean glass that his family has always stocked there.
Tony. You haven't mourned at all; you keep pretending nothing's happened. I know you, Tony. If you don't go to this now and say your goodbye's, you'll regret this for the rest of your life."
Tony is still clutching onto the Iron Patriot armor as he follows, and his mechanical boots are dragging across the cement. There's no way of seeing Tony's face through the Iron Man mask, but he's yet to turn away from Steve's back.
"But Tony, he is your father," Wanda tries from the back of the group. Tony remembers how she'd shared that her and Pietro's family had died many years ago.
"I'm trying, Steve, I'm really trying." Tony chokes out, and it sounds like a heartbroken plea in his own ears.
?" James spits out, and his whole face lights up in fury. He's about to shoot up from his chair, his gaze darting back to Steve, "What type of threat?"
"When we hit the surface, you looked at me, Tony." Steve recalls, plowing through the cut off attempt with the slightest smile on his lips, "You asked me not to leave you alone again."
The brunet offers a weak smile as he fidgets in place. Steve might be gentle and loving but there's still the fact that he's an alpha and Tony just publicly humiliated him.
"You're sure you don't want to get checked out by medical?" The Black Widow asks, just slightly nodding her head in his direction.
"Wanda will not be persuaded, and unless you get to Tony Stark first, she will kill him." Stephen answers, and he thrums his fingers along the surface of the dining table.
The silence is enough of an answer, and Steve takes this chance to look over his teammates. Bucky is just watching them all, because he’s never really had a chance to get to know Tony beforehand; Sam is now sitting back in his chair with his arms crossed in a thoughtful manner; Natasha and Clint are having a silent conversation with just their eyes; Wanda looks like she’s about to storm out with red wisps of power flowing from her fingertips with Vision just staring at her with concern; Scott is taking a sip of his tea like he’s trying to make himself small and unnoticeable; and Stephen just tips his head back with his eyes closed like he’s got somewhere better to be and can’t wait to be done with this.
"I've- I've been ready since finger two." Tony grits out; but while he wants to remain annoyed, he knows Steve is going to make it worth his time.
sound that vibrates in Tony's spine. His head falls onto Tony's shoulder, his arms dropping to Tony's waist and his fingers curling in hard enough to bruise the skin. For whatever reason, Tony doesn't mind.
His focus on the bed he didn't realize he missed as much as he obviously did, his attention snaps back when a flash of movement hits from the corner of his eyes.
At the end of the garage is a glass wall and a little locking mechanism that allows only fingerprints. He had Pepper and Rhodey printed in the past; Natasha's might still work but that might've just been left alone as an oversight. When the door opens with a 'swish,' Tony walks into the workshop. He might be trembling a little, too, as he takes in the work stations and computers and organized clutter that always made him feel at ease.
He pulls, and Tony willingly moves up so that their lips meet in another filthy kiss. Steve doesn't seem to mind that Tony tastes of his cum, and his tongue swirls against the brunet's in a much more languid way than their last kiss. Moments later, when he's finally calmed down and his breathing has returned to normal, he reaches for Tony's erection.
But when Steve just continues staring at him, Tony knows it's on him to take the first step. So he does, taking one step closer to press himself flesh against Steve and curling a hand through the blond's collar to angle him closer. His head tilts just enough, and he tries to convey just how much he wants this with his lips against Steve's.
Steve, of course, doesn't let him pass. He lowers his arm so Tony can't duck under it, then shifts so that he's pressing against Tony so the brunet can't escape.
"Steve. Tony. Knock it off." Bucky growls, and he reaches forward to grab onto Steve's shoulder and yank him backward. Everyone else just stares between them with expressions varying from horror to disblief.
He wants to say something, but doesn't want to distract Steve when it looks like he's having a great time. Instead, he quietly tiptoes around the living room to get into the kitchen. If he's going to be staying home, he might as well get some coffee started and work on armor schematics on his Starkpad.
"You don't mean that." Steve's voice grits out from behind him, and Tony turns around in a swift movement. Steve's staring right at him, jaw clenched and eyes hard.
Oh. Tony's brought back to the nightmare Steve had that one night. He's had a few since them, though Steve doesn't usually tell him what they're about; but Tony doesn't really know what to tell Steve. After all, his identity is a secret.
Tony can't help the twitch of his lips as he hears it; because there are a lot of things he could say about the story, but calling for Jesus isn't the first thing that comes to mind.
"I'm sorry." Tony pants, pulling his mouth away from Steve with his fingers trembling as they curl around Steve's sleeves, "I can't. I have a lot of scars from Afghan- I- fuck, sorry. No. I'm not ready for that yet."
"It's official then, isn't it?" Bucky asks, and Tony doesn't know if he hears relief or suspicion in his tone. It sounds more like resignation, and it makes him feel a little worse.
He's not sure if he feels better at all after speaking with Steve. There are still so many questions without answers. Why follow Tony? Okay sure, they're mates and it would suck to live if the other dies and blah blah blah, but surely Steve could have anybody he wants what with the burly muscles and youthful face? Why choose someone like Tony, who knows nothing about family and knows even less about romance? Was this all a setup by Howard to get him home? Was Steve just trying to play mind games to get him to come home so they could make babies together?
And then, the sanctum disappears and they're all staring up at a log cabin seemingly in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by woods and a beautiful lake, with a chimney that's blowing smoke into the air.
“You’re saying Stark busted us out after all that?” Sam asks, his eyebrows drawn in confusion.
"You got a death wish?" Hawkeye asks as he joins the pair on the street. The rest of the team joins them, and side from cuts and scrapes, it looks like they're all uninjured.
"Surely, that is not possible!" Thor bellows in sorrow, "Young Anthony has been with us for days!"
He watches the realization dawn on Tony's face. It's not something he's told the brunet about before, and it's obvious it's not something Tony imagined he would've said. Tony's not too good with emotional vulnerability; and he's seen it time and time again.
Obadiah's voice is elated, and Tony doesn't bother to hide his grimace.
Tony tries to slip away, but Steve's head snaps back in his direction. Sure, he's usually afraid of Steve's anger; but this is well deserved and he can tell the blond isn't
Steve stares at him, his mouth feeling dry. They've never really spoke about that time, because it was so long ago and heroes aren't expected to have weaknesses anyway; but to hear Tony explain what it was he saw with such a soft and weak voice? Why hadn't Tony just told him back then? Why hadn't they trusted each other back then? They trusted each other on the field so why couldn't they trust each other off of it, as well?
Steve takes the rest of his clothes off as he grabs the lube, and Tony feels his throat dry as he takes in the well-built frame of the man fate decided was his. He looks down at himself, knowing he'll regret what he's about to do later, but forces himself to shrug off his shirt and toss it to the floor beside Steve's. When he looks up, Steve is staring at a chest full of scars that Tony has never shown another person before. He can't help but shrink at the gaze. He's not built like Steve. He's not
Furious and grieving, Tony attended her wake wasted, and even though it was seen as repulsive behavior, that was the only way Tony could get through the ceremony. He ducks out early, unable to watch as his mother, the only person left who really and truly loved him, was put into the ground. He ended up in the hospital that very night, after driving his convertible over a bridge. He's still not sure how he managed to survive that, but he did. He has no recollection, however, and the doctors told him it was so traumatic that his brain had automatically blocked it out.
No matter how many times he's had to fight a friend in the past, it would never get easier. From the Hulk, to Bucky, to Tony, and to Wanda - having to treat a comrade and friend like an enemy nearly crushed his heart.
"Consider it done, sir." JARVIS replies, and Tony waits a beat to give his AI a moment to get it done.
"If your question is why I was brought back here like we're on the same side," Tony begins, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms, "that's my question, too."
It's weird to have a finger in your ass. He's not a virgin, as stated before, but it's still something he has to get used to. It causes his penis to flag a little, which is good because he really doesn't want this to end too soon. The first finger isn't too bad, but then Steve has another finger in addition and his fingers curl and brush at his prostate and he's a panting, moaning mess.
Tony can't really understand why Steve is so
"I don't want to hear that from the guy that jumps from rooftops on a regular occasion." Tony scoffs, and he winces as he pulls himself onto his feet. The suit absorbs most shocks, thankfully; but he's still a human in a metal suit. Something's digging into his calf and he can feel it.
"I promised myself when my mom died that I wouldn't have anything to do with mates, Steve." Tony replies, and he wishes for Steve to back up so he could get up and run away like he's been wanting to, "And you're an amazing guy, Steve. I knew that since my dad first told me about you. You saved my life, and you've been content with just watching me from a distance ever since I left home, but Steve, I'm not going to be a good mate to you. I can't be a replacement for your friend and-"
Tony had been through hell and back. From a childhood with Howard, to Obadiah and capture in Afghanistan, to Vanko and Palladium poisoning, to flying a nuke into a portal above New York City - not to mention helping in the wake of the destruction caused by Ultron and then dealing with Killian and the Mandarin. Tony was always so strong in the past, how could Stephen even suggest that?
?" Tony demands, but his tone is tired and frustrated, not angry.
When Steve releases his lips, it's just so that he can trail kisses along the side of Tony's neck, and his fingers manage to slip underneath Tony's tee-shirt. His fingers are gentle and teasing, and Tony shudders at the ticklish sensation as the fingertips on his skin continue their trek upwards to his chest. Tony bucks his hips as a finger brushes against his nipple, because he's never been so sensitive until he's met Steve. Steve chuckles against his neck, and when he bites down on the small patch of skin behind Tony's ear, his fingers twist Tony's nipple. It's different from how Tony had done it to him, and Tony wonders if maybe he had done it wrong after all, because the spike of pleasure he feels from the nip is multiplied from the pressure of Steve's fingers.
, and all he wants right now is to be closer. He wraps his legs around Steve's waist, and he's surprised to find that Steve just allows himself to be rolled aside.
All of a sudden he's grateful for the bland, light stew that the monks had prepared for them. Anything else would've just been rejected by his body.
But for the first few days of the week, it works. Then on Wednesday, when he gets home and the pair are sitting on the couch watching a baseball game, the game is cut off by an emergency broadcast that has all three tense.
"Fucking hell." Clint breathes out, and he places his bow down onto the dining table.
"Are you up, J?" He asks into the suit, firing his repulsor boots to head in the direction of where the fight had been on the news.
"I'm sorry, Tony. We both did stuff back then we shouldn't have done, and that's the truth." Steve continues, and he's sure to keep Rhodey's name off his lips if it means sparing an old friend of that torment, "But we need you - I need you - to come home. There's no Avengers without you."
Tony winces, but when he turns his head back to Steve and sees that same expression of heartbreak, he can't help himself. He leans the small distance between them, pressing his lips against Steve's in a gentle touch. It's meant to be chaste, of course, but Steve reacts instantly, his arms wrapping around Tony once more and crushing the slighter male between his chest and the door. The pang of guilt in his chest is heavy, and he hates feeling like he's manipulating Steve.
"Sounds good." Tony agrees, clearing his throat and turning just slightly so Steve can't see the dusting of red on his cheeks. The blond doesn't look even remotely fooled by his attempts, but Tony focuses on filling his mug with coffee, "I'll make us some popcorn and order some pizza. What do you want on it?"
"Woah. Where's the fire, bro?" Clint asks; and it's because Tony had moved so quickly he almost barreled into the unsuspecting man.
"-and then she stabbed him in the eye!" Clint exclaims, and while the rest of the table bursts into laughter, Tony only manages to force a smile.
Steve turns again at the sound of his sob, and his eyes widen every so slightly, the saddest of smiles tugging at the corners of his lips as he ducks down and presses another kiss to Tony's lips.
They talk until the sun starts to rise. She's still in New York, working for Stark Industries in their legal department. He's just a little further south, making his way due west to get as far away from Howard as humanly possible.
And he meant it. They still had to deal with Howard, and whatever past Steve had with Bucky, but Tony was starting to really see the kind of man Steve was. He didn't want to lose that. Even if fate were playing him like a joke, maybe this time, he would let it.
"Did you... Tony, did you get hurt?" Steve asks, worried and a little angry as he follows after Tony.
"Are you sure you want to go through with this?" Tony asks now, just to confirm. This whole situation can go off horribly and he knows it. How can he bring Steve into it?
Bucky takes a long moment to think about his words, then stands from Wanda's bed and joins Steve on the edge of Clint's, instead, "There's a lot of blame going around. Tony blames all of you. All of you take turns blaming yourselves and blaming him. I'm still wondering if maybe you should've just let me-"
"You're not broken, Tony." Steve promises, but Tony doesn't believe that at all.
When Steve is finally back on solid ground, his knees give out and he retches right onto the stone beneath him. He hasn't had anything yet today, so the only thing to come up is bile, but it doesn't stop him from getting sick anyway.
"She was originally dying from cancer. Terminal." Tony answers anyway, and he has the glass of water in his hand. He wishes it were whiskey, but at least holding it gives his hand something to do. "I was -- a teenager, I think. I had just graduated from M.I.T. Howard thought I was too smart and too rebellious so he sent me away when I was young, so I spent most of my childhood at boarding schools and then went to college. I got the call before he did. He was out of the country with some lady. Mom found out. The mate bond snapped and killed her."
"I guess we got two weddings coming up." Sams says in a good natured joke, but there's that glint in his eye as he ducks past Steve like the blond is going to hit him. The rest chortle and snicker as they follow him in, but Steve doesn't mind it too much.
"You're here as friends but you've all got sharp things pointed at me." He remarks, his tone dry and just the flicker of amusement passing along his expression. He takes a step forward, unashamed and unafraid, and Steve watches with bated breath as he stops just before Bucky. They could both hurt each other so easily, and he could do nothing about it.
Dinner is a bustling kind of affair, with all the different personalities and voices surrounding him. He learns the brunette's name is Wanda, and though the group doesn't go into it much, she had a twin brother named Pietro. Thor tells his own tales of his family at home, overseas in Norway, including a brother named Loki and Tony can't help but wonder about the family's obession with Norse gods. Clint talks more the further they get into dinner, making wisecracks and receiving plenty of fond thumps on his head from Natasha. Sam talks a little bit to Bucky at the far end of the table, and Tony tries not to think about how he's directly across the table from Steve, who is much quieter and watching Tony's reactions more closely than the genius would prefer.
Several circular shapes are being made in the air, and the Avengers are falling into them and leaving the villain that they had created alone again.
"Here." Steve confirms, raising his head just enough to press a kiss to the side of Tony's forehead. His lips are gentle, the heat that radiates from them causing for Tony's own skin to flush. Steve's very fond of giving forehead kisses, and Tony's never been on the receiving end of them until meeting the blond.
When he pulls back, Steve's eyes are still closed and his breath is hot as it fans across Tony's face, "You'll join us for the movie, right?"
Tony's not a marriage expert. The only married couple he knew of was his parents, and that wasn't a good thing. But the point still stands. Isn't a newly married couple supposed to be -- well, more involved than a pair of strangers sharing a bed? Not that they share a bed, what with Steve always running out into the living room when Tony is practically forced into taking the bed.
And just at the demand, Steve lets go, like he's been waiting for permission. Tony follows not a moment later, and their bodies thrust forward against each other as they come down from it. Tony falls backward onto the bed, knowing his entire body is covered in sweat and cum, but unable to care much about it. Steve pulls himself out slowly, and Tony hisses from the sensitivity as the blond stands up to look for something to clean off with. He comes back toward him a minute later, and Tony is amused but not surprised when Steve cleans him off with a towel.
"You say a lot about family and needing each other, Cap," the metallic voice coming from the suit has never sounded so hollow, "but I couldn't even protect mine."
"I want you to lose it." Tony bites back, lips curled into what he knows is a cocky grin. Steve inhales, a sharp sound that's followed by a little whimper, but he manages to hold himself back. Tony doesn't want to be held like glass right now, and he wants to make it clear. That's why he leans forward, letting his teeth nip at the mark he's left behind on Steve's pale skin.
He gets up slowly, dusting off his pants and taking slow and measured steps to the car as the doors open. Steve and Natasha step out of the car, and from the back doors, step out a pair of males that Tony hadn't met yet. One black male, he notes, mocha-brown eyes screaming caution, and dressed sharply with an air about him that screams he was once part of the military, and another pale-faced man with long raven locks and blue eyes.that are clouded over. The second guy has a metal arm that Tony can't pretend he's not interested in, but there's a look in his eyes that has Tony taking a step back subconsciously.
That causes Bucky to grin, just slightly, as he steps forward and lowers himself onto a stool at the kitchen counter. Tony's baffled by the reaction, half expecting for the man to throw a punch, or something equally violent. Instead, the two of them stare at each other for a long moment, and then Tony grabs a pair of mugs and pours coffee for the both of them.
"You went out there again?" Steve grits out, and his fists are clenching.
He noses along the side of Steve's neck, and the blond's fingers curl tighter. Tony doesn't think he's entirely aware of it at that point, but he doesn't protest the grip. His lips brush against the mark, and he hears the hitch in Steve's breath as his lips wrap around the skin of his neck. His teeth give it a little nip, like what's expected in a mark, and he releases a soft moan at the taste of Steve's skin in his mouth. Steve moans into his ear in return, and his hips thrust into Tony from the pleasure of the mark.
He goes in anyway, shoulders squared as he hopes to god no one recognizes his face, but freezes right as he enters the threshold. The scent of honey hits him, and it hits him
"You wanted me to keep you warm." The blond says, and Steve's breath is hot as it fans across his face. Tony hates how his body reacts to just that alone, but doesn't struggle even when a part of his brain tells him he should.
"Tony?" Steve asks, and he has his arms wrapped around Tony's torso and the brunet is cradled tightly against him in case he goes into shock.
"Cap?" Tony returns, and that flicker of amusement returns as he turns to his former leader, "Or should I call you
"How long have you been following me?" Tony directs this question to Steve now. Steve, who hasn't said a thing since he sat down and was instead pushing that plate of food and a cup of lukewarm coffee in Tony's direction.
"Ultron, which you created." Wanda hisses, and it's the first time she's participated in their conversation. There is no warmth in her tone as she locks her gaze onto Tony, and Steve's glad her powers are quelled because there's no telling what she'd do.
"Tony," he says as he gets closer, and it's not like he had a reason to call for his attention ahain, since Tony's waiting for him, "I'm here now. I'm not leaving you alone again."
Rhodey is taller, but not by much; his frame seemingly lanky but hiding taut muscles. He grins as soon as Tony gets up, and no affection is lost between them as Rhodey wraps his arms tight around the slighter. The eyes on them are questioning and thoughtful, but the pack leaves them to their greeting in peace despite the growing curiosity.
"I'm fine, Steve. If something were to happen I would've called you." He urges, and he reaches out to cup Steve's face; but the blond turns his head at the last second.
"If you just wanted a fight I'm sure Iron Man would've been happy to share the battlefield that was once our home." Steve grits out, his jaw tense and his eyes roaming the room to mentally calculate their chances. It doesn't look good in their favor, that's for sure.
"I doubt Pepper knows about the phone call if I didn't." James surmises as he stands up, "We've been building a case to try and get Stane out, but we don't have any official evidence that can stand in court. Tony can provide witness but if Obadiah is holding you over his head-"
That seems to annoy the alien; but before it can turn its ray onto the Captain, Iron Man swoops down and locks his arms under the Captain's shooting up in the air and aiming a gauntlet in its direction.
When Tony pats the bed next to him, Steve gingerly takes a seat. Even though they're right next to each other, there's enough space between them to fill a galaxy with stars. Steve remembers sitting side by side, relaxed and joking together and discussing future plans. He wishes so desperately that he could just go back in time to those moments.
"Since you left New York," Steve answers, and Tony's eyebrows fly upwards, concealed by his curly hair. Steve looks up at him, and his expression is neutral, but there's this heavy emotion hidden in his gaze as he too leans back and mimics Tony's position, "You wanted your freedom so I didn't want to push you, but you're also my mate and I didn't want to be too far in case something happened to you."
"Fuck me." Tony says, and while he wants it to be a demand, it sounds more like a plea, "I want you to fuck me. Please."
"I will warn you once and only once to stop protecting the murderer." Wanda warns the group, and just for that moment, her eyes drift away from Tony.
"No kidding," Tony mutters in agreement, and they share another chuckle. Tony looks at his new companion, finding that he's genuinely interested in Sam's backstory. How did an army-man like him end up in a pack like Steve's, following a mere
Sam, having taken a little too long to think about it, turns his head quickly in Bruce's direction, "
that he's not saying. Sometimes, even knowing with all their heart, the little reassurances make unbearable situations like this easier to deal with.
"Steve!" He bites out, his head thrown back and his hands clenched and curled into the bedsheets behind him. And then Steve does a thing with his tongue, flickering it against his slit, and he reaches his hand out quickly, fisting in Steve's hand and giving it a rough yank, "Ke-keep that up and we won't be able to d-do anything el-se."
"I totally underestimated how rich you were," Sam scoffs in amusement, and his eyes are twinkling as he looks around.
Even on her own with limited experience and a lack of stability, Wanda is a powerful fighter. Without his shield, he can't dodge her attacks well but still manages to duck and roll when she gets too close. Steve falls into a crouch and Bucky uses his back as leverage to get closer, throwing his metal arm in a swing, but he gets knocked back easily. As cool as a metal arm is, it's still somewhat heavy. Sam manages to swoop in and catch him before he hits the ground too hard. Again, Steve is wildly relieved that Sam is part of their team.
Steve just uses his head to gesture at the other side of the booth, "Sit."
He pushes Steve away again, and Steve looks understandably hurt. Tony can tell he's giving the man whiplash. Tony closes his eyes momentarily, darting his tongue out to decide on how swollen his lips must be. They're raw and tingling, but he loves the feeling of it.
"Family," Tony echoes with a hollow laugh like he's never heard of anything more absurd.
"Clint, 'Tasha, eyes outside." Steve issues; and it's short and precise, and both Clint and Natasha move with an elegance Tony hasn't expected them to have. Steve looks over at him for the briefest moment, and there's something flashing in his eyes, but it passes quickly as the alpha turns his head in Bucky's direction, "Sam, you and Bucky with me. The rest of you stay here. Protect Tony."
"I don't know if I can do this, Sam," he admits, and he's surprised by his own willingness to admit it, "I haven't designed weapons in years. I've got no resources, no time, and no ideas."
But while those are his words of protest, Tony can feel it in the mate bond that Steve doesn't actually want to leave, either. The exhaustion radiates off of him in waves, and he's not the only one who looks like they're aching for more sleep. Tony runs a hand through his hair as he thinks it through, knowing he doesn't actually have any plans on where to go from here.
It's not the fancy kind of coffee maker, and yet, Tony stares in awe as the coffee drips into the carafe. Just a few more minutes, now, and he'll have all the caffeine he could need to get through the day. He mulls over the previous day's events in his head as he waits, feeling nervous and giddy all at once. Steve's pack was welcoming towards him, of course, with the exception of Bucky, but he couldn't help but wonder what their thoughts of him were. After all, even though he was fated to be their alpha's mate, he could still be considered as an outsider in their midst.
Except he doesn't actually leave. He steps away from Tony to push the button on the wall that makes the garage door recede completely. He waits, silent as Tony stares after him, until the yard is fully visible, then turns to Tony with both hands tucked into his pockets.
"Sweetheart, look at me," comes Steve's voice, and Tony turns to him almost reluctantly. They were having such a good morning before all this bullshit happened. Tony's expecting irritation or pity, or something else -- but instead, all he sees is the love that's always there, "We'll get through this. We'll take him down."
While he calls Steve honey from time to time, it's the first time Steve's called him with a term of endearment of his own. Maybe they are getting a little further in their relationship, after all.
Tony was only 17 when his mom died, and only 17 when he met Steve. Between the age of 17 and 21, he had no idea of Steve's whereabouts or his relations to Howard. He would have to ask about it when he gets the chance to.
"Sweetheart," Steve calls out, gentle; and Tony looks at him with such anguish in his eyes as Steve runs his thumbs across the brunet's sharp jawline, ignoring the way Tony's facial hair causes his fingertips to tickle, "I love everything you're doing to keep
"Whatever. I'm done." Tony decides; and without another word, he enters the elevator and smashes the button that'll take him to the penthouse. From there, he can lock down the floor so no one else can get in our out until he works what just happened out in his head; but seeing as everyone else is going to the wake, he might not even need to do that much. After all, it's Steve's pack and Pepper has to get them out soon so they won't miss too much of the event.
I just wanted to say I really love all your comments. I love feedback and knowing where and what to improve on. I know there’s a lot going on and if you’re not tired of it yet I’m grateful. I hope this chapter was enjoyable. Thanks for sticking around.
"Tony. You're a civilian." Steve grunts, and his steps are slow as he closes the space between them. Tony's not afraid of him, of course, but the anger on his face reminds him of Captain America and Tony decidedly hates that.
"He's part of our pack, James." Steve tells him, partly to reassure him, but partly to drive the idea into the man's head, "We look out for our own."
Tony straightens his back, and he bends down in order to pick a knife off the floor. Steve and Bucky look at each other in concern because they're not sure what Tony's planning to do -
long to think about it. His head tilts back and his eyes flutter shut and there's a bead of sweat that trails down from his temple that Tony for the life of him can't seem to look away from.
Steve's reaction to his touch is instantaneous. He grabs Tony's wrist, twisting his arm behind his back as he shoots out of the couch to subdue whoever is after him.
As much as Tony wants for them to hold out, his orgasm had been building from the moment they started kissing. He can't last much longer, not when Steve feels so good inside of him. He's sure that that's what Steve is going for, too, and his fingers tighten their hold on Tony as he nears his climax.
They'll be waiting, as a pack.
And then, when he turns around and looks up into vulnerable eyes, Tony takes a step forward. Steve doesn't move, just waiting with those soft blue eyes waiting in anticipation, and he just allows it when Tony reaches up and cups his face.
Steve's hips roll against his, and the pain from his bite gets overshadowed by the pleasure of their elections rubbing against one another. It leaves him in a hazy buzz of pleasure, and Tony tugs at the hair on Steve's head.
and the supposed
Tony releases the mark, running his tongue over it and slowly shifting back in Steve's lap to look up at the blond. Steve's blue eyes are blown wide, his chest still heaving from the thrill of it. He runs his tongue along his swollen lips, and Tony's eyes focus on it like he's never seen anything more captivating. When his eyes turn back up to Steve's, there's a question dancing in his gaze. Tony knows what it is even without being asked, and though he once told himself he never would, he tilts his head and leans closer.
"A nice ceremony on a beach would fare well!" Thor chims in, his gaze faw away peaceful, "We should take great haste in finding an auspicious day."
"Hey, Tony, we got time for breakfast before we hit the road?" Sam calls out, good naturedly, as he steps into the kitchen, and Tony feels himself tense.
He scoffs, then turns once more to leave, but his body collides with another. He recoils strongly, taking a wide step back as he eyes the petite frame he'd walked into. Red, curly hair, lips painted with a color that can only resemble blood, the barely concealed spark of danger in her eyes. Natasha, of course she was there.
All the way to the room they're bunking in, the air is thick with tension and apprehension, and Steve enters the room first, coming to stand at parade rest and turning in Tony's direction to see what the next step is.
But as he reaches the doorknob of the room he'd been given, his stomach grumbles. It's been days since his last meal, since it's hard to find anything other than junk food, but he can't help but glower at his stomach and its poor timing. There's really not much to it, though; it's simple, he needs to go find food.
Alas, having the compound possibly destroyed by Tony Stark meant they had nowhere else to go. Of course, they could go back to Wakanda where they had been hiding, but who’s to say Tony wouldn’t just follow them there?
"Do you, maybe... want to watch a movie with me?" Steve asks, hope lining his tone even though his eyes are nervously avoiding Tony's. His cheeks are tinted ever so slightly, too, and Tony's heart melts at the sight of it.
"Steve?" He rasps out, and he winces at the dryness of his throat. That won't be pretty come morning, but that's a thought for the morning, not for right now.
"He was my friend. All of you were my friends." He's practically spitting it out, eyes set ablaze, "I wanted us to work something out together. I wanted us to come home
The blond chuckles against his lips even as he thrusts his hips forward, and Tony hurriedly tugs the sweats off in order to feel their skin against one another. The pants disappear with a firm kick, and Steve grinds down on him, using one of his ridiculously large hands to stroke them both together.
"About that," Tony speaks up, and when everyone's attention quickly snaps over to him, he clears his throat, "Where are you going next?"
And while that's normally the case, this fucker is slick. The Black Widow does manage to shoot it in the head, but the moment it's hit, it starts glowing beneath its translucent skin.
There's a shuffling sound being heard from over the line and Tony waits, because it really is 3 AM and maybe Pepper really had been in bed. She waited two years to hear from him, really, he could wait a few minutes.
"If Mister Stark can create something like Ultron by chance out of good intentions," Vision speaks up, his voice low and tired and fearful all at once, "one could only imagine what he would create, with purpose and bad intentions."
Surprisingly, Bucky's not there. Steve is, curled up on the armchair with a lengthy novel in his hands, brows furrowed and entirely enraptured by whatever he's reading. Tony's heart skips a beat. He's always been told that when he's in focus on something, there's something artistic about him. Likewise, Steve is like a life-sized portrait that looks almost too beautiful to be real.
"Do you still have feelings for him?" He asks, and Bucky doesn't answer immediately. Tony's a little relieved by this, but can't help but feel the sorrow that gnaws at the back of his mind. Fate really wasn't fair to the pair of them, was it?
"Fool me once and all that." And then, before Steve can really pay attention, Tony bashes their heads together and throws himself off the blond's lap.
"You'll be good for him," James decides when he finally deems himself calm enough to speak again, and Steve feels such a strong sense of relief that he releases a breath he didn't know he was holding onto.
Tony's eyes soften as he listens, because it sounds like such a terrible way to lose a lover, and a best friend.
"Never." Steve says with finalty, and his own gaze is stern, "I won't press you, Tony. I'll wait until you're ready to come back on your own."
"I'm up next," he sounds out; and when he hears it out loud, he knows the truth, "Obadiah is going to kill me."
"I'm not a civilian." He responds, his words sounding distant and feeling like they're coming from someone else all together.
"Tony, please." Steve pleads, and he wishes oh so much that he could just go back in time and stop all this from happening because while they always argued and bickered, he never wanted Tony as his enemy; not even in the bunker where he thought stopping Tony was the best way to save him, "Don't do this. If it has to be anyone, let it be me. Don't take it out on them. Please don't do this."
"No, honey. I'm alright today." He soothes; and while Steve doesn't look convinced, he allows for Tony to get up and walk away in the direction of the bathroom to clean his mouth off.
"I'm walking him out, punk." Bucky says by way of explanation, and Steve's amused by the situation. At least Bucky's happy.
"I regret skipping this step before we got married." Steve says, and his fingers are clammy and fumbling with the velvet box. He pops it open, and sitting inside is a pair of simple silver bands.
The only two left standing are Bucky and Steve, and Steve's suddenly brought back to that bunker where everything had changed.
Wanda sends out a blast of power that knocks everyone off of their feet. Steve finds himself pressed against his shield, picking it up with nothing more than instinct. It's been so long without it and yet it feels like he's never let it go.
"Tell me what you want." Steve says, voice rasping and low as he nips at Tony's exposed throat.
And that causes Steve's heart to break. Sure, he's known about the tight friendship between Tony and Rhodey. They all did. But for someone as confident and self assured as Tony to feel like he's got no place in the world without his best friend? Suddenly, he's brought back in time to when he thought he'd lost Bucky. If anyone knew how Tony would feel in such a moment, it was him.
"I know you better than anyone, Rhodey, and this is not a social call." Tony says, and he wants to sound gentle, but the forced coolness in his voice is enough to snap Rhodey out of whatever he's planning.
"I figured you'd want some time alone after yesterday," Steve says with a shrug, and Tony feels his own shoulders dropping at the tone in his voice. Steve doesn't want to spend time away from him, but even now, he's thinking of Tony's comfort before his own.
Obadiah is lying through his teeth. but Tony really doesn't have the stomach to argue it, "
"But what do -- what do we
"How did you sleep?" A soft voice asks from his side, and Tony turns his head to see Wanda looking at him, an eyebrow raised, and this smug, knowing look on her face.
His words register as soon as they're uttered, and everyone turns to Steve as they expect an answer -being Tony's mate, and all-, but it's Natasha who answers, ever so carefully, "He said you were having a mental crisis and questioning your responsibilities to Stark Industries."
"You know what's not fair?" Tony asks, and he releases a bitter laugh as he raises a hand in Wanda's direction, "In Sokovia, your little witch friend showed me a vision in which I saw all of you die and I was told I could have done more. So I did. Ultron wasn't supposed to happen the way he did; but I did what I was manipulated into. And yet, I was the villain while all of you carted her around. I was the one who was used for resources to find the man who killed my mother without being told the whole story. I was the one who lost my best friend in a fight that shouldn't have happened because no one wanted to work together to find a goal. I was the one who went as a friend to Siberia and was left alone to bleed to death because 'Captain America can do no wrong.'"
much Steve had managed to let go. An eyebrow raised, he flicks his towel against Steve's butt and walks out of the room, "What was it you said? 'Not a chance, sweetheart'?"
Natasha swallows, and it looks so painful that it causes Steve's throat to dry out. Had Tony always felt that way? That he was just a convenience and someone who could be used to everyone else's ends?
Tony just laughs, because in all honesty, this is what he wanted. Steve's still too gente with him, holding back like he's actually going to break Tony in half. While the genius appreciates that in everyday situations, he wants Steve to actually let himself go when they're having sex.
"Which one do I shoot?" Clint asks, running his tongue over his upper lip as his gaze darts between Tony and Wanda.
