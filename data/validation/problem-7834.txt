"When used often, the body tends to build up a natural defense foreign substance. The effectiveness of the medicines will decrease over time." The AI replied.
However, he had gone too far with the woman in front of him and he knew it. She was boiling. He had hit and nerve and he knew it, but there was nothing he could do. He had shot himself in the foot, and the only thing he could do was continue the fight as she wasn't going to let it drop; however, it made him sick to his stomach. It was dawning on him that he was ruining his chance with Toni.
It was laughable, and if Fury wasn't 'dying'—you never know with that man- in Steve's Living room, she might be rolling around on the floor in a fit of laugher. Okay, she still might do that. The
"I'm a big girl, Rogers," she said, still trying to wiggle out of his arms.
The Captain glanced down at her before scanning the room. Clint had taken several steps forward but he stopped halfway through the room. Natasha hadn't move from the corner of the room; however, Bruce was on his feet, but he hadn't moved either. The Commandos were still on the couch, eyeing the scene in front of them. "Stand back," he said.
"But it didn't last. I pissed her off and she stormed back in." He rubbed the back of his head, because he knew he had made it worse. "I put my own foot in my month."
"I made the mess. I can clean it," she said. When she was sure her red cheeks were gone, she turned to him with a smile. Her arm was feeling better and though she was overshooting, she could be getting it off in a few weeks. "You worry too much," she smiled as she waved the cast.
Against his better judgement, Tony glances up over her blanket and peeks around the room, meeting everyone's gaze for a second before turning away. He takes a deep breath, knowing he can't hide from this. This woman has outed him, and he hates her for it… okay, no he doesn't, but he doesn't exactly like her at the moment—or any moment. "It won't change anything," he says as quietly as possibly.
Steve's eye brow rose. "Have often have you seen Thor shirtless?" No, he wasn't jealous.
His shoulders fell. "I hate that you call me Rogers. Why can't you call me Steve?" He sounded depressed.
"You're just being stupid," she told herself. She pushed herself up, exhaling slowly. She had to get her mind off Barnes' death.
"Tasha," Toni said, her mouth tight.
The next time that Toni woke, she was alert, which was surprising. She was expecting more torture, but she was alone in the room. The only thing she could hear was her own breathing and the rattling of the chains, and that was a scary thing; she didn't know how to handle this. What did it mean? Were they done with her? Did she tell them something in her haze? She hoped to whoever the hell was upstairs that she didn't, but if she did spill her guts (something she would never ever live down), why was she still live? Surely, she wasn't needed anymore, though she did have a boat ton of future information to give. Or maybe, they were going to drain her dry, and if they did that, she didn't know how, but she knew one thing: they would not be gentle.
"Geez, Romanoff." Toni said as she stepped back to the table. "But it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants," she said, jumping back to the matter at hand.
Toni watched Bucky as he rounded the corner. She didn't know what happened next, but she heard a struggle with a few colorful words and then something falling to the ground. Panic, she dashed around the corner with her gun in her hand, ready to use it, but instead, she was shocked to find Barnes standing over a body with a knife in his hand. Blood dripped from the blade. "Bucky," she uttered, shocked to see him like that.
Sending the bag flying off the hook, he watched it soar before turning and grabbing another bag. He hanged it on the hook and continued to take his anger out. Between each punch, his mind wandered to Romanoff and the others, wondering if they had found something. If they did, would they even tell him?
She didn't fall asleep around people, even when she was dead tired and had been up for over 24 hours. Sure, there had been times where she had fallen asleep while working on a project or during a movie night with the group. But those times were different, because she was safe. She was surrounded by friends, who she could trust—well for the most time. (For Natasha and Clint, it changed on the normal basic.) Anyone else, that was a hard no. That was hell to the no. So why in the hell would she fall sleep with this man, she barely knew, in the car going to god knows where? Something was not adding up, and why wasn't her brain working? "Where are you taking me?" she asked, pushing her tired self up.
"Stark!"
After pouring herself a cup of coffee—black, she twisted her body around and leaned against the counter, barely able to keep upright on her shaky legs. She brought her hot, steaming cup to her lips and took a few small slips. Grinning like the Cheshire cat, Toni could already feel the magic juice work, snapping her sleeping cells awake. It would be the end of world—no, the end of time if coffee were ever to lose its effect on her. She would be a bloody mess if it did.
Toni froze, recognizing that voice. It was that assassin from the alley, and as hard as she tried, she couldn't stop herself from flashing back to that moment. "You got to be kidding me," she moaned. How the fuck did this happen? How was she this unlucky? How did someone hate her this much? Unless, they were working together. Shit. Mother Fucking shit. Could someone just kill her now?
"Oh, honey, if I wanted to make you cry, I wouldn't need this movie to do so," Toni replied, popping a few more corns into her mouth.
"The lab is under lockdown and no one is allowed in until a full scan is completed," JARVIS stated. "That is the protocol that Miss Stark had written."
"Um, thanks," Steve uttered, totally confused. Before he could ask for what, Killian disappeared out the door and down the hall. He eyed the hall for a second before he turned back to Toni. He gave her an odd look, taking a few steps toward her. "Am I missing something?"
He wasn't sure, but he knew his heart couldn't take it, and he was left lost and confused. He wasn't sure what he should do next. Should he let her go? He wasn't even sure if it could go back to what it was? They crossed a line in that last fight, and there was a chance that they couldn't repair it.
Toni couldn't help but groan, because that was too long. She couldn't wait that long as there was no telling what could happen in that time. She couldn't risk talking to anyone else while she was in this state as there was no telling what could happen. There was a chance that she would say something else she would regret, and she couldn't take the rest of the Avengers hating her, though she wondered if that was too late. She wouldn't put it past them as she was truly a horrible person.
"That sounds like a challenge," he grinned, as he closed the distance between them. With grace and speed, he swept the genius off her feet, pinning her against hist chest. Like she was nothing, Steve whirled her around before gently setting her down on the bed. "I like a challenge." His voice was low and husky. Putting her between his knees, he climbed on the bed and hovered above her. He hesitated for second before he dove in, lining kisses to her neck. He lingered on a few places as his mouth worked, drawing out a shudder from the brunette.
Steve kneed down next to Toni. "Are you okay?" he asked, lowering his voice so only she could hear him.
On the other hand, Maya's expression changed suddenly and panic took over. In a shaky form, she stumbled forward. "What?" she uttered as she reached for something-anything to support herself. "Killian, no!" she protested, terror setting in her eyes. "You can't. You don't know what it would do to the baby."
Reaching for Steve, Toni stepped forward and placed a hand on his biceps as if to tell him to stand down. If it was just Rhodes and Pepper, she could handle them. "It's fine, Steve."
Again, Rogers stared at her. "No," he stated a little bit too strongly. "He's my roommate. His name is James Barnes, but I call him Bucky," he said quickly.
She was warm and comfortable, which she hadn't felt in a long time. Toni felt safe sleeping in what had to be a bed, as no couch was this comfortable though some of her couches in her labs could compete. She hadn't felt this way in a long time. Even after she had let the Avengers in, she hadn't felt like this. She couldn't really be herself around them as she felt like they were always judging her. She knew she could be imagining it all, but she had seen theirs eyes. She had seen Rogers' eyes, which could always shoot right through her.
*O*O*
"I'm old fashion, Tony. Needed to hear it," Steve says as he leans forward and catches Tony's lips with his. He sucks on Tony's bottom lip. He keeps a firm hold on Tony's face as he fights for dominance. It's like a battle going on in his mouth, and it doesn't end until Bucky pulls Tony from Steve.
Phillips eyed her as he stepped to her side. "How do you plan to use it?" he asked.
"I think you're crazy."
"Really that's your worst nightmare?" she asked. "…Okay, that's pretty scare. Who wants to be the man?"
"Calm down? We're trusting a murderer!" Steve yelled, so annoyed that they or SHIELD could dare ask Loki for help. That was no doubt in his mind that Loki would betray them as soon as he could. "What-"
"Two of the Howling Commandos. Gabriel Jones and Timothy Dugan," Steve stated. His tone was odd to say the least "They served with me during World War II, and this is Trip, Gabe's grandson."
Though they weren't close, Toni knew that was a lie. Talked to Peggy on a regular basic (Shit, she loved that woman), she knew Sharon was no fucken Nurse. That woman probably didn't know how to work a needle. She was a spy, a spy working for fucking Fury. A Shield Agent…a Shield Agent that happened to live down the hall from Steve's and who was wearing a Nursing uniform. Why was there a shield Agent living down the hall from Steve, pretending to be a nurse? "So, I take it Steve doesn't know you're spying on him."
She stepped away from him, toward the building's entrance. "I trust no one," she admitted.
"What do you want to talk about?" he asked again as he stepped through the doorway.
She narrowed her eyes at him as she watched him pull out a box. "What is it?" she asked as she stared at the little gray box. It was too big to be a ring box, though she wouldn't have any idea of why he would give her jewelry of any kind.
"Do you know who Johann Schmidt is?" Phillips asked.
Finding her was pure luck as he almost walked right pass the empty lot trying to forget his failures. She had been crying out for help but neither he nor anyone around him could hear her in all the noise. It had been a loud night that day in New York and her cries couldn't be heard over the loud music and voices. If it wasn't for the small cat he chased into the lot trying to save, he would have never found the girl.
"Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor."
There was another question she didn't want to answer, because she had no answer. "So you're going to let me go without a fuss?" That shocked her.
students. She just assisted the young man when he couldn't get it to work. Though, he could be blaming her because she randomly popped into his classroom and inserted herself into his lesson. She joked she was returning home- AKA to a lab, as she joined a random classroom in DC, and though the Professor was shooting draggers at her, she got to admit this was the best decision in the world. However, she felt like a fish in a fish bowl with small children pounding on the glass. The College's lab had a glass wall, and there was a line of people staring, taking picture. "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently." She said, remembering that quote from somewhere. Did it matter where?
Toni was still fighting in his arms and didn't answer alright away. However, after a few long minutes, her struggles died down and she went stiff in his arms. "I-I didn't tell J-JARVIS to call you." Closing her eyes, she buried her face in his chest, and it was hard to make out what she was saying. She was shaking, crying heavily, and no matter how he held her, he could not calm her. Her sobs were loud and wet, but Steve didn't care. The only thing he cared about was comforting her, loving her. "S-Steve," she uttered into his chest. "I d-didn't…."
Toni glanced up at the smile on Peggy's face, which was nice to see. She hadn't seen the Agent smile, since Rogers went down…
Toni wasn't quite sure why the professor blamed this on her. This wasn't her invention that exploded and sprayed paint everywhere. It was one of
"I didn't think I would find you here, Miss Stark."
"Who is this he?" Rogers asked, as he eyed the two. There was something in his tone that Toni couldn't read.
Toni was practically falling asleep in the car as Steve drove the Audi back to the tower. It was a battle in and of itself to allow Steve to drive her finely tuned vehicle back, but after stumbling a few steps, she knew he was right. She was too exhausted to drive or pilot-even with JARVIS as her co-pilot. "So you ran the whole way to the cemetery?" she asked tiredly.
Toni flashed before Steve's eyes, her exhausted self haunted him. It worried—destroyed him, seeing her so broken. It scared him because at times, he didn't believe she would recover from it. Everyone saw ghosts at times, especially if they had gone through as much as she had. That wasn't strange. It would be odd if you didn't, but this was different. Though Steve may not fully understand what Toni was feeling, Barnes was real for Toni. How did Steve help with that? He was also haunted by Bucky. He had his own issues to overcome.
Putting the card back in his packet, he shook his head. "No, Miss Stark. You need it more than I do. I refuse to leave you out here without a coat."
Rogers responded with, "He told me you were insane."
"Fire Rocket," he called again as he jumped in front of her. His face was all bruised and there was a clear limp in his step, which was probably why he was still in camp and not out in the field.
"I feel special," Toni responded. "So Jones, let's see your hand." She turned the attention back to the game. Her competiveness was coming alive in her and she wanted to win this round.
For a few stupid reasons, she only visited Steve once since he 'moved'—still in denial- to DC (making him come to her), and she was a bit foggy to what his apartment looked like, not that it mattered. She disliked it anyhow. With a deep sigh, she headed toward the roof's entrance leaving her Iron Man Suit behind her as she headed inside. The heavy metal door slammed behind her, essentially locking her in unless she wanted to throw her shoulder at it, and forced her into the building. Echoing loudly with each step, she made her way down the metal stairs, toward Steve's floor. With JARVIS guiding her, she found his apartment on the end of a long narrow highway, passing a few neighbors along the way.
"No," Bucky growls. "Get your bloody hands off
He took a deep breath. "I don't know if I want you off my mind, Toni," he muttered as he laid his head on the table. Thinking about her also kept him sane as well. He didn't know if he should believe everything that Directory Nick Fury had told him, though it would be hard to disprove. Though it didn't matter if it was true, she was his focus point, his anchor.
"Mr. Stark's Will-"
Toni gave him a side look. "I'm Iron Man and you're Captain America. It doesn't help that I'm hot. He's totally telling his friends."
Toni stepped away from the mirror to a duffle, and after making sure it was packed, she headed to the door. She had to meet Peggy, but she didn't have to go too far to find her as the agent was waiting outside the room. A few feet down, Peggy, who sported a frown, was leaning against the wall.
"What time do you think Stark is in?" he asked. Worry was present in his tone as he said her name.
"What's with the look?" Barnes asked as he stepped toward her.
Barnes wasn't the type of guy she envisioned herself talking to. He was a flirt, someone to have fun with, but there was something that drew her in. It was something that she was fighting. "Do you think I should stay too?"
Howard shook his head. "No, there's nothing that my guys can't find, and they couldn't find anything about you." He paused, staring at her face. "After we let you go, I never lost track of you, always knowing where you were, which was never far from Barnes and Rogers."
And he was willing to do whatever it took, even being out in the open unlike his prior kills. With the sun beating down, the Winter Soldier, still dressed in all black, was standing out from his surroundings, granted anyone would stand out in what appeared to be an abandoned home. What was supposed to be a foreclosed house, this place was filled with activity, and the heat signatures were running all throughout the compound, confirming that someone was using this place for a base. However, there was something odd about the signatures as some were reading extremely high—too high for a normal human, though the Soldier wasn't concerned about the readings. Nothing would stop him, even if they outnumbered him, as he was on a mission to locate a certain Brunette, who had been dragged into the abandoned mansion a few hours ago. For that, everyone would die.
were fighting over her. They were best friends. She closed her eyes, trying to remember what happened. "Oh, I was sitting down in the lobby, when I fell asleep. They must've come across me. URGH!" She shook her head as she remembered Barnes kneeing beside her. "I so need to get out of here." She wondered for a second as to why he brought her back. Barnes didn't even want her here to begin with and she didn't blame him.
Pepper glanced at Bruce, holding back her own laugh. "So where is she? Tell us, JARVIS."
While the car was no longer there, Clint knew what a car accident looked like. They may clean it up—or attempted to clean it up: the car, the debris, the witness, etc., but there was no cleaning up the aftermath, the mark that was left to the surrounding area. To the normal eye, no one would notice, thinking nothing happened here; but Barton knew better. He noticed the dented tree a mile away. He noticed the snapped branches and the dishevel dirt compared to the rest of the ground. It was were overturned, revealing dirt that had not seen the sun in months. There was also the fact that the highway railing that lined the road was brand new; the cleanup crew may have tried to murk it up, but it had yet to see the years in the sun like the rest of the railing. Lastly, there were too many footprints for nothing to have happened. "Rookies," he muttered. He was following a bunch of idiots.
"Who else would it be?" he asked, his voice turning soft. His eyes were glued to her.
The genius wasn't sure if she was imaging the tone in JARVIS' voice or if it was in her head. She wasn't sure what was real or fake anymore, as she kept seeing things. This wasn't the first time that she had asked JARVIS to run full system check, thinking that the AI had missed something, and she doubted it would be the last time she asked. She wasn't sure what she was expecting with each time she asked…though it wouldn't turn out well if JARVIS found located something.
Natasha took a deep breath. "What did you say to her to upset her this much?" She narrowed her eyes at Steve.
"Drop the gun," Colonel Phillips ordered as he pointed his gun at Toni's head. He was not playing games.
"What's this?" Natasha hissed. She held her hands firmly against her ears. "Is there an intruder?"
Not even a second later, a voice echoed through the guinnjet. "I am sorry, Agent Barton and Romanoff, but I am in need of Captain Rogers."
She knew some of it had to do with Rogers as well. It was selfish to blame Rogers for it, but she did. He was part of the reason, because Howard couldn't get over his disappearance. If she had to judge by the endless rambling of her father, they had been close, which she was semi jealous of…Okay she was completely jealous of Rogers, because he had a relationship with her father that she wished she had. He had seen a side of her father that she never saw. She wished she had a close friendship with someone, which she didn't have. Sure, she was close to Pepper and Rhodey, but there were parts of her that she hadn't and wouldn't share with them. She was too ashamed to let them.
She fought the urge to look back and stared blankly at the wall.
Clint was trying not laugh and it was clear to everyone around, but after a few seconds, it busted out. He couldn't keep it in, and it turned into a laughing fit. "So… that's…what…you meant!" he chuckled at Romanoff and Banner. "Mommy and Daddy are together."
"Milking this like the punk you are, Punk," Bucky replies, gasping Steve's outreached hand and holding tightly. "I'll remember this later, Stevie."
However, Steve kept up with her easily. "Toni," he called as he stared at her face. Her facial bruise was healing, turning into a brownish color. "You know you can talk to me, right?" He let out a sigh when she didn't respond. "Remember, those nights in the apartment, when we did talked?"
Tony looks up, and he can feel his heart miss a few beats, noticing the pain in Bucky's eyes. It hurts, physically hurts, to see him like this, and Tony hates it. It makes him want to hunt down every last Hydra and rip them apart with extreme prejudice. He wants to kill them all, and he knows Steve feels the same as he stares at the Sergeant with an intense look.
"You say that, but I don't think I do," he said, as he crossed to a chair and set her down. He kneeled in front of her as his hand traveled down her leg to her ankle, carefully pulling back her pants. "With you, I always have to be concerned. Never know when you're going to blow yourself up."
Steve wanted to cry, flashing back to Toni finally telling him she loved him. "Okay." He said, forcing his Captain America mask back on. God, she had just given him an answer to his proposal. She agreed to be his wife and he had never been happier. And now it all went to hell. What the hell happen? How could he had allowed her out of his sight? "Let's go get Jasper Sitwell," he hissed. The plan was not to kill the man, but right now, Steve was so angry he didn't know if he could control himself.
? "No, I don't, but thank you." She put on a smile, trying to not snap. Someone had been watching her and she had a chance to get him.
Toni narrowed her eyes. "Honey, I can talk my way out of anything." She didn't know what it was, but her ego wouldn't let her shut up.
"You have some nerve!" she snapped interrupting him. She remembered that kiss after she had awaken from her coma. It wasn't long before she had learned of Bucky's death. "How can that kiss mean anything when you were swapping split with Peggy seconds later?"
She didn't know if she could bring herself to wear or even hold them, but she wasn't sure if she could give them back to him. She didn't know if she could part with a connection to the men. Sure, she would see Steve again, but he would be Rogers again, not her shrimp. It would be different, and she would lose the relationship that she had with him. Even now, she missed their late night conversions in his apartment where they just talked, talked about anything.
Dugan turned to him and gave him the look. "I know that look of yours and what you're planning, but you can't," he warned, taking a seat in a lone chair by a window. "She can't know she went to the past until she goes to the past. You can change everything if you go to her."
She held the folder firmly against lap as she was afraid it would disappear. She had to read it to settle her mind, but she wanted to do it alone, though she knew no one would let her.
"Want your bed back?" Bucky chuckled. During one of those checkups in the middle of the night, he had seen how uncomfortable his best friend was on the couch. At one point, Steve had taken to the floor, and Bucky didn't blame him. He had napped on that couch one time and he would never do it again.
"Wait, you're really leaving?" Toni asked as he crossed to the door.
Sharon reached for her phone, turning the screen on. She flipped to another picture before setting it directly in front of Toni's face. "Do you love him?" This photo was of Steve and Toni on his bike with her arms wrapped around him. It was older, but they had the same expression on their faces. "Do you love him?" she repeated, switching the photos. The next one was taken after a battle (Toni didn't remember which) and Steve was full on 'Captain America.' However, his eyes were focused on the Iron Man suit hovering just a few feet above the ground. Even in his mask, it was impossible to miss the smile on his face. "How does these make you feel?"
Rogers orders over the channel.
"And do you want to marry him?"
in front of the window moments before the shots were fired. Not one. Not two. At least three.
Yes, that was true, but it struck her to hear it from him. However, it made sense. She had wondered why he was nice so unexpectedly, and as she thought about it, she started to get pissed. If she ever saw him again, she was going to punch his lights out. He didn't care about her. All that flirting and comfort was a fucken lie. All of those hugs and smiles were a way to trick her.
"She must be sleeping."
Bruce rotated in the chair. "Neither are you. Do you want to talk about it?"
"Why wouldn't I? I have the voice of an angel," Toni replied.
"Fine, I'll leave. Stark, have fun being alone," he replied, as he placed his hands on her small shoulders and pushed her back softly, which Toni allowed him to do so. As he walked away, he stated, "There's food upstairs. You should eat."
Let me know what you think
Toni couldn't help but let out another laugh. "You're too cute for your own good, Cap. C'mon," she stated as she opened the door. "We can discuss a nickname for Barnes. He's jealous that I hadn't given him one, but I can't think of one. I know you call him Bucky, which is a story that I want to hear, but I want a new one. I just can't think of one."
"Then tell me. Tell me how you got that thing in your chest," he said, calmly. Even after she had snapped at him, he was just as calm as he ever was. "Tell about your life. I want to know."
Toni felt him laugh before she heard it. "You got to be careful."
"Nope," Toni smiled. He finally understood that she wasn't going to listen. "I enjoy my stubbornness."
"There's also the fact that you were found with two unknown devices. Very interesting devices I must say," Erskine stated. "It's fascinating that you would intergrade the device into your chest."
For the life of him, Rumlow couldn't understand why Pierce was so interested in Roger and Stark's relationship. Sure, it wouldn't work for their plan. For their plan to work, Stark had to be ready jump off a bridge—which they so close to that he could taste it. However, Pierce's interest was more than business. He wasn't quite sure why. "And SHIELD?" he asked.
*O*O*
The genius glances toward the warm hand on his shoulder before looking up at Rhodes' face, and he hesitates for a second before he sets down his tools. He can see the worry and concern in his best friend's eyes, and he finds it hard to tell him no. Besides, Jim knows him well, and he will call any buff that Tony tries. "And do what?" he asks, tiredly.
Clint look up from his spot on the floor. "The beginning makes me cry! You will see, Cap. You will see," he said.
She just laughed, because his pouty face was hilarious.
His tried to think of the other avengers as he tried to clear from his mind. Banner had basically locked himself in one of the many labs in Stark's Tower (Steve knew it annoyed Toni when they refer to it as the Avenger's Tower). Romanoff and Barton were off trying to trace those devices that were stolen from Black Hawk as they could have something to do with Toni's disappearance. Director Fury had some of his SHIELD Scientist and agents looking for some way to get Toni back. Each of them were coming up with nothing.
"So why don't you agree? And this can all over," he said as his fingers left the case. "You won't have to be in this time anymore. I can make the pain stop and this can be over with. No more guilt, Stark. I can save you."
Toni forced herself to take a deep breath as she closed her eyes. She tried to picture Steve, focusing on someone who loved her more than anything. "Don't listen to him. He isn't here. He isn't here. Nothing to panic over," she told herself. "It will only get you killed." After a few deep exhales, she slowly wiggled her feet out of the vines, taking great care to not move her feet in wrong away. "Steve is coming. Steve is coming."
Sam let out a chuckle. "Better be careful, Rogers. You may end up sleeping on the couch for a month."
Laying on her side, Toni tied to push herself up, but her arms could not support her. Pain shoot through her left arm, making her wonder if it was broken. "Ja.." she tried to call out. Her voice died in throat.
"Are you okay?" Steve asked. He hadn't seen Bruce drink before, because there was always a fear that he could hulk out and hurt someone. "Are you sure you should be drinking?" Though he was a super soldier, there was doubt that he could stop the big guy.
"Yes."
Her hand was trembling as she stumbled through the snow. She could feel her heart race as memories force their way forward. "Yeah, a little bit. C-can I just catch my breath for a second?" she asked, suddenly finding it hard to breath. It was like someone was sitting on her chest. It was like someone had put a bag over face that she was unable to get off.
"Bucky, you're unbelievable," Steve stated, as he glanced at Toni.
Schmidt narrowed his eyes as he crossed to a table and picked up a cube-energy pistol and pointed it at Steve. "Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule."
There was no doubt, however, that Toni still had some sense as she was the one who caused this accident and had taken off into the woods to escape her capturers. "That's my girl," he uttered as he got to his feet. Granted, Clint didn't have the best feeling, because if there was one thing Toni was not, she was not a country/wilds type of girl. She and the woods did
If she wasn't crying and scared, she would have thought Rogers' determination was cute, but she didn't want to think about that. Toni shook her head as she took a deep breath, and she allowed her mind and thoughts to overtake her.
After obtaining her device, she laid it out in front of her. She stared at it for a second, wondering. Should she do it here? Take it somewhere else? If it was anything like the last time, it would attract a lot of attention, and she couldn't allow that.
"Miss."
He stopped and turned back to her. "Scared?" he asked, jokingly.
Fury glanced at Toni, eyeing her for a few seconds, before he typed something on his phone and showed it to Steve. Toni could barely see the text from this angle, but she could read it: 'ears everywhere.' A loud chortle almost escaped her lips, having to use everything she had to keep it down. It didn't surprise Toni in the least, as it was SHIELD. Plus, it would align with what Sharon had told her. Fury liked to know what his pets were up to at all times.
Howard chuckled. "I know a lot of things like how Sark isn't your last name."
"Really?!" She couldn't believe that he admitted that. "I can handle it. Barnes taught me a few things."
And even though I have no idea why Iron Man 3 was set during Christmas, it gives me a reason to add some Christmas to this story. Oh, a Stony Christmas. How fun...
Toni felt her eye twitch. "JARVIS," she whined. "You're not supposed to let people sneak up on me. You're slipping!"
Working off muscle memory and increasing fear, Toni pushed herself and hit the release button on the suit and tumbled out. She hit the ground with a hard thump. The cold ground shocked her bit, forcing her back down to Earth. Like one of those movies, everything came rushing back at her. It was almost too much.
"Bucky," Rogers groans from the bed, as he gives him a look. "We're fine, Stark."
Toni was shaking from head to toes and struggling to keep her breath in the strong, powerful win, which kept threatening to steal her legs from under her. With each strong breeze, it felt like someone was stealing her breath and that she wouldn't be able to re-catch her breath. That nearly scared her to death, but she refused to give up, even if she wanted to. With the nonstop shivering and the difficulty breathing, the genius felt like she was seconds from fainting or something worse. It was a battle to stay on her feet, which she couldn't feel at the moment…again, not a happy feeling. She could barely feel any part of her body at the moment, which did nothing for her confidence.
Toni didn't waste any time and buried her face in his neck. "S-Steve," she cried, wrapping her arms around his chest. God, she didn't know what she would do without this man, because she was half way to crazy town, and without him, she would be in mental hospital.
He looked at her strangely. "This movie just came out. How did you see it already?" he asked. "But we can always see another movie if you like."
Her story was falling apart, and she knew he would figure out the truth soon, learned that she left Bucky and her father to die. He would hate her, and even if he didn't right away, he would hate her soon enough. "What do you what from me?" she asked, trying to hold back her tears.
He put the file down slowly as he studied her. "You're being emotional. You need to test that device before you do anything," he said.
anyone, but that just made her heart ache. He was more real than most people she had met. She would be lost without JARVIS. She knew that fact well. "Thank you," She said, tucking the card into her light hoody. "JARVIS, can you send the Iron Man suit?" she asked, turning from Sam. With her mind flipping on itself, she just wanted to get out of here. She couldn't take the look in his knowing eyes anymore.
"I don't know, and that may be the problem." Bruce shook his head. There was no real way for them to know what time she was transported back to, and he knew that would be a major issue. How could they save her if they had no idea of where to save her from?
"You seem to know him well," Peggy said, stepping into the room. Her heels tapped lightly with each step.
Sorry, no Toni in this chapter, but she'll be back in the next chapter, though she won't be a happy camper (not that she was to begin with).
Sam chuckles as he takes a seat on the beanbag. "Plus, I don't want to be saving New York from T-rexes. I don't think my insurance covers dino bites."
So you may or may not see all of the fun stuff that I intend for the next chapter.
"Isn't that admitting it?" Howard asked, stepping toward with his eyes trained on her. "And who's Fury?"
. It was unnerving to say the least, and this was Toni talking. Natasha, on the other hand, was showing all kind of emotions—though in her own way. That woman wasn't thrown off her game often.
"Yes," Toni responded as they started to walk. "Think about it!" She smiled, weakly. "And don't be so down on yourself." She took a deep breath but she didn't want to reveal too much.
Peggy raised her eyebrow. "Are you under the impression that you are the 'beast'?"
"Just take my deal and we can be off."
Clint took a step forward. "That would be wise," he said with a chuckle. "Rogers doesn't seem like the type to share."
she told herself. She kept flinching every time she saw movement, which could be attributed to a few things and not her stalker.
Toni followed behind Barnes directing him. "Shouldn't be much farther," she told him in hush tones. She was hearing fast moving foots steps, which seemed to be getting closer. They must be running toward the fighting, she thought as she heard something explode in the distance.
"The Mark 7 is currently in route. Colonel Rhodes has been safety ejected from the suit."
He glanced back at the Black Widow, glaring at the broken helmet. He didn't know why he took such an offense to it, but he wanted to blow it up. He wanted to toss it as far as he could, never wanting to see it again…well unless Toni was here with her suit.
"I'm taking you back to Malibu. Right now!" Pepper replied, coldly, pointing to make her point. Without another word, she moved to the closet and pulled out a suitcase.
After the Soldier made it to the streets, it didn't take long to locate the brunette in the crowd of people. She stuck out from the rest, as even though it was cold outside, most of the crowd was wearing skin tight shirts and short skirts besides his brunette. She was wearing a hoodie that looked a size or two too large for her with a pair of black work out pants that hugged her body just right. Her shoes made a different sound from everything else as they made contract with the ground, and it called to him.
Jim's silent for a few seconds, eyeing the expression on Tony's face. "Don't worry, Tones. I'll be your guard dog upstairs. Those Super Soldiers won't get pass me." There's a protective look on his face. "I'll blast them, and I think Ms. Skynet will assist me with that."
"When was the last time you slept?" he asked.
"You gave her a black eye."
"Take me back to the house," she croaked, tears running down her face. Everything was becoming too much for her.
"I'm sorry, isn't everything?" Steve said, thinking back to her flirting with Thor and Banner.
Natasha rolled her eyes. "We need contact Director Fury."
"Miss."
Unable to take this anymore, Steve interrupted the Colonel as he ranted. "I
He didn't need anyone to tell him that she hadn't slept in days, because he could see it, feeling it. She couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag in her current state. He also knew that he wouldn't be able to get through to her until she slept. In a sleep derived sleep haze, she wouldn't be able to listen to reason. Being awake for days, it was like she was drunk, and she was unable to think clearly, logically. "Let's get you to bed."
"It would be," he smiled back. He reached a little over her shoulder at his height now and it was weird to look down at him, because in her time, he was the one that had to look down. "I'm not surprise you can't remember," he stated. "When I found you, you were a mess. There had been a big gash and blood on your face."
Toni knew she was angry, and she
"Steve!" Bruce yelled as he crossed toward the bar in a hurry.
The Asset was sure he was going to be punished as he was not obeying his handers when they ordered him away from the Brunette, from
Steve let out a chuckle as he just let her ramble on for a few long minutes. Zombies was never his favorite fiction, always preferring the novel with a hero. A story with a strong hero saving the world from certain death. A race again time story; however, he enjoyed listening to her funny rants as her face was lit like a Christmas tree. Her smile almost took up her face as she went off on the Zombie apocalypse. She was certain she would survive, and she was probably right. The smugness on her face was cute and he could just stare at her all day, but that would not solve anything.
Steve took a deep breath as he turned away from the window. "The devices stolen from Black Hawk were there but they were moved. We missed them by an hour or so, but the mission wasn't total waste. We did find something." Knowing that it would not get him drunk, he stepped to the bar. "Do you really think these devices can help?"
Peggy took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," she stated. "Sometimes my minds wander."
"If your goal is just to annoy me, it's working," Toni replied, watching him. Even with her genius mind, she couldn't figure out his game plan. Yes, she knew he wanted out of his cell and he wanted the throne, but what did any of that had to do with her? Did he think he could use her to get Earth?
Toni laughed it off. "All jokes."
"Stark, open up," Rogers demanded. Though she would deny it, she liked how he said her name.
"The Colonel is currently in a combat mode. Removal of access now would-"
Side note: When do you you think Doctor Strange started? Meaning, the events of the movie had to take over years, right? In my head, I was thinking 3 years? Because he got into a car crash then he had many many (I think the Movie said 7) Surgeries, and then started his magic training. So, the Surgeries long had to take more than a year because he had to heal after each time? See this is what I overthink on. hahaha
Peggy looked at her as if she was crazy. "Do you not recognize the streets of New York?"
"Because I'm not in love with Toni. I care for her deeply, just not in love," Banner explained.
*O*O*
There was no doubt the pain medication had worn off as Toni was in some serious pain, but she got to thinking. Would it be a good idea to take meds from these people, who thought she was a spy? They could make her loopy and there was no telling what they could get out of her if that happened. "No, I'm good," she stated, eyeing him. "I won't tell you anything."
The Asset jerked in his chair, but there was no give. He was a tool, but he refused to let her be a tool. She was so much more than that. So much more.
Ignoring her gut, she took a step toward the man as she tried to get a better look at his face. She just needed to as there was no possible way that this was James Barnes, but they had the same stance, the same poise, and she had to see his face for herself. To make matters worse, it was difficult to see his face as his long hair covered his face. "Barnes?" she uttered, stepping forward again. She blamed her nightmares, making her see the Sergeant everywhere.
"Not so fast, Pierce would like to have a word with you as well," Rumlow adds. "It seems Iron Man was spotted in an Alley fight and caused some damage."
Toni's eyes snapped open as she glanced up at the newcomer. In the darken park, she wasn't able to make out his face, but somehow, he looked familiar to her. She just couldn't place where she had seen his face before, but she knew him from somewhere. Even his voice was familiar. "What?" she uttered, looking at his out stretched arm.
Before he could reach and pull her into his arms, Toni stepped out of his reach, though regretting it a second later. She could see the hurt look in his eyes as his hand hovered near her, and it only made her feel worse. "Sorry."
"Is this about how you think the Avengers are a National Security risk and you need a way to take each one of us down if needed?" Clint injected, bitterly with his armed folded across his chest.
Barnes pulled away a second later. "I don't care about your past. I don't care you have been with or who you haven't. I don't care about anything. I just want you."
The word cute came to her mind when she thought about Rogers. She couldn't understand how he could be so innocent when he was who he was. Sure, he wasn't the Famous Captain yet and he hadn't faced any traumatic experiences yet, but he was like this in the future as well. Though she couldn't be sure, she believed it wasn't because of the time he grew up in. "How did you come up with the nickname Bucky?" That a part that she was curious about and she would like to hear that story.
Steve closed his eyes. Bruce was correct; she was hard to read, even if he could tell when she was nervous or scared (though she would never admit she was). If he had to guess using all of those insults, she wouldn't return this feelings; however, with Toni, logic meant nothing. With her, insults were a sign of affection.
"I can't believe I rushed him off that phone call. How could I? I was so stupid. So cold." She buried her face in his chest, trying to hide from the world.
The room broke out in laugher as the tissue and wrapping paper went everywhere—not that it wasn't everywhere already. However, it was now down her shirt, in her hair and in her mouth. IT WAS IN HER bra. She was pretty sure it was in her pants. Yes, her pants, but no one was looking own there. For a few long seconds, she just blinked as she didn't believe what had just happened, even as if itching.
Toni was unable to finish as Steve cut her off with a kiss. This kiss was deeper than the last, and it stole her breath, which shouldn't be allowed. He shouldn't be allowed to do with to her, leave her speechless. It wasn't fair. It wasn't fair at all.
"Steve, relax," Barnes said, eyeing Toni. Even if he was trying to calm Steve down, Barnes was giving her the look.
The Colonel let out a sigh. "You're impossible. Just like your father."
Steve knew Toni had gotten herself into situations before- almost killing herself a few times, but for some reason, this time felt different. Maybe, it had to do with the fact that this was the first time it happened since they had gotten together, but either way or reason, the Captain didn't like it. Didn't like at all. "Does this seem normal?" he asked, picking up a melted piece of metal. "This was not cause by the Iron Man suit."
Toni could only look on as the nurse needled in the sedate. Almost instantly, she could feel the drug, but she didn't stop fighting. She couldn't stop, not with her nightmares. Being pushed to her death by Barnes shook her to the core, and there was nothing she could do to erase the look on Barnes' face. That anger scared Toni, because people had been known to do terrifying things when they were frightened.
"You got it bad, Stark," she told herself as she hid the flask back in the desk. She glanced at Pepper's assistant, making sure the tattletale hadn't seen her drink it. The older, precise woman had been keeping a close eye on the Acting-CEO, making sure Toni behaved, which was an impossible task; however, she was doing a decent hob, following Pepper's every order. That woman had thought of everything, refusing to let Toni off the chain even when she wasn't there.
"So you're saying that you found me in Camp Lehigh alone?" Toni asked, trying to make sense of what was going on in her head. No, that didn't make sense because she remembered the men in uniform. She remembered the strange man with the silver sleeve…Or…maybe, it was all in her head. She was half away out of it when she came too.
"Were you?" Toni asked. "I wasn't paying attention."
But here you. I hope you like it. :) and thanks to my Beta who proofed this for me.
Both Howard and Phillips' eyes widened at the words sex and kinky as if a woman did not say those things. Peggy let out a sigh. "Okay," she said slowly. "She's definitely your child."
Steve put a hand on her shoulder, stopping her before she could say anything stupid. "She isn't an asset, and Fury would be stupid to think of her as one," he said, coldly. "Why don't you three go to the quinnjet? I need a moment with Toni."
"I'm sorry." He said with his hands in his pocket.
Phillips put down the photo. "I have no doubt you could talk circles around most man and could outsmart almost anyone, but there are few areas that you cannot beat a man in." He leaned back and studied her.
She let out a sigh before she took the coat. She wasn't interested in playing the 'I like to be handed things,' as she just wanted them to leave her alone. "I know I'm hot, but you don't need to fall over your feet for me," she said as she fanned herself with her free hand.
"Hey!" Toni protested, loudly, as Barton, spotting a hard look, appeared behind the genius.
Shadow of the Past
For a split second, she allowed herself to be engulfed in his arms, his smell, his everything. She had forgotten how comforting this man was, how much she depended on his friendship, even if she never admitted it to anyone. This man understood her in ways that no one else did, and he wasn't one to lecture her, though he did address things with her whenever something upset him. "Bruce," she replied, with a deep breath.
"Does it matter? Do you really think they're going to give Captain American a ticket?" he asked, as they pulled into Avenger's Tower.
"You better," Rhodes replied. "And when you two finally hook up, make sure to reframe Toni from referring to it as getting a slice of apple pie." Everyone looked at him on that. "I
She glared. "You're just jealous. Besides I don't need help falling on my ass." She paused. "I do that enough on my own."
*O*O*
Barnes laughed again. "Do you want to take a walk with me?" he asked, changing the subject.
Oh, hell no, did he just say that?! Who the hell did this think this man was? Stepping away from the window, she turned to Fury and shoot him the dirtiest glare. She, not caring if Steve was staring at her, was going to kill Fury herself. "And you're just horrible. No wonder your wife left you."
"Toni. I'm not leaving you."
"You got her to come out?" Pepper asked shocked.
Toni's eyes twitched as he smiled. His smile made her want to hit him and she might, as she spotted a familiar wrench on the table. "You're pushing it, Stark," she said. She eyed him with a deadly glare. "I don't want to end up back in a prison cell, so shut it."
," she wailed. "I thought you would be happy to see me!" She pretended to be hurt, playfully pouting. "Granted, I expected you to throw a party. I'm pretty sad you didn't."
She raised her eye brow and again, she cursed in her mind. She really didn't belong in this time period, and she would go crazy if she stayed here for too long. "Because I'm awesome."
The Agent shook her head. "Never mind."
Howard was still eyeing her. "So if you get knocked on your ass, I can make fun of you?" he teased.
"Peggy, that's not what you thought it was." Rogers stated as Peggy and he burst into the room.
Toni snorted. "And the U.S. is too cheap for that." Both Howard and Rogers both turned and glared. "What?" She stated, trying to play innocent. She put on a big smile.
"You don't remember?" Maya asked, though she knew Toni was lying. However, her eyes were still glued to the tags.
(See the end of the chapter for
The genius turned back slightly and looked at Peggy over her shoulder. "And Salty doesn't like his, but I still call him that." She put on a big smile. "Besides, we can't like everything." She could see Peggy's eye twitch, and it was hard to hold back her laugher.
Phillips glanced at her and eyed Toni's bruise for a few second as if he found it insulting. "I want every ally looking for that main Hydra base."
If Toni didn't know better, she would've thought JARVIS was ecstatic to see her. "Geez, JARVIS. It sounds like you missed me. Was life unbearable without me? I don't doubt it. The rest of the Avengers don't know how to party. They had my whole tower all to themselves and they probably didn't even throw one party, did they?"
The sun was peaking over the hills and cliffs and casting a soft light in the room. "I…I can't sleep," she spoke, softly.
She shook her head as she glanced up at him. "Trust me, I'm really. Can't wait to get your smell off me."
He glanced back toward Pepper before pushing himself up. "Yes, Ma'am," he said with a weak smile. He could understand why Toni kept Pepper around, even if she was a bit controlling. Pepper was a kind soul, who took care of Toni and many others without a second thought.
"NO," she said, interrupting him. "Are you really going to say Steve should be here instead of saving the world?" she snapped. That surprised the genius as she would've thought that Rhodes, being a soldier, would placing saving the world above her.
She took a look around the room, trying to see if there was anything that could record their conversion. She didn't want to anyone to know what she was going to say. Seeing nothing, she turned to him. "My last name is not Sark."
Steve took a deep breath as he crossed to the bed and sat down; he remembered the first time that he met Toni. He wasn't referring to the time in Germany, when they were fighting Loki; no, he was referring to the time in the empty lot. It was when he didn't know about superheroes, magical items, or aliens. Those were the days that everything had made sense. Though finding Toni in that field did not make sense, he knew what to do and what not to do, well besides falling in in love with Toni, who seemed to hate him. She seemed to like Bucky, who didn't trust or like her, and that just annoyed the hell out of him. He cared for Toni, not Bucky. She should've liked him, not Bucky… Well, she did like him before he came Captain America, but after that, she looked at him differently, and Steve could guess why. Bruce was right: he was an ass.
"I'm changing my answer," Howard said loudly. "She's my daughter. That's why."
Exhaling slowly, Toni, who was in the tent that she shared with Peggy, pushed herself up into a sitting position on the cot. She glanced at Peggy's cot, which vacant and neat. For as long as Toni knew Peggy, she was immaculate and never had a hair out of place, and it made sense that she would be that way now.
The Colonel stood up and crossed to the window. Unlike the last time they talked, they were in a small office that had a window facing the outside. "In order to keep an eye on you, I need you close and this is how I'm going to do so." He turned back to her with a smile. "It means you have to listen to me."
Toni didn't know what was worse: this boy's nonstop mouth, or the way that he was looking at her. "Maybe. Can you stop?!" She could feel
"Toni," Steve uttered with a deep sigh.
With the bag in her hand, Toni, still in the fugly nurse Uniform, walked down the streets heading toward the location of Stark Industries. She did her best to ignore the cold that was nipping at her and the fact that after she stole her device back there was nowhere she could go. She had no money or resources; what was she supposed to do? Toni wasn't sure, but she knew what the first thing she had to do: she had to get the device. After that, she wasn't sure.
"Good," she said, as she stepped toward the center of the camp. She wanted time alone before she got blasted with questions that she couldn't answer. "Give me a heads up when they're a minute out."
*O*O*
"Your master is not my concern nor is he my superior," the Commander replied. "I do not care what he wants or thinks." Her accent was heavy and it almost enough to drown out the meaning of her words.
"Yea, what's that?" Toni asked, eye brow raised. Peggy was up to something and it couldn't be good. She folded her arms across her chest and eyed Peggy. Maybe, her glare could get it out of her.
"And too busy to assist us, apparently," Rogers stated, bitterly.
"You two know each other?" Steve asked, his eyes narrowing at Rumlow. His tone changed slightly as he took in the Rumlow stance.
She narrowed her eyes. "You can only think you can. I'm not mad." Okay, she was annoyed, but she wasn't going to tell him that. If he didn't want to talk to her, he didn't have to; she wasn't going to force him like she wanted to.
"Wait what?" Clint asked, shocked.
"What does that mean?" she snapped.
"Fine," he muttered, softly. His mind was on Toni and how exhausted she looked when he left her. He hated that he had to leave her, and it was a battle to leave her alone—Yes, Bruce was there, but he didn't count… well not to Steve. The only person who counted was him, and as soon as he could, he would be at her side. There would be no stopping him.
He really was naïve, wasn't he? Or was it just this time? She would give him the benefit of the time for now. "If I didn't already think you were a murderer, I do now," she laughed.
time, Rogers," Phillips stated, his voice firm, hard. "She was close to Sergeant Barnes."
Why was she pushing her toward Barnes to hard? "Just forget it then." She put on a large smile as she picked up her speed.
Steve let out an angry huff as he was tired of her making fun of his outfit, even if this technically was the first time for her. However, her jokes and insults were wearing thin his patience. He wasn't sure what was worse her immaturity or her lack of caring for others.
She glanced down at her cold, frozen feet before she glanced up at the light which was taunting her. It flicked, remaining dark a second later than it was light. "Maybe, I should've stayed in bed," she muttered. Her body was sore and her throat still ached. "Too weak to leave…" She glanced down at her shaky hands. "Too dangerous as well." There seemed to be a line of people after her.
"And how will you explain it, Steve? How will you walk into her life? She won't know you. Plus, she isn't the same person you met in the past yet. Trust me on that. Trust me."
"Your throat hurts because they just took a feeding tube out. You have been out for a few days," Loki explained.
"I told him he wasn't a god," she answered.
"Just as long as I get to go home," she replied, realizing that she kept saying home. Before the avengers, she never thought she would consider any place home. "And away from you people."
Letting out sigh, Toni replied, "You're crazy."
"Here." The nurse stated, trying to hand Toni the glass.
Hearing her comment, Rogers looked like someone kicked his puppy. "I don't mean to intrude, but I can't believe such a beautiful dame like yourself don't have anyone to turn to." His face was flushed as he spoke.
"I won't."
Though her fear of water wasn't as bad, it still seemed to haunt her.
"You're exhausting," he replied, rubbing his face.
*O*O*
Clint's eyes brow. "Gossips sites?"
Toni smiled and chuckled. "Well, when you get blasted on your ass, I'll be right where I'm needed to laugh at you."
I hope you enjoy this. I again was struggling with making her feel guilty and but keeping her witty. Tell me what you think.
"Yes, we will, and you'll take care of us," Bucky says, breathing into his ear. "I want to feel your mouth on my cock."
"I just want to know what that device does in your chest." He paused and looked at Zola. "He believes it would be fatal to remove it." He turned back her. He stared at her as she glared. "You're quite interesting I must say."
Toni couldn't look away, glued in Sharon's stare. "I don't wa-"
He kissed the bone for a few second, making her skin red, before he broke away and glanced up at her face. "Sure, Doll Face," he said, his voice heavy and thin. There was a look in his eyes that went straight through her, and it took every she had not break down right there and beg for him to fuck her—not that she would have to wait long.
Steve got up slightly, just enough to place a claiming kiss to
Jim let out a groan before he could stop himself. "I don't want to hear these things," he said, as the mood suddenly changed. "I will never unhear that." He moaned as he closed his eye, trying to block her out.
"I'm fine, Peg," she replied. "Let's just do this. We'll need an isolated spot in case this reacts like it did the last time."
"Why don't you go rest?" She replied. "Maybe, your dream self is better at talking to the ladies."
"This is true but it was only enough to get me here, but to get you home, you need to sweeten the deal."
"The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube," Toni said, drawing him out of his thoughts.
"No, I'm stupid," he says, softly.
Jones gave Dugan a look. "Hey, I found a beautiful woman and started an amazing family. Just look at my grandson for one. I don't see you with any grandchildren."
She glared at the tool, which she could only image had been used on quite a few people. She had no idea what that device was possibly used for, but she knew whatever it was used for that it wasn't going to be pretty. "I never knew you liked my voice," she said, trying to keep up her brave front. "Your crush is getting out of control."
He, suddenly, had the urge to hide the drive, though he wasn't sure if he was reading too much into things, but he was glad he did, considering he was being led off by an armed Strike force. Or maybe, he was just reading too much into this. Maybe, it was seeing Fury dead that threw him, but no! Something wasn't right. He was being led to his death. "Where's Toni?" he asked, not liking the idea that of being away from her. After she told him everything, the idea of being separated from her felt like hell, especially when things were hitting the shitter.
So maybe, it was all in her head? Maybe, JARVIS was right—because let's face it, he hardly ever was wrong-, but that
"You have no idea of how special she is," Schmidt said, his eyes drilling into her.
"Boss, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are requesting to communicate with you on a private channel," FRIDAY announces a moment later.
Steve was now located with Bruce down in the lab, where he was pretty much useless, but he had to do something as he would go crazy if he didn't. He was Captain America and he refused to stand on the sideline and do nothing. However, at this moment in time, he was pacing…which was doing nothing besides burning a hole in the floor.
He couldn't keep his eyes off her and the iron man suit. Her body was incased in the suit, and he was completely unable to make out her form in the bulky suit. He could only see her pale face and messy hair that was sticking out everywhere. However, even with helmet hair, she was still beautiful in his eyes, and he couldn't see himself with anyone else. "I don't remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop."
Bruce stared at him for a few seconds before standing up and walking over to him. "How is this your fault? You didn't lock her in the lab and force her to work on that Device. You have no idea of what could've happen."
Toni could feel the warm tears drip down her cheeks, as she took off. Instead of running away from assassin, she was running from Barnes, a ghost of man who Toni cared very deeply for. A man that had been a friend when she had none. With his overwhelming hatred, she didn't know how to cope. She didn't know if she could keep going with that his wrathful face haunting and hunting her. This was when she needed Steve to ground her, to keep her sane. At this point, the ghost was going to beat her and there was nothing she could do.
*O*O*
"I'm unsure of the time, but I'm positive that she's in the past." Bruce stared at his glass before taking another slip.
She was holding back the tears as she reached her breaking point. There wasn't anything else that she could do but sit there, and it was that realization that hit hard. There was some part of her that thought this was her fault, and there was another part of her that thought she deserved this. She let Barnes die without even trying to save him. What kind of person did that? A selfish person. There was no denying that she was a selfish person not caring about anyone else.
"Yes, and the items taken were specifically designed to take down Toni Stark and the Iron Man Suit," he stated with no shame. "And this is why I think these two things are related."
"Yes," Peggy asked without hesitation. "You're good actress."
Next on this supposed team was the god—well, the not-really-god who was more alien than a deity. Toni didn't know what she thought of Thor, the man she barely had two lone conversions with. They rarely talked besides what was necessary, though she wasn't sure who fault that was: his or hers. Maybe, her meaningless flirting was too much for him? Maybe, it was her ego? Toni wasn't sure, but she wasn't going to push it. He was off somewhere, doing something, and Toni had no idea of where or what, not that she really cared to find out. If Thor wanted her or anyone else to know, he would tell her, and she wasn't going to bug him for it.
The woman turned to him with a surprise expression. "Rogers?"
"So how are you here?" she asked, eyeing the god who was only a shadow of his former self. He wasn't the one to help without a reason, and she doubted it was to help her. Sure, she was sexy as hell and could get any man to drool at her feet, but she doubted Loki really wanted to drool at her feet and woo her. Seriously, what was his reason?
The Private hobbled behind her; his left eye was slowly turning black. "She doesn't need you," he teased.
"Yes, it is possible."
It annoyed her that he wasn't taking this seriously, that he wasn't taking her seriously. "Why are you following me?" she asked.
"Yes, Miss."
"I'm fine," he utters.
The music stopped, but it didn't remain silent. An earsplitting alarm sounded through the whole tower. Blinking yellow lights, which came out of nowhere, lit up the whole room.
him living in DC. Hate it. Now, I don't want him glue to my side every second. I would probably kick him out a window." She wanted her space, but man, she wanted to go upstairs and see him.
"I don't like that you know these things," she said, giving him one of her famous looks.
"To make up for beating you in poker, I thought we would all go out for drinks, well unless you're too classy for that," he said.
"This is it," Rogers announced as they came across a door at the end of the hallway.
According to the letter, Howard always carried the second photo with him, but so it had to be here. Maybe, it was in the bigger envelope; however, the only thing in that envelope was the journal that she had kept in the past. At first, she was ready to toss it, because it was a bad remainder of the past that she wanted to forget. However, just as she was about to toss it, she noticed her father's notes. Quickly flipping through the pages, she noticed he had written something on each page. Only scanning the notes, she could tell that they ranged from suggestions on her tech to little stories that he wanted her to know. Again, Toni found herself struggling to breathe. "Geez, Father. Still putting me to shame," she said, scanning over a note.
However, seeing Peggy pull Steve back and give him a kiss wasn't what Toni was looking for, and she would not admit it that she felt relieved when Steve pulled away quickly. Why did Peggy think it was necessary to kiss him? Was she afraid that Steve wasn't coming back? There were some doubt in Toni's mind, but she wasn't going to think about that. She was going to be her cocky self, who believed in the awesome power of herself.
"But why?! After everything? After…Bucky?" she asked, tearing up. "I let your best friend die, when I could've stop it all, but I didn't. So how can you say that? How can anyone say that isn't my fault?"
"Steve."
*O*O*
Schmidt smiled as they came within a few feet of each other. "I see."
"Toni likes to blow minds," he stated fondly.
Natasha nodded as she pushed off the wall. She didn't say much at first, only staring at the stilled genius in Steve's arms. Toni was gone to the world at the moment, but it was transparent that her sleep was anything but peaceful. She was covered in sweat and was shivering. "She'll be wearing a mask in the morning. Are you ready for that fight?" she asked.
It came at her all at once and she couldn't think without getting an extreme headache. There also seemed to be a raise in temperature, making Toni sweat. To make matters worse, she wasn't able to catch her breaths no matter how hard she tried. It felt like there was something or someone sitting on her chest, not allowing her to. With everything adding on, Toni's head felt like it was in a fog and she wasn't able to think clearly. However, there was one thing that she could make out: she was scared.
Dugan laughed as he turned to the door. "I'll be back." Toni didn't fight him.
Hey, all. I am sorry that I took so long. Here you go. I hope you enjoy.
"Scared of what?"
Before he could finish his sentence, Toni snapped and slugged him in the face. Not expecting that, the private fell back. "Do I punch like a man too?" she retorted, as she tried not to wink in pain. His face was boney and it hurt. "Is that why you want me? Because you're really a woman and someone needs to wear the pants."
Toni glanced at him before pulling up Rhodes' number. "Shut up," she begged, tears running down her painted covered face. "Please. Just shut up." Her throat was closing up.
Taking a deep breath, Toni tried to calm herself down. She needed to think rationally and getting pissed wouldn't help her. "What do you want from me?" she asked.
Before Toni could react, Barnes rushed forward, grabbed her hand, and twisted it, disarming her. She stumbled back, landing on her ass. "Can you now?" he asked as he trained the gun on her.
"What? It can't be a good sign that she hasn't given him an answer," Barton replied, fire off another arrow. "I am just trying to be helpful."
He made a face at the sound of his last name. "I had enough beauty sleep, and I'm glad Peg woke me. Didn't want to you to leave without saying goodbye."
Toni watched as he walked away and disappeared into the crowd. She took a look around, as she had no idea what was going on, and she didn't like it. Sure, she recognized some of these guys from camp, but that didn't mean she knew what was going on. They appeared to be stopped somewhere in the wilds, nowhere near camp.
She had woken up the next two mornings with tears running down her cheeks. Her hand went to her throat, and after talking a few deep breaths, she was able to convince herself that she was fine. She closed her eyes and told herself that everything was fine and she was safe.
With shoulders slumped, Toni walked away from him to one of the tables in the room. Sighing, she placed her hands on the table and leaned against it. "What do you think's going on here, Rogers?" she asked, her voice soft but cold.
Toni eyed his hand for a second before looking away in a huff. The early sun had come out, casting a light yellow upon them. There was a cool breeze in the air, provide a relief to those running. To her, it gave her the goosebumps. The park was peacefully quiet, as these early hours provided a clear pathway for runners. "Ah, what a boring name. I expected something more," she said, gesturing into the air.
But yet, her father was standing in front of her just like Bucky had been. The room was spinning as she stared at her father, who stood mere feet from her. "This isn't real. This isn't real." Her lungs refused to work as she struggled to breath. She could barely feel her nails against her chest as she pulled at her shirt. "No. No. No."
"No, I don't," She teased.
Steve stood suddenly. "Easy for you to say. You weren't there," he replied quietly and coldly, as he flexed his hands. "I think it's best if I leave before she returns."
Turning her attention to the window, she stared out. "Of course, it would start snowing. If there's a God, he hates me, a lot," she sighed. Taking a long slow breath, she thought. After a few minutes of silence, she crossed to the front door. "I should give this back," she stated, taking off Rogers' warm coat. "I should probably put more clothes on, though."
Drifting off again, Steve couldn't help but notice the glow in her eyes. She wasn't smiling like she was a few seconds ago, but he could tell she was in her element. He couldn't help but stare as she looked absolutely beautiful. To him, she was already breathtaking even with stupid jokes. "Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?" he said, barely recalling saying it.
Unable to look at the details, he flipped to another file which was of Colonel Phillips- also deceased. It was a blow to his heart to see so many of his comrades dead. Again unable to look, he flipped to see Peggy and to his joy, she was still alive and living in England. There was a number listed for her, and for a second, he wanted to call her, but he couldn't do that to her. She had gotten over his death and he was going to allow her that peace.
Jones wobbled to his feet as he stepped to Toni. "We can talk about if you like?"
her! "Fuck," he said, slamming his fist down onto the table, which didn't stand a chance. It split into several pieces under his straight, crashing loudly to the ground.
"No, i-it isn't, Steve." She asked, her voice was cracking. Almost breaking. "No, it isn't."
Howard glanced back with a cheesy smile. He let go of the controls and tapped on the glass. "We're safe behind this," he replied as he tapped again. "Why don't you come closer? I would like a second opinion."
"What?" Toni asked shocked. She reached for the bag to find her muddy and holy clothes that she had been wearing when she first arrived. Her cell phone, to her surprise, was also in the bag. I wasn't expecting to see this again, she thought. Her unnamed device was not in the bag, which pissed her off. "Why are you letting me go? And where is my device?"
He was correct; she was in pain, but she wasn't going to take them. She had experience worse pain before and this time was nothing like that. She had experience waterboarding, which was something she didn't want to relive. However, her mind liked to drift to that feeling of drowning, to that feeling of no control. She shook her head. This pain was just annoying and she could deal with. "I'm good," she grumbled.
After hiding the flash drive, Steve allowed himself to be dragged off by Rumlow and the Strike team. Dragged might be too strong of a world but that was what it felt like to the Captain. It didn't feel like he had a choice, and he didn't have a choice. Rumlow—though he would fail—would have dragged him in. There was a reason why he and the rest of the gang was in combat gear, and considering they were collecting him, that didn't bode well. What did that mean?
Steve was the first to move. "Is the floor steady?" he asked, unsure of his steps. "The floor is not going to cave in, is it?"
She wanted to yell at herself for even allowing herself to think like that. She wasn't sure why she was still feeling like this, considering the weight lifted off her chest when she told Steve. She could breathe again, but here she was, still feeling like crap.
Tony wonders if he should've stayed away. It would've been easier. "Is that anything different?" he asks.
As he watched them, there were a few ways that he could kill them from his height and position. He could kill hundreds of them in a number of ways before anyone realized what was happening. He could shot them each in the head before they realized what happened. They would be bleeding in the streets before anyone could stop him—not that anyone could. He was an unstoppable weapon. No one could-
relationship. He was the first guy who had ever made her feel like she was worth something besides a roll in the sack. She had 'relationships' or what some call one-night stands. She had whatever she had with Ezekiel and Tiberius—that one Howard hated with everything he had. Man, if eyes could kill. Her father was oddly overprotected over her, but he really didn't like Tiberius. Maybe, seeing his future time traveling daughter did that to a man? Looking back, he had a point. Anyhow, she could contest that she never had a real relationship, and maybe, she couldn't say those the words because she didn't know if
Natasha took a step forward. "What do you mean she's not in there?"
"Rollins," the first one snapped. "I don't care. Just get him out of here."
Toni could feel his hold on her tighten. "You sound horrible," Rogers responded.
*O*O*
"Colonel Phillips," Rogers stated as he busted in.
"You just called me dad without it being a joke," he uttered, completely shocked.
Toni leaned back in her chair, itching to reach for her flask. As the urge to drink grew, the promise to her father started to slip. She wondered if the shaking in her hand was noticeable. She hoped not. "You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a…I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air."
"This isn't good," she stated. Her throat felt worse than before; she should've just shut-up. "Urgh," she muttered, pulling at the handcuffed. Maybe, she could pick it like she did before when one of her dates left her handcuffed to the bed. It took her a few hours, but she was able to escape. She could have sworn JARVIS was laughing at her that night.
*O*O*
She suddenly got pissed at him. She never expected him to get sexist on her. "Geez, Rogers," she stated. He frowned at the use of his last name. "You would rather get beat up, almost die, just to save your manhood? I'm not good enough to save you?" She paused as she tried to calm herself, but she failed. "I didn't think you were a chauvinist pig." She stated as she stormed off, not waiting for him to response. He reminded her too much of the future Captain which she didn't like.
"We aren't engaged," Toni said randomly as she poked her eggs.
Rhodes smiled slightly as he looked at her. "We're just worried about you."
"That's way cooler!"
And Again, I hoped you liked it! Hint hint. You can tell me how you feel in the reviews. Reviews are like candy that keep me going and writing move. This story has been a ride, and I hoped it wasn't too boring. I hoped you had fun reading this. I know i enjoyed writing it.
"Yes and yes," he replied as he turned from the table to a suitcase by the door. Toni watched as he picked up the case and brought it back to the table. Her eyes drifted down to the suitcase as he opened it and took out a few blue prints. "I had a few ideas. Sure, I haven't gotten a good look at the device in a while, but I think this will work," he said as he laid the plans out in front of her.
fall in love. Love is for children. It's a fairy tale that they tell in order to sell shit.
Toni didn't know how Harley did it, but the boy talked her down…Maybe, it was due to his innocence and/or his inability to see anything wrong with her, but he did something. Sure, the boy had rose colored glasses when it came to the genius, but he didn't judge her like. He believed in her, even if she didn't deserve it or believe in herself, and she didn't know how to handle that. Granted, she didn't know how to handle a lot of things, but right, she was trying. Yet, it felt like she had to reprogram herself at times, like old computers, which was harder than she expected.
"Okay, let's see." Toni challenged as she raised her glass. "This should be fun."
Lacing another special arrow, Barton fired again. His eyes still trained on the flaming ex-soldiers. "I'm awesome, Cap. I can gloat and fire at the same time, unlike some people." He paused for a second before adding, "And if Stark can do it, so can I. No special treatment here unlike certain people. Do I need to sleep with you to get special treat-"
break.
Natasha was always good at hiding her emotions, though she had been letting them out more often. It was nice to have a small window into her soul, but it was shut firmly right now. "SHIELD."
THE END
At first, Toni just watched in disbelief as this was what she had been trying to do; she wanted them together but after that kiss Rogers and her shared, it was a blow to the heart, a heart that was already broken. Was why he kissing her back like that? Did their kiss earlier mean nothing? It took Toni less than two seconds to remind herself that it didn't. He just kissed her because he was hurt and he just needed comfort like she did. Nothing else. Why did she care? She didn't want anything else with him as she didn't do relationships.
Toni glanced up at him. "Going where?" she asked, eyeing him.
Rhodes' surprise was still present on his face as he spoke, "Toni's here? Where is she? In the lab?"
"Let me go," she begged. If she didn't get away from him now, they would take her and there would be no end. If she wasn't saved, she knew she would cave and tell him everything.
"What do you think?" the Captain asked, not responding to Toni who was now sporting a playful frown.
However, this exhaustion wasn't doing her any good, any justice. Images kept flashing in her head, and in her tired state, she was unable to keep them back. Plus, she couldn't sort what was real or fake. Did she really see what she thought she saw? A dead guy? She knew the answer had to be no, because this was not the 'Walking Dead' or any other Zombie show, and the dead didn't come back to life…However, she shouldn't say
"Where's Rogers?" If she timed this right, she might get away before he came back. Where she would go after that, she wasn't sure.
That hit home, more than she would have liked, though she shouldn't have been surprised. He always knew how to hurt her with his words. "Shut it," she demanded, as she pushed him into a table.
"Of the people in this room, which one is; a) wearing a spangly outfit, and b) not of use?" Toni replied.
He leaned closer to her as he sat on the edge of his seat. "You're awake. I never thought I would see your beautiful eyes again." His hand left Toni's upper arm and traveled to her face where he cupped her face. "So glad." His thumb started to spiral again, gently rubbing her cheek.
on a high horse.
Anyhow, I hope you like this Chapter.
"I live this way," he smiled. She followed him.
In the next Chapter, we shall see where Toni ends up and whether she had done any damage to the time line.
Barnes gave her a look. "Hop? What do I look like a rabbit? I-"
Poor Toni. It looks like she is never going to get a break.
Tony smiles as he turns and leans against the counter. "And what about you, Tasha?" he asks, smiling at her. Natasha and Tony hadn't been close originally, but that had changed in the past few months. She has been become one of this favorite people, and that's saying something.
She didn't want to deal with her emotions and she would do anything to hide from them. Her guilt was the enemy and she would find a way to rid herself of it. The first thing she would do was not talk about him. "You said my device is gone? Hopefully, it's really destroyed. If not, I'll take it bomb to it," she said, trying to put a smile on.
It was just Bruce and Pepper alone in the lounge, and for a while, it was dead silent between the two. The tension could be cut with a knife, and to make things worse, Pepper was still steaming at the fact that no one told her that Toni was back. Sure, she guessed that they were correct that they didn't want to overwhelm the genius, but she wasn't SHIELD. She was one of the closest people to Toni, and she was one of the few people who could get to her. She knew when to push and when not to push.
"I can see the gears in your head spinning," he replied, remaining close to her. "Talk to me."
Toni turned to him, realizing that she met him before, but what was his name? She knew it started with a g. "How'd you guess?" she asked, as she looked away, still scanning the area. "Yea, I so can't sleep." She puffed. When he laughed, his name came back to her. "Gabe, right?" she asked.
Howard shifted his weight to another knee. "You know it was something you said, which got me thinking. I wouldn't have given this theory any thought if it wasn't for you, but once I opened my mind, I saw the clues. When the 107 was captured, you didn't seem all too shock. Like you knew what would happen."
"Yes," Jones said from his seat at an old, wooden table. "We found you on the ground unconscious, and for a second, we feared you were dead."
Though he looked like he wanted to fight her, he put on a small smile and walked to his room. "I will hold you to that," he stated as he disappeared into his room.
"The Autopilot had kicked on and changed our course," Clint replied, as he started to switch controls and gain control of the jet. "Won't go back to Manual."
"When can we be let into the lab?" Natasha asked, eyeing Pepper. She was a trained assassin and she didn't like the what if's game. She needed facts.
Rogers took a deep breath as he tried to convince himself. But before he could calm himself fully, his mind drifted to Toni, and his heart just shattered. He had left her. He had left her to suffer seventy years alone. She could've died alone, like she always had been. He had promised himself when he first met her that he wasn't going to allow that to happen. How could he have allowed that to happen?
Tony thinks to himself.
"I don't think you should get your cast wet."
Ignoring the annoyance of being called Miss, she answered, "I came with someone, but I can't seem to find him. He's like this high." She put her hand up at the approximate height of Steve. "He kind of looks like a child." She hated to refer to him as a child because he wasn't.
He voiced, his mind wandering to Toni. She was defenseless with people who he didn't know if he could trust.
Toni's fingered buried themselves in his shirt, holding onto him for dear life. "I…I keep seeing things."
"No."
Toni let out chuckle. "Don't worry. You can bug little me, who would probably blow you off too."
"Corporal Sark, where would the fun be in that?" he asked. "I just want to show you a good time." They were starting to attract a crowd; however, no one did anything except watch.
Steve glanced at the two, wondering what the hell they were walking about. What blonde? And besides, he hated that Shield apartment, and he would like nothing more than to live in tower fulltime with Toni. "What blonde? Are you talking about the woman next door?" he asked, sincerely. He hadn't paid two seconds of attention to that woman, and he couldn't even say what her name was.
She had to figure out where she was and who had her. This hospital room looked nothing like any hospital she been in or seen. It looked like it came from the 1930's or 40's, just like that ugly nurse. The device, which monitored her vitals, looked ancient, and that scared her. If her captors were using out of date equipment, it wasn't good. Maybe, she was a prisoner for some third world villain, but that didn't explain the Captain. Rogers wouldn't betray her, even if she pissed him off.
"You've faced a lot in your life, haven't you?" Erskine stated, seeing through her worry like Phillips had done.
Toni glanced up at her father and smiled. "Nope."
Natasha narrowed her eyes. "What's Stark doing? Buying drugs?"
"How can you tell?" she asked as she shook his hand off her. "You should watch calling me Stark. We don't want anyone to hear that."
Even if no one thought it was possible, she knew when to shut up—she just didn't do it. She was silent though as she wasn't stupid, especially when she was on the ground and unable to stand. With the intensity and length of the fight, her legs felt like jello and she was unable to put any weight on them. Having jumped from suit to suit, she had pushed herself to her limits. Toni wasn't out of shape, but she wasn't a soldier. She wasn't trained like Barton or Rogers. She wore herself out fast, especially when she had to jump from suit to suit to avoid getting killed.
"Steve."
"You're cocky," he stated.
With each passing second, Toni felt herself get anger. Why was he forcing her to listen to this? It had to be a show, an attempt to get her to see he was superior in every way, but that would not change her mind. Surely, he knew this, because if she didn't bend under torture, she would not bend to his words.
"Are you going to be around for that?" Barnes asks. "Or are you going disappear again? It might be safer if I ask someone else." His eyes are drilling into him. "Not some indecisive jerk, who doesn't know what he's doing."
"Don't you call her that," Barnes yelled.
Steve took another deep breath, wondering when he had been gotten in so deep. How did he love her that it hurt to be away from her? Hurt to see her hurting? How did he fall for her, when she always kept him at arm's length? How could've he had fallen for her when she kept pushing him away? He wasn't sure, but he knew he was going to fight for her, even if she was cruel to him. However, he knew it was all an act now, and he was stupid before for thinking she meant any of that. He wouldn't fall for it again.
She gave him a long look before opening the box, and she froze as she stared at two sets of dog tags. Without looking, she knew who both of these sets belong to. However, she didn't understand how they were in the boxes as they should have gone down with Barnes and Rogers. "I don't understand," she said, unable to take her eyes off them. "How can you have these?" She asked, feeling herself tremor. The tags felt chilling to the touch, and she felt colder with each second that she touched them.
"Three slugs. No rifling and completely untraceable," Hill answers.
"You don't need to tell me twice," she said as she walked to the control panel. They were so many odd buttons on the panel that Toni didn't know what each of them did; it looked the Enterprise from the Original Season. Sure, she would figure it all out in time as she was awesome, but they didn't have time to figure it out if she were to judge by the monitors. A hand full of guards were on their way to the room, and each were heavy armed. "Just keep an eye on the monitors."
When Steve reached the Robotic labs, he felt his heart skip at the sight of her. From his angle, he didn't have a good view of her, but he felt himself relax just at the sight of her. He felt like he was in control of himself now that she was back. He felt like himself. He felt like he could smile, even if he was having a difficult breathing. What was it about her that made him feel like this? He had fought the Red Skull, jumped out of planes with nothing on his back besides his shield, and fought an alien race, but the sight of Toni made him breathless.
"This." He said simply.
She shook her head. That was different. She wasn't sure how it was different, but it was different. "You two seem too busy making out. I can make it back on my own."
He would be correct about that. "And you would just let me go after that?" she asked.
The genius stilled and held onto the Soldier for a good few minutes, not saying anything. Her fingers dug into his skin, almost as if she was afraid to let go, and for a few second, Steve thought Toni had fallen asleep. However, she was wide wake, though she was clearly struggling to stay up. "Do you ever feel like you're drowning?" she asked, softly.
He eyed Steve. "With Toni's blueprints and JARVIS's help, I was able to finish the device, but I still need a damn power source. Nothing I tried worked." He paused. "I even tried to build one of Toni's reactors, but I failed. I'm not really an engineer like Toni." He let out a chuckle. "That woman is a genius. Not sure how she did it. "
"Again, you have one!"
"Does that mean you believe me?" she asked hopeful.
"Still not getting into my pants, Private," Toni stated, as she folded her arms across her chest. She gave him the famous you-are-an-idiot glance, which Future Rogers hated. "You got to at least buy me dinner first, but I ain't a cheap date."
"So a job offer? Aren't you afraid that your board's going to like me better and make me CEO?" she asked, trying not to laugh. Why was it so hard?
"I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit," Steve stated, angry. He knew he shouldn't trust the director, but he never thought he would use the cube to make Tesseract weapons.
Toni's lungs were about to explode in her chest. She didn't know how long she had been running, but it had been a few hours judging by the setting sun in the distance. With the ghost of Barnes behind her, she didn't think she would be able to keep it up. No, she knew she couldn't keep it up, not when her legs shaking beneath her like a violent tremor. "No," she uttered, falling to her knees. Her heart was pounding in her chest, as she was unable to force herself back to her feet. She was done.
"Aunt?" Howard started. "Wouldn't want the honor of being the mother of my child?"
"I think Hulk would like to give him one too," the fellow Scientist said. "The Other Guy is very fond of you."
With a soft look, Sam started to say, "You-"
Like a magician, Nick hid his pain well, as he settled in his chair. He melted into it as he tried to make himself as small as he could. "You really think I'd need one?" He gave them both a stern look, his eyes lingering on Toni for a few long seconds. If eyes could kill. "My wife kicked me out."
"And what about the team?" she asked, thinking what this relationship could do when it ended.
Toni took a deep breath. "People like to ask me that," she answered, not wanting to answer that.
"I would." He paused. "I would also like to know how you got into my lab. My security is top notch."
*O*O*
"Let's go. We've been here far too long," her Stalker said, looking back to the flap.
Steve reached out to grab Toni's elbow, but he dropped him hands when he was inches from her. "You're still having nightmares, Toni?" His voice was soft, comforting, and it pulled her in.
Steve's fist balled at his side. "You don't know what you're talking about, as she was quite clear to what she wants," he replied in a cold tone.
Seeing Toni suffering from it was a blow to his heart, as he never wanted her to feel that. He wanted nothing more than to protect her from it. He already knew she was suffering from PTSD, remembering how she was when she was rescued from the Red Skull. He knew it would get worse if she didn't talk about it, but he wondered if she would. Would she be willing to speak about it? He doubted it, but he couldn't give the subject much thought as the room was full of Avengers that he had to deal with, and they all avoided mentioning what happened at the camp.
"No, but Banner's looking for answers in Stark's lab," Natasha answered from the corner of the room.
Shaking her head, she closed the journal and stuffed it in the rim of her pants. She would go page through page, reading everything that he had written later, but her desire to find that missing photo was greater. She needed to find it. She just needed to. It was one of the last things her father held.
The Colonel looked insulted. "I was not. I was looking at that thing in your chest." He pointed to the Arc Reactor.
*O*O*
She couldn't understand why he still wasn't mad at her. Anyone else would be mad at her. "I could've stopped it," she replied into his chest.
"We got it," Bruce replied.
"Toni, are you okay?" Steve asked, going back to her. Was she talking to them? Calling him back?
Toni could lie and say he hadn't grown on her, but she couldn't. This man in front of her wasn't her father, a man she disliked; he was someone completely different. It made her wonder what happened to make him so cold, and it wasn't just the death of her mother. "So what are your theories?" she asked.
And the ASSET...
"At least, I never shot at someone," she stated. "Well on my own team," she added. Howard glanced at her before turning to the motionless Captain.
Toni didn't like the idea of being an 'asset,' and she
"It's my fault," she uttered as she stared at the box.
She glanced up at him as he finished his sentence. "So he told you," she said slowly. She wasn't surprised that Howard telling Phillips, but she was surprised at Phillips' calmness. She expected him to be mad that Howard knew but nothing.
movie
"Then let's get this done," Toni replied, as Howard took the case from Phillips, who stepped away as soon as the case left his hands.
"She's awake," Schmidt stated. "I was worried that my soldiers had hurt you. We can't have that now."
"I'm an inventor, just like your weapons expert. Would you ask him to tell you all of his secrets?" Toni asked. The questions that he was asking, Toni couldn't answer anyways. She knew what the device was supposed to do, but she had no idea of what it really did. It took her back in time, but she had no idea of how. What else did it do? Could it send her back to the future? She wouldn't know until she got it back. "If you did, I bet he wouldn't say anything as well." She knew her father well, and he would go to his grave before he revealed his secrets.
"Just ask what you really want," she stated as she tried to get her heartbeat down.
"Yes, now kiss me and shut up, Cap?" Tony says, knowing it's stupid to fight what he's feeling. These two didn't give up before, and he can tell these two won't give up now, not after what Natasha had told them.
Mr. Spector took a step to her before he opened his suitcase. "Not everything. There was a session of the will that was omitted before you read it." He opened the suitcase just enough to put out a fat, large, yellow envelope. "In it, it gave strict instructions not to give this package to you until this very day. Until you were here at his grave."
Barnes released Toni's wrists, stepped away from Toni as if he was caught doing something illegal. "No, Ma'am."
"Maybe so, but it does not matter. You will break," he stated as he waved his soldiers forward. "And you will tell me everything. No woman can outlast me."
"Are you sure?" There it was again: worry. Bucky was very easy to read at times.
"And don't forget to have some fun."
She took a deep breath because he did have a point. That Commander did say they were after her, though it was still a wonder why. How would they even know about her unless they had information about the future? "I'm going to see Stark, and you can watch me as I walk." She tried to turn to leave but he wouldn't let her. "What?" she asked, annoyed. Why was he holding her like this?
"This has to stop," was Pepper's cold response.
"Paper Fight!" Clint's laugher echoed across the room, breaking through Toni's brain freeze like a knife. "I can't believe he just did that," he chuckled as he was on the ground laughing. He was reaching for paper to ball up and throw.
"What? You don't think I can behave? Nope, never mind. Don't answer that." She replied, placing more distance between her and the ocean. The suit was still dripping wet, and it glimmered under the growing moonlight.
"-here a second longer while my fella is in there hurt, you're kidding yourself! Now move-"
Bucky almost jumped at the voice. He turned to see Steve leaning against the wall with a jacket in his arms. He looked a little ruffed up. "What happened to you?" he asked, keeping his voice down. "You didn't try to tell the idiots in apartment 205 to shut it, did you?"
Rhodes looked at Toni for a few seconds, before getting to his feet. "Pepper," he called softly. "Slow down. Let's talk about this."
"Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran and somebody shot at my tires near Odessa." With a pain look, she replayed the memory in her head. "We lost control, went straight over a cliff. I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there, just out of sight. Even though I was covering him, he shot him- straight through me." With a bit of hesitation, Natasha pulled up her shirt to show the bullet wound on her stomach. She held it up just long enough for Steve to see. "A Soviet slag, no rifling." She paused for a second. Her eyes grossed over in thought. "Bye-bye bikinis."
Toni didn't watch as they left, but she felt their judging eyes on her. She could guess what they were thinking and it wasn't something that she would like. After hearing the flaps close, she spoke, "What can I help you with, Salty?"
"But you have no idea of what it does," she replied, giving him a look.
Toni could hear him as he stepped away. What was it about this third man? Did he do something? Was that why Rollins sounded scared in approaching him?
Tony leans against Jim, as Natasha settles against the genius, interlocking her hand in his. "In case, you didn't hear the news, we aren't together anymore." He takes a deep breath as if to put on a mask. "Damn the media! They're slacking. Sleeping instead of working! They have one job. One job," he says, trying to ignore the ping in his chest. He also tries to ignore Wanda, who's staring at him with a knowing look.
Rhodes let out a harsh sigh. "It's the matter of when it suits you," he replied, harder then he intended. He forced himself to take another deep breath.
she cursed in her head. Why did she get so attached? Why did she break that rule out of all rules? If she hadn't, she wouldn't have gotten attached to Barnes or Steve?
The pain stopped for a second, though only for a second, as an intense anger took over. Shaking, Toni forced her eyes opened, ignoring the pain. "Oh yeah, with zip-ties. It's a ball," she snapped, looking at Maya—an idiot woman who didn't look sicky like Toni wanted. No matter how many times or how long it had been since she had seen this woman, anger flooded Toni each time she saw Maya, the woman who changed her life.
Maya was seconds from death, but she didn't stop fighting, not that Toni blamed her. Death was one of Toni's greatest fears, and no matter how often she faced it- and she faced it a lot-, Toni could never truly face it, face lack of control, the unknown. Even now, Toni was tired, overheated, and in pain, and her possible death was screaming at her at the highest volumes. She could feel her worry and concern yelling at the back of her mind. She could feel it build up inside of her, though it could be a panic attack that she refused to acknowledge.
Howard narrowed his eyes. "Telling her that I have it would only send her to me to steal it back." He took a long look at the Colonel and he could see it in this eyes. "But that seems to be what you what."
"I'm fine," she muttered. "You don't need to call anyone. I got this." She didn't want him to call anyone, because she didn't need anyone. She was fine on her own as she would always be.
He watched her walk away from him, but in his mind, he was watching Toni walking away from him. It was a mystery to him why he was envisioning Toni as Toni and Natasha looked nothing alike. Sure they were roughly the same height at five foot three inches though Toni could've been an inch or two shorter, but their shapes were different. Natasha was a curvier than Toni. Plus, Toni's dark hair, even when she had it up in a messy bun, attracted him every time.
With a deep breath, Toni reached for the disconnected wire that she had left disconnected from the core, because she didn't want to risk the device going off by itself. If it did, not only would someone get hurt but she would be stuck here.
There were very little movement around her, as the rain weighed everything down. The sounds from the city were drowned out by the water droplets, and it was like the park was separated from the city. It was like it was its own entity, and it was almost freeing in some sense. It was nice to only hear the rain in a city that was so loud; however, she didn't get to experience that for long, as she suddenly heard something behind her.
"Do you understand the heart ache that you have caused Hydra?" Rumlow threatened.
She took another deep breath, thinking. However, it wasn't even a second later that someone was yelling after her.
"You better watch your tone," Peggy demanded.
Bruce stepped toward Rhodes, putting himself between Rhodes and Potts. "Are you okay?"
"I will," came the bully response.
"AreyoudatingSteve?" she asked quickly.
? She thought. He had never watched, always leaving the room whenever they started. She wasn't sure of his reasons, and she didn't really care for his reasons. She just wanted him to die in a blaze of fire.
she yelled at herself. She still felt a little raw from the night below. This woman saw her in a full-on freak out, but there wasn't ounce of judgment in Sharon's eyes. There was this softness in his voice. Just like there was in Sam's eyes. It was weird. Toni wasn't used to this kindness without someone wanting something in returned… well, unless it was Steve. He was sweet. He was brave. Steve was everything.
In a fit of anger at hearing Toni's name, Steve smashed the computer screen. He may be Captain America, but he was still human. "Shut up."
Her heart was beating a million miles per second, as it took her eyes minutes to open, feeling like she was trapped. It felt like someone was holding her, and she could feel her stomach doing flips. However, her heart stopped as she saw the Mark 42 reach and grab Steve. There was a wild look in his eyes, but he didn't allow the suit to pull him from Toni, fighting it. "Power down!" Toni yelled, feeling completely sick. She forced herself into a sitting position, allowing the sheet to pool in her lap and exposing her chest to the cold, icily air.
"Oh, you worry too much, Stark," he replied.
*0*0*
"Sure," he said, a little shaky. He stood and walked to her. He put one of his hands on the back of her neck to hold the dress together, and he placed the other on her lower back.
"Oh," she muttered, forgetting she had done so. She had changed it yesterday, because somehow the jerk, Steve Rogers, had gotten ahold of the code. She didn't want him, well anyone really, to have access to her lab. "Let her in," she ordered as she placed the device down.
*O*O*
"I was surprised to see you here. I never thought these stupid Americans would send you in," she said, her accent was heavy. "Not you; however, he'll be pleased."
"Is that why you're quitting SHIELD?"
When Toni came back, she felt druggy and couldn't find the strength to move. It took everything she had to open her eyes, which felt heavy. When she was finally able to, it took a few seconds for her vision to focus. Everything was dull shapes and colors, and she couldn't make out where she was.
Tony can feel his heart shatter in his chest as he listens to James. Hearing them side with the other is the last shot to the heart he can take. He may lo—nope, nope, he doesn't. He can't. He may care for them, but he can't do this, be the odd one out. He really can't. Why did he ever think this was a good idea? He can't believe that he thought this could work. They'll always side with each other no matter what the situation is. If they do it now, what happens when they disagree on something bigger? Will they go to war against him again? "Is that how you feel, Rogers?" he asks, dryly, trying to hide both his mental and physical pain.
With a sighing chuckle, Rumlow replied, "No. No, he wasn't."
"Whose idea was this?" Steve asked, interrupting Rhodes.
"I don't know, but I can't be for sure. We have to keep it a possibility," Fury stated. "I had sent a message to Asgard for Thor, which wasn't something I wanted to do, but we'll need his help for this. He should be able to help locate Stark and the missing weapons." He turned to the door and Agent Romanoff didn't stop him as he left.
Toni gave him a look. "Don't me make me hurt you."
Sorry it took me so long to get this chapter out.
Without much thought, her eyes went back to the two men. Even if they were still a haze, she was able to make out certain details, though it was a battle to keep her eyes open. She could tell it was just one of the two that was yelling. The other one was just staring at…her with such an intense look that it felt like he was drilling into her. She tried to look away, but she couldn't. There was something about him that drew her in. Maybe, it was the weird silver sleeve he was wearing, which wasn't making any sense; however, it was still interesting.
With a smile as large of the moon, she turned to the rest of the class. "Thank for letting me join your class together." She was met with a round of cheers, which only got louder when she said she would fund their next project. She also included those with their faces plastered against the glass, looking like idiots. After she said, it was near impossible for to get out of there, especially when they all wanted to pose for pictures. And man, did she pose for pictures! She had lost count; however, she did remember the internal freak out she had, when she realized her dog tags and Steve's ring were visible. With something so personal, she didn't want it on show. That was for her, not the rest of the world.
The man, with amazing, unyielding strength, didn't gave Toni any time to recover and reached into one of his pockets. "Просто оставайся на месте." He said, as he tossed a small circular device at her.
Toni let that slide as there was something going on in Peggy's head and she wanted to know what it was. "So Agent, what's going on in that head?" She asked, using a direct attack. She glanced at Carter one last time before she laid down. She twitched when she realized where she put her journal; it was digging into her back, but she did not move to get it. She wasn't sure if Peggy knew about it, but she did not want to draw attention to the fact that she kept one.
Steve gives her another look before he leans toward his genius, lacing his fingers into Tony's. "Watch it," he says.
The Asset turned back to the cliff one last time and stared at the water, which seemed to be calmed now. It was almost like it hadn't been disturbed by a falling house. He stared at the water for a bit, looking for the Beefy Blond. Being a Hydra weapon, the Asset wasn't sure why he wanted or need to see the Blond break the surface of the water, for him to be okay. It wasn't the same level of emotions and he didn't exactly feel the same like whenever he saw the Brunette, but there was something there. He just didn't know what; however, the Asset didn't have to ponder it for long as the Blonde broke the surface of the water-though he only stayed above the water for a few seconds before diving back down—riding him of that foreign emotion.
Toni heard Peggy shift on her cot and judging from the sound, Peggy had laid down. "Can't we girls look out for each other?"
"And where are your shoes?" Carter asked, stepping toward her. She had a look of pity in her eyes that Toni didn't like.
"Stark," the man said again.
"Where did you get it?" Romanoff demanded once more, drawing Steve's attention.
"I can see you're uncomfortable."
Steve looked at her. "Do you want to see a movie?" he asked as he pointed to a movie theater.
"This rooms so needs a makeover," she stated, taking a long look around. Nothing in the room really matched, and it all looked like it came from a junk yard. "…Wait, is this Rogers' room?" Was Rogers in the lobby as well? She didn't see him but he must've been if she ended up in his room. Why did they have to put her in
"What?!" Toni uttered, her eyes huge. "If you like the floor so much, you can sleep on it!" She played angry, trying to sound hurt—though she was not fooling anyone. There was a smiling Toni underneath it.
"There we go," the man said.
Toni's heart was beating in her chest, threatening to pop out, as her breath became labored. "What?"
When she got within a feet of the usher, he spoke to her. "Can I help you, Miss?"
The Howling Commandos were an interesting group to say the least, and that was putting it mildly. She thought the Avengers were a crazy group, but these people were something else, and she had to say she was okay with that. "Four of a kind," she stated as she laid down her hand.
"Yea, just wanted to make sure you were okay. You were in such a bad shape," he stated as the opened the door for her. She followed him in knowing he wasn't going to hurt her. "It's good to see you're okay, well for the most part."
"Nice try, but I won't tell you anything," she snapped. Phillips had noticed the change in Toni as Erskine spoke to her. The time in that room was getting to her; silence could be one of the most dangerous tools in an interrogation.
With a deep exhale, Natasha rested her pose and leaned against the wall. "I don't know."
"I can't leave you two alone for a minute, can I?" Rogers stated as he entered the room. He had a smile on his face, as he was clearly glad that they were talking again. "Anyhow, we better get going, Bucky."
Toni didn't know what was more sad or pathetic: her guilty and grief over the unstoppable death of her father or Bruce slaving over a device that he couldn't hope to work. She couldn't decide, but it only made her want to get imbibed even more. The need to get wasted was overwhelming, and she wanted nothing more than to down a whole bottle of whiskey. No, she needed to down a whole bottle. If anyone asked, she would deny that she had a problem. She didn't drink because she liked it; she got drunk because she needed to forget. That wasn't a problem. It was a solution.
"Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?" Savin asked, as he glanced back to the trapped genius.
"Dr. Banner, put down the scepter," he ordered as he could feel the glare from Toni.
With a deep sigh, he stepped to the door; pausing when he noticed his apartment number. It was still on the door, but it was askew. It may be nothing, but there was no reason for the number to be askew, unless someone was messing with it. Granted, it could have been a kid playing in a hallway, but that was too much of a coincidence. He was Captain America after all. He doubted someone was just messing with his door. With a flick of his finger, he pushed the number aside to see if his spare key was there. Seeing it was gone, he put himself on high alert as he entered his apartment.
As he rounded the corner the cornered, he noticed a woman, who she wasn't wearing a jacket. "Is she insane?" Steve asked himself. Just to make sure she was okay, he approached her, and to his shock and surprise, it was that lady. "Hey!" He picked up pace.
She gave him a look, her eyes drilling into him. "No, Rogers. You stop this. Why do you think there's something between us?" she asked. "There's
Rumlow didn't step back, standing his ground. "Miss Stark is a highly valued asset. It would be foolish not to-"
"I wasn't trying to get anything out of you, Toni. I was making sure you're okay."
to talk to him, and after the serum, he was at war, so when did he have a chance to make out with anyone? Well…. There were the show girls when he was a chorus boy. Was Steve a bad chorus boy? How bad-
"I don't know what the big deal is," Steve said. They were in his bedroom, which had seen better days. Unlike most of the apartment, it was neat and clean, while the furniture in the room was old and mismatched like the rest of the apartment.
Behind them was the smiling Trip, who was keeping a close eye on the two elderly men. It seemed that Trip was never more than a step away from the men. "I'd better go after them. My mother won't be happy if one of them breaks their hips…again."
He looked at her weird, hearing his last name out of her month. "He doesn't need to know," he stated as he unlocked the front door to the apartment.
Watching Steve and Peggy, it was heartwarming; though bittersweet at the same time. Peggy didn't last long before she flashed back twenty years. It was a stab to the gut, and Toni could see Steve's face fall at the change. Spending time with Peggy felt good as that woman could lift any heart, but it felt amazing in her good moments. Her bad moments felt like someone was stepping on her heart with cleats. It was a nightmare that wasn't going to get any better.
"And I love that too," he said with a wide grin.
As Tony battles himself in his own head, he's deadly silent and stiff, and when he snaps back to reality with a few more tugs, he knows everyone's watching him, and though that's normally what he likes, he wishes everyone would ignore his existence and turn to the television.
Here you. Let me know what you think.
After Toni had disappeared behind that door, Dum Dum and Gabe had taken their leave, though Steve would've loved to have spent more time with them. He would've loved to have heard stories about their lives after the war, but it was time for them to leave. It was starting to get awkward with Clint, Bruce, and Natasha hovering over their shoulders, and this situation with Pepper only made it worse.
"It isn't her, who can't handle it. It's you, who can't handle it," Clint shot back.
A soft smile appeared in his face. "You know that tells me everything."
Placing a soft, gentle hand on her face, he looked her in the eye. "Are you sure?"
Shaking her head, she laid in Barnes bed and stared at the ceiling. It was strange to sleep in his bed as she still couldn't get pass the smell of his room, which smelled like him. Even the colors and fabrics of the room were so strongly him. Toni could almost see him laying in bed with her, and it made her sick. Rolling over, she covered her head with his pillow as she tried not to think about Barnes' death.
She rubbed her temple. She would need to copy the badge, but that would be difficult. It all depended on type of security system that her father had. "Fuck," she muttered. A card cloner wasn't a problem as she could build a machine to hack her father's system. She had done it before. However, she didn't have the materials to build it. Yes, the hardware store gave her access to tools but she would need some computers parts, which was all but impossible to get in this decade.
She would admit that she was a spoil brat going up (Some would say still), although she would deny that to Rogers. Every desire (besides her desire to feel her father's love) she had was fulfilled, and every worry she had been taken care of. She didn't have to worry about how she would pay her rent, put food on the table, or last the week. She was very lucky to be born a Stark, and she was relearning how lucky she was. For that, she was very thankful for her father.
Barnes interrupted her. "Thought I was someone else?" he finished. "So who were you expecting?" he asked, eyeing the hammer's handle (the only part he could see).
That was why there were a limited number of people who had the key to her heart, and if she lost one of those people, it was a shot to her heart, which she didn't know to handle. No, she
He put his hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye. "I want you safe, but there's no stopping you and I'm not going to try. I tried last time, remember? It didn't work." He stared silently into her eyes for a second before he added, "I know you can take care of yourself."
"Do you think it was an inside job?" Natasha asked. She didn't look pissed, which annoyed Clint.
She took a deep breath, knowing she should let this go. If she pushed, she might change history or make him mad. Maybe, Rogers wasn't supposed to know to a certain time. "Okay," she agreed. "But…" She shook her head. She needed to let this go. "Fine."
Toni's eyes widened, not expecting Steve to be back already. "He's in the tower?" she asked, shocked.
"Then we have no time to waste," Steve replied, as he turned his back to the door.
Phillips stared at him for a second, wondering about that tone of his. He didn't like it too much; it had a command tone that he couldn't understand as Rogers had no authority even if he had the title of Captain. "You don't get to give me orders, Son."
"I can tell you in the morning. Why don't you get some sleep?" he asked, redirecting back the conversion about sleep. It was clear to anyone that Toni hadn't slept in some time. Heavy bags had formed under her eyes and she looked pale.
Toni chuckled with a wink. "Can't blame a girl for trying." However, she still had no idea of what he wanted from her, or maybe, that was the point. Maybe, he just wanted to make her crazy… but would the point be in that? Did he get some kind of joy seeing her sweat? "But you can still let me go."
The genius didn't need any other reason to dislike—no, hate. She didn't need any reason to hate this nasty woman, but fate was giving her another reason to punch her lights out. "So you took Killian's card?!" Toni snapped, struggling with the zip ties that were digging into her flesh. Under the restraints, her skin was red and swore, though the pain was barely registering. Her intense anger was growing with each passing second, and no matter the strange feeling in her head, it didn't seem to be stopping any time soon.
"I assume this is a communication device," he stated as he stared at the smart phone. "I can't quite get it to work, but that isn't what I am interested in."
"No," Steve protested strongly, stunning Toni and Peggy.
*O*O*
Salty looked very uncomfortable when he stepped back to her. "You need to distant yourself from Rogers."
"I've done nothing wrong, so give me back my items and let me go," she demanded. She tried to cross her arms but couldn't thanks to the handcuff. "I've a right to design and invent advance technology." She forced her thoughts away from the Arc Reactor that Phillips was staring at. "They're my property."
Again, Toni was silent, as she buried herself in his chest. She remained stilled for a few long minutes as tears fell from her eyes. "Are you planning in cooking? That might kill me," she finally teased. Her voice was hoarse.
She was sick of hearing that name. "Shut it," she cursed again as she drifted over into unconsciousness.
"The Avengers are worried about their missing member. They seem to want you back."
"Dangerous?" she snapped. He so did not have the right to tell her no. She would do what she wanted. "Just because you don't know how to handle it, doesn't mean I can't."
Toni's hand was no longer shaking after the five shots of whiskey; it was one of her skills: functioning drunk. She didn't know what it was about alcohol, but she seemed to do better with it in her system. The alcohol took away her insecurities, her doubts, and replaced them with something else. She wasn't a better person when she was drunk; this was known to everyone. She was downright mean—or horny—when she was drunk, and no one was safe from her, which was why she wanted- needed to stop. She hated who she was when she drunk, but she couldn't deal with the pain without it. She hated pain.
it. He hated that he had to pick. How could he chose between the woman he loved and saving people—his purpose? Both way, he would lose a part of himself, and he didn't know how to live without either. He was a soldier, and saving people was what he did, what he lived for. He had been a soldier for so long that he didn't know how to live a normal life. How to live without war. He didn't know who he would be if he wasn't Captain America, but at the same time, he didn't know how to live without Toni.
"I can see how uncomfortable you are, and I've noticed how jittery you get when you go out by yourself."
"I didn't say that," Bucky stated defending himself. He reached into the closet grabbing his coat. "You're getting worked and it's not helping you. Plus, it must be hard for her to be in a stranger's house with no memory of who she is."
Thunder storms had always been a no go for the genius, who had hated—not feared, never fear—these types of storms since she was a child. She didn't see the purpose of thunder storms, though she understood the science behind them. She understood why and how thunder storms worked, but that didn't mean she liked it. She hated the loud roar of the thunder and the blinding radiances of the lightening. She didn't like any of it, and she would do anything to hide from the storm. This dislike only worsened after
She pushed herself onto her knees and stared at the photos on the bed. She needed to get the device as she had to get it away from her father, who could be screwing it up. He would figure it out sooner or later because of who he was. Sure, she had invented more items than he, but if he was in living in her time, there was no doubt that he would be taking her to school. And she hated that.
The Super Soldier's heart was beating rapidly as Bruce spoke. "I need air," he replied loudly. His fists were still at his side as he stepped quickly out of the room. His departure was swift, wanting to get out of the room before anyone could say another word to him.
Her arms dropped to her side and her hands balled, burying the screwdriver in her hand.
Taking a deep breath, she took a single step away from the door and looked around the room. She looked down at the phone-turned-scanner and brought up the feed for the room. Without much effort, she put the video on a loop, so no one would know she was there. Putting the phone in her pocket, she crossed to a desk on the other side of the room. "There you are," she said, as she spotted her device. To her frustration and annoyance, her father had broken down her device, but she would be able to put it back together with no problem.
Steve warmed at that. "I'm trying to figure out what happened to her. I know that–"
"You are about to cross into international water, and I am picking up both coast guard and foreign ships nearby. I advise turning back to avoid an incident," her AI replied.
Barnes jumped to his feet and followed Toni out. "You don't ever need to apologize to me."
"Touché," she replied, watching him eye her device. The Genius wasn't sure what was going through her father's mind as he stared at it; however, she knew what was going through her mind. The more time she spent with her father, the more she realized how alike they were, which both pissed and gladdened her. She enjoyed that there was something that she shared with her father, but it also pissed her off. She refused to be like him, though she wondered if she was fighting a losing battle. She probably was and it made her bitter, thinking back at her childhood and it was painful to think that this man – would become something dark and unrecognizable, someone who didn't care for her and someone she had been glad had died but now wasn't so sure of it.
"Yea, we thought it was Barnes' night with him and you didn't want to impose," Natasha says, while shrugging. "And we kept seeing Steve carrying you to bed with that stupid look in his eyes."
It wasn't until a few moments later that Toni calmed down; however, she couldn't really say she had calmed down. But, she had a mission, and she had to complete it, as no one hurt her family and got away with it when she was around. She was going to get that asshole.
"I might get the wrong woman to be your mother. So you want to tell me who she is? And besides, if you don't like your name, I can always change it," he said, stepping to her.
Toni watched him leave before she turned to Barnes. She only stared at him for a second before she disappeared into the crowd as well. She had wanted to speak to Salty, but the sight of Barnes irritated her. He had betrayed her to Phillips, and she could not look pass that.
call? He can't stand to look at you. He's only with you because he pities you. He feels guilty."
"I'm going," Toni responded as she reached down for her bag. She slipped her arms though the straps and pulled it on her back. "Schmidt has something I need," she stated, unsure if Barnes knew who that man was.
"You see what?"
"I wasn't going to leave her out in the cold," Rogers countered.
"It-" Loud music started to play. "-is what I said," Clint finished, turning to the door. "What the hell? Is she going to have ear drums after tonight?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Toni wasn't sure what to make of Rogers and his outburst, but she didn't care for it. However, after taking a deep breath to calm down and think, she knew where he was coming from and she felt ashamed. She was never any good with understanding how to deal with her emotions or how to act. Was it okay to laugh? Was it okay to talk about him?
At first, Toni just stared off as she was in total disbelief, not believing that he had said that to her. Did he really say that to her? Did he really make a joke? Was the world coming to an end? There was no way this was her Captain America. He didn't joke.
Toni closed her eyes as the room cleared, leaving her alone with Steve. She wasn't sure what she was feeling at the moment, but she wasn't feeling all that great for sure. She still felt like it was roasting, and her mind was spinning. These stupid images wouldn't get the heck out of her head, and to make things worse, she wasn't sure what they meant, but they had to be true? Right? What else could it mean? If Rumlow really was there, why the hell did they leave her there? "What is S.T.R.I.K.E.?" she asked.
The Asset wasn't sure what was said after that as the next thing he recalled was pain. It was total and complete pain. If it wasn't for the mouth guard, there was no doubt that he would've bitten though his lips. The pain was excruciating, taking every thought that he fought to keep. He tried to focus on hers—no, Toni's face as she looked at him for the first time. Though he knew her name, he had no idea of who she was or why she was so important. She was just a name to him. A warmth that formed in his chest, but he didn't want to lose it.
There's only one way to get rid of
"Talk to me," Peggy demanded, sternly.
"Steve and I both agreed you can stay with us until you get on your feet."
Steve looked up and eyed the archer. "I do remember him stating before that we were a security risk," he stated. His arms were folded across his chest as he recalled that conversion.
Sharon made a face, a definite yes if Toni ever saw one. "Still not the worst thing I have ever done while undercover," she replied, putting eggs and bacon on the plates. "Call girl. Dancer—more than once. You don't realize how stupid men are. Just show some skin and they will tell you anything.
After scanning the grounds one last time, Toni's eyes rested on the mound of dirt a several feet away. It was a loose pile of dirt with pieces of metal sticking out, which caught the genius's eye. Making her way over, Toni had one thing on her mind: making sure the device was destroyed and unfixable. However, as she picked up one of the shards, she felt flashes of her memories rush back to her, taking over. Everything came to an abrupt stop, and she was forced back to that foggy dream- or possible memory. Even now, she couldn't make out anything but shapes or colors; however, it felt like she was back there. She felt frozen, unable to do anything. It felt like pound of bricks had hit her in the face.
"It's because they're the same person."
He narrowed his eyes at her before shaking his head. "You're way too comfortable," he stated. "Where did I go wrong? Maybe, I should lock you up with your father. Maybe, he can get you to behave."
She yelled at herself. "I meant…" What could she really say to that?
Toni glanced up to the Commander, who stood directly in front of her and reached a hand toward her. She couldn't lie this time; this female Commander scared her more than the Red Skull, and Toni visibly flinched when she grabbed a piece of Toni's messy, dark black hair.
"You did what you had to do. Don't let your guilt overwhelm you."
"Just a difference of the opinion, something I don't think we can get over," he said, interrupting her. "But that is not the point. Let me take you somewhere. I want you to see something."
"You can leave, but I'm going to stay here," Rogers replied.
Toni watched from the corner of her eyes and took a deep breath. Maybe, she could just leave now and they would never know…. Or okay, they would but that was beside the point. They wouldn't find out until she was gone and that would be too late for them to find her… Besides, she didn't need to be here and she didn't need their charity. I should just go, she thought, even if it was foolish.
In both time lines, it seemed like her father loved to yell at her for some reason or another, though it didn't seem as bad in the new time line. He seemed guilty about it in the new memories, but it didn't make it any better for Toni. She still felt neglected, still alone growing up. The Christmases that she remembered were gone, and she was left
She missed her Malibu lab, which came with a garage exit. In this tower, the only way to leave was the now painted doors. "I'm on the highway to hell. On the highway to hell," she sung loudly. Her voice was almost quacking, but she didn't care.
Pepper let another harsh sigh. "You're giving me a headache and you just got back, Toni. You should read the articles. Some suggest that you and Steve eloped during your disappearance. Eloped!"
A light bulb went off in her head, not realizing how big that photo had gotten. Sure, Fury was one thing, but Pepper was another. How big did this photo get? She thought Fury was being Fury, when he said all gossip sites. "JARVIS," Toni called. "Run a search on Captain Rogers and me. I want to see how many hits we're getting."
In Tony's distraction, Bucky doesn't waste a moment to get in front of him, and a second doesn't pass before Barnes' hands are on Tony, touching every part of him.
She took a deep breath. "It isn't that you're ugly….or wait it is," she chucked. She switched their clothes and walked out of the room with her head held up high.
"I do."
"You can't afford me," Toni said, her eye twitching. Again, she struggled against her restraints, causing the dog tags to ding as they hit the rector. "You couldn't even afford my right shoe."
"He did, and let me tell you, he gave me an earful. Wanting to know long I knew and what I was thinking sending his daughter behind enemy's lines. He was very protective and I thought he was going to hit me for a second, but that would have ended with him eating dirt," the Colonel said, putting on a smile. "However, I never agreed or denied that you were in fact his daughter, but nevertheless."
It came at her like a pound of bricks. Howard used to talk about him, whenever he talked about Rogers. This man had helped to produce Captain America. Sure, he wasn't Dr. Abraham Erskine, the man who had created the famous Captain, but he was one of the reasons why the project existed. "Well, Colonel Salty, why am I here?" she teased. He seemed like a salty character to her.
"Stark, what did you expect?" she asked, still feeling weird at addressing someone else with her last name even if it was his last name first.
Toni did her best to hide her limp as she crossed to the table. She didn't need anyone to notice it, because whatever was happening, she needed to be a part of it. This could be her way to get a core, though she would have to deal with the fact that Barnes and a few other good men were going to die, which she wasn't sure if she could.
"Don't you say it," she said through her teeth as he headed toward the door.
Banner glanced up from the monitor and looked toward Steve, who was glaring at the monitor. "You okay?"
"What gave it away?" she playfully asked as she mindlessly stared up. "Anyhow, what made you think Steve and I were something?"
The first thing on Toni's mind was finding a place where she could use her device. She had to pick a place that would be safe. If this time was anything like the last time, it would be a painful experience for her and anything or one around her. She needed a place far away from people, and this base wasn't the answer.
Again, Rumlow didn't and would never like this plan, but he would go along with it—Oh, Stark was so close to snapping-, because if it is succeeded, they would have everything. The world would be theirs, and there would be no one stopping them. On the other hand, controlling Stark would probably be a pain in the ass, and that was the thought that kept him in check. "Worth the risk?" After the last 'treatment,' the Winter Soldier had been good, listening to every commend without hesitation, but it was still a risk.
She groaned loudly as it felt like she was on fire. It felt like someone set her ablaze, and she was sweating. It felt like she was burning alive, though all she could see was ice and jaggy rocks. "N-No," she cried, feeling like she was about to die.
Toni narrowed her eyes at him. "You watched National Treasure, didn't you? Is that what you did when I was gone? If so, you need a life!" she said, looking back to the helicopter tapping down. "You're supposed to party when mom's away."
Toni broke from the kiss first, but she didn't go far as she was smiling against his lips. "I can get use to this."
It had started to be an obsession to him, always keeping the photo close and safe. He took it everywhere with him, even if he still had no idea of who the woman was. Even after the chair and pain, he refused to let go of it. Refused to let her go. He wasn't sure what that
Rhodes, who Steve wasn't quite sure he liked, shifted in the stool. He looked highly uncomfortable in the Captain's presence. "They want to send it out, to give the illusion that everything is okay."
Steve stood suddenly, as that promise he made went out the window. He wasn't sure what he was going to do, but maybe, he could stop her from going back in time; however, there was no telling what that would do.
Howard opened his briefcase, took out of the file and held it out to her. "Of course. What else will you do after the war?" he asked. "And you will love my labs." There was a brief second of silence before he laughed as she still hadn't take the file. "Oh, wait, I forgot. You don't like to be handed things."
Tony's heart is pounding in his chest, and he can feel his chest tight. "I'm not a teenager girl," he utters before he can stop himself.
Even if she knew Rhodes wasn't going to drop this, Toni let out a loud chuckle because teasing her best friend was one of her favorite past times. She would enjoy no matter the situation. "Oh, this conversion isn't R rated yet."
Natasha pinches him, causing him to wink in pain. "And you don't, Stark?" she mocks, giving him a smirk.
your boyfriend or his. I'm your landlord. Nothing else, so just leave me the hell alone." He pauses for a second as anger builds inside of him. He knows he shouldn't blame Barnes or Rogers for this as they have done nothing wrong (Besides making him lo- Nope not love-for making him like them), but it hurts. It hurts to see them so happy. "Go bug your boyfriend. You two are so goddamn annoying. Makes me sick."
She slapped him harder. "Put me down," she ordered as she glanced at Rogers who had turned away. She could see the tension in his shoulder, reminding her of the present day dick Rogers. Was this when he turned into an ass? She missed her shrimpy Steve, who had a heart of gold; she missed his sweetness, which could touch anyone's heart. Right now, he was acting cold, and it pissed her off as she had no idea of why he was acting his way. Sure, he could be mad that she disappeared but she didn't understand why it pissed him off so much.
Toni's eyes widened as she turned in his eyes. "What?" she asked, hobbling and leaning off her bad ankle.
The Nurse gave her an aggravated look, still holding the glass out to her. "You have to take it easy. Now, take the glass." When Toni didn't, the nurse sighed as she put a moveable tray table in front of her and set the glass on it. "There. See? Not handing it to you," she said, exasperated look on her face.
He remembered watching her leave and the intense urge to go after her. He would have if it wasn't for Peggy, who held him back with a single look. Though he didn't like it, he knew it was the right thing to do, because talking to an angry Toni was a very bad idea. Instead, he had to watch his best friend go after the woman of his dreams as he fought down his jealousy.
"And some drug dealer was murdered in Central Park," Clint added as everyone turned to Toni, who just frozen. She was a deer in headlights as she stared at the screen not hearing anyone or anything. On the screen, a picture of the man Toni had met in the park flickered for a seconds before it flashed to the bloody crime screen. It was a brutal bloody screen, though it was hard to make out most of it through the buzzy imagine.
She laughed. "You're still on that?" It hurt to laugh, but she didn't care.
"And I bet there's a lot," she stated, knowing her father was a lady's man. That was one of the reasons for her parents' fights. Her mother had thought her father was having an affair and had even accused Peggy of sleeping with him. Now, Toni didn't know if her father had cheated and she didn't want to know, but she wouldn't have put it pass him.
The man let out a chuckle. "Why don't we talk about the job first?" He replied, not moving. The needle was dancing dangerously in his hand. "We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of? Hm?" He asked. "Any signing perks that you want?"
And a few moments later, she was really in love with his plan. At that exact moment, the windows in the lab shattered as zip lines were fired into the room, and seconds later, Rogers' man filled the room, engaging in a fight almost immediately. It was only a second later that Rogers broke free from the man holding him.
He was on a mission, and he wouldn't let anyone stop her. As soon as he got back on the motorcycle, Steve raced out of there, looking for her.
With a deep breath, Steve turned to Natasha, Clint and Rumlow, giving them a look. He wondered for a second if they could see how broken he was. He could imagine how he looked at the moment, losing count to how many times he had jumped into ocean. There was no doubt he looked like a wet rat, as his clothes were ripped to pieces. He was also bloody, a result from his jumping into the ocean and the physical assault, but he wasn't worried. He healed fast. "Don't."
*O*O*
"Toni," he mumbled in a laughing tone, as he turned and walked back into the house. "Sometimes…"
Peggy took a deep breath before she started to walk away. "You brought him up." There was a long silence pause. "We do not have time to talk."
Toni took a deep breath as she pushed herself up. "There's some spare clothes for you in the dresser," she replied.
Toni let out a sigh, knowing he found nothing. There was nothing for her father to find. "And what did you find?"
"Toni," he uttered, sounding completely exhausted.
"Shouldn't be a problem." Steve answered, firmly.
He laughed into her hairline. "And you'll have to wait and see," he said.
"I don't know what's in this file, but I won't listen to
…with Toni. His brain supplied the name, even if it felt foreign to him, and every time he thought about her, a strange feeling tingled in his heart. It almost over took him; in the beginning, the feeling scared him and he wanted to destroy it. However, after seeing her and unable to stop the tingles, it morphed into something more. These feelings were completely mind blowing, mind altering, and it took everything in him not to turn around and run. But when he allowed himself to these things, he learned he enjoyed them.
"Keep telling yourself that. Keep telling yourself that he cares." His tone was ice cold. "He doesn't love you. He doesn't even like you. He hates you for taking
Nope. Nope. Never going to happen. Tony refuses to think about it as he walks pass the super soldiers. "Yea, so not interested in being that third wheel," he says with a wink. Yea, he had imagined the three of them together, but that's in his dream, where it's prefect. There's no fighting. There's no one picking the other over him, but it can't be like that in the real world. He's just the second choice here, if he's a choice in the first place. "Have fun you two. Don't stay out too late. I don't wanna ground you." He says, waving his hand at her. "But I will!"
he thought as Toni planted that image in his head. He couldn't help but think of it, and it brought out his desires that he had. Some may have been sexual, but he just wanted to be close to her. In the past, she had allowed him in and treated him no difference than anyone else. She had seen him at his smallest and didn't judge. She had seen him as a small weak man, who couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag, but she didn't treat him as such. She had seen him as a man no matter what he looked like.
She took a quick look around. There were a few doors along this hallway but each door was locked; however, there was nothing behind those doors that she wanted. Toni had seen the plans and had even been in this building before, which meant she knew her away round, even if she didn't know all of its secrets. She knew the most logical place that her father would be keeping her device and it would be farther in the building. However, the first thing that she needed to do was get to the control room.
Pepper shook his hand, noting his strong grip, before she stepped back and turned to Bruce. "Someone explain to me what happened? Where's Toni? And what's with Steve's gloom?" she said, loudly.
He shifted in his seat due to discomfort. Holding his side, Fury showed them another text; 'Just us.' "Just…my friends." He adds, verbally.
Clint nodded as he stepped out the door. "I'll hold you to that, Cap." With that, the Archer disappeared up the steps.
Toni's head was pounding, as a loud banging was echoing in her ears, making it feel like her head was on fire. The bright lights danced in her vision, while a cold sweat pouring down her red face. But at the same time, it felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to her head and pounded her within the inch of her life. With the intense pain growing at the back of her head and up her spine, she couldn't tell how many injuries she had or any kind of injuries, but it did feel like she had been hit by a truck and she had no idea as of why. Why did her body feel so foreign to her? She had so many questions, but she couldn't remember a thing, and the last thing she remembered was talking to the faker.
"Are you a drooler, Rogers?" she asked with a smile.
And I suck at fight scenes, just to let you know.
No, a chill was not running up her back. She was not scared of some nobody. "Okay, Buddy, why don't you take off that mask?" she ordered, her blaster raised. She didn't know why she was hesitating.
The Asset struggled against his restraints as he stared at bent, faded picture. He had no idea of how old the photo was, but it was clear that it was decades old. He couldn't tell you where the photo came from, but he could guess that it was from a target as there was dark blood stains on it. However, the age of the photo didn't hold his attention for long. There were two people in the picture, but it was the woman that caught his attention. It was her. It was the woman he was following in the park. She –Toni, he had to keep painfully reminding himself—was the only thing or person he wanted. The only thing that made him doubt himself and his programing.
Bucky replies with a strain in his voice.
"I still don't like it," Steve stated. No matter what any of them said, none of them would change his mind. He was set: Lori was not the answer. He huffed as he crossed the door.
Toni tiled her heard, trying to make herself look cute and innocent. Pepper had accused her of using her cuteness to win fights, and Toni had always denied it; however, she would admit it here and use it. She needed to win this battle. "You know how smart Stark is. Do you think Stark Industries wouldn't be able to create a time machine?" She said, wording that carefully. She didn't want to give too many details away like the fact that her father was dead in her time.
have father issues and she would beat the asshole, who said she did.
Bruce looked long and hard at Steve. "Really? You're a super Soldier, I turn into a big green beast when I'm angry, and we're friends with a demi-god. And you stop at time travel? We aren't strangers to portals. Time travel would work along the same idea." He huffed in annoyance.
"I don't think she would want someone touching her suits," said Steve, eyeing Rhodes. "And you could always just say she's on vacation somewhere. I would assume she had been on quite a few vacations where she had gone MIA." His arms were folded across his chest. He was still wearing his Captain America uniform and he was quite filthy, covered in dirt and mud. There was even some blood.
She was still wearing the white dress and sweater but she had added jeans and some kind of black shirt to her outfit. The jeans were an interesting touch as Barnes hadn't seen a woman wear jeans before, granted he hadn't seen many dames wear pants either. "So you decided to sleep here?" he asked as he took a seat next to her on the cold ground.
, and she felt better, even if her mind refused to stop. She had never been good at shutting off her mind, which was why she was a horrible sleeper only getting a few hours of sleep. She wished she could shut off her mind, especially now. She really needed to now. She was the most negative person ever.
"Shut it," she said, against his lips.
She closed her eyes, not daring to look back at him. He couldn't see her like this. "Hey…Sorry, I'm late." she said slowly. Her own voice sounded broken and shattered. There was no way he wouldn't be able to tell.
"Why I what?" she interrupted. "Why don't you leave before I beat you again?" Her heart was still beating rapidly as the bully did not move. He just stood still.
"You should be resting," he said. He placed a hand on her shoulder. "You're hurt. Schmidt had-"
"Are you okay?" he asked, noticing the tone in her voice.
Poor Toni. Do you think she will ever be the same? :( And I so think Toni would be a trekker.
"I wouldn't say impressive. Maybe, you should check your dictionary," the Colonel replied as she turned to her. "She's a criminal."
but he likes to watch at times. He knows they know this as they do stuff just to test his restraint, which isn't a lot. First, they just do this in the bedroom, but then, they start to make out in front of the lab's glass doors, not holding back. One will be pinned against the glass by the other, while both of them rips off the other's clothes, and every time Tony looks up, they give him the 'oh, don't you want to join us' look. Most of the time, Tony can't resist, but there're times where he can. Those times, he just watches them go at each other, fucking each other hard into the glass or bed. When they're finished, they don't take no for an answer and drag him to bed.
"I figured."
"That tone-" Schmidt started but was interrupted.
Barnes glanced toward Steve, who stiffed at the sight of her as well. Steve's hands were balled and they were shaking. "Schmidt," Steve called. Anger was presented in his voice.
Phillips let out sigh. "I guess I should be happy that my base is still in one piece."
"The Mandarin?" Toni asked, feeling a chill in her chest. A mission meant Steve was leaving for an undetermined amount of time, and her chest tightened thinking about. It meant that she was going to Malibu alone, and she would be alone
"Most ladies wouldn't admit that," Dugan stated with a loud chuckle.
After slipping into her combat boots and the wrench to her pants' pocket (to Toni's joy, she was wearing pants), she exited the tent in the search of her favorite person, though Phillips would not like that. Even if he believed her, she was not his favorite person and she was okay with that. Putting on a smile, she ignored the looks and stupid ass comments from the male solders as she walked through the camp. She didn't understand how they thought whistling or stupid pickup lines would make her want to drop her pants.
"Hungry, I see," a voice said from the doorway.
It was times like this that he missed the 40s. Yes, he loved the present, loved that fact he could cuddle with Toni and watch any movie from any time. He loved the food choices. He loved the colors—Yes, colors. He loved all the different shades. He loved how everything progressed
"I know," he replied, turning to stare out at the calming ocean. There was a struggle on his face as he turned to Toni. "I need you to be honest with me at all times."
Unable to keep back anymore, he stepped forward, wanting to look into her hazel eyes. He wanted to see her fear. He wanted to see why she was so scared. He wanted to understand why this lake had scared her so much that. Or was it something else? He wanted to know what had drawn her out at this time of night. Did she have flashes like he did? Did she have things in her head like he did? Was her mind clouded to? Was she hearing things?
"Toni," she said with a soft warning.
"And is Nancy your nurse as well?" Toni asked, sliding to the end of the bed. She eyed his cane, watching for any sudden movements. She was too tired to block or avoid the hit, and she didn't want another bruise on her shins.
your or his boyfriend. You don't need to worry about me," Tony snaps back.
"Hey, where do you think you are going?" the man asked, chasing after her. Toni shook her head and continued into the park, ignoring him following after her. "Hey, Hots Stuff."
Toni's eye twitched as she folded her arms across her chest. Though it annoyed her that he had her journal, she wasn't going to show him that it was getting to her as he would like that too much. "Why are you here?" she asked, glaring at him. She wished she could fry him with her eyes.
Talking, Peggy boarded the craft, as she went over the next battle. Like everyone, she was stressing over this as it could be the end of Schmidt and it had to go prefect. There was so many things counting on this, and one was Barnes, as they wanted his death to mean something.
Relief flashed across his face. "Toni-"
No, it's not," Toni replied, as her mind drifted. She couldn't think of anyone besides Steve, who was probably thinking the worst. Or maybe, this was good for him, so he wouldn't be weighed down by her. He wouldn't suffer because of her.
