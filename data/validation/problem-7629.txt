He took an apple. It was a real beauty, that one. Bright red, with that bubbling fruity smell which made his nose dance with happiness.
“Yeah, that is sensible, Cap”, Barton changed his tone. “There is no trusting the internet or those money grabbing bimbos and himbos Stark attracts like honey is sweet for flies. We are not exactly depended on those. Our Nat was his secretary for a while.”
Steve was sometimes a potty mouth when fueled by adrenaline. Still, the moniker, which could have carried a taste of a bad inside joke, didn’t sound endearing at all. Steve’s tone and demeanor made it a pure-bred insult.
He shook his head.
It had been almost eighteen months now. The newspapers had milked all there was to write about that faithful battle in Long Island, and only clickbaits tried anymore. There were texts about alien abduction, which was not far from the truth, when you thought about it. They had searched the battleground right after their assets’ disappearance and found lingering residues, which were suggesting the presence of a localized space-time continuum anomaly, or a worm hole, as the general public liked to name the thing. The SHIELD (and Fury) had kept the information from the news and been very tight-lipped about things in general.
“Don’t you dare”, Tony hissed. “Come on. Nobody wants anything from me except money or joyride. Is that it? You want to finish our little session?”
“I assume you didn’t last”, he suggested and Steve gave him a curt nod, still embarrassed but soldiering valiantly through his selected mission. “That is normal, darling, when you are inexperienced, and besides, you are a supersoldier with non-existing refractory period. If you want to last longer, we will make it so, it will just take some time and practice. Or did you manage to throw that salad bowl of yours with any accuracy right away?”
“Remember your fucking language! Falcon, you stay with Hawkeye, we got this! Widow, stop that! It is no use! Captain protocol! Now!”
During that time Steve had trials of his own. Like visiting his friends, Bucky and Gail, who expected to hear about his adventures. That first time Steve chickened out and didn’t tell them about him and Antonio, but the next went better. Tony had somehow found time to buy them new rings, to replace those which were left behind, because they never took their wedding bands with them to the missions. Steve had a brief vision how the other Steve would collect the rings from their nightstands in Stark Tower, putting them into the safe, to wait for their possible return. These new ones looked the same: plain platinum with only their names and the wedding date inscribed inside.
Steve couldn’t help it. He started laughing. “Yes, your father’s deal with me”, he uttered after damming up most of his mirth. “And your esteemed, dealing with the devil father is still alive and well, I presume. Enjoying his eternal life, isn’t he?”
“New smells, fresh and clear”, he said, looking nowhere particular. “Like all the people I have met here in this place. Strange smells, like you were not regular persons at all, but like those androids I read from the pulp novels. You missy, you smell rich, fancy food, nose-tickling chemicals, gun power, and metal you hide in your clothes. A used, familiar knife no guard would have left on you because they would have beaten and shamed your flesh long after they had found your weapon.”
of July for little o-old me? I am m-mighty f-flattered darling, I r-really am, but… shouldn’t you c-consider...”
“Sit still. Don’t let yourself fall down. That is Tony’s protein shake. He is a master at forgetting to eat anything solid. Drink all of it. I will put a few butterflies onto your back. When you get some food in you the wound should start healing more quickly.”
Antonio gave his customary smirk, and if it was a bit strained, well, then it was. “It is you, isn’t it? The other Steve? What is this? Are you two bonding through pranks now?”
The door opened again and there were real Rogers and Stark, or their Rogers and Stark, Fury meant, and he was able to make proper comparisons. Starks had the light resemble close relatives could have, but this Anthony was way older, about Fury’s age, and a short man with big, dark eyes, which made him look like a purse puppy between two German shepherds. Rogers he had begged already, but Steve’s boy, Bucky… Damn, how could that be James Barnes! He was as tall as Rogers combo, with pretty boy hair and bad-ass cybernetic arm, which could easily rip a metal door from its hinges.
“No, Tony. No opening the hatch door. All of you, brace yourself.”
“No”, Tony admitted quietly. “I thought… you were the supersoldier of our nation, and I thought that you would maybe like to… but then you said you never wanted to shoot people again… Yeah, Steve. It is weapons. Old weapons. Lots of them. From handguns to… Steve, if he finds it, there is enough stuff in there that he can walk out from the mansion as one man army.”
That made him sober up. “I am sorry for your loss.”
“No, he is not. He died in a car accident. My ma too.”
“Wow, he even stands in attention so heroically.”
“Those too. But the last ones this week were a couple of homos. Claimed to be
“Oh, but I realize”, Tony said gritting his teeth. “I realized immediately and perfectly well why you hadn’t go running and telling them.”
“Tony, he probably doesn’t even understand what you mean.”
She turned slowly. Steve was emptying the saddle bags of his Harley.
Tony being Tony, Steve hadn’t liked him much in the beginning. Tony was too loud, too vague for Steve’s precise taste, too undisciplined and civilian to be a good soldier boy in Cap’s new team. Sometimes he thought the supersoldier tolerated him with the same careful interest he would sample a potentially dangerous zoo animal. What danger Tony would represent that was only play in Tony’s own mind. A silly daydream about those angry lips, how his witty banter would turn them into a fond smile. Steve’s gaze shining with some secret inner mirth, that stiff neck bending until Tony was able to push their mouths together...
“Sam Wilson aka Falcon”, the other Steve introduced when they had all hurried inside. He reached out with his hand and Sam gave it a brief, firm sake. Mechanical wings, he thought, of course it was Sam. He remembered the science brain ex-military, who had stood in attention before him like a damn rookie. The nightmare mission which had followed; the abandoned Russian super soldier program, and the underground base full of cannibalistic monsters.
Antonio Stark was not a warrior. He had invented his armor that he had something… something new and interesting to do when he was waiting for the big C to kill him, and maybe later he had thought he could make a difference… He thought how Steve would have acted in his place and knew they considered him a coward.
The city was beautiful. All blue skies and rooftops. He let himself lean on the railing, took a cig the other Steve was holding out for him. Those first breaths of smoke almost made him feel… Almost made him hear the voices of his long dead comrades in arms, to descent back to the battlefield. But the war was over, no need to…
He talked about things like the Berlin wall, NATO, and Warsaw Pact. A new global war was in making as the former allies started to arrange the world to their images. Steve’s found his fangs were out and he had bitten his lower lip. He hadn’t lost control so badly in years, but his fear was luckily in vain, this might be a new war, but it was a cold one.
It was at the back of the place. Familiar green sparkles everywhere and freshly looking dark smudges too. Maybe they were not so dark after all, maybe they had a hue which filled him with premonition, so he took his glove off and touched one of the stains. His fingertips came out red.
“This is a five story building”, Steve was saying, while showing Sam he should start from the next level. “It probably has a basement too. Any additional information would be appreciated.”
“It's alright", Steve assured her, petting gently her arm. "Because you are so nicely asking: he is sober nowadays. No drinking, brain tumors, or whoring... Uh! Sorry, Gail. He is… well, you are right, he talks. A lot. But he is quite a funny fella. I think if you give him a chance, you will get on like a house on fire.”
They drink and ate, and even if Steve stayed quiet, that was not the way of Thor. He told him about his battles with blue-skinned frost giants, who lived in the world made of ice, and his adventures in the fiery lands of Muspelheim, and when he had enough to drink he started to talk about his family. There was his step-brother, Loki, the God of Lies. His father Odin, to whom his both sons had been disappointments. His team of warriors back home, his friends, before his father banished him to Midgard, to prove his worthiness. Ha! How to find his own worthy in this place, when most of these Midgardians didn’t know honor if it sat on their faces. Double ha! Joke was on Thor, son of Odin.
He shook his head to his own folly. He constantly forget he didn’t know anything about this world or those people. Who knows, maybe Captain America of this universe wasn’t from the 40’s like him, but had always lived in this time and ace. It could be the guy had some strange, good-paying computer job besides his superhero gig.
, Steve thought, when the blond giant squinted his eyes and bent forward to look at him, as if trying to reveal his deception.
After Iron Man joined the fight it was soon over. Maybe they really didn’t need guns around here. Not this time, anyway.
For a moment Steve was sure Tony would start to cry, but then his eyes got that hard, emotionless gleam again. He huffed a small laugh and shook his head like sorting his thoughts to their final order.
“What? My workshop couch is not fancy enough for you?”
“T-that is horrible.”
“Director Fury! We have a contact!”
That made Tony pause. The moment prolonged itself and he was about to ask, but the leader of this strange gathering got there first.
“Absolutely sure”, Tony nodded. “We moved all the tech and weapons to my workshop in Stark Tower or the SHIELD armory. There is nothing but surplus furniture and housewares. And I checked the alarms twice. There is no breach before Mr. Battling Ram broke our gate and front door. If they have moved something from their universe to ours, it is not in the mansion. It is perfectly safe.”
“I see… I ask Tony to arrange you some other model. I myself like this one but… yeah, let’s cut the crap.”
Was he giving Steve a way out? To him but not Antonio, the wording didn’t leave much room for guesswork. Now was the time to abandon that drunkard poof to his fate, the other Tony was saying, there was no way around this, the whole group had witnessed Antonio’s mishap. That was it, wasn’t it? No loyalty among soldiers… But no, maybe he shouldn’t blame them. If he had been in their position, would he had been more lenient? He had taken a vow to defend their society and laws...
Yes, please Steve. But what did Tony want?
“Twenty-eight seconds! He resisted Hulk gas twenty-eight seconds! He is a super soldier fucking supreme!”
Doctor Heller was not a cuddler. That was one reason Fury liked the man. They would get their assets back, dead or alive, and valuable information about the process. It wouldn’t do that some unknown force just snatched people and flung them away. The SHIELD needed any knowledge available about the incident to fight back if similar things happened again.
“Hold your horses, Stark. If you are going to be like that, you are not able to handle the whole package.”
He was about to poke something in Steve, alright, but he bet this mumbling mess of a man would die again, this time of embarrassment, if Steve mentioned his thoughts aloud.
Maybe he was so crap in this because it always made Antonio smile. The truth was these both future worlds just had too many buttons, lots of them with only some symbols. Some had texts, but it didn’t make it much easier. Mediaplayer. Blueray. DVD. CD. He never remembered which one was the which device.
“I wasn’t hiding. I just wanted us somewhere there are no outsides. You have a gun. Why? You said you hated guns. You hurt that woman, Steve.”
Richards’s vague stare didn’t turn into a lewd grin. He was still sure he had heard right as a rush of adrenaline from some hidden last resort tried to push his spine straighter. It was an impossible task, he was as stiff as he ever could be.
Natasha gave him a mock-condescending rub on his head. “Not in this or any other universe,
She shook her head in an admonishing way. “Why on earth do you make it sound like it is a bad thing?”
“Yes, I was. Did your miracle nose find that out?”
“I don’t want to hear it. Hopeless! Maybe we spin this around and blame a Skrull duplicate...”
“He was right. He is younger and even now more handsome, but he looks like a Stark, alright.”
A strong pull and he was upright again. His feet felt like very bad-quality rubber. He was half carried, half walked to the edge of the bed. A large cup was pushed into his hands. The straw was guided to his mouth and he sucked by the muscle memory, the taste hitting his tongue reminding him how hungry he was.
The other Steve didn’t sound like he was teasing, but he didn’t want to take a risk. And talking, that was Tony’s forte anyway. He shook his head, happy that the T-shirt he was putting on covered his expressions.
That was the only warning he got. Then those big hands were on his hips and he was lifted into the air, pushed onto the mattress and Steve was between his legs then, repeating the things Tony had done to him and inventing some of his own. Tony litany of praise didn’t cease, though, only changed its course.
There had been veteran associations canceling meetings with Captain Rogers.
Steve had heard a faint hissing sound as the door closed behind Natalia. He could now focus fully on Tony. There was that panicky smell again and a heartbeat he had heard from inside the robot which now stood without its arms besides the wall. Steve peaked in through the arm hole. “I thought a robot should be full of… I don’t know… cogwheels?”
“If the super soldier serum has altered his DNA, it is possible that his offspring would have the same abilities. An interesting but ethically complex question what Mr. Stark is raising here. But I was not thinking about that. Curtis, could you help me, please? Touch his artery, like you would search a pulse. What do you feel?”
Basic math, then. That wouldn’t have consoled Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America, who had felt his teammate and friend, Antonio Stark, to vanish from him lap, leaving behind smudges of blood and green goo Tony used to function his armor. Really, some nerdy theories of the universe were as far from Steve’s thoughts as chocolate, even if appearing in the front steps of a delicacy shop in Manhattan usually made a person focus on delights of his stomach. Steve was frantic, though. Tony’s visor broken and his lungs making that horrible rattling sound had told him his teammate’s armor had malfunctioned badly. And those Mechanoids were still firing at them when…
“Why was that?”
Talking about fan girls. Tony Stark would have only needed pom poms.
“Why… he is a cold-hearted son of a bitch who doesn’t care of casualties when he does his science thingies. I have met urban terrorists who have more honor and morals than Reed fucking Richards. Why would he care about our problems? You trust him, and believe me, something horrible will happen.”
“Alright, Tony. We can agree on that. Maybe you shouldn’t have a drink with your meds.”
That was from Captain Carol Danvers, the chief of security, who acted as an interrogation witness. That dirty traitor.
“James!”
“It was Nat’s decision”, Barnes was saying. “Her counterpart made foul things, and she didn’t want to raise bad memories in anybody. The same with Bruce. He thought eating people and lost of hundreds of lives because of Hulk was a strong enough argument against his presence here. Clint… He thought his jokes would just remind his counterpart the family he has lost.”
They seemed to be as they were, at least Stark was, unfortunately. But Fury had not been able to keep his position or his life all these years, if he had been careless.
“Nothing, Tony. I am just thinking… going to escort you to your room now. Remember? Like I used to do. Maybe we could have a drink? Talk a little? You can tell me what science thingies you have imagined during the day or all the important people you have met. You act for me the most pompous and moronic ones, and we can laugh at that.”
“How much do you really know about Project Rebirth?” Stark was saying. “We should compare notes. There could be some clues in my father’s archive. Maybe all they did for Rogers was to give him an unbelievable healing factor and custom made tiger teeth.”
, Steve had said when Janet had suggested the use of Pym particles.
“It is the same. In the trunk, the equipment are picking up faint noises, like somebody was kicking the trunk cover.”
Tony was skillful like his father. He made miracles from metal and wires and other things Steve didn’t recognize. Why didn’t he want anybody to know that he was not only behind but also inside of those wonders?
“Yes. I found them from downstairs. It is not much, but I...”
Yeah, but.
“Yes. We thought he died at war, but as the fate wanted it...”
“Antonio, listen. No don’t listen, I know there is no words now to correct this situation and Clint’s idiocy, but if you would just look at this instead.”
“S-Steve… Oh, Steve… Oh god...”
“Alright, Tony. You rest a bit. I look around.”
No ripping. Got it.
Tony snorted. “Should have known my dick is a fall of me. It was that miracle nose of yours, wasn’t it, and I like an idiot giving you a close sniff of my bodily odors. I saw how you stared at me in the meeting, dying to tell them and pester that fucking Barton in his own game. Fuck you! And your coffee!”
“This one is ready. I just towel some of that mess out of you.”
“Yes, yes… Now shut up, Captain. Let’s check those recordings and...”
Tony kicked the trousers off and did as Steve had asked. Steve was on his knees still, worshiping the smooth curve of his lover’s ass and heavy balls which were strangely hairless. Steve hadn’t known anybody else than those ladies of the night who shaved themselves down there. It was probably just a practice of this modern time, Tony hadn’t done it especially for him, but the thought of it managed to provoke Steve despite of the purpose. Steve growled and pushed his tongue inside Tony’s hole, teasing his rim and alternating sucking and pushing until Tony was only a trembling, breathless mess, who could hardly keep himself upright.
What was happening? What? Was Steve… flirting with him? Loki... Wait a minute. Loki! He was slender. And dark haired. Like Tony, haha very funny. But for a moment he had thought...
The Stark Tower was swell. More than swell. Oh if ma saw him now, in his own bathroom, in a huge bath with all these pretty, good-smelling things. She would think he had turned into a little lord.
That seemed to woke Tony up whatever stupor he was in.
“Isn’t there anyone nice in your universe?” Nat finally asked, only half-joking. “Or are you all like cynical, hard-boiled versions of our fluid morals and average goodness?”
“What do you mean?” Clint said, whitening under his mask. “The doctors said he was recovering fine. It can’t be that...”
“What do you want to eat?” she asked, noticing how he looked at her, as if wondering if this was a new way of torture.
First he thought that his sleep deprived brain had heard it wrong. The both women had strawberry red hairs and plain, freckled faces, but that was the only connection there was. The whole demeanor of Antonio’s personal assistant screamed she wanted to be invisible while at the same time she was hopelessly infatuated with her boss. But this one… She was like a battleship in heels and a pencil skirt.
Now that Captain was talking they saw something was very wrong with his teeth also. An animalistic fear shot along Fury’s spine. He should open his damn mouth and start assuring this Twilight Zone version of their national icon he was in the good old USA. They were all friends here, and not like… prey?
Tony had been poking Fury’s side for a while now. “We could… yes, we don’t have to make clones, like they have done with those prehistorical animals. If he is in such a good condition, they can have his sperm samples.”
After that surprise opening Fury needed a little break and Stark delivered. “Carol, in that other universe you got these cool superpowers and they called you Captain Marvel.”
The other Steve was already halfway to the elevators when he seemed to remember his guest. He stopped, but continued immediately, giving him a tired smirk after seeing his raised thumb.
Tony didn’t change his body language or any other language. Maybe he was a coward but not that much. He just… He talked to Steve about lifestyles, the one he labeled metrosexuality, for example. Maybe men nowadays seemed a bit effeminate to Steve, but if one looked at those powered wigs and painted faces and silk stocking of the men from the 18
Another calculating look from those eyes as daring Steve to say something more. Then the other Steve huffed and shrugged his shoulders.
“Yes, that will do nicely…” Richards mumbled, then moving his gaze as if listening to somebody outside the screen. “Yes, alright then. You can take off your clothes now, Captain.”
“For fuck’s… look around! Hurry! This is it, our ticket to the bigger circles… genuine Stark tech garage sale… Hey Jake, did you look at this guy’s face? Only Tony fucking Stark is egocentric enough to make his bum boy have a same kind of goatee… must be wild that he can imagine to fuck himself.”
“Oh him. Yes. But your uniform was much nicer, and sometimes, I think, your head catches fire.”
“I am called Black Widow”, she said, dropping the act. “We knew Hydra had you as a prisoner once, but we didn’t know about the executions. I am sorry. I told my superiors this was a bad idea.”
“You are… she is Asian.”
Steve sighed. “Yes, it gives one kind of peace of mind. I think that is the main purpose of religion, to give us hope. The thing is, I am not like you. There is no one inside me. This is me. All of it. There is nothing to control.”
Steve sighed. “I am not sacking you, Tony. Not now, anyway. You practice with us as usual, but as long as you continue drinking, you are not taking part in the missions.”
Steve didn’t know the man. Literally. He didn’t even know his first name, was about to ask for it. It would have been nice to have something to scream aloud, but then the wall started making noises of its own.
“Does he do things like that often?”
“Yeah, that was a bust, alright. Gabe had a sore throat and they have to cancel the gig, but nobody bothered to notice me. I was kind of pissed off, just left… and it wasn’t so much his throat anyway but what he had been pouring into it again.”
“Look at me”, Gail said. “I am weeping like an old fool I am. Please, Steve. Something more happy sappy. Did you and Antonio have a cake in your bachelor party? Those big ones. A stripper inside?”
It was not Triskelion, but it was certainly a military base. Even the medical staff carried uniforms. Usually that would have put Steve at ease, but now he felt only trapped. He couldn’t stay still, so he raised up to walk a tight circle in front of the plastic chairs. Three of them were occupied. The other Steve, the other Tony and Barton were also waiting to hear some news about Antonio, but the door, through which the nurse person had vanished, reminded closed. It made almost tears raise into his eyes and he squeezed his fists tighter to get that water withdraw back under his lids.
“I haven’t seen those blue movies, Tony. And I won’t. That is not fair.”
This was it. A moment they had been readying themselves for almost a year. Director Nicholas Fury’s arrival to the research lab didn’t went unnoticed as usual, there were some extra nervous glances from the scientists who were making their final check-ups.
“No, no it is nothing to do with this… I just have never thought about that possibility for my own armor work… Alright! I can think about that later… Let’s focus here! Children, be quiet, I am calling Doctor Richards now.”
Keeping secrets from the people close to you would be tiring after a while. But that was another thing Steve couldn’t hurry. Tony would reveal himself only when he was ready.
“Please, please, I don’t have anything else.”
The next ten minutes the group spent looking at the baby pictures, of all things. Fury understood it was the first born girl of that other Tony and his wife, Virginia Potts-Stark.
Natasha had come to the garage. Maybe she should borrow one of Tony’s cars. To drive a little, to get her head straight again.
He nodded. Gail had always understood him without the words. Perhaps that was why he had considered talking was so overrated. In that other universe, all had been so easy. They had been two rookie Avengers, Nomad and Heavy Metal. Nobody had cared if they were gay or not. Their marriage announcement in Twitter had gotten mostly positive attention. But here things would be different. They weren’t nobodies anymore, they were Captain America and Iron Man. Heroes of the nation. A legend made alive. And all that pressure which came with those titles.
His musing were interrupted when Tony stepped in front of him. The older man was much shorter than him, the top of his head came a little over his shoulders, but his stormy visage and taunt back added to him some extra high.
“You want to pet him?”
“Stand down, Agents”, Fury ordered. “Is that you, Rogers? What about that hipster look?”
“I don’t understand you, little one. Is that Russian? Or Ukraine? For us foreigners it is hard to know the difference.”
There was a kitchen and its cool cabinets, always full of good food. Without his metabolism and that damn gorgeous gym Steve would have been putting on more than a few pounds.
“You should buy a cat to pet”, Tony mumbled coming besides the bed. “Or are you practicing your soft touch? Don’t bother. As Barton stated, I can take it rough.”
“But… Why the hell is this happening? What is this?”
No useless feelings. But sometimes. Why not to scream, when people around you seemed to be stupid on purpose.
“Thank God, no. Sir.”
Now was not-Jake’s turn to laugh. It didn’t sound much prettier.
If Fury hadn’t known better, he would have said the sight made Rogers misty-eyed. Then he bent and kissed that other Stark on his forehead.
She didn’t do shivers. Or hysterics, or other silly emotions if they weren’t any use for her. So when she sighed, it was like a novel length confession.
“So, what you are basically saying: there is a universe where people are exact copies of us.”
She hiccuped and tried to smile. “It is still a horrible, horrible thought.”
“You bet your ass it was a mistake”, Pepper said, raising her eyebrow. “Care to explain this? Any of you?”
“Go to the shower, Tony. You will feel better afterwards. You haven’t done that for a few days, have you?”
“Totally unnecessary, darling. It will pass.”
“Never mind. Continue through the door. And alarm more guards. Nobody enters without my permission.”
Maybe there were no buts.
They were doing that, alright, and they were arguing loudly, Steve could separate the words.
“If this is a battle, you know what I do in the battles. I am going to win.”
He took the fire escape as Janet of course flied. She did some reconnaissance and found easily the right place. There were three guys, all packed up in the living room couch, watching the screen, playing probably some kind of electronic game, as Steve noticed when he smashed the window with his shield and jumped into the room.
“Don’t you try to bribe me, Steve! What is this rumor saying you were carrying a gun! You just told us in that Cosmo interview you hate guns. The roar that a certain association made after your little confession, one would think you were planning to murder their first-born children. We backed you up then, but now… Are you trying to make the team look foolish? And shooting people in public! If they had been at least bad people…”
“Oh god, Steve. You are a star pupil… alright soldier… you recon… you execute… I have to say… We usually use condoms… when we do things… like this… but… your… immunity…. Yes, just like that… oh god! You are killing me darling… yes, yes, a little more pressure… Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Darling, you don’t have to… oh god, that is my brave soldier boy… a head first to the unknown… oh! Oh! Oh! Please… careful with the teeth, love… yes, just like that… Don’t… don’t… you will gag… Oh, you don’t… oh god, so good… Steve! Steve, pull away… I can’t… I will...”
“I think so, sir.”
“Yes”, Janet said. “I can see you got it. Can you stand? At all? We have to go outside and explain this to your Steve before something worse happens.”
“Good afternoon, sir”, Steve greeted, offering his hand to shake. “Steve Rogers. Nice to meet you.”
“We realize that, Captain Rogers, but during peacetime, ripping people’s, even bad people’s throats open in front of the camera phones is not an option. If that is your thing, we can arrange some wet work activities with our black op team. They are able to find you assignments where messy is better.”
Steve didn’t leave Tony alone but for toilet breaks. Peeing with an erection wasn’t anything fun, so cold water it was, first for little Steve and then into his stomach. His insides still rumbled, not satisfied with liquid dinners he enjoyed from the tab. He was starting to feel nauseated and his gums inched as his mind raised pictures from the full cool cabinet, which was near but still two stores away.
“It is vibranium. Just like you daddy made it.”
Tony heard shuffling steps moving away. “Where did you see it the last time?”
A shrug again.
A derisive snort was a reward for her consideration.
alarm.
“I know.”
“That’s better”, the other Steve commented when he let his body settle in the parade rest. “I am no liberal, at least not in a way you meant it, so curb your fucking tongue! So… I would want that too, that world you were talking about, yes, I liked it when little girls wore blue, the color of Virgin Mary, and little boys were dressed in pink, that training version of manly red. But there is that thing, you know… Well, little or big, but it makes your arguments sound like some preacher man his hand inside underage hooker’s panties.”
It was 2019 in the future. Of course people talked to each others with the help of their walls.
After he had came out of ice, Fury had taken him to cemetery, to his parent’s graves. His brother was dead too, he had a niece who was older than him and who had not idea who he was as a person. There wasn’t anything left from his world except the flag, and Fury had acted like a greedy little boy having a surprise bag of candy. He had gorged until the bag was empty and then he had wanted some more, the SHIELD had thrown Steve into a mission after mission, and somehow every one of them seemed to be worse than the previous. It was like he was in some science experiment and a wacky doctor was testing how much he could take before he cracked. Mad cannibal supersoldiers eating each others in the abandoned Russian military base? Alright, you completed that, so how about an alien hive-minded army of robots who is going to kill all organic life on Earth and suck the planet’s core dry?
And then there had been the ice, and when the other Steve woke up...
The man didn’t look like an alien. He looked very human, but if he claimed he was not, maybe that made them the same. Thor Odinson, the God of Thunder, the man had introduced himself to Steve.
“Is that so”, Tony said and raised his eyebrow. “I have a board meeting and shitload of work I should have been doing instead of lazing in my bed.”
As a man of his word, Steve dropped his fingers on Tony’s waist and pulled his fly open.
Speaking of Tony. He should have been around. Tony lived just a few stories away from them, but somehow missed their meals and those gathering the others called the movie nights.
“If you are having second thoughts, Tony, now would be a good moment to mention about it”, Steve whispered in strangled tones. “When I’m balls deep inside your sweet tight ass, sucking you, I will become a bit grumpy for a while if I have to stop straight away.”
If it was all just one big lie, it was so skillfully made it was like magic. He shouted in surprise when the film suddenly gained color. The face behind the calm male voice was reveled. The narrator was a middle aged man, who looked like a college professor.
He buried his face against Tony’s chest and then he cried, cried like a dame in front of a man, who he had been so long in love with, even if he had actively tried to purify those thoughts from his mind.
How did people manage this constant fear of dying? How would everything cease to exist without more reason than their leaders whim and the push of the button?
He was very careful not to change the rhythm of his steps. Only his shoulders tensed, shivers going down his spine. He hadn’t forgotten those gay executions Barton had mentioned. The archer’s gleeful tone had been something he had witnessed only while dealing with the villains who had serious mental issues.
“So why not to tell them?” Steve would really like to see a look on Barton’s face when he realized how he had been badmouthing the man who had saved his hide, Steve didn’t know how many times. He hadn’t had time to watch all those videos from his tablet, but Barton seemed to have a habit to fall off the roofs.
“There is no... oh shit, he noticed me.”
That was not Tony’s usual non-flirting, that was a real thing and like a fool he fell for it. He bent down and touched carefully those waiting lips and felt how they yielded beneath him. Tony’s goatee was neat again, maybe the nurse had done that too, but he felt its raspy presence, which was so different than those softer faces of Gail or Janet. So different… so fine. Tony opened his mouth and Steve felt how something wet and careful touched his upper lip. It moved over, and Steve opened up, maybe because of surprise and cautious wonder. What it would be alike to feel Tony inside of him like that, his whole tongue, touching his, roaming inside of his mouth, searching, probing… Steve was never before kissed like that. Janet hadn’t like to kiss him and Gail had kept her lips closed like he himself had done. Maybe he had seen people kissing open mouthed in the movies, and that had felt… odd, to but it mildly. It looked like it couldn’t be pleasant, but it was, how it was!
Steve called his name but Tony didn’t react. He didn’t know what else to do, so he climbed into the bed besides Tony, wrapped him into his duvet and his arms, whispering nonsense into his neck hair until Tony calmed down. He didn’t dare to move away in case the nightmares started again. Some time later Tony turned to face him and his breath on Steve’s cheek, his warm body in Steve’s embrace made him painfully hard again. But this wasn’t about sex. That was about what Tony needed right now, so Steve bit his lip and suffered and wasn’t it the sweetest suffering of them all.
“Too bad my sobriety support person is now in another dimension. So, Fury. If you want to vet something, you can start with that. He or she will be spying for you anyway.”
building in Berlin, and it could have been better only if it had been their stars and stripes. He watched with a grim satisfaction as the great German cities lay in ruins after Allied bombings. Steve felt no sympathy for those wretched people. You reap what you sow. There it was again, the main reason of his cold anger, the concentration camps, skeletal bodies, dead women and children, and for what, for the glory of the Fatherland? Nice looking glory, built on the bones of the children of Abraham.
“Sure. We take turns. Tony’s butler, Jarvis. He is getting old, and… alright. I shut up now. Enjoy your meal.”
“Oh. It was that. For science. I thought it was just…”
Steve started to cry.
That made Anthony yelp and push his fingers towards his ears. “I didn’t hear that shameful number! But yes, for the record, it was quite a party. Say what, how about we keep a rerun here. The after party! Or actually after after… I lost the count. Or we could unite it with our welcoming party.”
“No”, Steve snorted. “And could you stop that huffing and puffing? Sir. This was baby-sitting job for your rookies, and it turned out to be very educational, but as you stated yourself they are not our prisoners but guests. Ambassadors as you put it, able to come and go as they please... Hopefully, just not mangling our colleagues in process. Clint is alright?”
As usual, Fury’s gut had been right. This
“Congratulations!”
“Oh, sorry. This is not a movie like before, but a telephone call with a picture.”
But this had not been an airplane. It should be alright. It would still hurt, thought, but the pain was an old friend of his, sometimes when he had secretly watched Tony’s fight with his illness he had even welcomed it for himself too, like doing that would take some of his loved one’s agony away.
Now the not-Jake grabbed Tony’s hand and raised it up, and a flash of pain almost made him faint again.
“Is that… is this a joke? Fury, you can’t be joking. You have no sense of humor.”
Fury was taking a stand to orientate himself, but Stark was of course minding nothing about it. “Director, I hope you realize talking like that to two gay men is a crappy way to present yourself.”
Fury wondered those teeth. How they were so white, when the lower portion of its face was smudged with blood. Bruce’s blood.
“Copy that, Agent Taylor. The subject’s vehicle is continuing their designated trail, as expected according the coordinates of their GPS device.”
She put her head down and looked now sadder than ever. “I…”
One look at Curtis’s amazed and fearful face told him that was the case.
“No guns. Now, SteveToo, you play nice. No attacking any of us. We may look like people you know, but believe me, we are strangers. As you can guess, I am Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America. That lady you seem to have a beef with is called Natasha Romanoff, Black Widow. She is indeed a former Russian citizen, started her career here as a Russian spy, but she is part of our team now, a trusted teammate and a friend, and even if she weren’t that shouldn’t be you problem. Is that clear?”
“That is quite impressive list”, Clint started to say when Natasha’s angry gaze stopped him. Maybe now was not a good time for bad jokes. “Nat… if you could leave? Seeing you seems to agitate him only further.”
He shook his head. The other Steve left, shadowed by Barton, who tried to make him guess which snacks he had preferred. He was in the waiting room together with Tony, who was assessing him with a calculating look. The man had no armor on, just a business suit and those prancing orange hued glasses he probably didn’t need. Even he had heard of contact lenses and laser surgeries.
This was terrible. This was worse than the fear of the bomb, which he could get used to, but this, this was too much.
That gained her a tired smirk and some feeble attempts to sit up on the bed. Janet hurried to give her assistance.
“No need to stop for that, Nat”, the leader of the team advised. “We are doing this in an old-fashioned way. You all know that only sissy boys use parachutes. Happy landing!”
Steve noticed he had started laughing. It turned soon an uncontrollable double giggle fit, as the other Steve joined in his burst of mirth. This was… maybe he had missed just this, this rude and honest and playful soldier talk. Camaraderie and dirty jokes.
The other Steve hushed them. God, he wouldn’t hope his Barton’s faith even to his worst enemy, to lose his family like that was down right horrible, but why didn’t the archer just shut up! He really didn’t understand how anybody could be that dishonorable… like those damn Russians. It had been so strange. Before he had gotten into the ice, the Russians had been their trusted allies. Now they were not. Their Romanoff had despised all that was American, accusing them for her nation’s demise.
“It is pretty, but not an apple worth of Iðunn, the Goddess of Youth, the keeper of the golden apples of Asgard. Here! Take more of this fine wine, Warrior Monster! I like a man who can drink his share.”
They had stopped near the metal table on which the male body was lying. It was wearing a faded uniform pants, combat boots, and a ruined leather jacket. Under those mundane items, though, there was that famous star chested uniform top Howard had designed for him. Bullet proof, or at least as much as the genius inventor from the 40s could manage. The letter A could still be seen on a bluish colored helmet, made of metal and that strange material Howard had used for the chest piece.
“No Tony, you smell fine.”
“Yes, Steve. It is not like Clint’s, and you trying to push through it… not a good idea. You know it will hurt badly.”
He had tried to make a hasty U-turn, but that hadn’t gone so well either. “You are stupid”, he said, tapping a still half-hard organ. “Stupid and mean little Tony.”
As proved, he had the impulse control of a three-year-old. He pushed his hands under the pillow, a proper punishment for him to make Steve feel uncomfortable. Then he tried to watch some TV, but it was really hard to concentrate. Maybe he was getting better because he hadn’t had so insistent boner after his teenager years (his increasing alcohol consumption tampering things radically.) Yes, alcohol. He hadn’t had even one tiny drink… was it really eight days now? And if he really thought which one was more damaging…
The thing had killed Bruce, but not because of meal. Now when Fury had calmed down and considered the situation, he admitted Captain had attacked like a soldier thinking he was surrounded by his enemies.
“Unlike the son of Howard Stark”, he derided. “Who just have to cover what he is doing from his superiors.”
“Never mind.” For his surprise she really seemed to mean that, even gave him an impish smile. “Your Janet never used Pym particles like this?”
After some time the water stopped. “Alright, that is enough. Soldier, on your feet. Don’t make me carry the naked you anywhere.”
“I, my friend, am a billionaire genius. I want some nice things, I do them, or pay somebody else to do them for me… Yes, as you see, Steve”, he continued to Steve-not-sitting. “Your double has been like that from the beginning... he is totally delusional. What do you think, buddy of mine, you don’t have a secret evil twin? No? If this is a clone to infiltrate our team, they have surely done crappy job about it.”
Maybe he could manage that question if he thought very hard she was meaning home repairs. But of course not. Was this really a good time for his mind to browse stupid memories from his childhood? There had been a birthday card for his mother, her praising his talent to his father who had given him an amused look with a conspiratorial wink. Yes, he had instinctively known that drawing and painting were the tasks better left for girls and women, let them watercolor their little notebooks and write their poems...
Maybe he was. He hadn’t even ordered to dress them in those orange jumpsuits. They were both wearing the SHIELD sweats: gray pants and white T-shirts with logos.
“You don’t have to apologize. And you don’t have to call me ma’am, Janet will do nicely. You have to excuse our Steve, he was still hyped up from the fight with those zoo escapees. He get sometimes a little rambunctious. Steve has this sensitive artistic side but the rest… Do you paint by the way?”
The glass let out another pitiful squeak, growing weaker. The thing gave them a triumphant smirk and raised its fists again. Fury was expecting the worst, but in the middle of the motion Captain fell sideways and slumped on the floor.
Like the other Steve had read his mind. Next fifteen minutes he just ate, trying not to wolf it down. There were also scrambled eggs and breakfast muffins and toast and bacon and some tiny sausages… it was so much everything and it smelled and tasted so delicious. He had eaten fancy dinners when the Ultimates were asked to visit some party or other, but this wasn’t like that, it was god honest good food, like the one he got when he visited Gail and Bucky. He had always thought that the secrets of home made meals were one of those things only women were aware of, but what the heck. The other Steve worked like a chef. He himself could make beans and tomatoes, and maybe macaroni and cheese. When he had finally learned how to operate his microwave oven, he had gained more variation for his diet. Those instant dinners didn’t taste particularly good, though. If these Avengers took turns, it had to mean that the other Tony was a chef too. He tried to envisage Antonio with an apron over his fancy suit, making smashed potatoes and gravy, but his imagination failed him miserably.
The others were nodding, and Steve felt maybe a faint relief. Anything was better than the glass jar with its talking, spying walls. But wait a minute? In Stark Tower? Like with Tony?
“Some four miles. We can call Nat, but that will take her out of the search of those other leads, and if this will prove to be a bust… I fly over 40 mph. We would be there in five minutes.”
“Sir?”
Steve didn’t like that teasing smile and annoyingly handsome face. The combination had always made him horny. “And if I wasn’t? Why would I want any consolation from one of the people who keeps me as a prisoner?”
He almost smiled at that. Alright. While they were introducing themselves… “Can I ask, who are you, ma’am?”
“Moronic enough?” he asked, stepping in front of Clint, who suddenly tried to push himself inside the wall. “If things I care about, people I love are in danger, I am not moronic, I am damn lethal and resourceful, and I will fight without any mercy until my opponents are dust or I myself fall on the ground, dead as a door nail. You should know that, and you idiot just had to arrange so we have no idea if they are perpetrators or victims in this situation.”
“Yes, but it is not dangerous of anything. It is all over Tony every time. He needs it to function his suit.”
It was actually a sensible explanation. He wasn’t going to admit his acceptance to Stark, so it was convenient they were interrupted by a loud and annoyed roar which always forewent smashing of things. Usually something expensive.
“Yes, and I thank you, Captain. Sue does what she can with me, but sometimes I need a little extra nudge. Give your clothes to Tony. He will get them delivered to Baxter Building immediately and we can get to work.”
Steve observed as Fury’s brow climbed on his forehead until it almost reached the hairline.
“About your other question. Yes, we found the body too. He was still grasping that shield in his hand like it would be able to save his hide, the poor bastard.”
That made Stark shut his mouth. They descended the stairs and came at the other door. There were two armed agents, but they saluted and stepped aside when Fury and Stark entered the front room of the lab, where they put on the same gear Doctor Banner and his crew were wearing.
century, Mr. Rogers. How about… I would like to stuff my mouth full of that first grade meat, but that means I can’t talk… what a dilemma… maybe I handle it while I am pondering this matter… if I took a firm grip of things… like this… thank god for my long fingers, darling, you have quite a girth… yes, I think we are making good progress… oh, look at that, hello there, do you have something in your eye, you are leaking awful much… maybe… we have better examine that it is nothing serious… how about if I lick it like this… yes, definitely, maybe some more samples…. Mmm…. Yes, this is it, this is what I have been looking for my dusty old cellar… Darling, I will bottle you up, you are vintage… if your precome is like that, what a wonder the main course will be like… maybe if I lick a little bit of this… and little bit of that… and slide my fingers over here… oh yes, so tight, like two coconuts… should I explore further…”
Her back was against the door. Her legs had given away from fright and she was sitting on the floor, pushing her hands forward, a laughable attempt to keep away a man who just the other day had pummeled himself halfway through triple reinforced safety window.
“Steve is from the same period. Hell, Steve is him and he took Tony’s heavy flirting like nothing.”
Yes, Steve knew. It was impossible to get anything out of Barton without a childish innuendo. So he asked if Banner could somehow persuade Tony to come to watch a movie with them.
Tony shivered like coming out from the cold. “Figures”, he huffed. “Alright. Out with it.”
“There is that”, Steve admitted. “If there is no shady purpose, why of all the addresses in the City they chose 890 Fifth Avenue?”
“Tony…” Pepper sighed. “Alright, you play with two Steves and the PR-team and I try to sort this mess as usual. And the floor. We have to order new tiles for the upstairs again. What have I said about flying inside the house? Just in emergency.”
“No”, Steve admitted.
“Steven Grant Rogers”, the man nodded as a greeting. “Well, Natalia... May I call you Natalia?
“Yes, because that guy is so in tune with his artistic side. Did he look like some pansy to you?”
Had Rogers been always that morbid? No, he was smirking, or maybe he was smirking at the Stark who was not dying of cancer.
“You… you speak English?” she managed after some long minutes, when the monster, the man didn’t seem to come any closer. “
Richards sounded honestly perplexed.
The monster spoke for the first time. His voice was raspy, like after a long speech, when there was no water bottle beside the microphone.
“You have taken something that doesn’t belong to you. Where is the guy whose armor you stole?”
“Lube… in the nightstand. Please, Steve.”
Something in her mind made Gail giggle. “What?”
That was only a rhetorical question of course. Those precise measuring devices which the science team had attached to the both men were notifying Rogers was telling the truth. Or at least the truth as he knew it.
He gritted his teeth so hard it made his jaw jump. What a shrew! He had nothing against a lady speaking her mind, her mother had been quite a strong personality, but these modern women, they seemed only speak out of turn. No wonder this future world was going to shit everywhere he looked. This was too fucking familiar, he really didn’t appreciate the way both Janets were belittling him, yapping and moaning about their personal things like some drunken sows. Never mind that, whatever he said about anything was always wrong too.
“I don’t know. This parallel stuff is quite vague. Our Tony isn’t like that other guy, right? So maybe he doesn’t have to be exactly like our Steve. Maybe he is shy. He is from the 40s. They got this thing called chastity that time.”
“Good boy, not leaving me to race the stairs like the last time! Move that America’s ass… oh god, so sorry. It is you.”
“Yes, thank you Captain Danvers. Now, if we could return to our main theme. You can tell me more about this training you got.”
“You are still with us? Good. Now tell us how do we open this thing.”
“Yes, darling. I know. Like you always say. What the A in your helmet stands for. Not for France.”
The billionaire genius had kept his visor up, so Steve saw how his features sank, his big brown eyes got a vacant look. Tony seemed to be deep in thought, and more than a tad worried.
They were hardly inside the building, and Steve was just about to sling himself into the nearest body and start pummeling some answers out of it, when a shining net of something circled the place he was standing. It let him move a few yards around, keeping itself some twenty inches from his body.
How about asking some hundred millions? People always thought the end result, not the man hours or money that was used for design work and materials and the whole production process. There was no power to escape their touches. Communications didn’t work either, he couldn’t call for help. No computer to tell him how badly he was injured or what was going on, but he would take an educated guess. He had been hurt in the battle. Maybe he had landed too far from their battlefield that the Ultimates hadn’t been able to locate him first, and these scavengers had had a lucky break.
So he was able to heal himself as well as Steve. Why wasn’t Stark all over him?
Ominous silence. And then again a tell-tale hiss of the fuse.
Steve had to snort at that. “Well, we will see about it. The history is written by the winners. That can lead to unexpected results. The good will or heart doesn’t matter, even bravery is not enough, if you don’t have power to back it off.”
And that didn’t sound ominous at all. He smiled stiffly and nodded, still pretending he had no idea what was implied. “You think there will be consequences?”
This was a uniform for a war. Was that it? The USA was in the war again and he was called to do his duty?
“I didn’t explain that part?”
“Except...” he said slowly. “I just remembered something. There is this big walk-in safe in my old workshop, my father used to keep there his prototypes and plans. The door is enough to withhold a regular burglary, but Steve and his shield and his mighty muscles… if he really wants in, all he had to do is smash the concrete around the door, it is not a bank vault.”
The rest of the sentence was buried somewhere under his fist. While Anderson junior slumped backwards, he took a grip from his shirt front, pulled the guy toward him and knocked his nose out of its normal place with his helmet-covered forehead.
She let out a brief giggle. “My first time.”
“Steve! I was just… no, that was a dream. Did Gail gave you her dessert?”
Their tussle had devastated the room but the rubble was removed like Thor had asked and Steve got a new bed, a table, and two chair. Steve was lying on his bed. Maybe he had a hangover, maybe not, but he was not prone to imagine things, so it had to be real. The wall across from his bed had became alive, and he didn’t mean like it had made itself a human form like Pinocchio. No, it was more like in a movie theater.
“Antonio…”
“Jesus, Rogers. Look at all those cameras go. I think we broke Twitter.”
Tony took a cup, and really, it looked like some kind of pudding. He tasted it and saw how Steve eyes moved to somewhere under his jaw as he swallowed. Was Steve smelling… cigarettes for some reason?
That seemed to take Steve back. “So… it is really no then? The other Steve said maybe I understood it wrong.”
And under all that cynical smartassness… but he had seen it before. All the time when he was alone with Tony, his patient explanations, his admiring looks when he thought Steve didn’t notice. His sassy non-flirting, the sharp flashes of teeth which melted into soft and melancholic smiles when he turned them towards Steve.
Home. Steve wouldn’t have called it like that. It wasn’t Triskelion or the mansion Tony had reserved for Ultimates’s use.
Doctor Octopus?
There was talk about how the team operated. Steve was showed films about their battles. It was really confusing. Those people… most of them looked at least as enhanced as Steve, and he wondered could there be others like him, hiding under their masks while participating in this costume play.
He was shaking again. God, was he any different from a homeless wino? He was just used to drink his poison from the fancy glasses, not from some paper bagged bottle at a cold street corner.
“Pepper! We just talked about you. Did you smell the coffee?”
She listened and then a small, sharp smile jerked the corner of her mouth. “Yes… Give us the nephew. I have a hunch, and I think Steve would appreciate to talk with him himself.”
Not particularly, no. But what else there was to do? He was too restless to play cards, and he didn’t want to agitate the other Steve by winning. Or himself by losing.
“My Bucky”, he started. “He… when they thought I was dead, Bucky and my fiancee Gail, they found each others. They have been married over seven decades now.”
The hammer moved in Steve’s fist. The thing yanked forward, tearing him from his feet. He was too stubborn to let go, so he was dragged across the floor towards Thor and his waiting hand.
Fury had known that headache was coming.
“Great! My comrades in arms, bring forward the shield of Captain! NO! Bring it forward! I said all the weapons. Do you want to make Thor, son of Odin, a liar? Do you want to make him your enemy?”
Tony was still lying on the bed, but Steve wasn’t beside him anymore, not kneeling like some prince waking his Sleeping Beauty. His knees were next to Tony’s hips, he was bent down, supporting himself with his arms not to crush the smaller man under him. Tony’s clever hands were now massaging his thighs, his thumb wiping over his groin like by accident. Steve was uncomfortably hard already, leaking precum to his underwear, his breath shallow and his eyes squeezing shut, when Tony’s fingers were getting bolder. He was touching Steve’s cloth covered member, and soon Steve forget he had been kissing, he could only tremble helplessly on all fours as those fingers were taking a better grip and started moving up and down along his length. Steve was like a spellbound, he couldn’t have moved away from those touches if his life depends on it.
“Sure, if you like those surfer types. Blond, muscular, tall… much like me actually. I would have to be narcissist to be in his fan club. And overall, I have always found his brother Loki more eye-pleasing.”
“You know”, Banner said, giving him a timid smile. “You are not exactly bad looking, and Tony is… he is like a magpie. A brilliant science bro, but as a person… You are really alright? He didn’t poke any needles in you? You didn’t see any strange equipment?”
...and there he went again. Couldn’t he keep his stupid mouth in check even five minutes? For his astonishment Steve didn’t show him an angry glow but seemed to give the thought some serious consideration.
“Well, I had a choice between myself and you, and you know me, buddy. Always so vain, of course I chose me.”
That made giant’s visage darken. “It is often so, I am afraid”, he sighed, a brief hurt dimming his shining eyes. “My brother hates me for that same reason. But a man should not be remembered because of the deeds or failures of his kin. It is his own deeds which should matter.”
“What are you talking about? He left for his road-trip, I watched through the security cam how that sexy, jeans-clad behind embraced the saddle of his motorbike… He should be in Philly already.”
What the hell was going on?
Steve saw no problem in that. When Ralph passed a proper weight limit, they would eat him. But for that proposition Clint looked he was about to feint, and Bruce didn’t seem happy either. Steve learned new things every day, and that day’s lesson was people in the future ate meat, but were squeamish when they started to think where it came from.
“What everloving… Is that guy for real? That was the worst case of gaypanic I have seen for ages. But why did they run? Did he get scared we would punish them for pummeling that idiot? What the hell kind of universe are they from?”
“That is… I am sorry to hear that”, the other Steve said. Always so damn decent. “I wonder if there is a universe somewhere in which all Tony Stark’s major organs work fine… I am going to check the nurse. If she had some news how the operation is going. Do you want something from the canteen?”
“Barton...”
“When I thought Bucky was dead… Well, I have to say even my drawing blocks or books didn’t help that much. They gave me no big understanding why my friend had died and I have to admit, I went wild for a while”, the other Steve said quietly. Even the memory of those months of sorrow seemed to be appalling for him. “One can say I fucked my way to the Ardennes. Sometimes it is really hard to keep a straight face when somebody says his grandfather was with me somewhere.
about ten times because of that old limey bastard. No wonder our Steve started to fancy Stark. They are two nice speaking gents.”
Alright. If he was honest, there was no actual reason why Steve couldn’t be nicer to his teammates, ease his grumpy ways, and overall be more co-operative. He should listen to his team’s suggestions, which hadn’t been all bad. Maybe if he started with changes in his own behavior, some good things would follow.
After his resurrection, he had seen and experienced all kind of strange things, but if he was honest with himself, this one almost got him to shit himself. Had Janet suddenly turned into a giant? That was a very human and natural first thought, but then he saw those just as big cars, brick walls which seemed to stretch to the skies. She hadn’t grown, it was him who had gotten smaller, turned into an insignificant ant, which Janet was now trying to shake off from her glove. He took a grip, even bit his teeth around the leather, trying not to fall...
Maybe Fury should hire them out as a comedy group.
Steve glimpsed at the door. Tony hadn’t come in while he was occupied with the conversation. Keeping his movements in minimum, he turned his head there and here trying to find the origin of the smell. It took a few minutes, but then he detached a single muted heartbeat from inside the automaton.
Tony snorted. He was lying down on the bed now, not seducing but like a sneering sacrificial lamb. “How magnanimous of you. Well, aren’t you coming?”
Except in Korea. In Vietnam. And in some other places the narrator mentioned but Steve couldn’t see in his mind. Either of the new superpowers didn’t start anything final, however, because both of them had now
“You didn’t get an invite?”
NEXT ON DECK: The Avengers Steve/Tony story, starting here:
Were handshakes in the future supposed to last that long?
“Give me your hand”, Tony said, touching the back of his hand. “Come on, big guy. Do that to please Uncle Tony.”
“Hawkeye, what are you doing? Laying eggs? Take a shot already.”
The funding and search were still going strong, as this turn of events suggested. They were ready, but unlike the general public, who still wished to see their heroes alive, Doctor Heller had poured cold water on those hopes so repeatedly they had been soaking wet and cold for months now.
The Avengers tiptoed around Steve, which was understandable. He had tried to kill them, Romanoff even several times. After a few days they had moved Antonio from the hospital to Stark Tower, so meeting the team could not be avoided. Those meetings were fortunately brief, and most of the time he was in Antonio’s room anyway.
“No, of course not! I would never forget a vintage death ray, they are so cool! You remember, when you woke from ice, how you felt a little lost and we tried to cheer you up by finding all kind of things from the 40s?”
Thanks for reading/leaving kudos & awesome comments!
“No, it is just… I don’t know how it works, but Antonio uses it to operate his suit.”
at a time. “The other Steve said he looked completely different.”
“Do we have a welcoming party for those losers, Tony?”
, if I hadn’t had my lady-love.”
That was Stark’s silver tongue at its best. Those hoarse, whispered reassurances that it would be alright, if Steve just left Tony here. Dying alone when he had just found him. What a silly suggestion.
darkness, the fact that Antonio Stark pissed himself because of pain while somebody carried him here… helping, the guy had said he was helping, but it hurt, hurt so much.
At least there was a tent on Tony’s sweats. Precum had made a cloth dark, and thinking it was him who had made that happen, while coming all over Tony’s hand and body, was a heady thought, enough to make him hot and bothered all over again.
The door opened. Banner entered the corridor and Steve went after him, and just like that, he was out of his cell first time what had to be weeks.
Tony Stark, CEO of Stark International. Or a spoiling pus in his ass, as Director Fury of the SHIELD called the man. Anyway, there he was, fresh as a fortysomething daisy and yapping how Fury’s call had disturbed his beauty sleep. Not that he would have needed any. The man was a drunkard or if one wanted to get clinical, he had owned serious substance abuse problems his whole adult life, but in spite of his lifestyle, he was still pretty. Oh God, how he was rakish, rich, and genius and knowing it too well himself. His good fortune didn’t make him humble and grateful, as said, a spoiling pus in an ass, which this time happened to be Fury’s.
“There is this other dead giveaway about vampires”, Anderson continued. “If he were a vampire trapped in the ice for seven decades, his magic storage would be very low. He should be starving, if using human concepts is allowed in this case. His first and only priority would be to gorge himself with his victim’s Qi energy, and that didn’t happen.”
What a delicious thought. No, Antonio. Stop it. Focus. Focus!
“Sir, maybe you have noticed some differences. Tony has been sober over seventeen months.”
Steve had hit his fist on the bench so strongly he made metal tent.
“Please”, Janet snorted pushing the button to shut the doors quicker. “You standing there eyeballing me! Our Steve would have already thrown me upside down onto one of his mighty shoulders and tickled the life out of me.”
“Tony, I already took my shirt off for you once. Remember? Don’t be so greedy.”
“Your dick… your teeth in me… Steve, please. Hurry!”
“Steve…” Antonio said and now he started to sound worried. Maybe he thought like those Avengers that he would be triggered by any worse word. Maybe he would, and what would then happen? Would he break the wall? Break Tony? Start to cry like some dame?
“You condescending bastard!” A pillow was thrown on his head and then Tony was in his lap. His lips landed on his face and a firm grip locked around his neck and head. He kissed Steve’s cheek and mouth, dragged his lips over his jaw. His tongue stabbed the faint gap between his lips, demanding the entrance. Steve’s breathing accelerated. He wanted nothing more than open up for Tony, but he concentrated on exhaling and inhaling through his nose.
Steve didn’t think so. He had already met Virginia Potts, and she had radiated strength and calm. She was a woman who knew how to stand in the eye of the storm. She had been a true friend to Tony, just like Steve’s Peggy had been during the wartime.
The door closed. He was left alone in the good-sized and comfortable looking room, so unlike his own dreary residence in Brooklyn. Not this Brooklyn, if this universe had that neighborhood, but… He had a fleeting thought what he would lose if they got stuck in here, and it wasn’t much. Not for him anyway. Antonio, though, would be pissed off. No luxurious penthouse or silken dressing gowns or anything nice he had used to take for granted. Only what these stranger were ready to give them.
“No way! Sounds like a bunch of hunk dancers or something.”
“Fury”, Banner was saying. “I think he can hear you. Hi there”, Banner greeted. Before Fury had time to react, the idiot was besides the table again. “You gave us quite a fright. Captain Rogers? Is that you?”
Steve had to smile at that. “I can’t remember you being ever this discreet.”
“Ma’am?”
Danced so much. With Antonio. And nobody had cared. Steve glimpsed at the dance floor. He had delivered Mayor’s wife to her husband and lurked then to the bar, hogged a several glasses of water, while Tony had been surrounded by businessmen and their supermodel girlfriends or perhaps they were their daughters.
That traitorous skank! A woman who had made her cronies kill Clint Barton’s wife and kids, stood there, smiling at Steve, like Clint had never nailed her ass on the wall with his arrows.
Steve’s cheeks got that tell-tale hue again. “Yes, that was why… she said… I am...”
“Oh, that. It seems when Doctor Richards is not wasting his time acting like a megalomaniac douchebag, he wastes his time exploring the universe and inventing all kind of useful things. They just microversed the tumor out of existence. Too bad. I already named it Anthony. Like a son I will never have. Oh dear. I would have been a crappy father anyway.”
The man opened his jumpsuit and took something small and pinkish from his chest. It was a tiny piglet.
He couldn’t blame Tony who had just been himself. When Tony had been more lucid after his operation, Steve had tried to explain their situation and it seemed Tony had understood. The SHIELD putting them into the cell would have make more sense to Steve, but Fury of this universe probably deemed them helpless. And he were so fucking right. They had no means of transportation. No weapons, no communications, backup or even a proper plan. If he had been bendy enough, he would have kicked himself in the ass. He had made his quiet reconnaissances for a few days now, waiting for the right opportunity, but Barton and his ghoulish jokes had made him lose it.
Steve-on-the-floor, like he too suddenly thought himself, went still as all those questioning and curious and amused faces turned to evaluate him. “He is…” Steve-on-the-floor started, his voice raspy because of his dry mouth. “Antonio, he is younger than you. He got blue eyes, not brown, and olive skin, and he…”
The other Tony chuckled. And he had thought that Barton fellow was the only sadistic bastard of this group. “Oh yeah”, Iron Dickhead said, licking his lower lip. “It really seems you guys have some fight ahead. If it is hard or not, I think that depends solely on you, Captain.”
“All right, soldier”, he sighed. “From the beginning. Take your time, and Stark”, Fury added when the man was about to say something, “you let Rogers speak or the guards will escort you outside.”
“I don’t know yet, but let’s go upstairs and find out.”
She was up at the same moment he was on her. Her knife pushed against the skin over his collarbone, his organic twin blades at the same place on her neck.
“I hope I didn’t take your favorite”, he said politely. What he wanted to ask was of course about Antonio, but maybe if he waited after some chitchat and breakfast he would gain better results. He was not very patient and smooth person to begin with and even less so when hungry.
Tony lurched. Fury took his elbow when it first seemed he would fall down. “Oh my god!” he mumbled. “Oh my god! Fury, we have to go there. We have to… I have to study it. This would be...”
Everything seemed to stop around them. Conversations, clicking of the glasses, even the dancers gave them room until Steve and Tony were in the middle of the floor. “I will lead”, Steve said under his breath and Tony nodded. They were halfway through the song until Tony was able to utter proper words again.
“Bruce can’t die, you idiot. He managed a gamma bomb explosion. Big Green will take care of him.”
Natasha snorted unladylike to that idea. “How about we pick up that one who doesn’t want me dead?”
“I was… still am. We were sweethearts even before the army. Not openly, of course, not then. He was found afterwards. Brainwashed by Hydra, missing his left arm. But… it got better. We are married now.”
They were on it already. The logic said the perps wouldn’t have wanted to carry their load far; it should mean that the other Tony was somewhere here, downstairs. But on the other hand, maybe they had been smart and transported him further, someplace he wouldn’t be able to crawl out and call for help.
“What? Are you both turning into mad scientists? Doctor Banner, what is it? Don’t say you are considering...”
“Cosmetic… we are a little better armored than an average vintage tank.”
“It is not that Stark hadn’t give them lots of material during the years. There had to be at least half a dozen leaked sex tapes of that guy, and believe me Cap, all of them are not vanilla. No wonder he got exited. No disrespect, but those fangs of yours might have given him ideas.”
Sam made gestures like he was sawing Tony’s neck and arms. The mental image made him almost hurl. Great, probably his concussion had a concussion. He couldn’t breath more than tiny sips because of the pain, and they wanted him to raise his hand to his chest, to push the emergency switch.
Then he came. Just like that. Maybe it was because he hadn’t had a drink for over a week now, or maybe those nice people very giving him some superviagra with his meds. Steve had pulled out when Tony had asked, but he got still lots of cum on his face. Lucky for him, no eye infections for supersoldiers. He didn’t look overly crossed either.
“I am sorry”, Steve said, because he really was. That was one thing he didn’t miss from the past, those nasty, waggling tongues of people who wouldn’t mind their own business. “That must have been rough.”
“Sir, he was a corpse”, one of the technicians explained. “We didn’t…”
“Tony left you this”, the other Steve said when he had finished the breakfast. It seemed to be a smartphone. Or not-so-smart-phone as he called those devil’s spawns in his mind. They had million things inside of them and they were all in a way if he wanted to make or take a simple call.
“Open it up for us. Do it, or I will mash your pretty little face and take it anyway. We can always empty your armor like a soup can.”
“No”, Sam said ambiguously. “Do you have a new phone? I think the couch is vibrating.”
“My adoptive father, you mean. First he acquired me to be a stand-in for his beloved but sick biological son and then he replaced me with a ghost of the one perfect son the poor Howard never was able to get despite of all his wealth and earthly goods. This it too hilarious. Hi there, brother superior. Look at him, Fury! He doesn’t even look dead. It is like he is sleeping. Thank God my father is not alive. He would cream him pants and embarrass us all acting like a little fan girl.”
“See what, Steve”, Natasha said quietly. “You tried to shoot me, and when the bullet from your gun hit some innocent civilian you seemed to mind nothing about it. Tell us what we don’t see, when our trusted leader is suddenly behaving like a part of his brains has been removed and the rest of it dipped in 90 percent vodka.”
Romanoff nodded and gave him a tight-lipped smile.
“Just like that?”
She went death still. Nothing happened, though, except the man continued. An accusatory tone of his voice made her flinch inside: “You are not like that poor boy. You are one of them.
“Oh shit, bro! Don’t you watch those entertainment news, they will rot your brain. Rich people screw around. They take what they want when they want it. What if Stark wants to keep bum boys on the side? You think that lady says anything about it when she has now gotten her greedy fingers inside his wallet? No, she will keep her mouth shut like a good little rich bitch and buy something nice. You remember those sex tapes a few years back? Everyone has seen that little Tony, it is nothing unusual. If that guy had no money he would have no reputation. Or what do you say bum boy? Is your daddy good in the sack? Five stars out of five?”
They all turned to stare at the being. Its helmet had been removed so there was plenty of that wheat-golden hair to see, but otherwise it showed fair skin, no even stubble on its face. No extra hair anywhere.
Steve would have wanted to. Oh how he wanted, there was no concealing his hard-on in his tight sport pants. “You should sleep.”
It was both eerie and reassuring to see her friend’s face looking so kind again. Steve noticed something was bothering her and his handsome visage froze as he scanned the garage quickly to detect a possible threat. Not finding anything, Steve continued his unpacking.
“You took your time.”
“Fury will want us to make an official statement before the press.”
NEXT ON DECK: Peter Stark is nineteen and in need of a boyfriend who will not end up dead in the hands of his enemies. Enter Spiderpool! (With Irondad, Superhusbands, and the usual Avengers mayhem.) https://archiveofourown.org/works/25614553
“I am missing something”, Steve mused. “I though they think Iron Man is a hero.”
“Of course, Antonio.”
The elevator binged, coming to the upper lever. One flight of stairs and they would be outside as he remembered from his previous journey. Had it been only yesterday? He took a quick glimpse from the corner of his eye to the woman who was now giving him the same airs as his Janet when he said or did something that made her call him insensitive or stupid, old-fashioned oaf.
“He was then... how close?”
Steve liked a guy who knew his own mind. That lube thing let out a faint apple smell. It felt cold and slippery as Steve rubbed it between his fingers. A coarse gun grease or vaseline would have been out of place here in Tony’s fine bed.
“I heard enough. What the hell now, Clint? I came to introduce myself to our guest and… Have you lost your everloving mind? If that was supposed to be a joke, it was so extremely bad taste I don’t find the words! You know there are still countries where shit like that can really happen.”
Fat chance. First came Natasha who was able to make one of her famous rodeo jumps. Before anybody knew it, she was riding on SteveToo’s shoulders and hitting his head with all her considerable skill and power. Those thighs were deadly weapons when they were around your neck, and SteveToo’s breathing started soon to sound funny. He tried but couldn’t swat her away while the Avengers team leader was keeping him busy with his kicks and hits.
Natasha didn’t stay to look how Steve managed. “Out! Out of the way!” she shouted while running, knowing Steve couldn’t be badly hurt, his reflexes and agility were not quite as good as Spider-Man’s, but enough that his misstep would only slow him down. Natasha run and blessed her wide helms and her comm which Tony had made to look like an ordinary Bluetooth device with a range to match the best satellite phones.
Did she wink at him? Was this Janet also interested in vintage super soldiers? Making doll-faces at him because Steve of her universe was already taken? Oh God, now he himself started to sound like some ladies’ entertainment novel. Luckily, that thought was wiped away when Natasha opened the hatch door again and the wind pushed to his face, making his eyes water. “It is almost under us, but I have to leave you a bit further”, she shouted, to be heard over the background noise. “The roofs are no good for landing and I don’t want to disrupt the traffic.”
“You hope. It’s only a theory. It is never tested.”
Steve took a few hesitant steps forward. He had a cup which he tried to handle to Tony, but because he was still too far away, he stopped his gesture and came forward again. “I was going to bring you chocolate, but Jarvis said it had alcohol in it. He apologized, said he will start trying his recipe without.”
The exact address told them the other Steve and that Falcon fellow were near the area, they would make it there first.
Fury found nothing to say, so she continued her observations. Her sensible scream:
“It was only water. I always wash my hands before eating.”
“I said you can take whatever. Tony is always buying us new ones, anyway.”
“I have it here”, the man said pushing towards them a scuffed carryall he had kept hanging over his shoulder. Only Janet’s hand grabbing his arm prevented him to smack the guy in his face and then throw that possible threat far, far from them.
“Tony! What the hell… but… Put me down! You scared the shit out of me just disappearing like that! Where did you get that new armor?”
“You are always too generous, Gail.”
It was not a time for a witty banter from the screwball comedies. Tony’s face flushed with anger. For a while Steve wondered was the older man going to have a heart attack.
“Don’t think I don’t know anything just because I have been acting nancy longer time than you have. I still remember what it was like to strut around like your dick is two size too big for your trousers. You remind me how easily my life could have continued to be plagued by meaningless, nasty fears and that is scary. You can’t paint because it is sissy. Reading is for limp-wristed scholars and singing for church ladies, no matter how nice voice you have. No dancing, that nobody would notice you are actually good at it like some poof.”
“W-What is wrong with your eyes?” she asked, after a while. A regular shatter box, this one. “Are you hurt?”
He pushed Tony on his back on the mattress, which made Tony’s legs rise up to his shoulders like he was really an automation he played to be. No rookie, indeed. Steve teased him with a shallow pushes, which made those nerves just behind the rim shot out a constant pleasing sensations. No fireworks, not yet, maybe never, because all guys weren’t able to feel it like that, deep inside. Steve should know. He was one of those unlucky numb ones, but if he thought about it rationally, perhaps three layered pleasure would have been too much to handle even for son of Cain. He had his dick and his teeth, and those sensations which went through him when he penetrated the skin with his fangs and sucked trembling, sweating being under his mouth, he wouldn’t change even to the best ones of those other fireworks.
“Yes, only in the USA… You found yourself bad in the sack and try to turn it into a political debate”, the other Steve mocked him. “Hey! But your fists fucking down, soldier, or I will throw you from this roof and then we can really see how well our system heals broken bones.”
“Tony, he pulled a gun on me. The bullet hit some civilian.”
Yes, an instant boner. He wondered if he could be more pathetic even if he tried.
“When you played to me your little act, you shook in fright and your heart fluttered”, he said, his words making his teeth scrape her skin. “You sweat and tears streamed from your eyes. But now, now in this place, seconds from the death, your heart is calm like a frozen lake. Do you even know anymore what is true and what is not?”
Of course. And this was the final joke of his situation, wasn’t it? When he turned his head he would lose Tony to someone with tits anyway.
Right. That was it. Fury took the microphone. “Listen up la… kids”, he said and the crew turned their faces towards the mirror window. “Yeah, yeah, happy to meet the bunch of yahoos who turned our national hero so kissy feely it should be illegal, but I have some real work to do. If you leave the compound, register yourselves first with Captain Danvers, our chief of security. Play nice. Or else.”
Something flashed in Steve’s eyes and Nat felt a faint hope he would suddenly come to his senses and stop his folly. That chance passed when Steve took a fast step forward and pulled his gun out again. Nat raised her arms. That gave Steve a pause and she had time to jump backwards and out of the roof and the line of his bullets. It was a seven-story building, but as Nat had known, Tony was hovering there, ready to catch her up.
“Look at these soft fingertips. My brother’s miss makes them manicure things for the ladies, this one looks like he would sit in her pink, padded chair regularly. A soldier… this guy hasn’t done an honest day’s work in his life.”
There was Antonio. His Tony was fine. He didn’t care to mention that one aloud, but took a tablet this other Tony was handing over to him. He steeled himself, but nevertheless the man on the screen took him by surprise, just not in a way he had thought.
It was a true live horror show, and Fury swore it would all end right there, right now. He didn’t care about the shield or the pompous letter in that helmet. The nation had already mourned its fallen hero. People didn’t need to mourn anything they didn’t know even existed.
That announcement left Fury flabbergasted. “But how can it be? He is a fucking vampire! Anderson, if you can’t feel it, maybe it just means that thing is good at concealing itself.”
“Yes, why is that, sir?”
“Eleven days, if we are exact. Our boss, Director Fury. You made an impression on him.”
He felt Tony’s fingers in his hair, his reassuring, haltering whispers telling him how it was alright. He didn’t have to do anything, just leave Tony a little something that he could use to return their generous hospitality, if not with a whole gift basket, at least one pineapple with some explosive vitamin C.
To be in or to be out, that was the question.
Tony felt himself sinking into the strange, half-wake state. He should think about his situation, which normally would have made alarm bells ring in his mind, but his brain seemed to stuck in that lonely thought about Steve. He had sometimes wondered what made him so alluring. Well, Steve was fit, and Tony had this anything pretty goes, but besides that. Yes, there was something else than those abs and pecs and a body which wouldn’t have to be ashamed in comparison to some Ancient demigod. On the surface it seemed they had nothing in common. Steve was a storybook hero with a strict moral code. He was so… good all the time. Or if Steve wasn’t, he tried to be. He didn’t always have the answers, or he thought the answer was his fist in somebody’s face. Maybe that was it, that old-fashioned way of putting things in order, very much black and white way of thinking, which was so exotic in a modern world which saw only shades of gray.
“He was run over by the bus? Shit! Is he hurt?”
Maybe it was that all-knowing eyebrow. It was like the other Steve had sat inside his head, knowing what he was thinking before he himself knew it.
“Yes, but we are not in that stage yet. That we start to eat each others, I mean. If I promise you can gobble me up first, would that be better?”
“Oh God, did they just ask Rogers and Stark to be godfathers?”
“Keep him out. I am not in a mood for any manly hysterics. He can break his knuckles on the walls when we get his friend to the SHIELD base… oh damn!”
“I am a big guy. I will take lots of space. If you let me, I will take all the space.”
Tony couldn’t turn his gaze from the sight. “It… it is real, isn’t it? Not just some custom made junk a cosplayer has thrown in the sea?”
“Now they want me to slyly ask you again where did you come from. If it was the other dimension, or from outer space. Maybe your ancestors have stranded themselves here in ancient times? Are your people the force behind Stonehenge? The reason the pyramids exist?”
“I just”, Steve hesitated, when Tony took a sip from his glass, studying him over its rim. “This is a bit overwhelming, that’s all. I would have wanted to say goodbye to the other Steve and Janet.”
Then a horrid idea came to Antonio. What if it really had been Steve’s first time, not just with Tony, but overall… no, it couldn’t be, Steve had been with Janet, or our Janet, as he added in his mind. A funny habit, which were not so funny after all when one thought…
“Hello, birdy bird. How much of that did you hear?” Clint said after it was sure their guest was out of the hearing distance. Sam jerked, and finally seemed to remember what he was doing. He finished pouring the juice and dropped the empty bottle into the recycle pin.
A bad one, Banner meant. In spite of that, no armed guards were following the weedy doctor and Steve. Nor there was any other person in sight. They had emptied the route to avoid any problems.
had told her.
The man in a green grubs did as Banner asked. Fury had a little premonition. This was Tuesday. Tuesdays were like Mondays, bad hair days for sure, they just could pretend longer everything was alright.
Steve wasn’t still clear what the man wanted from him. He was their prisoner. They could do to him what they wanted anyway.
The next morning something strange happened. More strange than flying magic hammers and having a visit from a viking god, perhaps.
“Tony no!” Steve had seated himself, but those careful queries made him jump up as if Tony’s bed had turned into a nest of big and angry wasps.
Tony stood up, pushing his visor down. “I can go and...”
Now Rogers looked regretful. Fury knew that jumping jaw muscle though. That was Rogers being pig-headed.
That was what the Council of Elders always called them.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh God! My father would be so pissed off! He searched him for decades.”
“Iron Man is a battle bot”, Fury explained. His lips were in their usual grim line, but his only eye shined with a light mirth. “It means it is a robot… an automaton. Its programming is extremely well adjusted what comes to battle tactics, and it is capable of independent decision making, but Stark hasn’t coded into it any social niceties. Its handshake would crush even your fingers.”
“So strangling it is… or pissing on me.” Antonio couldn’t help that his voice let out some of his frustration. “You make a real tough bargain, big guy.”
That made Tony shut up. For a few seconds, at least.
It was so dark he had to consider whether his eyes were open or closed. He decided it was the former. He was not in his bathroom, though. The tiles should be smoother, and not so cold as this rough surface he was lying. Easy to deduce, it was not his bed either, not even the bedroom floor, which was covered with thick carpets. So cold, was he naked? Tony wondered that for a minute and realized he was wearing his armor for some reason. No wonder he didn’t feel well, his armor was no place to sleep, there would be no sharing the body heat with some pretty lady or exercises to keep his muscles warm. Steve, he would be such a furnace with his fast metabolism burning those calories and releasing heat…
There had been no truer words. And Tony’s tone was so light Steve probably had felt something else, it couldn’t be Tony was waiting Steve to clock him after all that. But…
“And me”, Tony chuckled. “Engaged to Nat? I would never! That would be like… I mean, that would certainly be
Steve-standing moved forward and squatted in front of his double, who was now gazing them suspiciously. Steve-sitting had been in the battle recently. His uniform was dirty and damaged, and it usually took much to even scratch their gear. He had his helmet still on, but it couldn’t hide the tightness around his eyes. They seemed to be about the same age, but sitting there the man looked older, like he was carrying a massive load on his shoulders, and unlike his counterpart, he had nobody to help with that burden.
“Why are you all so mean to me… Clint and I are in the lobby now. Do you need a lift? I can go around and come in through the window. I don’t want to set anything in fire in this death trap.”
“Banner, keep off from the firing range. I don’t want to stress our jolly green by shooting you. What is wrong with the eyes? That must be the worst hangover face ever.”
And if they didn’t, then what. He wanted to run out of the door and start looking, and he would have probably done that if he had had even a faintest hint from where to start.
“Well, darling. Everybody misses Thor. There is so much to...”
Then Fury rushed out of the door. He was already thinking other, more important matters, deep in the hazy depths which was his mind.
“Steve. Nice and easy”, Tony was saying while lowering them on the roof of another tall building. This one was more modern in comparison, luxurious even. It had that place a helicopter could land, or in this case, a Quinjet as Steve saw when Barton stepped out of the vehicle with that heart-eating trollop. The sight made Steve increase his battle with that pesky net, but Tony didn’t want anything to do with that. “Steve, for fuck’s sake, I don’t want to sedate you! Shit, what I am talking… Computer! Captain protocol.”
“You recognize the name?”
How could he forget, Steve thought. He had sat on his bed for hours, bawling his eyes out, staring at the covers of the LPs his team had bought for him. Andrews Sisters, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington... But those things in Tony’s safe room were not signed copies of all Steve’s favorite books, were they?
It took some time that Captain Punisher understood what Antonio was saying. He was hyped from the battle, ready to pull them apart with his bare hands, and when he realized who the real perpetrator in this mess was, it was only the combined might of the Avengers which kept him from crawling toward Hawkeye. Clint was still lying on the ground, unable to move and defend himself, screaming in fright like a drama queen he was.
The man seemed first taken aback, but it didn’t last long. That smile just jerked a bit more the corner of his mouth, showing Steve a flash of those perfect teeth.
They had a death penalty. Of course they had, and he really wasn’t against executions like some people, sometimes he would have preferred some torture thrown into the mix. There really were many people who deserved all they got, hurting and shaming women and children was cowardly. But a public execution, in front of TV cameras? That was a bit much. Very medieval.
It was like a slap in the face. His refractory period was so short one could say it was almost nonexistent, but that was a sure death sentence to his budding erection. He had not that much experience, but he had thought… Maybe he had thought wrong, and it was no secret now what Janet had been telling to Tony about Steve’s blunders in the sack. No need to be angry with Janet, Tony had seen with his own eyes how hair-triggered he was. If it wasn’t his fist, it was his dick, and both of them seemed to function in a way the others found repugnant.
That made Fury halt his angry tirade. He turned back to Steve looking honestly intrigued. “Really?”
“It was in my garage. Behind the tool cabinet. Are those aliens now leaving these kind of things in people’s homes? Is this some kind of mind control device? Are we going to be invaded again?”
That was a familiar looking harness, which was used to keep the shield on one’s back. His numb and shaky fingers didn’t do much to the clasps, but somehow he get it right before they were in the kitchen again. That commie… Natasha, he reminded himself, was sitting on the couch, a cup of tea in her hand. Her gaze was cautious, and it had more intelligence than in Barton’s leering looks. The archer had a bowl and he was munching something which looked like cereals.
“Oh him? He woke up because of this ruckus.”
“That was me, ma'am. It was a mistake. It won’t happen again.”
“We have to talk.”
It was a large carry-all, full of clothes. They had taken away what was left of his uniform and given him lots of gray sport trousers and white, short sleeved shirts, but that was not the case now. Uppermost lay a uniform top like the one he was familiar with. All those other things were there too, boots, helmet, trousers. All fine and better than ever, but Steve’s heart grew cold as he pondered what it probably meant.
“Or maybe big minds should stop dreaming silly. Do you think you and your father are the first ones that thought in your minds? If it were possible, the world would be full of sons of Cains.”
Steve didn’t know. He had had no time to find out the details, or if he was totally honest, no interest to talk with his other self. Obviously, that had been a mistake.
Bucky’s bushy eyebrows climbed to his hairline as he caught a glimpse of their solemn faces. “Sorry, dear. I didn’t mean to spook you. I didn’t forget. I am just teasing him. But tell Steve, who was the best man? Was it that other Bucky?”
“No.”
She gave him a stink eye.
“Water, p-please...”
How Steve hated those words! He had heard them too often from his own lips too. Tony’s hands were curled to protect his chest. The duvet was down on his hips and Steve saw glimpses of big, ugly scars like somebody had tried to rip Tony’s heart out.
He passed out again. This time when he woke up, he almost longed that nauseating swaying. Something was rocking him hard, drilling his armor, making it vibrate. He gritted his teeth together, but his head felt like it was breaking apart. The ache in his chest was suddenly too much and he puked out of pain, which was unusual, the pain was one thing he had used to live with after his cancer diagnosis. It was only a little whiskey and gastronomic fluids, but it earned him a tap on his head anyway.
“That way… Try not to fall asleep in there before I come back.”
She put the piglet down on the floor, from where it looked at them confused. Why did its entertainment center stop working?
“That is right”, Banner mumbled. “I have tried to talk with Tony, but it is what it is. The scandal media is sniffing his every step, always finding the worse.”
Rogers moved like he wanted to rush up.
“Sorry, pal”, Tony asked while lifting Steve into the air by the net handles. “We usually move together more comfortably, but I don’t want to let you so near that you can rip off something from my armor and make it malfunction.”
“Yeah”, Rogers said slowly. “We have kind of sad news too. Bucky died a month ago.”
When the cravings climbed to their peak, when the want of alcohol consumed his body, it could almost overwhelm the agony from his side and chest and head. At those first moments he would have done anything for a sip of any ethanol infused drink. Anything but raise from that mattress, perhaps. Or kill Steve, but otherwise. If a terrorist organization had wanted a custom made missile, Antonio would have asked what color scheme they preferred. Yes.
Tony knew exactly what he was doing, moving the place of his legs, changing the angle Steve’s dick drilled into him until his back arched and mouth opened, wanting to moan, to scream, maybe babble some nonsense, but he wasn’t fast enough: Steve filled him with his tongue. Licking and sucking Tony’s mouth, Steve found a steady rhythm for his hips, making the bed sway under their bodies and adding sensation until it was all too much to bear. Steve hissed and separated from Tony’s lips, attacking his neck, nuzzling and sucking until Tony grabbed the back of his head and pulled his mouth tight onto his skin. Steve got the hint and bit, still feeling the lingering fear Tony would change his mind. A pure ecstasy filled his senses, even if part of him still tried to observe the signs telling him Tony wanted him to stop and was trying to push him away. But if something, Tony grabbed his hair harder, scratching his back with the nails of his free hand. Steve sucked and pushed while Tony trashed and moaned under him.
the foul leader had promised to his troops.
Tony was still looking at him like asking can I. Still asking, even if he had a permission to take, had always been, neither of them hadn’t just known about it. Steve pushed his lips gently on Tony’s chapped ones. For their first and last kiss it was not bad. It would have been fine, if Steve had been able to stop thinking… his fingers on Tony’s neck, just a brief squeeze, or maybe a better grip and a fast twist. Tony wouldn’t be able to feel a thing.
Right. The next time Tony met Janet, he would put some glue onto her wings or something.
This earned him that cautious and somewhat sly look. Was Antonio thinking this was some sort of game?
“Banner, back off”, Fury said quietly. “Stark, you too. Stark, for Christ sake! Move that ass! Stop gushing over him! He just puked out human body parts. Nice and slow... Jesus! Why didn’t anybody think to restrain him?”
“W-wasp?” he rasped. “H-ha… our Janet would b-be... so pissed off... you w-whitewashing h-her…”
The guy promised to make a call next time he went outside. Tony rasped out Fury’s number. He wasn’t overly surprised when the guy came back and said the line was not in use. Probably he had just forgotten the whole thing.
“Yeah, but they do that thing only for perverts. The ordinary murderers are executed in private as usual.”
Like his team ever listened to him! Or yes, of course they listened when he was reasonable and made moves in the field, but even a child could see this was not a tactical decision, this was only pride and other stupid emotions. One of his own was badly wounded and it had been his call, it was his duty to put the end to this lunacy.
Fury could say that again. The observatory window was about nine feet from the floor but Captain America had jumped on the overhand like a person could ascend on the first step of the stairs. He was pummeling the glass, which cracked under his ministration.
“I didn’t stay to look, I was too busy trying to stay alive! If I hadn’t sparred him so often and known his tells I would be dead right now.”
There was another round of slow hugs and hand holding which made Fury feel like a damn peeping Tom. Just when he was about to tell Captain Danvers he would be in his office, Anthony took out his phone and the atmosphere in the lab changed. Maybe it was some fantastic invention Fury’s scientists would kill to study? Silly snapshots from that infamous birthday party? But of course not. When had Fury been that lucky.
“Yeah, overcompensating kind. Nor he is as techno savvy as our Steve. He looked at his phone like it would bite him. That guy doesn’t use Internet to know otherwise. We just keep him away from the movies or series there are guys smooching, not to blow our tale. This is going to be fun.”
“Little minds...”
“Of course you did, you narcissistic dingbat. You just proved me right.”
No taxi, but maybe something. Tony was again so out of it, but he had a right idea. The black SUV which had been waiting outside the bar was coming back. Fortunately, they were already out of the seeing range from the gates, and Steve made an impromptu decision, lifted his hand. The car stopped and a man in civilian clothes looked at him with curious delight. He seemed to be a runner of some kind.
She had made it to the roof. The fire escape was clattering as if some heavy and quickly moving person was climbing the stairs. First came a shield and then a man. Then a word.
He felt the faint nod, which almost raised tears into his eyes again. But he couldn’t cry now, not in front of Antonio. Now if ever was the time to be hard.
“You Russian cunt!”
“He was among those American soldiers who reached the first Nazi concentration camps”, she explained through her gritted teeth. “He must have seen how his comrades in arms gave their chocolate rations to the prisoners. Do you know what happens when you eat too much or too fast after months of starvation? You die, that was what happened to some of those children. They died, Fury, on the arms of their saviors who had become their killers instead.”
“One word to you, Stark. A toothbrush.”
He could see that famous Rogers temper rising. “How many times I have to say it? Do you want it with me or not?”
“No you won’t, love. Wake up James, will you?”
“Oh… I… s-should… h-have g-guessed... B-Barton is a p-prick in every u-universe...”
Steve had to admit that would be the case. He hadn’t had much time to think his counterpart for the last few days, getting pummeled by the superpowered megalomaniacs did that to your hospitality. “I don’t think he is faring any worse than I would be if it were our Tony in that bed.”
Perhaps Steve should have been pleased people thought he was some rose-cheeked virgin who still had virtue to ravish. He entered the room after Banner. They were all there. The negro officer who had emptied his gun into Steve’s chest. The red-headed spy. The blond brawler. And now the doctor who claimed he had a monster inside him.
. Sorry.”
He had gotten the harness off, but the clip of his uniform shirt was stuck. “I got it… Shit, that is a nasty one. We will have to look at that wound after I have delivered these to Tony.”
“Yeah. Don’t you have those in your universe?”
“I don’t know… regular, I think. Father, mother… I have… had a little brother, but… you know...”
“Captain, you seem upset. Did you leave somebody special behind?”
“Are you sure”, Tony’s voice asked when St
“That is a valid option. If they have something planned ahead, and that Tony is even half as smart as ours, he can make some real damage when he has Captain’s strategic skills and muscle to back him up. And if their arrival was not an accident… Who knows what resources they have moved over here beforehand?”
“But how could...”
A small and fat one had pulled out a gun. He was already squeezing the trigger, but Janet wasn’t there anymore, and then a wannabe thug screamed and fell on the floor, when a painful electrical force burst from Janet’s stinger left him unconscious.
“That wasn’t no?”
This time their usual snarking was interrupted by an official sounding call in Fury’s earpiece.
Tony moaned. Steve had lost the orange, letting his hands continue their journey. Tony was wearing no undershirt. Steve felt his nipples tense until they were two deliciously hard pebbles. He mouthed them through Tony’s shirt while pushing his jacket down along his arms.
