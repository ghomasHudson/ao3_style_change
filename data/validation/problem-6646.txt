"Stand aside, good people. Make way for the knights of King Arthur!" Reluctantly, the crowd parted. Steve ran towards Tony. Several men were still standing over the armor, shovels and crow bars raised, but their attention now on Percival. Steve barked at them to get out of the way and they reluctantly stepped back, lowering their metal implements. Tony was lying on his front. There was no indication whether he was conscious inside the armor or not. Steve was rolling him over when Percy arrived at his side and dismounted. People immediately started pushing in behind him again, yelling for the demon's head.
Steve flopped onto the bed next to where Tony was poking at something on his tablet. "Why is there a tuxedo hanging in my closet?"
“Except that you could have left things alone and nobody would have been any wiser and everybody would have been happy!”
“Well done, girl,” Tony patted the bike affectionately, “Let’s get this show on the road, shall we?”
“Really? Carrying dudes? Like, on the battlefield in WWII?” Her eyebrow rose quizzically, as if she might be calling bullshit on her own question, but for sure on any answer to it.
It looked like Tony flushed just a little. Steve thought he had imagined it, but the way Draco smirked, maybe he hadn’t.
“My husband, King Urien, didn't like what I was doing, and he chose to express that displeasure thus.”
"Yeah, you're right," Tony admitted, "I have got to go get the suitcase armor from our cabin though. I can't let that fall into Hydra's hands or we'll be battling an army of evil Iron Men next month."
Fine. He'd go check out this Castle of Maidens. At least it'd be a distraction. He gathered his things quickly, half wishing he had a squire, like Lancelot and Gawaine did.
from Tony instead of toward him? What if he had missed the right turn? He wanted to scream in frustration. He would have to save the sentiment for after he found Tony, though. Just like Howard would have expected him to, and wasn't that ironic?
Silence descended in the room. Steve turned his head and looked at the machinery along the walls. Even if he could see it clearly, would it make any sense to him? Finally Steve turned his face back to Tony's.
When Tony drifted off to sleep on Steve's shoulder, he let him be. Tony obviously needed sleep, as pale as he'd looked earlier, and Steve wasn't about to let him go yet. When Tony's breath had become slow and regular, indicating deep sleep, Steve turned his head and buried his nose in Tony's hair. It smelled a little salty, probably because of the sea winds around this place, and a little of chamomile. It needed a bit more eau de engine grease to make it perfect, really. But it was perfectly soft and Steve barely stopped himself before he gave in to the urge to press a kiss into Tony's hair. That would be... inappropriate.
It took Steve a minute to parse what Tony was saying. When he got it he couldn't help but shake his head at how utterly wrong Tony's interpretation was. But since it worked to his advantage and saved Steve from having to explain what had actually been going on in his head, he'd take it. Bless the man for handing him a plausible excuse.
"Colonel Rhodes. The honor is mine. Sir." There was a pregnant pause as both men held the salute while they stared at each other. Tony rolled his eyes. They ignored him.
“Well, they should be able to eat soft foods, like canned tuna. A bowl of water. Don’t give them cow’s milk, their bowels can’t handle it. And they’ll need a litter box.”
“Aw, come on. It’s probably Jane. Only those in the throes of new love would go out in this. Or did you tell her about the lasagna? Go open the door for your moocher girlfriend, Thor!”
Okaaaaayyyy. "And that one?" He pointed at one with a wide open mouth and an amorphous brown blob on his yellow shirt.
He ends up going to Sam’s group too, after he’s talked to Wanda. He wants to be annoyed with how happy Sam is to see him, but to be honest, it feels really good. He catches himself smiling throughout most of the group. It seems fragile, this lightness that he’s feeling, but he’ll take it.
"Sir Stephen, we have been called, we cannot dither." His elevated perch on horseback made his looking down his nose even more pronounced. Bors had discarded his wood and the others were also getting back onto their horses, and Steve felt stupid just standing there with his branches, but he really didn't see the point of going to attack some random people just because some crazy old man said so. They had better stuff to do.
" That was not the Captain America voice. That was all Steve. Sounding a little... panicked. He wouldn't..? Of course he would.
Tony opened the cellar door again and slid down the ramp. Running up the stairs behind the bar on the other end of the cellar, he called out to Pim.
"Fair enough, " Steve nodded unhappily. "I guess we can take a break for the holidays, huh?" He managed a wry smile.
Steve's eyes went wide, but he still wasn't kissing Tony. Exasperated, Tony pulled him in more, went on his tiptoes and pressed his mouth to Steve's. It was awkward and the angle was wrong and there were way too many teeth involved, but then Steve made a surprised little noise that trailed off into a whimper and the next thing Tony knew he was being yanked against Steve's chest and Steve tilted his head just so and then their mouths slotted perfectly together and then Steve's tongue was in his mouth and Tony's knees gave out. That didn't matter in the least, because Steve held him up with ease and Tony slid his arms around Steve's neck and his hands into his hair.
“Okay.... That's.... I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I thought you and Peggy had surely... Listen, I wouldn't have played it that way if I'd known. I thought you were being a prude. I didn't realize you were freaking out. I didn't mean to freak you out more than those assclowns already did.”
"That's not what I meant. Of course I think you can do this. I think you can do this so well you may change the course of history and should we really risk that?”
Thor shrugged. "As far as I know, he speaks truth. I have no magic, but my mother always said spells can't be undone until they have played out as they are set."
Behind him he heard his bedroom door click shut. Not knowing what to do or say, he steadfastly continued what he was doing. A moment later Steve’s hands landed on his shoulders and a voice spoke softly by his ear:
?!? There are professionals that do that, people. There are professionals out there that you pay and they come to your house and they decorate it and it will be all tasteful and shit. And in the meantime, you can get some work done. It's a splendid system. We should honor it."
"Exactly!" Tony crowed, flinging himself back against the armrest with the enthusiasm of the mildly inebriated, "That's the other thing it's about: trust. You know how you said yesterday that it went without saying that you had my back?" Steve nodded. "And implicitly you're trusting me to have yours..... So. Steve. Kneel for me." Steve stared at him. "Go on," said Tony, "Trust me. Kneel." After a long moment, Steve slid off the couch and knelt on the floor. Tony felt a little thrill of triumph. "Good. Now close your eyes." Steve did. Tony got up and rummaged in Del's suitcase in the closet, then returned to the couch. "Come closer, don't open your eyes, follow my voice." Steve shuffled closer on his knees. "A little further. Now turn towards me." God, the man was beautiful. "Hold still. These are nothing but scarves." Steve went a little tense when Tony used one as a blindfold. "Shhhhh," Tony whispered and trailed his hand over the blond hair, feeling the tension leave again. "Now hold up your hands, wrists together." Steve didn't hesitate this time and Tony loosely tied his hands together. "Come a little closer still." Tony opened his legs and watched Steve shuffle forward in between them. He let his fingertips trail along Steve's jaw and neck, the touch featherlight. A little shiver passed through Steve and when Tony cupped his jaw he felt Steve push into the touch. This was heady stuff. Tony suddenly wished he had not had that last drink.
He ate a sandwich on a bench in a park and then dug into his duffel bag for a sweatshirt. The days were getting chillier, he would have to get some leathers soon. Maybe even some chaps. He smiled, remembering Tony's filthy litany as he was dissecting Del's baby blue chaps to harvest the straps for his toothbrush tasers, and it felt unfamiliar on his face, like he hadn't smiled in ages. He probably hadn't. Then his hands brushed the large envelope in his bag that contained some of the letters that Captain America had received during the trial, mostly from kids and seniors. He took it out and flipped through the letters. He had gotten so many, it had been a bit overwhelming. These were only his favorites, less than 50 in all. The one he pulled out was from a 93 year old veteran, who was originally from Brooklyn, and Steve wondered it they had ever met before project REBIRTH. The man was now living in a nursing home in Silver Spring, which was actually pretty much around the corner from Bethesda. Huh. Maybe Steve should just go find out.
It was the obvious distress in the elf’s voice that convinced Steve. He looked more prim and proper than any elf Steve had ever seen, yet here he was, clearly upset.
"nope how is married life" Fury's ceiling responded a couple of minutes later. "Fucker," Tony muttered, "Steve, come here, pucker up, selfie time." He pressed his cheek to Steve's and took a picture of the both of them. He deleted it after checking it, though. "No! Not grumpy cat face! I said pucker up! Come on, Steve, like this," and he made an exaggerated kissy face. "I don't..." Steve objected. Did Tony seriously expect him to....?
There is a restless energy emanating from Tony that puts Steve on edge and he wants to say no. He wants Tony to sprawl on the couch like he did last night and lazily bitch about his book, but he can see that that isn't going to happen. He balks at anyone messing with the TV, it's his mom's TV, and... And fixing it is much better than replacing it. If it would work again, he wouldn't have to think about replacing it anymore.
See, the old Natasha would have smirked or given him the glare of death. This one looked a little resigned, or maybe even sad.
The next morning Steve was on the second round of fucking Tony through the mattress, this time trying to go slow and watching his dick sliding in and out the beautiful boy writhing in the tangled sheets and egging him on, when Bucky’s howler arrived.
In the dining hall that Tony had appropriated as workshop, he perfected his Grail spiel with the help of JARVIS. They managed to create a passable illusion of something ethereal and glowing by messing with the hand repulsors a bit and angling them just so. The lack of appropriate tools was maddening. He always had a few specialized items stashed in the armor that he had used for this project, but unless he planned on kidnapping a blacksmith and his entire forge he was shit out of luck when it came to more tools.
That made Steve laugh: "And you so meekly follow orders, don't you? Don't you run a giant company in real life?"
“Yeah, alright,” Tony said to Rhodes, inclining his head in Steve’s direction. “In the meantime, there’s your client.” He motioned for Rhodes to follow him down the hall.
Steve desperately cast another Levitation and forced the bike back with the force of his will in order to reach the wand. He grabbed it and tossed it in Tony’s general direction, not daring to take his eyes of the motorcycle that was glaring at him with green tinged eyes and a menacing rumble, while it was trying to get at him. The pillar of fire in the cauldron was giving off waves of greasy smoke that stung Steve’s nostrils and the back of his throat and one of the broken tubes was leaking a fluid on the bench that was eating away at the wood with a loud hiss. The motorcycle now tried to go over him, working
"We'll have to go back to court to get your shield, Captain Rogers," said Ms Elisa Williams, "We can make a solid case for it being your personal asset and not military issue, and I have confidence we can win it back for you. They are just a little butt hurt right now about being forced to acknowledge that they can't extend your contract past retirement age without your consent. And that they owe you roughly 40 years of back pay, with interest." She smiled like a shark and Steve felt a muted sense of gratitude for her efforts in that regard. It was nice not to have to worry about money, it really was, but...
None of them spoke as Tony took off the faceplate, once he was strapped into the jet. Black Widow checked on him with a look that said nothing and Tony let his head fall back.
The next morning Tony plopped himself on the edge of Steve’s bed and Steve manfully did not pull him down on top of himself. He folded his hands behind his head to make sure of it.
“It’s not a horcrux, you heard me explain how it’s not a horcrux! Bruce didn’t even know something had happened to his processor. It’s harmless. It doesn’t take anything away from you. You just….infuse it.”
"We have a chopper coming in for a landing on the helipad, boys. American Military issue by the looks of it. I gotta stay out of range unless you want explosions to be part of this extraction and possibly cause an international incident. Stark, can you bring Clint to me?" She rattled off a series of coordinates that in Steve's estimate were about 10 clicks east.
He looked at Steve who had come to stand leaning with his back against Tony's workbench, arms crossed and smiling widely. Tony ignored the now familiar swoop in his stomach and glared at him. "And you need to not subvert my A.I."
“So, tell us, Captain. Do you have a special lady in your life?” The woman’s voice was both loud and coy. “I am sure plenty of them are interested, ha ha.” Tony shut off the equipment and lifted his mask as he turned around. Coulson was sitting on his couch watching the big screen tv over the fireplace. Some stupid morning show. The camera panned from the lady with helmet hair to a relaxed looking Steve, who was saying something about finding his footing in his new life before he’d consider dating. Tony barely registered what he was saying, too busy drinking in the sight of Steve. The blue eyes, the laugh lines, the impressive physique and omigod, were those pleated khakis? Didn’t SHIELD know you couldn’t let the man shop for himself because he would inevitably come home with old man pants? He tore his eyes away.
So Tony's third cat already had a name before Steve even picked it up and gently dislodged the dead bird. The kitten mewled in protest, then tried to gnaw on Steve's finger as he started to rub its head with it. Tony quickly popped into De Wijnhaven to announce he was going home and Pim waved him off without a word.
Across the room, Tony took off his outer robes and vanished them in mid air. Then he turned back abruptly to the group of people that was messing with the snow sculpture and grew the dryad (or Rowena Ravenclaw) a set of snow horns as if what he was wearing wasn’t scandalous at all. Steve doubted he himself fully appreciated exactly how untraditional the almost skin tight button-down shirt and waistcoat were. All he knew was that he himself, and, no doubt, all the other men in the room wore the billowy, shirts with ruffled cuffs that he’d always thought belonged in old timey pirate movies, but that were apparently standard wizard attire. Tony’s shirt didn’t even reach the waistband of his decidedly low cut trousers. These barely covered his hip bones and let a tantalizing strip of flesh bare. Steve wanted to touch him so badly, he didn’t know how was still standing here. Then Tony stuck his wand in his waistband for a moment and started rolling up his cuffs to just under his elbows. Steve might have groaned.
He had his elbows on his knees and his fists clenched in his hair, when the limo door finally opened and Steve stumbled in, obviously being pushed by Rhodey, who stuck his head in after. Tony sat up with alacrity. He briefly tried to smooth out his ruined hair, then gave it up for a lost cause.
"That isn't fear, dumbass. That's... you know..." Tony flicked his eyes down to Steve's lips and then back up to the blue eyes that still stared at him without comprehension. "You're very close." Tony could tell when Steve connected the dots. He pushed himself away from Tony with alacrity and staggered back against the opposite wall, the diaper changing table hitting him in the ass. His cheeks were flushed and Tony bit back a sigh of disappointment. The good ones always had that deplorable gay panic thing going on.
Steve seemed happy but a little flustered, as if he could not quite believe that Tony had bought him chestnuts. Which was wrong, really. People should be falling over themselves to buy Steve chestnuts. It should be a thing. A common thing. And not a thing that made Steve look like a child who had just snuck downstairs and had actually caught Santa in the act of stuffing his stocking.
“Yeah, you are, and you’re really damned good at certain types of magic, but deep down… Deep in your bones, do you believe that Cinderella’s Fairy Godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses?”
"I can't believe this," he interrupted Steve's theories on Noble Firs potentially staying fresh longer, "Look at us!"
He was interrupted by his doorbell. The days were long past when that would cause a little thrill of ‘Steve!’. Now he just figured it’d was one of Clint’s annoying friends who hadn’t realized he was gone and was just ringing all the bells to get in. Tony’s friends had all gone on vacation, but he himself was too busy writing up his thesis to take a break and risk losing the flow (or risk Yinsen coming up with additional calculations they -meaning Tony- should try). He sighed and carefully dislodged Thor and Brucie and left his room. He hit the automatic door opener he had finally installed last month.
? And more importantly, did they need to be rescued again? He wasn't sure he was up to any high octane rescues right now, not the way his body ached almost continuously. Something mild, say along the lines of shouting: "Shoo! Get thee away, knave!"
“Please tell me you’re not divining the meaning Tony’s choice of robes again, you pedantic snob,” said Harry good-naturedly.
' that his heart had sung triumphantly, that had been the most significant aspect of the experience. Steve wanted Tony to be his and Tony would be treating him like one big, giant joke, and he would drag out Steve's fantasies for all to see and ridicule.
“Damn it.” He started pacing again, his gaze on the map. “All we've attracted so far are these piddly, pansy knights who faint when I fart in their general direction.”
“Here. See the peds?” He pointed at the thousands of little spokes the bike had instead of tires. “They will shape themselves to mimic a rubber tire, complete with tread, when they sense asphalt, they will become spikes on grass or dirt and in the air they will form thin but sturdy miniature sails, so as to actually displace the air you’re traveling through. Now the eyes…”
“No point,” says Steve, “I don't fill it up fast enough for it to keep it in good working order. Besides... the drought. This uses far less water.”
Tony was about to lift his bottle in salute to this fine bit of entertainment, but the "Cheers!" died on his tongue.
"Just a sec, Tony," came Steve's voice from behind him, "let me smell the chestnuts for a bit." Chestnuts? What chestnuts? Tony looked around and spotted a guy at the edge of the sidewalk that seemed a likely suspect to be roasting said chestnuts. They smelled kind of pleasant, he supposed, even if they immediately caused a earworm of 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, something something la la la'. He turned his head to look at Steve, who was inhaling deeply, looking... wistful? What the fuck? If he wanted chestnuts that badly, why wasn't he getting chestnuts?
Pepper's heels on the tile floor of Stark Tower did an excellent job of letting Tony know just how angry she was. Tony wished he could mimic the staccato aggression with his crutches, but the rubber anti-slip booties it had on the end of the sticks thwarted that. And they hadn't even given him a walking cast yet, so he couldn't get aggressive with that either. Apparently the doctors were afraid that the serpent slime could still turn gangrenous or something and they wanted free access to the leg, so no cast for Tony, just some brace type thing.
“Ask Percy if he has a guitar. We can all sing 'Let It Be' by the campfire before we go to sleep,” he offered with a feeble grin.
“You know. Stew on that one for a while. Maybe it won't look so bad in the morning once the shock of possibly learning to dance with someone else wears off a bit. And if you still can't do it, we'll fake a last minute sprained ankle or something.” Tony patted his back before he pulled his arm off and pulled out the itinerary again. “Now, how do you feel about karaoke?”
the brass send Captain Tight-Ass to do this job? He's obviously horrified by this scenario and will break cover and run the first time he has to hold my hand. They can't possibly have a shortage of tall muscular dudes, who would be better suited for this. Hell, they probably have a dozen or so gay ones. This has disaster written all over it, Nick.”
His unholy joy lasted about half a dozen laps. Then there suddenly were chunks of cars flying through the air and the next thing he saw was a big ass dude with an arc reactor and white hot crackling whips that were apparently cutting cars in half. The next second his own car was being sliced and diced and it was all he could do to roll out of the way and hide behind the debris. It was obvious the guy was gunning for Tony in particular, the way he was lumbering closer, a menacing grimace on his ugly mug. As the whips set the air alight with electricity Tony really wished he hadn't ditched Steve. He was pretty fucking helpless at the moment, and he so needed a remote call function for his armor if he survived this. And now that death was a distinct probability in the next 10 minutes, he found that he really, really did not want to die. Definitely not at the hands of some asshole poser who somehow had gotten his hands on his arc reactor designs. That in itself was an outrage! And the dude had bad teeth, now that he was close enough that Tony could see. Eastern block dental care, if he wasn't mistaken.
Tony managed a breathy "No, thanks" but the demon ignored him. It flickered again and then Tony was looking at himself. Not as he was now, with his long hair and beard and dressed in ridiculous tunics, but as he looked in the 21st century after a three day stint in his workshop. Dressed in a grimy black tank top that barely covered the arc reactor and with engine grease on a face covered in stubble. That version of him Steve could have seen anytime, even though he'd had no idea that that look had been in any way attractive to Steve. But he was one hundred percent sure he'd never greeted Steve with his cargo pants zipped down and pulled halfway down his hips, the head of his cock peeking -and leaking- over the waistband of a pair of white briefs. He tried to work up some indignation for Steve's boring choice of underwear for him, but the realization that Steve wanted him, that Steve wanted to get his hands on him, that he would be up for fucking Tony, that he might be at this very moment dreaming about exactly that, made the indignation burn away in a haze of lust.
Steve gazed up at the fountain, struck dumb by the combination of the agonized expressions of the statues, the play of sunlight and water and how they reflected on the marble, and the signs of weathering and decay. His fingers were itching for pencils and paper, maybe some pastels. Tony was wandering off, more engrossed in his tablet than in the view and Steve hooked a finger in the back of his collar, not ready to move on. Tony's head shot up as he was choked by his shirt and he looked questioningly at Steve, then followed his gaze to the fountain.
"Captain Rogers? There's someone here to see you." Steve was jolted out of his reverie and for a split second his heart soared with hope. Tony? Then it plummeted. If they'd send him Redditch, he might actually kill the guy. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and sat up, rubbing his face.
"Well. I imagine you'll be left alone for a while once the rumor has spread that the demon king has died, but the castle is now haunted by his ghost. I think you'll be fine without me, honestly, you're plenty scary all by yourself."
How I have always reacted, of course, you fucking imbecile! And you have every single file on me as Captain America. What did you think I'd do? Stick up my hands and surrender? Wet my pants?"
He paused upon entering the room, the light and the noise hitting him full force. Right. No stepping back into the hallway.
“Sure. I can almost guarantee it. You need a certain amount of chaos in a region to fly under the radar as organized crazy-ass evildoers, you know. The European Union is way too regulated for them. And the EU may be pissy about the US refusing to import their mad cow infested beef, and they don't particularly appreciate all that 'greatest country in the world' tripe our tourists spew at rude Parisian waiters, but they really have relatively few issues with us. Honey, Europeans have way too much vacation time to bother trying to take over the world these days. I'll bet you a million dollars Hydra has abandoned all their dank Austrian castles and moved to more fertile breeding grounds of discontent people. Like the Middle East. Nice and volatile, bribable despotic fanatics in charge, zealots everywhere, it's like a candy shop.” Tony's hands had snuck around to the front of Steve's torso while he was talking and were now petting his pecs. His eye fell on the pouty girl who was glaring at him rather resentfully still. Just to mess with her, he flicked the barbell in Steve's nipple. Steve almost jumped out of his skin and Tony had to hold on with both arms to keep him in place. Oh, how fun!
“Did you say romance?” she inquired sharply. Clint grinned and crossed his arms, leaning back into the couch.
Steve poked his head into the workshop a couple of hours later. Tony pretended to be fully absorbed in the project he had stared through for most of the afternoon.
The vet had said that Stevie would hide somewhere to have her kittens and to keep an eye on her because her labor would likely be difficult because she was so young and still underfed. But that wasn’t how it happened at all. In fact she had her kittens on Tony’s belly, after he had fallen asleep on the couch and woken up to a shuddering and panting little cat, who refused to be moved. Steve came to the rescue with some newspapers that he maneuvered under the cat to catch the worst of the mess. And a mess it was. Tony had had no idea that kittens were born in a little sac, which the mother tore off with her teeth and then she literally licked them to life. It was more than a little freaky, but Steve had shoved a pillow behind Tony’s head and held his hand while he knelt next to him, so they could watch over Stevie together. An hour later she had produced three blind striped little furry worms, who were crawling all over each other trying to find a nipple. She laid back and closed her eyes, seemingly sure she was done. Tony figured she’d know better than him, anyway.
“What's wrong with the visitation schedule? There's always someone there. To make sure he wouldn't check himself out, I was told. By
Steve resisted the urge to do something stupid, like take his gauntlet off and caress Tony's hair. Or kiss the top of his head. He couldn't stop himself from holding on a little tighter in response, though.
“Sure.” Steve gratefully jumped onto the change of topic. “What else are you going to need for these bombs?”
It was late afternoon when they first glimpsed the Irish Sea on the horizon. They were coming down out of the hills after a relatively uneventful day. Only one knight had challenged them and Bors had dispatched him with ease. They'd had a lady hermit prophecy at them as well, but she'd just confirmed that everyone except Tony was good and brave and on the right track, and that Percival had to be careful who he trusted, but she hadn't given them any tasks that delayed them. The sun was getting low, glinting off the sea on the horizon, and while Steve was tempted to push on to reach the water, just for the sense of accomplishment it would give him, he knew that would be hard on Tony. So they made camp a little early in an abandoned barn and it was just as well, because shortly afterwards the sun was obscured by a storm front moving in and they were grateful for the bit of shelter the holey thatched roof provided. He made sure Tony had a dry spot to sleep in and Tony looked at him, thoroughly unimpressed.
." Steve had stalked closer to Tony and he'd be waving a finger in Tony's face any moment now, but dammit, he still had ice in his beard. It was just starting to melt and drip on the floor. Tony held up his hands in surrender.
“Heh. You can try.” Then Tony's face turned serious again. It was hard work, keeping up with his mercurial moods. “Aunt Peggy tried. She took Howard to town on several occasions that I remember. It didn't help much, he'd be marginally better for a while and then we'd be back to normal. She just wasn't around often enough to make all that much of a difference.”
"Both. Grab them both," Tony urged, "Jerk us together." Steve lined up his cock with Tony's and wrapped his hand around both of them. Oh god, that felt
Tony did, although with the fingers digging into his cheeks it sounded more like: "Yus, Culnul Wuds, Oi unnustund."
So watching Steve fight this fight was out of the question. The last thing he wanted was to be reminded yet again how thoroughly fuckable the man was. Instead, he checked the bat shit, and the sulfur and the charcoal and congratulated himself on being just about ready to blow some stuff up. Then repacked it all and sunk onto the slightly damp grass to wait for Steve's inevitable victory while he napped. It was ridiculous how quickly he tired these last few days, so the more sleep the better. Steve had made sure Tony always had first watch, so he could get a chunk of uninterrupted sleep, and Tony had wanted to scoff, but it did help, so he'd swallowed his pride and just agreed. The worst part was that Steve would always send Tony to bed with a worried face as soon as he took over the watch and there hadn't been any repeats of their midnight confessions. As uncomfortable as that had been, he wouldn't have minded to repeat the experience.
The campsite was quickly packed up and Bors made arrangements for the horses at a nearby farm and then they embarked. Once they were on board the ship started to move all by itself, because, of course, it was a fucking magic ship, but Tony couldn't even spare that a curse or two. He looked at Steve stowing away their gear and wondered if he was going to feel this surge of warmth every time he caught sight of him.
That had not answered Percy's question, judging by the look of befuddlement on his face, so Tony switched tacks.
".....You're not?" Tony blinked and tried to mesh this paradigm shift with the silent afternoon. He could not make it add up. "Then why all the frowny faces today?"
“I wouldn't go that far,” Fury offered after a pause, clearly puzzled by what he considered a non-sequitur. Rogers' look was totally blank.
“Yes, I'm feeling very sorry for myself,” sighs Steve dramatically. “I'll just have to take it out on my students today.” Which reminds him to check the time, and then he curses and has to run back to the house to get ready for work. His ass is much sorer when he runs. He hears Tony laugh behind him, but it's a good laugh and Steve doesn't mind.
Again and again it came. The deck became slippery with water, blood and serpent guts as the men fought to throw it back into the sea time and again. They had cut chunks out of it and one of the lances had got stuck behind one of the fins, until the next attack shattered it under the beast's weight as it hit the deck. Still, it didn't seem to slow down. Tony had to hold on the mast as the ship rocked side to side with the shifting weights and once he had to grab Bors by his arm as he came flying by on his way to certain death at the other side of the railing. The normally ruddy man was white as a sheet as he grabbed Tony's forearm in a silent thank you. Then Steve yelled for him to get his ass back in there and he scrambled back onto his feet and went.
Well, that was stupid. Bruce was the second smartest Ravenclaw student and admittedly brilliant in his own way, but also in possession of a legendary temper. Not someone Steve would model a sentient
He doesn't quite capture the smile, but he finds a measure of peace in trying. It's close to 11 when Tony mumbles something that Steve doesn't quite catch. He looks up, lifting an eyebrow.
“Sounds like standard procedure to me. My superiors sure don't sit me down and discuss their information with me,” Steve said, “It'd be nice if they did, I'll give you that.”
The night was bad again. The fever flared higher and Tony complained of numbness in all his extremities. A few times the arc reactor got so dim Steve was certain it had stopped altogether, but every time it flickered back to life after a minute or so. Tony's heartbeat was all over the place while that happened. The next morning he was barely coherent. There was no talking as they walked that day. The roads were getting wider and they'd passed a village or two, so at least they seemed to be heading in the direction of something important. By mid-morning Tony was delirious, seeing enemies everywhere. His jerky evasive maneuvers had Steve almost lose his balance a few times. He picked up the pace as much as he could, worry clawing at his insides. He'd run if he thought Tony would be able to hold on, but the grip around his neck often went so slack that he was already stooping to prevent him from falling off.
“Whoa! Whoa!” Tony sat up. “Gray? Really? No gray! No. Gray. Porter decided today to dye his hair brown for this cozy little getaway. He seems like the type.”
Not that they were letting him do a whole lot. The new guy they'd stuck him with had really no clue what Steve could do and seemed to be erring on the side of caution all the time. Probably scared to death to lose the American Icon. Steve still had hope he could convince him to give him more high octane missions, though. And if not, well, it wouldn't be the first time that he'd gone off on his own to do what needed to be done, and he could do it again. If he was honest with himself, he should probably admit his need for danger had multiplied since he had gotten back. The time spent on the ship seemed more and more like a wild and crazy colorful dream, a lot like Dorothy's Oz. And it made the reality of Steve's existence seem like an endless slog of khaki and tan monotony.
"I did, for a bit. But then I assumed you were busy chatting with grandma and couldn't respond, and you'd just follow when you could. You know, like silent acknowledgment."
Tony eventually comes back and throws himself on the couch with his feet on the armrest. He cracks open a copy of Wicked. Steve stifles a snort and Tony glares at him.
“Think of it this way,” said Harry, “do you really want to take the chance that someone else gets there first and puts their hands on him?”
to feel more of that. And he needed more skin. Much more skin. So he held Tony with one arm and worked his other hand under Tony's shirt. God, he loved Tony's skin.
"Yeah. Sure. Fine." But Tony felt oddly let down. Bringing the booze would be easy. But it felt like a cop out. He followed the rest of the discussion with a half ear, wondering
“Mr. Rogers, I am Jarvis, Master Stark’s house elf. I am afraid Master Stark needs your help most urgently.”
Tony clung hard to the knowledge that Steve had managed to not drown before he got frozen for 70 years, but it didn't make him feel any less frantic when he finally blasted out of the building.
“We won.” The smile grew bigger. “And I am trying not to be a hypocrite, but, honestly, Tony, it’s not a competition. Stop trying to prove you’re worthy.”
"Clint, I don't think..." Steve almost whispered, but then cut off when Tony grabbed him by the collar and yanked him closer. His eyes flew up to Tony's and his blush deepened even more.
Steve realized with a shock he wasn’t the only one seeing this, it wasn’t just the two of them in the room. Hundreds of people were seeing this.
"Hey man, before you go: I got your wings. There is absolutely nothing delicate or temperamental about these babies now. Merry Christmas. Ho Ho Ho. Care to take them up for a spin?"
"Not." Tony was just as out of breath as he was. "Not taking your virginity in the back of a fucking car, Steve. We're doing this right. We're doing this in the cabin."
“Well, that was certainly efficient,” Stark said with a little smirk, “Let's go check out the balcony.” Once they'd gone outside, he carefully closed the door behind them.
“Your robes are brilliant! Especially in combination with Tony’s! I always knew that boy was listening, even though Harry said I was boring him to death with my dressing advice. Anyway. Your robes are so traditional, just on the right side of stuffy, in fact, that they completely belie the fact that you’re muggleborn. You’re challenging everyone’s preconception that the muggleborn never become true wizards because they weren’t raised in the tradition. Now, the way you were next in the receiving line to Tony, who is wearing something so flaunting tradition, it’s like you’re saying ‘Don’t worry, I’ve got him in hand if he goes over the line.’ The fact that Thistlethwaite was Tony’s father’s tailor adds something to that, that either just plain reinforces the previous sentiment, or that add something vaguely salacious to the mix, I haven’t decided yet.”
"Captain Rogers was very excited to find out that the skating rink still existed. Ms. Romanov insisted they go immediately."
“Actually,” Tony cocks his head, “why don't you just keep watching the game and let me do my thing. Never mind me.”
Tony sat down heavily on a nearby stool as the implications of the situation at hand finally hit him full force.
Silently cursing a blue streak he let Steve's fingers slip from his mouth and removed his thumb from Steve's. He cupped Steve's face with both hands and brought their foreheads together. Steve made a little questioning noise and Tony felt a surge of protectiveness wash over him. Just in time, he had stopped just in time. When he felt he could trust his voice not to give away how close he'd come to losing control, he said: "See? Giving up control and placing your trust in someone can be quite exciting." He gently nudged Steve's erection with his toe and watched Steve flush beet red. "However, for the rest of your education I think it's best if we stick to theory, rather than practice." When he untied Steve's blindfold, the man wouldn't meet his eyes. Tony leaned back and grabbed the bottle. "Now I am going to hook you up with Dan Savage and drink myself insensible, if you don't mind."
"Where is home, Natasha?" Steve really didn't know if there was any place in this world he'd consider home right now.
Lancelot shook his head. "If they were commoners, maybe. But a lady's virtue and beauty are her only possessions of value." That was rich, coming from the man who was screwing his best friend's wife, annihilating her virtue in the process. But Lancelot was talking in generalities, not specifics, he supposed. And maybe he was on this Grail quest to better his life.
he hasn't come. He needs to come, teetering on the precipice for so long is fucking him up and he's afraid of what's going to happen in his brain if he doesn't get to come soon. He begs Tony to touch him, but Tony refuses.
Tony's is wearing just a wife beater and a towel slung low across his hips. Steve's mouth goes dry at the glimpse of happy trail peeking out between the two. He thinks he can see drops of water still glistening in the dark hairs. He wants to lick them off.
"This trip has been good for me. I've finally seen my country. I've talked to people that remember the times when I was growing up. I've talked to kids who think the future is better with Captain America in it. It's been.... healing." Another roundabout answer.
“I think flying through an interstellar portal with a nuke beats flying into the Atlantic Ocean with a nuke anyway. So I think I won this competition once and for all. I’m officially more heroic than you.” He held out his hand for Steve to pull him up to sitting. The suit was dead and heavy as shit.
“Good,” says Tony, striding closer. And Steve has no clue what he is referring to, the game or Steve's reaction to him, but it’s not like he has leisure to wonder. Every step Tony takes revs up Steve's heart rate, as it's caught somewhere between panic and excitement and by the time Tony is standing right in front of him, blocking his view of the game , his heart is about to pound out of his chest and his cock is filling. Tony's so close that Steve could reach out and rip the towel off without even leaning forward. He'd be able to run his fingertips through Tony's happy trail, tug on the short hairs, see Tony's cock. He realizes he hasn't even gotten a good look at Tony's dick yet. He's had it inside him -and his ass aches not unpleasantly at the thought-, but he hasn't
“Wordless, too,” added Tony, respect in his voice. “Bet you could even do it wandless, but maybe not at the same time. I think you’re one of those people who can just do things by force of will. Which means you’re gonna struggle with a lot of the theoretical stuff, because it doesn’t help someone with your kind of magic. And you’re always going to be more of a brute force kind of guy, but admittedly a really powerful one.” His eyes flicked to where the hole in the wall had been.
He'd been about to thank everybody for a lovely day and escape when he and Steve had been delegated to clean up duty. Tony because he'd contributed the least to the cooking and Steve because he'd eaten the most. So here they were, washing the pots and pans that didn't fit in the dishwasher. And it'd be about fifteen more minutes before he could escape.
, sneak up on me like that again." The accent is obviously New York. Steve spent a few months there after his discharge, thinking the hustle and bustle would distract him enough to manage his newfound anxiety, but it had been a disaster. Too much noise, too much aggression, too many assholes. Too many sirens at night. Then his mom had died and he had come home to make the arrangements and here he still is. Here he is feeling stupid for the assumption that a goat herd in a dilapidated trailer could be nothing but Mexican.
Steve jumped down from the ladder and went for his shoes. He sat himself  down heavily on the loveseat under Tony’s bed, so Tony couldn’t see him. Tony flopped onto his back and studied the ceiling. Fuck, fuck,
"Guys," admonished Steve mildly, and Tony swallowed a scathing reply. He shot a quick glance at Steve, who was smiling benignly at his traditional little gingerbread men and sugar cookie Christmas wreaths. He swallowed hard and went back to work. Clint went back to kitchen, mumbling what sounded like an apology. 'Twas truly the season of miracles, apparently. Either that, or Steve's people managing skills were miraculous and Tony wasn't ready to add that to the guy's exhaustive list of good qualities. He was killing Tony as it was.
His voice pulled Steve's gaze from the wonders around him and Tony couldn't imagine what his workshop looked like to a guy from the forties. Steve's gaze landed on Tony and a small smile played around his lips.
“I am completely lacking in the sartorial graces and too stubborn to let my husband pick my robes, I am of the false opinion that none of you care what I wear, but the truth is none of you would dare to criticize me anyway and at least I am comfortable.”
“Behold your transport device!” He crowed. “And may it bring you a lot of joy. And the good captain, of course.” He looked at Sam. “It will only work for the right person. Since I am still here, we can safely assume I spoke the truth and it is not me, no matter how much he hates me. Would you like to try it?" His grin was turning positively diabolical, Tony thought. He was starting to get a bad feeling about this. Something that Loki found this funny, was almost guaranteed to be very bad indeed. Loki tossed the ball to Sam, who caught it easily.
-two-three with something that sounded suspiciously like amusement. With Tony so close that he could feel every little shift in his muscles, waltzing was a piece of cake.
“Shut up, Tony. You'll make me come in my pants.” Tony glanced down and was impressed by the erection tenting Steve's sweatpants. He slid his hand out from under Steve's shirt and slid it into the front of the sweats. Steve was going commando... Tony's mouth went dry. He caressed the velvety head of Steve's dick, reveling in how solid and warm and right it felt in his hand. Steve trembled above him and he pulled him in for a messy kiss that was mostly open mouths and panting breaths.
Tony shooed Percival and Elaine out of the workshop too and then locked the door behind them. Elaine offered to make up rooms for the new guests and Steve suggested Percival stick with her while he caught up with Tony and they'd see each other in the morning. Percival was still confused, but for once Steve was grateful at how biddable he was.
little conversation about withholding information when I get back, I know that much.” A potential Hydra spotting demanded that Tony keep his wits about him, though.
“Oh!” Tony came all the way up, finally freeing Steve’s legs.”We can ride the bike there! You can-” He looked at Steve, a grin spreading over his face, making Steve wonder what trouble lay ahead “Oh, hell yes!” Tony exclaimed. He jumped off the bed and stalked over to the painting. “Jarvis!”
"Yeah. Well... There's a first time for everything." He returned to the door and beckoned Steve in. Tony slipped outside quickly, but not quick enough.
Steve told his story. He was amazed to learn that while he had been here over a year, he'd only been gone couple of months in the 21
She looked at him with derision. “Lord Stark, that describes half the knights I've known. The other half are big and dark and strong. And that name does not sound familiar.”
"Dramatic," conceded Tony and for some reason Steve snorted at that. Ignoring him, he gestured at Percy. "Have you tried crossing yourself in view of this lady?"
But not today. Today he was... going to drive a race car! What the hell was the point in owning one if you didn't drive it? The risk of crashing the damned thing and going out in a ball of flame didn't seem quite as objectionable as it would have mere days ago.
“Oh, my mistake,” said Natasha and Tony could almost hear her eyes rolling over the com. “I guess just Steve is miserable, then.” And that was so much worse.
"Excellent!" Exclaimed Tony slamming his hand on the table. Percival looked hurt. "I mean not excellent that that happened, but excellent that you know where to find it." He turned to Steve. "Worth investigating, right? It's the best lead- It's the only lead we have so far."
Steve was laughing so hard, his attempt to shove Tony glanced off his upper arm. Tony shoved him back anyway. And then they were pushing at each other like middle schoolers and Steve knew it was probably childish and transparent as hell, but God, anything to get his hands on Tony right now. Tony didn't stand a chance, of course, not without the armor and definitely not now that he was laughing too. Within a few minutes Steve had Tony pinned under him, breathless with laughter and struggling feebly. He looked down at him and swallowed hard, the smile dying on his face. This felt way too good. Way,
Steve didn’t answer, just opened his arms silently and the next moment Tony launched himself across the limo and wrapped himself around the other man. He buried his face in Steve’s neck and Steve did the same to him, squeezing the breath out of his lungs. But that didn’t matter. Because Tony needed it, needed the physical reassurance that this was real, that this was Steve in his arms and he was allowed to touch him and allowed to talk to him and Steve still still wanted him. Still loved him. Steve’s shirt grew a little damp as the reality of that notion settled into Tony’s bones. Tony didn’t even care. Besides, his own shoulder was a bit moist too.
“You know how you two haven’t spoken since the press conference? I know he thinks you won’t take his calls because he figures you’re mad at him for the choice he made. And I know you’re not calling him because you don’t know how to tell him that you kept it from him that you were dying. And you’re both miserable.”
"Can we stop now? I can't feel my legs and I am quite done being the swooning princess," he bitched purely on principle. Steve smirked. An honest to god smirk on Captain America's face. It seemed a bit unpatriotic, somehow.
"You cannot forbid me to go, brother!" Gawaine was adamant. "The demon doesn't scare me and that Grail looks like a fine prize. Why would you deny me such a grand adventure?"
"You can't kill me." Tony almost stepped forward, then remembered he was checking for airflow, and held back, pretending he was keeping a safe distance. "Can you even touch me? I bet you can't. I bet you didn't even touch them either. I bet you just convinced them to move the cover and come in here and the fumes did the rest. Maybe you aren't even really here. Actually, I don't think you are. You can't even physically manifest, can you?" He cackled in glee, but quit abruptly when the demon dropped all pretense of being human and reared up on black scaly haunches, unfurling clawed wings. It lunged at Tony with a snout full of razor sharp teeth and Tony really couldn't help but scramble backwards. It was a reflex. Physically present or not, the thing was fucking terrifying. Tony's back hit the wall and then the thing was looming over him, his whole being radiating menace.
Tony’s heart had jumped at ‘more than that’ and he was trying to figure out a way to back up and admit he hadn’t meant it like that. So he wasn’t really thinking ahead when he said:
Across the barn Tony was muttering to himself. “How naughty can they have been anyway? I bet the Captain America blow up doll has naughtier fantasies than him... I bet the Captain America blow up doll would be more fun to fuck.”
He looks around his mother's bedroom. He dusts and vacuums it maybe every other month, but he doesn't look at it when he does. He hasn't cleaned it out. It's like his mother could walk in any moment and chide him good-naturedly for trespassing on her domain. He knows there is a box in the walk in closet with a couple of pieces of clothing in it, where he left it, because it had made him feel like shit and he told himself he could do it later. But later had never come. He wonders if he should hide it now. But Tony has no business in his mother's closet, so it's not really necessary, he decides. Once he changes the sheets, he checks the en suite bathroom. He quickly swipes some of mom's creams and her toothbrush into a drawer, then flushes the toilet, to see if that will get rid of the gray ring in the bowl. It doesn't and the toilet doesn't fill back up. He swears, but it's too late to fix that now. Tony will have to share the hallway bathroom with him. He's already used his shower, he tells himself, this should be no different. He knows it is, though.
, at least a dozen times, but he doesn't. Because it isn't rational. And he's damned if he is going to have a panic attack over a broken TV, or a toolbox, or... or whatever. He does a lot of breathing.
back to the cabin, shall we?” Stark was laughing at Steve, obviously proud of his accomplishments and apparently used to JARVIS being less than deferential. He started walking away, distractedly yammering sotto voce at JARVIS, but when Steve didn't immediately follow, Stark reached back and snagged his hand. Steve felt his face heat and even if that had mostly subsided by the time they reached their cabin, he still felt slightly drunk and off-kilter when they got there. And so very, very conscious of all the calluses and scrapes on Stark's hand and how warm and solid it felt in his own.
"Should we expect any larger than usual charges for 'personal entertainment' to be charged to the company account, Mr. Stark?" How she could convey so much venom in such a sweet tone of voice was a mystery to Tony. It would serve her well once he'd made her CEO, but dammit, she wasn't the boss yet.
"Close enough." Tony admitted. "And here you're eating this like it's the breakfast of champions. Not even any honey?" He almost gagged at the idea. "How is that even possible?"
He had to move his leg, because it was starting to cramp. The limo bench really wasn’t big enough for them and the motion almost made him topple off the seat. Steve still had his arms around him though and stopped him from tipping over the edge. After a few seconds of trying to fit them both on the seat again, Steve huffed in annoyance. He pushed himself up on one elbow and manhandled Tony until he was flat on his back with his knees up and Steve between them, hovering over him, smiling a pleased little smile. I reminded Tony of the night Steve had come home with him and stayed. Then as now Steve lowered his head and Tony’s came up to meet him for another kiss. As Steve bit gently at his lower lip, Tony deftly unbuttoned Steve’s shirt and loosened his tie. Thankfully he wasn’t wearing an undershirt, which made no sense in February, but Tony was grateful nonetheless as he slid the backs of his hand up and down the man’s abs. Then he took the opportunity to pull Steve’s shirt out of his trousers altogether and slide his hands around under the waistband touching the globes of his ass with his fingertips. Steve groaned and pushed his hips down against Tony’s and, whoa, that wasn’t going to end without a mess. He managed to pull himself away far enough to pant:
He couldn’t help but wonder occasionally how Steve was dealing with the weather. Nothing he could do, he knew that, and Steve’s choices weren’t his choices to make. But he still worried.
Now he was sitting next to him and Tony needed to sleep, but he couldn't yet, because he needed to eat first. He wasn't hungry, because the arc reactor was still causing waves of mild nausea, but he knew not eating would be a stupid, stupid decision right now. So he watched Bors make food while the stocky man kept scolding Percy. And Steve on occasion. Apparently Steve had failed him too, in some way. Steve didn't react to that. He hadn't reacted to Tony's prodding earlier either. He was just staring stoically into the fire as if he was trying to kill it with the power of his gaze. Trying to kill something, anyway. Tony had a pretty good guess what Steve was trying to kill and he wanted to tell him memories didn't work that way, but it was clear Tony was the last person Steve wanted to talk to right now.
“I left him and went to my brother Arthur. After all, he'd married me to the man. But his opinion was that I should be a more obedient wife and he was about to send me back. So I chose to leave with what faithful retainers I had left and come here.”
“All this is tradition, Steve. From the beginning to the end of the evening, and up and down the guest list, it’s the culmination of centuries of the Stark family hosting the Solstice ceremony for the creme de la creme of magical Britain. Besides the Summer Solstice, Beltane and All Hallow's, it is one of the four Great Gatherings and hosting it is a privilege that I'd rather die than willingly give up. Except that I'd be giving it up anyway if I were dead, because- Actually, maybe ghosts can host it, too, I haven't ever checked on that. Doubt they would let me, though, I'm sure the Stanes would immediately step in and claim the honor. Anyway. This is the first time I’ve invited a special guest, I can’t have you just mill about with that innocent look on your face. They’d eat you alive.”
Daytimes had distractions, most days anyway, but he had a hard time sleeping at night. Staring at the canvas over his head when the sounds of the day had faded, he missed Tony with an aching need that was so much worse than he'd expected it to be. Not that he was sorry he'd gotten involved with him, because what he'd had could not be taken away, not ever. But he hadn't thought he'd be this heart sore. It didn't help that he didn't know how Tony felt about him. Was he still angry? Was he hurt? Or, and that was almost more than he could bear to think about, was he indifferent? Had he forgotten Steve by now?
Lancelot explained. “They killed the proper king of this castle and took all these ladies hostage and abused them horribly. The prophecy said they'd be defeated by one man, and fate picked Sir Percival.” He nodded to the knight who was holding the swords who had come closer. “He unarmed them all, it was a good fight. But then they fled like cowards. Fortunately, Gawaine and I were here to catch them.”
Tony flung his arms around Steve's neck and his breath hitched when Steve grabbed him under his knees, but he didn't say a thing. Instead he had a coughing fit right by Steve's ear.
Tony avoided the press like the plague. He no-commented his way through a few events and acted with complete indifference towards what was already being dubbed 'the trial of the century'. Which was a little premature since they hadn't even reached the twenties yet. There were days he absorbed every little detail of the trial, even watched all the commentaries. And there were days when he could not stand to hear one more word about it and he lost himself in rebuilding the armor yet again, pretending like he didn't feel like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff.
This was why he hadn’t discussed it with Steve, because he’d known he’d take it badly. Maybe he hadn’t expected it to be taken
“Seriously? What the fuck, Steve? What the hell kind of fucked up story are you telling yourself in your head? Why on earth would you think I wouldn't want to see you? Did we not just spent a month in each other's pockets under unbearably primitive circumstances? I saved your life, you saved my life, all that shit?”
Tony woke up on a couch. At first he wasn't quite sure where he was and what had woken him up. For one thing, this was not his couch and the blanket that had been draped over him actually left his face free, which is not something that Dumm-E had ever managed to accomplish. Then the smell of coffee registered and he jerked upright. Right.... cruise ship cabin.
A week before his thesis defense, the bell rang and Tony opened the door for Colonel James Rhodes. Tony liked him immediately.
“An all expenses paid working vacation to Europe? How could I refuse? You are very persuasive, Mr. Stark.”
They lay there staring at each other and smiling sappily while trying to catch their breath. Steve caught it first, of course.
"He never did before," Steve smiled, "Even back when he was twice my size I always won any battle of wills."
“What on earth is going on here?” Steve couldn't stop himself from letting some of the horror he felt slip into his voice. “Were those men
He didn't wipe them off, but pulled Tony close and hid his face in the crook of Tony's neck for a moment. The audience applauded loudly, because Tony was an amazing singer, but Steve ignored them. Tony was looking panicked and Steve wanted to tell him it was fine, it was okay, it was just memories, and he hated that he couldn't, that he couldn't explain why this song meant so much to this displaced WWII soldier. He tried to convey what he couldn't say with a look, and Tony was maybe a little placated, but not much. So Steve kissed him, right there on the stage. The kiss was a little desperate and he could feel some of the tension in Tony drain away, as the man went a bit more pliant in his arms. Some of the people watching were hooting and Steve felt himself blush again.
"What? What is wrong with this?" Steve looked a little hurt, as if Tony was about to stomp off and leave him alone to pick a tree by himself.
"Best to give them what they came for, so they'll leave you alone. I guess I would have climbed you like a tree and shoved my tongue down your throat." Steve swallowed hard and felt his hands twitch. And his dick. Tony continued: "Think your commanding officers would approve of that?"
“You know that Little Match Girl story? That’s me, Tony. That’s me getting to be a part of normal life with you and your roommates for one evening, and then freezing to death when the illusion burns out.” He stood and shrugged his jacket on. Then he picked up his duffel bag and faced Tony, who was still hugging his knees, high up on the bed. Tasha was butting her head against his ankles and meowing for food. Tony ignored her.
Then there had been something that Tony could have sworn was an almost-kiss. And despite his little sojourn into inappropriate fantasies in that haunted church, his own reaction should have been 'What the hell?' But instead it had been 'Hell yes!' and Tony still didn't know if he was pissed or relieved it hadn't happened. Nothing had been said about it afterwards, Steve went back to normal right after. Well, the new normal, the kind and smiley normal. The normal that was sucking Tony in like cartoon quicksand. Except now it was even worse, because Steve held a part of Tony that no one else knew about, and it had created some sort of a bond that Tony was afraid he could never again undo. And even more afraid that he didn't want to undo it. Which is why he hadn't dared to ask about this possibly almost-kissing stuff.
Maybe the hardest thing about this era, Tony thought, and there were many, many things that clamored to be on top of that list, maybe the hardest thing to adjust to was how everything you wanted to do seemed to take a million years. If you wanted food, you had to cook it from scratch, complete with peeling vegetables and all that shit. If you wanted to talk to somebody, you had to actually go find that person, and often you wouldn't even know where they were. And if you wanted to go to the other side of the country, a mere few hundred miles, it would take fucking weeks to get there. Tony had known he wasn't a particularly patient man, he had that much self awareness thankyouverymuch, but there were times he felt like impatience might actually be the death of him. If the failing arc reactor didn't kill him first and the two were definitely related.
“We were on patrol.” Tony had to strain to hear him. “Me and Bucky and the rest of our unit. And we got blown up. I got hit in the head with something and I was out of it for a while. When I came to, everyone was dead.. Bucky’s left arm was torn straight off. He was lying next to me, half over me, as if he was trying to protect me, still. We were friends since we were orphans together in Brooklyn. He was always looking out for me. Always backed me up when I got into stupid fights. Even followed me into the army when I insisted on enlisting... “ His voice was thick and it took a minute before he continued.
“I wanted to say thank you for the suit. It's great. And thank you for... liberating my shield for me. I trust Ms Williams would have gotten it eventually, but it feels really good to have it back.” Steve sounded almost shy.
The atmosphere around the campfire was subdued that night. When Tony and Bors had gotten to the cave, the demon had obviously cut his losses and disappeared. Steve and Percy had been in the process of hacking up their lungs and it had been a while before they had managed to get them out of there. Now they had made camp a few miles away from there, but, although they were breathing normally by now and didn't seem to have any other physical ailments, the experience was obviously still affecting them. Tony was exhausted. Once the adrenalin had crashed, so had Tony, and Steve had had to hold him in front of him on his horse, because Tony would have fallen off his own. Tony had not liked the stiff and tentative way Steve had held on to him, but he was in no condition to argue. And Steve hadn't said more than two words to him all evening.
The whole situation had disaster written all over it. And the further it went, the worse it would get. He had to stop it now, before..... yeah, before that.
“No. Never will be that lonely. Talking about being lonely, though. Steve was here last week. I thought you’d want to know.”
"Just relax, Tony. Holding yourself stiff as a board isn't helping your balance. Soften your knees a little and move your weight from foot to foot."
The Avengers all looked at each other and then settled on Sam. Who pointed at himself in surprise. "Me? You think he feels the strongest about me?"
The orange kitten was still there though. It had its mouth full of feathers as it was trying to chew on the sparrow's wing and it obviously had no intention of giving up its price. It reminded Tony a bit of Thor with a joint and a box of cookies.
“You don't have a grace period, Rogers! Who knows who else besides Hydra is on this fucking boat? If our guys found out, maybe Al Qaeda and Interpol did too. You can't be seen to be anyone but Mademoiselle Del or they'll fucking know we're on to them and then we might as well paint a big red target on your fine ass. And
In retrospect, he should have told Pepper about Steve on that very first morning. Sure, she would have made all kinds of practical objections and other not fun contributions, but really, it was so much better to have her as an ally than being the object of her wrath. Tony had been busy all night running Vanko’s reactor specs against everything he had in his database and some peculiarities in the design made him heavily suspect this was a very early bifurcation of the original design. Early, as in before Tony had even been involved with the process. Something, or somebody, related to Howard, perhaps. He had managed to avoid Steve all morning too, and then Pepper stalked in with Steve in tow and announced with icy steel in her voice that both Tony and Captain America would be required to attend the press conference she had organized two hours from now.
His musings were disrupted by Percival poking him in the side. When he looked up at him, annoyed, Percival pointed at a man currently speaking with great relish.
"Recorded message from Ms Potts, sir. Set to play when any hashtag with your name in it hits a certain threshold while in Rome." Steve leaned over Tony's shoulder to look at the tablet screen with him. A pretty but severe looking woman appeared on the screen.
or something equally disastrous. So he startled a little when he felt Steve's hands on his biceps, warm and solid. Steve was now standing behind him, not crowding him against the bench or anything, giving him space. Maybe Steve was more comfortable not looking at him while talking either. The thingamabob he was holding clattered onto the workbench.
“Do you see Howard when you look at me?” Tony cut over him, almost stumbling over his words. Like if he didn't get them out fast, he wouldn't get them out at all.
Steve has just finished putting away the groceries and has started peeling the potatoes when Tony walks in. Steve bites down on a flash of panic when Tony suddenly appears in his kitchen, even though he left the door open for that exact purpose.
“I’m saying that, unless you actually believe you can transform one kind of matter into another, all your transfiguration spells are going to come out as jacked up illusions.”
"I, eh, I usually tell everybody who invites me that I have other commitments and then I spend a nice quiet day in my workshop with nobody bugging me."
He spent the rest of the hours before their late dinner seating transforming the toothbrushes into low tech, low power tasers.
Another bicycle went by. This one had a loose chain by the sound of it. Tony was sure it would fall off within two blocks.
That did the trick. Steve gave his earlobe one last flick and then finally his mouth covered Tony’s and it felt like coming home. He completely lost himself in the heat of Steve’s mouth, the slide of his tongue against his own, the taste of him and the press of their bodies as they tried to disappear into each other. He lost track of time for a while as he and Steve ever more frantically got reacquainted. Tony finally broke away as he realized they were dry humping each other and he’d end up with a giant cum stain inside his slacks if they didn’t stop right this minute.
Tony didn’t know how long they kissed like that, but eventually lust built and built again and two pairs of hands were scrabbling at Tony’s jeans. When they’d finally wrangled them off and Tony had kicked off his shoes, Steve pushed him towards the loft bed ladder. Never breaking the kiss, Tony stumbled backwards until the ladder hit him in the calves. He started scrambling up them backwards and Steve’s mouth trailed to his neck, his shoulders, his chest, his belly, as he got higher. He was kind of hoping that hot mouth would eventually reach his dick, but Steve followed him up the ladder and didn’t get any lower than his stomach. He finally flipped backwards onto the bed and scooted backwards with alacrity to make space for this unexpected lover, who crawled up after him, just as eager. They wrapped themselves around each other and just held on for a long moment. It felt reassuring. Before too long, though, they were kissing and groping again. The last bits of clothing were soon removed and Tony was breathless with want when Steve rolled him onto his back and positioned himself between his legs. His forearms planted next to Tony’s head, he lowered his head to kiss Tony deeply, then asked:
"Seriously, you guys." Natasha said, never taking her eyes off Tony. "Why am I the only woman on a team of emotional Pygmies? Next time we add someone to the team can we get Ms Marvel? Or Wasp? They're not breaking up, dumbass." Well, that was good to know. He hoped Steve was listening to that, if he was listening to anything.
Tony tried to imagine what Iron Man would look like to a Medieval knight and came to the conclusion he'd be surprised if the guy hadn't wet his pants by now. He shot up to hover a foot or two above the ground and the man started shouting at him. Tony supposed it was English, but it really sounded a lot more like German to him and besides a word that sounded suspiciously like 'demon' he couldn't understand a word of it.
"So. I hear from Sir Percival that you're leaving us to seek the Grail." She obviously wasn't pleased.
Tony wore Steve’s sweater three days in a row and Steve prided himself in getting the worst of the growly feelings under control. It still pleased and frustrated him at the same time to see Tony in the red and gold, those colors really suited him, somehow, but he felt his face was back to normal, at least. He’d look at Tony when he was busy and feel warmth pool low in his abdomen. He tried very, very hard not to think about kissing Tony, about peeling him out of his jumper and sliding his tongue up his throat. And he tried very hard to keep his hands to himself.
When he reaches his peak and shoots his load down Tony's throat, it physically hurts. His muscles are spasming, every pulse feels like acid, yet his mind is whiting out from pleasure. He collapses as the come down hits, half falling over Tony, who quickly moves aside but doesn't try to catch him.
"You guys need to wash. And eat," said Tony, looking over all of them, except Steve, whom he was studiously avoiding looking at. "There's a little crag with a fresh water creek and some shrubs a league or so north of here. We should camp there."
Tony told the story dispassionately, shivering occasionally, as if it had happened to a second cousin, once removed, and yet it still rocked Steve to his core. He ached for the child Tony had been, ached for the obnoxious, lonely teenager who'd gone roaring off the tracks. He ached to hold Tony now, to promise him that he would make it right, but he knew he was about 40 years too late and this Tony would not want to be tucked under Steve's chin, no matter how much Steve wanted it. This Tony was radiating 'don't pity me' for all he was worth and Steve respected that, but he could not help needing to move closer. He settled on the edge of Tony's personal space.
A week after that, though, he got a letter from his late father’s lawyer. It stated that, because he was of age now, Obadiah Stane was no longer in charge of Tony’s trust fund and he had full access to his inheritance. Which was a mind boggling amount of money and stocks and real estate, and what have you. It took him by surprise. Of course, he had grown up rich, but he’d gotten so used to being poor the last four years, that this felt unreal. And he hadn’t expected this to happen until he was at least 25, or maybe even thirty. It seemed very unlike his father to actually consider him an adult at 21.
Natasha turned up next. A couple of days after Sam had left, Tony found her sitting at the kitchen table with Steve and Bruce as if she hadn't been gone for more than a year. They were having coffee and discussing..... food? Tony was a little hesitant to join them, since the food seemed to be a serious topic and it didn't look like they were waiting for his input, but reminded himself this was
Tony sighed. “Not as bad as palladium poisoning. Not as good as a month ago. I think my heart will be safe for a few weeks still.”
"You will be discreet, yes? Yamilla, my wife, she is beautiful, yes? And I am very fortunate she agreed to marry me. She is also smart and.... very understanding of my needs... which are quite particular. But to earn her goodwill, I have to also meet her needs, yes? Yamilla, she likes...
If they didn’t give him the death sentence. That was a possibility when you went AWOL during war time. Still…
"Eyes up here, soldier," Tony admonished. Steve looked up and, wow, Tony was close, brown eyes laughing at Steve and all of a sudden he was actually having fun. Of course, he stumbled almost immediately but they quickly recovered and Tony turned it into a dramatic, but probably non-regulation flourish.
"And then there is option number three," whispered Tony as he grabbed Steve's arm to slow him down, as soon as he had spotted the table and their dining companions from a ways across the restaurant, "And that is that we're not dining with the guy from before, but definitely not with anyone from Hydra either."
"Throwing off potential trails," said Tony, "Hydra or paparazzi, it should work the same. Now, I propose we take a vacation from our vacation and get some vacation outfits." He had the cabbie take them to an open air market in a suburb with ugly concrete high rises, where people sold vegetables, fabric, Vietnamese lumpias and cheap knock off clothing. He got Steve an 'I heart NY' t-shirt that barely fit and himself one depicting a bleeding skull with a thorny rose growing through the eye sockets. Then he bought two black ball caps that were just not quite right and really crappy sunglasses.
"Oh god, yes. Touch me." Two pairs of hands started frantically pulling off his clothes, not always in sync. When Tony was finally,
the staple gun, of course. The staples carry their own power source and once they hit someone they set up a neat little closed circuit and taser the fuck out of them for about five minutes. By which time most people should be reduced to blubbering wrecks. These guys might be a bit more resilient, but that is what we have your arrows for, right?"
“Not currently,” admitted Tony, “but I can be one by Friday at the latest. I’m thinking interlocking metal plates, lightweight of course, and hydraulics wired into your nervous system. If we get it right, we may even get your sense of touch back.”
"Alas! I wish I could! But I can't. It's a spell and spells have conditions. Only by meeting the conditions can he come back."
“It’s not great for their stool, but right now the calories are more important.” Bruce started towards his room, then said over his shoulder: “Tony, you get Steve warm and dry in the meantime. Clint, you finish the salad.”
“Wait!” yelped Tony. “How official are we talking here? I thought we were talking boyfriends-official. Not…..” he almost choked.  “
Steve, who wasn't his Steve after all. And even though he'd known Steve wasn't his, that it couldn't last, the betrayal hurt like fuck. But the guy wasn't even Steve. He was Captain Fucking America! It all made a weird kind of sense in retrospect, the things he'd said, the things he could do, what he knew and didn't know, but how the fuck....
Steve had reached the chopper and stood wide legged, hands on his hips, his hair flying in the wind of the chopper blades.
“Yeah. I need to figure out what I’m doing with my dad’s company. Shit or get off the pot. It’s like I’ve suddenly realized I’m in limbo until I figure out what to do with it and it doesn’t feel good. And I can’t figure it out here.”
So it wasn't so much that he had just kissed a man, outside of the charade he was supposed to take part in, but more that he was wondering what the hell he was doing kissing
Ten minutes later Tony had an entirely new appreciation of what had gone down in Washington last summer and a new found need to go point out a few holes in the story Maria Hill had told him when she came to work for him. The woman probably couldn't help keeping secrets, though, spending that much time with Nick Fury was bound to have left scars, but it was the principle of the thing. He made a mental note to sic J.A.R.V.I.S. on her to see what else she was hiding, First though... He pointed at Sam's wings.
“Fuck, Rogers, it smells like sex in here!” Bucky exclaimed before he was even seated. “Aw man, look at you.” He gestured at Steve’s everything with his good arm. “Have you no shame?” Rhodes just looked disapproving.
“Wasn't you. I can handle you, big guy. It's the reactor, it's fluctuating and it makes me feel cold and shivery and out of breath, like I have a fever coming on. Which I know I don't. Scares the crap out of me.”
“You’re right,” Tony said, obviously not talking to Steve, “Rogers will do very well. Get those soft tissue adjustment equations to me when you have them, okay?” He flicked his wand at the mirror and it went dark, but not before Steve could see Bruce roll his eyes behind Tony’s back. He held up his hands defensively as Tony stalked closer, somehow gazing somewhere inside Steve rather than at Steve.
The man’s head snapped towards Tony and he ended up at the receiving end of an irritated look. Tony looked back at the man that Steve had left for dead after the ambush. Rhodey had told him how Steve had broken down when he’d learned that Bucky was still alive and Tony had been sharply torn between wanting to be there for him and being sickeningly afraid that Steve wouldn’t need him anymore if he had Bucky back. Rhodey had decided that it would be better for Steve’s mental health to do without Bucky’s testimony, so he could visit Steve and get calls from him. Tony agreed with this decision on an intellectual level, but beyond that his opinion about it deteriorated fairly rapidly.
Steve's expression turned hurt, his hands falling away. Why would..... Oh shit, Steve thought he was laughing at his confession. That wouldn't do. Tony patted Steve on the cheek to get his attention.
There was no trace of the kittens in the alley, though, no matter how hard they looked. They expanded their search radius and at some point, without it being a conscious decision, they stopped looking and just started wandering through the town. Tony pointed out some of the historical buildings, decent bakeries and the student associations where you could get a hot meal for just a few bucks during the week. He explained the differences between the ones where all the members were 19 going on 55 and dressed in suits and they were all going to follow in daddy’s footsteps, and the ones where you’d get a political discussion about taking down the establishment served with your meal, and the ones in between. And then he bought them both a portion of French (Flemish) fries with mayonnaise to prove that it really wasn’t as disgusting as it sounded. That, in fact, apart from the mayonnaise, the fries were really better than anything you’d get in the states.
“Because I like her too much and she objects to sleeping with her boss. And because I don’t want to stop sleeping with her, she needs a different boss. Also, being my assistant was too easy a job for her. You’ll give her a challenge, I’m sure.”
He almost missed the soft knock on the cellar doors when it came. Heart leaping into his throat, he forced himself to keep a straight face while he calmly pushed the door open. It was a lost cause though when he looked up into Steve's grinning mug. His features were outlined oddly by the cellar light hitting him from below as he was squatting by the cellar doors, elbows loosely resting on his knees and Tony couldn't help but grin back. He started scrambling up the ramp and Steve stuck out his hand and Tony grabbed it. He was hoisted up with a powerful pull, as Steve rose to his feet and they ended up standing close. Very close. Steve's hand was callused and warm, despite the night time chill. He didn't smell so good, but his hair was less greasy, so he must have washed at some point. That was more than Tony had expected. It abated his anxiety somewhat, but he was still very relieved at seeing him again.
Steve did as he was bid, and together they blasted off. Tony briefly considered heading back to the hotel, but he didn't know if Whiplash had any friends and also, the reporters knew where they were staying, so it didn't seem like the best option right now. He didn't really know where else to go, though, his brain obsessively flitting back and forth between all the freakish events of the last few hours and refusing to assign processing power to finding a solution for this particular problem. 'Not here' seemed to be most important, however, and that he could do. He chose a direction at random and flew until he stopped feeling like there were people breathing down his neck.
“I came prepared,” he proclaims, and Steve's head falls back as Tony sinks down on his cock and he's engulfed in smooth tight heat. The sound he makes is inarticulate at best.
"And what the fuck is wrong with jogging at a respectable hour, like, 11 in the morning?" Tony kvetched on.
Next he called the caretaker of Howard's Bring-Captain-America-Home-Yay! trust fund. Tony had never met the man, for obvious reasons that involved Daddy Issues, but he disliked the guy at first sight nonetheless, when he finally deigned to make himself available. First of all, Tony had to resort to threats of dire financial repercussions before the man came on the screen. Second of all, his combover was worse than Donald Trump's. It took a few minutes before he'd managed to explain to Tony that the yearly expedition to search for Cap was combined with an Armed Forces polar training exercise. That in fact, the fund just shoved a whole lot of money at said Forces and left everything up to them.
Tony looked down at his cargo pants and his black wife beater and raised a quizzical eyebrow at Steve, who flushed a little.
Tony drove on the way back to the airfield where his jet was waiting. Steve hadn't said a word since they left the nursing home and Tony hadn't pushed him. The day was dark and gloomy, but Steve still wore his sunglasses. He was staring out the window where the rain and the wind were blowing tracks of tears on the glass. If Steve was crying he clearly didn't want Tony to know. Which... Fair enough.
With a sinking feeling he realized there were no hospitals. And that there was absolutely nothing he could do for this poor child. He felt powerless in a way he'd never experienced before. He swallowed down a lump in his throat. The little girl was obviously loved despite her disfiguration, her clothes were clean and soft and the basket was lined with wool to keep her comfortable. She had stopped crying and was looking at him in wonder, reaching with her one tear stained, snot smeared hand up towards his face plate. Tony pressed his lips together and swallowed again with difficulty. He blindly reached into the bag and grabbed a handful of coins. He quickly shoved them under the wool bedding. He was about to get up and leave when he thought of what the people hiding in the alleys might do to a child touched by a demon. That could not possibly end well for this girl. She might not survive anyway, with whatever disease she was suffering from, but Tony couldn't screw up the little chance that she still had. So he leaned forward with his face to her outstretched hand and let it touch the metal. He pretended to be flung backwards by the force of her touch, pretended that it had somehow burned him, bellowing in agony. He heard the girl giggle as he staggered away with his sack and then he fired the thrusters and took to the air. A moment later a crying woman came running towards the basket. Tony hoped she'd be smart enough not to show the money to anyone else, he wouldn't put it past them to want it back.
“I put it on the coffee table for you,” came Steve's voice from behind him, “I wasn't sure if it would break if you slept on it.” Tony rubbed his eyes. Blankets, coffee and now tablet retrieval. That was a lot of random acts of kindness for Tony to process. Especially before he'd consumed said coffee. He had not planned on sleeping, but apparently the 40 odd hours he's been awake since the meeting in Fury's office had caught up with him. So much easier to stay awake when you were actually working on something. He was already missing his workshop and the ability to
Tony didn't expect Steve on Monday or Tuesday, but by Wednesday he started to get a little restless. He drowned himself in work and played with his cats, who were really quite cute when they were not a pain in the ass. And even then they were more funny than anything else. Thursday it was worse and he told himself not to be ridiculous. On Friday he thought he saw a flash of the white kitten with the orange ears before he started his shift at De Wijnhaven and he knew in heart that Steve would show up that evening.
Yeah, no. Like hell that was going to happen. That'd be like letting a baby duckling loose in the middle of 5th Avenue. A very strong and muscular and heroic baby duckling, so maybe the analogy wasn't quite what Tony was looking for, but still... no. Tony's conscience wouldn't survive it and that was saying something. Unfortunately, he could already tell Steve had a stubborn streak a mile wide and would be ridiculously opposed to receiving what he considered charity, so he had to come up with a viable alternative for his muscular duckling. He tapped his lips for a bit and then tried to sound casual.
They kissed for a long time. Once in awhile, either of them would pull back a little, barely able to break the contact of their lips and they would look at each other until their breathing calmed down and then one of them would smile. The other would echo the smile and then they would lean in once more, kissing softly as if they’d just met, gradually falling deeper into it, as they learned each other again. Finally they trailed off and slept, Tony tucked under Steve’s chin, never even having gotten under the blankets.
“Yeah, I think I can do that.” Um, that came out sounding a bit breathless. Forcing his voice back under control, he asked: “Shall we go, then?”
Tony was lying on his back on the bed and wondered if the room could be spinning more because the bed was round. He was quite sure it was possible but his alcohol soaked brain refused to come up with the appropriate centrifugal force equations. It was Steve's fault for dumping him on the bed after he rolled off the couch for the second time. Not that this bed was inspiring any confidence in him that he'd be able to stay on it, the way it was spinning. Steve wasn't in the bed, Tony could see him still on the couch, his face illuminated by Tony's tablet. Still perusing old
"I wasn't worried about you. I was worried about all the innocent people in this castle that would have been burned to a crisp after they were done with you. You should never have let that stupid girl go. Just because she shoved her boobs in your face and simpered at you." Morgaine pouted and thrusted her small breasts forward and continued in a high pitched voice. "Oh, Sir Anthony, I am sure it was all a misunderstanding. My village would never think I am a witch, just let me go back to my elderly mother, please." It was an admirable impression and Steve had to bite down on a laugh.
“Get him off his feet as soon as you can, Cap. He is not ready to be up this long and that leg needs rest.” Then he patted Steve on the shoulder, tried to frown at Tony, but smirked instead. Shaking his head he walked away, muttering. “Only you, Tony. Only you.”
“I am afraid the good Captain kissed you quite thoroughly, Man of Iron. I believe the Lady Widow has recorded it from yonder rooftop. Perhaps she can persuaded to share, if you are sorry you missed it.” Thor inclined his head, like he always did when he listened to his com unit. “Ah! She says you can find it on Youtube any time you want to see it.”
She nodded, obviously not caring all that much and turning her focus back on the dancing flame in her hand.
“Yech, that is positively medieval. Do it, I guess, but don't get caught.” He watched the man some more to see if he was going to approach or anything but the guy seemed content with just watching Steve for now.
“Here, gimme the soap,” Tony said as he plucked it out of Steve's hand and then he bowed his head in invitation. It couldn't be helped. Steve groaned inwardly as he dug his hands into Tony's hair. It was long and slippery between his fingers and Tony's skull was firm and warm against the tips. He tried to drown his desire with a semblance of military precision as he worked his way methodically over Tony's head. Tony, the bastard, moaned with pleasure. And it would be easy, it would be so fucking easy to tip Tony's head up and to just swallow that moan straight from his lips. Tony lifted his head, as if he was reading Steve's thoughts, his head pressing back against Steve's hands. Steve reflexively flexed his fingers, cradling the back of it. When Tony's eyes met his it was as if the air was suddenly sucked out of his lungs, his heart beating loudly in his ears. Seconds passed that felt like hours, both of them unmoving. Then Tony slowly lifted one hand.
"Come on!" Gawaine urged the squires still struggling with the tents, "Pack it up! Hurry! We need to leave. We have a quest." He swung himself into the saddle.
His bladder wakes him up at 2 am. He shuffles out into the hallway, but stops with his hand on the knob of the bathroom door when he notices a strip of light coming from under it. He's suddenly wide awake. Tony. He swallows and turns to go wait in his bedroom, when the light abruptly vanishes and the door opens and Steve has to press himself to the wall to let Tony by.
The apple dropped out of his slack fingers into the water but Tony didn't notice it. He was too busy being astounded by his own stupidity. He'd gone about this the wrong way around the entire fucking time! He couldn't believe he wasted these weeks trying to chase down word from Steve. When all this time he should have been spreading word of himself, packed in an attractively evil package, tied with a irresistible challenge as the pretty bow on top. Sprinkle it all with some references only Steve would get and the fool would come a-riding to Tony's rescue on a white horse with trumpets blaring and banners streaming in the wind.
As he handed over the soap their fingers brushed. Steve had to fight down the urge to pull Tony in when that happened. He wanted to plaster himself against that gloriously wet, naked body and bury his face in Tony's neck. To mouth along the ridge of his shoulder and up his neck to finally curl his tongue around his ear, while he placed his hands over the globes of his ass to pull him closer. To press his erection against the V of those hips.
All of a sudden, Tony pushed back forcefully, disgust on his face. It took Steve a moment to let him go.
. To fuck up. Into him. His hands snake out, aiming for Tony's hips, to pull him down, to impale him even more on Steve's dick, but Tony grabs his wrists.
Steve got up and padded over to where Tony was busy with a soldering iron and a staple gun. He pressed his front against Tony's back, just because he could and said softly: "So Hydra never showed last night...."
“Admirably efficient,” Tony finally conceded. “I’d never have thought of going through the wall. Gotta fortify the walls now. And I guess I had better add you to the door ward exemptions.” He suddenly grinned at Steve. It was like staring into the sun.
He considered calling Tony, now that he had his number, but he decided that whatever needed to be said was better said in person. He did call Nick Fury, though, to let him know he'd be in town next week.
“Dunno. Haven’t tried it. Right now I just feel a kind of pull in my belly and I am really tired. I’m gonna wait a bit and see if I can beat this thing.”
"At least take my scarf." Before Tony could say anything, he'd unwound it from his neck and wrapped it around Tony's. It was soft and warm and it smelled like Steve and Tony wanted to marry it. Steve was still holding on to the ends of the scarf when Tony looked up and met his eyes. Steve was looking at Tony as if he... This was the moment in the holiday movie where the dude would pull the girl in by the scarf and kiss her. And Tony realized with a sinking feeling and a stutter in his heart that he wanted that. That somehow in the last few hours he had gone and fallen for Steve and the whole ridiculous Christmas thing and he wanted nothing more at that moment than to close the distance and kiss Steve until he couldn't see straight. To feel the heat of his tongue in his mouth and his hands in his hair and that whole magnificent body wrapped around him. God, he must be delirious from hypothermia.
“Yeah? You think you can do that? You sure? Don't you need to practice? Why don't we practice? Right here. Nice dim hallway, perfect setting.”
“Listen,” Tony says when it becomes clear Steve isn't going to say anything, “This is probably an epically bad idea. But I am not exactly known for my carefully considered decisions anyway.” There is a small shrugs and he straightens up marginally. Steve's gaze is riveted on the other man.
"You don't want to know. Trust me." Tony placed his hands on both men's backs and started pushing them out of the workshop. Beers were obviously in order or these guys would remain good little soldiers for another couple of hours and that would be boring.
JARVIS' silence had a sullen edge to it. Just as Tony rolled over to stick his head back under his pillow, JARVIS turned on all the screens in the bedroom and tuned them to CNN. The Avengers were fighting a giant squid that was pulling people off a promenade into the Hudson river. Despite his best intentions, Tony couldn't help but look a little closer at how they were doing. Checking that they really didn't need him. Natasha's bullets didn't seem to be doing anything, and even Clint's exploding arrows didn't do much. The chunks they were tearing out of the thing oozed a little and then closed back up. Its brain must be hiding deep inside, somewhere in between the roughly 37 tentacles. Thor's hammer was just kind of bouncing back on the gelatinous mass, but the Hulk seemed to be doing alright ripping off tentacles left and right. They grew back apparently, but not super fast. No need for repulsors then, Hulk would get the thing eventually. He was about to lay his head back down and shut his eyes when the camera zoomed in on a man that was held aloft in 3 of the tentacles, struggling mightily as the creature was dunking him in and out of the water.
Steve was familiar with the type. Nice to know they weren't a twentieth century invention. And Gawaine didn't know it yet, but he was about to stop picking on Percival, at least as long as Steve was in earshot. The moment they stepped into the clearing, though, a man entered from the other side. He was dressed in something whitish and shapeless and his gray beard was matted, with a few leaves and twigs stuck into it. His eyes shone with fervor. Tony would have tossed him a twenty dollar bill and muttered something derogatory about Reagan closing all the mental hospitals, while making a quick getaway. Here, the man held his audience captive. Lancelot was looking up from his seat on a fallen log, the two squires halted their attempts at erecting the tents and Gawaine and Percival stared at him, the latter sucking on the heel of his thumb. Steve and Bors came to a stop too. No one called out a greeting.
Steve shook his head. "No. I've just been told where to report in Barcelona on Saturday for debriefing. This isn't a standard military operation, not enough blazing guns for that. I don't know how they get their intelligence, but I doubt they were involved with anything Black Widow took part in." He looked thoughtful. "What
Also, in retrospect, Tony wasn't so sure Loki hadn't just been fucking with him at the time. It was just as likely Loki had picked him specifically because he knew how lost he would be and Loki found that amusing.
Steve failed to talk to Tony for more than a week. It wasn't Tony's fault, he'd tried several times during the first few days. But Steve couldn't even look at him without being mortified, let alone talk to him like a rational person. As soon as Tony started to address him, it would all come rushing back -damn the eidetic memory- and Steve would be torn between the overwhelming rush of feeling Tony underneath him, naked and wanting, Tony's mouth on him, Tony's arms and legs around him, and the paralyzing fear that Tony would find out what Steve wanted to do to him. What Steve
The bus hit a pothole and their shoulders bumped and settled together. A flare of heat jolted through Steve at the contact. Tony didn't pull away. Neither did Steve. Di-sas-ter, he told himself, but it didn't help.
“To muggles, yes. To me, Rumpelstiltskin is the founder of the Stark fortune. First one to figure out that particular transfiguration. Made a killing before the practice got regulated to save the economy. We still have bales of the stuff in our vaults.”
?” He laced that sentence heavily with sarcasm. “It was just a fuck, asshole. I’m not a swooning maiden.”
"The village we passed had a healer. If we get him there quickly she can stitch him up and he'll have a chance." If he didn't get an infection, or blood poisoning, or gangrene, or if he didn't die in any of the other hundreds of creative ways this century seemed to delight in. Tristan seemed to read his thoughts, or maybe he was more of a realist in general.
." And he slowly pulled Steve closer, his eyes never leaving Steve's and kissed him. Softly, this time and somehow that was even worse. It was like being laid open, with all his warts and insecurities and to have someone -Tony- smile at him regardless. He couldn't stand it, it was too much, he wanted it too much. Steve pulled away as much as he could, which was barely an inch and breathed: "Tony...."
smile and Steve wanted to preen a little. Then Tony turned back to Dane. "Problem solved. Del will take us back."
something. He'd understood the need to run tests when he'd first woken up, he really did, but it was now more than a year later and it was still test after test after damned test and no action whatsoever. So he thought it was at least understandable if he had gotten a little carried away.
“Alright. I guess. I'll take your word for it. Anyway, you've been deployed. You may not have done it, but you sure have heard about it. What do you know? What am I working with here?”
"Dammit, " said Tony, "I was hoping that was a rule he made up especially for me, so I could ignore it."
Tony had been right on the no hat and the pink cheeks thing, but Steve's scarf was a boring plaid one. He also was a competent skater, if not quite Brian Boitano. Natasha was more than a competent skater. If Tony didn't know better, and really, he might actually not, he'd think she'd grown up in one of those Cold War athlete factories the Eastern Block used to sport. Clint was having fun, and that's the most Tony would say about his skills. Tony shivered a bit in his coat, it wasn't quite New York City winter proof, but the ones that were were just too unflattering to be seen in in public. Genius, billionaire, philanthropist, Michelin Man was not just not how he saw himself. He was contemplating getting a hot chocolate to take some of the chill off when Steve spotted him. The smile that broke out on Steve's face was blinding and it must have done something weird to Tony's brain, because, despite protesting vehemently, Tony found himself on the ice with the other Avengers fifteen minutes later.
Steve tried really hard not to imagine what that would be like, to ride that sleek monster seated behind Tony, with his arms wrapped around the smaller boy. Flying through the winter nights, with the wind in their faces, chasing the moon. He failed spectacularly.
"Steeeeeve...." Tony could barely get the word out. Steve tore his gaze away from Tony's dick and covered his mouth with his own. The kiss was sloppy, filthy and perfect and lasted until it was reduced to just panting into each other's mouths.
"Excellent, thank you. Black Widow? This is Captain Rogers, United States Armed Forces, are you in a position to confirm how many assailants we are dealing with?
"Back to sleep, Captain Nemo. We have a busy day in Rome tomorrow." And Tony rolled onto his side, his back to Steve.
"You know. I find you, I kiss you, you hack up a piece of apple and everything returns to normal. Or vice versa. Anyway, the theory that us meeting would be enough to send us back."
Over the next few days Steve did a lot of holding things for Tony while Tony did extremely complicated stuff that Steve had a hard time following. Tony explained the basic premises as he went and they made kind of sense to Steve, but it was a little like Tony explaining the concept of a ball to him and Steve just about understanding that he was talking about a small, round bouncy thing, only to watch Tony start to juggle 17 multi-colored ones in ever more complicated patterns, using phantom appendages that Steve hadn’t even known existed. It was fascinating.
"Seriously, Steve, I'll be here when you get back. I promise I won't run off with any hermits. I'll just take a nap or something.”
Lancelot looked back at him. “Hermits are holy men,” he explained when he saw Steve didn't understand. “They know things that we know not and they always speak truth. We are sworn to heed their words. Great evil befalls those who ignore them. Please do not jeopardize our quest by lingering, Sir Stephen.”
“Must be why their kids in Hogwarts keep trying to get me hooked on shit. Get the Stark heir in their pocket and dependent on them”
"Two off," breathed Steve and then he was kissing him. God, it was even better without the facial hair, although Tony would never admit it out loud, because he wasn't shaving his own. Steve was still warm from his shower and Tony slid his fingers into the damp hair at Steve's neck, getting lost in the feel of his mouth on his own. The pressure, the taste, the hint of tongue, it all was so fucking perfect Tony thought he might be ruined after this. The thought flitted through his head that getting ruined shortly before dying wasn't as scary as it otherwise might have been. And then it dawned on him that if this was a two off and there was no guarantee of being able to talk Steve into a three off before he cacked, there was no way he was going to let this opportunity go by without at least getting a
Steve saw the armor first. Tony hadn’t bothered to turn the light on so he was standing in the dark, while the orange glow of the street light through the window was glinting off his suit. Steve’s eyes widened in surprise and then alarm and Tony realized that the suit was kinda collapsed against the wall as if it had been shot and Steve wouldn’t know he wasn’t in it.
She rolled her eyes and turned back to Steve. It was almost a dance, the way she moved from one side to the other, cutting quickly and efficiently. Then she took the trimmer and pushed Steve’s head forward to buzz his neck.
His disdain couldn't be clearer and Steve should really walk away now because the guy is obviously a dick and Steve owes him nothing. Except that he still feels guilty for expecting him to be an immigrant with minimal English skills.
in the throes of death, it was full on afternoon and the three men could barely lift their lances anymore. They left the carcass on the beach for the screeching gulls and dragged themselves up the cliff path.
“I'm from Brooklyn, actually, and not really religious.” Tony could hear the trace of the accent now. “But, yes, I love my country.” Steve stuck his head out the door and frowned at him. Tony gave him a big, fake Cheshire Cat grin in return, with just a little bit of 'don't fuck with me' in the eyes. I took a moment, but then Steve smiled and retreated, shaking his head. At Tony or at himself for not berating Tony for his shocking lack of patriotism, that wasn't entirely clear, but he guessed they were still good. Good, that was good. Even if Steve hadn't answered the important part of the question. Which was interesting. Far more interesting than the fact that Tony apparently gave a fuck whether he had Steve's approval or not. Right.
“Indeed, it is.” It sounds like Tony might be smiling again, but Steve doesn't dare look up and check.
Tony was doodling on his notepad when someone dropped heavily into the seat next to him. Suppressing a surge of annoyance at his personal space being invaded, he glanced to his right. Dark hair, some kind of mall cop uniform, and a prosthetic left hand that was laying lifelessly on a muscled thigh. It took a second for him to connect the dots. Could it…?
"Of course not, Captain Ramius." Tony sneered. Steve was fairly sure that had not been the name of the captain of the
"I am sure I have no idea, Sir. Mr. Barton is indeed baking, but the workshop's ventilation system is not connected to the kitchen."
“YOU PUNY MORTALS CAN NOT STAND AGAINST ME. YOUR WEAPONS WILL NOT HARM ME. BUT I CAN HARM THIS BOY IF I SO CHOOSE.”
Someway, somehow, Pepper had managed to find a WWII army dress uniform that fit Steve and the way he entered the room with his cap under his arm and a shy smile and a small wave of his hand, there wasn’t a person there who didn’t instantly fall a little bit in love with him. Steve talked with ease, made it seem delighted that he was there with all of them and had obviously been briefed within an inch of his life by Pepper. He made Tony sound like a swell guy, who had completely selflessly searched for him for decades in secret and offered him a safe haven to get adjusted to these confusing modern times. He played endearingly discombobulated when reporters tried testing his knowledge of recent events, he told some funny war stories and managed to be so ‘Aw Shucks’ about his ordeal, that Tony had an almost irrepressible urge to lean in towards the microphone and announce. “I sucked his dick, yesterday. Just so you know.” But then he spotted Fury and Natalie behind the crowd of reporters and he got distracted.
And so Tony got to spend another two hours in the blissful torture of almost but not quite being plastered to Steve's side while they watched Jimmy Stewart being pummeled by life. Tony personally thought this fucking movie was bullshit, but even that fact seemed to have lost its relevance this night.
Before the boy could answer there was a shout from below where two identical teenage boys with lanky black hair were looking up impatiently: "Hey squirt! Get a move on. We wanna go see dead people!"
Steve trailed his lips down Tony’s throat and chest and gently bit his nipple. Fuck. He hadn’t even known those were sensitive. He’d thought that was a girl thing. But when Steve sucked it into a peak, he wanted to sob and beg. Steve popped off and looked at him with a crooked smile.
“Yeah. Still a crack shot. Even with the one arm. Took a local job, so I could be around to see Steve.”
"Shush, Tony. It's fine. It looks fine. How was it made? It's not animation and it's not puppets, what is it?"
He hadn't even known Stark Industries was still searching the polar seas for a trace of Captain America's downed plane every summer. Apparently it was done by some shady subdivision of SI that had been funded for the rest of eternity by dear old Dad. Because of course it was. The man never gave up on Captain America, at least.
"I wondered, but I don't think so. He's not as jittery as the guys behind the train station, and he's never asked me for money. I can tell he doesn't even like it when I give him food. I think it hurts his pride. He doesn't refuse it, though."
"I don't want to fuck his ass!" Fury rolled his eye. "Jesus! I have no interest in his ass. I want him on the Avengers."
Steve laid back down and removed Tony's come streaked shirt. Then he wrapped himself around Tony in the way that made Tony feel mushy in ways he didn't want to admit yet. Steve mumbled something into his hair.
God, it was fantastic. Tony would have happily spent the rest of the night doing just this, but the longer they kissed, the more his dick started clamoring for attention. If they kept this up, he’d be coming in his jeans in no time and that was really not how he wanted this to end. He started tugging up on Steve’s shirt and slid his hands under. That was the moment Steve pulled his mouth from Tony’s and leaned his forehead against his.
"I swear I will find it and bring it back for you, Sir Galahad." Lancelot's voice was firm. Everyone looked at him. Steve could tell Galahad wanted to protest, but he quelled the boy with a look. When he was confident Galahad had gotten the message that if he didn't have something nice to say then he shouldn't say anything, he brought his attention back to the situation at hand. Both Arthur and Guinevere looked like they wanted to protest. Steve didn't get their dynamics, really. Ostensibly the word was that Arthur was being cuckolded by his best friend and his wife and Steve thought that was probably true given the looks he'd intercepted between Lancelot and the Queen, but in Steve's personal opinion it wasn't really all that clear cut who Arthur was jealous of in this situation. The way he looked at Lancelot was often more heated than the way he looked at his wife. Could be jealous rage, of course, but Steve didn't think that was it. The stricken way the royal pair looked just now reaffirmed his opinion they would both be pining for Lancelot in his absence. But Arthur had no choice but to affirm Lancelot's decision, now that he had sworn to it.
For the second time in two days he cries with his ass on the floor and his pants around his knees. It's a much smaller event, though, and it's over pretty quickly.
Tony’s stomach plummeted. He cursed himself for not expecting this, for being taken unaware. But fuck, last night had been- You know, not something he would run away from. And he couldn’t help being a little hurt and more than a little pissed at Steve that he would.
The tree decorating segued into movie night whith all of them piled on the sectional having a lengthy argument about what modern Christmas movies Steve really had to see. They'd be there till Easter with the way everyone kept adding movies to the list, so Tony finally just told J.A.R.V.I.S. to start whatever modern Christmas movie had the highest rating on Rotten Tomatoes and
think that, you big sap" Tony scoffed, "Whatever. As long we can stop talking and start doing it, I'm good with whatever reason. I want you to fuck me." If Steve had been a dog his ears would have perked up. Tony pushed him to the bed.
“Hello beautiful,” he crooned softly and Steve told himself not to be stupid. One didn’t get jealous of a motorcycle.
“Not in the database I have readily available, sir. I could search foreign national databases if you like, but it's going to significantly impact the ship's available bandwidth and I'd likely be discovered in the system. Performing the search in a way that would not raise the suspicions of the sys admin would take up to 24 hours to complete.”
Steve nodded happily. "Where is it?" He asked Percival, who immediately looked even more embarrassed than before.
“Are you a fucking genius, or what? If we give you the guy's notes and publications, I'm sure you'll be able to bullshit your way more convincingly than any spook we'd send.”
"Howard! It's you! That's your voice and your big words." Steve peered at Tony as if trying to force his vision to behave. Or to turn Tony's face into his father's. "When did you grow a beard?" he asked jovially.
Steve and Bors were on their way back with firewood when they heard Percival yelp in pain and Gawaine roar with laughter from the direction of the camp.
She cried. Of course, she cried. She'd had been betrayed by her friends and lost her family and the life she thought she was going to have. Tony patted her awkwardly on the back, uncomfortably weathering this storm. He didn't think hugs were in order on such short acquaintance and other people's tears were not something he dealt with well. He suppressed a sigh of relief when she finally hiccuped to a halt and angrily rubbed her eyes. She looked at him with red blotches and tear stains all over her face and Tony was suddenly a bit glad he'd saved her. It wasn't like he'd put this world to rights, or anything close to that, but even little things made big differences to the people involved. The woman slid down from the table. She cleared her throat and curtsied clumsily.
Draco discreetly pointed in Tony’s direction and Harry’s eyes followed. First they went comically wide and then he started grinning. He looked at Steve, who wished he could sink through the floor.
Fury was much more prompt in answering his phone than Bell had been. Probably because he'd been trying to get a hold of Tony for more than a week.
Steve doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing as Tony stumbles clumsily out of Steve's double bed, but he is too tired to care much. He's asleep before Tony has left the room.
"Tony, I think you're brilliant." Steve was smiling now. That fucking smile that was going to be the death of Tony. "You get distracted by... shiny stuff. So what. Every man has something he loses focus over. Nobody is that perfect. If you were one of my men, I'd just make a note to keep you aimed in the right direction, as well as cover your back, and that really goes without saying, I hope you know that. I'd have you on my team any day." He looked wistfully out at the sea, while Tony quietly tried to deal with all the stupidly warm and fuzzy feelings those words called up.
“Okay,” said Tony, after they had changed into lounge pants and t-shirts and he'd had a fortifying drink or three, “I know you haven't done it, and I don't know how that is even possible looking like you do....”
“Or! Or I could stay here, avoid a disturbing amount of pain and mentally record what's going to happen here for my spank bank. Or I could physically record it and put it... Ouch! Goddammit, Thor, I am not a kitten! Put me down!”
Afghanistan. He thought his libido had died with Bucky, but here it is, coming back online for a sweaty, no doubt smelly stranger. As novel as it is to realize he isn't dead below the belt, it's inconvenient right now, so he is going to ignore it. It's not like he is going to make a pass at Goat Man.
But when Tony touched Steve's hand, meaning it to be an unobtrusive gesture of comfort, Steve turned his hand over and laced their fingers together. They remained like that until Tony had to shift down after they took the exit to the airfield. Fucking sports cars with their manual transmissions.
“Oooh, let's go see the Rockettes! I want to see the Rockettes!” exclaimed Steve. Tony couldn't tell if he was serious or not. He decided not.
Tony counted to three in his head. “Why don't you just stick with simple translations, JARVIS. We wouldn't want to waste battery power, now would we?”
Stark strolled out of the bathroom while Steve was still working up the courage to touch anything in the suitcase. He came over and stood next to Steve, following his stare.
“Probably that Black Widow is on a mission and hasn't checked in when she was supposed to. Shit, I should have been there!”
"Alright. I can do that." He threw his arms around Thor and went for a godly volume as he bellowed in return: "Welcome to you and yours, friend Thor! Merry Yuletide to you all. Let's pass the wassail and drink to everyone's health!" Thor pounded him happily on the back while everyone started cheering as if this was some momentous occasion and Tony really needed to start hanging out with different people if this qualified as a cheering opportunity. Then Thor called for the Wassail Bowl, by which he apparently meant the soup tureen, and poured about half a gallon of the hot, sweet, spicy and above all alcoholic concoction down Tony's throat and after that everything was pretty much a blur. A blur with an astounding amount of singing in it.
She finally left and Tony stifled a sigh before he looked at Steve. Ignoring whatever it was he could or could not see on his face, he offered a distraction.
"I don't see Howard when I look at you,” he barreled on. “Sure, sometimes there is a moment, when you tilt your head a certain way, or that frowny look that you do, that you remind me of him. But, really, you're one hundred percent Tony to me. You're not very alike." He paused, then decided to go for broke. "In the beginning I wanted to see him in you, desperately. But you were nothing like him. And I was disappointed at first. Which was why I was such an ass to you back then." He shrugged.  "Or at least it was part of the reason. Loki's scepter didn't help, I guess. But honestly, Tony, I am not looking for your father when I look at you. I haven't for a long time.” He silently said a Hail Mary before continuing. “I actually prefer you, these days.”
The man smiled. "Orders from Ms Potts, sir. I have been told to report at all the ports of call of the
“I guess I am not going anywhere anytime soon.” Steve said it lightly, but Tony could hear the question behind it. It’d be impossible not to, considering Steve’s situation. He carefully kept his tone light as he answered.
"Bless your heart, you magnificent witch." Tony muttered and then looked at Steve, smile turned wistful.
Tony regretted sitting down on the bench almost immediately. Now his ass was freezing too. Steve sat down next to him, a solid wall of warmth and Tony could not help leaning in a little closer. Steve set the tree down between his knees and held on to it with his legs, apparently with total ease. Tony tried very hard not to imagine Steve's massively muscled naked thighs, because it seemed a little too pornographic for the romcom they were acting out, but then he realized it would be impossible to get an erection with the way his balls were trying to crawl up into his body cavity to get away from the freezing bench, so he indulged himself until Steve got the tree settled and turned to him to hold up his hand for a chestnut. The way Steve smiled at him as he did so, was enough to wipe even naked thighs from his mind.
“Okay, so just for the sake of argument, who is this Porter fellow and what is the deal with Hydra?”
At home, he opened a can of food for Steve-the-cat and promised him a trip to the vet in the morning. Tasha came over and tried to help herself too, but Stevie obviously wasn’t ready to share yet and she was forced to beat a retreat. Tony pushed Steve-the-man into the bathroom, with a towel and some of his own night clothes and then he changed as well and fell back on the bed, staring at the ceiling while he listened to the hiss of the shower on the other side of the door.
The cat slunk a little closer and carefully sniffed Tony’s fingers. Then it finally started eating the little bits of kibble. Tentatively, Tony stretched out the fingers of his other hand and scratched him softly between the ears. Steve produced a stuttering purr, but didn’t stop eating, so Tony slid the hand under his belly and slowly stood up. The treats were gone now, but Steve was still nosing his hand looking for more and he didn’t struggle. By now, Tony had plenty of knowledge of how cats liked to be held and he fitted him comfortably in his arm, while keeping up a soothing stream of whispered promises, while Steve licked his hand with his raspy tongue.
“They need it,” nodded Thor. “And it’ll be a good excuse not to let him go back out tonight, if his clothes are hanging on the line.” They didn’t have a dryer, so one of the hallways was strung with laundry lines. In weeks like this, when they had to keep the windows closed it was a slow, slightly musty smelling process, but everything got dry eventually. But it took at least half a day. It used to take longer, though, before Tony had turbo charged the spin cycle of their washer.
What now? Conjure up a blanket and let Tony sleep here? By himself? That didn’t feel right. Okay.  Best try to get him to bed then.
When Tony was eighteen and close to finishing both degrees, his parents died in a car accident. Obie sent him a plane ticket to attend the funeral. It was one way, first class. Tony took it to a travel agent and exchanged it for a return ticket in coach. He pocketed the difference. He made it through the ceremony numb and dry eyed. When Obie slung his arm around his shoulder and started talking about his responsibilities at Stark Industries, Tony excused himself to go to the bathroom, took a cab to the airport, and flew back to Amsterdam. He started breathing better as soon as he walked out of the train station in Delft.
"He was. For weeks. Very angry. With everyone. When he stopped being angry, he sent you his lawyers. Since then he's mostly been missing you. Why didn't you go see him after the trial?"
"Alright, let me know when I am close enough. Tony, hold my cup and block me from sight for a few seconds, pretend to admire the view or something." He moved Tony in front of him, so he was in between him and the arguing couple and hopped over the railing, catching the bars at the bottom so he hung with his hands on deck level on the outside of the ship. He was just going to hope nobody on the lower level would be looking out the window and spot his legs.
“So it needs to be sentient to respond quick enough to the riders commands?” Steve asked for clarification.
The kittens were nosing around a dead sparrow, exactly where Steve had indicated they would be. The white and orange one spotted them first and took off like an arrow. That one was going to be a problem, as skittish as it was. The white and black one stood his ground for a bit. It hissed and puffed up its tiny tail, but when Steve squatted and stuck out his hand to try and grab it, it ran through Tony's legs and was lost in the shadows a moment later. Tony cursed his own slowness. He shouldn't count on Steve's skills, thinking they were infallible.
“Shut it, Stark.” It sounded like a threat. “Here, let me show you Corbin.” The next picture that was pulled up on the monitor bore an uncanny resemblance to the guy in countless memes that had crossed Tony's own screens when lack of sleep and sustenance seemed to conspire to make him think multitasking and social media were a good thing.
“Godfuckingdammit,” Tony pants, heartfelt. Steve has no words, not even curses, so they lay there just breathing heavily for a while. Tony's head lolling against Steve's rib cage, one of his hands spread possessively on the inside of Steve's thigh.
Less something anyway. Considering his recent fantasies about Tony, Uncle Steve immediately felt like a pervert preying on the innocent. Not that he would have had said fantasies if he'd known Tony as a kid, lord help him. Or even as a young man. He'd seen the pictures of a baby faced Tony in his twenties and he much preferred the worn man next to him, who carried his experiences in the lines on his face. The good, the bad and the ugly. God, it was still so strange to be both older and younger. He shook his head and dared a smile.
The last minute rental selection in the store was abysmal, there was no other word for it. Unless he gained 40 pounds by 2 pm, grew another foot or would consent to going in baby blue, there was nothing available.
Steve carefully picked up the wounded man, who had fortunately passed out while his fate was being decided and started walking towards the camp where they had left the horses.
"Wait here a sec," said Steve, while Tony dragged in a big gulp of air at the end of that overly long sentence. He came back five minutes later with two Santa hats.
The first raft he'd gotten to was the one Clint had shot and it had been sinking rapidly. Two of the men had already boarded and were guarding the entry point in all directions, except up. So Steve had maneuvered silently until he was right above one of the guys and dropped on top of him. He'd heaved him over the side by time the other man had turned around and there had only been a brief scuffle before that guy went flying. The grappling hook was severed without much problems and that had taken care of that raft. He'd repeated the procedure with the second raft he came to although the fight was more satisfying, because this raft had managed to land six of the men already. Still a piece of cake though. The third raft he'd got to had already unloaded though and all the occupants had disappeared inside the ship. That is when Steve had looked up himself and had spotted the goons standing on a balcony that he assumed was his and Tony's, so up he'd gone and taken care of those.
It took long enough, though. Eventually he tied the horses up and sat himself against a rock, enjoying the morning sunshine.
the lab break in that Steve and I were just decoys, stealing some poor saps' honeymoon. In fact, you deliberately misstated Widow's conclusions to make us stay put."
Steve reached out for Tony’s hand and drew him closer. His other hand cupped Tony’s jaw and Tony couldn’t help but press into it. Steve kissed him softly, a barely there pressure of lips that made Tony’s heart seize nonetheless.
at me.” He spread his arms in invitation. “I have no armor, I have no weapons, I have no superpowers. I have no JARVIS even and no fortune. All I have right now are my brain and my middle aged body, that hates me in the morning after sleeping on the ground all night. That, and a failing arc reactor, that is all I have. You know how fucking powerless I feel right now? Almost as powerless as I did in that fucking Afghan cave, almost as powerless as I did when Stane took the reactor out of my chest. Almost as powerless as I did when I thought I was dying of palladium poisoning. There you have it, the three low points of my adult life. And if there is anything I can do to avoid feeling like that ever again, you better believe I am going to do it.”
“Right. I should let you rest.” Steve made to move away and Tony grabbed him by his newly shorn hair.
"Only if you're not particularly concerned with public safety. Or in charge of security for your own visiting genius/billionaire. Then it's a damned nightmare."
“Ehm... Guys would talk about making love to their girlfriends, but not about... sharing or watching other guys with their girls.... and definitely not.....” He hesitated. Tony waited, but that seemed to be as far as Steve could go.
“The asshole doesn't deserve that.” Steve couldn't tell if Tony was really bummed or not. “Sorry if that was painful. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.”
Steve did. He carried Tony all the way to the bedroom and Tony didn't care if that wasn't a particularly masculine thing to have done to him. It put him in the perfect position to enjoy the friction against his dick as he clung to Steve, arms and legs wrapped around him. And Steve made delightful tortured noises as he endured Tony's sucking and biting on his ear while he clumsily tried to navigate the doorways. He intended to toss Tony on the bed but Tony stuck like a limpet and dragged Steve down with him. They took turns removing bits of clothing and each newly revealed bit of skin was greeted like a long lost friend.
"A sodomite! I know you are disgusted now, little man. You'd better go. You can't win. Once he spills, the Grail is lost and his soul his mine."
Yet here he was, on a cruise ship instead of in Afghanistan. Yesterday might have been the weirdest day he had ever had, and while he could not say that it had been pleasant, it really had not been unpleasant either. Somehow it had gone a ways to filling that empty space inside him. It had certainly had its moments. He smiled while thinking about the way Tony had told off the seniors, the conversation about explosives, the ridiculous ice cream Tony had insisted on buying him, the hug, the hand holding, the.... yeah. No Bucky, no Peggy, no Howard, but damn, Howard's son's forceful personality had relegated the others a little bit more to the past, where Steve knew they belonged, while carving out a big space for himself in Steve's present in just two days.
dance with the instructor. Who danced so much better than Steve, it was no wonder he was enjoying himself, but common sense and Steve's feelings had apparently had a recent falling out and weren't on speaking terms.
When he woke up the sun was much higher in the sky and yet, there was no sign of Steve and Percy. Something wasn't right. He pushed himself up to standing and walked over to the little chapel. He couldn't hear anything from inside the little building, but that would have been the case if they were still praying too. The first thing he noticed when he opened the door was a hint of a smell. It wasn't incense. It smelled a lot like sulfur but it was overlaid with something much sweeter. There was still no sound. When his eyes had adjusted to the gloom within the windowless little structure, he saw there was nothing inside. No altar, no pews and most importantly, no Steve or Percy. He cursed under his breath. There was no way they would have left him and the horses behind while he slept, so they still had to be here. Warily, he entered the building, on his guard for any undead creatures that might want to devour him.
“I dunno. Use Rogers.” Bruce waved dismissively at Steve. “He’s got plenty of practice in not flying into an incoherent rage when you insult him.”
Even without the coordinates provided by JARVIS, the commotion was easy to spot. Tony swooped in from overhead and breathed a sigh of relief to see the Kraken still busy dunking Steve on one side while fighting the Hulk on the other. Steve was still struggling, but couldn't get a grip on the slippery tentacles. Tony aimed the repulsor at the three arms trying to strangle Steve and said a little prayer as he fired while Steve was on the upswing. It worked like a charm, the repulsors cutting through the slimy limbs like a hot knife through butter. Steve went flying and Tony sped after him to catch him. He set him down on the promenade and dumped the suit and shield at his feet.
“Too bad we aren't really married,” he called back at Steve, “You could cover me with blankets whenever I fall asleep, and make me coffee every morning, and on nice days like this you could fuck me over the railing here.” He heard a clatter inside the cabin and a mutter that could possibly the first curse word he'd heard Steve say. Shitshitshit, not enough sleep. Not enough coffee. Not enough brain cells firing to remember that Steve hadn't been exactly thrilled about the pretend gay married thing.
"Yes, we are." Tony's mouth provided the words on autopilot. He swallowed hard and forced himself to look away. "Totally screwed." He somehow kept his voice light as he shut his eyes and willed it to go away, that need to kiss Steve. That overwhelming need to kiss Steve, that didn't even feel sexual. He didn't want to rip the guy's clothes off. Well, not right this minute. He was sure he'd want to eventually. But right now, he wanted so very badly to turn around and be wrapped in Steve's arms and to rest his forehead against his and then softly bring their lips together. Smile against his mouth. Maybe trail his fingers through the ridiculous hair a bit. Slide his thumb along those cheekbones. He could not recall wanting something so scarily.... tender ever before. He shuddered at the word. This was not okay. Lust was okay. Lust was simple, lust wasn't so fucking
“You're losing your touch, Cap.” Tony's voice was muffled by his face being pressed into Steve's neck. “That was way too close and it took for-fucking-ever! Way to make me feel useless, you asshole.”
Heads turned as Tony did a quick survey of the room. All were accounted for, but the object of his wrath was standing by the kitchen counter, wearing a soft looking pair of sweats and an obnoxiously tight t-shirt that showed off all the massive muscles Tony had been deprived off recently. His hair was cut short again. When he turned around and spotted Tony his face did a happy-concerned-shuttered thing that Tony hated. He started forward on his crutches but was immediately waylaid by Bruce.
Gawaine was happy enough to lose him and the challenge Steve posed to his self appointed leadership. And Steve was happy enough to let the man go and make a nuisance of himself elsewhere.
He isn't sorry he goes to work. The kids are great today, they keep him pleasantly distracted and he stays after school with some of the Advanced Art seniors who are putting together 3-D animatronic monsters for the school play. It's a bitch of a project, but these kids are burning so bright, they're almost incandescent.
“Just because you are sartorially oblivious,” countered Draco, “doesn’t mean that Tony and Steve aren’t making a statement with their choice of dress.”
“Airport, flight, another limo, possible a stop to drop you guys’s stuff off at the mansion and then we go get burgers at Burger Heaven.”
He took the path along the creek towards the beach and was really glad to see he'd picked the right direction, so he wouldn't have to drag his ass all the way back, wheezing and panting.
Abdel seemed slightly disconcerted. “Well of course I am hoping we will all find some degree of satisfaction, but we were not prepared to make a monetary offer. At least...at least not at this time.” He tugged on the cuffs of his tux. Tony flinched at the move, but relaxed when nothing else seemed to happen. “We do need to make sure of the utmost discretion.”
He held a door open for Steve that looked like delicately spun glass. Steve made sure not to leave any marks on it.
The house elves must have brought Tony’s clothes to him in the bathroom, because he came out fifteen minutes later, dressed in clean pants and a thin shirt. Steve had washed up at the sink, gotten dressed and cleaned up the glitter in the meantime. He was rummaging in his trunk, looking for a jumper, when Tony spoke up.
“His name is Steve. Hey, maybe you've seen him on your travels. He is big and blond and very strong.”
That was true. Steve forced his muscles to relax and fitted his body more closely alongside Tony's. The want was still there, but so was the need for comfort, overwhelmingly so. He still felt a little raw and exposed inside and a bit panicky about what to do about it. He could just take the comfort, couldn't he? Just the comfort and the closeness and nothing else. He let out a shuddery sigh and Tony tightened his arm.
fucking Tony. On the one hand he's good with Tony staying in this exact position for a week or so. On the other hand, he
"It's only a country because France hasn't bothered to pick its nose and swallow the booger. That, and they hold a Grand Prix in the middle of the city."
And he sent postcards to Tony from almost every place he visited. At least one a day, and sometimes more than one. The first ones were just signed, but after a week or so he started adding little drawings of things he saw. Quick sketches in ballpoint, anything else wouldn't work on a card. He drew gazebos and cows and trees. Sunsets were hard to do in ballpoint, but he tried anyway. Once, on a not so good day, when he was wondering what the hell he was doing all by himself in Bumfuck, Ohio, he drew a little cartoon of Tony with his soldering iron and wrote 'Miss you' under it. He regretted it as soon as he'd dropped it in the mailbox, but he couldn't get it back. He was more careful after that, but he didn't stop sending the cards, he didn't think he could at this point. They were a lifeline to him.
Steve regarded the woman. She seemed to be on the far side of middle age and she reminded him of one of his mother’s friends who had worn too much make up.
." That made Steve laugh and Tony, encouraged, continued: "Can we go do the manly thing now and fuck our feelings away?"
He forced himself to focus on the boner killer zombie in the center of the fight, who still showed no signs of anything affecting it at all. Percival slipped and stumbled and the thing lunged for him, but Steve caught it square in what passed for its face with the shield. He hit it with a force that should have shattered any bones the thing had, but that only distracted it long enough to miss Percival. Tony first thought the knight had slipped on the water their cloaks had been dripping all over the church floor but then he noticed that the thing left footsteps that were shinier than the puddles of water. What the hell was that? It didn't look like blood, it wasn't dark enough. But whether it was ichor or embalming fluid or whether the thing was wetting its pants, Tony had no clue. It didn't actually matter, he thought, the important question was, was it flammable? Apart from actually going to get a sample and analyzing it, which wasn't going to happen, he could only think of one practical way to find out.
He removed an icicle from his mustache. Obviously Pepper was still angry. At least she didn't hate him, or else she would have let him pack his own suitcase and he'd be freezing his cojones off here in a speedo and sunglasses. Now he was still freezing his cojones off, but at least he was doing it in a parka packed by Pepper, so, unhappy as said cojones were with the lack of action, the family jewels might actually survive this trip. On the upside, there was no need to find proper refrigeration for his vodka, he had bottles stashed all over the upper deck of this polar expedition ship and they were all properly frozen under the merry light of the midnight sun.
Clint winced. "Shit, you're old, Stark. But you're making my point beautifully." He pointed at Tony, Natasha and himself. "You, her, me: We know nothing about how to make this holiday meaningful. Him..." he pointed at Steve, who was wearing a sad little smile that Tony really hoped wasn't for him personally, "Out of date as he is, his soul isn't as jaded as ours. So we're doing this Steve's way. Which means that Nat and I are going to get decorations and baking supplies and you and Steve are getting a tree." He turned to Natasha. "Let's go. You got the list, babe?"
He couldn’t make out the features of the figure outlined in the alley exit, it was too dark and the streetlight was behind him and he was too far away, but he could tell by the way the man was standing, bag slung over his shoulder and hand shoved into a pocket. He looked down at the Steve in his arms, who had decided to go to sleep, now that he had some food in his belly and was being held by someone who smelled like other -probably familiar- cats and more food. Then he looked back up at the other Steve, his mouth suddenly dry. What were the fucking odds? He half expected Steve to dissolve into moonlight as he started walking closer, but he didn’t move, watching Tony approach in silence. Tony halted a yard or so away and looked him over. He was a little more gaunt, a little more ragged, but the biggest difference was the short beard Steve had grown. Tony tried not to think about what Steve had said about being clean shaven and what it meant. Steve’s eyes went to the cat and he smiled, while something twisted in Tony’s gut.
"Don't what?" Tony noticed he was still holding on to Steve's hand and he dropped it in embarrassment.
Steve shaded his eyes while craning his neck to look at the top gallery of the Colosseum. A little rough around the edges after 2000 years, of course, and not accessible to the public, but he doubted Hydra would abide by those rules. They'd discussed the day's program in the touring car, or school bus, as Tony insisted on calling it. He'd been very not pleased with the milling around while waiting for transport, said transport, the tour group, the tour group leader, the lack of regular caffeine stops and a whole lot more. Spoiled little rich boy. Steve had finally elbowed him and told him he was being an ass. Tony had actually looked embarrassed and mumbled something about regressing occasionally. That didn't seem like a welcome topic, so they'd tried to figure out what Hydra would do now that they were off the boat. They agreed a kidnapping was most likely, to force Corbin to work for them. "I'd say there's about a 70% percent chance they go for Corbin, 25% for us both and 5% that I am the target," Steve had said and Tony had agreed, give or take a few percent. So far they'd stuck to the tour group like glue and hadn't seen anything or anybody suspicious.
His mom was always exasperated by the burdens Steve took on out of what she called a misplaced sense of guilt, and he knows this, but yet again, Steve can't
“Captain Roger’s disappearance caused quite a stir. It was one of the first ambushes in the conflict with Iraq, with some the first casualties and he was the first soldier to go MIA. It was heavily speculated that he’d been taken by enemy forces. Which they denied, of course.” He looked at Steve who still hadn’t looked up, even though Huey (or Louie) was head butting his hand. “I’d love to hear your story of what really happened,” Rhodes said to him.
. It was the kind of insanity that you needed to pull out by the root, but he didn't know where to even get a grip on it.
“I am not sacrificing Steve to cover up my fuckups. It's not like people expect me not to fuck up, anyway. There are plenty of ways to deal with this without involving Steve.”
"We've stopped the bleeding. Maybe God will grant him a chance to heal so he can devote his youthful prowess to His service. I would not not deny him that chance, be it small or large," he tried.
Unable to decide between laughing derisively or cursing indignantly, Tony ended up with a indelicate splutter. Steve smiled at him, an actual smile this time, and turned to Sam. "I think you're safe letting him look at them. I heard he did good work on the helicarriers."
mean it that way? Tony was so out of his depth here. He now wished he hadn't dropped Steve's hand, so he could have squeezed it.
Yet, it felt kind of nice to have Steve's. Since they were friends now and all. The only friend Tony would have for the next millennium or so, so it would probably be prudent to try to not fuck it up, actually.
"You picked up on that, huh? Tony Stark: vigilante, loose cannon, and potential renegade. I wonder why they were so eager to paint me as more patriotic than you?"
"Probably a combination of salt water and hay mites. Possibly bedbugs. I can get rid of the salt water if you want."
"Is that it? Are you pissed I didn't let you finish your naughty little daydream? Did little Stevie still want to play? So sorry, Cap, but I didn't want you to ruin our chances of getting out of here. So I am afraid you had to hold on to your baby-batter. I do apologize for taking the long term view. I know strategic planning is more your forte, but you were too busy having dirty dreams.”
The square was not paved, for starters. He was standing on compacted earth. The stalls were not like any stalls Tony had ever seen in a market. If fact, most of them seem to just be carts rolled into place haphazardly. Carts that looked like they'd have to be pulled by horses or oxen. There were vegetables in the carts, and caged live chickens that were making a terrible ruckus, and he spotted a table with baked goods, and one with rounds of cheese. Strangely, there was no sign of any stalls with knock off designer crap, or taco trucks or ten dollar chair massages. No neon colored price tags. No cars. At
Tony turned his head toward her in surprise. She wasn’t meeting his eyes, so he turned it back to the canal.
"Of course not! You like Sinatra. I thought you'd like it. Why did you cry? If I wanted to make you cry I would have picked Celine Dion or something equally horrendous. Or maybe..."
Tony frowned for a moment. “He literally said... What is, and always will be, my greatest creation... is you. Those were the actual words. It's not like I didn't rewatch that about five hundred times. What is wrong with that? Even if it wasn't to my face, it's the nicest thing he ever said to me.”
“I owe my new life to Mr. Stark and Mr. Stark’s father. I would still be frozen if they had not kept looking for me. And Mr. Stark has been very generous toward me those first few months of my new life. I would hate to pay him back by gossiping about him.”
Tony and Steve had a brief argument in Florrie's rose garden about whether they should let Percival come with them or not. Tony actually didn't see the point of dragging the man along, now that they knew where they were going. It'd be tricky and tiring to have to keep up the pretense of being anything other than Medieval dudes for Percival's benefit, so why not ditch him? Steve flat out refused saying he had promised a guy named Bors to keep an eye on him. And he wanted an extra sword to guard Tony's back now that he didn't have the suit.
"Yes, really. Not that you want to, obviously." And Tony had absolutely no clue where the little pang of regret came from. He wasn't the marrying kind, also: dying, so the whole idea was ridiculous.
“Thank you, Hill. Excellent. Right on time. Come in, captain. Now I'll only have to go through the details once. Captain Rogers, this is Tony Stark, your partner in this endeavor. Stark, say hello to Steve Rogers.”
“I don't know.” She continued in a softer voice. “Maybe if I practice. Nobody ever asked me to. Everyone who knows has made me swear to keep it a secret and to never do it again.” She looked up at Tony, the defiance back in her face. “I am not so good at keeping promises.”
“Sorry. That's not our problem. Have a good evening.” Tony kept his voice deadly polite. He tugged Steve along.
Letting his body go soft and pliant, he stepped into the rough embrace, sliding his hand softly up Steve's neck and tilting his head for better access. He teased Steve's lips open with his own as he pressed closer, using his whole body to silently chant 'I want you, I want you, I want you. Feel how much I fucking want you'. It wasn't how Steve had expected him to react, he could tell that much from the way the kiss kind of stuttered and turned uncertain for a second. Then anger and desperation melted out of Steve and Tony seized the opportunity to press even closer and wedge a knee between Steve's legs. Now his dick was pressed against Steve's thigh and he could feel Steve's against his hip. He almost made his own knees buckle, it felt so good. Steve groaned and slid his hands down to Tony's ass and Tony did a little victory dance in his head for a second, but then all coherent thought got lost in a frenzy of groping, rubbing and trying to devour each other.
The next moment there was a ghostly green simulacrum of his armor flying through the room. Tony was taken aback. She'd never been able to move a shape before. As it was, he sometimes had his doubts about the wisdom of encouraging her to get better at magic. With her seething anger that never seemed to abate, it seemed inevitable she'd eventually use her new found powers to go teach her husband and her brother a lesson and it would be epic in its ugliness. But he really wasn't a fan of people having to squash their own potential in order to please others, especially not abusive fucktards like Urien, so as far as he was concerned the man had it coming.
“Right,” said Pepper decisively. “Time to go back to work. Sam, why don't you come with me, R&D wants to pick your brain about the redesign of the Falcon wings.”
He instantly regretted his words as the door swung open. The inside of the church was colder than the grave, which was appropriate, he supposed, and it reeked of dead people. Again. Appropriate. The sense of menace in the air also increased a thousand fold. He swiftly turned his involuntary step back into a sweeping bow, while holding the door open for Steve and Percival. Steve had had his mouth open to argue, but he closed it abruptly when faced with the open door. A grim look settled on his face and he nodded to Percival as he strode inside. Percival looked pale in the dying light and his stride was decidedly less purposeful, but he followed all the same. Tony slid inside last.
The bike rumbled seductively under his ass and the feel of Tony between his thighs, in his arms was perfection. He could hold on as tight as he wanted and it’d be alright.
Steve didn’t know why he had expected Tony’s workshop to be in the dungeon, probably because it would have been closer to the gates of hell, but it was just as well, at least the astronomy tower was close. He pivoted on his heel and started running down the hallway, checking that his wand was in the arm holster, where it belonged. Thank fuck it was. He didn’t know how bad things were, but for Tony to ask for
Tony realized at that moment that they should have known this guy was an impostor all along. All of the actual Grail hermits had called them by name. And all of them had had nasty things to say about Tony, while this one had ignored him when they first met.
"Iron Man! Let them go! Fall back!" It was Steve's Captain America voice in his com unit, all clipped consonants and determination, but the beasts were almost under water and Tony still needed to get closer to...
He also had forbidden himself to touch Tony. He didn't trust himself with that at all. Touching would turn into caressing, he wouldn't be able to help it. It was awful, because Tony was looking more tired and haggard by the day and Steve ached to touch him. To check on him and support him and to keep him warm at night, and he just couldn't risk it. So he watched Tony struggle from a distance. It was his fault that Tony was stuck here and if the man died here, Steve wasn't sure he'd dare to go back to rest of the Avengers, even if he could. He had taken Tony off the watch roster, now that Bors had joined them and he made sure that he ate. At night, when Tony slept, he'd cover him with his own blanket, because the man seemed perpetually cold, but he didn't dare share body heat. Especially not that. Tony would be better off if Steve kept his distance. But, dammit, he missed him.
"Spent months making the perfect suit for Cap and got you to steal the shield for him!" Bruce sounded delighted.
Today's mission had been decent. He'd rescued a few men who'd gotten themselves kidnapped and that had felt like an honest day's work and it had tired him somewhat. Win-win they called that nowadays.
Despite Tony's protests that he wasn't hungry, Steve forced him to come to breakfast with him. They found a pot of hot barley gruel in the kitchen that someone had prepared and Steve dished out two bowls and handed Tony one. Tony made a face and snagged the jar of honey on his way to the table. The only way to make this palatable was to create a gruel to honey ration of approximately 4:3, he knew from experiential evidence. Yesterday's talk of cinnamon buns might skew today's ratio more towards 1:1, though. He'd taste test at 8:7 and decide from there.
is what bugs me!" He glared at Rhodey as if he'd personally decided to rename War Machine and it hadn't been a decision by a committee of generals. Rhodey grinned back.
Steve turned beet red of course and elbowed him in the side, but Tony smiled smugly, because he knew exactly what Steve would be wearing to bed later.
"I understand, I understand. Um, before you go though...." he dropped his voice to a whisper, "could you maybe... Yamilla, she will be angry if I deliver nothing. She will hurt me." Tony wondered if he got off on that too. Suddenly he felt kind of sorry for the guy. Must be a bitch to have to jump through so many hoops to get it up. Abdel was still talking. "Would you let her watch you kiss? Right here? It will appease her somewhat and we will not bother you again, I promise." Oh sure, like Steve was going to play along with that? For fuck's sake, they needed to get the hell out of here.
"What the... Who? Clint?" Widow sounded as taken aback as Tony had ever heard her. Which wasn't very.
"Actually," said Clint, "You and my grandmother have remarkably similar personalities, now that I think about it. She's probably done a paint-by-numbers self portrait too."
"I don't care what you do. As long as it involves you naked and my dick, I'm good." He paused, obviously trying to gather his wits. "Bed. We should move to the bed." That Steve could do. He carried Tony across the cabin, ignoring the man beating him on the shoulder demanding to be set down, and tossed him on the bed. He started pulling his clothes off but Tony stopped him.
“We’re not even going to talk about that, so just don’t. I gotta get back to my shift at De Wijnhaven. Thank you for your help, Steve. ” Steve nodded and started walking, already reaching into the bag. Tony watched him go, knowing he had no choice but to let him.
“God, the sounds you make, Steve. I could listen to them all day. I could fuck them out of you all day. Goats be screwed, school be screwed, just you and me and a Costco-sized box of condoms. Whaddayasay?”
losing Tony was crushed. The opportunities of one more day, one more kiss were wasted. He took a step towards Tony, but Tony lifted the repulsor and aimed it at his chest. Yeah, he'd overheard, alright.
They disentangled as quickly as they could without looking totally ridiculous and Steve stood up and put his robe back on. But not before Tony had glimpsed the undeniable swelling in his swim trunks, which made him almost crow in triumph while still cursing himself for letting himself get so distracted. He shoved his stuff in Corbin's man-purse and pulled Steve with him.
Tristan merely shrugged, but Steve knew the man would let himself be led by Dinadan, as usual, so he fixed his eye on the short guy with the curly hair who was still beaming at him.
"You were hating on it. Go find yourself another book, there's a book case in the family room." Steve points him in the right direction and goes back to his crappy but entertaining book.
Morgaine looked at him in surprise. It was the first time her face showed anything but sullen anger.
"Are you saying Captain America is not the pinnacle of patriotism? You wound me, Tony." Steve was trying to pout while he pulled his cowl off, but his mouth kept pulling up in the corners and his hair ended up sticking up all over the place. It was adorable.
"Not even to save her life? And all of ours? We'd all be dead if I hadn't managed to scare them off with the fire demon. And if that big ox hadn't shown up to prevent you from being hacked to pieces and trampled in the mud, you'd be dead twice over." She pointed over Tony's shoulder to Steve. Tony whipped around. A giant grin broke out on his face when he spotted Steve and Steve helplessly smiled back.
"Wow. I can't even imagine. That must get annoying." Of course, Tony immediately wondered if Steve had ever heard him jerk off in the shower. He sure as fuck hoped he'd never actually moaned Steve's name aloud when he did, he couldn't quite remember now if he had. Maybe he should check with JARVIS, just so he knew how much embarrassment he was entitled to.
“What do you do, Steve?” Tony's voice breaks into his contemplation and Steve's head jerks up. He searches for words.
"I'll have to strap them to my calves, too bulky for my pockets, but they should fit under the pants legs. Can you dig those sex toys out of the closet? I think Del has a leather harness we can re-purpose."
She looked exhausted, once the tears dried up so Tony showed her one of the rooms with a bare bed and told her he'd see her in the morning. Fortunately it was still summer and blankets weren't so essential just now.
“I did. I had. Until S.H.I.E.L.D. cacked. And nobody seemed to have a fucking clue what would happen if we happened to have another alien invasion. Remember that nuke I flew through that portal last year, because WSC thought the most elegant solution would be to just nuke Manhattan to stop Loki? I saw the fucking mothership, Cap, and it made the stuff they sent down here look like blow darts. And now S.H.I.E.L.D is gone. Fury's gone. Coulson is gone. You and Natasha disappeared. Thor is canoodling with his girlfriend. Or his brother, who the fuck knows? And I haven't seen Barton since we had Shawarma. In the meantime, I still had nightmares about those fucking Chitauri and I realized I'd sleep marginally better if stopped sitting on my ass drinking fruity cocktails at the beach with my girlfriend and made sure I could give the Hulk some back up if the fuckers came back. So I unretired.”
Steve apparently did not feel he was wasting his talents on Tony, so that is how they ended up pretty much joined at the hip for the next few weeks. To the point that Tony's left shoulder was feeling almost bereft when Steve was more than a couple of inches away from it. It was fucking annoying, is what it was.
Steve can't think. His mind has gone completely blank, his blood is roaring in his ears. He can only look at Tony for a moment. And then his mouth floods with saliva and three hundred thoughts crash in simultaneously. It's bound to be bullshit. It's a lie that it doesn't have to be complicated, everything is complicated, especially Steve, but, oh dear god, he wants this to be true. How much he wants it scares him. And letting Tony that close scares him. Tony is a pushy, prodding, walking disaster, who has no fucking clue what he is doing to Steve and wouldn't care even if he did. And Steve wants him to do it to him. He wants Tony to push through his boundaries, to annihilate his objections, to shatter his peace of mind. He does, yet he doesn't. But he wants Tony's hands on him again so bad that he knows he's fighting a losing battle with his rational mind.
Wary of the lingering adrenalin in his body, Steve foregoes coffee and makes a mug of decaf green tea instead. On an impulse, he takes it outside, wanting to feel the breeze on his face and the soil under his feet. It's not even 6 in the morning and even the goats are quiet as Steve takes in the soft morning light on the golden hills behind his backyard. He feels his shoulders sag as he breathes out slowly. He's only been there a couple of minutes when the sound of a hammer hitting steel rings out and shatters the peace. Searching for the source of the sound Steve finally notices that there is now not one, but two luridly orange plastic fences trailing over the hill. The new one disappears over a little bluff, and that is where the noise seemed to come from. Telling himself he's just going for a stroll; he sets the half empty tea mug on his dusty patio table and goes out the back gate. Gwenna moves to follow him, but he tells her to stay, even though he feels vaguely guilty about shutting the gate in her face.
Steve looked pained. "Okay. Fair enough. I take that back." He paused, then added, decidedly not looking at Tony: "I'm sorry about shutting you out. It was.... I was ashamed of how depraved my mind apparently is. I didn't want you to find out."
“What? No! That's the girl who wanted you to take her non-existent virginity. See, she keeps glaring at me, the little man-stealer.” He flicked the piercing again. This time Steve stayed put but he sucked in a sharp breath. Oh, those nipples were really sensitive. Tony felt himself grinning like a maniac and he had to hide it in the crook of Steve's neck. Which of course made it almost impossible not to open his mouth and drag it up Steve's neck, so he did. The fingers of his left hand were now rubbing the barbell continuously.
