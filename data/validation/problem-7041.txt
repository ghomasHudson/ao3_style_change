None of that is true, of course. Yet, Tony still has no answers. He sits in the hospital room in the Tower. His mind blank and his head throbbing as he watches Steve. They aren’t in love, not yet anyway. Tony admits he could easily fall for Steve. In fact, over the past three weeks he actively worked not to fall head over heels for him. There had been a time that Tony would have jumped in with both feet, but he’d ruined enough relationships to learn that it’s better to tread lightly and softly during the formative period.
He cleans up the first aid and then tidies the apartment. He really isn’t the domestic type considering he’s used to being taken care of – he has a whole staff to do the little things he’s doing now, like fold up the extra blanket, wash the few dishes, clean the hot plate. As he collects the first aid kit, it dawns on him that he should bring it back to the guy – Clint – across the hall. The opportunity glares at him – it’s blinding. He takes it.
“I get it, okay,” he had said and then promised this would be the last time. “I need to clear my head. When I get back, we’ll take another look at that evidence about the weapons deals. I want to know how far and how deep Stane got.”
Steve doesn’t resist, only rests on the edge of the bed, testing the movement of his wings. He studies them for the first time. During his imprisonment, his wings had been scorched, broken, mutilated. Now, the days have allowed his wings to begin their transcendence. Feathers, white with golden highlights, sprout. They are soft and the slightest touch sends lovely shivers up Steve’s spine. He would very much like Tony to touch his wings again. He tries to push away those thoughts, he shouldn’t have those thoughts. Not now when a Collapsing Event is upon them.
“Oh fat lotta good that did him. He’s fucking dead because of you,” Tony had hissed in a rasped whisper. He sat back then and shook his head. “What the hell are you doing here anyhow?”
“And it will remain that way because you are mine now. You have been sacrificed to my needs, my desires.” The Red Skull nears him and, with that motion, the darkness surrounding them creeps closer.
“He wants to know what that is,” Steve says. He doesn’t wait for Tony to answer, instead he converses with the terrorist for a significant amount of time, trading one barb after another until Raza is confounded and seething.
Tony swallowed down the growing empathy. He was not going to feel sorry for Capsicle. The man had everything going for him. A soul pack – the leader of a soul pack. The rarity! It was so rare and so hidden in society that most of the time soul packs weren’t open to the rest of the world. No one really knew a lot about them. The stuff on Wikipedia was probably a bunch of hogwash. Now, Rogers had to deal with adjusting to modern life as well as figuring out how to be the leader of a soul pack. How the hell did that work? Obviously, not so well, since he transferred his feelings and memories to Bruce.
“Your genome has changes in it,” Shuri said. “While I can’t be sure what it means since your genome already had changes due to the serum, I am certain that I see sequences similar to the Divini sequences.”
“Are you going to be okay if I go?” Natasha said but didn’t allow him to answer. She pressed her hand against his shoulder, gripping it and giving him some strength. “You don’t have to do any of this alone. You’ve come a long way figuring things out in the future. Look, you even have a cell phone
As they leave the prince’s quarters several people including Happy and Pepper fall into step with them. He also notices the famous Colonel Rhodes within the military members following them. Crossing the gantry into the station proper, Steve spots the Strike Team following them as well. He’s not happy about that, but he’ll make sure to avoid them.
“Yes, needs abuse.” Steve says and closes his eyes. He never truly felt ashamed of his nature with Tony. He’s not ashamed now. But something heavy weighs on him as he lays there, vulnerable, spread out.
“Take it easy. It’s been a rough ride.”  Tony goes to the counter where the medical supplies sit and brings over a cup of water. “Why don’t you drink this while I get you something to eat and that hot chocolate?”
That didn’t sound convincing at all. SHIELD seemed pretty balanced, but then again, Steve had only been awake a little over a week. What the hell did he know?  “What if I told you it didn’t matter? I’m going to go to work for SHIELD because I want to.”
Back home there are people still suffering. The Conclave may rule the Inner Regions and the Beyond Regions, but they only cared about the places that earned them their wealth. So many of the Beyond Regions have nothing to offer and therefore are left to eek out a living in the dirt. He swallows and prickles scrape his throat. Before he can put his thoughts together, though a knock interrupts him and JARVIS announces, “It is Mer Hogan to escort you to the prince’s quarters.”
Tony grins at Rhodey. “If they tell anyone, Rhodey promises he’ll shoot them. Won’t you, sweetcakes.”
“Gah,” Tony groans and bats at Steve as he wakes. “What? What are you doing?” He’s panting as if he can barely breathe.
As he feels the shape of the gland he begins slicing it away from the connective tissue. The spikes of pain bring tears to his eyes again and his vision blurs. He blinks a few times and tries not to notice how bloody his hands are, how his chest is smeared with his blood. He tries not to smell the metal of it in the air. He pants through his mouth; if he smells it he might gag.
Tears stream down his face as Steve nods. Tony keeps his head about him and holds Steve’s face in his hands.
The argument is sound. Steve isn’t one to believe in fairy tales. He grew up in the Great Depression. “I know that.” But what does he feel about reality verses the fairy tale? His stomach knots and the idea of eating curdles. His throat thickens; he swallows compulsively.
Tony pulled him close and held him as the after effects of his climax quaked through him. They sat on the floor, the abandoned couch behind them. Steve held Tony, his strong arms around him. He panted and trembled against Tony.
That’s all he can call it – a glory of food. Back in the Brooklyn Region anytime food was plentiful they always called it a glory. He mouths wow as the prince gestures for Steve to join him for breakfast. Before Steve can reply, Tony taps his implant and then puts his finger to his mouth to indicate quiet please. Steve nods and sits down a few chairs away from Tony to give him some bit of privacy.
It takes a while for her to answer. He’s halfway through rewiring the connection to the whole house generator when his phone pings.
In the next day, Clint announced that they would be traveling to his farm in the mid-west. He didn’t take questions so the team prepared to go. Tony showed up on Steve’s floor as he packed a duffle bag and shouldered his shield. It had only been yesterday that they’d found each other, and Tony longed to be closer to Steve, as close as he could manage. It felt as if a magnet drew him to Steve. He wondered if it was some kind of puppy love or if it was the soul bond strengthening.
Steve stops stirring the big pot of stew on the stovetop. He sets the wooden spoon on the trivet. He nods. He’s gone a little pale and gaunt. “Okay. I should. Just say it.” He flicks his gaze to Tony and then back to the side. “Can you sit, please?”
you.” God, was he making a mistake? Natasha told him not to push it. That he had to learn to accept what Bucky had become, but he couldn’t do that without acknowledging that part of Bucky would always be Hydra. “I know you.”
“The Great Purge,” Tony mutters. He recalls a bit about it from history class; it’s not like he really enjoyed the damned class. His focus was really in the area of technology and engineering. “That’s when the Alphas took over and the caste order finally was realized. We have a big celebration about it every year.” It’s like Independence Day from the Earth nations of old.
“You called me that the first time we made love,” Tony whispers and bends his body over Steve. “I’ll be okay. I promise. Hank, Bruce, Wong, Strange, and I – we went over all of the data. This is going to work.”
Ducking through the porthole, he winds his way through the narrow corridors. He used to dream of tinkering, playing with the innards of ships and engines. He used to dream of a lot, but his status as one of the last prime alphas and his Family name marked him and directed his life. He’s not one to complain. He actually likes being one of the Ruling Class – he doesn’t want to lose his position. Who would? Power, prestige – food to eat, clean water to drink (when he chooses to drink water), a place to lay his head without worrying about losing it. That’s security, and he likes it. He’s not a sap nor does he wear his heart on his sleeve.
The leader backhands him, the rings on his fingers slicing open Steve’s lip and cheek. He hisses and probes the cuts as he bends away from the man.
“That’s not why I’m with them.” She assesses Steve and her expression wars with her words. “You’re a stupid, stupid man.”
Pierce raised his arm and placed it against the glass. “Careful, Captain, or there may be questions about your loyalty.”
They’re almost done with the restore process when Tony finally gets his touch with his wayward CEO. He can’t blame her really, since she’s in the thick of getting everything ready for the gala that takes place in only days. He gets her to agree to come to the Tower for lunch. It’s right before he plans on implementing the restore for the implant. He requests Jarvis make something Pepper will find appealing, since right now, Tony’s had a hard time stomaching anything other than crackers or soup. It’s not the medication or even the fact he may be on the precipice of losing his sight forever, but it’s his constant questioning about Steve. His brain won’t let it go, he keeps cycling about it, worrying about it until it might just drive him insane.
“When I was held, abducted, I was wounded, seriously injured. Ended up with heart damage that should have killed me.” He shrugs. “It helps keep me alive. It can be hooked up to a battery, to shock my heart when it decides to die on me.”
A shocked moan cries out and Steve hurries to get them up the side of the ridge faster.  He propels and hand over hand brings them another few feet. They’ve crossed at least half the distance when a jolt to the rope bashes them against the face of the cliff. The breath goes out of Steve, but he clings to the rope.
They lie down on the grass, ignoring the wet dew. They end up there for hours, until they eventually turn around to watch the sun rise over the cabin below. The cool air doesn’t bother Steve at all, not with Tony so close. During the whole time, Tony keeps his hand on Steve’s. It feels right and comfortable. Steve hasn’t a clue what’s going to happen next, but he’s flying so high he can’t see the ground to land.
He swears he can hear a malicious laugh in the AI’s voice, but he didn’t program her with any type of emotion. But how does jealousy fit into that? He only shakes his head as he enters the lift. “Omega quarters.” It really isn’t the official omega quarters – that would be in the urgency room or the presentation suite. Even bonded though, this omega was proving to be a problem. Like Pep said, he’s an issue or how Tony likes to phrase it – a regular pain in his ass. It might be time for some disciplinary action.
Steve drops the bag to the side and settles on the bed. He touches Tony’s shoulder. “Tony? I’m right here. How are you feeling? I won’t leave again.”
Tony saw no point in making in easy for him – so he battled and struggled every step of the way. When they released the chains from the link to the floor, Tony launched himself at the closest agents. His vampire strength gave him the advantage but the fact the he was in his boxers with nothing else on, made him an easy target for their batons and for their spikes. The spikes were especially designed to torment vampires. Gloves with embedded small wooden spikes at the knuckles and the back of the hand were standard issue for V-Corps agents. Steve never wore them. Neither had Clint, that Tony saw.
“Sorry.” He sets the chair next to Tony’s recliner, hits the switch to have the chair automatically go into the reclining position. “Let me take care of the headache, okay?”
“Jesus!” Tony says and scrambles for the latches. His talented hands find each one, unlocking them. He yanks at the helmet and throws it to the side. His hands are on Steve’s face. “Are you having an asthma attack? Nod if you are.”
“Yes,” he said. Maybe a bit too harshly. After all Natasha had been the closest person he had to family for the past two years. His stomach sank – all that time Bucky had been alive, working as a Hydra agent. How? Why?
“Okay, let me try again. There are worlds, dimensions might be a better word, where there are the protectors and the protected. Humans are protected because they have the potential to be more – to be immortal to transcend to our Realm, through the Boundaries.” Steve moves and his wings shuffle. It hurts but he ignores the stretch of pain. “We protect you, guide you, guard you.”
“Probably not,” Rumlow said. “But I do go there next to help out. What do you want me to tell him? That you fought like a good little soldier? Or that we sliced you up and dried out your decaying organs in the sun, or that maybe you’re still alive – well as much as an undead vampire can be. You want to give him hope to survive. You have to give me something to work with here.”
His body arches into each caress. He finds pleasure in giving pleasure as well. Steve is a giving lover, but also one who enjoys his own pleasures and blissfully and completely falls into them with unabashed enthusiasm. Knowing that Steve’s never done anything like this before, Tony’s especially careful. He explains how he’ll prepare Steve, asking him questions, getting permissions. As Steve’s legs fall apart, he pants open and wanting for Tony. It would be a power rush for anyone else to have Captain America under their thrall, but Tony sees it as a humbling moment. That Steve trusts him so completely, that they’ve come to this end instead of any other end – it prejudices Tony against ever wanting to hurt him, ever wanting to be hurt by him. It’s a dangerous path he’s trekking, and he knows it.
Fury looked closed off as well like he’d spent the last weeks beaten and bruised. Overall, he seemed fine for a man that was supposed to be dead. “Looking good for a dead man,” Tony remarked and Clint only smirked.
“When we were in Germany,” Tony starts. They flew him from Afghanistan to Germany for treatment at a military health facility, and then straight away to the States. At the base in Germany, he talked with the General about Steve. “Ross didn’t give me much hope. He said there wasn’t anyone searching for me but your group.”
“Only if you really want me to,” Tony says and waits as Steve keeps his eyes to the floor. He closes the small distance between them – the gap feels like a chasm. But he fills it and touches Steve’s arm. “Do you want me to leave?”
Steve gives a little bob of his head and lets his feet move, drifting through the store. He knows that Wanda’s been in Luke’s back room multiple times. She often dresses like a dominatrix for some of her clients. She knows what’s pleasurable for her and for the people she services. As he wanders, Tony seizes his hand and they waltz around the room like two dancers without music – no form, no pattern to their motions.
Steve sat next to him and smiled as Tony met his gaze. With the fire of mathematics sizzling through him mind, Tony returned that smile, because he could figure out a way to ensure this worked, he resolved to do it. It shouldn’t be hard.
“Does that mean it works with us as well? I don’t want you to be disabled if the Red Skull decides to play with his food first,” Steve says and reaches out to grasp Tony’s hands. The calluses are still there from years of inventing, working tools, and changing the world. Steve runs his fingers over them, a map of trials and pain.
“You’ll be happy to know we’ve installed biometric scans in the building.” He pointed to the ceiling, indicating the equipment. “It detects the presence of any vampire.” He chuckled. “Also detects any of their excretions and secretions.”
Steve joins Tony, standing hip to hip. With the armor on they are nearly the same height. Tony wraps an arm over his shoulder as Steve slips his arm around Tony’s waist. The heat radiates off the plating and it helps Steve’s core. He’s grateful and says so to Tony.
Steve doesn't reply but goes to the door and waits as the thugs blast through the door. Tony doesn't remember blocking it, but then again this day has been strange; he assumes their female visitor had something to do with it. He hears a long scream in Farsi and then a round of gunfire hitting the locking mechanism on the door. Steve crouches near the door, as if in his wounded state he'll be able to do anything.
“Mind your own business, Brock,” Steve spat out. Six more agents approached, all with their weapons still raised. Steve turned around to face the car and so he could watch as they got Tony out of the vehicle.
“Yes. Yes! What did you think would happen when you told him? What did you think?” The anger runs through him, hot and twisting until it feels like it’s turning into pain and desperation – it overwhelms until tears burn his eyes.
“Everything is like that but different, it seems.” He pulled Tony toward him. “Now, how about you take it slow and easy and we make love?”
“Maybe,” Yinsen says in a matter-of-fact tone. He lifts his own bowl to the lion. “Today we have a truce. Tomorrow, who knows.”
The diagrams were rudimentary, but Tony knew enough about the double helix of DNA that he recognized the ladder of the bases. He also knew that the double helix wasn’t discovered until the early 50s, Erskine wouldn’t have known, unless he was way before his time in his thinking. “Maybe he designed it to be inside a person’s genes. Like integrate somehow. How would he do that?”
After a long romance through the ups and downs of Steve adjusting to modern life and to life as a human, they finally tied the knot for real. Steve continued to work for SHIELD for a while and headed up the Avengers when the Chitauri attacked. They maintained separate apartments but saw each other often. When SHIELD fell and they found out about the Winter Soldier and Bucky, it was the final straw. Steve left the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson and Tony left his armor to a newly Air Force retired Rhodey. Both Tony and Steve left the high profile life of the Avengers behind and settled in upstate New York, not far from the Avenger’s campus. Tony still worked R&D for Stark Industries and for the Avengers, but Steve stayed home and wrote and illustrated children’s books under the pseudonym; S.G.R. Stark. Everyone knew who he was, but they all pretended to keep the obvious secret quiet.
“Okay, let’s take this step by step.” Tony went to the fridge and pulled out a carton of milk. “You were on a train with Clint. It got ambushed by witchy girl and her speedy brother from what we’re hearing over the news reports. Clint isn’t awake. Bruce said he’s stable right now, resting.  I did not answer the emergency call, but I did answer you. Because you’re the one who called me. And my newly made Iron Legion, robots driven by JARVIS to do my commands. Cool, right. Not as cool as the trick you pulled by calling me. In fact, you called everyone. I’m sure that Romanoff is on her way here too. Luckily, Bruce stayed put here at the Tower. Hulk almost made an appearance.”
“I used to run the servants’ entrances all the time as a kid. I grew up here.” They race down the back stairs. “To the left and then we’ll take the service elevator down to the underground parking.”
The words rang loud and clear. Mimicked. A mockery of the sacred, the recollections of a past not marred with this place – the place of desolation, the place of soullessness.
“There’s a second chance. I believe it. I believe Morgan will be happy and fine. Don’t tell me that’s not so, Rogers. I couldn’t deal with it if it isn’t.” Tony glares at him as if challenging him to deny him this belief.
Clint introduced the two new members. Both looked like deer in headlights. The young man with a shock of white hair kept his hands on his sister, one arm around her shoulders as if to protect her from the rest of the pack. They should be in the hands of the authorities. This girl was a menace. She attacked a train, and while no one died, people had been injured and property damaged. Shouldn’t she be held responsible?
But now as he sat in front of Bruce and asked him what had happened Steve began to comprehend that his mind, his secrets, might no longer be his – somehow Bruce saw it or felt it. Reaching over to Steve, Bruce laid what he must have thought would be a comforting hand on Steve’s arm but in actuality felt like razors cutting into his reserve, his safe place in his head.
She raises her hands. “Not your enemy here, Steve. Let’s try this again.” She offers her hand. “I’m Natasha, also the Black Widow. I own the brothel you signed up for with absolutely no training. So, I need to know what I’m working with here in order to make sure you’re successful and that I can get a good profit off of sponsoring your registration on the station.”
He tears the helmet off only to strain his wrist. “Shit.” A growl startles him and he finds Blu standing behind him with an admonishing look on his face.  “Don’t like my language you don’t have to listen.” Then he spots the rest of the armor at the lion’s feet. “Shit, you really do get what I’m saying.”
He looked between them, trying to read the inscrutable. Shaking his head, Steve said, “Okay, who is this person?”
All of the books, all of the histories were written by the victorious alphas. The Great Purge made sure of that – Steven didn’t exaggerate that truth. He didn’t lie at all, yet why is Tony so angry with him? why go this far? His resolve wavers.
The windows became startlingly clear. The light streaming in from the city and glinting off of the skyscrapers nearly blinded him. Steve rubbed at his eyes and said, “Wow, the Tower?”
"You'd be surprised," Tony said and tried to catch Steve as he walked naked, like a god, around the bed.
Anyhow, for Force of Nature - please know, right now, I have every intention of finishing this story. I love this story and how the two time periods will eventually weave together (especially what happens to Tony in the here and now and what that means for future Tony). So hold on to your boots, it's going to be a bumpy ride! (PS I will probably plan on posting 1 chapter every few weeks).
Tony leans forward, gripping the table. “We’re Avengers. We can’t be hindered by our biology. At any time, we might need to relieve our stress and our needs, so we have an agreement that permits such things.” He stares straight into Ross’ gaze. “It’s allowed. For him. For me.”
Tony chuckled a little and then slid over onto Steve’s chest as if they had done this a thousand times. Maybe they had – in dreams. “It’s not always about shared life experiences. If it was, I’d have no one. I mean, how many people do you know that grew up as wealthy and smart? Plus on top of that ended up abducted and nearly killed. It’s not about similar lives, Steve. It’s about shared souls.”
“Sometimes it’s more about getting away from the Mantra.” Steve slipped out from under the weights and sat up as Sam handed him a towel.
Tony lets out a mewling noise that trembles through his body as Steve takes him fully in his mouth again, swallowing him down, using his tongue to curl and glide. He knows how to build the want, the desire, the hope of fruition, before he backs away and then allows the air to cool the immediate need. The prince cries out a supplication and Steve laves at his balls, taking each carefully into his mouth, rubbing his tongue sweetly over the velvety sacs. Tony arches with want and his moans tremor in the quiet. Steve drags his tongue along the underside and then softly lets go of the sacs. His lips kiss and tease at Tony’s entrance until he hears a weeping sob.
Tony knew through the link it was the last thing that Bruce wanted to do; something primitive drove Bruce to be close to Steve, to help Steve. Even Tony felt the lure, the pull to gather around him. As Steve’s life hung in the balance, what would happen to the pack members? What would happen to him?
“Barely there,” Clint says. He’s fighting with the controls, hitting the console, switching toggles. It isn’t working. The ship is older than the junk on Jakku. “Hold on, big hit coming.”
Tony continues, “I can’t tell you how grateful I am to her. To Rhodey -.” Tony waves his friend up on stage. “Colonel James Rhodes everyone. Serving our country every day.”
“Son of a bitch,” Tony said. He’d known there was something here – an animal or something they would need to transfer to a safer facility. Hell, he’d already contacted some of the best zoologists in the world for assistance. He’d never expected to find a human being. His rage transformed then, into hot adrenalin and he could only think of one thing – get the man out of here and then burn the place down. “You!” He screamed at Rumlow. “Get the fuck down there and help. I want him out of that cage, that thing off of his face, and dressed in five minutes. Or else, I tell the Movement that you disobeyed.”
“You’re joking, right?” Sam shook his head. “Steve, you’re pack is falling apart. I’m new to this stuff and you can’t tell me that you of all people see what’s going on as a good strategy? ”
“You know, he’s been hanging around with you too much Barnes,” Fury says. “Bay thirty-two. You’re going to be late.”
Tony shakes his head. He looks delirious with need. “No, no. I want the edge. I want to feel it. Don’t, don’t let me until you? Okay? Okay? Don’t let me until you’re ready to.”
“You spy on her. That’s a violation of their privacy!” Steve doesn’t touch the lunch and Tony worries if he’s just easily blown the only good candidate he’s had for the PA position.
Steve blinks a few times; he needs to figure out where he is and what he’s doing here. The best way to do that would be to get oriented. This time when he moves the man lets him but pats his shoulder as if to inform him that he’s still very much injured. The welts on his back, the puncture wounds, are not injuries he sustain on this fragile Earth. They are the roots of his wings, the wings he should have earned by saving Bucky, the roots that had sprouted and flourished, as fledging wings, only to be torn from him when Bucky fell from grace.
“Probably right,” Steve agreed. He stood there, not knowing what to do with his hands and his legs jittered. “Well, I-. I finished.” He gestured to the bed like he presented a prized cow or something equally as ridiculous in the situation.
Tony frowns. He hadn’t remembered Steve carrying a basket with him when they left this morning. “This – a picnic. We have to have a picnic?” He wonders if this is what Steve considers being good Personal Assistant. To Tony an excellent assistant helps him figure out how to get his implant upgraded and not give himself a stroke while also simultaneously looking for someone Tony might be able to relieve a little tension, but then that idea quickly devolves into imagining Steve in that role. And no. He’s not allowed that according to Pepper’s most recent lecture.
Of course, Sam Wilson started his conversation the same way just about everyone did with Steve – about coming out of the ice and how it must have freaked Steve out. At that point, Steve said it was nice to meet Sam and turned to hurry away, but then Sam captured him – brought up the bed and how it didn’t feel right. Everything about that moment rang true to Steve. After nearly two years of Soul Mantra training, Steve could control his astral projection, soul from automatically bonding with just anyone he touched. It really never occurred just randomly, but he liked to get a heads up these days. As he touched Sam, a warmth spread, but it was quieted by Steve’s automatic control switch as he thought of it. It stopped any bonding, yet at the same time it told Steve that Sam would be more than a casual acquaintance. Someday he might be something more. What Steve wouldn’t know until he dropped his guard.
The larger man asks her to kneel, and she follows his command. Heimdall meets Steve’s gaze and says, “Come and join her.”
Is he having a breakdown? Is that what’s happening? Or a panic attack? Considering all of the stress and anxiety over the last few days, he wouldn’t be surprised. He can’t even jerk off. He wants to howl but only a muted screech comes out and the water splashes his face and he chokes on it. Coughing he curls down into himself and maybe it is the sound of the running shower or his own sobs that deafen him to the shower door opening.
He taps his implant and says, “Message to James Barnes. Bring up contacts.” The implant beeps softly in his ear to verify it has selected the correct person. It then beeps twice to start the recording. “Hey Buck. Good to hear from you. Sorry that things aren’t going as well out there. Wish I could help. But then I am helping in a way. Out on Prime Station I’ve been temporarily assigned to the Stark Fleet, doing some support work. It’s a great experience. I like the new position. Stark is a great advocate for the Beyond Regions too. So, hoping we’ll get some help for Peggy and Mike. When you get closer in, drop me a line, then we can talk in real time.” He ends the message and sends it. It’s not lying – exactly.
“It’s your only option. You want to find out what happened to your other Deputy, find your friendly slightly deranged – from what I hear – snake oil salesman, and get this miracle cure for your friend, you can do one of two things. Walk up to his front door and demand it – from what I understand that will require a large amount of bullets and blood, or you can get invited in,” Tony smiles. “Your choice.”
She yanks on the wires a little out of revenge he thinks at the same moment the heart monitor freaks out and Pepper stutters.
“Sure, there is. Listen to the waves.” Tony giggles. “I can see you doubt me. Come on. Get up and dance.”
“But he’s playing with your life. What happens if some of the other Conclaves start to balk at his insistence, at his plans. Who are they going to blame? Not the advisor, but the head of your faction. You know that, Tony.”
The explosion replays in his head and he moans out in terror and fear. The doctor person comes back and kneels next to the cot Tony lays on. His hands are gentle and light. He lifts Tony’s head up and brings a bowl up to his lips. “You must eat. You are weak. Please. Just a little broth.”
Steve frowned. Tony’s circumstances were different than his. “You invented Iron Man, used it to save yourself as I understand it. Captain America was a persona, a movie character before anything else. It’s easy to dissociate myself from it.”
“Come on or I’ll get Pietro to help me and that kid will skip steps to get down. Always wants to do everything too fast,” Tony says. He tugs again. “Come on.”
“Now I know this is a bunch of bullshit,” Tony said but Bruce hushed him and pulled out a chair, sitting down to listen.
“I can tell. You haven’t stopped eating in the last fifteen minutes. I’m thinking I might need to protect my arms or something,” Tony says with a little laugh at the end.
Steve laughed. “Oh, don’t get too impressed. He made up Natasha’s floor with a lot of Russian decorations.” He pulled out plates for the pizza. “I wonder what he did for Thor’s floor?”
“The computer has paired up what you’ve selected and the alphas’ preferences as well. These alphas as professionals-.”
The intensity of his gaze, of his expression drowns Tony in a flood of anguish. How could anyone love someone so deeply, so powerfully that it would imprint as if it molded his very soul? It couldn’t be that. Tony is a man of science. The bond isn’t two souls entwined. It is a simple biochemical reaction. “The bond is broken.” Those words are inadequate, but it is all that Tony has to offer.
In the kitchen Steve has the juices from the chicken cooking on the stovetop to make gravy. He’s made a salad and there’s rolls in the oven.
“True, but what if we supposition that the universe is a particle and other realities are other particles. Then entanglement works. Newton physics is the law for our daily lives but not for the space-time continuum and understanding it,” Tony says. He can see Richards shift around uncomfortably like he has ants crawling up his legs. “Entanglement talks about space and distance but it also must rely on time. So-.”
Steve arches up and cries out, his teeth clenched in distress. Jerking away, Tony bends down and coaxes Steve. “Can you hear me? Do you know I’m here?” He has to get Steve out of the dark so he can figure out what the hell is going on. The low lighting from the arc reactor isn’t enough to figure out the details of what he is seeing. He’s not even sure he can get Steve to move, or if the chains and whatever else this thing is over his back will permit him to escape the corner of his prison.
Without a second thought, Tony followed Strange’s unspoken command, his wordless explanation of that one chance in millions. He had the technology wrapped around him. He’d been meant to do this since the moment his own weapon exploded in his face all those years ago. Maybe it was pre-ordained even before that, when his father hired Stane. Stane was the one who eventually had Tony kidnapped and nearly killed. It set Tony on a journey to invent the Iron Man armor, to revise it, remodel it, reinvent it time and again. To finally working with nanotechnology and designing an armor that would always be with him, that could shape and reshape according to his needs at the moment. The armor would be the key, the armor with its nanites would steal away the stones and Tony would snap his fingers and change the universe.
Steve nods and catches himself. “Thank you, Tony. This is great. I do want to ask.” He stumbles over the next part, but he needs to figure out how he’s going to assist Tony in the technical aspects of his job. “How are the drawings going to help you.”
“Shit!” Tony gulps the air in little puffs. Jesus, if Steve knows about his addiction problem – maybe, just maybe he can’t stand Tony. Maybe he’s trying to figure out a way to leave him without hurting him. After all, it had been Steve showing up at the Tower penthouse apartment, bag on shoulder, asking Tony for a chance. All out of the blue. It wasn’t as if they had a history. Steve stood in front of him, the light from the penthouse windows shining over Tony’s shoulders and glinting across his face like the rays on a Greek god. He looked road ragged: exhausted, hungry, and excited as if he’d only just come out of the ice and figured out what the new world around him might offer. It’d been a revelation, those first few days. Tony had been tentative, maybe his pained heart just couldn’t stand the idea of rejection again, but maybe it was the recovery. It always took him some time to come out of his alcoholic haze, to realize that people loved him, or even wanted to be around him. Maybe it scared Steve and he was just looking for a way out now – thus the awkwardness in their dating life.
Between the seconds that Lgoan speaks and the breath Steve takes, he lives an entire life. He recalls the other life, the one where he left Logan because he couldn’t sit on the sidelines. He had to go back to New York, to the world, and do his duty again. He remembers the terror of the invasion, how they thought they could hold it back, but not even the full strength of the world’s armed forces could stop the Ornari. He recalls the harried exodus as they escaped the city, as they rounded up as many civilians as possible to get away from the growing terror. Most of all, he remembers Tony. He doesn’t want to lose this; he never wants to lose the memories. It’s a life he may never live, but it’s one he doesn’t want to surrender.
“I went with him, pretending to be a prisoner as well,” Nat said with a shrug of her shoulder. “He didn’t ask a lot of questions. We got Bucky out and Clint. Bucky had been with them for so many more years, and Clint – well, he’s another story. You should look at the drive.” She placed it on the table between them and he just stared at it like it was some kind of key to the heavens or the hell. He was making a choice, deciding on his fate and the fate of others.
She’s right, of course. The idea of pledging to respect Steve’s promise is ludicrous. The man deserves some happiness, if not with Tony then with someone else. Yet, if Steve hadn’t been so distraught, so focused on his promise because he’s a man of his word, would Tony still want him, still secretly love him? “What if he’s just disgusted with me because of my father?”
As the car hits the daylight, he peers around the corner and starts forward to enter the short area of driveway before the street.
“I’m okay with that,” Tony says and shifts around in his seat. He’s never felt this nervous, like a schoolboy. “If it means I get to be alone with you, I’m fine with it.”
“Hell of a ride, Cap. Thought I was going to vomit in the suit. Not ready for prime time that’s for sure. The little nanobot fuckers want to do whatever they want, not working in synchronicity. Makes for a chaotic flight.” He reaches out and Steve catches his arm and reads the signal to pull him into a sitting position. Once upright, Tony turns to the side and spits a few times.
“And not when the weight of so many souls you’ve confined here for so long possess the power to move on and leave this place. Even you with your pathetic plots and plans cannot stop the possibilities of life and love.” Steve sees the flicker of light beyond the Red Skull. A singularity of light, calling to the souls. “It’s your one chance to do what’s right, Schmidt, and let us move on. Let us pass through.”
The tapping wakes him and Steve – no, the Silver Knight – peels his eyes open. His body itches for motion and he climbs to a sitting position. The ache in his throat is nearly gone. Tony – no, the Red Knight – stands to the side, leaning against the frame of the cottage. His arms are crossed, and he concentrates on him – as if something about his person might inform the demon’s plans.
As they lay together – recovering – Tony understood they followed a new path now. He’d left being human behind, as he had with being vampire as well. The world, the universe, lay at their feet, and Tony discovered he wished not for it to kowtow to him, but to see him as he really was – as a person – an equal. Part of him still hungered for revenge and every day he had to quell that part, a part in misery because of the agony he endured. He witnessed the same in Steve. A good man, but a man still tortured by his past. Together they battled to remain free of becoming jaded, and instead they strived to free themselves of the bonds of hatred to lead the way to a better place, a better world. For now, they became stronger in who they were, more powerful in their gifts.
Opening his eyes, he pants as he fists his hands into the sheets of the bed. As a fledgling he doesn’t know as much as the others, he was new to the whole Legion, to Shield. Earning his wings would have allowed him to be privy to more of the information, the doings and goings on of the Legion. But he’d been put in purgatory for his sins and he’s only just won his wings, only to be abandoned to the mortal world.
“I see you’ve been keeping busy,” Fury said. His arms crossed over his chest. He wore a thick hand knit dark maroon sweater and jeans. Part of Tony rebelled at the sight of seeing Fury in civilian type clothes and not looking like a part of the underworld.
“Sure, no problem,” Bruce said, though he stayed a good few meters away as if he feared too intimate a touch might set off the other guy.
He gets the audience to quiet again. “I’ve had the fortune to have the best medical care over the years. I think others should have the same opportunity.” He turns his attention to the paparazzi and Steve can see the Christine Everhart is front and center. “I’ve had the opportunity to stay behind the shadows, but I’m not going to anymore.”
“Depending whether or not we hit any complications, probably about 3 hours. I’ll have a nurse come out during the procedure to keep you informed.”  She touches his wrist softly and says, “He’ll be all right, Mister Stark. He has you.”
“Maybe. I’m reading some geological anomalies. That could be Ultron playing with us or the simulation of caves or underground areas.” Tony marches forward a few steps before stopping. “Maybe you should hold onto me.”
“That’s not good,” Wong said. Strange gave him a scowl and he backtracked. “Well, it’s not great. It could be good.”
“Most people don’t talk about omegas like that – like they’re people,” Tony said. Hell, even Pep once in a while fell back on the idea that omegas, due to their different biology, couldn’t truly be considered human.
She snatched her hand away, momentarily startled but then composed herself. “Sorry, I should have known.”
A rumble from Tony’s chest turned Steve toward him just as the dream room from the 1940s disintegrated around him. It fell away, melting into oblivion as Steve opened his head to the mantra on his lips. “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.”
“Many things. What it mainly means is that Tony is immortal in many more ways now. He won’t need to feed off you. He’s stronger, has new abilities. For him the connection between you will be different as well. It will be something ethereal, more supernatural.  Divini are not a threat. We cannot walk in the sunlight like vampires, but a wooden stake is not poison to us. We feed off the cosmic light of the stars.”
The cold seeps into his bones as they move through the dark forest. The moons of the Gavin 6 are only chunks of rocks without much distinction or shape. It’s the large hive in the night sky that reflects the twin stars’ light towards the planet. It hulks in the sky like a mass of skulls built on top of one another. There’s something ugly and nightmarish about it. It isn’t finished; the scaffolds brace around it. He doesn’t like to think about it; he’s heard the stories of the Death Stars from the Empire. If the Red Skull is constructing another one then they are surely doomed. Their little conclave of scholars and artists with a smattering of Sentinel Guards will never be able to take out the Sith Lord and his plans for galactic dominance.
Finally, Tony and Steve found their way back to their hotel again. They made love that day. Maybe in celebration or maybe in a last ditch effort to feel everything before the collapse of their hopes. Now as Divini their lovemaking transformed. Form and energy collided into an explosion of body heat, thrusting and merging, and finally a heavy need to be – to be together and never parted. The energy between them that made them both life and death fused into a brilliant conflagration. Beyond their bodies, the touch of flesh against flesh, the hungry kisses and licks, the exploration of fingers and the final penetration, their energies flared together, merging and suffusing to become one with each other. Tony became part of Steve as Steve welcomed him and they cried out their joy together. Every molecule flared and flamed: they rode through it, alive and bright in their aspect. Together.
Tony didn’t say it. Instead he settled against Steve and they luxuriated in long lasting kisses as Steve grew hard against Tony’s leg, and the want and desire to taste him, and be part of him, manifested in Tony. Steve thrust against his leg. Tony disengaged from their kiss as his fangs grew and he felt the need to taste and bite overcome him. Steve arched his neck, exposing his pulse point where Tony had last bitten him, the wound still prominent. He shouldn’t indulge but the look of pure bliss in Steve’s face, the way his body coiled to Tony’s needs, sent him over the edge of doubt, falling into the chasm of surrender.
“Pain. The glasses. I need to-.” He tries to open his eyes, but the flashes of light are blinding. It’s a feedback from the implant for sure. Tears stream down his face and he blinks repeatedly.
“I’d like to think taking myself out of the equation helped,” Steve says. Sure, he went back to see Peggy, to dance with her. Sure, he told her how to find her Steve in her timeline. Sure, he put all the stone away and then traveled further back in time to live out his life on the same damned planet Thanos had chosen – the Garden. He lived there until it was time to go back and hand off the shield. “It was a quiet life.”
He glances over at the lion who is still awake, still watching him. “Help the helpless. You know, you don’t look too helpless, but you are. You let them hurt you and beat you, for what?” Tony closes his eyes and thinks of the abuse he accepted from his father for unfathomable reasons. “I know how it is.” He doesn’t open his eyes as he speaks. “I know how it is to just accept things, accept that you’re worthless and that you have to work to get their approval. I get it, Blu. I understand.”
Both of them pull away at the same time. Panting against each other, Steve holds Tony fiercely. “I don’t want to know. Please, God, don’t tell me.”
“Don’t you think you should at least clean up. You look like something from the Purge.” She follows him as she speaks and sometimes he thinks she must have a virtual whip hidden somewhere on her person because he can practically feel the electricity hit the air. He’s used them in his time – as a prime, dominant Alpha – but never for anything but pleasure. It will be nice to have an omega submissive to him. It will be nice to have an omega hungry for the lash. He’s always gone to the drone class of omegas when he needed one during his urgencies. But now, now it would be delightful to have one at his beck and call.
He sends a message to Bucky, informing him that he has an assignment he can’t get out of, that running the Rails is out of the picture for him. Having to deal with Tony Stark is going to be a lesson in patience and restraint. He tucks the pad back into his chest pocket and straightens his jacket.
After Steve had joined Tony in bed, they faced one another and talked – talked through to the early morning hours even though they both knew better and should have been asleep, preparing for the day. They talked about Tony’s love of racing, his glory days as a racer, and his not so glory days when he found himself drop dead drunk in the middle of a motel on the east end of The Cat’s Run while the building burned around him.
Clint had side eyed him then as if to ask - what the hell? But Tony knew better to push it. Natasha too. They all learned to let the moment wash away like sandcastles in the tide. Because they understood, though they could never really comprehend that Steve was a man out of time and place. It wasn’t just time but place as well. The space-time continuum played a joke on Steve and he carries the mark of it, the tattoo of pain where ever he goes. There are times when something, some gesture, some event, some fragrance, some slight circumstance throws him to an old memory and it overwhelms him once again.
“Was your alpha, Dany, was he kind to you?” Tony asks as he takes up the soap and starts to clean Steven.
Over the winds, Tony yells, “Do you think Ultron might be using what he knows about each one of us to build these defenses? Maybe this is rim is representative of you?”
With a deep-seated gaze, Tony judged Steve’s offer and then with only the slightest tilt of his head accepted. He slid in next to Steve and then Steve pulled him into his embrace. They lay there like that for several minutes before Steve whispered, “It’s only a dream. I can do this in a dream.”
“Shit, Steve,” Tony said and brought Steve’s knuckles to his lips. He kissed his love’s fingers. “You earned it. God, you went through so much.”
Tony toppled onto Steve, his head pillowed at his waist. “Oh, lord, that was phenomenal. Where’d you learn to do that trick with your throat?”
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony says and stands next to the foot of the bed. “That was a low blow.” He shakes his head. “But Steve, you gotta realize, this looks bad. It is bad.”
“Get comms,” Steve ordered. “And let’s go.” He would have the team spread out. He would wait for Tony to arrive and try and talk to him. They’d left things on a good note, so he had to assume that Tony would be willing to talk.
“The store?” Clint starts playing with the coffee machine and it whines in protest. Tony truly and honestly cannot believe how many of the Avengers cannot operate simple machinery but can somehow fly complicated jets, figure out complex weapons, and shut down enemy (and alien) ships.
Nat walked around the corner and smiled at him. Her eyes were tired, but something else glowed about her that Steve couldn’t pin down. Then he recalled that fuzziness about her spectral cloud that Tony had once showed him. Through the astral energies they shared, something had clicked into place – she became defined, whole. “What?”
Without a word, Steven is finally on his knees with his neck arched allowing Tony access to his bonding gland. It is well known that the secretions of the gland truly are an elixir. The immunological studies attest to the fact. Steven’s bonding gland is particularly sweet to Tony’s tongue. He leans in, grasps Steven’s shoulders and drinks from the gland. He feels a slight tremor run through the omega. In the recent century drinking the elixir frequently came into practice and, before Tony drank Steven’s, he had thought it a nasty tradition. But the truth is, he’s never felt as vital or strong. It’s addictive to be sure.
Over the course of the next few hours, Tony enlists Steve in dismantling several of the shells, helping to smelt what he calls the core, and constructing a small metal casing.
“Oh you mean the insufferable ass that was arrogant and a playboy and didn’t give a crap about anyone?”
“Trying to help Clint,” Steve said as he climbed to his feet. He wavered for a moment, but both Bruce and Tony were there to support him. “I suppose I called out again?”
“I am currently working on all clearances. I am confident the transport should be there no later than 11 am tomorrow morning.”
Steve shivers and pulls Tony to him, kissing his crown. “I’m so- I’m so sorry. I wanted it to be special. I didn’t want for it to be.” He stops and when Tony looks up, he sees the tears staining his cheeks.
Steve thought about it, turned it over in his head. “But you always rest and get your energy from twilight?”
“I didn’t expect him.” She coughed, and the color drained out of her face. “What I had to do to him, today.”
“Bridge is near the center of the ship, perched there. Think of the ship as series of concentric tubes. Each one large than the next. Except at the very nose of the ship – there we have a hexagon. Each side of the hexagon serves as the docking bays for the shuttles or fighter ships. Lots of ships place them more centrally or near the rear. But the fighter ships are really our infantry. They need to be out front. We also have big guns at the bow of the ship. They cover the infantry when they emerge from the ports. There are guns along the sides of the ship and the stern.” Tony ushers Steve toward the bow. His words come faster and his arms wave excitedly as he explains the design.
“Oh yeah, like the last time when you got knifed and ended up in bed for three weeks with a raging fever. I’ve been at your bedside enough when we were just young’uns to know that you need your rest.”
“Well, I wanted to let you know that I’m sorry it happened,” Steve said. True or not, the man’s voice rang with earnest emotion, and Tony suspected anything that came out of Captain America’s mouth felt like truth and justice.
“No, you are not,” Steve says through clenched teeth. “I didn’t just go through nearly being assaulted by that dickhead Rumlow for you to make a scene here and then let the word out that the prince hired a common whore to
“Well, no, not yet,” Natasha said. She thumbed behind her to indicate Bruce when Tony turned his attention to her. “Bruce discovered a glitch.”
“And spying, and assassination,” Furin interjects but it isn’t snappish in tone. It’s almost kind, like a proud father.
“No. I read people’s body language and heat signatures. Yours clearly indicate you are unsettled by Prince Anthony’s overpacked schedule.”
“Stop, doc, you’re making me blush,” Tony says. He turns serious. “But really, after the implant goes, what choices do I have?”
“That’s true,” Shuri said and folded her hands in front of her. The sunlight from the windows set the orange tunic she wore with its dazzling embroidery to a fiery glow. Steve looked at Tony, and at the others, and wondered about their safety. Shuri read him. “In Wakanda we do everything to ensure the safety of our vampire population. The windows are embedded with a nanotechnology that prevents the vampires from being weakened by the sun’s rays.”
Heimdall huffs at her, sticking the point of his sword in the ground. He lays his hands on the pummel. “I am not sure I should. I am not supposed to interfere.”
“Yes, I had some trouble right before you appeared in town and my horse threw a shoe among other things.”
“That can’t be it. The Secretary wouldn’t come just for one unit-.” Tony stopped and swallowed down his fear. Steve’s open objections to the V-Corps policies would get him killed one day. “They suspect something, don’t they?”
Consent must be a huge issue to Bucky. Steve waited, and Bucky kept his face hidden by staring down at the mark on his wrist. “Hey why don’t we sit?” Steve gestured to the bed.
The lion places him near the trunk of a tree and then sidles up next to him. Before Tony can clamber away, Blu plops a huge arm over him and tucks him by his side. Then slowly and meticulously starts to lick him – all over.
Tony smiles, graciously and welcoming. “Now, Steve, let’s get the show on the road.” Steve stands up and rubs his hands on his pants once. Tony waves to Pepper. “Please have Jarvis come in and measure Steve. We’ll need to get him a new wardrobe.”
But he needs to play the game in order to progress, especially if the end of the maze means the Passage to the next level. With nothing to collect since Tony had his backpack and he’s fairly certain he cannot conjure a new one, Steve sets about trying to solve the maze. The first thing is to scale the wall and just walk the top of the maze to get where he needs to go. Sure, it’s cheating, but controlling Ultron means outsmarting him.
Before he even gathers his thoughts, Steven enters the room and gives a short bow, “My lord, I’ve checked with Administrator Harry and he assures me that the estate’s security systems check out. I’ve done a sweep of the grounds using my modifications to Jo-Jo and things look good for your meeting today. We still need to review the Council meeting later this evening, but I am waiting to find out from the Elders what their protocol is.”
Now, as he lies on the bed and listens to his cluttered mind, all Tony can do is ask why did he waste his time? No one knows what’s happening to Steve. No one knows how grave it is. All they know is that he’s trapped in some middle state. Tony throws his arms above his head, what was he thinking? He always skirted being serious, not letting anything profound touch him. Profundity had weight, a gravity to it that enveloped and drowned. He hated the suffocating feeling of it, but the truth is his brain burns with the idea of losing Steve.
“It’s mine, too. And by the way, I wouldn’t mind it so much in real life,” Steve said – his own awareness of stating it out loud seemed distant. He’d finally said it, admitted it to himself at the same time.
“It must have been the serum. It probably sped up the process.” Natasha knelt down next to Steve and picked up his wrists. “I don’t know what kind of locks these are. The metal is probably adamantium. Reasonably sure even Captain America can’t break that.”
“It’ll function just like your regular shield. Or should. I didn’t have time to test out the math so there might be some weird maneuvers or functions of it. I thought to bring it along at the last moment so hopefully I remember to think of all the required math.” He claps his hands. “Try and take it off your wrist.”
“What did he say? What did you agree on?” Tony asks because the glare that Raza offers Steve isn’t just predator like – it’s reminiscent of a predator that enjoys the hunt, playing with its food. Something screams inside of Tony. “What did you agree on?”
“Yes. It is.” Tony’s smile is far away as if he’s lost in some dream, lost in some faded memory of how the scenery looks. But then he surprises Steve. “The ocean – just listen to it – listen to how it hits the rocks and the sands below the cliff.”
One thing that Steve learned in the Army was how to tie a good knot. He had some Navy friends who would often challenge him, and they taught him at the same time. He quickly connects the rope to the grappling hook and then slings the rope around himself and Tony using his usual shield harness as a starting point.
Fury pulled out a dossier from his long leather coat inside pocket and slipped it across the table. “When we found him, he was frozen. We didn’t know he was alive. Things were done, experiments by those in SHIELD looking to find the secret to the serum. No one bothered to figure it out until they started the experiments, he woke up. It wasn’t pretty.”
“I wouldn’t know,” Tony grumbles but he still holds onto Steve’s hand as they walk out along the pier. It’s a floating dock so he has to keep his hand in Steve’s.
“You know you interrupt a lot,” Tony says. “But yes, kind of the same concept. But it helps me compute a little faster. And here we are.” The nanobots form into a grappling hook. “Rope?”
“It is now,” Steve said and went to get to his feet. Tony stepped back as if being too close to Steve might forgive everything that had taken place between them. “It’s fine now.” Steve went to open Clint’s bindings. He eyed Bruce. “You need a minute?”
Well, I made it on time...and thanks to thegraytigress for the beta read. She had a lot on her plate this week and still managed to do it! So thank you!
Those words feel like spikes in Tony’s heart. Instead of grilling the omega, Tony turns on his heel and starts out with Steven in tow. They head toward the fore section of the ship. All the while his omega marches with him. The corridors are mostly empty except for the occasional crew member who bows as Tony walks by. When they get on the lift, Tony asks, “Did you love your former alpha?”
“You can talk to me,” Tony says and reaches out his hand. Steve steps up to clasps it. “I’m gonna miss you.”
“But you’re not this anymore,” Tony replied. Every word meant nothing, a silly defense in light of the truth. Steve would always be this person – this man with the scarecrow shoulders and the strong jaw. He would always be frail in some corner of his mind. Project Rebirth never changed the truth of the man – that was the main reason it worked on Steve but failed on Schmidt.
“It’s your shield! You love that like a baby!” Tony needs to clean out his ears, because he cannot fathom what he’s hearing.
“Please, Steve. Please. I need you. I want you-.” He stops and squeezes his eyes closed as Steve peers up at him.
Tony doesn’t watch Steve. He keeps his eyes steadily on a pinpoint on the wall over his shoulder. Steve follows suit and reverts his focus to his lap where his hands lay useless and limp. Tony wonders if he ever itches for things not around anymore. Like rotary telephones or wringer washers. Steve sits impassively, not saying anything. In the background, Tony feels the heat of Bruce and Logan waiting for the impossible to happen. He’s not exactly sure what he expects to happen.
Sam adjusted the table and picked up the phone. He put on some soft jazz and then said, “Sleep well, Steve.”
It’s mind boggling and dizzying to even consider. Maybe at one time as a graduate student, Tony and his pals played around with the idea of space-time but the truth of the matter is that they never really thought about it at length – there was no need to because time travel and different realities had been the stuff of science fiction. But now, an alternate Tony Stark invented some kind of nanotechnology that would trap all alternate Steve in the vortex of a singularity thereby throwing the entire reality through time and space and getting rid of the Ornari and the damage they’d done. They reset the clock while at the same time eliminating the threat. Somewhere along the lines they ended up entangling Steve and most probably Tony with their alternate selves.
Natasha looked comfortable, interested, but through their bond he perceived a distrust. Yet, the distrust didn’t seem directed at Wong or what he was saying. Instead, Natasha lived in a state of distrust, in pessimism, in isolation.  Some small part of him understood why his soul resonated with hers. Even though Steve found his faith in people, his life now consisted of isolation with a touch of distrust. In some profound way he thought his soul reached out for solace from hers and found some part of a kindred spirit.
Being able to wake with Tony wrapped around him thrilled Steve more than it should have. He kept hearing Wanda’s and Natasha’s voice in his head as he laid there. He needed to pull his head out of the clouds. For that moment, Steve luxuriated in the feeling of being safe and happy in the arms of a ‘lover’. He wrapped his arms around Tony’s as they lay front to back, his fingers threading into Tony’s hands. He felt the calluses that sent spikes of pleasure through him as the prince caressed him. He had explored the palms again, bring one up to his lips and then had kissed it. It was then he discovered something different, something he’d missed before.
“He shouldn’t have been, I told him I could handle it.” He rubs at his temple, this time knocking Tony’s hand away. “How are we – we can’t deal with this – not like this. There’s no way we can.”
“Hey, hey. You need to get up, yeah, but let’s eat first.” Tony places the tray on the opposite bed – the one he’d occupied when they went under into Ultron’s virtual world.
“What if I don’t believe in either?” Tony said and scratched at his beard. One good thing about being undead, he never had to shave anymore. It’s just a perfect beard – always.
“That’s a good question,” Tony says and places his hand at the small of Steve’s back as they enter the lift. “I had this idea – this crazy idea that I would get together a crew, a team of people who would be extraordinary and they would fight for the Conclave, for everyone.”
“What? Did I imply something about size? At all?” Steve laughs and it feels good to let loose and not think about the ache that’s settled into his chest under his sternum, the ache that’s become a beast rattling around and thrumming his heart every time he looks at the prince.
Staring into the flames as the smoke settled and the fire blazed, Steve said, “Well, he and Wong were guiding our pack. I needed to know as much as possible about them.” He liked to do his homework, know the lay of the land, understand the strengths and weaknesses of every situation.
“Let’s just walk,” he replied, showing Tony to the door that led out to the wide expanse of land around the compound. They stepped from the main building, to the sweeping ramp that led to the well-manicured lawn. He silently directed Tony toward the path that led to the duck pond. Why they called it that, Steve hadn’t figured out. There were never any ducks around it.
Was he well again? His brain took forever to get up to speed. His bones jelled, and he blinked away the bleariness. Steve looked amongst them and his mind sluggishly tried to encapsulate everything he’d just heard. All he could respond was – “I thought – I thought - the Dora Milaje.” He paused to compose himself, to get the words out. “I thought they were a fighting force, guards to protect the King of Wakanda?”
Steve hangs his hand and then puts his hands on his hips. He lifts his head and gaze, staring at Bucky. “You almost had me. You almost did, but you don’t know Tony quite as well as you think. He doesn’t despise me. He might be angrier than hell at me, but he doesn’t hate me.”
This probably isn’t the time or the place to play with emotions but he has this one card, this one truth.
“Perhaps you could call Ms. Potts or Colonel Rhodes. They’ve been of great comfort to you in the past.”
“To what fucking end?” Tony hissed. The anger raged through him and he boiled. He wanted to leap at the man and punch him until his face split open. His fury heated him and he thought it could light an entire city considering the energy racing through his nerves.
“Whatever’s happening – no. They pulled me out. They tried to pull you out. They can’t. Ultron’s hiding in your brain. You need to help the serum reject him.”
“Maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m just the soul or the astral projection of Tony. Do you think astral projections are confined by time and space? Maybe not, maybe I’m a Tony from the future.” Tony placed his hand on Steve’s bare chest. “Now, shh, I want to listen to your heart.”
“Well, he’s made it that way considering he’s trying to get you to declare yourself king or something.”
He doesn’t recognize the number. He considers ignoring it, but not a lot of people have his phone number so it’s probably someone important on an unrecognizable phone. He picks up. “Yeah?”
“You will get hungry. We are using calories. I’m most worried about you. It’s not like intravenous feeding will keep you alive and healthy.” Tony selects a packet of dried fruit and a chocolate bar. The wind picks at that moment to howls and shake the crashed jet.
. Their conscious beings merge with the intelligence that is Ultron. At first, it’s as blinding and brilliant as his encounter with Tony’s consciousness. Yet as he sinks deeper into the Hub, Steve discovers the brightness, the glittering beauty only hides a sanctum of depravity.
“I know something’s going on, Tony, and I hope you know what you’re doing. If he’s confused or sick, he needs medical help. If he’s Steve Rogers – that Steve Rogers – he’s going to need a lot of help as well.  While I think the former is more likely, I really hope it’s the latter, because seriously, I don’t want you hurt by someone who’s not predictable.”
He feels the blush in his cheeks as the heat rises to his face, but he cannot stop. There is something about the bond – Tony admitted it – he felt something, something strong enough to draw him back and save Steve. The bond only grows the more Tony touches Steve’s wings.
Steve acquiesces and everything goes black. Consciousness swarms around him as if he’s fighting to stay in a deep slumber. He relaxes further as a sensation of warmth and ease suffuses through him. He reaches through it as if he’s burrowing deeper into his blankets trying to find sleep that’s ever elusive. What he finds he might later call a miracle, or magical, or even altering. There amongst the darkness calling him down, down, down the rabbit hole is Tony. It’s like staring into the heart of the galaxy, a swirl of light and brilliant clouds. Tony isn’t a simple mortal being, not like Steve – Steve’s not this – not at all. Tony’s spirit uplifts and spreads out like wings on a soaring bird. When he encompasses Steve, the brightness of light and strength pervades through him so that he doesn’t know where he begins or ends. He transforms, transcends his meager mortal existence and he evolves. He becomes one with Tony. It’s more than a friendship, it’s more than a simple love story. It lays him bare, exposed, and brutal in the harsh unforgiving lands of pure unmasked vulnerability.
“I figure we can go across the hall. You know about them,” Steve says. “As long as we don’t disturb anyone we should be okay.”
Logan throws a few crude remarks his way but Steve only shakes his head and continues. He cannot believe how much his palms sweat.  It seems to take forever to ascend to the second floor of the saloon. Peering over the railing to the downstairs, Steve meets Natasha’s gaze and she winks at him, shooing him with her hands. Taking a deep breath, Steve turns to the doors to the rooms. He knows that the first room to the left is the largest, nicest room with a good view of the mountains and a large bed, a good lock on the door. It’s been a nice place to house some of the better visitors in town when the Parlor Inn is all booked up.
“You’re a maniac. That’s not a dirt bike, you know,” Tony says but he can’t keep up the pretense and he claps his hands and bends over laughing. “Shit. I could have fucking died. But fuck, that was crazy ass fun.”
“You’ll be happy to know,” Steve said as he delicately worked the material away from the seeping wound. “This is when the soul mark happened.” He didn’t look up at Tony as he worked. Instead, he wet a piece of gauze and dabbed it on the wound. “I might have lied a little when I told Fury.”
With a lap of his tongue Steve tasted Tony only to make him shiver and whine.  Steve couldn’t help but smile in response. So much of this felt natural and real to him. He suckled and then swallowed Tony’s cock, letting it hit the back of his mouth. Tony groaned in response, thrashing against the cheap thin pillows. Steve urged him on, slipping his hands under Tony’s ass and gripping it. He stroked a rhythm with his mouth and tongue as Tony moaned louder, wildly.
“He went to get some fresh air,” Natasha said and then snapped her fingers at him. “Hey, Leader, focus here.”
“This is Steve Rogers talking not Captain America,” Steve added. He needed Sam (of all people) to differentiate the two.
He gulps back his denial. One shared kiss does not make a relationship. “We had an agreement that he would go as my plus one.”
Tony smiles at her and there’s a silent communication between the two that scandalizes Steve and he only clears his throat and wonders if he should leave.
“You’re officially on the clock. That means that sir would like you to attend him during his afternoon gathering.” Jarvis glowers at him, just waiting for Steve to refuse or claim otherwise.
Steve came on the spot. Tony laughed and kissed the crown of his head. “How about we try position six. It’s one of my favorites. Only the best sub omega can do it. No non-sub does it.”
His attacker looked shocked; his mouth opening and closing like a fish caught out of water. His eyes were wide and luminous, sparkling with bright understanding but stained also with a confusion that consumed the light of comprehension at the same time. It was a strange juxtaposition of consciousness. Steve had his hand on his friend’s chest, holding the shard that’s wedged deep into his pectoral muscle.
“Yeah, so am I. But things are better now,” Natasha said and when he peered at her he saw her bobbing her head as if to convince herself.
Sagging, he nearly collapses off the bench, but Steve quickly recovers and, standing, wraps Tony in his arms.
“Or he wants you well enough to play the game, again.” Tony retrieves a gauze pad and blots at Steve’s gut again. There’s little blood on the stark white gauze. “Still tender?”
He steps further into the corridor, hoping to find some hint of where Tony headed. He throws a glance back at their storage closet and then moves into the shadows of the first arch. He hears a mechanical sound like gears engaging. It’s too loud to be Tony’s armor. The sound abruptly stops as quickly as it started. He realizes too late that it must have been a service elevator. Turning on his heel, he heads back to their hideout only to find that the corridor has changed. The storage closet has been replaced by a dead-end.
“You died for the first time trying to save the world. You did save the world. But you didn’t really die, Steve. You slept, frozen in ice.”
“There’s cereal or eggs,” Clint offers and then pulls down two mugs. They match, and Tony notices that the cupboard as a slew of matching dishes. Not like Steve’s apartment.
As he washed his eyes caught sight of the markings on his arm. His wrist had the original tattooed bracelet of his leadership of the soul pack. Up his arm he had Bruce’s circle and then along the side of it, almost touching Bruce’s was Natasha’s. The green and slight red of it reminded him of Christmas. It mocked him that way. Along the back of his arm nearer the wrist band was Peggy’s tattoo. He was glad it appeared there. He wanted some connection to her. He was glad she’d gotten on with her life, married, had children, was independent, and ended up founding SHIELD with Howard of all people. Her life had been good, and now he had her as a guide. He touched it. A slight sigh released from him.
Tony barks out laughter and kisses Steve joyously. He breaks the kiss and then without taking his eyes off Steve, the prince whispers, “Exquisite.” He places his hand on either side of Steve’s face. “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone quite like you, Steve Rogers. Where did you come from?” It’s not truly a question and Steve stays quiet and Tony thumbs his lower lip.
“Your bed is in front of you, only about a meter. Pietro was correct he laid out your clothes exactly as you like. The bed’s turned down. Would you like me to check the bathroom?”
Strange licked his lips and then cleared his throat. “Mister Wilson isn’t wrong. You’ve done something similar before, Doctor Banner. You just need to do it on a wider, more intricate scale.”
Tony bows his head and then after a second, looks up and smiles a quirky turn of the lips. “Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you to do that. This isn’t a performance for you.” He places his hand over Steve’s cupping it to his face.
“It’s not you,” Steve said. The worry welled up that they had been destroyed – completely and soundly –by men who hated everything except themselves.
Tony stood there, staring at the empty space where Steve had just occupied. Even the bond throbbed an ache like a hunger that wouldn’t go away. To think that just last night he’d dreamed of Steve. This morning, the seeds of hope had sprouted and now the dry and brittle truth killed every little bloom.
Steve nods. At this point with the coagulated blood on his face, his frozen hands, and his cracked rib, he’s easy to please. He stands next to Tony, letting the heat radiating off the plating warm him. Tony lifts both arms and aims at the Quin Jet. He blasts and then drills holes along the side. Once he’s finished, they slam it open and push the severed fuselage aside.
“Bigger than you, smaller than you?” She takes another sip of her tea. He’s starting to count how many times she drinks and he forces himself to stop.
“Don’t worry they won’t scratch.” Tony shakes the walking stick. “This is one of my first inventions. I used it a lot in school. It can be disguised as a walking stick or a small handheld rod that looks like a cell phone charger.” He gives Dummy a quick jerk and the stick folds up to the size of a charger. “It helped me navigate the campus. As did my friends.”
Clint is actually on the sex worker list, but he doesn’t do many clients anymore since he and Thor work as the guards. Thor’s brother Loki is one of the most sought after workers in the brothel. He accepts all genders. Some of the others like Darcy and Jessica come and go and he never really interacts with them. He knows he’s missing a few but he’s not surprised since sometimes their schedules conflict and not everyone shows up for Bruce’s ‘mandated’ meditation time.
Bucky sidles up to him and knocks him in the arm with an elbow. “Come on, you know you want to. Leave the negotiations for the damned politicians. Since when are you a politician anyway? You’re a ship’s captain, not a Commander.”
Before Steve can find his voice, the prince leaves the room. He stares after Tony and blinks as if the experience, the reality will wash away with a simple gesture. Nothing disappears and Steve mentally shakes himself back into his reality instead of that fantasy lurking in the back of his brain. It’s strange to sit in the prince’s private quarters without him. Steve quickly eats and drinks his coffee. After, he collects his clothes – he’s still not sure how his pants ended up under the sink in the bathroom. He stuffs the plug back into his robe and then takes one more look around the room to ensure he found everything. With that, he heads back to his quarters.
“Is that because of the new artwork on your neck?” Nat stood up and, before Tony could stop her, injected something into his neck.
“Sheriff,” Tony says and stands as well. He fits so comfortably up against Steve. It feels so natural and right. He closes in on Steve, their breath mingles. Looking up into Steve’s eyes, Tony searches for something.
Sam understands, they are all family. Both of them go to the medical bay and find Clint sitting on the edge of the bed speaking softly. He’s managed to use industrial clippers to snap away the front of the cage as well as the eye caps. Steve glances around but squints as his eyes water.
Steve wipes his eyes and blinks a few times before he answers, “I just- I can’t think of eating like that-.” He retches again but thankfully gets it under control quickly. “All those years.”
Steve nods into the kiss and then steps back, to rip away Tony’s clothes. He’s not sure where the strength comes from, but he savages zippers, tosses away fabric and ravages his own clothes until they are both naked. The shower is already running when they step into it, Steve assumes JARVIS warmed it for them.
The week isn’t easy. In fact, Steve likens it to battle. He barely gets through the first big test and that’s not even the meeting on Friday. It’s the assignment of his suite of rooms in the Tower. He has a suite – or rooms. The whole thing is bigger than his attic apartment. Way bigger. He’s overwhelmed at first and he stands at the door to the room in absolute silence. Jarvis talks to him about the lounge area, the small butler’s pantry and kitchenette as well as a bedroom with ensuite. Steve stays frozen at the door, gazing at the fireplace with its floor to ceiling stonework. He’s never had a fireplace in his entire life.
Instead, he nods and clamps his hand around Steve’s. “I get it, Steve, I do. But sometimes I just can’t be the savior or a martyr for the world. I just have to be me.”
Sam stops, his smile drops, and he lowers his gaze to the floor. It takes a moment for him to regroup. “Sorry, man. Just trying to make you feel better. Cho said you’ve been through a lot.”
“Slow and easy. Shh. Just breathe, okay. Here you go. Just breathe.” Somehow Tony gets the top of the suit unzipped and strokes Steve’s back. “There you go. Just easy. Do you have a daily inhaler?”
“Yeah, that’s what I was trying to tell you, the magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just-.”
What does that mean, exactly? He slumps down to the floor, the tangle of images like gnarled branches of a tree all about him. He feels absent, lost. He scratches at the place the arc reactor resided, but is now gone with the rest of him. Wincing, Tony closes his eyes and cups his face in his hands. What is there left of him. He can do this on his own. He doesn’t need anyone. He’s proven that time and again. He’s too old to ignore the fact he needs more than what’s on the surface. He needs the people that surrounded him.
Tony spotted the marks all up and down Steve’s arm. So many lives were linked to his, a man who woke up in a century where he had no one but was now responsible for so many people. He circled back to Steve’s question – give it all up and just retire. “I don’t know. Could you?”
“How many are true competitors and how many are agitators?” Steven asks as they descended the curved staircase.
“That’s very generous of you, and I’m not here to judge you. I just want to make sure that Tony is getting the best care,” Steve says. The weight of everything that’s happened crushes him. It feels like a mixture of an anxiety attack and his asthma attacks. His pushes his hand in his pocket for his inhaler and realizes it’s probably still back at the island.
Tony had crumpled beneath the onslaught. Fists collided with his face and he heard the crack of bone before he felt it. But that didn't stop the mad bear. He hauled Tony to his feet with a metal hand seizing his collar and banged him against the wall.  Bucky slammed Tony against the wall again and again. His head had throbbed with a headache for days afterward
He went to his knees as a half dozen agents went to the other side of the car to remove Tony from it. “Don’t hurt him!” Even that small bit of resistance cost him. His temples pounded with a headache and he swayed from the lack of oxygen. He swallowed repeatedly, trying to stop the need to vomit.
His heart throbbed in his ears. He thought he saw spots as if the whole world pixelated around him. The energy waves surged through the soul bonds and suddenly Bucky appeared around the corner and placed his metal hand on Natasha shoulder.
She nodded and gathered up her lunch. She tossed it in the garbage pail and then raced back to the building, never looking back at them. Obie had turned to Tony. “Marissa is failing out of the program. Don’t let her upset you. She can’t do the work.”
“Yeah, we hung out,” Tony agreed but remained mute on the rest of the details. He wasn’t one to kiss and tell. Well, actually he
Steve never hesitated. He brought Tony to him and kissed him hard and deep. It robbed the air from Tony’s lungs, exploded through his body, and heated his very blood. Tony scraped his fingernails down Steve’s perfect back. When they broke from the kiss, Steve sobbed out, “The fact I want you. I want you now. I want you in me. Please, Tony. Please.”
Mutual existence vanished during the human vampire wars of the late 60s and 70s, after which the V-Corps was founded. Coming out of the ice left Steve not only fighting the mental battle of culture shock in dealing with the future but also the emotional isolation of not being in step with a more and more radicalized world against vampires. He’d joined the V-Corps at Fury’s request. Fury was sympathetic to the vampire community’s cause and hated the fact that humans produced the Blight to wipe out vampires. It was only luck and good fortune that put the brakes on that policy. Steve joined the Corps in hopes of changing how things got done, changing the thoughts processes. Now, it seemed, that’d all come to naught.
“It is true, my friend. I would like to speak to you about the pack. But as your Guide. I am not here only to report out what has happened but to give you some sound advice.” He put down his fork after devouring half of the monster omelet already.
