“That’s what he said,” Sam confirms.
Steve finally turned to look at him. “I have a vague idea,” he responded, drily.
“Look, I don’t know what happened between you two, but you need to fix it.”
“I’d never lie to you,” Steve says.  His lips quirk into a small smile before adding: “You’d never buy it anyway.”
Tony meets Natasha’s eyes again, and the look she’s giving him is so raw and open—so unlike her usual self that it leaves him feeling a little unsettled.  “Of course,” he replies. “We’re a team, aren’t we?”
Tony had looked.
“What do you mean you ‘
“Fine, but only if you get some rest first,” Steve conceded. “You look like hell.”
Steve is about to suggest heading back to the tower at the same moment Tony decides to lace their fingers together before leaning forward and kissing him.
“Why can’t it?” Steve repeated.
Tony Stark
Amora gave the smallest hint of a nod. “You would have done the same.”
“Considering Hammer’s a billionaire, and the image of our nation’s icon is at stake, I’d say it’s pretty low,” the brunette countered.
The lack of music usually signals that Tony’s passed out at his desk, but that’s been happening less and less ever since Steve’s moved in.  If Tony really has been working this much again and neglecting his own health, then Steve was probably off on some last-minute mission.
“Okay.”  Steve abruptly gets up from his seat and gathers his things. “Well, this conversation has been lovely, but I’ve gotta go.”
“So you’re the flavor of the month, huh?”
“Well, they were very real,” Steve assured before kissing Tony’s temple.
“Steve Rogers, though?  Really?  How did that even
Sam can’t resist the open opportunity, so he snaps a quick picture on his phone and attaches it to a mass e-mail.
Most wouldn’t consider light pollution and constellations to be normal conversation topics between two strangers, but for some reason, it seemed… well, fitting.
His parents were never exactly the doting type.  They never told him they loved him.  They never touched him unless absolutely necessary, but even Tony knew that a pat on the back didn’t actually equate to affection.  They didn’t go to his recitals or science fairs, or parent-teacher conferences, so their deaths don’t really affect Tony as much as he believes they should.
JARVIS had informed Steve that the fastest route to Tony would be on foot as it appeared traffic wasn’t moving, so Steve parked and huffed the rest of the way with Peter in tow. The scene was worse than anything Steve could have imagined. Tony’s ostentatious car was at a complete stop in the middle of a busy street. There were cars at a standstill on all sides and an angry group of pedestrians screaming at his husband, who looked so small at that moment. One or two kind citizens were trying to help Tony and get him out of the street but it was like his feet were glued to the pavement. Steve didn’t waste any time rushing to the brunette and enveloping him in his arms, ignoring the vehement shouting surrounding them. All that mattered at that moment was that his husband and son -
Steve is clad only in a shirt and boxers, much the same as his own; God he smells delicious, is that a hint of cologne? The warmth from his body can be felt through to Tony’s bones, acting as a relaxant like he’s releasing pheromones.
While none of them were unharmed, Steve’s focus was on Tony who had been stabbed in the ensuing chaos. He had used the Iron Man suit to stop the bleeding, but now that the adrenaline was wearing off, Steve could see the pain and fatigue setting in. Steve had been alarmed and set out to rush him to medical, only to be shocked when Tony had brushed him off and hobbled off on his own. As they sat in the medical ward of the tower, Steve sensed the agitation rolling off of Tony as Dr. Cho tended to his wounds.
When Steve finally slips a second finger inside, Tony responds kindly, arching his backside. Steve takes his time scissoring his fingers apart like he's trying to know every inch of Tony by heart.
“Ugh,” Tony groans even though he feels the butterflies in his stomach, the same feeling that only Steve could ever provoke. “You’re a big ol’ sap, you know that? You’re just a big adorable lug.”
did something so mundane and
Tony had been in Japan for over two weeks working with Pepper to broker a deal for Stark-Fujikawa and Steve was losing his mind without him around. He hadn't realized how utterly enamored he was by Tony until he was forced to go without him and realized he didn't like his life without his little genius around. They talked on the phone whenever they could, but it seemed like luck wasn't on their side, as each time they connected Pepper came to reel Tony back into negotiations, Fury urgently needed to speak to Steve about a possible HYDRA mission or the time difference simply meant the other was asleep. Steve knew he was being dramatic, but it had felt like they were living two separate lives.
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the tower, no superheroes were stirring, all snug in their beds after dinner and a shower. Their presents were all placed under the tree with care, in the hope that Christmas morning would soon be there.
Steve rolls his eyes fondly as if he hoped Tony would be in a better mood but somehow knew that he was holding onto his annoyance like a vice to lay into him later when they weren’t in public. “He’s a kid. They're supposed to get a little messy now and then.”
The slip-ups only got worse though the more Steve focused on it. They were always small details, nothing serious, but Tony wasn’t known for being average, and these were things that Tony knew. He forgot the name of one of the Stark Industries board members when he was on the phone with Pepper, who seemed to take the slip-up as his usual snark and not a mistake, because Tony didn't make those. When he talked about his latest projects he would forget the correct verbiage until JARVIS helped him out, which usually ended up with Tony threatening to give him a virus. Tony couldn’t seem to remember which Mark version of the Iron Man suit he was on, which might have been the most alarming to Steve considering the suit was his greatest accomplishment and first love. The more occurrences Steve noticed, the more worried he became, until he and Tony made a doctor's appointment.
There are no good days anymore. The disease has ravaged Tony beyond recognition. He is no longer his Tony, the man he fell desperately in love with. Communication has all but ceased and what does come out of Tony's mouth, Steve can't understand except for a word or two. A wheelchair has become his only source of movement, which he has to be strapped into since he can no longer properly hold himself up. He needs help eating, dressing and using the restroom. The doctors tell Steve that it's only a matter of time before he'll lose the ability to swallow or control his bladder, unless an infection kills him first.
Steve still remembers the day Tony forgot who he was. He had been exhausted trying to manage Tony’s day to day, raising Peter and handling paperwork SHIELD threw at him. Captain America had been given up long ago when he was too afraid to leave Tony alone, and his entire day became filling in blanks for his husband. The one thing Steve held on to was being a safe haven for Tony, even though he knew that would inevitably end too.
“First off, you didn’t make these, I did,” Steve points out, setting the plate out of the way on the table. “So, technically I’m still taking care of you. Secondly, I made them for me and you came in like the damn Cookie Monster.”
When they are finally ushered to the stage to take the photo, Tony automatically moves off to the side to watch. After being in line for so long, he wants nothing to do with any of this anymore. But Steve? Steve is overly ecstatic, which is oddly endearing. He excitedly makes small talk with Santa before placing Peter on his lap and then begrudgingly making his way over to the sidelines to wait with Tony, as if he’d rather be in the picture and the midst of it all. Tony huffs at his antics because being with Steve is like having an overly excited puppy — cute, but reminiscent of another child. Tony follows his heartfelt gaze and it’s only a matter of seconds before Tony realizes this isn’t going to go as smoothly as Steve had hoped.
He stills inside allowing Tony time to adjust, and Tony moans loudly, lost in his lust. “Steve,” Tony pleads, “more, I need more,” as his ass pushes back, craving Steve like a whore.
The whole day had so far been a chaotic mess, but that night had been the best anniversary Steve could remember. They had pulled up to some run-down diner and ordered enough burgers for an army before getting back into the town car and having Happy just aimlessly drive around. In the backseat of that car with the tinted windows, Steve and Tony stuffed their faces with greasy goodness they usually didn't allow themselves to indulge in, recounted stories from their first few years of marriage that had them laughing so hard their eyes watered and they rolled around in the backseat like a couple of horny teenagers. As they finally made their way back towards the tower and Tony was slumped against Steve's side, the brunette's head resting on his shoulder, Steve knew that this was an anniversary he would never forget in a million years.
Tony starts walking over in Natasha’s direction, but changes course when he notices her.  He spares the partygoers one last glance before leaving through the same set of double-doors that Steve did.
After a few minutes, Tony cleared his throat: “So…”
,” she says irritably, “or you can suck it up, and walk down that hallway and
Tony took a few shuddering breaths, one hand clenched in the mud at his feet and the other settling on Steve’s thigh to steady himself, fingers spasming. He didn’t think they’d ever get the chance to fix whatever it was they had between them.

birthday when he’s approached by a tall woman with short dark hair wearing a suit that probably cost more than Steve’s childhood home.
“Not really.  We could go to a cheap motel in the middle of nowhere for all I care.  I just want to be with you.”
“Aw, no need for that, Cap.  I’m just telling it like it is,” Tony said before taking another bite of his pizza. “You’ve got the whole package,” he said with his mouth half-full.  It was kind of endearing, which Steve found strange. “So you’ve just gotta make it work.”
“You haven’t even finished the first one,” Steve says incredulously, but he starts unpacking the box of goodies anyway. “I still don’t believe your doctors, y’know.”
He may have hated magic, but he still couldn’t help the tiny pang of disappointment when all he felt was a light breeze.
“No, I’m not.  I’m tired and cranky because I’ve made myself exhausted worrying over you.”
“Will do, Pep.”
They do it again a few times over the summer before they go off to college, and Steve uses it as a learning opportunity.  He learns how to fuck, what it’s like to

“I love you, too, by the way.”
Tony feels Steve’s hand on his arm, and he lets the other man turn him back around, but Tony resolutely does not meet his eyes.  “I have… I need to go.  Mrs. Arbogast is going to have my head if I miss my meeting again and–”
“I’m not asking for forever,” Tony says. “Just promise me you’ll try.”
“They’re

“You,” Steve responded without hesitation.

“Coffee?” Steve offered, already on his way to the coffee maker.
“Which is literally our situation right now–”
“I think I, of all people, would know if I was dating Tony Stark.”
“Hey!” Bucky says defensively. “Shouldn’t you be

isn’t up for a little romp in the sack?”
“Often enough,” Sarah confirms. “I remember the first time I caught him stumbling out of the coatroom with one of his childhood friends.”
“I don’t think setting me up on a blind date with a girl who is barely legal constitutes as trying to help me,” Steve said.  Why they had thought he would have anything in common with a behavioral neuroscience student, he had no idea.
“I messed up,” he says dejectedly. “He needed someone, and I pushed him away.”
They stand awkwardly for a minute or two before Tony clears his throat and speaks again. “So… why me?” he asks.
But even supersoldiers eventually run out of patience, and Steve finally draws the line after Tony momentarily leaves the room after a couple of rounds in the sack, only to come back with a half-full box of double-chocolate cupcakes.
Tony made a noise of affirmation, propping his chin on his on Steve’s chest. “Steve, I—”
“They aren’t
“It’s not that simple.”
Ty turns back to look at Tony. “Well?  Are you gonna tell your friend to leave us alone?”
Steve immediately kissed back, but tried to keep  He pulled the other man closer so he was flush against him, their cocks rubbing against each other through the fabric of their clothes.
He’s played this scenario in his head countless times, so he’s prepared for Steve to put up more of a fight.  He’s ready for Steve to rebuke every one of his calculated claims, but it never comes.
Steve huffs and reaches up to touch his face: it feels warm under his fingertips, and he realizes he’s starting to get a little hot under the collar.   “Still gets the blood flowing I guess.”
Tony expects her to go into detail and roll off the list of injuries like she were giving a debrief after a mission, but she remains silent.  A small part of him wants to know more, but he already has an idea (and if he’s honest with himself, he doesn’t know if he can actually handle a more vivid image at the moment).  “Where did you find him?”
Steve blinked. “Help me out with what?”

It wasn’t until after dinner, when the team was seated around the television watching
Tony makes a strangled sound.
Even the sunrise is a painful reminder of what he’s lost.

“Because of

He goes to college and spends mornings in class, afternoons in the studio, and nights partying with his friends.  His roommate, Bucky, introduces him to Peggy halfway through sophomore year, and she and Steve hit it off right away.
, he felt a little… well, unsure.  After all, he had barely known the man at that point, so he wasn’t sure what kind of boundaries there were.
Tony glanced at Steve‘s face before looking back at the plate again. “No, it’s… It’s nothing,” he said.  He practically snatched the plate from Steve’s hand before sitting back down at the table.
Tony mulls over his response. “It’s… complicated.”
Tony grins. “You love it.”
“God knows I want to give you what you want, Tony, but you should be with someone who actually deserves you—”
"Great.”  He somehow manages to slip away from Steve’s body and the table, and starts making his way up the stairs to his apartment. “Just give me twenty minutes to shower and put on some decent clothes, and then we can take your bike."
The comfort never lasts, though.  It’s always fleeting, and leaves him feeling emptier than before.  He can't shake the feeling that he's missing something.  He doesn’t really know what it is, but he hasn’t been able to find anyone to really explore the possibilities with either.
Natasha’s bark was answer enough for the both of them.
Clint scowled. “You don’t sound apologetic at all.”
—says tightly. “Always a pleasure.”
When the team re-convened in the middle of all of the wreckage, Tony had opened up a compartment in his armor and pulled out a bag of licorice.
“I—I want…” Steve breathed out, reeling for words.  He still couldn’t believe how easy it was for Tony to turn him into an incoherent mess. “Tony, I want—”
“What you did was very bold, Anthony Stark,” a voice said above him.
“Friends,” Tony says slowly.
“You won’t,” Steve said, determinedly. He cupped Tony’s cheek. “You won’t.  I’ll always have you, and you’ll always have me, because I love you.”
Tony gaped. “You know about that?”
Steve’s job is by no means an easy one.  Protecting the security of the free world isn’t exactly a 9 to 5 job, and as rewarding as it can be at the end of the day, it’s a constant weight on Steve’s shoulders.
Steve cupped Tony’s face and brought their lips together.  He gasped when Tony swiped his tongue across his bottom lip and deepened it.  Steve felt the near-painful grip of Tony’s hands as they clutched their shoulders and tried to find some sort of leverage; Steve was sure that man would’ve been on the floor if Steve’s body wasn’t pinning him to the wall already.
Tony hadn’t been able to bear the thought of losing his friends, but Wanda made him
“Tony,” Thor said calmly, putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but Tony moved away. “I am sure he meant no harm—”
But now, it was nearly eleven at night, an hour after the endorphins of Steve’s last orgasm had worn off, and Steve was wide awake.

“So…” Steve ventured. “I was wondering if you were still available for dinner tonight like we planned.”
He brought his knees up to his chest, trying to will the cold away, and burrowed deeper under the covers.  The rustle of the sheets was enough to slow the tapping of Tony’s fingers on his tablet before stopping altogether.
“Are you seriously watching this trash?”

“I want to, though,” Steve says dolefully.
“Natasha?  I thought you were leaving—oh, uh… wow?”  Sam freezes in the doorway when he spots Tony sitting next to Steve’s hospital bed. “You’re Tony Stark.”
“I wasn’t thinking that,” Rhodey assured. “No one is.”
The feeling of Steve filling him up again and again was illuminating—each slide never feeling like enough, but simultaneously being too much for him to take.
Tony’s surprised to find the ring on the nightstand when he gets home.
, Tony,” he said, spreading the precome at the tip. “Just you.  All of you.”
Tony settles for discreetly reaching for Steve’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “I'm here.  I'm here now with you, and that's all that matters.”
“That… that’s not the point—”
Steve looked at him incredulously. ”…a kiss?“
“Or you just figured I wasn’t important?” Tony called after Steve, unable to keep the full scope of the rejection out of his voice.  Steve stopped in front of the door of the shed.

“I want
Sam groaned. “Jesus Christ, this is not helping my hangover—”
I’m not letting you build me a suit of armor,” Steve interjected. “I like my suit just fine.”
“What actually happened to me?” Steve asked. “I remember getting hit with—”
“You make me happy—”
“Yeah?” Steve squeezes Tony’s hand. “I’m glad.”
"We're
“…right.”
"Tony, are you okay?” the man asks, genuine concern etched on his features.
Tony gives him an unimpressed look but complies anyway, opening the box to reveal a simple gold band tucked inside. “You were going to propose?”
Natasha scoffs. "Were you actually <em>trying</em> to be discreet?"
Steve shook his head.  He could see the strain in Tony’s shoulders from trying to control himself and keeping his movements slow and careful, and Steve was struggling just as much, thoroughly surprised that the fabric in his hands hadn’t ripped into shreds yet.  “I need

“What’s going on?” Tony and Pepper looked towards the elevator and saw Steve walking over, dressed in his workout gear. “I was going to go for a run,” the man continued, “but there’s a swarm of paparazzi outside the mansion.  Did something happen?”

“We are very happy for you two,” Thor said earnestly.

“I know.”  Without warning, Tony grabbed Steve’s book and tossed it to the other end of the couch.

“What cause should we donate the proceedings to?” Pepper asked.

Steve nods, and the corner of his mouth quirks into a small smile. “I thought you were good at multitasking.”

For all of the shit he’s been going through as of late, Tony actually thinks his life is going pretty well.

admirable.
Tony looked at him skeptically. “You still want to get married.”
“Right, but I thought I’d try to… finish it early?” Tony offers lamely, and it’s so pathetic Rhodey considers almost giving him a pass just because of that.
“We should get milkshakes after this,” Tony suggested.
“So what’s on the agenda for tonight?” Steve asked, hoping to shift the topic away from his bedpartners.  He poured a liberal amount of maple syrup onto his last pancake, ignoring the disgusted look on Tony’s face.
“I didn’t mean—Tony, calm down. Jesus,” Steve hissed when Tony tried fighting him off.  He cast a wary glance towards the direction of the house. Tony yanked his arm away with a snarl that was lost to the rain, but he overcompensated, feet sliding in the wet grass. He flailed and landed on one knee, nearly clocking his head on the side of the shed. He batted Steve’s hand away when he tried to help.
“You mean you’d rather me hurt you than the other way around?” Steve clarified, and the other man said nothing. “Tony, why do you always try to find ways to punish yourself?”
Then Steve winks, and Tony’s pretty sure he died in the elevator on the way up, because this is not reality, this cannot be reality.  There is no possible way that any of this is happening right now, he clearly must be dead.  It’s the only explanation.
But before Tony can even make his body cooperate, Steve pulls back.  His cheeks are flushed, and his lips slightly swollen, and it’s the cutest thing Tony has ever seen.
I did this.”
“If you’re asking for an apology, you’re not getting one,” Steve says resolutely.
“Don’t sell yourself short, Wilson.  I’ve seen what you can do.”
Tony burrowed his face in the crook of Steve’s neck. “You know I love you, right?” he murmured against Steve’s skin.
Tony’s hands framed Steve’s face—they were roughened and hard after years of working, but his touch was gentle, and Steve leaned into it.  He loved it, loved the feeling of Tony’s skin against his, and Steve knew that he would never get tired of the underlying crackle of electricity that pulsed in Steve’s veins.

Tony thought for a moment before shaking his head. “Naah, I’m good,” he quipped before spinning her.
“Just shut up and make love to me.”
“The gardens are right around the corner,” Steve suggested, getting to his feet. “I thought some greenery might be a nice change of pace from the cement and concrete we usually see.”
“I know that, but you still should go out and meet people.  You can’t just sit around, waiting for the right person to come along,” Tony reasoned. “It doesn’t work like that anymore—”
Another way to assert his power over Tony, maybe.
“More than whatever that jackass was willing to give you,” Steve mutters under his breath, which Tony finds absolutely endearing.
“Then everyone else was an idiot,” Tony said, point blank. “I saw pictures of you from before
“Don’t worry, I’ve got it,” Steve says. “Why don’t you sit down?  I’ll fix you up a new cup, too.”
He remembers Steve putting the mark there earlier that night—the two of them had just gotten back from dinner and barely made it into the elevator with their clothes on, and Tony’s head was spinning from the champagne.
It’s the first time Steve’s had sex with anyone he’s cared so deeply about, and it’s as exhilarating as it is terrifying.
“Considering
“So relaxed,” Tony explains. “You’re usually always so tense.  Always working.”
“Okay, I won’t,” Pepper said teasingly. “Anyway, we were wondering if you know who’s behind it since you aren’t narcissistic enough to do it yourself, regardless of what the media says.”
“Before what?” Steve snapped. “Before we slept together?”
“It’s just a small favor.”
Tony stared at him blankly for a few seconds before bursting into laughter. “You… you’re something else, Steve.”  He took the safety goggles off his head and carelessly tossed them in the direction of his workbench, missing the surface by a couple of feet.  “JARVIS, order a couple pizzas for us?”
“I…” It was at that moment that Tony realized he had absolutely no idea why he was keeping Steve up. Sure, he wanted to talk, but… well, it wasn’t exactly fair for him to unload all of his insecurities on Steve
“Tony, it’s okay.  Really.  This isn’t an ultimatum or anything—”
“Right.  Of course, mother,” Steve says, licking his lips.  He stands up and makes his way to the door. “I’ll go get our coats,” he adds before slipping out of the room.

“Not really, no.”
By the second date, it became glaringly obvious that Steve didn’t do well under pressure: Tony had merely asked Steve to talk about himself, and he became terribly flustered.  Steve had somehow managed to trip their waiter, which caused the man to drop the salads he was carrying onto Tony’s head.
Tony scoffs. He’s already perched on Santa like a toddler, no way does he plan on smiling and letting Steve think this is okay in any way.
Before the moment even begins though, it’s over. Tony’s face changes to a look of bewilderment as his eyes lock onto something on the table to Steve’s left and his hips hover above Steve’s as if he’s frozen in time. He tries to gently nudge his husband to lower into his lap, unsure of what exactly has him in a trance.
When the night had come, Steve whisked Tony off on his motorcycle. The feeling of Tony pressed against him, clutching tightly to his shirt, still vividly ingrained in his mind. They raced over the Brooklyn Bridge - just enjoying the feeling of the wind whipping through their clothes - until Steve parked his bike at a small, family-owned pizza shop. Taking their food with them, they had walked hand in hand to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade where they sat and ate, watching the twinkling lights of the sprawling New York City landscape. It was probably the cheapest date Tony had ever been on, but it was all Steve had wanted, him and Tony laughing and snuggling for warmth under the starry sky.
As they work to calm their son, Steve has let other families take their photos. Some end up in the same boat as them, while the lucky few are in and done within minutes. Each time Tony thinks that Peter is ready to begin again and tries to set him back on Santa’s lap, he just clings tighter and his cries grow impossibly louder.
“Who says my baby won’t always be sweet and innocent?” Tony asks, trying to lighten the mood. He’s finding it hard to hold onto any lingering anger when Steve’s good intentions were always planned with him and their son in mind.
Steve mustn’t care because he’s giving it his all, and Tony’s reasonably certain his screams can be heard down the hall. He can feel Steve’s fingers digging into his thigh leaving marks, it’s like Steve’s claiming his territory and producing his own landmarks.
“What? No.” Steve shakes his head. He’s flabbergasted by the genuine confusion from his husband. ”Tony, have you never had a s’more?”
“Relax, I’m going to take care of you,” Steve whispers in his ear; Tony’s reward is finally coming, he barely stifles a cheer. It’s thick and long as Steve pushes his cock in filling Tony to the brim, until he’s fully engulfed and stretching Tony’s rim.
Steve fails miserably to stifle a chuckle at the terrible puns Tony has made without even knowing. He tries to use his hands to conceal the goofy grin he wears as Tony, his adorable little genius, fails to understand him.
They are still a few spots from the front and Tony considers calling it quits. He’s exhausted, a combination of lack of sleep from throughout the week and being denied extra caffeine this morning when he was rushed out to this hell hole. His body is just as tired from holding his growing boy for so long and just standing in one place for an extended period of time. Tony’s never been one to seek out sleep without being told to do so, but his bed sounds real good right about now, especially if Steve is cocooned around him.
Steve remembers it all, even the parts he wishes to forget. The only problem is that no one else does. Most of Steve's reawakening from the ice had involved Tony, and the one person he had shared so many firsts with, didn't remember their first kiss, their wedding, or him. He is the only person keeping a record of their time and the short amount they have left.
Steve’s brows furrow while he ponders, and Tony sees the exact moment a light bulb goes off in his head by the way the sly smirk spreads across his face and a healthy glow dusts his cheeks. “I do,” Steve proudly replies, before a look of worry crosses his face and his tone becomes hesitant. “But, you’re not going to like it.”
Steve still remembers their wedding. They didn’t want the paparazzi, media or some villain to ruin their special day so the details had been kept under wraps. It was a small affair, only about fifty of their closest friends, at a private mansion in California that they rented out for the event. Their handmade fitted suits were a deep black, adorned with a red tie with gold accents, representing both of their colors. And as Colonel Rhodes walked Tony down the aisle, Steve was pretty sure his perfect heart skipped a beat.
It had become apparent very early on that trying to separate Tony and Peter was never a good idea. They were inseparable the minute Peter had entered the tower. Tony would spend all day cooing at the child who never left his arms and gladly woke up in the middle of the night at the barest hint of a cry. As Peter aged, their hands-on approach to parenting didn't change, but their lives did. It was like a flip had been switched and there were no longer all-nighters in the workshop, excessive working hours or a million meetings held by SHIELD. Steve and Tony remained Avengers, but they were reserved for world-ending wars instead of spending time dealing with an untrained villain that Natasha could take down in her sleep. Their lives had become about each other and nothing else, and Steve didn't think he could get any happier.
He has to clear his throat and feign nonchalance when he notices Tony become rigid as he so usually does when he becomes nervous and feels like people are laughing at his expense. If Steve doesn’t nip this in the bud now, he knows Tony will shut down and he’ll be looking forward to a night of emotionally distant Tony, which could take weeks to correct.
Colonel Rhodes took Iron Man's spot on the Avengers, but they disbanded about a year ago, letting the younger generation of superheroes take over. The team all visited Tony after he was diagnosed, but they came less and less the more Tony's health declined, stating it was too difficult to see their friend in such a state. Now a days, Rhodes is the only one who consistently drops by. Sometimes he just sits in silence with Tony, smiling fondly at his best friend. Other times, Steve catches him regaling stories from their MIT days, and although he tries to hide it, Steve can hear the pain in his voice. Bruce stopped showing up when the sight of Tony almost brought the Hulk out. He had worked for years on a cure with world-renowned doctors and scientists, but none of their prototypes garnered positive results. As a desperate last attempt, Thor had even asked Loki for help, but that too hadn't worked. It seemed Alzheimer's had no natural enemy.
Steve still remembers the first time he said I love you. He knew he'd been pining for Tony since the battle of New York, and there was no mistaking that what he felt towards the man was pure unadulterated love. That phrase was always on the tip of his tongue threatening to spill out, but he kept his lips sealed and bid his time. Tony needed to say it first, come to the conclusion on his own, so that Steve knew he wasn't rushing him or moving too fast. The longer he waited in anticipation though, Steve became more nervous that Tony didn't feel the same way.
Tony can feel the come in his ass and the glide of Steve’s hand before he hears Steve say, “Come for me, sweetheart,” but it’s more like a command. His whole body tenses, every muscle wound tight, then he’s wantonly mewling as his vision goes white.
“Hey buddy,” Steve calls out to Peter as he moves his hands wildly. “Look at me, can you say cheese for Papa?”
“Way too late I’m afraid,” Tony remarks, nodding his head in mock sympathy. “That serum of yours has ruined the merchandise for anyone else. I'm afraid you’re stuck with damaged goods.”
He’s settling in on the couch for a presumably quiet night with his book and homemade snack in hand when Tony finally surfaces from his dungeon he calls a workshop. Steve spares a glance at him as he shuffles into the kitchen and takes note of his disheveled hair, socked feet and one of
There was no one to call that would be able to calm Tony down, except maybe Rhodey, but he had been with the Avengers on a mission. It was possible that he would have remembered one of the others, but trying to play guess who with a frightened man at that ungodly hour had seemed like a terrible idea. JARVIS had spoken before Steve even reacted and to his surprise, Tony was relieved to hear his old friend. Tony had been looking for his human butler JARVIS, but by the time the A.I. explained how he had come to be, Tony had calmed down enough to trust JARVIS to bridge the gaps in his memory for him. While Tony's panic had subsided enough to be in the same room with Steve, he didn’t leave any chance to get near him. That night, Steve slept in a spare bedroom at Tony’s request and cried himself to sleep, wondering how many more of those nights he’d have to face.
date. As they reached the penthouse floor where he was dropping Tony off, and they shared a soft sensual kiss complete with exploring tongues that seemed to last for hours, Steve knew he wanted to give Tony so many more firsts.
Tony gets the sentiment, he really does. Steve had grown up in a different time and under very different circumstances. Even after all these years, he hates when Tony throws his money around when it’s unnecessary, not seeming to realize that Tony can afford to do so, let alone wants to do so for his family. Who else better to share his wealth with than the two who make him happiest?
Tony feels his arousal pool in his gut, and braces himself for the inevitable with his eyes clenched shut. But then, Steve abruptly removes his fingers, and Tony's left with only a fleeting feeling that lingers.
He was lost in his thoughts about the boy in his arms when the flash erupted before his eyes. Before he could clear his vision, Steve had practically scooped them both up and rushed them off stage. Steve happily spun Peter in the air, praising him. “You did so great, bubba! You’re such a big boy now!”
“Jesus, fuck yes,” Tony rasps, “I’m so close,” and Steve just rocks his hips faster saying he knows. A hand reaches down enclosing Tony’s cock, while his ears fill with the sound of sweet talk.
Steve pumps it in slowly at a steady rate, exercising meticulous care to prep and not hit his prostate. It feels wondrous and Tony arches back, of course, it figures Captain America would have a plan of attack.
Steve still remembers when he proposed. He had been holding on to the band for weeks trying to find the perfect moment to ask Tony to be his. No moment ever seemed right and the longer he held on to the small jewelry box, the more pressure he felt at getting it right. There was no doubt that Tony was his endgame. No one else would ever compare to the genius, and the feelings he ignited in Steve was just a constant reminder.
Tony tilts his head, getting a good look at the item, but makes no effort to take it. “It looks disgusting.”
“I’ll fucking show you—“
Fall also comes with the added bonus of seeing Tony walk around in just one of his sweatshirts, which never fails to get his pulse racing.
As the ceremony ended, Steve and Tony had met in a bedroom before heading to the reception and exchanged their vows. Steve had known that Tony wasn’t willing to be vulnerable in front of a crowd and happily accepted the middle ground, which turned out to be more beautiful than he could have ever imagined. Tony had promised to love him with the same passion that he put into his projects, to spend the rest of his life enjoying the moments with Steve instead of losing them in the workshop and to love him fiercely until his dying breath. The love pouring from his husband - God, he would never stop saying that - was overwhelming. Steve’s vows were simple and to the point, promising what he knew he could provide and quelling any reservations Tony had ever expressed. He promised to always protect him from harm and stand with him against his troubles, to share in the celebration of his triumphs and love him all the more for his failures and to love him faithfully and unconditionally through difficult and easy times, for as long as they both shall live.
“Okay, Uncle! Uncle!” Tony cries out, batting Steve’s face away to take another bite of the s’more still in his hand. “Jesus, I know I’m irresistible but I’m trying to eat here. I expected better of you since
Steve idly wonders if he’s just making a pit stop or done working for the night, but when Tony doesn’t acknowledge him, he assumes his husband will depart for another all-nighter and buries his head back into his book before indulging in the treat he prepared. Before he’s even finished reading the first page though, Tony plops down beside him with an audible sigh and Steve can already see the
sweatshirts that dwarfs Tony’s small frame, hitting about mid-thigh. While he looks delectable, part of Steve wants to chastise him about his workshop outfit of choice and the importance of safety.
Steve still remembers watching his husband deteriorate before his own eyes. Dr. Cho had told him that late stages of the disease would impair Tony's basic motor skills, but it was another thing entirely to see it happen in real time. It was devastating to watch Tony - who had been a superhero for crying out loud - become entirely dependent on those around him.
He pointed up and Tony followed his finger to find a giant, gaudy mistletoe hanging above them. “I didn’t realize we were recreating
Steve still remembers the phone call that brought him to tears. The Alzheimer’s had been a painstaking battle in their lives. Tony seemed to forget more and more, and with that came frustration. Steve tried to help, to be the shoulder Tony could lean on, but each time he tried to assist, Tony lashed out and became volatile. It was understandable, but it didn’t mean it hurt any less.
Steve still remembers starting their family. Tony had been watching an overabundance of cheesy romantic comedies and a creepy amount of time fondly ogling families that they passed on the streets. They had never talked about children or starting a family, but Steve could tell it must be on Tony's mind. He never would have taken his husband as a family man - assuming he was content with his bots and A.I.'s - but Tony was always surprising him in the best ways. Steve waited for Tony to bring the issue up himself which happened to take a lot longer than he expected. He had hinted towards it and threw out generalized statements a few times, but Steve never took the bait, wanting Tony to ask for what he desired and know that Steve would provide. It took weeks of Steve feigning ignorance at Tony's hints before his husband finally blurted the question out as they were driving home from dinner. He wanted a baby, a bundle of joy that he could raise with Steve.
Lowering to one knee, Steve had asked Tony to marry him there in the penthouse bathroom. If Tony wanted to claim him and make his mark, there would be nothing better than a ring on his left hand to solidify their love. It was a promise to be Tony’s, forever and always. There was a sobbed yes heard from above as Steve released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. That night they showed up two hours late to the event – after cleaning up the tear tracks littered down their faces and a hasty escapade that resulted in both of them needing a change of attire – and spent the evening sharing the news with the rest of their friends in attendance.
Steve stopped them in the middle of the mall, his signature million-dollar smile lighting up his face as he looked at Tony.
And whatever brownie points Steve’s all American looks just scored him vanish in an instant, which Tony makes known with another look of disdain. “I am this close to making you sleep on the couch,” Tony warns as he brings his thumb and pointer finger incredibly close together right in front of Steve. “I can’t believe I let you talk me into this. We could have paid for twenty Santa’s to come to the tower, but
“Only one way to find out,” Steve murmurs as he leans in and nibbles at Tony’s neck. As much of a hit as the snacks were, Steve is smug to see Tony hastily forget them in favor of the promise of some adult fun with his husband.
His hand lifts Tony’s leg permitting him to thrust impossibly deeper, and Tony knows right away that Steve is a keeper. He’s groaning in pleasure, pleased with Tony’s performance, his sounds mixing with Tony’s pants as they collide like a chorus.
“Relax, mama bear.” His hands rest gently on Tony’s shoulders and he aims for a calming tone, but Tony’s wound far too tight right now to find it anything but irritating.
Part of him wishes that Tony had hit him with a repulsor blast on the helicarrier all those years ago, finished him off before they started the whirlwind that had been their life. Tony may not be dead yet, but he might as well be, and Steve doesn't know what to do with that revelation. How is he supposed to live in a world without Tony? Without his other half? He isn't sure he can. Steve can't see a light at the end of the tunnel. His world view now is too shrouded in shadows.
Tony had been driving to the high school when one of his episodes had occurred. Now, Steve’s husband was pulled over on a road somewhere in New York, lost and afraid. Steve remembers hearing horns blaring and the sounds of traffic whizzing by through the phone, but Tony was in no state to provide a location, and Steve wasn’t sure he could even if he had tried. The thought of Tony being all alone with no situational awareness brought Steve to tears. With a heavy heart, Steve excused himself and Peter from the science fair to find Tony, who they located using the cell phone's GPS. Peter stayed on the line with Tony as they drove and Steve could tell his husband was trying to desperately keep it together so their son wouldn’t be upset. The man cracked a few jokes but each one fell short as the gravity of the situation was heard in his tone.
After an impromptu make-out session following their emotional declarations of love, they had made their way to the reception where they were greeted by those they loved. A few tears were shed when Jim and Bucky gave their best man speeches, but for the most part the evening was spent with laughter filtering through the air, good food in their bellies and a charming ocean breeze. As they gathered on the dance floor for their first dance as a married couple, some sappy ballad played as they slow danced under the twinkling fluorescent lights. Tony's head laid against Steve's broad chest and his arms wrapped around his waist as they twirled around in a world of their own, oblivious to the onlookers and focused solely on each other. Steve knew he would never forget the feeling of Tony's warm body pressed against him and the chill of the air as they spent the rest of the evening floating on cloud nine.
Ah, shit. Well, Steve knows why that is, and it’s not because he hates gay people. Quite the opposite. It’s because he likes a
“Sounds like you should have kept it,” Tony coughs. Laughs. Shakes his head. “Your friend. Bucky. He sounds like a good guy. He was in the, ah,” he waves his hand, uncrosses his hands from his knees so he’s slightly more relaxed, though he’s still curled around himself like he’d like to hide away as much of himself as possible.  “The comics. But he didn’t steal, in those. Mostly just…protected America.”
Tony didn’t even tell Steve, or call him—or Clint, or Nat, or anyone. He just fought
Barton has written.
Tony scoffs. “Stupid,” he says.
Steve blinks. Ty—Ty who drugged Tony. Is now his oversight. Fury assigned Tony to be overseen by Ty. “What does outside oversight mean?” he asks. Nat doesn’t look up. “Nat. What does outside oversight mean.” There’s a bead of blood coming from his thumb. The glass must have cut it. It doesn’t matter. It’ll heal in a few seconds.
Mentioning Tony reminds Steve of what Nat told him earlier. He hasn’t had a moment to think about it since their conversation, but when he thinks back on it, really. Fury needs to be spoken to, though Steve can’t very well call him up, since he’s probably not supposed to know what’s going on, and he doesn’t want Nat to get into trouble. He still doesn’t understand how Fury got Tony to agree to oversight—he doesn’t even agree to blackmail, for god’s sake. There’s nothing in this world that can convince Tony Stark to do something he doesn’t want to do, and that mollifies Steve a bit. Maybe Tony wants to work with this company. Maybe they have something he needs.
” He crooks an eyebrow at Steve. “Were you around for that one? It’s old.”
The fridge is packed. He eventually pulls out an apple—he’s not really hungry, after all—and shuts it again. Tony is still trying to turn on the coffee machine. They haven’t said a word to one another, and Steve suddenly thinks that he needs to say something, needs to say something or he’ll burst, so he says, “I’m sorry. About today. I don’t even remember what I was yelling about, but—well.” And then he very determinedly looks away from Tony and out the window.
Tony considers this. “Coffee,” he decides, stumbles over to the machine, and refills his mug. He steadies himself on the counter, frowns, and looks up at Steve. “Kay.”
Because he
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” Nat replies. “Obviously, he’s a bit…well. Anyways, I think this is a powerplay that my boss is going to lose. It’ll make him look weak in the end, which will only make his situation worse. Ugh. Anyways.”
After ten minutes—five? thirty?—Ty’s thumb moves under his shirt. Onto his skin. Which is—fine. It’s in the same place, Tony reasons. What’s a layer of cloth. What’s a shirt, anyway. Let’s all be nudists. It would do a lot to combat shame. Or whatever.
Steve is standing in the doorway, mouth slightly open, duffel in hand and hair slightly mussed like he just got off the plane.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks. Stupid question. He was drugged last night, beat up, and now he’s just had a panic attack. There’s a pretty obvious answer there.
Steve is in a café in Paris.
“I thought you, y’know. Didn’t like gay people,” he says, finally.
His phone cracks under his thumb.
“Ty,” Steve reminds.
He takes out his phone and googles
“Do you know him?” he asks.
“I see,” Ty says, and frowns. “Try routing this wire around here, that opens up this space, see? That way you don’t run into the insulator problem.” He reaches an arm around Tony to point out where the wire should go, boxing Tony in. He doesn’t move the arm when he’s done talking, puts his other arm on the other side instead, so Tony can’t get out.
even tries—and fails—to ask Jarvis, who clams up, though he has that tone of voice like he wishes he could say something. He googles “Tony Stark and Tyrone dating?”, and “Tony Stark in a relationship with Tyler?”, and “Tony Stark and Tyson break-up news,” but none of those return results.
He nearly gives Fury a call, but his head is pounding and that voice will either send him over the edge or put him right to sleep. He’ll see him at their meeting later today, anyways, and give him a piece of his mind. Viastone tech. Jesus. Fury should be embarrassed.
Tony looks away. Focuses on Fury, who's not even looking at him. He can’t tell whether he’s being normal or not. He doesn't remember how to act.
“You shouldn’t have to,” Steve says as Tony walks away. “Handle yourself. You shouldn’t have to,” he repeats.
Tony pulls a mug out of the cabinet, sets it down on the counter a little too hard. The coffee machine dings, and Tony pours his mug full to the brim.
“You don’t want to hear it,” Tony advises him.
And six years ago, when Ty had tried to blackmail him with that stupid, godawful sex tape—well, Tony hadn’t gotten rid of that, but he’s dripping with sex tapes at this point, so. One more out there on the internet wasn’t any great loss. Ty didn’t succeed in blackmailing him, anyways.
something, but he can’t. Because then Ty will go running to Fury and Tony will have to tell Fury everything, and he’s not doing that. He’s not. The whole fucking team has access to his record. They’re not reading about his—idiot sixteen-year-old-self. Steve, Steve’s not. No.
He’s not. He’s shaking, a little bit, the kind that comes straight from his core. Anxiety. It’s clenching his chest, too, clipping his breath. He doesn’t want to say that, though.
Right.
Steve shakes his head. He’s never heard of it.
if there are any mistakes/plot holes pls lmk!!! tysm <3
And that’s odd. Because Steve has told Tony. He’s pretty sure of that. He’s…he hasn’t told Tony, has he. “I’m bi,” he says with a shrug. “Men, women, anyone else.”
Ty moves his other hand on the other side of Tony’s waist, slips his other thumb under Tony’s shirt. He’s right behind Tony, now, and it’s—it’s just double. Two of something is the same as one of something, really. Lots of things come in twos. Chopsticks. Window curtains.
Steve thinks he knows what Tony’s getting at. “Your eyes are glassier than normal,” he says. “You’re a little pink.” He finally looks closely at Tony, closer than he’s dared to since he walked into the kitchen. “You’re—Jesus, is that blood?” he asks, because it is: there’s blood dripping from his nose. How had he not noticed before? “Tony. Your nose is bleeding.”
Right. That would help. Steve being upstairs.
is all, and that’s not helpful, he’s not working faster, he’s working
S.H.I.E.L.D. sponsored the event.
“Coffee sounds great, Tones,” Ty says.
Something thrums in chest—strength. That’s strength, because this is the fucking line. Ty doesn’t get this. Tony had a plan, a plan to handle all this, but sometimes plans change. When they don’t work. When they’re bad plans. And giving Ty a blowjob is a bad plan and he won’t do it. Tony is nothing if not flexible.
Normally, he goes to a museum after their mission is finished, if he has the time. It makes him feel better. The art. But mission is over the day after tomorrow, if everything goes on schedule, and he’s planning on getting right on a plane. He’s been tapping his foot this whole mission, checking his watch, checking his email. Hoping to hear from Tony.
Mary Poppins. Steve nods. “Tony made me watch it. Said it was a crime that I had never seen Dick Van Dyke.” And then curled up next to Steve on the couch, singing along to the songs, and Steve wanted to kiss him, but he doesn’t add that part. Obviously.
Tiberius Stone is good looking, in a sort of fake way. All white teeth and carefully done hair. And again, when Steve sees his picture, something about it catches. As if he’s seen him before. But Steve is pretty sure he’s never met the guy.
“Your ex-boyfriend drugging and attacking you at fancy galas,” Steve adds.
He can’t do that.
“Clearly,” Tony grunts. He wants to make a
The coffee machine makes another clicking sound and he says, “What’re you doing over there, taking it apart?”
“Ty? Is he here?” he asks, and Steve hears something in his voice that makes his gut clench.
They’re showing up in a contract.
“I believe Sir is experiencing some problems in his workshop,” Jarvis says.
They both take off at a run, in pursuit, and so the conversation ends there.
The door to the lab swings open and someone blond walks in. He almost thinks it’s Steve.
Rohypnol. He’s had it enough times to know what it means.
Tony groans and draws his rolling chair up to a computer. He tries to ignore the pounding in his head the bright screen is causing as he does some quick typing. But things only get stranger when he goes into the back end of S.H.I.E.L.D. to purge Ty from any future guest lists so he
They’re on the fifth floor, now. Silence hangs heavy in the air. Fourth. The elevator starts to slow to a stop at the third and Ty walks out.
Tony blinks. Watches the doors close.
He’s not fast enough. Just as the doors are beginning to close, Ty works his way into the elevator like he’s in The Shining and he’s driven a hatchet through the doors. He smiles, too. Just like in the movie.
“Can you take me there?” Steve asks. “Now?”
Steve sighs again. Tony does do this a lot. Stays up for days, working on some project or another, mixes alcohol and coffee in ways that no person—not even a superhuman like Steve, much less someone with a heart condition—should. Steve’s gotten used to it. But he’s pretty sure Tony was at some gala tonight, based on the suit, not in his lab, so he’s not really sure what Tony’s staying awake for.
Steve taps on the ground. One, two. Tony’s looking around the room, tapping on his knee in rhythm. He’s still shaking, somewhat, and looks small.
That doesn’t make Steve feel better, but maybe it will if he keeps repeating it over and over.
It’s just a hand. Just molecules, really, and so is air, so what’s the difference? Nothing. Nothing substantial Tony is completely—unphased. He’s unphased.
Moving faster.
fault that the team knocks down a building or two while saving the literal earth. Which, okay, maybe it is, but still. Ridiculous.
Clint considers this, mouth full, and then makes a sound of approval.
Tony smiles. He definitely doesn’t smile this much, usually. Maybe he should stop smiling. His cheeks hurt, actually, but his whole body feels stiff, painted on. He's not sure he can stop. He counts to three, and stops smiling. There.
“You don’t point at him, you don’t touch him, you don’t talk to him. Got it?” Steve growls.
“You know, usually people say
“Well. Regardless, I’ve been telling Mr. Stone here about some of the…internal problems we’ve been having,” Fury continues, and at first Tony doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Internal problems? “We were thinking that we could bring in another individual. To moderate, and…” Fury keeps talking, but Tony tunes his voice out, because he knows, now, what Fury is talking about.
“Sorry,” Tony breathes, barely even realizes he’s saying it, because really, he
“Tony. Ty. Who is he?”
“You still think you’re smarter than me,” Ty clucks. “You’re not. You know you’re not, right?” he prods.
Steve can’t leave, now. He debates continuing the conversation, but Tony doesn’t seem all that interested. He considers going to the fridge again, but if he eats anything more, he won’t sleep at all tonight.
“How can I help you, sir?”
Clint nods and lets his head fall back on the bed.
“Did the guy ever get his watch back?” Tony asks.
Steve sits closer, still a full cushion away from Tony, who pokes his knee and smiles.
Steve is feeling good. Antsy, still, but the afternoon went well. That means that the next couple of days will be cleanup, and then they can go back home. He feels the Tony-Tony-Tony knot easing in his chest as he sits down on the end of his bed.
” he stresses.
He guiltily looks up
“Well, Director Fury just thinks you need a push in the right direction, and I seem to remember you just take a bit of prodding to be a good listener,” Ty says, and winks. “I think we’ll work very well together, Tones. Yeah.”
“Here, sir,” Jarvis says. His voice is quiet, gentle, a blessing.
That’s where Steve has seen his face before. A blurry photo of a tall blonde guy making out with Tony in a club.
Ty’s smile shutters closed. He puts his hand on Tony’s arm. “Tony,” he says, his voice soft and disappointed, like Tony is a child. “That’s a bit rude, isn’t it? I see why Fury asked me to come help out…you can be pretty insulting, sometimes. I’m sure you didn’t mean it though,” he says, and his voice turns hard again, and cold. The threat is so, so obvious. “Did you?”
“I thought you were going to route the underneath. So it doesn’t get hooked by other lines, you know, if Fury or someone is—”
Beside him, Tony’s still fiddling with the coffee machine. It seems like he should have it down by now, Steve thinks, based on the sheer amount of coffee he drinks, but Tony’s weird about some things. Forgets basic stuff, like how many planets are in the solar system, even as he does science Steve can’t even begin to comprehend at a mile a minute.
He can handle this. He can.
joke, but he can’t spare the words—every syllable he speaks squeezes his head like a lemon. He tries to stand up so he can
Tony shakes his head. “Need to figure. What’s in—whasit’s.”
Except. The head of Vistastone Corp is sitting in one of the chairs in front of Fury’s desk.
“Right. Right.”
Tony takes offense at that too, apparently. “’M not a cowboy,” he protests. “
Nat’s hand is on his arm. Light. “Steve,” she says slowly. “We’re in the middle of a mission.”
Of course, no one on the team really likes sleeping. Nightmares are bad for almost all of them. But most of them accept sleep as something necessary. Tony usually does, too, when he’s not working on a project.
his brain supplies, and he ignores that thought. He ignores it.
“I really do,” Steve counters. He’s so intrigued. What did Tony have? A fan club? A collector’s set? Steve has signed enough toy soldiers, both back then and now, to know there was all sorts of merch out there, though he’s not seen much of Bucky. Maybe there are Captain America
of him, maybe, all tobacco and that fancy aftershave he uses, and it gets into Tony’s head and he can’t think.
Steve blinks. Looks at Tony, who seems unphased by what he’s just said. “Roofies?” he asks slowly. His heart thumps in his chest, one, two. “Like, he put something in your drink?”
and that’s bad. If he doesn’t work faster, Ty will be indefinite. And Ty can’t be indefinite. He needs to be gone, so that Tony can think, so that Tony can
Ty has found the perfect song, apparently, because “Dance, Dance, Dance” is playing on full volume. Great. Tony focuses on the schematic again, but it’s too late.
Which isn’t exactly a lie. But it doesn’t feel like the truth, either, and the sick feeling lying gives Steve makes him want to get up and pace. Instead he looks back at the linoleum floor. The easy laughter from a moment ago has drained from the room.
Tony focuses on what Ty said. Route the wire around, and then…it works. It works, which is—infuriating. He swallows again. Stares hard at the wires. How did Ty see that and he didn’t? His head, it’s not there. It’s somewhere else, it’s back at sixteen years old and he can’t, he can’t focus. Usually he would catch that. Usually. Right?
“Oh?” he follows up. “Do tell.”
“Nope,” Tony replies.
“Sir appears to be in a stable condition. Rest assured, I will watch his vitals.”
He gets up, stretches his legs. He really should go to the gym; he has way more nervous energy than is healthy. He leaves his room and makes his way down to the fifth floor, where the gym is. Luckily, it’s empty. He hates working out in front of other people.
Tony turns on the water. “You know. This—this fighting. It’s, you’re my AI. You’re supposed to, you know, help me out. Be on my side.”
“Don’t interrupt me,” Ty says sharply.
Steve.
Steve frowns. Outside oversight? Tony would hate that. More than that, he would never agree to it. “That is ridiculous,” he says. “Ton—the engineer is great at what he does.”
Tony didn’t want him involved. Even if Tony did ask for help, he would hardly ask Steve. This is none of his business.
Tony looks away. Back at the comms device. Away.
And then Ty, whoever the hell he is, will attack Tony again and it won’t end as well as this time and Steve is not going to let that happen.
Thank god for small mercies.
But StarkTech doesn’t
Steve sits down a few feet away from Tony. He doesn’t know what to do. In the war, people had panic attacks, though that’s not what they were called. He’s helped people through a few of them. But everything’s different now—mental health and medications and studies and Steve’s sure whatever he knows is completely inadequate.
Except it’s only been a week and a half, now, and Ty is leaning against his worktable, only about a foot from him, under the guise of looking at his work. And Tony can’t—he can’t think, with Ty so close. It’s the
And Ty is standing in front of Tony, pants undone and nose bleeding all over the floor.
He steps closer to Tony. They’re about a foot apart, now, and Tony knows,
“Clint’s right,” he manages. “We don’t need a guy in the window anymore. He can take my place.” He doesn’t want to leave his team in danger, understaffed, unprepared, but he
“He just,” Ty says, pointing at Tony with one hand and still clutching his bleeding nose with one hand, “Attacked me! I was standing here, trying to help, and he tried to—he—”
Tony doesn’t answer.
Steve’s head swings up. “What’s going on, Jarvis?” he asks. Jarvis hardly ever starts conversations with him. For a moment, he thinks that maybe he’s going to have to get suited up, there’s a threat, but no. The alert would have gone off.
One-on-one time. With Ty. All the time.
“You’ve always made such good coffee. Fucking no one makes it strong enough, y’know?” Ty says. “You, though, you get me.”
Tony slumps backward on the couch, puts his hand up to his nose and holds it lightly. His head tips backward over the cushions as he says, “Yes.”
He picks the mug up and holds it tight in his hand. His senses are still a little loopy, and he doesn’t want to drop it.
“Want to take a little break, Tony?” Ty asks, walking towards Tony. He has that look on his face. The same one that he had last Saturday, when he gave Tony a dark hickey high enough up on his neck that he’s had to button his shirt up all the way since.
He’s close to Ty, now, but he doesn’t want to move away. Ty’s already smiling, easily, like he’s won. No need to give him anything more. This is fine. Tony can handle this.
And he can’t route a simple comms device.
“It seems like you don’t understand exactly how this goes,” Ty says. He’s losing control now. Tony can tell. He’s angry. “Here’s our arrangement. You do what I say. I say jump, and you say how high. You don’t talk back, and you don’t say no, got it?” he says.
good reason to keep you around, but I hardly think Captain America, or Director Fury, would want you for that.” He laughs again, leans over Tony.
Tony swallows. “This is potentially—definitely, this is definitely not what it looks like,” he says quickly, because Steve is staring. And it would be just like Ty to take this situation and turn it into something that it isn’t at all.
Tony raises his eyebrows, unimpressed. “Duh,” he says. “Unhelpful.” He sips his coffee.
But he can’t. At first he thinks it’s because of the nickname. He looks up lists of Tony’s exes, some Cosmo article titled
He’s lost his head. He just can’t
Usually, he wouldn’t bother to do it all up on pen and paper. He’s able to work out flawless designs in his mind just fine. But after the debacle with the comms device, he figures it’s best, for now, to have things written out. He doesn’t want to make any mistakes.
Jarvis isn’t pleased, either, Tony knows, but he doesn’t do anything. Three days ago, the first time Ty told Jarvis to do something—
“That’s idiotic,” Tony says, before his brain catches up to his mouth.
“A scuffle?” Steve asks. He straightens almost without realizing it. Goes into Captain-America mode, as Bucky would say, if Bucky were here. “Did you get into a fight? Who’d you run into?” He’s pretty sure there aren’t any big players on the streets right now—it’s not like Tony ran into Loki, or anything—but he could have run into some lower-level goon, someone who’d gotten their hands on some tech they shouldn’t, or something. Maybe the gala tonight had been a cover mission? Fury would have briefed Steve on any of that.
“I’m good,” he says. “Or—clearly, this isn’t my finest, but overall.”
He’ll just have to not look at Tony, and then they don’t have to acknowledge each other’s presences. That’s fine. He can do that.
“Let it go, Cap. It’s not a big deal," he says, and starts to make himself a cup of coffee. "What the hell is going on with the coffee machine?” he asks, to change the subject, but also because someone has fucked with it. His coffee machine. The buttons are sticking, and it looks like someone tried to unscrew the back off, unsuccessfully. With their fingernails, or something. Had Wolverine come into the apartment in the middle of the night?
The elevator—the fastest one in the world, as Tony reminds the team incessantly—is moving like an elephant. Steve half has a mind to pry the doors open and climb to wherever Tony is, but it’s a stupid thought. The doors open and he runs out.
problem. “I need you to help me here.”
When Ty leaves, Tony goes to the elevator.
Sure enough, Tony laughs. Or. Does something that’s a cousin of a laugh, except it’s thick with hurt and Steve’s heart clenches.
is. He figured it would be easy—Google exists, after all, even if he isn’t very good at it, and Tony’s famous. There should be a play-by-play breakdown of their relationship. Which is invasive and gross, but worth it if he can find Ty and make sure he never gets near Tony again.
He’s a supersoldier. A force of nature. Captain fucking America. Tony is a drunk asshole on the wrong side of forty who’s had two embarrassing breakdowns in front of him in the span of two days. Steve doesn’t owe him anything, and definitely isn’t interested in him.
Tony goes to make some coffee. Fills the machine enough for the two of them.
It doesn’t matter, Ty’s hand doesn’t fucking matter, because yesterday, he got a report from Fury that Steve, Clint, and Nat were in Paris doing some spy work and their comms had gone down, just a blip while Nat was in the basement of some hideout, but—it shouldn’t have happened. She could have gotten hurt, something could have happened. Tony should have been done with this days ago, and then they would have been using it instead of the older tech and it wouldn’t have happened. So Ty’s hand really doesn’t matter.
done, why should he be killed for one he hasn’t?
The coffee machine dings. He pours himself a cup and turns to leave.
“Yep. Sounds good,” Tony says, and hopes he knows what he’s just agreed to. “So, what’s this going to be, I have to work with a team from Viastone?”
“No,” he says mournfully. “Just want coffee. S’ hard.”
“You sure were in a rush,” he says lazily. He leans back against the wall. Tony goes to press the ground floor button. “Oh, press the button for the third floor, too,” he says. Tony presses it without thinking. Nearly curses. Sticks his hands in his pockets.
Well. That makes sense. S.H.I.E.L.D. often has to do apology events and fundraisers for this kind of thing, since people thinks it’s
This time, he does stand. Bright, black spots creep over his vision for a minute and he blinks, clears them. This is fine. He can handle this. He walks to the kitchen and Steve trails behind him, because of course. Freaking golden retriever. Tony wants to hate him, but he can’t.
Yes. He remembers that. And he needs Steve to stop talking. But, more importantly: he needs coffee. Of course he was the one who unscrewed it. It seems to be working fine, regardless. He’ll fix it up later, but for now he presses the button and listens to the comforting sound of it warming up. Blinks away the darkness that keeps creeping into the edges of his vision.
The stars are a brilliant white light amidst the darkness of the sky, and Tony would never want to do anything to put out that light.
…or he could call one of his suits and be back in Manhattan in less than an hour.
movie (he didn’t care what Steve said about them because they were cinematic masterpieces), and he was even more pissed that the Fantastic Four were off exploring in another dimension, but all of the trouble was worth seeing a sweaty, half-naked Steve standing amidst the rubble in Hell’s Kitchen.
Steve’s knee almost knocks against the gear-shift before his date suggests they move to the bed of the truck, and Steve then proceeds to spend a good four minutes fumbling with the zipper of his date’s pants.  Steve’s date is more experienced, though not by much.
“Why are we here?” Tony asks, but Pepper just smiles and ducks out of the elevator before he can stop her. “Pepper. Pep!” he calls out, stumbling after her. “Pepper, wait, what are you doing?  Stop!  Just hang on a second—whatever you’ve got in your head—just
“Is it working?” Steve asked.
Tony should be ecstatic.  He should be running back to Steve's room, not standing in a puddle of coffee in the middle of a hospital cafeteria.  He can't formulate any words, and moving his body seems to be even more difficult.  Instead, he just drops into the nearest chair and puts his head in his hands.

because he’s missed this–missed
"Hey, no, don’t work yourself up over it,” Steve reassures. “It’s just a stupid magazine, right?  They live off of stupid rumors like this.”  He scratches his throat and quietly adds: “It isn’t like any of it is true."
They lay there for a few moments, catching their breath, before Tony tangled his fingers in Steve’s hair. “I love you too, beloved,” Tony murmured against his lips before kissing him lazily.
“Julia is a very sweet girl,” Clint defended. “And she’s twenty-two!  You know that you aren’t

“You love me,” Tony says.
has been trying to woo me over the past two weeks,” Tony counters. “I think all of that pales in comparison.”
“You don’t know?  Did you trip and fall on his dick or something?”
Pepper and Jonathan’s wedding song, so it made sense.
“I’m not still hung up on her.”  Tony wasn’t sure why he felt compelled to say that, because it had been
not to see that.
“I’m glad neither of us is a girl,” Tony muses, gently rocking ‘James’ in his arms to get it to stop crying (the name was retaliation for Rhodey and Bucky’s incessant teasing the day they were assigned the project).
"How was it in any way idiotic?" Steve asks, his voice rising. "You're seriously running away now because I told you ‘I love you?’  Honestly, what were you even expecting to get out of this relationship?”
“No,” Sam replied, “but when you guys aren’t speaking after being attached at the hip for two months, it’s pretty obvious that something’s up.”
Tony sighed. “I know what you’re going to say, Steve.  You can save yourself the trouble.”
Steve realized (after the third time they slept together), that apart from the sex, it was like they were dating all along.
Steve was vaguely aware of the high-pitched moans that escaped his mouth with every deliberate thrust Tony’s cock inside him, and he might have been more self-conscious of it another time, but all he could think about was how unbelievable it all felt.  His hands roamed over Tony’s back and down the corded muscle of his arms before settling on the sheets.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t know.  What if—”
“Do I
supposed to be the snarky one.”
“No?”
For a brief moment, Natasha actually looks taken aback by his demand, but she quickly makes her expression passive again.  She turns and beckons for Tony to follow as she walks towards the elevator.  Tony picks his suitcase off the ground and hurries after her.
"I think could be swayed."

Steve nodded. “Good as new.”

“So talking about cock rings over dinner is appropriate?” Tony countered.
For the first time in years, Natasha is genuinely confused.  She knows Steve, and he isn’t the type for late night trysts in hotels, even if these kinds of parties aren’t his thing.  Maybe she doesn’t know Steve as well as she thinks.
“You okay?” Tony asked, his voice laced with concern.
Steve picks up a towel and starts drying the dishes in the rack. “I don’t understand why you of all people won’t just buy a dishwasher.”
In the three years that Steve’s been awake in this new world, he’s seen Tony run headfirst into every situation.  Even three months ago, when the team was preparing to battle Ultron with no idea if any of them would even make it out, Tony had this fortitude that Steve admired.
Tony didn’t realize he had dozed off until he came awake when a warm, damp towel came into contact with his stomach.  He opened his eyes and saw Steve cleaning up the mess on his body. “Thanks,” Tony mumbled.
time for you to get out there…”
Steve quirked an eyebrow at the astonished look on Tony’s face. “What?”
“Is that what you thought?” Steve asked faintly, brow furrowed and confused. His fingers spread over the dry bark and absently picked at the chipped edges.  He spun around to try to meet Tony’s gaze, but Tony’s eyes were fixated on the dampening ground.  “Tony, is that what you really think of me?”  I wouldn’t break up with anyone like that, especially you! I
Tony looked at him strangely. “What are you doing?”
He turns to Sam. “I want to thank you.”
“He went out for a run,” Clint answered. “Should be back any minute now.”

“If you’re interested,” Steve said, sounding a little unsure.

Tony knew it was a little twisted, so he refrained from voicing that particular thought to Steve.
Tony sheds his suit, puts on a ratty pair of jeans, and brews a fresh pot of coffee from the blend of dark roast beans that Carol had given him for Christmas.
Tony shot upright, twisting out of Steve’s hold to look at him.  “What?”
“Then call me ‘Rumiko.’  It’s only fair,” she said with a smile.  She sat down at a nearby table and beckoned Tony to sit next to her. “Why don’t you tell me about him?”
Clint fidgeted with his shirt collar. “Why are we here again?”
Steve rolls his eyes. “They did offer to help.”
“It could still happen, Tony.  I’m an easy target.  I’ve had my fair share of kidnappings when I was a kid,” Steve said, surprising Tony. He remembered Steve saying something about getting kidnapped once, but
"I don't think we should see each other anymore.  We shouldn't have... this was a bad idea from the start."
Tony talks about how much he thought of Steve throughout the day (all day) and how much he misses him when they’re apart (a
to not find you attractive.  But no, I never planned on this.”
Steve is lying on the bed, completely still aside from the steady rise and fall of his chest, and hooked up to numerous machines.  Tony wonders if Natasha’s been here by herself, but there’s a stack of magazines and a number of empty coffee cups on the side table, so someone else must have stopped in too.
Tony put his hand up to shush him. “Just hear me out, Steve.  Can you really tell me that you’re performing to your true potential?”
A smile tugs on the corner of Steve’s lips. “You have to admit that it usually still results in some sort of screaming though.”
“Yeah.” Tony put his food down. “Wait, are you telling me you couldn’t tell she was flirting with you?”
“Well, I lied,” Tony says, refusing to look Steve in the eye.  “You should know when not to take me seriously.”  Tony looks back when Steve doesn’t say anything after a full minute.  He frowns when he realizes Steve is trying not to laughing. “This isn’t funny,” Tony whines. “Laughing isn’t a very appropriate way to respond to someone who just told you they want to
?” Tony exclaims, feigning shock. “Is the ending?”
Steve looked like… well, a proud
“Like you?”
“Are you in love him?”
“My shield is a part of me too.”
“Speaking of work, what did you tell the team?” Tony asked.  Steve only arrived in California earlier that evening, but Tony left New York two days before him in order to avoid suspicion from the rest of their teammates.
“So you three
Steve groans the moment Tony’s hands make contact with his shoulders.
Peggy looks at him quizzically. “You know, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked that question.”
“Good morning, Tony,” Bruce greeted from where he was seated at the counter. “How was the benefit?”
Tony eagerly takes the cupcake  from Steve’s hand and kisses him square on the mouth. “Have I mentioned that I love you?” he says before taking a bite out of the sugary confection.
Thor waves him off. “Asgardian mead is a fine drink,” he says jovially, “Its intoxicating effect is merely an additional draw.” His smile widens as he pushes a stein into Steve’s hands. “Drink! You will see.”
“Why did you

“You’re exaggerating.”
No, Tony wasn’t the egotistic, selfish asshole that Steve initially made him out to be.  In fact, Tony turned out to be quite the opposite.

“Did everything come out okay?” their waitress—

had me, love.”
“We love each other,” Steve said, desperation evident in his tone.  “Isn’t that enough reason to stay together?”
Steve gave him an incredulous look. “You mean the first twenty-eight years of my life?”
“So you two went away to Paris, slept together, and now you’re back and Steve is just… not interested?” Rhodey asked. “What exactly did he say about the situation?”
“Thor and Jane already went down to the hotel gift shop for some provisions.”
So Pepper personally escorts Tony to the restaurant situated just two blocks away from the tower.  Pepper is the one that inquiries about the reservation to the maitre d.  And Pepper is the one that guides him through the large dining area to the smaller, secluded corner in the back of the room.
, and wasn’t that a scary thought?
“Oh.” Steve looked down at his lap. “How is he?”
“Well, it’s not my fault you chickened out every other day this week,” Tony counters.
“What?  Of course, I am,” Tony insists.
“JARVIS, when was the last time I went out on a date?” Tony asked as he lathered his hair with shampoo.  It was getting a little long; maybe it was time for a cut.
“I just—” Tony’s breath hitched when Steve slotted a leg between his, “I want to show my appreciation for our lovely date,” he insisted. “To thank you for taking me on the best first date I’ve ever had—”
“That’s fair.” Tony made himself more comfortable, leaning against Steve’s side. “J, put on whatever is next on Steve’s Netflix queue, would you?”
“You seem to be doing just fine,” Tony said, echoing his statement two months ago, when this whole mess had started.
“You’ve been acting weird all week."
“He’s talking about the fact that you two have been doing an awful job at hiding your little secret,” Natasha supplied.
Tony extended his hand, a playful smile on his lips. “Dance with me.”
Pepper smiled.
“What can I say?” Tony says through a mouthful of chocolate cake. “It’s my superpower.”  Tony can feel Steve watching him unwrap another cupcake, but he can’t find it in himself to care.
“Of course I remember it.  I got the

Steve barely has enough time to slip the ring on his finger before Tony wraps his arms around his neck and kisses him senseless.

“Mm… happy,” Steve says, words slurring together a bit.  He sounds much too chipper for someone who almost died not 24-hours ago.
The future was… well, different.

There were so many details in the photo that Steve could have fixated on: everyone’s smiles, Peggy’s hand on his arm, the Cuban cigar balanced between Dum Dum’s fingers, the obvious closeness they all shared…
“It’s like he’s trying to
“I know, and I don't expect you to forgive me for that anytime soon, but you know I had to do it.  We both have responsibilities,” Tony says to him.  “You’re not gonna be able to be here for every little thing.”
“Vacation,” he clarifies. “When was the last time we had any time to ourselves that wasn’t rudely interrupted by a supervillain trying their hand at world domination again?”
Prompt for 12 Days of Stony: "first."
He tells himself not to read too much into it.
As a child, he spent winters in bed, swaddled in every blanket in his family’s apartment as the other kids on the block played outside in the snow.  His teenage years weren’t all that different except that he had Bucky to keep him company.
Prompt: Steve falls asleep in the workshop when he's stressed out.
“Thank JARVIS.” Steve rests his hip against the counter.  “He’s the one who alerted me.  I just did what any decent person would do.”
And when Steve got to the hotel—in his
“No, I mean, for… what you did earlier,” Tony clarifies. “I know you think it’s nothing, but I really do appreciate it.”
“It won’t,” Steve assured. “It won’t, I promise.”
“Nothing.”
“You’re getting dinner with Natasha?”
“So you’ve been dating Steve for a while now, huh?” Bucky says with a gaze so intense that it takes all of Tony’s willpower not to fidget.
“And I would still follow you.  I’d follow you
“Are you—”
“When?  Were you going to tell me 3 years from now with a wedding invitation?”  Rhodey grabs the remote and unmutes the television.
“You’re a
“We had Logan check them,” Steve says over his paper.
“Hilarious,” Hill said absentmindedly as she began picking at the bowl of chocolate chips on the counter. “Damn, these are good.”
“‘Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.’” Steve laughed bitterly, “Pulled us apart like cotton candy.”
Steve’s face turns even redder than before. “Um… open it and find out?” he offers lamely.
Steve had gently pried the glass from Tony’s hand before enveloping the man in his arms, letting him cry into his shirt.
Tony suddenly felt suffocated—the air in the room too thick and difficult to breathe in.  He looked away from Steve’s gaze, busying himself with putting away his tools.
Of course, he was still tied to a chair, and he wasn’t a particularly huge fan of the gun being pointed at his head, but luckily, the entire situation was over within another few hours.
Steve hated his friends; it was
“Oh, I haven’t yet,” Tony replied, voice thick with want. He could do this: push the hurt and fear aside and just remember what it was like to feel Steve.

“To family,” the others chorused as they raised their glasses.
“He’s worth it,” Tony said again.  He’d say it a thousand times because it was true.
“I could have sworn that our Captain and Anthony were courting,” Thor says, clearly puzzled.
“You can’t mean that.”
“Oh, c’mon, Pep,” Tony whined.  In hindsight, he probably should’ve asked Pepper before giving the wedding planner the go-ahead.  “Next thing I know, you’ll be calling that giant bunny I got you for Christmas ‘tacky.’”
Steve thought for a moment before moving off the bed entirely and disappearing into the bathroom.
Natasha nodded. “We’re talking about you and Tony.  This has absolutely nothing to do with the way we work on the field.”
And now it’s been ten years since he’s first met Steve, two years since they’d had a proper conversation, but eleven stars still bearing variations of his name.
the one who said you didn’t want a relationship,” Tony said, accusation dripping from his tone.
“Do you paint as well?” Thor pressed.
He ducks his head and moves toward the cupboard to grab a mug, but Steve stops him.
Of course, Steve’s at the same restaurant with a couple of his teammates, and being the perfect gentleman that he is, stops by and says ‘hello’ before leaving.
Tony kissed him again, slow and sweet. “I promise.”
Steve pressed a kiss to the hollow of Tony’s throat, his shoulders shaking under the strain of staying still so Tony could accommodate his size.
Steve learns what Tony likes and doesn’t like, and he lets Tony fuck him as his hands grip the cotton sheets.
Both of them look up and see a very tense Steve standing at the other side of the kitchen.  Ty immediately backs off, but his hands don’t leave Tony’s body.
“Look, I don’t expect you to say it back,” Steve assures.
, Tony.  All I want–all I
Tony rolls his eyes. “No kidding.”
“I am Iron Man, remember?  The suit and I are
Steve flipped them over in one fluid motion—settling himself between Tony’s legs and supporting his weight on one arm before spitting into his free hand and taking hold of both of their cocks.  Steve began to thrust into his fist, and Tony threw back his head at the incredible friction.
“You’re not a brat,” Steve reproves.
It hurts knowing that this man—this wonderfully brilliant and caring man—honestly believes he doesn’t deserve anything good in his life, regardless of all of the good he’s done on his own already—that he truly doesn’t see his role on the team or his place in it.
“Lady Margaret,” the blonde—
“See?  Even JARVIS agrees with me,” Steve says triumphantly.
Steve peeled Tony’s jeans open, drawing Tony out from beneath his boxers. He glanced up and caught Tony’s gaze as he dragged his thumb around the tip of his cock to the base, rubbing in the rain that made Tony shiver as it hit his rapidly heating skin.
“Okay,” Tony said, nodding. “That’s great.  That’s… good.  Just remember that there’s
“Tony?”  he says, struggling to keep his eyes open.
"Sure, you don’t. It isn’t like it took you over a year to ask Tony out—”
“I don’t care.  We could have sex on the balcony?” Steve suggested. “Or I could give you a blow job and finger you until you come?  We still haven’t tried out that new toy you made for me.  I can fuck you nice and slow, or I can fuck you so hard you won’t be able to sit for a

Tony remembers the easy smile that formed on Steve’s lips as he slowly came awake, and remembers the husky way he whispered “good morning” before kissing Tony so tenderly that all Tony could do was whimper into his mouth as Steve slowly took him apart.

Steve looked genuinely shocked with his response. “Tony—”
Tony looks over Steve’s shoulder towards the deck of the country club, where an army of waiters is putting the finishing touches on what looks like a very lavish party: rearranging place settings, touching up the floral center pieces, and assembling what looked like an enormous cupcake tower on one of the tables towards the back.  There’s even a sixteen-piece jazz orchestra setting up on the stage.

Tony loves it when Steve gets desperate.  He’s always a considerate lover—always making sure that Tony comes before he does—and Tony loves it, but Tony also loves driving Steve crazy.
Steve shrugged. “Not interested,” he said, feeling no need to elaborate—he already told Tony about his missed date with Peggy.
Tony wasted no time in stripping down and stepping into the shower that JARVIS had prepared for him.  He didn’t realize how much he had been working lately until he felt his muscles start to relax under the hot water.
“What’s this?” Tony asks one evening, picking up the tray of homemade cookies on the counter.
“Steve.”
“Sounds fair,” Natasha says approvingly.
“Maybe it is that simple,” Rumiko countered. “Maybe you’re just overcomplicating things.” Tony desperately wished that were the truth. “I’m sorry if I ruined your night,” he said sincerely.
“That’s not the—
Steve’s hands cupped his ass and pulled him closer, and Tony groaned into Steve’s mouth at the sudden friction.  Steve took the opportunity to deepen the kiss, his tongue plunging into Tony’s mouth and leaving him a writhing, wanton mess on Steve’s lap.  They quickly helped rid each other of their robes, discarding the offending material on the floor.  Tony grabbed hold of Steve’s wrists, pinning them to the bed as he kissed his way from Steve’s jawline to his neck.

Steve blushes. “Shut up, Tony.”
of this was a good idea?  Of course he wouldn’t want me.  I’m such an idiot—”
Bruce makes the discovery when he goes down to Tony’s lab to go over the results of a few experiments he’s finished recently.  He senses that something is off the moment he steps out of the elevator: the lights in the lab are turned down low, and the accompanying silence is actually

It doesn’t take long for the drawer in Steve’s bedside table to fill up with these various pieces of paper, and when Tony goes away on business trips, Steve spends his nights re-reading each one.
With JARVIS’ help, Steve does some digging.  It’s strange, after all, that someone as loud and show-offish as Tony Stark could be so easily embarrassed by a little bit of PDA.  He finds story after story of Tony, and realizes that while the man has photos upon
But one morning, a picture of them walking out of a restaurant together makes the front page of all of the papers, and the morning talk shows can’t get enough of Iron Man and Captain America’s secret love affair.
Clint rolled his eyes. “Well, maybe you’d be able to contribute more to the effort if you weren’t so busy batting your eyelashes at Wilson all the time.”
He could remember weekly trips to Las Vegas or Monte Carlo; remember partying with other people with way more money than any of them knew what to do with; remember going to events with good-looking people on his arm, and can
He looked down at the man in his arms. “Has it really been that long?”
“Apologize?” Tony repeats. “What for?”
“Do the King and Queen approve of your relationship?"
Nope, they’re still there.
“It just is.”
“I know,” Steve answered. “I know that, I just—”
“I saw some footage of you in the news,” Tony says, gesturing towards the muted television.  “How’d you manage to get your hands on a pack?”
Sam cocked his head. “I thought you guys slept together all the time?”
“You’re my friend.”
“I’ll see you all at brunch tomorrow,” he added before turning on his heel.
Tony gave an exasperated sigh. “Look, I’m not going to say I don’t miss going out and meeting new people.  I do.
"What’s this?" Tony asks one evening, picking up the tray of homemade cookies on the counter.
“I told you he’d notice,” Bruce said to Thor, who took out his wallet and handed over a ten dollar
Steve’s first time happens in a pick-up truck.
Tony’s positive the man was a ninja in some past life.
“I know that, but there’s still this tiny part of me that refuses to believe it,” Tony explained. “I mean, just a few years ago, I didn’t think I’d actually become
“N-no,” Tony gasped out when Steve sucked on the head again.  Tony stilled, thumbs shifting down to press against Steve’s cheeks, seeking the shape of his own cock in the other’s mouth. He licked his lips. “No, I wanna… I wanna do this together.”
“That’s probably smart,” Tony agreed. “What about Sam and Thor?”
“Of course, I’m okay,” he answered. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Why is this my life?” Tony whines after Joseph leaves the room. “I just

“Hey!” Tony says indignantly. “I may be a mess, but at least I’m a hot mess.”

Steve nodded, rolling his shoulders and looking anywhere that wasn’t Tony. “You weren’t exactly welcoming when I got back,” he admitted, a bit spitefully.
“It isn’t—”
“This is
“It was a Nazi plane and there were bombs,” Steve said indignantly. “I had no time and there was nowhere to land.”
“Right.  Of course,” Steve replied, keeping his voice as level as possible.  It was now painfully obvious that Tony didn’t want anything more from him, and in fairness, Steve couldn’t blame him.  Steve wasn’t like any of the people that Tony had ever been involved with: he wasn’t a genius, he wasn’t sophisticated or suave and could barely string three words together under the spotlight.  He hadn’t even been in the future three years—what would Tony ever want with an old relic like him?
“Oh, come
“Well… yeah?” Steve says, unsure now. “We’re teammates right?  And I… I’d like to think we’re friends.  You don’t willingly have week-long movie marathons with people that aren’t your friends.”
“The frosting to cake ratio on a cupcake is so much more ideal,” Tony explains, licking chocolate off of his fingers. “Besides, eating a dozen of these makes you feel slightly less guilty than eating a whole cake.”
“Washed up ashore, a mile from the Triskelion.  We found him right after the last helicarrier went down.”
“I know you now,” Tony said matter-of-factly, “and I’ve known you better than most for the past nine and a half years.  I know that I meant it then and I mean it now.  I always will.”
Tony spared him a thoughtful glance before resuming his work.  “Dummy insisted.”
He considers making his presence known, but ultimately decides against it for two reasons:
Tony looked at him dubiously. “She was what?”
“I have no regrets about you being my first,” Tony says, truthfully, “Even if you
“I love you,” Tony says again. “I’ll love you even more if you give me the rest.”
“It’s
When Steve woke up seventy years in the future, he realized he had missed out on an entire lifetime. Yes, it was unfortunate, but Steve made peace with it—he never expected to get to where he was without paying some sort of price.
Steve sets his background to a candid of a half-naked Tony in retaliation.
“So all those times you said you were going to the library or to some engineering society thing?  That new cell phone you got, your new laptop,

Yes, the break-up had been painful, but Tony knew when to let go.  He wanted Pepper to be happy, and if he couldn’t give her that, then he wanted to give her the freedom to find it.
“I didn’t ask you to do any of those things,” Tony shoots back.
But that doesn’t stop him from trying.  He continues having sex.  A lot of sex, really, but contrary to popular belief, he

Pepper sighed. “Can’t you be serious for once, Tony?”
“Just let me wallow in self-pity for another minute longer, Sam.”  Steve knew he looked absolutely pitiful sprawled on his couch wearing a worn t-shirt and sweatpants, but he hadn’t had much motivation to leave his suite as of late.  He figured the stubble on his face didn’t help his appearance much either. “Whatever happened to knocking?”
It’s another three months before Tony gets another certificate, and if he was baffled the last time, then he has absolutely no idea what to make of this one:
Steve would never cease to being amazed by how easy it was to lose himself in the other man.  The softest of kisses could make his head spin—the lightest of touches enough to drive him over the edge.
“I don’t trust a guy without a dark side,” Tony coolly replied as picked up an ax.  Steve looked thoroughly unimpressed—they both knew what Tony really meant. “Call me old-fashioned, I guess.”  He brought his tool down onto the closest slab of wood, and resisted the urge to whine when he barely made a dent in it.
Tony amusedly watches the agent scurry away before turning back to Steve.  “Have I ever told you how much I love it when you use your Captain voice?”
Steve froze, glancing at Tony before looking back at Vanessa. “

“What if I were to convince you?” Steve proposed.
Steve slammed into him one last time and bottomed out, shouting Tony’s name as he spent himself inside of Tony’s body.  He pumped Tony’s cock a few more times, circling his hips until Tony came again, his vision whiting out.
"He needs to,” Bruce adds, surveying the monitors around the room. “The Avengers need him.  Hell, the

“It probably would’ve taken a lot longer for us to finally get our heads out of our asses.”
“Fine?”
—and sure, it’s a little disappointing (Steve won’t deny that), but the last thing he wants to do is scare Tony off.
“I’ll do you one better,” Steve quipped before surging forward.
Tony’s situated at his work bench, fine tuning something in one of the gauntlets of the Mark XLV.  His hair is in disarray, there’s a bandaid on cheek, and a dark smudge on his right arm.  The man looks up and peers at Steve through his safety goggles (which are so scratched that Steve’s surprised the man can see through them at all anymore) and he smiles, and Steve immediately feels like all of the tension leaves his body.
