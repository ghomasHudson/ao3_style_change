Tony lay down, still in his jeans and pulled Steve tight against his chest, pulling the blanket up over top of them.
What she said was absolutely ridiculous, it was only late October-- there was no way she could know what the flights would be like during Christmas, but Steve wasn't stupid, he understood what she wanted.
"So you just wrapped up your damn war wound, walked to the apartment, got dressed, then walked here all because you didn't want to call us an cancel so we wouldn't think you're a bummer?" Bucky asked and Steve just shrugged again. He hadn't been allowed to do stuff like that as a child: complain. His parents had always told him to suck it up, which is why when he broke his right pinkie he had never gotten it fixed and so it stuck out a little from the rest of his fingers. Steve really hadn't been allowed to show any emotion while growing up other than just complacency. Whenever he got too happy his mother would tell him that he must be sinning, and when he got sad she told him that God was punishing him.
After pumping his first finger in and out a few times, Tony inserted his middle finger alongside it and Steve made a surprised noise at the feeling of two fingers. Soon enough Tony found Steve's prostate and the man made another unintentional, but incredibly erotic noise.
"Hey Buck." Steve said, his voice groggy and full of sleep. He moved so that he was sitting up on the bed, but then winced in pain when he suddenly put weight on his still slightly tender backside.
Tony looked like he was knocked out of a daze and he looked at Steve blankly for a moment before realizing he'd been asked a question. "Wedding?" He'd heard Steve mention on the phone. "Yeah, where is it? What will airfare be?"
Tony held his other hand above Steve's hip for a moment, contemplating, before giving him a slightly gentle slap. That garnered almost no response, so Tony tried a little bit harder and Steve's hips canted down harshly against his fingers. It was still light enough to where there was barely even a red mark left behind, so Tony drew the palm of his hand back a little bit further, and hit Steve just below full force, the sound of the smack resonated throughout the room. Steve
"Just, I don't know, what you'd usually say? Call me names?" Steve asked, his voice strained simply because he didn't really know what he was talking about.
"Steve?!" Tony called, his voice dripping with worry as he found him in the bathroom collapsed around the toilet. "Oh
A man opened the door who Tony kind of recognized, but all the lights were on in the apartment and the roommate obviously wasn't alone.
"I'm doing this as a fourth finger on the d string." Bucky pointed to a high note in the music. "And no, I'm your best friend and you haven't been very talkative lately."
"What's up? You look sad." Bucky commented while Steve flipped through the chairing audition material for the hundredth time. Auditions were in just over a month now and Steve was starting to get confident.
Tony ran a hand up Steve's cock, giving it a few pumps. Steve seemed on edge, like he was close, so Tony withdrew his fingers. Steve let out a whine at the loss but was soon staring at Tony as he hooked the cock ring around Steve's cock and testicles.
"Broke a string on my cello and it shot back and cut my hand." Steve admitted as Tony pushed the door to the bathroom open. It was, thankfully empty for now.
had actually been kind of nice to him. Loki usually barely even so much as looked at him, nonetheless actually have a conversation. Steve actually kind of had a smile on his face about the fact. Loki had given him plenty of time to heal up and still get some extra practicing in. Maybe his horrible injury was kismet--it so totally wasn't, but at least Steve could try and make the best out of a bad situation.
Tony put an easy arm around Steve's waist, pulling him close against his side on the busy New York sidewalks. Steve didn't know where they were going, but Tony seemed to have a destination in mind.
." Tony argued, but he knew it was probably going to be in vain. The truth was he did want to do more, he hadn't even gotten off earlier.
Tony stared at him for a moment. "Not good? Like it makes you sick?" He questioned and Steve wondered why,
." Tony emphasized the word and when Steve looked back he hadn't even noticed that Tony had set to work as he literally couldn't feel his whole arm.
He could tell that Tony was walking, and then opening and closing a door, and Steve wondered if he was locking himself in his office so they could talk more privately.
"Remember, no playing for more than an hour. If your hand starts to hurt then just wrap it up, don't fuck it up more than it already is." Tony shifted the car into drive and rested a firm hand on Steve's thigh.
“Yeah, you should have.” It’s supposed to be spiteful, but the words from Tony are exhausted. How many times had he asked Steve to just
Tony is choking on his own blood. It coats the back of his throat, hot, thick, foul. He tastes vomit as it burns up his esophagus, mingling with the blood, and he takes a strangled breath. Worst of all is the pain in his chest, the red-hot pain that eclipses almost everything else. When the shield had struck his chest – Captain America’s shield, his
? Tony’s teeth grit together, blood seeping between them, staining white teeth – teeth he took such good care of – pink. One molar feels particularly loose as his tongue rubs against it, and though it should be the least of his worries, he can’t help but feel anger. The shield had crashed into the left side of his head, and then the right, and then the left – over and over again, his broken nose swelling against the HUD, ears ringing, and Steve Rogers had knocked one of his teeth loose.
“I have nothing to say to you – well, actually, I guess I do. Fuck you, Rogers. Do you know how much more difficult you’ve made my life? Why couldn’t you just leave them there? Ross thinks I had a hand in it – and maybe I did, because I’m talking to you now, aren’t I? I should give him this phone. Let them find you and throw you in a prison for life.”
Goosebumps rise on Tony’s skin in the wake of Steve’s touch, his fingertips brushing over the small of his back.
“Tony…” Steve’s fingers brush over the sharp edge of his cheekbone, and Tony wants to fold into the touch – wants to fall on his knees and let Steve catch him.
Tony’s teeth grit together, and he looks away from Steve, his cheeks flushed. “C’mon Steve, it’s been five years.”
“Poignant,” Tony nods, and apparently Red Skull isn’t a fan of sarcasm, because red lips are drawn back into a grimace.
People come to visit them, and once Steve hears how hard and deep Tony laughs when Rhodey stops by and cracks a joke, he makes plans to have someone visit them weekly. Tony and Natasha in particular seem to have productive discussions, though Tony is reserved after she leaves, far away. He’s grieving, Natasha had told Steve quietly in the kitchen. He’s worried that you’ll ask him to leave – that had been a new revelation, one Steve didn’t understand.
“I’ve had five years to think. Whenever you made those withdrawals from the bank, I always went to look for you. Always.”
Steve shivered with the feeling and pushed himself back with urgency, wanting to feel Tony's tongue inside of him. Tony got the message and pointed his tongue, beginning to slowly push into Steve's hole.
out chair Loki so your best chance is second chair and then what's even the point? Then you can't sit next to me
Steve repositioned them so that he was laying back on the couch and Tony was on top of him, in between his legs. "Damn pillow princess, you comfy?" Tony joked and leaned down to bite at Steve's jawline.
Steve held the wash cloth as Tony left and felt tears well up in his eyes. He shook harshly and his breaths were fast, too fast. He tried to sit up but he collapsed back against the couch cushions, fear coursed through his veins as he realized he couldn't get up. "Tony?" He called, his voice pathetic and wet.
Steve had a new sense of self after last night. He wasn't turning white and getting nauseous at just the thought of what they'd done. Nothing that could make him feel
"No, no, just trying to pick up odd jobs here and there to supplement my income." He said and Tony nodded, gazing glassy eyed into the street.
Steve let out a long sigh. Meeting Thanos' fiancee was very far down on his list of favorable things.
"You have to go? You've barely even been here. Isn't that quite rude? That's quite rude Joseph, wouldn't you say?" She looked towards his father and he nodded in a knowing way but didn't add anything. Steve would say that perhaps he was too filled with rage at the moment to even form words. He would forever be glad that this conversation was happening in public.
The waitress came to take their orders and Steve was glad for the brief moment to think about his answer. He could be straight with Tony and just tell him the truth, but something about that felt too naked. He barely knew Tony.
Out on the sidewalk it was crisp and Steve leaned against the brick wall of the studio for a moment, just reflecting. It had been just a few days since the wedding, he and Tony hadn't gotten the chance to see each other, and Steve had been more focused on rehearsal than actually unpacking what had happened.
"How do you feel about your parents knowing?" Bucky finally asked and Steve faltered for a moment in his steps but then carried on.
His eyes hadn't been playing tricks on him. It was his mother, not to far off was his father, they were both looking at him and Steve quickly looked away. He pretended he was reading music, and when he glanced up again, they weren't looking at him.
participant and he could tell Tony exactly what he wanted, but for now those were still just dreams.
"Well it's just two weeks out now, back home at my moms house. Very informal! If you can't make it it's not a worry I know you must be busy with concert season. It's two Saturday's from now." She rushed out and Steve could tell from the tone in her voice that she was very panicked and she definitely wanted Steve to be at the wedding.
"Can we do a scene again sometime?" Steve asked as Tony pulled the blanket up over them. His phone wasn't plugged in but he didn't really care. He could just charge it when he got to work.
"No." Tony flitted his eyes towards Steve and battled with himself with what to say next. He wanted to discuss what had happened with Steve, he wanted to do that for
"So basically Gamora snapped a string, so she was trying to restring her violin, all the while Valkryie was making these super passive aggressive comments comments. I couldn't hear them, but judging by the look on Wanda's face she was being kind of a bitch. And
He remembered his first date with a boy. He'd contemplated for months on whether or not he should actually go through with it, all while this guy had persistently asked him for a date. Finally, Steve had acquiesced and figured that his family would never find out, it was just one date. He'd really liked the guy too, and he'd been sweet to Steve, a nice reprieve from his family.
"Don't cum yet." Tony warned and Steve didn't respond, just closed his eyes and tried to center his breathing.
"Yeah, yeah I'm sure I could catch a flight out there. If you've still got room for me that is?" Steve really didn't quite have the money for a roundtrip flight and hotel rooms at the moment, but he would scrounge something up for Peggy. At least he didn't have to worry about a suit since he had his concert attire.
he wasn't eliciting the reaction that he had expected. Steve should be writhing on the bed by now, he would have been if this had been Tony's hand. He wondered if maybe Steve just didn't like the paddle, but there was something in how he'd phrased himself that made Tony think that wasn't true. He tapped Steve's shoulder again.
It was painfully quiet again as Steve mindlessly sipped at his water and Tony just kind of stared at the kitchen island. Again Tony mumbled something that Steve really couldn't hear all that well and then Tony was kissing him again, just as sudden and fervid as he had on Friday night.
Steve stared up at him for a moment and then squeezed Bucky's hands. "I know you're here for me Buck, I'm sorry I can be a little obstinate at times. Trust me, if things get too bad I'll be cracking open a bottle of taqui and telling you everything." He said, though realized as he said it that his words implied there was more going on to the situation than just his hand. Bucky seemed pleased that Steve had shared this and gave him one last smile before actual taking off.
"I don't want any of it. Not the-not the biting, I don't like that either. I don't like any of it, just-just normal." Steve was talking a mile a minute as he pressed himself up against the wall, slowly trying to get his breathing under control.
Tony had to help him out of the cab and then Steve had to tell him what apartment was his. "We forgot your keys." Tony said in a sudden moment of panic but Steve just shook his head.
"Worried I'll fuck up your hand even worse? Don't worry, when I was still a fellow the attending doctor I was working under had to go on leave for two weeks, so instead I was under an orthopedic surgeon who specialized in hands. I've never done this surgery before, but it can't be as hard as neurosurgery." Tony joked. The mans confidence made Steve feel oddly at ease, even though this was an absolutely bizarre situation. They didn't talk for a moment again and Tony was obviously put off by the silence, didn't like it, felt like he needed to fill the space. "So, you any good at the cello?"
It was only a little further to Tony's apartment and Steve was still riding so high on the energy of talking to Loki so he strolled into Tony's apartment building with barely a thought and pressed the button for his floor in the elevator. It was a very lavish building, definitely cost a small fortune to live in, at least compared to what Steve was used to.
"Steven. Mrs. Carter mentioned that you'd be here." Sarah said, her shrewd voice giving Steve an immediately headache.
hard for what he had. He and Buck really just had beginner private lessons for a couple months out of the year and that was already kind of difficult. "Feeling better after your terrible cold the Bucky said you had?" Loki asked, sarcasm dripping from his voice, a smirk on his face.
He reached for Tony's hand and placed it on the back of his head. He felt Tony's fingers lace through his hair and Tony got the message. He gripped Steve's hair as tightly as he could and took over the pace.
When Tony walked back in, closer to an hour later, Steve looked incredibly different from when he'd left.
"Romanoff Neurology, this is Pepper, how can I help you?" A voice came over the phone and Steve suddenly felt shame wash over his body. He felt like he was doing something dirty, asking a preppy receptionist to connect him with Tony so that he could ask the man to have sex.
“Secretary Ross and a few lackeys made an unexpected house call. Don’t worry, Cap, I gave as good as I got.”
“It does not matter, Captain Rogers – that life is not the life I have now.” Red Skull steps back, widening his arms invitingly. “Now, I serve as a guide, and a protector. Of the Soul Stone, I suppose that’s why you are both here.”
He feels a large hand on his back, thick fingers sinking into the fabric of his suit, and Steve pulls him back with all of his strength. Tony practically goes flying back into the other man.
“You had a fifty-fifty shot, don’t get too cocky,” Tony mutters, grabbing him by the hand and pulling him inside. “C’mon. Stairs. Up the fucking stairs.”
Pepper had quietly extended an invitation to him as well, but he was, in truth, terrified of Richard Potts. Pepper’s father had never particularly cared for him, and while their break-up had been mostly amiable, he knew that it had not improved his standing in her father’s eyes. So, he had declined that, too.
“It’s aloe,” Steve says in exasperation, squirting more out of the bottle onto his palm. “I burn easily, so I brought it just in case.
“Good,” Steve says as he shrugs out of his shirt, the fabric fluttering to the floor. “That’s what I wanted to happen. I thought it would give you a chance to breathe.”
“Tony,” Steve hisses, grabbing the other man roughly by the upper arm. Tony physically recoils from his touch, and Steve drops his hand away, blue eyes guilty. “C’mon, Tony,” he pleads. “We’re in the middle of the airport. Can’t this wait until we get… Get to where we’re staying?”
“We could spar,” Steve gestures over to the boxing ring a few paces away – Tony imagines Steve building it by himself, in the hopes that someone would one day step into the ring with him. He glances at Steve’s biceps, calculating the amount of pressure he could issue with each punch.
Steve rarely feels jealous, but he always feels a sharp stab of envy whenever Pepper Potts is mentioned – she’s a lovely woman, to be sure, but she’s been allowed to know Tony in ways Steve had never been allowed to.
“It is taking us hours just to get to the top of the cliff,” Steve complains, grabbing Tony’s hand and pulling him to his feet when Tony reaches up and silently requests assistance. “You keep stopping.”
“Hello?” Steve barely manages to say as his hips rock upward, Tony has a talented mouth, maddeningly so.
Tony laughs, bordering on manic. “Are you kidding me, Steve? We’ve barely scratched the surface – hell, you’ve not even read the goddamn thing, and you shot it down.”
“Hey,” Tony’s voice lowers, hand reaching out for Steve’s, but then he pauses and pulls it back to his side of the table. “Yeah, I’m the official whipping boy for the Avengers, but someone’s gotta do it, right? Not like you’ve left me much of a choice."
Their table is cleared in front of them, Tony’s glass of wine is refilled, and he reaches up to undo his tie. Steve’s blue eyes narrow, and his hand falls away from his neck, tie remaining tight.
Steve kisses the back of his hand before letting it go. “You’re welcome, Tony. I hear footsteps, probably your nurse wanting you to get out of bed.”
“We have to keep living, Tony,” Steve moves to his bedside, his hand now resting on Tony’s wrist. Tony pulls his hand away, nausea returning.
It sounds pathetic, worse than that, it sounds… childlike. But, Tony can’t think of an alternative. His world feels sluggish and backwards, and he had nearly lost more than a bolt out of the engine as he had taken it apart – though he would never tell Steve that he had nearly flooded the engine with coolant instead of gasoline – he had mixed the lines up. He needs a decent 8 hours, that’s it – after that, he would be fine for several days without. Natasha keeps texting him, which is annoying –
“Tony, I’m sorry – I’m so sorry, you have to understand. Buck – he’s a part of my life, Tony – I couldn’t let you… I’m sorry. Are you alright? When I called in to Ross’ line, I didn’t know if they would send people fast enough – I wanted to come back, but I had to go – do you understand? I had to, otherwise…”
Wielding all six Infinity Stones should kill Steve Rogers, but it doesn’t. He clings to life desperately, Tony’s words from years ago ringing in his ears as he slumps in the dirt, his own skin burning.
“It doesn’t matter now,” Tony says quietly, looking away from her. “It doesn’t matter – because – because he nearly killed me. And he would have done it, I think, if I hadn’t…”
“You’re okay, Tony,” her face looms over his, shadows under her green eyes. “You’re in a hospital in Berlin.”
“No, I don’t think I can – but…” Tony smiles at him ruefully, pointing his fork at Steve, squash dangling off the tine. “I’m here, aren’t I? Damned either way.”
They stagger into the apartment together, Tony’s legs slipping from Steve’s waist, feet dragging against the floor as he’s barreled forward. Steve has him out of his jacket, and then his trousers, and Tony doesn’t know how the hell he’s undressing him so fast. Steve’s hands slip over the front of his briefs, the same shade of blue as Steve’s eyes (Tony had made that choice rather intentionally) and he gives a pleased hum.
Steve blushes, grinning down at his plate – so, Tony plans on spending the night in a bed with him. Their conversation turns casual as they work on their dinner, they avoid the topic of the Avengers or Bucky, but Tony is eager to hear what Steve had done with his day in Paris.
Sokovia. Ultron. His mistakes. And now, the Avengers are paying for them – though no one seems to realize the severity of the Sokovia Accords. Nobody but Tony.
“No, don’t.” Now it is Steve begging, and there’s a nice change – because Tony had spent the last couple of months begging him to come to his senses, to sign the goddamn Accords and be done with it.
“Bit of a light pour, there, Rogers,” Tony looks at him over the rim of the cup, relaxing as warmth travels down his throat.
“I’m not drunk,” he insists, pulling away from Steve and leading the way out of the restaurant. “Maybe a little tipsy – but not drunk, and I plan on walking it off.”
He turns in Steve’s arms once he’s naked, pressing his lips to his hungrily. Tony’s trembling fingers card through his hair, shifting so that he’s lying on top of Steve, working his sweatpants down his hips.
Steve’s voice is distant, like he’s shouting into one tin can, his voice carried along the string to the other. “Tony, are you there?”
“I’m here, Steve.” He reaches up to probe at the side of his head, now crusty with blood, but no longer actively bleeding.
“You’re here, with me,” Steve supplies, his lips pressing against Tony’s, Tony’s hands slipping from his hair to wrap around him fully. “Here with me,” he repeats, feeling Tony tense as Steve’s hand moves between his thighs.
Tony hums in response, which is better than the usual silence he treats Steve to whenever he says those three words. He presses a kiss to Steve’s lips instead.
Tony laughs, humorless. He slides the ring onto his left ring finger, holding it up against the light of the bedside lamp, examining it. It fits perfectly.
Steve is silent for a moment, and Tony’s phone – his real phone, buzzes in his pocket with an alert. He can’t pull it out, without falling off of the roof, but he hears Steve mutter a curse and makes an educated guess.
“Unless you call a couple decades in the ice a vacation, no.” Steve stares at Tony while he’s got his head bent down, focused on wrapping Steve’s hand. His hair is damp from sweat, curling gently, and that’s new – Steve has only ever really seen Tony impeccably dressed and groomed or bloody and bruised in the middle of a mission.
The days between Christmas and New Years pass in a drunken blur for Tony. Rhodey, at some point in that time span, returns home – and is horrified to see the state that Tony is in. He bandages Tony’s burned hand for him and tries to wheedle out what has gotten Tony to this point, but Tony merely brushes him aside and disappears to his workshop.
“What do you want, Tony?” Steve asks him tiredly, his fingertips red as he pulls his hands away from his face.
Steve breathes in deeply, the hair of Tony’s goatee scratching against taut muscle as Tony kisses and licks his way intently across his chest, and then down his abdomen. Tony’s tongue trails over one well defined abdominal muscle, closing his eyes, his hands grabbing at Steve’s thighs to splay them.
“It has been a very, very, very long time,” Tony mumbles, reaching behind him to grab at Steve, pulling him closer. “I’m not gonna – it’s gonna be quick – God…”
“Have you ever cut hair?” Tony reaches up with his left hand to rub at the shaven side of his head, fingers rising and falling with the bumps of his sutures, the metal plate just under his skin.
Just as Tony feared, there’s a crowd of reporters outside of the impressive glass UN building in which each nation was to ratify the Accords. His hand twitches at his side as he steps out of the car, wanting to shield his eyes from the flash of cameras.
Steve is surprised when Tony pulls him into a quiet cathedral – not as ornate as some of the ones they have passed on their walk. Tony quickly crosses himself with holy water by the door, looking over at Steve with a frown.
Tony pushes himself forward into the counter, the edge of it painful against his hip, and he grabs Steve’s arm and pulls his hand out from under his sweater. Inches away from him, and then feet – another room, as he hurries towards the fireplace.
The pad of his thumb brushes over the words at the bottom of the page. Steven Grant Rogers. The line above the name is blank, unsigned. And then alarms start to blare, deafeningly loud.
“Somewhere warm. By the ocean.” Tony pulls one of Steve’s pillows closer to him, breathing in deeply. With Steve’s voice in his ear and Steve’s blankets around him, it’s almost like the other man is there.
“I ordered for us,” Tony says, his foot knocking against Steve’s under the table. “It’s prix fixe – do you like red wine?”
Steve follows after him out onto the deck, still holding the rapidly cooling plate of breakfast he had made for Tony. It’s cool outside, a breeze coming up off of the ocean, but the pool is heated. Tony stands at the foot of it, rolling his shoulders slowly. Steve reaches behind him, the deck chair giving way against his palm, and he lowers himself down onto it without taking his eyes off of Tony. Tony is still wearing the helmet, which Steve doesn’t understand – but his confusion gives way to surprise as Tony dives into the pool. He has impeccable form, and this display of athleticism is not something Steve had anticipated. Yes, Tony is in shape – in fact, he possesses the exact kind of body Steve had wanted before the serum. Not well defined musculature that required constant upkeep, but a subtle strength that came from hefting a metal suit around.
“You forgot the helmet,” he comments, pointing at the picture of his head. Steve has captured him, though, he’ll inwardly give him that credit. The curve of his jaw is sharp, his eyes are shadowed, and the reactor glints on his chest. Tony squints at the drawing, making out the dog tags on his chest. He reaches up and touches the necklace with a grimace. “Not bad, Rogers.”
Tony turns to face the window again, reaching out to steady himself, cold sweat running down the column of his spine. His heart thumps painfully, he idly wonders if he’s going to give himself a heart attack.
His hand rests against the man’s back, between his shoulder blades, and Tony takes a stuttering breath. His blood is dark on the grey concrete, and it feels tacky against Steve’s palms as he rolls Tony onto his back. There’s grey in his hair, swooping in from the temples – there’s grey in Tony’s beard. Tony’s brown eyes are unfocused as he stares up at Steve, the left side of his face bathed in blood.
He could be holding a bomb, he idly thinks, as he turns the FedEx package over in his hands. It would be a cruel twist of fate, but people are still quite angry at Iron Man and the Avengers. The mess at the airport in Germany definitely didn’t win them any fans. Or, his finger slips under the lip of the padded envelope, it could be anthrax. That wouldn’t be a first for Tony Stark, but he usually has his mail screened. The label on the front of the package hadn’t given him any indication of what’s inside, the letters had been typed, completely impersonal.
) and presses his lips to Steve’s. Steve tenses, and Tony closes his eyes, expecting a punch that’ll take his head off of his shoulders. But then Steve’s arms wrap around him, pulling him closer, until Tony is pressed up flush against him. His lips part against Tony’s, and Tony’s hand bunches in the damp fabric of his tank top. Steve’s tongue is hot, and his body is hard and unyielding against his, and his blood tastes of iron and sweet, sweet satisfaction. Tony wants to kiss him until he can’t breathe, wants to pull him down onto the mat and…
Steve’s large hand rests over his, easing up on the bottle. His warm breath causes the hair on the back of Tony’s neck to stiffen.
Tony gets to his feet, offering Steve his hand to pull him up off the chair. Steve takes it, breathing in deeply at the contact, Tony’s fingers curling around his wrist before he lets go.
“Stark.” A voice, so similar to Obadiah Stane – Tony wildly thinks of activating the gauntlet and blasting Thaddeus Ross’ head off of his shoulders. “You’re late.”
Tony stops them suddenly in front of a set of steps leading up to a quiet apartment building, and he fumbles in his pocket for the keys. They clink together as they hit the stone beneath Tony’s feet.
“Oh, look at that,” Tony gravitates to a particularly impressive looking rock, veined with glowing red. “Look.”
Tony glowers at him, and then decides that consequences be damned, he needs more whiskey. Steve follows him to the kitchen, a pace behind Tony, but the closeness makes his head swim. He’s exhausted – he should have spent the night in Edinburgh, should have made Steve wait another day – oh, to make Captain America squirm and doubt himself. But Tony is too weak to allow himself that sort of empty victory – no, Tony had come running at Steve’s beck and call. Whiskey sloshes over the edge of the glass, Tony blinking down at it in bewilderment, liquid still pouring from the bottle and onto the countertop.
“I don’t know where we go from here, Steve,” Tony’s finger falls away, his hand back at his side. Steve has him up against the wall, there’s enough space for him to squeeze away, but it would be tight. He lets Steve inch closer, lets Steve’s hands skim up his sides.
“You keep threatening to hang up on me,” Steve teases, and he doesn’t have the right to do that – not after the damage he’s inflicted on Tony, both physically and… “I’m serious. Give me a chance to explain, to apologize. I just – need to see you. You don’t have to see me again, afterwards, if you don’t want to – but…”
“It’s definitely going to scar,” Tony worries. “I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, on the one hand, it makes you look rugged. At least it’s not through your eyebrow, or you’d look like a pirate. But on the other hand, before, someone had never, you know, hurt Captain America. It gave you this air of invincibility.”
“You want to go into the aquarium?” Steve jerks his thumb over his shoulder, children squealing in delight as they run ahead of their parents into the building.
“I need to see you, Tony.” There’s movement on Steve’s line, like he’s walking somewhere, somewhere where he can talk without being overheard. “I need to make sure that you’re alright.”
“Turns out,” Tony clears his throat. “That – uh – resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.” He watches Steve’s fingers brush over his forearm slowly, goosebumps rising in the wake of his touch – like they always did. “I missed you,” he manages to say, it takes a lot of effort, and Steve can tell.
Tony pauses as Steve’s lips press against his neck, the bandage wrappers fluttering to the floor as his hand unfurls. His eyes close, doing his best to stay standing – it’s not his fault that Steve had got lucky, had figured him out easily, had placed a kiss on the spot that has always unraveled him. Thoughts of tomorrow’s meeting slip away, thoughts of Steve’s damaged reputation fade.
“Tony, you’ve thrown my angle off,” Steve says in exasperation, reaching down to nudge Tony’s head away.
“You’ll have to hold it,” Tony mumbles, kissing him in the darkness. “I thought you were running out on me.”
The pad of Steve’s thumb brushes over the risen base of the new scar on his chest – five long inches of sutures recently removed. Tony’s heart beats wildly, he wonders if it will beat so fast that the muscle will just tear itself to pieces. Steve’s lips brush below his ear, his breath a sigh.
Steve will introduce himself, offering Tony his hand. Tony will shake it, his fingers brushing along the inside of his wrist.
Steve leans back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. A muscle jumps in his forearm, Tony watches it, his mouth going dry. He forces himself to look into Steve’s eyes, to not get distracted by the almost healed cut on his face – the cut Tony had caused.
“Not joining you til you’re naked,” Steve argues from the bed, rolling onto his back, his hands behind his head.
“108th and Madison,” he grinds out, his voice hoarse. “Christ, Steve, I don’t have any more coins – had to crawl on the ground to get here, God – are you coming? I need you to come Steve, I need you -.”
Tony moves his hands up between them, pushing against Steve’s chest until he lets go. There’s a scowl on his face as he looks around the arrivals terminal.
Steve thinks of the ring box in his right pocket, he bought it shortly after the last time he’d seen Tony in Paris. It had caught his eye in a window as he had walked down the street in search of breakfast – the ring was subtle, a beaten silver band. He had bought it on a whim, imagining it on Tony’s left hand. It’s Tony’s birthday gift, and he’ll give it to him before the other man leaves – but he has to find the right time.
There as the most haunting and yet taunting thing Steve has beheld ever in his life, the head of a suit damage on the ledge of where the front steps to the holiday house once where, now all ghostly images of what once stood here and what it once represented. A home for a family to seek time away from the chaos of the world, the
Swallowing of the bile that hit over his tastebuds, placing the photo back against the base of the lamp. Steve turned off the light, found himself lingering from his sons' bedrooms as if savouring something before retreating up to his rightful place next to his husband whom coiled inwards to Steve's body, he just held onto his husband with the pendulum swing of woe knocking the sleep out of him. He didn't sleep just took in the beautiful sight of his husband's sleeping form, crow's feet from the happiness that has been shown on Tony's face, facial hair that frame his jawline though it wasn't needed for a jawline like his it did draws the eye of any beholder to his plump lips, Steve's fingers tickled from following along the stabled path to barely curve his finger against the back Tony's ear to put it in simple words, Tony is gorgeous. Steve's forehead pressed against that of Tony's, closing his eyes to breath in Tony.
"So, we'll obviously be going to town on each other after we've tinkered with the equations on..." Tony clicked his fingers to prompt his mind. "Revolutionary process to rewrite genetic codes, corrected?" The mechanic knew he was on the right path of the titillation idea of re-programming a human's genetic coding that was something he toyed with the theorem once with and closed that book. "Uh-huh... Yes, to that of furthering my research and we're not at you getting the key to the town," Maya said flatly to the man with a tip of frown on her lips. A shrill of a chuckle almost unheard over the constant chatter and passing by a speaker, the number of people made spaces tighter allowing Tony to step behind her, purposely his hot breath breezed over soft skin exposed from brunette locks tuck behind her ear. "Strictly professional, I can do that," Tony's hand unclasped from her's hand, the decrease of body heat and the tempter of the room contributed to the crisp nip upon her fingertips that traced across bones, causing her to want his touch back even just for warmth, foolishly playing into Tony's trap as she glanced to her now unprotected hand. His head tilted amused by her but it was short-lived from someone daring enough grasp his upper bicep and the sudden collision lurched forwards from his bodyguard have quite literally caught up to him and the choking sounds from the hazard of the party blower, the hand helped to steady him as he felt the other hand on his chest to catch him. Tony coughed a couple of times while removing the horn from his mouth, gaze tennis between the man and the mullet over his shoulder, Maya had pulled a disappearing act. "Sorry to intrude, Mr Stark." Words that belonged to a polite man, a caring doctor.
The much-awaited ding of Tony's floor though there was a hunch floating around in his head that this guy would follow Tony to Maya's room. Slightly irritated by the evenings unfolding events that he didn't count upon had gotten to him, planting the ball of his left foot on the metal threshold of the elevator. Outstretching his arms out to lean on the parted doors, witnessing exactly what he thought would happen, Aldrich unevenly stepped forward right against Tony's chest on reflex Tony planted his hand under Aldrich's elbow to steady the man. Yes, Tony was a world-class dick but not that big of a dick. "Easy there, handsome. Don't need you doing a stupid thing like falling for me." Tony said, a charming grin appeared on his full pinked lips and the stifle of inept laughter from the blonde slightly hunched forward man. "N-" the snort from the laugh. "No-no," stammered Aldrich whom's cheeks that of mirroring red tomato colours, clearly like most have before Aldrich has fallen for the allure of Tony Stark, only he had fallen years ago for someone he at the time never met and here he was in front of the man that he had lusted and sometimes lines blurred over to obsession as Anthony Stark stood for everything he wanted to achieve. "Aw, no need to blush over lil' old me." Tony teased, playfully yet the unnoted snark. "Meet me on the roof after the ball drop as I have to go freshen up." Tony nodded his head slowly, hopes that Aldrich would fall for it, leaning in dangerously close to the other male. "What do you say, handsome?" Tony's breathed caressed over the heated cheeks, cooling them. And maybe it was the heat of the moment or maybe it was the pent-up frustrations from the cat and mouse game he's been playing with Maya, whatever it may be Tony ended up leaning to allow his lips to move at first awkwardly with the other man, no feelings on Tony's part but it was everything on Aldrich's part. Short, sloppy and unrememberable by the time daylight will break over darkness. Drift apart, Tony's blank stare over Aldrich. "See you up there, Tony." Aldrich nodded, plastered smile as if Christmas came early for the man. "You bet," Tony glided back onto the carpet, giving a small wave. That was what he thought would've been the last time he would see Aldrich Killian.
to be vacation.” Fury’s cape billowed behind him in a way Tony found irritatingly over the top. What was the point of wearing a trench coat inside? Together with the leather gloves, the tall boots, and the eyepatch, Fury was moments away from being a pirate. “Of course, he’s not
, Tony,” he said breathlessly, smiling wider and brighter than Tony had ever seen from him. “I—just.
Fury hummed and waited for Fitz to fall in line. Tony give it five minutes, then gave up the pretense of working, sitting back heavily in his chair. He needed a plan. It was an engineering problem, essentially: If he approached this in the wrong way, everything could blow up in his face.
“This is why I don’t go out of my way to make friends,” Tony said. “We aren’t friends.” He got up and stretched, yawning, and trailed Fitz to the coffeemaker on the opposite side of the room. He’d thought it was incredibly inefficient to keep it so far from their actual workstations, but he now appreciated the excuse to stretch.
“I don’t follow.” Steve, to his credit, met Tony’s eyes and didn’t try to preempt the little speech Tony had come up with.
that I figured out that much.” Tony rolled a gear through his fingers, feeling for imperfections. It was slightly warped, which wasn’t a good sign for the other essential pieces in the landing gear for any of the jets.
. “You almost passed the labs. I think Fitz and his gang are in there right now. They can help you get set up. If you have questions, I’d ask them.”
“Shut up and drive,” Tony replied. He climbed on behind Steve, slipped his arms around Steve’s waist, he laughed into Steve’s shoulder when Steve turned the bike on and made a big show out of revving it and speeding down the street. The season had just turned, so the air had a sting to it, that was dulled by Tony’s leather jacket. Steve, it seemed, was a bit of a daredevil, taking corners too quickly, and laughing uproariously every time the bike tipped dangerously too far in either direction.
“I don’t think I can accept this,” Steve said reluctantly, though that didn’t stop him from immediately getting on.
Tony, too, was becoming a regular. He’d never been a regular anywhere before, let alone a place cheap enough to have laminated menu cards and resin tabletops, but there was something charmingly Americana about the whole thing, and the food really was delicious. He wouldn’t have minded walking over just for the onion rings, but the fact that
“A ’42 WLA? Figured,” Tony said. He smiled fondly. “You’re absolutely an apple-pie-and-fireworks all-American man. I thought your kind was extinct.”
“I saved lives,” Tony said, pushing away from his bench. Not because Pepper had told him to, but…partly because Pepper had told him to, and she was usually right about these things. “It’s not my fault it meant knocking down Hammer’s dinky little building, but, hey. I’d argue that that was
Tony cursed and stuck his finger in his mouth. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been so off his game that he’d burned himself while soldering.
Steve’s hand brushes lower, getting a generous handful of Tony’s ass and squeezing, grinning when Tony makes what sounds like a surprised squeak – he’ll tease him about it in the morning.
One morning, Steve steps out onto the front stoop of the apartment, keys to the motorcycle in his hand, and nearly falls down the steps when he sees Tony knelt on the sidewalk. Tony is surrounded by every single part of Steve’s motorcycle, down to the leather seat. His hands are covered in oil, and there’s a nick on his forearm dripping blood, but Tony doesn’t seem to notice. His teeth are grit together, muscles shifting in his forearm as he twists the socket wrench in his hand, and he pumps his fist in quiet victory when a bolt finally comes loose.
Pepper nods, taking the flowers from him to place them in a waiting vase on the table next to Tony’s bed. Her eyes are red from crying.
Tony pauses, digging the nail of his index finger into the muscle just above Steve’s ribs. “No. No, he’s not contacted me since. He’s got god-only-knows how many people out there, looking for you.”
His eyes open, though they struggle for a moment, because honestly – a corpse opening its eyes? It’s bright, there are fluorescent lights above him, and natural light spilling in from a window. He gasps, his throat aching – the telltale sign of a ventilator tube recently removed.
“Happy birthday,” Steve grins at him from across the table, nudging his foot against Tony’s. “Wanted to surprise you.”
It’s raining when Steve steps out into the night, the raindrops heavy and cold against his skin. He takes a shuddering breath, getting his phone out of his pocket.
Vision – well, he had made some sort of weak lie, that he was visiting Europe for the holidays. Tony had nearly choked, laughing with a mouthful of coffee, because Vision sounded nearly the same as he did when he was making excuses to see Steve.
“But I want to talk.” Steve had to tell him now – even if it ruined things between them. Tony had kissed him, had murmured something that sounded awfully like ‘I love you’ against his chest in the darkness – and Steve could no longer keep the truth of the death of his parents from him.
“Okay, thanks, then. Thought you were doing something really fucking weird. Like letting me know that you have a sunburn fetish, or something. I was gonna walk out.”
“Tony,” Steve shifts down so that he’s not looming over the other man, gently stroking the curve of Tony’s jaw with his free hand. “You said it was at your hotel.”
Tony shakes his head, sighing. “Christ, Steve.” He moves over to the balcony, parting the curtains so that he can look down at the street below. “It’s like you don’t hear me.”
There’s a shift in Steve’s expression, a quick flash of betrayed rage, like both Peggy and Bucky Barnes were off limits to Tony.
“How can you say that when you left me for dead in Siberia? Really, Steve, how can those words physically form in your mouth when you know that you were a thought away from beheading me? We both know it.”
He has no idea how Steve is climbing the stairs, carrying him, and kissing him so hard that his toes curl in his shoes – all at once. They really should be tumbling down the stairs, and it’ll be a coin toss as to who breaks their neck. Steve swallows his moans, pressing Tony up against the doorway, the decorative metal numbers of 302 digging between his shoulder blades. Steve’s left hand leaves his skin, keys jingling, and he thrusts it into the lock while Tony gasps against his neck, thankful for a moment to catch his breath.
Tranquillity has befallen over Stark Tower, Steve breathed in the calm atmosphere with every descending step until steps became level on the cooling tiles of the party deck level, really it was that of an overly large spaced out living room that held coziness for the evenings entails from the coloured filled drawings and notes that scattered over the stretched out the coffee table and the strewn of Peter's mask, blankets coiled in scrolls and the mugs tacted with white foam, slightly sour scent of milk infused with lavender, brought a sentimental smile on his lips even if his nose turned up at the smell. Thus gave Steve a task to occupy him physically and mentally relieving him of overthinking about the meeting tomorrow.
Fly over was gut-wrenchingly quieting from the freckled face teen staring blankly, being abnormally quiet until the outburst that came from nowhere from the urgency need to see what is left, see if there is a clue and the dying hope that they could be alive, a strong arm catching him just under his arm from the weight upon his own chest that he had realised that he was sinking to the floor of the jet or that he even stood. Calming words did nothing for his son, Peter. No soothing nor ease, just brought out more waterworks and if Steve didn’t have to be strong for his son then he’d be doing the same thing.
His fingers curled, taut against the laddering of ribs felt through the thin material of Tony's tank top. Never did it cease to amaze Steve how perfectly their bodies fit as one, the crook of his arm resting on his husband's side and neatly his hand tucked between bedding and body. Keep Tony's body as close as possible to his own. His Atlantic blues survey over the relaxed motion of his back muscles moving ever so slightly from breathing in and out snores that softly emit from the parted lips, fondness filled his chest watching how at peace his husband looked in his arms. Steve wouldn't disturb the man's peace, his lips placed a gingerly kiss upon the expose golden skin of Tony's shoulder that brought out an unintelligible hum from the sleeping man, planting of his tongue to hold back the soft laugh at the adorableness of his sleeping husband.
. "Thanks but hate to break it to you, I'm not one for signing autographs," Tony said, bothered toned as he wanted to get upstairs before the ball would drop which is in nineteen minutes, he had time but not the time need to be friendly. Reaching around Killian or Alric or whatever his damn name is not that Tony cared to press the button. Aldrich speaking a hundred miles per minute something about AIM. "Yes, I can see that on your shirt." He said distastefully in the font choice of the man, slipping carefully not to knock the cane into the elevator. Trying to make a getaway went over Aldrich's head.
A smokescreen over the distorted image of himself nearing the end of his twenties. Dawning the end of the midst of his numbing himself with stimulates of that of spirits, no pleasure was there like there once was in his more youthful days. At this point and time it was a desperate attempt to escape from the torturous memories, loneliest in the sea of people all wanting him it was life's cruellest irony and the sleepless nights of the deaths on his hands from the mass destruction of his own creation. The unpolished version that only those who were there in those days know the truth and understand why Tony polishes over them when sharing stories, precaution to not open old wounds for Tony to fall back on. A casted shadow that trailed behind him of those he had wronged, never to bat an eyelash at a second thought of how his un-promised words or unspoken sentiments as he was too plastered to remember what he had for breakfast that day. Yet, remembered every project or theorem he was working on during those days, funny what the mind leaves out. Tony happened to be well-aware he wasn't a good person but who was back in the nineties? No, he can't blame time or anyone but himself for this certain demon.
"Why are you up way past your bedtime, Harls?" He gently prods, sweeping hair out of his face. "Have you been reading H.P Lovecraft again?"
There is a little chuckle from Harley followed by the shake of his head, causing hairs to drape back over his forehead, making Steve repeat the action. "Nah-uh, just can't sleep," Harley replied to Steve, there a tired lag in drawl out words.
From the return of Happy's casting above him before Tony had the chance to look up to his dear friend, cooling sensation of a damp cloth placed upon his forehead though the dabbing motion was that from former pugilistic far from gentle, full of woe. Actually cause a puff out for a miserable attempt at a laugh from Tony. "Here's your water, don't choke on it. I don't need the stress of job hunting," Happy said, flicking over the end of the cloth to rest on top of Tony's head in the same motion different hand, handed Stark the open capped water bottle. Tony took the bottle from Happy, chugging half of the bottle of the refreshing h2o, dragging his knuckles across the corners of his lips to stop the overflow, there was a strange tightness on his left wrist from the barely visible burns of hand marks that would come out more in due time. And fade to nothing, a bit of the true entails of what went down between Aldrich and Tony. "Happy, do you want another photo added to your wall?" Stark prodded the bodyguard who made a distasteful click from his tongue. The wall of Tony; became a reality in the fall of the second year Happy Hogan was his bodyguard, he kept staring and Tony repeated the old phase of take a picture it'll last longer, only instead Tony brought it upon himself and stuck it to the bland office walls of the security staff at Stark Industries, ever since then it has become a silly nostalgic game between the two.
Receiving a phone call, long past the dead of night, never contained that of good news. A one-sided phone conversation of orders for the husbands to be at the Avengers Compound tomorrow by noon that only meant one thing, the next mission. Dread weighed heavily in the silence for Steve; Tony recently started to come to bed at a reasonable time again, not tinkering away into the wee hours from some unforeseen impending doom. Science babble that fills the void of the workshop between Peter and Tony and sometimes Harley, that always goes over Steve's head. The invigorating encouragement that Tony gives to not only their oldest son, Peter who has needed the reassurance since that of the Vulture attack but to their youngest who has a knack for trouble. Everything was going back to normal to have that taken away again was perturbing to Steve.
He fluffs out the blanket, arms extended with the blanket sheeting over his strong frame before hands meet in the middle to fold the blanket in half and repeating until in a manageable size than draping it over the armrest of the leather couch. Lacing his fingers through the loops of the four mugs to collect them together in the middle, heads in the direction of the small kitchen that was hidden behind a section of wall but his feet halted at the eldritch bluish-white glow from deep within the heart of the kitchen, failed attempts of someone trying to keep quiet. Freeing his hands up just in case by placing the mugs quietly upon the shelving before he proceeds cautiously into the kitchen.
The first missile meant to send shockwaves through the structure of the mansion, rattle the metal frame which cement walls clung to and form cracks in the foundation. It had succeeded in that aspect plus the stunning of the occupants within the structure even if adrenaline drowns out the initial shock of the realisation of what is happening made the father scurry sore limbs to draw an invisible line from his nervous system to awaken the autonomous prehensile propulsion suit or Mark XXXIX to encapsulate the most valuable thing in the tumbling structure, his son. Mark XL got blown to smithereens by that of the second impact broke the earthly chains that bound the manmade structure to set it free. Showtime for Mark XLI only to have a shower of bullets from the flying machine above the crack in the ceiling, Tony was without armour on top of crumbling earth, at least his son was protected and out of the rubble raining building, a near-miss of the sofa that aimed for his shins to dive into the briny depths. From overstepping to caught himself, only to step into the secure feeling of metal encompassing his body tightly like that of a hug from a friend, Mark XLII.
Set post-Winter Soldier & Iron Man 2 & Avengers & Spider-Man Homecoming, and pre-Age of Ultron & Civil War.
side notes: tony in 1999 was 29. that aldrich killian actually kills maya after the extremis-enhancement and also the founder and ceo of advanced idea mechanics just like depicted in the movie. not going into detail when tony and steve got together because that's another story for a later date, they have been together since 2012, married in 2013 and harley is technically their biological son {so he's seven} ― not going into science cause another solid oof, peter is their adoptive son (tony adopted in 2010 remember the little guy with the iron man mask cause his aunt passed away at the expo attack) and he is 17-years-old.
"Half an hour 'til ball drop, boss." Happy stated, proudness rung out and Tony was well aware it was more from the small group of people that trailed on Happy's heels for the after-party that would be hosted in Tony's suite. "Ha, Einstein had the audacity to state time is an illusion, flexible and yet here we are running out of time for more entailment on your research." Tony chuckled at the beginning, swiftly did it fade out for words to be uttered out over the blaring, slightly distorted music from the volume and poor base speakers plus the chattering between two to more people didn't assist with the undoing of the justice for
"Uh, it was a one time joke..." Peter said, shrugging his shoulders and took the water from Steve's hand, a thank you through a moment of their eyes meeting. "Inside joke, pops." Harley yawned out, the pale arm dangled down Steve's spine. "Time for sleep, my boys," Steve said, Harley glued to his side, he guides Peter out of the kitchen towards the elevator. Once the doors open, Steve ushered Peter to his bedroom door as Harley had already started to snore and brought a fond warmth to his heart. "Goodnight, Pete," Steve leant his free shoulder against the doorframe. Peter flops face-first onto the bed, faint was the words of Peter, a tad muffled by that of his pillow. The cap still on the water bottle lost amongst that of the tussled sheets. His forearm hoisting up Harley's body from his knee digging into his stomach, lifting the boy's weight up to his ribs causing the boy's head to wedge in the crook of Steve's neck. Few steps to pull one of the disregarded sheets over Peter's body, the smile never left his face it only brightens as Peter snuggles into the sheets. Turns off the lamp on Peter's desk before he exits the room.
trigger warnings : murder insinuated, two times there are fade-outs of what would've been sexual interactions but because it wasn't Steve and Tony - I didn't write about them.
A clear sign that his son was on the verge of falling asleep until the pitter-patter of a light foot, slapped against the slick tiles and tired looking Peter appearing at the threshold of the entry to the kitchen, still rubbing the sleep from his chocolate orbs. "Is this how we're conducting family meetings now? 'Cause I object," Peter said, shuffling forward still in the limbo between awake and asleep, keen blue gazed focused on Peter's unsteady step. "I can assure you this isn't how family meetings will go down, Pete." He spoke in a soft tone, his left arm loops around Harley's middle. Bring his son to his side and he felt the light-weight of his arm draping over the back of his shoulder. "Look Shakey's here," Harley said, pressing his cheek against the fabric of his shirt. "Shakey?" Steve repeated suppressing the laughter as his free hand caught the water bottle on the fly from the powerful swing used by Peter at least the refrigerator door stayed on its hinges.
Since he returned to his hotel suite, Stark had consumed quite an amount of alcohol and little to eat to soak up the alcohol sloshing about at the pit of his stomach, never was he good at dealing with the tragedy that comes from that of death's hands. Venturing out from the confines of his room to entail of endeavours of a couple of games of craps in between games, Tony found himself wandering into the last place he needed to be, the location being that of the hotel's bar. Thereupon the stool of the near-empty bar sat the silk back blonde hair without a hair out of place still in the impeccably tailored suit that clung to the span between his deltoid muscles, the stranger from the funeral hunched over the bar clasping the glass between his hands. Every step Tony took was a boost of confidence to a new level even for him or was it from the mingled of amber spirits that he had downed prior, pinching the creases of his black trousers not to strain over his lean thighs as he plopped down on the stool next to Aldrich. "You look to be in need of company," Tony said, dark hues scaling over Aldrich's side profile, there was something that sparked recognition only it was suppressed by alcohol. Surprise took hold of Aldrich's features, it didn't reach his eyes though as he spoke. "Aren't we always in need of some form of human companionship?" Offering a nod towards the blonde man. "Well, I'm looking for a different type of companionship this evening," Tony stated bluntly not having any subtly of the meanings behind his words, not wanting to waste time if the other doesn't feel the same. Tony was seeking that of comfort in the arms of strangers, a bad habit that started shortly after the tragic death of his parents and then Jarvis, now Maya, history repeating itself which it always will until the break of the cycle. Tonight wasn't the night for it to be broken, rather it would be reinforced.
Shovelling his free hand into the depth of his pocket, tilting his head while Yinsen brought his body closer but still at a respectful distance, Tony gaze, however, noticed him reaching to the man nearest them, courteously Tony's body pivoted to the man and the doctor's hand came back onto Tony's upper shoulder to guide him or more a precaution for the clearly buzzed Tony to not leave. "I'd like to introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu." Enticed Dr Wu to reach out for a handshake, there was delay reaction on Tony's side from trying to stay focused on this rather than letting his mind drift to what a certain scientist was getting up to but he firmly shook on the exchange of greetings. "You're a heart doctor, I may need your card in a couple of hours or so." Tony joked, receiving a frosty, pitiful laugh from the two doctors, this was going downhill quickly. It was here, amongst the conversation between the three and the right hypothetical questions in between idiot filled nonsense from Tony, did he gather about the possibility of being able to counteract the overheating issue Maya had brought up in conversation after her lecture. Unaware that there was a weaselly eavesdropper whom had been lurking in the midst of the crowded room, Aldrich pursuing the person of his obsession, Anthony Stark. Overhearing more about the conversation between the three about nanotechnology but that went to the back of his mind when Tony bid his farewells to the doctors. "I have your card, be expecting a call around 4 am doc." Placing the glasses back over his eyes to start manoeuvering his way towards the lobby thus Aldrich followed gathering speed with every unsteady step he took to meet the man he has admired for years now. Aldrich breathed in sharply from the spicy clove fragrance complementary to those notes of automotive grease, he relished in the scent bathing in the undernotes of Tony' fragrance trying to memorize all the scents and his train of concentration finally broke as he did a one-two-step blocking Tony's path to continue towards his destination, Tony flinched back into his left foot. "Wow-wow. Hey Tony. Aldrich Killian, I'm a big fan of yours," Aldrich greeted as if the two were old friends thus the dry swallow of saliva buildup in Tony's mouth knowing the look of that of a fan, the unsettling ease never cemented from the foolish astonishment held in the other's eyes, latching a hand to vigorously shaking his hand as Tony's hand went limp.
He only had one shot at any attempt of them getting to the front of the house where his son stood on firm ground, palm angled skyward as the shadow of the tail covered him, bright beaming powerful blast emitted from his palm. What he hadn’t thought of was the chain reaction from the pilot and machine working against each other, thus was what broke the ceiling and leap for life from the iron clattered man trying to grip onto the steadier ground of the house, pulling himself up as he watched the helicopter get swallowed by the churning sea below. There he hung trying to hoist himself up, only to receive that of the grand piano to the shellhead causing him to topple into the waters below.
Long gone has the golden glow of noon where his lecture on integrated circuits had taken place, apparently, to one intellectual mind
Migrating like a herd of animals towards the nearest exit to continue the party upstairs in a more intimate setting, Tony's hand clasped around Maya's much smaller one though in an affectionate gesture more to keep her close by.
As Tony strides down the hallway, the man from the elevator slowly disappearing from his mind and then completely left his mind when the wooden door pulled back to reveal Maya.
As we all know time is an illusion but it takes the length of the phantasm to heal whether that be of the mind, body or spirit. In this case, it was that of the body, the welts no longer depicted upon his golden skin nor that of the hand marks seared into fleshy wrists. Now only that of the specs on each wrist of the lightest of scar tissues unnoticeable to Tony himself. And it took that of only a few months for his body to do so and only that of three weeks for that of a name to slip from thoughts.
Deep in the earth she was laid to rest as untimely as it was, a touch of regret for not deepening his connection with her and how unfair death truly was for taking someone who had so much to offer the world. Tony stood with hands clasped in front of his person, blackened shades to hide the redden rivers that stretched across his scleras from a mixture of lack of sleep and that of drinking himself to musk up the courage to appear at the funeral, instead of dealing with the emotional touch of the dead Tony opts for the liquid spirit forms to keep emotions at bay. There were too few of people that stood around the lowering of the casket, disheartening to him as they were mostly like him an acquaintance rather than that of a loved one, words were spoken to guide her into the afterlife ― not that Tony believed in that but he was paying respects to someone who deserved better, so he kept his thoughts to himself.
Unsatisfied by the time the two men spent together between the sheets. Or was it peculiarness of the abruptly painful end, Tony left in a sweating heap of limps, gasping for breath from the oppressive heat that swelted out any oxygen in his lungs, mahogany irises filling with blacking specs from the looming fadeout. Mystifying came in the form of awakeness hours later from the poor bedside manner of his bodyguard, throwing clean underpants at his boss. "Sleeping beauty you ain't more along the lines of her ugly twin brother, Snoozing fugly." Happy said laughter that broke apart his widening smile only did it fade out quickly from the wheezes from parched throated Tony. "Boss, you alright?" No time from the words that concernedly spill from Happy's mouth is he over by Tony's side of the bed, noticed of burn welts upon golden skin it was a shock to see but not close to the worst state Tony has been in, sadly. Seeing that his finger is pointed in that of the direction of the faucet in the bathroom from the door being left open, something that usually a pet peeve of Tony's leaving the bathroom door ajar but he was grateful for it. Spring back to his feet, Happy jogged out of the room and out of Tony's sight. In the absence of his bodyguard, Stark dug his elbows into the springs of the mattress and dragged himself up that way every breath burnt his throat, he pushed through the dehydration and flimsiness that constricted his muscles but he managed to thread his legs through the openings of his underpants to cover himself to bring himself some dignity that was decreasing at a rapid rate.
Happy waiting out the front of the hotel's entrance, sat in the driver's seat the sleep still in the tear ducts, unnoticed. Tony's weight dipped the ledge of the mattress, previous night's pants covered over his lean muscular thighs, fine cotton shirt unbutton allowing the air to attack over porcelain gold, spine curved over to finish up fluent looped lettering upon the back of Aldrich Killian's card, the missing piece to her equation to equalised the overheating issue, his eyes trailed over the rigid pathways of sheets that lead him to the brunette sleeping beauty on the far side of the bed, the Egyptian cotton sheet respectfully draped just under the dimples of located on the small of her back. She'd make was that of a vision in the morning light but she wasn't the one for Tony, so he'd continue to seek his search for love but he wished her the best. Brought the card to press against his lips, a farewell kiss, delicately balancing the card on the nightstand against the base of the lamp. Before standing to his feet and quietly exiting the room, shirt still opened caught the draft of air as his feet carried him towards his escape. There was no wait for the elevator as if someone had just got off, convenient for Tony that is so no second thought about it. Threading buttons through holes as his head was tilted down to make sure each button is in the right loop, blazer hung over his forearm. A strange feeling that he just brushed off of being watched from afar.
❝ It started in Bern, Switzerland. 1999. The old days. I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they? ❞
Tony settled himself into the corner of the elevator, pressing the button impatiently to close the doors but of course, Aldrich read it as an invitation instead of the conclusion Tony hoped for, watching him squeeze between the painfully slow closing doors, teeth grazing over his inner cheek giving it the illusion of hollowness. "Oh, look at that you made it in..." Tony's voice stained to keep his tongue at bay to not antagonise this fan, dammit why is it his name kept slipping his mind. "Yeah, thought we could talk here," Aldrich said, nodding his head with an excited smile. If Tony was un-eased by the situation he wouldn't be able to deny that there's a cuteness to it, definitely the beer goggles talking. The fleeting of Tony's patience once not crossing his features, yet behind yellow shades, narrowing of his hues told of a different story, there was a flush on pasty, blemished cheeks from Aldrich catching Tony staring mistaking it for something other entirely as the depths of A.I.M his own company spilled out of his mouth. "I'm gonna stop you there," Tony dared to step forward, flimsily holding up his palm to the dirty blonde male. "How about you give me your card, actually make that two." Tony started watching Aldrich eagerly take out two cards with the information on the company. "There you go," Aldrich handed over with a beaming smile, taking the two cards from his fingers, slipping the card into that of his pocket. Not uttering a word.
Relief flooded over Steve's features of the unmistakable moppy locks of blonde of his youngest son, sat on top of the counter cross-legged with the lantern place just at his ankles and box of corn flakes between his legs, the rustling of plastic from a hand diving into the depths to grab out a handful of dry cereal. "What are you doin' up, Harls?" Steve asked, making himself known to his son, a settled jerk from Harley's body, ankles knocking the lantern off the edge of the counter. "Busted," Harley muttered through a previous mouthful of dry cereal, a sheepish grin of pursed lips. He flicked the light switch on, crossed the short distance and plucked the lantern from the floor. "Caught you red-handed, you lil' cereal bandit," Steve teases, a playful smile on his own lips, watching the wheels metaphorically turn in his head. "Uh, t-this is all an f-figment of your imagi-nation," Harley said in an aloof tone, pulling his arm from the oversized box of cereal, revealing a little hand covered in flakes of cereal. The mirth of a chuckle upon the sight, fingers gently ruffle through flaxen locks and Harley's head nuzzled into his father's hand.
it was unintelligible nonsense since it has fleeted his mind not too long after his words left his mouth, never once did they register in his mind, so his input was useless, to say the least. Her scoff of laughter when an eager-eyed young man complimented him on the speech, drunken goggles blanket his dark gaze that cut through tinted lens to acknowledge the not-so-much younger male. "Thank you, some minds obscure the reading between the lines," Tony's words slide from his tongue out of a drawing smirk, craning his neck to let his dark hues rest back on the woman who's theories have captivated his drunken hazed mind and to hide the smirk of the dangerously testing man Maya popped the end of her party blower in between his adjusting lips as Tony took the bait, biting down upon the plastic between his teeth, revealing the space between his two front teeth. Happy used his body to block the man from pestering Tony coaxing the stranger to move on. Happy, his walking clock always making Tony debate whether he needs a watch though his eyes never left Maya, studying her as if she was that of a mathematical equation, something missing that stumped him at the very moment of solving her.
Steve went and tucked Harley into bed. It was hard to detach the little fist that clung to his shirt, managed to do just that without waking Harley. He lingered in the room of his youngest son, eyes land on the photo of prodded up against the base of Harley's lamp. In the photo was that of four smiling faces stared back at him, standing on the porch of their Malibu house. It had been three years since this photo was taken, Harley on Steve's left hip and Tony's arm over Peter's hunching slightly over from the two of them laughing hard about a science joke that went over Steve's head. Happiness lies in everything and it comes in many forms to everyone differently, Steve's happiness came from his loved ones being happy. Steve hasn't been able to shake the feeling from the pit of his stomach that left the burn of bile in the back of his throat, whatever this meeting would be tomorrow will rattle that of the loose foundations of the family's happiness. That photo captured the truest form of sunshine, love and happiness proven in the smiles.
Propellers sliced at nothing but something altogether, air to high tail it out of the line of fire of three unknown helicopters, cameras that hadn’t stopped rolling since arriving at the Malibu mansion of one of Earth’s greatest heroes, Iron Man. Paparazzi had been waiting to get a photo of the man, the legend and not such a myth, accompanied by one of his two sons, the rumours that spread at wildfire capacity at the belief that he and Captain America had broken up, it may have looked that way on the onlookers perspective. The reason why Tony Stark was in town meant nothing and for whirling chops from copters to retreat back as the camera lens stayed of the atrocity of what once was a home, now turned to rubble from the third missile thus designed to kill.
It had taken over three years for Maya Hansen's development further from the guidance of Tony's mathematical theorem of Extremis serum thus also brought the first successful Extremis-enhanced person and that person happened to be Aldrich, only last year. Everything about his physical attributes changed from the weakened man, she had met a year or so prior. And he had since cut his hair and the attire of well tailor suits draped from his body like that of armour, the newfound confidence, honestly, he was unrecognisable to Maya. After successfully getting a bunch of soldiers through the tests of the Extremis and it was there where she noticed that Aldrich is becoming more diabolical, hungry for more and the lack of empathy, happened to be unsettling enough for Maya later that night in the laboratory. The bluish light illuminating her from fluorescent lights above her, rest of the room around sheeted in dull darkness and there was a chill but it was welcomed by Maya as it always kept her awake during the long nights spent at the lab. Six Medusa plants sat in planters on the top shelf of her desk above her head, green foliage brought a pop of colour to the two-toned colours of the make-up of the labs, declining her chin towards the glow from the screen that had a number typed up, uncertain if it is in service still. But she needed to inform someone even if that someone was Tony Stark, he was the one that filled in her missing pieces to create Extremis serums and hopeful that he'd help. But before she could press the call button on the brick-like phone, sharp pain in the back of her neck and the chilling lulled from Aldrich before everything faded to black.
. With that Aldrich Killian slipped into the room that Tony exited from seeing the slumbering naked woman that drove Aldrich's teeth into the fleshy part of his inner cheek, leaving that of another card with his phone number and written note as if from Tony saying give a call. Took everything in his being to not allow his anger to get the best of him that morning, he left as quickly as he came. As revenge would be his and he would get what he desires just needs to wait until it is obtainable, mainly the assistance of the mind of Maya Hansen.
“We should have gone to New York,” Steve says miserably, and there are tears welling in his eyes. Tony quickly brushes them away before they can fall.
“I swear, Tony, look.” Steve pulls his hand out of Tony’s grip, moving over to the bag to dig through it until his fingers find the slippery plastic hotel key. “I’ve got it.” He holds it in front of Tony’s face. “I’ll go straight there, and I’ll be back.”
“No,” Tony says with a slight snarl, tugging Steve by the hair away from his neck, hard enough that Steve’s hand grabs at his side. His lips press to Steve’s with ferocious intensity, with enough strength that one of Steve’s teeth catches his lip and cuts it, his own blood reddening Steve Rogers’ mouth. Years of wanting with one kiss, Tony’s hands greedily grab at any part of Steve he can reach – his hair, his jaw, his shoulders. The chair squeaks as Tony straddles Steve’s lap, pulling him closer to him.
“Who?” Steve carefully advances forward, his hand still on Tony’s arm, keeping him a few paces behind him.
Steve nods, reaching down to unzip his jeans, rolling them down his thighs slowly. Tony glances down at his hands, and then back up at his face, his expression one of furious delight.
“Well…” Steve kisses the curve of his shoulder gently and Tony sighs against the pillow, his fisted hands slowly releasing the sheets that his blunt nails had been tearing small holes into. “Do you want me to…?”
Steve is standing too close to him, his presence is just as intoxicating as the whiskey. When Steve stands too close to him, Tony makes mistakes. Taking another sip of whiskey, he sidles away from the fireplace, leaning back against the wall by the bookshelf.
Something in his voice must give him away, because there’s rustling, the click of a bedside lamp being turned on. Steve’s voice is no longer sleepy, it’s deep, laced with concern.
“Why would you do that?” Tony snarls between kisses, his fingers digging into the front of Steve’s shirt. “Why would you
Tony’s apartment will be messy, covered in circuitry and twisted pieces of metal, so much that it will be hard to see the floor. Dum-E will whir from where he’s placed in the corner of the living room. Tony will hop and skip over things, the path hardwired in his brain. He’ll put away his few groceries and get a glass of water for the two of them, and he’ll direct Steve over to the couch. He’ll shove what might be a Playboy magazine off of the couch quickly before Steve can sit, expression mortified. Steve will sit down next to him, and he will tell Tony everything.
“We’re talking now,” Tony says, shouldering the phone against his ear as his hands move to rip the package to shreds. A small square of paper flutters to the floor, and Tony seizes it.
“I threw it into the toilet just now,” Steve says around his own, his mouth now startlingly white, even whiter than his perfect teeth.
shield – he had felt the crack of bone more than he had heard it. It was hard to hear much, with the blood rushing in his ears, he could barely hear Steve’s panting breaths as he struggled to climb off of Tony.
dang things got a teeny bit raunchy, huh... alright i think i feel satisfied with this one  -- it had to be more than a one shot, but... i made myself sad :(
“Tony,” Steve says, his voice warm, the chair scraping against the floor as he pushes it back. Steve’s bag lands on the floor beside him, and his calf brushes against Tony’s as he makes himself comfortable in the chair. Tony sets his wine glass down, the thud of it hitting the table sounding ever so loud.
“Shit!” Steve almost falls off the bed as he lunges across it, pulling open the drawer of the nightstand with such force that it falls off the rails, contents spilling out on the floor. He grabs the phone from where it sits on top of his sketchbook, flipping it so hard that he’s worried that he’s snapped it in two.
Steve’s childhood is a mysterious thing, Tony is curious about it, but he's never asked. Without realizing it, he’s inching back from the edge of the roof, the nanites making their rapid trek back to the reactor.
Tony picks up the outdated piece of technology with trembling hands – trust Steve to somehow find a model that Tony is pretty sure ended production at least three years ago. It’s bulky plastic, but rugged – and Tony has a feeling the line is more than secure, it is likely untraceable.
“Your hair’s different,” Tony says, cocking his head as he takes inventory. “Not getting a lot of sun, Steve? I hear Wakanda has beautiful weather year round, so I’m surprised.”
