Tony had for a long time considered that sooner or later he would have to bring Coulson something that would satisfy him. He had a few such gadgets prepared in his studio, so it was enough to pick up the better ones (of course together with the manual) and take them to the dear headmaster's office.
"Once I also used to think that it's a sad painting. Now, when I look at it, I see you working on the next project and worrying about whether it will be good enough. I see you not realizing at all how much you have achieved."
By the time Stark knew what he was doing, he was outside, shivering with despair, and the lab door slammed loudly behind him. He felt like someone was trying to break his chest with a jackhammer. Why did Steve do this to him? Why was only his father important?
If his father said anything else, Tony didn't hear it. "At least his name isn't Clint," roared in his head as if it was any consolation.
Hawkeye? An aggressive green monster? Captain and Widow? Banner nowhere to find? And all this serum, radiation and mutation.
Not that his armor needed any improvements. However, if there was to be someone in the world with arrows equipped with his stun gun, why should he not be prepared for the fact that this person would ever hit him with that weapon? Actually, he was even able to go a step further and...
"Mhm," Tony grunted. Come on! If he doesn't speak now, he may never have another opportunity! "Actually, it's him. Jarvis is male. And he makes pretty good toast. Do you want one?"
"Boss, should I deal with this?" Happy asked via intercom. Something in his voice told Tony that he was not thrilled about the kids who would be sent away without even one symbolic candy. If he could, he probably would have consumed a bar of chocolate or three with them, but it was not only his diet but the employer's clear orders that wouldn't allow him to.
Tony reluctantly dug himself out of the silk bedclothes, which he quickly changed into a soft robe, and headed to the office. Pepper followed him, tapping her heels on the wooden floor. At first glance, everything looked as usual. Basically speaking, the room was in an extraordinary order. No, not because Tony was running away from work. He just thought much better in the workshop, while the office served only as a meeting place for important clients.
This clumsy explanation was interrupted by knocking on the door. Damn! Why did he have to be everywhere, so Tony wasn't even able to forget him? Why did it have to be him in the first place?
"I assumed it was a problem that Clint could solve without intermediaries," the headmaster replied in such a tone that Tony thought for a moment that he winked at him. "You have the right to know who your client is, Anthony."
But on the other hand... No matter how you looked at it, Rogers firstly effectively overwhelmed Tony, and then pulled Happy out for a long ride.
"What?" Pepper was completely dumbfounded. She knew perfectly well what attitude Tony had towards Halloween. She knew that he did everything to avoid dressed up people seeking sweets unless it involved... She closed her eyes, took a few deep breaths, then looked eloquently at her boss. "How many?"
They lay next to each other, kissed, brushed each other carefully. Tony didn't even notice when they were undressing (he just noticed that it was very difficult to unbutton a shirt with one hand), and then they were just in their underwear. Panting, he leaned closer to Steve, put his nose against his collarbone, and let him slip his knee between his thighs.
Tony left the bathroom, releasing a cloud of hot steam. He shivered involuntarily from the cold air. Why did this damn property have to be so big that everything was far away? He had to develop a special transport to move around his own home. Even let it be roller skates... only better, without wheels, but with jet propulsion.
"Oh, and I wanted to make some improvements to the armor." Prepare everything, I'll be there in a minute."
"No. I'm serious. It adheres to the classic current, is easy to remember and generally fits. It's just right for a superhero."
"I don't have candy, yes," Tony began, desperately searching for any hooking point. Something that makes them all stop and then allows him to drag the naive hero into his cave of evil and debauchery. "But that doesn't mean you have to leave empty-handed, doesn't it?"
Tony behind their backs called them trolls, but the annoyance over such a turn of events was overcome by the joy that shy and alienated Bruce found a new friend.
It was his young god, this walking perfection, his knight in shining armor. From the waist up, completely naked, without socks, as if he had just pulled on his pants, all wet and sticky from something shiny, with blue spots running along the ribs.
Damn it. Wonderful, just wonderful. His father was just getting Steve drunk with some absurdly exclusive liquor, and Tony was parading around the house only in his bathrobe.
Oh, wonderful. So the fact that the jacket was male didn't mean that it wasn't his father's new toy. All in all, Tony shouldn't be surprised by that. This is not the first time his father has changed his orientation so that it suited his mood.
"Pep," Tony interrupted her with a face contorted in a poor parody of a reassuring smile. "He's sleeping with my father."
Another strange discovery was that Natalie Rushman was actually Natasha Romanov, a world-class assassin wanted for numerous crimes, who got from the SHIELD her last chance to return to the light side of the force. For the first couple of days, after bringing this information to light, Tony tried to avoid it, but he couldn't do it for too long. She discovered his weakness for sweets and began to bake muffins every day, which made him turn a blind eye to her past.
Everyone who dared to get to know him at least a little bit knew that at that moment his brilliant mind went on a journey towards the future.
Tony didn't expect that question. And even if he expected it, he wouldn't know what to say. So he just shrugged and nodded. Steve's smile grew even wider, as wide as it was possible.
No matter what Pepper thought, red and gold matched perfectly, just like the name he picked. He wasn't sure if he was swollen with pride or paint fumes, but he knew for sure that he had done something magnificent. No. Monumental. That's a better word. In half an hour, when the paint dries, his work of the last few months will finally be done.
Taking advantage of the fact that they were alone, Pepper moved closer to Tony and whispered in his ear:
"They are new students on a military scholarship," Pepper replied, as always well informed. "The girl is Natalie Rushman, and these two are Clint Burton and Steven Rogers."
Clint didn't think much about his moves, many years of practice prevailed over reason. As soon as Tony appeared in sight, Barton aimed the arrow at him, activated it and fired. Contrary to his expectations, the arrow didn't go towards the new antagonist and didn't incapacitate him.
"Jarvis, turn off the damn light!" Tony shouted, redirecting his anger onto artificial intelligence.
He involuntarily remembered the distant vacation they had spent together in the Carbonelles Italian estate. How old was he then? Eleven? Twelve? It was only later that he learned that his mother wanted to protect him from the attacks of his father, who completely stopped refraining from falling into alcoholism. In addition to memories, Maria Stark brought this one and only painting and hung it in her private room. When Tony asked her why she had chosen such a sad picture, she laughed and said:
"I am happy for you," said the younger boy. "But before I start screaming with you like a little girl at the sight of a unicorn, would you like to reveal some more details?"
Tony took a deep breath hearing his name. THe used his name, damn, he did. What a direct boy! Stark grinned at the thought of how he would reward his soldier.
They didn't have the strength to talk long. Tony let Steve kiss and cuddle him, repaying him with similar caresses until he was too tired to move. It was wonderful falling asleep with the thought that he had finally found the perfect place to sleep, without thoughts and nightmares swirling in his head. And in the morning he would wake up with someone who belonged only to him.
For several painfully long hours, he tried to get to work and then just to fall asleep. He couldn't do one or the other. He only thought about what he saw in his father's office, what must have happened before he came, and what might have happened after he fled. The awareness of how unpredictable his father was in relationships didn't help at all. He couldn't be happy that his father would get bored of Steve one day, because that would mean that those perfect blue eyes would be filled with sadness every time they meet as if Tony was guilty of what had happened.
Tony turned slowly to take a look at Steve, who was heading towards him with his two guards. From the eyes of the two he read clearly that if Steve wanted to talk to him, their head was in it so that he could not escape. Tony decided not to even try.
And to think that once he stubbornly claimed that nothing could discourage him from watching Star Trek...
He has been present in school life since he was eight years old. All because his father funded numerous scholarships, but he never had time to officially award them, which is why Tony, as heir to Stark Industries, had to do it for him. When it turned out that the charming genius boy was doing a greater sensation on galas than a busy middle-aged charmer (and therefore attracts more investors), Howard threw all the duties associated with the SHIELD on his firstborn's shoulders.
Tony looked at him with a smile so full of happiness and gratitude that the eyebrows of his three new "friends" involuntarily went up.
"If I had anything against it, I wouldn't invite you at all. Come on, don't stand like that at the door. Have some mercy, I'm getting cold. And I suppose you don't want to catch a cold, either."
Steve smiled back and kissed him again. Their lips touched so gently that Stark began to fear that they would not cross the line of modest kisses that evening. He couldn't allow it. He was quite familiar with kissing, so he decided to force a slightly faster pace on Steve.
"Mr. Banner is at school, his blood is deadly high in adrenaline, if atrial fibrillation does not stop within three minutes, the risk of heart attack will be at 98%. His body was strongly radiated, which causes constant mutations..."
Still, he was officially admitted to the SHIELD only a year ago, just after he managed to escape his abductors. He was supposed to be safe at school, but... Exactly. BUT. The kidnappers hoped that they would make him build weapons. The SHIELD was expecting exactly the same. He hadn't given them anything they could use, so far. He didn't even show them the prototype of the armor that he used to escape. Rhodey was right. The day when Headmaster Coulson will lose his patience was approaching with great speed.
Coulson just nodded. Tony wasn't sure how he should interpret it, but it might have been worse. At least Banner began to recover. With each passing moment, he was becoming less and less green and calmer, and finally, as an ordinary, beloved, completely harmless Bruce, he began to snore quietly. They were about to cover him with a blanket when a helicopter landed on the square outside the school.
"Happy, take this squad of self-proclaimed heroes to the salon and play my Star Trek collection. The episodes are numbered in order from the most outstanding to unfortunately only good ones, so you don't have to worry about choosing. And, give them some popcorn!"
"I can only tell you that I inherited from Abraham Erskine project of super-soldier serum," he confessed, very pleased with himself, but when he met Tony's doubtful look, his enthusiasm escaped. "I know that sounds like a joke, but believe me, it's not. Erskine managed to complete the project and create one such soldier, but soon after he died and left behind only the result of his research and several encrypted notes."
Was it possible that Steve... But on the other hand, there had to be a reason why this sweet soldier caught fire so quickly and so desperately attacked Stark. He didn't look like someone who spontaneously makes decisions about jumping into bed with strangers. If, however, money was involved or, worse, fanaticism, Tony would need any other explanation. It would just mean he met another asshole, that's all.
Throwing curses under his breath, he pulled sweatpants on his overly oiled ass and draped himself in a thick fluffy robe. The only thing he wanted was to catch a cold because of the army of gnomes dressed in absurd costumes. What was popular this year? Vampires? Werewolves? Ah, yes, superheroes. What idiocy.
Barton opened his mouth wide in surprise, then began to ask the headmaster about hundreds, in Tony's opinion, completely irrelevant things. After all, he went to a special school for very gifted people, so why was he so surprised by the fact that the equipment was arranged for him by another student? His attitude changed as soon as he saw the contents of the suitcase. In a split second, he turned from a surprised boy into a professional archer. He touched the arrows, caressed them, checked their weight in his hands, and finally stated:
The headmaster decided to grab the bull by the horns because instead of scolding him for acting like they were really close in the school corridor, he put his arm around Tony like a best friend would and tried to pull him by the tongue:
Howard was already opening his mouth to add another remark about wasting talent when (luckily) his phone rang. Older Stark glanced at the screen, winced and ran out of the kitchen, shouting over his shoulder:
"I'll have to call your parents," Steve said it hesitantly, but there was a sense in his voice that he was almost convinced by Tony. He smiled again and ruffled the boy's hair. Stark felt a strange tap at his sternum at the scene. He never liked children. He hated even being around them. This carefree and affectionate gesture reminded him of Jarvis, who desperately tried to raise Tony as a good man, and a father who never made the effort to even try... "Nobody minds? Tony?"
To his surprise, Fury also smiled, which seemed to him a good sign for a moment, then this illusion popped like a soap bubble.
Tony didn't need to be told twice. He quickly realized that it was a signal for him to vanish, so he did. Coulson's behavior made it clear to him that at some point the headmaster had revealed too much information to him. Only in which? Wait, wait, what did he ask at the beginning? Has he met Rogers... Well, that's a stupid question. However, he also asked about the other two. Did any of them use a bow? He crossed Steve out immediately. His silhouette suggested melee combat rather than ranged attacks. Natalie or Clint? Clint had definitely stronger shoulders, so he was the one to consider.
For a few annoyingly long minutes, he had to explain to Happy that calling for an ambulance and calling for his father was unnecessary. He understood his concern, but all that overprotectiveness was beginning to annoy him a bit. The worst thing was that he felt Steve's eyes on him all the time, which made him constantly lose the thread. Why did he do this to him? His very presence was like torture.
"The catch is that you will be allocated in a military scholarship of the same class as mine," Rogers explained calmly. He was looking down at Tony all the time, arms folded. He looked so attractive that Stark had to go to great lengths to fight the urge to touch him. "It means more or less that from tomorrow I will be your supervisor and you have just become a member of project A."
"Come on, Rhod," Pepper sighed, setting aside one of the countless projects she was just finishing. "They have no right to force him to do such things. Besides, it's not like Tony doesn't do anything for them."
Barton never again tried to convince Tony to give Rogers one more chance, and Tony was extremely grateful for that. Thanks to this, their relations remained solid, and the implementation of new stocks of arrows was a pleasant opportunity for both to talk, and not a bothersome duty. Behind the mask of seriousness and cool distance, Clint turned out to be a really nice, though somewhat malicious specimen of a cynic, so he immediately became friends not only with Tony but also with Pepper and Rhodey.
"And you, basing on these notes and the soldier's genetic material, will try to reconstruct this whole serum?"
This question was asked by Steve. He stared with eyes wide open at Jarvis, but he wasn't terrified, more like fascinated. It was obvious that he completely did not understand what was happening right under his nose, but his mind did not try to deny it or reject it. He just accepted what he saw, artificial intelligence was just making a toast for Tony.
"He is a wonderful man, that's for sure. But he is also a hopeless father. If you want to make friends with Tony, never mention him. Never."
He was sitting in such a bathtub right now. In the foam reaching his ears, he drowned sadness in the warm smell of almonds. He slept all afternoon and didn't know what to do with himself. Bathing seemed like the best solution.
"The Avengers," Steve explained, then smiled crookedly. "I didn't choose the name, but it's not that important."
Tony tried to look around, but Steve didn't turn on the light, just immediately put him on the bed. He stepped away only for a moment to turn on the player. Tony laughed involuntarily when he heard Sinatra. Steve rubbed his neck, embarrassed by that reaction. Even in the dark, his blue eyes seemed to shine. How could Tony deny him anything? He moved to the wall to make Steve more space, what he immediately used.
Wonderful. Just great. The same soft male voice that with laugher murmured his father's name, to him was referring only as "Stark." It couldn't have been better.
"And what will you do about it, Phil? Will you eliminate me?" Tony laughed, but he quickly realized it was true. They'll do it if he sniffs too much and produces too little weapon.
That's when Tony saw the second thing. Or rather things. There was a jacket on the hanger that certainly didn't belong to his father. What's more interesting, it wasn't a women's jacket either. Dark brown leather, slightly worn, a style more casual than elegant. And shoes in a similar fashion. It could only mean an unofficial military delegation. Wonderful. Has Coulson already informed his father that Tony knows about Fury's existence?
Steve just scowled. He hadn’t slept for the two days Tony had been away- too busy worrying after Peter- and the noise that those tiny lungs were managing to produce was pushing him close to tears. He didn’t have the energy to snap a sarcastic reply at Tony right now.
“Daddy,” Maria poked him in the shoulder and he looked down at her, “does this mean that we get to eat takeout again?”
Tony, for a moment, contemplated his life. But then he decided to just fuck it, and turned over on the couch, lying down across the whole length of it with his stomach facing the floor and his ass right by Steve’s face. “Go nuts, babe,” he said with a wave of his hand, “long as no pants are removed, I’m good.”
Thor looked down with a small little smile. Then he straightened up, wiping his face once more and visibly composing himself. Something seemed to change in him; his shoulders spread, his face brightened, and he made a conscious effort to relax himself. He looked more like what Steve usually saw in him.
He shook himself again. No, no, Tony would be fine. He was with the rest of the team, and Steve knew without a doubt that they would keep him safe. He just had to trust them until help arrived. They’d be okay. Tony would be okay.
Steve just smiled wetly, leaning forward and pressing his lips to Tony’s forehead. “I know,” he whispered, “I know. I love you too, okay?  This… this isn’t because of that. This isn’t because I blame you, or I think it’s your fault, or anything. This is just me, trying to do what’s best for us. I need you to understand that.”
“He threatened to turn into a version of Skynet if I wronged you,” Steve blurted just as Tony reached him, and then watched in part guilt, part amusement as Tony’s smile dropped and his eyebrows rocketed.
They’d been through it all. They’d travelled through time and space, fought battles that barely anyone could ever dream of, and they’d saved the universe. They had the scars to prove it, both physical and mental. There were times when neither of them could sleep for days—periods where one of them had to leave home for a little while so that they wouldn’t upset Maria. It wasn’t easy. Of course it wasn’t. Things in their life never were. But it was worth it. Without question.
Winter wrapped around New York like a cold sheet, and Steve became used to the feeling of numb fingers and cold limbs every time he left the Wilsons’ home. All his friends thought he looked hilarious decked out in his five layers, two pairs of gloves, a bobbly hat and a thick woollen scarf, but he was not perturbed by their teasing.
“Sorry,” Steve said apologetically as he reached for the phone, and Tony sighed, settling his chin sulkily on Steve’s chest and looking up at him with a pout. Unfortunately, seeing as his work phone only rang in emergencies and high-priority cases, Steve couldn’t let himself be swayed. Shame. He picked up the phone and moved it to his ear, pressing his finger to Tony’s lips to stop the man from doing something churlish, like make very loud sex noises. It would not be the first time. “Captain Rogers speaking.”
Sam was staring at him with a frown on his face, fingers locked under his chin. Tony had his legs crossed and was sat in front of Sam, finger tapping underneath an equation as he looked over at the other boy expectantly.
Tony nodded thoughtfully. “Yeah, thought so,” he muttered. “JARVIS, turn on the water for me. Make sure it’s not too hot.”
With an imperceptible huff, Steve pushed some of the longer strands of Tony’s hair out from his eyes with his pinkie finger, tucking them behind his ear somewhat uselessly, seeing as Tony just shifted a second later and then dislodged them once again. Steve rolled his eyes- trust that boy to be stubborn, even in his sleep.
Rolling immediately to his feet, his head shot up, eyes wild as he threw himself forward mere seconds after falling to the floor. His wrist cried in pain, and Steve assumed he’d injured it when he’d stuck the landing, but again, it wasn’t important.
There was a short pause, and then Steve heard a long, staticky groan. “Oh my God. Oh my- I am so sorry Steve-“
“Afternoon, babycakes,” Tony smiled down at him softly and then lifted his hand to stroke the hair from Steve’s face, “you okay? I’m sorry I left. Thought you might be peckish when you woke up, hence,” he waved the jello cups in the air before throwing them carelessly on the bed and then using the now-free hand to gently knead Steve’s clenched fists open. “You’re gonna hurt yourself, Steve. Just relax. I’m here. I’m okay.”
Tony paused for a moment, before returning the smile and walking over. He still hadn’t put on any pants. He needed to get his head straight before heading out today, otherwise things were just going to be a fucking mess. With as much nonchalance as he could muster, he walked into Steve’s open arms and then shut his eyes when he felt Steve wrap himself around Tony’s midsection and bury his head into Tony’s shirt. His hands were warm and firm against Tony’s back, and he leaned into the hold, his head bowing as he curled his forearms over Steve’s shoulders and sank into the other man. Steve’s fingers rubbed gentle circles into the knots across his back. “Maybe you should take a day,” the man murmured, “stay in. The work will still be there tomorrow.”
In hindsight, Steve probably should have told Medical about the weird heart palpitations. Or at least Tony. But at the time, it’d just seemed silly- he’d known that it would eventually recover after a day or two, and he’d sensibly assumed that until then he really wouldn’t have to worry about putting his body through anything overly strenuous.  Honestly, what were the chances of getting shocked twice in forty-eight hours?
proud of, and something I know you’re proud of too. Just remember that, alright?” He kissed Tony’s hand lightly, waiting for Tony to nod in understanding before he settled back into the pillows once more. “You really should sleep. It’s been a long day.”
Steve dropped into the driver’s seat and slotted the key into ignition. “Pepper got in touch,” he explained, “said you weren’t doing too great.”
He was just tired, that was all. It felt like he was hurting everything he cared for, whether it was intentional or not. Fuck, it wasn’t even 24 hours ago that Steve had promised he’d stay in line while being picked up from Fury’s office by Mrs. Wilson herself, and now he was here, planning to bunk off school the very next day.
“I think the fact that it’s my birthday means I’m allowed to tell you not to suck face on my couch,” Steve said haughtily, hands going to his hips as he glared at her, “now sit down and don’t m-“
Steve huffed, head lolling against the wall again. “He drove me through New York on his motorbike,” he said, voice dreamy, “took me to this house, really beautiful. Abandoned for years, but Tony knew a way in. We went up to the roof.”
“Oh ha ha,” Bucky said sarcastically, shoving him onto the couch and then jumping on next to him, “I opened up my emotionally stunted heart and you just throw it back in my face like that-“
Dad rolled his eyes and lifted a foot to push Peter down on to the bed with a thunk. “Shut it, squirt, we’re having a moment.”
“Just let it go, guys,” he said before they could attempt to comfort him. He didn’t need it. He knew the situation, and he’d known it going in. Tony was complicated, and his friends were assholes. There was nothing new about that.
“A week after mom died I nearly got Peggy killed,” he said simply, trying to avoid the way that still made him feel sick, even to this day, “we were arguing and I wasn’t- I wasn’t myself, and I wasn’t thinking straight, and she tried to take my hand but I shoved her off me, right off the curb and onto the road.” He kept himself still and tried not to flinch at his own words, still remembering the sudden spike of complete rage that had caused him to shove her off him. “I wasn’t intending on it. I didn’t aim to push her there. But I did, and it happened, and luckily there were no cars coming to kill her. But I still did it. And afterward, when she looked at me, you know what I did?” He chuckled humourlessly. “I turned my back and walked off. It was a good few hours later before I snapped out of it and realised what I’d done.”
Steve told him firmly, shutting the door and then hopping down the steps. Tony took a step back as he went, eyes still horribly wide. His hands were shaking. “You had to get me out of the way, otherwise I would’ve been in a hell of a lot more pain than I am right now. It’s fine. I promise. You did what you had to do and this was just an unlucky coincidence. That wasn’t what I needed to talk to you about.”
He watched as Tony stopped, the relaxed posture dissipating immediately. The boy shook himself, and then ran a hand over his face, sliding off the bed. “Oh, right. I- yeah, Steve, we should probably… I should take you home. Your friends- yeah.”
is he,” he growled, hand going to the car-door and clicking it open, “Steve, I swear to fucking God, what did he do to y-“
“You think he still loved you?” Rumlow whispered, “you really fucking thought he’d just show up one night, suddenly wanting you back? How pathetic can someone be, huh? You were his
He choked in shock, sitting bolt-upright and wheezing in a deep breath, feeling the pain spike through his nose when it irritated his sensitive skin. His room was pitch-dark and so he scrabbled for the light, shaking fingers yanking it on and then making him wince when the yellow glow hit his tired eyes.
And then- here had come Tony’s fatal mistake of the day. Later, he’d pin it on lack of caffeine in his system and the early hour at which he was conscious- but really, he was just an idiot who’d forgotten how offended his teammates could (and did) get on his behalf.
, alright. For the first few years of highschool, Tony had laughed at him, he’d thrown pencils at the back of his head in class and bumped him in the halls and Steve had automatically bitten back on a sigh whenever he’d seen Tony in the corridors with him. He’d known Tony Stark was an asshole from day one, when he’d been twelve and Tony had told him how weird his backpack was.
He made his way down to the bus stop once Tony had disappeared, telling Zeke to fuck off when he said something to his friends about Steve that made them all laugh. Then he got the bus, got home, and fell back into bed.
Steve shut his eyes and leaned forward, sagging into Tony’s embrace. The boy held him up easily, kissing softly along his hairline in a comforting gesture of contact the calmed Steve further with every touch. After a minute or two, Tony gently manoeuvred Steve on his lap and lay them both back down again, Steve’s back pressed up against Tony’s bare chest. Tony kissed the underside of his clenched jaw and wrapped his hands around the skinny expanse of Steve’ waist, shrouded by a baggy shirt. Steve, curled tightly into Tony, their arms both hanging off the side of the couch, just let out a small sigh of comfort.
Tony thought about it a lot, sure- but he’d never be able to get over how beautiful Steve always managed to look. Effortless, yet constant.
“The universe is rarely that lazy,” Thor told him, eyes on the corpse in front of him. His face was pinched. “You think this is his mother?”
Tony sighed, and then a second later did what he always ended up doing when Steve was in a hospital bed: joined him. Shuffling onto the cot, he quickly tucked himself into Steve’s side and then guided Steve’s palm over to the cool, flat surface of his reactor. Then, he placed his own down upon Steve’s chest, right between his pecs. They were both quiet for a few seconds; Tony listening to each individual heart-beat, and Steve to the low hum of noise that the arc reactor was constantly giving out.
Steve looked at it for another few seconds, before he smiled and shook his head, leaning down to kiss Tony’s forehead. “You think of me when you’re buying brunch bars?” He asked somewhat smugly, grinning in the way that showed off the points of his teeth. Tony just rolled his eyes and shoved him gently.
, the doctor had told him- but dammit, it sure as hell didn’t feel that way. The faint nausea roiling around in his stomach certainly seemed fucking real though, and he could feel the beginnings of a headache begin to prick just behind his eyes, so he popped a couple of aspirin and swallowed it down with water, just hoping to God it’d work.
, while you were grieving the loss of your best friend.” He tightened his fingers around Steve’s shoulder and laughed self-deprecatingly. “I was a shitty husband before I even got a chance to be a husband. And I’m so sorry for that. If I could go back, do things differently… I would.”
His fingers traced the lines of Tony’s smile underneath the pencil, and for a moment, he wished he’d never left. Being with Tony, in whatever form, was good enough for him. And since Tony was going to be busy for the next few days, Steve might not see much more of him for a while after tonight- except rather than just take what he could get, he’d gone and stormed off in some pitiful sulk. Maybe that made him pathetic, but he could hardly even care.
“It’ still knocking around in that head of yours, huh?” Tony finished for him, and Steve just nodded glumly. They were both silent for a moment, Tony sipping at his drink with slightly shaking fingers. He was very graceful with his actions, in a strange sort of way, and Steve watched him fascinatedly. They hadn’t gotten off to the greatest of starts, admittedly, but Tony was… he was interesting. Steve couldn’t exactly say that he liked the guy, but he knew that he’d been wrong about him. He’d seen that as soon as Tony had taken that nuke through the portal and thought that he was going to die.
“Yeah, but then he started speaking.” Thor poked his head around the corner of the fridge he was rifling through, grinning from ear to ear as he jerked a thumb over to Peter. “I was disbelieving at first too, but then he pointed at Bruce while saying his name, so I had no choice but to reward him with a late bedtime.”
He opened his mouth, trying to tell her he felt a bit sick, but the music drowned out his voice, and suddenly he was being dragged into the middle of the crowds before he could stop himself. As soon as he took the first step, he knew he was fucked. Whatever had been in his drink was strong- too strong for someone who’d never had more than a few sips before in his life, and he felt the world spinning out of control almost immediately.
Looking up at the red and gold armour in front of him, he clenched his teeth together and ignored the searing pain that flared up. “JARVIS,” he commanded, “pull up the framework of the suit, please.”
Loki just shrugged, chucking the spliff into the glove compartment. “He’ll be alright,” he told Steve, in what he could only guess was the boy’s attempt at comfort, “I’ve seen way worse.”
But he was here now, and Bucky’s car was swerving around the corner. Steve couldn’t exactly go back in now.
Steve stared blankly at him. “Bucky, I’m gonna ask you one question and I want you to answer me real honest, alright? Brother to brother.”
Instead, he raised an eyebrow and stepped into Tony’s space. “My friends are currently all staring at us through the crack in the curtains,” he said with a smile, “you wanna give ‘em a show?”
He carried on for a few more steps until he felt Tony twist around, stepping in front of him and cutting him off. He bumped into the other boy’s chest in surprise and looked up just in time to meet Tony’s mouth in the middle as he leaned down, capturing him in a short, sharp kiss.
Steve just stared at him, jaw clenched stubbornly and eyes hard- but so much sadder than Tony had realised before.
“Steve, come on, don’t be stupid, how is any of this your fault?” Tony asked, somewhat snappily, “you didn’t
Tony made a face and fiddled with his cufflinks. He wished he was back home, in bed. Preferably with a warm supersoldier at his side. Unfortunately though, being a superhero wasn’t all about fighting aliens and making things go boom. Sometimes it was about trying to stabilise international relations in order to prevent the second apocalypse after only just coming back from the first. “You’re dealing with the racist one,” he muttered irritably, looking at the wrinkly bastard in question, sat talking with the other wrinkly bastards in the back of the room.
“Steve,” Tony looked at him as if he’d just grown another head, “Steve, what the fuck, you’re not doing anything
Bucky was silent, looking at him. “Then why are you angry?” He asked, and then when Steve tried to immediately deny the fact, Bucky just rolled his eyes. “Come on, Steve, I’ve known you all my life. I can tell when you’re pissed.”
Steve grabbed the frame of the window and pulled upward, clutching Tony by the coat before he could slip off and fall. “Are you out of your mind?” Steve hissed, “what if you’d fallen? How did you even get
Tony paused, and then thankfully smiled a little. “I like the farm,” he said, “it was a good choice.”
He blinked. And then blinked again, because he hadn’t- well, he hadn’t drawn anyone in months. Hadn’t really drawn anything at all, for that matter. It was a terrible drawing, really; disproportionate and just stupid, but…
The man gave him a truly menacing glare, before cursing quietly and making his way over to the trolley. Steve’s plan was simple enough—they’d made it to the janitor’s break room without alerting suspicion, and now Steve was going to slip on a uniform while Tony went into the trashcan that was fitted into the trolley. After that, his plan was essentially to wheel them both to the nearest empty room with a window that wasn’t bulletproof, smash it with a chair, and then quite literally just stick Tony’s arm out of it until JARVIS picked up his signal. And viola. The suit would then be summoned, and Tony could fly away. Crude, maybe. But if it worked, it worked.
He shook his head and laughed a little, turning away. “Jesus, I sound so pathetic,” he muttered. “Look- it doesn’t matter. I’m… thank you for what you did for me. Thank you for getting the ring. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it-“
"Oh, believe me Steve, you do not know my world," Tony told him with a small little laugh. "That fact does not leave this conversation, alright?"
Of course though, when he got back home, the disappointment at having failed at the first hurdle became palpable. Steve hadn’t seemed interested at all. Even when Tony had tried to butter it up with kisses.
Hit after hit after hit, Tony was crying and he was so afraid, he could feel it settle right under his heart, pure and visceral as he pleaded for Steve to stop, but he didn't, he kept going until everything went blurry and Tony woke up, head lurching off the desk with a painful snap.
Fury opened it, watching the clear blue-tinted footage as it immediately popped into view. It was recorded from some sort of HUD by the looks of it, although a lot of the information on the sides had been blurred out. He could still see and hear what was happening in the footage, however, and he realised with a jolt that this was a video clip from the night Stark had escaped the facility. This was the fight that Agent Rumlow had been talking of in his statement—the one between him and Rogers.
He wasn’t sure how to explain any of that to Steve, though. It’d been done in the heat of some very intense emotions, and although Tony thought it was a good idea, he wasn’t sure how Steve was going to react to this. Would he like it? Or would he not want Tony to be fighting his battles like that?
“Liar,” Steve sung, arms wrapping around Tony’s body and mouth littering kisses across Tony’s face, laughing throughout each and every one.
Unfortunately, because Good things never lasted, Tony shoved the shirt over his neck a second later and pulled it down, hiding the expanse of lean muscle and beautiful skin under a sharp red t-shirt that hung gorgeously around his shoulders. His hair was wet, sticking to his forehead and making little dark patches of water appear on the material as soon as it covered him. Surprise surprise, Steve was once again rendered speechless- Tony looked fucking
“What?” Tony jutted out his chin, stepping forward. “What the hell do you mean, ‘this is your fault’?”
“Cosa ho fatto per meritarti?” He whispered, barely even audible as his fingers moved up the knobs in Steve’s spine, “come fai a essere così perfetto?”
His therapist’s room was exactly what you’d expect to find from someone dealing with the sorts of things she did. It was bland beiges, whites and greys- welcoming but clinical. There was a nice flower in the corner of the room, and she kept the windows open. Probably all attempts to make the place look less threatening, but honestly, it just made Steve feel kinda bored. It gave off that vibe of being a place where things just… never happened. The room that time forgot. He could see the forest outside, though- that was probably the most appealing part. Lots of beautiful greens, contrasted by the blue of the sky; definitely a nice touch to the blandness of the rest of his surroundings-
Steve shrugged, looking back at Tony. “I’m tired of the people I care about being hurt,” he said bluntly, “you hurt Thor a lot. I know that much. But he only hurts because he cares. And you know what, Loki? If I had any family left who still gave a crap about me, I’d hold onto that. Because you never know what could happen tomorrow. And one day, when you find yourself really,
Tony sighed dramatically. “Oh, Steve,” he said, lifting his left hand and then waving his fingers, “I wish I could, but I’m already married.”
No. No, none of this was okay. But Steve had to push through it. Hell, seeing as he was here, supposedly spilling his guts to Tony, he might as well—you know—
Tony’s weight in his arms, the tuck of him against Steve’s chest as he’d cradled him on that street, the slack face… it could all have been indicators that Tony was just sleeping. Steve could live in that delusion for a little while, right? He’d just been asleep. Or maybe it was Steve who was asleep, having a horrifically realistic nightmare, and he was going to wake up and Tony was going to be there, and when Steve started to cry, Tony would shush him and rock him and stroke his hands through his hair and tell him everything was okay. That it was all okay. That he wasn’t going anywhere.
Just as Tony opened his mouth to undoubtedly start a quarrel, Bucky called out to the both of them. “Got the hatch open, if either of you losers fancy actually doing your jobs and stopping this shitshow.”
He quietly started up a count of Steve’s heartbeat as he shut his eyes and rested, fingers subconsciously tapping in time to the beat. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight-
“Where are the others?” Bucky asked, grunting as he came into contact with the first enemy; punching him square in the face and sending him into Steve’s waiting arms, which quickly brought unconsciousness along to their attacker.
“Well, I’ve got the message,” Steve chuckled, head thumping against the stairs as he leaned back, “’don’t mess Tony around or you will be hunted down and possibly skinned’.” He paused, before adding: “Not that I ever
“Fuck yourself,” he says cheerily, and barely even winces when the spoon flies an inch away from his nose in response. He’s grown used to it.
Someone was saying his name, blurred and distant through the fog in his head. There was a jerk against his shoulder and it hurt, then a second later a horrible bright light as the faceplate got ripped off. “-Tony, Tony, Jesus fucking Christ, can you hear me? Tony, oh God, what happened? What did you do?”
We should probably talk. Otherwise known as ‘we need to talk’, otherwise known as the number one way to break up with someone. Tony sagged against the counter. He wanted to say yes, but he wasn’t sure the word would even come out whole. So he just hummed his agreement, giving it a few seconds before adding, “That’s fine, yeah.”
Walking out of the door, he slipped the jacket through his arms and tried not to blush when his hands barley reached to the other end of the sleeves. It looked about five sizes too big for him.
Tony looked away. Well—now he could add humiliation to the list of shit that he was currently feeling.  “Yeah,” he mumbled, “yeah, that’s fine. Thank you.”
Tony had always known that. He’d never let anyone try and imply Steve was anything less than a genius. Steve had always been sheepish when Tony brought it up though, shaking his head and putting himself down quietly before hastily moving the subject on.
Steve felt himself blush as the embarrassment began to mount. He wasn’t… quite sure what that had just been, now he was thinking about it. “I was just - confirming something,” he said weakly.
Tony’s hand curled sharply around his wrist, holding him in place; and when he turned back to him the boy was staring up in horror.
Tony took another moment, before shaking his head fondly and then waving a hand. “After you, Rogers,” he responded lightly.
Tony breathed in sharply, looking up at Steve. The man had blood dripping freely from his nose; obviously broken from the headbutting. Aside from that though, he seemed relatively unharmed. “Nat?” He called breathlessly, turning behind him. She was on the floor, one hand around her mangled ankle.
“This doesn’t seem to be working very well, does it?” She crooned softly, fingers tracing the side of his face. “You withstand physical torture rather fantastically. In any other circumstance, I’d be impressed.” Her movements paused and her eyebrow turned upward a little. “Shame. I’d rather hoped we wouldn’t have to get to this stage.”
Steve wanted to say, but he held his tongue and just focused on a little bit of Tony’s hair instead, curling upward awkwardly away from the direction of the rest of his strands. It was cute. He twirled his finger through it and tried not to think too hard about the millions of people who would have watched that video of his boyfriend when he wasn’t even out of his goddamn teens.
“Luckily, you are not most people in any sense of the phrase,” Tony smiled at him and leaned forward on the table, chin resting upon his hand as he picked up his spoon and then scooped up the last chunk of brownie, “a bit of casual objectification means nothing to you.”
up,” Steve snarled, “don’t talk about him like that, you son of a bitch. He’s worth a hundred of you.”
Someone poked him, and he blinked, quickly moving out of the way so more people could get in. At his side, Tony was chuckling. “Good, huh?”
“I have to go help,” Steve said, suddenly remembering the situation at hand. First and foremost, he was a SHIELD agent assigned with a duty to protect the people. And apparently, the people were in danger. “What is the fastest mode of transport from here to Santa Barbara?”
Four days, three hours and 17 minutes ago, they’d been out on a date, and Tony had been playing footsie with Steve under the table, and Steve had told him with a laugh to quit it, and they’d talked about the fact that Doctor Strange had nearly gotten his ass kicked by a magical warlock kid in their last battle, and then Steve had taken them both home and they’d made love.
“NO!” Steve lurched forward and caught Tony’s hand before he could back away any further, shaking his head wildly, “no, that is not what I meant at all. No. No, I want- I want to be in a relationship with you Tony, I swear, a proper one and everything, I was just… I wanted to check we were on the same page,” he stumbled over his words hurriedly, internally cursing himself for wording it so badly.
JARVIS must have thought Steve had been thinking of going to the man responsible. Admittedly, it had crossed his mind. Just walking in and snapping his neck. Or maybe making it hurt more, making him scream, pulling the pain out of his own chest and forcing it into the man who had created it.
“Since when did Tony regulate people’s alcohol intake?” Jane asked, leaning back and smiling innocently.
“The rules are simple,” the woman said in front of him, sat on her chair, shoulders relaxed and lips drawn into a pleasant smile as Steve sagged on his knees a few feet in front of her, bloody and beaten, “until you tell us where The Winter Solider is, we are going to keep hurting you. We are going to keep you on the brink of life and death, begging for release, and
“You are the heart and soul of this team, Tony,” Steve declared, which- okay, he hadn’t been expecting, “without you, you know where we’d be?”
Steve swallowed and looked down. “Sorry,” he murmured, “you were—you were in the workshop, I didn’t want to intrude—”
Steve blinked. He wasn’t sure where he was or how long it had been- or at least, not until he looked outside at the early morning sunlight and then heard someone else’s voice start up faintly from a few feet away on the other side of a wall.
one on my side—you have a hefty kick, I’ll give you that—but apart from some bruises, my statement still stands. I’ve done worse to myself in the lab on my own.”
villains, trying to attack the damn SHIELD helicarrier. Do they want to die? Really? Is that their plan here? Death? Jesus Fucking chr-”
“I-“ Tony finally sounded a little distressed, “Howard, I’m not fucking- God, couldn’t you have called ahead or something, I’m really not prepared to be-“
Placing one last feather-light kiss against Tony’s lips, he swivelled around slowly and then sunk into the space between Tony’s legs; feeling two arms wrap firmly around his hips and tug him in closer as he turned to face the beautiful view ahead of him. It was one of the most amazing sunsets he’d ever seen, left untainted by buildings and the sound of yells or cars. Tony had taken them to a place above all of that.
Well- at least he’d know to avoid him if that was the case, Steve thought. “Two shitheads were trying to ruin some kid’s work. I stepped in. They changed tune and decided to ruin my face instead.”
Steve bristled, resisting the urge to tell him that it wasn’t any of his fucking business. He thought back to the end of everything; Tony’s tired face, the defeated slump of his shoulders when Steve had told him he couldn’t do this anymore, that he was sorry, that it was all too much. They’d been fighting for weeks by that point, Tony working more hours to keep away, Steve going out for days at a time, staying in bars for hours on end and trying to drink until he forgot everything that was plaguing him. Steve privately thought that if they’d kept going any longer, it may well have killed one of them. It really said something about how terrible Steve must have fucking been though, for Tony to not even try fighting it, or argue with him about his decision. Usually, Tony never, ever gave up. Not on anything or anyone. Even if it hurt him.
“Nuh uh, don’t ‘Rhodeybear’ me and then say something self-sacrificial and dumb,” the man cut in, waving a hand, “we’re not leaving, Tony, because leaving would require abandoning you.”
Tony nodded, shoving open the doors and then exiting out into the open air. The cold breeze hit his face, and he bit his lip and pulled out his phone again. Just to double check.
Tony paused, and then turned his head, a soft smile pulling at his face as he registered Steve. “Hey yourself,” he answered quietly as Steve wandered forward, “you’re rather… insufferable, you know that right?”
Tony’s lip curled, and he looked away with a huff. “Peter’s saying our names,” he declared, soft, too soft, he needed to sound
When they rounded his bike, he noticed in surprise that there were two bike helmets locked in place, as opposed to one. He raised an eyebrow at Tony, who just rolled his eyes and threw it his way. “Tired of you giving me dirty looks every time I rode without the helmet,” he said, dropping the cigarette in order to fit the helmet over his head.
“Noted, Troy,” Steve rolled on his heel and turned back around without another word. If they pushed him down the stairs right then, it wouldn’t very convenient, but he just had to hope they weren’t keen on trying to make a scene.
“Is that…” Steve swallowed and dipped his head closer, brushing up against Tony’s nervously, “is that such a bad thing?”
“I told him he should vacate the premises immediately, believe me,” JARVIS spoke quietly, seemingly understanding where Steve’s silence stemmed from, “he would not listen. I’m sorry.”
There was short silence, before Sam pointed an accusing finger in Darcy’s direction. “She started it.”
When he looked up, he caught Tony staring at him. His eyes were a little bit larger than they had been a few seconds previously, and when Steve raised his eyebrows, Tony spun back around and cleared his throat. The collar was higher on the new jacket Tony had on, but Steve would have bet good money that the back of that boy’s neck was bright red.
For the record, he tried to keep a straight face. He really did. It was just… hard, with the memories so fresh in his mind.
Tony hadn’t been flirting with him on the show that night. He swore it. Not... not really, it was only a joke, just like he did with everyone and Steve
Tony paused for a moment. He was still looking at Steve as if he had started talking some obscure foreign language. However, Steve’s body was quickly deciding that sitting up was overrated,  and so after a second he stopped being able to watch the way Tony’s face stared incredulously at him, and instead felt the world begin to drift, light and colour blurring across his vision and creating a slightly nauseating image. His head fell backward, too weary to remain upward, and he resigned himself to the distant thud of pain that was bound to come in a second or two.
“It’s okay, it’s just Clint,” Tony called out to Steve, who just groaned. “What? What did I do, I was only checking-”
However, just as he curled his arm around the back of Tony’s waist and prepared to go south, his work-phone vibrated somewhere over to his left, loud and cutting. Steve paused, frown forming on his face. “I should answer that.”
He shifted ever so slightly, and pain rocketed up his body. He barely held back the cry. “Top of the world,” he gritted out, “is— is everyone okay? Have we made contact with the others yet?”
“I’ve never been the best at risk assessment,” he’d said with a shrug, licking off a stray fleck of cream from Steve’s lip, “but I appreciate the apology muffins anyway. Taste better on your mouth than they do in mine.”
Steve bit his lip, fighting back the urge to clutch Tony a little tighter as the other man leaned into him, hands pressing into the knots of Steve’s shoulders.
“None of that was you, Steve, come on, don’t be dense. Anyway, God, I’m not even talking about the mission. That’s barely even relevant right now. This is just,” Tony waved his hand vaguely, “this is about you always looking out for me. It hit me in Ohio, and it’s been all I could think about since. I couldn’t… I couldn’t be half the man that I am if you weren’t with me. And I know what you think about yourself—I know you might not think you deserve my trust, or that you’re some sort of weapon or monster or whatever—but I don’t. I don’t think
The receptionist paled as he looked down at the letter, barely even reading it. Any threat of a lawsuit—especially one from a man as rich and powerful as Tony Stark—was enough to make any bored nightshift agent cower. He nodded weakly and waved a hand. “Uh, okay. You should… you should probably go through then.”
- you have people. You’ve got all your buddies, you’ve got the Wilsons. And you’ve got me- for when you end up in the deep end and need someone already swimming in there to help pull you out.” He shot off a grin and then pushed the cigarette in between it, before patting his jacket in search of a lighter.
Tony just shrugged, “Bosses word is final,” he told Sam apologetically, and Steve huffed in amusement as their friend just muttered mutinously and then stood back up to go and grab some after-gym cereal, leaving Tony and Steve to themselves once more.
Reed Richards’ lab was cold—that was the first thing Steve noticed. It was steely and filled with large mechanisms, technological pieces and strange devices. There was no couch in the corner of the room, but instead a long, clinically white table with four stools tucked underneath it. Everything was neat, ordered. Steve hated it instantly. But when Reed pulled out a stool for him to sit on, he did so without complaint, watching the other man as he pulled a pen and paper from his desk and then brought it back to the table.
“You think SHIELD won’t know it was you? We’ve got two eyewitnesses that can testify you were with me, one of whom probably has your blood all over his knuckles. They know you broke me out, Steve. I’m sorry. But you’re a fugitive now.”
Tony was silent, and Steve felt him freeze up for a second, before a tiny shift and a small smile. “She was soft,” he said, voice gentle, reverent. “She was… beautiful. Always perfect, was mom. Intelligent. She taught me Italian and sometimes we’d make traditional dishes together, and we’d speak to each other in her mother tongue. She used to tell me it was our secret language- the one Howard would never get to hear.” He choked on another wet laugh, and Tony’s hand slid up Steve’s back, gripping his shoulder instead. “I loved her a lot,” he whispered, “she wasn’t perfect, but she tried for me. She kept… she stopped my dad, kept him in check so that he wouldn’t... she loved me. She was one of the only two people who ever did.” He paused, and Steve felt the way his breath hitched; how he shook when he said “both of them died that night in that car, and that was it. I was- I was fourteen, and that was…”
He felt like Tony was smiling down the line. “Love you too,” he said, before hanging up a few seconds later once they’d said their goodbyes.
“DONE!” Came a familiar voice, and both Steve and Bucky looked up with grins on their faces as Tony stuck his face back out of the door and beamed over to them. His hair was flicking all over his face in the wind, and he had somehow managed to get yet another streak of grease across his neck from the work.
They were both quiet again; Steve watching Tony in concern as the boy seemed to drift off a little bit- but a moment later he was back in the room, shooting a smile Steve's way. "Anyway, Rogers- tell me why on earth you bought a horrible vegan icecream when you quite obviously do not enjoy a single taste of it."
There was silence as Tony paused, and turned his head to look over at Steve. He opened his mouth, undoubtedly to ask
“You know,” Clint said, loud enough that it pulled Tony’s focus away from the two people beside him, “I think he’s really close to saying his first words. I swear to god he managed to get Bruce’s name out this morning.”
“We’re killing them, right?” Tony asked suddenly after the second hour, when they were close to coming to the end of all the data. His voice sounded eerily loud in the silence of the room, and Steve glanced up at him from his tablet, face set grimly, hands white-knuckled.
Steve was okay. He was… he’d be fine. This—whatever it was—was all reversible. If they’d managed to pull Bucky out of it after seventy years of conditioning, then Tony was sure less than 48 hours would be a piece of cake.
Steve looked at him in surprise. He couldn’t have imagined Pepper- with her immaculate dress and perfect ponytail and professional demeanor, sitting in Howard Stark’s office and getting high with Tony. “Really?”
There was a small pause, and then a giggle and a sudden pattering of feet. Steve’s mouth turned up into a smile and he dropped his bag, watching the little whirlwind appear around the corner and rush up to meet him. “Hey Daddy!”
Tony grinned lewdly and plucked the packet of lube out of Steve’s fingers, leaning up to kiss him with a hint of promise. “You know me so well,” he murmured, “now let’s bang while those little embroidered cows watch us from the armchair.”
“Where did Rumlow take Iron Man?” Steve cut to the chase sharply, “I’m Agent Rogers. I was tasked with bringing him in.”
Tony, look. I understand your need for self preservation. I do. But that kid has literally spent his whole life being tortured. So yes- I’m going to hug him when he wants me to hug him, and I’m going to love him as much as I can. His past is his past, and his future will be his future, but right here right now, I am going to give him everything I can. And you’re right. It’s going to suck later. But at least Peter will have learned what it feels like to be cared for, and I won't have to live with the idea that I was just another of his handlers, rather than someone who actually gave a damn.”
“I do not experience feelings of claustrophobia,” JARVIS told him as Steve gingerly picked up the computer. It was heavy, and his arms strained to lift it, but he managed. “Although I must admit, this is one of the less sophisticated exteriors that I have possessed. Due to the nature of Tony’s hasty download, he did not get the chance to open up my system and allow me to expand my reach to any other devices as I am used to doing. It was a straight transfer from his home system to this computer. The base codes that make me the AI I am were transferred, nothing more. I suppose, in human terms, I do feel somewhat… trapped.”
known one another they’d been an unstoppable force, and now, with training and knowledge and comradery on their side, they were damn near perfect.
Tony pulled his head up, and the look on his face was something between smug and seductive as he leaned forward a little. “I know everything, Steve. I’m all-seeing.”
Three hours ago, Tony had been lying on the floor of the sidewalk with a hole in his head, while Steve held him up in his arms and begged him to wake up.
Yeah, Tony could agree with that one. Him and Natasha were the best fit for this sort of thing, he knew that, but still- there were a hell of a lot of things he’d rather be doing. It wasn’t all bad though, he supposed—free coffee and donuts at the snack table, which was always a plus. Although not even they would be able to keep him in this place for much longer. He figured he could spare another hour before calling it a night. After that, he and Nat could just go to a restaurant, catch up, maybe see a bit of Geneva. Not a bad way to spend a day, really.
“Hey, yeah, God, of course I do,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony’s hand tighter around his own and then dropping his head forward, falling into the base of Tony’s neck. “I’m sorry. I didn’t… I didn’t think, I just took one fact and then ran with it, but this- this is completely understandable, okay, I didn’t mean to be an asshole.”
“Nope, don’t worry,” Bruce wandered into their line of sight, patting Steve on the back and slipping onto one of the stools, “we were all perfectly well behaved.”
A few seconds later, he held up the book and showed the dancer a cartoon thumbs-up, hoping it was emphasised enough to be seen across the road.
Steve raised his eyebrows at Thor and then shook his head, bumping their shoulders together. Now the storm had passed, he felt like he was more grounded to Earth again, and he realized quite how cold he truly felt. He was aware that they probably looked like total messes; stood shoulder-to-shoulder in some tiny graveyard, both of them about two sentences away from straight up crying- and yet Steve could only feel strangely grateful that at least he wasn’t alone in his melancholy. Thor was right here with him, standing steady, and showing Steve a part of himself that quite clearly never came out very often. It meant a lot.
wasn’t coming down, and Steve was seriously considering getting a broom and just dislodging the kid-
Steve said desperately, looking up into Tony’s soft brown eyes and hating himself so fucking much, “the point is that I could kill you, so easily! I could kill
Steve just huffed in amusement, looking down at Tony with a gentle gaze. He pressed a delicate kiss to the hickey on Tony’s neck and then slipped out, going to grab a cloth and clean them both up. Afterwards, he pulled on his uniform and left for SHIELD- something about training the new recruits or whatever. Tony, with a relatively free day, decided to just go down to the labs and pester Bruce about his project. He’d been pretty obsessed with it over the past week or so, and Tony was intrigued. It would be a good way to take his mind off all the things he was feeling, too. Science. The solution to every problem.
“You hurt him so badly that they’re saying he’s going to press charges, Steve.” Paul rubbed a hand over his hairless head, eyes screwing shut. “Buddy, we can’t afford to get you a lawyer. What… I don’t know what we’re gonna do.”
“You suck, Van-Dyne,” he mouthed across the room, before flopping back onto the chair and looking at the clock for the billionth time.
“Is Sir okay?” JARVIS asked—and he was a computer program, true, but he still sounded urgent. “I am currently operating within a fixed system. I cannot contact him, as he left his phone in the Stark residence last night. During the last vitals checkup I picked up multiple contusions and a mild concussion, and vast amounts of emotional stress. I have not been able to update my report in over 9 hours.”
They could do this. They could destroy Thanos, once and for all, together. Like they always should have been.
Tony waved him off. “I practically live here, the guys who run it consider me their son. Or annoying cousin, possibly. It’s fine. Ah- there they are!” He yelled, hefting up a box onto the counter and then gesturing for Steve to come over.
He wondered whether he was still unconscious, maybe. This… this wouldn’t even have happened in his wildest dreams. God, he was convinced he’d ruined things irreparably between them even before he’d gone and slept with him for information. Tony had always been too good for a guy like Steve, so when they’d split, Steve had had to live with the gutting acceptance that Tony wouldn’t ever come back. He’d have no reason to.
Steve had to do this with Tony. Because that was what they did. They saved the world- “together, like we should have been the first time.”
“God, it’s been too long, my love,” Tony breathed out, smoke blowing from his parted lips and whipping into the wind around them, lost almost immediately. Steve was caught in the action for a while, eyes wide and mouth a little dry. He wished he’d seen that sight sooner- although, then again, it may have made things an awful lot more uncomfortable, especially if they’d been in public.
“Uh, no- bad idea-“ Steve began, but he was drowned out by Sam’s loud agreements, and only sighed when he watched both his friends push themselves out of their chairs and begin to go pilfering the cupboards. At least Steve had
Steve’s head jerked up, and he watched with an open mouth as his dancer suddenly stumbled out of the main doors to the studio, coat slung haphazardly over his shoulders as he rushed across the street and over toward him.
“Well that just shows a disturbing lack of imagination. I think I may have to take back my previous offer of marriage.”
In response, Steve bit gently at his collar-bone. “Time of my life,” he said with a nod, before looking back down and continuing to map Tony’s skin with his lips, getting lower and lower with each open kiss. Tony just laughed, the sound quickly teetering off into a little hum of pleasure as Steve slid his big hands under the small of Tony’s back, lifting his hips up and then pushing their bodies closer together.
Sam pouted, spearing a fork into his pasta and then glaring daggers at Steve when he laughed. Of course, his amusement was short lived- as soon as Mrs Wilson had left the room, Darcy turned to him with a scary smile on her face, and Steve realized this dinner was going to last a very, very long time.
“Tracked your phone, remember?” Tony smiled at him worriedly, a rain-wet hand pressing lightly into his jaw and tilting his head. His brow creased. “Oh, Steve, what did they do to you?”
Not that he was feeling lucky about constantly seeing Tony. Because he wasn’t. He was…He was just indifferent. Blasé. Casual.
Steve smiled, sitting down gently on the bed. Now Tony was actually here to speak to, Steve wasn’t all that sure of what to say. “Are you back home now?” He asked eventually as his eyes flicked over to the clock, “or are you staying with Thor? Please stay with Thor, Tony, just for a few nights-“
really?” Steve countered sulkily, keeping his arms around Tony’s waist as they swayed at the edge of the sidewalk, undoubtedly pissing off a dozen different commuters as they hurried on by. Steve couldn’t care less. “Japan will move on without you.”
"Neither do we, Barton," Tony waved a hand and then sighed, glancing at the little baby in Clint's arms. His hands were extended, reaching out for Tony in distress. But Tony really did have work, and anyway... it was just some kid. Hardly anything to do with Tony at all, really. "But I bought a load of stuff, and JARVIS has had it delivered into the hallway. There's diapers and a cot and a seat and all that shit, so you have all the equipment. I suggest making him some breakfast and giving him some formula so he doesn't starve in our care. Also," he turned and shot Clint his best smile, "he'll probably need his diaper changing at some point during the day. You have fun with that."
of them. Peter was having to stay for hours, when he should have been getting home to help his Aunt run their cafe. So he was getting into shit at home, too, 'cause his Aunt was getting angry and grounding him, and... yeah. It was just a mess," Tony shook his head again, jaw clenched. "Idiot should have just told me sooner, Jesus," he muttered to himself.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered, covering his eyes with his hands and rocking backward. His hair… his hair was wet, and it was all he could think about. He tasted the disgusting muddy sediment in the back of his throat. Sand… sand was everywhere, except it wasn’t, because he was in New York. “I’m so… Steve, I’m—I don’t, I… I just-“
Fury put the phone down softly and sat back, taking a small, calming breath inward. A lot of thoughts went through his head as he sat in that desk chair. Thoughts of the future. Thoughts of his organisation, and the sickening evidence of something nefarious working underneath it. Thoughts of what he was gonna do to that son of a bitch Rumlow when he got his hands on him. Mainly, though, he thought about the Maldives.
But… but Tony had been laughing at him hours ago. Kissing him. One week, he’d said. One week and he’d come home again.
Tony pulled a face, pushing down about seven different instincts in order to lean forward and wipe at Peter’s mouth. “Disgusting creature,” he informed the baby, shaking his head and sighing. “I should have stuck to my guns and not let Steve win. Would have saved me a lot of pain.”
one. So no, Tony. Unhumans don’t celebrate Halloween. It’s not designed for us. It’s designed at the expense of us.”
He kept his mouth shut. Just until they got Bucky back, and things had settled down. Steve would tell him then.
The grounds were silent, and it was deafening. Steve shut his eyes and brushed a hand over his cheeks, swatting away the droplets gruffly. He wanted, more than anything else in the world, to just be able to hear his mom’s voice. Once more. Wanted to hear the happiness she always carried with her, even through her illness, even through her trouble. She’d never stopped sounding happy.
, he couldn’t. It was there at the forefront of his mind- every memory of Tony’s scared face when they’d been arguing, every bruise he’d put on the other man’s body. Steve was so strong. Tony must have been… terrified. For weeks. Terrified of Steve. Terrified of making a wrong move.
"There was nothing you could have done," Tony tried to tell him when Steve was sent home on leave, hastily brushing the tears off his own face in order to try and lessen Steve's own sorrow. "She made her own decisions, and you aren’t God. This wasn’t your fault."
“He thought you were dating Bucky, and then when you left the room and I immediately started making out with him, he was understandably angry on your behalf” Natasha explained smoothly, and when Steve turned to look at Tony in question, the boy just nodded miserably. Steve hated seeing him like that- he’d been so happy just a minute ago.
Tony sighed and nodded with a roll of his eyes. “Of course, it had to be today. Halfway back from visiting Pep and suddenly it gives up on me in the middle of some road in the middle of nowhere. Not even a fucking phone signal either, so I couldn’t call you. I really am sorry,” Tony told him apologetically.
Steve found himself watching his movements again. It was funny- even off the dancefloor, Tony moved with a sort of grace that was almost hypnotic; all flowing hands and easy strides. He seemed like a person who knew where he was going,
Steve frowned, mouth forming the beginning of a question that never ended up being answered. There was a high-pitched humming noise from behind him, and then suddenly the room was filled with metal parts, all of them flying toward Tony and attaching themselves to his body. Red and Golds whirled like pinwheels in the air, driven forward by some unknown force, and Steve ducked instinctively, but all of them missed him and focused instead on wrapping around the man in front of him, forming a metal skin upon Tony. Cogs fitted into place automatically, locks secured, and mechanisms flickered into action, turning the separate pieces of tech into one single flowing machine. An armour.
Tony looked down at him, and then his knees gave out. He landed on the ground right in front of Steve. From the way his face looked so utterly desolate, Steve knew he’d already made up his mind.
“Oh God, shut up,” he spat at himself as he slammed his hands against the table and then leaned back on his chair. His head was fucking killing him, and he stood angrily from the desk and headed over to the liquor cabinet on the other side of the room. Taking out the closest bottle, he flicked off the cap and then took a large swig, gasping as it burned its way down his throat.
The boy saluted lazily, and then his head dropped back under the table again. Steve just watched him. “Does he do that often?”
Dubious look etched on his face, Steve stayed where he was for one more second, before catching Tony’s eye. “You want him to talk, or would you rather I dragged him back inside and thwacked him over the back of the head?” He asked.
Wordlessly, Steve found his waist and pulled him in close, Tony instinctively tucking his hands up between their chests in the same way he’d always done each time they’d embraced for the past two years. He felt Steve brush his lips across Tony’s hair and inhale again, shaky and relieved at the sense of familiarity.
Tony paused, mouth opening and shutting a few times. He looked back up, over to Zeke who was still braced and ready- then over to the kid by the corner with his wide eyes and messy hair.
“Thank you,” he said honestly, before flicking droplets of water on Bucky’s face and grinning, “-jerk.”
He jumped at the sound of Bucky coming back into the room in his usual brash manner; marching forward until his thighs hit the armrest and he fell face-first into the cushions. Tony blinked, and then dragged his eyes away from Steve, shaking himself a little. “oh- Figlio di
Tony pursed his lips and began walking again. Steve followed, but then stopped when he got something thrown in his face. Hands coming up instinctively, he grabbed hold of the thing that had been chucked over him and frowned. “Why did you just throw your jacket at me?”
“I’ve got a plan!” Steve declared, shifting Tony off his lap and then stumbling upright away from the couch. He turned back around to look at Tony, and then a second later Tony watched in amusement as Steve tentatively dropped lower, getting to one knee. It took a few attempts for him to find his balance, and Thor had to help him in the end, but after about thirty seconds he’d gotten it, and he looked up at Tony with a huge smile on his face.
So he just waved at Tony as he walked off, watching the other boy grin and wave back- and for a moment he wasn’t the coolest guy in school about to head out for a smoke behind the science block- he was just Tony, the blushing idiot who got tongue-tied when Steve kissed him and always fiddled with his bangs when he got flustered.
He hadn’t even thought about it before, but the suit really had been his safety net this whole time. The thing that kept all his friends placated, kept them civil. They probably
He listened half-heartedly as she and Sam talked, but his mind was on other things. For example- the phone he was currently texting Tony on from under the table. And what he was going to do for his birthday on Saturday. And whether or not Tony would like his friends. And whether or not Tony would like the party.
Steve had looked at him for a long time as he’d weighed up what to say. He couldn’t even let on that Tony had been kicked out thanks to Stone—schools were legally obligated to report that, and if Tony was moved across the country to the Godfather that he said was worse than Howard…
“I’m still fucking mad,” he said, voice muffled by Bucky’s T-shirt. Bucky’s arms came around him immediately, holding onto his shoulders and gripping tight.
He bent down and scooped Peter up into his arms, jiggling him up and down playfully and listening to the boy burble happily against his chest. Steve followed behind them, and Tony saw the smug look in the reflection of the mirror. “
He stood straight, placing the papers back on the desk and trying not to look at the mathematics scribbled over them for too long, unless he fancied a melted brain. He couldn’t help but grin a little, looking to the ceiling for lack of anywhere else to pin JARVIS to. “I get the feeling that apology isn’t as genuine as it sounded.”
“It was close enough! Don’t undermine Pete’s hard work like that,” Clint leaned forward and looked at Peter seriously while the boy picked up a piece of meat and tried (and failed) to make it reach his mouth. “Say ‘Bruce Banner’ for me, squirt. Prove all these fuddy-duddy’s wrong.”
Well. At least Tony knew that Steve still liked the idea of marrying him five years on. Although he was probably going to yell at Steve in the morning for forgetting he was married in the first place. Quietly, though. Because poor Steve was going to wake up feeling a little hungover, and Tony was a good husband who didn’t fancy cleaning up vomit.
In the interrogation room Steve was staring into, Rumlow shifted, drawing Steve’s attention to him. The intimidating man was circling the room slowly, a smug smile on his face. Tony wasn’t watching him though. He was just staring impassively into the mirror, expression slack. However, Steve noted the minute tense of his shoulders as Rumlow passed directly behind him. He was nervous.
“If that transmission was sent from somewhere, we can follow the signal back. I can go find him,” Carol said firmly, lighting up her fists and nodding her head. “If he said day thirteen, then the message is five days old. Universally speaking, if it only took five days to cross the distance, it cant be that far away. I can get to him.”
“That guy’s got a mean aim,” Bucky grumbled as he jimmied a screwdriver into his arm with a frown, “I pissed him off and he nearly blew my damned head off from a hundred yards away.”
Yeah- enhanced senses and all. Tony nodded in acknowledgement, and pushed any fear right down in the place where it usually went. Steve was going to be fine. They were going to get him out and work through whatever it was that had happened here. It would all be okay.
Steve’s eyes bulged. “Am I okay?” He hissed, “Tony, you just… why the hell did you do that to yourself? Are you crazy?” His voice was wheezy and he tried to sit up indignantly but didn’t quite manage to find the strength, and a second later he too crumbled back to the floor with a grunt.
“I love you, you big idiot,” Steve wrapped him up a littler tighter, nose pressing against Tony’s temple as he smiled down at his hopeless boyfriend, “and no, please don’t buy Polaris. That wasn’t a request, or a challenge-”
Clint and Sam began bickering at the table, but Steve was already pushing himself away and beginning to try and navigate himself through the crowds. Natasha watched him go with a raised eyebrow; he saw her out of the corner of his eye, but didn't acknowledge it. He wasn't really sure what his goal was- maybe he just wanted to see. Maybe he was curious.
Steve smiled, but then pushed Tony away gently, which was not what he wanted at all. Tony went, though- pouting the entire way, mind you.
He and Cap made their way through the front entrance, following the trail of destruction that the attackers had left. There were SHIELD agents lying lifeless on the floor, and he saw Steve’s eyes catch on them as they moved past. Like Tony had said; this facility wasn’t for combat. It was mostly science and research, and the minimal trained fighters they had hadn’t been able to stand up against the enhanced enemy. Anyone else still in the building would either be valiantly trying to hold back the wave of attackers, or hiding out.
Ty was removed pretty swiftly from his vicinity before any punches managed to get landed however, and Steve watched in surprise as a blur of leather jacket and dark hair rushed in front of Steve, grabbing Ty by the neck of his sweater and then yanking him sideways, shoving him into the nearby wall. Sam and Clint were at his side a moment later and he turned in surprise, looking at all his friends as they barged through the crowd and found him.
Thor licked his lips, holding his posture for another moment before just shrugging and then slumping back down again. He looked so relieved, and there was gratitude deep in his eyes as he patted Steve on the shoulder.
“That’s not what Ty was saying!” Steve threw his hand back in the direction of the corridor, “Tony, please- this is bigger than just us-“
Tony smiled and then repositioned his arm into a more comfortable location, then leaned up on his tiptoes and kissed his cheek, stopping to flick Peter on the nose along the way and make the boy’s face crinkle up adorable. “Perfect,” he agreed with a nod of his head. Steve smiled down at him, soft and gentle, and for a moment Tony wondered what this could be like if it was real. If this was actually something he and Steve could have, one day. To keep.
Michael sighed. “Please, we don’t have to make a big deal out of this, guys. We know that you have a child on the premises. Multiple people have made calls to say as such. Just make life easier and tell us where he is, and we can move forward without having to take legal action.”
annoyed at it- Tony wasn't exactly leaping for joy at this development either, but it wasn't the end of the goddamn world. Did kids really make Steve that uncomfortable? Or was it just the idea of a kid in the room with him and Tony? It seemed like it could be a gateway for some conversations about future plans, potentially, but... well, it didn't have to be weird. And- and they'd been together for three years now; was the concept of a child being there really
“Here, just- Oh, Lord,  just come here, Steve Rogers,” Tony said, and yeah, Steve could definitely hear the laughter in his voice now; the dry way in which he said Steve’s full name, and Jesus Fuck, Steve couldn’t even feel angry, Tony’s voice was just so lovely-
Clint snorted. “That’s God’s way of telling you off for not taking on any responsibility for him over the past two days,” he said with a cocked eyebrow, and Steve turned to him in irritation, mouth opening in a (pretty useless) attempt at defending himself, but Thor stepped in between them before anything could flare up and raised his hands.
Tony leaned over, humming absently and tugging the helmet of the lock. Turning around, he glanced up at Steve, still stood still a few feet away at the entrance. “You coming?” He raised an eyebrow, looking amused once more.
Glancing at his watch as he stepped out the door, Steve realised that they’d been there for three hours, and the night had crept around them very quickly in that time. It had already gone seven, and Steve found himself sighing at the prospect of having to catch the nightmare buses at this time. So instead, he turned to Thor and shot the boy his best and most innocent smile.
that Tony was convinced Steve could just lick his face for ten minutes and he’d still get turned on by it. It was a little sad, honestly, but at this point Tony just needed to look at the boy’s lovely, angular,
Tony kissed his chest and then brushed his fingers across the mark absently, smiling up at him with a look of softness etched over his face. “If it helps,” he said quietly as he took Steve’s hand and locked their fingers together with a gentle caress of his fingers, “I’m thinking sappy things too.”
Checking the time on his watch for the thirtieth time that hour, he sighed when he saw the time in front of him. Tony was now running 48 minutes late and counting, and had yet to send any of them a message as to why.
This question hurt. Why couldn't he just leave the topic? Why was he bringing it up with such persistence? He should have known for a long time that it was hurting both of them. This time he crossed the line. Tony felt something break in him. He couldn't stand it anymore, he had to finally throw it all out.
Oh, so he was the one that was something wrong with? So getting into an affair with someone for whom you might as well be a father is completely normal? Damn it!
The pharmacist almost fainted from the horror when he bought hypertension and sleeping pills, but fortunately, she neither lost consciousness nor called the police. She behaved very bravely for someone who was dealing with Iron Man for the first time.
"Hush," Tony silenced him. "We don't have to hurry, right? We can take small steps and see how it goes."
"They had to just arrive. I will go greet them. Maybe I will drop them at Coulson and show them around the school right away,” Rhodey called enthusiastically, abandoned the book and ran toward the new students. Nothing unusual; after all, who would like to read "History-of-weapons-and-military-just-another-bland-edition"?
"You don't have to, I can handle them," said Clint, giving Tony a warm smile. "Just let me know when you will do the next batch. I will give you a few arrows that I use usually."
Tony Stark laughed and threw himself at the handsome soldier. He had to stand on his toes to get into his mouth, but it didn't matter. Rogers' lips were wonderfully soft and hungry as if he had not had the opportunity to use them right for a long, long time.
"Won't you stay?" His father was surprised as if he had no idea that he had just destroyed his son's life. No, wait, he really didn't know he did that. "I thought you should get to know each other better. You know, Steve will be visiting us quite often now..."
It doesn't matter. Stark didn't have time to think about it. He may not have known all of the psychological nuances of being in a relationship. But he could easily see the impatience and worry in the eyes of the stranger. Another moment and Tony will lose the opportunity to change the date with his own hands for something much more...
Hearing this, Rogers blushed, put down his plate quickly and, smiling shyly, apologized to Tony, and simply fled. And that would be enough when it comes to intelligent conversation.
Normally, Clint wouldn't have given up after a few blunt remarks, but this time Bruce poked his hip slightly and winked, and they both left.
"Enough, Stark," hissed Steve. Where did his anger come from? It didn't even involve him. "How can you take your life in so lightly?"
"I would suggest that you should leave the bathtub because the water has completely cooled down and you may catch a cold, sir."
Tony didn't allow himself to blush. He glanced at the kitchen counter on which his artificial intelligence was in control of everything, along with the mechanical arm of far less intelligent Dummy. If his father was at home more often, he would know that such a view was something completely normal. Besides, Steve had the right to be surprised, but his genius father? Tony shrugged dismissively.
"Natalie and Steve..." To drown out his possible refusal, Pepper switched to machine-gun mode. "We also wanted to get Clint and Bruce, but Bruce has some super-secret, super-important project to finish, and Clint has some watch to handle. I asked him if David and Pamela will be there and he had no idea what I meant! Can you imagine? When did he grow up? So what, Tony? Are you going?"
Maybe it was supposed to be like that? Maybe it wasn't the one and only person that would change Tony's whole life? After all, he knew nothing about Steve. Besides the fact he was a miracle created by some mysterious serum and that he had an affair with his father. And he didn't even stay with him long enough to finish his toast.
Stark very slowly turned his head and felt everything soften in him and begun to spin at a dizzying pace. He wanted to look away, but he couldn't. Steve acted on him like a magnet; once pulled to him, Tony was unable to escape.
"Sure, why not," Tony agreed quickly. "Is this not a problem? After all, my house is at the end of the street, it got completely dark, you're not going anywhere else?" He sputtered words like rifle bullets The only reaction, however, was the growing terror in the soldier's eyes. With each letter, Stark was getting farther away from his desired goal, and there was no indication that he would ever achieve it.
"No." Damn it. Did he really say that? Tony took a deep breath and faced the army of children and their far too tempting guardian. "I don't have candies."
"It doesn't look like a prototype, Agent Coulson," Fury said. "I'd rather say it's a finished product," he looked at Tony so attentively and penetratingly that the boy had a sincere desire to sink into the ground. "Tell me, Stark, how did you build something like that without Coulson noticing?"
He leaned closer to him, put his hands on his shoulders, and carefully bit his lower lip. Rogers, as if just waiting for it, embraced him tighter and moved him closer, then slipped his tongue between Tony's lips. Tony sighed with pleasure. He did not expect that such discreet motivation could change so much.
"It's a phone number," he choked, as the lazy caffeine slowly formed the digits into meaningful information. "He left me his number!" Tony called, then laughed.
With each passing moment, Steve was more and more possessive. He alternately sucked and bit Tony's lips, combed Tony's hair with his fingers, shyly massaged his chest. Stark tried to repay him the same, but it soon came to him that he had completely lost control of the situation. He didn't even object when Steve picked him up and carried to his room.
As a sign of the newly made bond, they shook hands and exchanged meaningful smiles. Everything would be perfect if Clint didn't decide to return to their earlier conversation.
Tony concluded that armor would get him to school the fastest. It wasn't that he wanted to test it again. After all, the fresh paint could crack, so it was clear that he was guided only by the safety of his friend.
Ah, this disgust on his grim face! Wonderful! Tony loved to speak by name to all adults who did not dare to forbid him for his father's sake. Especially those who hated it. And especially Coulson.
He wrapped himself tightly in a soft red bathrobe and slid slippers onto his wrinkled feet. His evening set lacked only toast baked with white cheese and honey and hot cocoa. And that meant Tony had to go on a terribly long journey to the kitchen.
Well, whoever was supposed to be the owner of the arrows, for their own safety, better not shoot at Tony Stark.
"Tony... you know you can't run forever, right?" Rhodey asked, looking up from the book at his friend, who at first glance decided to use the shadow cast by an old maple and take a nap between classes. Well, that's what somebody who doesn't know Tony would think.
Pepper Potts frowned, which was a very clear warning. "You underestimate me again, Stark!" she seemed to scream. And she was right, of course. If it was enough to view the cameras records to catch the thief, Potts wouldn't wake up her boss at all. Tony took a deep breath. He was completely sober (exceptionally), so he didn't suspect himself of misjudging Rogers. Sure, he certainly wasn't an outstanding psychologist, he obtained PhDs in completely different fields of science, but he wasn't that stupid.
The bell rang the first time, then the second. And then again and again. Tony closed his eyes and cursed severely. There was no indication that the kids would let go. Of course not. Damn it, that's why he hated Halloween. Like most of the "warm and family" holidays. Yes, Christmas too.
When the fucking pizza-delivery guy stepped forward to put his word in, Tony finally put his foot down, yelling loudly and slicing his hand through the air to silence them all.
He talked amicably amongst his friends for twenty minutes or so, before excusing himself to head back to art class where he’d left his folder. His project still wasn’t done yet, and the assignment had to be handed in by the end of the week, so he was going to be having to cut a few lunches short just to find the time to complete the damned thing.
Tony was aware of his plan- he knew it was really supposed to be tomorrow that he put out all the stops and then, well,
They looked at each other silently for a few seconds; Steve barely even managing to find it in himself to be embarrassed. There was just something about Tony that made him want to stare and stare and stare. He hadn’t touched his sketchbook since- well, about six months- but whenever he watched Tony move, or saw him smile, or just stared at him like he was now… it all came back. Like a wave. He just wanted to sit Tony down and draw every part of him; the bow of his lips and the curve of his smile and the angles of his beautiful hands-
“Hey, hey,” Tony’s mouth turned upward, and he looked sideways to Steve, raising an eyebrow, “in all fairness, I promised to get all your stuff back of my own accord. Everything I’ve done for you has been of my own accord, actually, so don’t go getting all guilty on me Rogers. I think after acting like an asshole yesterday, I'm sort of deserving of the ass-beating I got.”
“Illegally,” Peggy told him with a grin, “I mean, that’s assuming we’ll even manage to set off when all of us are in it. I’m betting it’ll just fall apart as soon as Thor touches it. It looks like it’s made of tinfoil.”
There was a long silence, as all of them stared. Across the table, Natasha’s back straightened. “Could be coincidence,” Bruce tried, but everyone shook their heads immediately.
They stayed there, up on the roof for another hour, until the sun was well below the horizon and the skies had turned dark. Neither of them wanted to move, but eventually Tony persuaded him that it was probably for the best, if only to keep his friends from worrying. So they’d made their way back to Tony’s bike practically melded to one another- neither wanting to let go, even for a second.
“I’m sorry,” he said again, “I’m sorry for… all of this. I just…” he clenched his hands on his lap and looked out of the window. “There are some really awful people at my school. I got angry.”
Steve glanced down at Tony, who was listening to the conversation with a strained face and a tight mouth. Steve felt cold. He hated talking about… well. The whole of 2016, really. It had all been a shit show.
“Nope,” Steve interrupts his thought process, shaking his head vigorously and putting a finger against Tony’s mouth. “You… you have
He stared in shock as Tony bit his lip and then looked away, trying to play it off with a roll of his eyes. When he turned back to Steve, his face was carefully nonchalant. “I just didn’t want to freak you out, that was all-“
Clint made a face, and Tony shot him the bird absently before flopping down into Steve’s lap and curling in. “Mmmmf,” he groaned into the shoulder he’d pressed his face into, glad of finally having somewhere decent to sit. The floor only served as a viable seat for so long.
They were both silent again, and Steve felt Tony’s fingers squeeze softly around his own- reminding him that he hadn’t actually let go since grabbing him a minute ago. When he looked back up, Tony was smiling at him. A sad smile, yeah- but it was better than nothing. It was more than what anyone else could have given, simply because Tony… Tony got it.
But she would be wrong. Because this… it was all on him, and he damn well knew it. And if he didn’t hear what had happened that night, it was going to drive him mad.
“Yeah- just don’t touch the big machine in the middle of the room,” Steve gritted out sullenly, “it packs a punch.”
The faceplate lifted. Steve briefly wondered whether Tony would have had to stick his arm out of the window and wave it around for a little bit while he and Rumlow had been fighting in order to find a signal. That would have been funny to watch. “Alright. Okay, just hold on, Steve. I’ll get you out of here, I promise.”
He turned back to Ty, shoving past some random kid that tried to get in his way. Ty was bleeding heavily from his nose and forehead, but he swung a punch to Steve that on any other occasion, he probably wouldn’t have been fast enough to stop. “You little bitch!” The boy hissed as Steve ducked low. His fists curled into Steve’s shirt and hauled him sideways, propelling them both until Steve hit the wall with a painful thud.
“Yeah, and you’re clearly not getting shit out of him, are you?” Steve responded coldly, resisting the urge to swing and hit the bastard right in his gnarly face. “So why don’t I try, and then we’ll see where that goes, huh?”
Tony went blank at that, and Steve hurried to justify himself. “I’m sorry, it’s pathetic, I know it is- that’s what I was saying last night, Tony, I wasn’t talking about you, I swear, I was talking to
Once he felt like he wasn’t being crushed quite so much, the email in front of him was brought back to the forefront of his thoughts. He had to finish it and get it off before midnight at the very least, otherwise about three different people would start yelling at him. Shaking fingers steadied themselves back onto the keyboard, and he lost himself in the steady clicking of keys, not bothering to proofread it before sending the email off five minutes later. He doubted it was even coherent, but hell, at least he’d done it. One little task ticked off the list, only eight hundred more to go.
“Sir, please-“ JARVIS started, the same anxious tone he had been speaking in ever since Tony had arrived on the roof, but Tony just cut in to whatever he was about to say with a swift slash of his hand.
They both worked, again, in silence, for about a minute or so, until all was clean and well again. Steve knew he was shaking, and he wasn’t sure whether it was from the freezing water dripping down his neck or something else, but when he stood up he made sure to ignore the urge to shudder. He could handle a little rain.
His breath wheezed out through a tight throat and he forced himself not to panic, to turn his emotion into strength as he traversed the mountain as fast as he could. He had a direction to head in now. He’d been calling out all night to see if he could get a response, but gunfire was a far louder alternative and the more of it Steve heard, the more precise his direction became. But with each bullet, the terror rose. Any one of them could have planted themselves in a chest, in a head. Tony, Nat, Rhodey, Bruce. He wasn’t sure how well any of them were armed. Had they managed to pick up any weapons along the way? Or were all these shots from the enemy?
“Tony, I am pleased you’ve arrived safely. Please I need your power. The rebels have been hindering this colony for far too long now. Tell me, will we succeed in annihilating them?” Red Diamond asked, his voice was deep yet smooth.
Thor suggested bringing some Asgardian mead from his home world. That was something Tony might actually like.
“Hmm BLT with a generous amount of hot sauce and cut into triangles” Tony said analyzing the sandwich then opening the zip-lock and took a big bite. He moaned as he bit into it.
“Yeah, Wanda was there too but she left with Vision for patrol” Steve explained when Tony asked “Yeah, that’s her lipstick right?” Tony pointed to his cheek as the elevator opened. Steve was again embarrassed and tried to rub off the kiss mark, which he didn’t know was there in the first place. Tony just laughed at him.
“Steeeeeeeeeve! Tony called out as he ran arms wide open towards Steve. Tony jumped and fell on Steve who managed to catch him before they could brutally collide.
Tony closed the sketch book and turned to Steve, smiling with the biggest smile Steve had ever seen him with. “I LOVE IT!” Tony said flinging himself at Steve wrapping him in a big hug. Then he jolted away as fast, patting Steve’s shoulder. “I mean, ehem, it’s great Steve. Thank you” Tony said casually but he was blushing from embarrassment.
Tony’s powers had always been a guiding force in his life as have other Sapphires and to have someone alter the future the way Ruby Steve did, it through him in a loop. His visions have always had a higher chance of happening compared to other gems with his type of ability. At that moment he could see, couldn’t hear, speak or move; he was frozen; literally.
“In essence everyone is bisexual in nature; society has dictated which gender is right for the other. I do not believe this is so.” Thor stated as if he was debating with someone, maybe he has before..
"I'm a failure as a Ruby! I couldn't even protect my Sapphire!" Steve said in agitation as he kicked the ground he was pacing on.
“Steve! Steve! Cap! Rogers!” voices were heard as he shut his eyes. When he opened them he saw hazy figures and a white sky. He jumped to his feet in a fighting stance only to be met with reality.
Getting into his car he made sure to check Steve’s jogging routes to see if there would be any areas or routes he could take to minimize the possibility of bumping into him, a red and gold Lamborghini in not something that say inconspicuous. Steve was diligent with his routines so Tony had no problem finding a good route. He made it home with zero Steve in sight and made his way inside the garage and parked.
It's been a while. I was thinking how to go about this so here's a part of it. I will post another in a few days.
“Thanks” Tony said drinking from the warm mug. Steve smiled and drank from his own. They made small talk that was soon directed to their individual nightmares. Steve’s was still dreaming about the ice and the life he left behind. Tony’s was infinite darkness and drifting off into deep space for all eternity.
“Do you, uh still want to kiss me?” Tony asked shyly. “Is that even a question?” Steve said happily and in just a second Steve’s lips were on Tony’s. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and drew him closer deepening there kiss and Steve held him closer making there bodies press together tightly that they could melt into each other.
“S-Steve, I heard you were singing and I-I, was that song about me?” Tony asked as he clung to Steve sounding sad.
“That’s nice, but Steve? Thanks for helping me out with everything and I got two of the best gifts in the world! No! The whole Universe and in existence!” Tony cheered raising a fist in the air. Steve chuckled at that. “I only gave you one gift?” Steve asked pleasantly curious. Tony moved up a bit and gave Steve a soft kiss.
“Need help? First let me get a snack you distracted me a while ago and I’m still hungry” Steve gave him a grin walking back to the kitchen and fixed himself with the sandwiches he was making a while ago. He took them to the living room and he even got Tony a mug of his favorite coffee. He saw Tony rummaging through his supplies as he entered.
“You’re smiling, May I ask why the good captain would want to give a gift to someone such as Tony Stark?” Wanda asked a bit of teasing was evident in her voice. Steve blushed.
“You have feelings for Steve other than the platonic best friend relationship right?” Bruce said calmly.
Steve just nodded. Tony grinned and scooted over to Steve. He took hold of Steve’s arm and draped it across his body; Steve just let him do as he pleased.
He was startled from his thoughts when he felt something land on his shoulder; it was peppers hand. She had apparently arrived moments ago upon hearing Tony wake up and rushed to the hospital immediately, evident with her tussled up hair and crumpled blouse.
“I have stuff to do so I get a free pass today and If I didn’t feed you you’d just drown yourself in caffeine and candy again” Steve said with a smirk raising his own eyebrow.
It happened a few weeks ago when Tony suddenly changed. He was distancing himself from Steve and the others but mostly Steve. He didn’t let Steve go in the lab anymore. They only interacted through missions and Tony would leave after that. Steve was missing the feeling of being with Tony.
“You are welcome” Thor smiled at him sipping his own drink. Tony smelled his and it smelled familiar. He tasted it and was surprised. “This is what you made me yesterday right?” Tony said in awe. Thor just grinned at him with pride. He rummaged through the bag again and took out a few pastries and sandwiches too. “This is wow, Thanks Thor, Do I owe you anything?” Thor just shook his head smiling” It’s my treat”
“Thanks Bruce, I, I’m sorry you had to see me like that” Tony said embarrassed and he wiped his hand on his shirt.
A gem shrouded in a red cloak sat on a throne, his face was hidden underneath the cloak. His gem was located in the center if his chest.
“Never mind Tony, Good night” Steve said in a rush to get back to his room but Tony reached for his arm.
“You aren’t going to open it?” Steve asked curious. “I’d hate to ruin the wrapping” Tony admitted shyly. “Just cut the bottom half and slide it out, then you save the wrapping but still get your gift” Steve suggested smiling. “oh yeah! Why didn’t I think of that?!” Tony said a bit excited. “Some genius” Steve said in a teasing way. “I’m just gonna let that one slide” Tony said looking for the scissors.
It was quiet between them but Steve broke it with a simple question, “Tony? Do, do you want to lie down together? Tony looked at Steve as he’d grown a second head. Steve looked away a slight flush on his face.
“Steeeve! STEVE!! Help me please! I don’t want to be alone.” Steve struggled and the darkness that was binding him lost it’s grip as he made his way to where Tony was. “Tony! I’m coming! He ran as fast as his legs could go but he couldn’t even get close, The darkness wrapped itself around Tony more as it pulled him in.
He felt at home and at peace when he was with Tony. They came from bickering acquaintances to close friends or at least that’s what Steve thought.
“You don’t have to deal with this on your own Tony, Science Bros right?” Bruce said raising a fist. “Yeah, Science Bros!” Tony said bumping his fist with Bruce’s.
It was dark, really dark. Steve couldn’t see anything. Every way he turned; darkness. He called out but his voice only echoed in the darkness. He started walking, his feet stepping on solid darkness as he tried to make sense of where he was.
“Thanks a lot Bruce, I promise to help with whatever project you’re working on” Tony said encouragingly. Bruce just gave him a smile as he left the room.
He pushed off the locker and tucked the note in his jacket pocket. He picked up the bag Steve dropped off and went to class.
“Thank you Thor, that means a lot.” When Thor let go, Tony gave him a hug which Thor happily returned.
Steve chuckled and got a bit more comfortable. The room was cast in a soft blue light from Tony’s reactor. Steve looked at Tony’s chest with interest.
In their talk they started talking about what their lives were before everything and at some point Steve had held Tony’s hand as Tony started tearing up with memories from the past. Steve did too and soon they found themselves relieved of their fears just with their simple talk.
“I could not find ones that fit you but these might do, they are a bit snug for me but maybe they’d work for you.” Thor handed him a bundle of clothes that comprised of a pair of shorts and a large tee, a tooth brush and a towel were there too. Tony thanked him and stepped in the bathroom. The tee was large on Tony as well as the shorts but they felt comfortable and smelled nice, kind of like the scent of rain, Tony stepped out and saw Thor had changed too and was sitting on the sofa reading a book. He was wearing a tee shirt with a lightning bolt on it and a pair of pajama pants with the same print. Tony couldn’t help snickering. He placed his clothes on the table beside and sat beside Thor.
Upon reaching the Milkyway galaxy and arriving to a planet unlike they had ever seen before; Earth. A great rift within their political hierarchy erupted as many who had seen Earth had refused of its colonization which led to the first Homeworld War. An event wherein one of the highest Officials objected to the colonization of Earth and with the aid by those under the official defected from Homeworld and sought to protect the Earth.
“My Father provided me with this room” Thor said as they stepped in. Please make yourself at home; I’ll just prepare a few things.” Thor said entering the bedroom.
He made a quick stop at his locker to get back the containers Steve left with him. There were still a few muffins and sandwiches left. He couldn’t swallow past the guilt but maybe, he and Steve could share what’s left like they used to.
When he got there he saw he wasn’t the only one who wasn’t getting any sleep. Tony was sitting on a stool beside the kitchen counter. He was rubbing his temples in an effort to soothe his raging thoughts as a steaming mug of coffee sat in front of him. He didn’t even notice Steve coming in.
“Tony? What were you really doing?” Steve asked softly. Tony looked at him a bit startled, he then looked away embarrassed. “I wanted to decorate for my B-day, to you know to do something different this year?” He nervously admitted. This was a side of Tony Steve never got to see. Tony being embarrassed and shy. He just smiled fondly.
Thor Odinson was a transfer student from Norway. He’s in some the school’s sports club such as American football, track and field and a few others. He’s larger in physique compared to Steve but as others would describe him; he’s a gentle giant. Thor is also the theatrics club at S.H.I.E.L.D high and a few literary clubs as well. He often speaks in a form of very old very Shakespearean way of speaking, like something straight from the book but he’s understandable most of the time. He’s very friendly and clueless at times but he’s a pretty nice guy all in all.
Tony thought”I, don’t know. I could’ve done things differently like tell him he’s a man now or whatever but-” Tony said slowly.
They sat in comfortable silence as Steve dug into his food and Tony just looked around the room trying to figure out where to put up the decorations. When Steve finished they got to work decorating the room.
Tony just raised his hand, “I saw it happening, don’t worry too much” He gave Steve a reassuring smile and set his expression straight as he was about to enter their commanders station. “I must attend to my duties now” he said with certainty. His Rubies straightened at that but Steve looked concerned for some reason.
Tony smiled as he read the letter but faltered as he read the part about Steve.. Jarvis was always so caring and thoughtful. He ate what he could and made his way to his room to bathe and change before going to class. He checked his messages and sure enough Steve left him a dozen.
“There he is the one with the blue gem on his chest!” Onyx announced. Black pearl was in front of Tony in seconds. She raised her sword to cut through Tony. Steve was horrified as he tried to get up to reach Tony in time.
They sat down and immediately Thor dug in. Tony just chuckled at that, it reminded him of Steve. Steve, he was thinking of Steve again. Steve was always a heavy eater but it didn’t show. He was scrawny growing up but now he was quarterback and a complete jock. He was suddenly roused from his thoughts when he heard his name being called. Tony shook his head and focused. Thor was looking at him in concern.
“Get some more rest Steve, we’ll alert you if anything happens” Bruce said giving Steve a glass of water. Steve drank it it a few gulps not letting go of Atony’s hand.
Steve held on to Tony’s hand a bit longer before letting go. Sleep slowly started to fill them as they found comfort with each other. Steve was still slightly awake when Tony came closer practically resting his head on Steve’s bare chest, his mustache and beard giving Steve a tickling sensation. With what’s left of his consciousness he wrapped Tony up in his arms as Sleep came over him.
With a burst of energy Steve leaped up to push Tony out of the way; he succeeded but what happened next brought everyone to complete shock; their gems fused. Steve felt energy flow through him and with that energy he carried Tony at super speed away from the pearl. Onyx Nick was also stunned but he got past it in time to sense they were about to be cornered.
He learned to cope, he adapted but not alone. He needed help and he got it. From S.H.I.E.L.D, his team mates and someone very special; Tony Stark. Tony and Steve got off to a rocky start but after a while they warmed up to each other and ultimately they became great friends. Tony teaching Steve about the future and Steve helping Tony cope with his past.
Ruby Steve looked around, the area they landed in was a field of grass surrounded by mountain ranges. The sky was also raining down on them. He looked over at Tony who had an expression of confusion plastered across his face.
Every so often his mind would venture to thoughts of Steve (unintentionally). It’s only been a day but it felt a lot longer than that.  He’s discovering all of the hidden feelings he’s had for Steve but the reality is; Steve’s out of reach. Would things still be the same between them? Would it change a lot between them? Tony for the first time admits; he doesn’t know the answer.
Steve’s bed was big to accommodate his size and roomy for him to move around him. He didn’t need to turn on a light, Tony’s reactor casting a soft blue glow gave them enough light to not bump into anything. They stood their awkwardly until Steve turned away to take of his shirt.
They lapsed in comfortable silence until Thor asked “You’re avoiding Steve aren’t you?” Thor asked and Tony stopped mid bite into an éclair. Tony sighed in defeat “Yeah just for a little while” Tony said biting off a piece of the éclair. “He seems troubled today. I saw him before and he had this look, one of sadness and disturbance”.
“I, love, Steve? I guess I do love him” Tony said with small smile. “But, Steve doesn’t love me.” Tony said defeated as he felt his eyes starting to water again.
Tony stopped mid sip and slowly looked up. ”Was it that obvious?” Tony asked looking away rubbing his mouth with a napkin from the tray.
“I, I don’t know Thor. Honestly I do. I have to think on things but for now I have to talk to Steve. I want; no I need to tell him. He’s my best friend and I don’t want things between us going south just cause I have feelings for him.” Tony said taking Thor’s hands away from his face, Thor held onto his.
With just the two of them and everything that happened earlier, there was a bit of awkwardness in the air that Tony quickly broke.
Tony was both the school’s greatest asset and its destroyer. He creates mechanical wonders that have benefited the school and its students but often than not leaves the school’s labs either blown up or in disarray but he survives though being the child of an extremely wealthy family helped pay for any damages to the school.
He stepped in and there was a bell on top of the door and he was greeted with the smell of coffee, sweets and a booming welcome. He knew that voice; Thor. And he was right. Behind the counter was none other than Thor Odinson. He couldn’t mistake the large physique, wide beaming smile and loud booming voice.
“Good morning sir, quite early I see. I was expecting you at a later time. Shall I make you breakfast?” Jarvis asked as Tony made his way to his workshop.
It was the eve of Tony’s birthday and Steve was getting his present ready for tomorrow. He’s spent most of his off time working on his gift and with the load the Avengers had to deal with were dealt as fast as they came. It was a miracle that nothing major, end-of-the-world catastrophes had occurred within that time leaving Steve with enough time to get his gift ready.
Steve’s face was a myriad of emotions, surprise, realization, embarrassment, anger and he may be wrong but he also saw pain as well.
“TONY!!!!” Steve yelled at the top of his lungs as he struggled. Suddenly he felt pain on his side and dark tentacles wrapping him in darkness.
Tony opened his newly created app and a map of the area popped on his phone screen. He typed in Steve’s number and waited. A glowing red dot showed him where Steve was; he was still at home. Tony rushed to his car picking up the lunch Jarvis made him and got into his car. He chose a simple one today as to be inconspicuous. Suddenly the dot was moving and Tony paused getting in his car. The dot was coming to the direction of his house and it meant Steve was coming. He went back inside hiding in the first floor bathroom.
He looked it up and it was decent by the way it looked in the pictures. It just opened up a month ago, so it wouldn’t be too popular to warrant a big number of customers, though he could be wrong but hey he was Tony Stark.
“Wondrous!” Thor said hyped but suddenly he looked as if he was struck with a sudden thought. “Would Captain Steve be arriving later? You two are always together. It’s rare to see you both separated for long.” Thor said in curiosity.
“When you saw me kissing Peggy, I asked her to.” Steve explained, he saw Tony’s sad expression. “But not for the reason you think. I wanted to confirm something about myself then you happened to see us and you know where this is going right?” Tony nodded and smiled. “What did you wanna confirm Steve?” Tony asked curious. “A few things really, I wanted to see if kissing her would spark something in me, a desire for women I guess and It didn’t but you know what I did confirm?” Steve asked smiling.
He smiled, “I know, I think I understand but we can talk about it any other time but now, I just want to enjoy this moment with you. Taking Tony’s hand in his he entwined their fingers, and kissed the back of Tony’s hand.
“Steve! These are amazing!” Tony said in complete astonishment as he flipped through the pages. Steve blushed but smiled at the compliment. “I had to do them on our off days the past week, do you like it?” he asked nervously.
Sapphire Tony was one of Homeworld’s brilliant minds and noblest of aristocrats. A genius created to design and configure weaponry for the benefit of Homeworld. One of his most unique traits aside from his intelligence was his ability to look into the future. His ability had helped Homeworld conquer planets that offered resistance. His gem was embedded in his chest; a brilliant blue with a triangular facet which glowed in the most brilliant blue light.
I know this feels a little unstructured but it went along great for me. Kudos and Comments are appreciated and if you happen to think somethings amiss please don't hesitate to say it.
“No Promises!” Tony yelled from the hallway. That made Steve smile, he missed this, and he missed Tony. He will fulfill his promise to talk to the knight but for now, he was going to enjoy some time alone with Tony.
”I will Thor, soon, but not right now” Tony said sadly. Thor moved his hand to Tony’s and squeezed. “I understand” Tony squeezed back “Thanks and Thanks for the snacks” Tony said giving Thor a toothy grin.” You are most welcome.” They stayed like that for a while, Thor not really letting go of Tony’s hand until Tony felt better.
“Steve look at me, (Steve slowly did) you know the others are finding a way to get him back to his own world right? (Steve’s expression softened) He won’t be here forever and he wants to go home too”. Tony looked sad. Talk to him; get to know him a bit before despising him cause, that’s not you. That’s not the Steve I know”.
“Can I take you up on that offer?” Tony asked his eyes sincere as he looked at Steve. Steve nodded and they made their way to his room.
Tony gasped in surprise but didn’t protest as Steve ran from the rain. He thought Steve felt warm, most rubies are of fire elements which may explain why Steve was so warm.
“I shall be off them, mine shift starts in a few hours but I must be off, Take care Tony” Thor gave Tony one last kiss on the forehead as he walked away, a sad smile on his face.
I’m fine I-“ Steve was cut off when he felt something on his hand; movement. It was barely noticeable at first a small shake of his hand but a few seconds later Tony’s hand started grasping his. The heart monitor was starting to beep faster. Bruce sprang into action calling the other nurses and doctors into the room and instructed Steve to get out of the room for now.
Tony made it to his Locker, depositing his lunch bag inside; he noticed another paper bag inside. He didn’t remember leaving anything there yesterday. Curious, he opened the bag. It was warm and it smelled good. Tony rummaged the contents and saw a chocolate muffin, a few sandwiches, an apple and a small thermos filled with his favorite coffee. He thought that maybe Thor left this in his locker. He took out the muffin and took a big bite out of it.
I know I could have done this better but I'm still learning and I'll edit the whole story again in time. Thanks for reading :)
“I’m gonna remove the cameras from both our rooms from today on”. Tony was glaring at the place where the camera was. Steve just nodded. “Good”. “Tony?” Steve called him and said. “I Love you” it was Tony’s turn to blush. “I-I love you too.” Tony said feeling embarrassed but overjoyed.
Steve called out as Tony rounded the corner, “What were you doing up there?” Steve raised his voice as he asked. Tony backtracked and peeked his head round the corner. “I was looking for you, bye Cap” Tony shouted the last part as he headed to his workshop. His pace a little bit faster. Steve’s brain short circuited again.
Steve walked carefully as to not jostle Tony but his intention soon backfired as he managed to bump against a stool and the sound alerted Tony that he almost toppled over his own stool. Steve made a run for Tony as to avoid him falling to the floor. He made it in time to balance out the chair and they both sighed in relief.
Steve pondered the question for a moment, thumb running back and forth absently across Tony’s skin. “I could go for some pancakes. Are we near an IHOP?”
selling you off to some corporate bastard who will have no problem with tearing you apart, piece by piece. I’d rather live on the fucking street.”
He’d taken what he could, though, and despite the new weight that had settled on him that year as his mother’s health had continued to deteriorate, he’d still managed to enjoy it. Because it was Christmas, and because Christmas meant happiness and home and his Mom’s stupid cookies that she continued to insist had come directly from Santa, even when Steve had long since stopped believing.
at it for like four hours in your bedroom, can you cut it out in the public kitchen?” Clint whined, shooting the both of them dirty looks, “you’re too old for this shit now.”
There was a pause. Then, “Sir has everything arranged in the event of his death. His will is indisputable. Ownership of the tower and all his assets will pass to Captain Rogers. The company will be left with Miss Potts.”
“Are you free?” He asked instead as a compromise, “it’s just- no one’s in my house right now. And. I mean, if you wanted, you could-“
Steve scowled. Natasha paused, and then patted his shoulder again. “Buddy, it’s not women you can’t talk to. It’s hot people.”
“I’m afraid Sir and I come as a package deal, Mr Rogers,” the AI replied rather snippily, and Steve chuckled a little as he shuffled the papers in his hands and straightened them up, “which, may I also add, means that I too, would be rather offended on his behalf if something- or perhaps I should say some
But then Tony just shrugged, taking another large sip. “It doesn’t matter. But you don’t need to worry, Steve. I’ll find whoever it is that’s out for you, and I’ll stop them.”
He paused for a moment, frowning a little and rubbing his eyes as he looked at the crappy car Bucky appeared to be sat in with his feet propped up comfortably on the dash. That didn’t make any particular amount of sense to him, considering Bucky neither lived here nor owned a car and yet… here it was.
One they finally slid out of bed, it was 12:30. Steve wasn’t sure that he’d ever stayed in bed that long before, but he found himself not minding at all as Tony ran his hands through Steve’s uncombed hair and smiled at him with such a look of fondness on his face that a billion things wanted to fall from his mouth:
Steve sighed, taking another mouthful of cereal. Once Sam was out the door, his mind wandered back to where it had been in the beginning; to a tear-stained faced and a hand holding tightly to his own like it was the only thing holding him down on Earth.
,” Steve informed him. “Hey- remember when there was that really bad mission and it had me in a funk for days afterward? What did you do for me?”
He crouched low and lay the flowers next to the headstone. His fingers brushed the stone- cold to the touch. So unlike his mother.
“Holy shit, you’re so beautiful, you know that, right?” Tony whispered, pulling Steve in again, desperate to touch, to feel Steve under his fingers.
Across the living room and sat curled up on the loveseat, Natasha smiled at him. Unlike Steve, her injuries from the LMD attack a few days ago hadn't quite healed, and there was still a slight purple flourishing across her left cheek, while her foot was bound and cast on the floor. Despite that, though, she seemed relaxed. Natasha was not a woman to stew on her injuries. “Good rest?” She asked quietly, “We figured you probably needed it, what with all the baby-related wakeup calls you’ve been having these past few days.”
“Hey,” Steve touched Tony’s shoulder lightly and then watched as Tony jumped a little, head spinning to look at Steve again, “you okay?”
“But I love you,” Tony told him, numb and pleading, like that alone could change Steve’s mind and make him stay.
“I didn’t just try, I succeeded,” Steve informed him cheerily. The sun was just starting to bathe the surrounding area in a watery light, and there was still the bite of nighttime in the air. The breeze pricked his cheeks and made his eyes water, so he shut them and was back to dozing off not even a few seconds later. They’d already packed the night before, so once Steve managed to wrangle him into the passenger seat, it wasn’t all too long until they had to set off again.
Tony spasmed wildly, dislodging Steve from his chest as he yelped, and then clapped a hand over his mouth immediately after. Four different voices cursed his name, whilst several pillows were thrown angrily in his direction, and Tony shot Steve a mutinous look, before snapping his hands around Steve’s hips and yanking him forward. Knowing he was beat this time, Steve simply let him.
Steve was quietly grateful of Tony’s leather jacket. Riding around New York in a T-shirt would not have been fun.
Steve hummed. “Jello,” he repeated softly, which was good. Sounded like a confirmation. Tony couldn’t help but grin a little, kissing Steve’s shoulder fondly as they moved smoothly through the hall.
By the time the morning came around, Steve and Tony had had about three hours of sleep. When he closed his eyes he could hear Peter wailing. Didn't help that Steve had refused to even hold him once, and so Tony had been nearest to the racket the whole damned time.
“But I want to,” Tony had whined, and he’d looked so frustrated as he’d bowed his head and then sighed, “I want to, Steve,
Even as he said the words, he knew that a blush was beginning to creep across his face; could feel the heat as it tingled around his cheeks.
“Sarò pure egoista, ma farei di tutto per stare con te per sempre,” Tony murmured, before his hand disappeared from Steve’s face. He blinked his eyes open a second after, then watched Tony’s lips curl into a smile as they looked at one another. “Good morning, Steve Rogers.”
Tony was looking down at him, his head rested on top of his hand whilst his spare one brushed lazily over Steve’s back, writing out the patterns and equations he’d been doing earlier into his skin. His hair was an absolute mess- large portions of it sticking straight up, whilst the rest of it hung loosely over his eyes, and there were small creases on the side of his cheek from where he’d slept. And- yeah, there were those hickeys Steve had been talking about. Still standing out against the rest of his skin, Steve prided himself on a job well done. They looked hot as fuck, and he was kinda wanting to run his mouth over them again, make them even darker and more visible just because he wanted the whole world to know who Tony belonged to. Melodramatic, possibly, but Steve didn’t even care.
“You can taste, if you want,” Tony blurted, and Steve shuddered violently at the words, his grip tightening to the point that bordered on pain as he made a low noise in his throat and kissed Tony’s neck, the cleaner version of what they were both thinking of. Definitely interested in that, then. “You wanna stay the night?”
Tony’s, thank you very much) Tony had pretty much completely forgotten the feeling of displacement amongst the team. It was easy, when they were all together like that, getting into squabbles every five minutes about the most irrelevant shit you could think of. Steve was sat next to him, shooting those little glances and soft smiles his way every time Tony caught him looking, and then across on the other side of the van Tony was trying to avoid Clint and Natasha’s knowing winks and sniggers. They were children and honestly, Tony was far above that. He stuck his tongue out and shot them both the bird when Steve wasn’t looking, but that was only in retaliation, obviously.
It was adorable, and Steve found himself unable to stop smiling. Yeah- coming home. Definitely the best part.
There was no way he could deny the smug look Ty sent his way at the words. Instantly, Steve felt his temper rise and jaw clench, and he made a move to step forward and ask just what the fuck Ty meant by that- but then Thor was pressing down firmly on his shoulder in warning, and when he glanced his way, the boy was shaking his head minutely, face solemn. Steve remembered his words from a few weeks ago- ‘
“He shot me, Steve,” Tony’s voice was hoarse, as if he’d been talking all day as opposed to his uncharacteristic silence, “that man, Redford,
“Sir, I am by far the most valuable thing in your possession, and this decision would be the most sensible thing—”
Steve delicately lifted Tony’s shirt, despite Tony’s weak verbal protest, and gasped as he saw the bruises which mottled Tony’s right-hand side. They were an angry, deep purple; running from waist to-
Both Thor and Tony pulled the same face at the same time. “We’re hiding,” Tony admitted in the end, and Thor nodded again. “From evil forces,” he added.
“Ceaselessly loud?” Steve said with a sigh, swinging off the banister and then waiting for Sam, pushing him forward, “whatever, you go first though- she scares me.”
“took a bit of a while to track it down,” Tony said, voice going a little softer as he rolled the silver ring between his fingers and then looked back up to Steve. His eyes were gentle, and he even smiled slightly. “But I got it in the end.”
“I missed you too,” Tony’s voice punctured his thoughts and Steve looked up at him, watching how Tony shifted back and forth nervously, “it’s not… God, it’s been a
Tony lifted a hand and delicately pulled Steve’s face closer, checking out his cut lip and then moving his gaze over to the clock, which told him that Steve was supposed to be in school right now. “Did you go find Ty?” He asked quietly, “dammit, Steve—”
They arrived at their room quietly and Steve slipped in first, footfalls light so as not to stir the sleeping boy in the cot on the other side of the room. Tony followed his footsteps as Steve went over to it, and soon both of them were peering over the bars, checking on the boy that they knew was tucked up, totally safe and sound asleep.
“I…” Tony started, and Steve turned to him just in time to watch him forcefully relax himself, breaking into a grin and a careless wave of his hand. He didn’t look at Steve. “Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.”
No, no that can’t be… I- I swear you said 5, and it’s… Oh god, my phone’s not broken or something is it, I swear, I swear Steve I only thought 40 minutes had passed-“
to know. And damn, JARVIS was right- he was down here, looking at Tony’s genius in action when barely anyone else even knew he was even smart- it was one hell of a telling gesture, when he thought about it.
Steve watched him as he spoke, trying to understand what angle Tony was coming from. His body language was nervous, closed-off. But it wasn’t threatening. There was no violence in him, which was not something Steve had expected.  They sat there for a few moments in awkward silence, as Steve tried to say something coherent and Tony waited for it, fingers tracing the edge of his tablet repetitively as he did so.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh, turning in his chair and looking up at Steve softly. The other man looked back down at him, the same expression mirrored on his face. Then he patted Tony’s shoulder softly, thumb running quickly over the bare skin of his neck before slipping off again. Tony ignored the tingle it left- he’d had a lot of practise in that field.
Fuck, he needed to sleep. His jokes were getting downright shitty, and that just wasn’t good enough.
The man glanced up, and Tony threw the little block at him. Steve, of course, caught it- and then immediately dropped it when he felt the slimy texture. Tony just smiled. “Choking hazard,” he explained, once more turning back to Peter. “Don’t eat plastic. It’s bad for you.”
His phone rang again, and he gritted his teeth together as he checked the number. It was unknown, so he just rejected it, seeing as anyone important to him would have been established in his contacts already. However, as soon as he rejected the call, the phone rang again, same number. Steve sighed irritably and lifted it to his ear. “Who is this?
He tried apologizing for it, but Steve wouldn’t hear it. “It’s not your fault, Tony,” he’d always say, in a voice so much quieter and more subdued than the way Steve normally spoke, and that would be that. Tony didn’t want to push, in case Steve got angry with him. Not that he was… he wasn’t
It hardly made any sense. But Fury was pulling up evidence; grainy photos, statements from agents that they’d had tailing Tony. Nothing official, but enough. It was enough.
Suddenly raising her free hand, she brought the phone to her ear and raised an eyebrow toward Steve as he stared at her in horror.
Tony waved, then turned to Thor and pushed him away back down the corridor. Steve watched, amused as the two boys had a brief shoving match, until Thor had to pick Tony up off the floor and then back away when Tony made a few rapid gestures, pointing off in the direction of the science corridor. Once Thor had bounced off looking excited, Tony turned back around and leaned against the windowsill, grinning down at Steve.
,” Steve lied vehemently through his teeth, stumbling forward and reaching out, only to have Tony leap away before they could connect, “Tony, they’re not, please, look at me. Look at my wings. They’re fine. Healthy. I’m-”
He lifted his hands, raising them in defeat. Suddenly, for some reason, he felt a little shaky. Steve could look... well, he could look scary when he wanted to. Not that Tony was
“How was your evening?” Came a soft voice to his left, and he blinked and turned to Bruce, who’d quietly sidled up next to him. His hair was damp and his glasses skewed, with a tell-tale crisscross of indents on his cheek which implied he’d probably been napping by the TV until Steve and Thor had stormed in and woken him up, of course.
Unfortunately, no matter how freakily good tony may have been with kids, that talent didn’t quite extend to Steve. Peter
Rubbing his eyes and smiling, he plodded back up the stairs and headed into his room, head falling immediately into the pillow once he was back inside. On the other side of the hall, Sam made a questioning groaning sound, which Steve responded to with a jumbled series of words that didn’t make sense to anyone. Sam seemed to take it, though, because he made an agreeing sound and then started snoring a few seconds later.
Sam didn’t even bother to answer that- just cackled and then slapped Steve’s shoulder again. He heard a snapping sound across the table a moment later, and figured that was another of Clint’s catapults that had just been crushed by Natasha’s fingers, which also meant he was about to be subjected to another fight between those two. Wisely, he chose to zone out- letting his eyes shut against his arms as his friends’ voices steadily rose across the table.
With a fond smile he gently snaked his arm around Tony’s waist, rolling him over onto his back. Tony frowned at the jostling. “Mmmf.”
They flew through the skies at a rapid speed, Tony listening in on the constant stream of information as JARVIS relayed it through. They’d successfully cut off the whole street, and so any civilians caught in the middle were holed up in their own buildings. Tony just hoped to god they’d stay there for the time being. SHIELD had already gone into lockdown mode, but the trucks that had rolled up were storing a range of nifty gizmos, and from what Tony could tell, they were somehow managing to interfere with the counter-defence measures SHIELD had for these situations. Tony was going to have to take a look at them later, too. See where they’d gone wrong.
“I am… such a mess,” he whispered, and Steve was hit by the sadness in his voice in the same way one would be hit by a train at full-speed. Tony was looking down, down at his shoes, and Steve watched in horror as something fell over his cheek and spilled onto the carpet- Tony was crying.
abusers; he’d seen the look of disgust and rage on his face as he’d knocked them through the walls and then told the wife, the husband, the child that they were safe now, they wouldn’t hurt them any more. Steve wouldn’t abuse anyone, because he quite clearly hated abusers.
Rhodey hissed again. “We took out as many as we could. But I can’t… I couldn’t get up after the last one, and I heard gunshots in the cabin from the few stragglers we couldn’t take out—”
He stared blankly at Loki before turning away. “Just drive, please,” he said blankly. He didn’t have the energy to engage in a debate with Thor’s lost little brother.
The voice was incredulous, tinny and coming from the speaker at the side of the gate. Steve heaved in another shaky breath. God, it had been so long since he’d heard Tony speak. The timbre, inflections and tones were all the same. Exactly the same. It felt like a physical punch in his gut, but he had to keep his cool. “It’s me,” Steve responded, leaning into the microphone. “Tony, this is an emergency—fuck, can you please… I don’t have anywhere else and I don’t—I
Steve choked. He thought of every argument they’d had over the past month, where Steve had been furious enough for Tony to give in, to think that he must have been in the wrong for Steve to be so angry with him. Now, it was just easy for him to come to the same conclusion: this was his fault.
“Yeah, I mean I can’t really argue with that logic.” Tony waved a finger at Sam. “Like he said, I’ll beat you up.”
“No,” he answered eventually, body loosening as he shrugged. His eyes went over Steve’s head, meeting with Tony’s, where they stayed for a few seconds. “Just wanted to check in on Tony. You’re coming out tonight, right?”
He could feel Tony looking at him again, and glanced nervously sideways. Then he felt a hand settle slowly on his shoulder, movement on the couch as Tony shuffled closer. “Steve,” his voice sounded upset, but firm as he carried on, “Jesus Christ, Steve, you have nothing to be sorry for. It was
Steve paused, turning to look at him for a few moments. He didn’t say anything, and neither did Tony. They both knew what the other was thinking, after all. Then, slowly, Steve’s hand came up and reached for Tony’s, and he smiled softly. “Thank you,” was all he said before he slid from the chair and allowed Tony to take his place. He dropped down and pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head and then ambled off in the direction of the microwave. Tony was left looking at Peter and his horrendously messy face as the boy stared up at him. His fingers were covered in orange-brown mush.
Steve glanced mournfully over to the bed, where he’d been peacefully about to receive a blowjob just minutes earlier. Sometimes being a superhero really sucked. Seemed they were always just getting fucking interrupted.
“Do you have a problem?” He asked roughly, holding his hands tighter around the straps of his bag, knowing that was the first place they’d go to. He had experience with this shit.
“Steve?” Tony’s face fell a little, and Steve realised the emotion must have started to leak onto his face. “You okay?”
Behind him, there was a short bark of laughter. “Fair,” he heard the muttered reply, and then the revving of an engine once more as Tony got back on his bike
God. Objectively, he knew he was being irrational- the team had been a unit for years by this point, and they’d never… they’d never seemed to show any lingering hostility toward him. It was fucking stupid to think that they’d just leave him as soon as he stopped being able to use the armour, but-
Sitting down gingerly at his desk near the back of class, he sighed heavily and rubbed a light hand over the band-aid across his forehead. He could still feel the ghosting sensations of Tony’s fingers placing it there; warm breath against the side of his face as he worked. Every time their fingers brushed or Tony touched him, it felt like an electric shock. He couldn’t get over it- couldn’t get over all the ways in which Tony could drive him crazy without even trying.
When he felt Steve’s teeth scrape along his shoulder, run up his neck to clamp down in a bloodless bite right over his jugular, Tony came. He felt like Steve was going to laugh at him for that later, but he didn’t care just then. And neither did Steve, seemingly— he sped up, movements more erratic as he tried desperately to chase the feeling while continuing to suck a messy hickey into Tony’s skin, his hands roaming freely until they settled on Tony’s small waist, hitching him up without even thinking about it. Tony bit his lip, his arms wrapped around Steve’s neck, talking without knowing what he was even saying. He wanted to feel Steve come undone above him.
He sighed, buttoning his coat all the way up to the throat and then ducking his head against the piercing November wind. His therapist was always giving him shit for thinking like that. She said he had some extreme self esteem issues, and he could hardly disagree. God, just look at him- there were 12 year old girls taller than him, and he got sick so often he had barely been in enough of school to learn basic math. He was hardly anything-
gotta go, or that we shouldn’t have come out at all.” Rhodey took a pause, and Steve just listened intently, feeling like the phone was glued to his ear. “Steve, buddy, you have to understand… Tony is terrified of him. I mean,
, kissing him, his hands around Steve’s waist, every movement of his fingers being like something burning hot touching his skin, and he’d just given Steve the best birthday present he could possibly have thought of because he was
Natasha took a second. Blinked once. "Hm," she said evenly, "I don't quite know how to answer that one."
“Greetings, soon-to-be birthday boy,” Carol ruffled his hair amicably and then pulled a face, “Clint invited me to come to your place, but I promise Rhodey I’d study with him and I can’t back out now. Sorry to bail.”
“Just not when you’re sleep deprived and on-edge and ten times more likely to crash the thing, of course-“
“Happy Halloween?” Steve said with a faint blush, folding up his back leg behind him in an impersonation of what Tony assumed to be the infamous playboy pose. He was still dressed the same way he had been when he’d walked out, but on his head this time were a large pair of black bunny ears. “As it just so happens, I passed a fancy dress shop and saw these in the window as I was making my way here. Seemed like fate.”
He was there, on the sidewalk where it had all gone down, and he saw Tony three feet away. Tony hadn’t spotted him, his eyes still fixed on Past-Steve’s back as he hailed down a cab to drive him back to the tower. Across the street, Redford was already aiming his gun.
“You should know,” was all Tony said in the end, head shaking a little, “you deserve that much. Need to know what you’re getting yourself into, after all- it’s only fair.”
or anything, it was more the fact that it was- well- Jane. Can’t have called that one, if he was being honest.
“So, Rogers, what’s the truth?” Sam folded his arms and leaned against the wall. “Did you really? After all my wise words? Not that I’m like, judging you or anything,” Sam hurried to mention, holding up his hands in surrender, “like, you do you, man, but… Tony? Really? I told you his rep- he’s seventeen and you’re fifteen-“
Steve was still blushing, and he shook his head as he wrapped his hand around Tony's waist and pulled him in. "I only sang to him," he mumbled, "you probably would have done it better."
Steve sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. “You’re not getting what I’m trying to say here,” he muttered, pursing his lips before taking a deep breath and straightening his back like he was preparing for war. When he looked at Tony, though, his eyes were sure. Resolute. “I’m in love with you,” he said simply, “and I have been for a long time.”
Thor nodded, pushing his hair back from his face and then rubbing two fingers over his eyes. Steve saw that there were purpling bruises over his knuckles. “Yeah, I know how you feel,” he responded, before sighing and then giving Steve another tight smile, “are you heading there right now?”
Twenty minutes in, however, and nothing had happened aside from a few episodes of vomiting. He kept going though; working through the pain, but coming up blank each and every time. He tried analysing the schematics; tried to run through a segment of the code, but no matter how hard he tried to hold onto the information he absorbed, it refused. The memories were well and truly hidden from him, and angry tears slipped from his eyes as he tore the stupid bits of paper apart and then shoved them into the trash. He felt sick to his stomach. His head had never hurt more in his entire life, and he was completely fucking exhausted.
