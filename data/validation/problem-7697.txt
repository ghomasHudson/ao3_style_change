What is this, Stranger Things? Is there a demogorgon now? Do they have to play D&D?
are playing Galaga. Well, minus Bruce. He’s in the lab. Maybe he doesn't like Galaga. Or maybe he just doesn’t like whatever the inside joke is.
Tony nods. “So, the question is, are we going to tell him?”
"Well... you don't have to be, if you don't want to." Steve says slowly.
Clint jumps to his feet, as does everyone else.
Clint knocks on the door. "Pete. You there?"
He looks down, taking off his mask. "Who am I... to be Spider-Man?"
"The symbiotes gone." Steve explains. "We were worried it went after you."
"Yeah! Which he shouldn't! Do you see any
"Besides, increased metabolism." Peter shrugs.
He misses Dr. Banner. He misses working with him in the lab, discovering new things and developing cures for the hulk.
"Could you pull up the mod for my webs Dad mentioned?" Peter asks.
Morse code. He’s tapping out Morse code.
Venom informs Peter.
“Jarvis, delay him!” Tony exclaims.
"Ha! I win!" Peter grins. "I am the ultimate winner!"
Tony frowns. "Are you sure? I'll skip if you need me too."
thing, but I dunno what you like. You don't exactly tell people that kinda stuff." Peter explains.
“Fuck you.” He says the words without even thinking, he didn’t even realize what he said until after.
"You're not worthy." He says simply, glaring at the symbiote.
"Classified. I want him brought in by next week. Are my orders clear?" Fury interrupts.
Well, this sucks.
Are you? Is he what?
Where Peter stands in his Spider-Man suit. "Peter!" Tony exclaims. "Are you alright?"
Wait... what?
"Banner. He tracked your DNA based off your spider-abilities." Clint explains. He takes a step closer. "Pete... everyone's worrying about you. Tony locked himself in the lab. Steve yelled at Thor. Banner almost hulked out. Peter... please. Come back." Clint begs.
"What?" Steve asks, confused.
"What the fuck just happened?" Spidey asks.
Step two- find a place to lay low while the heat dies down. Can’t have SHIELD catching him- or the Avengers, for that matter.
Steve shakes his head. "No. Tony, no."
"I'm under the impression that the Avengers teamed up with Spider-Man to take out the multi-verse dinosaur, am I correct?" Fury asks rhetorically.
Steve seems sad, too.
Tony turns off the TV. "He's an idiot. For starters, if he
"A couple black eyes, a bunch of bruises, um, I think I got a mild concussion once... " Peter trails off. "Just don't tell Dad and Pops, okay? They'd get so mad, and they might actually kill him..."
Natasha bursts into the room. "The symbiotes gone."
Tony storms into the room, and sits on the couch, clearly angry. He turns on the TV. "Look at this!" He demands.
Now they're all here.
So, today is Saturday. And Clint's following, (or as Steve insists,
When she turns back to Peter, he’s gone.
like your father." Steve assures.
"Erm... Fury came back, and he yelled at Clint and Nat. Fury is technically your guy's boss, and I didn't want him to break the Avengers apart. He also seemed to be causing a lot of problems for you guys, and I didn't even know what he wanted with me. I... I didn't want you guys to suffer because I'm paranoid." Peter explains quietly. "Now I know what he wants. I get it now. I... I won't do this again. I'm sorry."
Steve sighs. "I'm on my way. Don't worry, I'll get him to eat." He assures.
If possible, he feels his heart shatter even more. "God..." Steve murmurs. "Peter..."
“In north America.”
He fiddles with his web shooters. "I shouldn't be a hero. I'm just a kid with bad luck who had lost people close to him." Peter sighs. "Just a kid who can never settle down. Just a kid who can never win. Just a kid who always falls short. Just a kid... " He trails off.
Peter tried to repair the damage.
"Peter says 'Hi'." Peter says. No... Venom says! Its Venom, not Peter. Not Peter.
Steve starts to head towards the labs.
Steve sighs. Tony is looking down, not meeting his eyes.
Hacking into Jarvis so he wouldn't tell that he went to bed past curfew? Lopsided grin.
Peter blushes, looking away. "Erm, well, from my calculations, I should be eating about three times the amount that I eat now." He confesses. "I just didn't want to tip off that I was... you know..."
"What'd you mean he's gone?" Tony demands, rage all too evident in his voice.
"Yeah, you do. He's Spider-Man." Clint tells the genius.
Now it's just me, Thor, and Steve. "Thor, would you mind leaving for a minute?"
Anyway, Peter hands his controller to Clint, and stands up. “I’m gonna go help Dr. Banner in the lab.” Peter is still uncomfortable calling him Bruce.
“What is it?” Clint asks, excited.
Now they have two very angry teenage boys. Wonderful.
If possible, Dad's grin gets even wider."Nope! Wish I did, though. The kids a genius. I mean, his web-shooter designs are amazing, let me tell you. See, he-"
Clint puts Peter's mask back on him. “Keep it on.” He orders.
As Clint's finishing, Peter walks in, and plops down tiredly on the couch next to Tony.
“Like?”
Why him? Of all the people who all of this could’ve happened to, what are the chances that it would happen to Peter?
"I hate web-slinging!"
Things were simpler then.
Peter thinks he likes people more than web-slinging. Try again, brain.
Stark laughs. "Shoo, bird-brain!"
"Someones a sore loser." Peter taunts.
Natasha can hear Clint calling something from outside the room. Probably,
Tony returns the smile, even though its weak. "Yeah. Who better?"
"What'cha doing?" Flash asks.
go wrong?
Spider-Man sighs. "And that's my cue to leave." He swings off, leaving a very angry and confused police officer behind.
What could
Peter flinches. “Huh? I dunno what you mean.” He lies. Painfully obviously.
Peter sighs, and curls up in the fetal position.
E. That's an
So... 1 out of 2 out of 8 out of 14 out of 36 out of 54 out of 1,346. Wow. So, incredibly low. Like, incalculably low.
"You'll what?" Peter asks. They don't have anything to threaten him with. He's making his mask stick to his face- its not like they can take it off. And they don't know who is family is, so they can't blackmail him that way.
Venom says.
"Clint-"
“Okay...... Erm, so, whats your name?”
"Tony. Peter's under Venom's control. He attacked Clint." Pepper says, not bothering to say hello.
Peter walks into the lab. Tony looks up, and tenses. "Hey, Pete." Tony greets.
Peter suddenly looks guilty. "Oh, god... I'm sorry-"
Dr.Banner is in the labs...
Someone about to walk into a prank he set up? Lopsided grin.
Tony is carrying Steve as they fly. "See anything?" He asks, yelling to be heard over the wind.
Clint looks down. "Erm... I was wondering if I could help you find him."
Clint sighs. "Natasha, we can't. He's a kid!"
Clint nods. "It must've been terrifying." He agrees.
“Guys... maybe I should just not-”
Holy shit. What the hell did he do?
“Well, where in the continental USA?”
Natasha follows Clint into the next room. Clint speaks before she can. "Did you know that Peter was being bullied? I tried talking to the guy, and he's a total dick!" Clint exclaims.
bit guilty. Especially now that he knows why the secret was a secret. "Sure." He decides.
That's an impressive lie. He set it up so Tony would have trouble telling Steve, and set it up so that if they wanted answers, they'd have to back him up... for now.
"Of course." Thor booms, and heads off towards the kitchen, probably to eat pop-tarts.
Examples?
“What if we made a third option?” Steve suggests.
Clint stands up, and locks eyes with Tony. “What is Peter not telling us?” He asks. “I mean, for some
Peter fidgets nervously with his shirt. Then, suddenly, there's a loud noise. Metal grinding into metal.
And flies up, just hovering over the ground. Peter grins. "Yes!" He exclaims.
"I- no, don't-" Clint yells, eyes wide.
Peter smiles back.
How is he doing that? How can he hide his emotions that well?Wait, back to the problem at hand. What does Clint tell him? That it was a training exercise? That'd go over well!
“No. That he’s Spider-Man.”
“My hammer. My choice.” Thor booms.
Peter grins his trademark crooked smile. "Sure. Just get it on camera."
Clint walks in, looking nervous. "We figured out his secret." He tells the scientist.
Clint sighs. “Good going, Tony.”
. Yep. Makes him sound like an evil genius.
"Seeing your friend turned into a monster. I can only imagine what that must be like." Clint continues, trying to be empathetic. Not really his strong suit.
"42." Peter responds immediately, in time with Clint, who says,
Flash looks up at him. Peter knows from school that he's literally the president of his fan-club, but he's never met Spider-Man. Not in costume, anyway.
"Nonsense. Peter, it doesn't matter if you need to eat six times as much as me. Its fine!" Tony assures him.
phone rings. He switches it to vibrate, and ducks even farther out of Peter's range of sight, answering it. "Hello?" He asks.
"Yeah- wait, you know my name?" Flash asks, in awe.
Ah. That was her role in this. "Its fine, Peter. Thank you." Steve replies.
Then he runs forward and attacks the symbiote and it's host with a new fever. Natasha helps him as well as she can, but the fighting-style that he's using makes it hard to get close.
Tony nods, getting to his feet. "That's all there is to it."
Steve nods, and smiles. "Yeah. I do. Thank you, Peter."
Peter glares."I-"
Tony sighs. "He's too much like me. How can I stop him from being me?"
Steve frowns. “Why would you, Peter? Make a list of the pro’s and con’s.” Maybe this way Steve could help him discover what feels right to him, instead of him being in a delusional panic.
out of it.
It starts to spread and grow. If part of Venom is in one place, the rest of him can appear there. Great! Now if only Peter could think of something
Tony: "-I should've-"
Its onto his shoulder now. Agh! What the heck should Peter do?!? He doesn't want to be possessed and watch his body be controlled by an alien who wants to take over the planet!
, the truck grinds to a halt, leaving a tired and sore Spider-Man in the middle of the road. "New meaning for road-rage, huh?" He quips.
"Wow. You actually picked up pretty fast. Good job." Clint grins, pleased with the lie he thought up.
The symbiote shrieks, and another voice does too. Male. Teenage. That's all Natasha can pick out. She's never heard it before.
? Why didn't the bite kill him? Why did he not only survive, but end up with superpowers? Why did he become a superhero? Why does this responsibility of protecting and saving lives fall to him? Why?
He walks out, and immediately trips over Thor’s hammer.
"Language!" Tony and Clint chorus.
Then his shield flies out of his hand, suspended by a black web. It flies into Peter's hand, who Steve just now notices is in front of them, on the ceiling.
"Tony, please-" Clint begins, but Tony cuts him off.
"Right...." Tony replies.
"Argh," Tony breathed, "My suit."
"Cap," his voice was oddly cheerful, "Missing me?"
Fury's hardened expressions softened a little, "He's fine, got lucky," He said.
"Thanks, Pointbreak," Tony raised his glass, "I don't know if I should be drinking. It's probably not good for the parasite," he smirked.
Tony Stark, playboy, billionaire, genius, philanthropist, host to an alien parasite, was on house arrest in the Avengers tower like fucking Rapunzel. But that was the least of his concerns. He was scared, of hurting the people he cared about, because contrary to popular belief, Tony Stark did have a heart. Whatever Captain Hollier-Than-Thou might believe.
"I think we need to scan Widow for a parasite, too," Tony narrowed his eyes, "What's making you so chatty, eh?"
"Hey, not so fast, soldier," he chuckled, "the doctors will let you see him soon. Also," he said before turning away, "I'm not done with you yet. Don't think you're going to get away with eloping just yet."
Bruce nodded, "Well, it's alien and I can't say much yet, but there definitely aren't any infections or contagions to talk about. Maybe what Tony experienced was just a shock."
"Talk," Natasha crossed her arms.
"Steve would've come anyway," Tony whispered, understanding the meaning behind Bruce's glance.
Tony didn't let him finish his sentence. He placed a hand below Steve's jaw, pulling him closer and pressed their mouths together. The kiss was deep and needy.
How could Steve deny? Tony, the genius he was, already had lube and condoms in the side drawers. Steve felt grateful for that.
"Of course, I can stand you," Tony tried to laugh as a searing pain shot through his head and he let out a moan. Steve held his hand firmly and lay down next to him on the bed.
"Shit," he gasped, "I was holding it very gently."
"I want to ride you," he whispered, making Steve's cock twitch in anticipation.
"Yep," Tony's lips curved into a sly smile.
"I know you don't feel pain nowadays, and you WILL sit down because you have a worm inside your brain, and people who have worms inside their brains are supposed to let their friends guide them," Natasha said, staring directly into his eyes, "Now, we might not know everything about the parasite, but we do not it's not what's making you such an asshole because you've always been one, and you've been avoiding your problems instead of confronting them for a long time. And the same applies on Steve, too. So, you two are stupid, and I'm not, so you'll listen to me when I say that you need to sit down, stare into each other's eyes, and TALK."
"His vitals are completely fine, in fact, very good," One of them said, "He seems to be in a deep state of sleep, nothing else seems to  be wrong. We just have to wait."
To his annoyance, Steve didn't take the hint. Pouring himself some coffee he sat next to Tony.
"I have to admit, I do want to study the extent of my own strength," Tony shrugged. Steve stared at him, his face stern.
"Rhodey, a little help here," He tried to get up, "Oh, no, is it alive?"
Steve shoved his cock inside Tony. The genius moaned and screamed his boyfriend's name until he came just from the thrusts. Steve felt Tony's ass tighten around his cock and moaned. He kept fucking him until he came too. They were both panting as they lay side by side.
"Re… member who… you ...a… re," Steve's voice was frail and quivering as his eyes started to close.
"It's okay to be good naughty," Shuri shrugged, "but try to be bad naughty and you get stung."
"What happened?" Steve asked, his voice heavy with concern. And just like that, the softness of his voice worked as a flame that set Tony's mind on fire. Who the fuck does he think he is? Mother Teresa? Acting like he cares while being a piece of shit when I need him to be slightly more understanding.
"Fine," Fury sighed, "Last chance, soldier. You disobey me for Stark one more time…"
Finally, the doctors walked in.
"Sir, Captain America wants to see you," JARVIS notified him.
"Well, it was dead, pretty sure, and then it wasn't, at least for a minute. I saw something move and then BAM!" Tony was back, himself again, pretty energetic and on a coffee fueled rant about the incident. The Avengers, except for Steve were all in the living room, looking at him bemused.
Steve knew he was the last person Tony would want to see. He had sent them a message telling he had locked himself in his workshop and was going to study the parasite there so he can get rid of it. Steve knew SHIELD or the Govt getting involved will unleash catastrophic consequences.
"I know I hurt you," Steve's eyes were piercing into those brown eyes that looked at him with a strange helplessness, "I know I'm sometimes really tough on you, I'm sorry. But the way you've been avoiding me is hurtful, too."
A very sudden date and more.
"C'mon," Steve chuckled, "Tony wouldn't do that." Although he knew Tony totally would.
"I know, J," he threw himself on the bed, "He makes me angry."
"Go for it, tiger," Tony moaned as Steve helped him out of his pants and then underwear. Tony liked it, the less barriers between them the better. Before he could think anything else, Steve attacked him with his mouth. Planting a deep, dirty kiss on Tony's mouth, he moved down to his jaw. Tony's facial hair rough against his lips, he kissed all the way down to his neck.
"You, Steve, bring him back safely," he chewed every word, "Or SHIELD will have to step in."
Three hours later, when the attack happened, and this alien life form they hadn't encountered was wreaking havoc in the city, Iron Man, as usual ignoring Steve's instructions, flew straight towards the school bus that creature was about to attack, hovering between the bus and the alien, he fired.
Tony's movements matched his, a rhythm that felt so divine.
"Honestly, drop it," Tony put his mug on the table, "If you're going to punish Steve, make him cook breakfast for us for the rest of the year."
"Tony," a tear escaped Steve's eye and fell on Tony's forehead. He opened his eyes and Steve's heart trembled. His eyes were bloodshot.
"No!" He gasped.
"Tony you shouldn't have left," Bruce said softly.
Fury got wind of their relationship pretty soon.
"There is something off about Tony," Bruce sighed, "Look!" He rewinded and they saw it. A small, green wormlike thing creeping out of the aliens eye and flying towards Tony.
Steve took a deep breath and smiled, he knew he was going to get this advice from at least someone. His team, surprisingly, had taken it really well. Although he felt like throwing Clint out of the tower every time made one of his faces whenever Tony and Steve would walk in a room, and Rhodes had taken him into a corner and told him he'd murder him if he hurt his bestfriend.
"I… I'm sorry I didn't mean to…" Steve stood in the door, looking very embarrassed. Tony remembered Steve definitely was a morning person. But wasn't it a bit too early, even for Cap,
"So this is how it's going to be now?" He pretended to be annoyed, "You're just going to act childish about this whole thing? I mean…"
"It's my fault," Steve blurted out. Nat and Rhodey turned their heads to look at him. Natasha clicked.
Steve blinked, feeling his cheeks burn.
Fury looked as if he was about to try and summon thunder and smite the tower.
Tony's hands moved to Steve's arms and he pulled him closer. Their mouths met and kissed softly. The second kiss was deeper and lingering. Tony's fingers unbuttoned Steve's shirt as he pushed his tongue into Steve's mouth. Steve yielded eagerly and their tongues danced together. Tony helped Steve out of his shirt and then took off his own. Their mouths separating only for brief intervals.
Bruce held Tony's hand as the doctor examined him.
"So, I thought you could stay at my place today, and tomorrow, and we'll leave for the gala together, but until then," he kissed him again, smiling suggestively.
"He just woke up and is already as unbearable as he used to be," Fury laughed.
"Oh, no, ward him off," Tony said in an exhausted tone.
"Yeah, uh, I'm kind of tired, I'll go to bed now," Tony waved a hand nervously and took a step back, Steve bit his lip and looked away.
"Tony's not a kid, Cap," Rhodes sighed, "Don't blame yourself."
"S… Steve, is he?" He croaked.
"IRON MAN," Steve shouted in the comms, "DON'T GO ANY CLOSER TO THAT THING, YOU'LL GET YOURSELF KILLED."
Tony blinked. That idiot had no idea what Tony was going through. Yet he thought he knew better than everyone else. Like he can decide what Tony needs.
Steve looked up at him. He could hear Tony's heartbeat and it made him feel really close to him.
"Excuse me?" Tony raised an eyebrow, "I'm trapped here, it doesn't mean I take orders from sp… ow!" He feigned feeling pain as Natasha punched his shoulder.
"What happened?" He grabbed the first aid box and as if automatically, rushed to help Tony, "Let me…"
"I'm sorry," Tony whispered, "And I'm sorry for everything, Cap."
"With this attitude, you'll get us all killed, Stark. No one is safe around you while you're like this," Steve had said, exasperated.
"It makes sense, sir" JARVIS's voice boomed, "It could've accessed your earlier memories and response to the Captain."
"Um," Steve ran a hand through his hair nervously, "Shuri thought it better than we had privacy. We don't want our parasite to feel shy," he smiled apologetically, making Tony roll his eyes which happened a lot these days.
Someone had brought a first aid box, they all looked shocked. Steve had just walked in.
"Unhhh, Sss… Steve," he moaned and started matching Steve's thrusts. They fucked like this for God knows how long. And then, Steve held him by the waste, moving him on the bed until Tony was on all fours beneath him.
He sucked Tony as he touched himself. Their moans and grunts filled the room. Tony was clutching the bedsheets as his eyes got tight shut.
"Oh," Steve said, apologetically, "Sorry I forgot. We should get going."
"I…" he laughed softly, "I like you, too. And I… like… you, every day a bit more."
"No promises," Tony whispered.
"It's not your OWN strength, Iron Man, it's not who you are. Don't get too attached. You can spar with Thor, though. Have the sedatives nearby." Steve was back in the Captain America mode for some reason.
"Mmmm," Tony moaned, "So we're still going to fight for control in bed, too?"
"I forgive you," he found himself saying and knew that it was his truth, "And I'm sorry for what I did, "And believe me, I'm trying to figure things out, I really am. I just don't want to hurt you, or anyone else." His eyes were pleading.
"I'm here, Tony," he ran his fingers through Tony's head, "we'll get through this together." He held Tony close. Tony turned over, his eyes shut tight as the pain drove him insane. He wasn't going to listen to it. Not this time.
"It's the parasite," Bruce said, as the doctors checked Tony. Steve's was white as a ghost. The parasite now lay motionless on the floor. It was dead.
Steve looked up and bit his lips. He hated Tony talking about Bucky like this, but this wasn't the right time to start conflict.
"Tony, what?" Rhodes spoke, "Don't worry I'm almost there. Widow, get back up!"
"I don't want to hurt you," his voice was shaking.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Missed being with you, like this," Steve whispered, turning to look at his boyfriend. Tony took advantage of this opportunity and kissed him deeply, his tongue demanding entrance in Steve's mouth. Steve's parted his lips and deepened the kiss, with tongues and all.
Bruce let out a deep breath. Tony and Steve stared at each other.
"Tony, c'mon, let it go," Rhodes said, pressing his hand on Tony's shoulder to make him sit down. Tony's expressions softened, he let Steve take his hand and finish the dressing.
"We had an appointment, remember?" He narrowed his eyes, "For a good cause?"
"Hey," Tony protested, "First of all, my coffee, all of it. Second, you shouldn't be this close, not after…"
"Mmm, yes," Steve smiled, looking into those brown eyes lovingly.
"Mmm, yes, baby, fuck me!" Tony croaked impatiently.
"No," Tony tried to push him away, as gently as possible, "It's a panic attack, it'll pass. But the parasite, Steve, it's happening again." He sobbed.
"I should think so," Tony stared into Steve's eyes, "I am a good catch, afterall."
"I want it," Tony faced Steve, "Want you."
"Please," Steve murmured, blushing. Apparently, Tony had been babbling about their kiss in a state of delirium in the hospital.
Before he could help himself, he was hugging Bucky, his tears falling on his friend's shoulder.
I hope you're happy. Final chapter coming soon. Comments, comments, comments.
"I don't hate you," Steve whispered, rubbing his hand with his thumb, "You are my friend. And I…" he smiled awkwardly, "I really like you, even if you can't stand me."
"Or I could pick you up," Tony said, and Steve could imagine him blushing.
Steve laughed, undoing his pants, 'I'm sorry, Iron Man, I just want to make love to you."
Fury didn't care.
"You can?" Tony's mind went on fire.
Bruce was exploring a whole new direction now. It wasn't the alien blood but the footage of the attack they needed to see.
Tony's eyes were closed, the bliss of having Steve inside him was too much to handle. He kept moving slowly for a while, riding his boyfriend. And then, he felt Steve start to thrust faster, gradually increasing the force.
"Are they," Tony flipped through the magazine, "watching us?"
Tony froze as Steve drew closer and extended a hand, making the scientist flinch for an unknown reason. Steve took Tony's hand in his, unaware of how had he mustered up this courage. Tony stared into those blue eyes that were pleading with his.
"Kill him!"
A doctor, joined by Nick Fury and Bruce entered the room.
He'd never want him to get hurt. But he did, and it was Steve's fault, or at least that's how he felt as he sat with Natasha, Rhodes, and Bruce in the hospital's waiting area. Waiting for the SHIELD doctors to show up and tell them that their friend was going to be okay.
"Tony," Steve leaned over him, "I'm not going anywhere. You have the band, you can't hurt me. Just resist it."
This did it. There was no sarcastic comeback. No snarky one-liner. Tony's face had darkened, a shadow passed through it. As if it had been something he knew to be true. Steve's eyes fell at his face, and his heart sank a little. He opened his mouth, wanting to apologise, but something held him back. Serves him right. Let him feel bad for a while. A little voice urged Steve.
Steve inserted another finger and stared at his lover's lustful face as he did it. Tony looked already blissed out.
"Oh, it is," Tony turned his head, his eyes bright, "I miss you, I want to spend some time with you. That's important."
"Damn it," Tony whispered under his breath, turning away. He didn't want to look at Steve, it was too early in the morning for feeling murderous.
He deserves to be punished.
Steve's eyes widened. Maybe the parasite was making him delirious.
"Oh," Steve's heart skipped a beat.
When they ended the kiss they were out of breath. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, he wanted to feel him, drown himself in his scent.
Fury stared at them both, amused, as they waved at him and walked out.
Their eyes met. Tony's lips curved in a painful but hopeful smile. Steve found himself leaning over the scientist. He softly pressed his lips against Tony's. It was a gentle, chaste kiss. Steve placed a hand on Tony's cheek, caressing it with his thumb. Tony's eyes were fixed at him. Suddenly, his body jolted violently.  Panicked, Steve pressed the alarm button Shuri had installed close to the bed. He held Tony as his body went through the terrible seizures.
"Peter... god, Peter..." Tony whispers.
The symboite drips off of it's host, and Spider-Man collects all of it in an air-tight jar, quickly sealing it.
Suddenly, the device glows. Tony feels a rush of energy in my chest... from the Arc Reactor.
He's completely covered by the symbiote.
Tony's reaction time is too slow. It slams into the armor, and Tony frowns. "What?" He asks.
Steve smiles back. "Yeah. I'm sure."
Yes, the Amazing Spider-Man is in a pillow fort. Because, why not?!? Why the fucking hell not?!?
"A kid who beats up Peter." She points out.
"Either turn it up all the way and make it a bomb, or turn it down 24 degrees." Peter decides.
“New York.”
“What?” Peter blinks. He seems genuinely confused.
“Yes. I want to know how you got your powers.”
"Tony, no, your not. We can both protect him, teach him. Your not worthless. You're nothing like your father." Steve assures him.
“Spider-Man, please don’t make this more difficult than it needs to be-”
"Can't I?" Tony asks.
"Sir, power levels are back up to 100%." Jarvis informs.
“Where did it happen?” Fury demands.
keep looking over his shoulder... like he knows that Clint is following him.
"To summarize, yay, you're an ultra-good person, cause you can lift the hammer. Yay!" Clint explains.
America can’t.”
Peter: "Dad, no, you didn't-"
“Hey, I didn’t know it was a big deal until a minute ago.” Spidey protests.
"Relax. In a disguise, without my bow and arrow. So, what's his name?"
Spider-Man/Peter took the monster down in minutes. Apparently there was some kind of fracture in time in another multiverse, and it bled into ours. Tony did
He ducks under the blast, and flips onto the ceiling.
“What are your actual powers that you got from the spider bite?”
"Your not agreeing with her, are you?" Peter asks.
"Fury is... less than pleased." Clint informs him.
"Sure!" Peter grins, jumping to his feet- and then the ceiling. "Race ya!" He calls, rushing out the door.
“It was more than one color.”
Clint grabs a new arrow, and fires it at Venom. Three more fly in quick succession.
Step three- make sure Clint stays off his tail.
Is it bad that Peter hasn't told Dad (Tony) and Pop (Steve) that he's Spider-Man?
"Um... do you like it?" Peter asks.
"Steve... Peter is a super-hero. He invented his own tech to help him, like me. He ran away because of me. He came back because of me. He's too much like me. I wanted to teach him, make sure that he'd be better than me. But now... Steve, I don't want him to be the me from before. The weapon-building me. I don't want that for him. I... I want to protect him, but I don't know how. I'm as worthless as my father." Tony looks down.
Spidey stands in the middle of the road, trying with all his might to stop a runaway eighteen-wheeler from crashing into a school.
Natasha smiles, something she doesn't do too often. “Hey, Маленький паук. If Fury comes after you, tell him to shut up, and call us. We’ll sort him out.”
. Because if there's one thing I know about you, it's that you are never going to go down without a fight. You stand here, and now." He grabs his shield off the floor where Venom dropped it.
Steve blinks. "Wait... so... oh. He's going to give me a present, isn't he?"
So, the suits clean, and so am Peter. Mostly. But now, he has nothing to do to distract himself from his thoughts.
Peter smiles. "No problem. I had to get Natasha to steal your suit for a while to make the replica... so, sorry about that." Peter apologizes.
Tony stares as Peter leaves the room.
I wrote this before the Venom movie came out... so, anything to do with Venom has nothing to do with the movie. This story doesn't contain Symbrock (sadly).
Its actually pretty obvious. Natasha drags Clint from the Spider-Man argument to tell him. She takes him to an air vent, where they can talk in private.
defend him to you guys. You know what? Screw this. Let's give him hell."
Peter takes a step back. "Hawkeye. Um, what are you doing here?" Maybe Peter can fool him.
Peter blinks again. "Erm..."
Okay, well, he loves his family. Uncle Clint, Aunt Nat, Thor, and Dr. Banner are his honorary family. Dad and Pops
Tony sits up. "Yeah. I'm good. I'm just... a little out of it, that's all."
Venom, distracted with Tony, looks up just as the heating device slams into his face.
"Multi-verse dragon-dinosaur that could time travel." Peter corrects.
Said assassin smirks. Then she quickly wipes her facial features clean.
What. The. Actual. Heck. This is the
Yep. This isn't good.
Peter smirks. "Look who's talking."
“Other than that?”
"That's not all. Because, as much as I desperately want to be normal, I can't. Like you said... its in my DNA. A line of coincidences set into motion, and I wound up like this... permanently. But... I'm different. I'm not a mutant, born with my powers. I'm not like Pop, who volunteered. I'm not like Bruce, who invented them by mistake. I'm not like Nat, who just trained to the top and stayed there. I'm... I'm a mistake. I shouldn't even be alive." Peter says. And... its true.
"Good." Fury hangs up.
Fury shoots him a look. “Not so fast. I want to talk to you. Your a teenage superhero whom Mjolnir deemed worthy, yet you're a loose cannon. Unlike the Avengers, who work with SHIELD supervision, your a kid who dresses in spandex and does whatever the hell he likes."
"Very well! And you, friend Rogers?" Thor asks.
"I'm good. So, how was your day?" He asks.
Peter nods, and grab onto the archer. "Lets go." He starts to swing off, a cursing and terrified Clint clinging to Peter like he'll fall at any moment.
Clint walks into the room, holding a broken bow and covered in decaying black webs. "Not a word." He warns Tony.
"Good." Peter nods. "You?"
"You aren't. Tony, trust me when I say you are
Peter sighs, and puts his head in his hands. “Brock... why would you do this?” He asks aloud, not directing the question to anyone. There’s no one to ask.
Tony walks in, looking annoyed. “What the heck is going on here?”
Clint sits down across from him. “How are you feeling?” He asks.
Arto shares a glance with Omari, who looks just as nonplussed at he feels. He goes and closes the door, sits next to Omari, pulling his blanket around his shoulders and clutching his pillow to his chest.
By the time he’s got that out of his system, it’s mid-morning and he’s starving. He’d go straight down for breakfast but Bucky always narrow-eyes him after he’s had what Steve determinedly calls ‘alone time’, like he can literally smell it on him or some shit. It’s beyond embarrassing - actually, it’s beyond mortifying because he knows Steve has the same enhanced senses as Bucky, so if Bucky is smelling him or picking up on his body language or reading his mind or whatever, then Steve is too.
“Why are you freaked out?”
“He might be,” Steve offers. “I did eventually...Bucky went away to the army, right? I had to learn to be without him. But even if you and Peter don’t come out the other side exactly the same as you were, then it’s fine. Friendships change. He might be your Natasha friend. Or your Sam friend.”
“That’s amazing!” Arto decides, standing up and walking over so he’s nearly directly under Peter. “This is so cool! Why didn’t you tell me sooner? I don’t care that you’re a freaky spider mutant!”
He wakes up the next morning and finds that it’s snowing outside. He crawls out of bed, dragging his blanket with him and takes a few moments just to sit by the window, resting his forehead on the glass and watching the flakes drift down past the neighbouring skyscrapers.
“Okay,” Sam says. “Codeword is ‘Eagle’ if you want me to take Steve down a notch or two.”
“Well, it’s the Stark Foundation, so it’s really half and half,” Tony says. “Mind if I call in some exposure on the Stark part for a moment? Yeah okay. So my better half is not here tonight because I, as a genius who never likes to admit he’s wrong, have to say that I got things wrong and upset him enough so that he’s not here tonight.”
“No they won’t, you’re a super soldier,” Peter says, starting to laugh. “The Winter Soldier drops you off in the morning, no-one will dare say anything.”
“Course it will,” Bucky says, gently moving Anna’s hands away. “Headband stays on, baby.”
Arto lifts the phone to his ear. “Hello?”
“Clint is….” Arto begins, and he trails off this time, obviously still a little unsure.
Arto gave him a funny look. “Clint was there.”
Tony nods slowly, looking impressed. “Look at us, having a real mature conversation. In the middle of a cafeteria in the world’s most boring museum.”
Tony greets him by kissing the screen of the cell phone, of course he does. Arto feels his chin tremble and reaches out to touch his own screen, wishing he was there with Tony so he could throw himself at him for a real hug. Tony’s eyes are very bright. Thankfully, he doesn’t cry, just takes a deep breath and starts talking way too quickly. “So, press one to talk about my error in judgement, press two to talk about Peter Parker’s disappearing act, press three to talk about the books Steve just sent me.”
“Yes,” Arto says. “I told you like a million times. Can I pick the music?”
Arto nods, feeling exhausted. Everything still feels awful and he thinks he’s pretty awful too but he doesn’t have the energy or the wherewithal to try and figure it out right now. So instead he just slumps further down, closes his eyes and listens to the steady thump of his dad’s heartbeat under his ear.
“You didn’t even say sex first time round!” Bucky says. “Oh my god, you’re hopeless.”
“I’m,” he tries, hears his voice crack. “I’m sorry you have to deal. With me.”
He shoves at Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky doesn’t even move an inch, simply raises a bored eyebrow. Flushing, Arto elbows him in the stomach and then darts into a bustling Gap store before Bucky can elbow him back.
“Get off of the carpet
“I won’t if you won’t?” Steve offers, setting a hand on his shoulder.
Arto sighs, pushes himself back away from Tony. He’s the same height as him now, but still feels super tiny when Tony holds onto him, both hands on the side of his neck.
How he seemed to be there for so long.
with the eleven bedrooms and two dining rooms and six bathrooms and library and gym and helipad and quinjet hangar - is pretty awesomely awesome, the pool is still the most awesome thing about it.
“I just want to know what he did,” he says lamely.
“No, Art,” Steve says, firmer. “It can wait.”
He pushes away from the window and glances down at his phone. Still no reply. He tries to take in a deep breath but can’t, instead turning and hurling his phone across the room. It hits the brick wall behind his bed, bouncing down onto his black sheets. It doesn’t break - of course it doesn’t, Tony made it - and just sits there, screen still lit up and showing the background of him, Tony and Steve at Coney Island.
“What if I don’t want to forgive and move on.”
“You didn’t have to, you didn’t,” Arto says.
They get to the airport, and he suddenly realises that some shit is going down because Bucky is crouching down in front of Anna’s pushchair and kissing her, expression wavering. He then stands up and pulls Clint in by his shirt so he can kiss him, before promptly turning on his heel and walking away.
Steve is up before Arto in the morning, and wakes him up by playing an excessively loud reveille through his phone, because he thinks he’s hilarious. Arto throws a pillow at him which of course misses, and Steve just laughs and walks out, leaving the bedroom door open because of course parents don't care about privacy.
“I’m still on Smol Avengers clock,” Clint protests, but takes her anyway. Kate and Pietro both immediately crowd around, Pietro stroking the back of Anna’s hand with his finger and grinning with delight as she grasps hold. Kamala stays on her seat, blushing some more as Steve strikes up friendly conversation. He glances over to Tony with a meaningful look that Tony interprets as
"We have two evacuation plans for Arto,"
“It’s Olympic sized!” Clint shouts, doing a cartwheel along the pale blue bottom of the pool. “Who has an Olympic-sized pool in their yard?! This is insane!”
“They’re special,” Bucky sing-songs, rattling the box in front of his face. It doesn’t make the usual cereal noise, and Arto immediately sits up, looking from Bucky to the box and back again.
“What?” Steve asks, grabbing for Arto’s wrist as Arto pulls at his belt, ineffectual in his attempts to haul Steve across the floor.
“Any more ideas, Art?” Clint asks, turning his head to look at him.
Bucky fixes him with the sort of look that reminds Arto of Natasha. It’s all searching and quiet and makes him feel like his brain is being X-rayed.
Two more shouts of his name and Tony appears in the open doorway, a huge loop of cable clutched in one hand. “Oh good, you’re back,” he says. “Hey, how do you feel about moving out of the tower?”
“I was not scared of the baby.”
Arto happily obliges, and Steve and Bucky turn around again. This time, Steve just nods and immediately walks towards the door, leaving Barnes to take over the video call.
He frowns. “I’m in Chicago.”
“No, a cake or a party would be a surprise, this is
, he would have left us all alone and we’d have to be alive without him-”
” he begins, and then cuts himself off. Good, because Bucky has taken to pinching people who cuss in front of Anna.
“No,” Steve says, looking down at his knees. “I need a few days to have some space from Tony.”
“Do you have eight legs?!”
Tony grins. “Now, do we go and stop them stair-surfing, or do we do that reprehensible parent thing where you ignore something for your own sanity?”
Arto almost chokes. He could very happily go the rest of his life without ever hearing Tony say that word again. Regardless, he just nods. “Mostly,” he says. “I was only...six?”
He’s re-awoken by the shift of the mattress as Steve sits on the end of his bed and a fraction of a second later the smell of breakfast foods hits him and he struggles groggily into a sitting position, grabby hands at the ready.
“Green,” he says, and Steve nods and mouths ‘green’ back at him.
“What? No!” Arto protests but Clint steps in to hustle him out of the room. He would object but he knows that if he resists then Bucky will come to help and Bucky has a metal arm and is only wearing a towel.
is, by this point. He feels so stupid and small and lost. He shrugs.
Swinging his legs out of the bed, he spots his phone on his bedside table, carefully placed there while he slept. He snatches it up and feels another dull blow to his stomach as he finds a text from Omari, one from La’Taya from his Midtown math class but nothing from Peter.
Steve pushes himself up, dragging a hand down his face. He shakes his head slightly and then leans over to click the bedside lamp on. He’s suddenly very alert and awake, in that weird snap way he does if the Avengers alarm goes off.
“Arto is with me,” he says immediately. “I will call you back later if you want to have it out with me, but he is here and he is listening.”
He may have momentarily forgotten that his dad is Steve Rogers.
“Have you met Dad?”
“Seconded,” Steve says, braking hard to avoid the pandemonium of removal vans and SHIELD agents. They’re like ants crawling over the driveway, moving in a haphazard column up to the front door. The front door which is actually two doors, at the top of a set of wide stone steps. It’s almost as wide as the freaking steps that lead up to his school. Fuck, he can’t live in a house that’s as fancy as the goddamn mansion school he goes to, that’s just
“I’m not.”
“Tow!” Anna gasps, leaning forwards to try and get the phone. “Tow!”
“He’s scared of going,” Clint says.
“Only in the elevator, the hallways and the lounge.”
“You love it,” Tony says dismissively. “Your own bunch of wannabe superheroes to train as you see fit? You’re like the puppet-master.”
“Okay,” Tony says. “You want me to read them too?”
“I know one looks like a kids’ book but it's got an adults’ guide in the back,” Steve says before he can react. “So you can read that bit? I’m not trying to be patronising or anything-”
“You’d be surprised.”
“Not leather.”
“Oh yeah, the Caribbean thing?”
He is in love with his new nails as much as he is the old ones. They’re so bright. He can’t stop staring at them. In the cab ride home he takes a picture and sends it to Natasha. She doesn’t reply and he realises that he didn’t expect her to - just like Steve said, she’s sometimes off doing her own thing. Now if Omari didn’t reply within an hour, Arto would suspect that something is wrong.
Steve doesn’t say anything. His jaw clenches tight and he puts his shield down, folding his arms across his chest. Arto stares as Iron Man shifts slightly, enough so that Arto knows he’s looking at him. A red and gold armoured hand comes up in a wave.
“I think Tony has made an impulse decision which normal people would take months of discussion and planning and
“Yes,” Arto says honestly. “There's so many words, right? But I'm not any of them. I don't think, anyway. I'm not genderqueer or non-binary or transgender or any of those. I'm a boy. A man.”
They end up sprawled on the couches, pizza boxes between them. They restart the film but don’t make much more effort to watch it the second time around. Arto licks pizza grease off his thumb, watching Steve as he stares absently at the screen, the lights from the TV playing over his profile. “Can I ask you something?”
Arto cringes; here in the cold light of morning, when he's rested and not being an emotional wreck, his meltdown seems so stupid. “It's okay it's not a big deal,” he says quickly.
“Never mind,” Steve says. “I’m going to plead ignorance. What do you want for breakfast?”
“So he can be a boy,” Arto says slowly. “Even if he has boobs?”
So he keeps his mouth shut as Bucky tugs a pair of boxing gloves onto his hands, listens carefully as Bucky tells him how to stand, how to hit. He can feel the anticipation swelling and cresting inside him, alongside all the nasty rotten feelings from the past few weeks.
Arto grins, steps into the elevator. “Sir, yes, Sir,” he says, popping a salute.
He nods into the pillow but doesn’t take it away from his face. He hears Steve walking away.
And Arto is nodding, letting go of the rack so he can slump into Bucky instead, wordlessly asking for a hug. Bucky does, briefly wrapping his arms around him and squeezing before letting go and stepping back, making Arto stand up straight.
Shit, Arto can’t remember the last time they looked at each other like that.
“Be good,” he whispers to Anna.
“Okay hear me out,” Tony says, holding a hand out like he's a lion tamer or some shit.
“Of course I did,” Steve replies. “And I didn’t want to wreck this for you by not finding some help.”
And Arto feels so childish when he reaches for Steve’s hand and asks “really?” in a tiny small voice. Fuck, he’s seventeen he shouldn’t need to be holding his dad’s hand.
"Of course. Dare I ask about the other ones?"
Arto sends the message, keeps his phone in hand as he stares out of the car window. They’ve been on the road for three hours already, both of them quiet and not really in the mood for talking. It’s okay though; Steve had bought him breakfast with a smile and Arto had given him a hug to try and say thank you. Not just for the breakfast, but he’s not sure Steve understood.
“Bucky!”
“And?”
“She’s learned how to kiss,” Clint explains. “Which for her is just mashing her face against whatever she wants to kiss until it kisses back. Works with me and Buck, not so much with the couch or her Bucky Bear.”
Steve looks at Arto, back to the Princess. “You want to be the Princess.”
“Solnishka?” Steve says in an undertone as Arto turns around with Bucky Bear clutched in his arms, burying his face in Steve’s hip.
Arto stares down at the chipped polish, feeling like he could cry about it.
Which is fine, because Arto has plenty of other crap to be overwhelmed about anyway.
“That’s never going to stay on,” Clint laughs.
“And I’m glad you’re mine,” Steve says into his hair. “Boy, girl, neither, whoever.”
Tony shakes his head violently, Steve winces and Arto sits bolt upright, knocking his breakfast to the floor, a fraction of a second before he elevator dings merrily open, spilling Clint and his brood of baby superheroes out into the communal floor.
for Liz, who puts up with small children when she's trying to work. (and for me, because I miss Arto verse and wanted to write more. I'm not even sorry.)
he’s too late. The giant TV is on and Steve is standing there with the remote in hand, staring at the news anchor who is happily smiling away next to a picture of Tony and Steve at last years gala. Oh god, picture-Tony is holding up a hand in a wave and picture-Steve is looking at picture-Tony, beaming like he's the best thing in the whole universe.
Bucky scrapes a hand over his face and nods. He shakes Clint’s shoulder, leans over to tap something against the side of his face with his metal fingers. Clint grunts, then a hand appears to smack its way across the shelf, groping around until it lands on his hearing aids.
It’s the day after the revelations during movie night, and Steve and Tony are having a silent
“Okay,” Arto says, through a shuddering breath, his chin wobbling violently. More tears slip down his cheeks and Steve's heart breaks a little; he knows Arto is genuinely distressed when the tears outweigh the noise he's making. Arto sniffs hard and then wipes his nose on his wrist. Steve manages to hide his grimace by the barest of margins. Arto coughs, looking miserable. "You do it."
“Lucky Charms.”
“Remember you’ve got to call Peter before ten if you want him to come over,” Tony says. Arto blinks at him for a moment and then it clicks that Tony is giving him an out. He nods quickly and then he’s gone, heading for the stairs and nearly colliding with Bucky as they cross paths in the doorway.
Arto just wants food, honestly. They can do whatever they like but they’re in the way and that needs to be remedied before he dies of starvation.
And despite what he said to Steve in the car yesterday, a part of him is very, very scared about finding out what Tony did.
“You’re on the ceiling!” Omari manages to say. “On the ceiling!”
“What are you talking about, your best friend is Bucky and Tony says you and Bucky are so codependent that you might as well be married.”
“You do not know how glad I am that I got the ready-made six-year-old,” Tony says.
“You cuss at me and there’s consequences, kiddo,” Bucky says, recapping the bottle and tossing it to Arto who just about manages to catch it. Bucky wipes across his forehead with his wrist, turns back to the punching bag. “Nice nails.”
“Yeah when I was younger, when you’re young it doesn’t matter,” Arto says, his voice getting louder and more high pitched. “You don’t know anything when you’re young, and I’m seventeen and my brain is breaking-”
Another Counterpart instalment finished! Thank you to everyone who has ever dipped into the world of my favourite baby super-solider; your support means more to me than anything. I have one more big story planned for this universe but am ALWAYS down to talk about Arto and Co., and I do take requests and prompts too :D
So he supposes he can understand the Commander, a little.
“Lucky for you,” Steve says, hands fitting around Tony’s shoulders, “you’ll have all the time in the world.”
It doesn’t feel like it though, and it’s all Tony can do not to stiffen as Sarah clings, her little hands fisting in his shirt.
“I’ll bring her back with me,” Steve promises, stepping back. “We can all have dinner, together.”
Steve had been sure he was dreaming, until the sting of the needle registered as a bit too real, and Clint had stumbled upon them.
That look - of utter adoration, and something else Tony won’t name - has no place in Steve’s eyes. Not for Tony.
guns, until he gets the hint and walks forward, his wariness heightening with each step towards Evil Steve, whose eyes don’t leave his.
“Steve.” Tony’s voice is very soft. “Look at me.”
Steve does not move, does not blink, does not breathe. He stands there frozen, head ringing, blood roaring in his ears and curdling on his tongue. Clint makes an ugly noise.
Clint holds up his hand. “Wait... is this the same Brock that you saved from being beat up earlier?”
Clint sticks his head in. “We will? I mean, we will.”
“What?” Peter asks, looking at him with a look of hopelessness and desperation.
Peter is grinning, and the device beeps.
There's a flood of people behind him, but the watch beeps at him. "Flash Thompson recognized." It beeps.
"'Cause he told us. He said that
you once. You think we would not remember the one who abandoned usss?" Venom snarls.
"Yes, actually." Peter shoots back.
Peter misses Thor. He misses his booming voice, and how he’s always shoving his face full of Pop-tarts.
"I didn't know until Peter gave me his present. What'd he give you?" Tony prompts.
after you, and I’m thinking any agents that try to take you down would regret it.” Steve suggests. “I mean, if they figure it out, Tony could hack in and delete it. And, you could always be an Avenger. Unofficially, of course.”
"I can't fly, but does web-slinging count?" Peter grins.
And then Pepper walks in.
Peter lands a few blocks away from the Tower, with that stupid grin still stuck on his face. Its too much fun not to enjoy.
Peter nods. "I just... I'm gonna go to my room."
Steve smiles a small smile. Maybe no laser grids, after all. Heck, Clint might've done a better job than him at cheering Peter up. Clint grins, and gives him a thumbs up. Suddenly, he falls out of the air vent. "Nat!" He yells.
Clint stops. "Tony doesn't think your useless, Pete. He was getting mad at himself, blaming himself for you running away, because of the things he said. He cares about you, Peter. He loves you."
But... most of all, he misses Peter Parker. He miss getting to be
"Sir, she says its urgent. And relating to Peter." Jarvis adds.
He misses Nat. He misses how she’d call me Маленький паук, how she’d give him that smile that only he could coax out of her.
"Tony..." Steve warns, but he doesn't listen. Steve walks up to him and grabs his arm. "Tony, no."
Now, time for him to get his priorities straight.
Peter gets to his feet. "Who am I to live? Who am I to have this power? Who am I to change peoples lives? Who am I to choose one life over another? Who am I to be a hero?" He asks the empty space before him.
Clint’s jaw drops open. He snaps it shut. “I feel stupid now.”
." Clint tells them. "Then he shoved me out of his way! I mean, being mean to you is off limits, but being mean to both of us,
A look of confusion sweeps over Clint's face. "Pete, are you alright? You've been acting a bit off..."
“Okay. So, what spider bit you?”
So, once again; Why Peter? Why did the spider bite
“Well, in the army, we’re taught that, yes, following orders is good. But, if its a stupid, dangerous, reckless order, then it shouldn’t be followed.” Steve explains.
The symbiote draws back. Anyone looking at Peter would think he looks normal.
Tony looks down. "Steve... he tried to repair all the damage that happened when he stopped the truck. He... according to Clint, he... he might be feeling guilty. Like he can't be a hero."
with the cops, he could clear his name!"
"Stupid..." Clint strains against the webs, to no avail.
He just... he doesn't know if he
Spidey scratches the back of his neck, and stands up. “Um, teenager. And, um, I guess I’ll be going now.”
Peter sighs. "God. Which way did he go?"
“Peter-”
Peter smiles, and nods. "Welp, I've gotta go. Try to be nicer, okay?" He then swings up next to Clint, a smile on my face. One that isn't forced. Its been a while.
The bell rings.
"Fine." Clint growls, walking out of the room.
Clint nods, sitting up straighter. "Yeah. C'mon, we need to tell the rest of the team."
Tony hesitates a moment more. "Okay."
"I'll do so, sir. If I may recommend the fastest route to the site of the attack?" Jarvis offers.
went on the field trip to the labs. And 14 of them went to the spider exhibit. 8 of them were there when the spider got loose. And 2 of them were next to it. One of them was bitten.
Steve blinks. What is Clint hiding?
He then webs Clint's hands to the floor with black webbing.
"Tony, we can't go back down this road." He tells the hero.
Bruce looks away. "I know, Natasha. I... I just... Its Peter. Peter was-
“Where in north america?”
And that's not even factoring in the chances that he'd get radiation poisoning, or turn into a hulk-like creature.
"Peter... how bad is it?" Clint asks.
reason, I’m doubting that a regular high-schooler can just pick it up. Ya know, seeing as Captain
"Peter..." The guy looks confused. "Oh, you mean Parker!"
Steve chuckles. Sometimes its fun having little kids for partners.
Clint looks around, for any sign of where he might be. But if he's still here, he's as good as gone.
Another SHIELD agent enters the room. Must be 'Coulson'.
!” Natasha demands, not really caring about the last one, but yelling it all the same.
A cop comes into view of the screen, holding a gun. "Spider-Man! Put your hands up!"
Natasha turns to Peter. "Peter..."
Thor, Banner, Steve, Nat, Clint, and Tony look expectantly at Peter, who stands in his Spidey costume at the front of the room.
Clint nods.
“Your alter-ego, Маленький паук.” Natasha adds, silently joining Clint.
“But, he’s clearly keeping secrets. We should find out what, first.” Clint points out.
with him. And Peter is in his Spider-Man costume.
“On planet earth.” Peter smirks.
Clint's outfit is a decent disguise. A simple light green shirt, solid blue jeans, a purple cap, sunglasses, and converse. No one even looks twice. No one even guesses that there's an Avenger just a couple feet away.
Tony grabs his phone, and dials Steve. He starts talking before Steve can even say hello. "Steve, Peter hasn't been eating enough because of his increased metabolism. He's literally going to starve himself to death!"
“Where in the USA?”
Tony nods. "Congrats, kid."
He didn't know it was Peter. He loves him. He does.
"You're the best, Jarv." Peter laughs, running out of the room.
As he’s apologizing, Nat drags him out of the room.
Um... another one.
Peter shrugs. "So-so." He replies.
Peter walks into the room. "What did Flash do?" He asks.
Everyone's surprised. "WHAT?!?"
Bruce takes a breath."I do, Nat... I do. I just... he-"
Tony sighs. "Steve, please. I- I need this."
"Peter, you are going to eat. No arguments taken, discussion over." Steve insists.
"So, lets start planning, then." Nat decides. "I want to punch this jerk."
He puts his head in his hands. God, how much has he insulted Spidey in front of Peter?
“That might be a good idea.” She agrees. A hulk incident wouldn’t help anyone, especially in a tense situation like this.
"I still think we should just beat him up. What goes around comes around." Natasha comments.
Peter climbs up the building, and hacks into the SHIELD comm he stole. “Who is this?” A voice asks from the other side of the comm.
"He also says to run." Venom adds, slowly looking up to meet Steve's eyes.
“Um, hate to be the voice of reason and logic, but Fury isn’t exactly going to love this idea. So, what are we going to do? I mean, we can either try to tick him off as much as possible, or calm him down and convince him. So... what one?” Stark blabbers.
Peter pauses, but then nods, a firm resolve in his eyes. “Yeah. I do.”
“Oscorp.” Peter just wasted an entire minute on a two-syllable word.
"Okay." Steve relents.
Shit.
Tony grins. "Do I like it? Peter, this is genius! How long did it take you to make it?" He asks.
"Yeah, but webs and spandex give me more mobility." Peter argues.
"It's still no." Steve tells him gently. "C'mon. Lets go to the labs, okay? You like the labs."
Nat sighs. “Well, your not wrong.” She mutters.
Peter nods. "Okay. Look, I'm sorry about-"
"Not now, Clint. I'll make fun of you later. For now: Peter." Tony tells him.
She stares at me with an expression that says
The jock turns. "Huh? Who're you?"
Eddie shrinks back, away from Flash.
Peter: "-I don't blame-"
running around with one? Uh, no!" Tony shoots back.
The star-spangled hero nods. "Good." Then, he scoops up the genius in his arms.
Steve smiles back.
Jarvis decides to interrupt. "Sir, Director Fury has entered the building."
Less than a minute has passed since Natasha entered the fight.
"C'mon." He storms out of the room. Natasha follows him.
Natasha puts a hand on his shoulder. Steve pushes her aside. Bruce walks up to him, an expression of sympathy and pain on his. "Steve... I'm sorry. I don't- I can't- Peter-" He stops. "I'll be in the lab."
He needs to stop drinking, but its not like anyone can stop him.
Being vague isn’t working. Maybe being ridiculously talkative will. “Um, so, I’ve got the proportional strength of a spider, I can climb walls (don’t ask me how), I have super agility and speed, I don’t die from web-slinging or feel woozy while upside-down, I have horrible luck, I have a super-healing factor that isn’t nearly as good as Wolverine’s, um, oh, I have my Spider-sense, erm, an increased metabolism, the awesomeness I mentioned, as well as the trouble magnet, super good looks, quick reflexes, and being super talkative.” Peter takes a breath. Whew.
"Bruce. Its okay." The ex-assassin tells him.
"He has a secret identity." Steve points out.
But he can do nothing but watch as Peter leaves the room with that grin.
“Where in the north-eastern hemisphere?”
“Okay. Now, can you tell me what your exact powers are?”
"He's-"
Banner is in the labs, and Nat is training. Pops went out for a jog, and so, now, its just Clint, Dad, and Peter.
“Spider ones.”
"Who- who's your host?" Spider-Man demands, clearly angry.
Apparently so. Steve drags him to the couch. Stupid super-soldiers. He makes the billionaire sit down. "Tony, you can't drown your problems in alcohol."
His enhanced strength makes it difficult to break his grip. But Clint twists his arm so that Peter can't keep ahold of him without breaking his own wrist.
Tony frowns. There's something off about how Peter is talking- but he can't put his finger on it.
He starts to trudge to bed. "G'night." He mumbles under his breath, not really caring that Clint won't be able to hear him.
Duh! Is Clint reading him! That's it!
As soon as he finishes making his coffee, Clint steals into the room, takes it, and storms off.
"Ugh.... again? I just went to one yesterday!" Tony complains.
Steve's face softens. "Lets go talk-"
Bruce speed walks away, and Natasha starts to follow him, probably to prevent a hulk incident.
"Of course, sir." Jarvis replies. But a moment passes, and instead of getting the schematics, Jarvis says, "Sir, there is a winged man calling himself 'Vulture' attacking Queens."
Peter is sitting back in the warehouse. Hopefully, from the difficult and obscure false leads he set, he's thrown Clint off his trail.
be helpful in teaching me to control my powers better."
Peter frowns."But-"
God, he sounds like an evil genius when he says that.
Clint asked Peter to come to the training room. Now, he’s here, but Clint and Natasha are hiding.
of okay!" Bruce yells. He's turning green.
Peter nods glumly. “I’ll be in my room.” Peter sets the symbiote on the counter, and runs out of the room before anyone can stop him.
Nat takes a breath. "Hey, big guy. Suns getting real low." She says softly.
“What do you mean?” Clint asks.
"He's not an Avenger, though." Rogers reminds Tony.
“Which lab?”
"Do you know how hard it is to argue with Natasha?" Clint asks.
"Okay then." Steve starts making another. Thor chuckles slightly, still eating his pop-tarts.
"Lets work it off. C'mon. You go to the labs to get this kinda stuff out of your head, right?" He asks, already knowing the answer.
Clint nods. “Yeah, you do.”
Peter stiffens. He does, and Peter knows he won't tell Fury... but will Fury know he's lying?
Instead, he heads to the kitchen, where Thor is eating pop-tarts. "Hey, Thor." The-star-spangled hero greets. "How are you?"
His eyes flutter open. "Tell Clint I'm gonna keep bringing that up." Then, he drifts into unconsciousness.
Tony smiles. "Why'd you even ask, kiddo?"
Taking one more cookie than his parents said he could have? Lopsided grin.
"Not here." Natasha growls, and throw the heating device at Venom, more to catch his attention that to actually hit him.
Yeah. The
“Go away.” She orders.
Peter shakes his head. "No. This'll work. It's gotta work."
Clint takes a breath. "Um... he's-"
"Hey, give this to Fury, will you? Oh, and video his reaction." Peter asks Clint, yawning. "I'mma get some sleep." His eyes are heavy, and he yawns again.
Venom.
Peter tilts his head. "What?"
Peter jumps down from the rooftop he was on. "Whats going on here?"
“No, actually. It was part of some kind of experiment. That’s all I know. It was some kinda cross-breed, but it was radioactive, too. I really dunno how it worked. I’ve tried to figure it out, but DNA is complex. Especially when you don’t know exactly what species to compare it to.” Peter explains.
Shit.
"Sixty-nine."
Spidey walks into the room, beside Clint. He looks up at Tony, and takes off his mask.
"NYC." Peter can practically see steam coming out of the man's ears, but he remains calm. Aw, that's no fun.
“I kill everyone close to me. My parents, Uncle Ben, Gwen, Aunt May... anyone and everyone who gets near me suffers because of Spider-Man.” Peter states.
The two of them head down to the school. When they arrive, the first thing Clint notices are the webs.
Later, Venom had popped up in SHIELD files. So, she read about him.
Peter seems on edge.
"Huh?" Peter asks, losing his stride.
Anyway, Natasha will be watching from the tower. Clint will be on
Think, Peter! Think!
“Sit down at the table.” Clint tells him. “We’re in the middle of a meeting!”
calling me an asshole? He's gonna regret it."
“Um.... okay. So, can you tell me exactly how the spider gave you your powers?”
"Jeez, how old are you guys?" Tony asks, stepping into the room.
"Classified." Fury says shortly.
"That's my name. Hey, I was wondering, what exactly do you think you're doing?" He asks.
"Erm, that way, but Peter, I don't think-"
and not
"Nice to know I have company." Peter comments. "I'm not planning on growing up, either."
too soon for an Avengers meeting, but Peter was the one who called it, so...
Clint is never gonna live this down.
Peter takes a deep breath in. "We can deal with Thompson later. This is more important."
Peter misses Dad. He misses how he’d let Peter help in the labs, how he’d give the boy that little smirk.
Steve nods his approval.
Peter sighs. "Look, my idea will work. Trust me, okay?"
Of course
Tony can't help but agree. Peter nods. "Okay."
?" He demands.
to say.
"No." Steve cuts him off. "Don't. The reason that he's gone is because he was a superhero. Because he was worthy. My son ran away BECAUSE HE WAS A GOOD PERSON!"
"No, I'm not." Clint admits.
Thor picks it up. “It was not a trick. This
"Seventeen?" Fury asks. He picked up on that.
Peter stares at his old friend, the guy he's known for what feels like a lifetime, the guy who taught Peter how to survive high-school and J.J.J, the guy who was once Peter's closest friend.
"Get the fuck out of my head." Peter snarls.
What? He can love web-slinging.
Brock?"
Tony turns it down 24 degrees. "Okay... here goes nothing." He turns it on.
“Son,-”
He turns, and walk over to the bar. "I'm getting a drink."
"He can hear you, but there's nothing he can do about it." Venom taunts.
Steve is tempted to follow them, but he won't. He respects their privacy.
Tony stops, shocked. "God..."
Peter looks away. He can't look into Clint's eyes, with all the pain that they hold. "Clint... I can't. I... I just can't. I'm... I'm trying to figure out who I am, and... Dad was right. I... I'm not good enough. I'm an ametuer who just happens to have powers. I mean... who am I to decide who lives and who dies? Who am I to choose one life over another?" Peter looks back up at him, taking off his mask. "Who am I... to be Spider-Man?"
Clint looks away.
"Stark, I want the Avengers looking for Spider-Man, clear?" Fury snaps.
"No drinking." Tony folds his arms over his chest. "I know."
So, there are 1,346 people in Midtown high. And 54 of them have AT science. 36 of
"No, its not, Natasha. This is the exact
“No, you don’t. You don’t even have clearance to know what my favorite pastime is.” Peter snarks.
Steve smiles, probably having no clue what we're talking about, but enjoying us enjoy it all the same.
"I'm sorry, Dad. I- I should've told you, I-"
"Remember what happened when you told your secret identity?" Clint asks, taking the captains side. "Oh, yeah! Someone blew your house up!"
So, Peter's all alone, in an abandoned warehouse. He's done a little research, at its just...crazy.
But the symbiote is still here.
Clint nods. "Yeah. They would. But, I'm gonna talk to him. What's his name?"
Steve smiles. "Peter. How're you doing?"
“Let him in.” Tony says in a professional tone.
was Spider-Man helping the Avengers fight bad guys." Peter shoots back. "What do you have against him, anyway?"
An idea sparks in Tony's mind. "Someone should stay behind and protect Peter." He decides. "Be it from Fury or Venom."
Steve runs over. "Tony? Are you okay?" He asks, picking the genius up.
"Huh?" Flash asks.
Peter, apparently, has. "You. It's you. I- I..." Peter trails off.
. I mean, the dude is seventeen." Dad lies with ease.
Hint: That was sarcasm.
"I'm fine, quit worrying. I just turned up the setting too high for the formula that I'm using. All I need to do is adjust it. Right, Jarvis?" Tony asks, already knowing the answer.
Steve nods. "Okay."
He jumps to his feet, destroying his fort. He attempts to shake the slime off, but it holds firm. “This isn’t good, this isn’t good at all.” Peter frets, starting to panic.
to be Spider-Man.
“What if you kept being Spider-Man... but didn’t work for SHIELD? I mean, its not like Fury could send
Sparks fly, and cracks grow in the ground. Eventually,
“You're an idiot.” She tells him bluntly.
Venom smiles Peter's crooked grin. He drops down from the ceiling, landing in a typical 'superhero' landing.
Dad walks into the room, a grin on his face. "Peter, I see you chose to piss Fury off. I must be rubbing off on you." He chuckles.
Flash gets in Eddie's face. "I said,
"And you didn't tell us!?!" Tony exclaims.
"Sir, you have a call from Miss Potts." Jarvis informs Tony.
Steve's heart begins to break. "No, Tony, this isn't your fault." He assures.
Peter waves it off. "Its nothing." He says quickly. "I let him do it, and don't fight back, in order to add to my 'weak nerdy kid' disguise. And it works. No one ever thinks I'm Spider-Man."
"Guys, can I just say, that Fury is yelling at me and telling me that he, quote, 'wants Spider-Man working for me by the end of the day, Barton!'." Clint informs the two red-and blue heroes.
“Of course.” Jarvis replies.
"Do what you do best. Experiment. Search. Discover." She takes a step closer. "
"Working on my armor." Tony replies.
Peter is in his civilian clothes, in case Fury decides to barge in.
Steve runs into the room, wearing the new suit that Peter made him. He quickly takes in the scene, and throws his shield at the symboite.
, he means the Avengers.
"Wait... someone is bullying you?" Clint asks.
Well, no. If he was a super villain, he'd never be able to lift the hammer.
“City or state?”
. He misses chemistry with Uncle Ben, cooking with Aunt May, studying with Gwen. He misses being the shy nerdy kid who couldn’t throw a punch to save his life.
Natasha enters the room silently from behind Venom. She makes eye contact with Clint, then sends a shock from her cuff’s at Venom.
"So... exactly how are we going to get back at him?" Natasha asks.
“Okay... what did it look like?”
"Don't hold your breath. I'm still faster in the skies." Tony shoots back.
, in order to know what to do, but Peter is already tapping.
Peter smiles, albeit weakly. "Thanks, Pops."
"Sure! Yeah, talk to you later." Peter hangs up.
Bruce locks eyes with her. He softens. "I'm sorry, Nat, I- I just don't know what to do."
The two heroes have been working non-stop on finding Peter. They've widened the area to look for Spider-Man sightings, too. But so far, they haven't seen a glimpse.
“Don’t care. We can talk about it later. The team can’t hold all of SHIELD off forever."
Tony scrambles to his feet, and sends a few repulser blasts at Venom.
Tony feels a
"No." Tony cuts him off.
Steve races in, an expression of confusion on his face. "Tony, what is it?" He asks.
Thor looks up. "Friend Steve, I am sorry-"
Peter yawns. "Kay." He acknowledges, not really listening. He's too tired to pay anything much attention.
"Spider-Man is an idiot." Tony mutters, crossing his arms.
"I know, Tony, I know. And it will go away, it'll just take some time." Steve promises.
"No." Tony sighs.
It pains Clint to see Venom smiling that grin. That body doesn't belong to him. It belongs to Peter.
"Go away." Peter calls.
"Helping." Peter murmurs.
"If you're going to use that formula, the setting is too high. You'll go flying across the room." Peter then looks around. "Oh... that already happened, didn't it?"
." Thor explains.
The door opens. Fury is there. “Stark, what is happening? Who’s the Spider-guy? And why aren’t you reading my emails? Someone other than Thor has lifted his hammer, and I intend to find out who.”
“Spider-Man.” Peter replies. That’s all he says. That’s all he
"One drink?" Tony begs. "Steve, please. I... I need this. I need to get all of this out of my head, I need to get rid of it."
Natasha walks in. "Barton, whats wrong?"
“State.”
"Flash. Flash Thompson."
Clint nods. "Yeah. Makes sense. I'm gonna head back now, tell Steve that he should quit stressing. Talk to you later?" The archer offers.
look.
Flash walks forward, along the street. Not too far away, Peter recognizes another nerd (and used-to-be-friend of his) that Flash frequently bullies.
"Not good, not good, not-"
But, he
Nat stands up next to Clint. “He doesn’t even know. He thinks there’s a rule about just not picking it up. He doesn’t know that it’s
"I'm Peter's adoptive Uncle, and I'd like to speak with you about your behaviors toward him. And before you ask, he's not the one who put me up to this. He doesn't even know I'm here." Clint tells him.
Everyone is now staring at him. Peter knows that there’s some
"Peter asked me not to tell the super-dads, but I'm still gonna give that guy hell."
"Nay, young Spider. 'Tis mine own fault." Thor looks away. "We neglected to tell thy the importance of wielding Mjolnir."
"Yeah, it is. I- Steve, I-"
"So-so." Peter smiles.
"Guys." Steve walk up to them, and puts a hand on each of their shoulders. "Its neither of your faults. Stop blaming yourselves. And Peter- Welcome home."
Fury walks out, clearly still annoyed.
"I know." Steve promises, stroking his hair. "Its okay. It's all gonna be okay."
Nat sighs.
“What, that he’s a spy?” Clint asks, confused.
Maybe because SHIELD put him in a cell. Like, what the fuck did he do?
It's coming from the lab, but it doesn't sound how Tony's experiments usually do.
Venom seems to realize what she's about to do right before she does it, seeing as he darts to the side, and tries to kick my feet out from under me.
Peter smirks. "Oh, no! Whatever shall we do?"
the secret, Clint.” The ex-assassin smirks.
important to me. He... he helped my develop temporary cures. They wouldn't last for very long, and I could only do it once a day, but... Peter was a life-saver. He... made me talk to the other guy. He helped me with him. I just... I don't know."
"Pete-" Clint starts, but Peter cuts him off.
Tony pauses, a worry line across his face. “Okay... come and get me when your done.”
"Let him go!" Peter yells, shooting a web.
"Put him through." Dad grins.
"Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth." Tony sighs. "Okay. Fine. Labs."
"Coulson, you handle him." Fury barks, leaving the room.
They're everywhere. Holding the truck back, keeping buildings together, protecting the school, fixing pieces of the road.
"Tony..." Steve sighs.
"What did you do?" Steve asks.
Tony: "I would always-"
Tony sighs. "I'm gonna go check on Peter." He walks out of the labs.
"I studied the Arc Reactor designs. I found a shortcut that doesn't have a drawback or side effect. Do you like it?"
"Okay." Tony agrees. "God, I can't win with you, can I?"
"God. I'm going to be embarrassed by Spider-based nicknames for the rest of my life, aren't I?" Peter complains.
Peter looks stunned.
Peter grins. "Do I! Yeah, I'd love to help!" He runs over. "How can I help?"
Clint will have to fix that.
"You could say that." Clint snarls angrily.
Natasha gives a simple nod of confirmation.
He hates Clint. Not really, but it feels good to say it.
“Spider-Man. I’d like to talk to you.”
“A small one.”
“Alright... what were the color
Fury walks into the room. "Jarvis, little heads up?" Peter sighs.
Fury ignores him. "I gave you all orders to bring Spider-Man in on sight, not to team up with him!" Fury snaps. "What the hell was that?"
Clint storms into the building, a look of outrage on his face. He walks right up to Steve. "Wheres Nat?" He growls.
Peter nods. "Yeah. I'm fine." He sounds angry. "Why?" He questions.
That was sarcasm. This was the worst idea ever. Why?
Natasha looks sad.
"Am not!" Clint complains.
Natasha rolls her eyes. “Lets at least find out what secret he’s keeping. Stark, with me. We have hacking to do.”
SHIELD files and Spider-Man.
Oh, Tony? He’s trying to figure out how the fuck Peter is worthy.
But not better.
"Steve's right. Peter, you got this. You can do this. I know you can." Tony adds.
“A big one.”
Tony chuckles weakly. "Have I been insulting him to much? Look, Pete, I'm sorry. I just don't want the guy to get hurt from his lack of experience. Also, he's giving hero's a bad rep."
Steve sighs. Why will no one listen to him?
have a point.
"Walking home." Eddie answers nervously.
"Okay?" Tony asks.
Peter looks around, totally oblivious. "Who's Director Fury?"
“Sir, Fury is requesting access to the meeting room.” Jarvis informs us.
“Okay, but what are your powers?”
Steve sighs. "We should just tell him. And why can't we just ask what he's hiding?"
Clint grabs an arrow, and knocks it. "Fire, explosives, or sonics!" She calls to him, jumping into the air and sending a jolt of electricity from her cuffs at Venom.
"And when we find him, we'll say hi and make sure he doesn't forget to eat." Dad has a smirk on his face, and Clint does too.
“Stark, shut up. Steve, calm down. Pete, chill. Clint, leave. And Thor,
Peter rolls his eyes at Peppers exasperated huff. "That might not be good for your health. Go on, I'll be fine. I promise."
They follow Steve to the living room, where the Daily Bugle is on.
"... point." Clint sighs.
Except he's wearing it.
Steve can't do anything. "God, we should've just told him!" He yells.
"This doesn't mean your getting out of this conversation." Tony warns, summoning his suit.
"That Venom thing really scared me." Peter admits.
He's got nothing.
"Wait!" He calls, probably too quickly. Peter turns around. "Um, do you want to help me? I could use another pair of hands." Tony offers.
Clint is about to tap out the word
"C'mon. We've gotta get out of here before SHIELD shows up." Clint murmurs quietly in Peter's ear.
“Aren’t we already talking?”
Right now, Peter is at the table. He's is tapping his fingers against it. He looks a mess. His eyes are wide and unfocused. His hair is a sticking out in all directions. He just... he looks
Steve seems to calm down a little, and he ruffles Peter's hair. "Little Spider, huh?"
Steve grins. "Making sure you don't grab anything along the way."
He screeches in pain, and Clint skids into the room.
Peter shakes his head. "No. It's not here. Wait- did you just say it escaped?!?" He exclaims, jumping onto the ceiling.
"Thine ability to lift mine own hammer 'tis rare. Only those whom the hammer deems worthy may lift it. And, the hammer has gifted only Odin and I this honor... 'til now." Thor explains.
Clint and Tony walk in. Tony is crying, and Clint is supporting him. "It's okay. Hey, its okay. He's okay." Clint tells him.
." Clint argues.
And Tony? He's not sure how he feels.
Natasha snags some sort of heating source, switches it on, and attempt to press it onto Venom's skin.
Peter snorts. Natasha needs to stop this before Fury figures out that Peter is Spider-Man. Maybe a more disciplined approach."Director Fury, Spider-Man isn't a threat. Why-"
Yeah. He's going to talk to Flash as Spider-Man.
And goes flying across the room into a wall. "Ow." He complains. "That hurt."
“He picked up the hammer.” Steve whispers.
Peter sighs. "It'd take another couple months before I start to starve. I did the calculations."
Natasha makes it to the labs first. It'll take Steve and the others a minute to realize that something's wrong. Clint will be down in a few seconds.
Venom matches it with one of his own.
Clint rewinds it to the scene of Spider-Man. He spots a tell-tale sign. "There." He points.
"I... Steve, I can't. Please, just let me. Just... one bottle?" Tony begs
"Woah! Spider-Man!" Flash exclaims.
Steve shakes his head. "Tony, no. I won't let you go back down that road."
Peter slams the button down harder, and zooms across the Mario Kart finish line in first place. "Ha!"
"He can go fuck himself." Peter snorts.
"Sounds good. Stark and I are the only others up." Clint tells Peter. "Sleep would be really good for you, kid."
Cap nods. "Of course."
know how to use technology. He just needs someone to teach him how, first.
Natasha sighs. "Bruce, we'll find him. Trust me." She assures, forcing a confidence she doesn't feel.
Peter chuckles. "Go on, Dad. I can check the the new mod on my own."
"Stark, you called him a kid. I'm going to ask this once, and one time only. Do you know who Spider-Man is?" Fury demands.
"Burn!" Clint yells.
Eddie shakes his head. "That's against the rules-"
, not Spider-guy.” He informs Fury.
Tony can't find him. He's off the grid. Under the radar.
Arto feels himself go cold. “He put himself in danger? Aren’t you guys in danger enough?”
“Okay, straight, gottit,” Nat says. “But not interested in dating.”
“But maybe wear at least a Steve-level disguise next time? You have stolen at least eight pairs of my sunglasses, you might as well wear them.”
But despite all that, and the fact that he knows the fight between Steve and Tony is far from over...he knows he’s got both his dads in his corner and with that, things might all eventually be okay.
“Just that once in the room in Asgard.”
“Yeah,” Tony sighs, still staring at the wall.
and he has a feeling that
Arto does. A few moments later he hears the swish-hiss of the workshop doors opening, and then there’s another body sitting close, draping itself over him and hugging tight.
Arto tips sideways, butts Steve’s shoulder with his forehead. “I’m okay.”
but his voice comes out too high and wobbly and he just wants it to
"Yep, yep thanks Kurt, that's awesome," he says loudly and obviously. "Arto, my friend Kurt lives at your school - you know him, he's the blue guy, right? The one who can teleport? He says he can come to pick you up and take you straight to school, so we don't have to worry about cars or anything. He can take me and Steve at the same time as well, so we can all go together okay?" He returns the phone to his ear. “Yeah, I just asked him,” he says and then looks meaningfully at Arto. “Remember when you said teleporting was the coolest superpower? And you begged Steve to let you have a go and he said no? Well this time you’re allowed! Happy Tuesday!”
Steve is visibly trying to work it out. “Have you fallen in love with the Princess?”
“Eight - eighty-three percent?” Arto echoes. “You wanted to test it on yourself and you were only
“Okay. Shaking hands is what people that aren’t Clint Barton do,” he says. “When you meet someone, you tell them your name, shake their hand and say nice to meet you. It’s polite.”
“Do you eat flies?”
“I care what they think!”
Steve laughs. “Yeah, kind of does,” he says. “How about we order pizza and make a mess? Make it feel more like home?”
“I miss you,” he says to her.
Something not too distant from fear works down Arto’s spine. “You’re just-” he starts, but he doesn't know how to finish.
he tells himself, even as he’s picturing what he’d look like wearing Anna’s headband. It’s sit right across his forehead and pull across the tops of his ears and how would it look against his blond hair and not Anna’s brown-
And anyway. He hates packing at the best of times.
Doubt starts to creep in the moment he hangs up the phone. He’d told Peter that he’d be back soon, but he doesn’t know if that’s true or not. The more he thinks about it, the more he misses home. But then the moment he thinks “well fuck it, I’ll tell Steve we can go back,” it makes him feel just
Arto nods. He doubles back to get his box. Hesitates, then thrusts it into Steve’s hands. Steve takes it without question, flipping open the lid and pulling out the pair of sneakers that are nestled inside. He looks for like two seconds and then he’s smiling, the biggest dumbest proudest smile that Arto’s seen him wear in a long time.
taking you away from your dad-”
“Little bit,” Steve says, coming in and grinning at Anna, tugging his gloves off so he can buss her under her chin. “Hello baby girl.”
“I grow on you,” Arto says seriously to Steve. “You said you’d take me for pancakes.”
“Sure,” Bucky says, like he’s just agreeing because he doesn’t want to get in an argument. Arto would call him out on how annoying it is to be spoken to like he’s a kid, but he wants very badly for Bucky to let him hit things.
“I’m going to give you time and space to work whatever it is out, because I can’t read your mind-”
Bucky pointedly gives them the finger, but then sighs and loops an arm around Arto, pulling him up onto his knee more securely.
“Not yet,” Steve murmurs back. “Please go back to bed.”
“Arto, just,” Steve says, and reaches out to put a hand over Arto’s. “Wait an hour. If you still feel that way in an hour, call him. Don’t do anything you’ll regret because you’re angry.”
Arto Rogers doesn’t say a word as Nick wanders in and shuts the door. He’s lounging back in Nick’s chair, so small his purple-sneakered feet don’t touch the floor. He’s bobbing them up and down, laces dangling down and swaying back and forth.
“Nnn,” Arto replies, already half-asleep again. He hears Steve leave the apartment and isn’t aware of much else until Steve’s return an hour later.
“I know, right?!” Clint says. Anna squeals in response and leans forwards so her face is buried in Clint’s neck; he hastily brings his other hand up to steady her. “Yes, thank you for kisses, that’s great.”
Clint slouches back towards the couches, slumping down next to Natasha. She closes her book and Steve hears the faint murmurs of their conversation over the sound of the television, which is still on and playing cartoons. Tony has turned his attention to Bruce and is talking about some sort of equation that Reed Richards has apparently sent him to look over; Tony is looking put out and Bruce is looking cautious, so Steve can only assume that Reed has figured out something pretty important. Bucky is just sitting back and watching Arto, pulling absent mindedly at his lower lip.
“Come on,” Steve says, and there’s no negotiating with that firm tone. He leads Arto out of the gallery and into a cab. He’s stopped sobbing by the time they get in, and opts for staring out of the window at the slush covered sidewalks, clenching his fists tightly so he can’t see his glittery nails.
“Out?”
“I’ll want to know the details,” Steve admits. “but I don’t want to be overbearing.”
“That’s gross,” Omari half whispers.
Arto nearly chokes. Steve reaches out to thump him on the back, eyes fixed on Tony.
“Pepper!”
“I can
“I could hold it in for one evening,” Steve says.
Bucky frowns, sitting up. “How come you know all this?” he asks Natasha, and then looks to Clint, somewhat annoyed. “How come you’ve not told me this?”
“Why is everything going wrong?” Arto says blankly.
Arto looks at the school. He looks at Steve. He looks back at the school, then at Steve again.
Bucky snorts with laughter and Tony shuts his eyes and presses his fingers to his temples.
The competition is easy. Take a selfie of Arto holding an imaginary box of cereal, upload it onto Bucky’s Instagram. Tag it appropriately, and then hope.
therapist.”
“You know when it’s time to wake up for school?” Arto whispers, and Steve clings to that sentence like a lifeline because it sounds like Arto plans on going back to sleep.
“Clint came to pick us up,” Peter explains, already nosing around Arto’s new room, looking in the ensuite and walk-in closet. “This place is the coolest. When’re you moving the rest of your stuff in?”
“You should join in massage time one of these days,” she says to Bucky. “Would be good for your temperament.”
“I know you don’t, Baby Rogers,” Clint says easily, and he presses a kiss to the top of Arto’s head like he’s ten and tiny. “Now you coming to make it right, or does Bucky get to come down and shoot out the tyres? And you know Tony’ll make you pay for it somehow.”
The Internet says that he reserves the right to change his mind.
He latches onto the thought. It’s like an anchor, stabilizing his whirling thoughts. Giving him enough strength to slowly stand up and take a deep breath.
“Gender isn’t as simple as boy and girl,” she says. “He doesn’t know that. These two quite clearly haven’t grasped the finer nuances of gender, either. I’ll temporarily let him off seeing as he’s from the forties,” she says, tilting her head towards Bucky, “but I think Arto should know.”
And he knows exactly where to find it.
Arto nods. Thinks about all the feelings he’s currently keeping on lockdown: thoughts of Peter, thoughts of that damn pink headband. They’re currently filed as unimportant seeing as his attention has been monopolized by Steve and Tony’s fallout, but they haven't gone away completely.
Tony pulls Steve in closer, so he ends up kneeling on the couch cushions next to them. “You’ll have to throw me out the window to make me leave.”
“Because me and Bruce think we’ve got something that could pretty much save the world, Art,” Tony tells him bluntly. “It’s technology being used in an unprecedented way and we think we could- well, I know we could help fix a lot of people up.”
He decides to go find Natasha instead.
“Spoiled,” Bucky chips in from over the top of his coffee, and Steve scowls.
“It’s okay,” Steve says, bringing his arms up to wrap around Arto’s skinny frame, pressing his mouth to the top of Arto’s head.
“I’ll fly back tonight,” Tony says. “I think I need to get it done as soon as possible. We need a fresh start after this mess, and I need to make that happen.”
“So you were supposed to ask why I have the beautiful Ms Romanov as my companion instead of my husband,” Tony says. The reporter makes a noise a lot like Steve just did. On screen, Natasha’s mouth twitches.
Natasha gives him a withering look. “You expect me to go on the subway when school’s still out?” she asks. “Of course we’re taking the car, unless you want to take the bike.”
And Arto cries even harder. “Yeah?” he asks. “I don’t really hate Bucky. Or anyone.”
“I mean it,” Tony says earnestly. “You  could start a revolution. You could single-handedly make ‘soccer-dad’ a hot look-”
Luckily for him, she doesn’t press him. She walks over to kiss Sam and then takes a seat beside Clint, leaning over to say hello to Anna. Anna has got cauliflower on her forehead and is tussling with Bucky over a spoon. Bucky is covered in more vegetables and is looking pained as he tries to take the spoon from her. Predictably, he gives up and lets her have it her way. “Fine, feed yourself,” he says with a roll of his eyes.
“I know,” Natasha sing-songs and Arto makes a sound not dissimilar to a growl, getting up and stalking away, his face bright red. Steve watches him go, mouth hanging open until Clint throws a piece of popcorn into it.
“Don’t talk shit about Taylor Swift, I’ll tell Steve,” Arto says.
“That’s,” Steve manages to say, clearing his throat. “That’s the best thing anyone’s ever said to me.”
“Do not care in the slightest,” Bucky says, shrugging out of his coat and then picking up one of the carrier bags. He pulls out a tiny pink headband that’s got a sequined star on the front, grinning as he loops his hands into it then deftly slides it onto Anna’s head. She immediately grabs for it, tugging to try and get it off.
Clint looks at him for a long moment but doesn’t say anything more about Peter and the vacation. “Which dad?”
Arto doesn’t get up yet. He looks at Clint, who nods. “Yeah, I told him,” he says. “He knows full well that shopping may or may not include the men's department and the women's department.”
“Yeah you did,” Arto says, thumping Tony between his shoulder blades. “Steve, where are you?” he asks, face still buried in Tony’s shoulder. “Steve!”
“Don’t worry Papa Stark, we were sensible,” he grins at him, before leaning back and patting his stomach. “I did a pregnancy test just to make double sure. Well, Bruce did when he did his fancy-pants bloodwork. No little baby Buckys in here.”
Ten minutes later and he’s bundled up in his coat, waving goodbye to Steve at the door. His heart is going double time and he’s so nervous and scared but in a weirdly good way.
“Longer than we’ve got,” Steve goes with. “Or we bundle him into a car and hope he doesn’t put up too much of a fight…”
Arto is hunched so low down in the armchair that his knees are almost at his chin, his phone held literally two inches away from his nose.
The merits of being overprotective are loudly discussed for quite some time, the conversation only stopping when Nat returns, Anna thankfully unharmed on her hip. Bucky makes a pleading noise and holds his arms out, and Natasha obliges and hands Anna straight back over.
Steve exhales heavily. “Yeah, I get it-”
not a good look on him. He swallows hard, holds out the phone towards Arto. “Tony has skipped out on the gala and he’s still on the line. He wants to talk to you. Says he needs to come clean with you too before we even talk about going home.”
“Yes, but you can’t really expect him to focus all his energy on trying to get through to you if you’re refusing to pick up the phone.”
“Dad, don’t!” Arto says, wriggling around to kneel on the cushions. “You’ll just get sad again and-”
“I sent him a picture of my shoes,” Arto says. Omari doesn’t answer right away and he senses their rapid fire chatter about Peter is over. Time for a subject change. “Hey, I think Steve’s depressed. He keeps sleeping all the time and the news said he and Tony were getting divorced.”
“Arto!” Tony sounds utterly exasperated. “Come back, are you actually kidding me right now?”
“What?” Arto asks loudly, massage forgotten as he leans on Clint’s shoulders. “I’m not confused.”
“Good,” Arto says. “Being doing an art project, and I’ve been accepted on a mechanics module, so I can do that as well as the normal stuff. Like normal maths. And like, history and stuff.”
“Tony - Tony made a call that put himself in danger,” Steve says. His knuckles are white on the steering wheel. “That’s why I’m so angry. That’s all you need to know.”
Arto nods without uncovering his eyes and Tony walks over to sit on the edge of the bed. Arto rolls over and buries his face in Tony’s hip, snaking an arm around his middle.
“Tony, wait,” Steve says, but the asshole is starting to laugh.
Bucky nudges him with his shoulder. “That’s good, right? What you wanted?”
“I didn’t want them and now I do,” Arto says. Damn, why is Clint not understanding this? Words, he needs more words. Which words though?
“You called me, that was the right thing to do,” Omari says, slightly louder. It’s like he’s taking control. “Arto, where are you?”
“Are you kidding me? School is the best,” Steve says with a wan smile. “You get to learn things and make friends. Omari will be there, remember?”
Arto huffs out a laugh, and then they both turn as they faintly hear the sound of crying. “Aw, baby, no,” Clint grimaces. “Shit. I better…”
Steve pauses, clearly a little confused. He looks at the painting and then decides not to comment or ask how Arto has gone from dragon slaying to questions about sexuality. “Well, there was a waiter in a coffee shop near the tower,” he says quietly. “Couldn’t stop staring at him. And then Tony. When we first met we fought like cat and dog. Honestly, it was like you and Bucky used to be.”
It feels like hours later before anything else happens; as far as Arto knows it could have been hours or could just as easily have been minutes. He hears footsteps walking across his lounge and then the door swishes over the carpet.
“You got him the charms, you are a friend for life,” Tony says.
Steve doesn’t look convinced. “I’m not convinced.”
“I’ll take my cell,” Arto says, trying to sound reasonable rather than whining. It’s a tough line to negotiate. “The GPS is on. And it’s like thee blocks.”
“Yeah,” Arto says. Steve's phone buzzes and Arto scowls. His dad gets more texts than him, how stupid and lame is that? He's normally texting all the time but now it's barely anything.
“Creeper,” Bucky comments, and Clint smacks his shoulder.
“Well, he says he always considered himself straight and then Bucky happened,” Steve shrugs. “He doesn’t question it, just says Bucky is an outlier and should not be counted.”
“Can we go on the motorbike?”
“This sounds fun,” Tony says, heading towards the coffee maker. “And by fun I think I mean lucky that I overheard this and not Steve, because you know the deal with the Young Avengers, Art-”
Steve nods in thanks at the security guard who steps over to press the button. The security guard just grins. “Good morning, Master Rogers.”
“He’s skateboarding down the stairs,” Steve says, blinking at the space where Arto and Peter just vanished.
“Why are there Small Avengers everywhere, and why is Arto running away from them?”
“You do,” Steve says. “You’re being very brave.”
“I’ll go talk to him,” Steve says, but Natasha just shakes her head.
“Okay,” Steve says, and Arto’s stomach flips in sheer giddy excitement. He’d hoped for Steve to say yes but he wasn’t really expecting it. “On one condition,” Steve says before Arto can get too excited.
"No," Steve says.
Then a voice from somewhere within the shop shouts back, “Hear, hear!” and all Arto can do is laugh. He breaks down into hysterical giggles, clinging onto the rack in front of him as Bucky starts to laugh too.
"Bucky had a helmet that'll fit him."
“Make a list,” Bucky says from the front. He’s slouched down so far in the seat that he looks like he’s trying to slide off of it into the footwell. “You can talk about dismantling gender constructs then your crazy parents then the nightmares.”
“Okay,” Tony says. “You want me to video call? Or I’ve got a suit here, I can get to Chicago in like two hours so we can do this face to face.”
He wakes up in the morning and dozes for a while before he remembers - bath, revelation, identity, ahhh - that he has stuff he needs to tell someone, like now. Which is why he ends up climbing into Steve's bed at eleven AM, whispering his name in increasingly louder increments to get him to wake up.
“Sure,” he says. “I’ve been speaking to Sue about it for a while, if you wanna call her and check it out-”
“You know the rule,” Steve says.
“What?” Bucky twists around to look at them, then snaps his fingers. “Oh yeah, I forgot to add your best friend being an ass to the list. Tell Julia about that.”
“He does not,” Arto says, though he can tell that Tony’s not his usual pristine self. His suit is impeccable but Arto catches the bags under his eyes and the tired look on his face just before he slides on a pair of sunglasses. He looks back over his shoulder at Steve but Steve is just staring at the TV with a look of intent that he normally reserves for battle formations and super villains.
Steve nods. “Anything you want.”
“Hey.”
“Nope,” Steve says. “What would be the point? You never listen to me when I tell you to go to sleep.”
And then there’s another thing that blows his already taxed mind.
“You want to go get it fixed?”
“He wants a full manicure and gel polish in some horrendous glittery shade, probably,” Natasha says before he can even start to think ‘oh fuck, what do I say?’ “Right?”
“Yeah,” Steve says with a faint smile, leaning over to drop a kiss onto Arto’s blanket covered head. “Pizza it is.”
Arto’s shoulders slump. Steve’s going to get him a police escort or follow him twenty paces behind or something. “Yeah?”
“What?” Steve frowns. “I’m not letting him on the-”
“What? No,” Steve says, scrubbing his hand over his face.
Arto turns to a Steve, looking for some indicator on how he should act. Steve looks calm and simply shrugs, dipping his chin a nod that clearly says ‘
“You sure? You’re pretty mad at me,” Tony says. He sounds so unsure, so cautious. It doesn’t feel right at all.
“Gone to get groceries,” Clint says, leaning in to gently kiss Anna’s head. She sits up at that, grinning at him and waving, shoving the fingers of her other hand into her mouth. “You okay?”
“Thought not.” Steve looks up at the steel-white sky, breath misting in front of his face. “Let’s sleep on it. And if tomorrow morning we want to go back to New York, we will.”
“In my room, they’re in the workshop.”
And then Steve promptly has what feels like an aneurysm because Arto turns around and points at his motorbike and says, "Please?"
“Pink.”
“You can’t tell anyone,” Peter says, pointing a finger at them both, then without waiting for an answer he walks over to the bare cream wall, then climbs straight up it on his hands and feet like some sort of fucked up lizard man.
“Don’t bring god into this, he’s not the one being weird,” Tony tells him, reaching over to take the wrench from him. “Why are you being weird?”
“Dad,” Arto whines half-heartedly. “Don’t touch my stuff.”
“Are those yours?!”
Arto feels a strange frisson of not quite panic, a twist that could be anger, could be jealousy, could be something entirely different. “What do you mean Tony said?” he asks. “Have you spoken to Tony?”
“Arto,” Steve says gently. “Tell me what you’re thinking.”
Bucky frowns at his phone. “Steve is a total babe.”
It’s like someone’s caught a hook just behind his bellybutton and
“Well, I said my part about the fresh start, didn’t I?” Tony begins. “Well a while back I was looking at your art project about homes and it got me thinking that maybe it was weird we lived where we worked, and in a tower, right? And then when you went to Chicago I checked the paperwork for the building just to check you were on it too and my property paperwork guy reminded me about this place.”
“Whatever,” Bucky rolls his eyes but does lean down to kiss Clint. “I got it," he says, holding up bags from the store, “and also got her a thing.”
“Put Tony on the phone,” Steve says.
"No," Tony says.
“What’s to consider? My username?”
“No," Clint says, patting him on the shoulder and then suddenly sitting up. “Hey, I’ve got an idea.”
Tony is still highly suspicious. He thinks about using Jarvis to snoop, or calling Peter or Omari to get intel, but decides that he’s going to show personal growth and respect for his son’s boundaries and does neither. Besides, Steve will probably cave soon anyway so then he’ll do the snooping and won’t be able to yell at Tony for it.
“Yeah,” Tony says, and his mouth flickers in a smile. “Hey, you know I wasn’t going to divorce him, right?”
“I’m happy to live wherever you and Tony are,” Steve says simply, the yawns and flaps his hand at Arto in a sort of wave. “Damn, I’m tired. I’m gonna go pass out for twelve hours, we can sort out new furniture and decorating for your rooms tomorrow, okay?”
“You don’t have to,” Steve says calmly. “You don’t have to talk to anyone until you’re ready.”
Steve gets up, walks away. He doesn’t go far though, just puttering around in the kitchen. He’s probably just doing it as a time-out from the conversation. Arto would happily take a time out from his entire life right about now.
“Not subtle.”
“I’m straight,” Arto mumbles. “But I want things I shouldn’t want.”
“Fine,” Arto replies, leans forwards to get his phone. “I will.”
“Tony’s gone crazy.”
Arto clings to Clint even tighter, praying that he’s right.
“He can’t have a crush,” Steve says, sounding somewhere between perplexed and distraught. “He’s - he’s-”
He ruffles Arto’s hair and Arto takes that as his signal to move.
“Steve wouldn’t give a shit if you decided to wear a glittery pink onesie for the rest of your life,” Bucky says, taking a swing at the bag. “And the news talks shit all the time, why is that suddenly bothering you?”
Steve’s hand settles on his shoulder. “I know,” he says evenly, “But we have to go home at some point.”
“Who gives a shit?!” Arto bellows, and he’s turning away and storming off. He’s so angry he’s shaking and it feels terrifying, this nasty wicked snarl of anger that makes him want to hurt and scream. He needs to get away, to hide.
"Art?" Clint presses.
Arto nods. “Well, I’m technically not allowed to register for the actual event because I’m...well, I’m me and I’m also a minor,” he says. “Dad’s pulled some strings. I’m allowed to accompany the event, as long as I’ve got a one to one support unit and stuff. And, uh, something to do with sponsorship being donated to the City Parks Department or something, I’m not allowed to make money off it.”
Arto’s face works like he’s trying to think of something to say. All he comes up with is a truly irritated ‘hrrrrn’ before stomping off. Tony bites back a grin and counts down silently in his head, and sure enough, as he hits zero there’s the sound of Arto stomping back. He walks behind Tony and then slumps into him, mashing his forehead between his shoulder blades and nearly pitching them both forwards into the bike.
me, he wanted me to stay with you and I said no,” Arto snaps.
Arto is sent to go and pack a bag. He asks Steve to help but Steve tells him no, that if he’s coming then he’s doing so under his own steam. Arto kind of gets it but wishes Steve weren’t being so very careful about the whole thing. They’re in this together by Arto’s choice; no-one's going to say that Steve is forcing him to go with him just because Steve helps him pack.
On screen, the reporter is trying to regain some composure. Her smile looks very forced, glued in place to try and cover the startled look that she did have going on. “That’s very cryptic.”
He wakes up at 4am with Arto kneeling on his spine, pulling at his ear and telling him to get up before they’re late. He attempts to roll Arto into a blanket burrito which has about a seventy percent success rate at getting him to fall back to sleep; however, Arto wriggles free with the ease of a greased weasel, pulling on Steve’s ankle in a futile attempt out to drag him out of bed. Steve gives in and staggers vertical, forlornly trying to remember the days when he used to get a solid eight hours.
“I don’t think I do,” Steve says. He remembers Clint’s yelp of pain as the repulsor blast caught his shoulder, Natasha’s white-ringed eyes as Tony-not-Tony fired a missile the Hulk only barely saved her from. “The Tony I knew would never make an attempt on the lives of his teammates. He - “
Tony’s mouth clicks shut. He watches, mute, as Steve visibly fights to regain his temper. Then, straightening, he starts, “I’ve given you a few days to absorb the situation, Tony. To think. Now, it’s time we discussed exactly who you are, and what your place is, here.”
He thinks himself very clever hiding it, Steve knows, and he has wondered what that means for their bond in that other place - that Tony thinks he could ever hide, in any form, from Steve. He struts and he jabs and he flashes that shark-smile, and always Steve wants to shake him, to pull him close and kiss him hard and let him know the folly of his masks.
with such burning intensity, the kind he has only ever seen directed at inventions.
“ - claiming you’re him. So stop.”
weapons, and really, nothing makes sense anymore, especially not their careful avoidance of his person, like he has the plague. Instead of being shoved forward, or handcuffed, or something, the soldiers instead gesture sharply with their -
The hole within him has eased somewhat, but it still gnaws as Steve sets his shoulders and returns to the main floor. He doesn’t remember climbing the stairs - or even leaving his room - and his hands open and close, open and close, the further he gets away from their quarters.
Steve feels like he’s been punched in the Adam’s apple. He studies the table, wondering why his heart is constricting so awfully, like a phantom hand has reached into his ribs. Tony doesn’t --
Steve - evil, he’s
says, “Oh, right.”
“I’m yours,” he murmurs suddenly, pressing a kiss to those veins, “and you’re mine.”
“He wouldn’t like it,” Steve murmurs. “He’d want to leave.”
Tony stark was arrogant and playful, belligerent but kind. He did not wear sorrow, as this man does. Grief is written clear in the gaunt lines of his features --
“Did they mean so much to you?” he murmurs.
Tony can feel his face splitting with another razor sharp smile. “It is,” he murmurs. “See, you've always struck me as a here-and-now type of guy. Take this situation for example: instead of, I don’t know, handling your grief like a normal person, you decided to force some poor bastard - “ (see: him) “ - into being your replacement hamster. If that doesn't scream
He stops struggling for a second, and says, “You won’t win this, Steve. Just - give yourself up.”
He shakes his head, because it’s too good to be true. “How?”
“It’s not him,” she says softly, without turning.
guns, but he's wielding it now like an extension of himself, pointing it right between Ross’s bulging eyes -
Whatever it is, it leaves him cold.
“Don’t kill him,” Tony orders, breathless. After a moment, he adds, “For me.”
Sarah is awake. It’s well, well past her bedtime, but her little form is hunched beneath her dinosaur-themed covers, the bright glow of what Steve thinks is a flashlight filtering through the thick cotton. Hidden as she is beneath the comforter, Sarah remains oblivious to him; the rapid movement of her arm is accompanied by a low, steady scratching.
Both scenarios are ludicrous to Tony. He outsmarted the Ten Rings under similar duress, and imagines he’d have some contingency plan for someone as blatantly dangerous as this Steve Rogers. As for the second option, well. Tony loves deeply and fiercely, with all of his soul: but no one - not Pepper Potts nor Rhodey nor Steve Rogers, Captain America - has ever had  access to
Steve tries to keep his face blank. The confusion (the
By the time he’s stopped before the other man, Tony’s mouth is horribly dry. His hand clenches in the glove as he diverts his attention to Ross, who is glaring up at them both through puffy eyes.
He watches it die, this creation he put so much into - so much tinkering and all-nighters and
Steve’s mouth parts. This
Sarah blinks at him, and then at what she’s drawn. “Daddy?” she says uncertainly.
Steve assesses her. “How do you know?”
he can’t help but bite.
Tony bites down on a hysteric giggle, his brow pressed to his knee while he explores the weight and feel of the blade. It’s cool steel, military-grade, small but solidly weighted. The real Steve never carried throwing knives in his belt as far as Tony can recall, but this Steve has made it crystal clear by now that he’s a different beast.
“Steve,” she says, and the softness of her voice - the note behind it - makes Steve’s hands spasm into fists at his sides. For a moment he is not here but in the deep gloom of that tiny apartment, his frail chest heaving as the doctor lays a hand on his shoulder, and tells him his mother is doomed.
Something flashes in those deep brown eyes. “You know who I am.”
That’s
The odds aren’t in his favor, if he reveals himself. Still.
Sarah glances back at Steve, who nods once, then breaks into a little run towards Tony. He has to stifle the urge to flatten against the headboard as she stops before the bed, peering up at him like he made the world.
Except, it’s not really Steve. Tony
Steve whispers, “Come here.”
Steve barely manages to keep his expression in check. He glances at Natasha, who is studying him with that unnerving x-ray stare.
“A massacre,” Natasha goes on, and tears her eyes from him at last to pace towards the end of the long table. She grabs the chair at its head and tells them, “As far as they can tell, General Ross was the only survivor.”
He can feel Steve’s eyes on him, lingering. Finally: “I’ll be back later, then,” Steve says, turning away. Tony holds his breath as he leaves the room, those locks clicking back into place behind him. He falls back onto the bed immediately, his chest heaving.
The news channels are disabled, he’s found, along with everything that’s not old movies and cartoons and reality TV. He wonders as he leans back against the bed what exactly it is Steve’s hiding from him. If Tony even wants to know.
His own voice has become a rather unattractive croak. Evil Steve catches his wrist and pulls him in, again, smiling down at him like he’s cute.
Because Tony is just one person. The loss of him is not so detrimental to the universe. But an insane Steve with an infinity stone in his possession spells catastrophe for everyone, across all worlds.
Steve’s eyes flash. “
Tony watches the sea undulate beyond the windows, a grim sort of purpose settling in his bones. His head is quiet. His chest is tight. He feels like he’s hurtling again toward that dark maw in the skies of New York, the same purpose closing his throat as that primordial darkness enveloped him, never to return.
he echoes after a moment, scowling. “What does that mean?”
Tony is still watching him; Steve’s whole face feels hot beneath his stare. It is as though he has been catapulted into the past, where he was small and thin and weak, breath rattling in his damaged lungs. He clenches his fists so hard the leather squeaks. In his peripheral vision, Tony’s head tilts.
Steve steps back at last, his head turning to the horizon. The sun highlights his features, makes him wretchedly beautiful as he answers, “You and I had a dream. We made it reality. That’s all.”
all he does is reach out -
Steve’s voice is soft, hypnotic to his ears: “Look at me.”
And the world jerks to a halt.
Tony chokes as his watch sparks and cracks under Steve’s superhuman strength, the repulsor glove retreating within it.
Tony knows, his hands raising to his eyes.
And if his heart shudders and his shoulders bow with the crushing force of his relief - Tony is not lost, Tony is still here - then that’s for him to know, and no one else.
“It’s alright,” Steve murmurs into her hair. And it will be. “I won’t.”
**************************
Tony’s throat bobs. It is only thanks to over forty years of play-pretend - to the world, to his friends, to himself - that he does not cower. Because it’s finally revealed itself in whole: the monster in the mirror, the fissure in the glass.
Steve watches it click and hum, this remnant of Tony.
Steve Rogers is not easily fooled in any world, he’d bet. But Tony’s always been a good bullshitter when it counts.
“You’re not
He’s about to question her when he sees how intently she’s studying him, hawkish gaze sweeping him from head to foot with an intensity that puzzles him. Before he can classify her expression, however, the doctor turns away, a frown pinching her features.
Steve,” he snaps, because really, the man is insulting him by pretending otherwise, at this point.
“Can I come up with you?” she asks, the trace of a whine in her voice.
Tony said, his hands covering hers.
He licks his lips. His hands are shaking violently. Ross’s life rests within them, Tony knows.
In the long silence that follows, the hairs rise on the back of his neck.
but Steve doesn’t give orders with such icy menace -  like your life is forfeit if you don’t obey.
------------
“That’s not true,” Steve murmurs. Tony looks up to see Steve watching him with a terrible gentleness. “You have it, now.”
“We don’t know what happened,” Bruce is saying. “He could be under the influence of something, or someone. Until we understand what, it’s best to withhold judgement.”
After a long minute, he shifts. “Come here.”
Aware of Fury’s sharp gaze, Steve lifts a shoulder. “Maybe he was after the serum.”
He lets himself be lulled into the false comfort this fake Steve provides, lets him lay another kiss between Tony’s eyes, those calloused fingers scratching at his scalp.
so he figures he and Ross both have a better chance of making it out of this if he gives himself up, now.
He thinks of the look on Steve’s face as he admitted that
He can practically hear the cogs turning in Steve’s head, the mental pat-on-the-back at a stage well-set. He barely represses a sneer.
Tony doesn’t know that he can forgive Steve for hiding a truth of such magnitude from him. Worse than Steve’s betrayal is the image seared into his retinas, of his mother’s body jerking under Barnes’s metal fingers.
as he aimed at the frozen Clint.
And Steve almost does it, almost goes to him. He’d take Tony in his arms and breathe his scent - hold him tight until the sun’s rays warmed their bodies - and the dark would go away for good. Tony would be there and right and warm in Steve’s embrace, where he belongs.
Natasha gazes up at him, unfazed. Then, after a long pause: “There were soldiers, trained and lethal. Swept through the room like it was nothing, wielding guns that don’t exist. Ross saw everything,” she says, and her eyes are cold. “The only reason he’s alive is Tony.”
because --
But Natasha is still looking at him, and the shadows have not stirred from her face.
Dinner is a long, strained affair. They sit in a loose half-circle on the bed, Tony and Sarah both making a show of eating under Steve’s watchful gaze. It quickly becomes apparent that Steve could give two shits about any sort of awkwardness regarding the situation: legs folded, calmly inhaling his soup, he is the picture of serenity, and does not bother to make conversation from his place directly opposite Tony.
He shakes his head. “Whatever managed to destroy the Capitol building from the inside and disappear without a trace is beyond them. Which means it’s our responsibility to find out what happened, and keep it from happening again.”
“I’m going to make you so happy,” Steve whispers, and this promise is far removed from the one he made a moment ago, in so many words. It makes Tony quake for a different reason.
It’s a clone, or a long lost twin, or
Tony doesn’t think he’ll miss it. Hopes not.
Setting his shoulders, he marches to the chair opposite
“I’m still
“Clint - “
A stone of dread sinks low in Tony’s gut. He doesn’t want to know, doesn’t want to hear - and asks, anyway: “What have you done?”
There is not a lick of anger in his face as he speaks, and somehow that’s worse - especially when he leans down, hands engulfing either side of Tony’s face, and says with the utmost calm, “No one is coming for you.”
The dead are everywhere, from what little he can make out, and he can hear a few unlucky civilians wailing, before short bursts of gunfire silence them.
The worst part is, no one’s coming for him. He stares desolately at the ceiling.
Natasha stands next to him, still as death. Her brilliant eyes are pinned also to the man beyond the glass, and it is as though a veil has been cast over her features.
“Is it…” Steve’s voice cuts into his thoughts, and Tony’s head snaps up to see him watching Tony with the same nervousness that had grayed Sarah’s features moments ago, if more subtle. “Is it alright?”
“The girl,” he says finally, stunning himself as well as Steve, who goes rigid above him.
“...And where is Stark?” he croaks finally.
so i've had this sitting on my laptop for a whiiiile and i don't know why it's taken so much out of me. either way i'm glad to be getting it out to you guys! enjoy!
Steve nods at him now, approval softening his brow. Tony tries not to shudder in relief.
They can’t end like this. Not with Tony hurt or lost or dead somewhere, and Steve stuck across the world, worse than useless. Just the thought sends another lash of white across his senses, and it takes ten more seconds for him to come back to himself.
Natasha turns back to the glass. Her eyes are appraising, cold.
“Well, we haven’t been able to get a word out of him, otherwise -- so unless you have a better idea, I’m going to have to insist.”
“There you are,” he hums, plainly delighted. “I was starting to wonder.”
She leans close to the glass, peering at the suspect, and continues, “We ran them four times, to be sure. DNA, fingerprints...it’s all there, sir. As far as we can tell, he
Steve sees his hands plant themselves on the wood.
He tries to get up, but he must have hit his head, because his ears are ringing and something hot is running down his scalp  -
but Tony forces himself to concentrate -
“I’d like that,” he says.
Thor is too late.
Steve sighs.
“On the contrary,” Evil Steve retorts, his brows arching. “It's the prudent thing to do. He's a witness, and we don't leave those.”
He's half-convinced he's dreaming, but no dream has ever compelled such stress from his poor heart - not even the nightmares of Afghanistan, harsh voices and rough hands and him drowning in the dark.
He instead stares at their joined hands, wishing fervently that he still had his glove. He would disintegrate this man without hesitation. He would. The one sat before him is
Sarah looks ready to cry again. “...I had bad dreams,” she mumbles.
He doesn’t remember the armor encasing To -
He thinks he hears Thor, roaring about foolishness and mistakes and his brother, but his voice sounds very far away. The world has narrowed to Tony Stark and his limpid eyes.
Steve’s hinted what awaits him down that path. He must tread carefully.
It’s deeply discomfiting being stared at like that - like he’s the only thing that exists.
“You can’t - I’m not going anywhere with you, asshole,
Steve’s eyes are piercing, knife-sharp. Tony drops his own.
Because the man beyond the glass -- who had forced a needle in his neck and nearly murdered the rest of his teammates -- looks identical to the colleague whose memorial he attended just last week. Under the harsh fluorescent glare of the overhead light, the resemblance is only more uncanny; Steve takes in the suspect’s soft brown hair and compact build, the careless way he sits, clever fingers fiddling idly with the thick cuff binding him to the table. The curve of his nose, the slope of his mouth, the bruises beneath his eyes -- all of it is familiar, each little similarity like a punch to the gut (another match to light the growing fire in his heart, both parts pain and
this was a bad idea, but fleeing isn’t an option -- not with Fury watching, and Tony gazing at him like the sun sprang from his hands.
Steve is about to wince, when Tony leans forward, again. There is a wild light in his eyes.
“And what has that cost?” Tony demands. “Your
“No, you're not,” Steve says promptly. Like his counterpart, he appears to be practiced in ignoring Tony's wit. Drumming his fingers against his bicep, he murmurs, “We found Sarah during a sweep of one of the last Hydra compounds. We’re not sure exactly how she came about, but tests showed that, biologically, she's ours.”
And Tony is a genius, but even he’s struggling with this one.
. They were misguided, meddling fools who couldn’t have cared less about you, Tony.”
the Director continues.
Clasping his hands, Steve steels himself and starts, “So you know my name. Care to tell me yours?”
And even if Steve
Looking back at Tony, he says, “We’re not quite finished, here.”
Needs more unicorns, he thinks, with an edge of hysteria.
He’ll have to get her alone, somehow. Build trust between them. If she already thinks Tony’s her father, then it shouldn’t be hard.
Tony could vomit. Steve’s talking like he’s not gonna murder him though, which, considering Tony’s own promise, is...
“Morning, big guy,” he rasps, and turns. Steve towers over him, equal parts magnificent and terrible. He’s wearing the dark armor Tony first spotted him in, a fortified but sleek ensemble of kevlar and leather and titanium alloy. It’s a superior version of the stealth suit Tony glimpsed his Steve in, once or twice, and as Tony takes him in he has the thought that it, too, is his design.
“You haven’t been sleeping,” Steve murmurs, and Tony hates it, hates the concern softening his words, his eyes.
He carefully doesn’t include himself in that statement. This Steve, wherever he came from, seems to have mistaken him for - for
“Good?” Steve asks. The look of quiet amusement he wears - brows arched, mouth upturned - is so familiar that Tony nearly breaks the plastic fork in his grip, his heart twisting sharply in his chest.
His gaze locked on Tony’s, Steve murmurs, “You aren’t going to be a problem, are you, Tony?”
He cards a hand through his unruly hair - he really needs a haircut - and resumes flipping through the TV’s channels. He spent an hour weighing the potential of scrapping it for its circuitry where it takes up the wall, but nothing he could build from it will get him far.
He’s who knows how many worlds away from home. The only one who can help Tony is himself.
And he fired. Steve still can’t believe it.
Focusing on the sea below, Tony asks, “What happened to the Avengers, exactly?”
is still on. She starts as Steve gets his arms around her, hoisting her easily onto the bed. “Up you go, princess.”
Steve will fix this. He can’t repair the Capitol building, or reclaim the lives of those poor innocents, but this one thing - this one thing he can do. He can save this man he once called friend, all quick hands and sharp tongue and brave heart, whose mind conceives worlds Steve could never dream of knowing.
She is afraid.
Steve - he has given up on trying to distinguish the two, at least in terms of nomenclature - is a cold presence at his back. Tony lets his shoulders sag, for just an instant. Then he sets them, and opens his eyes.
“Do you understand?” Steve murmurs. His words are poison yet his voice itself has not wavered from that loving warmth. Tony hates it -- hates him. He trembles as Steve moves away from his ear to rest their brows together.
Steve hums. “How long until they reach us?”
“He’s been asking for you,” he says, stuffing his hands in his pockets.
He is weak, and a fool, and a failure. But he is also Anthony Stark, a fact Steve seems to have forgotten, if he ever really knew at all.
. His blind rage starts to abate as they near the bedroom, that ravaging fire supplanted at last by the first pangs of self-preservation, and he keeps quiet as Steve pulls him inside.
Steve blinks. Frowns. Shakes his head, uncomprehending. “I don’t understand.”
is not an acceptable answer,” Steve says, with ice. “Tell me why.”
And Steve -- Steve sucks in a sharp breath, his pulse stuttering, stomach swooping, heart
hand, so much as the way his face morphed in the moonlight, tenderness evaporating into something cold,
Silence clouds the room, stiff and choking. There is nothing more to say.
And the mask falls away before Tony’s eyes, revealing something desperate and blazing, ruinous. Steve looks at him like a dying man who’s sighted salvation - like he wove the sky and the stars. It’s worse than frightening, really - but some traitorous part of him is exhilarated as well, to be on the end of such a look.
Steve is pressing into him with a ferocity that borders on violence, all tongue and teeth and groping hands. Tony is frankly lost in it, when Steve pulls away just as abruptly, his fingers digging into Tony waist with bruising force.
Steve jumps at the sound of Fury’s irate voice reverberating around them, his focus snapping to the intercom above their heads.
Finally, Steve speaks. “As I said: I don’t expect you to adjust, right away. You need time, and I’m willing to give it to you.”
How awful it had been, the realization that Steve will always make that choice - that James Buchanan Barnes is always going to come first, before the Avengers and duty and Tony.
“You don’t...know me?” Not-Steve asks. His voice is steady enough, if a little hoarse, but when Tony musters the will to meet his gaze again, it’s to see a frightening fragility shining bright in the familiar blue, like fraying thread.
He glances back in the direction of his workshop as Steve tugs him into the day. It’s blinding, and Tony gulps the salted air with silent greed, his head craning to the open sky, streaked orange and violet with the fading dawn. Below, the sea beats insolently against the rocks, its muted roar sending cold thrills down his spine.
Still.
“Alright.”
The finality in his voice is nothing short of frightening. Tony beats savagely
It’s clear in Natasha’s pallor, in the stiff line of her shoulders; in the way she walks towards them - not with the effortless grace of her usual slink, but a sort of stiff-footed wariness Steve has never seen from her before. Her eyes are sharp on Steve, and only Steve; even Clint doesn’t warrant a glance.
They aren’t on anything approaching good terms, but Tony saved his life. Maybe that counts for something. If he could relay what he witnessed to the others -
Clint barrels on, “What we really need to be focusing on is the fact he’s clearly lost it.”
rescue missions. No weaknesses for you to take advantage of.”
Steve, he remembers, his hands curling into fists. Panic tight in his throat, Tony forces himself to think through it and says,
-- belong to him. And anyway, this isn’t the time or the place for such thoughts.
Tony peers down, down, into the sea. How angrily it roils. The mansion looms at his back, monument to the past and all the deaths he’s died since then - and it is sandwiched between the two of them, sea and stone, that Tony understands.
This is wrong -
“You son of a bitch.” Tony’s advancing on him before he can really think about it, rage and terror -
Tony stares up at Evil Steve, appalled.
Tony refuses to flush beneath Steve’s dry stare. He’s a grown man, and he’ll be damned if he lets a
And it occurs to Steve, like a light flicking on in the darkness, that Natasha is wrong; he really,
he said, grinning back at her.
“She has arrived,” Okoye says.
He won’t go quietly, at least.
“Good,” he murmurs, with a wisp of a smile. Then he reaches for Sarah, whose attention has drifted at some point to the TV, where
It is not easier, he’s found. The old wisdom that time heals all wounds is but another lie for the ages, empty words meant more for comfort than anything. That day is half a year past, now, but the wound is still open and festering, still raw in his soul. Tony Stark sleeps soundly in the room upstairs, but Steve can still feel him in his arms, the phantom weight of his limp body.
As his vision blurs, and the pain bleeds from his heart in a wave of heady numbness, he wonders what it's like. To be loved by Steve Rogers above all else.
“...Something has changed,” Wanda tells them. “Something is wrong.”
“He tried to kidnap Steve and
“Let go of me,” he says, as Steve extends his arm. The air ripples where he points the stone, space twisting and tearing into what Tony realizes, with a clenching gut, is a portal. Within it swirls chaos, kaleidoscopic and terrible.
When it’s died down, the room is empty.
An ugly shade of a smile twists his lips. It’s a little too real for his liking.
Blue light pulses beneath the door. Steve watches it fade and glow, fade and glow. Then, as quietly as possible, he enters the room.
He stops, swallows. His eyes are feverishly bright. “Would you grant it, Steve?”
Actually no, that’s a lie - he can and he does - but he won’t blame Steve
“But that's not possible,” Tony argues, shaking his head. “There has to have been a surrogate of some sort.” And even then, it doesn’t explain the girl belonging to the both of them. Tony scratches the back of his neck, his mind whirring. “You're telling me you couldn't turn up any further information on the kid? You just - found her, and that was that?”
Steve’s eyebrows arch in an achingly familiar way. “No?”
Well, he thinks after a moment, sitting up. Call him arrogant, but that’s a leg up over most people.
“Wait!” Tony says desperately. He yelps as Steve grows impatient with his struggles, throwing him neatly over one shoulder. “
“Oh, you’ll regret that,” Tony hisses, and
So, it's been a while. Have no excuse, except that I'm a student and inspiration comes and goes. I've actually had this third chapter sitting on my drive for a while, and I wanted to make it longer, but I've put off updating long enough, I suppose.
“Good boy,” Steve says. His fingers stroke lightly at the exposed underside of Tony’s wrist, trailing along his veins.
The best lies contain truths, he muses, as Steve softens above him ever so slightly.
“Peace,” Tony echoes. His mouth is horribly dry. “What does that look like?”
It is a mockery
It’s imperative we don’t let...personal biases...cloud our judgement.”
Steve has an infinity stone.
make a fool of him.
“I’m sorry that you’re having bad dreams,” Steve says softly, his arm falling over her. “I would take them away, if I could. But this - ”
- watches him for a long minute. Tony sweats under his scrutiny. He must not give Steve a reason to believe Tony
“One minute, Commander,” a crony says, but Steve -  the
But Steve’s seizing his wrist and bending it backwards before Tony can fire the repulsor. He gasps as Steve
“Gone,” Natasha answers. That shadow deepens on her face, and Steve has the sudden, frantic thought that he doesn’t want to know after all, doesn’t want to hear the truth of whatever’s making her look at him like that -
with his heightened senses, the chaos erupting in the other room, but Steve’s mind has drawn a blank. He stares, spellbound, as Tony extends a lithe arm into the space between them, palm up.
And worse than that,
Steve nods curtly at his men, who obey his silent command and file into the portal without looking back.

Fury blinks at him. .
sits coolly. His mouth goes dry. “I wasn’t trained as an interrogator.”
“Thanks,” Tony mumbles. He didn’t think he was hungry, but the smell from the bag is awakening his apetite. When was the last time he had take out? He can’t remember, and is curious to see what Steve thinks is his favorite.
persistent enough to worm its way into Steve’s pounding skull.
. He freezes, trying to understand the chill shuddering through him, the familiar twist in his gut as Tony stares, his head tilting.
“Tony,” Steve calls, but Tony cannot look at him. If he does what is left of his composure will unspool; he will give in to the animalistic rage eating up his insides and attempt to claw Steve’s face to ribbons, to hell with the consequences.
His own mouth is opening under Steve’s before he can really think about it.
at the shield, his breath loud in his ears, his poor heart stumbling in his chest. On the verge of hyperventilating, he locks eyes with Ross, who is still kneeling on the floor, clutching his twisted arm. He shakes his head at Tony, his eyes dark through the blood falling into them.
Steve’s silence worsens the quickening staccato of Tony’s already-frail heart. He waits, and waits, and when Steve has said nothing for a full ten seconds Tony looks up to find a mask of stone in place of that earlier passion.
“Will you?” Steve murmurs, and Tony feels a sick lurch in his stomach as he leans down, until they’re nearly sharing breath. “How?”
“The impossible,” Steve answers, and if that doesn’t set off the alarms in Tony’s head. He tries edging subtly backwards as Steve goes on, “You and I - we’ve brought peace.”
He turns away from her, his jaw ticking. Stark’s twin is peering in their direction, and Steve
“Oh, Tony,” he murmurs, pulling him in the direction of the stairs. “I

he croaks. “It’s why --  “
He rests his chin atop her head, his eyes straying to where the electric blue phantom of his shield travels along the walls. The Heart burns at his back. “Not ever.”
Sarah clings to him a moment, her gaze dropping with distaste to the little plate Steve’s set aside for her, loaded with chicken and peas. Steve catches the look and says, his voice soft but firm, “I expect you to eat all of it.”
the Commander growls. It’s a threat and a promise all rolled into one ugly package,  and Tony understands, as Steve’s arm snakes around his waist, that he’s in deep shit. A too-loud voice within him screams that he call for back-up, for his friends - but Tony doesn’t have too many of those, anymore. Not enough to matter.
The soldier nods curtly. As he turns away, Steve snarls a hand in Tony’s already-mussed hair, and murmurs, “You hear that, sweetheart? You’re running out of time.”
She knows something. Something
“...It was bad,” Natasha answers, after too long, and Steve bites down savagely on the name he wants to utter. He lets the blood fill his mouth, its familiar copper taste grounding him, somehow.

“Yes,” Steve affirms, his gaze still fixed to the horizon. “The stone.”
He’s just dared to feel something like relief when Steve straightens, his head cocked toward the ceiling. Soldiers will be crashing through it any second, Tony knows.
“Magic?” he croaks, at the same instant the handcuffs dissolve.
A ragged breath escapes the other man.
he knew the whole time. Remembers the set of his jaw as his arm tightened around Bucky Barnes, and the shield slipped from his fingers.
Tony eyes the blood gleaming wetly at the bottom, and is tempted to retreat.
“Tick-tock,” he murmurs, in a low voice that makes Tony’s stomach curl. Distantly, he registers the goons shifting around them, but he doesn’t dare look away from Evil Steve for long enough to see what they’re doing.
“What I needed to,” Steve says simply. He sweeps his thumb over the stone, and Tony recoils when it flares to life. Its power washes over him in near-overwhelming waves, leaves Tony white and trembling.
(So, batshit insane.)

making? They were designs that should never have seen the light of day, which means two things: either Steve wrested secrets from Tony’s counterpart, somehow, or his counterpart gave them willingly.
“Natasha,” Steve says smoothly, his own shoulders setting. A queer tension clouds the air between them, nipping at Steve’s gut. He understands, as T’Challa rounds the table to stand beside Natasha, that he will not like what news she brings.
It is the fourth day of his captivity. Tony is bored out of his mind.

he thinks wildly, while
Tony, and took him anyway. He means to keep Tony, here. Forever.
“Stark,” he gasps, at the same instant the man towering over him turns, breathing, “Ah. There you are.”
With this in mind, he sits, and he waits, and he plots.
He looks away, his huge hand tightening around Mjolnir, like he’s thinking about hurling it at something.
Tony rounds on him. “You
how smoothly his expression can shift between killing machine and exasperated tenderness.
The wind is knocked back out of him, and Steve has to tear from the bed before it overtakes him again, the hole in his chest. He stands there, lost and shaking and alone, black creeping into the edges of his vision and pain blooming bright where his nails gouge the flesh of his palms, until his throat closes and the room blurs around him, smearing away,
Unsettled --
he thinks, with a wave of exhaustion.
this Steve came from is unfurling in his head, and it leaves Tony breathless, frozen.
“Here, Daddy,” she says, holding out the bag almost shyly. “We got you dinner.”
That he has to ask the question drives in how fucked this whole thing is. Tony whips away, tearing at his hair. He is caught between the fire blackening his chest cavity and the cold air in his skull. Ice picks hammer at the backs of his eyes.
“Look,” he murmurs, and it is the voice of a lover, his gaze so tender it makes Tony’s nails dig into his palms as Steve gestures at the horizon. “What do you see?”
“...I spoke to General Ross,” she says, and the anger becomes fury. As the rest of them gape at her, Steve advances, his hands balled at his sides. “Without consulting me,” he says.
“Whatever the reason,” he says finally. “I think we can all agree we have a very volatile situation on our hands. Someone with Stark’s face and fingerprints has the potential to
Showtime, Tony thinks. He makes his eyes limpid, his throat bob, his face tight. He has to be convincing. Everything hinges on it.  “I just…”
Wet fingers close around his chin, like Evil Steve can sense his thoughts, and Tony inhales the sickly scent of copper as the other man asks, “Do you know who I am?”
Let Steve think himself the puppetmaster, and Tony all bound in his strings. It’ll make this easier, in the end. With that in mind, Tony tears his eyes away from Steve’s and stares blindly at the TV, his hand still buried in Sarah’s soft locks.
for several hours, now, and they have yet to get anything from him that isn’t a cool stare.
of her, of all that she means.
Steve shudders violently, his breaths loud and wet in the dark. It is a long time before he is able to roll onto his side - a long time before his heart calms and his mind clears and he feels almost able to breathe.
The fool will seethe and plot and fight - and as frustrating as it is, Steve can only love him for it. His brow droops to rest against the wood. Time. They just need time.
She looks up at him at last, her eyes still leaking. “Dangerous?”
All his failsafes, his codes, his secret compartments  - it’s all gone. Wiped away as though they never existed, at all. Tony pauses to consider the possibility that such securities don’t in fact exist here, but it’s just too bizarre. If his dead counterpart was one iota Tony Stark, he’d have installed these things.
and it’s never been clearer than now.
“Come with me,” he says, as if Tony has a choice, and leads him towards the door. They step at last from the bedroom into what Tony recognizes for sure as the rest of his Malibu estate, soft with morning. His chest tightens with a strange tequila of nostalgia and unease as Steve herds him through this home long lost to him, now whole and airy and pristine. His memories haven’t done it justice, really, Tony thinks, as Steve leads him down the winding stairs, past the rows of glass windows and the great bar taking up one corner of this particular level.
It’s madness, Tony thinks, where he’s sat in a heap on the floor.
But he tries. “You can't kill him.”
“Well. Let’s say I never got that chance.”
Then he's pulling a pistol of cataclysmic beauty from his holster, and Tony is frozen, because that gun is his design, he would know his own work anywhere, and Steve
No, no, his brain corrects, even as his hand falls, along with his jaw.
goddamnit - !”
..is foreign to him.
Steve’s shoulders set. He turns back to Tony, his jaw clenched. “Nothing that wasn’t worth it.”
Tony thinks he could actually cry with relief. He remains mute as Steve pulls back to look at him, asking, “Will you be alright while I’m gone?”
The thought stings, but it’s really the only reason he can think of. He and Tony had only just become something like friends before his death; if something twisted in Steve’s gut whenever he saw him, well. That’s no one's business but his.
“I don’t know yet,” Tony admits. He dares not break Steve’s gaze, and every instinct he possesses screams at him to shut up now,
-  just as two pairs of combat boots trot by.
“The Avengers?” Evil Steve’s drawl cuts into his thoughts. Those lips curl in an odd little smile that Tony does not like at all. “Don’t worry. We won’t be here long enough for them to be a problem.”
Before Tony can answer, Steve is there. He sets the tray gently on the bed, eyes locking briefly with Tony’s before he turns to Sarah. “Let’s get settled here first, sweetheart.”
As it is, Steve had snapped awake at Clint’s startled cry, managing to yank the needle out before too much of the drug (an extraordinarily strong sedative, the lab technicians informed them) entered his bloodstream. The serum has filtered most of it out by now, and he wants to blame his current unsteadiness on some lingering traces of it. But Steve isn’t in the habit of lying to himself.
For a moment, Steve only looks at him. Then a smile, small and knife-like, cuts across his face. He says, “Well, that would be a problem, wouldn’t it?”
Of its own volition, his head tips forward. Their foreheads touch, his world narrowing to blue, blue, blue.
With a shout of frustration, Thor brings the hammer down on the table, causing Bruce and Clint to wince as they step through the door, followed by a stony-faced Natasha and a thunderous-looking Fury. Several armed agents loom behind them.

Fury folds his arms behind his back. “As of right now,
He caresses Tony’s face for another few seconds, then stands.
“I can,” Steve corrects, watching Tony with a cold amusement that is equally unsettling. “...But I'm willing to hear you out.”
Evil Steve glances down at him, and it's
Bruce’s protest is waved away.
A whole block was destroyed in the effort to subdue him.
The Heart, as Tony called it, sits on Sarah’s nightstand, now. It is a shimmering titanium globe sat on a base of twisting gears, all encased in glass. The globe in particular is a stunning example of Tony’s inherent artistry; intricately marked with the various projected shapes, its shifting metal sheets are almost hypnotic to the eye. That electric blue light throbs from the mini arc reactor installed within the globe. It will never die.
He must not show weakness, now; not with Steve watching him so closely, pale eyes bright with the burgeoning day.
Steve’s eyes flash. For a moment Tony thinks he’s made a mistake, but then Steve covers Tony’s hand with his, pressing it tightly to his heart.
The room holds nothing of use.
He pushes off the windowsill and paces away from Steve’s suffocating presence as casually as possible, his tone light. “Murder?” he goes on. “Torture? World domination? I’m all ears - “
He wakes up gasping, sweat beading his skin even as his insides burn cold.
Tony shivers. Repulsion churns within him as Steve continues, “So long as you remember that, the rest will solve itself.”
“Uh,” Tony barely gets out, before they’re swarming him, grim-faced goons brandishing
“Remember what you said,” he whispers. “About redemption.”
for two hours - it seems to be a marathon - when he hears the telltale sound of the door unlocking. He jerks into an upright position, his heart thundering as the doors open. Steve fills the doorway, a huge tray of steaming dishes balanced in one hand while he holds the way open for Sarah. She comes in carrying a brown paper bag, dressed in overalls and a blue T-shirt. Her eyes light immediately on Tony, who sits transfixed beneath them.
Tony’s brain whirs while he speaks, what feels like electricity searing in his veins as he meets Steve’s wary eyes. “Sarah. I wouldn’t mind seeing her again.”
“We can’t just
Tony’s eyes close briefly. Something unreadable warps his features. When he opens them again, the pain is naked in his gaze.
Yes, Tony is afraid. Because it’s up to him now, to correct whatever went so wrong, here. He must get that stone, whatever the cost.
Steve walks him to the very edge of the strip, where Tony once landed with flash and pomp and purpose, in days long past. It hasn’t even been a decade since then, but for him it feels like a lifetime ago. The Tony Stark who walked this place - who built Iron Man here, in its bowels - was a different creature, as much a ghost now as this house. He drowned with it, in these waters.
“We’ve wasted enough time,” Steve tells him, like he knows Tony’s thoughts. He snatches up the shield in one swift motion, and secures it at his back. “C’mon.”
There was Ross, he remembers suddenly. Ross saw them.
“I've missed you,” he breathes. The words are meant for him alone, and as he shivers Tony notices that the goons have carefully positioned themselves to appear as though they're scanning the rest of the room, backs to he and Steve.
Then he’d whispered,
“You should kill me now,” Tony says, feather-soft.
When Evil Steve tilts his head in answer, the man rumbles, “The military is en route.”
again, low but piercing in the pause:
His hand spasms under Steve’s.
“It’s well past your bedtime, young lady,” he’s saying, as he pulls at the blanket. Then he stops. Beneath the blanket, Sarah is kneeling on the bed, hunched over, frozen. Her eyes, so like his, bulge almost comically, and the blue crayon snaps in her grasp as Steve’s gaze drops to the sketchbook he bought her, weeks ago.
He wonders, taking a careful step back.
Natasha claims the chair, her pale hands folding neatly atop the table. Those brilliant eyes are locked on Steve once more. “It means,” she says, “that what we can tell - and what actually happened - are two very different things.”
Those familiar
Then Tony can snag the Stone. It’s his only way back.
Tony seriously considers taking down at least a couple before they spot him, but that wouldn’t end well -  and anyway, not-Steve said
he snarls. Blood roars in his ears, boils his veins.
fitted head to toe in heavy combat gear, zip by, cradling guns of a sleek, deadly-looking model that leaves his eyes bulging after them.
Fury is muttering next to him, but the words may as well be gibberish, for all he understands them.
Steeling himself, Tony turns to Plan B.
Tony, tries to wrench Evil Steve’s arm toward him, but he might as well be wrestling with stone. The other man doesn't budge an inch.
He is not supposed to be here. The knowledge strikes him like a slap, slicks like tar against his bones. Tony holds tight to Steve’s hand, makes himself breathe in, breathe out.
. “But I’ll figure something out,” he says anyway. “Give me time.”
“Enter,” T’Challa calls, and the doors to the conference room promptly open, revealing the stern-faced general of the Dora Milaje.
What comes out is: “What do you mean?”
What seems an eternity later of this, Steve says in his ear, “I have to go now, sweetheart.”
Something smart springs to Tony’s lips, but that glint in Evil Steve’s eyes warns him of the weight his next words hold. Self-preservation winning out, Tony gets out, “Steve.”
he thinks, fighting the impulse to tear his own eyes away.
Then he hears it - a deep,
, she keeps trying to say, through the snot and tears. And she should be. The longer Steve takes in the picture, the harder it becomes to stomp down on the vicious surge of black searing within him. He breathes in deeply. Counts to ten. Watches Sarah go on, his gaze cold enough to freeze rain.
The door is hardly closed before Tony back is pressed against it, Steve has him pinned by the shoulders, and  Tony stands frozen beneath his bright stare, the last dregs of his fury draining away to fright. His heart thunders in his ears as Steve says, low and loving, “You can seethe and curse and scheme in here for as long as you need to, Tony. It won’t change a thing.”
Tony’s voice is in his head; Tony’s hands are on his skin; Tony’s breath is in his ear, caught with ecstasy, then death. The world around him and above him and beneath him is but negative space, defined by Tony Stark and all his shades; where he is and was and isn’t, where he will be.
“It doesn’t make any sense.”
It’s the one thing dividing this whole predicament from
p.p.s. i can't remember and am too lazy to check if I originally used Stevil or if a commenter came up with the name. if it's the latter, thank you. it's amazing.
Steve stands there for an immeasurable length of it, aching. It is only the cutting knowledge of Tony’s rejection, should he act on his desire, that pulls him away from the door.
To do otherwise is unthinkable.
“Go?” Tony echoes stupidly. “Go where?”
And then, because he's the universe's favorite chew toy, shit hits the fan the very next morning; Tony is in Washington, trading thinly-veiled insults with Secretary Ross and his Council of Asshats, when a sound like thunder clapping rends his eardrums, and the hall explodes.
His mouth clicks shut. He glares down at the cuffs binding him securely to the table, his lips pursing, and then it’s Steve’s turn to bore holes in his face. Adrenaline is rushing through him; he’s not sure why.
“It cost us a great deal, procuring it,” Steve informs him, while Tony weighs the potential success of shoving him into the sea. “But once it was in our possession, well...let’s say it put us on a much faster track to achieving our goals.”
It’s the right thing to say: Sarah’s nervousness is replaced with blinding happiness, a checkered grin splitting her cherubic face.  “You’re welcome, Daddy!” she chirps, practically bouncing in place. As Steve closes the door behind him and Tony sets the bag aside, Sarah stands on her tip-toes and stretches her arms towards him, her tiny hands opening and closing.
He’s in such deep shit.
His eyes dart about wildly as he gets to his knees.
But Steve only holds him tighter, his arm lengthening around Tony until he’s pinned to that bloody star, cursing up a storm.
orange chicken.
“I understand,” he whispers. And, channeling the love he holds for Steve Rogers, Captain America, Tony squeezes the Commander’s hand. The change is as abrupt as it is disconcerting; Steve’s face floods with an unbearable warmth, his free hand rising to cup the back of Tony’s neck. He brings Tony closer, and for a heart-stopping instant Tony thinks Steve means to kiss him -- but all he does is rest their foreheads together.
“You said - you said she was ours. And in my world…”
“You really won't tell me where she came from?” he asks, setting his fork down. He doesn't feel the need to clarify who he's talking about.
He closes his eyes.
Tony is amazed at the easy concession. He swallows hard as Steve’s thumb sweeps tenderly across the back of his hand. He is looking at Tony with open worship, and Tony sweats under the attention, so deeply at odds with what he knows of the man before him.
The moment is ruined, however, when he looks up to find Steve watching the both of them. His expression is strange. Those lips are pulled into a little half-smile that Tony doesn’t like, for the glittering of those ice-chip eyes.
He forces himself to breathe. Counts to ten. It only barely helps; panic alights Steve’s skin, sparks electric in his skull, and whatever he does he can’t seem to fully quell it. It has chased him since he first flicked on the TV and saw the screaming banners of text - since that name rang in his ears and chest, and closed his throat.
The tower erupted into chaos soon after. Iron Man was always formidable, but this imposter was ruthless -
But he doesn’t deny it, and the rage becomes volcanic, blinding.
It’s not enough, not nearly enough. But it’s
And he starts towards the portal, dragging Tony along with him.
Steve advances further, that ringing yet to fade within his ears. He wants to lie down, to seize his shield and hurl it into the nearest wall. Instead he looms over her, his jaw set hard, and demands, “What happened, Natasha?”
Tony stares at the wall over Steve’s shoulder. Steve’s voice winds in his head; Steve’s hands burn on his skin: Steve’s breath is in his ear, noxious words corroding something in his depths. Tony tries to breathe but his lungs won’t open. Something’s caught in his chest. The world is
His eyes snap to the window, where
When Sarah subsists, the barest pout on her face, Steve turns to him. “I got your favorite,” he says, nodding at the bag. “But if you’re not in the mood for take-out, there’s soup, chicken, and vegetables here.”
his fucking tech -  is just a bonus, really.
This is worse than the Twilight Zone. Clearly Tony has fallen back into the sordid past times of his youth, and is having a trip of epic proportions.
They stay like that for a minute, Steve basking in his presence and Tony fervently wishing he would disintegrate, until Steve pulls away.
Yeah, this went in an entirely different direction than I first envisioned. There were no little girls, for one. I don't even know where she came from. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed, and thanks for reading!
above and around and within him, hissing all the things Tony’s told himself, and it’s too much,
In the brief time they knew each other, Steve had memorized every line of Tony’s face: the set to his mouth when he was indignant; the way his brow pinched when he was concentrating; how his eyes grew hooded when he was feeling particularly ruthless.
The glow warming his features is nothing short of delight, and its with an equal amount of confusion and disgust that Tony tears away from him - or attempts to. Steve won’t let go of his shoulders. He clicks his tongue and draws Tony in close again, his grip near-bruising as he begins to steer him back into the mansion.
“Why are you here, Nat?” Clint demands to Steve’s right. “What’s happened?”
Tony learned long ago that there are things worse than death. He thinks now that he could meet them, at Steve’s hands.
There is a collective wince from the rest of the Avengers (save Natasha); it’s the first time Tony’s name has been spoken aloud since the memorial.
Steve can’t help the gulp that works his throat as the steel door slides shut behind him.
Damn it. He needs
Tony thinks, but will not say.
Her dark eyes flick about the room, plainly unimpressed, before settling on the king.
” Clint seethes, gesturing sharply at his bandaged shoulder, where the suspect’s repulsor blast nearly vaporized him. The Tony look-alike was dressed in normal -- if pricey -- clothes when Steve awoke, but the band around his wrist was able to summon the Iron Man suit from something called “nanobytes,” as he’d overheard.
His eye flicks to Steve. Steve doesn’t like the look.
Tony swallows another unwise retort, and obeys.
He snorts to himself, his eyes pinned blankly to the TV screen. Him, a father. It’s beyond bizarre to think that, while he was busy making mistake after mistake in his own reality, in another world another Tony Stark cradled his daughter. A little girl with his nose and Steve’s eyes, whose bright blonde hair smells of bubblegum.
“You,” she says, soft as a feather. “That’s who Ross is saying he saw.”
Then, slowly, slowly, Tony lets his hand rise. Sarah starts as he touches her hair, her face lifting to his. They stare at each other for a suspended beat - and then Sarah relaxes back into him, her cheek pressed to his heart. Her hair is silken gold between his fingers, and something nameless sparks in Tony’s chest as he relaxes, too.
Tony thinks fiercely, his eyes glued to the golden fall of Sarah’s hair. They might share a voice, and a face, and a name, but what makes up a person goes well beyond these things, as Tony has learned - is learning. He’s never really had to think about it.
She picks at her pajama bottoms, shakes her head. “I don’t know…”
(He has been here before.)
Steve’s jaw works for a few tense seconds. “He died a hero. And you disrespect his memory by sitting here - “
“You seem to be his favorite, captain.”
But when he tries to say as much, Fury’s face only twists with impatience.
Tony listens past the words for all the things Steve isn’t saying. “The stone.”
know you. More than anyone.”
- warring for dominance within him as he gets in Steve’s face.
But Sarah is five, max, and Steve is Steve. And this, Tony thinks, returning Steve’s gaze, is the first of many tests.
“...We don’t like it anymore than you do.”
“I’m sorry, Papa,” Sarah weeps, when it’s done. She shuffles back to him, red-faced, and Steve is glad to envelop her in his arms. “I won’t do it again,” Sarah sobs into his chest. “I promise. Please don’t let him go.”
know they’ve already got suspects in custody, and then we’re risking our lives sneaking back to the other side of the world for nothing.”
It was one of the blueprints he scrapped after returning from Afghanistan, when he shut down the weapons sect of SI altogether. Before he destroyed them, they were locked up tight in a vault accessible only through his fingerprints and retinal scans. Not even Obie could have got at them.
Perhaps his counterpart made himself sick on some other dish in those days, Tony muses. Whatever the reason - Steve is
“Is it,” Steve says.
To anyone still reading, thank you! Hope it was alright.
“Tony.”
Sarah says. The word is shrill, hysteric. She snatches the picture from Steve’s grip, scuttles off the bed, and begins to tear at it, her chest heaving while she rips the paper into tiny little pieces. Steve watches her do it, satisfaction swelling in his chest as the pieces flutter to the ground.
“I mean,” he says, “it’s time to go.”
“Come home,” Tony says. And, for reasons, he can’t even explain to himself, Steve takes his hand, marvelling at how
Sarah pauses for only a moment before moving stiffly into his side, her head ducked low.
The preservation of his work and its secrets are of paramount importance to Tony: in any world, he’d think. But then - didn’t those soldiers carry guns of
“You don’t belong here, Steve,” he says softly. The symbols are blazing against his skin, now. “Let me set things right.”
He picks his way across several bodies, his fury mounting at the sight of each victim, before the smoke clears enough that he can see them, the mob of soldiers near the exit.
“Dangerous,” Steve whispers. “If Tony saw this, how do you think he would feel?”
Her expression reminds Tony of a puppy who’s been told to sit, eager and hopeful and adoring, only barely restrained. There’s nervousness there too, however. Tony wonders which of them put it there. He very carefully does not look at Steve as he accepts the bag. A familiar aroma drifts from it; take-out. Stretching dry lips into what he hopes is the semblance of a smile, Tony murmurs, “Thank you, sweetheart.”
The arc reactor sits at the bottom of his world’s Pacific, but Tony can still feel it plugging his chest. Palladium constricts his pounding heart, sends fire through his veins. His wills his hands to shaking fists, ignores the bite as Steve goes on, “Whether it’s of old age -- here, with me --  or of other, less fortunate circumstances is up to you, and no one else.”
Not-Steve - or maybe Evil Steve, that sounds more accurate - sees the movement and tenses, gesturing sharply at his men.
His hand gravitates again to Tony’s face, like he can’t help himself. “She’s been right here, waiting for you.”
Tony watches them all disappear, his head spinning.
“I’ve waited long enough,” Steve says roughly. “You’re coming home.”
Tony wants to disintegrate him so badly he shakes with the wish, but before he can hammer more nails into his own coffin Steve says, “You clearly need more time to digest your situation. It’s… frustrating, but I suppose it’s my fault for expecting anything less from you. You’re so stubborn.”
shouldn’t.
pinning him to his side in a cold embrace before flying out into the night, with the other Avengers in hot pursuit.
But Thor has yet to calm. Electricity crackles along his tanned skin, and the others give him a wide berth as he storms around the room, his face twisted with startling rage.
Sarah’s look of betrayal all but confirms Tony’s suspicion of him having been the doting parent. His chest actually tightens at her expression, but defying the Commander isn’t worth the girl’s favor, right now. They’re playing a game, he and Steve. Tony doesn’t intend to lose.
Steve - Evil Steve - smells like blood. He can feel Steve inhaling the scent of his hair, a ragged breath leaving his powerful body. The pseudo-shield clatters to the floor; muscled arms wind tight around him, like twin cobras, and Tony can only accept that he’s stumbled into the twilight zone as Steve crushes him to his body, like he can force them into one being.
The look on T’Challa’s face tells Steve that the king already knows, whatever it is, and he has to stomp down a swell of anger as Natasha swallows, and says, “You know about the Washington attack.”
Then, at last, he’s gone. Tony listens to the locks slide into place, the brief hum of the access pad set in the wall outside. Then he sags forward, arms still folded to his chest, heart pounding so hard his body vibrates with it. Were Steve to poke his head in again -- or check the cameras Tony knows he’s embedded in the walls -- he would see a man bowed in defeat.
His jaw setting, Steve goes to the bed, stepping over strewn stuffed animals and dolls.
F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s voice doesn’t intone her approval. Tony wonders again what’s happened to her; to his
he can’t see him, but those dark eyes are settled on his own as though
The unit parts, like a sea of tar. Tony’s eyes first light on Ross, kneeling at the center with a bloody face and a twisted arm, a gun pointed at his lolling head.
He stomps down the pulse of pain as it arises, and forces his attention back to the problem at hand. Namely: how to incapacitate this version of Captain America, without being killed, himself.
So no evidence and no answers, Tony thinks, with a spike of irritation. Convenient.
Sam huffs out a breath. “You don’t know
Up close, the difference is at once glaring and muted; it’s definitely Steve’s face, Steve’s mouth, Steve’s eyes. But there are dark circles beneath those familiar hues, and a feverish glint within them that again leaves Tony deeply uncomfortable.
-- stares at him, his too-long hair shadowing his gaze. He looks -- worn. Impossibly weary.
(See the end of the chapter for
His voice is strained, soft with a grief Tony can’t fathom. There’s a warning in there, too. Tony is trying to decide if he should heed it or not (this Steve wouldn’t seriously hurt him, he’s starting to think), when the wail of sirens fills his ears, along with the roar of what he recognizes as approaching jets.
“The world,” Steve echoes, with passion. He turns Tony until they’re facing each other, takes both of his shoulders. “It’s ours, Tony,” Steve says. “All of it.”
Debris is strewn around him, the room obscured by thick black smoke that scalds his lungs. All he sees are flashes of fleeing civilians, and in the haze of his thoughts he wonders if Zemo somehow got loose, again.
Steve’s brain screeches to a halt. He stares dumbly at Fury, his mouth opening, closing. The man can’t mean what he thinks he means.
“You know me,” he murmurs, low and intent. “And I know you.”
Sure there might be some search effort - but when they find nothing? They’ll chalk him off as another of the dead, for sure. No one will guess at the truth. Even Tony is having a hard time digesting the situation, and he’s living it.
Steve Rogers stares through the two-way mirror, his jaw clenched so tightly it aches.
He paws through the bag’s contents under Steve’s close attention. Inside is a box of white rice, some egg rolls, and a container of orange chicken. Tony pulls it out, his eyes wide. Burgeoning laughter tightens his throat, and its an effort to restrain it.
He felt so small, in that moment. Like a stupid child.
“Tony,” he murmurs, low and fervent, a lost man’s prayer. His face descends, and Tony watches, dazed, as those eyes flutter closed and that soft mouth parts --
The night before the end finds him lying in bed, a drink in his hand while he contemplates the mess that has become his life in the months following his and Steve’s...
There is a band around his right wrist. His eyes never leaving Steve’s, Tony unclasps the metal.
“Love,” he says, barely audible. “What else?”
Steve looks away almost involuntarily. Something is pulsing in his throat. His hands are gross with sweat, and he doesn’t know why.
your little expedition was.”
The ground is trembling beneath them, and the roar has become deafening. Back-up will rush the building any minute. If he can just stall for long enough…
Clarity is brutal, cold.
His heart leaps to his throat as the man gasps his ignorance. It sounds like Ross. There’s a beat of silence, and then a horrible crack carries through the room. The man screams, high and awfully, and Tony is rushing towards the sound without a thought.
and Tony thinks, through the cloud of shock, that he’d like nothing more than to knock out every one of Steve’s pearly white teeth, then and there.
Tony swallows hard. The closeness, the staring, the tender scrape of Steve’s fingers against his scalp - it’s distracting him, and Tony can’t afford that now. He reminds himself that the man before him isn’t
“Two minutes, maybe three.”
“It’s time to go,” Steve repeats, ignoring him. And Tony understands, with a sinking heart, exactly what he means by that. He gapes up at the other man, mouth open in a no doubt stellar imitation of a fish.
I didn't originally plan to continue this, feeling pretty meh about it overall, but y'all inspired me to go on with it, so here we are. I feel a little 'blah' about this chapter also, tbh,  but I wanted to go ahead and get it out to you guys. Thanks so much for reading, and I hope you like!
