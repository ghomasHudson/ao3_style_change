What if Tony was born with two soulmates because Steve was supposed to die as a child and so Tony wouldn't be left alone.
“What?” You ask, sitting forward in the hospital bed. “But Gamora died.”
Killian and Killian needs Tony.
Never did she think that gravity would be what finally won.
“As it usually does when drinking to excess.” Steve reaches out to touch Tony before stopping himself suddenly as if thinking better of it and pulls it away instead. “You didn't hit your head did you?”
“Fire!” Steve yells, and a split second later there are three large pops in quick succession. Tony turns eyes wide, the oil made it to the soldering iron and boom. Fire spread out on his desk large sparks and mini-explosions going off. Tony’s got too many accelerants and fire hazards in his apartment. It’s spreading too fast. There’s another spark, and a few pieces of metal fly off in Tony’s direction, and next thing he knows is a heavy force on his shoulders knocking him down out of the way.
“Maybe.” Tony nodded. “I mean scared is what I do these days. I took one look at Bucky and bolted, so don't think you're extra special.”
“And? We’ve met and we still don’t know each other really.”
You were unconscious and the boy was trying to hide behind you as much as physically possible with you lying unmoving flat on the ground. Steve moved for you instantly, reaching for your arm, thoughts immediately on stopping the bleeding.
“Hospital food?” Tony wrinkled his nose.
She barely suppressed a sigh as she reached for the phone.
Tony was alone. Truly for the first time he felt emptiness. Before this, he would have sworn he felt it. He would have been wrong. He didn’t even notice how or when Nebula left, but it seemed she found something better to do than sticking behind. Stuck, stranded, alone on Titans desolate surface, he heard nothing but silence and the whistling of the wind. But in his head, he replayed those last moments. Peter crying in his arms.
“What trick is this?” Thanos asks, finally giving Thor the threat assessment he deserves. A mirage of Loki appears beside him.
He remembers how Jarvis would sit in the basement with him for hours while he worked on projects. He’d stand off to the side, sometimes passing Tony tools. Talking to Jarvis about his wife and family. Jarvis' voice was always there, explaining, asking questions, giving praise. His voice was calming, and its why Tony chose Jarvis’ voice for the AI. By god, it was a great decision. He couldn’t imagine anyone else’s voice calming him now like this.
“Tired.” Tony shrugs. “The wrist hurts, but he’s going to get me something for it.”
Stephen starts.
“Sorry. I uh- we can pay.” Bucky says quickly when he sees Steve out of the corner of his eye drop his head down in shame.
You repeat the words, giving jazz hands because this is starting to all sound like a bad plot to a movie. You’re getting tired of not having the answers.
That’s why he was happy to be the grandmasters champion. People roared the Hulks name. They had flags, posters, and face paint. They threw parades.
You gasp awake, in a hospital bed, the beeping around you rapidly increases as some of the cords get ripped from the sockets due to your movements. The sound irritates your sensitive ears and growing headache until it’s swiftly shut off by someone next to you.
“It’s alright. I’m sure you meet a lot of people, and we only met the once.” He leans against the counter. “We met at the charity gala, for the pediatric wing of this hospital.”
” Steepen added.
“That sounds like so long.”
Bucky: Sorry about that.
“Thirty-nine hours ago, Sir.”
“Is it your heart?” Steve asks, a twinge of concern.
Tony jolts awake an hour later and Jarvis informs him it was exactly an hour and thirteen minutes. At this point every minute counts towards a better day for Tony’s state of mind. He wipes his eyes and gets out of bed and dresses. He knows he’s not going to get any more sleep at this point. He rarely ever sleeps more than three hours a day. And that's if he sleeps.
Natasha’s cocking the gun before he finishes his sentence, and he tries not to take it personally. She takes a deep breath and aims it at his forehead. “Here goes nothing.” Then she pulls the trigger.
Bucky: I think I might have a different rulebook
Steve bent by the bed and gently pulled the bandages off. They were very bloody. He’d done his best to clean you up, but the sheet and your shirt were covered in blood. The smell of iron was strong.
“I can’t explain it really Pepper, okay? I just… I’m in a good place and I don’t want to leave, not yet, I’m not ready yet.” Tony’s not exactly sure he will ever be.
“Want me to spot you?” The man asks, gesturing to the bench press. Tony shakes his head, stopping himself from letting out a cheap laugh. As if he would even entertain the idea of doing the bench-press in his state, he’d only drop it back on himself and probably die. At least for anything over twenty pounds. And even that Tony’s not sure of. He hasn’t tested his strength any more than needed to hold his work while making new designs all day.
He hangs up, and Tony’s nearly asleep relaxed back on the couch, injured wrist resting on his chest.
“I am.”
He knows why. It's the anticipation and anxiety. It's the nightmares. The nightmares are the worst. Always reliving that night over and over again.
He worried if Tony would just answer and tell him to shove off. Or maybe the chance Tony wouldn’t answer and the phone would be out of service. Steve just thought Tony needed more time. It was pretty bad. Rhody losing most of the function in his legs, Tony having to go to physical therapy himself after Steve jammed his shield into Tony’s chest.
“A-are you talking to me?” You ask, stepping forward.
“Yeah.” He nods meekly.
“It’s a temporary fix until we get someone else to watch him. Listen, I’m on child duty, you’re on the ghost whisperer. Go make sure Y/n’s still breathing.”
Bucky shrugs. “I dunno. Maybe it was the shock. That happens sometimes right? You get nervous and don’t know what to do?”
“Yeah. By the bar we all used to hang out at.”
“Deal.” Steve smiles and lies back in the bed.
Steve then realizes the wariness in Tony’s eyes has nothing to do with his injuries and the crash.
When Steve sets him down on the bed, lifting the blanket and setting it over Tony whispering a goodnight, and when he turns to leave, Tony reaches out grabbing his arm and quietly, like a secret, he asks Steve to stay. That's the last things he remembers before he drifts off into sleep.
It’s better than a ‘we have to go’ Tony supposes, so he’ll take what he can get. He and Bucky stood and they said their goodbyes, repeating with quick shy hugs.
“You’re asking the wrong guy.” Bucky shrugs. “I’m just grasping at straws. I don’t know how any of this works. But come on. It’s a new bond, we barely know each other. You have to give it time. I doubt texting him a little bit yesterday would have given me that much more of a connection to him than you. If it did then you know what you need to do to get more connected. You have his number text him.”
He waited until he heard Steve get in the shower before he dares to do anything about it.
” Stephens voices come through, you turn your head and answer him.
“I’ll be fine. If we miraculously get into a fight or have to do something more physically straining than walking, I’ll let you handle it by yourself.”
“Alright, sir. Would you like anything else?”
“That could be a couple of things. Let’s look inside and see what we got.” When Tony reaches for the arm Bucky flinches, just a little bit, small enough that Tony might have missed it if he blinked. He backtracks. “Are you okay?”
He doesn’t answer, as you watch, the forcefield fully breaks, and Thanos and the Hulk are fighting. Punches were thrown, body slams. Everyone around steps back, trying not to become collateral damage or accidentally hit Hulk in the process of bad aiming.
“It’s not as bad as it sounds. I could probably follow a few more safety rules but where’s the fun in that?”
Tony sits on the floor and just stares at the door. He’s too tired to move, too tired to even go over and lock the door, thank god Jarvis can do that for him.
“Oh, I had it changed back once the Avengers broke up. You didn’t know that?”
He feels safe and warm.
He steps closer to Tony, taking his hands, in his and waiting patiently for Tony to finally look up and meet his eyes again.
He’s falling, sinking into the red bloodied snow.
So, none of you wanted to warm me writing fight scenes was hard? Rude.
“We share the same one.”
“No. That’s- that’s not possible Steve. They’re dead.” Tony shakes his head. That all sounds like a load of crazy mixed with denial. Tony isn’t sure what stage of grief he’s on. But at least he’s not pulling a sixth sense moment. Steve can see the disbelief written all over Tony’s face. Like he’s given up. Just like what everyone else did back in Wakanda. So ready to accept defeat.
“Yeah.” Bucky nods. “But I want to change that. I’ve seen enough soulmate matches to know how this works. We’re perfectly matched for each other. How could I not wait for that?”
“What makes you think that? Denial? Stubbornness? Maybe you think you lived so that you could win here? None of it matters. You are alive because of a balance. You will not best me, you didn’t before.”
“No.” He shakes his head. “Sorry.”
Tony: I’m not doing anything.
He’s not panicking, miraculously. It’s just, suddenly it feels like he’s got a lot of attention on him.
“What’s your name?” You ask aloud, looking down and not at the people around you.
“This conversation will get you the same place the argument over the counter got you. So drop it.”
“This is because of your Hulkness, or lack thereof?”
“Tony?” Steve’s voice comes through the door. It’s small and apologetic. “Are you okay? Is your arm-- is it okay?”
Bucky nods, wondering how hard it is to become an engineer because if it gets him an apartment this good, he will gladly do whatever it takes. But the question was more to get some information. He didn’t see a wedding band on Tony’s finger, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t in a relationship. When Tony didn’t respond he looked up to see that blank expression he’d had at the gym before. Just staring off into nothing.
He won’t ask them to stay, he can’t, he’s not ready for that, as much as he realizes he wants them around more. There’s a difference between wanting them to stay another hour or so and spending the night, which they may take it like that considering how late it is.
She hadn’t expected an answer, not verbally anyway. She’d gotten what she wanted. The things that flashed before your mind in a moment of searing pain, with fear clouding your mind just as much as your nerves were firing signals of pain straight to your brain. The thoughts the word sacrifice brought to your mind. She’d seen it using the power of the Mind Stone.
He forced his eyes open, and Bucky is just everywhere, migrated between his legs, standing over him completely, arms wrapped around him, and Tony feels trapped.
“I’ll tell you one day.” He promises. “Just not today.”
Tony: My bad, my lips are sealed.
“No.” You shake your head vehemently. “This is new for me. One-hundred percent.”
Every night he dreams he’s back in that car, reliving it all over again. Sometimes it changes, sometimes it gets worse.
“Yeah.” He nods. “I just wanted to see how it worked, and so on. But if something’s wrong I can totally check it out and see what I could do.”
You laugh, tears burning in your eyes. “It did work, right? Everyone got free?”
“No.” Tony shakes his head. “It shouldn’t at all. These panels up here should have no sensory receptors in the parts that detach, if you do feel something then that may be what’s wrong actually, but I doubt that.”
Tony takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, digging his face into his pillow. If he psyches himself out, he’s really not going to fall asleep. Then he’ll be right back where he started.
“No.” Loki corrects.
Steve finds himself worried about the person that wasn’t here, to begin with. Tony.
“Besides a thirty-minute rant on the broken stall in the locker room and how the entire gym has gone to shit in his absence? No not really.”
“Sympathetic fear?”
“Hi! I'm Peter. I talked to you once to tell Mr. Stark I was okay.”
It takes a moment, and you think it over before explaining it as best you can.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks, looking concerned.
“I see you’ve got the fire and everything cleaned up,” Steve says, finally bringing himself to relive some of the tension in the air. Tony looks over to the workstation, thinking back to the way it looked when Steve last saw it.
Then she’d call out to the one named, Y/n, making sure they were ready for what would be asked of them when the time came.
He clutches the injured arm gently to his chest, using his free hand to help himself upright and to the other side of the bed, away from Steve.
The doctors had to amputate it. But because of his age and circumstances, he qualified for a new prototype prosthetic a Stark Industries company had just developed.
“Yes, one message from Ms. Potts would you like me to play it aloud?”
“Jarvis pull up anything on prosthetics in the Stark files. Go as far back as possible. I want everything.”
Dr. Zola had said the jagged tears and exposed nerves made Bucky’s arm a perfect fit for connecting the wires to the nervous system, giving him full control over the metal arm they’d designed. Bucky still has it to this day.
There was a clearness in her mind and that’s when she realized what happened. She realized that she didn’t die for the Soul Stone, she died to become it. She had no physical form, even though she looked down at herself, and seemed to have the image of one. This was… nothing, something she used to hold onto what she once was. Now she was energy really, light, power, virtue, a soul, all held inside a single stone that now makes up her entire being.
“Yeah.” He says, not moving his hands from his face. Just block out the world and make himself feel safe. That should work.
You lower your hand reaching for the one a rack down.
“How long?” Tony crosses his arms. It doesn’t feel like him, to push like this, these aren’t his words, they aren’t his questions, voices that aren’t his own are making way out of his mouth. “Six months? Two years? Forever?”
You start walking down the sidewalk, cautiously.
“I meant better water pressure, and less slippery.”
He looks to the coffee table, candy wrappers, an empty bowl of popcorn, realization dawns, the night is over.
“Or he just likes the snickers. You think it’s all mental- but Natasha told me he’s basically just a little shit and likes to mess with people.”
Stephen scoffs, and you’re sure if you could see there might be some crude gestures going on
“So, your plan is that you don’t have a plan?” Natasha asks, arms crossed, eyebrows lifted.
“Him and that one famous guy.” Steve added. “Bruce was telling me about it. There's a celebrity with two bonds.”
“Like what? It gave him a backup in case you withered away?”
“Bring up the lights to one-hundred percent,” Tony ordered. The lights came up, but the ‘Yes, sir’ response never came. Tony already regretted muting Jarvis. But if he undid it, then he’d only go on about health and emotional trauma.
.oOo.
Enjoy! <3
"Tony, what are you doing?" Steve all but whined at the loss of proximity.
Tony grabbed his hand and held it there. He grinned. “Good to know that at least someone likes it. I let it grow because of other reasons than beauty care.” His eyes searched Steve's face for something, even though Steve wasn't sure what it was. When he opened his mouth again, his voice was quiet. “It's been some years, right? How about we celebrate this reunion with dinner? The suns are setting and you look like you need a break. I could- I mean we… I can tell you everything that happened, but not right now. Okay? Maybe after dinner?” He looked up to meet Steve's gaze, his voice had become small and yet hopeful. The unspoken question if Steve would stay was hanging in the air between them.
A smile crept on Tony’s face and he folded the letter back up to put it away once again. He hadn’t met his soon-to-be husband yet, but if his letters were any indication, then the alpha he was going to marry today was a true gentleman, well-mannered and friendly. Becoming a mail order bride had been the best decision of his life so far.
Tony might have lost most of his meager belongings, but he was going to marry a man who would love him. He was going to live a happy life, far away from the city and the alphas from his past. Maybe they’d even start a family. Tony had never thought he’d be the kind of omega to wish for children, but now that a family and kids and a brighter future were a palpable possibility he found himself longing for it.
“And these two are my parents, Tony and Steve, but for today they’re Morticia and Gomez.” Peter introduced them. They waved at a smiling MJ. No matter how annoyed their teenage son liked to pretend to be, Steve clearly heard the amusement in his voice.
Steve’s arms snaked around Tony’s middle to hold him close. He whistled and within ten seconds Dodger came running towards where the pair was standing in the living room. Tony stared at their dog as if he’d suddenly grown a second head.
Steve was in charge, Tony was willingly letting him lead, letting himself be manhandled by Steve. It was intoxicating and addictive, knowing that Tony trusted him enough to take care of him.
“I'm sorry, Steve. I won't be able to be there. It's not allowed, I'm no member of the Jedi Order as you just said yourself.” The older man looked down at the ground between them. Steve's heart sank. Just when he was about to open his mouth again, Tony continued. “But… if your duties allowed it, it would be my pleasure to treat you to dinner afterward. To celebrate. That you're a Jedi Knight then. That is, if Jedi are even allowed to celebrate.” He winked at him and Steve felt himself blush full force.
helping Steve with science to back him up, it’s almost overwhelming.
love with him.
Tony’s own body is wasted and sore, his stomach so empty now that it’s nothing but an absent ache, but between medical checks, the breaks themselves, Extremis, and once-daily visits to the Cradle (which is very quickly moved into an area directly outside Steve’s cell, so Steve can keep his eye on Tony without losing his shit), he’s in roughly good shape. The amount of come Steve’s producing is enough to mostly keep him wet, and he lubes up with a syringe when he needs to, but his body’s practically used to almost always being stuffed full at this point – it feels decidedly weird and wrong to be empty now, even though his gut still cramps from being plugged with come and his insides still feel battered.
I won’t fuck this up,” he says honestly. And he won’t. He loves Steve too damn much to risk his in.
. He nearly succeeds, Steve nearly sliding off of Tony sideways onto the nearby boulder and allowing Tony leverage himself to his palms, but then there’s gentle, though very insistent teeth around the back of his neck while Steve’s limbs tighten around his body, pushing Tony’s chest and face back down to the grass and dirt. His prick slides along the crease of Tony’s arse and sporadically slipping painfully into his arse once, twice, and then one final time before Steve
That is fucking excruciating now that he’s sated, just like he knew it would be, and Tony lets out a pathetically small scream as the knot pulls at his rim. He scrambles up as much as his watery limbs and bloated stomach will allow in an unconscious, desperate attempt to make him
lock Tony up in a windowless box; conversely, if he’s honest and open about
and also out of fear because it’s over, and now he has to face what he’s done.
For a seemingly long period of time, his brain simply cannot compute what’s happening even as he feels Steve’s massive body moving against him, and all he can do is try to brace himself so his entire face doesn’t scrape into the ground, his heart racing and time feeling like it’s simultaneously too fast and too slow. He can feel as much as hear Steve growling and whining against his back, the vibrations buzzing under his skin, and the blond fur coating Steve is soft against the exposed skin of his neck, his back, his arse, his thighs. There’s something about this that is vaguely familiar, and his fuzzy mind tries to dissect it through the adrenaline and fear, Steve’s heavy panting so very close to his ear.
, the gel and fear and disorientation clogging his throat—
” he adds, loudly enough to be heard through the roar of the Hulk in the background of someone’s comm.
), pummelling into his insides hard and mercilessly, he zones out completely again, his throat so sore from screaming and crying and begging that he doesn’t make a sound. Despite the pain and exhaustion and sloshing come in his gut, he’s apparently recovered enough that it feels somewhat good again despite the cramping; he doesn’t have the energy to move his body into the thrusts at all, extremities numb from being bent at the knees for so long, and time seems to warp, pleasure warring with agony and all of it so very confusing inside his muddled brain. His soft prick swings between his legs, dripping out precome just from the prostate stimulation, and even though it feels so very good all the sudden, he hasn’t a thought to touch it – the sheer suffering he’d dealt with after the previous full orgasm is more than enough to dissuade him of that notion.
, he was calm, y’know? Sat there and just licked his...paws, or something else on his body, or
He advances to the doorway of the mantrap, which opens at his approach, but he doesn’t enter it. Instead, he looks at Steve and says through the intercom, “Steve, I know you said no and I’m sorry, you can hate me later for this, the whole
good in bed, baby. Wish I could show you that without all the...”
, his body changing right in front of Tony’s eyes in a way that his overstressed, anxiety-ridden brain simply can’t compute. The explosion of hair and muscle and changing bones is so sudden that Tony’s numb fingers slip without being able to stop it, and Steve’s in freefall, his density ensuring that it’s fast even as he mutates in mid-air.
Everything blurs together for an age, Tony forgetting how many times he’s been inside the Cradle, his body perpetually sore and raw and ravished by pleasure and guilt, until suddenly everything changes.
,” Rhodey bites back.
Tony swallows back any other words that he wants to say and then finally steps into the mantrap, pressing his palm against the glass right where Steve’s paw rests as the glass door shuts behind him silently.
The only thing that replies is gasping breaths that are almost moans of what sounds like pain, and he can hear the distant sound of the forest floor being torn to pieces as if Steve’s on the ground, thrashing and God knows what else, before there’s an ear-splitting screech of interference and the comm goes dark. In response to the radio silence, Tony directs all power to his thrusters, ploughing entirely through trees instead in his haste to get to Steve’s location.
Tony’s torn between hysterical laughter and paralysing muteness, mouth opening and closing but throat too tight to get out a sound, and Natasha continues airily, “Though I will definitely admit that I manipulated the situation when I neglected to inform you that he was perfectly capable of understanding and remembering things people said while he was all furry, so I suppose the cat’s truly out of the bag now. Or wolf, as it were. He wants to talk to you when you’re ready, though I will also say that I will personally drag you to him if you even think about pulling a disappearing act, and I can guarantee that it will be both humiliating
The thing is you didn’t have amnesia. You remember your name, your address, you remember having a mother and a brother. You remember…. You remember them leaving… turning into dust with everyone else. But you can’t picture their faces. Just their faces are gone from your memory.
“You’re my soulmate.”
“What wasn’t?”
He hadn’t gotten any more sleep. He’d stayed up copying and rewriting most of his lost designs and prototypes. He also spent about three hours fixing his soldering iron. He could have just bought a new one, but paranoia has set in hard these last few days. Tools for building were exactly the kind of thing Killian would be monitoring for purchases on the lookout for Tony, and ‘better safe than sorry’ has become his new motto.
“Yeah, a little? Maybe? I was supposed to die, Buck. I was not strong enough to last this long. What if—what if Tony has two soulmates to make up for the fact that I was supposed to die?”
“So uh, you want to look at my arm?” Bucky’s voice breaks the silence, and Tony is happy it’s not just to say goodbye.
Bucky and his questions. His little applications for permission to touch and to keep touching, something about his voice and the way his lips form words makes Tony’s skin want to light up with the heat of a blush. Which is so strange because he never used to be the type to blush.
You and Steve both take a step back when it hits a house out of sight, a large crash, and the rumble in the ground is so strong you almost lose your footing. Glass breaks in houses all around with violent shake.
“I’m not on any medications- at the moment.”
No one prepared him for this. For living, for loving.
“I’m scared to tell them.” His jello gone, only tiny clumps of it in the corner of the cup. “I don’t want things to change.”
When he does finally pull back, he only allows Loki away at an arm’s length, keeping hands on his shoulders. “How? How did you escape death this time?”
There was more than one smell on Steve’s skin, light layers of different scents piled one on top of the other. First was vinegar, and salt, like pickles. Then something softer, fruit. It was faint, and smooth, probably fabric softener. Then something else, the hardest to detect, and one without name, but memorable.
“He says, that he’s fine, and doesn’t want you to worry. He’s sorry he was scared and made you feel bad. That it didn’t hurt… I don’t know he’s kind of talking really fast.” You shrug.
You freeze. Knowing it’s one of the creatures. It either stayed behind or got tired of chasing Steve and came back. You didn’t think the flashlight would be a good enough weapon to stop it, and running in these tunnels weren’t ideal. Besides, this creature lives down here. It’s going to have a hell of a lot better chance at navigating and catching you than you would have of getting away.
Then he bent slightly forward, one of his hands sneaking down between his spread legs and vanishing behind his balls. Only the wet sounds and Tony’s ragged breath indicated that he’d just started stretching himself on top of Steve. His free hand found purchase on Steve’s abs, still glistening with a copious amount of hand lotion.
The corners of her mouth just barely lifted when Tony told her about the situation at hand and how it had come to this, since Steve sat embarrassed and tongue-tied in front of the middle-aged woman with his shirt unbuttoned, exposing his red nipples for the world to see. The doctor’s assistant on the other hand could barely hold in her laughter, and Dr Getz stumbled three times over her words when she asked her to either pull herself together or leave the room. Choking on her laughter and apologies, the young woman quickly left them alone.
The trunk of a man must have felt him staring because he waved at Tony with a broad grin. Spooked, Tony ducked behind the horse. He crouched down and hugged his knees.
I'm offering a fic and handmade merchandise this year. You can find me as Perlmutt listed among the creators. ;) <3
"Like a unicorn! Thank you, Daddy!" His baby girl stood up a bit wobbly and pressed a sloppy kiss to his cheek.
He would no longer just survive. He would live. And if Tony wanted him, then he would live with Tony, wherever the force would lead them, be it in the caves of Kashyyyk or on the mountains of Ralltiir.
Maybe he had been lucky.
“Yeah, dinner sounds good.” Steve smiled at him. His hand was still in Tony's and he felt every nerve ending like it was on fire. How could this simple skin to skin contact make him feel like he was in free fall?
“So- so- so frustratingly observant and attentive and gorgeous and you’re driving me crazy, you asshole!” Tony ground out, aiming for pissed off but missing by a mile. Steve couldn’t see how he pulled his fingers out, but he could hear it. The engineer was all gentle edges and soft curves, slightly pink, and his eyes glistened in a post-coital haze. He gnawed on his bottom lip and pouted. “I wanted to come on your dick, not my fingers!”
“Hey…” Tony’s sleepy voice pulled him from his spinning thoughts.
Tony was suddenly wide awake. "Two weeks?! Isn't there any other city close by?" How was he supposed to survive two weeks? Two weeks of living with these strangers? Two weeks in close proximity to the alpha sheriff? Tony felt sick.
To be continued
The betas and the two alphas were packing their bags and preparing the horses for their departure. The group had agreed to bring him to the next city and ironically enough it was their hometown Shield. Tony hoped that there was a train station, so he could get out of here as fast as possible.
“But dad has a scar! So love does hurt!” Harley clung to Steve’s bicep and peered over to where his sister was.
Tony’s goatee scratched over his chin and lips as they stood and kissed languidly. It was everything. Steve’s thoughts were blessedly empty. At this moment nothing else mattered.
“Yeah, Thor comes in handy with the heavy lifting and Bruce apparently can talk tech with me. I like him.” He concluded and raised his hand in thanks to the two of them before his eyes found Steve's again. “Steve, do you… I mean- would you like to...” He gnawed on his bottom lip. “Uh, maybe you- err, your team would like to, uh, spend the night? Here, I mean? I got some spare rooms just next to the main workshop and you guys look like you need a few hours of sleep. And it would also be better if I took another look at your ship tomorrow morning when the hyperspace engine is fully back online. We could eat together and you could tell me what happened to you after the, you know… that day… But we don't have to, if it makes you uncomfortable-”
Tony shook his head once and watched his family, exhausted but perfectly happy. “No. Let them sleep. Just for another moment.”
It hadn’t been long since the last time he had seen Tony’s skin shine like that. Gasping, he had been hovering above Steve, with his knees bent and his hands on the blonde’s chest. Tony’s warmth had engulfed Steve wholly. The force around them had connected them deeply and the taller man had held on tightly to his beloved’s slender waist.
“Steve, how often do I have to tell you to call me Tony when we're alone?” The consultant of the senate laid a gentle hand on his skinny shoulder. He was a few years older than Steve and a well-known and welcomed guest on Coruscant, the political capital of the Galactic Republic.
Tony startled and fell backwards on his butt when suddenly the face of the sheriff appeared above him. The alpha looked over the back of the horse and how was he so tall?! This was so unfair!
Steve’s eyes wandered from Tony’s shocked expression at his shredded clothes to the healthy blush that spread from his cheeks down to his neck, over his sweaty wife-beater which had ridden up to reveal his abs, until he could finally openly stare at Tony’s erection that rested on Steve's belly
Tony buried his face in Steve’s strong neck for another moment before kissing Steve’s jaw softly. Then they turned around to wander down the hallway to the living room. They held hands like on the first date.
“Well, Peter wanted to try it for himself after I was done cutting his hair. Dodger needed a haircut as well, so…” Steve shrugged and smiled at a gobsmacked Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
Unable to come up with a witty remark, Steve just grunted in response. He unsuccessfully tried to get rid of the pants that hid Tony’s dick from his sight without dislodging him. Tony just chuckled in delight and giggled at his struggles while making no move to help Steve get him out of his clothes.
“Here you go, Tony. It'll warm you up.” Bruce handed him his own mug of tea that he gratefully accepted. The cold from the icy river water was still clinging to him. Various members of the group watched him a bit sceptical. Tony felt himself tense up under their gazes and busied himself with his herbal tea. Internally he sighed and prepared himself for a long evening.
"Oh, fuck… To- Tony…" Steve moaned low in his throat when the head vanished in Tony's mouth like his cock was a fucking popsicle. He carded his fingers through his lover's dark hair, holding him gently but letting him decide how much of Steve's dick he really wanted to take into his mouth. Maybe he was high on adrenaline, but Steve was still coherent enough to be aware that he was indeed huge. He'd had his fair share of awkward sexual encounters where his partners had decided that they couldn't take him after all, and the last thing he wanted was to injure Tony by being careless or pushy.
The children had gone quiet, both pondering over what their parents had just told them. The only sound in the warm bathroom was the sound of the music in the background and the soft popping sounds of the bubbles.
“Are you deaf? I meant it exactly like I said it. I can’t ride. I’ve only ever used carriages in the city,” Tony told him a little exasperated.
He wasn't proud of it, but Steve almost came at that. His hips bucked beneath Tony, pleasantly trapped beneath him. "I- you mean… we can't, Tony," he said, aware of just how wrecked he sounded, "I'm too big, I'd hurt you-"
“I know it’s dangerous, Tony. Believe me when I say that I know that. But we have to. I promised- I promised it to my master. I promised Master Erskine that I would free the galaxy.” He drew a shuddering breath and the heat of the suns was suddenly not enough to warm him up as the cold of his memories wrapped itself around him like a blanket that wanted to choke him.
Clint: Zabrak
“Dad? Pops?” Harley started and Morgan took over. “What is love?”
Steve swallowed, a new wave of arousal and adrenaline coursing through his body. He unceremoniously tightened his grip on Tony’s hips, fingers digging into the soft flesh. There would be hand shaped bruises come tomorrow morning, and the thought of leaving a mark on Tony was exhilarating. Steve grunted, raised Tony slightly, who went along with everything Steve did to him, and pushed him back down onto his dick.
Not too far away from the camp he found a little clearing near the water. Hidden by the thick underbrush, he hurriedly stripped off and washed up as well as he could considering the water’s icy temperatures. Absent-mindedly, he touched the still healing scars on his chest. The skin there was red and ugly.
A few heartbeats passed in which the omega stared at the alpha, whose smile never faltered. Then Tony sighed in defeat.
“Don't be mean to each other, Harley,  Morgan, please." Tony raised an eyebrow at the kids until they mumbled apologies.
“You’re lucky I love you,” Steve deadpanned, rocking their baby gently. Peter waved his little fists at his fathers, looking like an angel, now that he’d finally gotten what he’d wanted all along.
The omega sat on a log by the campfire in the middle of a forest. His shoes were dirty, his pants were too, and there was a bloodstain on his mother’s button down. It was probably his own blood, though that didn’t really make it any better. He’d lost the necklace. Tony had lost his mother’s necklace.
“Y-you do?” Steve questioned and stilled his hands on Tony’s buttcheeks. Carefully he pulled them apart, just a tiny little bit, but he instantly felt how the first drops of cum leaked out and ran down his shaft to his balls.
“That’s okay, dear. Neither can I.” Steve leaned in and very gently kissed the shorter man’s lips, so he wouldn’t ruin the make up his husband had on. The dark eyeshadow and pale teint let Tony look like a vampire. It was enchanting. Tony’s eyes fell closed and Steve inhaled his scent through his nose.
Bruce: Mirialan (the species got green skin, I couldn't resist)
“Oh, you have the best ideas, darling,” Tony happily grinned up at him. “Well, except for maybe deciding to turn our son into a 1960’s pop idol.”
Next in line is a little girl, maybe six years old; it's hard to tell. She's got a pink knitted cap on over her dark braids, and there's a Captain Marvel picture on her jacket. Steve's been watching her as the line moves up, and the way she presses tight to her mom. She's going to be one of those kids who's too scared to actually sit on his lap, he can already tell.
Whatever Tony says, though, it makes the little girl smile. She looks at Steve, then up at her mom. The mom makes an encouraging gesture. The girl looks at Steve again. He smiles his best benign Santa Cap smile and beckons with one gloved hand.
Tony resists just long enough for Steve to think he's made a terrible mistake. Then he reaches up to seize Steve close, one hand snaking around his neck, pulling him in.
He gives Tony another kiss, this one short but sweet. He lets go and steps back. "Merry Christmas, Tony."
It's hard to tell what Tony is working on today. As usual his attention seems to be split between multiple projects. One minute he's studying an electron microscope; in the next he's monitoring a 3-D printer that appears to be replicating Iron Man armor. The Tower AI surely must have told him that Steve was outside, ready to enter, but it still takes him a few minutes to look up and see Steve standing there. When he does finally realize he's not alone, he blinks rapidly, needing a few moments to center himself on this new object of fascination.
Steve knows which one he has.
One person didn't visit him, though. He hadn't honestly expected it, though it had stung a little at the time. But with some time to reflect, he's actually glad Tony didn't come. He wouldn't have wanted to hold a serious, intimate conversation in the hospital. And avoiding it would only have been awkward.
Steve flounders like someone just tossed him into the deep end of a pool, where the waters are freezing cold and unexpectedly deep. He can hardly feel his own hands where he grips them tight. "What do you mean, I don't love you?"
"Do you believe me now?" Steve says.
Together they moved into the bedroom, Tony shutting the door behind them. Outside the sky was starting to lighten with the rising sun, but in here it was still warm and dark. And he had been wrong again, he thought. It wasn’t the suit that made him feel safe.
But that was later. Now was for Steve’s kiss, Steve’s hands, Steve’s body.
When Steve is nearly out the door, though, he stirs. "Thank you, Steve. Really." This time it sounds like he means it.
The armory doors open at his password, despite the uneven sound of the words. He walks inside, all the way in, not lingering in the doorway the way Tony did that day, the way he would if he were uncertain of his welcome.
Only now, after too many long days and sleepless nights, could he admit how wrong he had been.
Steve barely hesitated as he led them onto the bed, naked skin on skin. “Okay.”
Then Tony relaxes. He smiles again. "Could be," he says. "You never know."
And he's never yet been afraid to take on a challenge.
"What the hell is it?" War Machine demands. Like Iron Man and Wasp, he's flying carefully around the perimeter of the force field, keeping his distance while searching for some weakness.
Tony holds up the uniform. "Reinforced with a new fabric of my own design." He shakes his head a little deprecatingly and says in a rapid-fire murmur, "Okay well maybe the X-Men thought of it too but anyway." He gazes at Steve. "It should keep you safe."
Steve takes the elevator down. He is mostly pain-free now and breathing just fine, though he does get an occasional twinge in his chest if he makes a too-sharp move or inhales too deep. By tomorrow even that should be gone, his body restored to complete health and strength, the injuries forgotten under the play of muscle.
He coughs again, tasting blood. It hurts like hell. He doesn't want to spit blood all over Tony.
Voices surround him. Some sound angry. One, dearly beloved, says his name. Repulsor fire blooms in the distance, bright points of light against the fading white.
"Me too," Tony says.
It was all right, Tony understood. Steve wasn’t angry with him, or thought he was being presumptuous or silly or anything like that. In fact, Steve was just as happy to see him as Tony was to be there.
With some effort, Steve brings his attention back to the situation at hand. He's been fielding this question all day; the answer comes easy. But even as he says it, part of him is marveling over what just happened. Part of him is watching as Tony smiles and greets the next child in line. Part of him is remembering the way Tony smiled, how that smile seemed to be just for him.
That would explain the weird way Tony froze yesterday, and the strained quality to his smiles. But that only deepens the mystery. Why isn't he happy about this? Has Steve so drastically misread him all this time?
believe he means it, that Steve will turn away, forever slamming shut the door on any chance they might have.
"I guess we could," Tony says. Then his eyes widen as the full meaning of that sinks in. "Wait, you mean go together?"
"Yes?" Steve says but that's all wrong because he doesn't mean it as a question. "Yes," he says again. An affirmation. "We're going to make this work."
Steve’s lips were warm and soft, his mouth warm and inviting. Tony pressed against him, one hand flat on the skin of Steve’s back, the other somewhere between them, trying to get rid of their clothing. Their fingers tangled as Steve reached down with the same intent, and Tony broke the kiss to throw back his head and laugh with pure joy.
Steve stared at her. "What's all this?"
He doesn't forget about the girl sitting on his lap, or the kids and their parents, the fake snow and the seven-foot high Christmas trees. He doesn't stop hearing the holiday music or the kids yelling. It is not a Moment. There is no bolt of lightning. But there is no mistaking what has just happened.
He had smiled, pretending the question didn’t bother him. “Steve, you would be bored to death out there, trust me. And I know you’re not the type to just hang out by the hotel pool all day, working on your tan.”
Tony just looks at him. His eyes are so blue, Steve thinks randomly. "It was a lot of fun," he adds.
"It was your idea, wasn't it," Steve says. He didn't know that before now, and he has no proof of the allegation, but he knows it's true all the same. The media likes to label Tony as heartless, but this is the same man who revealed his superhero identity to the world for the sake of saving a puppy. They don't know him. None of them do.
Steve smiles at her. "Merry Christmas, Emilia."
He could kiss Steve, and be kissed in return.
But he hesitates. He isn't ready to kiss Tony in public yet. And he believes Tony isn't ready for it, either. Tony still has to learn to accept that Steve is in love with him. An embarrassing kiss in front of everyone won't exactly help with that.
The news coverage about the charity event is predictable. Fox News, with their usual barely-veiled hostility, calls it a publicity stunt. Other organizations are nicer, mentioning that Steve played Santa for over five hours in order to visit with all the kids, or that there was no cost to anyone who attended. There a few quotes from Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, which surprises Steve; he hadn't known they had pulled press duty, although it does explain why so few reporters wanted to talk to him afterward.
With Tony still in Seattle, it's up to the Tower AI to let him into the armory. Even without Tony being here, he has no doubts that he will be granted access – a privilege few can claim – and as he expects, the doors unlock and he is allowed inside.
On Steve's lap, the little girl named Emilia looks up at him with some anxiety and says, "Mami says you're not the real Santa."
He has to tell Tony what happened yesterday, but he has absolutely no idea how to say it.
Tony pulled him down with both arms. He had hoped, but he hadn’t known. Not for sure. But he knew it now. And he wasn’t likely to forget.
Steve’s eyes widened. “What are you doing here?”
"Here's how it would go," Tony says. He sounds infinitely patient, a man with a brilliant intellect explaining a concept only he can truly understand. "One of us would think the other was hurt, or even killed, only to find out they were wrong. And it would just come out in the heat of the moment. But we would both know it wasn't real." For the first time since they sat down, he looks Steve in the eye. "Just like this isn't real."
"About what I said," Tony starts. Steve wonders how many scripts he has already tossed aside, now that he has been forced to begin the conversation instead of reacting to an overture.
Steve laughs, and after a moment, Tony laughs alongside him. Sheer joy washes through him. This is really going to happen. He loves Tony and Tony loves him and they are really doing this. "I couldn't agree more."
"So," Steve says. "What would you like for Christmas?"
For a moment genuine pain shows on Tony's face as the mask cracks. Always a mask with Tony, and not always of crimson armor either. "That'll never happen again," he vows. He walks over to another table opposite his desk. "I've made sure of it."
"Cap!" A hand grabs for his elbow and misses. It's Johnny Storm, a long way from sober. "I didn't think you were coming!"
"A lot better," Steve says. He glances around, sees that every one of those individual coffee servings he bought are still there. Not one has been used.
"So," Steve says. "What you said." Bringing the conversation back where it belongs. "You're going to tell me now you didn't mean it."
"That's how," he says. He stands with his forehead bowed, touching Tony's forehead. Tony's hand is still on the back of his neck, and he is still clutching Tony's shoulders even though he doesn't remember reaching up to do that. He's reluctant to let go. He's afraid if he does he'll never get this back again.
Tony just stands there, further away than Steve would like, staring at him. The look on his face is vaguely familiar, but it takes Steve a second to recognize it. When he does, he wants to cringe. Tony is looking at him the way he does when he's faced with an unforeseen problem.
Two days later, Natasha had handed him a stack of something red and velvety all over. White fur lined the edges, and a thick black belt sat coiled atop it all. "Here you go."
Because the thing about Tony Stark is, most people, including some of the same superheroes they work with, think he's arrogant. They see his belief that he's the only one who knows the right course to take as further proof of his conceit. Steve does not exempt himself from falling into that trap; he knows he's done it more than once.
And so he had left, but not without regrets. The truth was, he hadn’t wanted Steve here because part of him had known even then that he would not be able to enjoy the expo. Not the way he had in the past. And he hadn’t wanted to pretend in front of Steve, to act like he was still thrilled to see new weaponry and do the inevitable Tony Stark thing by boasting out loud that his own genius could have done better. He hadn’t wanted the inevitable questions, the gossip, the sneaky photographs that would end up in a tabloid the next day, captioned by a tacky headline.
Tony glances around the armory, like he's searching for an excuse to say no, for some important work that he can claim he can't pull himself away from. But then he turns back to Steve with a smile. "Sure," he says. "What's up, Cap?"
Tony moves aside, coming further into the room but remaining near the wall. Still keeping his distance. He watches Steve approach with all the focus of someone who is ready to bolt at a moment's notice.
Tony's hands rise to clutch his arms. They are nearly the same height, and there is no effort involved at all to kiss Tony. It is, in fact, the easiest thing Steve has ever done.
"So what then?" Steve demands. His chest hurts, though it has nothing to do with his injuries.
Their eyes meet. Steve smiles. Tony raises his water in a silent toast.
He hates that. He doesn't want to be a riddle to be solved.
“Tony.” Steve’s jaw tightened, a sure sign that he was displeased. “I hope you didn’t abandon your obligations just to come here and say that.”
"You weren't planning on working all night, were you?" Steve says. Even as the words are coming out of his mouth though, he knows the answer. Of course Tony was planning to work all night, holiday or not. Probably he even expected to bury himself in work to forget the painful but inevitable outcome of this conversation. But for once things haven't turned out as Tony planned. For once he's making it up as he goes along.
Even super-soldier healing can't quickly undo the damage caused by multiple puncture wounds and internal injuries. It's Christmas Eve before Steve is allowed to return to Avengers Tower, with an admonition by his doctors not to overdo it. He thanks them all for taking care of him, then leaves the hospital.
The suit was there in a moment, unfolding itself, wrapping around him, enclosing him in the only place he had ever truly felt safe. The HUD blinked on and a second later he was in the air, arcing away from the hotel and the lights of the city.
"Thank you for yesterday," Steve says.
Steve smiles at him. "Yes," he says. "Together."
“Sir, I should point out that you are nearly at the Nevada state line,” the AI said.
This is certainly true, but Steve also knows that Tony would have made an excuse for his absence at the expo if he hadn't seized on it as the perfect excuse to leave the city. He also knows there is still a strong Stark Industries presence in Seattle. If Tony wants, he can find enough work to do there to keep him busy -- and away from New York -- for months.
He knows Tony considers him a close friend. They've been through things together that would have broken lesser friendships forever. Their lives are not easy, even when they aren't trying to save the world from the latest villainous plot.
The party is exactly what Steve expected. A little too loud, a little too over-decorated, and a surprising amount of fun.
"You only think you do," Tony continues. He musters another smile.
A man who doesn't believe he is worthy of being loved.
Up high, he could see stars, the light pollution left behind him along with every hope and disappointment and boring speech from the previous day. He streaked down a street that was little more than a blur of color from this distance, absently noted a plane leaving McCarran Airport, and banked to his right.
But all that is just the surface. Behind the glittering smile and the confidence that rules a global industrial empire is just a man. A man who doesn't really like himself. A man who will never stop trying to atone for a past he can never change.
Five minutes ago everything was different.
He has a meeting later with a lady from the VA, finalizing some plans that have been in the works for months now. It's another charity event, something he genuinely enjoys doing, especially when there are veterans and their families involved. As of right now, the event is little more than a lunch meet-and-greet, a thing Steve has done so often he could probably do it in his sleep by now.
This year it was different, though. It wasn’t just that he no longer drank, or that SI didn’t make weapons. The whole expo felt off, somehow, and Tony couldn’t put his finger on it. He only knew that he felt restless in his own skin as he gazed on the exhibits and made banal small talk with the men and women who were his competitors on a good day, and bitter enemies the rest of the time.
"Yes, I was actually," Tony says. He is completely frank, no apology, no embarrassment at admitting that he was going to work through Christmas.
That's good. That's exactly what Steve wants. He has to work to get Tony to be spontaneous, to say something that isn't planned.
It seems to take forever. He can't see anything for the dazzle-white glare covering his sight. He can't see the broken building at his back, and the crumpled rebar.
It's the last reaction Steve expects. He's so astonished he can barely get the words out. "You do?"
Thor and Jane move on. Hank McCoy touches Tony's arm and gestures to the kitchen, where enough food is laid out that even the Hulk wouldn't have cause to complain. Tony shakes his head, and Hank leaves alone.
He would like to fall down. He really would. But he can't move. There's too much pain; it's in the way. Whether he likes it or not, he isn't going anywhere.
Well, he hasn't yet encountered a barrier that the vibranium shield can't cut through. He starts forward at a run, cocks his arm back and lets fly. The instant he does, he hears Tony's voice in his ear. "Steve, don't!" The use of his name, not his title, is enough to startle him, and he jerks his arm to the side, but by then it's too late. The shield is already on its way -- and so is Steve.
Tony seems to realize something is required of him here. A conversation needs two people, after all. "Yeah, it was. The kids all seemed to have fun." He smiles.
"I always knew this would happen," Tony says. "But I thought it would happen on the battlefield."
Tony's laughter tapers off into an amused smile, and Steve abruptly realizes that he's got a big problem. Because every time Tony smiles at him, little fireworks go off in the pit of his stomach. It makes it very hard to concentrate on anything.
It was late when the realization came to him, well into the early morning hours of the next day. Thursday, maybe. He didn’t know. He was exhausted, every fiber of his body crying out for sleep. All the days blurred together during a week like this, full of exhibit halls and lectures all day long, extravagant dinners and parties all evening, and frantic sessions with your fellow co-workers all night while you strove to make your exhibit better, your tech shinier, and outdo what you had seen that day from someone else.
Seeing only one way out of this whole nightmare, Steve came to a decision.
She nodded and joined her husband, who was checking in on the young mother and her baby, but not without making Tony promise to let her know if he felt sick.
"Listen, I'm out. All I want is to leave this mess behind me,” Tony interrupted them. “Can you take me to the next city? I don't know where I am, and I'm not keen on getting lost in the woods again. I'm thankful for your help, but I don't want to see that asshole ever again. I want to live the rest of my fucking life in peace, without any stupid alphas to worry about."
"Jesus Christ!" Tony gasped into his neck. His thighs trembled slightly and he raised his head from where he had laid it down to be able to look into the blonde’s face. They were impossibly close. Tony's face was rosy and his eyes huge, sparkling with a post-coital haze. He was beautiful and Steve couldn't avert his eyes even if his life had depended on it. "How are you still hard?"
(Also located on Coruscant, has an own building, every planetary system that is part of the Republic has a senator)
The warmth of the lilac water was balm for his aching back. Tony always felt his own age after pulling a long allnighter in the workshop. As an omega in his mid-forties he wasn’t old per se, but when he looked at his children growing up so fast, he felt ancient. With a quiet groan he sat down and leaned back against the wall of the bathtub.
The omega looked at the deputy. He was a bit older than him, his dark hair was tied up in a messy bun. Tony wanted to believe that he’d been found by good and kind people, but today wasn’t his lucky day. They stared at each other for another moment before Tony sighed and gave in.
“There’s a robber band that we were trailing,” James suddenly said. He came forth and sat down next to Tony. His spurs clinked with every step. “But we lost them a few miles from here. They're pretty good at hiding. Now we’re on our way home. We've been gone for too long.”
“So what?” Steve prompted, surprised that he still had the ability to speak after watching Tony Stark ejaculate on top of him. The brunet’s dick was softening slowly, but not deflating completely.
“You’re sleeping on the couch for another week,” Steve decided and ducked his head where he was sitting in one of the uncomfortable generic plastic chairs. Tony could only describe his husband’s demeanor as pouting and it was the most adorable thing ever, next to their son of course.
“I’m sorry, honey!” Steve apologized to his husband. “Almost done… Here you go.” Steve closed the button in Tony’s neck and let his hands wander over the black lace of the dress. “All done. You’re ready, Tony.”
The situation was as follows: Peter refused to let a hairdresser touch him, ever since Tony’s barber had accidentally injured him. It hadn’t been the poor man’s fault at all. Peter hadn’t held still and it had been just a tiny scratch on his earlobe, but apparently that had been enough for him to develop a dislike for barbers and hairdressers in general.
and they get scared! They run away.”
“What?”
Tony walks down the hall just as you do, and he sighs relieved. “Thank goodness. I thought I’d managed to screw things up with another kid.”
Also where the heck did that creature come from?
“What did he say?” Bucky asks finally stringing a sentence together.
“An observation that sent him runnin’.”
Gripping himself through his pants, he groans lowly, not daring to be any louder knowing Steve’s good hearing. He bites his lips to prevent any more sounds, continuing to squeeze and release pressure. Thoughts all of Tony,
Steve earlier said that if anyone would be okay with it, it’d be Tony.
You just became his number one priority.
Tony: Because last time went so well.
Stephen nods. “Alright. Can you tell me if it’s been causing you any pain?”
“Yes, it’s on your bedside table.”
. You didn’t know anything about me.”
Steve smiles. Bucky doesn’t do nervous well. He’s sort of an all or nothing guy. He’s either angry or happy. He either knows what he’s doing or has no clue. Wanting to do something, but being afraid to do it isn’t something Bucky’s probably ever felt.
“I truly don’t know, Sir.”
“How do you know?” You ask, “How do you always know what’s going to happen before it happens? How do you know where I should go and where I should be? How do you know it’s going to work?”
The gravity on Titan is different than Earth’s but Thor is used to changes like this. He’s been to many different planets. He acclimates just fine. He keeps his back straight and head high as he walks up to Thanos. The Titan doesn’t even bother standing, seeming perfectly relaxed. It pisses Thor off to no end. To be treated like he’s not even a threat. But relaxation and confidence like that comes with victory.
They don’t go back to the room to eat, instead, they sat in Stephen’s office. The door locked behind them to keep from getting unwanted visitors. Tony didn’t get the sense that Stephen uses the lock often but he’s grateful for it.
He’s shirtless. Two blue hand-prints on his shoulders, and one red on his hip. The only colors in the entire sketch, making them stand out.
“I get it though,” Bucky says after a moment. “I wish he was here right now, sleeping on our batty old couch, or at least, I was there with him. I feel like I want to protect him or something. At the very least, I just want to smell him again. He smells nice.” Bucky smiles. Steve nods.
Tony nods, he stands from the stool, and begins to clean his desk, giving himself work. Distractions help. He needs something else to do and he can’t look at Bucky.
That’s what everyone kept repeating.
“Yay, hopefully, they'll finally give me some drugs.”
He could still remember the feeling of her wrist crack under his fingers. He’d paid her hospital bill, and she never came back to the gym.
“My people are all dead. My home is gone. All I have is ‘petty vengeance.’”
He wouldn’t let it happen again.
“Six months.” Killian sighed to himself, looking at the calendar sat up on his desk. They haven’t been apart any duration longer than two months ever since Tony’s parents died. They had sessions once a week. Every Friday like clockwork. Tony only ever missed because of business trips and company parties he needed to attend.
“Yes.”
“Jerk.”
And before anyone says anything. Bucky was worth it. He was worth fighting, and becoming a fugitive. Steve would never regret sticking up to save his best friend. But that doesn’t make him blind to the cost.
Steve smiles and crawls across the hall scooting down next to you, and the heat coming from him is almost alarming. But you don’t mention it.
“A story?” Steve mulls it over, before he hums in agreement. “Hmm, I can work with that.”
“Us?”
Now he was pale, sickly, and alone.
A knock on the door took him from the path of jealousy he headed toward.
Tony gasped, snapping his finger. “Oh my gosh, Stephen Strange.” He laughed. “You were the other asshole huddled by the bar.”
“Yeah.” You mumbled, not wanting to get into it. “Everyone did.”
“Stark Tower would be a great place to get everyone settled.”
Bucky’s eyebrows furrow, confusion setting in. “You expect me to drop my soulmate because you’re not ready to be kissing? What kind of guy do you think I am? I can wait.”
“You can sleep if you’d like,” Steve says, the two of you are sitting on opposite sides of a small hallway in front of an open front door. Strange gave you the address and told you to leave the door open and keep an eye on the skies, although it could be a while. You’re not even sure what you’re supposed to be watching for, or how this helps you find Tony.
“Gossiping?”
The sound of Steve’s fist hitting the counter and cracking makes him flinch back and the stool wobbles, he has to catch the counter to stop himself from falling completely. Steve gasps sharply once he’s realized what he’s done and steps back.
Stephen says, then comes that other voice again,
In most ways, Tony looks like he hasn’t changed. But in other ways, he looks completely different. This was Tony Stark, the same man he knew two years ago, the same man he was on a team with. Two years later and Tony sounds and looks exactly as Steve remembers.
Bucky nods. “If need be, then forever.”
“Are you sure?”
That gets Tony pushing up out of bed, he quickly pulls the door open grabbing the brown box where it’s set off to the side and he brings it in, doors click locked by Jarvis, as Tony sets it down on the unstable counter. He decides he’ll eat while it dries as he begins to open the package.
He just wanted to live his life. Alone. Alone is safer.
“Yep?”
“The order has been sent.”
“I agree.” Valkyrie stands. “Your plan is shit. You don’t know where he is, or how injured he is, and you’re forgetting he’s got the stones, he doesn’t need to be at full strength, they’ll do all the work for him.”
He began to taste the blood in his mouth and the fear caused him to hyperventilate.
“I’m Bucky, and you're not allowed to tell anyone what Steve said about the singing.”
“We need to fix the ship.”
“The rent for this place must be insane,” Steve says, their apartment is only six-hundred a month, but it’s also a piece of shit and tiny. Their apartment could probably fit in Tony’s living room. If he doesn’t have roommates then he’s footing the bill himself and that must be a small fortune.
Bruce turns to Rocket and Natasha, and they all seem to come to a silent agreement, with a series of nods, and they turn to Wong. Who then opens a portal back to Wakanda.
“Jarvis, fire extinguisher please!” Tony yells once he gets the air back in him. Immediately the connected hoses in the ceilings placed over the workbench go off spray foaming the entire area down in a matter of seconds. The smell of smoke and fire left in the air, Tony pulls away from the man seated on the ground next to him. There are metal pieces sticking in his door and wall. He definitely would have been hit in the chest or arm had he not been pushed out of the way.
Tony’s breaths even out, listening to the sound of Jarvis update him calms him. His hands clutch at the comforter when Jarvis adds on that he’s alone and safe. He only does that when he can see Tony on the verge of a panic attack, and it always helps.
“Yeah sure.”
“I have money Steve. Plenty of it. That’s not a problem.”
“No, you have to go to the apartment!”
“It is alright Sir, I understand that you sometimes need space. Even from me.” The AI replies for the first time in hours. Tony still doesn’t understand how he managed to code compassion and empathy into his AI but he’s damn grateful for it sometimes.
Not to mention the way he flinched when Steve reached out to help him stand afterwards.
When they’d met and touched, it became a neon orange. Almost glowing against his skin. Tony had wondered what color his soulmarks would turn out to be. Would they be different for the two mates, or would they all share the same color?
What the hell kind of last words are those? Tony chuckles humorlessly at the thought. Wiping the blood and tears from his face. He needed to move. To do something. Think for god sake, he is an engineer surrounded by alien technology, and whatever’s left of his nanobots.
You turn to face it slowly, taking the chance to look around the tunnel for a weapon, anything, even a decent sized rock to throw. The creature snarls again and lunges. But before it gets far, a gun goes off, splitting the creatures head open killing it instantly. You flinch back partly in fear and partly in pain as the sound echoes loudly throughout the tunnel.
He raises the gauntlet the lights of the stones powering up and whining. You see Steve come up behind him, he’s finally managed to shake off the creatures and join the fight. The brave idiot that he is, jumps up and grabs Thanos’ arm, changing the direction of the powered charge he intended to seen Valkyries way. This miss allowed her to hit Thanos’ body dead on with her ship, knocking him back off balance. Giving Tony the chance to detach off the half of his nanobots that fly down and wrap around Thanos’ body like chains. Thor charges his lightning and strikes it down on Thanos’ held form, and he jolts in pain.
“Why not?” Confusion filled Steve and a sickeningly pleased interest.
“He's my soulmate. Mine and Bucky's he's got two soul-bonds. He came to the gym one night, Bucky met him, then I did the next day.”
It took three tries to get Bruce to answer the phone. Steve hadn’t taken into account that it was nearly six in the morning. Bruce’s voice was tired and heavy when he answered. It turned to confusions at his questions, asking about the doctor that treated Natasha, and if he could get into contact with him again. There was true concern in his voice when he asked who it was for.
“Your phone, Sir, you’ve received a text message.”
You speed up, almost breaking into a full sprint until you’re across the street. “Is here good?”
Tony ignores it and smiles as they head to the elevator. It’s a quick exchanging of waves before the elevator closes and Tony locks himself in his apartment, thinking it all over.
“Tony this isn’t your fault.”
“What do I need to sacrifice?”
“I have a cellphone.”
The woman was dead, long dead hopefully so she didn’t have to suffer too much pain. One of her legs is missing and blood paints the whole area. You took a step back, moving silently. A plan formed immediately in your head. Get away and call animal control or the police, if there was anyone left that could handle it. If not then you’d tell Steve he might have been able to handle it.
“Yeah, it’s pretty much habit by now. There are lots of fires in this apartment.” He chuckles to himself thinking back to some of them. He’s got a tiny mark on his wrist from one a few weeks ago.
The sky rumbles with thunder and lightning. A growing storm collecting right above their heads. A physical sign of all the emotions building up inside of Thor. He’s trying to be angry. At himself, at Thanos, at the Valkyrie, but mostly at Loki.
Tony had never seen a photo of his future husband, but it didn’t matter. He told himself that he’d be happy and that he’d love him. Soon the future he dreamed of would be his reality.
Tony had just enough time to prepare for an ungainly slump when his fall was abruptly stopped by a brick wall in his back. Two strong hands held onto his shoulders to help him regain his balance. Tony shook his head to clear his vision and looked up into the blue eyes of the man who had caught him. A certain scent reached his nose and his subconsciousness immediately recognized it as
The Captain had to bite back a groan in frustration when his hands lost their grip on Tony's pretty butt. But on the other hand the position granted them the perfect view of both their dripping erections aligned. Awestruck, Steve looked at them, trying to memorize the differences in shape, color and -most prominently- size. He dared to raise his gaze to Tony’s face, who stared at Steve's cock while little stars and unicorns and rainbows seemed to dance in his eyes, like his wildest fantasy had just come to life.
Steve flushed and brushed over the lapels of his pinstripe suit. “Thank you. I am extremely impressed by Peter’s talent. He’s a pro with the sewing machine. It was very fascinating to watch him take your measurements. And then he went and finished your dress in less than two months.” Steve let his gaze and fingers wander over Tony’s dress once again.
“DAD! POPS! Are you finally done?!”
Steve didn't dare to think about what might have happened to Tony. The senate consultant must have been on his way to meet Steve, when all hell had broken loose. The thought of Tony being slaughtered because of him was his worst nightmare.
“Tony!” Steve gasped around his name and closed his eyes for a moment, when those delicate and deft fingers found his nipples.
Tony snuggled back into Steve’s chest. The fingers that were splayed over his middle were cold and he rubbed over them in the warm water. Steve pressed a kiss to his temple. He could smell Steve. His mate smelled of rain, autumn, pines and cinnamon and something that was uniquely him.
“Your luggage,” the robber who guarded the civilians and had cornered Tony suddenly said. “Hand it over.”
Steve rubbed a hand over his own neck and cringed where he was standing behind him. “Not yet, peanut. I’m sorry, papa’s almost done. You just gotta hold still for another minute, okay?”
“Good to hear, my friend.”
From time to time Steve even imagined he saw Tony's eyes follow him. And maybe Tony touched him a bit more than what was appropriate for heterosexual friends, seeked him out more often than the others. Those thoughts were what had led to Steve having ill-timed boners in the most awkward of situations. Steve had a very active imagination, okay? And secretly he still hoped that he didn’t imagine it all, and that maybe, perhaps, possibly Tony could one day look at him, like Steve did.
Only then did he catch up with his mate’s words. He turned around to follow Steve’s gaze and realized that Peter had managed to worm his way under Tony’s armpit into the circle of his arms without waking his father. The teen was curled up into a ball, sleeping peacefully with his head on his dad’s chest. In the darkness of the night the boy looked much younger than he was.
“Alright,” he promised breathlessly into Tony’s mouth and his hands found their way inside of Tony’s sweatpants, but not inside of his briefs. Steve firmly kept his hands out of them for now. He knew what he wanted to do next, and he would take his sweet time.
But she was probably right when it came to his clothes, Steve mused. He stood up and carefully placed his cleaning tools on his small bed. His team always made fun of him for dressing like a grandpa, but he liked the traditional Jedi robes, they were comfortable and reminded him in a good way of his past life. Pullip up the rough fabric over his head, he caught a glimpse of himself in the shiny surface of the metallic locker to his left. He was tall and his shoulders were broad. Muscles from years of hard work and fighting made him look more intimidating than he'd liked it. On the rare occasions when he saw a hologram of himself from his years as a Padawan, he wasn't sure if this body really was him or if this new appearance was merely a dream or a force-induced illusion.
On the coffee table in front of them was a sheet of paper with a drawing, clearly made by children's hands. It showed five stick-figures. Two big ones, one middle sized and two small figures. Everyone wore something red, because Morgan loved red clothes. There was a green mess beneath the stick-figures' feet, most probably grass and a yellow sun in one corner. One single blue cloud was in the other corner. Harley's handwriting filled the free space above the stick figures, where the sky began.
Everyone was knocked backward by the force of it, except for you and Thanos. Both frozen in place. Him on the ground, your hand over the Soul Stone that was now shining brightly. Around the two of you, a forcefield much like the one Thanos had conjured before to protect himself formed. Keeping them from reaching you.
“Steve, we can do this back and forth for hours if you like, but in the end, I’m not taking any money from you or Bucky. So you might as well save yourself some time, and get over it now ‘cause I already am.”
“Okay, we can check out the top.” Tony nods, turning back, making a few notes on the sketch behind him. “How often does the pain happen?”
Those voices he wishes he could forget and let go. Yearning for an escape from their endless torture to him. Even here, in the apartment that has become his safe haven to hide from everything, and everyone, they still echo around him, in him. Always hitting where it hurts the most.
He couldn’t stop him before.
Rounding the corner, you see a group of shadows growing in size. The first person to come into view is actually the raccoon. It’s in full gear and walking on two legs. You’re about to laugh and launch into a litany of question about how and why, but then you hear them. Multiple voices, suddenly growing in volume in your head, calling out, yelling for someone named Rocket. You clutch your head as it becomes too much. It feels so much worse than it did that first time couched down on the sidewalk.
Steve tilts his palms up so Tony can see, and instead of pitch black matching soulmarks on Steve’s hands, is a royal blue, and Tony realizes he’s ignored the feeling of cold once again.
“Well, you’re getting pretty handsy, making me blush.” Tony laughs, setting his tools to the side on the desk.
“Maybe I can have some fun putting together some stuff that won't be so easy for you to break.”
“Tony?” Her voice hopeful but wary, a quick fear that something had gone terribly wrong. Would it even be his voice on the other end of the line?
Tony shakes his head. “No.  Stark Industries hasn’t dabbled in prosthetics since before- well almost twenty years ago.”
“Is it okay if I carry you?”
Why not be like all the other billionaire’s wilding out, instead of the freak who hears his parent’s voices in his head. Constantly tormenting him. It’s his own special brand of survivor’s guilt. That’s what Killian had told him all those years ago when he finally opened up about it.
Steve, to this day, doesn’t know what was in those drugs. He knows it was some kind of steroid-based enhancers meant to strengthen the body, and there were antibiotics in it to prevent and get rid of infections. But there was something else, something they never told him the name of, but it was meant to help the body on a cellular level.
“Does y/n normally wander off in times of crisis like this?” Tony asks, they’ve kind of been looking for you almost twenty minutes now. Steve says he’s got no idea where you would’ve went but he’s sure you wouldn’t have gone far.
“I am Groot.”
“Stephen?”
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that. What does Bucky’s weird feelings have to do with him? But then there’s something else he remembers, something Killian told him.
“What can I do?”
Her eyes go wide and she looks to Tony and Stephen, who both look concerned.
Steve was busy trying to collect his heart from his stomach not to let emotion show on his face.
The most remarkable thing about it all is that Steve’s calm and almost docile even when they’re physically separated, Tony going through checks by the medical staff every six knots or so, and as long as Steve can see him, he doesn’t go apeshit (that had been a trial-and-error period that they were all adamant not to repeat). Instead, he eats – which Tony can’t really bring himself to watch, even though they’d attempted the previous types of food once Steve had stabilised and found out that freshly killed meat was apparently fine – and sleeps and cleans himself (and Tony, which is abjectly horrifying considering what he’s been eating). Like any starving animal, human or otherwise, he puts on weight remarkably fast, no doubt assisted by the serum that’s still running through his blood and bones, and by the end of even the second day, he’s just as thick and heavy as he was when he first mutated. It’s both good and bad: good because Steve is still and passive when he’s sated, which means that Tony’s not
“Steve,” he says hoarsely through the suit, armoured hands reaching for Steve’s thrashing form as he falls to his knees heavily. He holds him down, unsuccessfully at first because Tony doesn’t want to hurt him, and then more successfully when he pushes more power into his suit to withstand the force of Steve’s enhanced body thrashing.
A bright, overwhelming rush of hope flares in his chest, making him feel tight and stretched thin, and he says in a thin rush, “No, of course not, and if my vitals drop too low, you can pull me out to go through the Cradle again. There might be a bit of a fight, but Steve won’t hurt
It ebbs and Tony nearly collapses, heaving for breath and choking on his own whines, the sensations too much and yet not nearly enough. His body is like an electrified wire, his arms shaking so badly that he feels like he’s going to fall, and
He doesn’t dare move though, the teeth around the back of his neck unyielding and impossible to ignore, and he just doesn’t know if Steve’s so far gone and mutated that he won’t gouge out Tony’s jugular or attack him entirely. He just stays as still as possible, his entire body shaking and threatening to collapse completely, and he can feel hot tears streaming down his face and the point of his nose. He watches the leaves on nearby trees flutter in the gentle breeze and tries not to focus on the ache inside him, his hole throbbing from the abrupt intrusion and come leaking down his scraped thighs despite Steve’s prick still lodged inside.
The last thing he needs is a cardiac episode on top of everything else.
). He’s also aware that Steve’s a staunch advocate of it too – he’s done PSAs and preached on candid interviews and even once spoke in favour on a bill being passed in Congress about equal opportunity and non-discrimination no matter the time or place (Fox News had nearly shit themselves at that and still refused to even mention Captain America unless forced).
“I fought it the first time,” Tony interjects roughly, clears his throat, and continues in a calmer tone, “but if I don’t fight it this time—”
, and I am going to buy you time until they find a way to reverse this and bring you back to us, to

he’s already getting close again, the brutal thrusts along his swollen prostate unceasing and deliriously pleasurable. He curls his hands into fists against the grass and beats once at the ground, meeting Steve’s thrusts with abandon, and he can feel his prick swelling despite the fact that it’s untouched. Fuck, but he needs to touch himself, just a little, just to take the edge off and—no, he

” he hears Clint shout over the clamouring of fighting and the sound of Steve choking on something, something wet and horrible. The others echo Clint’s barking question through their own comms, and he hears Natasha give the order for someone to move to Steve’s location.
, and Tony can hear a strange sound through the shrill ringing in his ears that he doesn’t even realise is his own sobs until he eventually registers that he can’t breathe from the force of them. Steve whines, a hot and rough tongue licking at Tony’s damp neck and the back of his head, and finally –

if Steve continues to fuck him. Maybe if he was twenty or thirty years younger, sure, but he’s damn near fifty, and his mutilated heart and lungs won’t be able to take the strain even with Extremis.
Tony freezes.
All of the information had been clinical and dry, but Tony’d been able to read the undercurrent in the room, something they still weren’t telling him. For all of Tony’s faults, he’s always been good at reading people – well, except for Natasha – and he’d finally blown up, demanding the remaining piece of the puzzle being hidden from him.
While Tony’d been in the Cradle, Bruce and a team of biological agent specialists had gotten to work on Steve and the unknown agent in the syringe, while Clint and Natasha had worked on Johnson. The woman had been forthcoming about what had happened – apparently she was claiming that she’d ‘turned the great Captain America into a werewolf!’ in between bouts of hysterical laughter and sullen silence – but had been tight-lipped regarding the chemical composition of said substance. Bruce had tentatively come to a similar conclusion, though in more scientific terms, namely that Steve had been changed into a wolf-like creature that did admittedly run on some sort of lunar energy. According to Bruce, the substance that they’d been able to harvest heightened and waned during the moon’s cycles, and a day ago, during the new moon, Steve had mutated back into his usual self for a good fourteen hours, albeit in a great deal of pain and completely disoriented.

if it couldn’t be regulated. The only reason Steve wasn’t already dead was because of the serum, and Bruce was pretty damn sure that it was only delaying the inevitable, because if they kept Steve in isolation without addressing the underlying issues, he probably
After what feels like a year, as if from very far away, he registers that his body’s responding now that he’s untensed. It’s unsurprising, really, despite the situation – Tony has always loved getting fucked, has always loved getting held down and pseudo-forced into taking it as brutally as possible, and Steve’s prick is so unbelievably thick and long that it rakes against his nerve-rich insides and along his prostate with every punishing thrust inside. And he’s not going to lie, he’s always fantasised about Steve bending him over and making him take it, because it’s
Maybe it was the fact that Tony’d been the first warm body he’d gotten his prick into, leading to some sort of pheromone link, or maybe it was something else (and Tony’s not sure how to take that, and is avoiding thinking about it), but Steve had explicitly said that nothing else was making him respond. It was also clear from bloodwork that the lack of viable food and consummated rut when he was mutated was just increasing the overload of testosterone and vasopressin while tanking his serotonin and oxytocin, amongst other hormones and chemicals that Tony hadn’t recognised, and his vitals were becoming more erratic and life-threatening in the meantime. The stretches of starvation were pretty much destroying his muscles and tissues too, Steve looking thinner and diminished every single day, and he’d been noticeably weak and less thick with muscle when he’d finally mutated back to himself.
this, because he’d wanted something like this to happen in the comfort of the tower, his legs splayed wide so he could watch Steve’s face twist with need as he hammered his prick into Tony’s willing body, blond hair sticking to his forehead and looking so fucking gorgeous that it takes Tony’s breath away just imagining it. This, though, this is all wrong, and he wants it to be over already, wants
It takes him a long time to steady himself before he’s ready to address her though: he focusses on how his body’s feeling (tired and so sore he feels like he’s been thrown through a more than a few buildings, but pretty decent otherwise), how his mental capacity’s holding up (mind’s quick as usual, albeit heavy with residual sleep, and he doesn’t feel like he can’t remember anything), and if he’s on the verge of an anxiety attack or something. That last one is a bit of a doozy, but at least he can’t see Steve when he takes a look around his room, and he’s somewhat surprised to find himself in his own bedroom at the Tower rather than sequestered away on the eightieth floor, where the hospital level is. He wonders if that’s Natasha’s doing, or if the Avengers overall had decided to separate Steve and Tony by floors upon floors to stave off the inevitable carnage when Steve’s healthy enough to finally corner Tony.
Tony collapses as much as he can, arms curled up beneath him and his cheek pressed against the grass and dirt, and just

Tony’s brain is whirling with solutions and probabilities and hypotheses, trying to figure out what’s going on and how he’s going to get Steve safe and stabilised out of a mini warzone, as he replies through the tight ball of anxiety in his chest, “Cap’s down – some sort of fit. He needs to get out of here ASAP, and preferably to a hospital. I have no idea what the fuck is happening. Might be some sort of nerve agent?”

There’s a chorus of affirmatives and Tony bolts off, his flight erratic due to Steve’s powerful convulsions but ultimately quick, but he only makes it about ten kilometres – well outside of comms range unless JARVIS manually hooks into satellites – before everything goes completely insane at breakneck speed.

have escaped to corner Tony, and certainly wouldn’t be sitting on his bed patiently while Tony hovered just outside his room.
The dry facts and tentative suggestions had been the ultimate result of Tony waking up in the infirmary at the tower (three days gone due to heavy sedation as he’d been put through the Cradle for internal work as Extremis took care of the rest), immediately demanding to find out what in the hell had happened to Steve, scoffing at all the soft platitudes of

What I can say is that he’s not mad at you.” Tony snorts loudly, but Natasha continues evenly, “He’s not, actually. Confused and...I don’t think ‘disappointed’ is the right word, but he is upset that you didn’t tell him how you felt

That stops Tony in his tracks.
— He sobs out another scream when Steve manages to turn himself around, his entire lodged prick twisting inside him in a sloppy, agonising glide against his painfully oversensitive prostate and battered insides. Then, after what feels like a year of shuffling and manoeuvring, Steve finally settles, his tail intermittently batting against Tony’s side and arse as he calmly begins licking at his paws, resting on the boulder behind them languidly.
The second crest knocks the breath clean out of him, a sharp cry echoing through the trees and the small lake nearby, and there’s a high ringing sound in his ears now, deafening and shrill. He does fall this time, managing to jerk his left arm just enough land on his forearm rather than smashing his face into the grass, and Steve follows him downwards, his front paws scrambling at Tony’s waist to keep his arse in the air. The angle inside shifts, dizzyingly painful for two thrusts before Tony’s moaning out a garbled, “Oh
He drifts, the distant sounds of battle disappearing into the gentle sounds of the forest and lake around them, and he wonders vaguely how long it’s been. He wonders if the Avengers found the sceptre, if they’re en-route to Landstuhl, if they’ve already arrived to find that Tony and Steve aren’t even there, if they’ve sent out a hunting party yet. He’s lost the ability to care that Steve is perpetually inside of him, keeping his seed inside Tony’s aching and bloated body because he never lets his prick out, and it’s a detached thought that his teammates are going to see him like this, naked and battered and scratched up, dried blood and dirt caking the cuts in his skin and his stomach bulging from come. God knows that Natasha’s seen him in various stages of debauchery now, and both Clint and Thor won’t even bat an eye; Bruce might freak out, but it’s relatively safe to assume that he’s probably passed out by now, the strain Hulk takes on him enough to force him into a near-coma when he snaps back to size. Or maybe he’ll Hulk out again, which might be good because God knows that only the Hulk (or possibly Thor) could even hope to get Steve off Tony in between knots.

After his explosion, his heart monitor shrieking until Bruce had finally switched it off, they’d all sat in a charged silence until Rhodey had said point-blank, “He deserves to know, and even if you try to keep this shit from him, he’ll just find a way to escape and hack into everything anyway.”
Tony sinks back into his haphazard pile of pillows with relief, almost dizzy with it. His lifts his heavy arms and rubs his face with his hands, digging his fingers into the corners of his eyes to remove any lingering sleep, and mumbles, “Thank God, but you know that’s not what I’m asking.”
“It’s okay, Tony,” she says, far away to Tony’s ringing ears, slim fingers hesitating before they stroke through his sweat-dampened and dirty hair. “We’ve got you.”
Still, the fear for the situation and Steve’s condition is still bright and he
“I know,” she replies quietly, squeezes his hand one last time, and then turns away with an airy
His reaction is immediate: Steve’s entire body instantly loses all of the snarling aggression in his tense, starving body, eyes focussed solely on Tony’s slow advance, and he’s whining pitifully, panting heavily. The blue of his eyes is so familiar, despite being surrounded by golden fur, and Tony wonders if he’s reading it right, if he’s really seeing
Helen and the nurses edge toward Tony but Tony croaks out around his dry tongue, “Stay there...he’s...give him a minute.”
“Steve could

He sees Steve on his HUD earlier than he would with his own two eyes, and there’s definitely something wrong; Steve’s body is almost bulging and it’s clear that he’s seizing, mouth open in a silent scream behind the cowl. The shield is on the ground next to him, a smear of blood across the white star, and the person who’d clearly gotten on the wrong side of it is lying unconscious to the side, blood oozing from her head. Tony shoots off an electronic net to restrain the hostile indefinitely a few seconds before he slams onto the ground with a loud boom, and JARVIS is rattling off Steve’s vitals – heartrate skyrocketing, hypertension, temperature spiking dangerously – as he advances, panting with exertion and adrenaline.

done to Tony once he’d mutated, they’d taken that into account within controlled environments, introducing various genders of animals and humans that were in a variety of states, including menstruation, animal heat, and chemical arousal via SHIELD-issued cocktails. None of it had worked in the slightest, Steve attacking the reinforced barrier between cells in a blind rage, and then Steve himself had echoed that it hadn’t helped once he’d regained sanity and the normal amount of legs.
