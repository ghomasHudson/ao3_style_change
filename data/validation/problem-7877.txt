This broke it, and it made Tony awkwardly chuckle along. Simultaneously as an utter feeling of awkwardness filled the room. Fury however, was still urgent to continue.
Always hearing about the amazing Spider-Man running the streets of New York, Queens, and even Brooklyn as well. Which made the soldier feel happy and a bit relieved that someone is at least looking over his hometown in his absence. Truly, he wouldn't have wanted anyone else but Peter. He knew those streets better than any other Avenger.
When he arrived onto the penthouse floor, the first person he noticed was Steve. He was sitting quietly at the bar area, sipping on some whiskey. Being that it was late at night, and since Tony took the phrase fashionably late, a little too literal. Steve was the only soul sitting over at the bar area.
The Avengers are broken. Any inch of government involvement would have her back in prison, or maybe worse.
Seriously, how many more confessions can Tony hear in one day!
And so, he got up, dressed quickly, and was out on the bridge, watching the employees monitoring Shield's location. And also snickering at Agent Hill yelling at a co-worker for eating her breakfast that morning.
Luckily, she hit the man, with no eye, and slid to another crate. She peeled her head out again, with the other man nowhere in sight.
He literally broke the man. Broke his friendship, broke his trust... broke his heart. And that's truly one, of the very little, regrets Steve has in life. One that he hopes to fix in the near future.
They all nodded. For the first time, The Avengers felt like genuine friends. They all took a sigh of relief, and headed out. The team really was struggling to keep their mindsets straight. But the guilt, and grief were in rule, and none of them were fighting it. They all felt remorseful, Bruce even considered leaving. But Steve was not finished just yet. No one would've found that little girl, if it wasn't for them, well if it wasn't for Bruce. It was that determination, that the team kept their eyes open, and there ears listening. Steve really wanted to find some more people to help.
He sat in his car, nervous. Just seeing Tony from the window, felt odd. He turned his headlights off, so it wouldn't look so suspicious. But I mean there wasn't anything suspicious about him sitting in his car, and staring at Tony through his living room window. No, not. at. all.
"We need to just come clean about it to each other. That way, it will make us feel a bit better, or it will eat us alive, okay?" Steve continued.
"How long have you been in love with me, Tony?" Steve asked. The smile on his face was clearly an indicator that Steve may have already knew the answer.
Tony looked to the window in front of him. It had snowed, again. It's glossy, white surface covering the driveway; and the main road, further down.
Well, to him, Steve was just being his usual paranoid, protective self. He can remember many times, back at the compound, when he'd tell Tony to get some sleep, for Clint to take a shower after a mission. Even before all of that, when he’d tell Bucky to check himself for ticks or fleas since he and his family had 2 dogs. It was just in Steve's nature to be an almost 'mother hen' of sorts.
"You want to talk about it?" She said softly while wrapping her arms around him. He huffed a sigh of relief to finally be around someone he actually cared for. Tony swallowed, and turned to his girlfriend. He held her, and just stared into her soft eyes. They gazed for quite sometime, even swaying a bit.
And so, here they are. Natasha still waiting for Steve's response. "I need you to answer, or I'm tracing this number!". Her voice sounded weak, but with a hint of strength.
And so, Steve decided to do something to ease his and Tony's nerves. He rushed up to him, and gave Tony, a more proper, kiss. The brunette just stood there for a few seconds, confused, until he wrapped his arms around the man. It was a sincere embrace. No feelings attached. Steve was just being Tony's comfort.
"Sounds like him. How has he been?" Tony hesitantly asked that question. He didn't know where they were on the friend scale. But it was at least at, maybe, acquaintance.
"Okay, Stark. I will.".
Call it paranoia, or father's intuition. But to Steve, it was simply being prepared. Yet what was he preparing for you may ask. That's the issue, Steve couldn't tell you what for?
"Of course she did..." Tony huffed, "Sometimes I wonder about that woman-Wait? What about the restaurant?!".
"Done what?!"
"Steve..." Tony uttered.
Anyway, the story is coming to a close. And I’m very proud on how it’s grown since the first chapter. I hope you’ve enjoyed the story, at least this far! And yes, the next chapter is the artistically-put smut chapter. The longest chapter in the story.
After his last sentence, he could see Peter’s ever so smug smirk. Tony sat puzzled, until the realization of what he said, and how he put it, made Peter’s smirk clearer to understand.
'Dammit! I thought we installed that knocking mechanism!'
"I do."
Hope you Guys are doing well! Don’t forget to leave a comment, and a kudos!
It honestly made Natasha a little sad, that his response was so dry. Usually, Tony's tone with anything he would say, was always so full of life and his charming, spunky attitude.
Tony's eyes continually creased in slight pain. But against all odds, Steve continued, hoping the pain would subside soon. Like Tony kept saying. The two of them, at this moment, looked like an emotional painting of raw sexual desire.
Silence followed. But only for a moment, as Steve quickly responded. "I'm sorry."
However, one major downfall, that both Wanda and Vision absolutely despised, was the fact that they had to be discreet about aiding others in help. And yes, they could still help others in time of need.
"I'm okay, Ms. Potts, really. I just wanted to get up and walk around for a bit. The dream was just that, a dream." He stated softly.
"You know what I mean." Steve said amused, "We literally argued like cats and dogs earlier. I mean, I pretty much called you an arrogant coward. And all of a sudden we're rubbing each other's back as if we friends for years.".
"Well there's a lot of things you don't know.” Steve paused for a moment, “And honestly... I think it's time we bury the hatchet.".
Somebody that taught him so many things; that made him genuinely laugh several times. Mostly with his ever-so egotistical, and sometimes sensual, quips. Made him feel agitated beyond comprehension, on more than one occasion. Caused him to question his loyalty. Lead a team regardless of their views or morals.
"Don't leave me..." Steve ran over to him, "Tony, please know that I didn't do this to ruin our night. Everything from the dance, to... our kiss, and... I just wanted to leave it at that. That's why came in here."
"I'm going to sleep." He answered.
Hope your enjoying the story! Don’t forget to leave a kudos, and a comment!
The brunette swung their bathroom door, which led into the main foyer of the second floor. He spit the toothpaste out just in time to see their kids swing by the main banister, and rush down the main staircase leading to the first floor.
"Not without an explanation. Now come on, what's with the running?" Steve sat a couple of plush toys down and placed his hands on his hips. "You know the rule: No running—"
It knocked Steve out of his thought process. He looked to the grief-stricken woman. She was smiling to the super-soldier, but he knew Pepper was also trying to be strong.
"Where's daddy?" Morgan asked softly.
The landlord was putting away the documents that Steve had already signed when he got up from the table. Steve broke away from Tony’s eyes, to politely stand as well. Richard smiled at the super-soldier, extending his hand for Steve to shake it. The soldier took his hand and shook it firmly.
"I'm glad your following in your fathers footsteps. But I want you to be doing this Steve, because you want to."
The two battles that occurred that day, were fought with every strength that both sides could bring. But Thanos had something up his sleeve. An infinity gauntlet, that powered with the 6 infinity stones could grant the Mad Titan anything he desired.
As he's been doing a lot of lately, which was simply out of character for him. And yet, he can't seem to figure out why. It's almost like he's a constant ticking time bomb. And he despised every time it occurred. It made the soldier think back to the other times he’s yelled at the kids.
Steve sighed again, "I don't know, Bruce. I feel it's not my place to say anything without Tony here.".
Once there, his headspace was clear enough for Tony to realize how lucky he was to have Steve. Little moments like earlier, make Tony think back on how Howard treated him. And how his fears of becoming just like his father were always in the back of his mind.
“Hey, hey, I actually like this shirt!” Steve complained.
Steve was a wreck once more. But he once again, wiped his tears. He looked back to the machine and gave a relieving sigh. He had it now.
"Okay, your fine." He surmised.
"Alright, alright, guys. I get it. I'm sorry for not calling you guys more. I was being an idiot." Steve smiled softly. He was so happy to hear their voices after so long.
Tony took a seat next to the super-soldier. “Who all came?”.
Tony just stood there awkwardly. He was hoping for a more professional answer. But an 'Alright Then' was fine enough for him.
"Nat can handle the Top, I got the Bottom." Maria joked.
He hoped that it would ease the situations climatic outcomes. It did; for a moment though. The team looked to their companions, in victory. The weapons were destroyed, whatever that energy source is no longer accessible. And hopefully, any Hydra agents left we're done for.
He walked over to the brunette and placed a kiss on his forehead. Tony was about to go on, but Steve placed a finger on his lips.
"No you idiot, I mean what the fuck do you mean?" The agent stated in his thick accent.
Tony felt the desire to attach this to his hand and fly around to do some target practice. Or even to just to see the vitals of the machine. As he treated the suit as if it was living, and breathing. This sent a little pain to his heart.
Steve started his search for the missing blonde, but was completely overtaken by the sheer beauty of the landscape. He was used to tall buildings, and scruffy alleyways. 'No, come on Rogers. Find Pepper first, look at scenic backyard later!' He thought. Taking one look around, he instantly spotted her.
"Do we need to know what it means?" Natasha interjected.
"Wait for what, Steve?"
The back door opened to the raging sounds of snowfall before all went quiet when Steve closed the door behind him.
"Me?" Tony teased with an ever so smug smile.
"There's a landline in the office, but it's not allowed to be used by customers." She stated with no emotion.
Everyone knows that the Avengers are broken. And that 'Iron-Man' and 'Captain America' are seriously in shambles, in terms of friendship. However, if they could put their issues past them, they could catch Hydra before anything more sinister would take place.
echoed throughout the room and into her ears.
Steve now felt his composure dismantle. Tony's comment hit a nerve, a nerve that would blow into a fiery rage, that even he couldn't believe it.
The two men released from their embrace. Which left Tony speechless, and a bit dazed. The soldier smiled once again, for probably the 100th time tonight.
Nat replied with a smug smile, and hit to the back. Tony returned the smug smile, and walked up to the hurting Captain.
Steve just stood silently. 'Why am I not saying anything?!' He thought.
"Wow! Have some compassion!" Nat exaggerated.
"Why are you apologizing?" Her tone was soft and comforting.
'Did he just say 'friend'? OMG! Captain America just said I'm his friend! Okay, Okay, Okay, just play it cool, Kamala! Play it cool!' She contemplated eagerly.
Steve snickered a little and began to face the crowd, "That bad, huh?".
"Well, that's not all true. I did already hurt you. Through, Thanos, Peter, and the whole Accords situation," Steve mumbled.
"Yes, you guys I'm okay! I'm honestly glad to see you all again." Steve scooted closer to the edge of the cushion, "So enough about me, how have y'all been?".
More questions slipped from the teen’s mouth. It was almost like word vomit. Yes, the battle in Germany was surely a conversation starter, but now this! This, is every gossip girl, news reporter, and TMZ photographer’s wet dream!
‘I really don’t know if I should do this? There are so many things wrong with it, but so many good. God, I... I just wish he was here.’ Steve really wanted the confirmation. Anything really could be a sign at this point.
The soldier smirked amusingly as he headed back into the ship. Hoping he remembered where Tony kept his secret stash of liquor. Even if he couldn't get drunk, he at least was helping Tony out.
Tony huffed in annoyance, and continually called to the guy. He finally got Steve's attention after a good nudge to the soldier's thigh brought his eyes back to him.
He was throwing his problems on someone else's land. And that just rubbed him the wrong way. The kids would tell him it's fine, but they knew better. Steve wasn't going to let this go, even if he wanted to.
He chuckled and gave her a soft kiss. He then, laid his hand on her stomach and rubbed it softly. Even though it would be a hassle, he did want a 3rd kid. She did too, but they both never gotten around to discuss it yet.
Honestly, it was like this with all the kids he’s recruited over that period. But they all grew to love Steve. And knew when it came to playtime or any recreational activity. They knew the rules: No playing at night, No talking to strangers, and No playing by the river.
"But that is where it will make me happy." Tony joked.
He could forgive the events of Germany that much was true. Siberia on the other hand, might take a little longer though. Too much internal pain for that one to be completely let go of. Or really to be dealt with.
“As soon as you let me!” Steve joked.
"You want to talk about your dream?" She asked calmly.
"Uh-he-he, how... do you feel," he began, "about... moving away.". The crease was now sharper than ever.
They seemed to've lost their minds. Which is honestly the nicest way to put it. Screaming, running in circles, cursing the skies above. They all believed the end had come.
It had been a year now since she talked to the philanthropist. She didn't even know how to word her response. Nevertheless, she found a phone, dialed his number, and waited. Thankfully she knew of the ex-playboy's number from a few years back, and ironically didn't think she needed to have it memorized.
"Nah. I've had a little too much eggnog for my liking."
"Sam gave me a couple of hints. You guys are also a little obvious. You stare at him constantly. And I mean
Steve, Natasha, Sam, and all the other remaining Avengers (Including Thor, and Bruce), fought alongside T'Challa, and his kingdom, against Thanos's armies arriving in the African country, Wakanda.
"For something being 'just that', it surely has left you and Tony flushed." Natasha quipped.
Steve just looked around quietly, before finding a clock on the mantelpiece. It was 7:15. He then looked back to Tony, who was now just completely confused.
"Please! I think it's going to collapse. I've been here for hours-no ones came!" The girl babbled.
"Thank God. I thought I was going have to do that all night." Tony confessed with an exaggerated sigh.
Steve laughed softly. He looked back to the yard and kept his eyes there. Another pause befell them. This time Bucky was the one to break the silence.
Whatever it was, Tony still said it. And he tried to talk his way out of it. But it still occurred. And yet, the philanthropist still wonders. Wonders on how life would be if Pepper and he did break up, before the accords, and he was alone all that time during his paranoia stages.
Resting on his elbows, Steve shivered a little while also clearing his throat in the process. He grabbed the glass of tap water next to his bed and took a small sip. The water soothing the typical scratchy throat that was annoying to the blonde. The dream, or really nightmare, fading away from memory.
If you were to ask Steve about what he did each day, this would be the gist. This, was his day to day, morning routine. Get up, give some beautiful affection to Tony and the kids, get the kids dressed, head outside and let the dog loose to roam the property; and finally, check the grounds with a final walk through the boathouse.
Kamala beamed and shrieked with happiness when she saw it. So much so, that Tony could hear her shrieking response from the other side of Chimera, "Oh! That's so cool! We're matching hairstyles!".
Steve looked to his friend, and once again became lost in his head. He didn’t know what to do.
"I understand..." She croaked. Even though she didn't want to. She knew of his struggle to keep his relationship with Pepper, whole. But maybe her plan or reasoning for Tony to help, mostly comprised of his and Steve's past. A part of her wanting their past to be the reason he comes back to them, to Steve.
"Listen guys, we just had a moment. I was struggling mentally, and he thought that would calm me down. And it did." Tony continued, "We've already discussed it, and he and I know it wasn't anything more than a simple mistake.".
Tony looked to the ‘Spider-Man’ and instantly felt pity for the boy. He knew that Peter was intrigued. Maybe a little too intrigued, but still, he was a kid. A kid who just learned two of his biggest idols, are now enemies, and basically tried to almost kill each other in blinded rages.
"CEO stuff. The usual, you know. And for that first part, I kind of-well not kind of, missed you guys." Tony relented.
“I just… don’t want to.” She finally looked at him. A single tear flowing down her left cheek.
Sure, he could text the others of his new home. But like the many times before, he knew that his friends wouldn't even have time to come and see it. Especially with everything going on in their lives, at the moment. Regardless, he still sent them a text about it, just in case one day they were able to stop by.
And this wasn't the first time that the teenager had been irresponsible. Earlier that week, Tommy was tasked to watch Tina & Annie, while Steve went to Ziggy's recital. Needless to say, when the two returned home, they found the place in ruins. It seems Tommy thought the idea of watching the girls meant locking them in their room, while he stayed downstairs having a little 'get together' with some friends.
"Okay, Okay. No PDA, Ms. Romanov!" Tony exaggerated.
First looking into the kitchen, Tony was nowhere in sight. Yet a shuffling noise and a scream of pain/embarrassment from another room, made Steve chuckle.
Not a simple peck on the cheek, no he made sure his mark was on Steve's lips. Steve was just left highly confused. But it wasn’t about the kiss itself. No they’ve already had their first kiss, through their ‘situations’. No what dumbfounded Steve was the fact that Tony was kissing him in public.
She sat thinking to herself for quite a while. Looking through every type of possibility of them leaving together could cause. Then re-evaluating it, with the other possibility.
Tony takes a finger and playfully bops one of the ornaments. He does this to a few more ornaments before a sound from upstairs catches his attention. The former avenger heads to the other side of the living room and crosses the threshold back into the main foyer. Turning off the lights, and fireplace whilst doing so.
Now that Thanos & his army had been dusted, and everything with the accords situation had sorted itself out. Sorted itself out meaning that Tony had persuaded the remaining senators to discontinue the Accords after the blip.
Tony and Annalise were down the hallway and walking into the front bedroom when Steve had finally noticed their obvious distance. He walked closer to the two and finally took an interest in what she was saying.
The three men giggled in response. With Tony continually staring at the soldier. Steve looked back at him and the two locked eyes for a moment.
“Look, you're just still, in like, repercussions of what happened. You feel bad. You want to fix things,” Sam acknowledged, before Steve cut him off.
Steve sent his middle finger up in response, but before he could respond, Pepper interjected. "Maybe. All he apparently has to do is talk with my spouse."
Steve of course apologized for his odd behavior, before the two gave the goodbye pleasantries. Annalise did try to persuade the soldier just for another walkthrough, yet the super-soldier declined it again politely. And the duo were back on the road, this time heading to Virginia.
"Not now Babe."
Tony went to grab the alert button, only to realize that it's 3 in the morning. No one’s awake.
"You too?! Well, I'll be damned, Captain America gets nightmares." Tony drawled softly.
"Sorry, It just came to me. Um, how about, we just... skip... the reunion. And we can just do something else." He stated cautiously.
Wanda kept quiet momentarily, before speaking back up, “Look, I know that you and Steve want us to be around, but I’m telling you we’re tired of it. I’m tired of this. I just want to go somewhere where I’m not perceived as this... this thing that killed people a year ago.”
"Hey, Rogers. What's up?" Steve could see, and hear, Tony's relief when he turned around to face him.
Yet, when Steve finally got the hang of it. Tony will admit, it was a strange feeling at first. He was never on the receiving end when it came to sex. But after some time, Steve using this window to be as gentle as possible. Only moving when Tony said he could.
"A contractor from New York was chosen to help. Goes by the name, Adrian Toomes. The city and I chose him just after the battle. I was going to tell you guys, today.".
Wanda sat quietly, yet felt herself trying to answer. But her words were strangely mute. What did Natasha want? And what is this urgent piece of information, that she so desperately wants to tell her?
"That's the thing though Pepper. Did I really? I could've picked a number of things to help Tony. But apparently, our ‘situation’ was the only way." He added.
It was dark, once they drove up to the abandoned warehouse. This apparently to Stark, 'warehouse' to him, is a giant-ass factory to them.
was enough.
Then without warning, or thought really. Steve brought his hand slowly to the device. His fingers grazing across the metal. It's buzzing sensation, vibrating the soldier's palm.
The brunette placed another kiss on the blonde's lips and reassured him that he's fine.
Tony felt a chuckle leave his mouth. He was, albeit a bit too much, fascinated at the super soldier’s past. Sure Steve and him haven’t had the greatest friendship, but it was growing, morphing, changing. And it was surely, due to this moment.
Once everything was situated, for the time being, Tony ordered the guys some pizza. The men conversed with each other for the remainder of the evening.
He was breathing so that gave the blonde some comfort. The longer Steve looked, he confirmed that there was nothing to suggest for Tony to be in a state of indisposition or stress.
The philanthropist finally shifted his feet to the super-soldiers picture. Steve looked the most changed out of the group. The pain came back to Tony’s chest, which confused him even more as to why it was there.
Steve walked in cautiously, and slowly. Noticing Tony's reaction made him feel as if he was foreigner in a different land. He paid Steve no attention, as he knew why he was here. And honestly, he didn't want to feel like a poster boy for the NAMI foundation. None the less, Steve still walked eerily up to him. The silence between them was starting to thicken. Their ears began to feel clogged with it.
"He said he couldn't. Mostly because of Pepper. I tried to convince him. But he wouldn't budge-yet... I... also understood where he was coming from.".
“Oh, okay. I’m coming down!” Steve followed Bucky down to the trucks. Locking the door to his old life and moving forward with the one awaiting him in Virginia.
Even with Steve’s letter afterward. He didn’t expect Steve to apologize, and be truthful about it. But at the fact, that Steve would still be there for the Avengers, for him.
Sam dove onto the man and tried his hardest to lift the agent off his friend. The added help, was all Steve needed to lift the man from him, and his wound, and toss them back like a rag doll.
"Tony... Listen, I-We have a situation" She mumbled, before The philanthropist interrupted.
Thor would head back to Asgard, to deal with some family matters, while Hulk would be M.I.A., during all these events. Leaving Nat in a continuous state of worry.
"He's asleep, honey. A friend is here too, though." Pepper didn't really know why she added that last bit of information.
"I guess those Cumbrae Rock Oysters decided that toilet water was easier to swim in." Sam teased.
Why wasn't anything happening this time?
Tony and Nat waved to the agent before he disappeared around the corner. Tony eventually stood up just afterwards, and told Nat goodnight. Although he stumbled with the response as it was only 1 in the afternoon.
Sadly, Tony had to quickly retreat to breathe. Whatever Steve was doing, it was surely knocking the breath out of him. He began to take sharp inhales, as his 'top' companion began to try and experiment with some irregular patterns to his hip thrusting.
Steve thought profoundly.
"Oh, Come on, Tony..." Steve doubted.
Steve lifted his middle finger in response, with an exaggerated gasp, from Sam and Nat, following that.
Their simple, comforting, embrace from before suddenly became an electrifying act of desire and lust. Steve could no longer ignore the passion he feels for Tony. Even if it wasn't love, it was their way of comfort. And at least this time, they weren't wincing in pain.
Sorry for being a little late, and for the short chapter. I was really trying to see how a chapter with this duo would work. But anyway here it is. Hope y’all are enjoying the story!
Steve had a feeling Tony would end up knowing somehow. But he had a very good assumption at what shithead knew first. In fact, two shitheads to be a bit more precise.
He gazed back over to Steve and noticed that he hadn't moved at all, besides his head. Or changed his expression for that matter. This mutual feeling must be really affecting him.
“He’s married, Buck.” Steve added defeatedly, “It would be wrong now if I even tried anything. And I don’t want to do that to him. He’s got a family, a daughter. The last thing I want to be to him is a homewrecker.”.
Familiar, however, was an understatement when the group saw him for the party. If you've known him as long as the other Avengers have. You'd know that Steve wasn't a fan of dressing up. It gave him a prideful feeling. But when it came to a social gathering, he knew he had to.
Later, after discussing the financial situation of the home. It turns out that Steve got a stroke of luck.
"Same old, Same old..." Bruce looked a little hesitant to say anything else.
Once the trio reached the doors, the energy blasts now were mere inches from them. It was consuming the factory, in an electrifying wave of sorts. And then, it collapsed on it itself, almost to a small bubble. Which in turn, exploded in a blue fire. Sending the trio onto their faces. The explosion barely missing them by a hair fracture.
"Earlier... I had bumped into her in town. We talked for a little bit, well me and Nat did. And I told her everything. Of course she was hurt that you or me didn't say anything, and by the fact that we did it as well. But I had to tell her. We both know, that it would've eaten us up if we kept that a secret all this time.".
"Seriously! We've faced worse situations than this. Like, why can't we think of a good plan." He stated while frustratingly shoving some fries in his mouth.
"Dang it! I suppose I can check to see if there's any on the internet." She added. Now heading back to her room to go test her theory.
"Alright, I guess I'll start." Steve stated.
This brings us to the second reason, surprisingly happening, just yesterday. He had all his things packed and ready to go. No help was needed there since most of his things were lost after the accords. When, the movers he ordered had, most bafflingly, canceled their appointment for him as the company was backed up with requests and jobs?!
“You alright Tony?”.
"Hmph? Oh, yes. I was just... glancing around.".
Knowing that his presence was obviously no longer necessary, the super-soldier walked outside, feeling stupid, horrible, and defeated.
"An Audi E-Tron, I didn't think you'd be interested in these newer cars?" Tony admitted.
"This bedroom here is well-lit, well insulated, and the carpet has just been cleaned and refurbished." She stated happily.
As they reached the bottom floor, they were holding their stomachs in laughter. They were certainly not going to hold back tonight. Finally holding their composures, the group got a taxi, and off they went. Slightly putting their jokes aside, they were hoping that they were wrong. As an affair like this, would be with epic consequences.
Steve noticed the brunette's strange behavior. Now he knew something was up. He leaned further to hopefully get Tony's attention. Nothing. The blonde knew now, that he was going to have to say something.
When he, Tony, Tony Stark, finally had opened his eyes. The world seemingly opened up like a flower. The blinding light of the sun losing intensity, with each second.
"Yeah, yeah. We'll be there, Steve. Where’s it at again?".
{A Few Hours Pass}
She and Steve walked into the conference area, and defeatedly sat. Opposite of each other, and not saying a word to themselves. They couldn't come up with words, sentences, or just plain grammar. To at least try and discuss their situation. But it was simple. They lost.
Steve smiled, and he nodded his head.
"Hmph? Oh, yeah. I was just remembering something stupid." The soldier replied.
Tony, Peter, a few others who called themselves 'The Guardians of the Galaxy', and a surgeon turned 'wizard' known as Doctor Strange; fought Thanos directly on his home planet, Titan.
Their embrace ends, and Tony exits with a redder face than Nat's hair color. Steve keeps his smile, but loses it once he thinks of his plan. 'I'm killing two birds with one stone with this. I have to help, and protect those who need it. Who am I, if I don't?' Steve thought. He found his suit, and threw it on. He was going to take a journey. A journey back to New York, unauthorized of course, to help the people of New York. Who most now, don't have homes or cars or anything. And by heading back, this could give Tony the chance to let go of his 'schoolgirl crush' on him. This wasn't Tony's fault, but it has to be done.
He was struggling. Steve didn't know what he was going to say. Or really, how to say it. Or how to even bring it up. But here he was, speeding down a desolate road, a few miles from the nearest rest stop. Completely having an inner battle.
"Okay... Just tell me when it is something to worry about." Steve attested before unwrapping himself from Tony and sat upward.
"I wanted to ask you a favor. If that's alright?" Steve's voice was calmer than it ever was.
"Nat, I can still help over here. I have some clever people who can help track them down." He assured the Russian.
“Well, this has been fun!” Tony stated. His expression however, seemed to change from amused to urgent. “I know we’d say we would skip it, but truthfully I think it would be best, for both of us, if we went.”.
Tony doesn't remember how his dream began, but he definitely remembers where it ended up. It was hazy, but he knew it was at the Stark tower. Yet it looked different, as if it was a completely new building. Walking along the empty corridors, slowly and bit cautiously. He could see the pictures along the walls, swaying left to right.
He really wanted just to apologize, buy her a stuffed bear, again; kiss her till no ends meet; but here he was a week later. No bear, no apologies, and no kisses. Simply following Pepper’s wishes to keep their distance.
More agents began to swarm the trio, as they became a trifecta free-for-all. Sam throwing some good punches, Steve using his kicking skills, and Natasha using her leftover electroshock weapons. Also known as her 'black widow bite'.
The teenager thought it over and hesitantly agreed. It wasn’t until a few weeks of living there that she was beginning to feel comfortable. Since then, Steve & Ziggy’s relationship had definitely grown. So much so that Ziggy sometimes calls Steve, “Dad.”.
"And we think we've figured it out," Bruce interjected. "So we've all collectively come up with a few solutions for you.".
"You know you could've said something to us about this. Or at least
"You're close there, Rogers." Tony walked inside.
"Yeah, I'm good. Why do you ask, Lovebird?" She joked.
knew.".
And finally, he held the photo of Steve Rogers in his hands, ready to part from it. Yet his hands did not move. They just stayed in place, and softly grasped the picture.
Unlike most people, Kamala was very observant of her surroundings. She could see from the minute she laid eyes on Steve, that he wanted to dance. And when she discovered his cautious eye gazing. The little avenger just put two and two together.
Tony felt his mouth curve into a smug smile. "Well then..."
But even losing Peter really took a toll on him, and his friendship with Steve. He pretty much deleted those 'good times' he had with Cap. It didn't mean he hated him all this time. But he certainly couldn't look at him the same way.
Finally, one of the employees brought a half-assed version of a Moscow Mule. Tony thanked him, and sipped upon his beverage, like a kid with his juice box. Clint took a smile to this, along with Thor. They found it odd, but still quite funny. Only Tony would consider a drink at a time like this. Nat and Bruce were still trying to chow down on some hardly covered, cheesy nachos. Needless to say, Shawarma's would not get a strong review on Yelp.
He tittered. Falling back onto the pillow, Tony relished in the memory of last night's promiscuous events. His right hand gently laid above his head, while the other, on his bare stomach.
"Please at least know that I was only wanting to do it because you and I both know are ways of comfort are rather strange." Steve joked. He hoped that it would relieve the tension. But it didn't. He already screwed it up, so why make things worse.
However, a grin suddenly appeared on Steve's face, when he felt his nose hit the man's brown hair. Tony's explanation of it being, a nice little blend of a modern quiff style with a pompadour, to smooth the edges of the front. Oh, how Tony loved to seem stylish.
Clint and Nat did their best in doing CPR, but it was once again, futile. Bruce stood behind them, softly whimpering to himself. Behind Bruce, were a shell shocked, Tony and Steve, who looked utter distraught. It was both their fears coming true. They both just stared, at her lifeless eyes. Steve felt his tears flow, while Tony's eyes were red and puffy. However, Tony wasn't much of a crier, his expression was filled with angry tears. 'Why didn't I get here in time! She's dead. She's dead, and it's... because of us. We were the careless ones that day!' He thought angrily.
“I mean, as long as you guys stay out of sight. And when we need you, you have to be there.” Nat insisted.
"Well, it was good knowing you guys." Natasha joked.
Steve sighed from the kitchen, letting the girls deal with the matter on their own.
Not once, but twice. 'He knew. He knew... and yet didn't tell me.'. Tony was lost in his mind. The diner really did bring back a lot of memories, good or bad. But they all correlated to his and Steve's friendship.
"What?" The agent responded confused.
The super-soldier seemed very distant, which kind of confused Tony for a moment. The brunet waited for another response or at least an indication that he was invested in Tony's attempt at a conversation. Yet when Steve didn't answer or even acknowledge his presence anymore. Tony huffed loudly, catching Steve's attention again.
"What do you need?" Tony asked matter of factly. He knew that if she called, they needed him.
Even now, as he and his long-lost friend stood beside him in the Chimera's war room. The brunet didn't feel satisfied in the slightest. And that's what worried him most.
"Are you alright?" The philanthropist asked.
'Ha! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!'
'It could go wrong? What if I mess everything up? What if I don't?' Steve stood upon the porch, that once belonged to an egotistical philanthropist, puzzled and in-thought. Yet, now that mahogany colored porch and it’s beautiful home we’re owned by his wife and offspring. ‘Pepper and Morgan‘ he continually thought. Oh god, he didn't even think about them?!
"Скажите нам, куда направляются ваши грузы ?!" Steve demanded in his best Russian accent.
"And I want you to stay." Before the brunette could protest, Steve passionately kissed him.
Instantly though, he squashed those raw feelings down. He was here, with his family, and that's all that mattered. This, This right here was his life now. And that was enough for him.
"Alright, we all know that our work in New York was successful. But are mission isn't finished." Fury began. Everyone knew what he was getting at. New York was decimated. They saw the destruction. But Fury's continuation was not what they expected.
'You gotta eat, when you gotta eat...' Sam would tell him. Just before he would make his trip to the bathroom. Except his version of food poisoning was more towards destroying the toilet. And yes, this has happened before, but usually not through delivered food.
Tony’s contagious laugh followed, and it was honestly admirable to Steve. Who knew two years could really make a person appreciate the little things of their companions.
He found the light switch; well-found is a stretch, he stumbled and fell onto it. Once the illumination of the main living room light, Peter felt a smile grow on his face.
Vision was neutral about the entire situation. No matter what side he was standing on, he'd never let anything harm Wanda. He... loved her.
She turned to Sam, who was now sitting where Fury was, "You wouldn't possible know the whereabouts of Spangles and Shell-head?".
Mostly because, of what happened on Halloween last year. Tony woke up before the chickens cock-a-doodle-doo in the morning. He snuck under the bed, and attempted to shake it violently. I say attempt, as it wasn't violent enough to wake her. So he simply pushed the mattress of the bedframe.
That is until one of the bots suddenly whirled on with terrifying speed. Its body now hovering over the tub and seemingly pulling up an arm repulsor. Its trajectory was for one Kamala Khan.
"Yeah."
"Yeah, I guess it does." Steve cleared his throat, "Anyway, it was a windy, cold night. And the ship was smacking into waves left and right. Constantly being thrown off-balance.".
"Okay... Okay. But I get to pick the place!" She relented.
He was looking off to certain parts of the house, not daring to look at Tony. As it would've shattered any attempt at keeping his composure.
"And anyway, he's getting me a drink."
Another secret facility, that Hill had no trouble in reminding the team of. The scrimmage didn't take up too much time, and with Kamala there, they had a lot more assistance than they thought they needed.
The soldier simpered. His eyes glancing around to the others in the room. Eventually landing on Kamala, who was still watching from the eggnog station. Smiling and holding a thumbs up from her vicinity.
Once up though, he usually used this time to reflect, but could feel the wave of nausea hit him like a bullet. And so, he flew to the bathroom in a quick haste.
“No, I want to talk... here,” Steve uttered.
It didn't take Tony long to figure out what she was talking about, "Yes, and No."
"Well, would I have called you guys down, if I wasn't?"
Steve and Sam knew that making themselves sick for food that was found in garbages, so that they wouldn't be spotted, and for Nat to be the only one heading out for actual food, was enough for them. And plus, their stealth-like skills are not as advanced as Natasha's.
Steve then leaped a bit of faith and had decided to call Sam and Bucky. Noticing from before, that the two did not read his last text message about the move in general. He knew they were busy, but Steve didn't expect them to pick up. They were sweet, at first, before the two began to scold Steve at how stupid he was sounding with his excuses at not talking to them!
makes me feel my age." Steve smiled.
" It said before planted a finger on Steve's head.
It was honestly breathtaking to say the least. If Tony had to bury some secrets anywhere, he’d pick this spot from now on.
"Nat, we need you! We here over on the right side of the Market." Sam stated in the comms. Steve and him met in the middle, and instantly began fighting the guards already there.
Through all this though, she just smiled and looked to her son with delight. She was proud of the boy-Man, he had became. Her envious feelings were starting to cloud her for a moment, till the young man finally had spoke.
So it looks like Steve doesn’t care for the 5-second rule. Tony apparently doesn’t know how to finish a milkshake. And the two fools are apparently ditching the reunion. Comment down below where you guys think there wanting to go?
Sam and Natasha noticed it, but ignored it in silence.  She grabbed the bread, and sat two pieces on a plate, ready for the toaster. While Sam took a bowl and began pouring cereal into it.
Tony smiled back and sat down next to Morgan. He wanted them to have a nice family breakfast. And that was perfectly fine with Pepper.
Steve just eerily walked up to the duo and smiled uneasily. He really was on edge after the whole Hydra/Bucky situation. The trauma of the last 2 years was really weighing on him. But he needed to stop, reflect, and forget. Because, for a man out of time, that's all he has done.
The two then wrestled back & forth, scuffing into the main foyer. Where they both bumped into Steve, who looked at them with an annoyed expression. Annie was the first to flee, not wanting the blonde to take the doll. The soldier followed after her.
"I... uh..." He mutters. His words were incoherent and he felt his throat get tight. He couldn't get sentences to form. All he could think about was Natasha whispering into Pepper's ear the mischievous act of him and Steve. And it made his blood run cold. He loves Pepper. He wouldn't do anything to hurt her. But he also can't control his urges either. When he feels something should happen, he goes with it. Natasha can see his expression of horror only grow, so she finally lets up some of the suspense.
"And You know that I couldn't be there that day! How many times do I have to apologize for that! I'm sorry, for not helping with Thanos! I'm sorry, for not being there! And I'm sorry, that We lost!".
The blonde told Peter he'd think about it, considering he already had four other kids living with him at this point. The two eventually said their goodbyes and went their separate ways for the time being.
"Wait, Wait, Wait... Tony this was..." Steve uttered.
“I’m sorry, I’ll be quiet.” Peter relented.
Sam took his finger and threw it down. In which, Steve instantly remembered himself doing that to Tony. The somber-ness filled his expression once more.
Steve was just so happy. He didn’t even know where to start! The feeling of just walking in here on moving day, itching at him aggressively.
Still, annoyance or not, Pepper always grew a little excited when Natasha would call. And right now, she needed a friend to talk to.
Nat felt that promiscuous mind of hers kick in, and she knew that two men 'staying behind', meant one of two things. One, they are dishing out their dirty laundry. However, the city is not on fire, nor is there any signs of assembling, so then it must be number two. Which deals with several methods of sexual pleasure.
Even then, it was always something he dusted off from the closet, nothing fancy, just simplistic. So you can imagine everyone's reaction when he came down in an expensive denim Capstone Italian jacket with some denim pants; a red turtleneck underneath, black suede shoes, and a midnight leather belt with an encrusted buckle in the middle.
Steve laughed as the other giggled along. Kamala just cheesed from ear to ear.
"How come your flustered?"
"Nice story, buddy."
He picks up a rusted shovel and once again feels himself daydreaming back to the tower. Back in the lab, drawing at anything that caught his attention. Sometimes taking a peek at Tony working on god knows what.
Tony gave him a warm smile, and comfortingly sat back. He looked to his companion again, as he was still drifting off from nostalgia. The iron-man sat for a moment, before not surprisingly, got out of the car.
“Judging by your lack of ‘Hello there’ I’m guessing this isn’t happy news.” He articulated.
"Your quite certain, that it's these people." Thor asks.
With a quick spin around, he miscalculated the direction of the turn, and simply ran off the road and onto a dirt path. The car halting to a rough stop near a few trees covered in strands of Spanish moss. Tony cursed again when the two recovered from the severe whiplash they just suffered through.
"What do you want me to do Tony?! I literally destroyed any inch of sanity you had left, because of my own selfish desires! I'm not going to stay here, if all I'm going to do is make you cry, and confused, and question your marriage...".
With every sentence, the agent ejected from his mouth, Steve could detect a few words from each. And he pretty much found out what the madman was preaching.
"Your welcome. But seriously though, if we ever sleepover at your house again. I'm sleeping on the couch, and the couch only." Bucky playfully pointed to him.
“That’s alright with me. And I hope there isn’t a next time either.”.
“Well, Yea. You and-” Steve stopped himself realizing the name he was going to say. It’s funny how right now he was actually wanting one of Tony’s side comments, quips, teases, really anything.
Her thoughts kept her company, as she headed back to their motel and sat in Steve's bedroom. Of course, trying to hide the fact that she was slowly sinking into herself. Thinking, and thinking, she rubbed one of her hands around her aching left shoulder.
"Well it isn't just us two, Tony left to the bathroom a few minutes ago." Sam acknowledged, "And I thought us four meeting here would be nicer. You know before the festivities begin.".
This was it. Steve opened his car door and sat one foot on the ground. He took another deep breath. His other foot hit the ground a little too harshly. Another deep breath. Now he was out of the car.
With this revelation, Pepper was about to head back inside, and confront her husband for the truth. She was so tired of him acting like he’s fine, when in reality, he wasn’t. But that was the old her. And she knew Tony wouldn't open up to her.
"You don't think I know that, Tony! I didn't want to confuse you or make you chose between me and your family. I guess I just wanted to... help you? Shit, I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore!".
The other man ran down a nearby passageway on the left side of the market. And so, she followed in hot pursuit.
Annie, convincingly, went belligerent. Shouting & crying profusely. Even kicking her feet around, until she noticed Tina wasn’t looking anymore.
His life has always been this up and down roller coaster. He knew that just leaving the Avengers wouldn't solve his problem, but it would better to just forget it. Holding his head, Tony breathed heavily, and softly began to cry.
"Tony?" She began.
So for this chapter, it was more towards Bruce and Natasha‘s relationship, that honestly needs to be explored more. Don’t worry the main fandom is still Steve and Tony. But we all know what happens after Ultron. So I kind of have to fill the gap with something? Right?
Steve chuckled in remembrance.
A few more pecks and the two finally separated. Their faces flushed as if they were both teenagers again.
Steve thought.
So Steve, rightfully so, picked her up. Leading to Annie to just start kicking and screaming the entire time. Whilst scratching him so violently along his back that she drew blood in spots. The soldier ignored her and carried Annie up to her room. Eventually telling the young girl sternly that she'd be sitting there in the dark, with no privileges of any kind until she changed her behavior.
For the rest of the ride to Peter's apartment, it was silent. But as he opened the door, the teen looked back to his mentor, “It was nice to talk to you Mr. Stark.”.
"You don't want to waste all that water, Cap. Others need a shower too."
The teenager scoffed, then wiped her nose and sat up straight looking away momentarily. She then brought her gaze back to the super-soldier. This time her eyes were more like daggers. Before the soldier could elaborate further, Ziggy had cut him off.
"Yeah. Boring, adult stuff. Which reminds me of something." Tony brings the kid to his side.
Steve could feel a single tear slide down his left cheek. And it stopped halfway down. Just like Tony's that night. He remembers that teardrop. It still puzzles the blonde now, on why it never moved. Maybe, it was waiting to be moved.
Suddenly, a sharp pain came from the back of his head. The man touched it gently, slightly stroking his fingers across the area. Then it came to him.
Steve sighed in annoyance. "
"I thought we agreed to keep this on the down-low." Tony instantly grimaced at his words.
"Seriously, is this house older than Steve?" He quipped half-heartedly.
The endgame is coming, and I hope ur guy’s hearts are ready! Hope y’all are safe, and staying home! ✌️🏻
'Bare?' He thought.
Tony looked to the blonde. Really trying to read him. Steve noticed this and copied his expression.
Yet it confused him, that she was staring right at the picture. As if she knew they or whoever was there ready to snap the picture.
"Nah, I got Sam for that now." Sam was giggling on the other end.
"Okay… fine. But, hurry up! The boys have already helped me with the barn. And you girls said that you'd at least help with the outside decor. Since I'm too old-fashioned." Steve rolled his eyes.
Steve just stood quietly, chuckling to himself. The philanthropist almost looked a like a robot malfunctioning, with his vocabulary being all over the place.
all that I have. And you let her be taken away. But even when she came back, I thought she could let me live with her. But she can't, and I can't even be mad at her for it.".
Once the party had ended, Kamala, Bruce, Natasha, and the rest of the avengers headed to their rooms for a good night's rest. But not before Natasha took a peek into Steve's room.
But through all the drama, the avengers would get the information they needed from their reunion. And they were definitely not pleased.
“You got hit by an energy blast, which seemingly malfunctioned your arc reactor.
Once his eyes fell upon their past-selves again, Tony was near his climax. His moans were picking up, which honestly made Steve chuckle a little. But before he could relive their climax, the memory faded from his subconscious. And he was once again, looking at an empty sofa.
"Sayre, sir. Richard Sayre. It's really amazing to meet you, Mr. Stark!" The man gleamed.
"You know, Tony, If you need to talk. I'm here." She confided.
The blonde moderately got dressed, and left her room. However, her usual first thing that she does almost every day, is to check on Morgan. Call it paranoia, mother's worry, or overprotectiveness. Pepper has seen far too much evil in the world to be anything but the aforementioned list.
His body shook with a vengeance. He sweated profusely, and chills/numbness enveloped his feet, legs, and face. Yet, he knew it. He knew why this was occurring, and he honestly felt like punching himself in the gut for it. You know, if it wasn't for the already pain subsiding there for substitution.
"I thought we agreed no more nicknames?" Steve stated, still with an amused smile. The two separated and Tony moved to the other side of the table.
"I don't know, really. Look... you don't want to go through with it, and I truly understand Tony. And I'm so sorry for putting you in a tough situation." Steve apologized.
“I mean... Wow! Like did-did he apologize or anything?” Peter inquired.
It ringed for a moment before the sound of Tony's voice graced his ears. "Steve?".
Steve let a smile grow, and he nodded. Natasha followed his reaction with a hug. Sam heading up to them soon after.
"Just saying." Tony concluded.
And as Natasha and Steve headed to the quinjet, one question remained in their heads. Or really dozens of them.
"Okay then. Does anyone else have any interesting stories?" He asked frustratingly.
It was damn near nightfall, and Steve was getting hopeless. Miles of forest, on both sides of his car. Seemingly looking dominant and almost foreboding. Steve never expected trees to look this intimidating. But in this situation, everything did.
"What? What are you talking about, Steve?! The blast hit me directly." Tony could see the super-soldier take a deep breath.
Why did Tony have to be immobilized at the moment? Did the universe really need to torture him some more?
Steve just held the man. He knew Tony was confused, and exhausted. And honestly, a good cry session is what the brunette needed. In one day, he managed to: stop shield's airship from crashing, save the world from an alien invasion, nearly die in the process, shun his girlfriend for wanting to comfort him; and finally, he kissed a man he had just met, only for said man to return the favor for Tony's own confused amusement.
He had awoken that morning to hear screaming outside. It was Jenny. Steve rushed outside and couldn’t find the source of Jenny’s screams.
Once their laughing subsided, Tony looked to his feet, while Steve looked to him. Their thoughts clouding them for a moment.
Tony just snickered mischievously. He took a few more sips of his milkshake before glancing back up at Steve.
." Steve stated honestly.
Somehow, someway, Steve Rogers was able to bring back those emotions. And all Tony wanted to do, was to savor these nostalgic emotions he was feeling. He wanted to crawl back into bed and pretend that the super-soldier was lying next to him.
"Wait, What? You didn't want to?" Tony asked.
The group disbanded, all taking their theories with them. Steve returned the stool and was heading deeper into the ship before a hand softly grabbed his arm. He turned to see Tony looking at him, his eyes twinkling with admiration.
“Annie… I know you love that doll. But you have to let Tina play with it too, you know? You can’t be so stingy with things that you know aren’t only yours.” Steve stated gently.
On the other hand, he’s glad they didn’t. ‘Cause now he has a beautiful little girl from them staying together. And currently, that little girl was calling to him.
Just an hour ago, the Chimera gleamed with vibrance and holiday cheer. Tribulations and conversations were discussed. And even when the lights and music died down. There was still some left for two avengers, who finally were getting a night to rest.
“Oh, I know. I came in here earlier when you two were smacking lips. But I didn’t want to impose so I grabbed a soda before re-entering the room.” She confessed.
Tony then, put his hand on Steve's waist and began rubbing it. He croaked out the word, "Okay...", and timidly smiled. His entire face now was pink, with his eyes now puffy of salty tears.
The nightmare, as well, definitely didn’t help the situation either.
"Did you know that I punched Hitler in the face, once?".
"I sure as hell am!" Sam & Bucky were cackling now.
"I'm just joking with you! It's just an old man trying to make a funny comment." He chuckled.
Pepper did notice, while walking back through the living room, the raunchy mess on the sofa, but decided to let the boys clean that up in the morning.
"Sure thing. Just know, I'm always the one on 'top'." Steve quipped.
He pinched the bridge of his nose, "
A chilly gust of wind hit him, and he shuttered softly. Goosebumps littering his arm, as he opened the creaky, old, door and began his descent. The creaking of each step making him feel overwhelmed, and unnerved. Add a couple of spiderwebs creepily brushing across the side of his face, causing Tony to stumble a bit. And you have a recipe for ‘being scared shitless’.
“Oh! No, not at all. I was just...”.
Tony took notice of this, and again felt obligated to keep it going. He knew Peter had questions, that he wanted answers. But the philanthropist couldn’t bring himself to want to, or at least not yet.
And yet, as Tony finally emerged from the basement, realizing it was nightfall. It instantly made the philanthropist smile out of remembrance. Losing hours to work must be Tony's specialty.
Wanda did as she was told, and simply walked along with her new companion to their table. Looking around, she could see the other locals chatting, laughing, and just having an envying good time. Oh god, how she just wanted to sit at a café and not have to worry about being noticed.
The soldier shook his head, agreeing to the terms. "Thank you, Steve." The men headed out of the room.
As he blew it out, he was about to finish his sentence. When he noticed Tony leaning in. Nothing could've prepared him for what was to happen. But it did, and Steve swears he wasn't dreaming. Tony Stark, The Tony Stark, playboy extraordinaire, was kissing him!
