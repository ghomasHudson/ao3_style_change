‘Reminds me of the ones we used to get back when I was a kid,’ Steve chuckles as he joins the two of them. ‘Sometimes we couldn’t afford one so my mom would bring in one of the potted plants and we’d just decorate that instead.’
Thank you so much to everyone who has commented, I think I've replied to most of them but I'll sit down and catch up with any I've missed.
‘No one,’ he turns to the other team members in the common area, ‘is to touch any of that until Peter is finished. Or I’ll get FRIDAY to lock you in your rooms.’
‘What about Wanda, then? She used to be our enemy didn’t she? She helped Ultron, does that she doesn’t deserve to be happy with Vision?’
‘Yep. We’re not telling you where all the mistletoe is though, that’s part of the challenge. No one knows where
‘Course not,’ Bucky says, downing his whiskey. ‘Now go speak to Tony while I find Peter and see how long it takes for him to snap.’
Bucky just sighs a laugh and shakes his head. ‘Come on, Stevie, we need to get your fella back. Then I’m actually going to teach you how to get past the staring stage of a relationship.’
‘Really? Huh that’s cool, I wondered why everyone was so happy drinking that blend from Budapest. I swear when Clint and I made you try it you hated it.’
He laughs. ‘Alright, no it’s not. I like watching you guys train so I can see what changes I can make to your gear that will mean they’re more comfortable and of more use.’
May puts an arm over his shoulders. ‘Oh, Peter honey it wasn’t your fault at all. You know as well as I do it was a mugging gone wrong.’
‘No, we’re not,’ Natasha puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder, ‘but neither is it for us to say who he can and cannot see; none of us are his legal guardian. Wade is on probation, the same as Loki: both of them need to be on their best behaviour.’
Yo peeps! You’re friendly neighbourhood Deadpool here just, yet again, doing a job for the author because that’s just the lovely kind of merc that I am.
May had taken a little more encouragement, and she’d taken him aside after dinner and demanded he explain just why he failed to mention he was best friends with a mercenary. He’d tried pointing out that she doesn’t like hearing about his patrols, and the look she’d given him had sent him scurrying as fast as possible. Which for him is pretty damn quick.
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you're enjoying the story so far, do let me know if you have any requests for the rest of the story. The first part is more the team introducing the Guardians to the different traditions, and then we'll have more of the relationship side of things from the Yule feast onwards.
knew the risks when we faced Thanos,’ Peter gets his stubborn frown on his face and Natasha suppresses a groan. This was going to get heated quickly. ‘Besides what’s the point in beating Thanos if we’re just going to keep grudges against each other afterwards about
Surprisingly the next to go out is Hope, who only just managed to find a trash can to vomit into before Wanda helps her to her room.
‘Oh stop being a know-it-all,’ he grumbles. ‘What are you doing for Christmas?’ he asks as they take a seat on the edge of the building and start munching on their tacos.
‘It was May,’ he struggles to stop his breath from catching. ‘I was at the mugging. He stepped in to save
‘Only when it’s physically impossible to get them to leave,’ Weasel replies. ‘This little punk nearly ripped Buck’s arm off last time he was here.’
Tony thinks as he lets the amber liquid run down his throat, relishing the burn. He’s just going to have to make sure he doesn’t drink too much that he can’t be of some help.
‘I shall have to speak to my people before I leave,’ Thor says, then turns to his brother. ‘Loki, if you are willing, I will tell the people that you are to lead them in my absence.’
‘So we got the first proper special coming up at the end of the week. Yep you heard right. Less than one fucking week people! It’s all focusing on my Baby Boy and him having an “interview” to join the Superhero Squad. Yes I did air quote. Get the fuck over it already. Basically we get to follow that beautiful spandex-clad ass as he does his superhero thing and saves people. Honestly bring the popcorn, anything with that ass in it is going to be awesome!’
‘What about if we stop looking at what he’s been up to recently?’ Peter suggests. ‘He’ll have been covering his tracks too much right? What about from a few months ago when he would have been starting to get in contact with HYDRA?’
for most of this facility including the medical care, I think I can,’ when Steve enters her arms are crossed over her chest and there’s a frown on her face.
He points to another picture. ‘Now this is your Aunty Natasha, and she’s my Mommy Spider. Now the only problem is that she’ll never let you have a boyfriend because she’ll be way too protective of you, plus she’ll send anyone running with her glare, that glare is a super power all by itself. Actually you know what?
A/N: First of all thank you as always to all of you for your continued support of this story; to my wonderful reviewers and to everyone who has left kudos on this story. You are all amazing!
‘The next move, Miss Potts,’ he replies, ‘is tying up our loose ends with the issue over Sergeant Barnes. There’s a couple of people still involved in all of that I want to see come to justice. JARVIS?’
‘Well Loki was actually trying to help,’ she flicks some of her hair over her shoulder and takes a sip from her coffee mug, ‘and it backfired spectacularly on him. On the other hand Bucky is currently going through the very thing he was trying to avoid.’
‘You have nothing to apologise for, Thor,’ Loki’s voice is low, ‘it is this group who shall be sorry they have touched our friends. The full wrath of Asgard
‘Love you too,’ he says after a very brief pause. It takes every ounce of strength Tony possess to turn around and walk down the stairs.
‘Guys, somethings happening out on the street,’ Bruce cuts through the argument, and the sound of yelling finally reaches the rest of the group.
just by being around before you even met him? You’re honestly going to stand there and tell me that when that spider first bit you and you realised you had these powers the first thing you didn’t think was “wow now I get to be like Iron Man”?’
‘I know, and I will, just not yet,’ he promises her. ‘He’s still recovering from everything with Venom, and he’s got to get used to the idea of living here and May moving away. Not to mention Thanos. I think it’d just be a bit too much to add this as well.’
‘-Matt Murdock,’ he replies, taking her hand with no problem, Peter sees her raise her eyebrows in surprise and shares a look with Loki. ‘I believe you’ve been asking after me Agent Romanoff.’
‘We’re working on finding the rest of Beck’s associates,’ Hill takes over, ‘we should have rounded them all up in the next few days.’
Steve sighs and Tony grips the sheets beneath his hands tighter, trying to stop the traitorous flow. ‘Will you look at me? Please?’
Interesting note on Loki using Mjolnir: I did a little bit of research and there is apparently one alternate reality where Loki is the one who wields Mjolnir instead of Thor.  I wasn't sure about having Loki able to wield Mjolnir all the time in this story, as I think he still has some way to go, but in that moment he just wanted to be worthy enough to save his brother, so he was able to use the hammer. Let me know what you think of that.
‘Well you aren’t supposed to still be out here.’ They turn to see a smiling Pepper Potts, hands on her hips and shaking her head as the rest of the wedding party follows her. She’s in the same dress as Natasha and she looks just as stunning.
‘Right, let’s see what they have to say,’ Steve says, leading the way with T’Challa and Loki. Natasha walks a few steps behind with Strange and Tony hovering at her side.
Tony looks up as Steve, Vision and Wanda walk back into the room from wherever they’d disappeared to. ‘Yeah,’ he says, folding the recipe so the last step was hidden. ‘Hey Peter, Wanda? Fancy making some cookies?’
Another masked figure chooses that moment to enter the main area where they’re being held, a woman this time. ‘We’ve got a problem,’ she says, capturing her friends’ attention.
Peter elbows Harry surreptitiously in the side when the other boy starts to cough to cover a laugh. ‘Sure you don’t want to try instead Harry?’ he glares at his friend.
‘Francis is the fucker that did this to me,’ he gestures to the scars on his face, which he’s become a lot less self-conscious about around the team now. ‘He was the one in charge of the experiments, stupid bastard called himself Ajax but I got his real name off his laundry-’
‘Good luck, Steve, our resident grumpy guts is in fine form,’ Sam says, getting up from the chair. ‘Anyone would think he doesn’t appreciate us caring about him.’
‘Sam and I’ll go get the brief,’ Natasha says, ‘you guys clean up and get ready. We’ll meet you in the common area in twenty.’
‘Not yet, not until they’ve talked more with Strange,’ he replies as they fall into step. ‘Besides we have other things for them to focus on before we start worrying about inter-dimensional travel being added to that list. How are preparations for the Wakandan Accords going?’
‘We’ll start small and slowly build up,’ she reassures him, ‘with you still being at school and with your Avenger duties we don’t want to overburden you, but at least this way you can start to see how things work and then, when you have more time and feel more confident, you can start to become more and more involved if that’s something you want.’
Not knowing how long it’s going to take Bucky and Steve to reach them Loki decides to play along this once, thankful for the time he has spent with Vision in the training room. ‘Very well,’ he lets his Asgardian form melt away, revealing the Jotun one hidden beneath. He still doesn’t feel fully comfortable like this, and he tries not to look over to see Tony’s reaction.
The laugh that escapes Deadpool’s mouth makes him pause. ‘Oh yeah, good one, Spider-Man. Maybe you should ask your buddy the Winter Soldier just how easy it is to escape from Hydra.’ He takes a deep breath and sighs. ‘I said I’m sorry, alright? I panicked and I went on instinct. In the past that’s the only option I’ve had because I’ve always worked alone. I’m not like you, Spider-Man, I didn’t have people backing me up, giving me snazzy gear and that would come and find me if something happened to me. Most of the people I knew thought I was dead when I got my abilities. It’s always been me, myself and I. So if my methods don’t match up with yours I’m sorry but that’s just the way it’s always been.’
Tony shakes his head. ‘I need you to buy us as much time as possible with the UN. Get the Wakandan Accords through, keep HYDRA fighting on two fronts, and I’ll…’ he swallows and heaves a sigh, ‘I’ll…try and keep this team from falling apart.’
Tony turns to look at the figure hunched on the ground, metal hand on his knee and the other tangled in his dark hair. To anyone else he looks like the epitome of despair, but Tony’s spent the best part of two months with the guy and he notices that the tension in his shoulders is just a little less than usual. Almost as if a weight has gone, a small one, but a weight all the same.
A/N: Hi everyone. So here's my apology for being late with updating chapter. Plus it's my 'I'm super excited because I have tickets to see Tom Hiddleston in the closing night of Betrayal' extra chapter! Yeah so I'm super excited about that, just thought I'd share.
‘He’s one of my best friends,’ he admits, voice quiet, ‘and he makes me laugh. I just- I can’t imagine him
Tony muses. ‘You know,’ he tries not to laugh as Steve opens one eye to look at him with a mixture of intrigue and trepidations, he knows he’s using his I’ve-been-plotting tone (as Peter had named it), ‘I did have an idea that I was going to run past you at some point.’
‘Fuck you Hammer,’ Tony manages to croak out from cracked lips. ‘I already told you, you don’t know shit. Never did. Probably why all your tech was so shi-’
‘Fury said he’d come for Christmas Day as well, then leave us and come back on New year. Hill’s spending it with family,’ she finishes.
‘Shit who turned on the fucking lights?’ I groan as someone moves something above me, letting light hit me straight in the eyes.
Natasha opens her mouth to say something when the roar of a jetpack has them looking up. Sam flies over the top of the facility and lands right in front of the gathered crowd just as the last person steps off the bus.
Steve holds Tony’s gaze for a few moments then nods. ‘I understand. When we come back, when we get everyone back, then we’ll tell everyone. Pepper first.’
‘Right,’ Steve nods, deciding that’s something he’s going to ask about when they’re not in the middle of a fight, ‘you doing alright Bruce?’
‘Let him go!’ Tony lands not far from them, holding up his hands and lifting his face plate. He looks at Peter and he can see the fear in his mentor’s eyes.
‘I was out in Afghanistan on a weapons demonstration,’ Tony pauses to down the rest of the liquid in his glass. ‘Rhodey was in the group but I insisted on travelling back to the base separately. I think he still blames himself for what happened,’ he continues as he refills their glasses. Bucky is silent as he tells his story, immobile save for the rise and fall of his chest as he breaths.
‘I hear you,’ MJ nods, ‘and whilst I sympathise and find witnessing people’s misery entertaining, I’m not going to go with you.’
Peter laughs at Sam’s response, shaking his head as the comments and debates from his classmates continue around him.
‘I know that, Steve,’ Tony snaps, ‘I’m just hoping there’s something in this stuff about Hammer that can give us a clue seeing as everyone else is focussing on HYDRA.’
‘No problem, Reindeer Games,’ Tony sends him a wink and then leaves the room. For once Loki doesn’t feel quite so lonely.
Natasha nods. ‘No one’s exactly sure what happened, but it looks like it was part of a programme to create soldiers with mutated genes to be sold to the highest bidders.’
‘This sounds like an excellent idea!’ Thor booms. ‘What are these wildebeest you speak of and who is this Mufasa I can avenge?’
‘Silence!’ Thor thunders. ‘Loki is my brother and a Prince of Asgard and will not be spoken of in this manner. Or did you forget that he sacrificed himself to save you?’ He turns back to his friends. ‘I shall explain later but it seems the glamour our father put on him has faded as his life energy dwindles. His skin will give us frost bite if we touch him. How are we supposed to move him now? It could kill us to try.’
‘Well, uh, happy new year, Spidey,’ Wade says, ‘you uh, you want to go on that date or would you rather not and-’
Natasha smirks. ‘While the rest of you were doing such a fine job of keep him distracted, Tony managed to get a message through without Hammer realising.’ She holds up her piece of paper, with the hastily translated Morse code. ‘He was tapping on the reactor. Morse code. It’s one of the addresses Peter got from Daredevil.’
‘I know,’ Peter sighs, ‘but everyone else is feeling the same way so I’m…just trying to hold it in until other people have had a turn?’
She slips from the building and reaches the van, seeing the back is already crowded with victims and Wade. ‘I’ll sit up front,’ she says, ‘we’re not stopping at the barrier anyway.’
‘I would join them, but I’ve seen how happy he is with you around. So all I’m going to say is: don’t screw this up, keep him happy and keep him safe and I
‘All I’m hearing is excuses,’ she cuts him off, ‘now you bring him over here and introduce me properly. Honestly! Did I not teach you anything when you came to stay with us?’
‘If I didn’t know Pepper, I’d wonder how you actually managed to run a company for so long,’ Rhodes sighs, shaking his head.
He finds the billionaire leaning against the railing, looking along the streets of New York. ‘I thought you always preferred the after parties to the main event?’
Spider-Man and Deadpool meet an interesting character dressed all in red, and Deadpool tells Spider-Man a little of his past before leaving for a job.
‘I called in a couple of favours,’ he explains. ‘Well and owe a favour. Those are all areas of high activity with weapons distribution, most probably from HYDRA activity.’
Loki laughs sharply. ‘It’s not often I have heard that in recent years, I thank you for your words.’
‘I would introduce you,’ he says, ‘but that feels too much like I’m bringing home a partner or something. Plus you already know Dad; and Mom as well I suppose.’
‘I’m sorry!’ she shouts, nearly losing her banana split to the bed. ‘That’s exactly why. My powers sometimes go a bit haywire and send things flying around.’
Thank you so much everyone for reading, for leaving kudos and for leaving comments. It's been a tough month as my Dad's gone into hospital for surgery, so I've just about been keeping up with doing some writing. Reading the reviews has been absolutely amazing as I've been having them come through at tough times and they've put a smile on my face. He's out and doing well now, so I'm hoping to reply to all the comments between Christmas and New Year. Keep an eye out for your replies.
‘You think she’ll ever agree to be part of the team? I mean she is technically from the past and doesn’t have any of the memories of them forming. It’d be like one of us being killed and then us going and getting them from the past from a time before they knew any of us.’
‘See here’s the thing that’s been bugging me,’ Tony says, taking a seat opposite his old rival as Natasha crosses her arms and leans against the wall. ‘You were always notoriously shit at anything, even when you tried to copy my stuff you still screwed up; you even managed to screw up teaming up with a villain. The
Finally, in Tony’s honest opinion as he collapses into his seat at the Yule table, they are able to start on the actual Yule Feast. They’d decided to miss out the formal dancing, and other parts of the celebration, and were just going to head back inside to start a party afterwards; Thor, Loki and Valkyrie had already done the other traditions before they arrived, and many of them would have been boring for Cassie.
She opens her mouth, then seems to change her mind on what she was going to say. ‘Since I first met you when everything happened with Vanko and Hammer. Pepper mentioned it took you weeks to have a shower without a panic attack after you came back, and you still refused to go near baths.’
‘Good enough. Now let’s go join the part- Peter Benjamin Parker how many do I have to tell you: no eating on the ceiling!’
T’Challa chuckles. ‘Oh no he fought like a cub that doesn’t want it’s mother to leave for the hunt: making lots of protests but no claws to back it up. However the Council has signed the documents, and the President has agreed so there is little he can do.’
and not on Peter Parker and he can keep the two lives separate as long as possible. If we take away Spiderman then the kid has these powers and nothing to do with them and he’ll go mad. He’ll constantly be holding back his strength and his speed and he won’t have any outlets.’
‘This…it’s not really a Christmas present,’ he admits, holding the small box in his hand and moving towards the bed.
‘I’ll pay you back,’ Scott promises. ‘I just had to get here and Ralph couldn’t fly me the whole way.’
‘You’d say anything to make Tony happy,’ Rhodes snorts. Peter tries to pout put ends up nearly losing his mouthful instead.
‘Well since you are practically vibrating with pent up energy,’ Bucky laughs, and Peter realises how much he’s fidgeting and tries to stand still, ‘why don’t you go suit up and go do some training inside while this lot is distracted? We’ll tell them Tony called you in to help with something.’
‘Not unless there’s one in this suit. Oh,’ Bucky blinks as his armour lights up, Steve’s copying him, ‘wow Tony really is a genius.’
Bucky feels Loki’s surprise and it does nothing to reassure him. The trickster has so many thoughts in quick succession to try and work out the cause that Bucky can barely keep up. -
‘Hey!’ he protests, having prised the web off enough to talk. He’s had so much practise it’s genuinely scary how quickly Wade can get rid of his webs now.
Tony huffs a laugh. ‘You’ll be pleased to hear you’re a couple of corridors away from him. I’ll get Steve to take him down to the training area and work away some of the excess energy.’
‘He’s the reason we had the addresses in the first place, Steve,’ Natasha soothes him, then turns to the red suited man. ‘What are you doing here now?’
Then Bucky turns to look at him, and he knows from the look in the man’s eyes he’s only going to accept the truth. And he’s going to know if Peter’s hiding something. ‘Alright, Peter I spent enough time before the war looking after Steve when he was getting picked on to know what was happening back there. Does that kid do it often?’
and not have to worry. And now you’ve just sprung all my classmates arriving here on me, without warning, and I have to go back to hiding everything in the one place I’ve always been able to relax. Why didn’t anyone
‘Wanda?’ Peter steps closer to her. ‘What’s wrong?’ He says a word in what Tony thinks is Sokovian. The effect on Wanda is terrifying.
Peter shrugs. ‘That’s just the way I look at it. I mean I know he took on a lot of Tony’s worst personality traits from that time as well, but I think a lot of those old influences also played a part in how he went about trying to follow Tony’s plan. I’m not saying Tony can’t sometimes be a bit overenthusiastic when it comes to protecting people around him, I mean I know that more than most people, and there’s times I thought he was a bit harsh on me. But that’s just the way he is, he kind of bulldozes his way through things when he’s scared, but it doesn’t mean he doesn’t care. Plus he’s much better now than he used to be back then.’
‘He’s right,’ Bucky’s voice cuts across as Steve opens his mouth to respond. ‘None of us are fully focussed on anything because we’re too busy worrying about the rest of the team. If we’re all here we can focus on the Accords, and Tony’s lawyers are more than capable of dealing with the trial.’
‘Since the experiment that gave her her powers,’ Vision explains from where he is sitting on one of the sofas, ‘whenever her time of the month comes around it throws her hormones into chaos and the first two days are normally very difficult for her. Her powers can also be in flux, which means objects can get thrown around. Even I know to stay away when she is feeling like this.’
‘And if,’ Tony smiles as the two children struggle to stay awake to hear the end of the story, ‘if by some miracle they made it past the Angel, then they had two more sets of challenges, and the next one was one that no one, not monster or guardian, had ever managed to face down. The next guardian was the Fire Lady and no one could withstand her fiery glare; there is not a soul brave enough in the entire
‘Wow thank you so much!’ Ned’s still excitable tone pierces Peter’s thoughts as the boy opens the door and waves to the two Avengers. ‘Thank you, really. And Pete?’ Peter looks round at the sound of his name. ‘Thanks for pushing me out the way. You didn’t have to you know?’
‘Not much, but I’ll do what I can,’ he replies, and Steve can hear the sound of the archer’s bow being drawn through the comms. A few moments later there’s the sound of an explosion and, looking out of the window, he can see the vehicle has overturned and figures are climbing out of the wreckage.
I duck down behind one of the SUVs that were parked here when we arrived, letting the idiots use up their ammo. Then there’s a break in the firing.
‘Well…each family has different traditions they do, and since we all became each other’s family we just decided to combine ones from everyone. It’s actually quite fun because it means we’ve all been doing things we hadn’t done before. And we’ve been making new ones as well: like Bucky winning that huge tree the first year that now means we always get a huge one to put outside. And last year we did Yule and now we’re going to start doing a Yule feast each year, just later than the usual date.’
Nebula shakes her head. ‘We have a complicated history. I think they only allowed me to stay with them because of her. Without her here I feel like I am looking in from the outside. I don’t have a place without her there.’
‘You alright?’ Sam asks next to her, and she opens her eyes to a bottle of water held up in front of her.
Frustrated he lets it fall onto the table in front of him and leans back on the sofa, hand automatically reaching out for a glass, before remembering that he hasn’t poured himself a drink. He’d told himself he couldn’t until he’d made the call.
‘So, kid, how’s the crazy fan been then?’ Bucky asks, voice innocent but the grin on his face is anything but.
Belinda looks like a rabbit caught in headlights for a couple of moments, before she just nods and scurries out of the room.
The girliest screech Tony has ever heard has him banging his head on the bottom of the boiler the next morning.
A/N: Hi everyone! I would say sorry to leave you on a cliffhanger but I'm not really. Hope you all enjoy this chapter.
‘Sam Wilson should be here in a moment to help direct everyone to the accommodation we’ve set up for you, he should be here already I do apologise for his lateness. Although,’ she looks at Peter out of the corner of her eye, ‘Pete could always help me seeing as Sam’s gone AWOL.’
‘Ah yes, the infamous Black Widow. I’ve learned all about you since I last saw you Miss Romanov, very interesting.’ As Hammer continues to talk Tony taps some commands into his watch to get FRIDAY on to locating him. ‘And I see you’ve met my new friend Scott as well. How’s the face Scotty?’
‘What do you mean, Steve?’ Sam asks, though judging by the look of approval on his face he’s already guessed the answer.
Pepper blushes and sets her mug down, reaching for the pile of paperwork at her side. ‘I don’t know what you mean.’
‘How about you both get back into bed and I’ll tell you the story of the young prince and princess from the faraway land?’
‘I know,’ Tony smiles at him. ‘And for what it’s worth I’m sorry we didn’t tell you before. We are ready upstairs when you are though because we want to make sure we do it right from now on and we want to run the ideas past you for approval.’
Steve nods. Before he can say anything to the rest of the group, something happens he never would have expected.
‘Report in when you get there, then let us know when you’re on the way back unless you need us,’ he reminds her.
‘Yeah I know you are, Big Guy, just didn’t want to put too much on you. Now listen, Hulk, if you feel anything above you start to become unstable? I need you to tell me so I can stop moving things, you got it?’
As tears spill down his cheeks he’s pulled against the super soldier’s solid chest and he lets himself cry, gripping the front of the blond’s shirt with his one good hand.
parts of Peter’s life and accepts it. And he’s not going to do anything over PG13 until Peter’s of age.’
‘Do you really think Peter’s spidey-senses would let him be around you so much if you were that dangerous?’ Steve argues.
Tony sighs. ‘You’ll see when we get there. We’re going somewhere no one would ever think to look for us.’
‘Wanting to be in bed,’ she grumbles to herself. ‘I don’t know what it is today I just can’t get it, Nat,’ she huffs, slipping to sit cross legged on the floor. ‘Maybe we should just call it a day.’
‘No!’ he cuts her off, eyes wide. ‘Whatever you were about to say the answer is no.’ She just cackles in response and goes to grab a drink from the fridge.
Unfortunately, this is definitely not from music. If the cold, hard surface he’s laying on is anything to go by.
‘You’re really thinking you might leave?’ Bucky is looking intensely at the trickster and Stephen puts his eyes back to the clay in his hands, suddenly feeling like he’s listening in on a very private moment but not wanting to move and draw attention to himself.
Peter feels his face flush red, but tries to hide his embarrassment. ‘Miss Natasha what are you doing here?’
‘So we basically have to thread these through each other right?’ Sam eyes the contents of the table as if they’re going to start trying to strangle him.
to get us back together and to make sure we’re all ok. We just want you to do the same for yourself.’ He swallows and rapidly blinks away the traitorous tears forming behind his eyes.
‘Kid call me Miss Romanoff and I will kick your arse from here to Queens and back again as many times as it takes for you to remember not to call me that,’ Natasha says, a half smile on her face.
‘Shall we go in, Captain Rogers?’ the registrar asks him, she’s got a kind smile which Steve is immensely grateful for right now. ‘I believe Mr Stark shall be with us in a couple of minutes.’
‘The monsters that lock you in your room when you’ve done something bad,’ she replies, lip quivering. ‘The ones that shout and make loud noises and throw things at you.’
‘Pete? Just leave it for now,’ Tony cuts across him, then turns to Thor. ‘You want to tell us what’s happened to you Point Break? And why you’re sporting the space pirate look?’
‘Because they may not have noticed that every time you mention the reactor in the nightmare you start to say something else and then stop. And there’s always a brief glance at Steve when you change the topic. Now I haven’t been around for all of your interactions, but if there’d been something about Cap and your reactor from any other time I’m pretty sure Nat would know about it and would have said something. Since she hasn’t my guess is something happened in Siberia that’s still weighing on your mind and you don’t want either of the other two to feel guilty about it. Am I right?’
Steve’s right. Thor’s down on the floor, Mjolnir resting out of reach as he struggles to hold the sword Thanos is pressing towards his chest away from him. His left arm has the gauntlet, which has fused to his arm, and is laying useless at his side.
I've not really got much to say this week, so I'll just finish by reminding you that we're only down to one chapter a week from now on. Sorry!
‘I don’t behave that often,’ Tony retorts, ‘but I can manage it enough to get along with everyone. You should try it some time.’
‘I like this human, can we please convince him to come on to the team? It would be much more entertaining, and less tedious.’
‘If I answer will you leave it be?’ Loki asks. Tony seems to notice his desire to leave the conversation and nods. ‘Yes it was.’
‘Oh my god shut up!’ Peter laughs, shoving against Wade’s chest and letting the merc lead him over to where Quill and Thor are currently arm wrestling.
‘That,’ Natasha says, ‘might be a good idea. Maybe we can find out who he made contact with and that’ll give us another lead.’
‘Nice going, Wanda, now he’s going to stick himself to the ceiling and it’ll take me hours to get him out,’ Sam grumbles, disappearing into the attic to retrieve the teenager.
‘He obviously said something to you as well that made you angry, Buck, so I doubt you’re the only guilty party here.’
Only two more chapters to go before we reach the end of the first instalment. I hope you're still enjoying the journey and are intending to continue through the series!
Wanda grins and slings an arm around the teenager’s shoulders as he stomps over. ‘Fell right into our trap didn’t he, Nat?’
‘Fuck you, Rogers,’ Rumlow snaps, standing to his feet as well, ‘and it’s still “Captain” to you in case you’d forgotten. You’re still part of this squad.’
Steve’s surprised to say the least. ‘You’re asking for permission to go after one of the labs? Why? Surely you would have just gone and dealt with it and come back before we’d even realised what you’d done?’
Then a voice he knows far too well comes over the prison speakers and says a word in poorly pronounced Russian. A word that has ice settling in Tony’s stomach. When the second word in the sequence is said he fires up his suit.
‘Hang on,’ Agatha’s smile grows, ‘I’ve just realised who you are, handsome. You’re Doctor Strange. My, my Wanda you really are spoiling me, aren’t you?’
And if Sam really wants to punish himself he’ll train with Natasha, and wonder how he’s still able to find muscles he never knew existed to hurt after every single session. He’s pretty sure even his
Thor nods and, between him, Bruce and Valkyrie, they tell the story of how Thor discovered Loki masquerading as Odin, discovering they had a sister with an attitude problem the size of Everest, finding each other under the Grandmaster’s tournament, defeating Hela and the destruction of Asgard. Then comes the attack when they’d left the ruins of their planet and how their vessel had been attacked by the Mad Titan.
‘I haven’t had chance to tell him yet, this only happened about an hour ago. And the Cloak is fussing enough without him adding to it.’
Wade shrugs. ‘I don’t get cramp and I don’t get sore muscles, my healing takes care of that. So, yeah I’ve just been powering through and getting it done quicker than most people would.’
Tony watches the blond disappear, mind whirling with everything he’s just learned. He has a bad feeling about all of this.
‘You say Bucky didn’t recognise her when he shot her. I wonder if he did though,’ he muses out loud.
‘Ah my lovely Widow, so glad one of you have some sense,’ Hammer smiles again. ‘You have until tomorrow at eight. If I don’t hear by then, I’m afraid your friend will have a few more holes. Bye, bye!’ With that the call ends.
Loki studies him careful, then he feels the trickster’s nudging at his mind and lets him in. ‘I know what you mean,’ he says quietly. ‘It is nice to have a companion there all the time, and it being someone I can trust not to invade my privacy. And as you say it’s an insurance against future mind control.’
Tony seems to notice it at the same moment, or FRIDAY tells him, because he looks over the top of the trees and spots some black dots heading their way. ‘We’ve got incoming,’ he says, ‘so how about we park this discussion for now and keep these guys busy until the others get back?’ He doesn’t give Peter time to answer and takes off to intercept some of the aircraft.
‘We celebrated Yule last night,’ Steve explains, his chest vibrating far too noisily for Tony’s comfort, ‘and we were up drinking quite…well early by the time we finished.’
‘Positive, Cap,’ he feels his body slip into the stance Natasha taught him. ‘Give me your best shot.’
Instead of answering, Steve poses a question of his own. ‘Did he tell you about the nightmares? With the- with my shield?’
the throne as the current king of Asgard was so content to do at one time. No. The only way you can give up the throne is through
‘I’ll go meet them,’ he says to the rest of the group, ‘and bring them up when they’re all settled.’
‘Need a lift?’ Tony grabs hold of Steve, lifting both of them into the air and heading towards the hut where they’d left Thanos.
‘Yeah, sure Vis, just give me a sec. You guys alright looking after Matt for a bit?’ he asks his friends.
A few of the Council members look surprised and Ross gives a derisive snort. ‘Oh this should be good,’ the Secretary General says.
?’ Steve asks as they round a corner and the light from their suits illuminates the walls. All across one stretch is what looks like a mural.
Peter grins. ‘You’ll have to wait till next time to learn my name.’ He swings away to the sound of the merc’s laughter.
‘Nat? Get the jet ready, we’re leaving. Vis and I will meet you all there in a couple of minutes,’ he says.
Loads of tension between Cap and Tin Can, which alternates between arguments and near kisses. Oh my GOD did it take them forever to get together or what? We also find out old Snowflake (aka the Winter Soldier) has a bit of a thing for Tin Can too, and our Stony nearly became a Winter Iron. But then Tin Can gets threatened by Hammer who is now working for HYDRA (“No? Really? We didn’t see that coming a mile off” I hear you all say), then Hammer turns up at Petey’s school and tries to threaten him and Tin Can turns up and is all “fuck off and don’t touch my kid, Hammer” so then Hammer gets his buddies HYDRA to try and catch Tin Can and Peter. Luckily Peter calls me, rest of the team turns up, and we get Tin Can and Peter out of there and off to safety at the facility.
‘No idea,’ Valkyrie sighs, ‘I don’t really know what all the fuss is about, to be honest. He’s never been that bad ever since I’ve known him.’
‘That sounds like a lot of pointless crap,’ Rocket says once they finish. ‘What’s the point in this? Just sounds like an excuse to spend too much money on people for no real reason.’
‘There’s no proof it was me,’ Rumlow points out, ‘this is all pure conjecture, you’re just jumping to conclusions. Besides why the hell do you care, Rogers? I know you get a stick up your ass about doing our fucking “duty” but this is more than that. Wait,’ his eyes narrow and he looks between Steve and Tony and Bucky; then they widen in realisation. ‘You went to the party didn’t you? You fucking bastard you disobeyed my direct order and went to the party. You told them about Barnes’ arm.’
‘What about the infinity stones?’ Wade cuts in again. ‘If HYDRA get through to either of them, they’ll know where they all are.’
Peter can’t help the rush of the pride at those words, as Vision takes Steve’s place at his side and draws him into a conversation about how his senses were working and how fighting him had changed the signals he was receiving.
Natasha watches as Vision climbs in last, closing the door behind him and settling down next to Wanda; she can’t help a small smile at the sight of the two of them, they look much happier now they’re together.
There’s a pause before he starts again, quieter this time. ‘I do think your best creation has to be the guy behind me though, Howard. You’d be so proud of him, even if you wouldn’t say it knowing you. He’s done so much, still does, and he does it despite being as broken as I am, just in a different way. He’s stronger than me, though, despite all the cracks. I know I’m to blame for a lot of that, taking you and Maria away from him when he was young, and I’m sorry for that too. I-’ Bucky trails off, seemingly running out of words.
No one says anything again until the news coverage comes to an end and it turns to anchors discussing the events in London.
.’ The teen continues, as black tendrils start to curl around his body, then he raises an arm and the black tendrils reach out and wrap around the gauntlet, stopping Thanos from being able to use that hand.
‘You could come and join us,’ Steve says, collecting the cards to shuffle them. ‘Bucky just lost to me again.’
‘It might be something to consider,’ Wong says to Strange. ‘With the Ancient One gone we still have no Sorcerer Supreme, and our numbers are still low after Kaecilius’ attack; I am not sure what Mordo has planned either, but I do not think he’s a friend of Kamar-Taj at present.’
When Wade looks back at him, he can’t tear his eyes away from the brown ones looking back at him and his chest feels tight, like he can’t breathe. ‘Yeah, well… I just…’ he sighs and, taking a deep breath, starts again. ‘Even before coming here you were the most important person in my life, Baby Boy, and now after this last week I’m thinking that if you weren’t in it that it’d be just one long shit show after eating fifty gone off vindaloo. And I know I’m not exactly Prince fucking Charming; I mean I look like someone hate fucked an Egyptian mummy, my job isn’t exactly shit free, and my personality leaves something to be desired but-’ Wade’s eyes skim over his face, making him wonder if he’s looking for courage to carry on or a reason to shut up. ‘Well I guess what I’m trying to say, not so eloquently, is: if you’ll have me Baby Boy I’d have your back outside of patrols as well as in and, well, want to go grab some tacos some time?’
He slams her backwards in a wall and she cries out in pain, losing her grip on him and falling to a heap at his feet. With the pain the despair returns and he looks up into his hard gaze, not trying to hold back her sobs. ‘I’m the Winter Soldier,’ he tells her.
‘We’ll be having a vocabulary test next lesson Mr Parker, I suggest you get the list from one of your friends,’ his teacher says as he makes his way forwards.
It feels like it takes hours before there’s finally a hole big enough and stable enough for the first of the trapped civilians to be coached through by Rhodes and Clint; Clint steps out of the War Machine suit and has it stand sentry in case anyone tries to attack them from behind whilst he lays on his front and helps pull the three trapped in there with Rhodes and Hulk one by one.
Vision nods. ‘Losing the team hit him harder than I think even he realises. Now that we’re all back together, he’s going to do everything he can to make sure everyone’s happy here.’
‘We haven’t lost yet, Rocket,’ Quill growls at him. ‘Now let me down before I find a way to turn you into a cushion!’
‘Tony get down!’ Clint slamming into his side and sending them both sprawling to the ground from his chair cuts off his retort, the next thing he hears is a crack from the table. He looks up over Clint’s shoulder to see a bullet hole in the table. Rhodes and Bruce have already scrambled to their feet and Rhodes is looking out of the window looking for where the bullet came from.
‘No matter how many times I hear that it still weirds me out,’ Ned shakes his head. They spend the next hour discussing plans for December until Ned and MJ have to leave; Loki still has his bowl of vanilla to finish so he and Peter stay at the table and refresh their memories on what they have left to purchase.
‘Absolutely. We are working around our remaining differences and coming to understandings. We are also working to show the rest of the world that we have learned from our mistakes and we will do everything in our power to ensure they are not repeated,’ Tony’s voice is confident as he continues to field questions from the reporters.
‘Wow I got told stories about the Boogeyman and werewolves. I think I prefer your monsters, they look so much cooler. Can you actually create ice if you’re a Frost Giant?’
‘Yeah yeah, whatever,’ he replies, rolling his eyes at Peter, giving the boy’s hair a ruffle as he climbs out. ‘Oh and Pete?’ he says as he gets into the front and closes the door. ‘We’re telling Tony when we get back. I’m not keeping this from him anymore if you’re getting physically bullied now.’
Wanda gives him a big smile and pats the bed next to her, spirting a spare duvet from her wardrobe for him to wrap around himself. ‘What do you want to watch?’
‘Just where do you get all of these ideas from?’ she asks, bending to pick up some more of the grenades and fitting them to the glove Tony had given her when they’d started. At the moment they have to be used with the practise glove, but he’s hoping to incorporate the design into their uniforms. At least that’s what he’s told her.
of hostiles,’ is the response, followed by the sound of an explosion, ‘but we’re keeping our heads above the water. Sorry we’re not going to be able to help for a bit.’
Steve laughs. ‘Apparently this was only a part of the leftovers. It’s supposed to keep them going for the next week so they can spend time with family and friends and not have to worry about work.’
‘Clint,’ Natasha sighs, bending down to check on him where he’s rubbing the spot on his head that connected with the boiler. ‘I guess he didn’t get the memo this morning.’
‘Ah whatever, I know you love me really. Welcome to your new home Barnes, good luck with this lot and don’t be afraid to tell them where to shove it.’
‘Alright,’ Thor sighs, but leaves him in peace. Loki notices him talking to Tony before he follows T’Challa and they leave.
‘My turn,’ I grin behind the mask, taking out the two handguns Tony had given me before leaving with some explanation about extra rounds and better handling and whatever the fuck he was saying. Who cares?  All I got out of it was: these are more fun and cause more mayhem.
It’s late evening by the time Tony brings the jet to a soft landing on the grass lawn outside the dark and silent house.
‘Don’t blame yourself, Cap,’ at his shocked expression Rhodes chuckles. ‘You have the same look on your face Tony does when he’s blaming himself for something. Trust me I know it very well.’ Steve feels his face heating up in embarrassment. ‘Howard was never going to win any awards for being the world’s best dad, regardless of who was or wasn’t in the picture. He was better with machines than with people, very much like Tony. So anyway, when Tony started acting out, trying to get some form of attention, Howard started comparing him to you. I think it was as some form of revenge for Tony’s behaviour, making you out to be this perfect person that Tony could never emulate when he knew that you’d been a hero for Tony for so long.
‘She says she’s playing lifeguard until she’s finished reading some reports,’ Sam replies. ‘Then she’s going to, and I quote: have us drowning in our own tears of frustration.’
‘Let’s see what my favourite person has to say about the situation. Secretary Ross,’ Tony greets the man who has just appeared on the large screen in front of them. Wanda hears an edge to his voice and is beginning to get some idea of the full extent of Tony’s dislike for the man. ‘Any particular reason you want us to help out the NYPD? Do you owe the Commissioner money?’
Rhodes gives a strained smile. ‘Just you wait till you meet him outside of the battlefield, he’s even more of a talker. But he’s a good kid. We’ve managed to keep his identity away from Ross so far. But as soon as he becomes an Avenger that’ll all be gone. Tony’s making sure he at least gets to finish college, since he turned down the offer the last time.’
‘We should be ready to move in a couple of minutes, Steve,’ Bruce tells him, not looking away from the humanoid.
‘You back in the room now, Baby Spider?’ He replies by crouching down and trying to take her legs out from under her. She dodges and laughs. ‘I’ll take that as a yes.’
‘You are no soldier,’ he counters, dodging under a punch. ‘A soldier goes where he is told and does what he is told and does not question,’ he echoes the words from one of their first friendly interactions, ‘he is a cog in a larger machine and is useful only in the number of him there are. You are no solider,’ he kicks Bucky’s knee, sending him to a kneeling position, ‘you are a warrior.’
‘You’ve been asking Peter for my identity at any rate,’ Matt cuts across Natasha, ‘though you may find it difficult to believe.’
‘And when he does,’ Thor enters the conversation, ‘you shall not stand alone, my friend. Tell us of your plight and we shall be there to aid you.’
‘Let’s take it in turns to go through information and clean,’ Steve suggests, ‘that way everyone gets a break and can come back with fresh eyes at different points.’
There’s a chorus of laughter, and they then have to explain the story of Bucky winning the Christmas tree to the Guardians. Talk then turns to preparations and they make the plan to get the Christmas trees tomorrow. Tony notices Quill looking a little overwhelmed at the other end of the table and makes a note to talk to Wanda about it; he suspects Star-Lord might find this month a little more challenging than he bargained for.
‘I’m having FRIDAY run diagnostics on EDITH, it could be Beck used her to send information to HYDRA. In which case we’ll have a trail to follow,’ Tony adds, ‘and Shuri and I are going through all the footage of Peter’s encounters with him to see if there’s anything there that can help.’
‘Some of it are projects that needed funding, like building projects for wings of hospitals or to replace equipment; there’s education programs; there’s even some archaeological digs and historical restoration projects.’
trust the team again. Not only will we turn you and your teammates against each other, Captain, we’ll turn the
‘I don’t know him like you do, Pete,’ he replies. ‘But I won’t hide the fact I worry about you spending time with someone who is borderline insane.’
‘Honestly? Not sure. Though Rhodey and Tony are adamant he always checked to make sure there were no children running around, so it’d be
Peter pauses in his work, his head tilted to one side as he thinks, worrying his bottom lip and with a look of concentration on his face that is so familiar he’s actually beginning to wonder if Peter isn’t actually a long lost love child of Tony’s younger years. The teenager nods, bringing Bruce from his musings. ‘I think he would have done. HYDRA would have created him, if not someone else, if you guys hadn’t. AI is one of the big races right? Someone would eventually have given him some form of life, maybe not the exact way you guys did, but definitely in some way. I think, from what I’ve heard, he was
He barely has time to return the Wakandan salute before she’s grabbed him by his arm and is dragging him over to a screen. ‘Uh, Shuri? Introductions before you tear my arm off please?’
‘Yes I agree it has been enjoyable so far,’ Drax nods. ‘I am looking forwards to experiencing more.’
‘Yeah well I’m not getting in until I’ve finished looking at the scans of the weapons. So you’ll have to cope with the soldier twins alone for now.’ Ignoring Sam’s protests he heads to one of the loungers and sets his things down. He could leave reading the scans until later, but he needs an excuse to mentally prepare himself for facing the water.
‘Trust me I am far from ‘ok’ about this; but then I think I’d be the same no matter who he was interested in. I’d probably be freaking out if he found a mini-Steve to be interested in. But I’ve learned the kid is going to do whatever the hell he wants to, whether I’m ok with it or not. I’d rather respect his decisions so he’ll still come to me if something goes wrong.’
Strange adds, after a small pause. ‘Would you like to visit the Sanctum more over this year? We can work on training your powers so that you don’t have to cope with trying to process other people’s emotions as well as your own.’
There’s another pause. ‘How about we do tacos tomorrow? Say eight at our usual place? I can update you with anything then.’
‘You’re supposed to be on my side,’ the inventor grumbles. ‘And you say I get distracted but I find all the secret passageways. Have you checked for secret passageways yet, Cap?’
They look at each other in silence for an agonisingly long time, both breathing heavily. Peter is struggling to get his breathing under control and there’s tears falling down his face. Tony is obviously struggling to keep his expression neutral, but there’s pain in his eyes. Peter’s chest hurts knowing he’s put it there. He opens his mouth to say something when a noise catches his attention.
‘Thank you, Soldier,’ a woman says, standing from one of the chairs. ‘You can go, I’ll call you when it’s time for Wanda to return to her room.’
‘Yeah, my stunning good looks,’ he huffs a dry laugh. ‘Ajax was the name Francis gave himself; stupid fucker must have got it off a soap box or some shit. Francis was the main man behind the programme, or at least he headed the division that got hold of me; he was the one that organised the torture in order to get my latent mutant genes to come to the forefront. Then the sadistic fuck did it just for fun. Didn’t like it when I took out the whole operation just to try and get him to fix my face.’
‘No I got it,’ he says, putting it next to the table in a dramatic manner that would make Tony proud. ‘Man that thing is heavier than it looks.’
‘Alright, coming through people!’ Bucky moves in front and turns himself into a very effective human battering ram, parting the crowd of reporters.
‘I’m sorry I never told you about your parents,’ his voice is quiet, barely a whisper now, and it hurts to talk past the emotion he’s desperately holding back. ‘I told myself I was sparing you, but I was being selfish and sparing myself. I’m so sorry for everything, Tony.’
‘Distract him or train him?’ she raises a challenging eyebrow. ‘You’ve not told him yet about changing your will have you?’
‘Did a lot to help with the equality movements apparently. They went to Martin Luther King’s march at the Lincoln Memorial and were high profile guests there.’
‘What’s going on?’ she hisses at him as they wait just down a corridor, out of site of the bar but close enough that Peter can still hear what’s going on with his enhanced hearing.
Peter looks around, seeing that, thankfully, it’s only a small part of the facility that has been brought down on them and the majority is still standing. Already workers are running towards them, and on his HUD he can see Tony and Steve are already finding their way out. Then he catches sight of Wanda, her figure nearing the boundary and starting to disappear.
‘And the Chitauri?’ Natasha asks. Tony tries his hardest to hold in his shiver, but he knows he fails when Steve puts an arm around him and pulls him close.
‘And so were you, Buck,’ Sam’s voice is quieter now. ‘You weren’t just manipulated by HYDRA, you were captured. You were tortured and brainwashed so you couldn’t even remember your own
‘The only place you aren’t allowed without permission is my workshop,’ Tony says, standing up and stretching. ‘But then no one is.’
‘I’m sorry MJ it’s my weekend with the Stark Internship,’ he replies, feeling bad about having to let the team down.
-Barnes calm yourself! You’re safe!- Loki’s tone is urgent in his mind but all he can feel is the pain.
being there anymore. And I don’t agree with his job, it’s one of the few things we actually properly disagree on, but he is making an effort to change. I asked Weasel for some of his recent targets. All the ones he’s killed recently are gang members, firearms smugglers, drug dealers, leaders of sexual exploitation rings… he’s only going after bad people. Don’t get me wrong I’d still prefer he didn’t kill at all, but I know it’s what he does. And when we first talked about actually dating he put in all these rules because I’m, you know, younger than him, and he’s not moving on them. I tried but he’s more stubborn than any of you.’ He sighs and shrugs. ‘So, yeah.’
‘It’s Daredevil, Spidey,’ Deadpool says from behind him. ‘Papers like to call him the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen. You’re a bit far out of your normal stomping ground aren’t you Red?’
‘Anytime, kid,’ he smiles back. ‘And if you want to tell me who it is so I can rub it in Bucky’s face feel free.’
‘No one is taking the suit from him again,’ Tony says firmly, signalling for FRIDAY to stop the music.
‘Yeah we’re still waiting for the next insect to appear,’ Bucky laughs, ruffling Peter’s hair as the teenager grumbles.
‘Because you’re one of my best friends, Deadpool,’ Peter answers truthfully. ‘Now will you please take off that mask? Because there is no way Mama Rhodes is going to let you sit at the table and eat with it on, no matter how much you might look like Freddy Kreuger.’
‘Why do all my AI systems learn sarcasm?’ he pushes away from the table and makes his way towards the stairs. ‘Well, now it’s time to warn the rest of the team.’
Tony taps his cards on the table as he thinks. ‘I was pretty young at the time, we didn’t see them so much as I got older, but they were the ones to teach me to play. Used to entertain me with stories of you two as well,’ he adds with a grin.
‘Yeah it’s been alright. Same old stuff you know. Well Flash got put back onto the reserve team for the Decathlon which he wasn’t too happy about, kept trying to convince them to swap him with me seeing as I’d, you know, run off to try and stop Liz’s dad at the last competition. Not that
‘You cannot just walk in here and demand to see my patients!’ Doctor Blane is shouting as they approach Bucky’s door.
‘Oh yeah because Tony Stark is the most reliable source when it comes to appropriate language. Anyway that’s beside the point.’
,’ he mutters, leaning into the blond’s shoulder. ‘I didn’t think it was possible for him to get any more over-protective.’
‘Always knew what was going on? What’s Widow done this time?’ Bucky grins as he walks into the common area, tying his hair back.
‘You can say that again,’ his friend laughs, ‘I’m still getting used to everything not being boiled.’ Then he turns to the mercenary with them. ‘You invited anyone to Yule, Wade?’
‘That’s his information to give,’ Tony cuts across everyone else. ‘I’ll pick him up from school on Friday and bring him up here. And play nice please people.’ He looks at Bucky as he says the last part.
A/N: Hey everyone, here's your promised second update of the week. I've now seen End Game...and I'm still emotional. To everyone who has yet to see it: it is incredible and well worth the wait and I hope you enjoy it. To everyone who has seen it: my heart goes out to you.
‘Nott and Dagr shall return tomorrow for more orders, until then I think we should rest,’ Loki concludes.
‘Thank you,’ he presses a kiss to Steve’s lips, a sigh of relief and happiness leaving him. ‘Plus Bruce was happy to support him so I knew
‘Just tell us if we need to watch out for anyone. So far we’ve been able to avoid most people. There seem to be a worrying lack of guards here, but plenty of scientists.’
‘What is on your mind, Captain?’ T’Challa asks. ‘You are becoming quieter with every mention of home. Do you not want to return?’
‘I mean I want to talk to you about some things that are just between us,’ he tries again, finally looking up at her.
It’s amazing really. As soon as he stops focussing on his eyes being open and not being able to see everything becomes so much clearer. He can hear the air leaving Steve’s nose as he punches out, he can feel it’s coming for his right shoulder and he glides out of the way, half pirouetting on one foot to face where the soldier ends his attack. His hands come up into a defensive stance, ready to try and attack back on his next dodge.
‘I don’t want to talk about it alright?!’ Peter yells, finally looking at his mentor and fighting back the tears blurring his vision. There’s absolute silence in the room; Bucky and Steve are looking between him and Tony with wide eyes, because this is the first time Peter’s ever shouted at anyone. Let alone Tony.
‘Well Loki didn’t seem overly upset at the idea, and I’m not entirely sure Thor heard. He’s drunker than he’d let you believe,’ Bruce replies.
Loki takes the opportunity to drag Clint forwards once he gives Fury his drink so he’s under the mistletoe and plants a loud and messy kiss to his lips before he manages to land his punch.
Tony shakes his head with his own answering chuckle and then hands Steve three boxes and gestures to the waiting bowls. ‘Three flavours one flavour in each bowl, just keep the bags going until we’ve filled them all.’
‘Always,’ Peter grins, taking his spider emblem out of his pocket and pressing it into his chest; the nanotech hidden inside spread out across his body, encasing him in his Iron Spider suit. Out of the corner of his eye Loki glows with golden light before his Asgardian armour falls around his shoulders. Luckily he doesn’t include the cape this time. It’s not exactly stealthy.
‘Never could match you, though,’ Harry grins at him, ‘which is why Dad let me hang out with you, think he hoped some of it would rub off on me.’
Tony feels warm. As his brain slowly regains normal function he also realises something else: he feels rested. Blinking he lets his eyes adjust to the dim morning light, it must be just after dawn, and then frowns as the world moves up and down in a steady rhythm.
‘I’m not sure this is such a good-’ whatever T’Challa is about to say is cut off by Shuri dragging him over the dance floor.
‘We also need to decide what is going to happen with the Infinity Stones,’ Fury concludes. ‘The Time Stone will obviously be returned to Strange.’
Thor explains how Thanos wipes out over two thirds of the remaining Asgardians and severely injures Heimdall before Loki steps forwards and offers allegiance, using it as a cover to attack the titan; how Thanos had stopped him using the stone in his gauntlet and stabbed him, wanting to keep him alive long enough to find out where the Tesseract was. It had given Heimdall the opportunity to gather the strength to send all of them, including Loki, to Earth.
‘Shit,’ Bucky growls behind him, shoving past him to get into the room. ‘Stevie go get him, I’ll cover you on the corridor. Scott get up here and give me a hand, go scout ahead we need to clear the way to the Quinjet.’
Loki pauses and sighs. ‘I thought I had that comradery before with the Warriors Three, Sif and my brother. I was mistaken then and I do not wish to make the same mistake again.’
Wanda takes a few breaths and then holds out her hands, red light dancing along her fingers as she prepares the largest containment field she can easily maintain. She gives Tony a nod and he presses the button to set off the bomb.
‘I’m pretty sure we should be taking this more seriously if he’s actually got a psycho fan stalking him,’ Rhodes points out, finally calming down enough.
‘Hey guys this is my good friend Deadpool,’ he says as the red clad mercenary comes into view. ‘And he has never had better timing.’
,’ the soldier pouts, falling onto his back as Tony finally manages to get his top off, ‘don’t I get something for winning?’
‘We’re having a serious talk about why you decided to go black again, Baby Boy,’ the man says. ‘But for now. Who wants a glove?’
Steve rounds the corner only a few steps ahead of Bucky, the sound of a fight reaching them down the tunnel before they can see it. He almost runs into the blond’s back, barely catching himself before sending them both sprawling, instead he stumbles around Steve’s side and takes in the scene in front of him.
‘I have not seen him close to anyone in a long time, I wanted to ensure your intentions were noble.’
Dinner ends up being a very lively affair. For one thing Rhodes won’t believe Tony made dinner without needing at least five fire trucks turning up and makes a point of going to check the kitchen to make sure it’s not a blackened ruin.
‘I’m… I’m Steve,’ he replies, hesitating from automatically giving his rank and full name, ‘I’m with Captain Rumlow’s squad.’
Tony tries to ignore the knot in his stomach and sends a message to Happy. He wants the man to be on standby should Peter need help. Because if Tony knows Peter like he thinks he does, he’s going to help and from the sounds of things he may end up in over his head. He’s not sending him in without more tools. Even if he was intending on holding this particular one back until he wasn’t around to help the youngster anymore.
‘Already ordered, boss,’ his AI replies, ‘I also took the liberty of adding some drinks to the order as well. It should be here in forty five minutes, I’ll let you know when they reach the gate.’
‘Look,’ Tony interrupts the one-eyed man, ‘go and talk to him. Tell him what’s going on and let him make up his own mind. If he agrees to help, then fine, and if he doesn’t then you leave him alone and one of us will come and help. I’ll send something with Steve for you to give to Pete if he does decide to help. Agreed?’
Tony finally looks up at him and Steve’s heart breaks. There’s so much pain in those brown eyes that he does the only thing he can do. Steve reaches up, cupping one of the bloodied cheeks with his hand, running his thumb over the dry, chapped lips.
Really there’s no competition, Wade thinks as he kisses Peter again, burying the fingers of one hand in the teen’s hair and pulling him closer. ‘You’re going to be the death of me,’ he says when they pull away.
doing it. Enjoyed the parties they got me into, the wine, the girls, the attention, everything. I never even
, it’s not actually that hard. I didn’t though!’ he adds quickly, seeing Harry’s worried expression. ‘I’d have heard them crack if I had.’
Watson looks extremely relieved as he hands Rhodes the key and Tony spins on his heels. ‘Great now that’s all sorted let’s get going. We’ll leave Watson to find his missing Holmes.’
‘Which means Tony is going to pull an all-nighter and be sitting in the quinjet waiting for everyone tomorrow morning,’ Rhodes rolls his eyes.
I'm so sorry I still haven't had chance to reply to everyone's comments yet, I'm afraid this week ran away from me. I promise I will get them all responded to this week.
‘It’s never been physical before,’ Ned tries to defend him. ‘This was the first time it’s happened,’ he shrinks back as Bucky turns his dark look to him. ‘Well that I’ve seen anyway.’
‘Fine,’ Tony rolls his eyes. ‘If you don’t make sweet love to me until neither of us can walk straight I’m going to kick you out of the bedroom for a month.’ At Steve’s raised eyebrow he adds. ‘Ok a week. I wouldn’t last a month. I’d last a week.’
‘Ok you two that’s it for today. I’m not sure I can take much more,’ Natasha laughs as the two of them collapse into a laughing heap on the floor.
But if she ever wants a training session to just be a bit of fun and release some frustration, she’ll ask Tony to give her some new tech that needs testing. And that’s why she finds herself knocking on the door of the inventor’s workshop and stepping through the door as it glides open.
‘I remember Uncle Gabe being really quiet,’ Tony’s eyes are a little unfocussed as he looks back in time, ‘but I remember him being really serious for once that day. When Aunt Peggy was yelling at this guy he kneels down next to me, points at her and says to me “promise me something, Teddy”-’
‘Oh come on I’m not that bad a driver,’ he says, narrowly missing a motorcyclist as he changes lane. He notices the wide eyes and bursts out laughing. ‘Ok so I’m not the most careful driver, but I have yet to have an accident in a car I made myself.’
‘FRIDAY pull up the kid’s latest voicemail to Happy would you?’ Tony says, leaning back on the sofa.
‘Here we are,’ she says, opening a door. ‘Hi Bucky, your friend has come to visit. I’m just going to do your obs is that alright?’
‘Thanks,’ Betty’s smile grows and Peter and MJ share a knowing look over Ned’s oblivious head. Those two were so not as over each other as they think they are. ‘How are you feeling about this trip, Peter?’ Betty asks him. ‘It can’t be easy having us all descend when you’re used to working alone with the Avengers.’
There’s a ripple of laughter through the room. Then someone asks. ‘You mean after the Civil War there’s no hard feelings?’
A/N: Hi everyone. Thank you so much for all the love being shown this series! Please do keep letting me know what you think and if there is anything you'd like to see in the future.
Whatever she was about to say in response is cut off by the door opening and Peter’s heart sinks when he sees who walks in. This is not going to end well. For him.
‘Honestly Steve why are you so worried?’ the red head laughs, putting his button hole in his lapel. ‘You look amazing.’
Which really, Tony doesn’t need to know any more than that. He lifts the glass to his lips and gulps it down without a second thought. Surprisingly it’s got a nice taste, as opposed to what he was imagining. It slides down his throat easily and then pools in his stomach, a wonderful warm feeling spreading out slowly from his belly to his extremities; as it travels through his system he feels all tiredness and sickness being driven out. By the time Loki comes back he’s feeling the best he’s felt in months.
‘The Guardians are happier to trust the Avengers than us, besides Rocket seems to be in charge of their comms and I’ll be honest he’s not the easiest to discuss things with.’
‘He did found the Avengers,’ Vision points out, ‘and experience in things going wrong is often the best experience to have.’
Just as they’re about to talk some more Tony’s phone pings with a message from Wanda asking to be picked up. ‘Time to go get the kids,’ he says, pocketing his phone and heading for the door. ‘Behave yourself while Daddy’s out, and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.’
‘You’re more than welcome,’ she turns to Tony. ‘I assume I leave this particular patient out of my reports Mr Stark?’
‘I suggested it, Stark,’ Bucky says evenly. Tony looks over at him and swears he can see a glint of amusement in the other man’s eyes. Maybe they will get along after all.
Steve is quiet for a couple of moments then, in a quiet voice, he asks, ‘What was your nightmare about? Was it…did you see the shield again?’
‘Something tells me this is going to become a yearly competition,’ Natasha sighs, then winks at Peter and stands up. She meanders over to the counter via Wade, who has just come back in from the balcony, catching him just as he steps under the piece of mistletoe that Wanda had hung in the middle of the room. She gives him a quick kiss then continues to the bar. ‘I’m one ahead of you already, Barnes. Better catch up!’
Wade shrugs. ‘We haven’t got any other ideas. And I’m not sure your dear Mommy Spider would be expecting you to let us do that.’
Tony pauses, looking at the coffee in his mug. He hasn’t even thought about Christmas, but of course he’d be spending it with Steve. The only issue is neither of them have any family left so there’s nowhere to go unless he runs with Bucky’s suggestion of a remote cabin somewhere. ‘What’s everyone else doing?’ he asks, buying himself time to think. He doesn’t even know what Steve would
‘Steve!’ Tony calls out a warning, firing up his suit to grab hold of the pole before the alien can get his swing going. He plants his boots onto the pavement and uses his weight to pull it back, effectively stopping the alien, which lets out a grunt of surprise.
arm like I used to with Steve when he was still a twig when I first met him, you seriously think I’m matching him on
Wade tightens his arm around his waist and pulls him with him out of the door onto the balcony. ‘You want to tell me what’s going on in your head Baby Boy?’
‘Yeah I’m glad we did it too,’ he says, laughing as Thor raises his hands in celebration as the bonfire takes light. ‘It seems to have done everyone good to have something positive to focus on that doesn’t include saving the world.’
Drax follows next, having been over enthusiastic in his consumption earlier in the night like Clint had been. Quill follows not long after, singing to himself as Rhodes and Wade drag him to his room between them.
about trying to harm the two of them, and if any survived they then had to face his partner. Lady Spider was beautiful but even the bravest monster was scared of her for she could defeat swarms of them effortlessly, without even letting a single hair on her head fall out of place.’
‘We’re fine. Let’s get to the jet,’ Steve says, turning to look in the direction of the car just in time to see a fist coming for his face and ducking out of the way. He backs off and straightens up, shield in place to defend himself and comes to face to face with his attacker.
‘Then I suggest,’ Fury’s voice comes over the comms, ‘that you tell us what the hell we have to do to make sure that one comes true.’
‘Already had this conversation, Mr Stark,’ Peter says, finding a broken window and seeing some soldiers have cornered some students below him. ‘Not happening.’
‘Alright, Pete, something only I would know?’  his voice is calming, like Peter’s gone mad. Which doesn’t feel too far from the truth right now. Tony takes a step towards him and Peter resists the urge to step back into Wade. He
He signals Deadpool to follow him as they continue along a corridor where voices are coming from a room further down. They drop down into crouches just beside the door so they can hear what is said, and Peter sends his drone into the room to get a visual on what was happening.
Thank you so much to everyone who has come so far on this journey with me, I hope you continue to enjoy it as we get closer towards Thanos' arrival. Hope you all have a lovely Easter!
‘There is nothing more I can ask of you, my friends,’ Thor sighs, ‘nor indeed is there anything more I need from you. I only ask that you ensure you are waiting for us on our return.’
‘Nope,’ Peter grins at him. ‘Nowhere I’d rather be than home with my family. No matter how crazy they might be.’
Loki beats the doctor to replying. ‘If he is sensible and rests enough between large amounts of use he shouldn’t suffer any lingering effects. Though something tells me our doctor friend here is not one to do as he is advised.’
‘What?’ he asks, looking back up at the man and noting the tight lines that had appeared since last night.
Resisting the urge to chuckle Steve figures he better try and save their youngest recruit from this awkward conversation. He knocks on the door and opens it enough to stick his head through. ‘Tony says dinner will be ready soon kid, you better head down before he has to track you down himself.’
Tony flies out the jet, and Peter doesn’t get much chance to see where they are before Natasha’s closed the door again.
‘I’m sure I can comply if you really wish me too, but I’d rather not if it’s all the same. I can’t take you up on your offer to use the library if you’re dead. What have you been doing? Your Cloak all but attacked me when I walked through the portal it was so worried.’
‘I should have checked,’ he whimpers. ‘I should have looked. If I had, Uncle Ben could have just picked up the victim and taken him back to his station. Instead he got shot. It should have been me-’
Steve felt guilt creeping into his stomach. It seemed a lot of the issues in Tony’s relationship with his father had stemmed from him.
wanted. And all this time you’ve been wanting to wait because you’ve been trying to show me how much you actually care about me. I’m sorry. Can you forgive me?’
‘You know what Tin Can? I think maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe I should just say goodbye to you and Spidey and-’
‘Huh,’ then after a pause he asks. ‘So what else is on the family calendar protocol apart from my morning coffee?’
Thor tries to push away the stab of pain at the mention of his parents. ‘So your suggestion to stop feeling guilty about leaving you here to oversee Asgard is to get married and leave my wife to do so instead?’
‘Consider this your interview,’ Peter laughs as the two men get into the car and pull away. ‘Think you can keep up or do you need a lift?’
‘Steve-’ Tony’s finding it difficult to breathe, and not because of the metal casing embedded in his chest. There’s something almost like hope starting to press against his ribs.
The rest of his week goes fairly smoothly. It’s his birthday so he, May and Ned go to have Thai at his and May’s favourite restaurant then catch a film. Tony sends him a message saying happy birthday and that they’ll do something when he’s next up at the facility; Wanda sends him a message saying he’s getting less her ‘baby’ brother, to which he replies with something snarky.
The teenager looks round as Vision walks into his room as he’s pulling his jacket on. ‘Yeah of course you can, Vis. What do you need?’
‘Too good,’ he hears Peter grumble, but the teenager still makes his way to sit next to Wade on one of the sofas.
‘As informative as always. No news on any movement of larger groups, but there’s apparently rumours she’s trying to chase down. Nothing concrete yet except for worlds reporting people going missing and bodies being found on other planets. Once she’s got something more concrete she’ll let us know. Nick,’ Hill pauses, ‘you can’t seriously be considering starting a team to go out and have an impact on the
Clint curses and Peter’s about to celebrate when Wade grabs him and pushes him to the ground, wrapping his body around him. Peter’s about to question it when he hears the tell tale
The soldier gives a laugh. ‘Smart kid. A few more steps this way and we’ll go see Mr Hammer and your little friends are free to go back to class.’
‘They’ve got hold of another power source, I’m not entirely sure what it is but if I had to place a bet? I’d say it was something like an infinity stone.’
Tony makes a thoughtful noise. ‘I’ve thought about it, but that would mean needing to make them bigger, and they’re already at the edge of being hard to notice as it is. I could make a buddy bot to go with it that has that ability I suppose.’ After a pause he reaches for the other box. ‘Want to try the stun grenades?’
‘Is something wrong with Strange?’ he asks, getting what amounts to a nod in response. ‘Lead the way.’ It flies along the corridor and Loki hurries after it, taking out his daggers and letting his armour fall into place as he follows.
Tony sits up, startled by the intruder into his thoughts, and sees Vision standing in the doorway, the mind stone glowing on his forehead. He shakes his head as the humanoid takes a seat opposite him. ‘I will, Vision, I promise. I’m just-’
‘Glad you caught up,’ she teases, and dodges the Winter Soldier sweater he throws at her. ‘Is there really one for the every member of the team in there?’
The man’s eyes narrow and he crosses his arms. ‘Ok first: how the fuck do you know Deadpool? And second: what the fuck would you want with one of our craziest bastards?’
‘Right, yeah.’ Peter doesn’t look up as the mercenary fills him in on what he’s found; there’s nothing that points directly to where Tony is being held, but he’s got information on weapon movements and a couple of drop offs. ‘I went to a couple last night, but no one was talking much, mainly because they don’t know shit. HYDRA’s not stupid, Baby Boy, they aren’t going to tell their secrets to the regular foot soldiers. But I did get the locations of a few destinations and origins of the weapon loads so I’ll check them out and get back to you.’
‘Ugh really?’ Peter rolls his eyes. ‘You’re as bad as my family. I haven’t got my eye on anyone, Pool, so no I haven’t asked anyone out. Besides who’d want to date Spider-Man? I spend the majority of my free time swinging around a city stopping crime, not exactly great advertising for a partner is it?’
protect my best friend from bullies?’ he demands, gritting his teeth against the tears that are threatening to spill over. ‘I just- I feel so
‘Why don’t we do five rounds? We’ll get FRIDAY to keep track,’ Natasha replies. ‘Ten shots for each round.’
‘We made a deal,’ Hammer’s voice stops being smarmy and goes hard, ‘if he gave us the schematics to the arc reactor technology we’d let him go and give him back his upgrade.’
‘No I’ve just seen the looks Bucky’s been giving you. Plus I know how much this team cares about Peter.’
Strange nods, and suddenly Peter is no longer in control of his memories. He sees images flash past in front of him, all of them from when he was controlled by the Symbiote. He watches his past self attack May, twisting strangely in mid air and landing on the coffee table as he fights for control; he sees his final confrontation with the team on the bridge, and Wade diving after him, then Loki swooping in, seemingly out of nowhere, to catch him and take him back to the waiting Quinjet where Bucky was at the controls, watching just long enough to see Rhodes catch Wade before he hits the water.
He’s not sure why, but a part of him feels a twinge of excitement at the possibility of spending some more time with the nutjob. Though he’s not sure what Mr Stark would think of his new friendship.
He tightens his arm around Steve’s waist, reaching with his other one to link their fingers together. ‘You’re a bit of a sap aren’t you?’ Steve chuckles, and it helps to relax against him.
Luke, the youngest member of the squad who hasn’t been with them long just looks between everyone. ‘I…uh…I didn’t bring mine.’
Steve can’t help the warm feeling in his stomach at Tony’s words. ‘He’s also got your run away mouth.’
‘He decided to move back to New York over the summer and thought it was better if I came with him. I tried to get in touch but when I called your old apartment the lady there said you’d moved away.’
‘That depends on what you think I did, Baby Boy,’ the merc responds, bare chested and holding the stump of his arm where the hand is beginning to regrow.
Do let me know what you think of these snippets, it will be interesting to see if people like them as I may end up doing a couple more specials along the same lines if you do.
‘If your little protégé would pick up his calls I wouldn’t have to,’ Fury snaps, then sighs and rubs his forehead.
‘Got you,’ he pants, ripping open the drawer and pulling two out. He’s not taking any chances in case something happens to this one.
‘That’s literally all I know with regards his mission,’ he says defensively. ‘He makes sure not to discuss any of his missions with me until he’s had his debrief, so if he does get hold of me we talk about other stuff.’
‘Bucky,’ Loki is suddenly standing next to him, a hand on his flesh arm, ‘why are you shutting me out?’
. I mean even though we were up against Wanda and Mr Vision and all their powers. It was awesome.’ Peter’s on the phone to his aunt. Right.
‘This is decidedly more serious that you first thought isn’t it?’ Stephen raises an eyebrow at him, then waves off whatever reply Stark is about to give. ‘Later. Right now I need to sort out the transfer of my patient. You have a new arm ready I assume?’
‘Part of me really wants to knock you out right now you bastard,’ Bucky says, and Tony can’t help the grin that breaks out. ‘But everything considered, I might hug you instead.’
Everyone goes to small groups and start discussing ideas, Stephen stays by the breakfast bar, not feeling quite brave enough to force himself into one of the groups. Loki is standing not too far away from him and he notices Bucky walking up to the trickster.
Deadpool gives a harsh laugh. ‘Oh don’t be sorry, Spider-Man. It was my own fucking fault. I should have known not to leave the cocksucker alive. I should have made sure they didn’t follow me home. I should have protected her better. I’m as much to blame for her death as the guy who pulled the fucking trigger.’ He pauses before heaving another sigh and look up, straight ahead over the city rather than at the boy sat next to him. ‘When that guy had the gun to your head I couldn’t just stand there and let someone else die because of me. I know I’d promised you not to kill anyone, but all I could see was Vanessa’s body and you joining her. I couldn’t be the reason someone else died.’
‘I didn’t think there were any winners and losers in food fights,’ Sam argues, ‘unless you’re the cleaning staff of course.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Thank you so much for the wonderful comments on the last chapter, I hope you enjoy this one just as much.
‘Well now you know there’s another person you can call to come help,’ he responds, passing Peter’s phone back to him. ‘Doesn’t matter when or where, Spidey. I’ll come help if you need me to.’
‘She’s beautiful,’ the dark haired man comments, carefully taking the figure and looking at it. ‘She looks kind too, though I’m not sure I’d want to cross her.’
‘Yeah, it’s called getting one of our guys to pass you surveillance footage,’ he looks back at his screen and pulls up what he’s found. ‘Disguising it as regular checks on the security system, but there’s still evidence there that certain excerpts have been copied. I’m guessing this was then passed on to you through a contact; so I want to know: who was your contact?’
‘Ah you’ll be fine Pete,’ Tony waves him off, ‘you’re on a school trip you’re not going to be anywhere near the kind of shady spots Clint likes to spend his free time in. Your teachers have more sense than that and you’ve got better taste.’
‘But there’s more that you suspect at least,’ Natasha cuts in, shooting Bucky a warning look as he feels frustration building in his chest. Yeah it’s probably better she has this conversation, he’s going to get way too tempted to punch Wade in the face.
‘Well are you going to agree to it as well or not?’ he decides he’s had enough debating the issue. He’s worried about the mission, but he can tell from his conversation with Wade that there’s going to be more to worry about if they
‘Since like forever,’ the boy rolls his eyes at Loki and he tries not to laugh, taking a swig from his glass.
‘Couldn’t have done it without the team here, Steve. I… I never thought they’d accept me like this. Not without you here.’
Sam pops thee trunk and hands the super soldiers an axe each, letting them start to walk towards the entrance before handing Quill his one and locking the car. ‘Hey, you alright man? I imagine this is a lot to take in.’
‘So,’ Tony says, letting the helmet snap back into place, ‘who wants Squidward and who wants tall, butch and ugly?’
‘Perhaps if you paid attention to your phone you would have done?’ the sorcerer replies as he steps through a portal, Wong behind him.
‘I need you to focus on a memory of the Symbiote if you can,’ Strange tells him, ‘I need something to be able to focus on, otherwise I may be trawling through other memories that you may not want me to see.’
‘Sure thing Sergeant Barnes,’ Peter says, letting his webs lower him down until he’s on the same eye level as Bucky. ‘Until the next time you try and wind me up.’
There’s the sound of a clock timing as FRIDAY announces the start of the new year and everyone starts a chorus of ‘Happy New Year!’ Peter turns to look at everyone and sees Wanda give Vision a quick kiss on the lips, the humanoid actually managing to look surprised; Tony and Steve are sharing a kiss to welcome in the new year. So Peter does the only thing he can think of.
‘Yes thank you Wade,’ Natasha rolls her eyes. ‘Just hurry it up guys, I’d say I’m more than halfway done here and I don’t really want to be waiting around for you.’
‘Don’t worry, Nat. Me and Stevie just need a little heart to heart,’ he tells the spy, metal hand gripping Steve’s shoulder painfully tight as he steers him towards the balcony area outside the double doors.
‘I’m here,’ Wanda says through the comms and Tony sees a flash of red through the door behind the terrorist.
‘Maybe I’m just hoping I can bury you under enough stuff that you can’t come back and haunt me again, Wade,’ Francis taunts him, spinning two axes in his hands.
The two of them stay like that for a while, dozing in the warmth of the morning. Steve has found the ice invading his dreams less and less since he’s started sharing Tony’s bed. Eventually Tony sighs. ‘We should probably get up and face the day. What time is it?’
Steve simply nods. Tony speaks up from next to him. ‘I hope you are right, ma’am. I’d hate for one of our team to be put in such a situation again, and I hope you can understand when I say there would be serious consequences.’
‘I always thought you were more old school than this,’ Tony comments when Steve pulls away, ‘I wasn’t expecting a kiss until at least date two.’
‘Ok,’ the doctor nods, ‘Scott, Rocket and Bruce I want you three here to guard the flag. Scott stay small where they can’t see you, Bruce I want you to be eyes next to the flag and guarding it. Rocket I want you hiding around the obstacle course ready to create mayhem when they arrive.’
Peter groans and buries his head in his hands. He knew she was going to bring up what had happened with Lisa during his week-long interview at some point, he just wishes it wasn’t in front of the whole team right before he’s about to go on a school trip.
‘And Peter? Try to remember we all love you. I’m sorry I keep treating you like a kid, I don’t mean to. In my defence though, I did meet you when you were fourteen-’
‘What now?’ he asks, sleepiness making him slightly irritable. He isn’t prepared for the short burst of speed the mercenary puts on to wrap an arm around him, pressing his lips against his. Peter’s too shocked to register what’s happening before Wade’s pulling away. The man just points above his head with a sheepish look on his face.
Really he should have worked out there was more to their friendship, at least on Steve’s side, back then. But hindsight and all that.
He’s probably not alright really, as he feels himself slipping from his seat; he thinks he feels Harry catching him, but he’s not completely certain.
‘Sorry,’ he looks down and leans against one of the tables. ‘I just…I didn’t want everything I knew about you to be from what others said, because I knew from that conversation alone they didn’t really know you. I didn’t want you to feel like I’d been spying on you or anything, especially since that’s all I’d heard and I hadn’t asked them for any more information. I just…’ he sighs and wraps his arms around his waist, ‘I wanted you to trust me enough to tell me about yourself.’
Wade just shrugs and pulls the sleeve of his suit up, revealing the already healing marks. ‘The only plus side to cancer is when you get healing abilities trying to get rid of it.’
‘No need to shout, Captain,’ Strange sighs as he and Wong appear at the top of the staircase, ‘we are right here and already aware thanks to Stark’s system.’
‘Oh you are a good boy, Tony,’ she says to him as her son leads up her up the steps and into the facility.
Before either of them can say anything else there’s a soft thump from behind them. ‘Hiya fellas,’ Natasha grins at them, ‘just thought I’d drop by.’
‘Kid if you think a banana split is going to work then be my guest and take it down to her,’ Bucky says. ‘But I’m having FRIDAY record it if it goes wrong.’
‘Why are we not just letting the monster tire himself out and return to normal by himself?’ Nebula questions as they walk through the forest.
‘Wanda you need to move,’ he groans as he feels himself losing the battle. Just as his knee is about to give out and he’s about to sink to the floor the alien suddenly goes tense in front of him and begins falling backwards.
Tony laughs at the look on Steve’s face. ‘Oh babe, seriously? How have you not realised this about those two? I’d worked it out when I first brought Wade here on Christmas Eve.’
Peter sighs. ‘Yeah I understand sir. I’m really sorry I’ve not been as focussed as normal. I promise I’ll be better. Is there any chance you can wait until tomorrow to send the note to Aunt May? I’d like to be able to tell her myself tonight if that’s alright?’
‘Oh my god!’ Peter buries his head in a pillow. ‘That’s it we’re cancelling the school trip. He’s going to out me within a day!’
‘We are not needed for celebrations at the facility for another two hours, any longer and the team will start to come here wondering what’s happened, which I imagine we do not want.’
‘You think I don’t know that?’ his friend demands, ducking back behind one of the cars. ‘We can’t get through this shooting, there’s no break in it.’
‘When Tony asked me what had happened he was furious. I’ve truly never seen him that angry. He asked me for the name of the coffee shop, and I told him but asked him not to do anything or it could make the situation worse. He reluctantly agreed once Colonel Rhodes gave me his support. The next time he took Wanda to her demonstration at the military base he stopped at a different café on the way home. Apparently it took a good ten minutes of arguing and cajoling before he managed to get her to go in, it was only when he told her he used to stop there regularly with his mother that I think she agreed.
‘T’Challa!’ he hears Okoye shout. Looking over to see the king kneeling next to Nakia’s prone form as soldiers bear down on him.
Wade’s been making a point of helping to clear up as much as possible, not wanting any of the team to not think he was grateful for being included. Before Tony leaves to follow Steve he grabs the man’s arm and asks for a quick word.
‘That’s true,’ Nick says, ‘and the main focus for now should be Thanos. You read through and see if you’re happy with everything suggested, let me and T’Challa know if there’s anything you think should be changed or if you have any questions. Then let
‘Oh I wasn’t saying he wasn’t at fault for it, Dr Banner, I know that both you and he worked to give Ultron the chance to come to life,’ Peter sighs in relief as one arm comes free, ‘ah that’s so much better! Gah!’
‘I don’t know he finally seems to have knocked some sense into you,’ she retorts. ‘Besides he went easy on you.’
I'm afraid this is the last of the bonding chapters with Peter and the team for a while, but next chapter does see a return of everyone's favourite loud-mouthed mercenary so I hope you'll forgive me.
‘Anything except sleep with me,’ he can just make out Peter’s mumble. Steve groans next to him and Tony pats him on the shoulder. Poor Steve probably doesn’t want to be involved with this conversation, but Tony’s going to find it hilarious. Whilst obviously being very supportive to his inebriated, under-age, basically adopted son and protégé.
Valkyrie tries to hold back her laughter, and only lets a snort of amusements escape before trying to get rid of the smile on her face as Peter frowns up at her. ‘Thanks. I just got rid of the last lot of bruises!’
There’s a convoy of three vehicles just pulled in. One is a longer truck, the other two are SUVs. A motorbike pulls in behind them and the rider turns the engine off, pulling the helmet off and turning to the men climbing out of the SUVs.
‘Yeah, but we agreed it was better to finish repairing the facility and get that all up and running again before we start on the house.’
‘Either way did you see those two interacting after the presentation had been given? It’s so sweet! Just what a father and son relationship should be-’
‘Shit! Cap we got incoming!’ Clint says. ‘One vehicle heading this way at speed. We need to go now if we’re going to get away without a fight.’
Tony sighs. ‘Yes I know. But we have to remember Peter has taken on super villains, he’s a superhero in his own right, and he is nearly old enough to be making this decision himself. He’s not stupid and he
‘Are you ever going to confirm that your friend is the Devil vigilante or am I going to have to sit here and resist the urge to call Tony with this information?’
‘To be fair, Buck,’ Steve adds from where he and Tony are sat on a sofa, ‘he did help us get Tony out because Peter asked him to. Maybe he has turned over a new leaf.’
‘Tony I know I don’t have any right to ask but-’ Bucky pauses and, for the first time ever, Tony sees him fidget. ‘Can we go and visit your parents? Their graves I mean, I… I’d like to say I’m sorry in person before I have to go back.’
‘I said the same thing, but he’s stubborn,’ she agrees, ‘I think he still wants to prove himself to be part of the team, despite what we tell him.’
Matt just sits in silence for a couple of moments, then he nods. ‘Alright I’ll see what I can find out when I go out tonight. Put your number in my phone and I’ll call you with anything I find out.’
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you enjoyed this chapter - we're only two away from the end now. Thank you so much to everyone who is reading this story, and especially to those of you leaving comments. Please do let me know what you think, and if you have any requests for any other fairytales.
'Hey Pete, we need your help with a mission. Suit up and meet us at this address when class is over.' There's an address after it a couple of blocks from his school.
‘You did well for yourself, though. Beautiful wife, successful company, and a great kid. Mind you, I always thought you were as much a man out of time as me and Steve are now; just you should have been here in the future and us in the past. I dread to think what you could have accomplished with the advances today. Maybe finally got that flying car to work,’ Bucky gives a small chuckle.
‘Well,’ Peter scratches the back of his head. ‘I didn’t really want to go for any of the really big names, you know? But I wanted to go for someone close to them. Like an adviser or something. Someone who was an influence on them, but not necessarily in the spotlight themselves. I just think that’d be much more interesting.’
‘You know what I think?’ he muses after a couple of moments. ‘They say the people closest to you are the ones that hurt you most, because they know
‘Bucky on me,’ Steve’s barks the command through the ear piece. ‘Where are you Scott? We’ll be with you soon.’
‘Of course my king,’ she replies, bowing her head and then turning and shouting instructions to her two fellow soldiers.
Peter shrugs. ‘He says he’s been sorting out Christmas presents. I’ve been trying not to get in the way if I’m honest.’
‘I do apologise, Valkyrie, I’m afraid the last barrel of mead goes to the Falcon,’ Loki grins at her, trying not to notice the flash of hurt in the soldier’s eyes as he walks past. Perhaps leaving him to last had not been the most sensible idea.
take you again,’ Loki’s voice is venomous, ‘and if they try, I shall bring the full might of Jotunheim down on them.’
Bucky tries to push his own rage away and looks around the warehouse, it’s not burning as badly as the other buildings are, and it should stay mostly standing by the time the flames have died out. He makes his way behind some crates, trying to ignore the heat and pulls part of his suit up to cover his mouth. Apparently Tony had made sure everyone had these in their suits so they can filter smoke, the guy really was a genius. Taking his rifle from his shoulder he starts to prepare it for a shot at Francis. If he knows about Peter and Wade’s relationship he’s too dangerous to let go.
‘No wait!’ everyone turns to stare at Peter who sinks back into the chair as if he wants it to swallow him whole.
‘That sounds like a challenge to me,’ Bucky enters their conversation, putting an arm around Peter’s shoulders. ‘What do you guys think?’
He puts a hand on her shoulder. ‘You don’t need to understand it right now, and anyway Christmas means different things to different people; the meaning can change for you anyway. I always used to think it was just another excuse to get drunk and party, and it’s only really been since spending it with the team that I’ve started to look at it the same way Peter does. For me it’s also a time to spoil everyone when they can’t complain I’m spending too much on them.’
‘Perhaps when I return, the sorcerer and I can help her improve her ability to cope with the upper limits of her power,’ Loki suggests. ‘Between us we should have a good idea of what she can do.’
‘Hey Cap,’ he says, not looking up from where he’s rooting through the cupboards. ‘What do you fancy for dinner tonight? It’s my turn to cook, unfortunately for all of you.’
‘Off?’ Steve supplies. ‘I know what you mean. Thought perhaps it was just our aversion to cold confined spaces but…’
‘I thought you were supposed to be recruiting, Stark,’ Secretary Ross spits at him. ‘Or is that something else you’ve failed to do?’
Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos on this story. I did have a review left on another site asking for a double update this week just as I was getting everything ready to post. Now let it never be said I don't give you what you ask for: so here's a double update coming your way!
His excitement only grows as he catches sight of a familiar red clad figure waving at him from a rooftop. Grinning to himself, he changes the direction of his swing and lands in front of the mercenary with a slightly more dramatic somersault that usual.
Tony frowns and looks down at his chest. His shirt is ripped and there’s gouges in his chest where the arc reactor used to be. ‘Huh. Did I do that?’
‘Thanks buddy,’ he drops down as he finishes hanging the last part of his garland and makes his way over to the box Steve brought in, Nebula joins him.
Bucky bursts out laughing and Steve’s head falls to the table. ‘Of course,’ he grumbles. ‘Damn jerks.’ When he’s recovered enough from his embarrassment, he lifts his head and asks, ‘what else you do remember about them, Tony?’
‘You got it,’ the raccoon cackles, as Scott shrinks down and Bruce bends to pick him up so he can perch on his shoulder.
‘I swear to god, Wade Wilson, one day I am going to leave you webbed halfway up the Empire State Building and I’m not even going to be sorry when I come back to get you a week later.’
‘You check on everyone else, I’ll go find out what’s going on. Keep an eye on Bucky and Wanda.’ Tony stands up, his Iron Man suit already forming over his body and flies towards the hole in the building just as black clad soldiers swing in through the debris.
‘Come on,’ he says, breaking the embrace and taking Wade’s hand, ‘whatever it is we can face it together. Like always?’
Tony places a comforting hand on her shoulder. ‘No one manages it first time,’ he tells her. ‘Remind me to show you the video footage from when I made the Mark II, there’s a reason DUM-E is no longer allowed near a fire extinguisher.’ She gives him a small smile. ‘The question I should be asking you is: do you think it
‘I’ll have less of an impact on the balance,’ he answers, jumping down and landing dead centre on the platform, only causing it to spin rather than to tip. As Steve lands next to him, Peter scrambles to accommodate the shift in weight, ending up closer to the edge of the platform. He manages to grab hold of the next monkey bar and pulls himself up, pretending to struggle, as Steve grabs the next one along, and they repeat this for the next two platforms.
‘Get rid of this lieutenant, same as the other one,’ Steve says, ‘then we need to get back to the facility and work out how to keep us all safe while we see where Thanos is going to strike next.’
‘That’s the one! Anyway I better go, he’ll be coming out soon and it’ll probably seem weird if I’m talking to myself.’ He ignores the brief chatter that starts up, mainly from Bucky, and looks over at Matt.
‘No,’ he lengthens the vowel. ‘Why would you think that?’ His face is a picture of wide-eyed innocence.
‘I’m afraid, Anthony,’ Hammer says, voice growing more oily as a satisfied smirk crosses his face. ‘That you’ll be a little too busy to worry about little old me.’
‘Mister Parker,’ Dr Hill greets them as they enter, ‘I was told to expect you. I would say it’s been too long since I last saw you, but that’s a good thing really.’
‘Dr Higgs is with him now,’ Peter explains, ‘she’s said it will take a bit of time but she’s hopeful he can pull through. She said she assumes she’s not to talk about this unless you tell her otherwise.’
‘Agent Natasha is approaching for her morning cup of coffee as well, please replace the pot so I can get her blend prepared.’
‘Was there not a private investigator who dispatched someone with mind control abilities? What about looking into them?’ the German representative asks.
‘You know, if you wanted to let off some steam, I’m sure I could have found some more entertaining ways of doing that.’
‘You mean you didn’t actually cause her to have all her hair cut off?’ Peter asks, looking over at the god.
Tony lets out a breath of laughter as the other two come down the stairs. ‘Yeah well I knew someone who once told the government to go screw themselves and it seemed to work out alright for them. Thought I’d give it a go.’ After a pause he adds. ‘And I’ve always been badass, you just never admitted it.’
‘What? You’d be perfect for the horror role! You apparently have the face for it, and you’ve got all the killer fighting moves. You could be the next big bad,’ Peter laughs, cautiously crawling back up the wall, staying just out of reach of the merc.
‘Normally yes,’ he replies, taking the offered can, ‘but something tells me you’ve already had several death threats over the past twenty-four hours.’
have chosen you over Steve. Now don’t get me wrong I don’t want to break them up or anything, those two work well together and they’re happy and I don’t want that to end. What I don’t get is why
‘You won’t be,’ Steve reassures him. ‘Besides she’s going to need your help as well, Pete. There’s a lot of research still to get through and, despite being
‘Boss you might want to pause the game,’ FRIDAY’s voice interrupts as they start the final lap. ‘Sergeant Barnes is bringing a visitor up.’ Tony sighs and pauses the game, causing a series of protests to emanate from the other players. They’re still grumbling when Bucky enters followed by Sharon Carter.
‘Want to avoid this Wilson?’ Clint growls, picking another knife from the block on the side. Before he can even lift his arm to throw it, the archer’s flying side-ways to land in a heap by the windows. ‘What the hell just happened?’ he groans, then his eyes go wide as he sees his attacker.
‘I’ll do my best. But if Steve starts blowing up HYDRA again, I might not be able to avoid it on the news.’
Stark sighs and slumps into a chair, taking out his phone. ‘Sorry, Barnes, I need to make a very important call. Then I’ll explain what the fuck is going on.’
He convinced May to let Ned stay round the night before, the two of them were up late organising their own version of what Peter had seen at the facility. He’d told Ned the team had worked out that they must be in New York or the general vicinity, and all routes in and out of the city were being monitored so there was no way they’d managed to get him out without their knowing.
Tony looks down at the tablet in his hands in amazement, trying to work out all the emotions he’s feeling over the gesture. Steve had seen he was going stir crazy, had decided to go against Pepper’s instructions, and was encouraging Tony to
‘Oops, sorry Parker, didn’t see you there,’ Flash’s mocking voice makes him groan. ‘I expected you to be carrying a tray of coffees for your superhero bosses. I mean that
Tony allows himself a small smile. ‘Goodnight, Bucky. Put the gun away, yeah? You’re making FRIDAY nervous.’
‘The thing is, Peter is the closest thing I’m ever going to get to a son. I love that kid. So the fact that someone looks at him the way you do? It both scares me and makes me happy in equal measure. You can look after him both as Peter and as Spider-Man, and you’re now a part of both parts of his life. That was his choice and I have to accept that. I do accept that.’ He pauses and turns to look at the mercenary again. The scarred man looks equal parts shocked and terrified and Tony wonders if he’s perhaps been a bit mean springing this on him. ‘But I will say this only once, Wade Wilson,’ he lets his voice turn hard, ‘if you hurt him in any way I swear to any and every god listening that I
For the first fifteen minutes or so everyone does really well at sticking to the ‘no powers’ rule. And then Steve kicks the ball to Peter with a little more force than he maybe should have done and the kid may have got a bit carried away and danced a little more intricately around Sam than was strictly necessary which resulted in a goal; Bucky may have been a little enthusiastic in his celebrations with the kid, and Wanda decided to take matters into her own hands. Or powers.
‘I suppose Tony has you believing that Ultron is all his fault right?’ he asks once he returns with the chair.
‘No,’ the blond replies, coming to lean on the railing next to him, ‘I’m here to see if my best friend is alright.’
The team exchange looks and Peter tries to keep his hands from trembling as he feels his anger rising.
Peter yawns as their Chemistry teacher drones on and on about something he’s given up listening to about half an hour ago. He taps his pencil on the table in an attempt to hold off death from boredom, but after the fifth nudge from Ned in his ribs he takes pity on his friend and stops.
The next evening Peter is sat up on a rooftop catching his breath after a particularly busy patrol; he’s just finishing his call to Happy to leave his report when he senses the other man behind him.
Thank you so much to all my readers, and to those of you who leave reviews - I do love some of the discussions I've been having in response to some of these reviews. Honestly? The reaction to this story has completely blown me away: 154 comments, 248 kudos and 58 bookmarks! I honestly cannot thank you all enough, you are so wonderful!
As always do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see in the future, or any characters you would like me to try and bring in.
‘If he’s able to he’ll join us later.’ A cheer interrupts him as Valkyrie comes away victorious and sits on a stool, smugly drinking from her mug.
Unfortunately I am now going down to one chapter uploaded a week seeing as I'm now caught up with where I am on fanfiction.net. If I get five or more reviews one week though I might do a surprise mid-week upload - just to inspire you to review if you want the chapters quicker!
‘He’s alright,’ Wanda says, though her tone betrays her edge of doubt, ‘FRIDAY would know if he wasn’t right?’
‘I don’t know what you mean to imply,’ he grins back. Natasha just laughs and leans against the wall next to him, drinking from her water bottle as she takes a break from her own training.
‘You going to just stand there all afternoon or you actually going to do something?’ Natasha asks him during one such day that Tony has come down to the gym to get some training in. Only Steve and Bucky are already sparring and Tony may have got a bit distracted.
‘Then Flash decided to try and make out Peter isn’t as involved with the Avengers as he actually is,’ MJ continues.
‘Yes,’ Steve sighs, then heaves a laugh. ‘But they’ve had so little time to themselves recently I can’t blame Wade for wanting to drag Peter off for some one-on-one time. Come on, let’s get the cocoa heating ready for when everyone gets back.’
‘Yes Fury is joining us for Christmas,’ Natasha says. ‘And T’Challa and Shuri are going to come over for lunch and then stay through to the evening; he’s also going to see if Ororo would like to join us.’
‘Stay here,’ he tells him, voice soft, and goes to get the first aid kit. Neither of them speak when he returns and starts tending to the various wounds on Tony’s body. When he finishes its Tony that breaks the silence.
‘We’ve got flankers,’ Rhodey points out, and they turn to see a group running around the outside of the shield, heading towards the lab where Vision, Shuri, Fury, Wanda, Bruce and the guards are waiting.
The team are forced to be spectators as their youngest member faces his newest enemy, and plans are made to regroup.
Now what was next? Oh yeah! Alternative take on Infinity War and let’s save time by saying: Battle of Wakanda with all the heroes there; contrived reason to get Guardians to turn up; Gamora’s still dead. So’s Vision. Banner can now Hulk out. Storm turned up – because that’s not even more contrived than the rest of this shit is it? But hey at least the rest of the spandex squad isn’t there, just her and her tribe. Basically an excuse for the author to show she’s done some research into the comics. Big deal.
Wanda considers this, Tony waiting patiently beside her. Eventually she nods. ‘I think I should be able to. Considering what we’ve been doing with the other aspects of my powers, I
Valkyrie pauses. ‘I’m not really sure what it was at first. Maybe it was Loki reminding me of the memories of facing Hela; maybe it was hearing she was free again and it was the rage that the one who had killed my lover was back; maybe I was just tired of being lonely. Whatever it was I decided to do something for someone other than me for the first time in centuries, decided I was going to be part of a team again.’
‘Huh, I’m so remembering that for the future,’ Peter responds, sending his webs to catch hold of one of the alien’s fists, and swinging around one of the thickest trees in the park to secure the other end of the webbing around it. ‘Let’s hope that holds the one arm for a bit. Where’s Steve?’
‘You’d think sending the two strongest members of the team to get the tree was the sensible idea,’ Tony muses, ‘apparently it’s the- what in the hell?!?’
‘Clint and Laura are going to bring the kids over on Christmas Eve and then Laura will take them to her parents before New Year,’ Natasha adds.
Peter presses the end call button and heads towards the platform. ‘Sorry, Wade,’ he mutters, pulling up the map function on his phone, ‘but I can’t sit back and do nothing, and we’re going to need all the help we can get.’
‘I don’t. But I had a demonstration earlier and asked Tony if I could come pick you up afterwards so Happy drove,’ she explains. ‘Come on he’s waiting for us. Is he always this impatient?’
‘Clint,’ Natasha sighs, bending down to check on him where he’s rubbing the spot on his head that connected with the boiler. ‘I guess he didn’t get the memo this morning.’
‘What if we know we can beat them?’ Nebula asks as she ducks a bit of dough and passes her own cookies to Wanda.
Natasha is claimed by a young looking CEO from some company Steve doesn’t catch the name of and the three couples make their way to the dancefloor. He looks up in surprise again as the band that’s been hired to play starts playing a familiar tune.
‘T’Challa,’ Steve greets the king warmly, ‘good to see you, and sorry you couldn’t make it at Christmas.’
Before anyone else can respond Tony and Steve enter the common area; as Tony goes to get them some drinks Steve raises an eyebrow at the slouched figure of his childhood friend. ‘Ok, anyone want to explain why Bucky’s sulking?’
He activates the suit and has the mask dragged back to reveal his face; staring straight at Wanda he lets himself sink into a memory, knowing if this doesn’t work to break her control then nothing will.
‘From what I saw on the way in I’d say we’re near Long Island,’ Clint says, looking at him out the corner of his eye.
‘I guess…I’ve grown used to it? As in now I’ve grown used to it and it’s not freaking me out so much I kind of like having it. I guess…I don’t feel so lonely anymore, knowing I don’t have to explain to someone everything that’s going through my head. It’s also nice to know that someone can tell if, you know, things start going back to how it was before in there.’ He taps his head with a finger. ‘Back when HYDRA had me.’
‘You did well to fight it like you did,’ the man comments. Then they are back in the library at the Sanctum.
talking shop tonight,’ Tony says, making the Captain pout. ‘Someone give the poor kid some clothes to change out of his suit and let’s get this party started.’
Wade runs a hand over his bald head, still not looking up as he answers. ‘Look I don’t know anything for certain, Cap, but if it’s what I think it is I can’t have Pete anywhere near it.’
Still the hands won’t let him go, but now he has air he has more strength to fight back. To save Yinsen. Voices are shouting at him but he gave up trying to understand the words not long after he was taken. He always got the general gist.
‘The security is not as good as they think it is,’ Wade shrugs. ‘Don’t worry I’ve got all the gaps covered.’
‘It’s not that simple,’ Wong interjects. ‘If he tells us too much we could end up on the wrong path and lose regardless.’
‘Our top bidder is Stark Industries CEO, Miss Pepper Potts. Come up here Miss Potts,’ Pepper glides through the crowd, with a smile wearing a beautiful yellow dress. ‘Mind if I take a guess Miss Potts and say you might be choosing your boss to dance with?’
Lautenus barks. ‘Says the one who tried to destroy his own race. Now FIGHT ME!’ He aims a blast of ice at Loki, which the trickster manages to block with his magic, sending the blast flying into the ceiling. ‘You truly are a coward!’ Lautenus crows. ‘Using magic to fight me instead of your true Jotun form. You are-’
‘Do you ever shut up?’ Wanda asks, not quite able to believe there’s someone alive who can talk more than Tony Stark. He snaps his mouth shut, looking down at the floor and she can’t help but feel bad.
‘Everything is absolutely fine,’ he reassures her, ‘I don’t know why you assume the world is ending every time I call you.’
‘Right…thank you,’ Steve says, trying to take all the information that’s just been delivered in the most bored tone he thinks he’s ever heard come out of someone’s mouth. He heads back towards the elevators and pushes the call button.
‘Is this a good time for me to arrive?’ Pepper laughs as she joins them, taking the last available seat.
Deadpool claps a hand over his eyes and half turns away. ‘Stop talking, Spidey and put your mask back on. You
‘No apologies,’ the sorcerer cuts him off. Before he can say anything else there’s a knock on the door and Tony comes in.
And really, Tony muses, as they start on their third carol, he can’t think of a time when he was more proud of the team than he is right now.
His mood darkens. ‘Sif realised Thor was keeping a secret from them and she hated not knowing everything to do with him, and she convinced him to tell her. She went straight to Odin and told him I’d hidden a monster in my room; we were caught bringing Fenris back in after taking him out for exercise and Odin ordered him killed. Mother tried to convince him to let us keep the wolf but he wouldn’t listen to her.’
I'm posting a little early this week as I'm away this weekend and didn't want you to think I'd forgotten you! Have a lovely week everyone :)
‘He’s just scared you’ll be so much better than him and he won’t be able to keep up,’ Natasha tells her, turning her back to the teenager and winking at Wanda. She tries to keep her face neutral and she nods through Peter’s spluttered denials.
‘Yeah, they do. You got a problem with that speak to Mr Stark. Until then you leave Deadpool to me and get back to Hell’s Kitchen. You look after your neighbourhood and I’ll look after mine. You need a hand with anything you let me know. Until they stay out of my neighbourhood.’
Bucky grins as they climb in the car. ‘Perfect. Tony and I are trying to convince Steve to let us play tonight. We can teach you and then Mr Grumpy over there has no reason to complain.’
Vision smiles slightly and nods, standing up to leave. ‘Not that you’ll need it, but good luck Tony. I hope Captain Rogers appreciates what you’ve been doing as much as we do.’
First off I am so sorry to everyone who has commented and I haven't yet responded to, I'm making it my top priority this weekend so should hopefully get round to at least some of you by then. I really do appreciate you all taking the time to leave a comment about the story and feel terrible that I haven't yet got round to responding to you all.
‘The Weapon-X programme?’ Natasha asks from across the table. Peter is conscious that everyone has gone quiet, listening to Wade’s story.
‘Doctor Strange is going to help me go through Venom’s memories,’ Peter’s voice is quiet, but determined, ‘he was taken by HYDRA so maybe he learnt something when they had him.’
‘You know most kids my age worry about spending their summer holiday either trying to find a girlfriend or hook up with some hot European girl. I get to wonder if someone’s going to try and get me to give them what my assassin cross superhero friend owes them. Wonderful,’ he sighs.
‘Well, I was wondering if you’d be happy for us to start having Peter up to the facility every two weeks from now on? Now that the rest of the team is back.’
‘When they are older you can explain to them what happened, and why there are some things that are harder to forgive than others. I can say one thing, Barton: you managed to keep your family a secret from me even when I had control of your mind. That in itself shows the lengths you will go to ensure their safety and happiness. I do not doubt you will always be able to find a way to resolve any issues they face.’
‘Wait what? Really?’ Steve goes from looking fairly comfortable to terrified in the space of a few seconds.
‘Very funny, Barnes,’ she rolls her eyes. ‘Sam was actually talking about a teacher he had in school.’
Steve leans back in his armchair, smiling as he listen to Rhodes, Sam and Bucky exchanging war stories. He enjoys listening rather than contributing his own; most of his are well documented and it’s nice to hear stories from a more ‘normal’ perspective rather than incredibly dangerous missions. Plus he gets to see his childhood best friend relax more around the team. During the day he’s always more aware of how he acts and what he says, especially in front of the daytime staff at the facility. He’s not even sure Bucky’s left the compound since he arrived in America.
Peter waits until one or two get past Iron Man and he starts webbing up the helicopter’s rotor blades, effectively grounding the one. He’s about to pull the same stunt on the second when Tony comes flying past and takes care of it.
‘Nothing gets past you does it, Mama?’ he smiles and relaxes back into the sofa. ‘I’m just glad to be home.’
In the end Wanda insisted on escorting Sharon from the premises. Bucky had given him a smile and nod before following them out; whether to give Sharon a piece of his mind, or ensure Wanda let the woman leave in one piece he wasn’t sure.
Nick nods. ‘We’ll also ensure not one single person has access to all the information within the organisation, hence the suggestion for a leadership team.’
‘Or you could take her and still leave me in charge,’ Valkyrie shrugs. ‘Unless you don’t think I can handle it?’
He sits and thinks for a moment, opening the one report on his desk that shows Spider-Man and Deadpool taking on Beck. Now, apparently, affectionately known to the public as Mysterio. He chuckles. The public do like their superheroes to have appropriate names, and their villains. He wonders what they will call him when they learn of his true existence.
It should have been easier to fight Thanos when he only had one hand. Apparently not. The Titan was determined to get his gauntlet back, and unfortunately Wade was winding him up.
T’Challa chuckles and shakes his head. ‘I was going to suggest we ask Shuri to come and see if there is anything she can do to help you remove the arc reactor if that was something you still wanted to do?’
‘You alright?’ Tony asks, voice on the edge of slurring after the amount of alcohol he’s drunk today. Though he’s still much more towards the ‘tipsy’ side of the scale than most of the others. Damn the man can hold his drink.
‘Yeah tell me about it,’ Peter groans, stretching his shoulder back. ‘I’m still not sure what that tree is made of, but it certainly isn’t wood.’
‘Yeah, you ended up being his childhood hero,’ Rhodes smiles at the look on Steve’s face. ‘Apparently he even dressed up as you one Hallowe’en to go trick-or-treating with kids from his school. Howard had your old shield from when you were doing the shows and let Tony use it for his costume.’
‘I’m leaving you Stark Industries. Leaving you basically everything,’ Tony repeats. ‘Steve and Pepper have their own settlements, so do the rest of the team, but after that everything is yours. Including SI. Nat made a good point that by not telling you I wasn’t giving you the chance to learn more about SI if you wanted to; so that’s what this is Pete. If you want you can start to get involved in SI, you can learn about the different parts in the company and you can have a say in what projects we do and don’t take on. Or you can do what I do-’
‘No. I’m the Asset,’ he argues, then breaks away by headbutting Loki. The trickster curses and staggers back.
A/N: Hey everyone! So, I really hope you don't hate me for the argument between Peter and Wade? Because I still love you all, especially my reviewers! So yeah, things have kind of come to a head, because we all knew Deadpool was going to kill someone eventually and Spider-Man wasn't going to like it.
‘We have a very vocal ally within the UN,’ he explains as they all follow him towards the rooms they’d had before. ‘The king of Latveria is a strong supporter of the new Accords and his ambassador has been very supportive. They are not a large country, but steadily gaining in prosperity and influence and have expressed similar concerns to those I raised. Other smaller and less influential countries have now gained confidence in expressing their own reservations because of this and we are gaining ground.’
‘The looking through my mind. It won’t hurt will it? I mean it didn’t hurt when anyone else did it but I don’t know if that’s just because I was still a little out of it.’
The only problem from Tony’s point of view is that Ross has been insisting he make more of his reports in person and as, for some reason, Bucky feels more comfortable going through the memories with Tony present, it’s setting them back with meeting the time scale.
‘Miss Romanoff?’ MJ addresses the super-spy apparently not intimidated one bit. ‘Is there any chance Peter can do the internship next weekend? We were planning to do something with the Decathlon team tomorrow as it’s the only weekend everyone can do for over a month.’
She laughs again. ‘I think Steve would find it easier to understand if that were the case. But no I don’t. I’m just curious as to what happened, all things considered I wasn’t expecting you two to get along as well as you are.’
‘He’s the only person Tony can tell you the exact birthday of,’ Rhodes says. ‘Well apart from Steve, but
‘You will find the payments were made by an anonymous source,’ the humanoid replies. ‘Technically speaking, as I have JARVIS’ data memories as part of me I suppose you could say I made those payments. But Tony is the one who organised the nursing home and the payments for it. He was still looking after Peggy Carter even though they hadn’t spoken in years. I imagine her estate was fairly large, which you all got a share of. You can thank him for that.’
Steve comes over whilst Bruce begins his explanation, this time Shuri being more cooperative to help. ‘How’s it been so far, Pete?’ he drops his voice low so no one can overhear.
‘Let me see it!’ Natasha laughs, doubling over at the picture of Loki’s helmet sporting a more reindeer antler design than the usual sleek ones.
‘Pete,’ Sam cuts across the teenager’s response, ‘don’t worry about it alright? We promise to keep your Spider-Man identity secret.’
He nearly misses him, but something makes him look up on his way out of the one hanger and he spots a rather dejected looking shape sat on the ceiling.
‘We better get back to the fight, Stark,’ Strange says, landing next to him, ‘Thor will need our help after snapping us back.’
‘Not to mention there’s an indestructible merc hanging around somewhere,’ Wanda mutters, thankfully it doesn’t seem that any of the lawyers hear her.
have used his webs to grab the last set of monkey bars that’ll take him back to dry land, but that would mean revealing Spider-Man just for the sake of the assault course.
‘That’s his third. Apparently I still need to let him have more because we have to face more department stores.’
Out of the debris come two figures, one who looks like he could rival the Hulk, and the other looking like some weird Lovecraftian cosplayer.
‘I called you my love and you ran,’ Loki’s voice is quiet. ‘I never thought you would be scared of me, Winter Warrior.’
Peter presses his knee against Wade’s under the table. It was the one question he’d been too nervous to ask himself, knowing how self-conscious the merc was about them. Wanda catches his eye, and turns to her boyfriend. ‘Vis, I don’t think we should-’
‘You expect me to know every intern that comes through our doors when I’m busy Avenging?’ Tony asks, wishing Wanda would hurry up.
It’s only as he walks down the corridor to Peter’s room, the last person he has to let know that dinner is going to be ready soon, that he realises the other thing that’s been nudging at his mind. During their whole conversation Tony hadn’t looked at him once. In fact, although they seem to talk as though everything is fine, Tony rarely looks at him when he’s talking to him. And that causes a painful twinge in his stomach.
