when you looked away for just a second. With you as a beacon we’ll never lose sight of him again.”
He deliberately took his time doing so and snorted when he made his way over to the pile of rumpled and flailing mess. Jarvis was completely gone now and Vision’s body shape couldn’t be distinguished anywhere under the cover.
“Great,” Rhodey said, “we’ve got allies.”
. Close enough to tease, but not close enough to sate him.
“Then we’ll both fall together.”
The times together were plenty that perhaps,
The alpha began pulling out but Tony quickly wrapped his legs around his hips to keep him still. “Sweetheart…” Steve appeared lost now.
friend. Lord help us, you and Steve really do deserve each other.”
There were no mirrors to help with his appearance so he went for the reliable alternative. “How’s my hair? My face?”
His alpha kneeled on the slippery, chiseled floor as he held Tony by his waist. His knot kept them locked together temporarily, and by the end of it one of them would give out from their awkward stance. Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder and shivered at the feeling of Steve’s fingers trailing up and down his lower back. His legs trembled at the unbalanced act they had made for themselves during their rush to touch, straddling Steve’s waist and legs dangling. He relied on his alpha’s strength to keep him still and in place.
Tony gasped at the feeling. The hand holding his length began moving now, lazily stroking from the base to the tip and back to the base again. He moaned as quietly as he could when the finger inside pressed in and rubbed slowly. Then moaned louder when both the stroking hand and rubbing finger were joined by a mouth kissing over his chest, a tongue tracing over his many scars. One particular scar directed down to his nipple and the tongue followed after it, leading the hot mouth over the nub and latching on to it to suck.
Tony wondered for a moment if Bruce had finally revealed his secret to Natasha. This had sounded far too close to the big guy’s circumstances for it to be pure coincidence. He did recall Bruce telling him he’d reveal it to her soon, he just didn’t think it had already happened. Both their demeanor hadn’t changed and Bruce never mentioned anything afterwards.
He was prepared for torture on himself. He was never prepared for torture on his omega. On his mate. On his home.
Tony swallowed, reached for the fork Jan offered him and sliced off a small portion. His hand shook slightly and he was thankful that the others were doing a darn good job pretending not to notice it, instead looking at their own plates or at something interesting at the distance. Tension melted off his shoulders the moment he took the first bite. His tastebuds were dancing, his eyes were in near tears from how delicious it was and his stomach growled in offense at still not receiving what he was getting emotional about.
“Are you excited for our run, Tony?” Jan said, eyes bright. “I hope you’re ready because you’re going to be my target after Hank.
Not fast enough. That gave Tony an idea.
The Avengers exchanged glances between each other, appearing surprised for a brief moment. A pause of silent communication and they were back to grinning again at Steve’s expense.
“Armor? When will I ever find a use for it?”
“Hydra aren’t very well organized, but what they lack in order they make up for in sheer numbers. They know how to surround you easy and take away your options. Depending on the area we’ll either have to hit them hard and quick before they can reinforce, or make them come to us one group at a time.”
A bit stiff from lying on the hard ground they walked back to the mansion with Tony wrapping Steve’s coat, that he decided to wear for their walk, tighter on his body and Steve with an arm around his shoulders, pulling him close. When the building came into view Tony spotted one of the windows of the tower attached at the back glowing a faint green. Curiosity and questions filled his head, but he had an idea of what the source of the lighting could’ve been. After all he had seen it earlier that day when Loki had casted a spell on the cart.
“You left us for a moment. Don’t know if you heard, but Bucky was just telling you something.”
“How do I look?” Tony asked for the ninth time in a row. His newly washed clothes he found time to do the day before now framing his figure.
“Why not? Saves water, and it's not like you haven't seen me naked already.”
you,” Steve said in a panicked manner upon seeing his reaction. “
“No,” Rhodey snapped. “I’m not going to let you get punished because you were helping me. Whatever your punishment is I’ll take it.”
Tony didn’t utter any of this. No, Stane or Hammer or their damn pack of selfish, senile jackasses that called themselves businessmen wouldn’t understand. Couldn’t even comprehend what Tony had gone through that led to him leaving in the first place. His suffering over the years had only been the foundation. Hammer and Stane selling his designs so shamelessly to any buyer, no matter their reasoning for weapons had been the unbalance. Using his gauntlets, the work he spent hours upon hours proudly on, to hurt the innocent had been the tipping point.
“Never said I was perfect.”
Steve grumbled. That’s not where he wanted them. He moved his head slightly to the right and leaned down to catch Tony’s lips again. This time they hit their mark. Yes, good, right where Steve wanted them.
Tony whined and looked away. Steve was giving him giant blue pleading eyes and how could he resist that? “It's about… about marking.”
Vision chose to do the same and went with Wanda and Pietro to meet their fathers. They were jerks, too, but not as big of jerks as Sam and Bucky. Those two were the biggest.
Steve frowned as well. “Do you think something’s wrong?”
Tony took a sharp intake of breath, pulled his fingers away and took a step back, ignoring Steve’s stricken expression. “Will you stop already,” his voice trembled. “Stop all of this. I’m sorry, alright? Is that what you want to hear? I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to run into you. I didn’t know you were walking down the road, I couldn’t see you. I wasn’t trying to hurt you or your pack. I ran the moment I could to get out of your way.”
“See that you are. Just for that, you’re getting extra hours on Vision-duty. I’m putting you in charge of Vision during my hunt and for the rest of the day.”
Seeing them all made his worries from before vanish, made it all seem silly that he made a huge deal about what they would think of him when they themselves were so laid back. They weren’t strict, they didn’t even seem to care. He felt so
“Gave them too much of a fighting chance if you ask me. Broke Steve’s shield clean in half,” Sam interjected, scrunching his face from the memory he had stated.
Too bad some of the Avengers refused to play along.
He felt more than heard Steve’s satisfying growl vibrating down his nerves. Another nip, another lick and a finger barely caressing the skin and he was sent over the edge. His body moved as if made of gelatin, the anvil holding him entirely, Steve continued his attentions, licking him clean. He knew he didn’t need to worry about the mess.
“I have a great idea. Let’s continue this conversation and nothing else. Let’s make the whole day nothing but this.”
“Aah, I'm real, I'm real, you made your point, let go,” Rhodey pawed him, exaggerating his pain. “You're going to yank my ear clean off.”
Tony’s heartbeat quickened. It wasn’t fair for him not to reveal the truth after everything that had occurred. Steve cared for his safety, that was obvious, He wouldn’t take advantage of Tony’s skills. He didn’t with the rest of their packmates and he wouldn’t with Tony. And even if he were to still try and keep it a secret it was evident it was going to be impossible with Steve and their packmates accompanying him to town.
“That’s not very reassuring,” Tony said with a bit of panic.
He entered the room in a rush to avoid curious eyes from strangers and felt safe for a total of four seconds before he noticed twelve set of eyes staring directly at him. His pack sat and stood on every available spot in the room, and even though he wore pants he could feel a breeze between his legs as if he had nothing on. The sight of seed leaking down his legs almost possible under their intense gazes.
“An angry cockatoo is someone you don't want to mess with,” Tony warned.
Fair enough, but still. One thing to have the mind fogged up from the heat and pleasure, another to be completely sober and focused and-
This chapter. Pooooooorn.
pause to briefly stare. Even if Hammer had been present. Tony would have remembered that. Remembered
Getting ready for the mission did only take him ten minutes and before long they were making their way down the halls towards the landing pads of the jets. Maria Hill was waiting for them just besides the jet already on and warming up.
Eventually, Hammer did loosen his grip. Not release him, but allowed Tony to take in much-needed air. A finger began moving forward and back on his neck. Searching. Feeling. Belatedly, Tony realized Hammer was tracing Steve’s bite mark. His stomach churned at the sensation. Not at all how Steve made him feel when he ran his fingers over the old wound with care and love.
Wanting to make a good impression he wore Jan’s gifted outfit for the journey, fixed as much as he could of his hair to be considered presentable, sneaked as quietly as his somewhat unbalanced body (Jarvis and Vision causing him to lean on one side from their added weight) would allow him, went through the front door and began a light jog the moment he was free. He was careful to smell and listen for any signs of danger. It might have been very early in the morning but that didn’t mean there wasn’t a single soul up and about, especially on the road. Early in the morning was usually the time traveling packs reached towns and Hattan was no different with visiting packs.
He could aid in battle. Help turn the tides. Make a
Both Tony and Steve whipped their heads to the door of the room so fast they heard their necks crack simultaneously. Clint stood just outside of it, appearing sweaty with his loose shirt and pants sticking to his body. His hands covering his nose and mouth and his eyes shut tight. “

engineer.”
No, no he couldn’t think that way. Sure, his packmates were open when it came to sex and they were quick to make a lewd joke here and there, but never had those moments taken a tone farther than a simple tease at someone’s expense. His pack caught him right after a bout of sex with Steve’s seed dripping between his legs the previous day and besides a sarcastic remark they hadn’t thought anything of it or eyed him as a slab of meat. Unlike Hammer’s pack.
“Just about done?” Tony repeated. His mind might be willing, wanting to hold Steve close again, but his body, while valiantly trying to make an effort, was not.
“Tony,” he offered in return and with a short nod Tony turned away and trotted down the path he was directed, wanting to hurry and avoid barely waking eyes. He scanned the surroundings, searching for his goal amongst the many undistinguished buildings around. Surely the blacksmith had set up a sign of sorts or added something unique to the outfit of his work space in order to tell bystanders that he was the town’s household items and weapons provider.
All as one they marched. Tony waved goodbye to Pepper and Happy the whole time they were within sight until the trees slowly obscured them. Even after he could no longer see them he couldn’t bring himself to look away from their direction until Rhodey came to his side and bumped his shoulder gently.
It’s inhumane.
“Me? N-no, no, I wasn’t including me,” Bruce stuttered.
He said it softly, mostly to himself, but some of his packmates had heard him and tore their gazes from the newcomer to him.
With a careful hand he closed the comic again and gingerly placed it inside its little plastic cover he had gotten for it to preserve. Mindful to keep an eye for any onlookers he quickly hid the comic back in its place amongst his other issues in a box he refused to reveal the location in his room. He trusted the agents of SHIELD to have his back but when it came to his comics that was a whole other story.
“Apology accepted, Doctor Banner. All I ask is that you refrain from making such comments in the future,” Jarvis whistled.
He blinked. Very confused now. “I - it’s not?”
In response, Bruce groaned and covered his eyes. “I am not having this conversation with you.”
“Why you -”
“How original,” Natasha and Bruce said dryly together. They both exchanged surprised looks.
Nothing.
It took an embarrassing couple of seconds for Tony to figure out Steve was asking if he wanted another round together, even when he had a willing body in his arms. It was a pleasant and unexpected reassurance, knowing that even after they coupled and he had, in a sense, given permission Steve wasn’t going to just take when he wanted. After experiencing multiple occasions where Steve managed to surprise him with his words and actions Tony couldn’t believe his alpha could
The face of the old blacksmith of the first town when he saw Steve, Rhodey, Natasha, Bucky, Thor and even Peggy standing behind Tony with their arms crossed was priceless. Tony hadn’t noticed his mate and packmates there at first. Not until the old blacksmith had suddenly started retracting his words and
Tony cracked one eye open to Jarvis standing inches away from his face and bobbing his head up and down. “Who?” he slurred.
Time passed and he had lost track of how long he stayed curled by the tree. With his heat burning in his body he had been surprised no traveling stranger or enemy sniffed their way to him out of curiosity for the horrid stench of a corpse plaguing the forest.
A war pack had no use for an omega with self-doubt. They required shifters with strength and quick thinking and confidence. They had no place for the weak. No place for an omega such as himself if he weren’t the mate of their pack alpha.
As they continued walking Tony got the impression that what Loki thought was a matter of minutes was the complete opposite of what he meant. They had to have walked for more than fifteen, possibly about half an hour, and even as the grassy terrain was switched to a gravelly road they didn’t look to be getting any closer to the pack appearing. He was about to ask how much longer and if they were almost there yet when, on the curve of the road that caused it to disappear behind trees, he heard faint voices.
“Having you.”
Tony had to hold back laughing so hard when Sam's and Clint’s extravagant attempts of the hour failed spectacularly when Rhodey completely missed the point.
“I must agree with Vision, Sir. I approve of Mister Rogers, but I ask that you both not share the same room for the night.” Tony could practically
in the mood.
Steve held him closer by using his snout to tighten the hug. “Oh, God, Tony what did they do?”
,’ he mouthed.
“Sir!”
Hank and Sam watched with amusement before going after the pair.
He and Bruce were awkwardly eating their rabbits, pulling on the meat and stuffing as much as they could without outright being rude. Since the Avengers had hunted down their deer at a later time they were still waiting for them to finish cooking. Tony and Bruce were hungry and their rabbits were still warm so manners or not they were going to eat, even if it was in a sedated state. They weren’t barbarians.
Tony wondered where exactly Thor was from for him to talk in such a manner. It certainly wasn’t from around the area. “No.”
We have a tie in last place between Clint/Loki and Thor/Loki.
While all the other kids wrote to Santa, Tony wrote to Odin and only Odin. He wrote it properly, signed his name, even stamped it and sent it off with Mister Jarvis. Where it would go, Tony didn’t know, but he trusted Odin would receive it.
“It has been a while since we last saw it.” Clint thought it over then looked to Tony and Bruce. “You’re going to love the place. It’s huge with enough room to fit in an entire family pack and even some horses and chickens and a moose!”
When all their bellies were full, Steve pulled him up, making sure to take all the weight off Tony as he guided him to the pond. His hands never wandered far away from Tony’s side or his hip. They had been the first to make their way over but were not the first to jump in. No, that honor was taken by Clint, who ran to the waters and shredded his armor haphazardly along the way until he stood with only his skivvies and barreled in. Tucking himself into a ball and jumping.
Tony kissed him again.
“Please listen and do everything I say,” Steve finally decided on, “and stay close.
While Tony believed it to be one reason at first, he knew it couldn’t be possible. For one, Bruce smelled nothing of a feline or any other species outside of canines. For another, the odds of finding a feline shifter living in shacks on this side of the world was near impossible. If anyone became pack-less while in somebody else’s land they would do the natural thing and travel back to their homeland to find another pack.
“Desire holds importance, as does his health. If Anthony had not wanted to, and his body had not been fit to carry, then he would not enter a cycle that would cause him harm. To carry young when he himself carried no proper health, he would have faced complications that would have resulted in issues in his young and scarring in his body.”
“Jarvis!” Tony screeched, sounding as every bit scandalized as he felt. The little bird he had raised since he was hatched didn’t just say that!
The only reason why Tony was given a chance to see Bruce’s shifted form was the sheer luck of being the targets to a late-night attack. For some reason or another, there were packs made for the sole reason of raiding travelers for their items, for their coin, to capture and sell as slaves or used as sex slaves, or to just attack and kill for the joy of seeing bloodshed. Tony, in all the years being in Hammer’s pack, had never been a victim of a raid. The pack carried weapons that would be a treasure trove for raiders but the pack also knew how to use the damn things. The items the raiders carried stood no chance against Tony’s pistols. On top of that, besides including pack-mates who had an eye for business, Hammer had gone and searched for the strongest betas around that favored their muscle over their head. Betas to keep the chain of command and prevent any mutiny against the alpha leader. Betas who preferred brawn over brain since Hammer didn’t need their input, just their skill in handling a weapon.
For a time they remained quiet. Rhodey had tucked his head over the back of Tony’s neck and kept still, choosing to wait until the time was right to speak. It reminded Tony of their younger years. After a particularly nasty alpha or beta or sometimes even an omega said cruel words that truly cut deep into his conscious and left him with emotional pain, Rhodey was always there in an instant. The alpha had been a constant and true support, curling up with him to lessen the hurt with soothing words.
The Howling Commandos joining in occasionally, and in turn, creating a scene, was also a big help. It spread the news across the land. Let the other blacksmiths know if ‘Iron Man’ requested use of their forge, they best allow the omega full use and not to mock him. Not that Tony took advantage of it. He always offered payment for use of their tools. Blacksmiths needed business, after all. He just wasn’t comfortable with anyone else handling his pack’s weapons and armor. He only trusted himself with their safety.
“I know for a
are you leader of this pack?”
Get ready!
“Witness me,
“Forgive me. I’ll try and remember that for future reference.”
Despite his initial fear, Tony had to wonder at why the alpha didn’t strike. They had been nose to nose, literally. Tony could still feel the little tingle on the tip of his nose from the contact with the alpha. He was a bite away from hurting him. Why didn’t the alpha attack? What kept him in place instead of jumping into action?
He cursed when he entered the communal kitchen and found Rogers leaning against the counter instead of Rhodey and his much-needed glass of water. He was about to turn and leave but Rogers spotted him before he could make his escape. A frown on his face and lips curving downwards. Tony was really
“But you loved those!”
So really, it was all Tony.
A flap of wings had all of them turning to the air. Jarvis was flying over them, squawking in concern and worry, fully aware of the situation Tony had gotten himself into. Tony took the opportunity and turned to run for his life. He tripped on his jump, didn't acknowledge the pain in his paw and kept going. He ran all the way back to where Vision stood guard of the rabbits and where Bruce was seated, watching over the little machine. If he could reach Bruce then he had a chance of surviving with the Hulk taking on the pack.
taken them in because of pity? What if -
you, Tony, and I know we’ve only known each other for a few days, but to me it feels longer.”
The jackal trotted forward and wagged his tail when he released the prey. “We come bearing gifts.” He made his way over to the coyote, getting greeted with a lick to his snout that he happily returned.
Tony made a squeaky noise before putting pressure, pressing himself against Steve. Without thinking, Steve wrapped his arms around the small genius and lifted him up. All without ever stopping the kiss.
“Whoa, calm down,” the alpha lifted his hands up. “I mean no harm, just curious. If your friend is a sensitive subject I’m not going to touch it. It’s just, if you did built him, that’s some mighty fine smithing skills you’ve got there. I get the feeling you’re capable of more than what I have to offer working. And I also get the feeling that you’re qualified as more than an assistant, am I right?”
“He couldn’t stand it,” Steve sounded fond now, “but he didn’t have a choice. Even when he told me to stop I wouldn’t listen. Still tells me to this day, but you can see what good that does. He couldn’t stop me so instead he helped me.”
Tony knew well their fallbacks. Often money was enough to settle any issues but sometimes brute force was required, and for those who had their time cut short Tony was only thankful it was quick. No torture or suffering. Hammer and Stane weren’t interested in that. They wanted sufficiency and the people they hired were skilled in that.
“Consider this payback for that time in your workshop.”
Jan shook her head. “Hank… it’s true we put our pack at risk, I will not lie. Our safety comes first, and we neglected that, but the way he reacted, the way he pushed… please don’t hold it against him. His mixtures are very important to him. He’s put years into perfecting them, so to hear his suppressants failed and a packmate entered a heat because of their failure? It’s… hard to accept. He’s -
Steve licked his snout. “Tony, everything that involves you is important to me. Tell me what's the matter, please.”
“Heat room. Right,” Steve said, seeming to get his mind together. “Over. Your heat is over?”
“Not nearly as close to what we’re estimating their numbers are,” Sam said. “We have to assume most of them are hiding inside their fort or further out into the forest and will come running the moment they hear a fight.”
Rhodey, in a childish endeavor, snorted and walked up to the wall. He pulled his arms back to stretched and huffed before placing both hands on the wall and pushed. Tony watched as the muscles on the tall man rippled under skin from the sheer force he was exhorting. His bat-like wings expanding and contracting unconsciously and his beaded tail swaying back and forth. Tony and Pepper stood clear of the tail, mindful not to get stung by the sting on the very top.
The beta must have noticed something on his face, for he lowered his snout and his ears. The guilt getting to him. “After you are cared for and in a better state of mind, I’d like to speak with you.”
Tony pulled back. Mind scrambling to connect the dots.
I hope I didn't make you wait too long. And thanks for being patient with me!
He pushed down his embarrassment and guilt. “Nowhere. I was just thinking.”
Somehow, even while in heat, Tony managed to feel embarrassed under Steve’s questioning prodding. “No?”
He… smelled pleasant?
The way his stomach rumbled loudly again suggested a simple snack was not going to be enough to sate his hunger, though.
Steve’s head. Tony didn’t even get a chance to comprehend what had just happened. One second he was sitting upright and the next, before he could blink, he was shoved down on his back with enough force to knock the wind out of him. He was being pushed down by a massive wolf who hovered protectively over him and growled. Steve was low enough that their stomachs were touching but still had enough room between him and the ground to have his legs wound up for him to strike at any dangers.
Tony closed his eyes.
“Are they going to catch anything anytime soon?” Tony casually said to the leader of the pack but when he turned he found Steve wasn’t even sitting next to him anymore. Instead, Steve was standing next to the nearest tree on their spot and was in the middle of removing the pieces of armor over his legs and groin area, leaving his shirt and pants as the only source of cover that left little to the imagination.
How had he fallen with child? The days in the carriage had given him plenty of time to think of possibilities but with no immediate answer. He didn’t think they’d be one. Had Hank's potion failed? Had he and Steve not waited long enough for it to take effect? Or had this occurred long before his heat had officially set in?
“They would never.”
Tony nodded and trotted off when he heard a “he-yaw!” from Peter. Paying close attention to the angles Peter moved his reigns, he was led back through the crowd and towards the area the finishing line for today’s race was located. He moved at a slow pace and was occasionally surprised when Peter pulled to slow him down further or even come to a complete stop when families, humans and centaurs, got in their way. A responsible racer in the making.
“Steve is not like that!” Tony growled. Hammer knew nothing of his mate.
That perked their ears up and caused the canines to wag their tails. When Tony turned to walk back to his spot they trotted after him, sniffing Vision and making sure he was injured free. The rest of the Avengers were quiet as they watched him walk back. All of them were shooting worried glances to Vision and him. The moment he sat down again Steve was on him with questions and checking him and Vision over.
Tony took care to wash his legs and spots where Steve couldn't reach. When they were deemed wet enough he leaned for the oils and lathered one of the rags with it, running it over his arms and shoulders, sides and over his belly. From behind he could feel his alpha doing the same.
“I object to that,” Clint gasped, outraged. “Sam is a very attractive man. I’ll admit, Tony is pretty good looking and I secretly envy Steve for it because wow, Tony, you aged well.”
Tony snorted. “Attacking me right at my age. You wound me, Jarvis. You have no love for the elderly.”
“That business pack meant
“Well, here goes nothing,” Tony said in an attempt to encourage himself.
He couldn’t.
“Can I just say,” Clint added, looking at Tony, “it’s about time. You can’t imagine how long we’ve had to put up with him.”
“Guests?” They turned on the curve and made themselves visible to the Avengers. Clint had his mouth open with a question on the tip of his tongue but he stopped when he noticed them. “Oh.”
“What if you were the one to do so, Jan?” Hank said with a scratch of his chin.
The image almost made him miss his old room in Hammer’s home. Anything was better than this pitiful sight.
The only Avengers that weren’t shifted and weren’t  jumping around in the water, Natasha, Bucky and Loki, exchanged glances with each other and Steve, doing more silent communication that Tony finally figured out was the prank they were planning. Obviously they hadn’t been counting on him figuring in it out and now had to adjust to make it work.
Steve leaned forward. “Here’s the plan.”
, Tony belatedly realize.
If Rhodey or Bruce had been unaware as well they didn’t comment on it. Instead, Rhodey was fast to act as the beta’s ears and rushed to hit Hydra goons with the back of his rifle before they readied their aim while Tony and Bruce struck at any who were unlucky enough to run right into them.
Relief was shown in Steve’s form. “That’s two I don’t have to worry about. I like you better already. Just remember what we said when you see a sign of an invasion. Lock the doors, hide, look for possible exits and make your move if absolutely necessary. Hank keeps explosives in the basement if you’re truly desperate. Mix anything that has a questionable color and it should work.”
“Maybe to just defend our territory?” Tony gestured around them. They had reached the same body of water Steve had shown him once. The sight was still as beautiful as ever. Green, clear and healthy. “Wouldn’t you fight for this until the end?”
Now that they had names to their faces it would be easier to communicate and at least now he knew the shifters who were helping their leader play a prank on him.
“I did chase after her because I needed to talk to her. It’s true we have a history,” Steve’s eyes lowered, careful of what he would say next. He moved his gaze to the doors, staring as if the person they were speaking about was standing there. Tony imagined it was out of respect. “Please, believe me. You’re the only one. What Sharon and I had? It ended on mutual ground. I love her -
“And here I was betting it was something blacksmith related, like
“Don’t listen to them.” Steve had appeared next to him, looking determined and scowling at every shifter standing by and chatting. “They don’t know the truth. They’re just making assumptions without all the information.”
It was Sam who figured it out first. “Our
. In his own words, “Hammer may think he’s the alpha, but Stane’s the one pulling the strings, Tony. It was
“Maybe.” Tony had his back to Bruce and so couldn’t see him, but from the sound of shuffling he figured the other omega had changed position. “But I’ll only need a few minutes, half an hour tops, to explain what a great omega you truly are and how blind you must be to not see it.”
The yearly racing event of the little old town Tony called home always got everyone ecstatic, including the town’s own centaur and even faun population that helped host a majority of all activities. Tony being included on that list. He had taken part in the Hunt Race, or really it was better known as the jumping race, on the first day of the festival. The ‘opening ceremony’ if one would. He won with little problem and kept his crown as champion for another year.
Steve’s gentle heartbeat, smell and his body's warmth soothed Tony down and lulled him to sleep.
did they -?”
The alpha smiled. “She’ll be fine, Omega. As long as you listen to me. No one will hurt a hair on her. Promise.”
“Good. The more help there is the better.”
“Hun, our pack will
“Considering you raised us both, I believe you are referring to yourself, Sir,” Jarvis whistled back.
The urge to run to his shop and start tinkering was a strong one, but he knew there was no time for it. The contract was a long journey, spanning days across southern land, he would need all the energy he could get to avoid being a burden to his pack. For now the gauntlets were perfect. Later he could make them even better.
“We’re fine,” she said, answering the question hovering over them. “It seems like one of those days.”
They were currently a little on the defenseless side. Both Tony and Bruce weren’t exactly known for their skills in hand-to-hand combat. Tony knew how to throw a mean punch, but against the firearms that Hydra packs carried? He wouldn’t make it out to the clearing without his gauntlets, let alone touch a hair on the enemy before they gun him down. They had to improvise with the small knives they carried.
That got Steve to stop for a second long enough for him to pull back and grasp Tony’s face in his hands and face each other. There were very evident tears in the alpha’s eyes, making them appear larger and causing the blue to glisten.
“Shit Steve, did you dump everything you had on him in one night? My nose is burning from over here,” Bucky said, waving his hand in front of his face as if trying to beckon whatever scent he smelled away.
From the platter, Steve grabbed a piece of dried meat and held it against his lips. Obediently he opened his mouth and took a bite. It wasn’t the tastiest he’d eaten, but it was calories and he needed that for the rest of the day. He finished it with another bite and did the same with a second and a third piece Steve held for him. His alpha then offered a broken chunk of the loaf of bread and a couple of berries to chew together. Another chunk of bread with some cheese over it was offered next and he ate away diligently and took sips of water when given.
“I’m not trying to take him, Steve. He’s all yours, calm down. Someone else has my interest, remember?” Bucky reasoned.
“Just casually commenting.”
He appeared as calm as he could, but on the inside panic had already set in. His chest constricted. Adrenaline pulsed through his veins.
Steve let out a little gasp. The look of discomfort from before long gone. “I think I know exactly what we’re going to do when I get you alone again. Do you want to hear about my fantasies?” The alpha’s eyes locked onto Tony, dilating with lust at whatever he was picturing in his head. “You on top of me. Straddling me. Bouncing with passion. Riding me until you can’t move. Using me until you’re satisfied.”
A chill ran down his spine, settling in his bones. “Are you going to tell them about - about -?”
Teeth grazing over the hardened nub, the hand pressing down on the base of his dick and one finger slowly making its way to tease the tip had Tony shaking in pleasure. He was close now. He could feel it building up and knew his body was eager to release it if he could just get that extra push. Then the mouth detached itself from his chest, the head it was connected to rose and Tony came face to face with Steve.
A lake. Of course they had a lake somewhere, but that wasn’t important enough to keep his attention because… Steve had said ours. Granted he could’ve meant himself and the Avengers, but… he had gestured his hand to Tony and then himself, including Tony on the list of ‘our.’
“Our whole pack is out there in the open and getting split apart. If this keeps up they’ll each be sitting ducks.”
“You can’t promise that,” Tony managed between hitched breaths.
“Actually, Tony, Steve didn’t ask me for permission either,” Bruce added, a smirk growing. “I don’t know how I feel about you both sharing a room together.”
“It wasn’t easy, let me tell you that, but I managed it after she literally stopped right in front of me while chasing Bucky. I couldn’t resist.”
“Tony,” Tony’s heart fluttered from the way the alpha had said his name, It sounded so gentle, so soft. It calmed him. “Stop me if this is too forward, but tomorrow the pack hadn’t planned for anything. It’s our rest day. Would you like to take a walk with me? I could show you around our territory. Take you to the lake.”
Tony could see her struggling to say what she meant by that. If he was understanding correctly, Hank reacted to his heat because of these negative memories he, and Jan, associated heats with. If Tony were to guess, he’d say the bad experiences came from a beta’s biological structure where, male or female, they both were capable of setting off a heat or a rut but only with the help of a partner or alchemy. With a partner, they’d have to work their way together for their bodies to adjust through pheromones and intimate touches until either a heat or rut broke, assigning their roles for either the bearer or sire. While with the help of alchemy, they’d have to drink the mixture that aided in bringing out their desired outcome. Both options took time, and never guaranteed success.
Tony’s heart slowed. His breath growing heavier with each intake as her words sank in.
Steve’s mouth moved away from his belly for a moment. Just enough for Tony to miss the lack of contact and whine in distress, only for a gasp to escape him again when he felt his alpha’s mouth return and swallow him whole. He bucked up in reflex. Steve was prepared and held his hips down, but it did nothing to stop him from trying to thrust deeper in the alpha’s warm and wet mouth.
“They’ll be fine.”
might not be fast enough, but someone standing behind them staring curiously out at the open field
“Thanks,” Steve said, just as dry as Clint had done.
Instead of replying Bruce merely pointed at Vision, who rolled back slightly and gave an undignified beep.
Turning his head he managed to make out the outline of Bruce’s figure behind him, resting back to back. A movement near his stomach signaled Vision’s presence and when he lifted Steve’s blue coat he was still wearing he spotted Jarvis curled up next to the little machine. Vision’s blue eyes lit up the inside of the coat and aimed at Tony. He gave a quiet questioning whistle.
For the first time in a month Tony woke up to his bones not protesting from having slept on a hard surface. In fact, his bones felt as if they were singing, well rested, and he didn't want to get up and risk bringing forth unknown or forgotten sores.
Groaning, Steve got up, watching as the blurry image of his friend from the sleepy haze sharpened enough to reveal him already in his Soldier uniform and was only a hop, skip and jump away from getting on the jet and taking off.
“Tony…”
Tony had no idea what she was referring to, but he wisely kept still inside, even if his instincts to go out were itching under his skin.
The problem lied with the people who spoke out
“We’ll find something, Tony. Don’t you worry.”
From the couples listed by me and suggested by you.
Stane slammed a fist against the wall of the carriage. “Hurry it up! Damn Avengers probably heard all of that. We need to leave
“Understood. I'll refrain from commenting on your youth, Sir.”
“Gentlemen so good of you to finally join us,” she said looking at a folder in her hand that, by some miracle, was not moving at all or being blown right out of her hands.
Vision went directly to where Clint and Sam had been standing a few seconds ago, but instead of the two betas standing on two legs, there was a freshly shifted jackal and coyote shaking their furs and licking each other's’ snouts. On the spot where Thor had been standing was a sight that took Tony’s breath away. There was a giant, golden lion with spots of dark on his mane. He was yawning and shaking his fur and the reason for Thor smelling odd suddenly clicked in Tony’s head. Thor was a Feline Shifter, or more specifically he was a
alpha - proud of him was a near instinct at the back of his mind. He felt so lively.
“I didn’t need much,” Steve admitted with a sheepish grin. “Taking you like that and tasting you… well.”
The odds were not in his favor, but he had to believe it wasn’t impossible.
Not exactly the truth but the angle Bruce was playing his explanation off on made Tony realize the discomfort he was showing wasn’t real at all. It was all an act. Bruce wouldn’t have been humiliated about the Hulk. If anything he’d be cautious and his body would be filled with tension. He was doing it on purpose, playing on the humiliation to make the Avengers focus on what he wanted them to believe instead of making them suspicious. And from the way all the Avengers seemed to wince in sympathy Tony knew his act was working.
Bruce snarled at him, but it didn't have the threatening vibe to it, more of a show of annoyance and bordering on affectionate.
Tony’s mind started running.
He swallowed and nodded, looking away and missing how Steve seemed to brighten up from his response. The Avengers, minus two, appeared relieved and some were seconds away from cheering at the development, especially the female beta sitting near the end, if her gripping the arm of the male beta sitting next to her and shaking it was anything to go by.
. They weren’t simply there for support. One omega walked with as much confidence as he could muster, but from the way he rubbed his hands together every now and then it was obvious he wasn’t comfortable. Yet the omega remained, faithfully following his pack, even to certain death.
“They’re not statues,” Fury explained, “and they’re not collectables either. If they were you’ll have to fight Barton and Wilson for them and about half of the agents in the helicarrier, and that’s not counting all of them.”
Tony nodded, happiness making itself known when his tail began wagging.
It made him miss his and Steve’s room terribly.
“Neither did Hank and I but we got the hang of fighting,” Jan offered. “You just have to find your style. We’ll help you.”
miss a chance to use it against him. In order to get him in line.
Time stopped moving for a moment. “I-it is? Even though I won’t make weapons?”
“Want anything particular to eat?” Steve eventually asked when he collected himself.
During these moments where affection and praise and love were the most wanted, Tony never received any of it in his many years as Hammer’s mate. Never received it from any mate since presenting as omega and having his first cycle. It had only ever been Hammer and for the longest time, he believed it would only ever
Clint spun in place as if to get every detail of the area in and abruptly stopped. “We’ve been found,” he managed to say just before, out from the brush, a large Hydra alpha appeared and in his arms he held a massive weapon. Far too large to hold as a gun but sharing similar features with multiple barrels all tied together in a circle and ammunition hanging on the side. The enemy alpha held it up by handles and was struggling with the sheer weight of it, but still managed to aim the barrels right at them. From behind the alpha came more Hydra shifters as back up.
“The only question you asked him! About where he was hiding all along. Would you ask her that same question?”
“But you taste so delicious. Just one little nibble.”
“Are you two going somewhere?” Prior said and began releasing a rumble from his chest. “You just got here.”
Above them all Jarvis was still in the air and he was squawking and screeching and crying, echoing his voice through the forest and asking for help. Vision was doing the same, growing louder and louder to the point of overpowering Jarvis and even hurting his attackers’ ears.
you? Putting your child at risk without a second thought and without even knowing of its existence. You’re unfit to be a parent. I should do the bastard a favor and get rid of it now.”
“We don’t want to scare him away.”
“I’ll always have love for you, but right now I feel betrayed.”
Well, anyway here it is! Have some pack teasing and Clint and Sam finally taking their first steps to getting their man Rhodey.
“You’re not winning this one, Peggy."
“I asked for leave time to visit my best friend and make sure he’s fine. That’s why I sent the letters, to tell you about it. When I learned what happened I started searching, hearing what I could, finding clues and even trying to think like you. I sent Pepper a letter hoping she could help keep an eye out. Raise the possibility of one of us spotting you. I didn’t actually expect them to leave their pack and find me to help in the search.”
“He really went and marked you every way he could,” Hammer said. His eyes locked in on the mark. “The great Captain. Accepting the seconds of another alpha. Why he would make such an effort for so little is beyond me. Perhaps you really did learn new tricks while you were away? I can’t wait to try them out.” Hammer then leaned in. Whispered to his ear. “My Omega. You will behave yourself. You will come back nice and quiet and respectful. Otherwise, Virginia will find herself with injuries because of you.
Hank barked out a laugh. “We really are. You’re right at home with us, Tony.”
Steve pulled back in laughter, even as Tony threw pillow after pillow at him. The laughter switched to the occasional chuckle when the projectiles eventually stopped. “Come on. Everyone’s getting ready and we need to fit you in your armor.”
Not with the Avengers. They had proven that by not only
Tony considered the words, engraved them in his mind and headed back to his room. Even though the entire interaction left him emotionally drained and even reopened a few of his old scars he found himself almost inspired, confident, and ready for something different. He had a small bounce to his steps as he reached his room.
Natasha pushed him hard enough to knock him to the pack mate on his other side. The pale, tall fellow that Tony had noticed from the start with long black hair and an annoyed scowl that appeared permanently stuck on his face. Clint put an arm over his eyes and swooned against the shifter, “My hero,” making him roll his eyes.
Vision cooed, accepting his apology, and turned to look at Steve and then Natasha and rolled slightly to get a look at the two shifters that followed down the table. The beta with the bow eyed the machine in amazement and pointed, “Is that, is that a
“Stop that,” Bruce said. “Whatever you're thinking stop that.”
The Captain ordered them to their positions. “Head out.”
“No, nothing.”
“Not a kid.”
Or was it more appropriate to say it had been Tony who ran into the Avengers?
Fixing up his bag, combing his hair and looking longingly and with concern at his decreasing tooth powder and half-full canteen he was ready to start the day and make the walk towards the Avengers, even with his back slightly straining and stomach rumbling for food.
his heats were… not pleasant. He recalled Hammer, and many members of his old business pack describe his heat scent as “a damn rotting
? He wasn’t ready nor prepared. He needed at least a week to think of how he could converse and how to least embarrass himself.
“You’re going to smith an armor similar to yours for me, right?” Rhodey examined the armor he had carried for Tony. “It’s a masterpiece, Tones.”
“Fine,” Bruce shrugged. He appeared to mean it. “I am, really. I might not be running, but I am scaring and that’s just as fun. In fact I managed to get Clint, Hank, Thor and even Natasha.”
That was a very appealing thought, if it held truth. He somewhat wished it true, but after watching Steve chase after the blonde shifter he wasn’t so sure. He hadn’t seen a visible bite mark, but the blonde shifter wore traveling gear that covered her neck for protection. For all he knew it could be hidden, and Tony had no right to that knowledge.
for him, and he had been withholding secrets from them the entire time.
Another attempt at the wrist had the arm abandoning his middle and going lower on his abdomen, making him squeak as it stopped inches away from touching his uninterested length. Then he felt movement behind him. Steve’s face burying even closer as his larger shoulders shook and Tony narrowed his eyes as the movement and the huffing noises the alpha created sounded a lot like laughter and someone doing their best, and failing, to hold it in.
His jaw slowly got closer to the floor the more the realization became clear. He was about to shout at the man, order him to let him go when he suddenly hit the ground painfully. The thunk echoed in the quiet room. He looked up in surprise, about to berate Rogers for dropping him so callously, but the words got stuck in his throat when Rogers walk out the door without looking back.
The alpha seemed unfazed by his small chat and continued smiling. “My name’s Steve Rogers.”
Can you believe?
Bucky nodded at her statement. “Come on, Stevie, you know I’d never do that to you. It’s just a bit of teasing. Don’t think any of us were prepared for how he looks in those pants.”
Clint turned to leave and there was a very notable stagger in his steps, but Tony didn’t pay much attention to it, not when his focus was running on whether Steve was mad at him or not.
He couldn’t even respond back. His tongue heavy in his mouth. He was welcomed to stay. They were allowing him to stay. What should he do? What should - he didn’t know what to do.
“I - I’m not… I’m not.” Tony managed. The fear had finally receded.
“What’s this?” Jan suddenly appeared next to them. “Love? Betrayal? Treason? Sorry, I couldn’t help but overhear. Who’s betraying who? Who has wounded the other? Who has a big secret they haven’t said?”
As he got comfortable Steve made his way to the door to close it shut (that he had forgotten he left open) before returning and getting rid of his shirt and pants in the process. Tony enjoyed the view immensely. The toned muscles, the pecs, and the incredible show of legs. It was a beautiful sight. The alpha then crawled on the bed and nudged Tony’s legs to spread them open. With his cheeks burning Tony did so, offering himself willingly. He watched as Steve got comfortable kneeling between his legs. He half expected Steve to continue where they left off and sink himself inside of Tony, taking Tony’s words of reassurance to heart. The other half of him was both curious and frightened at what the alpha had in mind in trying something different.
Jan came forward. “Don’t let him know we told you this, but Steve is actually very insecure when it comes to relationships, or specifically when it comes to you.”
“Well the only other thing to talk about is the pack contract. Which is work. I'd rather talk about this.” His damn second in command shrugged with that same lack of sympathy. Then his words finally caught up with Tony and he had to stop everything for a second as it sunk in.
“Says you.”
Not really understanding but not wanting to make the serpent angry Tony furiously wiped his eyes with the cloth. “I d-didn’t mean to -”
It was ridiculous. They were the Avengers after all. They had been doing this long before Tony even joined, but now that he had gotten to know them… he knew it only took an enemy with a lucky shot to take one of them out. He couldn’t stand the thought of staying behind and not being able to do anything about it.
Tony didn’t want to experience the cruelty that came if this whole ordeal was a lie, the emotional pain and exhaustion, but maybe, with Bruce by his side, it won’t be as bad. At least he won’t come out of this alone.
“What I’m getting at is, I lashed out at you, and at Jan. Not just because of the dangers that could’ve happened, but because of my own personal issues with heats and my loss.”
Unless… it had all been
Vision made a long sound as he rolled away from the splashing water’s reach and returned to Tony’s side to keep a safe distance from the river that was now inhabited by two canine shifters and a feline shifter that were doing a very poor job in catching any fish and doing fantastically in chasing them away.
Tony whipped around to face him. He glared back at the man. He wasn’t a child and he long outgrew his teens to be reprimanded like one. He was a
Steve’s eyes softened. “Never, not for this. Now if physical contact were to start happening I might have a few choice words to say. I can’t stop them from appreciating, but they know better than to touch the art.”
, she’s not a threat and she’s not posing as one by talking to me. I understand doing it with Rhodey, I do, but she’s a
“Everything all of you have done for me, to help Steve -”
“I didn’t know the Avengers were recruiting. Why didn’t they say?”
He did and the first thing he noticed was Steve standing by the side with a grin. Once his mind registered that  yes that was, in fact, Steve, he noticed what was
To have it so easily ruined by Tony. Just like that. Their peace of mind stolen and all it took were two ruthless businessmen, their pack of mindless minions and an omega who couldn’t do a damn thing to stop them.
Realization dawned on Bucky’s face, “Holy shit, you’re assigning us as their babysitters.”
“Search around. There has to be something here,” Tony said. “This is our last known connection. If we don’t find anything we’re back to square one.”
“Why would the Avengers want us?” Tony couldn’t help but say. “They’re just playing around. We’re nothing but amusement to them. A big joke.”
“Oh, I’m sure you will,” Natasha responded dryly while pointedly staring at Steve, who had not stopped his attention. “Steve will take good care of you.”
He never revealed his last name, never revealed his past. Stark wasn’t just a throw away name. It was once a famous brand, and now his pack was going to realize exactly what golden goose they had in their hands. It didn’t matter if he swore to never make weapons again. If his pack wanted it they could easily force Tony to do so.
Hulk took two massive steps forward. Under direct sunlight, it was easy to note the dark fur he carried and, curiously enough, the almost greenish tint to it. Standing before them Hulk easily towered over the two, forcing them to crane their neck in order to see eye-to-eye.
“Why hasn’t he told us now?” Steve asked.
He only hoped Steve was forgiving for a lie of this extent.
Tony did so. Lying down and watching Steve curiously as he straightened himself out and poured a generous amount of oil on his hand. Some of the oil failed to remain on his palm and trickled down to splatter on Tony’s belly. His fingers glistened under the light and Tony watched a little fascinated when Steve rubbed his coated fingers together before he reached behind himself and leaned forward a little for better leverage.
Had he experienced a faux heat? The outcome of his body adjusting to the healthy environment he now lived in until it was strong enough for a true heat? That seemed explanatory, but he was no expert. He needed a knowledgeable opinion, otherwise, he was grasping at straws.
Steve didn’t exactly look happy at the suggestion but he didn’t voice it. In fact, what came out of his mouth was the exact opposite. “Any friends of Tony’s are welcomed to stay with us. We’ve got plenty of room to host you.”
His body had been craving that intimacy in the middle of his work, but the heat from the fire and his soreness prevented him from noticing. It wasn’t until the smell of his alpha hit him through the ash and the feel of a hand over his belly that he realized he was aroused. That hand went further south while the other one was placed on his chest and he moaned when it expertly rubbed both places.
“You could contribute a lot,” the alpha countered. “Jan and Hank didn’t know anything about fighting when they joined. In fact, Hank doesn’t care about fighting at all. He likes observing and studying instead, but he helps us a great deal. And Clint isn’t the greatest fighter. He prefers shooting from a distance but can throw a punch or two if he needs to. You don’t have to know how to fight to join,” Steve rambled. “It’s just, we’d really like to get to know you, Tony.”
All of you are angels.
“You’ve known from the beginning. You must have. Why would you go through all that effort for me?”
“I can safely say which one I’d rather be taken out with.”
Tony quickly turned the side of his body carrying Vision away. “No, no repairs needed. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come in here.”
“Rhodey -”
“That eager to leave me already?” he tried joking.
Tony smiled at the sight. Both happy for Steve and very much sad. Steve had grown to be just as important to Tony as Tony had grown to be for Steve. Unlike Steve, though, Tony was and had always meant to be temporary. He was, after all, only a gift from some mystical being of the north.
“You really think the other guy looks like a family omega?” Bruce snorted.
“Although,” Steve gave his nose a lick, “I’m saying this now because I know our pack. They’ll demand answers as to where you went as soon as we get back.”
“You’re safe, you’re safe, Tony, I swear. You’re safe,” Steve repeated over and over and over again.
“Smelting?”
“You bit your mate’s best friend for the sake of saving
Didn't mean he couldn't enjoy the glow after a wonderful bout of mating, or sate the exhaustion his body seemed prone on feeling after each session. Of course he had also been looking forward to getting clean, and…
Tony managed to softly chuckle at that, but it barely lasted. The reason for his worsened injury coming back and the fact he face planted the ground mocked him. “Saw the Avengers.”
“I can as well,” Pepper included.
It had been Bucky that kept Steve restrained as the sedative strong enough to knock Thor out and tire the Hulk ran through Steve, eventually putting him to sleep.
“Tony -”
Tony eyed him warily.
Finally, Steve spoke. Albeit a very short and very audible “Guh.”
Tony hiccuped. “Steve -”
Tony found, during the days together with Bruce and building up an unspoken temporary pack bond, Bruce was the best omega friend he never knew he wanted. Bruce was a partner in science crime and a fellow omega who understood the situation they were currently in and the factors that weighed heavily against them. Tony was in his forties and Bruce was one year away from reaching them. They had salt in their hair, lines on their faces, the occasional bad back from sleeping on a hard surface, a past they were desperately trying to avoid (because Bruce was definitely trying to avoid ever bringing up his old pack) and they had a silent agreement they were not meant for the grounded family pack. They were not meant to have a mate to support them and their five pups and have grandparents to look out for and pack-mates to be the doting aunts and uncles and godparents.
Tony curled in on himself, trying to create a shield. For what little it did. He wrapped his arms around his stomach. He was limited now. He had to be careful. His only hope was either his pack finding him, or sacrificing what he had just learned of to live.
The feathery white umbrella cockatoo that was currently resting on his back squawked, ruffled his feathers and nodded before taking off. He flew towards the direction of the shack. In his wolf form, it was easy for Tony to chase after the bird and keep up. He spotted the cockatoo resting on the roof of a brown and worn out shack, bouncing his head up and down and flapping his wings.
Tony would have said more but something in the tone of Steve’s voice stopped him, made his words have more meaning and made his own heart flutter.
Tony shrugged, attempting to brush aside the pain as if nothing. “What can I say? My old pack didn’t -” he rubbed the side of his face harshly, fighting the urge to just spill everything on Steve’s lap. “They weren’t the best.”
Not the most pleasant control, but he survived and that was all that mattered.
That didn’t help at all. “Maybe another time on the lazing in,” he offered. “I’ll be more than happy to join you in doing nothing.”
Red-faced, Tony glared at the cockatoo. “You would approve when my sanity is at stake.”
During the month of staying in the shacks, there were a total of four packs that had traveled through. Each time Tony and Bruce had barely caught a glimpse of the members, let alone even managed to even see the hair on the leader alpha. The other shifters were always blocking the view. It didn't help that neither Tony nor Bruce even tried to get close to the packs. They preferred to just remain at their table they had marked as their own and make small talk, asking about the weather and such. Casual conversation. Perhaps a brief mention of the pack here and there with a sarcastic remark from Jarvis, but then they’d go right back to talking about something mundane. Such as Vision’s questionable stain on his metallic body that requires Tony to bathe him later on in the day.
a family.
When Tony gave the kid a good look he realized, for someone who couldn’t be older than nine, he was really scrawny, and very much an alpha. He was the smallest nine-year-old alpha Tony had ever seen, but that didn’t stop him from going up against three shifters so Tony had to admit this little alpha had spirit.
He smiled against the fabric of his blanket, hiding it from view. He was so giddy from just the thought.
Steve was going to chuck him to the side and never hold him the same way again. He was sure of it. Maybe with luck he’d remain with the pack but it’d never be the same between them. He wouldn’t be able to bare living so close to Steve and have him so far away. To not be near the way he wanted them to be. He gave his all to the alpha. Maybe he should’ve kept something for himself. Now he could be left with nothing, should Steve decide to order him away.
He was on the verge of tears. He could make a break for it. Shift and run as fast as he could and reach the trees. Use them as cover and slow the shifters down.
the alpha. His eyes slowly widened and his mouth parted open. He took two shaky steps forward, his gaze tracing the the surface of stone and steel and iron. The anvil resting beautifully on a block of stone. The forge pressed on the ground near the wall of the mansion with stone creating a layer to separate wood from steel and rock. A rack holding different number of tongs and hammers and a gorgeous grinder placed near it.
What did you
Steve sounded curious. Not a sign of ill-intent in his voice. “It is. I loved creating. You could say I grew up with a hammer and a pair of tongs in my hand.”
Hello everyone! I hope you're having a nice day. I bring more angst and self-worth issues and fluff.
They walked out his little work station and made their way around the mansion where a large open field, dubbed as the Avenger’s training field, was present. A safe distance away from Natasha’s - and now Bruce’s - garden and their den. In the center of the space he spotted Rhodey, Pepper and Happy kneeling and sitting on the ground, sweaty and panting. The rest of their pack were sprawled around the area. Some standing near them while others were leaning back against trees and enjoying the show. Loki, Hank, Bruce and Sam were among the latter. The four enjoying the show immensely and sending appreciative glances at them all.
, having a night’s rest without the fear of danger looming over him.
The guilt returned. “I don’t think I’ll be joining them.”
changed Tony’s life. As he stared at everyone around him, the Commandos, his pack the Avengers, he couldn’t help but think how lucky he was. He didn’t know where he’d be if he had never left Hammer that fateful night or had met Bruce or had run into the Avengers. It was more than what Tony could have asked for. He was healthier than ever before. He had experienced a
He took one glorious stretch once he was outside. His bones snapped in a refreshing manner. Being cooped up for such a long time did a number on him. No longer in his prime, his bones were quick to stiffen. A walk around their territory would do him good before bathing. It’d been a while since he was able to enjoy the sun as a friend instead of an inconvenience while on the road. Plus, their territory was beautiful. A call to walk was hard to resist.
Tony felt the tension release from his body. These were good reactions. None of his packmates were moving to attack the Hulk and many already appeared accepting. Thor helping along in his own way and Natasha preventing any thoughts of acts against the giant from forming increased the chances further. So far Steve himself hadn’t reacted negatively and with luck, he wouldn’t. They would come to bond with Hulk and have nothing to fear.
Tony sighed and looked down. The alpha was persistent and Tony was alone. If he frustrated him to the point of angering there would be a huge possibility the alpha would lash out. He couldn’t risk it, not when he had Jarvis and Vision. “I came in here to ask if you required an - an assistant, or some help…”
Natasha nodded, indifference expressed but the slight crease on her brows told another story. Before anything she turned to their leader, showing respect. “Do you permit it?”
His mate did not disappoint.
“Better yet,” the blond continued as the tip of Tony’s erection touched skin, “instead of sitting on my shield. How about sitting on my face?” Tony gasped and grabbed at the blankets around him blindly as a warm and tight heat slowly engulfed his dick. “Your slick smeared all over my face. Let it drip down my neck as I lick you up clean. Would you ride my face the same way you’d ride my dick?”
To prove his point the group of betas and omegas surrounding them were getting brave and crept closer and closer, wanting to converse with one of the Avengers. There wasn’t a spot around their table that was free of a shifter and Tony knew that Bruce must have been uncomfortable. With tense shoulders Bruce straightened up, understanding that he wasn’t going to get away with not communicating, and gave the Avengers a timid wave. “Bruce Banner.”
“Those attacks might have been a distraction, but they were still a very real threat. Stane and Hammer would have willingly burned down buildings if it meant getting what they wanted. They always get what they want.” A very real fact that Tony learned long ago.
Tony groaned and rubbed his face with the sleeve of the coat he was wearing. When his nose was assaulted by a strong scent of alpha his brain decided to start properly working and the scent changed from random alpha to Steve Rogers and the words both Bruce and Jarvis had said finally sank in.
“Guess we’re becoming Avengers.”
He made a noise. He knew he did, but he paid no attention to it because he felt so
. He couldn’t make a sound for days after it happened.
“You really think, if given the choice, everyone is going to pick sleeping on the ground instead of sleeping on a bed? Would you?” Denial was on the tip of his tongue, but Rhodey would have none of it. “Don’t even pretend you’d pick sleeping on the ground. I remember how much you whined about the dirt getting on your fur.”
The face Steve had wasn’t exactly encouraging. Sadness was the last thing anyone wanted when mating was to occur. Tony deflated, pulling his hand away and ready to walk the walk of shame out of the room. He had ruined something so simple, something he had done for years. Only Tony Stark would be capable of ruining sex.
