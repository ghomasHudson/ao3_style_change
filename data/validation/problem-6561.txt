Steve laughed, a genuine laugh that broke the tension and the seriousness of their conversations. Tony joined him in the laugh and it was like this tangible cloud that had been smothering them and pressing down on them was lifted with that laugh. They were back to sniping each other and teasing him about his looks and it just felt better. It wasn’t completely back to normal, but for the first time Steve had a feeling it would be okay. It was going to take some more work, but it was going to be okay.
“Steve, this really isn’t—“ Tony started to protest, but Steve interrupted him by pulling him into a close hug. One hand rested on his back and the other cradled the back of his head.
“Don’t worry Tony, we’ve barely scratched the surface. I haven’t even asked him about baseball yet,” Steve grinned.
Tony leaned forward on the counter with a grin. “I mean, I guess I could check with the manager. I’ve heard he’s really reasonable and very good-looking. Hold on.” He placed a hand to his chin as he looked up to the ceiling for a few seconds before he met Steve’s gaze again. “He says my boyfriend is always allowed to visit me at work.” And to emphasize his point, he caught Steve’s lips in a warm and inviting kiss.
any of them. “…I don’t think I said anything,” he replied. It wasn’t like he was trying to deny anything, he just honestly couldn’t remember talking.
“See, already better,” Tony grinned as he reached across the counter and grabbed one of Steve’s hands. Steve took it happily. Now that they were officially going on a date, their flirts had become much more obvious, and he was kicking himself for not doing this sooner. It’s like they could flirt at a whole other level now, and he loved it.
“After the kind of date we had yesterday? You get access to as many kisses as you want,” he promised huskily.
“More like someone,” he grinned, happy to play along. “Some incredibly attractive man stole my shirt. You wouldn’t believe the things I had to do to get it back. It took a lot of effort.”
He also learned that Tony didn’t really interact with any of the other patrons the same way he’d interact with him. There was a banter and a swagger that he had with Steve that he never showed with any of his other customers, even other repeat customers. He was clearly familiar with them, and he seemed really familiar with a kid in the shop who he knew he’d seen there before, but it didn’t sound the same as when he talked with him. That had to be a good sign…right?
“Well yeah,” he said, like it was obvious. “He’s a big part of your life, and if we officially become boyfriends, I’d be a big part of his life just like he’d be a big part of mine. Of course I wanted his say on if I could come into that life or not.”
Tony,” he gasped, and as he pressed his lips back onto Tony’s for another crushing kiss, he could feel Tony smirk against that kiss.
trouble with that.” He walked back over to the register to take the next order and Steve absolutely watched his hips sway.
hold it in his hands. And even through Tony’s jeans, he wasn’t disappointed. It was firm and luscious and fit perfectly in his hand, and he groaned and twitched against him. He slid his other hand down and clenched onto the other cheek. “Oh
He felt Tony shift against him. His hands were no longer fisted in his shirt, but wrapped around him in a tight hole. “I only buried my face in your chest because you smell so good,” Tony finally said. “I couldn’t fight it anymore.”
“It fits perfectly,” he assured him. “I could spend forever staring at you in those clothes, but I have a very special date planned and I really want to get you there to see how impressed you are with me.”
He arrived late to the coffee shop, which just felt weird and wrong. The sun was higher in the sky, the street was lighter, and after having such a habit ingrained into him after eleven days, it just felt wrong to get coffee so much later in the morning. It also felt weird because he wasn’t coming in fresh and sweaty from a run. He was dressed in his formal army greens with his hat tucked under one arm. He pushed his way into the coffee shop, and it clearly took awhile for Tony to recognize him because he almost made it to the counter before Tony said anything.
“Yes! That sounds great! But…can we do Monday?” he asked as he bit his lip nervously. “We’re actually doing a field trip to DC this weekend – I leave tomorrow morning – but I get back Sunday and I shouldn’t have a lot of homework so I could totally do Monday!”
The potential that he had read him wrong shook him to his very core. He always did have the worst gaydar – Bucky would make fun of him constantly for how wrong he could be and that he had a better eye for gay men than the gay man, so it wasn’t out-of-the-ordinary for him to guess wrong. He had just felt so sure with all the flirting, but maybe he had been wrong? He actually had never entertained that thought. The entire time he spent coming to this café to speak with Tony…he just assumed Tony was into him, but if he was wrong about that…then everything he’d been trying to do was for nothing, and he really couldn’t handle that crushing disappointment.
Tony just chuckled. “You too Steve. You know, three days in a row you’ve come in here at 6:55 on the dot. You’re like clockwork. You got your run timed out that well?” he asked over the sounds of the espresso machine.
Steve chuckled because he had been thinking about that this morning on his run too. “Honestly? Sheer dumb luck. I’m not usually a ritual coffee drinker, but I was really hungry and this was the first place that sounded just right. How about that huh?” Really the amount of things that had to happen to get him to end up at Jumpstart were astronomical, and if one of those things changed, he would never even know this place existed. He had to stop at just the right spot and be just in the right mood for a muffin, and head in just the right direction from Central Park. If Tony had been one block over or one block further down, he would have missed him and probably never found him. It was truly incredible to think about.
When they finally stopped the kiss, Tony gave his happy little sigh that set Steve’s heart fluttering and he had this dopey grin on his face. “I take it you missed me?”
Tony slid behind the counter and Steve quickly paid for his coffee so he didn’t hold anyone else up more than they already had, though it really could have only been a minute or two. As he sat watching Tony make his coffee (actually it was more like he watched Tony’s butt make coffee) he thought of their date again than night with great excitement. “So do I get any hints about our date tonight?” Steve asked.
Steve sighed. “I’m glad you’re enthusiastic, but this is kinda important for me. Can I finish the question?” he asked softly.
He ran right up to the café, slightly out of breath and sweaty. The pain had been helpful, but as the pain from his run subsided, he was still left with the twisting stomach. He needed a confidence boost, and he had just the one. He’d been saving it for when he needed it, and this sure seemed like the time. As he walked up to the counter, he grabbed the hem of his shirt and lifted it up to wipe off his sweaty face, which gave a clear view of his chiseled abs. He worked hard for those and he was proud of them and he had no problems showing them off if it made everything easier today.
He didn’t need to be told what prize Tony was referring to, and he wasted no time in sliding a hand down his back to clasp at his butt. After staring at it for eighteen days, after imagining what it would feel like when he finally got to hold it and using that as fuel for the fire when he was alone at night, it felt incredible to
“You seem to be doing okay right now though,” Steve pointed out with a grin. He absolutely loved how much his body and now his musk was a turn-on for Tony, and he was happy to put that to use whenever he could.
Steve also never showed up, but Happy didn’t seem to mind or even notice. It was almost like he knew that Steve wouldn’t be showing up. It was almost like he knew that Steve was preoccupied with something else, something more important, and he knew not to expect to see him.
The coffee bar itself sat at the front of the room near the door, which was smart for patrons hoping to get their coffee to go. The bar had the same clean look, with a lot of glass and metal and the same white countertops. A glass case showcased baked goods that called his name after such an intense run, and long glass windows separated the patrons from the coffee machines, which were surprisingly not hidden like they were at so many Starbucks. Elaborate espresso machines sat behind the counter so everyone could see the fine metalwork that went into their design. Behind the bar was a large piece of glass that had all the options typed out on it in very clean and clear font. On the other end of the bar was a place to pick up drinks, which extended into an even longer countertop with barstools covered in a soft, grey fabric. It actually reminded him more of a bar, where a patron could sit and sip their coffee while talking to the barista behind the counter. It was clever. It was clean and open. It was unique, and he was drawn to it in a way he couldn’t explain.
After that experience, Steve knew he could fully trust Bucky with everything in his life, and he especially trusted his advice. Bucky had a gift for reading people and had the best gaydar he had ever seen. Bucky was so convinced of his gaydar that if someone told him he wasn’t gay, Bucky firmly believed he just hadn’t come out of the closet yet. But Steve had used Bucky’s talents to pick up guys for years, and he needed those skills now. Not necessarily to pick up Tony – he was pretty sure he could manage that on his own – but to just make sure he actually was interested in men.
It seemed like Tony felt the same giddiness as he rested his head on his shoulders and closed his eyes, a content smile sitting on his beautiful lips. “…I think I’m okay,” he finally said, and his voice seemed like he was in a haze.
Steve shivered because there was something incredibly sexy about Tony whispering in his ear, and he too agreed it had been too long since they were able to be intimate. “Tonight?” he suggested as he grabbed Tony’s hand and interlaced his fingers between Tony’s. “We can celebrate that this is my thirtieth day in the café.”
“No you…you’re fine. I can’t—you’re fine,” he stammered as he swallowed noticeably. “So uh, looks like you can get away with a cinnamon roll today,” he said with a forced chuckle as he turned his attention to the pastries.
“Well, that’s what I’m here for, a perfect cup of coffee,” he smiled back, but again that smile felt hollow, as did that boast.
Pete immediately looked apologetic and put his hands over his mouth. “Right! Right! Sorry! I’ll be—I’ll be quiet. Just…ask your question. I’m sorry!”
Because he finally had to admit it…he was smitten. He remembered every little thing that Tony did. Every smile, every crinkle or sparkle of his eyes, the way he moved making coffee, the way his jeans hugged his butt - he remembered it all. He was infatuated. He couldn’t get him out of his head. He was falling for him, and falling for him hard. If he had any hope of winning him over or dating him or letting this go anywhere, he needed to see if he could even get along with him. He had a pretty good feeling, but he wanted to make sure this attraction wasn’t completely physical, and getting to know the man was a way to test that out.
He entered the coffee shop with a smile on his face, committed to making Tony laugh, but what he saw when he entered made him stop short. Instead of his beautiful barista behind the counter, he saw a large middle-aged man with a graying goatee behind the counter. That…definitely wasn’t Tony. Not even close. And yet this strange man didn’t seem frazzled being behind the counter, almost like it was a normal thing.
“Wait Tony, can’t you work your magic?” Steve interrupted. Something was going on, but giving Tony a chance to flaunt his skills would surely make things better...right?
He somehow caught Tony’s eyes shifting towards him and he wrenched his gaze away from Tony’s butt and back up at his face. He couldn’t quite tell from his smirk if he knew he was checking him out or not, but he was going to pretend that he didn’t. “Nope, that is
with him. He’d never had that with another person before, not even Bucky, and it was probably because he loved Tony.
For anyone who wanted to skip to the end, after their first kiss, Steve and Tony did some intense making out. After learning about Tony's history as Tony Stark and his reputation, Steve thought about whether he wanted to be another first date that ended in the bedroom, but decided that he didn't care. Tony offered his empty apartment above the coffee shop, and they left to spend the night together.
Bucky had been his best friend since they were young together. He would help protect him from bullies in high school, before Steve bulked up, and he was always supportive and there for him. When his mom died when he was sixteen, Bucky’s family took him in, and he still felt like he could never repay them for that favor. He joined the military as soon as he could to get out of their hair (and because he’d always wanted to serve like his dad) but he always remembered their kindness. That experience created a special bond with his best friend. They grew up together, they served together, and unfortunately they got blown up together. Steve managed to make it out with a few scars from shrapnel thanks to Bucky’s quick thinking, but Bucky lost an arm and was still struggling to adjust.
Happy stayed silent the rest of the time, letting Steve focus on his thoughts. He grabbed his coffee in a to-go cup, left with a lot to think about, and a lot of planning to do if he was going to finally make plans to ask Tony out.
Tony shifted nervously and looked at the register to input Steve’s order, looking like he needed to be busy, but Steve caught a brief flicker of something positive (he wouldn’t go as far as to say happy, but definitely a positive emotion) in his eyes. Steve let him have his moment and his distraction, letting him ring him up as he dropped a cinnamon roll onto the counter. But as he handed him back his card, he met Steve’s eyes and simply said “Well now I know.”
Steve did as he was told, taking a bite of the still-warm cinnamon bun and then chasing it down with a sip of that perfect coffee, and he was right, it was perfect. “Right again.”
He got up to the counter and saw Tony stifle a yawn, which made him smile. “Looks like you didn’t get enough sleep last night,” he pointed out before kissing him hello.
When the coffee arrived, it was in to go cups, and Steve realized Tony never asked if he was going to stick around. He’d asked for the past couple of days, and that request usually came with some kind of comment about how happy he was that Steve stuck around. Was this a subtle sign he wanted him to leave? It all left him feeling a little queasy, and he took a sip of his coffee to help calm his stomach. “Perfect, like usual Tony,” he smiled.
A bright smile spread across Tony’s face at the compliment, and Steve realized that he had actually been waiting more for that smile than the coffee. He said a meek goodbye, too enamored to have more coherent thought, and left the café while Tony tended to another patron. But Steve still stole another look at him on his way out the door.
Steve leaned in with a smirk. “Nope. I’m a military-grade lockbox; you’re not getting a thing out of me.”
Steve raised both of his eyebrows as he looked in earnest at Tony. “Oh? And why do we need some privacy?”
Hadn’t he made that abundantly clear? But just to make sure he got the point across, he made a disgusted face. “Definitely not. For one it would be like dating my brother, and two he’s not at all my type.”
“Then you’ll just need to learn to work through it,” Steve grinned with another kiss. One hand slid under Tony’s shirt to softly run his hands along his side. This wasn’t about trying to be sexual – they were both spent from the shower this morning – but about being intimate and emotionally close, and there was something special that happened when he touched Tony’s skin that the clothes muted. “You might need to get used to it.”
Bucky agreed to meet him outside the café after his run, but of course he was late, which left Steve fretting outside. He could tell that Tony had seen him and he kept giving him curious glances through the window, probably wondering why he wasn’t coming inside. Finally Bucky arrived, looking nice as ever in a button-up shirt and tie. It was always their joke that he was the gay one, but Bucky had much better fashion sense. “I said 6:55,” Steve admonished as soon as he saw him.
This time Steve knew better to take a sip before leaving the café. Again Tony heated the coffee to the perfect temperature and it had so much flavor it was an experience drinking it. He nodded his thanks and raised his coffee in a toast towards Tony for the exquisite work. “Better than yesterday,” he complimented. And it was true, because this time he had been waiting for this coffee.
“Well happy Monday Steve,” Tony greeted as Steve walked into the coffee shop. “You know, Happy and I were talking last night, and he thinks those shirts you wear might almost be indecent.”
“I’ll text you right now,” Steve promised as he retreated to his usual spot, his phone already out to save Tony’s number. If something happened to that business card before he was able to program that number in, he would never forgive himself, so he wasn’t wasting any time. He saved the contact and sent him a quick text that just said “Steve” so he knew it was from him before he put his phone away. Maybe someone more clever than him would have attached an emoji to that text, but he wasn’t really an emoji kind of guy; call it old fashioned but he preferred words over pictures. Besides, he had better things to focus on right now, like the joyous sway of Tony’s hips. He was clearly in a good mood, and Steve was overjoyed that he was able to bring that out in him.
Happy chuckled under his breath as he shook his head. “Yeah, sure. The coffee that I know I can’t make the same because Tony keeps your special blend under lock-and-key. That coffee?”
“Actually, I thought we decided last night that it was Captain?” Steve pointed out with a sly smirk and a lift of an eyebrow.
Tony gave him a little smile – was it a pity smile? A sympathetic smile? He couldn’t tell, but he knew that he blew it. “Well since we’re being curious, do you have any plans on Saturday?”
Tony grinned as he swiped his card and returned it to him with a kiss. Steve gave him a wink before he sat down at his usual spot. He turned to Pete, taking the time to chat with him. Now that they were officially dating, his next step was to get to know Pete more. He remembered how touched Tony was that he included Pete yesterday, so he intended to involve him even more going forward.
“How’s everything?” he asked him as he sat in his usual chair. Maybe there was something going on in their personal lives that was the cause of all this stiffness between them?
“So what is your type?” he asked, and boy if that wasn’t a loaded question. He actually saw Tony’s posture change as he made the coffee, like he was actively listening. He had this brief thought that Pete was asking all the questions that Tony wouldn’t, so he allowed the deeply personal questions and chose his answers very carefully.
Now they were getting somewhere. He grabbed Tony’s other hand and rubbed his thumb into it. “Anniversary of what?” he asked softly.
Steve arrived much later than usual to the café, well after nine in the morning, but he didn’t seem at all concerned. He had a phenomenal night and woke up to an even better morning, and he had the owner of this coffee shop to thank for it. He waltzed into the shop, positively glowing like the sun. He caught Tony’s eye, which brought a warm and happy glow to his face. He knew it had only been about an hour and a half since he saw him, but he already missed him. He waited his turn, though not patiently, before he walked up to the counter and favored Tony with a smile that set his eyes twinkling.
He notices Tony’s Adam’s apple when he swallows. “There are many thoughts in my mind right now, and I promise I cannot tell them while two minors are less then a metre around.”
He has found out about Tony that morning, reading the newspaper over breakfast. There was an article about the biggest companies of the moment, and in the corner of the page there was a picture of Tony, and a caption explaining his position in the society.
The dim light of the pub makes his blonde hair shine, and his eyes glint when they lock with Tony’s.
“I miss you, Tony, but I’m coming home”, he closed his eyes, and coughed again, but that was really not that big of a deal.
. “So you telling me she took everything from her mother?” he asks, mostly to test the waters. He cannot deny this stranger is quite interesting, but he would never interfere with a marriage, so it’s better to set things right away.
Then he had proceeded into lecturing Steve about nuclear power and galaxies, and every time he addressed a new subject, he made himself sure the blonde knew what he was talking about by first offering a foreword. Steve kept on looking clueless, making numb expressions and excusing himself because no, he didn’t know anything about that content either.
. Steve giggled a little, asking himself if Tony would have wanted to be referred to in such a mild way: Tony that had called himself with little to no hesitation a genius and a playboy. It was such a long time ago.
“Tony, hey, look at me” he urged, grabbing his face with his gentle fingers and making Tony turning back. “What’s the problem?”
“I’m kidding” he calls. “God, Steve, I’m really kidding.” He reaches out with an hand and takes Steve’s one.
“Oh god, throw away these damn pants immediately, Rogers” he commands with a slurred voice, and Steve meets his wishes right away.
He tightens his lips and puts himself to work. He’s a little out of practice, or maybe it’s just because he’s nervous he’s not going to make Tony’s face right, because he has to restart the drawing a couple of times, before finally making the shape in the right way.
Tony rolls his eyes benevolently. “Oh come on, army guy” he teases. “Can’t you handle some cold water?” He steps further, overtaking Steve, his legs slowly disappearing under the water.
The blond man keeps caressing his hand, soft touches that reminds him he’s not alone, and now Tony understands what Steve is really trying to ask:
, but Steve always tried to dismiss the topic. He never wanted Mary to think that she was not his priority, and most of the times he tells himself that she’s still young, and he should only worry about her, not about any other relationship.
“I’m sorry; I got scared. There was nothing at all and I got scared”, it sounds dumb now that he’s saying it, but that void had terrified Tony to the point that he had actually questioned the function of his own heart.
“Good night little hurricane” he says to Mary, leaving a kiss on the top of her head, and she chuckles at it.
Tony smirks. “Yeah? Is this a competition, Rogers?” he teases, and Steve laughs as he leads him to their destination.
Mary rolls her eyes again. “Yeah, yeah I got it” she affirms. “You know I always tell you when things annoy me” she shrugs.
He was at the coffee shop early, but he didn’t care. He needed to talk to Tony before he lost his zen. Unfortunately when he got to the shop there was someone in line before him. He could feel that anxiety creeping up at having to wait, but he just focused on the reason for why he needed to do this. He felt so disappointed in himself for failing yesterday and he was not going to let that happen again just because one person stood in front of him in line.
Tony shrugged. “Hey, you’re not obligated to be here,” he tried to brush off, but Steve could see that he almost glowed in relief, with a smile that lingered at the corners of his lips.
One time, long ago, his mother took him to see the city light up the tree in Rockefeller Center. One moment the entire block would be dark (even the buildings around the park turned off their lights) and then there was an explosion of light. The tree, the surrounding lights, the whole block behind them, everything glowed bright with millions of Christmas lights. Thousands of people cheered and applauded and sang as they felt overcome with joy and awe. The way his heart, his entire body just lit up from hearing those words…that memory was the only comparison he could make, and even that didn’t do it justice.
He saw Tony’s cheeks pink up in a blush, and god did he love it when he blushed. God he thought it again! He already accepted that’s what it was, so why did his mind feel the need to keep reminding him? He cupped Tony’s face in his hands and gave him a warm, loving – damn it! – kiss that just made his heart glow. It looked chaste on the outside, but it was so full of emotion from both of them he was surprised they could get away with expressing that much emotion in public.
“Oh don’t promise me that, or I may never stop,” he groaned before he closed the gap and gave him a solid kiss that was just polite enough to be used in public. He held the kiss for as long as he thought was socially acceptable before he broke the kiss, gave him two more quick pecks, and then pulled away. They had practiced a lot this morning how to pull away because they knew this moment would happen, and they couldn’t let it turn into last night where they couldn’t keep their lips away from each other. Not that they wouldn’t mind a round three, but it would be bad in front of the rest of the customers, not to mention Tony’s son.
As he left the cafe for the night, he looked up at the window he knew was Tony’s and gave a salute. “Hope he’s takin’ good care of you boss, ‘cause you deserve it.” He knew the target of his blessing wouldn’t hear it, but that wasn’t the point, and with a smile he began his leisurely walk home.
When he finally left the café, he decided to take that as a good sign. Half an hour of watching Tony’s butt move behind the counter trying to fill everyone’s orders put him in a great mood, and the fact that they’d actually managed to have a decent conversation filled him with a lot of hope. He even entertained the thought that maybe all the saucy comebacks were flirts, and that made his heart soar just thinking about it. He tried not to let himself focus on that hope too much and tried to ground himself in reality, but his heart refused to see it that way. In his heart, they’d made progress, and there was hope that this could actually turn into the relationship he so desperately wanted it to be.
“Yeah, I do,” he told him honestly. “I know it doesn’t seem like the right moment, but it’s the best way to fix this.”
Tony sighed. “While I’ll never say no to one of your hugs, because damn being pressed up against you feels good, and you smell good too right now, which is so unfair, but really Steve, I’m fine.”
“It really is good,” Bucky complimented. “Best macchiato I’ve ever had, really. I’d love to stay, but I gotta get to work. Steve, can I talk to you first though?” His question was very leading, and Steve immediately jumped up.
At three in the afternoon, on the dot, Steve stood waiting outside the café. He dressed pretty casual in a navy blue button down shirt that fit well everywhere except his shoulders and a pair of light-wash jeans. He leaned against the window of the shop as he scrolled idly on his phone. Surprisingly, he wasn’t nervous. He was excited and anxious for the date to start, but he wasn’t nervous. Everything just seemed so natural with Tony, and he wasn’t really expecting today to be any different. Really the only thing that would change is they could spend more time together and be more obvious about how they felt, and in Steve’s mind that could only be a positive thing.
Happy gave a long-suffering sigh. “Yeah, you must be a regular. Look, I’ll check the system and see if I can figure out what he does to make it special, but he never shares that stuff with me. Between you and me, I think he likes feeling special.”
He shook his head again before he turned to the pastry case. “Can we do the banana nut muffin today? I really need the potassium.” That run hit him a little harder than usual and he still had other physical exercise planned for the day.
Steve gave an amused half smile. “Not Bucky, that’s for sure. He’s too pretty and he’s too young. I know he’s my same age,” he clarified quickly “but I always felt like an old soul. I know I look young, but I don’t feel young. Fighting in a war, it ages you. I would try to pick up guys my age when I got back and it just didn’t feel right. They hadn’t experienced enough of life’s hardships and I just couldn’t relate.” It was a deeply personal answer, but then again it was a deeply personal question, and he pretended like he was giving that answer to Tony because he knew Tony was listening. “So yeah, I like my guys with some years on them. And I want someone a little softer, who doesn’t remind me of the military. And someone who’s not afraid of having a family.”
“You mean…so he’s not in the back or anything?” Steve asked as he felt his hope and enjoyment deflate. A huge weight of disappointment dropped in his stomach and he tried so hard not to let it echo on his face, but he was pretty sure that was a losing battle because Happy gave him this sympathetic look.
“Yeah, mine too,” Tony breathed. They kissed one more time before the door opened, signaling the first of the pre-church crowd. They separated only by necessity, and Steve took up residence in his usual spot, waiting to receive his coffee. He knew he’d have to leave eventually – his presence distracted Tony and he knew he didn’t devote as much time and attention to his other guests when he was there – but he was happy to hang around for awhile at least. So long as Tony kept the coffee and the occasional flirty looks coming, he had no reason to leave.
He had to agree. No matter how incredible their kisses felt, they weren’t close enough. He needed to be inside him, filling him with his love, getting as close to one being as they could possibly get. He heard a Greek myth once that humans were created with four arms, a head, and two faces. Their union was so powerful that Zeus split them into two separate parts and condemned them to spend the rest of their lives finding their other half. And while they never could rejoin with their other half, there were times they could get close. He was a Catholic so he didn’t really believe that myth, but if there was one time when he felt an overwhelming desire to be one with another person, with his other half, it was this moment.
“Oh you know what, I forgot to tell you,” Pete interrupted almost in a panic. “Ned just got this new LEGO set and we were gonna work on it Saturday night. Probably have a sleepover.”
“Actually, I am,” he admitted as he nuzzled his nose against Steve’s. “June twenty-ninth is…well it’s a shitty day, I’m not going to sugarcoat it, but you helped. Really muffin, you helped.”
Steve chuckled. “Monday is fine. Tony?” But really his mind was spinning because if Pete was gone all weekend…oh did he have plans.
Steve picked this time to wander again, looking at the photographs on the walls, especially the one of the inside of a car engine. He really knew nothing about cars or engines, but he could admire the beauty and the complexity of the machine.
Tony made his coffee in record time (their flirting had unfortunately created a line), but Steve gave a fake pout when he didn’t see the decorated layer of foam on his coffee. “What, no coffee art today?”
He pretended to give a suffering sigh as he pulled out his card. “I guess it really is the only way.”
. He could tell he was everything he had ever wanted from this gorgeous man. He whimpered as he jerked against him again, their bodies rutting together desperately.
That moment seemed to stretch on forever as neither moved. His skin still tingled from where they touched. But even though that blissful moment seemed to last forever, it stopped far too soon as Tony shook himself out of it with a blush and pulled his hand back and stood up straight. “I uh—I mixed in something new. It’s good I promise. Should last you through to-to Sunday. I gotta—other customers,” he stammered as he jerked a thumb behind him towards the register.
Tony turned to look at his son, clearly not amused. “Okay no, you need to get to school. You’re not ruining this for me. Off to school.”
“Are you looking forward to tomorrow?” Steve asked as he curled his fingers into Tony’s palm and ran them along his fingers. Tony’s fingers curled along with his and he could see him lightly bite his tongue, which meant he liked it. So he did it again in soft, repetitive motions.
They continued to make eyes with each other until Steve reached the counter. Immediately he put his elbows on the counter and leaned in. As Tony moved in, he felt that need to kiss him again. He’d never felt such a strong desire before. It held him completely in thrall, and it took every ounce of willpower to fight his body’s urges to finally bring their lips together and just
“Baseball game was totally Dad’s idea, and I’m not lying,” Pete said quickly, almost like he was trying to beat his answer to Steve’s question.
“A very good thing,” Steve agreed. “And on some very lucky days, I may get to see you twice, like tomorrow.”
That question seemed to brighten his expression and made his eyes sparkle. “Trusting the expert: you are a smart man…” he gestured for Steve to finish the sentence, and it took him an embarrassingly long time to pick up on that because he was too distracted with that sparkle in his eyes.
That caught Steve’s attention. How did Tony know he was a Captain? Was he just taking a guess? He thought back on their previous exchanges and he remembered having his military ID in his wallet – was Tony actually paying enough attention to notice that? That…actually made him feel strangely happy that Tony took that much notice of him. “That sounds great,” he smiled, and paid for the coffee. He let Happy work, and it was clear that he only made coffee the days that Tony wasn’t here because he didn’t have the same fluid process making the coffee (watching Tony was almost like a dance). But he stuck with it and produced an Americano for him.
He gave a small little sigh because that meant he had to release Tony’s hand, but he could also respect that Tony had to move people through the line, and he’d taken up more than enough time. He stood up and let his fingers rub along Tony’s one more time before he stood and produced his card.
“Sure thing,” Tony nodded, and he rang up his coffee before he turned his attention to the espresso machine.
Steve headed back to his usual spot at the counter, beckoning for Bucky to follow. As he walked over, he noticed Pete sitting in the same spot as yesterday (honestly, he wasn’t sure how he hadn’t noticed him before since he passed by him every day). “Hey Pete,” he greeted.
“Hey, do you want to help with the coffee or not,” Tony asked, refusing to look in Steve’s direction. Pete rushed over to help, and Steve had fun watching the two of them interact. Tony was such a good dad to him, attentive and caring and clearly devoted to him. It was heartwarming to watch them interact. Steve had never known his father: he died before he was born and his mother didn’t have the time to remarry before she was diagnosed with MS and passed away when he was young. Sure Bucky’s family had taken him in after that, but he never really considered Bucky’s dad a father either. But when he thought of a dad and what he would have loved to see in one, he saw those same qualities in how Tony interacted with Pete. He just knew he was a good father to him, and it only made his heart yearn for Tony more that he could be such a wonderful dad to his son.
“Tony, darling, these muscles are not just for show, so we’ll see who kills whom,” he grinned, but even as he promised they weren’t for show he flexed his biceps just because he could.
That caught him off guard, and he blushed as he looked down at his shirt. It was definitely tight, he would be the first to admit that, but honestly he was more focused on the fact that Tony was talking with Happy about his choice of shirt. That had to be a good sign…right? “Yeah I—I didn’t know they’d run this small, but I didn’t want to take them back.”
A feeling Steve could only describe as pure euphoria rushed through him. It cracked a giant smile across his face and made his eyes shine with joy. He felt an overwhelming urge to leap across the counter and embrace Tony or kiss him or show him just how happy he made him, but he knew he didn’t want to do that now. It definitely wasn’t the right time and he wanted to save that first kiss for something meaningful. So he did the only thing he really could do, and he placed his other hand on top of Tony’s and gave it a careful, gentle squeeze.
“You are a smart man Steve. I like you. One cinnamon roll coming up. Trust me, it’s going to play off the flavors in the coffee so well you’ll never order another blueberry muffin again,” Tony grinned. He rang him up and gave him the cinnamon roll before fixing his coffee. “And if you haven’t been able to read my conveniently-placed nametag, I’m Tony.”
There was an awkward moment of silence before Tony replied, and Steve thought it felt weird. That didn’t usually happen between them. If there was silence, it was intentional or because Tony was concentrating on making coffee, but this was something different. “Well hey, always happy to have some new customers,” he replied with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “So Steve, your usual?”
It didn’t take him long to find his perfect running path. Steve had only been in Manhattan for a few days, but he already decided Central Park was the absolute best place to run. The clear paths had multiple off-shoots and he even found an app that would map out an individualized path based on how far he wanted to run. It was perfect. Sure the park was a little crowded, but it was barely sunrise, so only the serious runners were out; he hadn’t been forced to slow down because of a crowd and he hoped it stayed that way. Before he deployed for his most recent tour, he had qualified and completed the Boston Marathon, and he planned on doing it again now that he was back.
Tony finished up with the other customer and turned to face Steve, a surprised look on his face. “Wow, you are five minutes early. I know Happy said you missed me, but I didn’t think it was this much,” he pointed out with a smug smirk.
He tried not to think about it as he drank his coffee. Like yesterday, Tony continued to talk to him while he made coffee for other people, and he kept getting signs that he was interested in him, but it just left him confused. He got Tony to open up about Pete, how his mom had left him when he was young and Tony stepped up to raise him. Pete even made sure to point out that his dad hadn’t dated anyone since he was young, which Steve felt like was an odd thing to point out, but he did feel better knowing Tony wasn’t in a current relationship. As much as Pete’s existence threatened his plan and everything he hoped to get out of his interactions with Tony, he couldn’t deny Pete was clever and witty and seemed to be just a good kid. And if a relationship with Tony was still even on the table, he wouldn’t mind Pete hanging around. He just hated the doubt his existence created.
He spent his entire run coming up with jokes. He was a funny guy and he could make people laugh, so he was fairly confident he could make Tony laugh (provided he could actually string a coherent thought together), but he felt like he needed some under his belt to reference just in case. He had some puns (he loved puns and Tony had used one to name his shop, so he must love them too) and some actual jokes, but mostly he was just trying to practice some of his witty comebacks. He even tested his wit on a stranger at a drinking fountain, and he gave him a genuine laugh, so he had to assume he was good.
Steve shook his head before looking into Tony’s eyes. “No, nothing like that. I just…I wanted to make sure that
“You know, Tony’s never gonna ask you,” Happy said over the noise of the espresso machine, which perked Steve out of his thoughts.
“Much more convenient,” he breathed out. He felt his heart inflate so much he thought he would float away; he was just so happy. Somehow he managed to get Tony’s cell number. That had gone better than he ever hoped it would, than he ever planned it would. He had no idea what he was going to do with it, but he had it, and that was all that mattered to him right now. He watched him scribble it on the back of a business card and slide it across the counter. Steve shot his hand out to grab it quick so their fingers could touch again. He wasn’t disappointed as that same electricity tingled where they touched, shooting a pulse through his entire body that woke him up more than any coffee or run ever could. He slowly pulled the card towards him, letting his fingers run along Tony’s. Right before they separated, he felt Tony slide his hands forward just a bit to prolong that touch before he finally let them go.
But it seemed like those reassurances fell on deaf ears as the flustered and worried barista tried to make it through the rest of the day. Even for his last customers of the day, he still looked up hoping for his Captain Americano. He only resigned himself to the fact that Steve wasn’t coming when he turned the sign on the door to CLOSED with a sad, crestfallen look on his face. All he could do was hope for tomorrow.
Steve groaned as he stretched his neck out for Tony instinctively, loving the feel of him being there. “You might not want to do that; I got really sweaty from my run and I bet I stink.”
Pete just shined like the sun, and he looked happier about the mix-up than Steve was. He placed a blueberry muffin on the counter and said “For the ‘studmuffin’,” with a wink and air quotes.
It was still dark when two men walked into the coffee shop. They unlocked the doors and flipped on a few lights in the back, but kept the sign on the door set to CLOSED. Hand-in-hand they walked into the back kitchen and separated with a kiss.
“Well that’s an unadvertised upside to this mug,” Steve pointed out. “You should have led with that.”
They remained close, and Tony closed his eyes as he licked his lips. “Hello to you too,” he murmured. “You know, this kiss reminds me, when’s our next date? Because Monday wasn’t really a date. And I haven’t been able to feel you since Sunday, and that kiss is telling me it’s been way too long,” he whispered in Steve’s ear.
Steve walked into the café, an extra spring in his step because honestly, this was still the favorite part of his day. Even though they texted pretty much all day and had maybe taken to calling each other at night (God he sounded like a teenager) it was so much better when he could actually see him. He got in a little earlier (his times were just getting better and better now that he had something to look forward to at the finish) and was happy to find no one else in the shop. Tony was currently cleaning a coffee spill in the seating area and was too busy ranting about it to himself to notice him, which gave him a perfect chance to sneak up on him.
The barista had been right - everything did look better after drinking the coffee...including the barista.
He had a feeing Tony knew it was a lie, because there was a little twitch in his smile before he handed his card back. “Then I’ll make sure today doesn’t disappoint.”
“Tony, it’s fine, let the kid be happy for you,” Steve said gently as he squeezed his hand again, bringing Tony’s attention back to him as their eyes met. “Because he’s not the only one that’s unbelievably happy right now.”
He released the kiss and rested his forehead against Tony’s. “Are you doing better today?” he asked softly.
Steve kissed and sucked on his neck, spurred on by Tony’s whimpers. “Then tell me to stop,” he challenged.
Besides, he’d spent far too long worrying about how to do this right. He spent eighteen days trying to play the cards right and trying to make sure this happened, when he really just needed to trust their connection. And right now, that connection needed to see Tony sprawled naked on a bed. And as much as he wanted to be noble and do the right thing…he knew he wasn’t going to stop. He knew it as soon as he kissed Tony that he wasn’t going to stop.
“Well I love—it,” Steve finished quickly, face pinking slightly. “The pet name. I love it.” Why would that word not leave his mind?!
“It’s a talent, what can I say?” Tony preened, but it still felt muted, like his usual bravado wasn’t there. “I’ll have those right out.”
“Oh yeah?” he asked as he leaned in too. “Well I’ve been thinking about you.” He didn’t even ask for permission this time as he cupped Tony’s face in his hands and kissed him. Feeling that pulse, that warmth, that joy that came from kissing him recharged him, like he was getting a literal jumpstart. He pulled away from the kiss with a smile, but he lingered just long enough for Tony to press another kiss into his lips of his own before he pulled away. Steve licked his lips because they still tasted like Tony and coffee and cinnamon and they were amazing. “I missed you,” he murmured as he brushed his thumbs over Tony’s cheeks before he finally pulled away.
Tony grinned back, his face flushing as he licked his lips again. “My mistake. A date like that gets you free coffee…
Fresh off an amazing night with Tony and Pete, Steve practically whistled as he jogged the last couple of blocks to Jumpstart. Last night had been perfect. He lost horrifically at bowling (no one thought to warn him that Pete was a pro because he and his best friend spent hours figuring out the math behind bowling), but that was okay because it was still a great night. He and Tony had a fun time trying to sneak kisses or butt squeezes when Pete wasn’t looking. They definitely got caught a couple times, but the chances of getting caught made it all the more exhilarating when they managed to pull it off. But more than that, he felt like he really got to know Pete beyond his schooling and interest in LEGOs. And Pete never ran out of questions for him, which he took as a really good sign. Pete had taken an interest in him just as much as he took an interest in Pete, and that could only be a good sign for the rest of their relationship.
a kiss from Tony more than he needed to breathe. He had been waiting for their date to make it special, but if Tony was offering? He couldn’t say no. He just…he couldn’t. He knew he wanted to keep their date a surprise, but he wanted a kiss so much more than he wanted the surprise. “Uh…well I…um…” he stammered as he tried to think of a hint, of something to give him, but all he could do was stare at Tony’s luscious lips framed by that beautiful goatee.
He smiled at him as he squeezed his hands. “It does feel right.” He could kiss him right here, right now. They were so close, they were holding hands, he could feel Tony’s eager breath on his neck, but if they were going to be sentimental…he might as well go all the way. “Go behind the counter and ask me for my order.”
“No! No no this…this is good,” he replied as he held onto Steve tighter. But he did look up at Steve, his eyes full of emotion. Steve knew what emotion he wanted to describe it as, but he refused to even entertain that word. It was probably gratitude or fondness, or something along those lines. It wasn’t…no. “Thank you, Steve.”
Tony coughed nervously as he stood up behind the register. There was a decent line behind them, but it looked like none of them were anxious about getting their coffee as they watched the scene unfold. “Uh you should uh, text me. On that number. So I have yours. You know, while I uh, make your coffee,” he stammered, truly looking flustered, which was absolutely adorable.
“That’s quite a list of requests,” Tony finally observed as he placed the coffee down in front of Steve. It was in a mug.
“Wow,” he simply said, and Steve noticed him give him a once-over with his eyes. He couldn’t help but preen a bit at the attention. “That’s a new look. Was not expecting that. Where are the sweaty gym clothes? And more importantly, why are you late?”
Finally Tony’s face settled into a smile, and he reached a hand across the counter to touch Steve’s. His breath hitched as warm joy raced through him from where they touched, soothing his churning stomach and filling him with hope. “Just tell me where and when.”
“That’s good. I’m gonna need some clients to keep feeding this expensive habit you’ve locked me into,” Steve teased back as he bit into his muffin.
Pete had referred to Tony as ‘dad,’ which meant Tony had a son. Wait…Tony had a son? Like a biological son? Now that he actually looked at the boy, he could see the similarities, especially around the eyes and nose. That fond sniping they did earlier, it sounded familiar because he remembered Bucky and his father doing the same thing. It made sense and Tony would be about the right age to have a son Pete’s age. And honestly, he didn’t mind that Tony had a son. He had no problems with kids and had even thought of having one after he was done serving. He honestly didn’t care and if anything it only made Tony seem hotter, so that wasn’t what gave him pause. If Tony had a biological son, then that meant he slept with a woman…which did not bode well for his hopes at a relationship.
“Well I…I really like the coffee,” he answered lamely. It wasn’t a complete lie – he did really like the coffee.
Tony placed the coffee on the counter, that beautiful smile still on his face as he met his eyes. “Right, for the coffee.”
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder and massaged it gently. “Oh that’s going to be an even shorter conversation than you think,” he laughed.
Steve faltered slightly. He knew he hadn’t flat out said he liked him, but he had thought he was being pretty transparent about how much he liked him. Of course he wanted Tony to know he was available. Unless Tony was just asking it to try and save face? He couldn’t really see why, but he pushed forward anyways. “Just to, you know, set the record straight. I’m actually not dating anyone.”
The kid put down his phone and he could swear there was a flicker of a glare before he responded. “Hey Steve.”
Tony laughed – a rich sound that seemed to come from his very core and brought this wide, genuine smile to his face – and even though Steve was embarrassed about his stumbled excuse for an answer and being called out on missing him, he couldn’t help but savor that sound. His goal had been to make Tony laugh, and while this wasn’t the way he wanted to do it,  it was better than not hearing it at all. “Hey, it’s fine,” he assured him when he was sadly done laughing. “I’d miss me too. So, how about a real Americano today?”
“Well it was a great morning until now, because you’re upset about something and I don’t like seeing you upset,” he pressed. He knew better than to back down when he knew something was going on.
Tony planted his hands onto Steve’s pecs with a squeeze that just made Steve burn. He threw his arms around Tony and crushed a kiss onto his lips. These kisses were no longer gentle or soft but full of raw lust as he sucked on his lips like he was trying to pull out his very soul. Tony was so much smaller than he was, both in height and width, and it was absolutely exhilarating. With his broad shoulders he could wrap his arms entirely around Tony, and he used that hold to crush him close. His entire body trembled as he felt Tony pressed against him, and he whimpered into his mouth. He knew they needed to stop, he knew they were going to hit the point of no return the way they were going and he should say something now, but when Tony slid one hand down to rub at his lower abdomen, he dismissed that voice almost immediately as it came.
He knew Tony Stark’s reputation – albeit twenty years ago – and he had to wonder if he needed to stop now so this stood out from all the other encounters he’d had. Then again, he really couldn’t judge, because he and Bucky were both guilty of crawling the bars looking for someone to take home for the night. They were both adults, they were both experienced, and he
He looked down at their hands and sat quiet for a moment, and Steve let him have that moment to compose himself. “It’s the anniversary of when I was forced to sign over my dad’s company,” he finally said quietly.
This was it. This was the moment. All he had to do was ask if he wanted to do something, and he was in. It was that easy. Just ask if he wanted to do something – dinner, movie, anything – and they had their first date. But if it was so easy, then why was his stomach somersaulting in his abdomen so much? He could almost feel everyone behind him hold their breaths and he just…he panicked. “Just curious,” he said lamely, and he could feel the disappointment behind him. He could swear he saw Pete throw his head back against the wall of the booth out of the corner of his eye. “I never really asked what you do on your Saturdays.”
He left the café and on his way out he could hear Tony exclaim “What?” to someone else sitting in the café, but he knew better than to turn around and look. He needed to leave before he showed more of his deck than he meant to.
“My deal with Pete is that when he does well on a school project, he gets a reward, and for some reason that makes me doubt the mental sanity of my son, he always chooses to help behind the counter,” he shrugged, but there was a twinkle in his eye as he talked.
It seemed Tony was able to think quicker through the haze though as he stiffened slightly. “What did you say?” he asked.
Steve took in a long deep breath before letting it all out in one quick exhale. “I’ll try,” was the only promise he could make. This was worse than when Tony was gone for the day, worse than when he feared Tony might be straight or married. This was something that could actually interfere with the progress of their relationship, and it happened because he was too scared to say something. Maybe Bucky was right? Maybe he did need to say something, to make his intentions a little more obvious? It didn’t seem right, and he was honestly scared it would blow up in his face, but he had to do something to fix this. He had to.
Pete smiled wide. “Nope, pure luck. I wouldn’t even know how to arrange it if I could. Must have been a sign.”
“Oh, yeah, sure thing,” he said, and it sounded like he was being jerked out of some deep thoughts. He slid the stick into the hole in the lid, and his hand lingered on the coffee cup. Steve saw his opportunity and reached for the cup, letting their fingers touch again. That same electricity pulsed through him and made his heart beat rapidly. He looked up at Tony and their eyes met and he just held that gaze. His body cried out again for some other kind of touch, something more than just their fingers brushing against each other, but he knew he couldn’t. He had to ask him out first, and he knew today was not a good day for that.
Steve’s face paled and he bit his lip. “So there is a problem? I knew it. Something felt off today.”
He knew Bucky and Sam were sick of hearing about Tony. They constantly complained that Tony was all Steve would talk about, which made sense because really Tony was all he could think about. They told him he’d get this doe-eyed look on his face any time he talked about him and Bucky had to snap him out of his daydreams multiple times. So when he first asked Bucky to come meet Tony, he refused. He said he heard enough about him as it was and he’d meet him once they started dating, but when Steve unleashed all his worry about whether Tony was even gay, Bucky quickly changed his mind and agreed to go with him.
Tony shook his head, his hands quickly making work of the buttons. “Oh no, you are not denying me this. You have been hiding all this for way too long. I need to see it.” With the final button undone he threw open the shirt, openly gawking. “God
Steve jerked into his hand like the fires of pleasure themselves had touched him and his eyes rolled back into his head for just a moment. “Not as much as I need you,” he breathed back. If he didn’t have Tony now, he didn’t know what he would do.
“Oh uh, he uh, he just got it,” Pete stammered, and even Steve could tell he was making this up on the fly. He really owed this kid something if they started dating for all the work he was putting into it. “Ordered it this morning and it should be here by Saturday. So uh, I have to cancel our plans so uh, looks like you’re not really doing anything,” he declared with a grin before he pulled out his phone and started typing furiously.
“Alright, what are you two up to?” Tony asked when he placed the coffee down on the counter and eyed them suspiciously. “You two confidants are up to something, and you’re not that good at hiding it either.”
“We’ll figure something out,” Tony agreed. “Maybe we can talk about it tonight? Pete’s a pretty open kid.”
Steve distinctly heard Pete throw himself back against his chair, and he had to say he felt the same disappointment. He knew Tony wasn’t going to immediately recover and he knew he had a lot to make up for, but he had been hoping his hints would go better than this. Some part of him remembered what Bucky said, that he should clear the air and then ask him out. Was he waiting for him to ask him out? Was he trying to get him to cut through all the leading bullshit and just come right out and say it? He wanted to, he wanted to so badly, but he just felt this wasn’t the right time. He still couldn’t get a good read on him, and he didn’t want to mess up this pivotal moment.
The sun rose, reached its zenith, and set again without any sign of the new couple. And yet there was a warmth and a happiness in the cafe that couldn’t be explained, like the warmth and happiness of the owner bled into the very cement of the building and reflected just how good of a day he was having. As the final patrons left for the evening, Happy turned the closed sign on the door with a happy, satisfied smile. It was the smile of a man who looked out on the world and the people he knew in it and felt satisfied that they were being well-cared for. It was the smile of a man who had been waiting for a friend to have a moment like this, and it was the smile of a man who couldn’t be more happy for a friend.
Steve’s face lit up in happiness. He knew he didn’t need Pete’s permission – Tony was a grown man and could make the decision on whether he wanted to officially date him or not. He also knew the kid wouldn’t argue about them being boyfriends either. But he wanted that permission. He wanted Pete’s input and involvement in this decision and mostly he wanted to show Tony he cared about Pete’s input. He knew Tony and Pete were a packaged deal, and by involving Pete in this decision, he hoped it showed that he was aware of that and still wanted this.
“Careful Pete, if you talk Steve’s ear off now you won’t have anything to talk about tonight,” Tony teased as he brought Steve’s coffee and muffin over to the table.
Steve shook his head. “No Pete, look we really appreciate the offer yesterday, but you don’t have to leave the house every time we have a date. You have a right to your house too.” He did not want this blossoming relationship to uproot Pete’s life. He knew going into this date that Tony’s priority in life was his son, and he wasn’t about to take that away. Besides, they didn’t have to end every date in sex…right? But looking at Tony’s butt again…that would be real difficult.
He felt his face turn redder and he grabbed the coffee and took a sip as a way to shut himself up before he said something else stupid. “Okay well uh, see you tomorrow?” he finally asked as he left.
His presence caught the eye of the barista, with the keen eyes that glittered in the sun and the slightly graying hair that strangely drove him wild. He looked over at him with the smile that had seared itself into his mind all day. “Well well, look who’s back,” he grinned as he leaned against the countertop. “Guess my Americano was worth coming back for?”
He blushed furiously. Why would Happy have said that? It was a weird thing to bring up and he didn’t understand why Tony would care. “What? No I—I was just in a groove. Ran my personal best. It wasn’t—I just had a good run,” he finished lamely, trying to preserve some dignity. He knew seeing Tony was absolutely the reason he ran so fast, but he couldn’t admit that, especially not to Tony himself.
There it was again. This was getting out of hand. He couldn’t go two minutes without thinking that word, and he knew if he didn’t get a lid on it soon he’d say it aloud. He loved Tony, but he didn’t know if Tony loved him back (which was fine this early in the relationship) and he didn’t want to pop such a serious word and emotion too soon. If he couldn’t figure this out, it might happen, and if Tony wasn’t ready to hear it...that could end poorly. The rest of the time in the coffee shop he felt like he had to police his thoughts and make sure he didn’t slip up and say a thought out loud. And if he was struggling to keep it in now…what was he going to do when they were in the throes of passion crying out to each other? He knew he would scream out or pant out the word love and he wouldn’t have the mental wherewithal to stop it. Telling him outside of sex was absolutely a better choice, but he still feared it was too soon.
When Tony dropped off his coffee, he had a great idea, and he captured Tony’s hand to keep him there. “Hey, you two. What do you say we do something the three of us this weekend? Something fun like bowling? I’d really like a chance to get to know you better Pete.” He knew this was a genius idea when he saw that softness in Tony’s eyes again and the happiness on Pete’s face.
To say their date went great was an understatement. It was the best date he had ever been on. Watching Tony’s delight inside the car museum had confirmed two things for Steve: that he had done a damn good job picking a date, and he was falling very deeply for Tony. He didn’t think he could say love yet, which was a good and healthy thing, but he was a lot closer to it than he thought he had ever been after just one date. Everything Tony did - the look of joy he got seeing a car, the excited rambling about the car or the engine and how it worked, the way he would keep touching him or holding him – it brought him pure happiness. His heart was so full and it felt like his entire body glowed with warmth and light, and he knew it was because of Tony. He had always been sure of a physical attraction to Tony (and boy was that emphasized tonight because watching Tony lean over cars with his incredible booty sticking out made raw, hot desire curl in his abdomen like nothing else had before) but now he could confirm a strong and beautiful emotional attraction to him as well.
Steve actually had to marvel at how well that went. Usually he got really tongue-tied over his words when he talked with Tony and had a hard time saying what he wanted, but that conversation sounded smooth. It was like they hit a rhythm, and he just needed to follow it. And even though the topic had been embarrassing (flattering, but embarrassing), he made it through.
“That makes three of us,” Tony breathed, which made Steve glow as he exuded happiness. He could hold onto this moment forever, this blissful moment as he and Tony stared into each other’s eyes, their feelings for each other finally laid bare as he slowly stroked Tony’s soft hand with his rough fingers. It was intimate and wonderful and he never wanted it to end. But he felt a cool rush hit his back as the door to the café opened, and he realized there must be other people in line. He had already taken up so much time, and no matter how long he wanted this to last, it would be selfish to take up more of their time.
Steve walked into the coffee shop, face absolutely glowing. After going two days without his morning run, it felt so good to pound the pavement again. He made such good time he actually ran a bit further before jogging back up to his coffee shop. He never thought he was a man of tradition, but having Saturday, Sunday, and Monday be abnormal for him, he cherished the return to normal. He gave a broad grin at Tony as soon as he walked in the door – it felt so good to see him again.
“Well you won’t hear me complain,” he assured him. “Man with a body like that should show it off. Really the only one that should be complaining is that shirt. I can almost hear its cries of agony over here. Right along the seams there,” he grinned as he pointed to his shoulder.
“Hmm?” he asked as he looked up at Steve. “No, nothing’s wrong. I was just thinking about how I don’t think I made enough muffins today. But I’m fine. Speaking of muffins, how are you?” He smiled at Steve, and for all the world it looked like his normal smile, but he could see a sadness in his eyes. He was learning fast that with Tony, you had to look at his eyes. His face and actions and words would lie, but his eyes usually couldn’t.
Tony whistled. “Wow, handsome and brave. You really are a winning package aren’t you?” The bright red of Steve’s blush reached all the way into the blonde of his hairline. Sure he enjoyed being called brave, but it was hearing him call him handsome and a ‘winning package’ that made his heart sing. “I guess that’s a good reason for not being here.”
Tony didn’t say anything, but just curled deeper into Steve as he clenched his fists into Steve’s shirt. He took that as a sign he was listening and continued on. “It’s okay to be upset about what happened on the anniversary of today.”
“I didn’t want to put this on you,” he added, and he dared to let go of one of Tony’s hands to brush a strand of his hair behind his ear. Tony leaned into the touch, which was a good sign, so he kept going. “I know everything that happened with Obadiah hurt you, and if it happened to me it would probably make me afraid to trust anyone, even other people I started to care about, so I wanted to wait for you to be ready. I want you to be comfortable. You don’t have to say anything back. I’m happy waiting until you’re ready. I just want to be with you.”
“You don’t say?” Steve asked with a suggestive arch of his eyebrow. Was he offering for him to stay the weekend? Because if he was…he would take it in a heartbeat.
Steve’s forehead creased with worry for a brief moment before he answered. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say Tony was rushing him. “Of course, you know I’m not switching. And I’ll take your recommendation on a muffin too.”
Steve chuckled and gave him an apologetic smile. “Couldn’t go on a run today. I just couldn’t make the time fit. Between church and a formal meeting, I have just enough time for a coffee break. Apparently the army doesn’t care it’s a Sunday.”
“Oh don’t act so surprised – you know as well as I do there’s no way we’re stopping,” Tony pointed out, and Steve loved hearing him say that so point-blank.
You did it Steve! The relationship finally, officially begins! I sure made you wait long enough, but hopefully the build was worth it.
That caught him off-guard, and he stared in shock at Tony. No…oh no. No no. He had said it? How had he said it? He sure as hell had been thinking it after a kiss like that, but he thought he had a lid on it! He had a million reasons why he wasn’t going to say it, and he thought for sure those would hold out. Oh God, what had he done?
Steve hung out near the bar, but didn’t take his usual seat. Now that he knew where Pete sat, it felt weird to see his booth empty. Saturday was just an odd day in the café. Even the crowd was different – there were still some regulars like him that came in, but he could tell that everyone who usually came in before work was absent. It just made it all seem so lifeless, and he didn’t envy Happy’s job to try and keep everyone happy on Saturday, but it also helped him understand why Tony decided to take this day off too.
“No! No I’ll be—I’ll be quiet. Look I’m going to sit down and not talk anymore but—please don’t take this away from me!” he pleaded.
“I trust you,” he whispered back, and that close, quiet exchange made his heart flutter. That temptation to kiss him when his lips were right there was so great and it took such strength of will to pull himself away. “I’ll unfortunately need that to-go today. I want to leave myself enough time for subway travel. Oh, and a muffin too.”
Spurred on by his need to fix this and set things right, Steve finished his run again in record time. He felt so nauseous thinking about how he screwed things up with Tony that he didn’t eat dinner and he barely slept. He kept waking up, checking to see if it was time to get up. As he ran, he scripted over what he was going to say. It was going to sound rehearsed, but he didn’t care. He needed to make sure he got this right and he needed to make sure Tony knew that he wasn’t seeing anyone else. What Tony chose to do with that information would be up to him - he still wasn’t sold on Bucky’s suggestion to ask him out right now, but he’d use Tony’s reactions to guide him.
He never really saw himself as the kind of person that routinely visited coffee shops. Steve always assumed that was reserved for executives and social media celebrities, not regular guys like him. Besides, he didn’t have a job solidified yet (he had some leads sure, but no clear income), so now really wasn’t the time to start an expensive habit like buying coffee every day. But as soon as he finished his run he found himself facing the same street and he could swear he could smell the earthiness of the coffee all the way from here. He definitely remembered that coffee: the perfect blend of bitterness and nuttiness that played off his taste buds and kept him wishing for more even after he finished it. He was never the kind of person to finish coffee, but he finished that one, and far too quickly. Besides, it wasn’t just the coffee that was calling to him. He could definitely remember the smiling face of that barista…
“Well, if it isn’t my studmuffin,” Tony greeted as he leaned across the counter. “It’s weird to see you here so late. Did something hold you up this morning?” he asked with a knowing grin.
“I know, but I still missed you,” he murmured, not shy about saying it because it was true. He always missed him; even before they made their feelings known for each other he still missed him. The date just made him miss his touch as well as his presence.
“I thought about that this morning,” Tony smiled as he curled his fingers against Steve’s hand. “I like the sound of that.”
Tony set down a bag of coffee beans and turned to face Steve. “Already dreading tomorrow?” he asked with a smirk, and Steve was very happy to be greeted with that smirk. Today was already going better than yesterday.
“Well well, he finally arrives!” Tony remarked, and Steve could almost feel a sense of irritation that he made Tony wait. “I was starting to get worried about you. Usually I can set my clock by you. Any reason for all the dawdling outside my shop? Don’t think I didn’t see you.”
“Oh uh, I started a new job today and I thought I might change things up in celebration,” he finally decided to say. It wasn’t a complete lie, but it was absolutely not the reason. Starting a new job was actually a better reason to do the opposite and leave so he could ensure he was at work early, but that didn’t matter right now.
“Jealous? No…I didn’t see that,” Steve admitted. “Distant and distracted, but not jealous.” Why would tony be jealous? It didn’t make any sense.
times he wanted to kiss him but didn’t because it was too public or just didn’t seem right. Those desires were driven by lust, and he wanted their first kiss to be driven by emotion. Besides, he wasn’t quite sure he’d be able to hold back after he touched those lips for the first time. “You could have always kissed me,” he reminded with a smirk as he took a step closer so their bodies were right next to each other, but still not quite touching.
“It hasn’t even been twenty-four hours Steve,” Tony chuckled, but that same softness that occasionally crept onto his face showed itself again.
“But I have to fix this! I really like him Bucky! I can’t—he has to know we’re not dating!” he argued emphatically, arms gesturing wildly to make his point.
“Uh no, I learned my lesson,” Tony chuckled. “You’re not going to torture me with that display again.”
That…was a great question. He knew the answer to that question, of course he did, but he didn’t want to own up to any of the real reasons he wanted to stay. Unfortunately, he hadn’t planned ahead enough to realize that he probably needed to find an excuse for changing up his routine. Honestly, the real reason he wanted to stay wasn’t because of his butt (contributing factor though), or his smile (also contributing factor), but because he wanted to have a chance to talk to Tony, get to know him. He felt like he needed to, before he let this go any further – whatever this was.
This is also going to be the chapter that earns the mature rating for this fic. If that makes you uncomfortable, I completely understand. You're safe to keep reading until they mention the counter being in the way. After that scroll down to the notes for a safer summary.
“You’re going to distract me,” he warned, but even as he gave his warning he opened up his neck to give Steve more space.
“Monday it is! I bet we can get Happy to close,” Tony added. “But I’m warning you Steve, my son’s a math genius and I’ve always killed at bowling and pool, so you might regret this.”
“Sure you don’t,” Happy scoffed. “The whole shop can see it. I’ve been taking bets today with the regulars. Anyone who’s seen you two in the shop together can see it. Just make it happen – you wait too long and you’ll lose the spark.”
He heard something drop from Pete’s direction again, which he took as a sign that he was progressing in the right direction. It was a gutsy request, but if Tony responded well to this, then he had hope for when he asked him out officially.
Steve chuckled as he walked up to the counter. “And today is reminding me why I do. But Tony, this is Bucky. Bucky, Tony,” he introduced simply. “I’ve been telling him nonstop about this place and the coffee and he wanted to give it a try.”
“And he will, tomorrow,” Bucky assured him. “Look, he’ll have a shitty day and a shitty night, but it’s better for him to hear it tomorrow. He’s not going to listen today, or he’ll think you’re being dishonest. You gotta trust me on this Steve.”
It was rushed. It came out a little jumbled. It was a nervous mess, but he did it. He finally did it. He finally asked the man he really liked if he would go out with him. For better or worse, regardless of what Tony said or how that date went, he could at least say he asked him and gave this a try. Honestly now that it was out, he really didn’t know what he had been so worried about. He had charged into battle and led men to seemingly impossible victories, but this was what held him up? Now that he was on the other end of the question, it all seemed so silly, but then again, everything seemed easier after you already did it.
They continued to talk for half an hour as Steve drank his coffee. Of course Tony was interrupted by taking orders and interacting with other patrons, and Steve made sure he had a chance to do that, but by staying in the café he actually learned a lot. He learned that Tony used to be an engineer and was actually part of a very successful business empire before he was forced to switch careers and start up a coffee shop. Steve also realized that it wasn’t something Tony really liked to talk about, so he quickly changed subjects. He learned that Tony used to fix cars and build robots (which Steve found very impressive because he could barely use a computer) and that he made a lot of his own modifications to the espresso machine over time. In turn, Steve opened up about how he just moved to the city from Brooklyn and how he’d just gotten back from serving in the Middle East. He talked about how all he’d wanted to do since he was a kid was serve his country, but he never really thought about what he wanted to do in between service, so he was going to try personal training for awhile.
He blushed slightly as he smiled at Tony. “It’s nothing compared to you,” he marveled while his eyes made another pass over Tony in his outfit. “You look damn good.”
Tony shook his head as he looked back over at Steve. “Well you heard my son, I guess I’m not really doing anything. Why?”
He pulled away from the kiss as he raised an eyebrow. “I’m not letting you distract me. We may not have been dating for long, but I know when you’re upset. Come on Tony, I’m your boyfriend; you can talk about stuff with me. That’s what people do when they…like each other.” That pause had been crucial because he wasn’t actually sure which word would pop out, which was weird. It’s not like he’d even been thinking about that other word, so why did it feel like it was going to pop out?
He let him save face and went around to his usual spot on the counter, but honestly he thought the whole thing was adorable. He was over-the-moon that Tony thought he was a stud because God did that make him feel good, but he also loved how Tony’s mouth worked faster than his mind and he had to struggle to catch up. It was so endearing that he got so embarrassed. That moment, and so many other adorable moments like that were what made him fall further and further for Tony.
“No, hang on, I have something to say,” he interrupted in one big breath, and he didn’t even have time to focus on Tony’s shocked expression before he just continued on. “I like you Tony. A lot. And yesterday I asked if you had plans because I want to take you on a date.”
“Mm, good point,” Steve chuckled. “Well I guess it’s my turn so I’ll figure something out. I have to say though; you really picked a doozy with that baseball game. How did you know it’s my favorite?” He really had though. He remembered watching baseball games with his mom while she was still alive, and once he got stronger he actually played on his high-school baseball team. He would listen to baseball games in the Middle East for a bit of home, and he would try to go to as many games as he could. But out of all his baseball experiences, this had been the best one because it had been with Tony. And the length of the baseball game was a perfect time for them to talk and get to know each other even more, and he treasured every moment of that date.
With the baking done Steve agreed to help Tony ready the shop for opening (essentially doing Pete’s usual activities); it was the least he could do after making the baking take longer than expected. While he unfortunately couldn’t be attached to Tony, he absolutely found excuses to sneak past him and squeeze his butt or give him a kiss, and he was glad to see that Tony would do the same. The shop was able to open right on time, and Steve was first at the counter.
Aww Tony! So noticeably disappointed that Steve wasn't there...and Steve wasn't even there to see it.
“Yeah about that, you still giving out hints?” Tony asked with a smile. “I’ll give you a free muffin.”
Tony seemed to notice the same because he pulled away and looked behind Steve before he started entering an order into the computer, but he did it with just one hand so the other could remain encased in Steve’s broad hands. Steve finally forced himself to break contact, and he slowly slid his hands away from Tony’s to reach for his wallet and grab his card. He paid for his coffee and muffin and retreated to his spot. He did manage to cast an apologetic look at the people in line behind him, but they didn’t seem mad at all and all gave him thumbs ups and silent cheers for his victory.
That brought a smile to Steve’s face, knowing that Tony was still keeping his blend a secret. “Yup, that coffee,” he said as he presented his card.
Tonight was another date night. And even more importantly, this was the first date they would go on as boyfriends. That meant something important to him, to officially say he was going on a date with his boyfriend. It made this all even more real, and he loved it. He wanted to say he had this huge night planned for their first official date as boyfriends, but he really didn’t. Every other date night had been in public, and even when they interacted on a daily basis they had to tone things down because they were in public. And then when they finally got some privacy, they were so starved for physical affection they threw themselves on each other and didn’t stop until the afterglow. He wasn’t complaining – he loved the sex and he loved the dates he’d been on, but he wanted something more intimate tonight, and with Pete out of the house, he intended for the entire date to happen at Tony’s flat.
It might seem small and it might seem innocuous to the strangers who passed by, but to Steve, this was the most important place in the entire world. This little café.
This was one of those important moments in a relationship where he had to show he was supportive and understanding of the troubles his boyfriend had faced in the past, and how he handled this would be a sign on how he could handle things in the future. He had to do this right. He turned to the rest of the room. “Tony’s gotta grab something out of the back. He’ll be right back. Pete, can you step in?” he asked, giving him a significant eye.
Steve chuckled as he ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, happy to let him save face. “I know, it’s cruel of me to hold you after a run.”
Tony remained silent as he averted his gaze down to the ground. He could almost feel his mind whirring, but he had no idea what it was whirring about. But he didn’t let go of his hand and he didn’t shrug away his other hand, so he tried to be patient and let Tony think through whatever he needed.
it made desire burn in his gut. “Because I believe you promised me a kiss on this date, and because I’m not blind I
you,” he stressed, and to punctuate his point he slid a hand down under Steve’s pants to grip around him.
Tony groaned and it was clear he had the same desire Steve had – save their first kiss for their first date - but it was still a fun tool to use for teasing. “Can you at least let me know what I should wear?” he pleaded.
As soon as they were inside Tony turned to face Steve and grabbed both his hands in his own. Throughout the night they had both instigated their share of physical contact, which was great: it meant they were both invested and both craved each other’s touch. “I had a feeling we’d get a little more privacy in here.”
The entire coffee shop melted away until it was just the two of them and their love shining through that kiss. He didn’t even notice the counter anymore because he was just so focused on Tony. He loved this man so much, and the more he kissed him, the more that love permanently etched itself onto his heart.
He ran a hand through Tony’s hair as he kissed him back, not caring about anyone else in the room except for Tony. It was like he could see into Tony’s heart and see how touched he was that he involved Pete and how much he loved the gesture of asking him. He could feel his feelings for him and his wonder that they found each other, and he loved every moment. It was intimate in a way nothing else between them had been as they shared this true emotional moment, and he wanted it to last forever.
He curled his hand in Tony’s hair, kissing him with all the love and passion he could muster. “I love you, Tony,” he finally panted out. “I love you. I love you.” He’d say it a million times, as many times as Tony wanted to hear. He would never grow tired of saying it.
“I saw the way you cooked Friday night – you’re not touching them,” Tony said with a teasing grin as he pulled out bulk ingredients from cupboards and shelves with the rote memory of someone who had done this many times. “You are, however, allowed to touch me,” he suggested as he craned his neck around to give Steve a wink.
Tony frowned slightly, and Steve hoped it was because he didn’t like anything getting in the way of their time in the mornings. To Steve, this time was sacred, and he hoped Tony felt the same way. “Well at least Pete’s been here to keep me company, since you decided to be late and all,” Tony replied, and he moved aside to show Pete behind the counter.
Steve jerked a thumb behind him to gesture towards Bucky, but his gaze never left Tony’s face. “It’s all his fault; he was running late.”
Steve put a reassuring hand on Pete’s shoulder. “You’re such a good kid Pete, but we’ll be okay. If this is going to work, you need to be able to live your normal life, and I don’t want to mess with that. We’ll figure something out, but sleeping over at your friend’s house isn’t it. I promise, we’ll be okay.”
Every time he heard someone approach he looked up, which was quite often given that this was New York City on a weekend and there were a lot of people on the street, but finally he was rewarded with Tony’s smiling face. It was clear that Tony had the casual look down, with a faded Guns & Roses t-shirt under a sport coat and jeans that were just tight enough. That sport coat hugged his body just right and the way those jeans sat on his hips should be illegal. He looked sexy and hot and he couldn’t believe he got to have his attention for an entire evening.
He felt his heart leap at the thought of holding Tony in his arms again. “Oh I can do that,” he murmured as he enveloped Tony into his arms from behind. Tony fit just perfect against him, like their bodies were crafted specifically so every curve would meld together when he held him. He could wrap his arms around him easily, hands splayed across his chest and abdomen. He took specific care to make sure Tony’s arms were free so he could bake while he held him. He pressed kisses into the top of Tony’s damp hair (they had better things to do that morning than spend time drying and styling hair) and he could hear Tony moan in approval.
Saturday morning came and went with no sign of Tony…and no sign of Steve. Given the excitement that was starting at the coffee shop later in the day, Steve knew that going in the morning would just be torture because it wasn’t time for their date yet. So he broke his tradition for the second time that week and didn’t go to the coffee shop in the morning after his run.
Time continued to pass – seven o’clock…seven fifteen…seven thirty…eight o’clock…nine o’clock… The morning continued on. Customers walked in and out of the coffee shop. The morning rush died down. But there was still no sign of Steve.
He sighed, because he’d been having the same thought all last night. “I know, me too. But I needed you to have a day off. It’ll be worth it though once you see what I have in store,” he bragged.
“Thanks kid. Not used to seeing you behind the counter,” he observed. It shouldn’t surprise him that arriving late just meant that everything else would be wrong too. Maybe Pete was always behind the counter this time of day? He actually had no idea.
Steve felt his heart flutter and he gave Tony a wink before he slid over to us usual spot. He watched Tony make his coffee (staring at his butt was even more tortuous when he knew exactly how it would feel in his hands) and he definitely caught a limp in the usual swagger of his hips. He felt a wash of pride because he knew he did that to Tony, and the memories of what made him so sore, both last night and this morning, were incredible.
Tony turned to give him that saucy look that he seemed to be fond of giving him (not that he minded). “Of course it tastes better in the mug, because then it comes with my company.”
this felt. He’d kissed men before, he’d kissed a lot of men, but none of those kisses ever felt like this. There was electricity here that he couldn’t explain, and it left him breathless and needing more. He had no idea how long he held that kiss, but when he finally released Tony’s lips he went back for three smaller kisses before he pulled away. That had been one hell of a first kiss and it left him dizzy and breathless and completely addicted.
Jumpstart was quiet today. Unsurprisingly, Tony was enjoying his day off, which meant the cafe lost a little of its magic. Tony really was the light that kept the place alive, and while there was still business on Saturdays, it would never be the same as the days when Tony worked.
you wanted to make good on that promise multiple times at the museum and a couple times at dinner, but since you didn’t…I had a feeling you were waiting for a little privacy.”
to him? They awkwardly tried to hide their arousal from the street as Tony shut off the lights and locked up the café and headed to the entrance to the apartments, both of them thrumming with need to touch each other in the most intimate way possible.
He gave Happy a chance to look in the system, but he knew it was a lost cause when Happy shook his head. “Yeah, all he’s got down here is ‘Captain Americano’ but nothing on what that actually is. So I’ll just make you the best Americano I can, deal?”
That was a fair concession. It was New York City, which meant the available activities for a date could be anywhere from something physically active to something incredibly formal, so a little direction would be nice. “Casual clothes. Comfortable shoes. Really anything you want, so long as it shows off that cute ass of yours,” he smirked, eyes twinkling. It was a very obvious and forward flirt, but something just told him they were at this level of flirting and that it would be okay.
“Yeah, she was a nice car,” he sighed. When Steve looked over, it almost looked like a shadow passed over him before he perked up again. “Sadly keeping her wasn’t in the cards. But that’s okay; in the city you don’t really get much use out of a car. Anyway, here’s your Americano,” he offered as he placed the coffee on the counter. “Hope she’s just as good as she was yesterday.”
“Can I help you?” he asked with a no-nonsense voice that was still kind, and Steve realized he’d stood there frozen for a few suspicious moments.
Tony just shook his head as he pressed his nose against his neck and took a deep inhale with a dopey expression on his face. “Steve, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but you smell
“Stevie, it’s way too early,” Bucky groaned. “You’re lucky I got up for you at all. Now can we do this so you can stop worrying and get back to flirting?”
Tony chuckled as he relaxed and leaned back against Steve. He turned his face into his neck and gave him a quick kiss before he nuzzled into his neck.
“Definitely two,” Tony replied quickly, and Steve felt a rush that Tony was on the same page as him. Last week had been great getting to spend the morning after together, but they always knew there was a time when Tony would have to leave for work. But if he could stay as long as he wanted on Saturday…that morning cuddle could last as long as they wanted, and he really liked that idea. Besides, getting to spend that much time with Tony? How could he not be excited for that?
“Pete, you heard him: grab a muffin for the studmuffin and then I’ll show you how to make the coffee,” Tony requested. Steve turned bright red at being called a studmuffin, and it looked like it took Tony a few moments before he realized what he said. He blanched and blushed as well before he busied himself making coffee, not making eye contact at all.
“I always enjoy this show,” he promised as he stared transfixed at Tony’s butt in his jeans. He had no idea where tomorrow’s date was going to go and he was forcing himself not to have any expectations, but he did have a wish list: one was a kiss, and the other was to finally get to touch that ass.
Steve pointed at the picture he thought he was referencing, and walked over to it for a closer inspection. It was an old, classic muscle car, and it looked like it had power and speed. “She looks nice.”
Steve nodded his thanks and left the cafe before he did something else that made him look like an idiot. Maybe his blood sugar was low or maybe he pushed too hard on the run, but something had turned his usual calm and controlled manner into a bumbling idiot, and he knew that barista Tony had something to do with it. He usually didn’t fall apart around other guys - Bucky taught him enough to do okay - so why was he falling apart? It didn’t make any sense. But as he was leaving the store, he took a look back and saw Tony leaning against the bar talking to some teenage boy in the cafe, and his eyes lingered before he finally left.
“Good morning yourself,” he returned with an honest, gleeful smile. “How is my favorite barista this morning?”
“Okay, you’re fine. That’s good,” Steve allowed. He didn’t believe it, but he was going to allow it for now. “I’m still giving you a hug, because I wouldn’t be fine.”
Tony returned that smirk and it almost made Steve go weak in the knees. “It is cute isn’t it?” he bragged. “Tell you what, I’m going to start making your coffee, and then you can go watch my cute ass work.”
“New job huh? Darn, should have asked you sooner to be our spokesperson, but guess that’s off the table now,” he sighed as he shook his head like he was disappointed, but his voice was dripping in sarcasm.
Pete smiled, looking reassured for the moment. He set a muffin down in front of Steve before he walked over to the cabinet to load up more pastries.
Steve walked up to the counter, leaning against it so he could be closer to Tony. “This,” he said simply as he reached across the counter and ran a hand along Tony’s cheek. He could feel Tony’s head lean into that touch like he’d been craving it, and he wasn’t the only one. He leaned far over the counter, closing the gap between them. He stopped just inches from his face, so close he could feel Tony’s breath upon his lips. “I’ve wanted this since we first met,” he breathed. He held that teasing, tantalizing moment for as long as he could before he finally let their lips touch.
It was all too much. Everything about Tony aroused him and he had been fighting a losing battle since they first kissed, but he couldn’t fight it anymore. He swelled thick and heavy against Tony. When he thought about the point of no return, this was what he had been referring to. He hit the point where he didn’t want to stop,
Steve just stared at the glass menu, not really knowing what to pick. When he was overseas, he was lucky to get coffee, and even then it was usually black and watered down and terrible. He’d developed a taste for black coffee, but with so many options now he really didn’t want to limit himself. “Uh I don’t--I usually drink black but do you--do you have any recommendations?” God, he was tripping over his words. That was so unlike him. Usually he was so sure-footed and direct and he didn’t have a problem barking out orders even in the heat of battle. And this wasn’t the first time he’d talked to a beautiful man either, so what was wrong with him?
Steve smiled at him as he took his card and sat down in his usual spot. He barely had time to get a good glimpse at Tony’s butt before he heard Pete strike up conversation behind him. “So you’re not dating Bucky?”
Tony seemed to put a little more swing in his steps as he finished Steve’s coffee, like he was purposefully putting on a show, and Steve was absolutely okay with that. He finally brought his coffee over, and Steve stole just a few more moments of Tony’s busy day to stare into his eyes before he let Tony go to take more coffee orders. But he still kept up the flirting and he definitely still kept watching Tony move. He felt like he had to keep stealing these moments of time with Tony, holding on to whatever ones he got and keeping them together and sacred in his mind, but tomorrow…tomorrow he got an entire evening with Tony. There wouldn’t be other customers or his son or anyone else to take his attention. And if these little magical moments were precious, he couldn’t wait to have hours with this man. He truly could not wait.
Steve smiled, feeling like that was as close as he was going to get to an admission that he missed him, and he’d take it. It made his heart soar knowing that Tony looked forward to him being there, because he certainly revolved his life around when he could be here. “I’d be happy to do that. But you know, it might be easier if I had your phone number.”
Steve grinned and gave Tony another quick peck before he retreated. “We should go on dates every night if I get free coffee the next day,” he commented idly.
It did bring a grin onto Tony’s face and he swatted at his shoulder playfully. “That was terrible, but you’re also not wrong. Now go get your hot self over to your spot while I make your all-American drink; you get free coffee today too.”
If that’s what he was afraid of? And then it hit him – he was talking about Tony asking him out. He was saying Tony wouldn’t ask him out, but if Steve asked him out, he wouldn’t say no. He flushed a deep red at being called out about this. How many people were in on this? He knew Bucky was, and clearly Pete was from his leading questions, but now Happy too? “I really don’t know what you’re talking about,” he countered, playing dumb. He barely knew Happy and he really didn’t feel like talking to him about his relationships.
Steve wished he could focus more on the Captain Handsome nickname. He wished he could focus more on the fact that Tony thought he was handsome and that he had been giving him a nickname and talking about him that soon after meeting him, but unfortunately his mind was stuck on his interaction with Pete.
“Nothing, just asking Pete’s permission for something,” Steve replied, trying to sound casual about it, but he could tell that caught Tony’s interest.
He finally reached the end of his path, heart thrumming in his chest as his muscles sang in both agony and relief. He always found a calmness while running, and he loved the way his body felt afterwards, even with the soreness. The app popped him out in the middle of the park, and he had a pretty good idea where he was. He was a Brooklyn boy, born and raised, but after coming back from his tour he needed a change of pace and Manhattan seemed like the right way to do it. One of his buddies that he served with lived in Manhattan and he told so many stories about the restaurants and cafes and just the vibe of the city that he and his best friend Bucky decided they needed to experience it for themselves. So far he’d enjoyed his time here, and he was excited to get a job and settle into this New York City lifestyle.
Steve closed his eyes as he reached up to run his hand through Tony’s hair. “Remind me to thank him, and to call him handsome. I think he likes that,” he murmured before he kissed him back.
Tony pretended to think as he tapped a finger against his chin. “Tell you what, I’ll give you the same number of hints you gave me.”
Bucky jogged around him and held out his prosthetic arm to stop him. “Bad idea, Stevie. He’s mad at you right now, and going in there now isn’t gonna do a damn thing, especially with how worried you are. No good can come out of you going there right now.”
Pete’s face lit up as he turned to the front. “You won’t regret it sir--Captain!” he exclaimed before he rushed off to start the coffee.
Steve’s shoulders drooped as he hung his head. He found a bench and plopped himself onto it as he stared at the cracks in the pavement. “God, I really messed this up.”
Tony paused for a moment, their eyes locked, before he stood up and broke the spell they had both been under. “Nope I’m sorry, you have to pick one,” he decided as he grabbed a banana nut muffin and input Steve’s order into the register.
