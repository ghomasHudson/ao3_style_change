"W-who?" He asked and the Jagkar ran to a river. Patrick let out a noise, but when he didn't drown he got even more confused.
"It's okay." She ruffled his hair. "Why don't you sit down and I'll pour the tea." She said. Tony wasn't going to reject that. He took a seat after handing over the blue kettle. She poured everyone a drink and Tony watched happily. He giggled loudly, but then he felt his pants go damp. He looked down at his soiled trousers and moved closer to the plastic table, trying to hide his accident.
"No one." I seized up. My dad wrapped his arm around me.
He had a friend with him. I didn't know the other guy was coming. I couldn't say no because I was gagged. This guy just leaned to my ear and said:
"Are you the great Tony Stark  who took 2 men at the same time? Really? You're pathetic." He threw me to the ground.
"Alright, Steve." Clint said. He walked away. I don't understand school anymore.
"What do you mean?" he'd gone round the back to try and find Tony.
"Sex. The Jagkar want sex. Gender does not matter, it just wants to get its tentacles up inside a human and lay its eggs. Once its eggs are laid, it'll get into a sort territorial mode and look after the host." Fury said. "It's how they breed."
"What do you think you're doing with that little man?" The guy said, coming closer. "I'm glad you chose which weapon you wanna die by. Lets make this good." Before Tony could act he was back on the floor. His head whacked against the wall. He blacked out briefly. The calendar fell from the wall and landed over his face.
Nobody came. Tony had to calm down on his own. He wasn't in Afghanistan any longer. He didn't need to worry. Afghanistan was in the past. He stood up and left the bathroom. He felt uncomfortable, but no one was around. Steve wasn't even around, and that's what hurt him most because he needed Cap to be here right now.
a very honest person.
"Nothings bothering me. And I tried a bath." Two sentences which just contradicted themselves. Tony looked at Steve.
"Guys? What's going on?" he asked, but got no response. The building creaked again and then it started to fall. Steve had no choice. He took a step back and jumped out of the window, landing with a thud. He let out a groan.
magic happens. But right now Tony was
The creature stood in front of Tony, who had gotten dressed before following it.
He even named it. He called
He slowly slid more into his mouth and started to bob his head. His hands starting to fondle with the balls. Tony mewled and moaned. He wanted more. He wanted Bruce. But Bruce denied him this. Tony bucked his hips, forcing more of himself into Bruce's mouth. Bruce just took this as an excuse to suck harder. Harder he got. Tony's moans got loud. They could be heard echoing down the corridors outside of the room.
A change in Point of View
"Please don't turn down my music" Tony said, focusing soley on the work in front of him.
"Why aren't you greening up. Dude!" He said. Clint wanted out, that was clear. It stunk down there and was wet and they were under threat of that creature.
Tony smiled happily as he saw the little arts and crafts that his son had made. He picked it up and one of the eyes fell off, making Patrick gasp and quickly glue it back on.
As much as Pax tried to block the Hulk's attacks, his strong punches came through and then Pax went flying into the wall. When he fell out there was a hole in it. He looked between the Hulk and the hole in the wall and hissed.
"Ten past four." I answered. He closed his eyes.
Tony's mother started to ring people. She was in panic.
"Your father vanished last night." She said. That worried me.
"Im ok. I just... I cant find my wallet. I wanted to take Tony out and treat him"
"Of course I am alive." He chuckled. "It was only a small bump on the head."
"I want the full package" He said. I looked him up and down.
"Natasha!" He shouted. She jumped. He had his hand over his stomach. He felt sick. She looked at his stomach and then called for Bruce to come quickly. His stomach was moving, meaning the eggs had started to move.
"Tony?" He looked confused "I don't understand, I booked 'metal man'. Wait are you metal man?"
thinking. His mind was
Light reflected off the thing she pointed at, but they couldn't figure out what it was. Tony started to fly towards it and placed Nat on the ground. Together they went to investigate. Thats when something wrapped around Tony's armour and stopped him moving. But there was nothing there.
He tentatively opened the door, shocked to see it. To see him.
"Tony, this isn't my fault. I'm not the one who burned it down."
"Tony. You need to tell the police" Steve said to me. I shook my head. If I went to the police about this then I would he arrested. What I was doing wasn't exactly legal.
"You will do." it said.
"Steve. Please leave." I said desperately. "Thank you for the lift but please go. I'll see you at school tomorrow." He looked at me, like he could tell something was wrong. He nodded and left without another word. Now all I had to do was face my father. I really didn't want to face my father...
"I no want one." He muttered.
"JARVIS?" Steve asked. "What is going on?"
Steve lifted the lid which covered the sewer and Nat jumped down. He followed after her. They made a bit of a splash but the Jagkar weren't around to hear it. They didn't want to split up, but there was two directions to go. Nat went left and Steve went right. They were connected by coms. They weren't going to lose them like the others did.
"When I was finally able to remove the rubble, there was no Hulk or Clint. It was like they weren't even there to begin with. So that means-"
"What's happening?" he asked, scared. Steve walked over closer. "No. Don't touch me."  The tentacles were moving around on their own.
The next morning Tony was beating himself over what had happened. He felt guilty for waking up Steve in the middle of the night and it showed in his body language and face.
"You have a thing for me." He cooed.
"Leave him alone, Clint?" A ginger lass said. He sat back, listening to her. I could hear him grumbling. "Sorry about him, I'm Nat-"
"What?" Clint asked. He ran after him "Hey wait up. What smells funny?" Hulk jumped over the banister for the stairs and started to fall to the bottom. Clint sighed. There was no way he was going to do that, but he was on the 108th floor. He started to run down the stairs as quick as he could, but there was so many stairs.
"You okay their soldier?" Natasha asked. She was watching him get stuck under the bed.
Today Steve was playing whatever Tony wanted him to play. And what the little 3 year old mind of Tony's wanted to do was to have a tea party. Clint made it very clear that tea parties where for girls when he got invited by the little but Tony's response was: "Me a girl. You girl too." And so Clint didn't really get a choice. So everyone was sat on the floor around this little plastic table. Thor looked at it weird.
"Alright. Just know, he won't speak until he has his coffee in morning. Thank God its weekend because there is no way I'd be able to send him to school tomorrow." She said. I walked over to Tony and rubbed his back. He was just staring blankly at the table. When I touched him he turned to look up at me and then buried his head into my stomach. I ran through his hair comfortingly.
That shut Steve up. If he had to trust any shield agent it was Natasha. But only because he'd spent such a long time working along side her, and she had chosen to move in to the tower. She had become part of the Avengers family. He followed her to what seemed to be an abandoned factory, and then she walked inside. He thought about it, and assumed there would be a secret elevator or door or something in it, which led to a shield base. And he was right.
"Because I'm your friend, Tony." I feel like everytime I say that, I am friendzoning him. I don't wanna friendzone him.
. He carried him out of the room and to his bedroom. Tony was breathing heavily. "Why are we here?" He asked.
A light was at the end of the tunnel. It reminded Steve of when people are dying and they go towards the light at the end of the tunnel. For a moment he thought he was dying, but he wasn't. He walked towards the light and came out onto stone floor with a river in front of him and the white building. He looked around.
Patrick walked nervously into the medical room. When he saw Tony he ran to him and hugged him. He hugged tight. His head buried into his chest and he cried.
"Monsters." She said. "They are baby monsters."
"So its alive?" He was holding the egg carefully in his hand. Tony looked at her and then ran. He held the egg close to him. His child. One of them were alive. He would have gotten away with it, had he not bumped into Steve. Steve looked at him.
He stood up and stumbled his way towards the kitchen. The billionaire made himself a cup of coffee and sighed contently. He had a small smile on his face. Even when Clint came in grouchy, he had a smile on his face. Clint shoved Tony out of the way to open the fridge. In furnace, he was stood right in front of it.
"I don't know. We don't know what we're up against. Stop asking questions, Rogers, I'm as worried about them as you are."
"Steve... Is this really what you want? I don't want to do it with you if you don't want to. You can have your money back."
at Tony.
But Pax didn't understand pain, and he started to thrust.
"Tony, do you have something to tell daddy?" Steve asked. Tony shook his head.
"It wasn't hatching at the time. We put it in the fridge to stop it from hatching. Aparently they don't like the cold that much."
According to the map this school was split into sections so its pretty easy to find your way around here. Or it would be if I didn't get shoved around everywhere I walked. Public schoolers are so ignorant. Then again, I can be pretty arrogant myself.
We laid after it the session, spooning. I didn't usually do this.
Throughout the day, I was just thinking of Tony. I don't get why I can't get him out of my head, but I can't. No person has ever had this affect on me. Not even Peggy and she was my girlfriend for three years.
Since the battle of New York, Tony had been struggling. He was having a lot of panic attacks and anxiety attacks and he hated himself for it. Fortunately, the only person to see him have one so far was Rhodey. And Rhodey was the only one he wanted to see him like this, but right now- he was in a meeting and they had brought up
So the client today likes to give me pain. I just never expected... I mean of course I expected it. My heart pounded. He tied up my body, making me unable to move. My body was bound to whatever bed this was. This guy was insane. Usually its just whips and spanking. Today he wanted a change.
The day ended and I was glad that it did. But when it was time to go home, my dad didn't come. I don't know what I was expecting. He was usually late to collect me from school. And so I sat and waited. Thirty minutes went by and I started to get bored. That's when Mr Perfect came out the school doors with his little boyfriend.
"Nat. I don't like being called Natasha." I laughed. Suddenly I realised that I did need friends. And when Steve came in the classroom, guilt overcame me. I hadn't even realised he was in my class. He looked at me briefly and I frowned.
I left before Steve could ask me how we wouldn't work as a couple. It was just obvious. I'm not allowed to be gay according to my father. I know it's not fair but it's how it is. On top of that, I barely know the man and I don't want to just rush into a relationship. Though it's true. Love at first sight probably does exist. Well in this case it did. But love is just chemistry anyway. A series of chemical reactions going on inside your body. It's science, not destiny. Destiny doesn't exist, and I'm happy about that because if it is my destiny to live in a house with my homophobic father forever, I would rather die.
"Alright Buck, see you tomorrow." Steve said. I lifted a hand and waved a little before the male ran off. That left Steve and I in an awkward silence. Another thirty minutes passed. No sign of Dad.
Tony had
"Well, if I don't know, then I don't know what im trying to stop it from getting." Steve told her. He was right, and she had to admit that.
The Hulk saw the creature jump and land outside the window. He snarled before making a Hulk sized hole in the kitchen wall.
"Tony. Tony are you okay?" He asked frantically.
"You're a prostitute? I thought you were against that stuff?"
"Oh God." Nat mimicked Steve's words.
getting tentacled.
He just got a nod as reply.
"You know youre going to have to put your hood down and take the sunglasses off right." I said. At that he climbed back in his car. I wouldn't let him close the door. "Show me." My instinct had kicked in. I knew something was wrong. He sighed and took his sunglasses off. His eye was bruised. I put my hand over my mouth.
"Our invisible friend got them" Steve said. She nodded. They sighed. Nat crouched down to Steve and inspected his leg.
"It is not a request."
"But daddy!!!" He whined.
Clint and Tony in the kitchen
He thought, trying to make it more bearable. He was enjoying it at first, now he was hating it.
Tony sat up in his bed. Sweat dripping from him. He wiped his head. His boyfriend, Steve was laid next to him. Steve put his hand on Tony's and looked at him softly.
"You know the rules sweetie. A glass of water with your meal and then coffee in the morning." Tony nodded. He went and sat at the table. He looked both sad and confused. So innocent. "Would you like to stay tonight?" His mother offered. I nodded. My concern for Tony was large right now.
"How do you know?"
Steve's point of view
After school, I rushed to the garage. It smelt old. Dust and ash going up my nose. I could hear a saw being ran. But this place was abandoned, which meant that the only person who could have been using it was Tony.
"Hey." I said, walking over to him. He looked at me.
Pax let out a bit of a roar. Suckers came out of his tentacles and were doing what they did best. Tony looked over to his team mates. He felt so wrong but it felt so nice. A tentacle entered his mouth and almost choked him. He was completely Pax's bitch right now.
"It's just a job, Steve. I thought you were a Christian."
He carried me to his motorbike and forced a helmet on to my head. I was sat there trying to take the helmet off when he started the engine. I had to quickly grab hold of his waist otherwise I would have gone flying. I started to roll curse words off the tip of my tongue. I was swearing like a sailor.
I don't want to go with him. He will take me to his club where they drink, except I'm too young to drink, and shoot clay pigeons, which I find dull with them men. Oh and on top of that, they slag off youths and gays in front of me.
Break here was very different to the public school.  Well it isn't. A gathering of people surrounded me, lead by the kid which I now knew was called Clint. I stood up to face him.
I was not expecting Steve to stay with me. I'm a handful. I showered quietly then drank my coffee, looking over at my mother- who was pacing back and forth.
There was a total of 8 enterances and exits for this place. He saw Romanoff in the river ahead of him. She went up to him and smiled.
then they would have to give him some form of affection. Knowing Tony, the affection would have to get sexual at some point. Surprisingly, at the thought of it getting sexual, none of them were repulsed. The only one who felt a little uncomfortable about that was Bruce, and that was only because he was worried he might turn into the Hulk while doing something like that.
And, after about a week of watching, the egg started to move.
"Well, yeah. Don't change the subject though." Steve rubbed his shoulders. "What was your dream about?" he asked. Tony shook his head like it didn't matter. They both laid back down. Tony's head rested on the soft bit of skin between Steve's chest and Steve's armpit. He was comfortable. Steve gently ran his fingers through his boyfriend's hair.
"Do you have a thing for Natasha?" He asked. One thing just came to my head. I was new here. And so I said.
"Hey. How's your shoulder?" He asked.
"Who is most likely to have sex with a squid like creature out of them three?" Steve asked. Both he and Nat thought for a while. The answer was obvious.
The building started to creak and the air started to feel heavy. Something was going on. Steve managed to open the doors of the elevator and lifted himself up on the ledge, just in time for the elevator to rapidly start crashing downwards. Whatever was happening wasn't good.
"What next daddy?" Tony asked, looking at Steve.
started to lick around the shaft of the rich avenger. It swirled around with such expertise and knowledge. Licking around the ballsac, up and down the shafted and around the tip. Tony out
It begun. Tony closed his eyes, feeling overwhelmed. He wanted it to stop. He felt wrong. Pax's tentacles rubbed at his ass, begging for entrance. There was tentacles sucking on his nipples. There was now a large tentacle sucking on his member. And several tentacles rubbing against his chest and stomach. Some were choking him. He had a few in his mouth now. He closed his eyes and whined. How uncomfortable he was, was showing in his face and it concerned all his friends watching.
(See the end of the chapter for
The tentacles in his ass stopped moving and then started to get bigger. Some kind of fluid pumped through them, filling Tony up. His stomach got larger and larger as he was filled and then they stopped. They moved out of the way. The tentacle in his mouth released liquid, which he could assume was cum, into his mouth and pulled out. They all pulled out. Then they started to squeeze his stomach.
That gave Bruce chance to shoot at him, but Pax just whacked him away. Clint got back in the game and grabbed his bow. He lifted it up and shot an arrow. It went through 5 tentacles and then jabbed into Pax.
"Tony. I need to talk to you." She said.
"I-I'm thwee." Tony said in a shy voice. Steve wanted answers, but he would wait for adult Tony to be back before he asked any questions.
helped. The only person- well thing- to know about it was JARVIS and he had a good code. The door would be locked while Tony was small and it would take a while to override. As soon as JARVIS knew someone was coming he would blast out 'big' music so that Tony came through as a grown up rather than a 3 year old. It gave Tony enough time to hide all his equiptment needed to be little and get to work on his car.
"I feel really tired." He said.
"Are you free tomorrow?" he asked me.
"Y-You mean... That wasn't it?" He asked. His cheeks were stained with tears. Pax smirked and then it became clear he had a huge penis. Tony had only just noticed that. It entered into Tony's ass, tearing him a little from the size. Tony cried out in pain.
"If it becomes a monster, then we will deal with it then" Steve said, backing up Tony. Tony had lost so much recently, Steve wasn't going to let him go through any more pain.
"Perhaps it stopped trying." He said with hope.
The new guy came up to me and felt me up.
So I had suggestions to do Bruce and some to do Nat and honestly, given that Bruce claims he can't physically get sexual, I thought he wouldn't have to go all the way if I put him here. Were in Nsfw territory now guys.
His mother made him macaroni and cheese. Something that wasn't going to be too heavy for his stomach. He ate it without a word then I took him to bed. But one thought was stuck in my mind. Where is his father?
The male kept whispering "What have I done?" I suppose that means he's done something. Not that I knew what.
Bruce had noticed this, and thankfully, the doctor was willing to help out. He brought his gentle kisses down to the top of Tony's jeans.
"Dad isn't here yet" I said. Steve seemed concerned and looked around.
"You have fresh cuts." He sighed. The super soldier stood up. He towered over me. "Come on." He said. I shook my head and covered my arm.
Tony followed the creature. It knew what it wanted. It had made an alarm and summoned Bruce and Clint. When they were there the creature circled them. It was becoming intimidating.
He punched again, and again, and again, until Pax wasn't conscious any more, and then he kept punching.
"Now I know my toys name, we shall begin." Pax's tentacles grabbed Tony tightly.
"Are shield going to be able to help?" He asked. Natasha didn't respond. "Romanoff?" He asked again.
"It's stopped bleeding. Are you alright?" She asked.
"Tony. What's going on?" she asked. He was frantically tapping on his keyboard.
"Oh? When is a good time? You look handsome, by the way."  He wrapped the shower curtain around him tighter.
"Daddy. Daddy you're alive!" Tony smiled at him.
"That would have killed it."
"How bad is it?" Natasha asked. She was still laid in bed, her shoulder was recovering well.
"It's Tony. Not Anthony. I don't like being called Anthony."
elsewhere. Bruce had noticed and came over.
I was horrified. Tony had told me he had a new Client coming. Well this new client seemed to be doing something he really shouldn't have been. I have never been so angry.
"I'm not going to give you it now. You haven't made your appointments." I told him. He sighed and stood up.
"Hey... Hey knew boy." A male with short hair, which was like a browny blond colour said. He then threw something at me. "Do you actually get this?" My eyes stayed down at my work. Do not respond. I will not respond to idiocy. "You ignoring me new kid?"
"Who is- Who is Natasha?!" He asked. "Are you serious? She's the cute red head who saved you from getting spit balled in class."
"It took the guys" Nat said. "We have to stop it before it breeds with one of them."
The tentacle tore Tony's clothes from him and forced him to his knees.
place to work. Straight afterwards, you come home. You will be pampered and looked after. The best possible care. Look I know you need that job, thats why I'm not stopping you doing it. But if you think for one second that I am going to let you hurt yourself or worse over it, you have another thing coming."
I found myself covering myself up.
"Guys, can you put this away while I sort Tony?" Steve asked and everyone accepted. Steve grabbed Tony's  teddy bear and a couple of other things (pacifier and a bottle) and he headed to the bathroom. Tony was still crying heavily. He felt ashamed of himself.
"What is it that it wants?" Steve asks.
A tentacle penetrated his ass and wriggled around inside of him. Then another joined and then another. He had tentacles in him. They started to move in and out while still wriggling. His body couldn't take it. He came into the 'mouth' of the tentacle sucking him off.
"Oh it's nothing. Your father is just being... Well he's being your father. How was school?" She asked. She looked at my face and checked over my black eye.
Steve looked back at the manhole. He felt really weary about leaving his team down there alone, unprotected, with no weapons. Clints bow and quiver had been found in the rubble of the tower; Tony's armour was stoop up, open, by the man hole; and the last they had heard of Hulk, he was unconscious. Unprotected, alone, with no weapons. It made Steve feel uneasy.
Coffee is next on the list. I have a strong coffee and wear an oversized jumper. I try to get comfortable and sit on a sofa. I look over at the mantle. 'Proof that Tony Stark has a heart'. That old arc reactor sits there. I haven't needed one of them for a while. But its proof of me having a heart. That is a symbol of who I used to be before I lost it all.
Tony awoke the next morning to me handing him coffee. He didn't speak. He just took it and drank it, then he showered and got dressed. I looked at him.
"I'm sorry. I couldn't control them." He said sheepishly. He buried his head into Steve.
Tony teared up, hating every second of it.
"Did he follow me?" He asked. My mother didn't know. I ran out, with Steve following close behind. Then I found out where my father was.
I walked to school the next day, hoping to see Tony. Bucky told me that he was off today and so I had free range of who I wanted to talk to. Usually that meant that I hung out with Nat and Sam, but today I felt like seeing Tony. I wanted to make sure he was okay after yesterday. He rocked up to school in a red volkswagon and parked it. He drove it so beautifully. He stepped out wearing a red and yellow hoodie and sunglasses. I have a feeling he is going to be told off for wearing the sunglasses and his hood up though.
"No. You're.... Mother? was a monster. You aren't you are whatever you want to be" He said and took his hand.
"Tell me." Steve was persistant. Tony knew he wasn't going to get through the day without Steve nagging him to tell him what was wrong unless he told him. He took a deep breath and let out a sigh.
"Who is a good man?" My dad asked, coming through.
When I got there, he was working. He had a little assistance though. A robot was passing him tools. It was pretty cool. It moved around really well.
"Yeah I am free." I smiled softly. He looked at me.
I moved seat. I moved next to the red haired girl from before. What was her name again? Natasha. She shot a glare at Clint and he went quiet.
"Hey there, Tones" She said. Tony looked at her with some cheese hanging out of his mouth. He looked adorable and Natasha giggled a little.
"My time in Afghanistan." He said. He didn't need to say any more. Steve knew very well that the two months that Tony was in Afghanistan was hell. But he thought he was over it as well. Clearly not.
"That's not funny." Steve said.
"I'm fine with it."
"You were always good at sex."
"I love you, Daddy" he said to Steve. Steve's jaw opened slightly and he froze. He wasn't Patrick's daddy, Tony was. He couldn't take that away from Tony.
Thats when Steve ran in. 5:30 on the dot. He kicked the guy off Tony.
It took a while for the meeting to finish, and the longer Tony was out of the room, the more Steve worried. He left it- and not being able to find Tony anywhere in the building- he returned back to the compound. Tony was there alright. It was frightning because Steve could hear his cries. He rushed to the younger/older males room. Was Tony older or younger? Literally he was younger than Steve but biologically he was older. Nevermind, Steve had gone to his room.
"Patrick. Patrick is gone. It took Patrick."
"Can you stay? While I bathe? Can you stay in here?" I asked. He nodded. I got in the bath while it was still foaming and giggled at the feeling of the bubbles coming out of the bomb touching me. I leaned backwards and relaxed a little, holding my hand out to Steve, who took it willingly.
"Oh." It made another tentacle come out, "why not?"
"Two." He said. Bruce covered his other eye and asked the same thing, this time holding up 4 fingers. "Four."
Tomorrow I will have another customer. A regular. Hes a client. The guy enjoys giving pain. A sadist. I wish that I was able to use an alias on these jobs, but anyone with a tv knows who I am. I have 3 more days till my day off. My day off is always the same.
"Look after yourself. I want you to have a nice hot bath and relax. Tomorrow I will be asking what you did and if I am unsatisfied, I will force you to do relaxing stuff." He said and left. I felt warm. I felt happy. I don't know why though
"Where are they?" Steve asked as Romanoff returned. She looked at him and sighed. She was going to shake her head but thats like saying they are dead.
tame. Perhaps it was because Bruce's personality was coming through
"And they will be babies..." Nat said. She was supposed to stay in bed rest, but she began to move.
"But... That doesn't mean you're not my daddy. You and daddy helped me grow up. So you and daddy are my daddys" Steve tried to make sense of this. So, because he helped Tony raise Patrick, Patrick now thought that he was his daddy.
"Alright."
"But if he doesn't get rid of them, then he'll die. And we'll have how ever many of them creatures to have to deal with."
"Sluts shouldn't have rules. They should just be sluts." He said, backing me against the wall. His hands placed either side of me, trapping me.
"Ill run you one" He patted my back. He called me through once he was done, though he had just filled a tub with hot water. I looked at it, looking confused. He chuckled and handed me a bath bomb. "Drop it in" he said.
"I don't pity you, Tony. You are not the only person in the world to get a black eye. I don't care what you say. Everyone needs a friend and I will be here for you when you realise that." With that I walked away. I could tell that he was staring at me but I didn't look back. I wanted him to learn that I aren't pretending to care. That I actually do. But it is true, hes not the only one to get a black eye. The amount of times I went home black and blue. My mother freaked- every time. But I didn't tell her what happened. I just started to go to the gym and built up my strength so I could fight back. It felt good once the bullying stopped. Really good.
"Tony, they do love you." Bruce said. Tony shook his head.
And within a week- everyone knew. Steve just made Tony laugh too loudly by tickling him and playing with him and Clint caught them. Of course, the Hawk couldn't keep something like that a secret. But no one was judging. They were happy that Tony had found a way to be happy. They were also happy that Steve seemed happy to look after him, because no one else wanted to change the mans underwear when he wet himself- or worse.
The doctor went to Natasha first, since she was bleeding out badly. She got the help she needed and was put onto bed rest until she felt better. Naturally, she wasn't going to stay in bed.
"Nat" Clint said. Nat couldn't answer, she was more focused on what was happening to Tony right now.
Tony had always been a reserved man. It usually got worse after something stressful had happened. He'd shut himself off in the lab and not come out for anyone. Everyone assumed that he was just working, but he wasn't. Well sometimes he did work but a lot of the time he didn't. After Afghanistan he stayed in the lab for days, and Pepper struggled to override the doors to get in the room. By the time she got in, loud music with a lot of swearing in it would be blasting out loudly and Tony would be working on his beautiful 1932 Ford Flathead Roadster. She was non the wiser as to what had really been going on.
The inventor pulled down his jeans and boxers together, just far enough to let Bruce see his member. The doctor stared at it for a while.
"Where is he normally when he vanishes?" I asked. When she said the garage I ran out. She didn't know where the garage was, but I did. I knew exactly where I was going. I suppose with what happened between me and him, he had some thinking to do. But that didn't warren a full week in this place. Something else must be up with him.
"I'll teach it to be good. It could be an Avenger" Tony said, with a whimper. Steve looked between them.
"Daddy, I'm so sorry." He cried out. "Daddy, please don't die." Tony didn't really have chance to freak out about his head injury because his child was freaking out. His child had caused this.
"Oh. Well don't tell your father. He said if he ever found where that place was then he'd burn it down." I know that Dad had said that. Which is why he will never find out where that place is. "I'm surprised you came home if you were there though."
"You're lying to me. They are using me!" Bruce picked Tony up
Tony looked up at the man. His head had hit the ground as he was thrown and was bleeding slightly.
"Don't say that. You are banned from saying the word 'fault'.  It is not your fault at all." He said. I whimpered a bit. Of course it was my fault. If it wasn't my fault then whose fault was it? The guy went after prostitutes and jiggalos. I was a jiggalo. I had it coming.
"Yeah. I can feel that." Tony spoke. He put his hand over his head and sat up. "I think you need to get us a doctor." Tony said. Patrick wrapped his arms around Tony's waist and hugged him tightly.
"Do you wanna go see Daddy?" Steve asked. Patrick jumped up.
"Thank you." He said as he took it. "But I am worried about that too."
For a normal person, spending time in the lab was
I walked through the doors as the bell rang and people ran past me, shoving me slightly. This is exactly why I wanted to be at a private school. I swear my father is punishing me. I found the way to the headmaster's office and got my time table.
knew that Bruce wasn't lying. Bruce was
"Stay back!" He yelled at the man, who had followed him.
"Oh there's one more thing." Fury said through the communicators, "it needs its victim to feel like theres no other choice and it needs to be consentual. The Jagkar may even make the 'ceremony' public" He explained. That made Steve grimace even more.
"Sorry, Nat. I can't stay in here. Not with him." I said and left. Nat followed me for some reason.
"Another!" The man said and threw the cup on the floor, only for it to bounce upwards. Everyone looked at Tony when he didn't laugh at that. He would have normally because it was kind of funny. He should have been laughing his head off, but he wasn't. He was just staring down at the cup in front of him, looking at his reflection in the water.
bad shape, she continued to fight.
"Had accident..." he started to cry some more. Tony usually was pretty good at not peeing himself while he was little. But Steve had scared him by smashing his way through.
"Not happening. But Steve. If it makes you feel better... I'm quitting." I told him. People are so disrespectful when it comes to us prostitutes... Or jiggalos as the males are supposed to be called. First I got double penetrated by some morons- against my rules. Then that happened. What made it worse is the guy knew I got double penetrated. They must have been working together.
"Dick head!" I said. He pulled up and carried me into his home.
I can honestly say it was pleasant. I would love it if he stayed my client, or if I just kept doing with him casually.
"No. It's late. You'll be up all night." Tony sat down and pulled out a book "I can read to you."
I stood next to Tony and watched him work. Even when I was stood almost touching him, he still didn't realise that I was there. He took off the mask and moved onto something else. He looked so content and happy.  It seemed almost cruel to interrupt him, but I had to do it.
"Everything is fine." Tony said.
"I need help. I have an unconcious Hulk crushing me!"
"I'm positive." He said. He closed his eyes. "I don't know what to do Steve."
"I love it. I wanna call it... What should I call it Patrick?" He asked with a smile. The small boy scrunched his face up and then energetically said:
"I'm here. I'm with Romanoff." He said.
Tony looked him up and down. All there was, was a load of tentacles. Tentacles slivered over Tony's body, rubbing on each sensitive part of it. Three over his penis and balls. Some little ones wriggling over his nipples. They were rubbing his legs, and stomach. His face had turned red. As much as he hated this, it felt good. He grew hard really quickly. He had never had every sensitive part of him touched at the same time before.
The male leaned over to Tony and placed a soft kiss on his head.
I never knew what had happened between Steve and Tony, and frankly I didn't care. They were both my friends. I just wanted them to be okay and right now, Tony wasn't. I didn't know the guy well, but that didn't stop me from helping him.
Tony was sat at his desk, scuffing down a 14 inch cheese pizza and drinking a milkshake. Natasha looked at him and couldn't help but feel sympathy for him. He looked unwell, but he also kind of looked happy. And if he agreed to getting rid of the eggs, then he wouldn't be happy any more.
"Tony, how many fingers am I holding up?" He asked. He had up 2 fingers. Tony, however, was seeing double.
“We’ll finish cleaning up and do it after the bath,” Steve murmured but made no move to grab the soap or shampoo sitting in the corners.
Natasha’s eyes fell on him and she studied him for a moment before saying, “They want their Captain back and the world’s only perfect super soldier to be under their control and out of enemy hands.”
“What about the future?” Jarvis asked.
“I promise,” Steve whispered and he pressed another kiss onto Tony’s mouth. Tony’s arms snapped around him in an immediate embrace which Steve leaned into. He tried to pour every ounce of his love into that kiss and Tony replied similarly.
It opened up to the back of the frame and he turned it over. The paper slipped from his fingers and floated down without his notice as he stared at the revealed image.
He couldn’t lose that –
to ask is, who will top?”
He crushed on Spider-man for years but who wouldn’t? He was the ideal superhero, fighting for the common good, not for the government, or a team, or money, or selfish reasons. Despite everything he’d been through, he was still good and pure and…and
“Jarvis subject at twelve o’clock is not a target. Do not engage,” Tony commanded, his voice laced with fear. His hand hovered over his ear where his earpiece was supposed to be but it was gone, probably lost in his struggle with Kilian.
It didn’t tick, it didn’t display time, it just sat there...biding its time.
He left her with a puzzled expression crossing her features.
They couldn’t mess this up.
“Are you really in a stable relationship right now or was it all a ploy?”
“2009?” Steve gasped. That was the year Tony traveled from.
Steve dropped the device and hissed, “I just heard – that’s a real – that’s a phone!?”
“I know where he’d hide in Brooklyn,” Bucky countered stubbornly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know how I would ever repay you,” Steve said. Peter tugged at his collar and Steve mutely followed his reach to a cage of lemurs. Tony kept in step with him.
He didn’t tell Cable. He knew the stoic man would not approve. It was risky and stupid, but Steve had to do this at least. He could not go near the love of his life, but he could make sure he was safe.
Peter snorted at the absurd definition but Wade sat up in his cocoon of blankets and gasped in wonder, “What does
“Yes, Sir. I have just alerted all of them of the situation.”
Steve leaned into his hand and picked at his food as Tony changed the subject about the papers around him. Tony explained his designs and managed to whisper flirtations or innuendos under his breath at the same time like it was nothing. Tony made this secret fling feel…normal.
“Did you not just see the interaction between them?” Tony gasped.
Bucky’s glare narrowed more.
. Has he already hurt himself to get this solution? And I want all his lab reports… and I want to know every move he makes, and—.”
Steve and Pepper’s eyes met. Her anguish was clear in her gaze and he wasn’t sure what she saw in his, but a strange feeling of mutual understanding passed between them. Neither wanted Tony to die but Stane had to be stopped.
Bucky smirked and replied, “And it seems you learned a little.”
Thanks for reading! <3
Peter wasn’t home until a little past 12:30.
"No!" Steve gasped, finally breaking his eyes from Tony to look at Coulson.
When Tony woke, he woke with a clearer mind that was quick to examine the events that transpired before he fell asleep. The effects of the alcohol in his system were mostly gone and the slight headache it left him with could be cured with some aspirin.
“Look at me.”
They were not rambunctious the entire way. The ride back to the American camp took a few hours and the loud voices calmed down to whispers as a few of the scientists fell asleep.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and he assured her, “I’ve only changed for the better. With the Avengers, I am saving the world and helping people more often than I used to with charities. It’s what Peter aspires to do too.”
James slept on the couch. Natasha did not ask him to but she also did not ask him to return to the bedroom.
It was wrapped in brown paper and he didn’t start opening it until he reached the elevator.
I will fudge with the timeline in regards to Peter’s age because I am a sucker for the super family troupe but otherwise this means we're getting into Endgame territory too. I doubt there is no one reading this who hasn't seen Endgame yet...but if there is a rare bird out there reading this...there's an Endgame spoiler in the very last section of the chapter! Consider this your warning. :)
He bent down and kissed Steve chastely. He pulled back and Steve grasped the back of his neck to stop him from pulling away further.
Steve couldn’t help but shout and went to catch him, but Tony caught himself on one of the window frames.
have slipped away!
"Please don't call me that," he whispered, glancing guilty at Stark.
in fact.”
Steve’s beautiful blue eyes parted and Tony could literally feel the strength of their bond and love in his gaze. They might not be physically one for long but their love always connected them.
He leapt from where he lay and ignored the way the burns he received from Iron Man’s repulsors pulled painfully at his skin. He got his hands around her throat and choked her.
As they navigated the building, Peter expected the cheesy pickup lines to start up again but Wade asked him about his internship and Peter dived into describing the experiment he and Eddie were working on.
and for them to stay in bed the rest of the day, letting Peter get the sleep he craved. Wade was happy to just lay there and watch Peter slumber.
"Don't. This is all my fault. I can't believe I let you know where it was." I spat. He looked hurt. I went to pick up my robot. "You're not my friend. You don't care about me. If you did- why did you show him where it was?"
Steve rushed inside and got Natasha to call for a doctor, he dragged Bruce outside to check Tony over briefly.
"Am I bad?" He asked.
"I'm a monster" he said to Steve. Steve shook his head.
"Yes. Usually he just sends me to bed early but because I got into a fight yesterday, skipped classes, was late home and then let you in the house- I got punished." He put the sunglasses back on. This was my fault? A parent should never hit a child like that- no matter what the crime.
"I know... Sorry. Did we actually kill that creature Steve? It makes me worry." Nat sat down on the bed and just pulled out his wallet from his bed.
"Can you leave this room?"
"So what do the numbers mean?" I asked, dumbly. She shook her head and laughed.
"So it'll have sex with one of them in public." Nat said.
Mother had cooked us a beautiful meal, and like always, dad complained about it. I don't see why mom chose to marry him but she did. Afterwards I was forced to go to the club. I wouldn't talk to him all the way there and while we were there one of dad's friends tried to include me in the conversation about why gays should die. I hated it. So when I got chance - I ran away.
"Yes you'll do" it smiled. "Though your friends are nice too."
The guy touched Tony. He started to take control and did everything he wanted. He held the knife in his hand.
The day had started like any other day. Tony woke up with his head on his lab desk. His head was hurting from the amount of alcohol he had consumed the night before. It was too much. It was always too much. But it was the only way he could get himself to sleep these days. It stopped the night terrors which invaded his mind every night.
Bruce's lips passed down Tony's jaw and neck, and Tony started to get
"Shouldn't you get going? Won't your parents be mad?"
"I guess so."
Only today was different. When Hulk went chasing Clint the power cut out. Everything went dark and the lifts stopped working in the building, which meant poor Steve was stuck in them.
"Thank you." Tony said. "Why did you stay?"
Hulk dragged Pax's body out of the building and chuckled.
looked shocked. "I don't get it. It was like one minute I was invisible to them, the next they all want to love me."
"I-I. Yes." He was bright red.
"Can I see your shoulder?" he asked. He wasn't going to give her chance to talk about the eggs. He'd already been asked to get rid of them by Steve, by Fury, by Clint, by Bruce, by Thor (because he came back to Earth). He wasn't ready to hear it from Natasha because she was probably the only one who could convince him to get rid of them, and he knew that.
"Bad." Steve said. He sighed. "Fury said we need to get the eggs out of Tony before they hatch. I've tried to convince him to go through the surgery but he snaps every time I tell him."
"Way to go dark, Steve." I laughed, trying to hide my emotions. I actually felt embarrassed right now. Upset and embarrassed. I felt vulnerable, like I had just walked into the street wearing no clothes. Exposed.
"I'll wait with you." Steve said. "So you're not alone." That was... Nice of him.
"Okay. First. Are you alright?" I repeated my first question.  He answered all the questions eventually.
. That's usually what set Tony off, and this was in front of the board of directive and mr perfect- aka Steve. Tony tried his hardest to control his breathing, but when he couldn't he rushed out of the room.
There was more water inside the door, but it was clean. It looked like it was being filtered.  She looked around. Everything was black for a while and then she slipped. Natasha fell through a hole and landed with a splash in a river. It was a river under water.  She swam along it, and was able to see the magnificent white building.
Tony was
It pulled it's tongue out of his mouth. Tony took in a deep breath.
Nat could guess how he got that mark, but no one else was in the room where it happened, so she could only guess.
I did as I was told. It started to foam. I got it then. It was very satisfying. It surprisingly calmed me down.
"Hey, what have you got there?" He asked. Tony trusted Steve. He showed him. Tony's face lit up. His eyes were sparkling and he had a smile that ranged from ear to ear. He looked like an innocent child. "Is that one of....?" Steve's question trailed off when he saw Romanoff come out of the kitchen going after Tony.
“My second is named Jormungand, he is also known as the Midguard Serpent. He is a large snake that was banished to the waters here, much like you were I suppose. The prophecies speak of him killing Thor, so Odin sent him here. It is strange to be so close to him now.” Loki took a breath and continued. “I spent the shortest amount of time with him, but I remember that he loved to curl around my shoulders like a scarf. He is now able to wrap himself around your world and bite his own tail, but at the time he was no longer than my arm.”
Steve walked them into the bathroom where Jarvis had started the shower already. The water was the perfect temperature as Steve set him down under the spray. He tilted his head back to get his hair wet, Steve chose this moment to darken the bruises he had left last night on Tony’s neck and collar. Tony was pushed under the spray fully and Steve followed him trailing kisses to his mouth where he playfully nipped at Tony’s lip and deepened the kiss licking into the wet cavern of Tony’s mouth. Suddenly Tony was no longer warm from the constant water showering on them the sounds of water falling was muted and sounded far away, he reluctantly broke the kiss and looked around. Steve’s wings had encircled him again and was acting as an umbrella for him, keeping the water off of him. Steve’s face was red in embarrassment.
Steve looked flushed and his eyes were blown, sweat glistened on his forehead and he was breathing heavy. “Are you ok?” Tony reached his hand up and placed it on Steve’s head, “you are burning up and you don’t look so good, Steve?”
“Let's wait until next time when everyone is settled down and then we can research how and why these things do what they do,” Bruce looked down at his feet sheepishly and nodded to Tony.
“Have you come to take up my offer finally?” Rogers smirks and stands; he is a lot taller than Tony is. Tony watches his muscles ripple as he sets down his book and saunters over to crowd Tony against the wall with his bulk. Tony is reminded of their first meeting when Rogers sauntered up to him in the suit, seemingly obvious to the repulsor pointed at his chest and offered to Tony one of the things he had fantasized about since he was a horny teenager at M.I.T fucking his way through half the campus.
Steve huffed out a breath and dropped her pants and the boxers that she hadn’t changed out of since the change. “well, here we go”
“Also it feels really... good to me so I sometimes make... noises...” Steve was so red Tony wouldn’t be surprised if his wings turned red. “just ignore me if that happens, Bruce says it’s just a reaction because mates usually do this to each other... so yeah.”
What,The Fuck.
it is currently -33 degrees outside so i have some extra time to work on this story while i am off of school. there will likely be another update soon. please enjoy!
so, this chapter was a way to show Steve and Bucky's relationship before the whole ice and Hydra and wing stuff, this chapter sits as a flashback and to show the general rolls of Steve in their relationship and how he may have issues with his urges now that they have changed. hopefully this will shed some light on how Steve feels.
But why would Steve be getting checked up by Bruce now? Was he hurt? Was the serum failing?
The only thing that was wrong was that Bucky seemed to dislike Steve, anytime he would come in the room Bucky would get tense and hide behind Tony like a little kid does behind his mom's skirt. Tony could tell the toll it was taking on Steve, they had talked a lot since Bucky had arrived but, they hadn’t included Bucky in any of those conversations.
There was a ruffle of movement behind him and that meant that Steve was regaining conscience. Bucky stalked over to the couch and sat at his friends feet as he woke up.
“Avengers, suit up and meet at the avenjet in 5 minutes.” the whole team split off their separate ways. Tony went over to the wall and typed a code to call the armor, Steve vaulted himself down the stairs to grab his shield and suit, Clint disappeared into the vent and Natasha just up and disappeared. That left Bruce and Thor. Thor was always prepared for battle so he called Mjolnir and held an arm out to Bruce.
“I need ya too,” Bucky quickly jerked away and all but ripped his clothes off. “How do you want me?” Steve turns an impressive shade of red given the amount of blood that is in other places at the moment.
“Jarvis did you get a virus from Clint’s porn again?”
“I'm in. No one so far, but I’m guessing there will be soon.” Steve whispered back as he slowly walked down the hall, Shield in his hand ready to go. The first corner had guards posted around a door, they were talking about some party where apparently Jerry had got drunk and drove his car into a pool. Steve rolled his eyes and slipped by without their knowing. He made it to the control room where all the camera feeds were shown on screens, he took out the guard with a hit to the back of the head and started searching the feeds for Tony.
“Tony, I think Steve needs his wings groomed. It has been a while and Stevie needs to relax a little.” Bucky and Tony shared a grin and then Tony dashed off into the bathroom to get a dish of warm water and some fluffy towels.
“Steven? Rogers? Come on wonder twins, I got an alert from Jarvis.” Tony made his way to the kitchen, but didn’t see Steve, he must be behind the island, Tony circled the counter and found Steven breathing heavy on the floor, his eyes were wet and his face was red. Tony fell to his knees and started looking over Steven for what happened. Steven pushed Tony’s hands away and wiped his arm across his face to rid it of the moisture.
They had all decided to continue the conversation on the common floor and off of the roof of the tower, it was a rather awkward elevator ride nonetheless, but once everyone took their spots in the common area they began to settle. Clint and Peter were sitting on the love seat to the side, Bruce was in his armchair, Steve, Bucky, and Tony were on the couch and Thor was standing as well as Loki. Thor looked around and sat Mjolnir on the carpet next to a stray bean bag left out from Clint’s gaming and he plopped down. Loki rolled his eyes and magicked a golden chair for himself and sat.
It had been a week since Steve had broken down in the lab, he felt better and now, with the harness he could leave his apartment but still couldn’t train or even wear his suit. SHIELD was starting to get mad that Captain America hadn’t been fighting in almost a month.
Tony woke up in the large empty room that he had passed out in but he was no longer strapped to the thing and he was alone. Glancing around his eyes caught a blanket in the corner and in the other was a toilet and a sink, he sat up and instantly regretted it.
“If I may, Master Rogers is now awake.” Jarvis interrupted the Russian soaps Nat was watching With his update. She nodded to the camera in the corner and made her way to the elevator which was already waiting to take her to her destination, regardless of what Steve says.
“a fucking”
“Careful, Captain. Such compliments might go to my head.” then he popped out of the room. Leaving the other bracelet in Steve’s hand.
Bucky uses the metal arm to clamp on to Steve’s arm like a vice, Steve cries out in pain and goes down to the floor. He lands awkwardly half on his wing and half on one of Bucky’s. They both grunt out an exclamation at the pain and pull away. There is a silent truce between the both of them because they step back a few feet and investigate their damaged wings to see what was wrong and the extent that they are hurt. A large ‘boom’ makes their heads whip to the door that was thrown open, the noise was caused from the door hitting against the metal of the hall that leads to the stairway into the tower, in the doorway stands Tony with a contraption in his arms that looks like a gun but it clearly doesn’t shoot bullets, behind him in the shadow of the tower stairs Bruce watching them carefully. Steve hesitates at the sight of Tony, Bucky does not. The sound of gravel crunching underfoot is the only warning he had before he is being tackled to the ground, this time Steve flipped them midair and ended with his knees pinning Bucky’s wings and his arms pinning his, Bucky struggled under him but, Steve kept his held. There was a sharp pain that shot into his back, he reached around and pulled a tranq dart out of himself, when he felt Bucky go limp under him, he looked and saw an identical dart sticking out of his chest.
“sir, I am picking up life signs... but they are faint.”
"Call."
“There is something that didn’t shift with the rest of you,” Loki had saddled up next to where Steve was standing and was speaking low enough that the others couldn’t hear what he was saying, a bolt of fear went through Steve's gut at the implication that something was wrong but he appreciated the discretion that Loki was taking. “I wouldn't want to worry your lovers, and Seeing as you appear to be fine I will allow you to go but come to my quarters at your earliest convenience so I can figure out what happened.” Steve nodded to Loki and glanced back at Bucky and Tony, without turning his head to look at Loki he spoke to the god.
He quickly checked the route to the cell and found it had about 15 HYDRA agents that he would run into in the way, not counting the ones that would come once the heard what was happening. He put a bullet in the guard for the cameras head and left the room, sprinting down the corridors to Tony’s cell.
Not soon enough, from Bucky’s perspective, Steve brought his slick fingers to Bucky’s hole, he circled it a few times before he began to put pressure, all the while he continued trailing his kisses all over Bucky’s body.
“That's playing dirty! Steve help me here, that's not allowed!” Bucky sounded just like he did when he would go running to his mother because Becca had cheated at their game.
“who said that I was helping you?” Steve looked at Bucky as Loki grabbed his shoulder again and took them back to New York, he could swear that he saw a glimpse of recognition in Bucky’s eyes, he watched as Bucky dropped his stiff posture and a pair of beautiful obsidian wings unfurled from behind him before Steve’s vision was clouded with the searing green of magic, and he had to close his eyes.
Steve straightened himself and so did Bucky who was standing to his left. they were in sync, just like they were back in the war. A common goal finally got them on the same wavelength.
“I mean, finish what we started yesterday.” Tony's eyes had that hopeful glint to them, Steve melted.
“I don’t know Tony,” Steve ran a hand anxiously through his hair. “How about I make an announcement before movie night tomorrow?”
He tried to imagine what to do, he would have to leave the team and the tower. He could hide his wings better now with the improved harness, but even in a disguise he would start to show. He could pass it off as him being fat but there would be a point where that just didn’t fit. (he didn’t even know what other changes might happen with his ‘unique physiology’)
A pang of sadness and familiarity was in Loki’s chest. He remembered holding Sleipnir before Odin took him. Loki shook that thought from his mind, he should be focused on Steve right now. He looked down and found that Steve was looking up at him, his eyes, pink from crying, but that crystal blue shone into his soul.
“We can give him stuff for the physical wounds and have him stitched up, but what we can’t do is magic, whatever they injected him with has changed his biology, from what I can tell it is unstable in the body Without the serum to counteract it. If we are going to save Tony we need someone like Strange to help, science can only take him so far.” Bruce paced and ran his hand through his hair as he told the team that he couldn’t do anything else to help Tony. The other guy was restless and Bruce could feel his shifting, just under the surface, but not yet braking the water.
“No, I think it is most likely a way for them to break you mentally, to change their subjects' body so they no longer feel themselves. If one is fighting their own mind it is much easier for that same mind to be broken,” Loki gave a shiver and continued as if nothing happened. “They wanted you to become theirs, and if they got some genius rug rats in the process, well, it would continue the line.”
Tony had been sitting there for 3 hours. He had gotten up and waited for Steve to come up from his daily run, but the soldier was nowhere to be found
“N-no, no one's ever touched me with good intentions on the reactor before, it’s hideous.” Tony turned his face away from Steve’s eyes, those clear blue pools could see directly into his soul. Steve’s hand held onto the back of his neck and he leaned over to kiss away the tears on his face.
this is my first time writing so please be kind and enjoy!
Steve doesn't even flinch as he pulls back the tape and gauze from his neck and inspects the wound, Interesting, it is scared over just like Tony’s, normally the next morning after a wound like that there wouldn’t be a mark left, Bucky hummed low in his chest and he knew that Steve heard him but he had apparently decided to be mute so he said nothing. Bucky continued to wipe away at the area and then dab it dry with new gauze before he got up.
He flushed and rubbed at the nape of his neck with his right hand and his right wing raised as well, she grinned at him. “it, um holds them so I don’t rip my shirts like when I showed you guys.” his flush deepens remembering that particular day.
“I don’t think we can reverse engineer the ray guns, Tony.” Bruce told him for the 50th time. “It will probably wear off in a week or so, Hydra isn't exactly known for being the most reliable in building tech, and coupled with the serum Steve should be fine.” Tony looked up a Bruce, he had a hand on his shoulder, Steve fast asleep on a small cushion in his other hand.
"it's called molting Steve, when a bird or in your case someone with wings loses their feathers to make place for new ones to grow in." Bruce stares some more. "Can I examine them?" Steve shudders, but then asks where Bruce would like him and sits on a stool he pulls over.
Steve tried to get through to Tony, who could hear the screaming from Patrick anyway. He ran out to him.
Tony got treated, but Patrick just felt guilty. He was currently hating on himself. He hated what he was and what he had just done.
"I didn't go. Went to the garage instead." I said.
Nat had finished eating her breakfast and headed back to her room when the building started to creak. She heard it and rushed to Tony's lab.
When he came back he was greeted by some warm milk and a bedtime story that made him feel very sleepy. Tony sipped on the milk contently, but didn't finish the bottle before his little brown eyes had shut and he'd fallen asleep. Steve took the bottle out of his mouth and passed his pacifier past his lips before laying him in bed and wrapping the blankets around him.
Steve was the one who noticed him going quiet.
"Ahaha! You have forfeitted the battle!" Thor yelled triumphantly.
"Its okay, Tony. Its over. They are gone." He said. Tony pushed Bruce away.
Most of the bullets were being blocked by tentacles. Well, they were blocking Pax but as each tentacle got shot, it exploded and grew back.
"Well some of us '
Steve looked at him as Tony charged straight into his stomach and wrapped his arms around him. He wrapped an arm around him and stroked his hair with the other.
Steve looked
"When I came out as gay to my father... It didn't end well. It ended with 4 broken ribs and a black eye. But we don't need to discuss that."
"It's okay, calm down." He said. Patrick looked at Steve.
Clint decided he was going to sit next to me in class.
A head came out first. It looked like a babies head, only much smaller. Then its little arms came out. It pulled itself out of the ping pong ball egg and laid on the bottom of the incubator. The creature looked like a mermaid, only with a tentacle instead of a tail. It was adorable. Steve found it amusing how so much creature could fit in a tiny egg, because to be honest it was pretty long. It filled the incubator.
"They aren't using you, Tony." Bruce wrapped his arms around the panicking man.
The guy stabbed the knife into Tony's arm, and started to cut down it. The noise was horrifying. A blood curdling scream.
"That boy isn't with you again is he?" She asked. I shook my head and she hugged me. Her hands stroked my head and back as she held me.
The kitchen was mostly quiet, apart from the eating competition which Thor was having with Hulk. They were seeing who could eat the most food in 10 minutes, when Hulk suddenly stopped and sniffed up.
"Patrick. Me and Tony aren't together." Patrick now looked confused. His little brown eyebrows were furrowed.
"My children."
enlightning. Tony stood up. He wanted to
"Are you ready to have sex?" Pax asked.
"It isn't a disgusting creature, its my child!" Tony cried out to stop her. He put his head into Steve's back and hid the egg behind him too.
"This place is huge. You must be rich." Steve laughed. "Oh... That's Howard Stark." He looked at a photo of my dad.
"Because, Tony... I am going to make you feel better." Bruce smiled.
Tony looked happy. This was his child. After a few days more, it had grown too big for the incubator. The warmth had allowed it to grow. And now, it was also starting to look a bit like Tony. It had grown legs. In all honesty, it now looked like a child with a tentical tail. Tony loved it either way. To him, this was his little man. His child.
I dunno who to put next- so sorry if you're waiting a while for the next chapter
"You can control it, Patrick. They are part of you, you're not part of them." Steve said, trying to calm him down. The tentacles wrapped around Steve's waist and lifted him in the air. Patrick's eyes were turning red.
"Something is off!" Hulk stood up and looked through the door. "Smell fishy."
Something about Steve. I was starting to really appreciate him. My heart pound in my chest when he is near me. Its unnerving, but I love it. I haven't felt this way about anyone in such a long time.
"No, daddy." Tony said quietly. His voice sounded shy and he looked like he was about to cry.
Tony looked at them through teary eyes. He gasped as Natasha crushed them in her hands.
"That worries me." He closed his eyes. He sat on the bed with her. "That really worries me."
"Tony." They both said in sync.
I got suggested to do Clint next, so I did Clint. I hope you enjoy :) This one is a little sexual
Patrick looked at what was happening with a mixture of guilt and curioistity.
Clint was the one who noticed the green showing up on Bruce. He rushed towards Nat and grabbed her, running as quick as he could out of the building.
"Oh. She was nice. Not really my type though." I scratched my head. He then grabbed me by my collar and pinned me to the wall. He didn't scare me. He wasn't that strong.
"Don't know." The building creaked again. Hulk jumped and covered Clint as the building started to fall down on top of them.
"This is one of my eggs." He said and Natasha nodded.
"Tony is getting French kissed by some kind of lizard thing" he was laughing. Bruce nervously laughed too, but Tony didn't seem happy. His eyes had widened when its tongue went it, but it shut as it was forcing its way down his throat, almost suffocating him.
"Then why are you here?" the other male asked. I didn't think it was any of his concern but I answered anyway.
After what felt like an eternity, Clint finally made it to the bottom. Hulk was stood there sniffing and looking around. Clint put his hands on his knees and panted.
"Sleep tight, baby." He said and kissed his head.
They made their way over to the sewer where Nat had watched Tony get dragged down into.
"I not mean to, daddy!" He yelled and clung onto Steve, crying his eyes out. "Please no puniment. I no mean to!" Steve stroked the littles hair and picked him up.
"Well... Thank you" I said to Steve. He was busy looking around.
Steve undressed the male and set him in the bath. He had come to realise that Tony really enjoyed being sat in the bath while the water poured in. He found it interesting how the tub filled up. The male was sat crossed legged in the water and splashed it a little bit, but the running tap made him think of the water in the kettle and he remembered why he needed the bath. He looked away from Steve.
So we were in this garage because this is his. He used to work here when he was younger and the owner had to close up shop. So Tony got the place given to him. He goes to this garage to work on stuff in order to think.
"Wash" it said harshly. Clint had no choice but to clean himself up.
They ran. Oh how they ran. They needed to be there quickly. They had to stop Tony. For all they knew, it could have been Clint they had to stop, but they were 90% sure it would be Tony.
Clint followed Tony, but he kept his distance. The guy absolutely stunk. He was plugging his nose the entire way there. The place they arrived at was not something they expected. After walking for 3 miles through the sewers they arrived to something which was under water. It was a glass dome to keep the water out and had oxygen tanks all over the place. There was a white building in it and it was spotless. A small, controlled stream ran in front of them with no bridge across.
"Hey, Tony. How old are you?" He asked, sitting next to him (avoiding the small puddle).
"Busy doing what?" He asked. He couldn't see Tony through the glass. Normally, if Tony was working, he'd see him above the desk. But right now, Tony was out of view.
"What? What happened?" He asked. He looked around, though he couldn't really see anything. The light was too dark, then out the corner of his eye he saw a light. Something was swimming in the water towards them and it didn't look friendly.
"No thanks I-"
I went inside to see him working away. Welding mask down. Focus on whatever the metal thing in front of him was. He looked like he hadn't even realised that I had entered.
"It's a plastic table." Was Natasha's response. They couldn't sit on the seat. The only one who got to sit on a seat was Tony's teddy bear. Which Thor was getting jealous off and Clint wanted badly to shoot with an arrow. Tony came through with a small blue plastic kettle and some pink plastic cups. He handed everyone the cup and one by one they thanked him. Steve chuckled as Tony was acting proffessional- even if he was only 3 in the head.
"It's nothing" Tony said. Steve wasn't buying that. But he didn't really know what to do. He just thought that Tony needed affection and so kissed him. He pulled him close and kissed him. Surprisingly, Tony didn't push him off. Instead, he kissed back. That means it worked and that meant that Steve had come up with a plan.
After New York Tony spent less time with everyone. Less time sleeping. And more time alone in his lab being small. And after Ultron, he spent even more time as a little. He probably spent 10 hours a day little.
"It's trying to escape!" It squawked. The creature launched itself at Tony, making Tony have to jump down from the top of the ladders very quicky. He fell straight into the sewage and so, luckily, wasn't injured. However, he did now have a look of disgust on his face.
Tony was the first to enter the water because he was the most covered. He stayed in the water a while, then put head under. He wasn't 100% clean when he got out, but he was good enough for the creature to be satisfied. Clint just walked through the water and the creature pushed him backwards back into the water.
"Letting me cheer you up."
Steve looked around in his room. He had lost his wallet. Panic struck the males face as he couldn't find it.
"What do you mean?" I asked, standing up.
Romanoff got nervous when Patrick was born. She was even more nervous when he grew legs and started to run around the compound like an actual child, but Tony reassured her that it was okay. He knew Patrick couldn't do any harm. He watched as the young
"The only thing we have on the system is a creature called the Jagkar" He said. "They are creatures which alter their looks but basically their original form is a huge green and blue tentacle monster. Looks kind of like a squid. They can turn invisible, which is what you saw. And can look like a woman with a tail. They hang out in sewers and swamps and places like that. They are increidbly strong, but if you had a Hulk, then he would probably beat it. Whatever you do, don't let it have what it wants. That will only make it stronger."
"Don't interrupt me-"
was a bad idea in a place like this.
"I'm bisexual and I worked hard to get where I am. I used to get bullied a lot."
"Okay... I'll go see one of your friends instead then. I bet they taste better than you anyway." It started to go away. Tony thought for a while. This creature was a monster and had tentacles. Now, he'd seen enough hentai to know that tentacles + humans do not mix very well. He didn't want to be the reason for his
love was coming out of this heated session.
Back to Tony's Point of view
"Okay Clint, leave him alone now." A male said. I turned my head to him. He was like a God. His hair was like gold. His eyes were like the ocean. And don't get me started on his muscles. I knew I probably shouldn't get mixed up with him. He probably had tonnes of ladies lining up ready to date him. He had to be a popular lad.
"He's never been away for so long." she said. "I hope he's okay."
"I don't have my licence. I just thought I would drive here so I didn't have to wait for my Dad again. The man is brutal." Tony said. I bit my lip. He was driving the car illegally. I suppose it is okay if it is just too and from school, but still- he should get his licence.
"Over what." Steve had heard him. Of course Steve had heard him.
"Everything okay, little one?" He asked, putting his hand behind Tony's head and stroking his hair soothingly. Tony nodded. He didn't want his daddy to know about his mistake. He looked over at Thor, who downed his cup of 'tea'- well water- and smiled happily.
Tony went for a bath after his coffee, in hopes that he could calm down. It was a promise he made to Steve. If he was stressed or upset, then he would try to get rid of the negative feelings in a nice, hot bath before going to his lab. Going to the lab meant that Tony would not eat or sleep for a few days. He'd zone out and would drink only coffee and alcohol. It was not healthy for him.
"Tony. What happened?" Steve asked aned sat next to him. He checked him over for injures.
So I just lay back and take it. Some people have different tastes. Some like me on top, some like me on bottom, some like me to be tied up against the wall. Whatever it is. I just take it. As long as the money comes in.
"We were trying to perserve it. By orders of Shield." Natasha answered. So this was a Jagkar egg. Tony held it in his hand.
"Steve?" I asked.
"I noticed your arms are scarred" he looked at me with eyes that were worried. I started to cover up my arms.
"Hey. That girl of yours doing okay?" He asked. I didn't want to speak to him. "Are you ignoring me? Hey you okay? How'd you get that bruise on your face?" He was throwing questions at me. I was getting annoyed.
Pax was now bleeding, and Clint took advantage of it- shooting more arrows at him quickly. Each one going through tentacles and landing exactly where he wanted them to hit.
Nat was quickly rushed to the medical room, as was Tony. Tony was whimpering and crying. Natasha just sat suffering in silence. She always suffered in silence.
Tony picked Patrick up and carried him to his bedroom.
Steve's Point of view
"How do they make them so small?" He asked.
"You are. You and daddy are my daddys." He meant him and Tony. Steve smiled softly, a light blush crossing his cheeks.
"Well Steve came and pulled me out of my zone." I laughed and scratched my head. "He's a good man."
"Where's Tony? Is he not included in this team meeting?" Clint asked, annoyed that the billionaire got to sleep or stay in the lab while he got woken up. He was close to going to wake up the sleeping man when Steve stopped him.
Back to Tony's Point of view
The thing stood up. It had long black hair and looked like a woman, though it probably wasn't.
"4 broken ribs?" I asked "So the black eye you have now isn't just a one off?"
The blond male came over to me. He took my hand and then checked me over for injuries. I stayed quiet.
looked straight at Bruce's eyes. It was the only way he
I rushed out of the room. This was stupid. I just couldn't. The classroom was awful. The corridors were awful. I found myself just sitting outside on a bench. But that didn't help when the bell rang for break.
"No." I whispered. I had a feeling I was going to get into trouble for being late home, even though it was dad's fault not mine.
Tony cried as she continued. Bruce came in at that point. He was panting as he had ran from the other side of the compound. It was a large compound. He looked at them.
He looked around to see a sleeping Steve near him. Tony shook Steve awake and looked at him.
"Thats $350" I said.
Luckily the coms were still working. By habit, Steve had put one in on his way out. It was he was always on call.
"I'm fine." Tony told him
Nat checked Steve's foot. It had a burn on it which was bleeding. It looked nasty, but she had to do it. She had to get the thing off him.
Pax grabbed Tony's hair and forced him to look up at him. His tentacle rubbed against his face and then slid around his neck, choking him slightly. More tentacles wrapped themselves around Tony's various body parts. He was completely at Pax's mercy now.
"Bucky wanted me to lose my virginity. So what is this like? I can't imagine it's very pleasant for you."
"No, you're in my house, under observations." He said
"P-Pax" Tony said. The creature slipped in. It looked him up and down. Tony was in shock, he thought that Pax was dead. The creature pushed him, making him go flying and then started to move very quickly in the direction of Patrick. "PATRICK!" Tony yelled.
Steve's reaction was to look after Tony. This egg meant a lot to the man and so Steve was not going to let it be taken away from him.
"Friday, call Pepper." Steve said. Suddenly Tony didn't want to be near Steve. He was going to make him talk to Pepper. Pepper hated him, she was nasty to him over what happened in their relationship. And it's not like he even did anything wrong. He didn't cheat on her or anything like that. Honestly, she left because he was having nightmares and waking her up every night. It was making her grouchy and snappy. And eventually, neither of them could take it anymore and they had a fight. Years of dating went down the toilet because Tony has nightmares. Luckily for Tony, Steve took him in and fixed him up. That's how he ended up dating the super soldier.
"This isn't a joke, Tony."
"I thought I was over that." He mumbled, hoping Steve didn't hear him. The pair had gone into the kitchen to get some much needed coffee.
" No buts." He said and went to the dining table.
"Tony, is everything okay?" He asked. Tony
"You happy now?" He asked, coldly.
"I never really thought about that. I just know I like you as a person. But you're the straight pretty boy that everyone likes at school and I-"
"I don't know him well." I said. My eyes shut. "I don't wish to talk about it."
"Perhaps I do. Do you have a thing for me?"
"Yeah no S***. Ive never been able to look after myself, thats why I had Pepper and Happy employed to begin with."
They got everyone back quickly. Pax was taken into custody of shield and was going to be experimented on. They did not need to worry about him any more.
"Sorry. Did I wake you?" Tony was trying to change the conversation, but Steve wasn't having that. He put his hands on his shoulders.
"Really? Because you looked like you were about to get a beating."
"Yes please!" His eyes sparkled. He wanted to see Tony, just to apologise a million times and to make sure he was okay. Tony, of course, was okay. But Patrick did't know that yet. He didn't fully understand what had happened.
"What about work?"
"Tony, I- I'm so sorry." Steve put his hand on my shoulder. I slapped it off. Tears burning in my eyes.
"Super soldier" He laughed. She even let off a bit of a giggle before helping him up. His serum and quicker healing had kicked in so he was around 90% alright now. He could walk, it was with a bit of a limp, but it was still a walk.
I will get drunk. And I will try to kill mtself.
"I'm not-" he lifted me up over his shoulder. "What are you doing?" I wriggled, trying to make it difficult for him to carry me. He held on tight, eventually my arms and legs got tired and I surrendered.
"Tony. I'm sorry I didn't know."
"I didn't say it was." I wanted this conversation to end, but Steve took it a step further. He took hold of my arm and pulled my sleeve up to look at it. I looked down in shame.
"I'm fine." His voice was shakey.
The tower was still destroyed, so they went to the compound.
"Tony, tell me what's on your mind." Bruce said. He looked
"It happens okay. Tony has been through a lot. He's strong, he can handle a bit of a headache." Patrick burried his head into Steve's neck.
"I don't know. the lift broke down. The numbers aren't on the little screen. I'm going to see if I can get the door open."
"Hey. How you doing?" The solider asked as he sat down next to the billionaire.
"You don't have to bottle it up. I understand you know." He said and sat on Tony's bed near him. Tony didn't really respond to that. He was trying to bottle it up but his bottle was full so kept over flowing and it had holes in. He wasn't able to hold it in; he started to cry again.
Natasha had Patrick wrapped around her. She sat with him and watched cartoons and funny videos with him for a while, until Steve walked into the room. He had a red mark on his neck.
"You're still here? Been at a club?" Steve asked. He invited himself to sit next to him.
"I'll go sit with him." I said.
"You ruined my wall!" He charged at Hulk. He made a fist out of tentacles and punched at Hulk. Hulk's fist and Pax's fist joined together, making a blast. The blast knocked both beings back and shattered all the windows on this floor of the building. Pax looked around. He hissed and got ready to fight again, but Hulk's fist was straight in his face.
Steve gulped back his nauseous revulsion at the thought and took a deep, steadying breath to calm his already frayed nerves.
“…Good.” Peter closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. He tried to make himself calm down but his heart continued to race. Originally, it was because of his fear of the attack, now, it was because of his apprehension of meeting his mother.
“H-He’s p-p-pl-laying catch up,” Wade assured him but his haggard voice drew Peter’s worried eyes back to him.
The inside had totally collapsed from one of the explosions caused by either one of the Iron Men or Kilian’s men. The area where Pepper had been was buried in debris. There was no sign of her or anyone else.
Peter looked around at his collective family confused and he eyed the destruction of the kitchen with concern. Tony adjusted his hold on Peter and he looked up to Tony then looked back to Natasha and asked her, “Why you angry? Did Uncle Bucky do somethin’ bad?”
“…Is that-?”
He stepped into the elevator and pressed the button for the penthouse. The elevator moved quickly and Coulson quietly counted the seconds as they passed it took ten seconds to reach the top, giving him twenty seconds to spare. Plenty of time.
Tony wrapped both of his arms around Steve's neck and warned her, “Five seconds.”
“Indeed,” Tony agreed.
He trimmed Steve’s beard first by putting an intimidating, pointed plastic piece on the end. When Tony approached him with it, Steve asked, “You sure we can’t just use old fashioned scissors?”
She paused by him and said, “Next time I see you Tony will be back and the Mandarin in custody. Till then, Rogers,” she said with a nod, her way of saying goodbye.
Eddie slammed his fists on the table in frustration.
Peter got to him before Steve did and gently placed a hand on his shoulder.
Steve smiled sadly at him and replied in just a hushed voice, “I’m not…”
He knelt down and kissed Tony again. The familiar feeling of their shared kiss acted like a calming balm, flowing through Tony like a gentle current.  Steve's kisses were the best form of pain relief.
“…Sleeping with a man?” She clarified, her shock was so great that her voice revealed her surprise.
Steve pushed himself up to his knees, putting himself a little higher than Tony. But he did not pull away or relinquish his hold on Tony.
[That was was beautiful, you cute curly little bracket.]
“Hey, Steve—,” Tony began, his voice worn with exhaustion and it tore out Steve’s heart all over again. Steve immediately assumed it was an old message he somehow missed but as he listened it became extremely apparent that was not the case.
“The Tower might be another target,” Coulson continued. “So we are going to evacuate it. The Parkers have volunteered to watch your son in the meantime and we will have eyes on them until you get back, if that is fine by you.”
“Not bad,” Peter breathlessly teased, snaking his arms around Wade.
Tony’s skin was a lumpy, continuous bruise that ached in a constant throb with no relief. And breathing alone was near impossible as every time he inhaled it felt like someone was stabbing his side with a pitchfork. His muscles felt like someone pulverized them with a serrated hammer and his bones felt brittle and cracked.
Steve dropped his head and murmured in an even lower voice, “I’m – I’m sorry about confessing to you like that…”
He lost Tony when he went over the cliff but Tony saw him –
In the end, his only option left to him was to use the helpful trait he had absorbed from his host: the boy's intelligence. So Venom dug deep into the boy’s mind and he solely thought for a solution. He turned over the limited options available to him and tried to think of a new way to twist them into his favor.
The AI paused.
“Yes,” Bucky replied. “I think I can.”
Steve blinked and then his eyes grew larger. His hand tightened on Tony’s and his gaze shot to the ring box and then back to Tony. Gravity seemed to overtake Steve and fell to his knees in front of Tony.
His anger abated slightly. He was confused by the flicker of hope in the other man’s gaze and his own misery doubled with Steve’s. Could he be reading him wrong? His confusion was added to the mix and it made an odd blend of emotions that did not settle right within him.
There was only silence.
So it wasn’t really that much of a surprise when, without meaning to, he fell asleep into one of the most deep and content sleeps he ever had.
Steve went over to him and gathered Peter in his arms and held him tightly against his chest. He did not answer him at first. He waited those 2.6 minutes, waiting, hoping Tony would miraculously appear. He counted out every second and his eyes were locked on the screen, searching the damaged remains of the house with the news crews for any sign of Tony. He tried redialing the number but was told the number was disconnected. He tried again, several times, before giving up.
Steve squeezed his arm and murmured, “There has to be a valid explanation. Maybe you designed a new AI for a new home?”
They opened the drain and dried each other off with fluffy towels. Tony ran a towel over Steve’s hair and scoffed, “How did I miss all this hair up here too?? You need a trim, soldier.”
Steve’s numbing shock seemed to leap off him just as Venom had and he smiled so widely at his husband that his cheeks hurt. He bound across the room and lifted Tony into a tight embrace.
Ultimately, he began to have affairs and one-night stands. He ignored the yearning in his heart that wanted him find someone to fill in the empty space there… He pushed the feeling away until it was completely smothered and he started to tell himself, “I don’t need a soulmate.”
“Already got it covered,” Natasha announced, cutting up some fruit and Wanda watched her hands with a grin.
“Jarvis?”
He couldn’t help but bitterly wonder what his father would think of all of this.
The time traveler remained sleeping but his expression was pinched as if he were having a bad dream. Bucky sighed like Steve had but did as Steve wanted and stood at watch, keeping an eye on Tony. Usually, he had the entire horizon when he had watch duty so he felt extremely confined to be focused on just one prone man. He grew bored quickly and felt a little weird staring at Steve’s fella so. His gaze began to shift around the tent and he wondered if Howard willfully choose the design on his ugly suitcases.
"Yeah, well I am amazing." He flashed a smile. "And so's Stark, I guess."
He thought about hitting the stairs instead of the elevator, but the elevator doors were already open and waiting for his arrival. Trusting JARVIS to put on the speed, he got in. The pull of gravity made it clear the elevator was going at full speed, and only a few seconds later he was stepping out.
Steve forced a smile, took a breath, and said, “Kiss for good luck?”
"So, five days, give or take," Steve confirmed. He made sure to meet the eyes of every Avenger. "Any one have anything else to add?"
"I am no magician," Thor rumbled after a few moments. "Magic was Loki's art, and my mother's." He turned to Steve, his eyes solemn, "but I have seen enchanted men in my travels, cast under spells similar to the ones Amora grew known for. The men were her slaves, their minds turned to her bidding. They were not idle. Not like this."
Dr. Parry was much more composed. He crossed to the other side of the bed. "Hello, Mr. Stark," he spoke to Tony as if he could understand him, which few of the specialists bothered to do. "I'm going to examine you. It won't hurt."
"I agree." The elevator slid to a halt, and Natasha grabbed Steve's arm. "But we have a bigger problem. Those neurologists were hired by Bruce -- he's shut himself in his safe room."
Tony had run outside and stopped, an inch from death.
"Funny," Tony said, "he never mentioned you."
"Amora asked me to choose who I loved," Steve repeated.
"She's planning something," Bucky muttered, one morning over eggs and toast. "Whatever she did to Stark, she's not in a holding pattern. Something is coming down the line."
"I'm fine," Steve said quickly. "I should... well, I don't mind being here. Bucky and Clint are still hunting down the Slender Men, Natasha's on the hunt for Amora -- maybe you could help?"
Steve and the rest of the Avengers were sitting in the tower's common room. Doctors Malone and Parry had been shown to temporary guest quarters, while the Avengers, most fresh from their battle, convened in the main living area. It took a few minutes for Steve to bring everyone up to date on what had happened. The reactions had been... mixed.
"Not so far, if one knows how to find the spaces between."
"Sharon and I did go out for coffee. It was nice. She was... nice."
"No," Bruce said quickly. "What you're thinking of is called locked-in syndrome; When someone is fully conscious, but their body is paralyzed. That's simply not the case here -- as far as we can tell, he
"They surrounded him," she said. "And when Amora wanted, one reached in and grabbed..."
Grace was accepting of it, and in some ways looked forward to flying freely—a big eagle body was cumbersome when she couldn’t fly more than a few dozen yards from Steve at a time. But now that the moment was at hand, they both felt nervous.
They sat and they drank.
Again, Parry and Steve exchanged a look.
"No," Perry said quietly, "they wouldn't, would they?"
"No, don't tell me from here!" The man tapped his head, then moved his hand down to press over his own heart. "Tell me from here."
"What are you doing?" Steve asked, because Tony would have done the same if he were... able.
Dr. Malone took one look at Tony and put a hand to her mouth, her eyes filling.
It wasn't another fit. He'd fainted dead away.
Bruce said softly, "Steve--"
Steve shook his head. "You've done amazing, Buck."
Looking at Tony's slack face, his lifeless eyes, something insane gripped Steve. He flashed to Sleeping Beauty. Love's first kiss. This
"I'm sorry," Bruce said, "But we don't allow animals in the tower."
The nurse rubbed a dot of alcohol on Tony's inner elbow. There were already several other marks from that day. "Doctors requested another blood sample to compare against the previous readings."
is it you most love, Steven?"
For lack of anything else to do, Steve directed him to lay down on the bed, and then pulled his covers up to his chin. He doubted Tony was sleepy, having just got out of a hospital bed, but... what else could he do?
. The companion to the self. The one who leads in your footsteps."
"Stephen Strange, Thor, and every other consultant agrees it's not magic."
Steve shook his head. The team had a pretty good handle on the Slender Men -- there was no need to interrupt Thor's honeymoon with Jane Foster. Even Banner was standing on the sidelines in reserve.
He was right, God help him.
, Steve thought. Then he realized he was starting to take these two seriously. He glanced at Bruce, who was looking deeply unhappy.
“Has all the earmarks of one. You’re here to find yourself. Or,” he cast a swift glance at Grace who, as always, stood on Steve’s shoulder, “lose yourself, I guess.”
The wise man nodded to Tony, who sat lifeless and blank by the fire. "You love him, correct?"
"They yanked her out, tore her away from him." Strong claws dug into Steve's shoulder. "She was fighting, and fighting, and trying to get back to Tony." And Steve could see it, too, a form he couldn't quite make out, caged in by spectres. "We should have done something."
a magical curse. Maybe... maybe....?
"But there is still a link between Tony and his daemon," Kirjava said, unexpectedly. "It isn't broken, but strained. There may be a way to heal it, if we get her back in time."
When the edge of the subtle knife shard touched one of the spectre, it boiled away into nothingness.
Steve throat was thick. "I remember."
Steve frowned, barely understanding. "But… his daemon?" He looked from Will to the wise man and back again. Now that he had Grace — that he knew of her — he also knew, instinctively, that they could not stand to be parted a long distance. “If she is with Amora…”
Steve hesitated for a long moment and then nodded. His bald eagle daemon bent to pick at a flyaway hair on top of his head. It seemed to be a soothing gesture.
Grace held onto his shoulders, head bowed to the wind. Her strong talons and streamlined feathery body more than capable of holding on.
Steve reached up to rub between his eyes. He didn't get headaches anymore, not since the serum, but sometimes he still got the feeling one was building up when he was stressed.
Steve's breath caught, and even Tony seemed to pause. There was a moment of stillness. Then Tony tilted the Iron Man helmet to look down at himself, then back up at Amora. "Is something supposed to happen, here, lady?"
Steve's lips pulled into a smile. "Tony was being a wiseass to Amora. That's what he does when he --- he's got so many walls." Distantly, Steve felt his hand clench and release. "He keeps everything at arms length. He's so smart, and most of the time when he talks to you it's like he's got the conversation planned out three steps ahead." He took another breath, adding, "I knew his father, you know? We were friends, in the war. I think it was Howard who made him put all those walls up, and sometimes I wish... I wish
Strange's eyes flashed in indignation, as if he'd picked up the unspoken words. "Indeed, I am well versed in Asgardian brand of magic, although I lack the tools to replicate the results. All magic, Asgardian, Terran, Wiccan, leaves traces. I can assure you that he," Strange pointed a long finger at the uncaring Tony, "is without."
A couple of the nurses had backed away, giving Steve a view. Tony was out cold, with vicious self-made claw marks down his throat and chest. The nurses were securing his wrists with velcro straps to either side of the bed.
"Your assistance is needed on the rooftop landing pad, immediately." Mr. Stark has gone outside." A pause. "Hurry."
"No," Bruce said dryly. "I don't think so, either."
"And, um, the cat?" Bruce asked pointedly.
"I... don't think it's Thor," Clint said. "He usually doesn't do the green thing."
The days passed. Bruce brought in more specialists -- neurologists, psychiatrists, neurophysiologists, internal medicine doctors --  to consult and run tests. They took Tony on and off medications that had good results with catatonic patients, with no visible affect.
"Steve," Parry said, quietly urgent. "It's possible. Mary Malone learned to speak to her daemon, but she has to take care to hide him from sight, and that took her years. Even then, they can't be more than a few dozen feet apart. Ever."
"Wait." Steve looked at him sharply. "The rest?"
"Thor may be able to tell us more about Amora," Steve said a touch too loudly. "When he gets here--"
"Uh, Steve?" Tony said uncertainly, still hovering mid-air. And this... this was not how Steve wanted this conversation to go. Ever.
Pepper was sitting on the couch in the penthouse. She rose as they walked in, a tablet computer in her hand.
Bucky held up his hands. Both of them. "Alright, Stevie. Alright. I don't think Natasha's into sharing, is all."
"Nothing yet. They seemed to have disappeared with Amora. Natasha's working on tracking her down."
Steve relayed his apologies, but he couldn't leave the tower right then. Funny. He'd always disliked it when Tony left Pepper to twist in the wind when something major at SI came up, but there was nothing for it. Bruce needed Steve more.
"She could try." He didn't think it was his imagination. The air seemed to crackle with sudden electricity. "But Mjölnir would strike her from the sky within a moment. "But she said she would gain strength from Anthony's suffering? From his blood, yes. There are such dark magics. But this? I know not."
"He is alive, but the life is gone from him," Thor said. "He sees without seeing."
"Is there perhaps another way?" Thor asked.
"I refused to answer."
"Allow me to speak to the wise man first and explain our need," Thor said, then jumped easily off the chariot.
Bruce's voice was dry. "You might have heard, I've become an expert in the unusual."
Steve reacted on instinct, snatching his hand back, but it didn't seem to matter. Tony curled in on himself, his fingers clawing over his arc reactor, his eyes big and terrified and staring at something no one could see.
"Kirjava," Parry said, "my daemon."
The video was a little shaky, obviously taken from a hand-held camera or cell phone.  It was of Tony, who was dressed in a simple hospital gown, his bare legs poking out the bottom. He stood perfectly still and vacant as several men in different lab coats moved one of his arms to hold out straight, testing his reflexes. "No response," someone said out of view.
She looked down at him, a smile curving her lips. "Then I will let you choose."
And then he'd be like Tony, or worse. He looked at Parry. "But you said Malone can hide her daemon. I didn't see it in the tower."
Again, Parry exchanged glances with Malone. She nodded and spoke, "Doctor Banner, you know my research focuses on elementary particles within dark matter. What I never told -- well, I could never publish
Thor rumbled something that Steve couldn't quite make out, and he thought that should have bothered him, but he couldn't quite bring himself to care.
Steve let out a sound that might have been a half-laugh, if it didn't hurt so much. "Bucky that's--"
"No," Steve said firmly. "You're only doing your best for Tony, Bruce. You put your trust in the wrong person, but you can't hold yourself responsible for the acts of evil people."
The end.
Steve frowned. "How can you fight something you can't see?"
Later, the vid feeds showed that it had been another fit that had driven Tony outside. The nurse who had been watching him had gone on her hour lunch break -- leaving him alone. This was standard, as Tony didn't move at all until someone directed him.
--"fits." Steve said. He was tired, but he'd often gone on less sleep before during the war.
Two nurses were now going to be hired for full time supervision. Tony wasn't going to be left alone again. He shouldn't have been in the first place. Steve was supposed to be a tactician, but he'd never helped arrange care for another person before.
"It should have never been filmed in the first place." Steve paged back on the screen to the website's homepage. Sure enough, the video was CNN's top story.
"That is my fear, yes." Again, Parry hesitated as if to collect his thoughts. "To begin with, what you must know is there are generally three parts to a person; the body, the ghost or spirit... and the daemon."
Brownie points for anyone who recognized Riri, named after  as the main character Riri Williams in the Ironheart Marvel Comic series.
Thanks for reading! This ending was a long time coming, but I hope it was satisfactory for you.
Steve grit his teeth. "If you have a problem with any member of the Avengers," he called, trying to recapture her attention, "you should take it up with me."
Fear gripped him. Tony was on the landing pad? Alone?  "On my way," he said, and he knew it was a bad sign when the gym door swooshed open for him, allowing him to build up to a sprint.
, Steve thought.
And the tower felt so painfully quiet. Steve never realized how much presence Tony filled whenever he walked into a room. Even when he holed up in his lab for three days straight on a project, there was a sense of life eking out of the tower, in the JARVIS-lit walls and through his gadgets. In a way, living in the tower was like living in Tony's brain -- every floor mapped out by him, every invention either made or improved on by his design.
Dr. Parry didn't seem the least bit concerned. "Kirjava is quite well behaved."
Soon, they'd passed through the bulk of the city and were trundling along a road to the greater forest.
"Cap—" he began before he corrected himself. "
The sound cut Steve right down to the bone; Tony's pain, confusion, overlaid by soul-grating terror.
Giving one last look at them, Steve turned and began walking.
"Yes. I will take away what you love most of all. Just as this puny realm has taken my dearest heart from me. What--no,
"I will cast a spell," the wise man replied.
There is no reaction from Tony, and Steve had to resist the urge to do something ridiculous like kiss his forehead. Instead, he squeezed his shoulders — Tony felt so frail under his grip — and rose to join Thor.
She shook her head, wiping a tear away with a finger, and rose. "This is a copy of his living will. You can read through it, if you like. Right now, we can't ask Tony what he wants -- but he already told us, while he was able."
"I've traveled," Parry said, blandly. The cat twined its tail around his leg.
By the time a week had passed, Bruce started throwing around words like, "Very high level vegetative state" and the neurologists were repeating tests they'd done earlier in the week with no success. All Tony's brain scans came up perfectly normal.
Then, just as abruptly as it started, Tony's scream cut out. Amora laughed, lightning cracked again, and she was gone.
His heart lurched -- maybe Tony had snapped out of it, though JARVIS was supposed to tell him the moment anything happened. But... maybe that was him, and he'd come to yell at Steve, tell him to get out of his tower and never disgrace his door again. Kiss him. Something.
"You're a good friend, Steve."
The second thing was that the public found out about Tony's condition.
At once, Parry was knelt at Tony's side, taking his vitals. "I don't like how fast his heart is beating." He pinched Tony's skin on the top of his hand. "Dehydrated, too, like it or not."
Thor swept into the hospital room with a gust of ozone-tinted wind, and wearing a red Hawaiian shirt. He must have received the message while still on honeymoon with Jane.
"The brain PET scan showed no abnormalities, so we attached him to an EEG which registers electrical impulses, and ran some audiovisual tests." Bruce tapped one of the charts to expand it. "These brainwaves show he's conscious -- not in a true catatonic state --, and he's reacting within normal parameters when someone speaks, or when he was shown a flash card. His brain is recognizing what he's seeing. It's processing information. He can hear us, can probably understand us to some extent."
*****
The wise man nodded, encouraging, and Steve went on, "I remember that Bucky was standing beside me, and I... he's always been my best pal, ever since we were little. Our whole lives. But he was hurt for a long time," seventy years, "and he's been doing better, recently." He took in another deep breath, and with it he felt... odd. A little off kilter, as if the world had tilted a few degrees off its access.
Thor, to his credit, did nothing but nod when Steve got to the part where Amora asked him to choose who he loved.
Steve sighed. "Just do what you can. We'll find Amora before long. We'll set him to rights."
Will found Steve and his daemon sitting outside of the blind wise man’s hut, staring to the horizon.
Strange nodded and with a swish of his robes, he collected the oddly colored stones and walked out.
He didn't realize he needed to hear that until then. A little of the weight slid off his chest. "Thanks, Buck."
after him, this wouldn't have happened at all.
The cat paid him no mind. It stared at Tony in an intelligent, searching way that wasn't very cat-like at all. Then the cat turned to Parry and said quite clearly, "Did you see it, too?"
Thor, holding the reins at the head of the chariot, had a proud smile on his face. His smile slipped when he saw Tony unconscious in Steve's arms. He pulled the goats up to a stop and gestured. "Quickly! Sif and the Warriors Three have agreed to provide a distraction for the palace guards. These are my finest racing goats, but still we haven't much time to avoid notice."
Luckily, Will seem to understand what he could not say. "There are ways to separate yourself from your daemon. They are not pleasant."
"It is a bit difficult to explain," Parry said, taking up the thread. "And if I'm right-- I'm afraid Mr. Stark here may be only the beginning."
"Are you alright? Do you need me to take your pack?" Parry asked.
"And once he's back, I'll work double-time to get you two punks together."
"Tony screamed," Steve said.
Amora flung her hands dramatically out towards Tony.
"Do you see this?" he asked mostly to Grace. She trilled in acknowledgment.
“Twenty minutes,” Natasha retorted, folding her arms across her chest.
Something so pure should have made him happy but it hurt more.
Whenever Steve and the rest of the team were called out, Peter either stayed with the Parkers or, if they were unable, at the daycare in the new SHIELD HQ. At the daycare, Steve was pleased to find out Peter made some friends his own age. Two he had grown especially close to, Luke Cage and Ava Ayala, came over often. Luke was the son of SHIELD scientists and Ava was the child of the superhero, the White Tiger.
Peter scrambled after him but, by the time he got out from under the table, Wade was gone, leaving Peter with a tingling patch of skin on his face and a racing heart.
His couch.
“I figure I'll trust the genius, time traveler with protecting the fate of the future. If you really think this will work then, I want it.” Steve lightly rubbed Tony's ankle with his foot, just like he had and, as his heart did somersaults in his chest, he confidently whispered, “I trust you.”
Steve lay back on the small bed with a groan. His head hit the opposite wall and Peter loomed over him with a frown. Peter hit his side with his tiny fists and demanded, “Don’ be sad!”
And how was he able to jump like he did? Was he some kind of acrobat?
“Do monkeys even make out?” Peter teased, wrapping his arms behind Wade’s neck. The flowers brushed against the side of Wade’s face, drawing out the joy in his smile.
Later that night, in the ruins of the Tower, Tony snapped the sheets to their bed, trying to get off the debris that had settled there. He already patched up the hole in the ceiling but the building was going to need a lot more tender, loving care to get back to her former glory.
“Clint!” Steve groaned. “Language! Peter is right next to you!”
Steve peeked out from behind his hands as Tony leaned into his side. Tony lay one arm across the back of his shoulders and the other over his abdomen. There he fiddled with the end of his uniform and lightly caressed the skin of his hipbone beneath. Steve scowled at Tony. There was no need to be so familiar in front of Pepper, especially after what she just walked in on.
He heard his Aunt May cross the squeaky floorboards of the lower level to answer the door so he did not get up to answer it himself. He sleepily groped his bedside table for his phone to see what time it was. If it was early enough, he was going to go back to sleep.
“…You,” Steve replied dumbly and a slight flush crawled onto his cheeks.
He lay his finger on the trigger and then pulled.
Tony and Lana were dating by the end of the week.
Tony tilted his head to the side and his brows pinched in confusion when Jarvis said nothing more. He then heard his phone ringing coming from upstairs. He had left his cell phone on the living room couch after his last coffee break.
“I'm so in!” Tony declared.
Tony glanced at Steve and saw him smiling widely at Peter.
“Yes! Um…yes,” Tony said and sat down on the couch in a snap.
“Coffee, yes, it was fine…Tony, can we, um, come in?” Steve asked, just as awkwardly. Tony was standing in front of the elevator doors, blocking their access to the rest of the room for the last couple of minutes.
Tony would’ve done anything to stop them, even reveal the future so...so how did it still happen?
Tony had already done so much for him, he didn’t want to put this on him as well.
an ‘item’?”
Void of Steve.
Steve smirked at him with heated eyes and Pepper sighed lightly in exasperation.
Steve flush grew deeper and he peered down at the counter. He thought back to the years he had known Tony and asked, “You always felt this way toward me?”
“He just said he could not wait to see the pictures and that they’ll be totally believable…”
“Then could you ask him if he would like to join me and Peter for an outing? We could sneak past the reporters.”
are everything to me Tony…”
No one noticed that one present remained unopened as the sports lovers began to debate Dodgers vs. Yankees.
Grinning cheekily, Eddie replied, “Nah, I’m dying to see our results with a larger sample!”
Steve smiled, internally rolling for joy at the praise, and replied, “Thank you. You look great too.”
“Maybe we should retire,” Steve said with a sigh.
There was no mistaking it…
“Thank you,” Steve earnestly gasped.
“Alright…Well then let’s start from the beginning…to when we first started dating.” Tony sighed loudly then said, “I waited to ask out at first for two reasons…firstly, because I did not think you were gay, which you already know. Secondly…I never thought you would want someone like me…”
Natasha fell back into the couch and announced, “You two got it
With one look at this God stretched out before him, his dick instantly had blood pooling into it.
“Yes,” Tony’s voice was scarcely a decibel.
He managed to gasp, “
“He just has a concussion,” Tony reported with a relieved sigh.
They slowly shifted until Tony was the one on top and Steve was the one pressed back into the couch. Tony’s hands ran reverently along this torso and he asked, “Do you want to take this slow or can I take your uniform off? …I remember someone saying stable relationships don’t start off with sex on the first date but I’d like to prove him wrong.”
The rough voice made Tony’s spine tingle. Nope, that definitely was not Bucky.
He squeezed his eyes shut and his lip trembled for only a moment but then Tony pulled away and Steve’s strength returned. He looked down at his friend and saw a more subdued look on his face. His hazel eyes were cast elsewhere but Steve could see the warmth was gone. He was both relieved and crushed by the sight.
please.
“Proof that Tony Stark has a heart,” Steve sadly quoted and then ran his fingertips over the word “heart.” With this proof of Tony’s ability to love, Tony would survive and then fall in love with Steve.
Coulson wouldn’t tell him any more about the man that had saved him other than that he had been an agent of SHIELD.
Within a few days, Tony had “gamma-baby” proofed Steve’s floor and all the other living areas available for the toddler to access.
Venom did not leave him but returned to shirt form.
How could he be so lucky? To have Peter and to be able to date Tony? Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine his world would equate to this miraculous life.
The main stories in them were focused on Steve, and not the investigation, but his love life! They were all trying to guess who the lucky lady was in the ‘stable relationship.’ Many were guessing Natasha, which wasn’t a surprise. They were close friends and worked together on a lot of missions. Steve was actually one of the few people that could make the cold hearted assassin drop her façade for a few seconds to genuinely smile.
Steve clenched his fists, maybe he really would punch Bucky. He felt a flush grow on his cheeks from his anger toward Bucky’s actions and his shame for letting it happen, even if it was for a fraction of a second. He and Tony were just getting back on track! His stomach clenched painfully as he imagined telling Tony about the stolen kiss. He would never keep such things from him but he hated that he had to hurt him again.
save him…”
Tony reached out to him and tightly grasped his hand. He swore to his son, “You’re going to be fine. We all survived and that monster won’t touch you
“Sir…is everything alright?”
As if to prove his point, Thor grinned happily at him from the kitchen table with half of a purple Poptart sticking out of his mouth.
“Same for me,” Wade replied with a happy grin.
and we are good – we would be good together.
Ben pointed to Steve’s image and stated, “Steve Rogers. The people who had you, they used his sperm to impregnate you.”
The breath caught in his throat upon Jarvis’s announcement.
So Steve did the only thing he could think of, he grabbed the smaller man and pulled him tightly into his embrace so his chest was plastered against Steve’s and the light from his reactor was put out.
Steve was not letting a friend die, nonetheless
!” Venom shrieked, its voice was so much like Peter’s that it made the acid from his stomach rise into his throat. He did not think it could talk. Was this a sign that they were losing Peter??
So Tony was not the target…
Tony cupped Steve's jaw with a wirely smirk and he retorted, "And so will you, beloved."
They’d have that again but this time there’d be no edge of fear about being discovered. They could just love and love and love and have no care in the world…Steve couldn’t wait.
Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out a small jar. He held it up to Tony and said, “I hunted down Howard and told him I was looking for a cream for my skin. I figured he’d be the only one in camp with a ‘ridiculously expensive’ cream like you used to use…but the label doesn’t say what it contains so I don’t know if it has the same Japanese seaweed stuff in it like your other cream.”
Steve thought back to their fight earlier and Steve wondered how to broach a conversation about it. He was still upset by it, though it had been lessened greatly diminished by the revelation that they were soulmates and the fact that men could get
Steve wordlessly went to Tony with the small amount of time remaining to him and Bucky just as silently followed.
“But the state of New York says I cannot leave its borders while I’m out on bail,” Steve stated with a forced smile but his voice came out huskier than he meant it to. Steve’s smile shook as the realization crossed Tony’s face and sorrow grew in his gaze.
“Aunt May-?” Peter implored, desperation lacing his voice.
“Peter’s here?!” Steve gasped, only hearing that crucial bit.
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied and the alarm immediately stopped blaring.
They threw off all their clothes and crawled into the bed.
Did he break some ribs too?
Peter bent down to continue kissing him but Wade pressed a hand to the center of Peter’s chest and said, “No, stop.
Bucky didn’t try to stop looking for someone to love though he admittedly looked for it in all the wrong places. As he grew older, he noticed there were dames looking for a good time and Bucky provided it and did his best to ignore the countdowns they had on their timers. He wanted someone to love and to love him in return. Even if there was the smallest chance he could find someone to be with, despite what his implant said, Bucky would keep trying to find love.
Steve nodded and the car became stationary. Everyone looked to Steve to make the first move. Steve closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and stilled his shaking hands by gripping his thighs tightly. He snapped open his eyes and stated, “Let’s go.”
Was that Pepper? Did she get the information??
He was not allowed a name and, if he had one, it did not matter. His master decided he did not need one so that was that.
“This is so cool,” he gasped, holding up the mechanics uniform Steve had snatched for him.
Tony paused a few feet away from them and Steve walked the rest of the distance. It felt…surreal approaching him. He wasn’t sure how to act and, unfortunately, his heart immediately filled with happy emotion with Tony’s presence. That same heart withered as he reminded himself that he couldn’t love Tony anymore…or, well, at least they couldn’t love
“You saw,” he replied. “Bucky shot Ross then—then kissed me.”
Before Steve sound formulate a reply, Venom lashed out and hit Tony with one of its tendrils. Tony went flying across the room but Thor jumped into his path and caught him before the already injured man could be hurt more.
His silence was discontenting to Tony.
Tony laughed and said, “I like you.”
,” Tony gasped his name like it was a fervent prayer. He grasped Steve’s legs with trembling hands and pushed his legs up and open, totally exposing Steve to him. Steve flushed as Tony positioned himself between his legs. The hard length of his erection brushed against his thigh and Steve’s gut clenched. It was so erotic with his legs spread open wide and Tony being able to see all of he felt sinfully wanton. It was wrong and right all at once. Steve was already gasping shallowly trying to catch his breath.
They ended up needing to gasp for breath again, still getting used to the concept of needing to breathe while kissing. They shared a chuckle and Tony took that moment to slick up his fingers. Steve nodded and lay back. Tony leaned over him and peppered him with kisses as he prepped him, another task that took longer in the real world, but neither really noticed as they worshipped each other.
! The State sees me as his sole guardian! Can you imagine all the legalities we are going to go through to bring you back to life and be his guardian
“The better to cuddle you with, my dear,” Wade sang.
“You okay?” Tony inquired.
Thor lowered his hammer and murmured, “The Captain may not wake because his body still requires rest...”
“Not to mention how yous met,” Bucky added, a little bit of a Brooklyn drawl slipping into the words as he slouched on the stool, leaning slightly onto Steve.
They kept their mouths connected as long as they could. Shallowly gasping for air whenever one of them tilted their heads or move their lips right. But it finally became too much and they broke apart with sharp gasps.
Coulson smiled and replied, “Very much so, Cap. Congratulations.”
Tony lifted his head and was surprised to see Pepper standing beside him. Her high heels usually echoed loudly off the metal stairs and he should have heard her come up behind him.
Eddie sits up straighter and turns to Tony, asking, “What did you say?”
“Jarvis,” Steve whispered, his tongue heavy. “Natasha can go.”
"Ready to work, loverboy?" Natasha asked Steve. Instead of blushing like he had yesterday, Steve paled.
Tony rubbed his crotch into Steve’s hand and murmured, “I can’t possibly rise to the occasion right now, but later, I might be able to assist you in that.”
“Rumor?” Tony gasped.
“…You don’t have to keep an eye on me 24/7, Buck,” Steve whispered, feeling bad.
In their dream, he and Tony were lounging in Tony’s bedroom at the Tower, outside, however was an evergreen forest Steve had trekked through in France.
Everyone was able to fit into the elevator and the conversation about SHIELDS’ new agents assigned to the Avengers’ missions continued. Peter and Wade stood in the back corner and he privately murmured to Wade, “I think it went well.”
Venom hissed, “I followed your sssscent.”
Truth be told I already decided the ending to Part 3 and just asked to see your opinions of what could happen and my oh my, are y'all verbal!
“They’ve enforced the building. The schematics the city has are useless. There could be anything in there…” Tony stated grimly.
Steve was amazed by the number of cars in the city.
Tony smirked at him, expecting Steve to tease him but Steve’s expression was not carefree. Instead, it was guarded which made Tony instantly wary.
“And I don’t hear you objecting, Bionic Man,” Tony replied. When Bucky did not retort, Tony turned back to Steve, he said, “Part 6 is definitely going to work. Now that Natasha knows we can take a more direct approach. We just need Peter to do his wall crawling deal, carrying my awesome robot backpack, and th—.”
Wade’s entire body sizzled with the words and his hands grabbed onto Peter’s upper thighs like he was preventing him from flying away or changing his mind. Peter’s fingers trailed back to his chest and followed the channels of his muscles. Wade wanted to physically reciprocate but he didn’t want to deter Peter, who looked like he wanted to say more on the subject.
This didn’t just suck…it was downright horrible.
“Pepper!” Steve yelled, surging forward into the mess of metal.
There was a tentative knock at the door and Pepper stuck her head in and whispered, “Tony?”
Ironically, his first thoughts on time travel were of
“I am done being that man’s puppet,” he hissed. He pushed himself back, further from the door and the pull of Schmidt’s voice. It hurt even more. His body was trembling from the pain. He kept telling himself it was all in his head, that the pain was not real but his body did not seem to understand.
Peter cracked open his eyes and saw Wade looked sad. He asked, “What are you apologizing for?”
Peter listened to the exchange feeling the control of his own life slipping out of his hands. How did it come to this? Was there anything he could have done different to have prevented this?...
. I was rooted to the spot. I even forgot my mission for a second until Dr. Calvin – the Chameleon – my master, reminded me. I knew the mission was my priority and I kept him there but I could not look away from his eyes and see that unconditional
“Did–
Steve returned the hug and murmured, “It’s okay.”
“I know,” Tony grumbled under his breath. “But I’m usually quite vocal so this will be hard…”
He took out his newest suit, the Mark 17. He called the suit "Heartbreaker", because of its oversized chest RT, that fired more powerful blasts than his older models could handle. It could fire narrow or wide beams and could also generate a Repulsor Shield for protection. It was all he would need to deal with any rouge Hydra agents that happened to be guarding the Winter Soldier.
“Bucky?” Steve finally gasped, his throat thick with emotion.
He shook his head and murmured, “You don’t have to do anything more, Pep…”
With his arms crossed over his chest, Bruce stated, “You are going to be monitored the entire time you are out of bed and as soon as your nurse says you have to go back, then you are going back, no exceptions.”
He sat in his bed, with his face hidden in his hands, what felt like ages. He grieved, he hated himself, and he worried for Steve.
“What’s going on Steve? Did Tony get out?” Bruce gasped. He held his own phone in a tight vise and his green eyes stood out in stark contrast to the rest of his face. When Steve stared blankly at him, Bruce gasped, “
Ultron threw itself at Wade and slammed him into the wall. Wade grunted and Ultron wrapped its fingers around his throat. Ultron hissed, “I am no joke. I know you cannot die but I can snap your ‘baby boy’ like a twig. You…You…” Ultron’s voice dwindled as Wade lifted a square shaped remote. The robot demanded, “What is that?”
DUN DUN DUN
Wade smiled and his eyes crinkled with his joy as he murmured, “Alright, baby boy. Whatever you want…”
Peter’s voice was just a quiet whisper but Wade jolted as if he was electrocuted again. For a second, he assumed it was Peter’s ghost whispering to him and Death had succeeded in taking him. His entire soul broke at the thought. He could feel his insides crumbling and tears blurred his eyes.
Peggy shook his hand and said, "It's nice to meet you, Lieutenant."
“Apparently it’s a past that does not matter anymore,” Bucky stated, shaking his head. Steve frowned when Bucky quoted Natasha’s words and knew the memory involved her. Bucky’s eyes trailed up Steve’s body, cataloging his wounds, and asked Steve, “How are your injuries?”
Eventually, Tony’s phone dinged, alerting them to their time being up. The noise woke Peter, who mumbled unhappily from lack of sleep.
“LET GO HULK FRIEND!”
Tony lightly dislodged Steve’s fingers and whispered, “You shouldn’t touch me so intimately anymore…”
for Tony.
The first week was spent mostly in bed.
“Sir, your increased heart rate will make your window of time without the reactor smaller,” Jarvis observed.
Bucky was more curt in his greeting and crossed his arms as he grumbled, “You got a look in your eye that tells me I gotta tie Steve to me or else you’re gonna drag him off and get him in trouble.”
“Finding Stark should be easy enough,” the priest murmured, making Steve’s head snap up.
but this time it wasn’t Steve crashing to his death. Steve could handle dying…he
“Hear what she has to say,” Bruce implored, not agreeing one way or the other.
Natasha punched him square in the nose and blood splattered her face. Their implants beeped as their flesh violently touched for the first time (she was wearing fingerless gloves). They both ignored it.
He didn’t move for a few minutes. His emotions were all over the place and he wasn’t ready to leave just yet. This was the closest he would ever be to Steve again and maybe his spirit was there like Bucky believed and Tony didn’t want to go if he was still there. Even if Tony couldn’t see him, he wanted to be there with him.
Peter handed over the controller with a frown and he glared at Harry. Harry stuck his tongue out at him and Peter murmured, “Thor is so going down next time.”
“Y-Yeah, yeah…” Peter stuttered in reply. Before he could second guess himself, Peter held out his hand and willed Venom to Eddie. The dark mass slowly slipped from Peter’s body and crossed the few feet between him and Eddie in one large tentacle. Eddie eagerly reached out and accepted Venom with an excited smile.
They all turned to him with shocked expressions and Steve gasped, “W-What?”
Steve’s hand stopped and he cursed under his breath.
Peter smiled and whispered, “So no more killing?”
The bottle was already open, he had started off the night with a couple of shots, and he took a swig from the bottle. He stumbled back to his workbench and kicked over the bottle of barely touched scotch in the process.
“What?” Peter gasped, his imagination coming up with multitudes of horrifying scenarios.
“…We need to help,” Steve whispered, watching Pepper worriedly.
Steve inhaled sharply and he nodded so furiously Tony laughed.
He had goggles and thick gloves on but that was all he wore in protective wear. He was barefoot in jeans and a black tank. His arc reactor glowed through the fabric and his hair was a mess.
Pepper nodded and murmured, “Our stock prices dropped slightly but not as much as I thought it would.”
He wouldn't have to worry about hiding his uniform under his clothes if his uniform was actively working to hide itself.
Clint swiftly hit the button before Steve could twitch.
Several minutes later, Steve was leaning into Tony’s side, holding his hand, and they traded off talking as they told Marston how they fell in love. It was the same one they told Bucky and Marston and the rest of the audience were totally enraptured by their story.
Hope billowed Steve's chest. He asked, “Do you think it will work?”
His eyes snapped open.
Peggy paused then gently said, “I only want to help.”
“That’s Jarvis, my AI,” Tony explained upon seeing Peter’s confused expression. He probably hadn't realized the other voice in the video that was sent to him was an AI. He probably just assumed it was another person like Tony's butler or something. Tony cleared his throat and looked particularly at Peter. He asked, “That all depends on Peter. Are you still going to go?”
Steve stared blankly at the creature, its words were too insane to be true.
The last thing Steve saw was the Winter Soldier standing at the forefront of the group. Most of his fire was directed at the Iron Man suit and the man's eyes narrowed with displeasure as his bullets bounced off the armored suit.
Norman murmured, “I’m touched you grace me with your presence…is your son here too?”
Steve’s eyes warmed and then he crooned, “I expect you to know the same of me, sweetheart…”
Steve almost groaned with annoyance. Bucky was still as stubborn as he used to be, that was for sure. He was glad for the distraction. He rather focus on Bucky and his ‘mission’ than Tony or what Steve was doing there.
He’d survive it all and go back to living his life as he was supposed to, as a machine.
Steve continued, “Tonight was a disaster and I…” Steve cupped his mouth for a moment, inhaled and exhaled deeply through his nose. He dropped his hand and said, “And I am so disappointed in you.”
outside of this universe. Ultimately, he is the definition of a major flight risk. This is not even his era. He is from a different time and holds no connections to ours. In addition, there is countless video evidence of his use of violence against others. He is a menace to the public.” Steve felt his ire rising with every new hypocrisy.
“You heard me, I'm going to woo you and then progress our relationship as normal once you've fallen for me.”
. “I’ll – I’ll see you around.”
“I kinda initiated it,” Wade teased and he shifted his hips into Peter, lightly humping him.
?” Steve murmured.
“Speaking of dating…isn’t this date supposed to move on to my lab with dancing?”
“Steve, are you okay??” Tony hissed.
Oh, God, Steve.
Steve came for a second time into Tony’s mouth.
Behind him, he heard Peter stop running and begin his stretches. Steve glanced to Peter, then back to Natasha. He stated, “Don’t go too hard on either of them. We all had the best intentions at heart.”
“What then?” Steve asked. “Why would Hydra want to know all of that?”
All his life, Peter imagined himself growing up to be like his fathers. He always envisioned himself becoming a superhero just like them.
Rogers tipped his head to the side and said, “Yes, in so many words, yes. He wanted to say more but did not know what to say.”
“Sorry,” Peter mumbled. “Just having a mini panic attack. No big deal. I’m currently adjusting to the fact total strangers are going to recognize me now and it’s not going too smoothly.”
Tony squeezed him tightly and his heartbeat raced out of control.
Aunt May instantly slammed the door and yelled, “PETER?!”
Peter sighed heavily, “Go ahead...”
. He was the one who called you two back? You’re here to investigate Peter??”
All this horror may have amounted to something good after all.
“Just leave me alone!” Peter snipped. He had been betrayed by all of them: Pops, Uncle Tony, Uncle Bucky, Aunt Tasha, all of them.
Now understanding the reasoning to both of men’s amusement, Steve snorted as well and said to Tony, “We have to correct this before people start asking for

Pepper promptly turned around and started walking away. Over her shoulder, she said, “Have fun with your honeymoon phase, boys!”
..." He inhaled sharply and held his breath to stifle a sob. When he finally exhaled, he whispered, "Remember when you first brought us to the penthouse in New York and I told you, wherever you are, it’d be my home?” Steve’s voice shook a little as he watched Tony struggle to keep his eyes open.

As it was, his anxiety was building along with the effects of his hangover. He never thought about August 20th or what it meant to him beyond the confines of the date. It was safer that way because, if he thought on it anymore, his life would be all the bleaker. But here it was August 21st, that meant this hidden part of Tony's life was encroaching on another day and threatened to spew into all the other days.
Vision nodded curtly and then Wade’s entire body was jerked down under the force of Vision’s take off. He blinked a few times as he lost sight of Peter in the jerking surprise but he saw the cloud just as far from Wanda’s reach as they flew through the sky.

Steve silently slipped out of the bed and, after putting on some pants, he tried to keep quiet as he picked up the penthouse.
“Sir, we’re going to have to take the Captain into the courtroom now,” the lone female in the group of lawyers interceded.
Steve looked back to Peter and his eyes fell on the Iron Man action figure. He sighed and said, “Thank you.”
He gasped, “It-It is amazing to meet you!” He held out his hand and Peter reluctantly shook it. “May I take your picture and put it on my wall?”
“It is true. There’s a very low chance of this working…”
Bucky tightly grabbed his arm and pulled him to a violent stop. Bucky hissed, “One of the first things Tony warned us about was saying anything to his dad! I wasn’t raised by him like Tony and even I know that man would abuse the knowledge he’d gain from the future!”
