“we can be together!” he cried and got on his knees and begged while taking off his shirt. He was scarred and super buff and super hot and he looked just like gardr way begging. Then he started to sing an mcr song of love.
TONY ‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼!
we started to French passively. He took off my red top and I took off his leather pants. Then we got on the bed.
The engineer groans out loud when his mind conjures up a hazy image of the redheaded assassin smirking at Tony as she fills up the shot glass with AsomBroso tequila.
“You done yet?” Tony finally says after a significant period of silence. If the situation wasn’t delicate, Bruce would’ve laughed out loud at the stunned look on Tony’s face. “‘Cos all this talk is honestly giving me the hives, Brucie-pie.”
As Steve fries up the pan and Tony goes to take out plates and cutlery, the super soldier can’t help the rush of affection that spreads through his chest because
To recap, Steve recalls the moment when Tony got hit by an alien weapon (which Bruce is currently scanning using some updated tech that he and Tony developed, as far as the super soldier knew), when his whole suit of armor was surrounded by a blue light that lasted for about five seconds before the light disappeared and the engineer dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes. The fact that Tony wasn’t propelled backwards upon impact when he was shot could probably mean that it was a deliberate hit.

“There’s nothing wrong with you, Tony,” Steve cuts in with a frown.
But even then, his defenses aren’t completely lowered because, well, the few times he allowed himself to be totally vulnerable to people he cared about, he ended up having daddy issues before he hit puberty while one literally pulled the arc reactor from his chest.
it to my face. They don’t have to. But I’m smart enough to read between the lines. So.”
Frowning, Bruce bites his lower lip before he says, “And what of his brain, JARVIS? Any anomalies?”
A few weeks has passed since Clint shared the news to Bruce and the rest of the team of Tony’s ability to wield Mjölnir. Bruce was startled, as were the others, while Thor, surprisingly, reacted favorably to the news. In fact, he was so thrilled that it took Steve using his Captain America voice to refrain the Asgardian from hunting Tony down and congratulating him for “being the first Midgardian and a fellow shield-brother who is worthy of his dear hammer”.
“Ah, Steve, that was epic,” Tony says with a chuckle, bright brown eyes twinkling against the fluorescent lights of the diner.
This time, he doesn’t see Tony’s blushing face or the awestruck expression on his face.
“Point taken, but I think there’s something to be said about being hit with an alien god’s weapon, accident or not,” Tony retorts, though he still looks distraught. Then he kneels next to Natasha who’s only able to get up on her elbows, one gauntleted hand gesturing at the hammer still innocently resting on her broken thighbone. “I’d say wait for Thor, but I’m afraid if we wait any longer it’ll only cause more damage to your leg. SHIELD medic’s on the way now, so. May I?”
“Yeah, he did,” he agrees as he eyes the syringe with mild concern. “Uh, Bruce, what are you doing? What’s the needle for?”
Steve wonders. When he glances down at his sketchpad, he’s shocked to see the corners of the page where he was sketching one of Natasha’s guns laid on top of the coffee table smudged with sweat. Flustered, he closes his sketchpad and subtly runs his hands over his denim pants to wipe off the moisture that built up upon his realization that
“Should we contact the Director?” Thor asks then. The worry that’s simmering in the demigod’s eyes somehow comforts the super soldier.
It takes him a few tries to swallow past the lump forming in his throat to croak out a reply. “I just — I didn’t think it was that important.”
Pepper waves off his apology with a tired smile.
Pepper nods her head in understanding, and there’s a profound sadness in her eyes as she continues. “I— I can see it. And I won’t ask, or even demand you to give me answers. But you know I’m here for you, Tony. Right? And I’m willing to listen whenever you’re ready to talk. Okay?”
things he’d love to do to Tony’s ass.
Hmmm do you miss me tho, Dorito? Do you? Do you?
, goes by a pronoun. Well, who’s he to judge, anyway?
“Yeah, Brucie?” He hears Tony ask, and he sounds like he’s half listening, the other man absorbed in breaking down the schematics of the spear-like weapon their enemy used to fight them.
“I’ve been walking around this area for the past hour, and every time I passed by, there’s this troubled look on your face. Not even those glasses of yours can hide the burden you’re carrying, dear.”
“Don’t move!” Tony snaps at her before he repulsors a lamp post off his legs before getting up to approach her prone form. “J, scan for injuries. I don’t want to move her unless anything critical’s been hit. Also, where the hell is Thor?”
,” Steve snaps.
to see the slackened expression on the stern SHIELD Director’s face for once.
“JARVIS informed me that his temperature’s lower compared to the last scan we did,” Bruce begins as he takes out a few medical supplies from his bag.
Tomorrow’s troubles can wait, he decides resolutely. For tonight, they have each other to comfort and to share in the victory of another job well done.
by closing the book and returning it to where he found it on the coffee table in front of him.
“Tony,” Pepper interjects with another deep sigh, and Tony winces at that familiar tone that could only mean an upcoming verbal lashing if he doesn’t give her a proper answer soon. “I’ve literally just arrived from a fifteen-hour flight from Dubai. I had to hear from Bruce and Steve of what happened to you
(See the end of the chapter for
“I agree,” Thor nods with a troubled look as he distractedly plays with a banana peel.
But before Steve can ask Tony to expound on that, Thor suddenly calls out to them in his loud, booming voice that lunch is finally ready. In that instant, everyone in the living room gets up from their seats to gather around the dining table laden with a delicious spread.
“We need to talk to Tony,” Natasha agrees with a nod.
swearing. I seem to have lost the — ability? — to do so.”
“All this time you knew you could lift Mjölnir, yet you never said a thing,” Clint adds, head tilted in curiosity.
“I’m a genius, remember?”
Steve smirks and he concedes with a nod. “Well, except Nat, obviously.”
witnessed Tony be this expressive before. Ever.
“Let me take a wild guess,” Tony remarks as he starts jogging backwards, away from the portal and the approaching Chitauri. “These asshats figured out what the suit was for, destroyed it before it can reach them, and now there’s more of them coming in.”
She’s jogging backwards when she aims her Bites at one bot and takes one down. They’re quickly catching up to her, and with nowhere to hide, Natasha has no other choice except to use each and every arsenal at her disposal. She starts shooting at the approaching bots once she ran out of explosives. It didn’t do much damage, to be honest, but she notices that if she shoots them in the head they tend to topple over the bot beside them.
“u guys omg…. U have no idea‼‼‼ I cant take dis anymore‼‼” I ran away from dem to commit sue cide.

Gamora was wearing a leather crop top wit no straps and a blood red choker that said ‘hate life’ on it wit black spikes. She had tattoos all down her arms and her skin wasn’t green anhymore it was a dark green almost lik black and her hair was black too wit red streaks instead. She had a nose ring and her pants were all torn and rippd wit skulls all over them. She was wearing leather combat boots. She had lots of white foundation and eyeliner on.

“Kill him here or I’ll kill him myself. The treaty will be upheld no matter the fall out,” Howard spat out.
“Um, lunch?  We could go for a late lunch.”
There was a sense of the uncanny in the way her lips were tipped up in the beginnings of a smile and the soft wrinkles around her eyes. Tony realized he recognized the expression as the one his mother gave him whenever she had caught sight of him. His body was frozen with the intensity of emotion swirling in him and as the man moving the painting finally disappeared with it into the bowels of the shop Tony felt the same pain he’d felt when he realized he'd never see that look on Maria Stark’s face again.
Confusion flickered across Steve’s face again and then his eyes shifted down, taking in the fact that Tony was still cradling his face.  “Uh, then what …?”
Tony really did love his friends.
“Oh my God, Bamah! Guess what Captain America just bought.”
There was one rule about the remote war the others demanded - and that was only one prank per week per participant.  So it wasn’t really unusual for the two of them to be in the family room resorting to more traditional ways to fight about what to watch on TV.  Unfortunately for Steve, Tony had no reservations about invading Steve’s personal space.  Something he still blushed furiously at when he remembered trying to hold the remote above them out of Tony’s reach.
“Steve Ro-“
She started typing quickly and mumbling to herself.  The
Coffee cup held firmly in his right hand, fine leather briefcase (red and gold because he has style) hanging from the grip of his left hand, Tony opened his mouth to say … something.
Tony’s eyes had widened, his breath momentarily stopped when Steve had said his name. Everything after that was not in the standard vows and Tony realized Steve had written his own vows - vows he was making to Tony directly in the presence of everyone to see and record.
Steve was going to die of embarrassment, especially when he reached the doors and heard Ashley shout to one of her coworkers.
The wind coming off the ocean suddenly turned sharp and hard.  Sand was dusted up in thick plumes, racing down the beach towards the cliffs.  The two men observing the east wall of Brooklyn Castle crumbling at the top of the cliff hunched their shoulders against the sudden onslaught.  The thinner man, who had a dusting of white at the temples of his dark hair, was suddenly seized in a coughing fit.  He hacked hard as sand flew around them, causing him to momentarily loose his grip on the thick sheaf of papers in his hands.  Almost as if sensing the weakness, the wind caught the papers and tossed them about, sending some pieces of parchment rolling down the beach. Most of the pages landed in the waiting surf which tried to snatch as much of it away and out to sea.
“It’s top of the line,” Karen protested.
“Maybe I like to live dangerously.”
Steve’s smile grew wider, his eyes dark and infinitely fond as if to say “I have no idea what you’re talking about, but I’m happy you’re telling me.”
“How dare you!?” Howard roared, the glass dropping to the ground as he surged out of his chair.  The thick carpet absorbed the untouched liquor.  “You are nothing! A poor orphan with little prospects who wants my son to wallow in the garbage with you.  I will not stand for it! You will cease all communication with him or I shall disinherit him and ban him from ever laying eyes on anything Stark so long as I live!”
“You let me climb you like a fucking tree, Steve, of course I was flirting with you.”

, she’s looking for someone. You have her eyes.” The thoughts were disjointed but Tony must have said something right because the man’s face cleared. The same ethereal light lit up his eyes and he smiled directly, solely, for Tony.
Mark was talking and it was a pleasant hum in the background as Tony’s mind wandered to its favorite subject.  He remembered the first time he met Steve Rogers.  Tony didn’t exactly remember where it was, just one of those charity events he went to on what felt like a weekly basis these days.  Some glittering debutante had been chatting him up when a small, but rather stunning force, slammed into his back.  Tony had stumbled into the debutante (Karin? Kathy? Kitty?) as a pair of hands had frantically grabbed for his waist from behind.  The hands missed their target and slipped over Tony’s ass, the sides of this thighs before disappearing and a ringing “fuck!” came from the floor.
“So you and Stark still have this little war goin’?  Jan was sure you’d have figured it out by now.”
Tony gave Steve such a baleful look at that he started laughing.
The man shook his head, the sun lighting up the blond strands and making them a liquid gold.  Quickly, he finished his task gathering as many lost pages as he could before turning them over to the dark headed man.  They spoke quietly to each other before both men looked up and over to where Tony was relaxing on the outcropping he had decided to sun himself on, his belly to a flat sandy boulder.  Tony gave them a brilliant smile and waved again, this time only really using his wrist, making his hand look more like a flopping fish.  The dark-haired man looked heavenward before throwing his hands up and stomping away towards to the path that connected the beach to the castle grounds.
“You, Obadiah Stane, have shown a supreme lack of common sense and self-preservation here, tonight, and no doubt your King will find similar faults with the years of public service you have provided the people of Northern York.”
“There has been a mis-”
“And it will be.  Let me show you what real genius looks like.”  Tony squeezed his hand, just now realizing neither one had let go.
Summary: Tony usually does the shopping, but this time Steve has to make some purchases and Twitter will never let him forget it.
Tony threw up his arms in exasperation but before he could turn away Steve grabbed him by the front of his shirt and pulled him forward.  The moment their lips met Steve slanted his mouth and kissed Tony like a man on a mission.  Tony’s lips parted easily and as their kiss deepened - as Steve’s tongue swept into Tony’s mouth - Steve found they’d wrapped their arms around each other and Tony had hooked one of his feet around Steve’s calf.  They were pressed as closely together as their clothes allowed and all Steve wanted was to get closer.
“So Mr. Erskine thought you might like a ticket to this show.”
“Thank God, yours two’s flirting over remotes was fucking irritating.”
“Sit, Tony.”
Tony narrowed his eyes at the bowl placed in front of him. Tomato, he hoped. He’d only been at Castle Brooklyn for a week and he couldn’t shake the sensation of creepiness in the mausoleum-like building he now had to call his home. Glancing up from the soup he looked down the long table to where his
The prince was moving quickly towards him, the hastily donned robe fanning out around his legs and drawing Steve’s attention to the bared and slightly muddied feet. Other than patches of dirt and a leaf in his hair, Tony appeared unhurt. Behind him, though, Steve found where the new scent of blood was coming from. Pepper, Tony’s courtier and close friend, followed behind him. She was dressed similarly to the prince but the bottom of her face and visible cleavage bore the unmistakable remains of gore and gristle. Behind her, Colonel Rhodes and Bucky were likewise marred.
Pepper collected him promptly at 1 pm and after an annoyingly long ride in the car (which Pepper gleefully used to make Tony go over some mind numbingly boring paperwork) Tony discovered where the office chairs came from.  The converted factory in Brooklyn housed several dozen chairs, all of which were customizable. Being that this was both a benign and necessary task Tony tried to make as quick a decision as possible, which Pepper thwarted by making sure he understood the mechanics of a proper chair and the chairs role in the health of his back. Mechanically, he felt he could make a far superior chair but there was also a lot of undeniable science behind the designs of these chairs that he could appreciate and instead made a carefully informed (and far more superior, tasteful) decision.
“So?”
“Give the man $18,000, Pep.”
Warnings: Skinny Steve, Jockey Steve, Billionaire Tony, Love at first sight
“What does that mean?” But Logan was already leaving the room, shrugging his shoulders as he disappeared from sight.
Logan’s answer was another grunt.  Tony picked up his fork, scooping up some eggs, but before he could get the cutlery to his mouth a sudden shock of electricity ran up his spine.  He froze, trying to keep his reaction to a minimum even as the shooting lust settled in his groin.  Tony’s eyes slid to Steve who was hiding a grin behind his mug, his other hand suspiciously hidden in the pocket of his pants.  The genius shifted on his stool, trying to ease the sharp pleasure coming from deep inside of him.  A low growl came from Logan’s direction and when Tony dared to look at him the man’s eyes were narrowed into dangerous slits, his frown threateningly showing off his pointed incisors.
Steve’s eyes did shoot to Logan who was tipping back his drink.  When he was done, Logan scooped up the remote and tossed it to the super-soldier.
“I smell like the gorgeous, brilliant man you’ll never amount to, Barton,” Tony shot back with a big smile.
“Go Be A Hero.”  The man’s voice was strong, husky in a way that seemed to fill and expand, commanding a presence all its own.  Tony blinked at the unusual name but if he recalled correctly race horses all tended to have bizarre names.  Then again, he did name his first robot Dum-E so who was he to judge?
Steve’s brow drew together in momentary confusion before his expression cleared, leaving no inkling of what he was thinking. “You will be Lord Consort after we are married, whoever you wish to visit or stay is up to you, no one will interfere. We may have options and express them but if you want someone to be here then your wish is law.”
The woman nodded and stopped typing long enough to clamp Steve’s form to an arm attached to her monitor, then propped his ID up between the keys on her keyboard.  She quickly tabbed through whatever she was doing on the computer screen, typing out information from time to time.  The blond man ambled by and to the back which appeared to be what Tony called a “cubicle farm.” By this time the woman had pulled his form out of the clip and stood up.
Rhodey’s face softened, “I know, under bestie law I am both sorry and ready to maul the fuck out of any vampire that tries to hurt you - king or no. But as a member of the Royal Guard and thus under the rule of your asshole father, you’re getting packed up and moving into Brooklyn Castle by the end of next month. Obadiah has already written up the peace treaty and started making the arrangements.”
“Have you settled well?”
“I’ll be right back,” was all she said with another brittle smile before turning around the corner and out of sight.
“It looks just like it did last time, right down to the smudged “O” on the off button.”
Steve could tell he’d actually managed to stump the genius with his actions but for once Steve couldn’t appreciate it, Logan’s words from weeks ago which had been nagging at the back of his mind now coming to forethought.
“Looks like you had a fun night.”
The remote was on the coffee table when Steve entered the room.  He stopped abruptly eyeing the small electronic device suspiciously.  It sat rather innocuously on the glass topped octagon shaped piece of furniture.  Also on the coffee table were two of Jan’s fashion magazines and a Time Magazine featuring Tony in one of his “poised businessman” poses.  For a second Steve’s eyes wandered instinctually over the features of the man, noting he could tell exactly when the photo was taken by the carefully covered up bruise fading on his chin and the lack of scar between his left temple and hairline.
Deflated, Tony slumped in his chair. He wanted to keep raging but it wasn’t Rhodey’s fault. And since no one who deserved his anger was present he didn’t have the energy to cover up the fact that he was scared as fuck.
“Eventful,” he said succinctly.
Tony usually does the shopping, but this time Steve has to make some purchases and Twitter will never let him forget it.
Prompt: Go Be a Hero
“Everything looks good.”
After steadying himself and the young woman he had looked down to the startling sight of a blond head between his feet.  The man had landed face down so Tony’s first impression was that the man had a nice head of floppy, golden hair.  The man’s head turned and a single gleaming blue eye stared up at Tony.  Tony had been more amused than anything but apparently, the downed man just freaked out, trying to get off the ground and away from Tony as soon as possible.  Unfortunately for Tony, the blond didn’t gauge the distance well, or something, and the back of that blond head ended up colliding sharply with Tony’s crotch.
“Well, at least you got hurt first, this time.”  Before he could stop himself, Tony had Steve’s face cradled in his hand.  Steve’s eyes widened in shock and he looked truly baffled for all of two seconds before the glare was back.
“The painting you’re holding, how much? $15,000?” Tony glanced at Pepper who had followed him into the shop, “Is that a lot, too little?”
The blond had been successful in getting away, but then Tony ended up on his knees cupping his abused dick and balls.  The man had hovered around Tony, his hands fluttering while Tony breathed through his teeth.
From the back, Howard let out a low, dangerous growl, practically foaming at the mouth.
Even when they agreed on a show to watch, Tony still felt the need to fight over who had the remote.  Steve finally reached the limit as Tony tried to wiggle his fingers into every crevice of Steve’s body trying to get to the remote Steve had shoved under his shirt in desperation to maintain control over it.  Scarred but surprisingly soft fingertips moved over Steve’s bare abs after the billionaire managed to get his hand under Steve’s shirt and the sensation was so startling that Steve shot out of his seat and threw the remote across the room.  It exited the room through one of the windows with such speed it left only a round hole in the window pane.
“I’m always happy to have you here, Tony.  You don’t need to prove anything to me.”
“Tony Stark!”
“You don’t even need a remote, Tony.” Steve poked Tony in the chest, right over the RT unit.
“Yeah. Go out, get food, maybe get married.”  Tony wasn’t sure where his brain to mouth filter had gone, then again, it’d always been a little faulty.  Steve was openly gaping at him and Tony had a weird thought that Steve’s tongue was attractive.
“What the hell, Steve?”
“You’re old.” She shrugged before sliding his ID through the opening.
to draw a picture for the fic and this was what she gave me!!  It's amazing and I love it!!  Go give her all the love!!
Featuring: Embarrassed Steve, Twitter
“You should have Carol appointed in the interim,” Tony injected, “she’ll probably do such a good job that when the elections come around she’ll win by a landslide. Bonus, then Rhodey will be First-Lady.”
“Your lack of interest or knowledge in who Tony is seems to do you a disservice.  Tony may have done a great deal to garner favor with you in the past but that is the past.  It has been a long time since Tony has bent to your will. I came here because I respect traditions and that you are his father, but I know full well that Tony will marry me because he has already tried to convince me to elope with him.  I told him no in the hopes that we could marry among friends and family. As it seems you have no interest in securing him a future in which he could flourish your judgment holds no value. Tony and I will marry even if it does come to elopement.”
As if to prove the point the TV went mute.
Standing atop the platform in his throne room, Steve surveyed the man in front of him. Steve hadn’t bothered to sit on his throne and instead looked down the length of his nose at the bleeding and beaten werewolf on his hands and knees several steps below him. King Howard stood several yards back, conferring with some of the Northern York pack that had accompanied him to Brooklyn for the Engagement Gala scheduled for the night after next. At least the wolf king appeared just as angry over this turn of events that Steve felt. He’s be sure to have Natasha’s network of spies look into what specifically he was angry about - the failed assassination or the fact his Prime Minister had actually planned to assisinate his son.
“Pep, spice of life and queen of my kingdom, you can find me a good looking replacement chair that doesn’t offend the sensibilities of blind people.”
Tears were building in Tony’s eyes as Steve slid the ring into its place on Tony’s left hand. He realized the anger and fear rolling in him like a dark monster had quieted. In its place was a supreme sense of rightness. For a moment he panicked. Tony had intended to just rattle off the traditional vows but Steve had derailed that. Instead, he took the ring Pepper pressed into his hand and brought it up to Steve’s left ring finger.
“Just for the record, you came into my place of business.”  Steve’s voice was a little rough and he moved his mouth a bit, stretching the muscles in his face as if checking that everything was in place.  “I am not violating the restraining order.”
“Were you really using the remote as a means to flirt with me?”  Steve openly gawked at Tony in disbelief.
The texture of the paint made the woman’s skin supple with just a hint of worn weariness. She had been a working woman who could have easily faded into the blank background of the canvas, but instead she defined every inch of the painting, the lack of paint surrounding her portrait on the cloth seemed to make her more alive. It was as if all the world was defined by her and the realness of her.
“What? That’s not – I mean – Dammit, Pepper, have the damn order removed.  I’m going out for the rest of the day.”  Tony left the conference room to the sound of Pepper’s giddy laughter.
“Of course, please wait in the hall.”  Jarvis ushered Steve inside the mansion and then disappeared down the hallway that lead towards the back of the home.
“Don’t think the remotes goin’ to bite you, bub.”
“Your castle is creepy as fuck,” he blurted.
of the keys of her keyboard seemed loud, especially since there was a thick pane of glass separating them. He’d had to slip the form and ID through a small cut out at the bottom and as far as he could tell that was also the only way sound traveled between the two.  Steve imagined it was very difficult to actually hold necessary conversations with people this way, which was probably why there seemed to be a near shouting match going on at the other windows.
“Who?”
It felt like a physical impossibility to remove his eyes from the blond man but the interruption had caused the man to look away.  Tony jerked his head in the direction of what was now the greatest nuisance of his life. The CEO of NewGen Bionics was barreling towards him and since the whole reason Tony was at a horse stable was to talk about buying the man’s company he really shouldn’t feel so much animosity towards him.
“no scar we became preps bc we realized bein goff is dum and we r gonna fite thanos” they said and both pulled out phones and txted on Instagrandm.  But then I woke up and dere was a super hot goth guy over me and he was soooo hot.

He was wearing ripped black jeans and an mcr tshirt with a ripped leather jacket with bloody letters that said ‘hate life’. He had lots of black eyeliner on 2 express how sad he was. His hair was died black and he grew it kind along so it covered his eye. They were red cos he wore contacts like blood red. Darkness was wearing a big baggy sweatshirt that was black with red rips all over it like he was clawed up by an animal. He had leather pants and lace up combat boots with spikes. His hair was all spiky with blod red tips and he had a lot of white concealer and eyeliner on.

and — okay, so maybe he’s panicking a bit. Just a bit. “Easy on the alcohol, yeah? Don’t want any embarrassing videos being uploaded online! Fury’ll have a conniption!” He adds with a playful wink.
Tony thinks, trying hard not to shudder at the feel of what he thinks is the reptilian flesh of Jarvis’s hand still settled heavily on his shoulder as if in warning.
Still at a loss of how he ended up where he’s currently at, and still unable to see what’s ahead of him, Tony decides to continue walking. He does so at a slow pace, sometimes extending his arms out to balance himself when he starts to get dizzy due to the lack of light, feeling like he’s about to topple over and fall on his ass.
Great. It’s a date. 😉
“How is that being selfish?” Tony protests, sounding a tad incredulous. “I think I’m being self
However, his internal rambling is interrupted by Steve’s next words, and they're a beautiful contrast to the promise and intent in his expression, lips hovering millimeters over Tony’s.
Oh. Sorry.
From Steve’s peripheral vision, Pepper purses her lips, looking amused. Natasha smirks while Thor chuckles, and Clint continues to grin that shit-eating grin.
“Sir, current readings indicate a rapid increase of the heat signature,” the AI states over the comms, tone becoming graver as he adds, “I believe the mothership is approaching.”
This chapter is shorter than usual, and I promise the next one will be longer and will feature more Team Bonding and Tony/Steve interactions. I just want to get this out because
“Screw professionalism, Steve. You can be all Captain Righteous to Fury and the general public for all we care, but that front won’t work with us.”
“Wow. We got all that from me calling him ‘Stark’.”
In this particular case, Tony is her teammate. Hell, he’s become one of her dearest friends after they’ve gone past the clusterfuck that was Tony’s period of self-destructiveness due to the palladium poisoning her spying on him. Yes, the man can be a huge pain in the ass, especially to the people he doesn’t like — cue in the media, Justin Hammer and, on occasion, Fury. But once you’ve gained Tony Stark’s trust and loyalty, you have it for life; and deep down, Natasha counts herself lucky to have Tony’s friendship, even if she chooses not to verbalize her appreciation.
. He’s America’s golden boy. It’s probably why he got the Captain America title in the first place. Maybe. But whatever, that’s a subject Tony will mull over for another time, he’s got priorities right now. Anyway, Steve is Steve, and Tony honestly admits to himself (
“My hero,” Steve deadpans before he plops down on the space left between Tony and Clint. Tony just rolls his eyes, but there’s amusement dancing in his whiskey-colored gaze. Clint, on the other hand, conspicuously eyes said box of orange chicken. He nudges the archer’s shoulder, and when Clint meets his gaze innocently, Steve levels him with a look of his own. “Don’t even think about it.”
to be his fellow comrades, is when they misinterpret Tony’s genuineness for, well, whatever the fuck it is that goes on in their heads. Nothing good, obviously.
If possible, Steve’s frown deepens. “But — but he… Tony was a lot more —”
“Tony,” Steve cuts in, this time inflecting a bit of his Captain America voice. When Tony jerks his head up to meet his solemn eyes in surprise, the super soldier adds, “Is everything okay?”
,” Bruce answers, eyes focused on the table in front of him. It’s clear to everyone that the cogs of his brain are working overtime as he digests the new information that Steve just shared. “In-between
That’s all Tony wants, really. And in the distant part of his overactive mind, he wonders what it would be like to have his defenses peeled off like an onion, layer by layer, each revealing a part of Anthony Edward Stark no other human being has been privy to. That also includes Pepper and Rhodey, the two people who knows him the best among the rest.
Instead of saying something along the lines of ‘Hey, Tony’, Steve ends up making an embarrassing, undignified noise at the back of his throat. Pepper and his teammates, on the other hand, didn’t feel the same struggle the super soldier did.
Natasha blinks in shock. She wasn’t expecting that, either. It takes her a few moments to gather her thoughts before she eventually says in the gentlest tone she can muster considering the state she’s currently in. “Tony, don’t. It’s not your fault, so don’t blame yourself. I know I don’t. Besides, with our line of work something like this was bound to happen.”
Well, he’ll cross that bridge when he gets there.
Steve shakes his head before his lips slowly curve into a smile.
Bruce exhales loudly and Steve feels an ounce of sympathy at the clearly exhausted scientist. After this, the super soldier promises himself to tell his teammate to sleep for at least ten hours.
“Thank you,” Steve utters gratefully, and for the first time since Tony woke up almost two hours ago, he feels the tightening in his chest start to uncoil. The pressing weight is still there, but not as profound compared to earlier, and at least he’s breathing a little better now. Several minutes pass before Steve turns on his side, and he curls into a ball as he softly utters, “Good night, JARVIS.”
He turns around, eyebrows raised in question.
“If I had a physical body, I would be quivering in fear, sir,” JARVIS snarks back.
“So,” Tony begins with a nervous smile at Steve. “This is my gift — not the piano, just so we’re clear — but, uh,
Unbeta'd. Enjoy!
The elevator dings in that moment, signaling that they’ve reached the common area. Before the doors open, Tony takes another deep breath to center himself.
“Hey buddy,” Tony replies half-heartedly. He removes the cap and takes off his glasses before running a hand through his hair. He looks at the camera installed in the corner of the car and shoots a small, apologetic smile. “J…”
whooshes past Clint and into said genius’s outstretched hand.
“Tony—?” he starts, a sinking feeling in his gut.
to count on. You’re family, Tony, and that means we get to help you carry your burdens, too. It, it honestly hurts me to see you like this, not because I pity you and would want to take all your pain away — though I’d do that in a heartbeat if I could — but because you can’t see how much we appreciate and adore you. It’s not the money or the tech, or even the amazing living accommodations you’ve given us — although they’re all amazing and I can’t thank you enough for all of that and more — but it’s
know, that you also have
“I doubt I’ll last a minute, Lightning McQueen,” Tony answers, nonplussed. Thor notes how the genius removes one of the boxing gloves to swipe a hand at the robot. It instantly relaxes its stance as Tony walks to the edge of the ring to guzzle down half the contents of a bottled water. “You have more chance sparring with Steve, though.”
The last text was another Twitter link to a picture of Steve standing at the counter, his back to the rest of the room.  The caption read,
The horse caught Tony’s attention first, but then the rider held it.
A faint tint of red appeared on the apple of Tony’s cheeks and spread in a very attractive manner even as Tony kept his eyes locked to Steve’s in what Steve recognized as defiance.
Tony waived away the rest of the words, vividly aware that tears were running down his face.  Pepper had showed up then and taken over and before Tony realized it his assailant had disappeared.
Several months after finding
“My chair had been squeaking.” Tony blurted.
“What?  Are you not happy to see me?”  Tony rolled onto his back, twisting his long tail out effortlessly. He had pulled himself far enough up the outcropping that the tips didn’t even reach the water. Tony hadn’t missed the way Steve’s eyes tracked the length of red scales and the way they practically glowed with a golden opalescence in the rays of the sun.
Tony did not, in fact, sit down. Not that Rhodey thought he would have. Instead Tony continued to pace the length of the office Rhodey had brought him to as soon as he’d returned from frolicking in Italy. He turned to his best friend and scowled. As his bestie, Rhodey had bestie obligations - like somehow preventing Tony’s life from being ruined - but Rhodey was also a Colonel in the Royal Guard and took his job far more seriously than their college years could have predicted.
Brooklyn Boys Art Gallery kind of looked like any other generic store front with the large glass windows flanking the glass door.  However, the 4 by 4 masterpiece in one of the windows was far from generic.  Tony’s eyes were drawn to the landscape which had an intense red sun baring down and lighting up the otherwise barren snow and ice landscape.  The snow truly looked like it was melting and there was the barest hint of free flowing blue water beneath the ice.  And Tony wasn’t even out of his car yet.
Prompt: Protection
“Sir, I don’t wish to take any more time than is necessary.  I have come here today to ask your permission to marry your son, Anthony.”  Steve watched Howard’s fingers tighten around the glass, going white before he forced them to relax.
Another employee, a man who appeared to be in his late 30s with short blond hair and a thick blond beard, peered around the partition separating him and the woman assisting Steve.  Thanks to his enhanced hearing he was able to catch the man asking, “What’s got you so pissy?”  The young woman didn’t even pause and instead tilted her head slightly in Steve’s direction.  The man looked up and met Steve’s eyes only to say, “oh man, that sucks. I’ll just take my break now, okay?”
Several others “ooo’d” while a few laughed.  Clint flicked a piece of popcorn at him which somehow managed to get stuck in Tony’s hair.
I commissioned the amazing
“There has-”
From behind Steve, Howard cleared his throat. Steve turned, noting Stane’s body was being dragged away before facing the other king.
Steeling himself he pushed the ‘on’ button and watched the obscenely large TV flicker on.  Steve immediately recognized the show as CSI and frowned.  He clicked the channel button only to discover CSI on the next channel - and the next.  He rapidly flicked through several more channels, all showing the exact same episode of CSI.
, Pepper proudly presented Tony with tickets to the opening of an exhibit at one of the numerous galleries dotting the New York landscape. He didn’t make a habit of going to art openings so he was perplexed as he leaned back in his comfy (non-squeaky) office chair, a denial ready to leave his lips the moment she told him to go.
The wistful sigh that left Tony’s lips made him sound suspiciously like he had a teenage crush.  “My favorite artist.  Just thinking I haven’t seen him at any of the events in the past five weeks.  Is that weird for artists?  He made it pretty clear that he’s big into giving back and helping out charities so I would think he’d have been at one of them.”
The room erupted into loud, hooting laughter.
Bucky spotted him and smiled. The smile was genuine and sincere prompting Steve to return it, his shoulders relaxing as the sensation of eyes crawling over him finally stopped. He hugged the other man tightly, glad to the depths of his soul at the sight of his longest friend.
“Strange and Natalia are inside,” Bucky inclined his head toward the closed door behind him.
For a second-time Tony felt his face morph into astonishment.  “What?!”
“Guess what’s trending on twitter.” Tony gave Steve a manic smile, his eyes glinting with glee. Nothing good ever started with that statement.
Tony shook the man’s hand, said something apparently acceptable since the man started talking about the potential sale but Tony found his head turning, his eyes seeking out the blond man – Steve.  His eyes connected with Steve’s blue ones and that frisson of awareness was there again. The CEO was leading him away from the paddock but Tony kept glancing back to Steve right until the moment he disappeared from view.  He noted that not once did Steve take his eyes off him.  Tony knew he’d be going back to that conversation, and hoped it never ended.
“Yes, ma’am.”
Across from him, Rhodey’s dark eyes narrowed, “and don’t worry, the moment I find out who trespassed and got those pictures in Remini I’m going to sic Pepper on them.”
“Well, Steve and I had our own fun to get up too.” Tony saluted the other man with his own cup.
Chapter 2
still smiled - more with her eyes than with her mouth - and she still looked beyond the place over Tony’s right shoulder. She saw something magnificent there and as more time went by Tony felt an excited anticipation of what would be there when he turned around.
Tony’s eyes narrowed in concentration at the other man. “And what are your opinions of my entourage?”
Steve didn’t look away from the remote but did relax back into the cushions of the sofa.
After their fourth date Tony took Steve up to his penthouse to show him where Sarah’s portrait had been hung. Once they’d exited the elevator Tony headed towards the painting only to be stopped by that sense of uncanny he had felt the first time he’d seen the painting. Steve came up behind him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and leaning his chin on Tony's right shoulder.

“no‼” they said  naked in front of everybody but dey didn’t care and had huge things. “dat was a long time ago and we were so sad and missd u so we had sex with eachother and i imagined it was u”
Captain vampire was wearing black shorts with combat boots and ripped red socks and three chokers. His tshirt said MCR 4 LIFE and the long sleeve underneath was bloody and ripped. His hair ws dyed dark purple and he had a lot of purple eyeshadow on to match. He looked sooooo hot.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
When I was a kid I was kicked out of agsrad for being 2 poweerful so I went to tony stark and he told me I could join his avengers and ive been there evr since. I was the firs  one there besides stark bc he created it. He ws a prep at first but then he became goth because I showed him how cool it is. We like to listen to mcf together we go to mcr concerts when were not busy building new tech.
“omh do u have a crush on thanos?” demon and eclipse gasped.

Omg no the weird telepathetic guy changed my clothes into a wedding dress but it was all black and had ripped red lace with no white at all and cool combat boots and spikes. I had lots of eyeliner on and it startd to run down my face supr hot and lots of goffic necklaces and rings and bracelets with bats and upside down crosses on dem and satanic symbols. A priest guy showed up and then…………….. MCR‼‼‼!
Eclipse opened her supr hot red eyes but they weren’t as red as mine dey were kinda pink but not like in a prep way like a dark dark pink purplish bc purple is so %*^$ing btter. She looked @ me.
“ok ready to go” he asked me I nodded “yeah lets go”
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
I ran outside far away from da place wit tears in my eyes. I cried behind a tree and slit my wrists. Everybody was looking 4 me but dey couldn’t fiend me. Except… somebody else fond me. A supr big man wit a big chin and purple skin just like thanos showd up in front of me with a gauntlet just like thanoss but it was black. He was wearing a black robe wit ripped jeans underneth and an mcr tshirt. He was waring a mask. He took off his mask and it was………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..THANOS‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼
DEY WERE TONY AND VAMPIRE TEEMING UP 2 SAVE ME!
“im just too perfect I hate it‼‼” I cried and got out of thors amr “I cant TAKE IT‼‼ im just so perfect it’s a curse I cant take it anymore ists so horrible omg u guys have no idea what it feels like‼! Wheres thanos”
Demon was wearing her long black hair with blonde streaks up in a bun, so kawaii. She had ripped bloody jeans on and combat boots with an mcr sweater and lots of bracelets with spikes. Eclipse was wearing  ripped black tights with fishnets all under and fishnets on her arms with a croptop blood red tshirt and leather shoes. They were both wearing lots of hot eyeliner and pale white foundation.
“If u do not go on this dat with me I will kill you and… KILL TONY AND CAPTAIN VAMPIRE.”
“NOOOO‼!”I screamed.
“guys stop it thanos is on our side he wants 2 get rid of all da prepz don’t u see a univers wit only goths!”
Darkness used to be bruce but then he became hulk and he got super depressed and goth and changed his name 2 darkness. After captain America woke up from his 70 year sleep he was like super goth bc he was depreseed to. But he wasn’t in love wit da stupid prep.
We went to vamps room it was super goth. And that’s when I saw on his wall above his bed in massive red letters with hearts and skulls. It was the name……scarlet von darkheart destructiin rosethrn raven way the third‼‼‼‼!
“hi vamp” I said. That’s my nickname for him bc were close. He was so cute when he blushed and wit his black hair he looked just like gerrard way.
“u were floating in space but somehow u were not dying we don’t know how but we took u in.”he said and I gasped.
“omg thx” I said “anyways how did u find me? What happened?”
Me and tony got redy for da concert super excitedly. i couldn’t wait to mosh super hard 2 mcr wit tony and makeout with hima lot on the stage and maybe we would get 2 see Gerard way and he would hang out wit us after the concert.
The first thing Tony noticed was the horse.  The palomino was a few inches short of 6 feet, it’s golden coat glossy and impressive muscles moved below the skin as the horse pawed at the ground with a front hoof.  Tony watched the giant creature shake its head back and forth, the pale strands of its mane whipping back and forth before a man came up to it.  The horse calmed, seemingly captivated by the blond man offering it some kind of treat.  Tony couldn’t blame it; his own eyes were drawn to the man.  He couldn’t have been more than a couple of inches over five feet and yet his presence demanded Tony’s attention.
“Some would say,” Strange said as he came around Steve’s side and walked over the large table cluttered with books he called a desk, “that what we have to tell you is tantamount to a death sentence.”
He was moving to the shop’s door before he realized he wanted to move. Pepper had been mid-sentence and protested when Tony walked into the small gallery.  The bell above the door jingled sharply and the man with the painting stopped, looking over his shoulder to see who had come in.
“What?”
A chill ran down Tony’s spine. He knew the desert expertly hinted at in the background of the painting. He’d seen the men and women soldiers stand tall under the unrelenting sun. For a second Tony tasted sand in mouth, felt it move along his spine and dig into his fingernails. Tony blinked rapidly, focusing on the other details of the painting. The man’s right arm had excruciating detail, a bruise in the processes of forming while another healed; a cut still red with newness and forearm hairs slightly singed. In comparison the left arm appeared much less formed. It almost seemed slightly off, just slightly out of focus and almost like the lines of it were luminescent.  Looking at the card taped to the wall next to it, Tony noted the title:
Logan came into Steve’s view, one of his rather bushy eyebrows raised and with a brown glass bottle in one hand.
Steve tugged the dark blue cap down lower and hunched his shoulders as if that would make him less conspicuous. He sighed before glancing around and was relieved to see there were only a couple of other customers around. He wandered through the aisles of the drug store before going to the aisle he needed. Steve peeked up and down the aisle to make sure no one was around and then turned to the shelves. The sheer volume of options gave rise to a moment of panic. Tony always took care of the shopping, how was he to know what to get? Steve felt his face heat as he read the descriptions on the boxes. Good lord, there were so many options and sizes. Finally, he grabbed one that seemed promising and then grabbed a nearby bottle. At least he recognized the bottle so he knew what to grab. Now came the hard part. He took his purchases up to the cash register only to realize, to his dismay, that a teenage girl was manning the only check-out line open. Taking a deep breath, he laid his items down on the counter.
The creak of the chair was at first a small idosyncracy. Tony was often on the move and rarely stopped in his office long enough to sit back in his chair so the small sound was an occasional annoyance that took up less time in his mind than simple multiplication did. On one rather inconvenient day, Pepper had managed to trap Tony in his office and direct him to the pile of folders on his desk. Folders! For the life of him he couldn’t figure out why a tech company still used paper anything but he sat in his seat and dutifully started reading. After 2 hours the squeaking of his chair was driving him to distraction and grating on his already annoyed nerves. So when he finally managed to sneak out of the office he told his secretary to get the chair replaced.
“You seem to be without a Prime Minister,” Steve observed. Howard’s eyes flashed in anger as he let out a short snarl.
Steve nervously drummed his fingers on the counter and reminded himself to stay calm.  Government offices were so impersonal it felt strange being in them. He couldn’t help but wonder if he had done something wrong and racked his brain trying to figure out what the issue was. Looking for something to do, since the woman was taking a lot more time to come back then she had implied, Steve pulled out his phone. The first thing he noticed was a bunch of texts from Tony so he opened them to see what was going on.
The summons to present himself to the Council’s Study was unusual enough that Steve didn’t outright dismiss it. If Stephen, Bucky, and Natasha were asking to speak to him there instead of his convocation or even his private study, they must feel discretion was absolutely necessary. Curiosity piqued, he excused himself from the assemblage of citizens seeking help from the crown and sycophants scrounging like rats. As he turned the corner that led to the Council’s Study he waved off the two guards following him and noted Bucky waiting outside the doors.
Title: For Ultra Sensitivity
“I have decided I will assist in you making Brooklyn Castle the beacon of innovation and architecture.”  Tony said triumphantly.  Steve just gave him an endearing grin.
“Huh,” Logan paused with his drink halfway to his lips and eyed the remote with his own suspicion.
The man in question grunted, “I was carrying three corpses.”
“Oh god.” He was never shopping for condoms and lube again. Tony was in charge of shopping for the condoms and lube forever more.
“That’s not a no.”  Tony was proud to point out, his face practically beaming.
in the main room of his penthouse opposite the elevator doors he used to enter the space. In the months since her portrait had hung there, Tony had found himself going home more often. There weren't so many overnights anymore and he’d found himself declining more and more invitations to jet set to private islands and weeks long blow out parties in various cities of Europe. Instead, he’d take the private elevator from his office to his penthouse, walk into the open foyer and look at the portrait.
The first text simply said,
“How much?” Tony said with more force than he had meant.
Reaching out, Steve flicked one of the dried curls on Tony’s head.  “Do not sell yourself short, I know you, you work hard at everything.  From what I saw of your town, you have done wonders with the business since you took over.”
“I just want it structurally sound.”
When Steve handed the form and his New York driver's license to the young woman sitting behind the counter, he had - perhaps naively - thought it was his name that made her eyebrows raise in disbelief. Her deep blue eyes skittered quickly over the form, jumped to him, and then back to the form. She narrowed her eyes and then held up his driver’s license to inspect it. Her eyes shifted back to him and then to her computer screen.  He was expecting some kind of excited realization and maybe a request for an autograph, not a drawn out sigh of annoyance and a glare that would have made Natasha pause in concern.  He really should not have underestimated government employees and the endless bureaucratic bullshit they have to deal with.
“Get the fuck out of the kitchen.”
Relationships: Steve Rogers/Tony Stark

“Let’s wait to speak inside.”
He got his feet under him and made sure he had his balance before standing up completely.  It always took a few seconds to get over the weird sensation of standing on feet, but Tony had been switching between tail and feet practically every other day for the 5 months since Steve moved into the castle, so he was getting used to it. Steve was standing when Tony looked up from his own feet, a fond look on his face as he offered Tony his hand.
He didn’t get that growing up. Howard was either locked up in his workshop, or preoccupied holding out searches for Captain America, or too drunk to even remember he had a fucking kid. And Maria was a textbook mother, only present when she was needed or felt obligated to be there for Tony, but mostly left the responsibilities a mother should shoulder to their hired help. So Tony grew up being raised by Jarvis, the human butler he named after his AI. He doesn’t resent him for that,
, and there’s a huge difference between the two. It’s true that he hides behind a mask 95% of the time, only lowering his defenses when he’s around the people he trusts most in the world. Which isn’t much, to be honest. He has Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, JARVIS, and his bots.
,” Tony reacts vehemently. “How the fuck did you get hit with Mjölnir?!”
Pepper raises an eyebrow at him, obviously seeing through Tony’s haughty expression. “What did you do?”
“Yeah, duh. I did tell you that the party wasn’t the only thing I had planned tonight.”
Tony purses his lips as he considers his next words.
Something twinges in Steve’s chest, and his only response is to rub soothing circles on Tony’s back, one hand moving up to lightly grip his nape in comfort. He feels Tony’s fingers clutching the front of his shirt, and after a while he hears the engineer sniffle against his neck.
Yeah, I had sushi with Nakamura and his entourage. They’re good people, but being stuck in a room with them for ten hours straight is not my idea of spending five days here in Japan.
“It looks like Tony disabled JARVIS before leaving.”
Unsurprisingly, Rhodey is made aware of Tony’s predicament a day after Pepper’s visit, and the colonel’s frustrated shouting is incredibly telling, if the ongoing video call is anything to go by.
Steve breathes out with a sleepy chuckle. "Shut up and sleep now, babe. We'll talk more later."
“This is very unusual,” Bruce begins, brows furrowed in deep thought. Upon seeing Steve’s conflicted expression, he elaborates. “A normal person’s heart rate during sleep is between 40-50bpm. Tony’s heart rate, on the other hand, is at 105bpm.”
to himself. He’s not in denial at all. Well, not anymore, anyway — shut up) that he is completely, madly, desperately in love with the blond man. Has been for the past couple years since they saved New York as The Avengers the very first time.
“Guess I deserve that,” he comments. When his AI doesn’t answer, Tony leans back as his shoulders slump. “I’m sorry, buddy. I didn’t mean to— well no, that’s a lie. I
“Now fast forward to the next day, and thanks to JARVIS’s data — no more chills.”
“Get comfortable,” Steve tells him as they make their way towards the elevator once again. The door swooshes closed behind Steve as he faces his team, but his eyes are trained on Tony’s. “Do as you said by calling out patterns. Let JARVIS handle the rest. I don’t want you to strain yourself, Tony.”
“Yeah? How’s that?” Tony asks gently, but nobody misses the weight of that question.
“J, call Pepper,” he says, picking up a gauntlet and toying with the sensor.
“Good morning, Anthony!” Thor greets with a genuine smile on his face. “How are you today?”
part of a family. For a brief moment, he really thought that he found it in The Avengers. A group of broken people who, for some unknown reason, clicked when they first saved the world together, and decided to live under the same roof. Yeah, he has Pepper and Happy and Rhodey and his bots. He’s their family, too, and Tony loves them all so fucking much. But at the same time, Tony can’t help but be aware of the void in his chest. A void that he’s felt since he was a kid, since Howard destroyed the first prototype he created at age three, since Maria absentmindedly patted his head after he went to her for comfort following a nightmare. It’s an emptiness he’s learned to live with and ignore, but Tony knows it’s just waiting to be filled by something. Or someone. Or
Oh, and for that year, Tony built Steve his own art studio on the 88th floor, a level above the super soldier’s apartment. Not only that, but he also got him a complete set of the best art supplies money can buy. To say that Steve was happy with his gifts (because Tony doesn’t spare
me. That through Thor’s association with me, she
Well, he’s assuming it’s just one phrase.
“Of course it’s happening inside your head, sir. Why should that mean that it’s not real?”
Good God, this man is gonna be the death of him.
“Sir,” Jarvis’ voice interrupts Tony’s current train of thought, bringing the engineer back to the present. “If I may suggest, Miss Potts might be able to aid you in your current predicament.”
Steve thinks as he watches Tony wipe tears of mirth from his dazzling doe eyes,
Yeah. Okay, Pepper would be able to help him out with this. Totally.
“He was.”
“Spluttering like a gold fish is very unbecoming of you, Anthony.”
There’s something about the way the AI spoke that jars something in Steve. Frowning, he turns to look at his teammates, and he’s not surprised to see them with almost the same expressions.
Tony has to physically shake his head to clear his muddled thoughts before he can manage a coherent response.
“I-I don’t — I’m not doing this because of my ‘guilt complex’,” he retaliates, complete with air quotes. Though the tightening in his chest suggests otherwise, and his frown deepens at that. When Natasha doesn’t say anything except to tilt her head and give him That Look — the look that says ‘Really, Cap? Who are you trying to hide the truth from, us or yourself?’ And, well, that really doesn’t sit well with Steve. “I just — I’m doing this to help Tony. To help
“This... is not the coffee pot,” he says dumbly.
“For a genius, you sure can be dumb,” Steve says instead after counting down from ten in French in his head.
“Slumber parties and movie nights?” Clint suggests with a straight face.
“Indeed, Tony,” Thor adds who’s beaming widely at Tony. “In Asgard, warriors are often celebrated for our achievements in defeating our enemies. It is not so different here on Earth. Your valiant efforts deserve to be praised and celebrated, my friend, and my dear hammer agrees.”
“Alright. Okay,” Steve says with a blink. “Alright, er — good luck.”
“St’ve,” Tony slurs, smile widening a fraction. In response, he feels one of Steve’s gloved hands run through his damp hair as dry lips press against his equally damp forehead. “Mmm…”
Steve knows he wasn’t meant to hear it, and it’s only thanks to the serum that he even picked up on it in the first place. So he pretends that he didn’t hear it, but the way his stomach swoops at the compliment shows that he isn’t completely unaffected by Tony’s words.
So here's a lengthy chapter to
Gotta say, red suits you.
, and he doesn’t fight off the smile that spreads across his face. He knows he won’t give this all up without a fight.
“Yeah, you took quite a hit there, Stark,” Clint quips, trying to alleviate the sudden tension in the room. “For a second there, we thought you were a goner.”
“Clear on 35th,” Nat declares with a huff of breath.
“I was
It takes less than a minute before he’s off to dreamland.
It’s only when the elevator doors close and it starts to ascend to Tony’s penthouse that Steve decides to break the silence.

“It feels like a lifetime since that day you first wielded Mjölnir,” Clint remarks with a faraway look. “Man, that was such an epic moment.”
, Tony greets.
They sit in silence for a few minutes, Steve sipping his fruity drink every now and then while Bruce hums tonelessly to Thor’s song choice. Across the room, Clint and Tony are in the middle of taking tequila shots while Natasha is standing beside the karaoke machine, punching in the number for her song choice with a laser-eyed focus which speaks highly of her current inebriated state.
“I have my moments, Captain Rogers.”
— because, and let me quote you,
“Damn it.”
Because it is.
Nobody says anything, even Steve is rendered speechless at the honesty of her answer.
“Hey, J, play that Sam Cooke song next,” Steve hears Tony say next.
“What, uh.” Tony clears his throat. “What did he do? To get better.”
“Bruce,” Tony starts wearily.
1. Chapter titles are taken from the four elements of the Self-Worth Theory. You can read them
Tony is heaving deeply by the end of his impassioned speech, and Steve’s heart is thumping so hard against his chest. His hurt at the genius’s words must’ve shown on his face because as quick as Tony’s temper flared, it dissolved in an instant as shame and remorse warred over his features.
Tony babbles.
Tony shrugs. “I told her she must be talking about Steve because there’s just no way in hell I’m fucking worthy. I mean, it’s logical that Captain America is worthy and not me. Not me.” This time, Bruce frowns. But before he can say anything, Tony continues on. “Then Mjölnir got pissed, I think, because she started vibrating in my hand; said that I’m an idiot for thinking those things. Then she went on this rant about how a person’s worth is not measured by what they can do or what they can accomplish, that if that were the case then a hundred others would be able to lift her aside from Thor. No, she said that she measures worth by their
Bruce shrugs one shoulder, still maintaining (or trying to, he’s no spy like Nat and Clint) that air of casualness as he thinks,
“Yes, Captain?” the AI responds just as quietly.
Tony just stares at him.
, damn it. He’s trying and that should count for something.
And what a mighty feeling it is.
Tony winces slightly at her ‘please tell me you didn’t fuck up’ tone. In a quiet voice, he answers, “Well… I may or may not have purchased a grand piano the other day.”
“What?” Steve squeaks.
Smooth, Stark. That was real fucking smooth.
Five seconds in and then, “Thank you, Miss Potts and Colonel Rhodes.”

“What’re you doing still up, then?” Steve asks, trying to find his footing in the conversation. “I thought you crashed hours ago.”
“I think it was a mistake allowing you to drink milkshake in the middle of the night.”
“Thank
. Throwing all caution to the wind and relying only on the hope that Tony won’t kick him out or, worse, lash out — he slowly takes Tony’s smaller, more calloused hand in his.
Except Tony, though. He looks like he’s in a world of his own, his brown eyes lost in thought as he almost absentmindedly spoons oatmeal into his mouth every thirty seconds or so.
Steve stares back at Tony, pupils dilated and cheeks slightly flushed. Smirking down at him, Steve leans down and presses a lingering kiss on Tony’s cheek.
“I’m not okay, I’m not okay,” Tony belatedly hears himself mutter under his breath like a broken record, his face pressed against Steve’s broad chest. Next, he feels a hand run through his bedraggled hair, and Tony initially thought it was Steve’s, but then he realizes that it’s too small and feminine. Then it dawns on him that it’s Natasha who’s standing on his left, quietly murmuring words of comfort in Russian as she strokes his head in a soothing manner. Her ministrations help subside his quaking body, but it’s Steve’s hold on Tony that helped ground him. He feels Steve’s hands, resting lightly on the middle of his back, grip him a little tighter when Tony utters, “This terrifies me.”
What the hell? That’s so fucking early. Tony’s only had a few hours of sleep before he was rudely woken up by his stomach churning, and he barely made it to his en suite to puke out everything he drank and ate the night before.
Forget his favorite breakfast, he just bore witness to something monumental for fuck’s sake.
being the operative word.
“And his bpm was normal that night, as well as his brain activity,” Bruce finishes. Then he adds after a second, “Well. Then the chills start again the following day, and then there’s the increase of his brain activity at night after that.”
Takes place during the events of Chapter 8 in
It’s apparent that the two are absolutely unaware of Steve’s presence because Peter’s singing along to the song, and Tony?
There’s a brief silence over the comms as they all shudder at the mere thought of Loki being present at the battle today. Yeah, that’s something Tony doesn’t want to happen, thanks very much.
All things considered, that wasn’t the only positive change that occurred in the Tower.
Tony nods and then opens his mouth to blurt out the first word that comes to mind.
The elderly woman isn’t fazed. In fact, she smiles softly at Tony before looking away to look at the view before them.
“Very well, Steve.”
They share a look before they erupt into fits of laughter.
It’s like he said the magic words because Steve blinks and shakes his head. Tony sees his Adam’s apple bob up and down as the blond man swallows a few times. By this point, Tony already got up from his seat and is now standing a few feet away from him.
Tony grins at him, though the physicist sees the vulnerability in his expression, notes how his eyes are bright with repressed emotion, so Bruce opts to squeeze Tony’s shoulder once before letting go and taking a step back.
Steve closes his notebook with a loud snap, giving Clint an annoyed look.
Ah, good ol’ fashioned revenge. Too bad Tony’s a stubborn motherfucker because if he’s going down, then he’s going down with
What is going on?
“Sorry to hear that,” Steve hears himself say. He clears his throat and adds, albeit sheepishly, “Anything I can do to help?”
“I think Thor could be on to something,” he slowly says, his brain quickly catching up to that tidbit of information he overheard Tony make before. Before Bruce can ask, Steve continues. “Remember when we had that discussion a few weeks ago about Tony’s inability to curse?”
“About what?”
. “Tony, what the hell?!”
“I’m just gonna… go,” he belated hears Tony speak. Then, carefully depositing Mjölnir face down beside the coffee machine, the engineer beats a hasty retreat, leaving one very confused — and very shell-shocked — archer.
, and is a human being worthy of deserving good things in his life. And yeah, while he still has his doubts, he’s no longer afraid to face his fears alone. He has been informed constantly these past several months — fuck, make it years, considering Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy have been in his life the longest — that he isn’t alone. That he’s a good man — though that thought’s still a harder pill to swallow — and worthy of having good things. He no longer has to shoulder the weight of the world’s problems on his own should he choose to because he has his team, his
Tony, who’s sitting on the plush couch of his penthouse and bundled up in thick layers of clothing and a woolen blanket, could do nothing except stare at Rhodey with a deer-in-the-headlights expression. The longer he didn’t respond, the deeper Rhodey’s frown gets, and Tony dislikes the guilt that simmers at the pit of his stomach upon realizing that he’s disappointed another important person in his life.
Silence reigns between them, save for the slurping sounds of the pair drinking their milkshakes. And no, it does not become a contest on who can finish their drink first.
“So,” Steve draws out the vowel when Tony doesn’t make a move to touch or lift the war-hammer, even if it’s on top of his tech.
Steve’s jaw is hanging open in shock, and from his peripheral vision he sees Thor and Clint doing the same while Natasha’s lips are pursed into a thin line.
person. He’s not ‘Howard Stark’s son’, or ‘The Merchant of Death’, or even ‘Earth’s Best Defender’. He’s Tony Stark — the genius behind the Iron Man suit, the philanthropist who’s set up funds to help aid the victims of the countries that were targeted by his weapons without his knowing, and the selfless billionaire who’s done nothing but atone for his past mistakes by building better tech to help protect the world.
“We’re not mad, you idiot,” she says with an exasperated sigh. At Tony’s baffled look, Natasha rolls her eyes and adds, “We should be, but we’re not, and we can kinda understand why you’d sneak away like not. But we were more

worked up about it anymore. Hell, the countless times he’s marched down to the genius’s workshop for this sole reason every time they finish a battle has pretty much become routine by this point. So really, if anything, the joke’s on
Tony doesn’t have anything to say to that. Regardless, he still catches the reference, and it leaves him feeling more unsettled than ever.
Steve’s heart skips a beat at the last message, and thank god for privacy because even he can tell he’s sporting a wide, boyish grin right now. The emoji that Tony used doesn’t help either as Steve can easily picture Tony’s brown doe eyes looking wide and pitiful.
Steve looks up from the book he’s been trying to read for the past half hour. He saw it lying on the coffee table and decided to check it out, to see if it’ll help him fall asleep. One glance at the large round clock hanging on the wall to his left shows it’s gone past one in the morning.
Title: And Then I Met You
Howard had dropped into a cushioned arm chair and was waiting expectantly as Jarvis came in and poured a dark liquid from a crystal decanter into a matching glass.  Jarvis presented the glass to Howard who took the drink without looking at his butler. The sharp smell told Steve it was brandy. Steve was not offered a glass.
“Is something wrong?” he asked the young lady when she’d sat back down at her chair.
The blond man gave the retreating figure a resigned look before sighing heavily in Tony’s general direction.  He made his way towards the outcropping and it was all Tony could do to not drool.  The pale blue léine was stretched wonderfully across the man’s shoulders and hung loosely to mid-thigh, but it wasn’t long enough to take away the magnificent view of the way he strode in his tight brown trius.  Tony sighed wistfully, his tail curling up into the air and towards his head.  So entranced was Tony that he hadn’t paid attention to how close his tail fins were to his head and inadvertently slapped himself atop his head.
