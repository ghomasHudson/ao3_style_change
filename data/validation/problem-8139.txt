“Sir?”
“I don’t know that! All I know is that you could get hurt and it could be my fault!” Steve roared back, equally fierce like a lion defending its family. Steve always did have a certain presence about him.
. “I never sent a thing.”
“Hey it’s okay. It was...it was good for me too.” Tony assured, only his eyes were glued to the damp spot around Steve’s half hard erection. Steve was
Steve’s eyes are stormy and a dark blue that screams rage and frustration. There’s also a pinched expression in his face, and he looks seconds away from screaming at him.
He lets the coins fall onto the desk and swipes the bottle by its neck and begins to unscrew the cap.
He wasn’t okay. Not completely. Without the distraction of other marks, the bite on his neck really stung, particularly when he moved his head a certain way. It made him worry, especially with his enhanced healing. He shouldn’t have been able to even notice by this point.
He just didn’t have the energy to talk to Steve right now. He was fine on any other day but he was tired and agitated and didn’t really want to see the man who hated him the most out of everyone. Corridor clashing was one thing but this was too much.
“Sorry I didn’t call first.” Tony smiled widely, hoping to get a smile out of her but it didn’t work. If anything she just looked more tired.
“Gentlemen.” Steve clears his throat. “You know why we’re here.”
No wonder Zeke had reacted like that. He looked like the living definition of a bite fetish.
”Yes you do. I love it when you wear it. Drives me crazy.”
It was rare for him to be at a loss for words.
“Done. Consider it done.” Steve says warmly and gives Tony a hopeful smile. He’s hopeful and maybe...
much?
“Will you wear it for me?” Steve asked quietly, seeking something from him. Tony, for his part just nodded and tried not to lose control again. It was almost impossible, with how pent up his feelings had been.
“Steve?” Nat said quietly, her scent softer now.
Tony was sure his mouth was hanging open. What?
“Yeah, all fine. You?” Carol answered instantly, seeming a little out of breath.
"So when do I get to blow this joint?"
It was the same features he had once had, after all. What he had been chosen for. Ezekiel had a type.
These things always came easy to Steve. He was the type of person who just clicked with people. Like a solid part in well oiled machinery, people took one look at him and loved Steve instantly. Maybe it was the Captain America title, or the looks or the unwavering determination to do the right thing but whatever it was, Steve was good and people loved him.
the papers in the first place!”
It was fine though. He didn’t really care about that. What he did care about was the slow growing realisation that he would probably have to make hundreds of people unemployed. Hundreds of bright young men and women would lose their jobs because of him.
“The role of blood-bringer is no joke Anthony. You know that.”
He felt warm and weirdly faint. Like the world was strangely distant and-
“Of course. Like I said, I’m always looking for potential.” Steve said brightly, tossing a baseball in the air and catching it. His claws dug into the material with each catch. They looked sharper tonight.
“G’bye.” Tony says and begins to walk back-to where, he’s not sure.
“No.”
“About you becoming an Avenger. I’m so glad Nick listened to me.” Pierce explained and it slammed into Tony like a ton of bricks.
And he’d not told anyone other than them about his therapist. Steve was truly the first stranger to know. Which meant he wasn’t a stranger anymore.
“Well, it’s funny you say that...” Tony said, breaking away from Pierce’s gaze to inspect the detail of the plain floor. “Steve and I aren’t...”
“Sir, the commanders com has been disrupted. We can’t hear him.”
Tony glanced at the crowd and searched. He caught a peek of Steve’s blond hair and considered.
The cutlery clattered on his plate. Tony didn’t know what to say. “I-I...I’m not-“ just as he spoke, his phone went off and he scowled and fumbled with pulling it out of his pocket. A message appeared.
They engaged in a fist fight, one hand swooping in after the other. Zeke managed to land a few blows but something in Tony’s veins was giving him an edge. His reactions were that much quicker, and his claws were that much sharper. His heart raced in a way that made his hands tingle.
“I live to serve.”
“No, I know. The mark is very,
Tony hadn’t noticed the way his lips were twitching upwards. He hadn’t noticed the way his eyes didn’t burn anymore. And he didn’t realise his cheeks were brightening at the words. Not until Gabe started to smile back.
“Tony, our promise.” Steve hissed out and seemed to clench his jaw and fists. It was enough to make the sweat run down his back.
“Still, I know you’ll find peace being with them. They will give you all that you need. They’ll be good for you my pet.”
“I do.”
He seemed strong. Powerful. A man with gravitas and so, he really stood out.
He was eating more, laughing more and speaking to others more. Even his therapist was seeing improvement.
Tony opened his eyes and gasped, as did many of the others in the room. One of Whitney’s fangs had eroded. Like some disease that ate at flesh, only it was vampire teeth instead.
Fury raised a brow but didn’t do much else. So Tony sighed and leaned back a little, feeling unsure of how to react. Him and Pierce were definitely not friends so maybe this was just keeping face.
Carefully, he slips his numb fingers into the one, un-torn pocket of his pants and tries to grasp for his Identi-card. The one that says his name and title and the fact that he’s Iron man. With icy fingers, he takes hold of it and pulls it out in front of him.
Blinking his eyes a few times, he tracked the details of the room, suddenly realizing what had happened. His eyes widened when he stared down at the bed.
This was certainly a new one. Tony couldn’t remember the last time he’d been in this position. Or
He wasn’t alone. He was never alone.
Little does he realize, it’s just the beginning.
set him off.
“He’s still in shock. Make sure he has something to drink.” Steve said firmly despite being the one on the table with his stomach bleeding. Tony almost wanted to laugh at the irony.
“Maybe step into the light where I can see you?”
He didn’t get a response so he pushed his arms out and flew up a few metres, enough to see the landing strip of the Helicarrier as a whole. That’s when he spotted Steve and several other agents fighting off the robots. Steve was struggling, Tony could tell and that sent more fear racing through him than the pain.
Tony frowned a little. “But I don’t know you.”
"I'm pretty sure it is." Tony whispered, feeling his face crumple. "I was the one who killed you. It was me. I might as well have pulled the trigger." He choked out and swallowed heavily and looked at Steve with pleading eyes.
“N-no, I’m okay. I’m fine.”
No one hated Captain America. Not even him.
“No.” Steve said firmly, and straightened up giving Tony a hard look. “You can’t go in there.”
Steve’s eyes widened and suddenly his face went completely ashen.
“My therapist says the same!” Tony exclaimed and instantly clamped his mouth shut when he realized what he’d just told Steve. Mortified, he ducked his head to hide how red his face was going.
How was your first day? Tony tried the thought on for size and found he couldn’t really answer. Or rather, he didn’t want to answer. But he was very curious about Steve though.
“Carry on. You’re still half dressed.”
“Hmmm. That dreaded Captain is the worst. He caught a whiff of Whitney even though I told her not to lurk too much. Now she can’t enter that alleyway for some time. What am I to do?” He threw up his hands and huffed.
The warehouse was huge and completely enclosed with no signs of windows or other exits, and there were no building for miles, which Tony had seen himself. There was just trees and dirt and nothing else.
Tony gasped and threw his head back. The heat was searing and Steve's mouth-
Well figures. The man did seem happy to ask him for things these days. And to think he used to resent the days when Steve was quiet enough to blend into the wall.
“C’mon. This evening is about you. I want you to have a good time, so let’s see what we can do.” Steve urged gently and put a hand around his shoulder and steered him to a certain table with two older men in army suits in the corner.
Tony felt absolutely crushed. Nothing could’ve prepared him for the amount of sadness that filled his chest. It was almost as bad as being hit in the middle of a fight. It was like something had taken every ounce of hope he’d had and crushed it.
He didn't say more. He didn't need to. He just knew that Steve understood.
Then he pounced.
“Tony-“
“That’s Ben alright. He’s a bit rough around the edges but you’ll get used to him. Just follow what I tell you, and you’ll be fine.”
mistake
The others are silent around him. They all knew. It’s not a lie.
“What?” Steve frowns and then widens his eyes in horror before grabbing Tony roughly by the shoulders to look at him.
"They did a shit job by the looks of it." Steve says and when Tony looks up, Steve's expression is bleak.
“I know you’re trying to do what’s right. But this can’t be it. You have to see that.” Steve implored and reached out to clasp Tony’s hand. “You know I’m right.”
“The press? You hate the press.”
Tony opened his eyes slowly, feeling his eyes focus and his fangs expand. He was right in front of him. This broad shouldered shadow who would soon be his next victim.
It really hits him then. Almost like a physical blow to the stomach.
“Captain America. I know it’s hard for you to understand with your forties sensitivities but some of us like to have fun-“
Given Steve a reason to think he’s better than he is. Because Tony knows he’s not.
Steve was still staring at him. His expression was carefully blank, like a mask.
? Is that a nickname?”
He freezes. His breath stills. His mouth falls open as his eyes go wide.
Tony’s eyes flickered, just for a second. Then he started to take a step back but his body seemed to shake at the resistance. But that wasn’t a problem because Steve had thought of that too. He’d thought of everything he could.
Steve still wouldn’t face him.
He remembered turning, seeing the world through the helmet and scanning as best as he could for something he was scared to see. For what he’d find.
“Boys.” He commanded and lifted his hands up with a wave. “There’s plenty more. Come on-“
"Steve?"
“You’re okay, Tony. Take deep breaths.” He heard Steve say and carefully did as he was told, trying not to throw up as the others stared at him with growing concern.
“We’re all here Trish. Don’t think anyone’s still asleep.” Ben supplied helpfully and suddenly it clicked.
Still, something inside Tony loosened a little. Like a wire unwinding. A door opening and revealing a glimmer of light. He could feel something relaxing in him.
Grant had seen them once find something. Only once, in the distance. Some humanoid creature that had stood on two legs like him, and had seemed to hold his hands up and freeze under the blinking lights.
“Hey, little one. Are you excited? We can’t wait to meet you.” Steve says softly and Tony can’t help but giggle a little at the drastic change. Especially when the baby kicks and Steve gasps again.
Pulling out a few keys, he opened the front door and gestured for Tony to walk in.
Tony didn’t smile. He felt like he’d break if he tried.
“Why do you call Steve
Tony dropped his hand and nodded to himself. “Right.”
He nodded sympathetically. “Nightmares.”
“Oh, Steve...” Tony whispered, suddenly realizing Steve was crying.
After showering, shaving and brushing his teeth, he secured his gear and sauntered through the sleeping area and straight into the living quarters.
The woman smiled kindly once more and closed the door behind her with a soft click, giving Tony an idea of how to reinforce the door. Perhaps he could tweek the locks so that-
Steve had...
“My lord. Say it.” Zeke interrupted. His expression was carefully smooth but something flashed in his eyes.
“To him you’ll always be better.” Reed says and pauses, turning to look at Steve with a sad gaze.
“It’s not a full moon yet. Shame.”
"But you. Don't. Work. For
“They won’t.” Steve promised, not blinking even once when the sun set.
“Right. Look, I don’t know what to do here. You asked me to see you and I’ve come. If we fight, I’m just making it clear that I didn’t ask for it. You did.” Tony narrowed his eyes and folded his arms. “Don’t blame me for that. And the memories-“
“Oh please. You’ll always be Captain America. That’s just who you are.” Tony rolled his eyes fondly and shifted on his feet, feeling lighter all of a sudden. “You swoop in with your plan and rescue the poor victim and everyone hails Captain America, the paragon of justice for being a hero. It’s just how it is.”
“Everything okay?” Tony said quietly and Steve’s eyes quickly flicked back to him.
“Commander. Your notes.” Tony said quietly and placed the small pile of paper on the desk beside Steve with a soft thump. It seemed to do the trick as the flames disappeared in Steve’s eyes.
Tony had been important to him. And he’d thought it was mutual.
“Tony, no, c’mon. Don’t do this to me-“
“Anthony Stark right? Iron man?” He asked and suddenly Tony felt like he was back in the spotlight. Like a radio tuning back in, or a TV show without the fuzz.
“Then why?” Steve turned and looked at him with a wounded expression. “Why are you saying that?”
“Wait!” Steve said sharply and grabbed Tony’s wrist before he could move any further. The minute he did, he felt Tony bristle. But Tony didn’t look at him.
“Tony.” Ty implores and bends closer. “You should’ve told me you were pregnant.”
“What did he do?” Because he’d never actually asked.
Ben was a lean young man with dark hair and an insecurity complex a mile long. With every turn of the corridor, he’d make some new point about the importance of his work in the labs, and how every member had to do their part and each and every one of them was incredibly intelligent and capable. The future, of course.
Anger bubbled in his chest. And so did another emotion that Tony was all too familiar with. For once, it wasn’t for him.
Steve never gives up on him. It’s more than he deserves and everything he wants.
Still, he hopes Steve and the others are warm and safe. He hopes they’re together and celebrating Christmas with all the little things families do. He wonders if they're gathering around a table with warm food and plenty of smiles and maybe there’s even eggnog and-
He was in shock. That was the best way he could describe how he felt.
He takes a deep breath. Inhale. Exhale.
“No, that’s okay. You’ve been a great host Steve, really.” Tony held up a hand and tentatively rested it on the table beside Steve’s joint ones.
He didn’t care. What did it matter?
"It's down! They're falling!"
The deep blue eyes blinked back at him as Stark laughed.
"I promise." Tony smiled and shifted a little under Steve's heated gaze. "I'm all yours commander."
“What?”
But what were they looking for?
“And of course, sweetheart, you must appease me. I deserve that much, don’t I?” She purred, one hand snaking up to tug her collar down.
Nodding, Tony stood and looked around carefully. Then the idea came to him.
“C’n you g’ve it to them?” He slurs and makes to stand up from the bench. He feels it’s important and he knows that it’s better to trust someone else with the task than himself. Plus, there’s something about this stranger that he trusts.
“You’re so perfect and yet I don’t think you see it.”
“That’s right. As soon as we get home. You’re going to show me.” Steve said and narrowed his eyes at him like he was the target. “And prove to me that we’re soulmates.”
“Tony, it’s not a bad thing to have a soulmate. It’s an amazing thing, a gift.” Steve implored and took a deep breath. “Aren’t you excited to meet yours one day? The thought that there’s someone there for you no matter what?”
That was another thing. Sometimes his mind drifted to happier thoughts. Like the days when he was part of the team and no one even knew. When Tony Stark had been little more than a landlord and Ironman had been a growing beacon of hope.
When he had been...when he had gone, Pepper had told him he had been distraught. Apparently he had been so bad that-
“Just do as I do.” Steve smiled, but still wouldn’t look Tony’s way.
He can’t go back. He knows they would say he should but he can’t. They wouldn’t understand.
“...Something wrong?” Mr. Stark asked hesitantly having paused to watch Steve distort some fruits.
The mansion can’t be far. He’s spent the whole night walking and this blizzard is getting worse. His body is getting to knee deep levels in the snow and there’s not a person in sight for miles.
"You don't know what I feel." Tony chuckled softly, rubbing at his eyes again. They ached by this point but he was slowly getting used to it. Much like everything else. "And he already told me there's no going back."
“It’s a good deal. I go with him and the company is-“
Delighted, Tony cleared his throat and broke through the chatter. Carefully, he snuck into the crowd and pushed towards the front, standing just behind the twins. “Norman. Father wants you.”
“I’m okay.” Tony said quietly, lifting his lips to a small smile. “Really, I am. Thank you for...for asking though.” And he truly meant it. Somehow, he’d felt lost but at least he wasn’t totally ignored. It was nice that someone took a moment to ask him if he was okay, even if he didn’t need it.
(Or hoped).
“Definitely.” Tony said firmly, feeling the response come out like steel.
Steve stopped and took a breath. Tony stared at him with wide eyes.
“Sure Cap. Take your stupid restaurant. Just make sure you don’t leave it in a mess.”
“I just don’t get it! What is it about Stark that makes you work for him!?”
“When Mr. Stark was director of Shield there was a lot of responsibility put on his shoulders over a very short period of time. And after what had happened to you sir, he was under an immense amount of stress. I can only imagine- “
“What’s your issue with Ty?” Tony narrows his eyes at him. “You worried he’s gonna be the one I choose?”
“Oh they’re here Tony. Don’t worry about that.”
It was like the sun had risen in Tony’s eyes. His smile was breathtaking and his eyes twinkled with such happiness at the words. There was so much in his gaze that Steve couldn’t even begin to understand.
Finally he’d walked away.
The shop-keeper-a brown haired, pudgy looking man-just scowls at him. He wrinkles his nose and tilts his chin up.
“Oh?”
Reed turns to leave. Steve doesn’t stop him but the question remains unanswered, so Steve does leave a few parting words.
“I...I do. Really.”
“I can’t believe it.” Tony said faintly, but felt his lips curve into a huge smile when he felt Steve press a kiss to his hair gently. "I have a mark."
“Let me get you a drink. This is meant to be a party, so we should enjoy ourselves at least.”
“Hey.”
"Are you alright?" She asked quietly, and ducked her head down slightly. "I hear you've taken a leave of absence from the team."
“Tony.” Rogers smiles and rubs his back gently. “It’ll be alright.”
“No, I mean-“ Steve shook his head and sucked in a sharp breath. “I didn’t want this, you have to know that.”
“I lost you once in that fire. I made a mistake by letting you go. I’m not doing it again.”
Steve didn’t answer instantly. Instead he seemed to be debating over what to say. Finally he decided.
Tony’s heart soared and equally, it ached. He already missed having that gaze directed at him, not to mention this new nickname.
Tony blinked and pulled his gaze away from Maria. “What?”
It was funny how, before if Tony had heard that, he would’ve called Steve a savage, and maybe made some dig at wolves in general, unable to see the difference between Steve and Zeke. Now, Tony could tell it was different. They were completely different because while this gesture seemed brutal, Tony felt pleased to think Steve could go to such lengths to care about someone.
Feeling almost stunned for a moment, Steve kept quiet and waited. He didn’t dare stop Tony from speaking now.
He bit his lip and flicked his eyes up at Steve. “Thanks.”
“Hey Steve?”
Just as he approached, he saw the giant claw of the huge robot reach up and aim to crush Steve to the ground. Tony doubled his speed.
There is a happy ending, I promise.
He wasn’t wearing clothes so he could see everything. And he’d found nothing in bed. But in this light, patches of his body were a slight shade of pink-a stark contrast to his ghost white complexion. When he stared into the reflection, his fingers slowly unraveled from his bite.
“That is my son, Rogers! And that is my omega! You won’t take them from me, they belong to-“
“Well.” Steve said and folded his arms too. “I hated seeing you like that too. If I wanted a submissive omega Tony, I wouldn’t pursue you.”
" He repeated through grit teeth and tightened his grip on the Shield strap as he stepped closer.
"You should stay here. I'm serious Tony." He insisted, ignoring Tony's wide eyes. "It's better. You get to relax in your own space and I get to keep an eye on you and make sure you're okay."
He really was awful.
It was only on the drive home that Tony realized he’d completely forgotten to ask Fury about the dress code. Huffing to himself, he waited for Happy to finish pulling up outside the tower and charged straight towards the elevator. Jarvis had him moving within seconds.
What the man under the armor wore. What he did and had. Clues were there, Steve was so close to him and if only he could know-
“I don’t know what any of you are talking about.” Tony snarked, looking down at his cuff links again. Under the light of the ballroom, they looked even more prominent.
“The doors’ there.” Tony said instead, jerking a thumb at the glass door behind him. “I can leave if you prefer. Just say the word.”
Throughout it all, Steve had listened with laser-sharp focus, his concern growing with every second. He’d wanted to speak and hold Tony every time he mentioned Whitney’s threats but thankfully Steve had managed to keep still and listen at Tony’s request. After hours of listening, he had simply gotten up with a calm look on his face and left, explaining that he needed to talk to his friends. Tony hadn’t ever heard him sound like that. He sounded like a general, or an army officer. A commander.
It clicked into place. Captain America and his infamous Harley Davidson. Steve didn’t go anywhere without it.
And of course, she’d used every spare moment of her busy schedule to make his life a living hell. Not once would an hour go by that she wouldn’t remind him of what she’d do to him once he was hers.
Suppressing a shudder, Tony pulled back his lips into a smile, letting his fangs show. “I don’t know what you mean. I am loyal to our lord, Whitney. I would never go against his wishes.”
“You get everything you needed from Fury?” Steve sounded gruff, like a frog was stuck in his throat. His cheeks were perfectly flushed and Tony could just picture him running now-strong body and powerful muscles working in sync to-
"You...You...had feelings for me."
“How did this even happen!?” Tony gasped, letting go of the rings and dropping his head in both hands, starting to feel a little giddy. Hysterical.
The air left his lungs and he gripped the seat of his chair tightly to keep from jumping up. It was hard enough, he couldn’t keep his heart still around Steve, but this-
They stayed like that for a while. Tony didn’t move and Steve got the feeling Tony had finally passed out again from exhaustion. It was only when the others returned and pulled him away that he was able to let Tony go. While his hands released him, he couldn’t look away, even when Dr. Strange was taking Tony’s vitals and the others were crowding him.
A strange urge to comfort Steve appeared and for once, Tony didn’t stop it. “Well it’s no big deal. We all have our vices.”
“But...” Tony tried to form the words but they didn’t budge. What was the idea behind taking him along? Any of the others would’ve been better suited, he just knew it.
“Uh, hi? My names’-“
"Tony? Is that you?"
“You’re dead wrong. That’s not even close to what I’m like, and if you think I-“
He’s changed. He has
The man wasn’t doing much. He seemed to be massaging at a headache. His fingers rubbed his head gently so Tony figured he was a stresser.
“Thanks.” Tony mumbled, almost jerking back when Steve held a knife and fork out for him to take. Grateful, he took the cutlery cautiously and began to eat the food. At the first bite, he moaned deeply.
Carol's eyes were wide. She was shaking her head and mouthing
He wasn’t wrong.
And fuck, did Tony want to tell him, he did but-
Happy drives the three of them back to the tower. Tony sits in the middle with his arms tucked around his belly, while Rogers and Ty flank his sides. They glare at each other all the way back.
“No.”
After what felt like years, there was a beep and the doors slid open. Maria held out her hand and gestured.
"Uniform's coming off, Tony." Steve breathed into his skin and before Tony could do more, Steve gripped the zipper at the hollow of his neck and pulled down sharply.
Then it hit him. Steve wanted forgiveness. He'd also been suffering. Maybe he'd also been drowning in the guilt that Tony had been in. Maybe they should've talked earlier.
“Oh, by the way.” Steve suddenly beamed, showing all teeth, and pulled Tony close by the waist. “Have you met my mate? He’s gorgeous isn’t he? An absolute charmer.”
Steve’s voice cut his thoughts. “You’re a lot more quiet than people say.”
Steve winces when they do.
Maybe it should bother him more than it does.
Maybe one of them had seen it coming too.
“I’ve known it’s you from the start. When you woke up after the Chitauri fight and I saw your arc reactor. Thor saw too.” Steve said calmly, keeping still in a false show of control. “I know. And I have so many feelings for you. More than you could imagine.”
“Oh Tony. Come.” Zeke beckoned him towards the bed and patted the edge. “You sit and I’ll have a look.”
“No. It’s stupid. The don’t avenge the undead. They avenge humans.”
Tony shrugged and held up his palms above his head, watching them shake.
“Thank you all for coming! I want to invite you all now to come eat, dance and enjoy. Thank you all for attending the evening!” President Ford said. The room gave their applause, signalling the end of the speech. Tony was sad to feel Steve’s hand pull away. But that was that.
“...I guess you’re right.” Steve heard but somehow he thought Iron man sounded resigned. Probably because he knew he was right.
Warmth bloomed in Tony’s chest. Even though he was completely stunned, a part of him couldn’t stop smiling, especially when his eyes drifted to their hands.
“Steve...” Tony’s mouth fell open, eyes growing wider as he shifted the bag and realized what he was holding. His head whipped up and he gaped at Steve.
"What does she mean by that?"
“Here, please sit Tony.”
“Oh yeah! Coconut and iron he said. His Ironman or something.”
While Pierce tried to get the bartender's attention, Tony scanned the crowd vacantly. He thought he noticed Fury staring at him with a deep frown on his face. Calmly, he smiled back and nodded.
“Then time went on. The war ended and some of us moved away. And we saw something on the screens. This billionaire gets kidnapped. This man in a metal suit is saving New York,
Also, the deliberate use of his last name. Since that hadn’t hurt. Ouch.
Plus he was distracted. A bad combination, he knew.
But he couldn’t. Because it wouldn’t change a damn thing. Steve didn’t deserve to be burdened with that.
"Go on. My home's yours."
“I know you know what I’m talking about.” Steve carried on and pushed himself up on his elbows to look Tony in the eye. “This thing? This thing we have between us? It’s more. We have something more.”
“So you got my call.” Steve tilted his head. “Do you know why I called you in?”
“No. Not yet.” Tony says lightly, tilting his head in that fond way he does. Steve’s heart eases a little at the sight and relaxes even more when Tony carries on.
"Yes Hill. Agent Stark seemed to think it was a good idea to
“I meant for you. It’s not fair to you.”
“Just relax.”
"He didn't tell you because it would've made you an even bigger target. And from what he tells me, you were in no condition to defend yourself. He's already fought off several threats against you." Steve says and clears his throat, stepping even closer.
Tony lives a half life here on the Helicarrier. It’s dark and dreary and lonely in a way he hadn’t imagined. He’d always been on a separate plane to others but now he feels even further from reality than before. Before, he was disliked. Now he is hated.
Moving sluggishly through the snow, he drops beside one of the bags and huddles in.
He sees Steve in everything. He sees his happiness, his smile, his sharp mind and calm persona in everything. He even sees that unbelievably strong sense of justice that Steve used to have.
“You think so?” She said with such hope and bleakly, he pictured himself in her shoes.
It had taken far too long to gain an audience with the right crowd and essentially it had come down desperate measures. Steve had planned his negotiations with T’Challa and Everett Ross thoroughly but of course, the resistance had blown their first attempt in a matter of hours. And by that time, Tony had already gone into pre-heat.
They were silver with a small black star in the center. And coming out of the star were two concentric circles. Very sleek, very subtle and
“I found him.” He choked, feeling the stunned silence he got in return. “I f-found him.”
“Obviously I would. You need all the help you can get.” She said and Tony laughed when she glared at his suitcase in mild rage.
But there’s something empty in it. Like his heart isn’t in it.
“Pregnant!?” Rogers shrieks and stares at Ty like he’s gone mad. “Are you serious!?”
“You sure they’re after me?” Tony covered his hand over the mic and dipped his face down. “I’d hate to disappoint them you know.”
"You know how you can make me happy?" Steve said quietly, and Tony glanced at him. "By keeping yourself safe. And looking after yourself. And not putting yourself in danger. It breaks me to see you get hurt. Every time."
“Yup, just like old times!”
“Then why am I a full time superhero? I thought I was a consultant?”
An image began to form in his head. Surely Steve didn’t really think...
Steve paused and looked up at him with a carefully blank expression, but somehow Tony wondered if maybe Steve was laughing at him. “You okay?”
“I couldn’t find Rogers.” He said with a distinctly irritated expression and leaned over to take both glasses of water from the bartender before Tony could even turn back. “And since I can’t find him, I can’t ask him what the hell he did. So that leaves you.”
"You must
“Shhh. You’re okay.” Another kiss, this time on his forehead. “Sleep now. You need the rest.”
“It’s okay.” Steve murmured, looking at Tony’s pale face. “He’ll be okay.”
Tony loved him. And he’d never see him again.
He doesn’t of course. It’s hardly his place to.
But Steve wasn't fire, or pain or something forbidden anymore. Steve was here with him, and he could feel everything, from the hot press of Steve's lips against his skin, to the scorching heat of Steve's hands as they pressed into his skin.
Steve looked up sharply at that. “What do you mean?”
“Well that’s definitely something I can help with.” Tony winked. “It’s been a while since I’ve come up with designs from scratch.”
This carried on for a short while. Slowly Tony felt his muscles start to loosen and his shakes start to decrease. He felt weak and a little light-headed, but no where near as bad as he was before. His thoughts still felt muzzled but at least he could sit up and think.
“Grant.”
"You did good! In fact, I'd say better than good." Steve smiled, and somehow he was only a few feet away and walking towards him.
“I’m changing tailors.” Steve said with a grumble, expression turning stormier by the second. Not that Tony had a clue why.
“Marks don’t just come and go.” Tony scowled and folded his arms to hide how much they were shaking. “They just go. Simple as.”
He could pick out the key differences from Steve easily. Jeremy’s hair was a shade darker than Steve’s, a much nicer blond with way less bright yellow. Sometimes Steve’s hair would look like a buttercup in the mornings. The light would catch it and remind Tony of fields or something. Ridiculous.
The compound wasn’t the same. After Siberia, he’d been told to rest by multiple doctors and so, he’d skulked in the compound, wandering aimlessly around rooms that carried distant memories.
"I'm fine. Stomach ache." Tony croaked but still tried to smile when they searched his face.
“My boyfriend.” Tony sighed and scrubbed at his eyes tiredly, swiping away the rain and anything else he didn't want to think about. At least the rain was easing up a little. “He, ah. He left me here.”
Steve turned away from his napkin and looked at him like he knew he was being watched and tilted his head curiously. Then he let go of the napkin and slowly reached for Tony’s hand again.
Pierce looked at him carefully. Then his smile dropped completely and he lowered his chin. “Ah. I’m sorry, I thought you were aware.”
Tony thought to himself, feeling his stomach turn with each twist in the corridor. At last they reached Zeke’s door.
. And at night, he felt like he was dissociating. He couldn’t stop dreaming about Steve and the team and what he read about the SHRA and the broadcast he’d watched of Norman beating him to a pulp before his coma. His thoughts felt somewhat disjointed and fragmented and sometimes he wondered if this was what he’d been like before.
“Isn’t he perfect? A perfect pet for us. And when we bond him, we’ll have that sweet gaze turned our way. Wouldn’t that be lovely?” She purred and finally the realization hit.
, nods tensely and steps forward like a man treading through snow. He walks slowly and carefully but reveals himself in the light completely for Tony to see.
He turned and met the blue eyes through the Iron man armor and smiled. The man was clearly stunned.
Just as he was about to turn though, something stopped him. His eyes shifted back and stared.
“Yeah.” Tony whispered as he watched them all gather their plates quickly and leave without sparing him a glance. “I’d hate me too.”
“I prefer to think of myself as an opportunist. I hear machines are mister Stark’s special interest.”
The watch was a Breitling; a silver chain strap that hugged the wrist while the clock face was set against a sapphire blue reflective surface. The dial was fairly big but overall it matched the blue and silver theme Tony was going with. It looked really nice and as Tony took off his Rolex and slid this one on, he wondered just how much thought Steve had put into this. It must've cost a fortune.
“How come he’s here? He’s the worst one.”
"I know. I know how they all feel about me. I guess this is his way of setting me straight." He said, feeling empty. Anyone could take a shot at him right now, he wouldn't care. Anything was better than feeling like this.
“Good. Eat up. If you want more, I’ll make it, just say the word.” Steve sounded pleased behind him, even though when Tony twisted around, he was still just as tight-lipped as ever. There was something more...warm about him though.
And now he was offering Tony a ride.
This was so different. It was so much better than he could've ever imagined as nothing could've prepared him for the sheer tenderness Steve would have when he touched him. His hands continued to slide down, and slowly, Steve sat up and wrapped his hands around Tony's calves, taking his time to undo the straps and zips of his boots and slide them off, giving his shins a gentle squeeze before lowering his legs back to the bed and leaning over him again. This time his hands framed Tony's neck and he guided them into another slow sweet kiss.
Now it was the opposite issue. He knew Steve too well, so well that he would do anything to spend time with him, which was exactly why he couldn’t. This wasn’t some reward for good behavior, and it wasn’t some second chance. He’d run out of those.
Not trusting himself to speak, Tony shook his head silently, not taking his eyes off Steve.
“Well I’m not going to wait much longer. I think we’re at the point where we can consider bonding. I just don’t want to make him uncomfortable.”
“He’s not wrong Steve.”
“Take me with you.” Tony demanded and Steve stared at him like he’d grown two extra hands. Even Maria was stunned.
“Cap...m’ I dreaming?” The words were whispered and Tony’s eyes slowly shifted from Steve to the ceiling behind him. “Wh’re am I?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Stark. What the hell are you doing here?" He heard, and closed his eyes and smiled.
Fury paused. His eye met Tony’s. Without blinking, he spoke.
"I love you Steve."
Steve looked like he was barely containing a laugh. A slow grin spread across his face and he leaned closer. Instead of feeling crowded, Tony felt so warm and subtly he shifted closer to Steve.
“That’s Sharon you’re talking about!” Tony insisted and felt for all the world like he was screaming into a void. Did no one see? It was so obvious, how had
“Good.” Steve murmured and pulled back, reaching to open the door. “I’ll get out first.”
All at once, Steve's expression grew sad. But not surprised.
“There’s no where else for me to go really. And it’s not so bad, I get to do-“
Tony reached up and grabbed Steve’s hand, feeling his body start to go hot under the touch. He felt his breathing start to pick up and his blood start to heat something deep within him until it was going lower-and lower and lower-
That alarmed Tony. How could anyone track Zeke? The bastard was so tricky, he’d once slaughtered an entire gremlin family without being noticed.
“I suspected something like that. When I first met you.” Steve interrupted him, just as he was leaning a passed out human against the wall.
“It doesn’t need to be fancy.” Tony insisted before he could think, and instantly wanted to cringe at how pathetic that sounded. But at least they would be more likely to-
“You’re Ironman. A symbol. Granted it’s a dying symbol but I feel we can still make use of that. Why, I even think we could-“
Nat leaned forward too. “Agreed.” And Clint nodded, while Bruce and Thor shrugged and smiled.
“Right, I’m coming.” Tony said quickly and stepped out of the lift to follow the sharp heels of the assistant. A frown appeared on his face when he realised she wasn’t even stopping to hold the glass doors open. By the third door, he quickly realised she didn’t like him, much like the reception staff and guards at the front hadn’t.
So naturally, he’d stormed his way to the Commander’s office and barged in without pause, making both Steve and Maria look up sharply.
Tony had never felt more alone than he did now. And here he was with a man that belonged to someone else. They were all wrong.
Steve’s entire body morphed, his eyes glowing a bright gold as his nose shifted and grew, and dark grey hair appeared all over his body as he expanded. His lips pulled back into a snarl as his teeth became sharper and his long sleeved clothes tore into pieces to reveal the strange uniform he’d seen Steve in many times. His claws elongated and limbs doubled in size.
Tony smiled slightly. “Vampires feast on human blood. I’m sure spiders aren’t any worse. Who am I to judge?”
restaurant, I’ll have you know. And I won’t have Steve coming in here and trying to steal it!”
“What?” Steve sounded more awake this time and when Tony finished tightening his leather braces of the under armor, he caught Steve’s concerned look.
really. Normally he was the one standing in Steve’s shoes, not the other way round. After all, he was the billionaire, as so many people loved to remind him.
“Don’t move. I don’t wanna drop you when I jump.” He said and suddenly they were in the air.
They reached lower Manhattan. The buildings blurred around him. He dashed past humans and creatures alike, too fast to even be seen.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That kind of sounds like a mating bite. If you’re compatible with another wolf or human and bite them, you become bonded to them and vice-versa. Is it like that for vampires?”
“What’s a Winghead?”
Whitney was back. He hadn’t seen her in two whole weeks. They’d easily been the best two weeks of his life in this cavern.
Steve heart ached with sympathy. It wasn’t fair that Tony was on this bed, writhing in pain because of his body being wired this way. It wasn’t fair that Tony Stark had to be reduced from something so dynamic and untouchable, a man brighter than the sun to-
The door hissed open as the scanner beeped to acknowledge the newcomers. A large group began to file in, similar to schools during recess. Ben and about five others were leading the pack, with the rest being scientists.
But today isn’t the day to ask about it. He knows they’re not seeing each other due to the monitoring so it’s not a concern right now.
There was something dark in her eyes. Wounded and tired and scared.
“No, stay.” Steve said firmly, assuming his Captain America role, and dropped his shield on the floor to get some water. Filling up a glass, he took the whiskey out of Stark’s hand and slipped the water in, instead.
Steve remembered flames. And a building and fire. Not from the motel in his dream but another one. With multiple floors and rows of glass. He’d been in a fight.
"I love you too." Steve said with a fierceness that almost surprised Tony.
“‘Kay.”
“He’s anemic. And quite badly by the looks of it. He’s lost weight and he doesn’t really have the same muscle tone as when he first came in. Not to mention, he’s exhibiting signs of long-term exhaustion and stress and dehydration.” The doctor said and glanced at him briefly. “He’s awake.”
“Actually make that two please.”
Feeling almost distant, he forced a smile that splintered at the edges. “What’s that you’ve got? Someone you’re trying to impress?”
Sometimes it's enough to pull you from the brink.
Staying out this late would be a mistake. When he returned, Zeke would flip and Whitney would laugh. He’d get punished but then again, when was that any different to what he always dealt with? The bonding would be the worst punishment imaginable.
He got the feeling he was silently being laughed at. When he looked up, Peter’s eyes were sparkling.
"Tony stop." Steve holds up a hand and it sounds like he's hurt. "I know-"
He had to get out. He had to leave before-
But the webs had to have come from somewhere. He didn’t look like an arachnid and neither did the police but maybe...
Tony snapped his mouth shut and jerked his head up in shock.
“You never revealed who the father was to me. You only just found out.”
It’s meant to be a celebration. It’s meant to be a good thing.
All the bright lights were making his head swim. Not too much but enough to make him want to sit down for a moment. He didn’t realise he was starting to sway a little until hands gripped him from behind.
In the image, Steve is smiling at Tony. In the image, Steve loves him.
He took a deep breath and smiled.
“What?” Tony laughed nervously, feeling just a little self conscious. Had he stepped on a mind-field without realizing it?
“Yes?” Steve asks tentatively.
Steve scoffs at that. “Stop it. You need to come out of there and explain yourself.”
“Mmmm. Oh my god, this is so good.” He licked the fork and bit into more of the bacon. It was perfect and he'd been
“You shouldn’t push me out. I know you’re going after the robot lead, I can help you-“
He closed his eyes and sent a final apology to Steve, somehow feeling like a part of him deserved this.
It felt like his whole body was on fire. Distantly he registered Whitney saying something, but he couldn’t hear it over the loud ringing in his ears.
Tony thought Zeke looked distracted. But he didn’t dare comment. “It was good. I laid the claim and didn’t speak to anyone. It was fine.”
He turned to Tony and yelled.
“What?”
No one was laughing now.
“Stop it!” Tony shouts, feeling his panic rise as the air grows tense with the harsh punishing scent of alphas in rage. They are nose-to-nose, barely containing growls in each other’s faces. It’s everything Tony has ever dreamed off but at the same time, terrifies him to his core.
“Why does he think that?” Steve asked carefully and somehow they’d reached the car and Steve was opening the door and guiding him into the passenger seat. Once he was settled, Steve came around to the driver seat and sat down, slamming the door shut and cranking the heating right up. Heat started to flood the car like a sauna.
“Hmm good. That smells so good.” Tony sighs and closes his eyes for a moment, just enjoying the softness of the material around him and the scent of Steve.
He wants to tell Steve he doesn’t think he’s worth the effort. He wants to remind him that he was so close to ending it all but Steve already knows. And despite all that, Steve still hasn’t given up on him.
“Steve...” He turned and looked at Nat. The skin around her eyes were tight as they darted between his rapidly.
“Tony!”
Tony saw something shift in Steve’s face. He knew that look.
“What are you talking about? I haven’t killed anyone!” He snarls back. Reed’s a complete hypocrite and a madman and Steve was wrong to even leave him alone for a second-
"I'm the same. I'd do anything for you Steve, anything."
Tony was taken aside to an area with civilians and sat down on some rubble by the med area Shield had set up. Steve was with him too by an ambulance and helicopter nearby but he could barely register. The world was hazy and he felt like he was drifting. He thought he heard Nat giving instructions in his com to the medics and felt someone slip fingers under his neck and click the manual release for his helmet. It was lifted off and Tony felt the sticky unpleasantness of sweat dampening his forehead and the back of his neck. He shivered and felt the wind brush against his tear stricken cheeks, wondering if maybe he was better of with the helmet back on. This couldn’t be a pretty sight.
“Yup. They wanted them and I said no. Then I got drunk as hell and trashed my house. It wasn’t pretty.” Even as Tony said it, he winced. So much for getting Steve to tolerate him, let alone
“Norman, is that everyone?” Zeke practically bounced across the room, body exuding that confidence he was known for.
“He’s distant. He doesn’t talk much. And when I asked his team why he hadn’t come to me sooner, they just...”
“Here Tony. Please be careful with your stitches.”
“Hey rookie. Need a hand there? It’s a pretty big leap.” Steve said behind him, taking Tony back to when Steve had caught him before he’d nearly fallen off the ledge.
“No. It’s...”
“I’ll do it Zeke. Just for you.” Tony smiled tightly.
There was a medic in front of him holding a pen light. A few others were starting to join them, all carrying bags and some other equipment. Tony watched them pull out an O2 sat device and a blood pressure cuff.
Curious, Tony tilted his head, letting his lips curve into a smile. He was pretty sure he'd do a back-flip if Steve asked.
After what felt like hours, they finally made it to the last area on the list. And, boy had
“Of course Zeke.”
“Why, you and Rogers of course.” Pierce insisted, leaning forward a little to make eye contact. “Just between you and me, I think it could even work. I'm pretty modern that way.”
And with luck...
“How did you make a version that was so...so easy?” Tony whispered, staring up at Steve like he was some kind of genius. It was Steve’s turn to frown.
“Not much.” Tony said and tried to wrack his brain when Fury’s jaw clenched. “He just told me...”
“What do you mean?”
He dropped his head in his hands and squeezed his eyes shut. The room was spinning in slow heavy circles.
Shrugging the idea away, Tony trotted up to the foyer and waited patiently outside Fury’s office. He fiddled with his watch and groaned. Fury was running late.
“Oh of course! Come Tony!” She chirped and slid her hand around his waist, guiding him in the direction of Zeke’s private quarters. They left the main entrance without words, and soon the faint voices of Norman and Zeke grew distant. They reached the wooden door.
Footsteps closed in behind him. A petite hand fell on his shoulder.
His body aches. His heart feels slower now. Maybe it’s better this way.
It was a mistake. the second he pushed himself out, his vision spun and his head felt light. If Steve hadn't caught him, he would've fainted.
The bastard was smiling just a little. He knew.
“I want to know. I keep wondering.” Steve continued gently but with just a hint of force to make it clear. He wanted to know. It was important to him.
“Okay. Good.” Steve said, looking around quickly as if searching for something. Then he bit his lip and settled on an empty glass.
Steve grinned a little at that. The issues between them were a mile long but Tony was still Tony. He still loved him.
He hadn’t been intimate with anyone since he lost his last mark. He’d paid off a few people here and there, but not once had he actually shown his body to anyone. Swimming and shared showers and even wearing his tanks around the team was not something he wanted to entertain. They’d work it out if he did.
Steve glanced at him like he knew what he was thinking and sighed. Then, before Tony could say anything, he carefully stood up. The Cap-tsum stared up at him and when Steve began to move towards the exit with the Iron-tsum, the Cap-tsum began to chirp loudly and swim after him.
through seeing you like that? Are you sorry for nearly getting yourself
"Oh jeez, don't cry Cap." Tony said hoarsely and slowed down his shuffling. "I shouldn't have hidden it from you. I just thought-"
“Oh yeah. But we work together too. It helps.”
Steve then pulls him in and holds him again. He cries in Tony's hair and mumbles words that Tony can barely make out. But from what he hears, he can tell something's not right.
His words were cut short by the sharp, high-pitched laugh. Zeke didn’t stop for a good minute, and Tony’s heart sank.
Then his eyes widen and he glances at Tony.
Are you serious-“
Through the corner of his eye, he watches Ty continue to scramble and panic. For a moment he feels nothing but relief.
“Take care Tony. And remember, you deserve good things too.”
Steve looked awfully pale on the gurney and was watching with his lids half-way. Frankly it was amazing that he was still awake.
Cap-tsum began to chirp excitedly. And Tony could see why.
“You can’t go. You’ve taken a hit and I don’t care what he says, you need to rest.”
He heard a bitter laugh and felt something shrivel up inside when he saw how resigned Steve looked.
“I know.” Tony said quietly, keeping his eyes fixed on the door behind the doctor. “But it’s all I can do.”
“Have faith.” Steve reminded quietly beside him and Tony closed his eyes tightly.
The Captain again. Tony should start a new faction. “What happened my lord?”
seemed to relax. His lips curved into a smile and he laughed.
"I will never let you go Tony. There's nothing you can do to stop me caring about you." Steve says and doesn't budge even for a second. His gaze holds Tony's very soul. Steve says it like he truly believes it. It doesn't make sense.
"Tony-"
Tony’s coughs calmed down after a moment. Then he simply lay there with his eyes closed, taking in deep breaths. It was worrying because Tony’s body looked so frail now and with his long matted hair and his hollow cheeks, he almost looked sick.
“He suffered from major depressive disorder. At least that’s what the suspected diagnosis was in his records. Hence the recklessness and lack of concern when attempting missions. At one point we were all concerned because...well...”
Permission granted, he walked in and closed the door behind him. Zeke was at his desk again, reading a book called ‘Wuthering Heights’ in dim candle light.
“My vampire. Mine.” Steve sighed deeply, not letting Tony budge and that was it. He was stuck.
Fury’s hand was clenched tight around the glass, enough that Tony would have to pry his fingers away one by one before he had a chance to take it. And when Tony looked back up, he noticed Fury looking straight at someone across the dance floor. Tony followed his gaze and stared.
“This is like the bike thing isn’t it? It’s the same thing.” Steve said, looked annoyed as he walked up to him until he was inches away from Tony’s shoulders.
“They already knew. That’s the only reason they let me observe your heat.”
Finally he sighed and threw his head back and stretched his body, groaning at the aches he felt. When he finished, he looked down at Tony who was still kneeling before him.
Tony almost said out loud, flicking his eyes between the bartender’s mixer and the politician.
“No one. Just my ex.”
A futurist. Someone who could predict the future. Or try at the very least.
His time is limited and he knows then with a startling clarity, that he’ll be joining Steve soon.
“I miss the...no, I’m different. It’s not...it’s not their fault.”
His cock was hard and heavy by the time Steve pulled away. His head spun a little from the firm line of heat coming from where Steve's body was pressing against his.
He couldn’t even speak. He was so shaken.
When Tony tried to separate them. Steve shook his head against his shoulder and squeezed tighter. His neck was damp and his heart felt heavy.
Steve gave him a strange look. Of all the things to hear, that hadn’t been on his list. He’d thought Stark was egotistical, and didn’t really care about much.
Sharon scoffed and turned back to the screens. “Yeah. Because you don’t think about his dick every five minutes.”
Lifting his head up a little, he held his palms out in front of him and stared. His nails were cracked from scraping against the floor, and his hands shook minutely.
“Hey. Do you mind if I stand here?”
Bucky Barnes is the man Steve asked him to save in his letter. That should sting more than it does but when Tony first read it, he’d just felt numb. Steve had spoken to him from beyond the grave and he’d been so lost for words that he’d barely been able to respond. But it gave him purpose and he’d been looking for James Barnes to fulfill that purpose ever since.
“Oh please. Like you’d last a day.”
Steve couldn’t believe what he was seeing. It wasn’t possible, not in any universe. But clearly it was because this wasn’t the first time he was seeing it.
“See you on the other side.” Steve whispered and then winked at him before he was wheeled away, leaving Tony to try and control how much he was shaking. In the background he could hear the medics talking and the people in the background clapping and cheering. Some people were shouting
“I mean what I say.”
Steve’s expression was strained. The skin around his eyes was tight and his lips were curved down.
“Is it true?” Rogers says quietly, his eyes fierce and stormy. “You’re pregnant?”
Just then, Tony spotted something just behind Steve. It was poking its little head out of the ball pit and staring up at Steve with a huge wide-eyed stare and Tony couldn’t help but laugh at that.
He was so tired and yet he could not sleep.
“Inbound asteroid belt of delta 49. Expected ETA is ten minutes.” Carol’s voice came through from the back of the quinjet and with a sigh, he turned and left the cockpit. Sharon didn’t say a word to him as he left.
Throwing the bed-covers aside, he sent the mountain of clothes tumbling to the floor and stumbled into the en suite.
They couldn’t lose the chance. They couldn’t fail him again.
“I’m sorry. I’ll be careful, I promise.”
Well there went his bid at freedom. If Zeke or anyone found out, he’d never be allowed outside again. Not to mention the sheer amount of punishment he’d get for even daring to wander into such a populated zone. How stupid could he get?
He hears Carol smile before she speaks.
“Welcome back.” Steve said quietly, looking so relieved, Tony didn’t know what to say. The poor guy looked like he’d been shedding buckets.
Steve said the words clearly and it was everything they’d agreed on but Tony couldn’t help but feel like something was off. Like he was missing something.
“Tony. Tell me what’s on your mind.”
Something in Natasha’s eyes dawned when he looked at her. Her mouth parted and she frowned before closing it.
"Okay." Tony promised and cleared his throat. "I'm sorry."
" Tony rolled his eyes and looked away but not before catching Steve's glare. "So I'm going to go and bring it here. I'll be back within the hour."
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!?”
"Sir, you're not with them?"
It works like a charm. The one thing Tony notices is that every time he mentions something about the baby, Steve is drawn like a moth to a flame. Like right now, Steve is racing towards him and-
“What’s gotten into you? Did something happen?”
And the body suits were designed for going commando.
Tony thought, feeling his body relax as Steve opened the door and got out. He hoped so anyway. For the next few hours, Steve was the only person he was really going to know. But maybe that would be fine.
“Get lost, freeloader.”
The numbers ticked up, they were only seconds away.
Almost knowingly, Steve smiled. “I’m fine Tony. I’ll be alright.” He shifted and tried to hide his grimace when one of the medics tugged at one of the lines. But then he looked back at Tony with a gentle expression.
Dugan howled with laughter and Tony eyed the somewhat empty bottle of wine with suspicion.
Even a god said everyone had one. What did that say about him?
Please also check out Lu and Juni's absolutely GORGEOUS ART!! It is honestly just wonderful, they are so awesome!
“Stark? What did you say?” Fury asked, swirling his drink a little. Tony watched the bubbles rise up in the glass and sucked in a breath.
"Strip" by
“Thanks for the ride Shellhead!” He cried feeling the wind brushing his face. Sometimes he couldn’t believe he was lucky enough to be able to feel this. Looking down and seeing the whole of Manhattan beneath their feet was like being a million miles above the earth. It was blissful and breathtaking all at once.
What the hell was Steve
“L’t go? You m’n...” Tony looks down and sniffs. He’s cold and his heart aches. “You m’n I should g’ve up?”
He’s not blind. It’s clear that no one moved on. Steve, most of all.
In the rare moments where Tony reflects on the past, he is often reminded of how close he’d been to saying something. To revealing everything he’d felt, right down to the core. A singular truth that he’d always hidden away from the man he loved.
"I hid from you." Tony looked down in shame. "Lied to you."
“Everyone, I have great news! My friend managed to make some adjustments and has indeed surprised me. Tiberius Stone is on his way.”
“What’s changed?” Tony shrugs and holds out his arms. “I’m still the same. I’m still just a man who-“
“You’re mine now. That’s it. Our scents are one. It doesn’t matter what your views are on werewolves Tony because now-“ His voice cracked and his lips tightened. “Now you’re mine. And everyone will know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It fit him perfectly and he actually looked pretty good. It was almost like it was made for him. His chest looked broader and the faint outline of his six pack was on show. It was very body-hugging but that was Shield uniform. He wouldn’t complain, especially since he had plenty to be proud of.
Taking a deep breath, Steve held his shield out and began to walk a little to the side, taking a fighting stance.
loved that.”
“Like we said, we already ate. Where did you think we’d gone?”
Oh, they were doing
They meet them today. The traitors.
It took twenty nine minutes before they managed to reach the planet atmosphere. Mist surrounded the quinjet but thankfully the sensors did not let them down. With Carol and Thor’s help, they managed to land safely on the surface.
And he could see it. In the mannerisms and the gestures. In the way he stood and spoke and sparred.
“Great, thanks doc. I’ll be here.”
Sucking in a sharp breath, Tony twisted his head round and stared. The sight of Steve snoring softly with his eyes closed made Tony start.
“What?”
There was a brief pause. A few things were tapped in the background and then she spoke.
Frowning, he carefully knelt on the floor, trying not to make a sound when his stitches tugged sharply. He made a mental note to never get shot again.
A wave of determination swept through him. He’d get this right. He
“I do. But they don’t know. I’m keeping them safe.” And Tony could hear Steve smiling as he spoke. “Besides. It’s not like I can stop them. My soulmate has plenty of spark, I don’t even think it’s surprising.”
Tony swiftly closed his mouth and swallowed. She...
Tony watched Steve pull out his dog tags. Surprisingly, they weren’t around his neck but as Tony inched closer to see the dangling chain, he instantly realised why.
Steve linked their fingers together in a firm hold. Steve held his hand in his.
Tony cleared his throat and looked away. What was there to say? What could he say? If Steve knew what he was thinking, he’d probably laugh and correct him. And Tony really didn’t want to hear that because like this, he could pretend he was important to the team. Still, the questions circled his mind over and over.
Steve winked at him and grabbed him by his wrist.
“Fine.” Steve said and with a nod at the rest of the team, he guided Tony away with a hand on the small of his back. “We’ll be in the penthouse. Don’t disturb us.”
over and over while others were beaming and pointing at him and touching their cheeks.
“As soon as we get home.”
When he finally mustered up the courage to meet Carol's eyes, he felt drained and apathetic. It didn't matter what he wanted. This was his life. He was an outcast.
“TONY!”
Peter back legs rose and waved. He seemed happy. “Great! I think Cap’s real excited too. So’s Thor but he’s always excited. He can be a little tough to talk to and so can Natasha but if you have any questions I’m happy to help. We don't bite. Well, maybe you do. And Cap. Okay we all do.”
The minute she locked her arm around him and pulled his head back, exposing his neck, he knew it was over. Once the bite set in, he’d be bonded for life.
It feels like hours before he reaches 890 fifth Avenue. He knows if can't have been too long though, otherwise he never would’ve made the trip. Still, he feels so much relief when he sees the familiar gates it the distance.
Steve didn't disappoint. Not in the least.
“I’m sorry. I should’ve tried harder, I guess.” Tony choked, barely managing to contain his sobs. He lifted his arms and latched onto Steve too. He felt he’d break if he let go now.
When Steve comes to, he’s hit with several things. The roughness of the ground, the thickness of the air and the cloying stench of death all around him. It doesn’t make any sense, he should be dead, he knows it. He felt it.
“I think I should go.” Tony sighed and pushed his chair out, only pausing when Robinson instantly reached over and grabbed his wrist.
. I can afford my own clothes and probably yours too.” Tony repeated for what felt like the hundredth time. Still, Steve didn’t budge. He only shrugged and grabbed Tony’s hand firmly, forcing the piece of paper into his palm before letting go.
They all head inside and naturally that’s when they hit the first roadblock. Where is Tony meant to put these two alphas?
Steve didn’t seem to have that pinched look in his eyes anymore. And there was a warmth from him that Tony hadn’t known he’d missed.
Tony swallowed and braved eye contact. “Steve, hey look, I’m sorry okay? I know I shouldn’t have lost it like that but I was delirious and pretty out of it-“
“Steve...” Tony choked and more sweat tickled down the sides of his flushed face. He panted through the aches that plagued his abdomen, barely able to catch his breath. His torso quivered through the sweat-soaked cotton shirt that clung to him like a harness. Beneath the fabric, Steve didn't even want to think about the state of Tony's boxers.
“C’n you pl’s...” Tony reaches into his pocket and this time, doesn’t pull his eyes away from the hidden face of the stranger across the street. The man continues to stare back at him.
“Oh I dare.” Steve joked but his eyes were fierce. “You should’ve known better. You lost him the day I laid eyes on him. And it will cost you.”
“Yes.”
Italian food.
“Tony! Oh my god, are you okay!? Let me see you-“
A glance upwards told him Fury didn’t seem surprised. If anything he just looked grim. Still, he didn’t say a word and just seemed to wait for Tony to continue. So he did.
“No.”
“Do you wanna dance now?” Steve asked him softly and Tony felt his breath catch.
The wolf that Steve had become howled into the night, and Tony quickly checked the sky.
"What?"
Steve’s scent filled the air first. Then footsteps grew louder behind him.
They’d discussed it last night. What exactly Steve was doing and who he was taking. Apparently the investigations department had collected various pieces of the robots and had taken them apart to uncover camera footage from each case. And the result had been pretty worrying.
“But seriously, a ball pit? Why the hell would we need to go investigate a ball pit?”
“Wish me luck.”
“...Anthony again-“
The room was well lit from the translucent wall of glass that was posing as a great backdrop for Steve and the room overall. Other than that, there was just a long black desk with several slim computers and tablets and multiple stacks of paper. Tony was sure he spotted at least three phones on the desk.
“So Robinson’s better? You realize those are our only options right now.”
The weight of the ongoing stress threatened to crush him for a moment, and it was enough to once again make him question whether he was just being unnecessarily cruel bringing Sharon along. How was it fair that only a week after they’d broken up, he was asking her to come on this mission of all things?
Points should’ve been awarded because at least Tony could say he waited till after they were outside to bring it up.
Everything’s quiet and dark. He can’t see a thing and he can make out voices in the distance.
“We’re approaching the base.” There was a pause and Tony opened his eyes and watched the red dot move. “No trouble yet.”
“Oh Anthony! You’re so sweet, making them feel better! I can’t wait for when you and I have children, do you know how beautiful our babies will be-“
"Sorry, I was just-caught in the moment." Tony said and heaved a sigh of relief when Steve relaxed and smiled back. Then, Steve guided Tony's left hand to his shoulder and took the other in his own.
Tonight he pulls it out and settles it by the frame. Then he takes the painkillers and pills he’s had in the draw for months and places them next to the bottle. The bottles are full and waiting. In the morning he’ll take them.
The doctor went quiet for a moment. When Tony looked up, he realized the doctor looked a little...frustrated.
What they looked like was extraordinary. But what they did was terrifying.
“Tony.” Steve said in the reflection and stepped closer behind him. He looked determined and somewhat red.
Rage burns in Steve's chest, even though it feels like he's been dunked with cold water.
“Stand down soldier.” Steve said firmly with a flinty gaze and Tony paused. “You better fall in line.”
”Don’t play coy Stark! This isn’t one of your games, you have a responsibility to-!”
The others too, they all looked shocked and pretty horrified and for a moment, Tony debated asking what they were so worried about. Everyone was fine.
Ben's eyes were wide with terror, and he looked ice-white with fear.
And he was standing here without even holding a hall pass. Small wonders.
“No, I mean, I said some pretty awful things too. I didn’t actually mean-“
“Steve I...I need to ask you something. And I’m only gonna ask once.” Tony swallowed and clenched his fists. “Who do you think your mate is?”
“It’s nothing. A pipe dream.” Steve mutters under his breath and clears his throat. “Have a seat.”
“Ready.” Tony said softly, suddenly worrying that maybe he’d make Steve look bad. He quickly looked down and checked his suit but then Steve cleared his throat and oh,
Slipping out of the ballroom, he entered the corridor and made his way to the pearl colored bathroom doors. Once he stepped through, he checked the coast was clear and took a moment to turn on the tap and fill his hands with ice-cold water. Then he splashed it over his face and gasped, suppressing a shudder.
His therapist would’ve been proud.
“You didn’t sleep last night.” Steve said, and instantly looked like he regretted saying anything. His expression went pinched and he folded his arms like he was trying not to let it slip that he seemed to care.
“Okay. So you like spiders. Do you have a fetish or something?” Tony blurted, before he could stop himself. Thankfully, Steve was unperturbed.
Weeks of anger at the unfairness, the frustration born from being helpless, had finally built up to so much that Tony couldn’t hold back. This was Tony breaking. This was him finally letting it out.
Steve ignores him completely and grabs the bottle of alcohol. Then he takes it and
“Well, you know. We spent one night together and-“
“Sorry Winghead, I can’t today! Mr. Stark’s got me on a contract in the Malibu warehouse. I need to go check it out.”
He understood what was going on now.
“You see Rogers? You see what you have done!? The omega can’t even do his most basic task! He can’t even get up, all because of the stress you put on him!”
Tony reached for his water and tried to smile. He didn’t want to offend Steve at all so tried to keep things mellow. So far so good. “It was good! I finished a few projects Fury wanted me to do, did a lot of gear building and joined the one Skype meeting I’d promised to do. So all in all it’s been pretty good.”
Sighing to himself, Tony knelt down and beckoned them closer, watching the hopeful look on their faces. A quick check of his surroundings confirmed they were alone and so, silent as a mouse, Tony unzipped the collar of his black uniform and tilted his head, exposing the pale smooth expanse of skin.
“You’re just...more.” Steve said softly and for a moment Tony paused and looked up.
For some reason, Tony gets the distinct impression he’s being laughed at. But Ty smiles softly and tilts his head ever so slightly, in that way he does when he thinks Tony’s being cute. Ty really hasn’t changed in some ways. Sometimes Tony’s taken right back to his MIT years.
“Please...” He whispers and snow slowly begins to fall, peppering the world with flakes of white. The man is still standing. Tony is still waiting.
”I can’t.” He repeated but his voice cracked as he spoke and even Ben frowned at that. “I-I just can’t.”
Tony’s whole body jumped and he let out a shout.
"So you mean I watched those videos for nothing?" Steve scowled and that was it. Tony burst into laughter, he couldn't help it.
Tony’s eyes watered all over again. “Okay.” He croaked, feeling Steve hold him even tighter. “Okay.”
Steve pauses from his blanket arranging and looks up. “Yes?”
“I can’t agree with this.”
Swallowing, Tony shook his head. Steve's expression tightened. His lips grew pinched.
It wasn’t just possessiveness like Zeke. It was...something else.
“Hey, isn’t it a little early to be watching Mad Max?”
“Which was?” Steve asks dully because what reason could Tony have to do this to him? Was it worth it? Was it even worth it?
The voices turn into gasps of horror. He thinks he hears someone scream.
Steve eyed him with a look full of dread. "Including kill yourself. You'd hurt yourself if you thought it would make me happy."
Steve hummed lightly. “Oh yeah?”
“I-“ His voice broke but at Steve’s insistence, he let Steve tug off his shirt until his whole front was exposed including his collar bones. Nothing.
, for God’s sake! When all he remembered was Fury telling him he was not recommended.
“I know. Doesn’t mean you should be out on the field right now.”
“I’ll go. Forget the suit, I’ll be fine.”
“I want more.”
He had to move on. This was just one of the many things he had to deal with as part of that.
The small part of him that still feels, knows it’s wrong. He can’t stand there and don the uniform and take Steve’s place, he can’t.
, appear before them.
“Hey. You’re okay.” Steve said in the same tone, practically crowding over Tony. His arms pressed against the seat around Tony’s body and didn’t let up. It gave Tony no room to escape but strangely, he didn’t feel afraid.
were wrong.
Steve turned and flashed him an unimpressed look.
“Of course, my lord. What would you like me to do with your current ones?” Tony asked as he raked through Zeke’s wardrobe, searching until he found what he was looking for. He pulled out the dark green robes with the gold lining on the cuffs and inspected it.
Tony almost said it then. The thing he hadn’t told Steve yet.
He’d also learned that Steve had enough strength to lift up a fully built adult male and hold him up against the wall with just one hand.
“No, no I don’t need you thinking I’m some sort of helpless case. I’m fine-“
There’s a moment of silence. Roger’s expression goes slack. Then-
“Stark!”
"Ironman! Great job!" He beamed and it was like staring directly into the sun.
And things only got worse when he saw Stark sitting in the kitchen again that evening.
Tony couldn't even begin to express how much his heart leapt at the words.
After a brief inspection, Tyler cleared his throat and spoke. “So I’m Tyler, but you can call me Ty. This is the main research and development lab, which I’m sure Ben showed you already. I’m just gonna help you get settled in and let you know what your tasks are.”
Fury swore quietly and began to turn. “I’m getting Rogers.”
Tony didn’t like the sound of that.
Tony felt inadequate. And when he risked a look at Steve with his perfect form and his own achievements (it wasn’t like people didn’t know), he felt it was glaringly obvious.
“Of course, of course! See you later sweetheart.” She said and kissed him on the cheek in a mockery of affection before skipping away. Tony wanted to crawl back into the punishment room.
“They’re not important.” Tony glared, yanking the chair out from under the table and sitting in it. “I’ve not got one and look at me. I’m doing fine.”
“Goddammit Tony, get out of here! They’ve locked onto you!” Steve yelled and grabbed his wrist tightly with a white-knuckled grip.
This was the most Steve had ever said to him.
“So how does it work for vampires? How does blood affect you?” Steve asked politely changing the subject and tilting his head a little like he was studying a specimen.
Tony had changed completely. Everyone knew why but no one brought it up-no one
“He’s not that bad. Really. Give him a chance.”
But there’s something else. How could he forget?
“...I think so. He always did talk about you.” Strange says and finally gets up to leave. Another goodbye. Another loss.
“I said, stand in line. I won’t repeat myself, Stark.” Steve repeated, and from a glance, Tony could already see he looked annoyed. God knew why.
He’s on the floor. Someone’s shouting his name and pressing fingers to his neck. Another hand is hovering over his nose and mouth and as he breathes and starts to cough, he hears a sigh of relief.
“Tony!” Steve bolted up from his positioned and instantly reached for Tony’s neck, pulling him up to have a look at him. To his complete horror, he started cry.
“What the fuck happened-fuck-!”
Steve’s blood boiled with rage. To see Tony like this after so long was unacceptable. And it was like this every time. This was only the third encounter but each time, Steve let him slip away. He lost Tony over and over.
If Fury was affected by the insinuation, he didn’t show it. But his shoulders did drop at the words.
He’d probably have to call Ty. He tried not to feel too deflated at the thought.
“I do.” Steve said simply, running his hands over the armor carefully from top to bottom. The gold mesh was doing wonders and Steve could hardly see the places where Tony had been hurt. That raised the next question though.
“It sounds like we’re quite a pair, huh?” Tony yawns and smiles as he blinks sleepily. Opposite him, Steve smiles back, looking equally dopey with happiness.
Steve doesn’t say anything. He feels too lost. Too empty. But he listens.
”Go get the suit!”
It was safe. Like this he could pretend it had all been a fever dream.
He loved going outside. It honestly made him feel something more.
Then he unlocked the mechanism and pressed the plunger.
“C’mon Stark.” Fury said, almost gently and handed Tony the not-empty glass of water.
“Are...are you sure?”
“Maybe I’m just being careful.”
Tony’s screams turned into a choked sob. His eyes leaked tears of pain and frustration as he felt her toss his arm to the floor. When his eyes flickered towards it, he whimpered, feeling like an animal about to be put down.
like it.
“I’m so tired. Just let me go home.” Tony said numbly, unblinking as tears fell from his eyes and his vision blurred. Before him, Steve was shocked, his mouth parted and his eyes wide with horror, anger, disbelief-
“Tony...”
“The mark. I didn’t even think you’d react to it like this. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have, I’m sorry.” Steve’s voice was muffled in his shoulder and Tony felt the vibration wrack his entire body.
“Come lie down with me Shellhead. I want to feel you near me.”
“Talk to me. Why’d you lose it like that? I’ve never seen you behave like that, not once.”
Steve and through him, the others too. They were a team. Maybe even a family.
“He hasn’t told me.” Reed says quietly and glances back at the photo behind him. “You believe we destroyed a planet.”
There was literally no one around. Not a soul. It was almost...eery.
Fingertips brushed his. Tony sucked in a sharp breath and snapped his gaze up at Steve, meeting determined, but fearful blue eyes.
“I see. Well anyway, I wanted to just show you a bit about me. Seeing as we’re friends now.”
Amused, Fury picked up a new pen from his infinite draw and smiled. “You’d be surprised at what goes on in his head. I think you’ll enjoy yourself Stark.”
“Thanks Ty. So should I start with the first one or just pick one and go from there? I guess it doesn’t matter but that fourth design by Ryan looks pretty-“
“Careful pup. That’s a no go.” Tony said, letting his eyes fall half shut dangerously. There was no way he was gonna be bitten by a werewolf, no matter how golden he was. He had too much at stake and his precious freedom was only the half of it.
“That’s a massive oversimplification, don’t you think!?” Steve growls. How dare Tony mock him!?
“You know, we don’t have to talk about it. Since we already know how it’s gonna turn out.” Tony said lightly, even though Steve could see his fists clench in his lap.
“Tuesday.” Steve smiled, eyes glinting. “Every six days. That’s...good.”
It had turned out he was right. The feeling he’d had before had been completely spot on.
“I’m so sorry Tony.” He whispered and finally pulled away. Tony blinked at the sight.
All because he loved him. Irrevocably. Immeasurably. Infinitely. He’d do anything for him.
Tony's eyes flew open and instantly he ducked his head to try and hide his face. Maybe if he was lucky, they wouldn't-
say that. Don’t-don’t diminish what we had because you’re angry.”
Tonight is a night spent on a side bench beside an alley that looks likes it’s not been visited for years. Huddling in for the night, Tony brings his feet up and tries to find a cosy enough position on the bench to lull himself to sleep. The cool metal digs into his sides through his thin jacket and as time continues to tick away, Tony finds himself shaking harder and biting his lips more fiercely.
Today he also had a report to deliver to Steve. Not directly of course, since he didn’t want to face him after his encounter with Carol (No doubt they would've spoken), but he’d get his sheet over to Maria and beg her to take it up. He couldn’t handle facing Steve right now, he was so tired.
“Hey? What’s on you mind?” Steve rolled over and leaned on his arm, watching Tony’s face carefully. Gone were the earlier smiles.
His heart pounded. His hands shook. He stopped in the middle of some random corridor and leaned against the wall, breathing heavily and digging his heels into his eyes until they felt raw. Slowly he slid down the wall and leaned his head back, closing his eyes.
Tony turned to him as he was pocketing his keys. “Why?”
Steve had been wrong. Just like Tony had thought.
Finally the man looked up and met his eyes.
"Steve-"
“Calm down!”
“I’m fairly sure. If you get that bored, you can come talk to me. Not that I can picture that but-“
With a sigh, Steve shook his head and lowered his voice, clearly sensing something was wrong. “What is it?” The words were soft but somehow it felt like Steve was trying to block him from others sights.
He bites his lip and squeezes his eyes shut. When he opens them, Steve’s still there.
It took every ounce of Tony’s willpower not to fight. He wanted to destroy the man. Wring his scrawny little neck and blast him with a few carefully placed blasts. It would be fun, and hell maybe even Steve would join in. It could be a bonding exercise.
“Mind-blowing?” Tony said, at last letting himself relax. If that was how Steve had reacted...
Shivers and tremors start to course through his body. His hands shake and his throat begins to close.
Pulling back, he met Steve’s eyes. They were glistening and this close, Tony could see green flecks. They were beautiful.
The agent got out of the seat and gestured for him to sit. Once he was sat down, he picked up the headphones and slipped them over his ears, bringing the mic into position in front of his lips. Then he closed his eyes and spoke into it.
“I will give you more. When the father returns, i'll ask-“
for me!”
That stung. Like rubbing salt into fresh wounds, only it was like someone had dropped the salt on him, rather than dug it in.
“Your pants next Tony.” Steve said firmly, starting to sound desperate and Tony hated that Steve was starting to get it. It hurt more than he could imagine. Steve would finally see his body for what it was; a blank canvas with nothing to give. No hope of anything.
“Sorry, I’ll move.” He opened his eyes just a fraction and tried to lift up his head and pull away but Steve didn’t let go. Surprised, Tony looked up.
Blood erupted from the source and Tony devoured it like an addict.
"By the lifts. Where are you?"
Steve scoffed and scrolled upwards. Fucking animals they were to think-
“You’re pregnant. God, you’re-“ Rogers is pressing kisses into his hair just the way he likes and holding him close to his chest like nothing can hurt him and- “We did it. I can’t believe you’re-“
His hands clamped down on Zeke’s shoulders. His lips parted and his fangs grew. He inched closer, testing the waters and finally sunk his teeth into the pale flesh.
Their moves developed. Steve began to circle Stark and Stark started to shift in tandem. Like a dance between two birds, Steve carefully placed his feet forward and set his eyes on the target.
It was hard to explain to Steve that it genuinely did not hurt without sounding like he was lying. Sure it stung when he shifted a certain way but Steve was a big enough distraction from the pain. They just had to be careful, otherwise it was fine.
He was costing Tony time. His emotions were stopping him from thinking straight. Next time, he wouldn’t-
Before he can stop himself, he’s already eyeing the stranger for more.
“You always manage to sneak up on me. What’s your secret? Demon curse? Pixie dust?” He asked, spinning around to smirk at the disgruntled look on Steve’s face.
He winced internally. That had to have been the worst attempt at making small talk that anyone had ever tried.
Tony stared at Pierce with wide eyes. Almost desperately, he looked past his shoulder at Fury.
Once Rogers reluctantly lets him go, Tony presses his hand to his head and bows down. What is he gonna do?
As Tony watched the scene play out in front of him, he couldn’t help but wonder why he was suddenly the villain here. From the way Ben was supporting Sam and the men and women around them were whispering, it was pretty damn obvious that he was the problem here, and not just with Ben.
“I am sorry to hear of the Avengers situation. They have been plaguing my family too Ezekiel. It’s no surprise things ended up this way.”
They’re no where near done. But Tony feels the need to say it. If there’s anything he’s learned, it’s that he doesn’t want Steve to not know.
He hoped Tony still remembered that night. That he had used that to stay strong.
But Fury
Smiling at the both of them, Pierce raised his glass and took a sip, and when he finished, his eyes gleamed with excitement. He faced Fury with ease.
He knew it was a bad time, but Tony couldn’t help but feel like they were Winghead and Shellhead again. He was reminded of the past where Steve and him would make their strategies and everything would fit perfectly. If he closed his eyes now, he could picture the mansion with Jarvis and the others and feel Steve’s hand on his shoulder.
"You should be dead." Tony croaks.
Steve was leaning casually against the door frame, tapping one foot impatiently while keeping his arms folded. His eyes raked over Tony’s naked form.
Captain America smiling and telling him they’d won.
How can this be his life? God, what is he even
Seemingly pleased, Steve nodded. For some reason, it irritated Tony, even though he couldn't expect Steve to know.
“Captain America asked me to tell you...ah, boss-he wants you to wear the set he’s picked out.”
“We made him. Our pup.”
“Maybe come in? Or leave, whichever you prefer.”
Tony couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. One look at Steve told him everything he already knew.
“It’s too much.” He says and ducks his head to avoid the stares. “I don’t want...I don’t know what to do.”
“Yes.” Steve said quietly, and Tony was taken aback by the seriousness of Steve’s tone. He looked deadly serious and like it wasn’t a joke.
“YOU’RE A LIAR! HOW DARE YOU-!”
“I kn’w.” Tony sobs softly to himself and looks up at Steve, perhaps for the last time. “I l’ve you.”
“Tiberius Stone.” Steve acknowledged, without even a hint of warmth. His voice sounded like it has been cut from granite. Sharp and harsh and unforgiving.
“The Captain?” Tony asked, trying not to focus too hard on the fact that he’d seen an arachnid, just mere hours ago.
The smirk slid off the man’s face and he started to step closer into Tony’s space.
“Did you say the commander’s office?”
”No.”
“Get on.”
“You sound very happy. It’s been a good day?” Steve didn’t sound like he’d had a good day. On the contrary, Tony felt he was listening to someone who’d just been in a fight. Steve sounded pretty fed up.
He was going to be their third. Not a partner. Simply their plaything.
“Well can’t argue with the boss now can I?”
“Anthony.” A voice rumbled behind him and he turned, coming face to face with Thor. This close, he really was huge.
“You need to let go.” Steve says calmly over him and folds his arms over his chest like he’s made his decision. “You can’t keep going like this.”
But he was right. He was completely right.
Steve didn’t seem surprised. He only smiled and let them drop back around his neck. His eyes were glued to Tony’s though.
Laying the human down carefully, he dragged some cardboard over and placed it under the man’s head. Then he brushed his hands together and stood back.
The room was full of heroes or politicians. There was no in between. And no one who he really knew personally.
Nodding sharply, Steve reached out with ridged hands and grabbed the jug. After pouring out a glass, he placed it next to Tony’s plate and nodded.
“Ah, missing him already?”
No one has seen you in weeks, Tony! You disappeared, literally off the face of the earth, told no one and then Carol came back with a broken transmitter that had just one message! No coordinates, no clues-just you telling me you were sorry!”
Another fifteen minutes went by. He was meant to have started his chat with Fury at 10:45am so he was already half an hour late. What was taking so long?
He had to be careful. If he wasn’t then who knew what would happen. They’d deliver his remains to Pepper and that would be the end.
Tony met Steve’s eye. And knew the answer before he even confirmed it.
While JARVIS worked on that, he took off his shoes, jacket and belt and fell back on the bed with a sigh. The soft fabric of his quilt was probably the only thing he could say he enjoyed today. The four hour trip to see Robinson had not been worth it.
The humor vanished from Steve’s face instantly as he turned to the man and held out a hand.
It was cold and merciless-shockingly so. It almost worked.
Tony’s eye twitched. There was
His expression must’ve shaken Steve because he instantly back-tracked. “Bad idea? No, you’re right, it’s ridiculous forget i-“
“No, I really don’t.”
The words felt heavy as he spoke, and tentatively he looked up to gauge Steve’s reaction. To his surprise, Steve’s shoulders relaxed and he narrowed his eyes shrewdly.
"Come to bed. You need to sleep." Steve murmurs softly and when Tony feels himself being guided to the bed, he doesn't resist. He feels too empty, like his insides have been scraped raw. There's too much for even him to process however when he's made to lie down, and sees Steve stripping down to his boxers and stepping towards him, it hits him then.
Tony wondered helplessly, turning his arm this way and that, feeling giddy at how easy it was.
Tony’s eyes were duller, and with that bruise on his face he looked so much more vulnerable. He looked more tired. That brightness was missing. His spark was gone.
What he’d seen so far wasn’t bad. It was just...different. There was almost no privacy but there was also a strange sense of...togetherness. On one table in the cafeteria, he’d spotted a group of agents-two men and two women laughing over the splodge of food that looked like chicken. Another table had two women playing footsie while giggling at some other agents’ haircut. Outside the showers there were rows of towels next to some lockers.
“How did this happen!? FUCK! How did this even HAPPEN!?” Steve screamed and picked up the chair on his side and slammed it into the wall with a cry. Tony’s ears were ringing.
And he’d never have it if the very sight of him made Tony shake.
He began to walk in his chosen direction. Focused and determined, he didn’t let up, even when the mist got thicker. The air pressure didn’t change thankfully, but it was becoming harder and harder to see. It was some time before he began to realize where it was coming from.
“Of course I’m worried!” Steve growls and starts pacing in the kitchen like he’s desperate to fight. “He could take you away! My omega and my pup, and I’m supposed to just sit here and let it happen-“
Tony knew he couldn’t do much else then. Steve was clearly calculating something-he knew that face anywhere. At times like that, Tony knew it was best not to disturb him. Steve wasn’t one for small talk at times like this.
So he’d been tasked with working out the maths and calculations for these designs. There were about ten or so on there and he just had to complete the blueprint calculations. Easy.
They knew, Steve thinks, as he feels hands pull him away. He knows Reed is watching. He knows they all are.
(The creature turned into dust. There was nothing left-)
His greed was torturing them both. He was selfish and Steve didn’t even know. Hell, Steve wouldn’t even be in this bed if it wasn’t for him.
“Hmm?” Steve tried his best to keep his voice light. They seemed to have mutually agreed that nothing should be said about earlier and Steve was prepared to stay quiet until Tony was ready.
“Well-“ Tony rocked on the balls of his feet a little. Behind him, he clasped his hands together tightly. “You could send someone you trust to take blood from those areas. Or at least someone to feed so that the area remains claimed.”
“Thank you for attending Mr. Stark.”
“I’m leaving.” John added uselessly and held up a hand and stuck his thumb towards the entrance. “Before we all get kicked out. You coming Steve?”
And no. It’s not.
He’d always wondered what a creature’s blood would taste like.
“But I can do more. You need someone to fill Whitney’s space.” He emphasized through grit teeth, fixing a solid gaze on Zeke. He didn’t blink, even for a second.
“Thanks.” Tony said, definitely biting back a smile now. “I look forward to that too.”
“So there’s no weapons at all?” Because that was the biggest concern. Hundreds of Shield agents would be at risk without a Defense system, anyone could see that.
There was a small shift after that. Tony was hopeful that things had changed even if nothing really had on the outside. But he was convinced they had.
“Seriously Pep, how is this my life?” Tony groans on the phone and sighs. “I didn’t even want an alpha. How come I have two?”
“I can’t believe this went so far.” Steve said quietly, sounding like he’d been wounded. Tony could relate.
Tony could’ve strangled him.
That was one thing that was strange that day. Tony didn’t see even a glimpse of the masked cow. And he didn’t hear anything about that from Zeke or Norman either. Instead, Zeke had moved on to other topics.
being forced down.” Rogers says with such an awful expression. He looks like he’s gonna puke. “It scares him.”
He looks as good as Tony remembers, tall and proud only instead of his uniform, he's wearing Shield issue tracksuit pants and a matching black jacket with the logo on. He also seems strangely out of breath and his hair is array and slightly damp with sweat, like he's been running. Odd but not bad at all, he still looks amazing.
Fine. That was all.
“Take him to the punishment room. I don’t want to see him until next week. Maybe then he’ll think twice before speaking like that.”
“What have you done, Tony?
Steve had been his best friend. He’d even thought that Steve might’ve loved him once.
A smile began to creep on Tony’s face.
“There was no recovering from what I did. What we went through.” Tony dodged but Steve was watching him like a hawk. “I’d heard rumors that you were just keeping me here to keep an eye on me. Because I was...”
“T’Challa-T’Challa’s gone ahead.” Tony wheezes out, sitting up fully on his knees and wincing as the armor scrapes against the ground. Almost painstakingly slow, he reaches out and brushes his hand against Steve’s cheek, feeling the soft tremors chase up his arm and course through his body.
But Steve’s gone. He’s gone and left him.
Today’s the day. It’s been months and things have finally come to a head. Steve isn’t afraid to admit it anymore, even with the loss of many nights and days spent thinking.
“I’ll do what I can my lord. As you ask me to.”
Steve didn’t say a word. Instead, he raised a brow and looked at him.
Yeah. Not great.
He remembered why he’d been there now. Why he’d pushed the others to come with him.
After spending some time walking through the dying streets of late New York, he continued his way home, being sure to keep himself concealed all the way back. Once he got to the tower and greeted Jenny and several others, he made his way up to his floor and felt his mind begin to drift.
“I didn’t know you were coming.” Tony muttered quietly, taking another sip of his wine. Through the glass, he noted the blonde woman beside Maria.
The words send a shiver down Steve’s spine and he feels something lurking. That sinking feeling returns.
The one highlight in his day was the walk to the labs in the morning. Because he had to cross a certain corridor to get there, he crossed Steve almost every morning. Sometimes Steve would be on the phone, talking rapidly to someone about some political issue, and sometimes he’d just be walking past.
“Put her through.”
“Okay.” Tony said firmly, taking a deep shuddery breath. He could feel his heart rate doubling. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
"Should've known what?"
“I’ll do better, I promise.”
“See, this is the problem with you superhero types. You think you have rights to everything and that includes everyone.”
, glared and approached them both, taking Tony by the wrist and pulling him back before he could even protest.
“Tony’s going to be fine Captain. He lost slightly more blood during the procedure than we expected but with rest he will be absolutely fine. As we discussed, he’s okay now. His alpha gave him the push he needed.”
“I won’t hurt you. I’m not-I’m not gonna be that alpha, you
“You think I’ve been punishing you?” Steve whispered, sounding absolutely miserable. Even his eyes dimmed and Tony quickly lifted his hands to try and wave the look away.
“Tony!”
“Of course, Cap.” Nat winked, and before the reached the door, Tony noticed Steve nodding at Thor.
“Your mark Tony. Your-“ Steve’s calm facade started to chip away. A tear fell down his cheek as he looked down at Tony and smiled. “I’ve seen your mark.”
For some reason, the blond began to smirk. “Ah, no. They really don’t.”
“I’m coming.” He gets up and grabs his com, feeling something heavy settle on his shoulders.
“Identifying. Scans complete. That’s-“ Suddenly Hank swore. “Human blood. Ninety-six percent match to Anthony Edward Stark. He’s here.”
“You are so precious to me. You think I’ll let them do this to you?” Steve’s hands curled into tight fists but he kept his eyes on Tony. “You think they won’t pay?”
To Tony, it came down to one thing and one thing only;
by holding them off here-“
“Steve...” Carol murmurs and puts a hand on his shoulder. Right. Compassion. Forgiveness. That’s what she expects of him.
“Something wrong?”
“Do it.”
“Steve.”
Steve had a pinched expression on his face. Slowly he put down his sheets and leaned back in his seat. “Tony-“
“What was that?” Tony asked, feeling like he’d been hit by a truck of emotions. Steve, for his part, looked completely nonplussed.
This is real. He can feel the sun.
Quick as lightening, Steve yanked the injector out of his belt and clicked it. The needle was ready as it had always been.
Gritting his teeth in frustration, Tony slid of the bed and knelt in front of Zeke, knowing he needed to do more.
Tony nods, feeling his throat close. Tears are falling down his cheeks and he can’t convince himself to hide them anymore. “We did.”
“Yeah, well. New place and all.” He shrugged and began to shoulder past Steve, who didn’t stop him but did look like he wanted to say more.
“Yes. I feel the same.” Steve said quietly, almost in awe and suddenly Tony felt he could breathe again.
Tony had almost fought with Steve because he refused to tell him. For his safety. That was the biggest clue.
“Rise and shine Stark. Zeke wants you in his room.”
Tony’s mouth almost fell open. Thankfully he managed to control himself.
Was he the
“It’s okay.” Stark sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose as if the tears running down his cheeks had just been incidental. “You don’t need to stay. Please.”
“You forced him? You made him fight you during his heat? That’s-“ Rogers exhales loudly and his hands shake. “That’s cruel. What you did was cruel.”
"Oh g-god-"
Tony should’ve expected it, but somehow out of everything he’d heard so far, that had been the worst blow. Steve probably thought the same. The team probably did too.
Steve continued to stare at him for a moment. "You're not having any issues?"
“Mostly.” Gabe snickered but it was nowhere near as harsh as before.
“Well. So what if I am? Beats being one of those politicians with a stick up their ass.” Tony sneered through grit teeth and tried to remind himself that punching people here would be a bad idea.
"Then?"
“Aww, you worried about me Hill?” Tony laughed but then steeled his expression. “I know. For once I’m being careful. Actually, scratch that-I’m always careful.”
Happy seemed to shift on his feet a little before giving up and huffing. With quickly burning cheeks, he folded his arms and looked past Tony’s shoulder.
Steve looked at him carefully. Then his mouth parted and his lips fell.
“Steve.” Tony said quickly, holding both hands up and stepping back, bumping against the table as he did. He thought he saw Maria startle and quickly snatch one of the empty wine glasses before it rolled off the edge.
Steve has a question for Tony.
(And Steve. The mixture of all three expressions on his face.)
“To Steve Rogers.” Tony said numbly and he began to drink.
“Oh come now. We both know that’s just a title. I’ve always been in charge of that quadrant.” Pierce smiled, and Tony did his best not to tell him to shove off. Between this guy and Senator Stern, he’d been struggling to keep hold of the suits. If they’d had their way, he’d be under their payroll as an agent being shipped off to far countries till he eventually got blown to hell. He still remembered Stern calling him a prick. That had been fun.
“When you’re ready, well...you give that to me. I’ll earn it back so that you want to give it to me. If that’s what you want.” Steve murmured quietly, eyeing Tony’s hands with a gaze like a hawks.
For ten minutes, Tony pleaded and did everything to get the guy to at least talk to him or hear him out. Eventually the guy just shut the blinder on him and switched off the light. Everything went pitch black except for the neon sign.
"I joined Shield. Just like you asked. I became an agent. Just like you asked. I live on the Helicarrier. Just like you asked. I put on the armor.
Whitney was such a bitch.
"Tony? Are you okay?" Steve asked him quietly and when Tony looked up, he saw the concern in Steve's eyes. It was enough to give him strength.
“In you go. Make sure not to upset him, yes? He’s had a long day.” Whitney cooed as she opened the creaking door. “You know how he gets when he’s tense.”
Feeling his lips curve up into a smirk, Tony turned his head back and sighed.
If he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend it was his building and this was just another day in his life as head of Stark Industries. No financial burdens and no news to catch up on. Just him and his life’s work and the team and Ironman.
Thoroughly confused now, Tony frowned uneasily. “What do you mean?”
“What are you talking about? Your schedule should be free.”
Feeling the blood leave his body, he felt his mind begin to grow sluggish, his fingers tingling with a numbness he only got when he hadn’t had much. Ezekiel had been less giving at the previous session and Tony had needed to remain in his room the next day to prevent exhaustion.
“What?” Steve frowned, and when Tony turned to look at him, he noted the sudden tension in his shoulders. If he could’ve, he would’ve told Steve not to worry. It was probably nothing.
There was nothing to begin with though.
“It’s not your place pet. You’ve upset him you know. The blood he gives is for you. You can’t share otherwise what will everyone think?”
Tony paled at that. All pretenses fell as the realization set in.
“It had to be done.”
He couldn’t have braced himself for the feeling of actually seeing Tony. This was the first time he’d seen Tony in months and Tony was-
“Do you wish to keep the baby, Mr. Stark?” The doctor asks softly and Tony’s grateful when neither Rogers or Ty move a muscle.
“I am already aren’t I?” Tony grinned and behind him Natasha laughed.
“Pick it up J. I’m all ears.” He chirped and set the blowtorch aside to gather the coils on his table. Thankfully they weren’t that heavy.
“Captain? What brings you here?”
Things swam. His vision tripled and he groaned with pain, feeling Norman pull his hands back in one movement.
Tony knelt back on the floor again and rested his palms on his knees. “What is the matter, my lord?”
“I...” Tony thought those hands were shaking a little on his shoulders and instantly Tony wanted to turn and check because if Steve was worried-
“See you around Stark.”
He could feel Maria’s judgement through the line. “You didn’t even hesitate to jump in, did you? The second you thought he was in trouble, you jumped into the suit and threw yourself out there as soon as you could. Because let’s face it, you’re more stubborn than Steve.”
Strangely enough, Tony couldn’t find the head officer. He scanned and scanned for that hat with the emblem when-
"I'm hard work."
“I’m sorry it took me so long.” He bowed his head in apology but somehow, Tony felt Zeke was on the back foot, especially when he laughed nervously and waved the concern away.
“You’re late.” Steve said flatly, and flicked his gaze up at him in question. “You know you’re supposed to start at seven.”
“I’ll take you to him, just take deep breaths.” Norman said behind him and somehow a hand on his shoulder was guiding him in the right direction. Distantly he heard whispers from some of the other members of the family.
Somehow an opportunity had presented itself
Tony felt hands grip his arms tightly, and somehow he was dragged out of the hall and being guided through the corridors. Norman. Norman was taking him.
There was a pause. Steve’s lips twisted downwards and his shoulders slumped in defeat. But Tony wondered if anyone could ever feel like a winner around that.
Registration had taken over their lives. Nothing had been the same since Stafford. Their homes, their friends, their family-it had all been thrown aside for the sake of battling it out over the accords. And Steve was sure, just as Tony was, that he was fighting for the right thing.
“Do you see? Do you see now?” Steve whispered softly and lay down beside him on the bed, leaning over him carefully. “We’re meant to be. Right from the start.”
”I can and I do. And it's
“Sorry, Tony. But Captain America’s more important than you.”
For a moment, no one spoke. They all just stared blankly at him. All except for Ben who was too busy shaking his head with pity.
“He’s the one.” Steve affirmed and Tony frowned, slightly shifting under the scrutiny. Again, it was like he was missing something, but he took comfort in Steve's presence when he clamped two hands down on Tony’s shoulders and squeezed lightly.
“Sorry. That’s not happening.”
“I kept it you know.” Steve whispered quietly, reaching into his back pocket and Tony frowned at the words.
“Tony?” Steve asked, having paused beside his motorbike. He was frowning a little, but relaxed a bit when Tony blinked at him.
“I get it. Smile and wave.” Tony said under a tight-lipped smile because this? This hadn’t been what he’d been expecting. He hadn’t expected to be paraded around like Captain America’s partner. Especially not when Steve didn’t really like him.
"You're a hallucination." Tony says quietly and holds onto this false image of Steve with longing. "I should've known."
Sighing, Tony turned and put his hands on his hips.
“I got rejected today.” Steve said dully, feeling Stark's eyes snap up the second he spoke. “I pressured someone and pushed them away. Now I’m worried they’re never gonna talk to me again.”
Maria opened and closed her mouth a few times. Then her eyes narrowed. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
The baby's blue eyes are warm and familiar, and he scents of apples and vanilla and just a hint of warm coffee. The perfect mix that Tony can’t help but love. He’s perfect.
"No, you can't-"
“Anytime Shellhead. Anytime.”
“Y-yeah...” Tony whispered and felt Steve come around hold his shoulders and then drop down to lift him by his knees. What was happening?
Tony could tell instantly by the scent. The strong, rich scent of forest and sweat flooded his senses, almost throwing him off balance. Werewolves were the only creatures that had a scent strong enough to make vampires stomachs turn.
“Tony, look at me.” Steve said quietly, with a sudden seriousness that caught him off guard. Still, he didn’t dare face Steve. He didn’t want him to see how much he was blinking.
He can barely feel anything. His vision is hazy and all he can see is snow.
The upper doorway slides open to reveal a skylight in the Helicarrier. Then the Ironman armor swoops in like a bullet and lands in a crouching position with a heavy thump.
“I’m so fed up with this evening.” Tony sighed under his breath and let his smile disappear. He couldn’t keep the pretence up any longer. It was better to just deal with it as it was.
“You will eat, sleep and work with them everyday until the work is completed. Do you understand Stark?”
Pulling away, Steve held Tony at arms length and ran his eyes over him. Tony’s eyes were red but his shoulders were loose and his eyes seemed brighter than any of them had seen in the last month.
”Get on with it. You’ve started to fall behind.”
Days started to blend together. He didn't see Carol or any other Avenger after that day. Nor did he hear from her or Steve again.
“I...” Tony doesn’t know what to say. For once in his life, he’s stumped.
Stopped. Because Stark was crying.
The crowd mumbled to themselves quietly, discussing the pros and cons of sending him out. When Tony glanced at the twins, he noticed their eyes were wide with awe and Elijah gave him a quick thumbs up.
Steve sucked in a deep breath and let go. “Losing you because of Ultron, wasn’t worth it. At least not to me.”
“But I want this to work for all of us. I hate the idea of you being out on the field on a different team and I can’t even help you. It’s...not right.”
He looks good, Tony thought, almost miserably as he gleaned the navy blue uniform Steve had donned for his new position. It reminded Tony of the Captain America uniform everyone knew but this one seemed almost...colder in comparison. Formal and full of secrets with nothing else to it.
And Tony didn’t say anything. He just rested his arm on the window and did his best to cover the scarlet on his cheeks with his hand.
He remembered a roar. His vision hazy with things fading in and out of focus. Then suddenly he had been faced with the image of Steve without his cowl, smiling down at him like he’d just survived the war.
The very thought of hearing Steve comment on that sends terror running through his skin. It’s worse than the withdrawal tremors, or the looks he gets that tell him he’s truly fallen below par.
He thinks he used to have pride once. He used to be the one giving, not begging. And yet, here he is.
. Like there would be more to come. Like this was special to them-
Tony sighed in relief but couldn’t ignore the way Fury swore under his breath.
Then he froze. And dropped his hands.
”You damn us all Stark. And I mean, all of us.”
“Yeah, because I really chose to be here, didn’t i?” He mumbled and once again lamented the fact that Steve had locked the door from outside. That was just cruel.
“You’ll get help? You’ll try to stop?”
“Perhaps you should send another to those marked areas? I can’t imagine how irritating it would be to lose those parts of the city to another faction.”
Now it was different, of course.
They go silent after that. Somewhere deep down, Tony really begins to wonder if it’s possible after all.
“Tony?”
Steve was fierce in everything he did. There was always an element of fiery intensity with him, as if he was a volcano on the verge of explosion, though Tony could see why, based on his history as Captain America. The man had been frozen in
Tony was still in the armor, and he hadn’t even bothered to come and talk to him. It had been almost two weeks.
How Steve put up with him was anyone’s guess.
Bossy indeed. He couldn’t help but wonder if next time he should call Steve something good. Who knew what Steve would say if heaven forbid, Tony told him what he actually thought of Steve.
“Nothing. I don’t know what you’re talking about Tony.” He folded his arms, but smiled a little. Probably because he could see Tony floundering.
He couldn’t wait to get started on building them when he was done.
Steve almost,
When Peter laughed, Tony knew he’d passed the invisible test. Taking that as an invitation, Peter edged his body into the room and finally settled down in the seat beside the bed.
In front of him, Thor nodded, looking far too concerned by the empty surroundings.
“He is. But that’s his mother’s eyes right there. Tell me boy, what’s your thoughts on this whole shebang?”
It couldn’t be.
The doctor sighed and pulled away with a grim expression. When he mustered up enough words, he faced Steve calmly and began to explain.
It wasn’t long before the helicopter came to a complete stop on the flight path of the Helicarrier. Once the shuddering came to a stop, Tony waited with a baited breath for the seal to release and the doors to slide open. One by one, they all took their headphones off and climbed out. As soon as his feet touched the ground, he started looking around carefully.
“His pain threshold is higher.” Steve said darkly, eyes flickering between Tony and the medics. “That already means he’s gonna feel more pain down the bond.”
Only at the beginning. And only because he hadn’t known Steve.
“Iron man, has anyone ever told you how incredible you are?” Steve panted, taking a glove off to rub his eyes and get rid of the dirt.
“No, nothing. Just...fine.” Tony blew out a breath and looked around. The ballroom was pretty much full and it looked like things were about to start. The president's speech would be up soon. “I’ll stay.”
“Aren’t what?”
“I ha-have something.” Tony says softly through chattered teeth. The man turns back to him and stares at him with a narrow look and though his eyes trace over Tony’s face, he doesn’t let that bother him. He doesn’t know why but it’s important he do this. It’s important he lets them know.
“We’re here.” Steve said, prompting Tony to uncurl his fingers from Steve’s waist. He’d clutched on for dear life because boy, did Steve like to go fast!
“What?”
He had to try.
A quiet groan pulled him out of his thoughts and when he turned, he was met with a soft, sleepy grin on Steve’s face. Steve was looking at him like he’d just woken up from a dream.
“What’s a pureblood?” Steve asked behind him and startled, Tony turned and met his eye.
Rhodey arrives at the tower as War machine within twenty minutes, during which time Tony is busy trying to calm his racing heart and aching body. Ty is with him but isn't much help, too busy demanding the ambulance hurry up.
“Maria, why are you telling me this?”
Tony blinked and tilted his head. “My temperature?”
If Tony hadn’t had years of experience being a public figure, he would’ve gaped at the suggestion.
“I’ve loved you for years. You heard that asshole tell his story but now it’s time for mine. You and I fought in New York together. We lived together for two years with the rest of the team visiting on and off. Last year I asked you if you would do me the honor of letting me court you as my promised omega and you said yes. Months ago we shared your first heat and you said you wanted us to bond. We also started trying for a baby because we both agreed we wanted to together. You’re pregnant now and we’re going to have a family. It was all planned and-“
“Shhhh.” Steve leaned down and breathed into his ear. “I’ve seen you do this before. It’s the same. C’mon Tony, give it to me.”
“Steve, I just don’t know if I should be here. There’s a lot we have behind us.”
At the familiar sound, Tony hunched over and scrubbed at his eyes harshly before turning with a tight smile. It wouldn’t be fair to ruin other people’s evenings because of his issues. He had to at least try and keep up appearances.
“Hush now. You are so kind aren’t you? I understand Anthony but the rules are clear? What happens when you break them?”
“Yes, thank you.”
That was until something shot at him. And cut right through his body with a deadly aim.
It was true. If Steve really had hired him just to get him nearer...
The man had spun around at the last second, nostrils flared and teeth bared as a warning. And as soon as he made eye contact with Tony, two realizations hit.
Then he did something absolutely unheard of. Something that set all the vampires off in a wave of hissing and snarling.
Tony shrieked with horror, wiping his hand over his wet throat frantically.
Turned out he was wrong.
“Hopefully never.”
“Sure, that sounds nice. Why not?” Tony agreed quietly, feeling slightly awed at the way Steve was starting to go red. Why was he so nervous? Tony honestly couldn’t make sense of it.
." Tony said firmly and wrapped one of his arms tight around his waist to keep himself upright. Not that it mattered much anyway.
He felt his lips curve into a plastic smile. “Well maybe you’d be thankful anyone wanted you at all. Second is still better than none.”
He hadn’t known about the set mealtimes. It was only when he turned up to the cafeteria and saw the janitors cleaning up, that he found out. And had missed breakfast.
Tony frowned at the tone. If it hadn’t been for the headphones, he would’ve thought the guy didn’t like him. But of course, it was so loud up in the air, he couldn’t be sure.
It took only a day for the contract to reach him, and Tony knew instantly that Steve had planned this for a while. It was well thought out, covered several deals, and was of mutual benefit for both of them. It was fair, just like Steve promised.
”I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.” Ty explains gently and leans his chin on one hand and considers Tony. “I have nothing against it if that’s what you want.”
For a second he struggled to formulate words. Then-
“You need to see a doctor. You’ve lost weight.” Carol says to him. Three months after the funeral, Tony gets visitors on the Helicarrier. Sam, Carol and Pepper have come to see him and it turns out Maria invited them. So now, all four of them have pulled him aside and want to talk to him. Apparently they’re worried and so are a few other Shield agents.
Tony shook his head. “Nothing. All went well my lord.”
It was a watch.
For a moment the room goes quiet in thought. Then Ty tilts his head and smiles. “Your Ironman suit.”
“Tony-“
“Did you know about me before you met me?” He wasn’t sure he wanted to know but the words poured out.
“Don’t tell me my feelings aren’t real, Tony.” Steve suddenly growled and Tony stiffened for a second before looking up to meet Steve’s fierce expression. Somehow, even bed-bound Steve was managing to shift him onto the back-foot. Something about Steve was always in control even after being tossed into the air by an army of bots. Or taking a dozen plus bullets for his friend.
“Don’t get yourself killed helping Steve. Because while you won’t remember it, he’ll always remember it. Just like he still remembers the SHRA and almost killing you. Don’t give him more to relive.”
“Tony, leave it. That’s not why we’re here. We’re on a date and I chose this restaurant for the night. Something quick and easy, you know?” Steve said with a tight, pointed smile and Tony flushed with anger and humiliation.
“Y-you’re here.” Tony whispers hoarsely. “I-I can’t believe you’re...”
To fight me. “No idea Captain Commando.”
It hurts to think about being so close to someone else. Tony doesn’t think it’s possible but as he lies there in the directors suite in the dark with his eyes wide open and bloodshot with fatigue and a misplaced sense of grief (
"I love you." Tony says quietly and Steve stills before letting out a gasp and squeezing him tighter.
“Yes, the crews all here. Made yourself comfortable yet, Stark?” Ben said lightly but for some reason, the two blond guys behind him snickered, and the agents at the back started to giggle. Strange since he hadn’t even done anything to make anyone laugh yet.
“I’d do anything for you too.” Steve whispered gently and Tony's eyes widened when Steve pressed another kiss to his hair.
“Still, I know now is an odd time and maybe you’d rather have more time to get to know Ty, but I have one last request. Won’t you humor me once more my pet?” Zeke smiled warmly, as if Tony was blessed to be doing him a favor, or that he lived to make Zeke happy.
“Sir, the Captain has arrived and is requesting access.”
Two; he was not a human. Not even close. He was a werewolf and a very strong one at that.
“He says I talk about you too much. Or something. I don’t know.” Tony shrugged and with a sigh, tilted his head back and closed his eyes. The world felt distant and he was happy to stay here and pretend just for five minutes that Steve was still his. That this was just a romantic night out that had ended in them being caught in the rain. Instead, he was debating whether it was better to use his situation to escape from Ty and run away or use it to seal the nail in the wall and say goodbye to the man he actually loved.
“Mr. Stark. Do you remember anything about before? Does any of this feel familiar to you?”
“My...” God, did he really want to discuss his new boyfriend with his old one? Hadn’t that caused him to be stuck in this situation in the first place?
“Not right now. But after this.” Steve puffed up his chest and plucked the bread basket out of the stunned waiter’s hand to offer it to Tony. “Bread?”
A knock on the door pulled him away from his thoughts. Unsurprisingly, both doctors walked in, and Steve quickly followed them. All three of them settled beside his bed.
Tony let his hand fall and stared at the stain tiredly. Who cared anyway? Who exactly was he trying to impress?
Nodding, Tony stepped in. His dark eyes scanned the walls, glancing at the ornate portrait of Zeke and his father Obadiah. The selected pose was that of father and son, stood side by side, their eyes staring straight ahead with a look of solemnity.
Together they walk to the bedroom and Tony isn’t sure why he’s surprised when Roger’s knows exactly which room it is and Jarvis lets him in without question.
Thank you so much for your patience. This one took some time but the words finally arrived.
“Sam!” Steve said sharply into his com and out of a separate portal emerged Sam and Carol, with their arms outstretched. And Steve ran forward.
. That my alpha and I have been trying for months. That must mean I have an alpha that loves me right?” Tony begs and he doesn’t know why but he needs to know, he needs to hear it. He’s so afraid of the idea that he’s become one of those omegas that doesn’t have an alpha-that was just used and left behind to become another statistic.
The sight of the blue-eyed brunette irritated Steve. Because of Mr.Stark’s lack of consideration, Iron man had barely any time to rest and relax. Recuperation was important, regardless of superhuman strength, Steve knew. Fights could take it out of you.
“Oh my poor pet. She hurt you didn’t she?”
Fury picked up a pen and began to scribble something, much to Tony’s irritation. “Nothing. You do nothing. You go, you socialise a bit. Leave the rest to Rogers.” He turned a page, not once looking at Tony.
“Don’t be.” He wasn’t. Whatever he felt about Sharon, that wouldn’t stop him from caring about Tony. “It wasn’t going to work.”
“Before you say anything, he’s still alive but-“
He spun on his heels and walked back the way he came, biting his lip to keep from saying something he’d regret. But then-
“Time to wake up Tony.” Steve roused him gently, putting a hand on his shoulder to shake him a little. “You need to eat.”
“You let me stay with you. You let an alpha stay with you when you were most vulnerable. That’s bravery.” Steve continued softly, beginning to rub Tony’s nape gently. “I couldn’t have done it.”
Steve’s eyes widened when he saw the metal. Then his hands clenched and something burned in his eyes.
“I didn’t.” Steve said firmly into Tony’s ear, ensuring Tony would not be able to ignore it.
“...Please...ple-
Steve loved him. He always has. That’s why the mind-swipe and the lying had hurt so much.
“And seeing as we have such fine heroes...” Pierce uncurled the fingers around his glass and pointed in Steve’s direction, ignoring Steve’s frown. “I just don’t see where you might fit into the chain of command.”
Standing up, Tony scratched absently at his neck, feeling it throb in time with his heart. It felt fitting that this last mark of Steve’s hurt so much. Hopefully by the time he got back, it would’ve healed and he’d be able to forget. Leave it in the past where it belongs.
"Remind me to show you sometime." Steve breathed against his skin and without wasting another minute, wrapped his lips around the tip of his cock.
It tasted of iron and salt. Metallic. His own scent, and a hint of Steve.
"I wanted to ask you something. About the morning after." Steve broke the silence that had settled between them.  Something in his voice made Tony realize this was important.
“When was the last time you looked at your body? When was the last time you actually checked?”
“I-I know you don’t trust me-or you’ve-you’ve never been a fan-“ Coughs wrack his body and he faces to one side to avoid afflicting Steve. He’s always been difficult and infected so why should he put that on Steve?
A wave of pride coursed through Tony's body. Pleased, he lowered his eyes to give himself a moment  to catch his breath when-
“You can’t be saved Tony. Some people just can’t be.”
“What!?”
His face was covered in pink streaks. Triple lines running across his cheeks and sideways, leading all the way down to his jaw. And the bite underneath was red and swollen, the indents of Steve’s mouth prominent and shiny against Tony’s skin.
Some time past as they began to twist and turn. Steve guided him backwards and forwards and Tony let him do it all, more because he was just so surprised to see Steve  so confident in something so different to his work. It was definitely something new.
Tony spoke faster, all thoughts that he wanted to discuss his discovery vanished and panic took over. “I really screwed up but I promise, as soon as we’re back, I’ll be sure to never bring it up again and I won’t shout at you again- Hell, I'll even be more careful in the suit if that'll make you-“
The men glanced at each briefly. Then one replied.
“No.” Steve blinked, feeling his eyes glisten. “Even though he fully expected me to. By the looks of it.”
“Yeah, well that’s what you are, puppy.”
Steve caught his hand in his own and wrapped his fingers around it, guiding it lower until he could see Tony's face completely. Tony's dark brown hair was sticking up in odd angles from the roughhousing and his deep blue eyes, god, they were
Tony blinks and tries for a smile.
“You better stop now before I tear you to pieces.” Rogers says and smiles dangerously when Ty jerks back.
“He’s gone really pale. Maybe we should lie him down.”
“Oh come now!” Ezekiel laughed and batted at Whitney playfully, though Tony saw no humor in their apparent joke. “Anthony, bring yourself over, let me have a look at you, it’s been a fortnight!”
Tony could vaguely remember a time where it hadn’t been like this. When Thor and Jan and Rhodey and so many others had stood beside him as he donned his suit and saved the world. He’d been Iron man and even Steve had-
me. We have no business doing this. And you of all people should not be involved-“
“Why do you care?” Tony snapped and folded his arms as he faced him. “It’s not like you actually want to deal with me. And It’s not like Steve actually enjoys talking to me. Everyone time we speak, we just don’t click. And every time I think I’m helping, he snaps. What’s the point?” He sighed and threw up his hands helplessly, spilling the water from his glass all over his arm.
His hand closed around the piece tightly. The sharp edge dug into his glove, hard.
“Tony!”
The lawyers guided them to a nearby room with a small round table and a few plastic white chairs and waited for them to get seated before turning and closing the door behind them. Then it was just them and the clock on the wall ticking. Nothing else made a sound, not even them.
“I’M TIRED! I’M SO TIRED! NONE OF YOU GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ME AND NOT ONE OF YOU CARES WHETHER I LIVE OR DIE! SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!” He screamed feeling his head spin and his heart pound. Tears leaked down his face as the emotions finally fell. He was starting to feel detached from his body and the pain was starting to feel like a distant memory.
With slow steps, Steve placed the bag on the floor and sat on the bed. His hands twitched but he kept still, simply taking in the sight of Tony finally resting without tossing or turning.
After all, he’d been the one to scream Tony’s name that night. Not her.
“Tell me how it happened. You said we haven’t bonded yet.”
“Very well Captain. I agree that it is best to look. Have caution.” Thor replied and with a final nod, began to run in the opposite direction. Steve was alone for now.
“But it’s not alright!” Tony cried loudly, pulling his hands away to let Zeke see the exhaustion in his eyes. That wasn't a lie. “I have let you down and there’s nothing worse-“
” Tony sneered and tilted his chin towards the man. “The guy can’t even get the hair right.”
Steve chanted in his head as he began to stretch.
Steve was helping him with his fitting. That was all he was doing. Nothing else.
And really, Tony couldn’t argue with that.
“Thanks.” He whispered, feeling sluggish. It was harder to muster up more energy and Tony figured the blood loss had something to do with it. He was weirdly cold so even the heat from Steve’s arm felt nice.
think...I deserve to be in hell?”
That explained the bandages covering his body. He could feel the telltale itch of the material around his arms and legs, and something ached in his torso when he shifted.
Other than Steve of course.
This was closest they’d been since Siberia. It wasn’t fair.
"You-" Steve opened and closed his mouth before glaring at Tony. He looked furious.
Behind Steve was the billboard of that puppy. And somewhere along these streets was the lamp-post Tony has become so fond of.
Just as he took the suit, all neatly pressed and wrapped in a clothes protector, and began to turn, Happy stopped him with a hand on his wrist.
Tony glanced at the men and women beside him who were staring forward with perfect poker faces and ram-rod backs. They were perfect military.
Sucking in a deep breath, he steeled his nerves and walked towards them. This was his team now. He had to make it work.
did you see the look on her face Whitney!? That’s the way to do it, plain and simple. Pin them down and let them squirm. Then you strike!”
“I have.” He answers quietly.
“Boys, have you been good while I was away?”
Looking back, Tony should’ve known then how things would pan out. But at that moment, all he felt was shame.
“Werewolves always turn on a full moon, as you’re aware I’m sure. But generally they don’t turn otherwise except for when things get heated. Adrenaline needs to run high to push for a morph.”
“Oh not at all Mr.Stark! You seem to be doing such a good job, all by yourself.” Stern said, looking smug as the laughs behind him grew. Tony’s hands curled and he let his lips curve up.
Suddenly it was like there was a stone in his throat and he could barely swallow. His eyes stung as he realized that he was right.
“Yes Stark.” He hummed, still writing things down.
“I never said that.” Tony smiled despite himself but Steve wasn’t sold.
At that, Steve just paused and looked at him. Then he slowly shook his head.
“Shhhh my pet, it’s alright-“
Well, he couldn’t have that. He gave a wobbly smile. It was the best he could really give after what had just happened.
“I found this place a while ago. Reminded me of you.”
“Mr. Stark, oh, I’m so sorry, let me.” Senator Stern said sweetly, pulling out a napkin to dab at the nasty wine stain that was now soaking the front of his suit. Really, could the evening get any worse?
“Oh, so you don’t want free seconds? Maybe desert or-“
The air changed behind him and he sucked in a sharp breath, mentally preparing for the worst. What was wrong, why was-
Shaking his head a little, he tilted the suit to check the back before blowing out a breath and nodding. He could do this. He would do this.
Tony longed to tell him everything. About Ty and Whitney and Zeke and his life before he ever met Steve. How being able to leave the cavern and meet Steve and this empty neighborhood with that dog billboard and those lamp-posts was the best thing that had ever happened to him.
