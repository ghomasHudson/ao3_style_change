Steve grunted when her fist connected with his stomach, more startled than hurt, and watched as she danced out of his reach.  “Natasha Romanov, did you just pull your punch?” he asked, incredulous.
, however, in a way that few things in his life did any more.
Natasha lifted one eyebrow eloquently, looking first at the bag then back at Steve.  “Is that what this is?” she asked, laughter in her voice taking the off sharp edge.  She let go of the bag and stretched her arms out, popping her knuckles at the terminus of her stretch.  “Want to give something a try that can hit back?”
“At least some things haven’t changed,” Steve offered.
Steve hesitated, his hand hovering as he looked at Tony, seeking permission.  Tony nodded almost imperceptibly, eyes on Steve’s, and Steve traced the edge as he had before.  He sighed, covering the arc reactor so that the blue light came between his fingers, and leaned his forehead against Tony’s.  “We never knew what happened — you just disappeared.  Bucky had just come home and gone in to check on you.  A minute later, he went back in and you were just — gone.  I was glad he was home when it happened, because he would have never believed me if I’d told him that.  He’d’ve thought I was lying to him, that you’d — died — or left.”
Wordlessly, Steve offered Tony a clean tank top and undershirt, both dark enough to hide the light from the arc reactor, as well as clean pajama pants.  He dressed Tony slowly, and the process left Tony feeling light-headed and breathing hard.
“I think that’s when I first realized I loved him,” Steve said, feeling his cheeks warm at the admission.  “He told me they’d find a cure for my heart problems.  I thought he was lying to me.”  Steve sighed and found Natasha looking down at him intently, her green eyes unblinking.
“Both of my parents died in a car crash,” Tony finally offered, cutting across the sounds of the sloshing water.  “I was twenty-one.”
“No,” Bucky said, moving closer to fiddle with the tuning dial.  The radio screeched into static, and it took a moment for Tony to realize Bucky was drowning out their conversation as he pretended to search for a station.  “She has tuberculosis — she’s in a special ward for it.  They trade letters because he can’t go see her.”
“Oh, Morgan asked me to visit,” Tony answered vaguely, waving a hand back towards the museum.  “Then she kicked me out so she could get some work done.  I hope she doesn’t use that move on Pepper — she’s likely to get a poor response,” he added with a weak laugh.
?  Then he’d fall asleep and wake up on the couch in his workshop, with no memory of how he’d gotten home.  But even though he understood it to be his workshop, he didn’t really recognize it.  Jarvis had stopped answering, and Dum-E never brought him smoothies any more.  None of his equipment was there, even if he was too sick to use it.
He found he missed Steve: their easy closeness, the way they’d shared space, the touches that seemed out of place in this century.  It also made him think of the apartment, the hot bath, and Steve putting him to bed, protecting him the only way he knew how by hiding the arc reactor.
Steve made his way home after meeting Dr. Erskine, head and heart heavy as he tried to sort through the day.  He was still sore from his encounter in the alley, and he had scrapes over his arms from where he’d been knocked down.  He stripped out of his jacket and shirt, and the specter of Tony seemed to follow Steve around the apartment as he got cleaned up.  His chest ached both from the fight and the emotion, and Steve couldn’t help but wonder what Tony would have thought of it all — Bucky off to war with the 107th, the chance Dr. Erskine had offered.
Steve released a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding and felt winded, like he was back at Camp LeHigh trying to run around the track.  The rest of the setup passed in a blur for Steve, and before he knew it, the serum was injected, and the capsule was closed.
“If it makes you feel better, I didn’t think I could have this either,” Tony said, continuing their earlier conversation as if they’d never left off.  He handed Steve a glass of sparkling water, which he took automatically, taking a long drink from it before realizing what Tony had done.  “I had Pepper, but only for short time because she didn’t like the whole risking your life thing.  I have Rhodey, but it’s not the same.  And then I had you, in the past.  It just turns out I need both you
“You won’t believe it, but I just got off the train.  Got in from,” Tony floundered for a moment, before thinking of Barton and blurting out, “Iowa.  Iowa City.”  He looked down the alley and back again before grimacing.  “Guy must have taken my luggage too,” he added.
Steve shook his head, stepping back inside to grab his vest with his badge on it and his belt, his two guns hanging from the sides.  The cold night air hit him like a slap in the face as he walked out the back door, and he wrapped his arms around himself, trying to hold onto the last vestiges of warmth he carried with him from his room.  By the time he stepped off the porch, Natasha had already disappeared back into her own cabin, presumably to warm up in the bed she shared with Bucky.  Following the faint strains, Steve realized it was a Christmas carol that Stark was singing — somewhat off key — at the top of his lungs.
Tony knew, intellectually, that it wasn’t Steve’s fault, but it still felt like he’d ruined a good thing.
He thought of Steve’s eating habits back at the tower, and suddenly Tony could see it as clearly as if he were there to see the whole thing.  Bucky — or Steve, for that matter — would get paid, and they would buy groceries.  Things with a good shelf life with as many nutrients as they could pack into it, food that would last them until the next paycheck.  They would probably celebrate a little, have a big meal with something special.  Meat, maybe, or fresh fruit or vegetables.  Their supplies would dwindle, and they would do their best to augment their food where they could.  Maybe do some odd jobs for a friend?  Sneak some food from someone at work?  Trade a picture or homemade card with someone who worked in the bakery downstairs?  They would then cut back, making what food was left last until the next payday.
One afternoon, he came into the common area after working down in his workshop.  He was in an excellent mood — the upgrades for the Stark OS were coming along nicely, and Pepper had told him that there were a couple of green energy contracts that they were close to signing.  He was two weeks out from his last board meeting with at least three weeks until the next one, and for once it was looking like he might have some good news for them.  He was even caught up on his paperwork for Pepper and had answered all his critical emails.  He wandered into the kitchen in the common area to make himself a smoothie — he was even being responsible and feeding himself without Jarvis having to remind him, thank you very much — and then wandered out to the living area to find Steve on the couch, Ella Fitzgerald crooning in the background.
Steve just wished he knew how to do that.
Tony helped him wash, knowing that Steve would regret it for the rest of his life if he showed up at the church dirty and disheveled.  He lathered up the soap and washed Steve’s hair, wishing he had shampoo and conditioner.  He tried to rub Steve’s back soothingly as he washed his torso.  Steve was like a small child, compliantly moving as directed but offering no help himself.  The smell of Steve’s sweat and grief faded, lost in the damp smell of the humid room and Ivory soap.
“They don’t pay you by the word — I don’t need the bond salesmen spiel,” he answered easily.  “How did it go?  ‘Each bond is a bullet in your best guy’s gun.’”
Bucky looked at him for a long time before getting up from his chair.  “I was skeptical about you,” he said, squeezing Tony’s shoulder.  “But you’re a good friend to him — and to me.”
Steve was dimly aware as Tony maneuvered them both to the couch, and his legs gave out when Tony pulled away just enough to lie down.  The sobs came for a long time, and Steve gave up trying to parse through all his emotions: relief foremost, and love, but also the release of fear, loneliness, exhaustion.  The loss of his life and his family and his friends, his teammates and his purpose.  It dawned on him that he might be able to build a life here — at least with Tony’s help.
Tony was starting to wonder where exactly he was on that timeline.
They came to a large brick building, an old factory that had been repurposed into apartments with huge windows facing the water, the lights starting to come on in the late afternoon light.  Steve walked up the stairs and punched in a code.  The door clicked open, leading to a small staircase.  Steve let Tony go first and set the pace up the stairs, for which Tony was grateful — his right leg never was quite as good as the left after that final battle.  Another door with another code, and then Tony was in Steve’s home.
Natasha, bless her, came to his rescue.  “That’s not what Tony means.  Is it, Tony?”
“Uh, guys?  I could use a little back-up,” Tony sub-vocalized over the comms, feeling panic start to rise within him.
“I don’t think he likes you much,” Steve said.
“There’s not a thing in the world I can’t fix,” Tony challenged back.  “Starting with your radio.”
“I don’t think they’re allowed to do that,” Tony managed.
Epilogue
Today was the day — the last day, at least for one person.
“What?” Steve interrupted, shocked.  “What did you say?”
Steve recognized this because he was putting on his own version of that show.  Instead of the bond salesman performance, Steve had the I’m Adjusting Just Fine show.
And when the weight of everything that had happened was too much, when the press of history — both that he’d lived and that he’d missed — was too heavy, he left and rode west.
There was freshly fallen snow on the ground, and it continued to fall, the fat flakes swirling around him as the wind blew down the street.  Steve shivered from the cold, and he could see there were no fresh footprints leading from the building.
When it was finally just Tony and him, Steve turned off the TV and slumped down further into the cushions.  He felt wrung out but still on high alert, hyperaware of Tony as he wandered around the common area.  The old fear was back, that Tony would disappear again, even though Steve now had all the pieces to explain what had happened so long ago, so many lifetimes in the past.
Tony opened his mouth, but absolutely nothing came out.  Gone was the man who’d rescued him in the alley.  Gone was the man who challenged other, bigger men to fights because they were being assholes.  There was no bravado or challenge, no desire to prove something to Tony.  Only earnestness and vulnerability, a sincerity that was almost painful to see.  Steve understood his place in the world; he understood the assumptions that other people made about him because of the way he looked, for all that he spent every waking minute fighting against it.  The only thing in his expression now was a glimmer of hope, the potential for a shot he’d never known he could have.
Steve felt his knees buckle at the sight, and he slumped to the floor.  He could tell at first glance it wasn’t a real milk crate — it was clearly something designed by some company to look like an antique.  But it reminded him strongly of the one he’d used to keep his art supplies in next to the drafting table that he had been so proud of.
An old fashioned notion, he’d called it.
They rode in silence for a few moments.  In a whirlwind of movement, Natasha turned on Steve and poked him in the chest, hard.   “He’s not going to die,” she snapped, emphasizing each word with another poke to his sternum.  Steve just sighed.
The ritual of the service washed over Tony, and he felt as though he was lost in time, caught between the memory of his own parents’ funerals and the one he was currently attending.  Howard hadn’t been religious, of course, but he’d laid in state at the Capitol for his service to the United States.  There had been a funeral at the National Cathedral for Howard, but Tony only remembered seeing the Space Window when he came in and left and staring at the stained glass windows over the altar at the front of the church.
“What?  Tony?” Steve answered.  “Seen him?  What do you mean?”
Steve stepped away from the counter, and he tried not to look at Tony’s face as he moved past — he really did — but he saw the desperation, the pain and fear in Tony’s eyes.
It was enough to help him find a way to get back up again.
He reached Denver, where the mountains rose up from the plains, dominating the western edge of the city.  Steve followed I-70, winding his way through small mountain towns, snow still on the peaks even in May.  He took Loveland Pass and stood on what felt like the top of the world at the continental divide.  He detoured off I-70 towards Leadville, taking the highway north to what remained of Camp Hale.  Steve spent a long time contemplating the signs that warned hikers about the historic military weapons area and looking at the concrete structures jutting up from the valley floor.  He said a silent prayer for the brave men he’d met of the 10th Mountain Division, whom the Howling Commandos had assisted in Italy near Nago-Tarbole in 1944.  He could feel Bucky’s presence at his shoulder, also paying his respects.
Steve took a few deep, shuddering breaths, running a hand over his face.  “I thought I would feel better being here,” he said, “but I — I don’t think I can do this.”  He stood and took a few unsteady steps towards the door before he half-turned, his body partially towards Tony but his head still facing away.  “I’m sorry.”  His bulk blocked out the light from the hall for a moment, and then he was gone.
“I tink he broke ba dose,” the guy wailed, pulling his bloody hands away to inspect them.
“Did you know, I can remember them building the Chrysler building?” Steve cut him off.  He didn’t want to hear it.  He knew Tony was sorry — Steve had seen it in his face before he’d left the room, and he didn’t really feel up to reconciling the difference between this Tony and his from before.  This Tony was unhappy and stressed, quick to decide he needed to fix things that weren’t really problems.  Steve could tell that this Tony was used to screwing up, to upsetting people.
And the reaction this Tony expected was dismissal.  Rejection.  Blame and recrimination.
“For emergencies,” Steve echoed, his tone hollow.  He grabbed his glass and tipped it, watching the golden liquid coat the side.
“Did you look at his file at all?”  Natashas fingers paused, her hand warm against his hair.
Cap, however,  Cap was always there.
The Red Skull was an opportunity, and Steve was going to take it.
The only thing that remained intact was his mind.  And on the 71st day in the hospital, he decided he didn’t want to live that way any more.  His last request was to go outside one more time.  He’d grown up in the Adirondacks, spending more time outside than in as a child, and he wanted to feel the sun on his face and the wind in his hair one last time before he died in the ICU.
— and not for the first time, Steve wondered what Tony had known.  Was this what Tony meant?  This experimental program being run through the military?
As the silence hung between them at that observation, Tony shoved his hands in his pockets, letting out his breath slowly.
“Well, if you do it again, I promise to find you faster this time.  Ten, twenty years tops.”
The blue light flared to life, shining through the chest plate, and the suit jerked under his hands.  Steve heard Tony take a deep, gasping breath even though the external speakers didn’t transmit the sound.  “Oh, thank God,” Steve choked out as Tony rolled away and onto all fours.  Leaning back onto his knees, Tony released his helmet.  He yanked it off and flung it away, greedily sucking in the air.
“I hope he did, Steve.  I really do.”  Bucky threw his arm around Steve and gave him a squeeze.
Tony pushed that thought aside.  He wasn’t sure how he got here — beside magic — and he certainly didn’t have any great ideas at the moment on how to get back.  It was a big enough problem to get clothes that he could wear without attracting an unreasonable amount of attention and money to eat and provide himself shelter, even if that ended up being pulling his weight with Bucky and Steve.
“I’m just a friend,” Tony interrupted.
And sometimes, so deep into the night he knew it was only a short time before the sky started to lighten again in the east, heralding the arrival of morning, he thought of Tony.  Steve would think about the bravery it had taken for Tony to get that thing implanted in his chest, wondering what kind of terrible injury could cause shrapnel to be embedded so far into his chest that he needed such a thing.  He’d wonder where Tony had come from and if he’d gone back there.  He would close his eyes, lying on the narrow bunk, and think of Tony pulling him into his chest: the warm comfort of his body, the support of his knees behind Steve’s, the warm metal of the disk pressing into his back.
“Look, I know we’re not very close,” Steve ground out, every word like a stab to his heart.  He leaned forward in the chair, his elbows back on his knees, put his head in his hands, and looked at the floor.  He knew he’d never be able to get through this if he looked at Tony.  “But if you don’t mind, I’d rather not talk to the doctor and just stay here.  It’ll make me feel better.  It’s not like I’ll sleep if I go back to my room anyway, knowing you’re here.”
“I don’t remember,” Tony said, although that didn’t seem quite right either.
“Close enough,” was Tony’s only reply.
“What are you working on?” Tony asked, moving to look over Steve’s shoulder.
Steve felt his mouth open, but he wasn’t fast enough.  He was back in an alley in Brooklyn again, and the other guy was drawing back his arm for the punch.  He knew it was going to hurt.  He knew it in his bones the same way he knew where his hand needed to be to catch his shield when it came back to him.  He just didn’t know where, exactly, Tony was going to hit him.
Steve took the sketchbook back and opened it back up.  They looked at the pictures he’d drawn of Tony together.  “I asked him if it would fix my heart,” Steve said after a few minutes of silence as they looked through the drawings.
In fact, it seemed that Bucky assumed the mugging was some kind of cover to give Steve a reason to bring Tony home to meet Bucky.  Tony could have laughed at the absurdity of it, if Bucky weren’t about to kick his ass over the misunderstanding.  The story was most certainly a cover, but Steve hadn’t come up with it and it wasn’t to cover up a homosexual encounter.
“Here,” Tony said, digging out the monitor in the pocket of his pajama pants — he always insisted on pants when they made him stay — and hit the button to activate it.  It showed his heart rate, last blood pressure, EKG tracing, and oxygen saturation in brightly colored numbers and lines.  “See?  Perfectly normal.  A phrase no one has ever applied to me, I can promise you.”
,” he repeated, but Steve knew he wasn’t fooling anyone, least of all himself.
Natasha snorted.  “But it’s not the death sentence you’re thinking of.”
Steve laughed for a moment, delighted at the thought of having someone to do these kinds of spontaneous things with, someone who could help fill the sometimes endless hours in the tower.  “What if I want to run first?” he challenged, just to see what her reaction was.
Steve snatched his hand away, and Tony saw tears in his eyes before he turned away, his expression angry.  “You can’t know that.  You’re full of shit.”
Steve blinked slowly.  It took him a long time to muster up the words before he asked, “How long did it hurt?”
There were cars on the street, but they were also all wrong — the bodies too boxy, no seatbelts to be seen, all of them jerking as they were shifted from gear to gear, the exhaust black from the tail pipes.   Tony looked down the street to see the buildings, most of which were brick.  They were all too short.  He could see a few billboards, all of which looked cartoony to him with the same bright color palettes.  One was even for cigarettes.
He wasn’t sure the argument with Bucky had been worth it though.
The music filled the room, and Steve pictured the apartment, with the couch and his ma’s radio, the afghans on the back of the couch, the drawing table and the twin beds.  It was where Tony had slept for the first time, where he’d taught Tony to darn socks and listened to the radio, where he’d showed Bucky the drawings of the arc reactor and spent his last night with him before he went to war. He opened his eyes, just a little, and saw the blue light of the arc reactor coming through the cotton.
Steve tried to fight Bucky, sure that if he could just stay out there long enough he would figure out where Tony had gone.  It wasn’t much of a contest though; Bucky was bigger and stronger, not to mention that he’d been eating and sleeping better.  Bucky dragged him back up the stairs as Steve fought him on each landing, looking for Tony on each floor.  Once back in their apartment, Bucky made Steve finish drying off and get dressed.
“I needed to get away —“
Reaching into his pajama pocket, Steve pulled out the slim silver band with a small emerald set in it.  His ma had told him it was the only piece of jewelry she was able to bring from Ireland when she fled after fighting in the Easter Rising.  He’d carried it with him ever since Tony had given it to him.  The St. Monica medal was his to wear for the rest of his life, and the calla lily pin he’d given back to her, a token of her time in the
“Tony is in need of a suit, but I was hoping to propose a trade.  You’re, what?  Three weeks out from getting them done when you can do it in one with your overlock machine?”  Bucky threw an arm around Enzo’s shoulder, and Enzo rolled his eyes and grinned, clearly enjoying the attention despite the show.
Steve continued to talk about the Chrysler building as he looked out the window.  He tried to find a connection with Tony, some kind of common ground for them.  He could sense Tony at his side, feel the warmth radiating off him.  He tried to reconcile the two men he had known, the harder, flintier one here with him now versus the one he had gotten to know before.  Something had to change — there had to be some kind of give.  Steve just didn’t know what it was yet.
“Why doesn’t he like having his face wet?”  He looked up at her, earnest.
Steve considered calling him, but he discarded the idea almost as soon as it occurred to him.  Had Tony even travelled back to 1939 yet?  Would he even make it back to 2012 after he disappeared from Steve’s bed in 1940?  Had Shield notified him that Steve had been found, that he was alive and awake?
Steve failed to reappear, and Tony became restless.  He walked up a hill and down another, where he found Steve sitting under a tree, his elbows on his knees with his head bowed.  Tony sat down next to him, and Steve shifted, putting his head on Tony’s shoulder.  Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulders and pulled him closer.  It was then that Steve turned and buried his face into Tony’s chest, the sobs that wouldn’t come all day rising up to be muffled by the wool of Tony’s jacket.
Tony’s hands were warm on Steve’s face, and he drew him down to kiss him gently, first on the lips and then on each tear-stained cheek.  Steve gasped, his tears turning to sobs.  Steve pulled Tony closer until they were pressed against each other, from chest to hips to knees.  He buried his face in the curve of Tony’s neck, the sobs coming faster.
All of the stress of the day, the anxiety of the experimental procedure and everything he’d had to do, every hoop he’d had to jump through ramped up when he looked over to see a face that looked both so very familiar and so very different at the same time.  The hair color was the same, but Howard’s lacked the wave of Tony’s.  They had the same bone structure and eyes, and Steve had a hard time tearing his own gaze away.  Howard’s mouth lifted up at the corner in a smirk, like he was laughing at a private joke, and Steve felt like he’d taken a punch to the gut.  It was like the ghost of Tony had followed him from the barracks where he’d haunted Steve the night before and taken on corporal form based only on a description of what Tony looked like.  The rough features were the same, and many of them were very close — but it wasn’t quite right.
But there was no letter.  The next day, her cough had worsened. The day after that, she started coughing up blood.  The day after that — the day before Tony visited to get the letter that wasn’t there and instead was given her wedding band, her St. Monica medal, and her calla lily pin — she bled into her lungs and either drowned from the blood or hemorrhaged to death.
“It would have been worth it.”
Clint’s smile is bright and warm, and Tony’s nerves ease up a bit.  He can do this.
Their first diner date is not a disaster.
“Fuck,” Natasha swears. “Stark-- I know you monitor these comms! Clint’s on the roof. We need an evac! Now!”
a better time and place for this discussion and that time and place does not involve him holding a bucket of somewhat volatile chemicals.
If Steve could have stopped time and bottled that moment he would have.  Eventually Jarvis interrupts to remind Tony that Pepper is expecting him upstairs.
“Congratulations, by the way,” Bucky adds. “Probably should've led with that.”
"How many times should I have let it happen, then?" Nanna asks, with a disarmingly patient smile that seems to appear out of nowhere.
“I assumed so,” Bruce says fondly.
“I think Bruce might be overstating things,” Sam says from the screen. “Nice to meet you, though. And just to get it out of the way, no hard feelings over yanking off my wings back in DC. I got total respect for your skills and I’m always glad to meet a fellow bad-ass.”
Pepper’s smile reassures him he hasn’t done anything wrong. “Rhodey and I spent hours strategizing how to get you two together one afternoon. I couldn’t be happier for you.”
Sure, Bruce has his suspicions. James has said and done several things that indicate a post-depression American upbringing and an inside knowledge of what a stubborn punk Steve Rogers can be. That’s still not proof.
“I want this,” Steve says.  “I’ve wanted it since right around the time you made the announcement that Stark Industries was moving away from weapons.  That speech was incredible.
“It can wait,” he agrees.
Tony takes it out and turns the gun slowly over in his hands.  There’s a clip in it. It’s loaded.
Then Steve and Tony laugh so hard they can barely pull apart.  It takes Steve almost a minute to regain his composure enough to move.
There’s a fancy looking blanket resting on a chair nearby but it looks like it was woven out of some kind of endangered animal and when Steve picks it up, it’s more prickly than soft.
Starks always keep score. I won. 26-24.
“Amen,” Tony says from his lab.
Steve smiles.  “I’d have liked to see that.”
Tony’s expression is unreadable.  “J, get the good Captain on his way.  I’m sure there are at least a dozen cats up in trees between here and Brooklyn that need saving.  Law of averages...”
“Dr Stark, shit.  Sorry!  I-- look-- I really need this job, so even if it
Steve lets the words sit in the air. As excuses go, it’s terrible. He doesn’t think Tony’s lying, though. To Tony, that’s the truth. It really is that simple.
Steve tosses a few clothing options onto the bed then tugs his shirt off over his head.
Steve hadn’t said anything at all, so no.
“That’s not what I was thinking,” Tony says simply.
“The fleas are drones?” Steve asks.
“No.  You really don’t,” Steve insists.  “We can take this car out for the day but I’m bringing it right back.  It’s yours.”
“Cross my heart,” Steve says.  “Now that I’ve seen what my Star Trek models do for you, I figure I’ll for sure get to third base when I dig out my old Battlestar Galactica sketches.”
“Yes,” Tony says. “I met Steve Rogers last night and we kind of hit it off. He came over and we skated for a bit. Nothing happened. It was just... nice. He and Barnes are roommates.”
You might regret this.
“Hey!” Bruce protests.
"Or your night light!"
Loud enough that people skirt around them and Steve just shakes his head and smiles again because there’s a definite part of him that wishes he could swear publicly like that. Sure, he swears in his head and in private just fine, but his mum raised him for polite company. Old habits die hard.
“Playboy, right,” Steve says, sounding as unimpressed now as he did the first time he’d heard it.  “Why play dumb?  What do you get out of it?”
“It’d be a sign of the apocalypse if you did,” Tony says.  “Next thing you’d know there’d be plagues of locust all over.”
-----------------------------------------
“We’ll know it worked when he wakes up,” Bruce points out. “If he doesn’t wake up-- it didn’t work.”
“That is incredibly kind of you,” Steve says.
Natasha smashes through the wooden security barrier without so much as a tap on the brakes.
Jealousy isn’t fun. Ending the night together because in the end this is where they both belong? That’s fucking excellent.
Steve appreciates that this woman doesn’t try to make conversation.  Tony’s mumbling to himself, and he stinks like cheap liquor and puke, and Steve’s head aches with the effort of keeping his Captain America face on as they pass a janitor, and then a few guards.  He gives them grateful nods, and small, apologetic smiles.  He’s not sure why except the alternative is to frown at all of them deeply, and it isn’t their fault Tony’s in this mess.
“I think Tony’s going to have ideas for improvements,” Bruce says. “I think he’ll have sketches and probably a dozen working models within a week, and at least one of them is going to be moderately offensive in that it will be painted to match Steve’s shield or be decorated with little Bucky Bears. But he won’t force the issue. He may create things outside your permission, but he would never experiment on you without your expressed, non-coerced consent. I know he won’t because-- and I’m not bragging here-- I am way more scientifically interesting than you. And while Tony might ask a nosey question here or there, he’s never once treated me as anything less than a person. Not ever.”
Steven is her oldest great-grandson. He’s a journalism student at NYU and he is just as spirited as Boop. His opinions are hilarious and he is so full of hope and energy and goodness. Steve doesn’t interact with a lot of young people these days so Steven is a breath of fresh air.
“Because I’m the one with the most to lose, here. I’m the monster watching my best science friend make a new science friend. But you’re the one making that face.”
Tony needed to know why.  Or well, he knew
Bruce considers his response for a minute then sends a GIF of a happy cat going down a slide over and over and over. Some day he and Tony need to talk about James. That day is not today.
Tony has an idea of where “here” is, but he’d only seen it on a map earlier.  It all looked flat.  The terrain as he hops out of the back of the van is more complicated.  They’re at the rim of a quarry of some kind, with loose dirt and stones as far as Tony can see down into the hole.  Off in the distance there’s a barbed-wire-enclosed building and a small purple Beetle parked alongside a dozen or so dark, unmarked cars.  Twelvish cars means twelvish employees.  That’s not so many, Tony hopes.
“Just the word ‘home’?” Bruce asks.
There’s no easy answer to that.  “It’s complicated.”
“Give me some credit.  I do know what I’m getting into here.  And for your information, my crush on Neil Degrasse Tyson is real and valid,” Steve says.  “I’ve been to Hayden Planetarium more times than I can count.  He narrates the--”
He walks over to Steve and kisses him on the cheek. “Is this okay?” Tony whispers.
“Holy shit, he
The others introduce themselves as well, so now Tony knows that Kate is the energetic brunette, and Natasha is the redhead who moves with the grace of a dancer.  Clint needs no introduction, but introduces himself anyway, with all the enthusiasm of a contestant on The Dating Game.
He towels off, dresses, then walks out of the bathroom to greet a quiet house.  The feeling of unease in his chest only intensifies as he turns on the coffee maker and starts making pancakes alone.
The hostess has spotted them and she waves at their favorite waitress, Mae, who carries over a tray full of food.
“JARVIS is watching,” Pepper says.  It sounds ominous.  “But in case he’s compromised,” she glances at Tony, “I’ve signed the bottom of each egg.  No signature, no win.”
“What? Yes. Absolutely.”
Tony lays awake at night waiting for Rogers or Romanoff to call. He’s got so many connections. He can pull so many strings. He would do-- could do-- whatever it took-- if they would just
“Don’t think we should give them any extra time to destroy evidence,” Clint says.
“JARVIS, put on Dog Cops and order us some pizza, will you?” Tony asks.
What had once been his best comfort only reminded him of just how lonely his world had become.  Tony hadn’t seen the quilt again until after Afghanistan.  It had come back to him in a box, from Rhodey’s mom, sent along with a tupperware bowl full of her chocolate chip cookies and a note that read
“If we don’t, none of you fuckers are gonna rest in peace.  Your ghosts are going to wander the earth, whispering in the breeze...”  Clint’s voice drops to an overly spooky whisper.  “What wasssssss the naaaaaaaaame?  What was the nameeeeeeeee?”
When the SAD department is renamed the Reconnaissance Administration Division, and Clint runs around shouting RAD! all afternoon, that isn’t tainted by an interoffice relationship either.
“I don’t like bullies,” Steve says.
“If he was stealing office supplies, you’d be down there helping him load them into his car, not up here, alone, sulking.”
“If I want to get rid of all the alcohol that’s in the apartment, can you point me to anything I miss?”
“Is that-- are you making a
He ends the call.
“What about guns for Nanna and Kate?” Tony asks.  “Do you happen to have something undetectable here incase you need to make a worst case scenario exit.”
“Go get whatever pieces you’ve got and meet me down at the lab,” Tony tells Sam. "JARVIS’ll show you the way.  I can’t guarantee they’ll look exactly the same since I’m gonna need to scavenge parts from my old suits, but it’ll be close and I can guarantee you they’ll fly.  Probably better than before.”
“SHIELD's got nothing to do with it,” Steve assures him.  “Bruce found out I’d never had Indian food and we moved on from there.”
“If you’ll unwrap yourself out of that blanket burrito you can find out for yourself.”  Steve looks down at the bagel in his hand and keeps his eyes there as he continues.  “I was thinking of heading over to Brooklyn.  Jarvis suggested taking some pictures of some of the places me and Bucky used to go.  I know-- I know not to get my hopes up.  I understand it might not help.”
Tony replays Steve’s words a couple of times in his head to sort out whether Steve’s insulting him.  He decides it sound more like Cap is berating himself.
“I don’t like being handed things,” Tony says.  He’s actually mostly past that with Steve, but in the face of anger it’s a reflex.
are incredible.”
“Bruce needs coffee,” Bruce says with a yawn. He does fistbump her though, and that gets a huge smile from Kate. “After coffee, I will weigh in on whatever this is.”
“Shit,” Tony swears.  “No, they aren’t ceramic.  They could probably
Steve looks appalled, and then his face softens in concern. He reaches out to squeeze Tony’s hip.
“Right under my name?” Tony asks.
“The part where I don’t know what to do,” Bruce says, sounding wrecked. “I don’t know what you
You could go to Disney. Or Harry Potter World. You’re in ~Orlando~.
“We’re good,” Bucky confirms. “I’ve carried his drunk ass up the stairs before, I can do it again.”
“I’m not here to fire Clint,” Tony explains for the second time.  He's careful not to sound impatient since he wants to encourage this whole not-afraid-of-Tony-Stark vibe he’s getting.  “I was asking about Dr. Banner--”
Steve whistles appreciatively.  “You know that thing’s loaded, right?”
“Clint and I do it to each other all the time-- there’s-- there’s a freedom to say no in friendship that we take for granted. For example I might tell Clint, ‘Hey, get me a beer.’ It’s not an order, it’s a request, but I don’t always phrase it like a polite request to Clint because I know with absolute certainty that if Clint doesn’t want to get me the beer, he’ll tell me to fuck off.”
Steve gives him a look, then digs around in his pocket for the slip of paper with their homework discussion topic for the week,  He reads the question out loud.
They’ve discussed this in therapy. Steve needs to be his own person. Tony needs to be his own person. And Rhodey and Pepper are trusted friend who will keep an eye on what Tony drinks. As if reading their minds, Rhodey appears across the room and waves.
sorry to wake you,” JARVIS says, his voice quietly filling Steve’s bedroom room. “Agent Romanoff is requesting entry to your quarters. She is most insistent.”
“I’m sorry,” Bruce apologizes. “It’s not even the questions, it’s just-- this is a topic I think about a lot myself.  The what-ifs surrounding what happens when Hulk smashes my friends. It’s nice to have someone who understands, even if I’m sorry it’s anything you’ve got to worry about.”
“I was the kind of needy kid who was always getting in the way.  It’s probably my fault he couldn’t--”
“All our intel says you had no choice,” Clint counters.
The soldier stands, and despite his natural grace, lists a little on his feet.
It’s not a good situation but Steve’s willing to try and work through it.  When he pictures Tony at the Children’s Hospital, or ushering nervous interns through a crowded lobby, or explaining science in a way that lights up his whole face, Steve knows that Tony is worth the effort.
Partly because the old woman looks about ready to fall over from shock and partly because Steve’s just not sure what to make of the heartfelt defense.
Steve’s hand stops before it reaches the closet door.  “Well,” Steve says.  “I’ve got clothes in my bag if yours are gone.  We’ll find you something.”
“The basement door’s in the kitchen, and the extinguisher is under the stairs, dear,” Nanna directs.  “You’re sweet to offer.”
“You will be the first to know,” Bruce promises.
Steve ducks his head, looking shy and embarrassed when Tony walks inside.  The room is a time capsule straight out of 2005.  An eighteen year old Steve’s 2005, much to Tony’s delight.  He turns slowly to take it all in.
Steve laughs, quiet and real.  “Believe it or not, you couldn’t afford me.”
The other men take off their shoes to line them up neatly under a bench, and then disarm themselves of their guns and place them carefully in a large basket lined with blue velvet and lace.  Tony notices that there is already a gun in the gun basket waiting.  Nanna’s gun, apparently.  Tony adds his weapon to the pile.  Bucky adds a second.  Then a boot knife.  Clint unloads half an armory.  Tony doesn’t even want to guess where he was hiding the dart gun.
James drops his head back to the pillow, and glues his eyes to the ceiling. “You don’t know what I deserve.”
“Nanna’s here,” Steve says. He pulls back more so he can look at Tony like that should mean something.
“I bet you pop out of bed looking like a daisy, too,” Tony scoffs wearily.
Tony shuts off his phone. He appreciates the support from his friends, he really does. And he’s sure not going to lose any sleep over a break from his dad. But he’s exhausted and he kind of can’t believe he did it. He really did it.
“Took you long enough,” Clint calls.
Tony stops before getting to the desk and turns to Steve.
as a kudos from you!
Tony takes his time driving to the burger place.  Steve’s got a lot to get out, and Tony’s going to let him do it.  Honestly, it’s probably equally cathartic for them both.
“Sure.”
Tony knows his social security number.  He memorized it when he was three and he’s known it ever since.  But people don’t have a lot of reason to stick around if they don’t think Tony needs them so he’d told Pepper he didn’t know it.
“Security!” he bellows.  “What are you doing here, Tony?”
Steve pauses with his hand to the door. There’s a doorbell. He could ring it. But doorbells can be startling and he doesn’t want to startle Tony. He just... just wants to talk.
Steve isn’t sure what to say.  Of course Tony doesn’t need his help.  Even without the suit, Tony’s got a ton of self-defense training.  He could have taken Jonathan easily.  Yet he stood there and took the hit.  Was ready to take another hit.  Has taken too many hits.
Tony snatches the keys out of Steve’s hand and throws open the door.
Even after everything, he sounds so eager to come back and see James, Bruce feels a pang of pity for him as he watches Steve leave.
Steve tracks down Clint’s cable company and pays in advance for a full year of HBO.  It’s the least he can do.
Steve turns around.  He’s shocked that Tony’s following after him.
“Sir has given me specific instructions not to interfere in such instances.”  Jarvis doesn’t sound any happier about it than Steve feels.  “His lawyers will handle it.”
He reaches for Tony and once he’s got hold of him he pulls him close and then flips on top of him, pinning him with a quickness that takes Tony’s breath away.  Steve leans down to kiss Tony behind the ear and then places a few more gentle kisses down to where his neck meets his shoulder.
Steve chokes on a laugh.  “Tony.  What was I supposed to do?  Send you an email?  You’re kind of the definition of unreachable.”
“No, I don’t,” the soldier says wearily. “I don’t fuckin’ know him. Bucky Barnes knew him and I’m not Bucky Barnes.”
As much as Steve knows that this is important and that Howard has been an elephant in the room for far too long, he still isn’t sure how to get through it.  And that only takes Howard into consideration.  Tony’s never said more than a word or two about his mother.  She could have been equally cold.  Distant.
Then there’s a limo.  With more roses.
“You’re doing your best,” Steve says.
Jenny’s happy scream reverberates across the ice. “No! No, your team! I’ll be on your team!”
Bruce’s eyes are on James, and it’s a relief when he sees him smirk infinitesimally at Bruce's explanation of his name.
“I don’t think I’ll ever believe it,” Tony admits.
“You’re translators,” Tony says, looking up in confusion.
“It’s two hours,” Rhodey says.
“Do you have scissors or are you planning to try this with your knife collection?” Bruce asks Clint, as Clint zips his duffel bag closed.
“Fine. If the street had been deserted and I already had the eggs, yes. Sure. I might have tossed one or two. I’m petty, okay? Bruce thinks it’s one of my better qualities.”
Howard saw you leave the house.
And if James caring about what happens to an old sack of clothes isn’t proof that deep down inside him there’s hint of a kid who was born around the Great Depression, Bruce doesn’t know what it is.
“That sounds terrible,” Bruce says. “And brutal. And inhumane and immoral and I would need a thesaurus to finish this sentence. But all of that-- it doesn’t change that I still need to look at your knee, James. And to get the equipment I need to talk to Tony, and really, I need to talk to Tony either way.”
He’s joking, obviously, and Bruce nods. “I’d say it must be nice, but I think if I had the choice, I’d choose to be like you.”
“One more thing before you hang up,” Clint interjects. “Tony? We’re gonna need new digs in the next day or two, if you think you can manage it.”
Tony is off somewhere else in his head.  He talks occasionally outside of the cussing, but it’s mostly muffled under his breath and most of what he says is about shipping Dum-E off to K-Mart if the bot can’t get his act together. (Tony clearly adores Dum-E so Steve doesn’t believe the threats are valid even for a second.)
you get bossy.”
“You do this often?” James asks.
Steve groans. “Does that make it time for the Dance Cam or the Kiss Cam or the Hockey Hockey Hockey song on your home ice?”
“That’s the plan,” Steve says. “I won’t go on a talk show. I had Jarvis look. He couldn’t find a single one that didn’t badmouth at least one of us. So I’m doing this on my own terms.”
Hey. Everything okay?
Steve laughs. “You aren’t crying. I can’t tell you how many people cry on me when they meet me for the first time.” He gives the boy a pat on the shoulder. “You’re doing fine. If you’ve got a minute, I’d love to hear about your great-grandma. How life turned out for Boop.”
Tony puts a hand on Steve’s elbow and squeezes.   Steve lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
Tony knows he’s rambling but the whole conversation went from funny banter to asking Steve if he wants to share a bed a little more quickly than Tony’d intended, and yes, okay, he’s panicking a little.
"I guarantee you it's better than the initiation to join HYDRA," Clint points out. “So what’s this second suggestion of yours, anyway?”
Bruce turns to leave, and Steve steps in front of Tony and settles his hand on Tony's hip.
-----------------------------------------
“His idea,” James says.
Steve nods.  “Then let’s get to it.”
Steve shoves back hard from the table and glares at Tony, which, believe it or not, is a vast improvement over the desolate nothingness that Steve’s stare is most days when Tony checks in on him over the video feed. The life in Steve's eyes only lasts a few seconds and then he breathes out slowly before stuffing the rest of the BannerBar in his mouth.
“You shouldn’t have to do that,” Tony says.  “It’s pathetic.”
“I want you to forgive me,” Tony says, his whole demeanor so worriedly vulnerable it nearly kills Steve. “I want to give us a shot. I want to be happy.”
“I’ll get Bruce home,” Kate offers. She appears to be the more sober of the two, since she is standing without support.
For u? Sure, why not.
They’ve been on the path about 10 minutes when Clint’s intuition proves true in the worst possible way. One second James is walking fine and the next he’s on his knees. Bruce is ten or so meters behind him.
“You break it, you buy it.”
Clint and James halt, then leave the path to take cover under a large tree nearby. Bruce joins them a minute or so later. He’s parched and out of breath. James and Clint look like they’ve been lounging poolside all afternoon. Neither seem exerted.
“I had incentive to get out of bed,” Tony says.
Two minutes left. Clint scores. The stands go wild. 2-1, Stars.
Steve considers it. That’s what he wanted. Or-- well, he’s not sure what he’d wanted before. It’s what he wants now.
Bruce works for an hour, sleeps for four, then wakes up again to get back to work.  The biological part of what’s wrong with James is grim.  All the monitors hooked up to him report back the same thing-- his body is trying to heal but there’s something in the way.  Bruce’s best guess is that it’s the arm and the way it’s wired into James’s central nervous system, but the mechanics of the arm are out of his area of expertise.  With some reluctance, he reaches out to the only person he knows who might be able to make sense of what he’s seeing.
Steve smiles.  “You are your father’s son.”
and I doubt he wants to be the one to defile Captain America’s virgin eyes.”
It’s hard for Tony not to want to walk close.  It’s hard not to let his mind replay the moment when Steve’s hands settled on his hips and by the time they get to the office, all these thoughts aren’t the only thing that’s hard.
“All chasing him has done so far is drive him further underground,” Sam says.  “If he goes any farther south, we’re gonna be interrogating penguins.”
“Let me check on you,” Steve says.  “I’ll sit with you.”
Nanna moves on to choosing what appear to be ceramic shuriken (at this point an old lady grabbing throwing stars seems about par for the course) and tucks them into the pockets of her apron.
“I loved him and that scared him,” she says, her posture deflating a little.  “He didn’t think he deserved me.  He pushed me away emotionally and I stayed.  He pushed me away by shutting himself in his workshop for days at a time and I stayed.  So he did the one thing he knew would put an end to things.  He got blind drunk and he cheated on me.  And then when he confessed it all, he kept telling me it wasn’t personal.  It wasn’t about me.  I’d always been enough.  It wasn't my fault. It was all on him.”
“I was gone too long,” Steve guesses.  “You need to hear how much I love you, every single day.”
There’s an old, antique-looking dresser pushed against the south wall, and Bruce gives one of the knobs a sharp tug.  The drawer slides out more easily that he expects and the clothes inside are unmistakably Barton’s.  There’s something endearingly Clint about storing a dozen Hawkeye-themed novelty t-shirts in the bedroom of a top secret safe house.  Some people might mistake that for cluelessness, but Bruce knows better.  It’s a statement, a ‘come and get me’ middle finger from a man who’s got exactly zero fucks to give. Bruce enjoys that a lot. He tugs on one of the bright purple t-shirts and a pair of dark sweats, then sets off down the stairs.
“Nanna likes it when people talk like pirates,” Clint says seriously.  “So do that.  Be a pirate.”
Steve doesn’t find the 20 dollar bill Tony somehow tucked into the pocket of Steve’s hoodie until he’s on his way home.
Steve explains about Clint’s rainbow glitter paintballs, and pulls out his notebook to show Tony where he’s been plotting his revenge. Skunk scented paintballs. Paintballs that look like bird poop once they’ve hit you. Paintballs that cover you in foam. Paintballs that contain a mild itching powder. There are more. Steve had spent the better part of an evening writing out ideas, and sketching himself a special paintball shield for future use.
“Nope,” Tony says.  “I’ve been good as gold.  Gooder than gold.  The
*crack*
“Have you ever heard of SHIELD?  They’re... a kind of special ops organization.”
“I’ve had worse,” Clint says. “And Stark keeps the fun pain pills up front. Nat got me two and now I can’t feel shit.  I’m superman!”
“And that’s bad?” Steve asks.
“Sure,” Steve says.  Jarvis is a pleasant distraction.  “Ask away.”
“I’ve got us covered.”
“James Buchanan Barnes, watch your language,” Tony hears Nanna scold.
Once the elevator doors swish open and he’s surrounded by dark cubicles and the eyes of the few people there at 7 A.M., Tony thinks maybe he should have asked Jarvis to send Bruce up instead.
Two are Steve’s work. The first is the view from the top of the tower since the previous week Tony had mentioned missing New York. The next was a drawing, done in pencil, of Tony’s workshop. Steve had drawn it one of the days he’d gone to visit the bots, and he liked how it turned out. Even without Tony there, his presence lingers. Steve had included details he hadn’t seen, like a mug of coffee, and papers scattered on the desk and the ground. Like Tony had just stepped out of the frame for a moment but he planned to be right back.
“Shit, shit I’m sorry,” Bruce cuts James off with an embarrassingly frantic set of hand flailing. “You’re not doing anything wrong. That’s exactly right, actually. But please don’t continue, with the starting from the beginning and the... me, bits. I can’t.... with my family history.”
“That’s what I do,” Tony says.  “Secluded mountain chalet. Stocked kitchen.  Wi-fi.  Killer view.  He’s going to love it.”
“Take one more for Barnes,” Tony says. “Or else he isn’t going to believe I put his puck in there.”
Warning: There's an emergency medical situation at the end of this chapter and mentions of blood.
“We’ll worry about it when it’s a problem,” Bruce deflects, as he gets to Clint.  “Now stop being stubborn and let me look at your arm.”
Steve’s mouth falls open. He’s holding a wrench that Tony had handed him a few minutes before and Steve waves it emphatically. “No. No, not a sex tape.
“I’m a Digital Forensics Analyst.  If SI security needs images checked for accuracy, photoshopping, or forgery, they send them my way and I figure it out.  Your lawyers end up sending me stuff, too,” Steve admits.  “Not always in an official capacity.”
Tony mouths the word “boooooom” as he lifts his hands like a mushroom cloud, which gets a chuckle from Steve.
Recovery.
“When has that ever stopped you before?”
“You want to go to a rink at this time of night?” Steve asks.
Clint has his hands up in surrender, looking as dead-calm as a deep lake on a windless day.  Like this is exactly what he’d hoped to be doing on a Thursday afternoon.  Like he is totally unflappable while Bruce is Super Fucking Flapped.
“So he can hate you, too?” Steve asks in return.  “Kill you with kindness?  Cause let me tell you, it’s great.”
That sends a low murmur of objection through the crowd though no one’s brave enough to stand up and walk out.
“Oh, I like that,” Tony says, his smile turning wicked as he wraps an arm around Steve and tugs him toward the ramp.  “I like that a lot.”
The screen nearest them turns on Looney Tunes immediately.
“Here’s where we’re stuck,” Bucky says.  “Looks like Stane’s involved.  Looks like Hammer Industries is involved.  But the machine that sent the message to the murder posse is locked down now.  If we want any proof, someone is going to have to go to their server farm and do a manual download.”
He puts on a pair of faded jeans that are a stitch too tight and a royal blue t-shirt that makes him look about as Captain America as he can manage outside of donning his uniform.  He checks his hair twice and even spritzes on cologne.  He’s got to get this right.
“God, no,” Bruce says, noticing the way James pauses a moment before each question. Like it’s shameful to want more information. "I want you to feel safe here,” Bruce goes on. “I want both of us to feel safe here.”
Sure.  See you then. :)
He’s absolutely not pacing. Or checking his phone what feels like every two minutes to see only 10 seconds have passed. And he doesn’t jump at the sound of the doorbell and force himself to wait a few beats before walking in that direction.
“Good idea,” Tony agrees.
“I’m with the Winter Soldier,” Bruce says quietly. “He’s the reason I needed a place to stay.  And  before Clint explained the situation, I was hoping you could send me some lab equipment to assess him because he’s injured and that seemed like the right thing to do right up until the part where Clint told us he murdered your parents.”
Tony’s so happy and surprised to see Bruce that he can’t stop staring at him and smiling. Like he can’t quite believe Bruce is there.
“There was never any question of me and Bucky joining up.  He was a natural with a gun and I could do just about everything else.  We cruised through missions, and I’m not-- I’m not trying to brag here, but a lot of people told us we were the best SHIELD ever recruited.  And then there was Sokovia...”
“This is sounding a lot like a date,” Tony points out.
James starts thinking more for himself, Steve and Tony do what might pass for flirting, and Clint and Bruce have the very best intentions.
He makes a rush for James, but Clint is only a step ahead of the soldier and he turns when he hears James falter. It ends up being exactly the kind of mistake they’ve all been trying so damn hard to avoid. Bruce doesn’t even know what he’s seeing until Clint flies violently backward landing on his side in some deep grass. Bruce stops-- feels his panic rising-- and watches James fall forward on his face and begin to convulse there on the ground.
“That’s good of you,” Tony says. “Though next time, maybe stop me after ten. I haven’t felt this rough in a long time.”
*crack*
“He’s going back to his factory settings,” Clint says. “If by factory we mean his mom’s vag.”
Bruce works fast to get the nutrition started and once it’s pumping into James, he checks all of the monitors again, then again.
Tony is sure Steve’s going to miss the puck. It’s a perfect shot. Fast, accurate. A biscuit in the basket, then they can move on with their lives.
James nods, then closes his eyes.  Clint drops back down to his pillow, too.
“I’ve gained a lot of perspective this season. And while gaining that perspective I made a few major mistakes. Some are public knowledge, and others not so much. I’m not sure what can be fixed and what I’m going to have to live with, but-- for the first time in a long time, I have hope that things can get better. Hope in second chances and fixed mistakes.”
“What if I get there and they want to use me?  I’m a weapon.  An asset.  They’re gonna realize I’m not Bucky Barnes and then that’s all I’m good for,” James hedges.
There’s concern there on Bucky’s behalf, and it sounds genuine.  Steve appreciates that more than he knows what to do with.
Kate makes a horrified face. “Umm, oops. I take that back, because that’s going to be a
Clint does own a paintball crossbow. Two in fact. And they’re awesome.
“This is one of those things you've got to see for yourself.”
“Right,” Bruce says. “So I don’t worry about accidentally telling Clint to do something. It’d be different with you right now. I’m trying extremely hard to phrase anything I ask you as a question with an out so you don’t interpret it as an order. But I might forget.”
Tony’s team-- the Manhattan Rampage-- is only one win away from first in their division. And even if they’re going to get there without Tony, he still wants to watch.
Every once in a while, Bucky would come home flush and try to coax Steve out with some girls he’d found.  Before his mother had died, Steve would usually say yes even if he preferred the company of Bucky and Tony to whatever date Bucky — or more specifically, the girl Bucky had asked out — had found for him.  It had taken a long time for Tony to realize that Bucky was providing Steve cover and that neither man really expected anything to come of it.  After, however — and that’s how everyone in the apartment seemed to think of their lives now, Before and After — Steve never agreed, no matter how Bucky or Tony tried to convince him.
“I’ll find some odd jobs.  I don’t plan on being a burden,” Tony said between his own mouthfuls of food.
There was dim light spilling into the hallway from one of the rooms near the end, and Steve could hear the faint, even beeping of the pulse oximeter.  They passed a workstation, where a nurse glanced up from a book she was reading at the desk.  She nodded once at them in recognition, her eyes flickering to the monitor in front of her, before turning a page in her book.
He just knew it was going to hurt.
,” the guy replied.
“You mean Pepper will.”  Steve had already turned away from the view, running a hand through his hair.
— and you can choose to build a life here, let other people in.  You could befriend Tony and see if the man that you knew from before is in there.  Or you can keep doing what you’re doing.  Keep pretending, keep everyone at a distance, keep going at it alone.  What are you more afraid of, Steve — being alone because you choose to be or taking a risk that might lead to having a life — a real life — here?”
“Yeah,” Tony panted, having to pause between each word, “you should see the other guy.”
“I know,” Steve said, and they started walking back to the R8.  “I told you not too.”
Tony cleared his throat, and Steve paused, looking over his shoulder.  “Can you teach me how to darn socks?” Tony found himself asking.
Whatever it takes, Steve had said.
“He knows that — but if he can’t fix
, he’d said, speaking of his own mother.  Tony had been right; the pain had faded into a dull ache, the contours of the hole she’d left behind.  He still missed her every day — missed her advice and her no-nonsense approach to problems.  He missed the smell of her hair and her smile.  But the sharpness had faded, and he didn’t miss her sadness or her suffering while she had been sick, her white hot fury whenever something happened in Ireland.  He hoped that, somehow, she knew her beloved home had finally won its independence.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Bucky demanded, appearing behind him.  He hustled Steve back into the tenement building despite his protests.  “You’re going to catch your death out here all wet in just a towel, you fucking idiot.”
She told him about her childhood, about being an orphan before she was selected to serve the Motherland.  When she spoke of her training in the Red Room, it was very detached and clinical, and Steve got the strong impression that she left a lot out.  She spoke of the deal she brokered with Peggy, with Clint as an intermediary, to defect from the KGB and join Shield.  She even told him of some of her time as Tony’s personal assistant, although Steve could tell she was protecting his privacy by not discussing a lot of what happened.
Steve’s having a good time for the first time since he left Tony upstate. Clint doesn’t take it easy on him, and Steve’s not a terrible shot. By the time they’re finished, they’re both out of breath.
“No.  We’re having a tantrum,” Tony says.
“Steve--”
there is a fine line between pushing and giving James the support he needs to express himself so Bruce stays quiet for a moment. The best he can do is watch James’s face and look for cues, and when James’s frustration appears to fade slightly and he looks more tired than anything else, Bruce decides to try a different approach.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That mess is his life," Steve replies. "If it was me, he'd help.  He wouldn't hesitate.”
“I didn’t think you were,” Bruce says. “But can we not do this over the phone?  Come down to the house. I need to get James inside and contact Tony about some medical supplies.”
“I don’t want to hear it,” Steve says as he lifts the first box of explosives carefully out of the back.
Tony and Steve disappear from all the monitors and so do Nat and Sam, along with Tony’s chatter.  Clint’s eyes are still open, but just barely.
Bruce notices Tony give Steve’s knee a comforting rub and the way that seems to relax the tense set of Steve’s shoulders.
Steve looks an awful lot like he wants to say no. Like he’d much rather wake up from this nightmare than have to keep on living through it. But like the American Hero he is, Steve takes the chair across from Tony, and when he speaks it’s clear his mind’s made up.
“If the first one’s sitting okay in your stomach, would you like another StarkBar?” Bruce asks, pulling one out for himself as well.
“I’ve forgiven you,” Steve says.
“I’ve got answers,” Tony says blankly. “You want to dig through all the answers JARVIS found for me?”
Steve laughs. “He’ll love that, I’m sure. It’s too bad I don’t just carry them on me. He was seeing her this afternoon.”
“We will,” Steve says.  “Whatever it takes, we will.”
“I think they’re probably worrying for nothing,” Bruce says.  “I’m not that important.”
Tony’s glare turns into a glower.  “Have you even met yourself?  If I made a list of the top one million words to describe you, gold digger wouldn’t be on there.”
“It was the art panel,” Tony says, a little uneasily.  “The background-- was the portal.  The wormhole.  It sets me off.  I- I had panic attacks when I was a kid.  Hadn’t had one for years.  Then after the battle they started again.”
“No guilt eyes?” Clint asks.
“That text from Bruce earlier,” Steve says.  “About Switzerland.  Did you get him all set up?”
Tony’s eyes sting at the edges.
“I think what we’re all trying to say is that if you want to be left alone, we’ll leave you alone,” Bruce says. “And if you don’t want to be left alone, that’s okay too.”
Clint throws up a peace sign and Tony laughs and does the same.  The picture Clint shows him a second later surprises Tony, because it’s been a long time since he’s seen his own face captured with that kind of smile.  Definitely not for a few years.
Clint drops his bag on the table and begins to rustle through it. He pulls out a small, beat up laptop, and hands it over to James.
Bruce presses the comm button.
“Pepper texted me that you were in jail,” Steve says.  “It never occurred to me not to go.”
He wets his lips, before his gaze steels. "That might offend some of you, but if you think who a person loves diminishes their service, you do not support the ideals that we swear to uphold. I am who I am. And I’m happy, finally. Happy being with the person I love and being able to show him how much I love him."
“Not here,” Bruce says. “Still in the tower, I think.”
Tony laughs extra hard when he realizes the hand-written name on his cup is simply +100 x 8 or 9.
When he walks over to James, his steps are heavy, and there’s no stealth. Clint is a solid, grounding presence.  Bruce had never noticed before that Clint could do that. Could be so there.
Kate picks up a ranch-covered fry and flings it at Clint, nailing him squarely in the middle of the bullseye on his shirt.  It’s an impressive shot.
Steve can’t hold in a low hum of appreciation.
“Bastardized, but close,” she says.
James makes a face at Bucky’s name and Bruce flinches at his own stupidity.
Tony is scandalized.  This is straight up scandalous.  He frowns, but he can’t keep a straight
Steve bites down on his bottom lip to hide his smile.
He can do this.
“Don’t even think about it,” Bucky adds, biting down on the corner of his bottom lip. “It’s the least we can do for you making an honest man out of our Stevie.”
“That would be funny if it wasn’t true,” Bruce says.
“I’ll have Jarvis send you a compilation video of all the shitty things I’ve said about you in the last six weeks.  You should play it a couple of times a night.  You’ll get over me, just fine.”
Tony gets no reply.
And it’s the right answer because James lets out a sharp breath and nods.
“I do,” Steve agrees.
It’s 4 am, this is such a bad idea.
“Third base?” Tony asks.  “You pull out some Battlestar Galactica that’s an inside-the-park grand slam.  Guaranteed.”
Bucky laughs the loudest at that.   “Giving Steve shit, and you don’t even know him,” Bucky says with a smile.  “I knew I liked you.”
Pepper looks relieved.  Her shoulders relax.
Tony shrugs.  “Not really.  I haven’t been out of here for...” It takes Tony a second to come up with exactly when he’d last left the building which definitely means the answer is Too Long.  “Almost a week?”
Steve stares down at the birds then looks back up at Tony.
“So help me, I will turn this car around,” Tony warns.
“Plus Bucky Bears were a thing,” Bruce adds. His voice is about a hundred times less burdened now that he sees James in the flesh. Especially since James looks like he’s made about a week’s worth of recovery in the 8 hours he slept. “You might have seen them actually, if you were doing research.”
“I’m Bruce Banner. And you are?”
“How’s forever sound?” Tony asks.
Steve nods. He’s not surprised. He’s known for years that the bond Tony and Bruce share is special. Not romantic love, but just as real and every bit as important.
“Sweet!” Clint enthuses.  “Katie is going to be so pissed she’s missing this on the inside.”
He hasn’t told anyone yet, and that’s the rub. He plans to get through the night’s interviews with as little hoopla as possible and then in a week he’s going to announce his retirement. He’s going to change his life. Focus on what makes him happy. He’s going to--
“Sort of. Just turn it on. You’ll see.”
If you're an author and you rec your fic in the comments I will go and read and give you lots of love!
“Mop Man, Mop Man, cleans up after a flying can,” Rhodey sings.
“I’m going to go inside,” Clint says, in a tone that’s easy and peaceful and firm.
“Oh god,” Bruce says.  “We’re all about to die and they’re making a sex tape.”
Which makes Bruce laugh. Tony warms with relief.
It’s the last he speaks until later in the morning when they’re doing one last sweep of the house to make sure they aren’t leaving anything important behind. They can’t comfortably carry all the clothes Tony had provided them, but they can carry what they want, and James suggests they bag up what they don’t. Bruce writes out a note in rough German, asking that anything they leave behind be donated. It’s the best they can do on short notice, and it seems to satisfy James’s need to not be wasteful.
He can do it. He’s got to do it. He’s promised Bucky nothing’s getting past him tonight.
There’s a pause as Steve considers the dilemma, but it’s Clint who speaks. “Does it have to be indoors?”
With all the distractions gone, Bruce finally has a second to consider how he’s going to make this work. The first step is getting James’s informed consent.
The look on Fury’s face is worth the inconvenience of being handed a new phone the next day.
“Jarvis?”
The faceplate lowers. Tony looks uncertain, but not like he’s going to run. He reaches out and takes Steve’s hand in his own.
He tried to talk to Steve about it.  Casually.  “Uh, you know you can order groceries whenever you want?” Tony asked Steve one day when they were in the common kitchen, both helping to prepare dinner.  “And order anything you want.”
It was easier with a common goal: the need to get engine 3 back online.  Steve didn’t have to think about it, didn’t have to think about how this Tony was different from his Tony.  He could focus on the task at hand.  It was like battle, like working with the Howling Commandos again, which, Steve had as a passing thought as he verified the relays were intact, was only a few weeks ago for him.
Back at the tower, everyone was sore and tired, as well as a little put out by the dissatisfying conclusion of their encounter with Loki.  They lounged around the common living room, the TV entertaining itself in the background.  Tony felt all the more confused and out of place.  He was starting to remember: the tenement apartment, the radio, the shabby couch and tiny bedroom with its two twin beds.  The afghans.  The bath down the hall, and the boiler for hot water.  The calla lilies.  Steve’s drawing table.
A few weeks later, Tony noticed a pattern of behavior with Steve that he found odd.  Jarvis was the first to clue him in, after making the observation to Tony that Steve would wait to place a grocery order until he was out of food.  Tony had Jarvis track Steve’s food orders, and he found that the super soldier seemed to prefer pre-packaged food that would last a long time.  It seemed a strange choice because, when he looked at the data Bruce maintained on each Avenger, Steve’s performance subtly improved after he ate with the team, whose meals usually were freshly prepared from scratch with raw ingredients.
So the staff at Bellevue Hospital had moved heaven and earth — and one helicopter — to make it happen.
“If you go, I’m going,” Steve said, setting his shoulders and standing up to his full height.
Steve knew that feeling well; it was easier to be lonely because he pushed people away.  The other option — it was too painful to contemplate.
Loki’s voice was much quieter, but Steve could still follow the conversation.  “That’s not what Thor tells me — and he gets his information from Heimdall, so I’m sure it’s correct.”
“Son of a bitch,” Tony swore as he swooped around.  “I don’t suppose he brought Thor with him too?”  He hovered about a hundred feet in the air while the others stood on the ground.
“There’s not,” Steve said, saving Tony the need to find an appropriate end to that sentence.
“You — don’t look right,” Tony blurted out then shook his head, feeling disoriented. How hard had he hit his head?  He looked around, confused.  “This isn’t Brooklyn.”
“I don’t think I can get up,” Tony said, his elbows braced on his knees, slumped over in the seat.  His head was turned away from Steve, towards the ramp, and Steve realized he’d waited until Clint, Natasha, and Bruce were gone before saying anything.
Natasha raised an eyebrow at him, her expression grim.  “I wouldn’t exactly recommend him as someone to base your life choices on.”
With that simple command, Steve looked away.  He could make himself do a lot of things.  But watch the portal as it closed, losing Tony to space forever?
And then Steve Rogers arrived.
And yet.
Tony looked away sharply, and he knocked the whiskey over.  The bottle clattered onto the table, shattering, and droplets of the alcohol caused small flares where they splashed into the lantern.  The liquid ran across the surface of the table and dripped onto the floor, the
It had certainly taken its fair share and more.
His last thought — before the plane crashed, before the water shattered the canopy and knocked Steve unconscious — was that the water was the same shade of blue as the arc reactor.
“Well, you protecting him — that I believe,” Bucky said.  “What do you mean, a thing?”
And Tony had to crush it.
Tony slumped further down into the water, begrudgingly putting the towel back over his head after wringing it out very thoroughly.  Steve watched him, showing the most interest he had since October.  “Do you not like the water on your face?” he asked once Tony had finally gotten the towel positioned and leaned over so it fell away.
“What’d the bag do to you?” Natasha asked, grabbing it as it swung on its bracket, bringing it to a standstill.
That was supposed to have been the end of it.
“When you cut your intake.  You get hangry.”
Natasha and Clint were behind Steve, and Tony didn’t miss the look they shared.  “You can just ask Jarvis.  He’ll take care of it for you.”
Then Tony had gotten sick, yanking him out of the haze of grief into a low-level panic that never really left him.  He honestly didn’t know how Bucky and his ma had done it for him so many times — sitting at the bedside wondering if today was the day, if today the infection would overwhelm him and finally kill him.  Steve had found a reason to live, even if it was only to keep Tony alive through sheer willpower.
Steve took the monitor, which was dwarfed in his large hands, and inspected the numbers as though they would suddenly shift to worrisome levels.
“Yeah, we’re just going to have to agree to disagree on that one.”  Tony looked back to find Loki still grinning at him.
“Whatever,” Tony said contemptuously, already losing interest.  He stood and brushed his hands off on his pants as though they had something unpleasant on them.  “I think
The realization hit him so forcibly it took his breath away: for the first time in his life, he was truly lonely.
He'd carried his broken pieces with him because he had nothing else.  Without his ma, without Tony, without Bucky — he had nothing left to hang on to.  At least before, no matter how bleak, he’d had Bucky there for him.
Tony had seen pictures of Bucky from the war — certainly not as many as Steve, but more than the other commandos.  The black and white photos didn’t do the other man justice.  His dark hair was a healthy appearing brown, especially when contrasted with Steve’s, and tousled from sleep.  His blue-gray eyes were sharp and intelligent with a hint of humor to them.  His mouth seemed fixed in a small smirk, one corner quirked up just so.  It made Tony think of a picture he’d seen of him in his Sargent’s uniform, with the cap tipped at a jaunty angle.
Sam is not going to waste another second.  He's happy as a school kid as he hops to his feet.
Bruce gives him a sad smile.  “Absolutely.  You can
“What do you want?” Steve asks, his voice barely more than a whisper.  “I’m up for anything.”
“Then what’s the truth?” Tony asks.  He’s not upset.  “Because believe it or not, I’ve got some experience with classified information.  And I’m not going to hold it against you that you told an automatic lie because you couldn’t tell some man you’d just met the whole and absolute truth about your life.  That makes a lot of sense, actually.”
He and Clint and Natasha debrief with the STRIKE team the whole flight home, so once they’ve got wheels on the ground, Steve hops on his motorcycle and heads straight for the tower.  Since Tony’s installed a link with Jarvis, Steve uses it to let Tony know he’s on his way.
“You’re both awful,” Tony says.  “I want a refund.”
James considers the question as Bruce sits down across from him with his plate of charred meat.
“Oh god-- you’re my new favorite," Sam says.  "I’m sitting here like ‘Steve who?’ right now.  You can get them fixed?  By tomorrow?”
After a beat, James lets out his breath and slouches a little. His posture is no longer rigid and Bruce is glad James is relaxing.
Tony looks doubtful.
Tony glances at the cubicles again.  It's hard not to see spies everywhere.
“You realize the materials for this strap cost more than a car, right?” Tony asks.  “Bringing me McDonalds doesn’t make us even.”
“Can you find the tape and get rid of it?  It sounded like it was all digital.  Sitting on some server somewhere.”
“You think that was Bucky Barnes?” James asks. He doesn’t sound as offended by the name, now. It's more like he’s talking about an old acquaintance than an old enemy.
“Okay...” Steve begins.  “Here’s something.  My ma was seeing a man before she died.  A real nice guy. I liked him a lot.  He was good to her and he treated her right.  He wanted to get more serious but she wouldn’t commit because she was too set on taking care of me.  Right before she got sick we argued about it.”
Tony stares at him with a look that lands somewhere between amused and understanding.
kind of mindfuck for Steve.  Tony’s struggling to get his brain around it, and his brain is (if he says so himself) capable of making order out of any kind of chaos.  Also that in reverse.
The Man Behind the Shield: Discovering Captain America
Tony’s really shaking now, and Steve can tell things are getting worse, not better.
Steve is appalled.  Tony knows he’s appalled because Steve’s mouth is stuck open and his eyes are wide, like a trout mounted on a wall in a country club.
Someone from his own team fires a puck at him and Steve’s hand shoots out and snatches it out of the air like it’s nothing. He swats it to the ground and Clint comes skating toward him like a madman.
He sounds a lot less tough now that Natasha’s around. He’s comfortable with Natasha, Bruce realizes. He can hear it in Clint’s voice. And with Clint taken care of, it’s easier for Bruce to focus all his attention on James.
“I like it,” Natasha says.
James manages a look that could pass for sympathetic before reaching for one of the last few StarkBars.
“There’s that, too,” Bruce agrees.
“You’re a Google pro,” Clint corrects.  “Got it.  Fair warning, don’t look at my search history while you’re in there, unless you want to see porn. My tastes run a ways past vanilla so view at the risk of your virtue. And pick something for Bruce while you’re looking. A hairstyle, I mean. Pick out hair, not porn,” Clint clarifies.
The milkshake is as good as Clint promised.
Tony doesn’t appear to be listening. Tony’s more interested in laying the sponge down on Steve’s laptop keyboard.
“I might have some ideas on that,” Steve says.  “Codes we used in the war.”
“It’s kicked my puppy and it’s kind of a long story,” Bruce says. “Clint’s here. He brought me up to speed on some things. What happened with your parents, for one.”
“Penny for your thoughts?” Tony asks.
“That’s a mood,” Tony agrees, eyes still steadily on his work.
“Captain America wants to sext with me. Today is awesome. And for the record. I don’t think you’re going to be boring in the sack. I said it because I’m a dick. I have no doubts we’ll be just fine there.”
Steve nods.  “We wouldn’t be doing this if any of us thought otherwise.”
"It's
care about what happens to me,” James says.
To Tony, it feels a lot like relief.
“Bruce? Is everything okay?” Steve asks, and it’s obvious he cares. There’s worry in his voice.
“You’re the nerd, nerd,” Bucky says, leaning down to kiss Clint on top of the head, like he does every morning. “What do you think all the angles you calculate off the top of your head are? Social Studies? No. Geometry is math.”
Tony laughs.  “Try obnoxious.  I was always in trouble.”
“So we just need to get someone in to place them,” Clint asks.  “How many have you got?”
“Not at the moment,” Bruce says. “James-- I’d like to officially introduce you to Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson. Natasha got us off the mountain and Sam kept you alive while I was melting down.”
“No bet. I’m with you on two out of three,” Tony says.  “But if that really is a sink, and you somehow get me to agree it was a good idea to rip it out of the wall and pack it for our slumber party, I’ll owe you a burger and fries.  How’s that?”
“You promise you’ll be back?” Tony asks.
“You own a jet,” Jonathan snaps.  “I’m sure you can get yourself home.”
Steve can imagine why to someone like Tony that would have been a godsend.
He goes for a certain level of chill when he opens the door, and it’s immediately lost the second he actually sees Steve. They’ve been texting so much, Tony’s completely forgotten exactly what being close to him feels like.
“He’s-- Clint’s--” Natasha looks up toward the flames on top of the parking garage where Clint was perched. Steve can see part of it has crumbled. A few cars are teetering over the edge. “Go get him,” Natasha urges.
Natasha reaches into her secret drawer, picks up yet another gun, and hands it to Tony.
“And you’re an expert, huh?” Tony demands.  “You don’t know shit about me.  If you’re going to clutch your pearls over bedroom talk, maybe next time don’t sit at the grown up table.”
Steve shakes his head. “I’d never stop feeling bad about it if I did that.”
our anniversary, so if you wanted something more your speed, that would have been okay, too.”
Steve laughs, and after a moment, Tony does, too.
James looks at Bruce.
“But mostly he wanted us gone because no one was going to get anything by us,” Bucky says.
Bruce hadn’t referenced Tony’s last name when he mentioned him as a friend, but it’s no surprise that the soldier put it together.
Steve pauses to look between his two school pictures at the end.  The next to last shows Steve looking tiny and fierce.  In his senior portrait he looks a lot more laid back and he’s practically doubled in size.
He smirks down at the screen as Tony explains in great detail how terribly, horrendously boring Orlando is while sober.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam takes the ICER out and takes aim.
There are no words for the level of delight on Tony’s face when Steve confesses his bout of jealousy. They’re in bed, and they were about to go to sleep, except now Tony’s bouncing on the mattress with excitement.
Not monetarily. Or yes-- it is worth a lot of money. But Tony more means how much it’s worth to him personally.
He’d loved this quilt.  He’d taken it with him when he’d gone to MIT.  The night his parents had died he’d cocooned himself in it and shut out the world.  He’d stayed with Rhodey’s family for a few weeks after that, and when he’d left the Rhodes home to move back into his parents’ empty house he’d left the blanket behind.
It’s impossible not to notice the way Steve watches him after that.  Like Tony’s doing something a lot more impressive than cleaning up.  (+10 secret Tony points)
“Sorry, doc.  Didn’t want to tell you in private because if we start whispering behind James’s back it’s gonna put him on edge, and if he’s on edge, the chances of me getting stabbed go way up.”
“Your security team is the problem,” Clint says.
He watches the buildings go past.  Considers Tony’s words.  Waits for Tony to speak and fill in the quiet but Tony doesn’t.  Just weaves through traffic when he can, and sits patiently at the lights when he can’t.
“JARVIS, can you turn us on some cartoons?” Clint asks.
The opposing teams were a different story. Steve’s not even convinced they’re homophobic so much as they were looking for a way to get him off his game and as much as he hates to admit it, it had worked.
“What if
He shuffles a step back.  The level of self-control it takes causes him physical pain.
“Spy games?” Bruce guesses.
Tony won’t return his calls. Won’t even read the texts anymore. And Steve’s lost everything except his game.
And he does do it. Once he sits at the first table of veterans, the years fall away. They tell stories, they laugh, they reminisce. They’ve brought their families, and point out their children and their grandkids and their great-grandkids out on the dance floor.
“Aren’t there yet in our relationship,” Tony says, bailing Steve out from the awkwardness. “It’s fine. I’m not upset. It’d be a dick move to be pissed at the people trying to protect me.”
“You here to kill me?” James asks after Tony introduces himself.
“Awwwwww, Katie’s found a frieeeeeend,” Clint sings.
Steve considers it.  “I don’t...”  He trails off.  There’s really no point in denying the crush.  Clint’s clearly figured it out.  So instead he just focuses on the rest.  “Would you?  Just to make sure he’s safe?”
Steve glances in the rear view mirror and sees Clint shove at Natasha like they’re brother and sister and all of 6 years old.
“Not your best plan,” Steve agrees.  “You know if you ever want to break things off with me we can just talk about it, right?”
Tony pouts out his bottom lip slightly.  “I guess you’ve got a point.”
“Yes, Sir?”
The door swings open and Natasha walks in before tugging the door closed behind her.
“Awwwww, egg, no.”
“Buck--” Steve says, sounding exasperated in a way that probably means this is the second half of an argument that happened while Tony was downstairs.
He stops the stretcher next to mattress. The monitors begin to ping James’s accelerated heart rate and elevated respiration. James’s eyes open at the noise and his working hand grips the handle of the knife more tightly.
“I think you are,” Steve says.
Tony nods.  “I really do.  Now come on, Captain Lazy.  Unless you’re a fan of sleeping on the floor we need to get started on the bed.  J?  You get permission from Clint or Nat yet?”
“M’not your date, bro. And I’ve got Jenny for the weekend. I’m picking her up as soon as I get you out the door.”
Dum-E chirps happily, and by the time Steve lowers his phone, Tony’s composed half of his resignation letter in his head.
it. The Stars win.
“You’ll need to be more specific,” Jarvis says.
It’s only just out of his mouth when suddenly Steve seems to realize what he’s just said and he jerks up abruptly.
“It was your idea,” Tony points out. “Why are you getting all flappy?”
“How?” Steve asks.
If Steve gets even an inkling Tony isn’t one-hundred percent on board with what they’re doing he’ll slow this down to an absolute crawl.
Bruce nods, shakily, and moves forward. He glances at Clint who waves him off with his working hand.
“I’ve done an awful damn lot,” Steve snaps.  His words come out loud.  Frustrated.  “And believe it or not, I don’t wake up every morning hoping to pick a fight with you.  Whatever I did that pissed you off, if you’d just tell me--”
“The old-fashioned way,” Steve says.  By his smile, Tony can tell he approves.  +10 points (Tony’s secret points) for not fucking up the first conversation of the night.
“I’m tired,” James admits. “More tired.”
“Well then,” Steve says, chewing on his bottom lip for a moment.  “Platonic friendship it is.”
“I’m not seeing him,” Clint answered over the comms.  “Wasn’t he supposed to go to Asgard prison?”
Steve gasped for breath, his chest heaving as he sucked the air in and out.  “What?” he asked, tearing his gaze away from the tenement building to look down at her.  “What did you say?”
And Tony had just dragged all of that out for everyone to see.  At dinner time no less.
As he leaned against the window, he remembered the calm that had come over him in the Valkyrie after the Red Skull had disappeared into the hole torn in the very fabric of the universe — not so different from the one Tony had flown into with the nuke.  Steve had felt settled, like he could finally lie down and rest.  He would put the plane into the water, where the bombs couldn’t hurt anyone, especially anyone in his beloved city.  He had completed his mission; he had fulfilled his purpose.
In return, Steve took her to Brooklyn.
The look she had every time she’d been told to move and instead demanded that the other person move instead.
In the dark room, with the antibiotics slowly dripping in and the hum of the air moving through vents, the beeping of the pulse ox and the rustle as Tony moved on the bed, Steve’s fears began to creep in.  He knew how sick Tony had been those last few days in January 1940 — and if he hadn’t known, he had certainly seen it in Bucky’s face, an expression Steve wasn’t used to seeing his friend direct at other people.  Tony had wasted away, hardly able to drink enough to stay hydrated, let alone eat enough.  The Depression had already melted away most of the fat Tony had had from his life in the 21st century, but the ongoing infection had burned the rest of it away, until Tony had been left gaunt, all sharp lines and angles.  With nothing else to offer, Steve had resolved to give Tony the only thing Steve was able to give — his friendship.  Unlike his ma, who had died presumably alone in the TB ward, Steve was determined to be there until the bitter end.  Steve had been grateful that Bucky understood without making him talk about it, sitting by the bedside whenever Steve couldn’t be there.
“You may not feel like you can do anything about it,” Natasha answered, “but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.”
he thought,
Tony helped him into his nicest dress pants, shirt, and tie.  He felt ashamed when he realized Steve didn’t have a suit to wear, but it was too late to find one.  Bucky and he both wore their darkest suits, complete with vests.  At the church, they flanked Steve in the front row, their dark heads bowed, while Steve kept his blond head up, staring ahead at nothing.
Steve was flushed from the beer and being out in the sun, and he’d also pulled off his button down shirt, his arms and chest pale from being hidden under the shirt.  Tony could see his chest heave as he continued to watch Tony with wild eyes.  His hands were trembling.
,” he snapped back.  “Besides, what do you know?”
The silence of the stairwell enveloped him, and Steve climbed up to his own apartment.  By the time he was in his own living room, the quiet had become oppressive.  He walked over to the record player and put on some jazz, letting the sound wash over and through him.  Steve walked over the windows facing east and looked out at the Chrysler building illuminated before him, dominating the view outside his window.
Tony’s eyes met Steve’s, and Tony couldn’t hide the confusion there, especially from Steve.  “You — don’t look right,” Tony said.  He shook his head, and Steve watched him sway a little from the movement.  “This isn’t Brooklyn.”
The memory of how Tony had looked at him then — scrawny, feisty Steve, who was too loud, and fought too much, and dreamed too big — it was something that Steve could have lived with the rest of his days.  He could have lived with that Tony, who fixed his radio and had told him with tears in his eyes that someday Steve would be the person on the outside that he felt like on the inside, that they would fix his size and his heart and his lungs, all of the things that were wrong with him.
Steve shifted, stretching out his legs and leaning his back against the glass.  Natasha settled back against him once he was still, her head in his lap.  His hand came up automatically to run his fingers through her soft damp hair, gently combing through the curls.  “And do you?  Really want to be here?”
Tony huffed a humorless laugh to himself at that but didn’t say anything further.  “What I was saying,” Steve tried again, “is that you drink quite a bit most days.  But you only drink enough to end up here on December 15.  Specifically at night.  And somehow you never sober up enough for me to let you out until the 17th.”
After that, it was like his body was running independently from his mind.  All the things he’d ever dreamed of doing came without a struggle.  It wasn’t until the Hydra agent had committed suicide that Steve stopped and considered what had happened.
Tony stood outside the Guggenheim, adjusting his scarf as he watched the crowds bustling by.  Morgan had invited him for lunch.  She was in the middle of curating an exhibit of functional documents as art: blueprints and architectural drawings, doodles that turned into buildings or robots, designs that became technology now commonplace in the pockets of people around the world.  At her insistence, Tony had lent copies of some of his own designs: the arc reactor that had started it all; the Mark VII, the prototype he’d worn to fly the nuclear bomb into space; some of the architectural drawings used in the remodel of Stark Tower when it was destroyed in the battle of New York; a schematic of the arc reactor casing from the suit he’d used the day the Ebony Maw had come to earth.
He had to.  The alternative was too awful for him to contemplate.
“I drew it over and over again.  When he told me it helped him with a heart condition, I —“  Steve stopped, suddenly embarrassed.  Natasha raised an eyebrow at him, and he continued, “Well, I asked him if it would fix my heart too.”
It was two weeks before Christmas when Tony first noticed the cough.  It started dry, before blooming into a hacking sound that brought up bright green phlegm.  It wasn’t until the shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain followed that Tony realized he was living in the era before antibiotics — or even supplemental oxygen, for that matter.
It was easy for Steve to fall into the rhythm of a mission — a clear problem to solve, the team working together to get there.  His mind focused down to that set of tasks: get to the giant, contain it so that the NYPD could evacuate the park, then subdue it.
“Maybe we should you out of that suit,” Steve said.  He crossed the back of the quinjet and squatted in front of him.  Tony directed him with a combination of quiet instructions and small gestures.  Steve started at his boots, releasing the hidden clasps and pulling off the front of them.  Tony’s feet were bare, and a light blue cotton cuff framed one ankle, the other wadded up around his calf. Tears sprang into Steve’s eyes, blurring his vision so badly he had to duck his head.
His stomach dropped, and Steve knew — completely and without any doubts — that this was the moment.  This was the moment he’d wondered about since he’d woken up here, the moment he’d agonized about and analyzed and torn himself up over.  In a few seconds, Tony was going to crash land in an alley in Brooklyn in 1939, and Steve — a younger, scrawnier, confused Steve — was going to find him there.
Steve Rogers was gay.
Tony waved away his concern.  “I’m fine.  The doctor usually makes me stay overnight — get some IV antibiotics in me, a little oxygen.  I’ll be back to driving you crazy tomorrow.”  The last statement was supposed to be a joke, but it fell flat as Tony caught the worry in Steve’s eyes as he took in the clear plastic bag containing Zosyn hanging above the IV pump and the tubing connecting Tony to the oxygen valve on the wall.
Tony’s breath came softly in and out, and Steve heard the quiet glug of the whiskey as he took another drink, the pungent smell drifting between them.  When Steve opened his eyes, Tony was watching him closely again, the bright sheen of unshed tears glimmering as he blinked.  Steve towed him the rest of the way back to the courthouse, steering him around to the back door and hustling him into the living quarters.
Tony reached over slowly, telegraphing his moves, to grab Steve’s hand.  He placed it on his chest, his own hand on top, curling their fingers around so that Steve could feel the metal casing of the arc reactor through his shirts.  The arc reactor hummed, the vibration reverberating through Steve’s hand.  “I need you to breathe with me, okay, Steve?  Just feel my chest, and breathe with me.”
To everyone’s surprise, Bucky was wrong; it was Tony who got sick first.
That person then dug into his pocket and produced the monitor attached to his EKG leads and pulse ox, offering it to Steve.  Steve’s hands reached out, completely independent from his mind, and took the monitor from Tony, their fingers brushing as he handed off the small plastic case.
When he looked back at Tony, there was understanding in Tony’s eyes.  “That’s not true, Steve,” Tony said softly.  “You have to know that.”
“Well, that explains the headache,” Tony muttered.  He rubbed a gauntlet over the chest plate, realizing that the pain he was having was from infection, not injury.  He’d experienced both enough times to know the difference.
Steve gave Bucky the most impressive glare Tony had ever seen.  “Don’t bring her into this.”
The next file was Tony Stark’s, and Steve had trouble making himself open it.  The picture attached to the bio form on the front showed a face that Steve was intimately familiar with, although the last time he’d seen it, it had been gaunt from the lost weight and prolonged infection.  The birthday mocked him: May 29, 1970.  Somehow, Tony had appeared in Brooklyn 31 years before he had even been born, only to disappear about nine months later.  Not only that — apparently Steve had known his grandparents peripherally through Bucky; his grandfather had tailored some of Steve’s clothes, and he’d even held Tony’s mother as a baby while waiting to get some pants taken in.
Despite being in the middle of the deadliest war in human history, Steve found himself content to the point where he almost felt guilty about it.  He had a purpose, and he could finally do all of the things his mind had wanted but his body had been unable to do.  And every time someone called him Cap, he thought of Tony and what he’d said when he was delirious with fever.  He looked for Tony; in villages and other units, on farms and in pubs, at strategy meetings and on the battlefield.  He never found him, but Tony’s words stayed with him.  Steve knew — he knew
“Bucky —“  Steve was at a loss.  He sat down beside Bucky and threw his arm around his shoulder.  Bucky leaned into him, his head on Steve’s shoulder.  From there, Steve could smell the pomade in his hair, feel his breath as it rippled across the hairs on his arm.  The dampness from Bucky’s tears soaked into his shirt.
“Sir has found that your eating habits run on a 5.2 week cycle, mostly based on when you order groceries, during which you fluctuate your weight, calorie intake, exercise, fat and muscle mass, the types of food you eat, where you eat, and whom you eat with.  This seems to affect the amount of time you spend with everyone else on the common floor, your physical performance, your mood, and your sleep,” Jarvis provided.
Tony threw up his hands in exasperation.  “Who cares?  They’re Dodgers tickets!  Are you really not going because Bucky told me?” Which was — not even remotely true.  Tony knew because everyone knew Captain America was born on the Fourth of July, 1918.  He had a moment of panic at Steve’s expression that it had been — would be? — a publicity stunt for the bond shows until Bucky came in from changing out of his coveralls into pajamas.
They stared at each other for a moment before Tony started up again.  “O come, O come, Emmanuel,” he sang, his baritone carrying easily through the still air, the sound haunting in the silence.
Steve slid the ring over his index finger, and it was only wide enough to brush against his first knuckle.  Natasha would understand his ma’s desire to fight for her country, the pain of her defection to America, her insistence at always getting back up regardless of what her alcoholic husband had done to her, her willingness to stand up for what she believed in, which she passed on to her son.
“Sarah died?” Tony echoed.
Steve took him to Medical, and this time he sat by Tony’s bed while they gave him antibiotics and fluids, unable to leave.  His mind filled in the gaps from one decade to the other, from when Tony had gotten sick to now.  This time, he didn’t leave, knowing that this time, Tony would die if he didn’t get better.
“I think technically nine at this point,” Steve replied dryly, hooking a thumb over his shoulder towards the moon.  “It’s definitely after midnight.”
Steve stopped in front of one of the buildings, a five-story building with a bakery on the street level.  He stepped into the doorway next to the entrance to the bakery and led the way up the staircase to the fourth floor.  Tony could tell he was struggling, as his wheezing became more audible, but there was no reasonable way to suggest they take a break on the staircase.
Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony before palming one to inspect it.  His other hand paused, the spoonful of eggs forgotten.  “What is this?” he asked, looking up at Tony.
“Don’t let him talk you into anything you don’t want to do,” Bucky said, his words difficult to hear as they went down the stairs, their footsteps ringing in the stairwell.  “And if you figure out how to do that, help a pal out.”
“Steve,” he answered, his voice barely audible, “you have to believe me, if I could, I would give it to you in an instant.  But I can’t, and it won’t help your heart conditions.”
to be inseparable.”
Steve swallowed around the lump in his throat, his eyes suddenly watery.  Tony shifted his hands so he was steering with his left and gripped Steve’s thigh with his right.  “He woulda liked this,” Steve husked out, his voice rough around the edges.
In the end, it was easier than he had expected it.  Steve heard the tears in Agent Carter’s voice, her own despair echoing through him and amplifying his own.  When he pointed the nose of the Valkyrie towards the water, his stomach swooped and dropped with the plane.  A calm spread over him as the blue of the water and the ice filled the canopy.
Steve’s hand drifted to the dog tags, and he could feel the St. Monica medal through the soft fabric of his shirt.  He would wear Tony down, smooth out his rough edges.  Surely the Tony he’d met before and the one here now were the same person — Steve just didn’t know where they existed in relation to one another.  They had been friends before and could do so again, given enough time.  And even if he never became Steve’s Tony, the one from before, that didn’t mean they couldn’t still have a meaningful friendship now.  Steve recognized it didn’t have to be the same.
The entire world seemed to be waiting, holding its breath, and the anticipation permeated Steve’s awareness even in his exhaustion.  He blinked slowly in the dark, his eyes focusing on the only light in the room as it danced within the stove, the light and shadows flickering across one wall, up onto the ceiling.  Steve could tell it was late by the almost absoluteness of the darkness enveloping him.  There was no light coming from under the door that led into the courtroom itself, no light filtering in around the edges of the blankets he’d hung over the windows to hold in the warmth.  The darkness even seemed to crowd in on the fire in the stove, as though it could contain the flames as they shimmered, the coals undulating from white to yellow to red and back again, like waves on a shore.
They arrived at Ebbett’s Field with plenty of time to spare, and Tony bought them all hot dogs and beer for lunch.  They made their way to their seats along the third base line, out by the outfield.  Bucky had brought a mitt just in case.  They sat down in their seats, with Tony towards the outfield, Steve in the middle, and Bucky towards the infield.
Howard watched him, his eyes narrowed for a moment before turning away, and jumped down to the machine that ran alongside the platform on which Dr. Erskine’s capsule sat.
“That’s not what Thor tells me — and he gets his information from Heimdall, so I’m sure it’s correct.”  Loki was still smirking as he crossed his arms over his chest.
Tony waited for a long time, becoming more and more anxious the longer she was gone.  Finally she returned, her hands clenched in front of her so tightly her knuckles were white.  She ushered Tony into a small room with a few chairs and a window opened to the hospital lawn beyond.  “Please have a seat,” she said, gesturing to the chairs.  Tony noticed that her hands were shaking, and they only stopped when she clasped them back together.  “Dr. Hudson will be right with you.”
“Jesus, Tony, I thought you were going to die.  From the pneumonia.  I meant I couldn’t sit there and watch you die.  Not that I wouldn’t take care of you when you were sick.”  Steve scrubbed a hand over his face and wondered which time he was even talking about at this point.  How he could ever explain this to Tony.
“So you’re the stray Steve’s picked up,” Bucky said, standing up.  His tone was not quite challenging, but all the laughter from a moment before was gone.  He approached Tony, and Tony felt himself standing up a little straighter, even though Bucky was only in an undershirt and pajama pants.
“My ma,” he said through clenched teeth.  “Every Irishman and woman knows how to bank a turf fire.  She taught me.”
Steve had hoped that 1940 was going to be better, but it wasn’t looking that way.
Steve understood that he had issues around food.  It didn’t take a Shield therapist to figure that one out.  He’d spent the first 25 years of his life wondering to some degree or another where his next meal was coming from.  When there had been food, he’d wondered how much he really needed, navigating the complex dynamics between first his ma and then Bucky trying to make sure Steve had enough before they would take anything and Steve trying to not to take more than his fair share.  There were days when he was so sick, his breathing so difficult, that he couldn’t eat at all, gasping for breath between sips of water.  Food was emotional and complicated and painful in ways that he hadn’t expected, and the sudden bounty of the Tower, the idea that all he had to do was ask Jarvis to order it and it would arrive at his apartment — often within mere hours — it was too much for Steve to take in.
was a failure.  His goal had been to set aside his memories and start over.  Figure out some way to live without Bucky and Tony, without anything familiar.  He knew he didn’t have any choice — this is what his life was now, in this world that had left him behind.  But instead, he felt like he had only picked up more broken pieces along the way.  He was still trying to put them back together into a shape he at least recognized, but everything he knew, every way he knew how to put them back together — it was impossible, trying to form a picture that didn't exist any more.  Instead of leaving it behind — all of it, his fears, his memories, his life, his war, his friends, his ma — instead, it had followed him.  He continued to carry his broken pieces, and he didn’t know how to give them up.  Just like his ma’s medal, he had worried at the edges so much that he’d worn them down.  But they no longer fit together, and he was just left with the weight of them, dragging him under.
shade of blue — with white clouds doting the sky.  The glass warmed against Steve’s skin, but still he replayed those last few moments in the Valkyrie over and over again, curled on the floor, thousands of feet above the city he’d saved.
Tony waved him away, feeling his cheeks warm a little.  “I wanted to.  And who’s to say I didn’t want to see the game too?  I already told all my clients I wasn’t available today.”
His hand paused in her hair before resuming his easy rhythm.  He resented her concern, her ability to cut right to the heart of the issue.  He wanted to be left alone.  He wanted his ma, and Bucky, and the Tony he had known from before.
“None taken,” Jarvis replied, his tone a little stiff.  “I think you made that point quite clear.”
Howard Stark, however, was a completely different matter.  His picture was included on the poster, and Steve spent a long time studying the familiar bone structure, the same dark wavy hair, and the same expressive eyes.  He wondered if the reproduction did justice to the actual man.
But loneliness.  Grief.  Those were things Steve was intimately familiar with.  They had originally come with him from Ireland, when he’d been forced to leave a home and family he’d loved to come to America.  America, where he’d buried his beloved ma.  Where he’d fought in the Civil War against men he’d worked with and trusted, where he’d seen such brutality and suffering he thought he couldn’t stand it anymore.  The same loneliness and grief reflected in the face of a man who would rather drink on December 16th so he could spend the day with the local sheriff than face them on his own.
Tony would have known how it was possible, and he would probably have been willing to explain it to Steve.  But he couldn’t ask Tony.
He became aware of a sound reverberating through the back part of the courthouse where he lived: a small room, with a dresser and a water basin in one corner where he made his ablutions, the bed tucked under the window, and a wood-burning stove in the corner where he did his cooking with a small table and two chairs next to it.  Steve rolled onto his side, where he could see the embers from the stove glowing hot in reds and yellows, the heat radiating off them in time to his breathing.
“I was born in 1918,” Steve answered mildly.  “What do
“I have no right to do any less than any other man for my country,” Steve yelled after him.
Bucky fixed him with a look that was all the more effective due to his red-rimmed eyes from the lack of sleep.  “You,” he started, emphasizing his point with his fork, “are not going to go visit the hospital, get pneumonia, and die.  Because then she’ll kill
“You do realize where you are?” Tony couldn’t help but ask.  “Greenwich Village?  Probably the gayest neighborhood in one of the gayest cities in the world?  Stonewall Inn is only a couple of blocks away.  There is literally a monument to gay liberation
“I bet,” Natasha grinned back at him, not fooled at all.  “Go take a shower and come to the common living room.  Let someone take care of you for a change.”
“He knows that you’re struggling to settle in and that Shield treated you like you’d break if they threw you into the future too fast.” She shrugged, wiping off her face with a towel.  “He’s trying to make sure you have everything that you need to be happy here.”
The draft board official shifted his gaze from Bucky to Steve and back again slowly, as if inspecting something he knew would be particularly difficult to get off his shoe while spit-shining it that evening.  “Good luck, soldier,” he said finally, brushing past Steve and out the apartment door.
“Hmm?” Steve said, glancing up.
After the game ended and the sun had set, Steve rode his motorcycle back to Huntington Beach and sat in the sand south of the pier.  The waves crashed against the shore, the moon leaving a long jagged band of silver across the water, and Steve could feel the humidity in the air from the ocean, feel the wind coming in cold off the water even though it was the end of June.  Despite the moving air, he was still overheated, his skin damp and clammy from sweat, and his shirt clung to him after sitting in the sun during the game.  His dog tags and the St. Monica medal were hot and sticky against his skin, under his shirt.   He closed his eyes, letting his head sag between his shoulders, leaning so far over that his forehead was almost pressed against his knees.  He let the sound and smell of the ocean wash over him, and a sob slipped out.
“Don’t crumple it,” Steve replied, taking the poster from him before he damaged it.  “I don’t know.  It’s not exactly him — but it sure looks close enough to be a relative, don’t you think?  Especially with the name?”
From Yosemite, he turned north to see the giant redwoods standing sentinel on the California coast, and he enjoyed feeling small next to the largest living organisms on the planet.
Tears sprang into Steve’s eyes at her words, and he looked away from her, shame washing over him.  She was still a friend, even if she was less familiar than Tony or Bucky.  Steve gently pushed at her shoulder, getting her to move, and stood up.  He helped her up, and she pulled him into a tight hug.  “It’ll get better, Steve, I promise — it just takes time,” she whispered in his ear, pressing a soft kiss to his cheek.
If they were in his time, Tony would have hired him on the spot for his resourcefulness and cleverness.
It was Steve’s turn to laugh at that.  “They would have been unstoppable.  The world wouldn’t have known what hit it.”
He fell asleep, surrounded and protected by the three loves of his life, each different: talismans against anything that could go wrong tomorrow, when Steve’s entire life would change.
Tony faltered for only a second before recovering, feeling a little lightheaded from the realization he was shaking his own grandfather’s hand.  “It’s a pleasure,” he managed to get out, but not without earning a questioning look from Bucky.
It became clear very quickly on the Quinjet that Tony didn’t know him, didn’t remember their time in Brooklyn together.  There was no recognition from Tony at all — no glimmer of humor, no flash of understanding.  He cracked jokes but was all business underneath the humor.  Steve could tell that he was uncomfortable, but he couldn’t tell why.  It got even worse back on the Helicarrier.  Steve alternated between feeling overjoyed at seeing for himself that Tony was alive and apparently well and despondent about the loss all over again, given Tony’s aloof demeanor.  He tried to throw out references to things Tony would have known from their time together in the Depression, even knowing that Tony wouldn’t pick up on them.  All he got for commenting on Fury’s flying monkeys comment was an eye-roll, even though they had seen
Tony wandered back into the living room.  He gave the couch a skeptical look, but there wasn’t anywhere else to lie down, unless he wanted to sleep at the kitchen table.  He kicked off his tennis shoes — at least they were dark on top with only white around the soles — and wrapped himself in one of the afghans.
It was a beautiful summer day, the wind blowing in off the ocean, when they left Malibu in Tony’s R8 and drove east.  The air cleared as I-15 carried them out of the LA Basin through the San Gabriel mountains.  Eventually the green pines and craggy cliffs gave way to desert.  The wind blew sand across the interstate, and Tony and Steve stopped in the ghost town of Halloran Springs to argue about whether to put up the roof.  Steve won, insisting that it wasn’t a proper road trip if you couldn’t feel the wind in your hair, and Tony conceded less than gracefully, grousing under his breath about sunburns and better living through the technology that was air conditioning.
“Dr. Hudson said she started coughing up blood before she passed out.  She stopped breathing on her own, and she died at 10:48 last night,” Tony said slowly.  “He said she didn’t suffer at all and seemed very peaceful at the end.”
Natasha rolled her eyes before squaring her shoulders.  “Want me to beat you up in an alley to make you feel more at home?” she shot back.
The notes hung in the air after he’d stopped singing.  Steve laced his fingers together, still holding Tony’s gaze.  “What are you mourning, Tony?”
“You’d have the Howling Commandos.  You could shape the future of Shield, be there with Director Carter to build it.  Howard would be there.”
And despite how he felt about being in the Army, his body struggled to rise to the challenge.  He had asthma attacks and episodes of atrial fibrillation from the exertion.  He would struggle to breathe or have crushing chest pain during the runs or be so exhausted at night he had a hard time falling asleep.
When it was all over, when they had tried shawarma at Tony’s insistence and almost fallen asleep at the table, when Fury had dismissed them, Steve went back to the apartment.
?” Steve said.  He leaned back to look up at her.  “It’s — it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”
, how long have you been carrying this burden?” she asked, her fingers still gently kneading into his scalp, soothing as they kept a steady rhythm.
Steve had no concept of time passing while he turned that image over and over in his mind.  He could smell mint and eucalyptus hanging heavy in the steam from the bath, the feel of Tony’s muscles and bones under Steve’s hands as he helped Tony get cleaned up.  Darning the socks.  The machines that Tony fixed.  The new suits and hat and the hot summer day, the lukewarm beer as they watched the Dodgers beat the Cubs on a perfect 4th of July.  Tony watching Steve draw at the drafting table as he sketched out his designs.
She startled a laugh out of Steve with that.  She reminded him so strongly of Bucky in that moment, with his cocksure attitude, that extra bit of showmanship.  “If I have to do it on my toes, you’ll need to,” Steve teased back.  He approached her on the mat, staying out of her reach as they circled one another.  She cocked her head to the side, grinning at him again.  Suddenly, she rushed him, getting into his space.  Steve threw a punch, which she easily dodged.  She hooked an arm around his outstretched one and rolled herself up onto his back.  Her weight threw him off balance, and he staggered for a moment as she wrapped an arm around his neck.  He reached around and pulled her off over his shoulder.  She used the momentum to tumble forward out of his grasp and slide between his legs, which she swept out from under him from behind.  He fell heavily onto his chest and rolled over to look up at her.  She smirked and offered him a hand.  “Want to try that again?  You don’t mind your legs very well.”
“No, I’m okay,” he tried to say kindly, but even Steve could tell that he fell short.  “I don’t think I’m very hungry anymore though.”
Bucky patted his shoulder again, gently.  “You don’t have to say anything.  I don’t know how you feel — you’re a tough read,” Bucky said.  “But I can see how he feels.  So just — do what you gotta do — but be kind.  That’s all I ask.”
“Nat told me you have pneumonia,” he answered after a moment.  “She said that you have medications to treat it now.”  He hesitated again, and the statement was almost a question.  “I just needed to see for myself you were okay.”
Steve was next to him, helping him into a sitting position.  “Jesus Christ, Tony, what the hell was that?” he asked, and Tony looked over to see Steve pale, his blue eyes wide in fear.
“Stark,” Natasha explained shortly, following his gaze over her own shoulder.  “He’s been doing it since nightfall.”  She paused, pushing her face close to his, and she pulled his attention from the gaps between the buildings where the sound was drifting towards them back to her.  “If you don’t make him stop, I’m going to shoot him to put him out of his misery and then shoot you for dereliction of duty.”
The people staffing the concierge were very helpful in pointing him to the bank of private elevators at the back of the lobby, and with Jarvis’s assistance, Steve found himself riding up to the floor Tony had set aside for him personally.  The elevator opened out into a well-appointed hallway, and his front door led into the living area of an apartment — his apartment, he supposed.  There were floor-to-ceiling windows that lined the east and north walls.  Steve abandoned his bag on the floor, drawn to the view of the art deco top of the Chrysler Building just east of Stark Tower.  When he looked north, he could see Rockefeller Center to the northwest and part of Central Park beyond.
Steve stiffened, no longer relaxed and suddenly cold.  “What do you mean?”
Bucky blinked sleepily then narrowed his eyes, suddenly more awake.  “It’s Sarah, isn’t it?” he asked, his voice pitched low so as not to carry.  He was already swinging his legs out of bed, pulling his pajama pants on.  Tony just nodded, and Bucky pulled a t-shirt over his head before shuffling out of the room.  “Sorry, pal,” he said, pausing as he passed Tony.  “I wouldn’t have asked you —”
Clint slowly relaxed around Steve, becoming friendly.  He even went so far as to offer a handshake and a word of thanks for Steve’s easy acceptance on the Helicarrier after Natasha had cognitively recalibrated him.  Their camaraderie was cemented after that during a poker game — Natasha’s suggestion — that was so cutthroat due to all three cheating that they finally had to settle it in the gym — where Natasha won.
“Tony?”
The silence stretched on for a moment, and Steve could feel his discomfort amplify.  “I was — darning some socks,” Steve finally explained, “and he just — threw them away.”  The explanation made him feel ridiculous now that he said it out loud.  Natasha didn’t immediately respond, and Steve found her looking at him narrowly, her expression thoughtful.
“No, Tony,” Steve answered.  He gathered him into his arms for the second time that night, lifting him easily from the ground.  Steve carried him back inside and gently sat him on the edge of the bed.  He gathered the washbasin, a cake of soap, and a couple of towels from the stand.  Placing the kettle on the stove, Steve poured some of the water into it to warm it.  As he waited, he braced his arms against the table, his shoulders bunched up around his ears.
Natasha was the one who told him that Tony had pneumonia a few weeks later.  Steve had to admire her preparation: she invited him down to her apartment, got him settled on the couch with a blanket, some popcorn, and a movie before she said anything.  He was perfectly content, slouched down into the couch with the warm, solid bulk of her thigh beneath his cheek, the blanket wrapped around his shoulders.  He was even starting to drowse, something he couldn’t usually do with the TV on.  She had her fingers in his hair, gently scratching at his scalp with her nails the way he liked.  “Just so you know,” she said, her voice soft and pitched low so it only just penetrated his wandering, sleepy thoughts, “Tony is being observed overnight in the Tower medical facilities.  Bruce told me he has pneumonia.  They’re giving him antibiotics.”
There are scans upon scans on every display, and blueprints (both computer print outs and hand drawn) all over the desk.  Tony has light holograms aimed onto the ceiling and there are  3d projections hovering over the floor.  The room around Steve looks unreal.  Dum-E and U roll continuously back and forth across the lab, bringing Tony tools, or fresh pencils, or a bottle of water he didn’t request but seemed to need.
She drops her voice to a lower pitch and says in a vaguely Brooklyn accent, “Feet off the dash.  We’re only
Good Morning New York is his favorite.  They’ve tried to book him a few times but he’s politely declined.  It’s nice to sit back and watch and just... not.  The publicity tours are just about the only thing about his old life he doesn’t miss.
Bruce won’t force this.
Rhodey laughs. “Not incest. I thank God every single day that we aren’t related. Come on. Get up. You’ve got to go to this thing. You’ve got to show the world that last week was a blip on the road to recovery. You’ve been sober for more than a year, Tones. One slip up doesn’t have to ruin everything you’ve worked for.”
“Guess that makes Cap the winner,” Clint says.
Clint shifts awkwardly in his chair to turn to look at Bruce.
“No more missions out of the country,” Steve says.  “It’s as easy as that.”
“Arghhhhhhh, I was nineteeeeeen,” Bucky groans.
Tony shrugs. “I don’t know. It’s not like there was a list of questions. She just said we should talk about... expectations. Needs. Wants. Feelings. It’s stupid.”
He feels far more human when he wakes up a little after 2 PM. Steve is still asleep.
“Holy shit!” Clint exclaims.
YOU’RE GOING TO COACH MY TEAM???
Clint nods toward the elevator where Bruce is exiting.  The scientist looks adorably exhausted, with wild hair and a wrinkled lab coat.
“There’s an exhibit of my things at the Smithsonian,” Steve says gently.  “They’re on loan from Stark Industries and I’d like them back.”
“Thank you,” Tony says.  “For-- all that.”  He gestures upward to indicate what had happened in his room and then leans against the wall for support.
Which just makes Bruce laugh. “That’s where you saw me? That was six weeks ago.”
It’s hard to say goodbye at all.
“Me? I’m the one being dramatic? You’re the one who walked in here, told me to end the first happy relationship I’ve had in years, and then threatened to set fire to the guy’s career if I didn’t. Steve deserves better than that.”
“I’ve watched weeks worth of footage of you.  Maybe months.  And I’ve never seen you smile like you smiled at those texts.”  Steve lets the words hang out there for a moment and reaches up like he’s going to touch the spot where Tony hit his head.  When his hand gets close, he hesitates.  “Sorry. I know you asked me not to--”
“He talked about you a lot,” she says. “I know it’s not any of my business but I’m wondering.... hoping... is this more than friendship for you?”
Tony stops.  It’s curiosity that makes him turn. (Someday he will learn his lesson about curiosity) (Unless he runs through all 9 lives first.)
“The first time we met, you said you found me because you had questions about Steve,” Bruce says. “You wanted information about him you couldn’t find in books. Why?”
“If you’ve got something to say, say it,” Steve challenges.
They might even invent some rules in their one-on-one game, just so they can break those too.
Tony gives Steve a small, sharp smile.  “You might be surprised.”
“Not nooooow. Sleep now,” Steve insists.
The food is pretty good, so buffet trips are plentiful. They still manage never to get within 10 feet of each other. At least until they are straight-up wrangled by a bossy old woman that barely comes up to Steve’s chest into getting a picture together with her. She grabs Steve by the hand and drags him over to Tony’s side.
“Baby, you couldn’t buy me if you tried.”
Here Steve’s voice breaks a little.  “I served time so they wouldn’t have to. By the time I got back, they’d all moved in with each other and already had jobs at Stark Industries.  Clint knew someone in the HR Department who hooked them up.  Overlooked some forged credentials.  That’s where they met Sam and Kate.  And when I got back they were willing to overlook my prison record, too.  There are rules about it SI.  You don’t hire criminals.”
“Holy shit,” Steve says. “This is amazing. These guys were my heroes growing up.”
“Awesome.  I’ll text you,” Clint says.  “And hey--look. Bigfoot’s back.”
Or if he does, no one will ever know.
Steve naively thinks they might get a couple thousand views by Christmas if they’re lucky. The video shatters every 24/48/72 hour record that’s ever been set on YouTube.
“You’re spending too much time with Clint,” Steve says. “You’re stealing his best lines.”
“You didn’t have to,” Steve says.  “I’ve got lots of experience with being shown the door.”
“God, I hope so,” Tony says.  He climbs onto the bed and leans in toward Steve to kiss him.  “I wasn’t sure where you planned to sleep.  I was hoping it would be with me.”
“I know,” the soldier says. “He’s an idiot.”
“What?” Tony asks.
“So I’ve heard. Maybe next time we do this while you’re asleep,” Tony suggests. “Small talk has changed in the last 70 years. Let’s keep it to the weather, Mr. Van Winkle.”
The whole team groans.
“Is this okay?” he asks.
The elevator comes to a stop and Steve gets a glimpse of the penthouse as Tony pushes off the wall and steps away.
Bruce takes a second to compose himself.  It’s not every day you get to break Captain Americas heart. Bruce can’t let that matter. James is his concern now. He can deal with his own weird friendship issues later. For now it’s Elsa time: Conceal. Don’t feel.
“It’s nothing against the guy,” Clint explains.  “He’s hardly ever down here so seeing him is like spotting something legendary.  There’s this game some of us play.  It’s stupid.  But like-- you get 10 points for a Bigfoot sighting, 10 points for tagging management with a post it note, 10 points for paging a punny fake name over the office intercom without getting caught, 10 points for deliberately leaving your fly down all day, 10 points for relocating Steve’s lunch.  20 points for making Steve swear.  Here... there’s a list.”
Steve can’t tell if Bruce is kidding or not, but the thought of tossing eggs at Dr. Wilkes car brings a smile to Steve’s face.
“We’ll tape them inside my bra, dear.  I’ll tell them I have a pacemaker.  You think they’re going to pat down an old lady there?”
And then after a few seconds pass another message comes through.
“Your attention was where it needed to be,” Sam agrees.
Tony gives him a smile that’s so real and so softly kind, Steve doesn’t know what to do with it.
and out like a lamb.
Bruce can't help but admire that James picked up Clint's casually careful wording that had neglected to mention his thoughts on Tony. With every interaction it is more and more obvious that James is genius level smart. He'd have to be, really, to do the things he's done.
Tony nods.
When he approaches the building, the front door slides open all on its own.
And it’s a good thing it’s a light bump, since Tony’s pretty sure Steve’s hips could put a man through a brick wall if he put any force behind them.  And isn’t
Steve laughs.  “Then let’s make it gelato and you have yourself a deal.”
James nods, picks up a few things from the table, and disappears down the hall. It's hard for Bruce not to worry. Bruce doesn’t know if James has a complicated relationship with water due to any HYDRA torture.  He doesn’t know if the metal arm needs special care if it gets wet.  He can’t even be sure that Bucky’s been given the option of a bath in the last 70 years or what decade hot water taps were invented.
“You seem like you like me well enough.”
“It wouldn’t be deliberate,” Clint adds, to clear up James’s suspicion.
“Cartoons,” James agrees. He says it quickly enough that it might be the most emphatic decision he’s made yet.
“These guys are no joke,” Bucky adds. “And for this kind of money they’re gonna show up at your doorstep in droves.”
“Really?” Steve asks.  “They fooled me.”
“The sedative you used,” Bruce says. “Can it be extracted from the bullets and injected some other way?”
“Bruce— give me one second,” Steve says into the phone, even if he’s not sure where to go that’s going to give him any more privacy.  All the store fronts looks the same.  Shops.  Restaurants.  Busy.
Tony hears shuffling behind him.
“I work really hard on those non-disclosure agreements,” Pepper says.
“Okay?” Steve asks.
James’s head snaps to the left to first look at Bruce and then at the back porch beyond him. He begins to cough as he sucks in air too fast.
Which makes sense.  Of course Howard would have collected his stuff.  That was Howard.  And it makes sense Stark Industries would loan it out.  The hurt he feels, that no one-- well, Tony in this case-- would think that maybe he’d want his stuff back is unreasonable.  It doesn’t belong to him now.
“They’ll be okay,” Steve mumbles, this time mostly to himself.
They’re to the last ladder between them and the ground.
“I’m going to do everything I can to make sure he’s safe and healthy,” Steve says.  “I promise, I’ll take the best care of him I can.”
“You’re something. He’s got problems,” James insists.
“You didn’t give those orders to yourself,” Clint points out.
He’s staring straight forward, as if anticipating orders to hold still. He looks up in surprise when Bruce holds out the brick.
“Well... yes?” Bruce says. “Distance can give people perspective.”
Steve cuts off the TV as the audience joins her in her mean-spirited laughter.  The whole lot of them can go straight to hell.
“I’m not asking you not to go,” Tony says.  “I’m just asking if you’ll be back here sometime tonight or if we’re going to meet back at the tower.”
Steve shrugs. “That’s what he said. She plays for one of the traveling teams around here. The Wildcats. Apparently she’s pretty good.”
When the plates and mugs are nothing but shards and dust, Steve picks up the empty box and walks toward the pile.
“24 hours?” Steve asks, once he and Tony are clearing the table.
He shrugs, as if there’s nothing to be done.
Steve lowers his head and kisses Tony’s collarbone, and then again, down across his ribs.  He trails a finger over Tony's scars, like had had so many times in his fantasies.  Real life is so much better.
“I’ll get that,” Bucky offers, manhandling Clint up onto the table so he can lick the ranch smear off Clint's shirt.
Steve smiles. He puts his hand on the small of Tony’s back and tugs him closer.
going to cry.  He clears his throat and smiles again.
“Sounds like, doesn’t it?”  Tony forces down the urge to fight.  When he speaks again he manages to dial down the hostility a notch.  “Barnes needs brought in.  It’s not safe for him to be out there on the loose.  But what you’re going to do with him once you’ve got him--  once he’s here--”  Tony shrugs.  “I’ve got no fix for that.”
“Did it start with Howard?” Steve asks.  “Or his mother?”
“Ummm.  This is kind of awkward.  I was just-- I was wondering about-- if you could erase things from the internet?”
James is watching them banter and Bruce can see a hint of a smile there despite some pretty obvious nerves. Clint joins Bruce by the bed and waits for James to give him permission before plopping down on the bed next to him.
Tony nods this time.  It’s shaky but there.
me--”
“It’s not about your father,” Steve says.
Steve pauses.  Looks over at Tony, and the smile Steve gives him is small and real.  “Yeah.  Think I do.  Thanks.  That was probably a lot to listen to.”
“Tony, so help me, I swear, if you say Doctor Hulk one more time you’re going to meet him,” Bruce warns. “And I don’t think you’d like his bedside manner.”
Steve’s daydreaming.  Shit.
James’s expression is dangerous. Predatory, even, but Bruce understands why Clint isn’t making a run for it. That would only make things worse. Thankfully once Clint’s down on his rear, James lowers the scissors a few inches.
Smooth.
JARVIS had texted Clint an address overnight, so he’s the one to share it with James and Bruce. The texts Bruce receives over the course of the morning and during his hike are all from Tony and mostly they’re GIFs. When interpreted one after the other as a story, they seem to indicate that the occupants of the tower are having a rough morning.  Progressively as: Depressed Cat, Frantic Cat, Grumpy Cat, Drinking Blankly from the Sink Cat (Bruce hopes that’s a metaphor), Gives Zero Fucks Cat, and then back to Depressed Cat again. There’s also a random picture of a falcon, but Bruce isn’t even going to attempt to interpret that one.
He squelches the line of reasoning that leads him to his parents.  There be dragons.
“He always did,” Steve says.  Then he pauses, like he’s trying to think how to phrase something. “You like him, don’t you?”
“Not this minute, I don’t,” Tony says.  “James is going to need a couple of serious surgeries to remove the internal components that are in there before I can go attaching anything.  It’s important-- but it can wait.”
Bruce ends up napping in his chair after he shoots off his grocery requests to Tony.  He isn’t sure how much time passes before James’s neural alarms beep and Bruce wakes with a start. James comes to consciousness a few minutes later.
Clint’s presence means Tony and Steve are a little less handsy in washing each other, and it also results in a sort of awkward
“Careful you don’t choke,” Steve says, passing him his messy scraps. “We’re not in the best position for eating.”
“I think I might have wasted a trip,” Steve says.
It’s the guilt from his earlier rudeness that gets Steve moving, and maybe also the newish edge in Tony’s voice.  Tony’s walking fast but Steve easily catches up.  They take the stairs instead of the elevator, down to an R&D floor Steve’s never visited.  There’s a kitchen there, and Tony yanks down mugs and plates and dumps them in a cardboard box that had previously held paper towels, according to the print on the side.
“Bogotá,” she whispers into his ear, and then she walks away.  The elevator doors open for her automatically, then close behind her as Tony takes the seat she vacated on the couch.
“That must have been fun,” Steve laughs.
“Sounds like a tool,” Steve says, giving Tony’s hand a light squeeze.
It helps (and helps is not the right word here because it’s an awful gift sometimes) that Tony’s got such a vivid imagination.  It also helps that Tony’s seen Steve’s laptop screen of horrors and has loads of HYDRA acquired data sitting there in his brain, ready to paste itself onto Rhodey.
“I don’t get why you like him so much,” Rhodey says. “I’m way cooler than this guy.”
“You know, this feels a lot like a conversation I’d usually have with Tony,” Bruce says, stepping into the living room.  His smile tells Kate that he doesn't consider this a bad thing.
Tony lifts an eyebrow.
He flops down on the couch and Steve follows, taking a seat on the other end.  Tony drapes a blanket over himself and it’s endearing to see that it’s not an expensive blanket or a fancy one.  This blanket is well loved.
“I can still drive you,” Steve pleads.
Steve dresses for a mission.  Not his usual sort of mission.  No, this one is going to be a whole hell of a lot more difficult than a bunch of killer robots or venomous super-slugs.
Tony turns his face to stare out the window without saying a word.
Still here?
“I do,” Bruce confirms. “I absolutely do. James, when you defied your orders, maybe it was a malfunction or maybe it was the fundamental
“Shit,” Bruce swears. “That’s important information. Yes, your arm isn’t functional. We had to disconnect the wires to keep you alive. I’m sorry. Tony can fix it though-- either fix the arm that’s on you or make you a new one. Whatever you want.”
“I thought being here tonight
“Confirmed,” she says.  And then in a different, more affectionate tone.  “Stay safe.”
Tony ignores him and looks at the list more closely.  He can’t help but smile, because the whole list is horrifically unprofessional and hilariously awesome.
“I’m a genius.  Try me,” Tony says.
“Thank you,” Steve says genuinely.  “That’s more than I could have hoped for.”
tell me I’m not dreaming,” Tony says. “And that you’re telling the truth. And also that I can retell this story to Rhodey word for word.”
Tony whines at the loss of weight against him and Steve looks down apologetically.  “Bucky’s not wrong.  This is serious.  Didn’t mean to get us distracted.”
James must notice Bruce’s discomfort, because he pulls the jeans back up quickly, and his body goes tense again. He sits absolutely still and stares straight ahead, the slight tremble in his jaw the only visible evidence that he isn’t a statue. Bruce recognizes the posture. James did something Bruce made obvious he didn’t like and now he’s waiting for punishment.
James lowers his face. He ends up putting both hands on the cushion he’s sitting on and  bracing himself there.
Tony rolls his eyes and holds out his hand.  Clint lays the phone down, which is ridiculously considerate.  Tony picks it up and types in his number.  He hands the phone back to Clint, who proceeds to group text the photo of them to a half dozen numbers.  Bucky’s phone vibrates and Tony’s text alert pings.
“Of course.”
“Well, that and we’re complete shits sometimes,” Clint admits.
“Out us. People are going to find out. Might as well be on our terms.”
“Everyone else is hitching a ride with SHIELD or gonna stick around to make sure the bad guys gets sorted out correctly,” Steve says.
The line goes dead.
Steve smiles.  “No,” he says.  He takes the stool nearest to the end.  “I’m here to see you.”
“If I was half as good a person as people think I am, I’d probably say yes,” Steve says.  “But if it was me I don’t think I’d want to know.  It’s water under the bridge now.  She’s forgiven you once.  I’m not sure she should have to do it again.  It’s up to you, though.  Whatever you decide, I’ll support you.”
considering the rest of the damage Tony’s viewing.
Tony shrugs.  “I’m not going to evict a single mother and her kids, Steve.  Now help me bend this netting into the right shape before I slip it over the edge.  Maybe there’s shit all we can do about Barnes.  Doesn’t mean we can’t save someone else.”
Steve’s setting some career records. Tony’s on the path to set some league records. They’re both way too busy to meet up. At least until the week between when the regular season ends and their playoffs begin.
It’s stupid.  It’s selfish.  Peggy would smack him upside the head if she ever caught him feeling this sorry for himself when he’s alive and safe and for once nobody is dead.
“Of course. We’ve got about a thousand pucks around here. Think I could spare one or two.”
“Steve wants you home,” Bruce says gently.
“I know,” Clint says. “And it’s all good. I’m not keeping a record of wrongs here. I am gonna go take a walk, though. You okay here?”
Steve puts down the knife and peanut butter and slides down to his knees.  He presses a few soft kisses to Tony’s thigh, then looks up at him.
JARVIS usually reserves his sass for Tony.  Steve’s always wondered why Tony enjoyed that so much but now he sort of gets it.
The ride up is mundane.  There’s no loud music playing in the elevator, no flashing lights or surprises.  When the elevator stops and a polite voice suggests Steve exit, he does, and he’s in a room he recognizes.  It’s where they found Loki after the battle of New York.  It’s nicer now.  Finished.
Steve shakes his head. “I can’t. It’s just-- a friend.”
“And whose fault is that?” Tony snaps.
“I didn’t know where else to put you.  You’re gross.”
“I taught Dum E how to draw,” Steve says proudly. “This is his second try. There was an incident with the first. A spilled drink. Then fire.”
Which makes Steve laugh, because it is so like a Stark to create a smartass artificial intelligence.
“Let me, Tony,” Bruce says. “James, you’re going to need to close your eyes and I know that won’t be easy if you don’t trust the person next to you. And if it will help to ground you, I don’t mind you holding your knife.”
Real life has been kind of a pain lately so if you'd like to keep up with updates, see my random drabbles or ask me questions, you can find me at
“The Other Guy can sense danger. Sometimes. If I’m paying attention. You wouldn’t register as danger.”
Steve leans back against the wall and tries not to think about it. It’s easier not to.
“Think James would mind if I take a nap in here?”
“I know it’s ridiculously late,” Bruce continues, “but I’m thinking of making a stir fry since there’s food here and I haven’t had the luxury of a kitchen in a while. I can make a side of rice in broth, if you want to give it a try? When I was living in India, that would be the first food I’d introduce to anyone recovering from stomach issues.”
The group only make it through three trays of fries throughout the night, but that’s because the shots and the beer are endless. Infinite. Especially for Steve and Tony since they’re the ones everyone is celebrating. By last call, Tony is sloppy, floppy drunk. Steve’s not faring much better as they follow their friends through the door and pour out onto the sidewalk. The whole lot of them are laughing and stumbling and leaning on each other for support.
The first time Tony’d invaded Steve’s privacy, it was a momentary lapse of judgement.  A split-second decision to figure out what the hell Steve had been staring at for four days straight.  It was back during that first week when Steve had moved in, and he, Romanoff and Wilson had set up shop in the common room.
Except Steve is an Avenger, and as Tony had requested two years before, Steve had stayed out of it in that moment.  But it has been haunting him every moment since.  He can’t leave this one alone. There’s no way to interfere that won’t piss Tony off and Steve doesn’t care.  He’s protecting him, end of story.   It’s the right thing to do.
Natasha gives Tony a genuine smile.  “Glad you decided to join us, Iron Man.”
Tony eyes him skeptically.  “Okay.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Show me your wartime medic skills.  They did have penicillin back then, right?”
“I thought the waitstaff was going to send out a search party,” Bruce says.
“Why are you doing, this?” Tony asks.   It hurts.  It’s causing him physical pain to know whatever this is, it’s going to be ripped away from him as quickly as it was given.
“Oh,” Steve says. “Good.” He can’t make himself sound the least bit sincere.
Steve stands and Natasha follows him to her feet.  She reaches down a hand to tug at Tony’s elbow since he’s not moving.  He stands and follows his friends out the back door, and they quickly walk without speaking down the hall to where the limo is waiting.  Tony’s heart is racing.  He’s not sure what to make of Steve’s defense.  He’s grateful.  Confused maybe.  Feelings are
“A circuit board if you’ve got an extra one,” Bruce adds, eyeing their haul.  “And as much gunpowder as you can spare.”
Tony feels his chest tighten.  He hates to think about this stuff.  Especially hates the part where he can hear admiration in Steve’s voice.  It will always feel undeserved.
Steve's blood runs cold.  He was in show business long enough to know exactly what he's watching.  It might seem impromptu, but this whole bit is as contrived as if it's been scripted.  No doubt Shayla's going to have a book coming out soon, or a fragrance, or an album.  Something.  And this-- this whole act-- is just her way of prolonging her fifteen minutes of fame into something slightly more marketable.  At Tony’s expense.
He waits for her to join him and then lets her see his screen. It’s a picture of Bucky Barnes, looking like he just stepped off a team bus and into his front door, holding up a handwritten sign that reads “HI JENNY! GO WILDCATS!”
“Duty calls,” Tony says.  He looks a little dazed.  Like he’d lost himself entirely in the lesson and only now realizes how long Steve had let it go on.
The Potato Eaters by Vincent Van Gogh
“I’d like to talk,” Steve says. “I’ve got some things to say and I want you to hear them. I don’t want to just gloss over all this.”
“Bruce, you’re good at computers, right?” Steve asks.
“We’ve got this,” Steve says, his eyes calm and serious.  “I promise.”
Steve’s smile lights up his whole face.  “I know there is.  I just-- I thought you didn’t want that.  Or that it’d be too much trouble.”
“Steve,” Tony repeats.  “The Steve we’re trying to get laid?”
He can’t even fathom the depths of how much he may or may not be fucking this up. Is it good James stayed? Sure, probably. Is it a sign James has gone from one set of assholes telling him what to do, to a more well-intentioned set of assholes? Absolutely. There really isn’t a better description of Team Barton-Banner than that.
It’s surreal to follow Steve out the window, carrying a gun, wearing a borrowed hoodie and hat, to move over/under/around/through a maze of fire escapes, narrow ledges and at one point a roof. They’re definitely avoiding cameras, though. Steve seems to know the location of every single one that could be a problem and they take extra care to avoid them.
“Steve called it valid!  110 points!” Clint shouts in triumph, before realizing there are other people around and lowering his voice.  “Seriously, dude, I owe you.  We should get a drink with us after work someday.  Do you do ever do that?  Slum it with the commoners?”
“JARVIS? Do me a favor. All that data that Romanoff dumped-- see if there’s anything that mentions me. Actually-- scratch that. I know enough about myself to last me a lifetime. See what HYDRA had on dad, will you? And go straight to the Restricted Section. I only wanna read what I was never meant to see.”
“I’m coming out,” Steve explains. “It’s time. I don’t want to have to do a lot of explaining when people start spotting us together. And I figure if I do it now, we can hide out here for a day or two and maybe we’ll get lucky and some other celebrity will make news before the week’s up.”
Bruce tenses, because seriously Clint,
His head still aches, and movement seems like a lot of effort. Natasha looks ready to teach a Pilates class.
Sam is at the table, resting his head in his hands and Natasha is at the stove, stirring soup. Tony can smell something frying, too. Potatoes maybe? They smell incredible the closer he gets.
“Sorry.  The beer got to me.  I’m good,” Tony lies.
“I could do it,” Steve offers.
“They were all signed R.J. if that helps,” Steve says.  “That was the only identifying information.”
It’s been one month since Steve dropped Tony off upstate. When he pulls into the parking lot of the rehab mansion, Pepper is walking down the steps. Steve parks next to Pepper’s town car wear Happy is waiting. Pepper smiles and waves when she spots Steve.
“He did because of HYDRA,” Tony cuts him off.  “I’ve had six weeks to stew, Steve.  Six weeks to hate him, and pity him, and everything in between. I’m not saying I’m over it, but I’m definitely at a spot where he doesn’t need to be the elephant in the room anymore.  That wasn’t doing me much good anyway.  So... what’s he like?  What’s he going to be like when I meet him?  If he’s you know... him... and not all murdery.”
Steve gives a little wave.
This time they make it to the benches on the side of Tony’s rink before they collapse.
“When he’d talk about how you were friends, I never believed him,” Tony says.  “My dad was a mean drunk.  Why would Captain America be friends with someone like that?  Now look.  Me a drunk and you’re still here.  I guess it makes some sort of warped sense.”
“Goddamn it, that’s
“Uber?” Tony asks.
“I don’t want to be any trouble,” Tony says.
Steve and Clint both look a little guilty.
“I want to make a video,” Steve announces from where he sits on the floor of the garage, watching Tony’s legs dangle out from beneath one of his cars.
These are Tony’s first three thoughts upon waking. He lays there for a few minutes trying to will himself back to oblivion. When that doesn’t work he tries to move, but Steve is heavy against him, and all dead weight.
Nanna laughs.  “Do you recognize this one?”
“Don’t try to talk me out of it or you just might succeed.  Go.  I’ll see you in thirty.”
Steve watches her step behind the security desk and then swipe herself into an unmarked door.  He understands why.  There crowd in the lobby keeps growing, and dozens of flash bulbs are going off in and outside the building.  Steve can’t get to the street without pushing hard through the crowd, so he moves to the edges to wait it out.  From here, he hears clearly when the photographers start giving Tony a hard time, trying to get a rise out of him.  No doubt they’re paid more for their pictures if Tony makes a scene.
“He’s looking for Bigfoot,” Clint interrupts to explain.
“Steve Rogers,” Steve says.
He’s quiet as he walks out of the bathroom.  Steve strips, showers as quickly as he can, and steps out of the water to find Tony’s laid out pajamas for him.  Steve dresses and walks to the bedroom to find Tony in bed.  Steve slides under the sheets and scoots closer, wrapping an arm around Tony’s wait to drag him back toward him.  Tony’s entirely pliant.
“If you’re dressed like that, it will be,” Tony says.
Steve maybe falls a little bit in love right then.  Steve's maybe already been falling in love with him a little bit already.
“I don’t mind your stupid face anymore,” Tony says. “In fact, I kind of love it.”
That's a big part of why Tony rarely leaves the safety of his lab or office.  Pepper's been weeding Obie’s people out since the board ousted the man in the spring but it’s a slow process.
“What?” Steve asks.
“It’s a gesture,” Tony says, waving toward the jet.  “A grand one.  I show up, take you anywhere in the world.  Fourteen-year-old-me gives me a mental high five when I kiss you somewhere over the Atlantic.  It’s a hell of a first date.”
The place is totally deserted except for the two of them.  They walk through one full building and half of another before they reach a door that takes a special code to open.  Once they’re inside, they are surrounded by carefully shelved crates.
“Someone would probably pay you a lot of money for this interview, Steve,” Clint says seriously. “Like a million dollars. I’m not exaggerating. Back me up here, Tash.”
please let me know!
But as he googles Tony Stark Disney Ban, he knows Sam’s right. He’s in this deep.
The only person as drunk as Steve and Tony is Clint, who is now sitting on the pavement with his eyes closed, leaning his head against Sam’s legs. He’s humming to himself loudly, massacring what Tony thinks might be ‘Eye of the Tiger.’
“I hate all of you and everything,” Clint sighs.
“What about Stark?”
"We're all good, Cap," Clint supplies helpfully. They must be on speaker.  "You know, just in case you didn't get that from all the times Bruce said okay.”
Tony wipes at his eyes with his palm. “You’re not bad at this talking thing. I should have known you’d be some kind of therapy all-star.”
“I’m gonna need a minute before we go back down,” Tony says.
“Two?” Steve asks.
Steve pretends to consider it. “I guess that could work.”
Tony laughs at that one. Jenny’s mom is a gem. She and Rhodey had been little more than a one-night stand yet she’d made sure Rhodey could be as much a part of Jenny’s life as he could make work with the military. And probably more surprising, she’s always been supportive of Tony’s relationship with Jenny as well. Considers him an important part of Jenny’s life and texts Tony pictures every time Jenny wins a tournament or gets player of the game or enters a science fair.
