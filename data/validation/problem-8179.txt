“Nah, they juss came to say hi.”
“Pete had an errand to run, and Michelle looked exhausted so I sent her to have a nap after she fed her.”
“I know, babe. Sadly, lots of the folks in my type of position marry trophy spouses. Just a gorgeous, usually younger, human to look good at charity events and not for love. They think our cutesy, lovey-dovey, PDA filled pics and articles are all PR stunts. Sadly, we fit the stereotype pretty well.”
“Oh yeah? What do you have planned because maybe I have a few plans of my own.” Tony smiled as he reached for one of his favorites.
Tony dug his feet into the mattress, his legs pressing tightly at Steve’s sides, giving himself a bit of leverage to thrust into Steve’s hand. The friction making them both swear and moan equally in pleasure. Before long, Tony noticed Steve’s movements becoming sharper, faster, and he knew Steve was almost ready to tip over the edge. He wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and started telling Steve every thought he felt. How good Steve felt, how much he loved and adored him, how he was so so close to coming undone himself thanks to Steve.
They finished getting everything ready, and set the table after Peter finished a few pieces of homework he had to do. They chatted happily during the meal, everything from the news to school and an upcoming baseball game Steve and Peter were attending together.
“Do not say shit like that in front of my daughter,” Peter said before Steve could answer, using his most offended-child tone as he walked into the room.
“Ya, he's a soup-hewo-"
“I love her so fucking much, Tony,” Steve sighed out fondly, managing to bend just enough to kiss her head.
“I like it,” Tony said simply, resuming the gentler movements.
… for the first time, I really just felt different and I hated it.”
Steve looked to Tony with a questioning look, getting a shake and
“I already know what I want,” Tony chirped as the host walked away. Steve smiled at him as he briefly glanced over the menu, knowing exactly what he wanted as well. The recreation had to be accurate.
“-and we thought it might be nice to make a home cooked meal. It’d been a while.”
Tony reaches for his hand and Steve gladly takes it, using it to pull Tony closer to him, wrapping their joined hands around Tony’s waist, and kisses him again.
Steve pulled back so he could look at Peter. “We know, sweetie. And we love you too, so so much.”
Oh, what he wouldn’t do for more time.
“Try us,” Steve said calmly.
“Neither was my father,” Steve added. “And my ma died when I was still pretty young, and she wasn’t around much before that ‘cause of her job.”
When they were doing dishes a while later, Steve brought the topic back.
The one Tony was holding was designed like his Iron Man Helmet and the other one was designed like Steve’s cowl.
Tony faked offence and covered her one exposed ear. “Don’t listen to Pop-pops, Ana-banana. He says bad language words sometimes.”
Tony rolled his eyes and put his hand on Rhodey’s shoulder. “Can I ask a favor of you? This is going to be a bigger favor than that time I asked if you could get me into that club back when we were at MIT.”
“Exactly.” Tony squeezed Peter’s knee and kissed his hair. “I know it’s not the same, since we did know our parents, and we aren’t trying to dismiss your feelings. I don’t want you to think that. Just want you to remember that the people in
“Hey, when’s Tony supposed to come back from his thing?” Bucky asked as innocently as possible.
“Absolutely splendid,” Steve answered in his most sarcastic tone.
“What’s there to second guess? He always loves the dates you plan for him.”
He's not even sure how it got to this point.
Peter furrowed his brow looking at Tony. “What do you mean? You both had your parents around.”
He knew Steve was just more anxious since he’d been called away on a last minute mission a few hours after they’d had the initial conversation that saw Bucky agree to get info out of his boyfriend for him. Steve hated being away from Tony on a good day, but with everything going on this week on top of it, and a minor wrench thrown in his plan, he was being extra annoying about the whole thing.
“You know I’m 30, right? I think I’ve outgrown kiddo.”
Tony had taken his family's legacy and made it do a complete 180 after a trip to Afghanistan had gone horribly wrong and showed him the corruption that had seeped into Stark Industries, something he'd always suspected but finally had proof of. He'd gone from a playboy merchant of death to philanthropist family man, and the world had loved following along as he made amends and redeemed himself and brought the Stark name synonymous with doing good in the world.
“Is it the one with the hammer? Or the shield maybe?” Steve suggested, ignoring the eye roll from Tony.
“What about Henry?” Steve mumbled quietly.
too slowly against the corner of his lips.
“DADDY! Papa saw a puppy this morning,” Peter announced excitedly as he ran into the penthouse and to Tony who was stretched out on the couch, reading a report.
“Fuck,” Steve let out, a pitch higher than his usual voice, as he reached his breaking point.
“That's the Osborne kid, right?” Steve asked Tony, who nodded in response, his brow narrowing a fraction.
“There’s the real reason for it all,” Tony laughed while Steve's hand roamed to grab his ass, as if to prove a point.
“Maybe I wanted you to win.”
Steve just smiled widely, obviously containing a laugh. “That's your granddaughter you’re talking about.”
“Yeah, I can do that.” Bucky reached for Steve’s hand before he left the room, squeezing it gently. “And what do you think the odds of me getting that date as soon as Tony’s feeling better are?”
He’d hated that his first few thoughts were, selfishly, of losing Steve, but it was the first time it was a possibility.
“I don’t think I can top that, bud.” Steve pushed himself off the Audi, opening the door to strap Peter into his booster seat. “The coolest part of my day was the cute puppy I saw on my run this morning.”
Steve smiled at him. “I’d take those odds.”
“And second,” Tony continued, ignoring his only child clearly making fun of him. “One day, you’ll call this one kiddo when she’s way too old for it, and you’ll remember this moment and get why we still call you that.”
“It’s been almost 30 years. I can genuinely say I don’t. And he was smaller than she was at that age, too.”
“Grandma Maria was the same – not her job, but just from being away with Howard a lot. I didn’t really realize it until later but, I always considered Ana and Jarvis more my family than Howard.”
That really surprised Steve. Tony never made plans for this sort of thing, but Steve was getting excited thinking that Tony took the time to plan something for their five year anniversary.
Steve pulled him tighter, hand tight across his stomach. “We’ll go shopping tomorrow,” he promised with one last kiss to Tony’s shoulder before they both fell asleep.
Bucky made his way down to Tony’s workshop, ignoring yet another chirp from his phone. Steve had been relentless in poking and prodding to see if he’d spoken with Tony yet, and Bucky had decided to just ignore him. He’d get to him when he got back to him, end of story.
“I really don’t think he’ll be mad,” Bucky said after a few minutes. “If you want, I can try and talk to him. Use my spy skills to figure out if he had anything in mind?”
“Just forget about that, okay?”
!” Tony corrected him with a laugh.
Steve just puckered his lips for a kiss, which Tony easily gave him through a broad smile of his own. He couldn’t help placing his hand on Anabelle’s back, just above Steve’s, and watching her sleep peacefully.
Peter shook his head on a laugh and Tony managed to extricate himself from Steve’s grip, stealing another cube of mozzarella for good measure. The whole scene was incredibly domestic in a cliché sort of way. Peter wasn’t exactly wrong – they didn’t often go all out with dinners, even if they did insist on having dinner together as a family every night they could. As non-traditional as they could appear to be, their family was close-knit and did truly love spending time together, something both Steve and Tony worried about as Peter grew up. But he still enjoyed spending time with his parents, and his extensive list of honorary aunts and uncles equally. Friday night dinners usually revolved around take-out, so Peter’s question wasn’t completely off-base.
Steve could tolerate many things, but anyone questioning his love for Tony and Peter was not one of them.
a trophy. It’s an expression adults use sometimes-" Tony frowned as he obviously struggled to find words to explain to their child just what it meant.
“We are making some old family favourites,” Tony smiled at Peter from his position locked in Steve’s arms. He detailed what was in each dish behind them – a traditional tomato sauce simmering on the stove, some stuffed chicken wrapped in prosciutto in a baking dish beside it, just waiting to go in the oven, and apple pie Steve had made earlier in the day cooling on the counter further down.
Steve had said, and everything else had melted, just like in those movies Tony kept forcing him and Steve to watch.
“And here I thought you couldn’t get any mushier on main,” Peter declared as he came back to the living room. “And yes, I brought back an expression from the olden days since you’re not up with the cool kids’ lingo anymore.”
“No,” Steve replied softly. “I meant would you rather have a son or daughter over the other. It’s a stupid thought, really.”
“Where’s Tony?” he called out when Clint spotted him.
“You spoil me,” Tony whispered to him when Steve set the plate before him, earning himself a kiss.
“We met sup- soup- superhewoes,” he announced proudly once the word left his mouth. When Steve repeated the sentence to make sure he understood properly, Peter nodded quickly. “
“Tony talked about it too then?”
“I panicked, okay?” Tony replied. “I wasn’t expecting him up for a while still.”
ones too.”
Steve followed his best friend to the other side of the training area where their towels and water bottles were stashed. He tried to find a way to explain just what was going on in his mind that wouldn’t send Bucky on an eye roll streak like he so often did where Steve’s love life was concerned. They both sat side by side with their backs to the wall, Steve using extra long pulls of his water bottle to delay having to talk.
“Wait a minute,” Tony said after he’d read the note. “Bucky was here?”
“I’m planning something extraordinary… an important anniversary is coming up!”
“No, we cannot,” Rhodey agreed.
When a waiter showed up to take their order, they quickly shut their menus and listed what they wanted. For Steve, he ordered Banfi Col Di Sasso wine for the two of them and then asked for pasta con pomodoro e basilico. Tony then ordered panzella for himself. The waiter wrote everything down then went to get bread, a water pitcher and the wine they asked for.
“You wanted to take me here? So your plans were…”
Steve turned his way, fingers ghosting against Tony’s hip under the covers. “Know where there were awesome pillows?”
“I do. The more time I’ve been spending with you two since the murdery programing was undone, the more I’ve fallen for you both. I thought it was just a dumb crush, but it’s not.”
Steve shrugged as he stripped his sweatpants and joined Tony in bed. “I promised her lots of extra snuggles when she is fully awake tomorrow.”
“This is where we went on our first date… we went here and sat in the booth in the corner by the window looking out at the city lights, remember? Then we went to the park and joined some people watching a projected movie.” Steve had a shy smile on his face as he looked at Tony, who was blushing furiously.
“Just a long day,” Tony answered.
“Oh Lord, it’s dumb,” Tony started with a chuckle. “Norman's an ass, first of all. And he thinks all you are is a trophy husband. That you just sit around here and paint and manage a ton of staff to do all the things while you eat chocolate dipped strawberries and drink champagne all day.”
The two of them stared at each other for a moment, taking in what had just transpired. They had planned the exact same date without knowing what the other was up to, how could the odds be in their favor like that? It didn’t matter to them as long as they were together.
“Are we expecting company or something?” Peter asked.
“Want me to ask J to hike up the temperature?” he asked without thinking, his head on Steve’s shoulder.
They were both ready for what may happen during battles when they were both still superheroes. It was part of the job. For both of them. They almost expected it every time and were relieved when they were wrong. But losing Steve to quote-unquote human causes wasn’t part of the deal. It was never something Tony had considered, and he wasn’t sure he could let it happen. The medical advances of this century had to be able to take care of this. He had the money. He had the knowledge and the team. Surely, the love of his life couldn’t be taken away from him by something as pedestrian as cancer.
Tony smiled knowingly at him. “You just wanted snuggles.”
“I‘m right here, my mind just wandered for a second.”
Tony’s hand returned to Ana’s ear. “Don’t listen to your dad either. He was clearly raised by hooligans with the mouth on him.”
A few more minutes passed before Steve finally closed the book and looked at Tony. He stayed curled under his blanket and didn’t move, but he extended his arm out to Tony, wiggling his fingers and Tony smiled. He really could never say no to him.
“He had a neat bow, and cool glasses. Can I go play?” Peter asked, squirming out of Steve's grasp.
“Really? That's your favourite Avenger,” Steve couldn’t help but ask.
Steve reached over for the bottle of lube on Tony’s nightstand, pulling away just long enough to coat his palm with enough lube for the task at hand. He stroked himself a few times, pulling an appreciative groan from Tony at the sight before him, before dipping down to lick and suck at Tony’s half-hard cock, helping it along the rest of the way with his mouth before he took him in hand with his slick hand. Steve kissed and nipped his way up Tony’s stomach and chest, making a pit stop at his nipples for a few breaths. When his lips landed against Tony’s again, he lined up his own hard cock next to Tony’s and stroked them in tandem, his large hand wrapped around them both.
By the way Steve was getting ready in semi formal clothing, Tony followed his lead with his clothing choice. As they both prepared, Steve told Tony, “I’ve called Happy and said that he wouldn’t be needed tonight. I’ll drive us, ok?”
“You two are weird,” Bucky laughed.
“You say that like we didn’t spend the whole day buried in each other in some way shape or form,” Tony chuckled.
“No, he shoots awwows,” Peter answered, pretending to strike a pose as an archer.
“I just really didn’t want KD for the third time this week,” Steve answered back just as quietly.
Rhodey smiled fondly at his best friend as he put a hand on his shoulder. “Sure, I can do this for you Tones. However, I can’t do it at this moment or maybe not even at all today. I have a lot of paperwork I have to do. Which reminds me, I have to get going.”
“What if I’m not strong enough to let you go?”
“You were incredibly hot today, by the way,” Steve’s voice came, low and rumbly, right near his ear.
“Family isn’t just biology is what you’re trying to say,” Peter added looking at each of them.
Tony laughs and gives him
“Can you call Happy for us, JARVIS?” Steve asked.
Tony doesn’t wait for an answer, turning just enough to capture Steve’s lips this time. His hands are on Steve’s hips and he takes his time. It is both glorious and absolute torture and Steve cant help but wonder, if this is what kissing Tony feels like, how would he survive anything else. Because right now, he only knows that he never wants this to stop even if he feels like he could spontaneously combust at any moment. He doesn’t give a damn. He never wants to not be able to do this.
“Are we still upset over where a 4-year-old’s allegiances lie?” Tony asked, carding his fingers through Steve's hair.
“Nice, thanks Cap.” Clint shook his head. “Besides, Thor’s incoming with Loki. He can check on Tony and hopefully help us figure out what’s going on. ETA 5 minutes.”
Bucky narrowed his gaze on Steve. “I’m sorry, what?”
“And Uncle Bucky’s family was there for me that way too.”
“What are you up to?” Tony asked as he walked into the living room where his husband was sprawled on the couch.
Tony grabbed a throw blanket from the chair next to them and manoeuvred himself onto the couch next to Steve. He dropped the cozy blanket over the three of them and slotted himself against Steve’s side, his strong arm wrapped around Tony’s back to make sure he didn’t fall. He gave a soft kiss to Anabelle’s hand, still clutching on to Steve’s shirt, earning himself a little hitching sigh from his granddaughter, who turned her head once again towards him.
“Happy anniversary, my darling. Thank you for the wonderful movie.”
“Steve,” he keened, just as Steve pulled off and finished him off with his hand.
“Sweetheart, you need to let it go,” Steve answered back quietly.
While Tony waited for Steve to come back, he decided to get a little more sleep since he did stay up in the lab for some time after midnight.
“Yeah, it kinda came up. No big deal, we were just trying to find time to go see that new action movie with the robot cars. He said he couldn’t on the 16th ‘cause it was his and Tony’s anniversary? I was sure that was in July.”
~~~~~
Rhodey looked at him from the side. “I have Tony’s credit card. Wanna go grab a late lunch?”
“You could never disappoint me, Steve.”
“Oh, come
Steve and Tony went into the restaurant and asked for the reservation under Steve’s name and cancelled the one Tony had made in the process since they didn’t need it. The host led them to their table and sat them down, placing menus in front of them.
Life really had been good to them.
“Why’s that?”
“I know.” Bucky drained the last of his bottle and looked at the clock. “I have so much free time now. No idea what I’ll do with myself.”
Steve shook his head. “The machine’s acting up, we think it’s the spell Tony’s under that’s doing it.”
“Sweetheart, he doesn’t know.” Tony started scratching Steve's back, pulling a pleased moan from him.
Bucky waited a few beats before talking, likely expecting more from Steve than just that, and therefore trying to understand what he could possibly mean by it.
Tony just turned the package towards Steve pointing to a bright bubble affirming it was safe to eat raw, while the spoon stayed caught between his lips.
“It’s for the same reason you keep me around to snuggle with: I’m a furnace. They like heat.”
Tony quietly gasped, “are we using your motorcycle?” Steve chuckled a little as he picked up a set of keys off the table by his side of the bed.
Steve shrugged. “Makes it fun. We usually end up donating it somewhere or paying someone’s bill at a restaurant to make up for it.”
“We're in here kiddo,” Tony replied from the kitchen between fits of laughter.
“Oh, Steve’s no better. But I have to say, I’m happy Tony did remember. I was worried he’d freak out on me when I brought it up. It’s why I didn’t come and ask yesterday.”
“Told you,” Tony answered on a yawn. And, I asked, you know. At the rental? Their pillows are from Price Club or something. Ten bucks! How they’re that cozy compared to this, no fucking clue.”
“More like my still very hot husband. And the fact that our gene pool is a tiny part of her makes her even cuter.”
“True, but we’ve talked about how your grandpa Howard wasn’t exactly the funnest human to be around,” Tony reminded him.
, Tony thought fondly to himself.
“Come on, Cap,” Tony told him after he’d grabbed the spoon from his mouth and handed him the other one, the package of cookie dough now on the counter between them. “Live a little. This one now, those for later. Win-win.”
“We got a call from Ms. Watson yesterday, sweetie,” Steve told him gently.
“Puppies are gweat too!” Peter proceeded to ask questions about the dog  Steve met for all of two minutes during the entirety of their 13-minute drive home.
“That was some efficient cuddling, sir,” Tony joked as Steve joined him in bed.
“One thing that Pops and I did have growing up that is similar to you though is, our families weren’t exactly always traditional looking,” Tony offered when they were all settled.
“I was shocked he was planning anything,” Rhodey started. “He usually calls me at the last minute panicking that he’s forgotten whatever they’re celebrating, and I just need to calm him down so he can focus a bit and then find the right gift. I thought that’s what was happening when I found him looking frantic, but he was nervous about planning the perfect date.”
“Harsh, Cap.”
“Can we move this too the couch? My butt is too old for this chair sharing situation,” Tony asked as he extricated himself from the chair and his embrace with his son.
He went back to the living room, where Tony was waiting for him with a movie that didn’t look familiar queued up. Steve crashed onto the couch and let himself fall sideways onto Tony's lap.
“Not just any 4-year-old.
“I recreated our first date too… I was going to take you here around 8 and then after dinner I was going to get Happy and Rhodey to set up a spot in the park for us since there aren’t really many people who show movies in the park anymore. I had no idea that you had planned this too.”
As he often did, Peter made it simple for them. “Oh. I just wan’ed to see it.”
“You were,” Steve continued, lips as velvety smooth as his words against Tony’s neck. “I love watching you be a dad. Cheering her on at her class. But not like those intense dance moms from that TV show Clint was obsessed with a few years back. And those pants just accentuate your ass, and it was hard to keep my hands off.”
“You can come in you know,” Steve told Tony, not looking up from the book in his hand.
“I hate this pillow. It just doesn’t keep its shape. I paid a small fortune for it, you’d think it wouldn’t copy a pancake the first chance it got!”
Bucky smiled at him, holding out his fist so Steve could bump it with his own. “You got it, pal.”
“Be nice, I don’t want him taking Ana-beans away out of spite,” Steve chuckled, the motion sending the newborn into the most adorable fit of smooshing her face against Steve’s shirt and making unhappy little noises. Steve proceeded to make soothing sounds and Tony rubbed her back to get her to stay asleep.
He wouldn’t trade it for the world.
“Did you get the chocolate off my face at least?” he asks as the elevator doors close behind them, making Steve laugh, and double down on kissing that corner of his mouth again. Just to make sure.
He felt Tony’s breath hitch when his fingers made contact with his skin. The warm puff of air as he slowly exhaled. He barely realized his thumb abandoned its quest to get rid of the chocolate it was supposed to be taking care of, and was instead starting to trail, oh so slowly, down the curve of his bottom lip. Was he even making his hand do that?
Tony laughed quietly. He turned and punched his pillow back into a semblance of its original shape, making Steve jump besides him, asking for an explanation at the sudden show of rage that rivaled his own punching bag sessions when he’d arrived in this new century.
“You’re at least half this weird,” Tony reminded him.
“We’ll need to narrow it down, yeah,” Tony agreed, grazing his fingers up and down Steve’s arm.
Steve had tried to protest. Tried to make Tony see reason. It wouldn’t take that long to whip up a batch of freshly made cookies. Tony had just ignored him, smiling at him the whole while as he pulled out two spoons from a drawer, closing it shut with his hip (which was way sexier than it had any right to be).  He popped open the plastic wrapping while Steve was pointing out all the dry ingredients on the counter, and dug the spoon into the dough and ate it straight.
Steve quirks an eyebrow at him. “Who says I was talking about the pie?”
After dinner, Steve paid the bill, Tony left the tip, and they were out the door back to Steve’s bike. It was time to end the night in the park.
“You were always an amazing dad. And husband.” Steve used his free hand to pull Tony in for another kiss. “I love the family we built together.”
Bucky frowned at him. “Why are you worried though? That sounds like a fun night, and he even said it was the best. I’m sure he’ll love it.”
The phone call had come while Bucky was in the shower. FRIDAY had had to alert him that Steve was trying to reach him several times.
“You are so right,” Tony agreed, eagerly flipping Steve onto his back, smirking at the absolute lust in Steve’s eyes as he looked up and down Tony’s body, all traces of tiredness completely gone. “It would be irresponsible to let it go to waste.”
“My origin story?” Peter laughed. “I’m not a superhero, Dad. That’s yours and Pops’ jobs.”
“Because you love me and would be lost without our friendship.” Bucky gave him a cheesy smile and made a heart with his hands, and Steve was the one to roll his eyes as he bit down a smile.
“Dad?” Peter called out as he walked in the penthouse.
He definitely wants to do this every day now.
“Peter, we’re not mad. We just wanna understand.”
Steve tried to let it go, but it had been hard when every other sentence out of his son's mouth that evening was about Hawkeye or the Avengers. Thankfully, when he tucked him into bed, Peter hugged him tightly and told him he would always be his favourite Papa. There was at least that.
Steve replied with the same thing, words slurred and breathless, against Tony’s shoulder. He let himself flop next to Tony, and his hand tightened gently around Tony’s cock, stroking him just like he knew Tony liked. He hadn’t been lying when he’d said he was close too, and Steve knew just how to get him there. Their bodies were still tangled together, now sideways due to Steve shifting position, and Tony had lost his leverage and the added friction of Steve’s length next to him. Before he could voice outloud what he needed, Steve had moved him. He was on his back once more, Steve’s mouth had replaced his hand around the head of his cock and he had one slick finger pressing against his hole. The combination was all he needed.
Steve only hummed in agreement before pulling Tony in closer to watch the movie.
“What is it?” Tony asked curiously when he’d stopped laughing, Steve noticing he was staring at him and hadn’t said anything in just too long to be suspicious.
“What're you making? It smells amazing,” Peter asked after picking up the backpack he’d dropped in the middle of the room and setting it in its place.
“I was coming to the same conclusion, to tell you the truth. When you said Tony’d mentioned what day it was, it didn’t track with what Steve had told me.”
“Papa, the
“Sure, bud,” Steve said, trying not to let his dejected tone be noticed too much.
“Tony usually gives a random name for all his reservations, and he makes his assistant call, that way they don’t suspect it’s him. He’s had bad experiences with photogs showing up when staff sold info to tabloids before. So he jumps through lots of hoops now. Even at places he goes to often and especially if Steve’s with him. He doesn’t want him going through any of that.”
He drifted off thinking of many more afternoons spent just like this, watching his grandchild grow with their family by his side, snow forts and swims in the lake only a few years away when Anabelle was big enough for them.
He bounced impatiently once he was in the elevator. He needed to see Tony, and Steve, and make sure they were okay. That they were going to be fine. He ignored the part of his brain that was telling him that might be a bit much considering he was just ‘Steve’s best friend’. He’d been doing a fantastic job of ignoring his actual feelings for the past few months, he could pull it off one more time.
Before he knows it, his previously free hand is now pulling Tony closer by his waist, and the hand on his face has moved to curve around his head, pulling Tony into a kiss that’s both so soft and gentle, and yet filled with an urgency Steve didn’t know he was capable of. Tony let’s out a soft moan that Steve swallows eagerly, coaxing his lips open with a gentle nip of his lower lip. As their tongues meet and they start to explore as much of the other’s mouth as they can, Tony melts in Steve’s arms. His hands are on Steve’s cheeks in a matter of seconds, then they feel like they’re everywhere as they kiss and kiss for what feels like a whole lifetime: the back of his head, in his hair, scatching down his neck, his shoulders, on his hip.
“Go nap, you need it too,” Steve called after him. He turned to Tony with a smile. “We’re still cool, right? We’re superheroes.”
“Not just your ass, promise.”
“And my ma couldn’t bake for shit,” Steve smirked, “so that’s actually Bucky’s mom’s pie recipe. I got lucky that he remembered it.”
“What’s so special about June 16th?” Rhodey questioned him as he glanced over at the StarkPad.
When Steve saw the restaurant, he noticed that the parking space he and Tony used long ago had been open, so he took the opportunity and pulled right up. When they came to a stop, Tony noticed where they were.
“Those jerks,” Tony added with a laugh as it all fell into place. “We’re going to have to get them back for this sometime.”
“What? That's ridiculous,” Steve hissed out, trying not to rouse Peter from where he was drawing at the table.
He sat in front of the window, rain visible beyond the glass, on the large round chair. A weird modern circular thing that looked so out of place amongst all the vintage books and furniture that surrounded it. But Steve had fallen in love with how cozy it looked and how his bulky frame could fit easily curl up in it, and Tony could never say no to him.
Clint kicks the back of the couch again, and Natasha runs her hands through her hair, pulling on it.
After a brief moment Tony nods shortly and Steve releases his arm. He turns and walks up the stairs to his room and enters, Steve following right behind him. Tony shuts the door once they're both inside and pours himself a few fingers of much needed scotch. He offers a glass to Steve, but the super soldier turns it down, as expected. Downing the stabilizing agent in a few quick swallows, Tony then stands for a few more moments in silence, trying to figure out how best to tell the man what he needs to say.
“Steve, we were just telling Tony that we’re your family. We saved you and brought you home. Do you understand?” Natasha asks quietly of the blond haired boy.
Natasha runs through the hellicarrier, taking every shortcut she knows to get to the jet.
"It really was," Tony agrees, eyes drooping with exhaustion. He has to stifle a yawn, "We have
"The friendly kind or the sexy kind?" Clint inquires without missing a beat.
"JARVIS, do we have enough space in the locker rooms to store all our weapons?" Natasha asks the AI softly, earning a strange look from both Clint and Thor.
After dinner, they sit and watch a movie, ('The Incredibles' this time,) and Tony sits on the couch next to Natasha while Steve is pulled into Thor's lap. Natasha gives them both a bath after the movie, and they quickly settle into bed.
“Teammates?” asks Tony, eyeing the door suspiciously.
He slips the single finger in and out until he feels the muscle relax around him, and Tony's visibly tight body does the same. Then he adds a second finger, going just as slow, and adding more lube as he goes. Tony tightens back up for a moment as his body acclimates to the intrusion, but it doesn't take him nearly as long to relax this time. Steve repeats the process with the third and then the fourth finger, continuing until Tony is a whimpering mess beneath him, begging for Steve to just fuck him already.
"My four year old teammates just tried to blow me in thanks for making them a grilled cheese sandwich and letting them do the dishes. I'm fucking fantastic, thanks," he snaps at her, kicking the back of the couch he's been pacing behind.
"What I want from you has no price. Besides, I always wondered what it would be like to be a sugar daddy."
Steve wakes very suddenly when a heavy weight pushes down on his chest. He opens his eyes and sees Tony, back to his normal size, sleeping on top of him. Tony stirs slightly, blinking up at Steve in confusion.
“I don’t think they’re coming in hot, but tell the men not to resist them. I’d like my hellicarrier to stay in the sky,” he answers ruefully, knowing first hand just how easy it would be for the superhero team to destroy his airship. “We’ll keep Stark in interrogation for now.”
“There’s no need for that, Captain. My agents are the best. They’ll talk him around. Then we can set up a room for him while we try and figure out what happened. I need you to contact Banner and have him come up. We’ll need his help to…”
"Hill, pull our people out of that ship immediately. Set up a biohazard zone around it. No one in or out," Fury orders without any further questioning. He trusts Natasha and the tone in her voice worries him. "What happened to them, Romanoff?"
Just then, the door to the interrogation room opens, and the agent Fury left with Stark comes out, holding the screaming four year old.
"Just, give me a second," Tony says, pulling away from Steve and pacing around the room, "I wasn't actually prepared for this response."
"They're four," he says with no preamble.
With a brief word of farewell to everyone, Bruce leaves and heads for the jet. Once he's gone, Thor takes a seat on the floor, setting Mjolnir to the side and looking at his remaining two teammates.
Tony smiles softly and continues out the door, not even glancing back to thank his friend.
Fury is out of the command center before the agent can even finish talking, heading for the lower levels of the hellicarrier as fast as he can.
The little body in his arms relaxes a little, and Steve can’t help but pick him up and carry him to his room. He sets Tony on the bed along with his shield, and starts taking off his uniform. Tony watches him, eyes wide. Steve has never had anyone watch him while he undressed, let alone a four year old boy. A four year old boy whose adult self Steve has been secretly crushing on for months, but never found the courage to say anything to. It’s disconcerting to say the least, and Steve can feel himself blushing. But Steve isn’t really sure how to explain his dilemma to the kid, so he just slips into his walk in closet and dresses as quickly as he can. When he comes back out, Tony is trying to pick up his shield and slip it on his arm. He notices Steve before the Captain can say anything, and drops the shield back to the bed as though it’s burned him.
“Why not? I’ve seen you hit smaller targets from much farther away. And some of those shots nearly missed one of the team,” Steve inquires, eyebrows raised at Clint’s statement.
"What about Star Spangled Smash? Frisbinator? Twinkle Twinkle Little Doom?" Tony offers, ticking his suggestions off on his fingers.
"Hey boys. I'm going to make some grilled cheese and tomato soup. Would you like some?"
“Of the two of us, who is the most likely to talk about something they’re thinking or feeling?” Steve says with a slight smirk, moving his hands to pet Tony’s hair.
The boxes are a godsend. Tony pulls out all his favorites once he and Thor come back inside, and very quickly turns the Avenger’s living room into a giant play room. Steve, Thor and Clint all get roped into playing with him, while Natasha politely declines and sits on the couch to read. They spend the majority of the afternoon building a perfect lego replica of the mansion, complete with quinjet and parking garage, only stopping when Tony’s stomach begins to rumble loudly.
Turning on his heel, Tony storms out of the mansion, leaving a very lost Captain standing confused in the middle of the living room.
Tony reaches out a tentative hand to touch it, looking to Steve for permission. When Steve nods, he lays his little hand on the metal. He pets it lovingly, tracing his fingers around the star in the center.
“Clint! You awake?”
Tony barely shakes his head, looking around the room in fear. The look breaks everyone’s heart, and they all want nothing more than to hold him close and tell him everything will be alright. But they had seen the flinch when Tasha had tried to touch him, and there is still the strange question roaming around in the backs of their minds, so they smile as kindly as they can at the scared little boy.
getting to eat pie. He throws both his fists in the air.
“In all honesty, you,” Tony replies, his answer startling Steve slightly, “I rarely talk about what I
"The point of this hammer is to gently combine two pieces of wood so they don't fall apart, not smash the bed into tiny pieces Thor. Besides, you're stronger so it makes more sense for you to hold the frame up instead of me," Clint counters, grunting slightly as he hammers in another nail.
It had come as no great shock when several weeks previously the Captain had announced over dinner one evening that he and Tony were dating. There had been some good natured teasing, a few off-color jokes from Clint, but then the team had simply accepted it and moved on. So it makes sense that Tony would want to check on Steve, and it gives the team hope that some of their adult memories might still remain, if dormant. That hope is short lived.
“I will in a bit. I need to get some work done first. But I promise I’ll be right here when you wake up in the morning, alright?”
She sighs and helps him stand.
"Did you have an asthma attack?" Clint asks, receiving a small nod in answer, "Did you take your inhaler?" Another nod. "That's very good, Steve." He pulls the boy in for a hug and pets his hair softly.
"How did this happen?" Director Fury demands of the collected Avengers who are sitting around a conference table on the SHIELD hellicarrier.
“Cliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiint!” he shouts, diving onto the sleeping archer, and startling the man awake.
The Red Room trained Natasha to be emotionless, to deal with every situation with the same impartial cool resolve. But the more she finds out about what Tony and Steve were 'trained' to do and be, the more her own training fails her. Tamping down firmly on her tears, she picks up the toys and sets them in front of the two boys.
“Why don’t we get you to the jet, and then we’ll answer all your questions, alright?” Tasha interjects, glancing towards the door.
"Yes! It was, I mean I do. But weren't you raised to think it was wrong? Two men together, I mean."
"No problem. Have fun!"
"For going to talk to Clint, even though it was probably the hardest thing you've ever done, but you did it because you care about me, about us, and I wanted to show you my appreciation," Tony explains, planting one last chaste kiss on the Captain's lips before continuing, "I actually went to talk to him too. But he told me to talk to you, that we needed to work on our communication, and that he isn't our sex therapist."
"Training with Clint," Steve informs him, "We're working on new dodge techniques to keep him from getting hurt if he ends up being in close combat with someone stronger than him."
“I heard you. Every word. And you know…” Tony sits up and flips on the light next to the bed, looking down at Steve, his face unreadable, “I’m not really sure what to say. I
"Not only did my brother have a fit, but I stole something that belonged to you and then used it to punish my brother without permission. We are still adjusting to the rules of your household, though that is no excuse for such a transgression. We ask you to punish us that we may learn to serve you better in the future."
Thankfully, no one on the SHIELD hellicarrier is brave enough, (or suicidal enough,) to take on the team of angry Avengers. Most of them simply back up against the nearest wall and raise their hands to show they aren’t a threat. The team of three makes their way through the ship until they reach the interrogation rooms. Fury meets them outside one of the doors.
Steve takes a seat on one of the barstools and fixes Tony with an unreadable look.
“Is something wrong, Tony?” he asks, wondering if he’s upset the boy.
Clint hangs up the phone and slips it back into his pocket. Then he slides to the floor and pulls his knees close, burying his head between them and sobbing quietly.
“Wait, were you in there? In your four year old head?” Steve asks, trying to look in Tony’s eyes, but Tony is looking down at their feet.
Tony rubs his hands together in a very ‘mad scientist’ gesture, and waits by Clint’s bedroom door, while Steve opens it and calls in.
"Hey," Tony says when he finds Steve in his room later that day, after gathering his courage for a few more hours.
“No.” Steve says when Tony approaches him, his eyes never leaving the newspaper he’s reading.
Tony shrinks a little further into himself at the question, and searches her face, as though looking for the trick. It’s a very disconcerting look from such a young face.
“Let me go!” a small child that looks disturbingly like Tony Stark screams at Fury when he enters the interrogation room he’d been directed to after he’d checked on the damage in research.
Fury, by nature of his job, is use to explosions. They come with the territory when you’re the Director of SHIELD. He is not, however, use to having them randomly rock his hellicarrier and nearly knock it out of the sky.
“You cornered him?!” Steve practically yells into the phone, “He’s a four year old child, who thinks he’s been kidnapped, and you cornered him?!”
“Can I… can I sleep with you? I’ll be really quiet, and I won’t touch anything in your room, and I can hide in the closet if those guys try to take me again, and…”
They all smile at him and Steve nods, but in the back of their minds, it hurts to know that at such a young age, going without seeing or speaking to his parents for an extended period of time was such a common experience that it didn’t even register as unusual to Tony. Steve hugs the boy as best he can while still in his seat, and keeps an arm around him until they land safely at the mansion.
"No. Well, yes. I mean, not really but it's relevant," Tony stumbles through his own response, resolutely
She smiles when she enters and sees her two friends at work. Thor is holding up the entire frame work while Clint goes around and nails the pieces together.
"Master Clint made us some food and allowed us to assist in its preparation and clean up. We were grateful for the chance to be useful, as we have not done anything of use since you brought us here, and we wished to convey our appreciation by servicing him. Our trainers taught us many different methods of sexually pleasuring our Masters using our holes, though we aren't very experienced yet. When we tried to service Master Clint, he pushed us away. He ordered us not to speak and we have been awaiting our punishment. We did not mean to displease him."
"Tony. He's not as straight laced as you think. Give him a chance. What's the worst that could happen?"
"Facial recognition match, 83%," JARVIS's voice interrupts their stipulating, "A gas station near the mansion. The cashier called the local police to report two young boys, unattended, purchasing food and drinks."
"We'll keep an eye on them. Let me know if you need another blood draw and I'll send one up."
"I like you," he says at last, and feels a huge weight lift from his shoulders at the admittance, as well as an even larger weight pressing down on his chest at the anxiety from not knowing how Steve is going to respond to the confession.
doing it… hurts more than he expected.
Steve lays out all of the pie ingredients on the counter, and very carefully instructs Tony on how to use the apple corer to cut and core the apples. He lets Tony help him mix the spices together, and has to keep himself from laughing when Tony has a sneezing fit because he dumped the cinnamon in too quickly. They use a cookie cutter in the shape of the Captain’s shield (a gag gift from Tony himself a few weeks after New York) to make the design in one of the pies, and a heart for the other. While the pies cook, Steve puts on Finding Nemo, and they cuddle up on the couch to watch the movie.
"Get everyone out of that ship right now. There's some kind of time warp in there. Minutes out here are days in there. Tony and Steve think they were gone for forty seven days, not minutes. And the aliens on that ship did... horrible things to them," Natasha says before Fury can even finish asking his question.
to say," explains Steve, looking at the ground and picking an invisible speck of lint from his shirt, "We hadn't known each other for very long, and I wasn't sure how you'd react. So I thought it might be easier to tell you if we were friends first. I've been trying to find the courage to talk to you for weeks. But, you beat me to it. And I figured a kiss would be a better answer than words. I'm sorry if it upset you."
“Of course it did,” Fury says to no one in particular, “I don’t know why I should be surprised. Stark’s on board. Something was bound to blow up sooner or later. Send a team down to make sure there’s no injuries and that nothing
“The what now?” asks Clint, still breathing heavily and blinking rapidly as his brain tries to decide whether someone is in danger or not.
Tony’s eyes go as big as saucers and Steve suddenly finds his lap full of little boy and tiny hands grip his shoulders tightly.
“I do have the shield. But I left it right outside the door with one of my teammates. Would you like to see it?”
Noticing that it's the archer's hand that is bleeding, Fury stops for a moment and gives him a stern look.
"So you've told me. Don't you have some project to worry about, other than naming my shield?"
“Glad to hear it. I’m going to go sit with him, make sure there aren’t any immediate side effects. Go ahead and do what you need to whenever Strange gets back and you’re ready,” says Steve, turning and heading back to his room before anyone can say anything.
She looks up at the ceiling of the jet and yells as loudly as she can.
“You’re not mad?” he asks cautiously.
“I’m coming to get him.
telling me you’re going to keep him on the carrier? He’s a
"Fair enough," Steve says, standing to leave, "Sorry to bother you, but thank you for the advice."
Tony opens the indicated door and looks inside. Steve notices immediately that the boy’s excitement is gone, and kneels by his side, putting a hand on his shoulder worriedly.
"Huh?" Tony spins around in his chair and looks at the doctor, who gives him a smile and an exasperated sigh.
In the end Natasha and Thor end up heading back to the hellicarrier to tell Bruce in person. He doesn't lose his control, but instead collapses in tears of his own at the thought of his best friend being tortured in such a manner. They stay with him for a few hours until he's calm enough to be left on his own.
He sighs and runs a hand through his already messy hair.
"Yes. No progress on that front. But we knew this was going to take time."
Fury calls Natasha as soon as they arrive back at the mansion and chews her ear off for not only leaving without authorization from air control, but for almost unleashing the Hulk on his ship again, but she knows it's just for show. She can hear in his voice that Bruce has told him what they'd found out, and that he's just as upset as they are.
"Young Tony temporarily disabled my security features from the panel in his room. When I came back online they were gone."
“Is he hurt?” Bruce asks, slowly approaching Steve and his little bundle.
Thor comes out of his room at the same time she does, carrying a confused Tony in his arms.
Normally, when the Avengers are on their way home from a mission, the jet is an extremely quiet place. The types of battles they get called on to fight always leave them drained and exhausted by the time they’re over. This time… is quite a bit different.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony rips his arm from Steve’s grasp, startling the Captain. His voice is nearly a whisper when he speaks.
Putting Tony to bed is surprisingly much easier than giving him a bath. Tony quickly changes into his Captain America pajamas and crawls into bed, letting Steve tuck the covers up around him.
of lube, prep up to four fingers, and then push past the initial pain. Tony strikes me as the kind of guy that would enjoy some pain during sex, and even though he'll probably
We have miles of darkness to go before our little family is whole again, (and some of them a bit less little,) but I'm in for the long haul. It just might take me a little longer to get there. Thank you for your patience and understanding. You guys have been awesome. <3
“So we get to have our whole first date, just like we both wanted,” Steve marvelled at the development.
“Well this sure is awkward isn’t it?” Tony rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly as he held his helmet in his other hand.
“Tony’d had to leave for a conference the next day, so we didn’t see each other and we didn’t really mention it to anyone. It was nice to have something that was just ours for a bit. He came back, and I asked him to be my date to my birthday party, much less awkwardly this time, and you guys assumed it was our first date, and we just never corrected anyone.”
“You get what Dad’s saying though?” Steve asked, squeezing Peter’s shoulder in a side hug.
,” Tony tried again just as calmly, and Steve gave his hand another tight squeeze, knowing how hard it could be for him to keep his cool in such situations.
Tony smirked up at him, the picture of innocence. “No idea what you’re talking about. We're just two boring idiots in love.”
“Ha! You are many things, Stevie, but throwing a match isn’t in your vocabulary. Come on, spill. What’s going on?”
come between that little boy and his Papa, because he loves you more than I think he loves me or Cocoa Puffs. Assuming this never gets out, even if we wait until he's twenty to tell him about us? I have no doubt you’ll be his favourite. By a few thousand miles.”
“Babe, come here,” Tony tried to pull Steve to him but there was no use, he'd planted himself like a tree and nothing would move him. So, Tony moved himself back into Steve's lap, like he'd done earlier that day. “First of all, if there's one thing I’ve learned in the three years Pete's been with us it is to
“It’s mine and Steve’s anniversary! Where have you been all this time Platypus?!”
Steve smiled gently at him, putting a hand on Tony’s cheek, “I can’t wait, sweetheart.”
The things he wouldn’t do for his best friend sometimes-
“This is a special occasion after all. Sound good to you?” Steve smiled at Tony as he held out his hand for him to take. Tony smiled up at him as he intertwined their fingers and Steve led them out of the tower.
Steve wiped his hands and Tony grabbed the paper Peter was waving at them. Steve picked up his son, looking at the paper Tony was holding.
“Tony mentioned a couple weeks ago that he thought you might. Like us, I mean. I was convinced he was seeing things, so we made a bet. We were trying to figure out a not too weird way of bringing it up – again, because I was convinced he was wrong, and I didn’t want you to feel weird about it.”
It was Tony’s turn to hum gently. Steve's lips were still on his skin, his nose tracing their way up his neck, beard soft and ticklish around each press of his lips. As tired as he’d felt minutes before, this was reviving all his senses.
thing happen today,” Peter yelled as he ran into Steve's arms.
smile. And maybe it was just for him all along after all. Maybe wishes do come true sometimes.
Steve and Tony just stared at each other.
Steve.
“It's late. I told her sleep was more important than cuddles right now.”
“I’m not-
Steve already had his bike in front of the tower when they stepped out of the door, since he had moved it there that morning before he went on his run. Two helmets were sitting on the bike that he’d had Bucky put there only moments ago.
Funny to see the hundred-year-old man out of time in the modern chair that was so out of place in a vintage room in the middle of a new century. There was some irony to be found there for sure.
“Yeah, Petey Pie,” Steve answered as he set the plate of KD and wieners in front of his picky four-year-old, before grabbing his and his husband's plates of pasta carbonara and scallops.
“I know,” Tony answered, not moving from his spot.
Bucky let out a loud laugh that had him tumbling back against the sofa, mumbling something about dumb idiots between bouts of laughter. Rhodey seemed thoroughly perplexed.
And here they are.
“I mean, you say stupid shit every day, so that won’t be anything new.” Steve turned to see Bucky’s smirk directed his way.
“Yeah, growing up when I did, it wasn’t the same as now in the least but, being the small sick kid wasn’t always easy. And then being a walking science experiment wasn’t much easier in its own way.”
“I know he does, but you’re just a notch above. I don’t blame him one bit.” Tony smiled at him, that great smile that made his eyes crinkle with laugh lines and shine so bright. “And second, you are Captain fucking America. You don’t just throw a frisbee around and if I hear you talk badly about my husband that way again-"
“No, but we all know I’m the best,” Natasha announced as she walked towards them. “I thought we were training this morning?”
“I don’t know!” Bucky threw his arms up before letting them fall to his side. “The machine, it just beeped, but he’s still not moving-“
Tony and Steve both shared a flabbergasted look before they both suddenly burst out laughing.
“I wanna re-do our first date.”
“I honestly still can’t fathom the idea of Jaws being something they would show in the park. What if a little kid walked by?” Steve questioned after he and Tony got comfortable.
“No, no, no,” Bucky exclaimed as he reached Tony’s side, looking for a button to press to call a nurse. “Tony, you can’t die.”
Or, he does, rather. But he can’t believe it.
As Rhodey continued to watch Tony swipe his finger across the StarkPad, he heard someone walking by. He turned his head to see Steve coming, a towel around his neck showing that he’d been working out.
“Already done, Captain.”
“He wasn’t sure yet. Depends how easy the fix is. That’s the problem with building shit barely anyone else understands - you don’t know how bad it actually is until you get there.”
“Maybe I’ll join you if you’re still here after I get some work done. If you’re not, I’ll see you later Rhodey.”
“You should have told us, Pete,” Steve said, his heart aching for his son. “I’m so sorry you felt that way.”
One minute he was showing off the pie he'd just finished assembling before it went into the oven, mentioning the cookies he wanted to start mixing together next. Then, Tony had smiled at him. Not just any smile.
“I need to book a cut,” Steve answered, a hint of sadness in his tone.
“Hey, Barnes. What brings you down here?” Rhodey asked with a curious smile as he shook Bucky’s hand.
“Yes, of course I remember, but this was… this was where I wanted to take you,” Tony stated as he looked Steve in the eyes.
Tony chuckled. “No, we are not. Just the three of us tonight.”
“Oh my god, Cap, you are so whiny right now,” Tony laughed fondly, resuming his scratching of Steve's back, moving it to his hair and arms for good measure. He kept it up a few minutes and Steve knew he was being completely irrational, but it still hurt. “I promise you, when we can finally tell him, there's no doubt in my mind Clint will be dethroned. And, in case it was not obvious enough, we are never telling Hawkass about this, ‘cause he will hold it over us forever.”
“Are you really not concerned that your husband basically just flat lined?”
Tony stood, leaning against the doorway, looking at Steve.
“Did you mean it?”
“Do you think they talked about our plans, and that’s why Bucky helped Rhodey with this?” Steve asked.
Rhodey looked at him and took the remote from where Tony had set it. “It was?”
Tony managed to nudge Peter just enough that they could both awkwardly sit on the chair, Steve crouched next to them. They each held one of Peter’s hands and Steve had no doubt Tony felt just as sad as he did about Peter’s admission.
superheroes. The fact that you’re asking proves our point, I think. We lost our cool a while ago, Capsicle. Now, scootch over so I can get in on sleepy Annie snuggles too.”
“I didn’t want you thinking… I didn’t want you to hear I didn’t want to make a family tree and think it was because I was ashamed of our family,” Peter reiterated. “Wait, is this why you made all those things for dinner?”
“I’m fine, Tony,” Steve answered patiently. So much more patiently than he used to. “You have that face.”
,” Peter said mostly to himself, leaning back against his chair and curling up on himself.
under his breath. He’d been recognized himself a few times and found it annoying, he couldn’t imagine what it was like for Tony, let alone the two most popular Avengers. He’d been curious about Steve and Tony’s relationship when Steve had told him, but the more time he spent with them, together or separately, the more he saw how much they loved each other, and just how fiercely Tony wanted to protect Steve.
“I know it’s still early but- wanna go grab something now?”
had he tried to blame it on his old man. “I just wish I could let it go, but I can’t. I have to try. I don’t- I’m not strong enough to let you go.”
“It was! They talk about what to do if bad people come talk to us,” Peter explained very seriously.
“I was wondering where the nugget was.” Tony crouched next to Steve with a groan, resting his head on his shoulder so he could look at the tiny human resting on his chest. “Even now, the sight of you and a tiny baby sleeping on your chest makes my theoretical ovaries twitch.”
? Really!?” Steve whined. Before he or Tony could add much else, Tony's phone rang with Pepper's ringtone, which meant he couldn’t ignore her.
“Fuck no! Yours is even worse. We really need new pillows.” Tony shaped and punched the pillow some more before settling in with a content sigh. “Passable.”
“What if he’s expecting more though? Something better than a re-do of our first date? It’s our first milestone one, sorta, and I know he usually forgets these things until the last minute, but… what if he’s expecting me to plan something
“So, we both agree, we just tell them we tried but with them both being away-”
Steve smiled as he sat down next to Tony’s feet on the bed and leaned in for a chaste kiss. “I can’t wait for later. We’re going to have such a good time tonight,” Steve stated after he moved back to reach for a donut of his own.
“Tony, I’m-“ Steve started saying. His breath hitched, and Tony expected a coughing fit until he realized tears were streaming down Steve’s cheeks. “I’m not sorry I got the serum. It’s the only way I would have gotten you, and you are the most amazing part of my life. But I am sorry it’s causing so much pain right now.”
Steve grabbed a wipe from the container they kept in the room and cleaned Tony off, leaving soft kisses as he went. Tony let himself be cared for, eyes heavy and closing quickly while Steve worked. He felt the bed shift, and heard the water running in the sink of their bathroom. Soon, Steve’s arm was back around his waist and he molded himself against Steve’s chest – the only time they ever fell asleep spooned this way.
Tony bit back a laugh. “I knew you were going to ask that. When we were talking about it last night, it got us thinking about our backgrounds, and in talking, food came up-“
Steve pushed himself up, hovering over his husband, one eyebrow raised in question and the most boyish and playful grin on his face. One Tony answered by meeting his mouth in a hungry kiss.
“You’ve always been better with the newborn stage,” Tony remarked, looking at Steve now that Ana was looking in the opposite direction.
Steve hummed in answer, grabbing Tony’s hand, his silent plea to let him start the conversation they had both hoped Peter would initiate.
When he got close to Tony’s room, he panicked. He heard the tell-tale sound of the heart rate monitor flatlining, he picked up the pace, bursting into Tony’s room and finding him alone, the monitor buzzing furiously.
They both stood quietly for a few minutes, looking around, both of them clearly thinking something through. In Bucky’s case, he was trying to figure out a way to get Tony on the phone so he could get the damned info he needed out of him. He pulled out his phone, finally seeing the dozens of messages from Steve -- including some from this morning alerting him that Tony had left New York, the tone becoming increasingly alarmed as the messages went on and Bucky wasn’t responding to him.
“What was Harry’s dad saying, Pumpkin Pete?” Tony asked.
“The other’s best friend was a dead end, so they’ll just need to live with their plans?”
The two of them put the helmets on and as soon as the bike was started, away they went.
to the armor, and Tony crashed into a building. When he landed, he had to get out and she hit him with a spell and just paralyzed him. He fell and broke his arm when I tried to grab him to minimize the fall, and he’s been like that since. For some reason, FRIDAY can’t track his vitals the same way as usual. Heck, she can’t even talk in the room, and our phones keep dying. She needs him connected to the machine, but every few minutes, it flat lines. FRIDAY said he’s fine – she thinks he can actually hear us based on his heartrate’s fluctuations depending on what we say around him. But the machines and Tony are going haywire in here, and we don’t know why. Thor’s trying to get Loki to ask him if he knows how to fix it, and I think Clint was trying to convince Coulson to bring in Strange or Wong and see if maybe they understood what’s happening. I’m just so happy he doesn’t have the arc reactor anymore, cause god knows how that would be affected.”
“We knew this day would come.”
He tried to remember what to do in the case of cardiac arrest, but everything he’d learned had evaporated from his mind. All there was, was Tony, unmoving on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.
Steve's head was resting on his chest, just over his heart, eyes closed and looking so peaceful. Tony's fingers worked as if on their own, curling into the soft strands and pulling just so. The pleasure filled sigh that rumbled in Steve's chest made him want to pull just a bit harder, but he knew they were both too exhausted for more of that right away. At the very least, he needed a short breather.
“Oh, hey Steve. Have a nice workout?”
“I apologize for interrupting, Sir, but Agent Coulson needs to speak to you urgently,” JARVIS interrupted them. “There seems to be an incident at Oscorp that requires intervention by the Avengers.”
But Tony knew.
Tony smiled at Rhodey, shaking his head as he exclaimed, “that’s ok! As long as it’s either tomorrow or the day after. I really need to know all the details. You’re the best Rhodey Bear!”
“Guys, FRIDAY said you need to change the subject,” Clint said as he opened the door to Tony’s room. “Tony’s vitals are all over the place. What the heck are you talking about anyways?”
“You don’t think…”
The same answer he gave Tony when he knew exactly what Tony didn’t want to talk about. The answer that had almost broken Tony’s heart, and them in the process, when Steve had all but accepted his fate a few months ago, sure and resigned in a way only Steve could be, but in a calm peaceful sort of way. The one that kept Tony awake at night, and fueled these lab binges and made him call in every damned favour he could think of.
“Yeah, I do,” Peter nodded, settling back against Steve’s shoulder. “I do love our family, even if it is a bit weird and complicated to explain sometimes. I, um- I had done my whole presentation. I just felt too weird to present it, knowing my answers wouldn’t be like anyone else’s.”
Steve nodded. “Yup. You’re always going to be our baby boy. Live with it.”
He took the spoon and dove in.
Tony couldn’t help running his fingers through Steve’s hair, already dry after their shower. A smile crept on his lips as he remembered how delicious it had looked not that long ago, messy and sweaty from a day mostly spent in bed tangled together.
Bucky shook his head from side to side, his hand following the motion. “Steve wanted me to figure out if Tony was expecting something big.” He recounted the highlights of his conversation with Steve on the topic, leaving out the specific plans for now, but Rhodey just nodded along as if it all made sense.
“Steve would be right normally. So, just so we’re clear here, they both asked us to figure out what the other’s planning, am I right?”
Tony smiled. “That Airbnb we stayed at in Vermont.” Steve nodded, a broad smile on his lips. “We should go back. It was nice there. Maybe the next weekend Pep has Morgan?”
“We won’t get lazy days like these soon enough,” Steve said, as if justifying his actions.
“I don’t think I’m familiar with that Avenger, baby. What do they do?” Tony asked, clearly confused by the name.
“Excuse me, our first date was not his party! It was June 16th,” Tony exclaimed as he continued to scroll on his StarkPad.
Steve had only been gone less than 48 hours. He needed to give Bucky a chance to figure out his plan. Not all super soldiers’ plan of attack involved just jumping in (or through) things without much thought after all.
When the elevator doors finally opened on the med floor, Bucky spotted Clint in a quiet corner talking with Phil, no doubt reassuring him he was fine – it seemed the mother hen gene ran strong within their ragtag bunch.
“You braided my hair
“It always makes me laugh when you defend me so fiercely, considering how much you hated me when we met,” Steve recounted after they’d checked up on Peter, finding their son starfished on his bed, in a mountain of teddy bears.
Steve came back around 7:30, the donut box in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other. He tried to come in quietly, as to not wake Tony up, and he went to their room.
“Oh,” Peter replied quietly. “Do you mind if I go email my teacher? I just wanna ask if she’ll let me do my presentation – even if she doesn’t change my grade, I think I want to present it.”
He felt Steve’s cheek move against his collarbone, leaving no doubt a smile was forming at Tony’s words.
“And I thank Uncle Thor’s relatives for that every day, Petey Pie.” Tony kissed his forehead again, making Peter laugh some more.
Rhodey looked at Tony with a confused look, wondering what kind of ‘big thing’ Steve had done for Tony before. “So you want me to go talk to him about your anniversary?”
“You know I love you tons, right baby boy?” Steve told Peter, not for the first time that day.
The ride was nice, it had been a while since Tony had been on Steve’s bike. The cool air felt nice on his face and the lights of the city seemed to just fade into blurs.
“Tony was definitely right,” Bucky smiled. “What’d’you bet?”
Tony all but purred as a satisfied smile bloomed on his face. “Always,” he answered, pulling an equally smiling Steve in for a kiss.
“Well, I don’t think parents are going to let their kids walk by a movie like Jaws without supervision. Plus I’m glad we stopped at this one since this was one on your list that I wanted you to see with me.” Tony smiled up at Steve as he leaned onto his shoulder.
“Pete, backpack,” Steve reminded him, earning himself an eye roll from his son. “And, we decided to take a day off. Tony, stop eating the cheese.” He gently batted away Tony's hand before wrapping him in his arms to keep his hands away from all the plates and bowls in front of them.
The monitor shifted back to the steady rhythmic beep that meant Tony’s heart was beating normally. Bucky breathed out a sigh of relief, but still frowned as Tony continued to not move.
Bucky was confused. “So, did he want you to have Steve cancel his? He has to know Steve’s planning something.”
“I keep you around ‘cause you can reach the high shelves in the cupboard. And you’re cute,” Tony winked at him. “You were always more patient than I was. I hated not knowing why Peter was crying and how to make it better. It got easier when he could talk.”
“Again kiddo, not the point. We just wanna know
4-year-old,” Steve grumbled. “And it wasn’t even Clint and Nat there, I asked them. They had cheap knock offs of us.”
“Well, you do. It’s a mighty good one too.” Tony could feel Steve smile against his skin where his cool lips grazed his forehead, the faintest of kisses.
Steve laughed, pressing his lips to Tony's quickly. “If the world only knew.”
“Your hair's getting long,” he mused quietly.
“Dinner sounds good.” Steve gives him a peck on the lips. “And we can come back here for dessert.”
Not his Steve.
“Boy names are hard.” Steve shifted a bit, hiking his face up so he could burry it in Tony’s neck, swinging one leg over Tony’s waist like a cuddly koala bear. “We’re fucked if it’s a girl though. So many names on that list.”
Bucky held out his hand to help Steve up. “For a second? I’ve knocked you out 6 times already and you’ve barely seemed to care. You usually thrive on kicking my ass.”
Peter ran up to them waving his drawing at them. “Look what I draw!”
So, he finally made his way to the workshop, not even bothering to confirm with their resident AI on Tony’s whereabouts. Steve wasn’t home, which meant Tony was sulking in his workshop and ignoring the world. He was a predictable man. Unfortunately, Bucky was currently a wrong man. And when he walked into the workshop, it wasn’t Tony he found there. It was the Colonel.
“How in the world- my hand’s all dirty now.”
“We’ll add that to the yes list, then.” Friday chimed in to let them know it was added.
Steve turned to Bucky and spoke quietly so only he’d hear. “See if you can get an answer from Tony soon enough so I can book something else if I need to.”
“He didn’t ask that, no. He just wanted to make sure what he was planning was okay. Guess he’s gonna ask him to cancel day of? No idea. His brain works in mysterious ways sometimes.”
“I’m not sad I’m adopted or that you’re my parents. It’s so hard to explain. I love you guys-“ Peter cut himself off with what Steve thought might be the beginnings of tears.
“Where is our progeny anyways?” he asked after long minutes had passed where neither of them did anything but watch her sleep.
“I’m sorry, a spell?” Bucky looked at Steve like he’d gone mad. Or hopefully he’d misheard.
family tree might not be related by blood, but that doesn’t mean they love you any less. Or that their impact in your life is any less.”
“Yeah, makes sense,” Bucky answered, trying to formulate how to ask Rhodey without sounding too obvious. “Hope it’s not too time consuming. I feel like Steve mentioned something about it being their anniversary this weekend?”
“Again, one day Ana-Bella is going to say shit like that to you, and you’ll feel our pain,” Tony smirked at him.
“Why haven’t we done this sooner?”
“An anniversary?”
“You’re kidding right?”
Tony finally manages to extricate himself from Steve’s grip, still holding his hand, and pulls him towards the elevator.
“Yeah bud, go for it,” Steve answered, giving Peter one last hug. “I’m sure she’ll consider it. We can start a movie when you come back.”
Tony turned his head to meet Steve’s gaze. “And thank you for the lovely dinner. Next time, let’s plan our anniversary together.”
“Shit,” Tony breathed out. “I was actually looking forward to a quiet night in and going to bed early. Tell Agent Agent I’ll take the call from downstairs in a bit.”
Wait a minute… Rhodey was Tony’s best friend.
Steve captured Tony’s lips with his own, taking his time and keeping it gentle and soft. He made a quiet little questioning sound, punctuated with a light squeeze of Tony’s ass under his palm. Tony gave his own affirmative moan in response and Steve rolled him onto his back, pressing him into the mattress. Tony took advantage of their position to get his own hands on Steve’s body, under his shirt and trailing up his back.
“I don’t think
“That happens a lot with your dad, come to think of it.”
“Looking forward to seeing the candle distribution on my cake tonight to make that numerical situation happen,” Peter replied with an eye roll.
Bucky scoffed. “I thought you might say that.” He let go of Steve, who sat on the edge of Tony’s bed. “I don’t want to make this weird, okay? It was in the heat of the moment. I thought we were losing him…”
Rhodey quirked an eyebrow at him questioningly. “Do you not live in close proximity to Tony? The man never shuts up when it comes to Steve,” Rhodey retorted, his voice laced with fondness to soften the words.
Steve didn’t think anything of what had just happened and smiled at Tony, moving over behind the couch to kiss his head.
?” Tony exclaimed to Steve in mock indignation as Peter jumped on top of him for a hug, making him groan in pain. “I’ll make sure Papa tells me all about it tonight. How was your day, mister man? Make any fun things? Learn new shapes?”
“Yes and no,” Steve admitted with a laugh.
“It’s mine and Tony’s anniversary soon,” Steve finally started explaining. “And for some reason I’m second guessing my plans.”
Steve turned to Tony. “Wait, Oscorp. That's-"
“And every day I wonder why I still talk to you,” Steve scowled back.
“I am sure if anything ever happened to you, aunt Tasha might hurt whoever gets to you worse than Dad and I would. And not just because she’s Black Widow,” Steve chuckled. “Dad’s right, kiddo. DNA doesn’t always make family. Those lines on a family tree don’t show just how much someone meant to you or to raising you or to shaping the person you become.”
“Good?” Steve asked when Tony’s breath had returned to normal.
“We won’t, no,” Tony replied.
“No can do on that last one. They have to look like you.” Steve left a soft kiss on his neck, lingering over his pulse point, sending a shiver through him he wasn’t expecting. “But otherwise, I agree.”
Steve nods, programming their fancy oven to stop after a certain time with JARVIS’s help, though he has to admit he doesn’t care about the pie in the least anymore. And one of the other occupants of the tower is bound to find it anyways.
“It’d be a shame to waste ‘em while we got ‘em.”
“Oh,” Rhodey perked up. “He mentioned that to you?”
“I don’t have a face.”
He knew time was ticking away, and all he wanted was for it to truly stop, to spend all of it with Steve. Wrapped up in each other’s arms. Never having to let go.
Rhodey narrowed his eyes at Bucky, his expression going curious and also knowing. “Being as well acquainted with those two idiots as we are, something tells me I know exactly why you were down here to talk to Tony.”
Ana chose that moment to stretch, one little fist pumping out in front of her with a great big sigh as she settled back into her comfy position against Steve’s chest. Her tiny hand curled into Steve’s shirt and Tony could all but see his husband melt under her.
“Shh,” Steve shushed him gently. “You'll wake her up.”
Steve ignored them all, leaning back against his SUV with Peter still in his grip. “What was so cool today, Pete?”
“Not a fucking chance.”
“Not stupid,” Tony disagreed, resuming the lazy movement of his hand on Steve’s skin. “Hard to deprogram that thought from your brain. But, no, I don’t think I do? Some days I think one would be great, then the other. I know it’s the most cliché thing ever, but I really just want them to be healthy. And to look like you.”
“Um...I’m not too sure. This is a new thing that I’ve seen you do.”
Steve vaguely hears himself breathe out a small questioning sound, too busy reveling in the feel of Tony’s soft lips and the prickle of his beard against parts of his thumb, the sensation so foreign and yet so distinctly Tony that Steve feels like he’s known it his whole life.
“What you told Tony though,” Steve started asking, a tentative edge to his voice.
“You know I love you, right?” Steve answered, feeling truly pained by his explanation – more so for others in that situation than himself.
“A superhero,” Steve corrected him, smiling at Peter.
He was sure Steve had fallen asleep, and was about to let himself succumb to the pull of slumber too, when their joined hands were pulled right up to Steve’s face, and his husband’s lips kissing each of his fingers in succession.
Tony smiles up at him. “I wish I didn’t know about the pie, ‘cause I’d love to make you blush with how much of a double entendre that is.”
“Stop moving, I’ll get it-“
Bucky pretended to consider the offer, even though they both knew what the answer would be, then nodded his head slowly. “I could eat. It’s the least Tony can do after making us have to have this conversation, really.”
“Door,” Tony mumbled when Steve finally released his mouth.
covers it appropriately.” Peter leaned over the couch and kissed his daughter, making his own parents beam. “Want me to grab her, Pops?”
“No! They wouldn’t. Would they?”
Bucky let out a
“Can I-?” he starts asking. He never gets the full sentence out because Tony moves forward with the softest nod of his head and Steve’s mind takes over every part of his body.
“We can share our Tony and Steve dating woes while we’re at it.”
“Hundred bucks and a blow job.”
“Oh yeah?”
Tony chuckled, remembering their day of errands and carting Morgan around to her dance class and take-out while watching some new animated movie that had just been released. He'd elected for comfort over style that day, with joggers, one if his usual worn band tees, and a denim jacket. Nothing sexy in the least.
earlier,” Steve remembered, sitting at Tony's feet, propping them on his lap and rubbing his ankles and legs. “You didn’t say you met the Avengers.”
“Steve?” Tony exhales his name, his own eyes having drifted down to Steve’s lips.
Steve just hummed, not an agreement or dismissing the statement. He looked so content and happy, relaxed in a way neither of them had felt in weeks it seemed. Tony kissed his hair, and closed his eyes. He knew he could easily drift off right then and there if he let himself. Steve’s heavy, warm body pressed into his like the best weighed blanket anyone could ever get, his rhythmic breathing better than any white noise machine, and his free hand twined with Steve’s on his chest, a reminder that he wasn’t alone and wouldn’t be again.
“I would say that based on what I’ve heard from you and your significant others,
“Need system.”
Steve had never thought of any of it this way, which was precisely what was so valuable about Tony. He’d always been willing to ask the questions no one else would even think of, and his ability to do so seemed only to be strengthened by the fact that he had lived most of his life outside the dynamics that were so naturalized in this universe. He took absolutely nothing for granted.
“My point, whippersnapper, is that we need to find whatever your equivalent of brushing your teeth is, and maybe a big meal like that was more of a third or a fifth step. I’m going to keep going to the dinners in the meantime. They’re…it was good, I think, to get some adult interaction outside of the hospital, and they seem like a genuinely decent bunch. But maybe for you it’ll be better to spend some time with Tony one-on-one first, especially since the internship will mean you’ll have something besides your personal lives to talk about. Eventually, when you’re ready, whether that’s two or five or fifteen weeks from now, you’ll join us for dinner too.” After a couple of sniffling sounds that May studiously pretended not to hear, Peter straightened up and glanced toward the kitchen.
“It turns out that I really like the big picture stuff. I like coming in at the beginning of something and building it up from nothing. Ever since we got back and I realized what good shape SHIELD had been in without me there, I’ve been feeling…I don’t know, a little unsatisfied. I think maybe this could be really good for both of us, Tony.”
“I have to go to work, Tony! The CEO can’t just stop showing up mid-week with no explanation. Do you have any idea how many meetings I’ve postponed already, not to mention the conference call with our Canadian branch—”
“Shh, it’s okay sweetheart. We got time. We got all the time in the world.”
“JARVIS, stop the footage.” Normally, the AI didn’t reply to simple commands unless the user requested confirmation, but he vocalized quiet agreement in addition to clearing the screen. Steve made a miserable moaning sound and buried his face in his hands. Phil was almost relieved to see the break in his almost robotic facade of a few seconds ago.
Steve thought, too, of how completely that Tony had loved kids. He celebrated the successes of the children he visited in hospitals as if they were his own, and followed up with them for years after the fact. He could talk for hours about the work his kids did in the labs, all the ways they were going to save the world and put Tony out of business. In so many other ways Tony had been too ashamed or traumatized to love as openly and as deeply as he wanted, but being around children seemed to light up all of those dark places. Steve had wondered in his most optimistic moments if adoption might be on the table for them someday.
“I’m pretty sure he said something about moving to Toledo with his fiancé while he half-ran out the door.”
Tony had agreed (because what else could he do, really, standing there with his sad floor-pasta and trying desperately not to remember what it had been to truly starve.) Then he’d gotten the hell out of Dodge, avoiding being alone with Bruce the rest of the evening and heading to bed as early as seemed plausible.
It was such a non-sequitur, even in a conversation made of them, that Domen couldn’t entirely mask her surprise.
He never could have done it, Steve would reflect later, for anyone else. His instincts to protect and shield the people he loved were too engrained. But from almost the very beginning of his time in this century, Coulson had been his handler, and Steve had come to regard that title with profound respect that bordered on reverence. Phil regularly held all of their lives in his hands with a competence that was almost other-worldly—maybe, just for a few hours, he could bear the weight of Steve’s guilt and shame and rage and exhaustion, too.
“Fat fucking chance.”
Some of the not-so-old hurt of their breakup following Peter’s outing lingered close to the surface of MJ’s words, and his stomach lurched. He’d lost her in one capacity already, the thought of her being out of his life entirely felt unbearable. Before he could do any further damage, he pulled the heavy bottle out of his backpack and waved it in her direction. She took it with a pinched sort of expression that somehow managed to look both impressed and disapproving.
Steve picked up his shield. It felt heavy in his hands in a way it rarely did, but he knew as surely as he knew his own name that Tony would not easily forgive him for only feigning a full effort. He threw the shield, not at Tony but against the furthest wall. It sailed a perfect path toward the armour, promising a brutal impact that never came. Like Clint’s arrows, it was knocked from the sky with multiple blasts from the three energy beams; it clattered to the floor twenty feet away from Steve. The Hulk whooped; several of the others began loudly placing bets on the outcome.
Tony’s mood was darkening by the second, and being in the shop with nothing to do was only making it worse So he regretfully made his way back to the penthouse, a half-formed plan to take a sleeping pill and have a long afternoon nap in the back of his mind.
“Natalia, hvatit.”
“I think we both know that the grades you’ve been getting over the past several months are not reflective of your abilities, Peter.” There was nothing, really, to say in the face of this matter-of-fact assessment. Either he could insist he was in fact as disengaged and foolish as the past few months suggested. (This option would undoubtedly lead to him getting kicked out of school.) Or he would have to admit he simply didn’t want to join the decathlon team, or any group activity for that matter. Morita nodded as if Peter’s silence had involved a vocal and enthusiastic agreement. “Yes, I think this is going to be a good opportunity to reset and establish good habits with like minded peers. They’re meeting tomorrow in the library. 4 PM. Don’t be late.”
Rhodes uncoiled himself from around Tony and stood, placing a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
There were not a lot of mean but non-derogatory words that rhymed with Morita. Now sure, someone else in Peter’s current position might have been worried about other things: trying to find something to say to his awkward and suspicious peers in decathlon, maybe, or even just figuring out whether the bizarre bowl of mismatched snacks in the centre of the table was some attempt at a new-agey trail mix or some kind of hazing ritual. But Peter, for whom social anxiety had long since given way to a kind of social defeatism, was mostly concerned with trying to complete the free-verse series of complaints against his principal he’d begun composing on the too-short walk from his last class of the day to the library.
“Well that one was easy,” Steve joked, grateful for the watery chuckles he received in reply. They would need a more extended conversation with James, of course; they’d have to review his contract, get a sense from him and from Tony as to what they were both comfortable having Rhodes be present for, but today Steve was relying essentially on the honour system, assuming the two men were comfortable enough with each other, at least, to voice any discomfort if it happened. “This one might be a little harder, but I don’t think we can really put it off anymore. We need to talk about how we’re going to handle everything that happened before the press conference.”
“For letting you die. For, please, Nat, I swear I didn’t mean to, I tried, I…so hard, I tried, no one would listen but I should have made them, I should have…” A small, cool hand replaced the paddle; Natasha’s hand felt like a balm against his heated skin, and he sobbed in relief and guilt and sorrow. Eventually there were other hands, moving Tony off of Natasha’s lap and twisting him up and onto one side, so they could hold him without Tony having to put pressure on any of his sorest places.
Peter was looking to his left out the window, a blaring signal that he was trying to lie or hold something back which Tony had only semi-successfully managed to train out of the other version of the kid. He found himself extremely grateful for it now, because otherwise the hostility from someone who had only ever been polite bordering on deferential to him in the past might have been enough to scare Tony off. Instead, he tried for slightly bored politeness, and attempted to remember that this wasn’t his Peter. This was a stranger, an isolated, scared kid no less, one he would scare the hell out of if he rushed in too fast.
“So wait, that purple thing yesterday, that was for me, wasn’t it? I was supposed to kneel at your feet?” Bruce didn’t smile. He didn’t laugh at their cultural incongruences the way he had been all day. For  just a few seconds, he was visibly and totally wrecked, his grief for Phony (ugh, that was starting to sound callous even to him—Stark Mark 2, maybe?) an almost palpable thing. Tony stood, frozen, trying to determine whether leaving Bruce alone with his sorrow or trying, somehow, to comfort him was the best way forward. Ultimately, he edged closer to the other man and took a long, deliberate inhalation, definitely loud enough to be audible to Bruce’s enhanced senses. Then, as they locked eyes, he released it. Bruce smiled, bittersweet and pained, but still a smile as he joined Tony on the next set, and they stood there and breathed together until Bruce could manage to speak again.
ETA: All of what you see in this chapter would have been preceded by a LOT of negotiation and discussion on all of their parts. I included bits and pieces of that, but by no means the entirety of those conversations. If you want to see more, that’s certainly something I (or the Doctor) can provide.
Reflexively, he looked her up and down for any visual indicators of how the toll the battle had taken. JARVIS had quietly informed him around 10 that it was over, but that the team would have to undergo decontamination showers on top of the usual post-mission debriefing, so their return was likely several hours out. It was only then that Tony had allowed himself to join a softly snoring Cap in dreamland.
Steve came to with a start as a thick piece of leather was pressed—well, sort of more shoved, really—into his hand. That particular mystery was fairly easily solved; one glance revealed it to be Phil’s leash, the one he rarely used but which matched Steve’s favourite of his collars. The context of having said item given to him took a bit longer to piece together through the lingering fog of Dom-dep. But the dep wasn’t as bad as it should have been, wasn’t even as severe as it had been before he’d left Wakanda…(
“Tony.”
And abruptly, after worrying for days what had caused Tony to flee so suddenly from his office, Steve didn’t give a shit. Nor did he care right now about being friends, or trying to keep Tony at arm’s length. He let just a hint of the Dominance that had been ebbing at the surface for hours now to surge forward, carrying him to his feet and across the room. Tony tracked his movements with delayed exhaustion, grunting quietly when Steve grabbed him around the back of the neck and hauled him against his chest in a hug. He kept his hold loose at first, trying to prepare himself with what little control he had left for the reality that Tony might not want Steve touching him, but after standing stiffly in Steve’s loosely looped arms for a few seconds, Tony sagged like a deflated balloon, no longer even holding up his own weight.
One second, Sam is sitting across from Peter, sympathetic and patient as usual. The next, he has grabbed Peter by the scruff of the neck and has begun moving him toward the door. It’s a hold that Peter could easily break if he used his strength, and one they both know he won’t. Mostly because he’s still stunned that
“Explain. Right now.”
In short, you’re absolutely correct that the decline and eventual elimination of subtonin was a possibility, it was simply one that posed severe enough risks that placing emphasis on it seemed unwise.
Steve had not been the only one to try to move Tony from where he still lay. By now, pretty much the whole team had tried, their strategies varying but each entirely consistent with who Tony knew them to be. Bruce and Phil were both their own specific mix of gentle and practical, supporting without coddling. Clint and Rhodey had both taken more aggressive approaches, a sharp contrast to Steve who had been all sweethearts and softness since he’d heartlessly refused what might have been Tony’s most desperate request. Natasha had been mostly quiet, as if she hadn’t quite decided yet who or what Tony most needed from her. So far Barnes, or rather the Soldier, had probably been his favourite companion. He’d stayed just a foot or two inside the door, a silent show of support that made zero demands on Tony himself. Even Barnes, though, had a hard time looking at Tony right now. All of them did. He didn’t quite know where the discomfort came from, or even if it the reason behind it was the same for all of them. Were they disgusted by Tony now that they knew what he’d left behind to stay here? Perhaps they were upset that he hadn’t told them about Peter up until now? Maybe some of them were even upset on this Peter’s behalf—that Tony might have saved him and had chosen not to?
Steve watched with pride and with a deep sense of contentment as Talia continued speaking. The room adored her; she was funny and articulate and so clearly at home in her body and her role that it was practically infectious, the same way her anger and discontent had once been. The applause when she finished was sincere, and it took ages for the conference room to clear out because almost everyone seemed to want to approach Talia, to thank her or ask follow up questions; Steve was reminded oddly of Tony at the big fancy parties, the way he seemed to have a kind of magnetic pull that brought others to him so that Tony could charm and dazzle them. Finally, it was just the two of them left, and Talia made a teasing show of just pretending to notice him.
“Buck, I’d really rather not—”
“Cap? Surprised you’re back so soon. FRI said you did great with the kid.”
Honestly, Tony hadn’t wanted to stay on this topic any longer than he had to. But they had still all seemed so freaked out that he’d learned about the circumstances of his counterpart’s death alone. Even Clint was uncharacteristically solemn, and he’d stopped trying to convince Tony that the banana Runts were not, in fact, garbage food for garbage people as Tony had insisted they were. So maybe, Tony had decided, maybe he could use the situation to try to comfort them.
None of this made it any less surprising when the two of them walked into the playroom, Clint radiating smugness and Tony…Tony’s expression was one Steve didn’t recognize, something dark and promising.
“Shh, shh, you’re fine. And so is Bucky, I promise. Something’s been brewing with him for a while, I think, and I promise we’ll help him get that sorted soon. But for now let’s finish up here, hmm? Ten more.” Tony wanted pretty desperately to go after Bucky, but there was no way to focus on anything else when the strap descended again, this time against the tops of his thighs. He wailed, Steve’s name the only recognizable language amidst a sea of formless pleas and cries  and apologies. “You’re so close, Tony, we’re almost there. This is almost over. All that’s left now is for you to forgive yourself. Let it go, sweetheart.”
“Girl, you seem pretty awesome and I’m glad that Peter has you in his life, but no way are you gonna talk me into calling anything I’ve put into my own body ‘Thor Juice.’ You got it?”
“Though I am quite enjoying our current pursuits, I am in fact quite hungry. Shall we partake of the fine Midgardian tradition of summoning food to appear at our door?”
The task proved harder than he’d thought at first. It had been years since Tony had had the opportunity to design for fun, and it turned out that part of his brain was a little rusty. Steve even threatened to take the tablet away when Tony unintentionally found himself opening the files for Clint’s damn boomerang arrows again.
This was the closest they’d ever come to acknowledging that day since it had happened. Steve’s mouth was suddenly dry.
“We will not permit anyone to harm you, most especially yourself.”
This is an interesting question. The previous Stark’s relationship with SI was, I would say on the whole, a more distant one. Much like the MCU version of the man, the D/s universe’s Stark turned the company away from weapons after his time in captivity, but especially after making Ms. Potts CEO of the company and shortly thereafter being outed as a sub, Stark completed most of his work for the company without interacting directly with anyone beyond Ms. Potts herself.
“Report, Agent,” Coulson barked, rising to his feet.
“Would you like to kneel at my feet while we talk, or would you prefer to stay standing?” was Coulson’s next query. This one was even easier. Tony had wanted to be on his knees for Phil since that morning in the media room weeks ago. It felt natural and right to sink onto the pillow Phil placed on the floor. “May I touch you or would you prefer space?”
However, part of the reason that the OCS eventually incorporated social as well as biochemical and hormonal assessments was that it started to become clear that factors beyond the strictly physical did play a role in how a person experienced their orientation. While this remains currently unconfirmed, Steve Rogers has long suspected that his time with HYDRA has altered James Barnes’ orientation. (This is not to say that anyone who faces trauma would become more submissive; indeed many might respond just the oppsosite way. And shifting on the OCS in adulthood as Rogers assumes Barnes has done would be exceedingly rare. The point is merely that one’s experiences and attitudes do seem to have an impact on where one lands on the OCS.)
“What do you think, Cap? Want to go a few rounds?”
, “vanished in the Snap. Was just me and one other person—well, android technically I think, anyway the ship I’d come in on got stranded. We drifted through space for…well, let’s just say long enough for food to become a pretty big issue.” Unable to look at any of them, not wanting to see the pity or sadness or whatever they might be directing his way, Tony scarfed down the remains of his breakfast. He tried to hand the damn orange wedge that had started all of this to Rhodey; they’d always stolen food from one another, for fuck’s sake, he didn’t want that to be something else that was taken away from him. But Rhodey guided it back to Tony’s own mouth and held it there.
“You needed someone to punish, just as I did, Captain Rogers. We are both of us vengeful in our grief; I would never judge that which I so fully understand.”
Tony answered his call on the first ring, as he always did. The sound on the suit’s internal speakers was perfect; Peter could recognize the kinds of background noise that meant Tony was at SHIELD, and he knew a brief moment of guilt for having interrupted before he was babbling out a rushed explanation of an invisible man. He was almost grateful when Tony interrupted him mid-sentence.
These replies include some details about how Dom and sub drop work in the D/s universe. If you want to skip that, stop reading after the first reply.
“I was, well at first I was mad. Then I was, um, here.”
His umpteenth post-mortem of the team drew to a sudden and unexpected close when he limped into the kitchen to find Clint throwing bright orange popcorn in the air for Natasha to catch in her mouth. That scene alone was odd enough, but when he took advantage of their distraction to peer around the room, it got weirder. Because there was nothing weird. No kinky sex equipment he did or didn’t recognize, no implements designed for punishment, not even the kneeling pillow they’d had out for him the other morning. And in by far the oddest development of all? Clint breaking into a huge grin when he laid eyes on Tony. It wasn’t the first time, but it never ceased to get less strange.
“Mostly through temperature. It made me warm, and not just in the places where it had actual contact with my skin. Which is infuriating, by the way—it was borderline cruel to give me something like this and then leave where I couldn’t follow and ask you the hundred follow up questions I have about how it works. Oh, and I think it feels heavier, sometimes, too.”

“I don’t want to keep hiding from  you. Don’t let me.” With that, he extended his arms out to Steve, who took the housing unit with shaking, cautious hands, as if he was being handed something unimaginably precious.
“You know it’s not just those sections You know the entire thing is written like that, as if you weren’t even there.” Phil had apparently moved while Tony’s eyes had still been closed, because he was standing now, the offending report left behind on the coffee table. He wasn’t pressed right into Tony’s space the way Clint would have been, but like everything Phil did he was precise, situating himself just a step too close to be solely professional. “Writing yourself out of the picture like this is a manipulation of the truth. It’s an attempt to sell both of us the fiction that you are far less integral than you are. I won’t have you lying to either yourself or me, not as your handler and not as your Dominant.”
“You can draw from pictures like that? Hell yeah, that’d be awesome.”
“Of course I’ll help. I told you, I’m yours as long as the muffins hold out.” Tony’s answering smile was…God, it was almost shy. Steve downed his entire glass of orange juice in one pull, just to be doing something that wasn’t staring at the man across from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I—she caught me sneaking out to patrol, and she kinda lost it. Said that if I was determined to kill myself then she couldn’t sit by and watch anymore.” Tony grunted as if he’d been hit, and Steve wondered what about the words had been so hard for him to hear. (Now was not the time to ask, but he'd definitely come back to it some day.)   “Can I stay here for awhile? Not long, I’ve been saving up for my own place and if I cut back a little more on school hours I’ll be able to afford it sooner, but I’m not quite there yet. And I don’t know where else to go.”
Tony struggles to keep his distance from Peter, while Steve struggles to keep his distance from Tony.
“Ffffuck.”
His own annoyance is nothing, though, to the reactions of the other people in the room. Peter is practically radiating fury, his arms crossed over his chest, his face dotted with red splotches. Steve looks like he’s about to double over.
“Go away, Buck,” he muttered dully. Once upon a time Steve never would have thought himself capable of speaking to Bucky this way. Even though things would never be the same as they had been before Bucky’s fall and his subsequent time as the Soldier, Steve treated their end of the line promise as a near-sacred vow. (Not unlike the one he’d made to himself to protect Tony from anything and everything that might seek to harm him. Apparently he’d be failing everyone who mattered to him in one day.)
“I basically never leave the sunroom or the beach except to eat when I’m out here. I fucking
“Don’t work him up after everything we just did to get him calmed down, Clint,” Phil chided. Then, without warning or any disclaimer at all, he reached forward and took Tony’s balls in his hands. The pressure was so light it was practically non-existent, but the entire area was so sensitive that the intensity was immediate and consuming.
“I want in next time.”
like Mark Ruffalo. But this morning his Science Bro beamed his toothiest, goofiest smile at him.
“Is he, did he end up with Hydra or something?” The idea felt ludicrous; Tony hadn’t known Sam Wilson well in his own universe, but he had seemed like a decent and honourable guy. He felt oddly relieved when Steve immediately shook his head.
about Tony’s use of his safeword, as if it was truly something to be proud of.
But then, if Tony been in some kind of terrible dark plane, he’d have been there because of some kind of magical mix-up, not because he wanted to be there, because he’d
, I won’t do to get both of you back.” She kissed him then, hard and with enough Dominance threaded through it that his own instincts rose in challenge. But by then she was halfway out of the ring, turning to peer at him over her shoulder just long enough to add, “your flight leaves in four hours.”
It was slightly bizarre to see the extent to which being told that Tony
“I was passed a note this morning by one of your teammates.” Dr. Domen made quite the show of carefully unfolding a small sheet of paper. The neat cursive on the page was instantly recognizable as Natasha’s, and Steve restrained a groan. “'Despite his non-stop grinning, humming and general absurd merriment, I want to assure you that Captain Rogers did not in fact get laid recently and countermand your suggestion about not rushing into things'—not is underlined three times by the way. 'He’s just an idiot in love. If you could at least make him stop doing that stupid little half-skip when he walks, that would be ideal.'”
that—” Bruce laughed, a full-on belly laugh that highlighted how many more laugh lines this version of Banner had than his counterpart, and Tony was momentarily distracted enough by the combination of that sight and sound that he didn’t even register being guided onto the hospital bed. He was definitely right to guess it was souped up; the mattress was at least a Queen, and the thread count of the sheets was probably triple that of anything ever used in SHIELD medical.
looking at Peter precisely that way. Ned turned his head, and Peter’s heart went to his throat looking for any sign of submission from the other boy, any indication at all that this wasn’t all in his head. Instead, Ned pointed to a beefy looking guy across the street who was exiting the 24 hour gym on the corner.
“So, a regular Tuesday.”
Tony didn’t bother trying to curb his enthusiasm at this particular bit of news either. Bucky had excused himself from any scenes involving Tony and pain thus far, and while they were all willing to accept it if this became a permanent boundary of his, Tony was delighted by the possibility that it might not be. He didn’t like having to choose between the presence of one of his Dominants and his occasional cravings for rougher handling.
Both Peter Parker and Harley Keener, however, remained a presence in his life. I have witnessed firsthand the fact that both mourn him deeply. Colonel Rhodes and Ms. Potts have been charged with their care in his absence (not legally or officially, but via elaborate ‘Care and Feeding’ documents Mr. Stark ensured were part of his will), and they are both doing the best they can. Truthfully (and I hope I can trust you to keep this quiet) I do feel I owe Stark as much protection as I can give to those he considers his own, so I am doing what I can for both boys from a distance.
“Oh, she didn’t know. No one but Tony knew I was Spiderman then, and he promised to keep it that way and help me out with gear as long as I went with him.” Peter, still blissfully unaware that he’d said anything wrong at this point, made to take another drink of delicious, delicious Thor-juice (he’d started calling it this during stage one, much to MJ’s disgust). She yanked the bottle forcefully out of his hands.
“Yes. I’m ready. If he wants to rabbit, I plan to let him. Backing Tony into a corner almost never works. He just gets defensive, lashes out. But he’s also too honest to lie or avoid an issue forever. I won’t let him stew for long; if I’m wrong I don’t want him to end up working himself into a panic or another workshop binge. But I don’t think he will. He’ll come to me; JARVIS, make sure to find some kind of subtle way to let him know I’m working from home today, yeah?”
Perhaps, though, this should not have come as a surprise. The more time Phil spent with Tony the more he’d come to realize that one of the sharpest distinctions between him and the other version of the man that Phil had oved was that without any baggage surrounding submission itself, Tony’s natural inclination was to throw himself headlong into every scene. He went down as far and as hard as he could every time, gave over so much and held nothing back. It was beautiful, to be on the receiving end of that kind of trust and devotion, of course it was, and there would always be a time and a place for those kinds of scenes. But it didn’t always have to be that way, either, couldn’t be both because of the time constraints of non-vacation life and because eventually Tony would burn himself out. As much as Phil wanted to keep encouraging Tony to use submission to let himself break down into as many pieces as he need to, he was equally invested in helping Tony build himself back up again, so that eventually they could reach a point where some play was simply that: play.
“I think we’ll go with Sir for right now. I might not always be strict about it depending on what we both come to prefer, but for now I think it’ll help get you in the right mindset, help you adjust to thinking of me as a Dom that you answer to.”
“Before Peter, Ben and I were trying to have kids. We miscarried once, and nothing anyone said was of much help, but I read this thing one day…it said that even though they were gone, some of the fetus’s cells would always be inside me. That I was…I was changed forever because we had shared a body even for a short time.” The breath she inhaled then cut its way into her lungs, because no matter how many years go by, breathing in the reality of that loss will always tear at her insides. But she’s grateful, in a way, to be able to share this with Tony, another person who has lost a child in a way that’s invisible to the rest of the world. “The people we love change us, Tony. I get that in your case that’s turned up by a few dozen notches. But what you shared with that Peter will always be a separate thing from what you have with this version of him. Letting your partners connect with him will never touch it. Nothing will touch it, because the two of you changed each other forever.”
Struggling to handle the fallout of his unexpected intimacy with Bruce, Tony turns to Phil for help. Steve's pilot program faces challenges he didn't expect, and the team tries to draw him back into their usual traditions.
, exerting control without even a hint of force.
The bad news is that, given that Rhodey is not even on Earth when he receives Sam’s call, it takes almost two days for him to arrive. They are not even in the top ten of the worst days of Sam’s life, but they are among the most awkward. No one in the Compound is speaking to one another. Peter is furious with Steve for invading his privacy, and then for not telling him he knew about Tony. Steve is equally resentful that Peter hadn’t told him of Tony’s existence—both AI and otherwise—in the first place.
“I think that sounds like a good idea,” May agreed, not giving a still-conflicted Peter the chance to reply first. He glared halfheartedly, but looked away when she cocked a challenging eyebrow at him. When her gaze fell again on Tony, it was far gentler than it had been for the rest of the morning. “Whatever else happens, I really respect your honesty. I know there are a lot of other ways you could have gone about this, and you chose one that I know would put everything you all have built here at risk if it got out. And you chose knowing you would piss my kid off now over devastating him later, which…it’s still going to take me a while to adjust to even the idea of having co-parented with Tony Stark, but it’s a start.”
“He loves you too,” Steve countered, wrapping his arms around Tony's waist.
“But don’t tell him what I’m planning. Like I said, it’s going to be a surprise and I want to impress Steve with the fact that I’m actually planning this out.” Tony set his StarkPad down and looked at Rhodey with proud eyes.
Steve mouthed the word trophy, trying to put together what in the world Peter was getting to and had overheard. Next to him, Tony let out a soft relieved sigh.
“Nah, Steve and Nat won’t be home ‘til late tomorrow, probably the day after realistically. But, where’s Tony? I was sure he’d be down here-”
“Papa?”
“Hey, Pete?” Steve started as they were enjoying the pie he’d made as dessert. “Anything else happen at school this week we should know about?”
Clint has no response to Steve’s assessment of the situation, as it’s correct, and scowls at the flour covered kitchen. As Steve goes to leave the room with Tony, he stops at the table and leans down to whisper to Natasha.
"Hmmm?" responds Hawk, his head tilting slightly in Tony's direction, but his eyes never leaving the page he's reading.
Clint laughs and she can feel the sound reverberate through her body.
"You are exactly zero fun, you know that?" Tony pouts, grabbing the bag of chips from the counter and popping a few in his mouth.
“Tasha called me this morning and told me what happened. I stopped by one of Tony’s storage lockers and brought over some of the toys and books he had as a child. They should keep him entertained, at least for a few days,” she explains, “Any luck on turning him back?”
"There is plenty of storage space in the archery range, ma'am. Shall I seal away all weapons currently stored?" JARVIS asks in anticipation of her motives.
“Steve
"Good plan. You'll have to show me whatever stuff you come up with. Well, back to work. See you later!"
"Because you haven't given us any orders," Tony explains quietly, a tear rolling down his face, "I know we're little and we don't have much training, but we'll try really hard and we can do a lot of things. Are you going to sell us? Is that why you're being nice? To test our training?"
When he boards the jet, he is pleasantly unsurprised to see that JARVIS has already started running the pre-flight checks. Initially, the AI’s presence and all-knowingness had been a bit creepy, but he’s grown used to it, and even welcomes it most of the time. The rest of the team joins him shortly. Clint takes the pilot’s seat and finishes the pre-flight checks; Natasha sits next to him, and he can tell that even though her demeanor appears calm, she wants to hit something as much as he does; Bruce has his jaw set in a determined scowl, the look he always wears when he’s trying to keep a lid on the Other Guy; Thor appears as calm as Natasha, though the air crackles a bit when he walks past Steve.
Steve noticed the way Tony had a resigned air about him; he had simply given up. His features were normally stoic, but sometimes, when he thought no one was looking, his face would crumple as he mulled over the losses in the last few months. He had heard of how he had taken Peter Parker under his wing and could only think of how hard Tony might have taken that loss. He saw how Tony shied away from any form of contact, even from Rhodey.
The team had established a routine – breakfast together, poring over blueprints, trying to decipher what was on Fury’s pager (who used pagers anyway!), lunch, more blueprints and plans, before finally retiring for the night. The same, always. Clint always hung out with Natasha, they talked, they held each other through the trauma – after all, what were best friends for?
To the world, Steven Grant Rogers was an upright man, with high morals, and an incredible devotion to the country. To Tony, he was a man who would put his identity and existence on the line for the people who mattered to him. To the world, Steve was Captain America, the hero. But Tony had seen the man, the survivor, the friend, and the broken warrior that he was. The chink in his armor didn’t detract from his appeal, his heroism; quite to the contrary, it made it more real.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“There is one more thing,” said Clint, walking into the room, not caring that he had been caught eavesdropping.
His mind was conflicted – one half of him wanted Tony to come, to talk to Tony, to hear him out and to explain to him. The other half didn’t have the courage. After everything, he felt it better to stay as far from Tony as was possible. He knew that he would have to meet him in professional settings, but he wanted that to remain the extent of it.
So many people had been lost, had been removed so cruelly from them, that it was hard for any of them to think anything but the very worst. Clint mused that perhaps he shouldn’t have insisted on his ‘time off’. It was not like his marriage with Laura was working – she hated the fact that he was an adrenaline junkie, that he needed to blood rush.
“He forgave you,” said Rhodey, as if reading Steve’s expression. “He forgave you, and he forgave Barnes. The only person he couldn’t forgive, was himself.”
His feet took him in the general direction of Steve’s room. He stopped about ten feet away from the door to the room. Taking a deep breath, he pushed open the door. What he saw was enough to break anyone’s heart.
He saw Natasha look at him curiously, but he had learnt in the last two years to hide his body language from almost everyone, including her. He had put his game face on, and it was here to stay. He knew he was no longer the leader, but when they nodded, he felt overwhelmed. He chanced a glance at Rhodey. The look Rhodey had was neither accusatory, nor judgmental; in fact, it was a deep sense of sympathy, and a touch of respect.
He couldn’t bring himself to look at the others, to see the anger, the sadness, and perhaps the accusations when he did. For how long he stared, he didn’t know. Time had lost its relevance. With Bucky gone, Steve had lost his anchor, the one who held him in one piece, the one who had helped him keep it together all through his life, whether back in his childhood, or now.
Whether it was getting into trouble at school, whether it was the beatings from the other boys down the street back at Brooklyn, it was always Bucky who grounded him, and so it was today. He was so caught up in talking that he didn’t hear the doorknob turn until the door was open, revealing a worried (and somewhat flabbergasted) Tony Stark.
He sat and cried till the tears dried out, till he had no more tears left. His breaths still came in short, harsh pants, but he no longer shed tears. And suddenly, the tears were replaced by an anger, a bubbling anger, and a sense of revenge. He wanted them to hurt, the ones who had ripped everything away from him.
“I know that Bucky…” he trailed off, bracing himself for the inevitable argument, knowing he had to do this, even at the risk of breaking the tentative truce that they had forged. “I know that Bucky was the one who killed your parents. I know the anger, I may not feel what you do, the anger, the hurt, the sorrow, but I do understand. I don’t blame you for how you reacted. I just was scared. I feared losing Buck again, especially when whatever happened was when he was not in his right mind, when he was forced into it by HYDRA.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“It isn’t easy,” murmured Rhodey, staring at the spot where T’Challa had vanished. “I know loss, I know what it is to lose one’s best friend, and I know what it is to have to put yourself back together and carry on like nothing ever happened. I also know you can do it. But you don’t have to be alone in it. I know you tend to blame yourself for things, Tony has mentioned this to me many times.”
He sank down on it, before taking a deep breath. “What has been going on with Steve?” he asked, without beating around the bush.
“Tony! Don’t go. Please?” Steve eyes were pleading. His voice shook under that careful pretense, and Tony saw right through it. He sat back down, retaking his position next to Steve. They sat in a companionable silence for a while, much to both Steve and Tony’s surprise.
But that day, something in his face told them that he wouldn’t back down, not this time – he was not going to talk. Clint sighed. He knew that only one person could make him talk who wasn’t Bucky was missing, or even perhaps dead. He hoped it was the former, but he couldn’t help fear the worst.
After long moments, they broke apart, gasping for air. A pink flush had spread over Steve’s cheeks, creeping rapidly down his neck. Tony reached over, brushing fingers over Steve’s cheeks.
“I know what you mean,” said Steve, a ghost of a smile crossing his lips. His first real one since Tony had come. “It really does seem such a small thing in the larger picture, doesn’t it? What with so many people gone.” His voice clogged up at the last word, his thoughts immediately going to the disappearing forms of Sam and Bucky.
“Tony,” he said, his tone neutral as his eyes blinked the tears back with a practiced ease. This didn’t go unmissed by Tony, who was himself the master of that particular expression, a mask of indifference and of polite curiosity.
“Anything.”
“He… is a changed man, Tony. He breathes but he isn’t exactly the epitome of lively happiness. Bucky meant much more to him than I can begin to comprehend. Their relation was something beyond what we can fathom.”
“Bucky was always there, you know?” Steve said, finally breaking the silence. “When I came back from the ice, I had resigned myself to the fact that I would never have Buck back, that he was gone, forever. Then he came back. He came back, and I thought that I could breathe freely again. And then… the way he went. It was not fair.”
He traipsed into the room that carried a placard of his name – Nat and Shuri worked fast. His bag was in there, and so was Bucky’s. His hands trailed over the top of Bucky’s bag before he threw it at the wall in a fit of anger, and his knees buckled.
“Tony!” Bruce moved faster than he had done in a long time, and reached to wrap Tony in a warm embrace. Tony hugged him back fiercely, incredibly happy to be back with his friends. One by one, they all greeted him, Rhodey hugging him tightly, cuffing him across the back of his head good-naturedly. Tasha hugged him as well, whispering an apology in his ear, which he waved off, planting a kiss to her temple.
“I need to talk to you.”
7 hours, but what seemed like a lifetime later, the buzzing of a copter was heard, and the Avengers who were assembled in the living area of the house, stiffened. Bruce and Rhodey were finding it hard to hide their smiles, in spite of the circumstances of Tony’s return. Natasha was nervous, as was expected, but she hid it well. Clint was on edge, constantly fiddling with his phone, with his arrows, generally fidgeting, but no one was in the state Steve was in.
“I promise. I will always talk to you. We will have our ups and downs, we are both stubborn, as hell, and we will fight a lot but I swear, I won’t hide from you again. I don’t want to lose one of the people who matter to me the most.”
“Hey, I came to fetch you for dinner,” he invented, his eyes belying his calm exterior. Steve tilted his head to survey Tony.
“Thank you, Legolas,” returned the scientist, the nickname slipping effortlessly past his lips. Clint’s eyes lit up at the sound of that name; he was forgiven. Tony’s eyes cast to the man who was standing in the corner, staring out of the window. He could have been a statue, save for the slight tremble in his shoulders, that he attempted to hide from the world.
His eyes had filled with tears somewhere through the middle of his monologue. He brushed at them impatiently.
“Then talk. Talk to me. You said you have forgiven me, I know I have forgiven you, but we aren’t as close as you and Tasha. Sometimes, that makes it easier to talk. I can’t talk to Rhodey very easily because I am scared, he will hurt in my hurt.”
He also felt the loss of Sam very strongly, but none compared to the pain of seeing Bucky fade into nothingness right before his eyes. He jerked when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Without looking, he knew it was Natasha. He clasped his hand above hers for a brief moment, before standing and turning to the survivors.
“Steve,” said Natasha, one day, two weeks after it had happened. Steve didn’t like to call it anything – he couldn’t believe it, he didn’t mourn it. It was just a day. ‘It’. “Steve, you have to let go. You have to talk to someone about your gr- “
Bruce, Thor and Rhodey had teamed up, sort of. They did stuff together, ate, talked, watched movies (after all, Thor had to be educated in Midgardian concepts) – Rhodey also found that Thor was a good listener, especially in grief. But he, himself had not let himself talk. Natasha, Bruce, they had both attempted to.
It was a single second. One second in which his life spun on its head. One second, when he saw it all end – his hopes, his life, his optimism, everything. It was replaced by a melancholy, a void that would not be filled. It hurt to breathe, it hurt to live. But he couldn’t end it. Some would say he was too brave to end it, but he knew that this was not some misplaced sense of bravery – it was simply the tiny, minuscule hope, that the one he lived for, would still be around somewhere.
The effect was immediate. Nat’s eyebrows rose high up her forehead, Thor’s amused expression melted into one of confusion and then into something more somber. Rhodey’s face crumpled as the fear melted away – Tony was alive. Clint inhaled sharply, and in the silence that seemed way too loud. A second later, the glass slipped from between Steve’s fingers, shattering into a thousand pieces.
“Never hide anything from me, again. I would never be able to handle this once more.”
Clutching Bucky’s bag to his chest, Steve was talking to it. It had become a daily ritual to him – to talk into thin air, addressing Bucky while holding his bag. Many might call him crazy, but it grounded him, as only Bucky could.
“Don’t. Say. His. Name.” Steve felt the emotions in him well up at the mention of Tony.
“Bucky wouldn’t have wanted you to shut away,” she pointed out. He snorted.
His hands shook as he opened the top compartment of his bag, and drew out a photograph. It was one that Clint had taken on the sly, of Tony cracking a joke and Steve laughing, his head thrown back, the laughter lines etched on his face, as his eyes danced in mirth. His hands traced the image of a smug, but somehow extremely happy Tony, who was watching as he laughed.
A broken sob escaped his lips, and it was like a dam broke. Hands clutched at the bag that had lain so innocently on the floor, sobs shaking his body, as he held the only remains of his best friend close to his chest.
“What do you mean?” she asked, sinking into the other chair, tilting her head at him in curiosity.
Tony sat back in his chair as he contemplated this. It was hard to believe that, but it made sense. Didn’t it hurt the trust the most when he found out about Barnes? Why? Because he had trusted Steve above most. Steve had never lied to protect him, so he didn’t get the need this time. He had always given as good as he had got, and that alone in Tony’s eyes had given him a position few others had earned.
“No, no, this is big,” said Bruce, his expression alight with excitement and anticipation. “The call was from Tony.”
He stared down at his hands. He couldn’t bring himself to look up at Tony, and see the anger, the hurt, the tears he had seen back in Siberia, when they had faced-off. He couldn’t see all the emotion he had put there, the fragments of the trust and respect they’d once had.
The others began moving to follow his orders, but Rhodey hung back. Steve opened his mouth to tell him something, to ask him, perhaps, but no words came out. He snapped his mouth shut, and exchanged his blank expression to one of polite questioning.
Three months later, he decided he had had enough. He walked to Tasha’s room, and waited for her to let him in. He entered when she did, stopping at the doorway.
“I have nothing to talk about, Tasha,” he said, not quite hostile, but the gentle politeness of earlier lacking from his tone. “I have plans to make and places to be, there is no time for idle talk.”
Clint took the time to observe him. His eyes were empty of any emotion, his skin was pale, and his face had a perpetual frown. The smile he had ready was nowhere in sight. This was not the Steve they knew and loved. This was the shadow of a man they had all once known.
Work, Steve decided, was the best way to drown one’s sorrows. Work, it worked better than alcohol, than drugs or any other stupid addiction. It gave him direction – a way to avenge his loved ones, but at the same time, didn’t give him time to think about them, about how them leaving had left a deep void in him that wouldn’t be filled.
He was cut off by warm lips covering his own in a sweet, chaste kiss that was cut off when Steve murmured – “It’s as real for me as it is for you. I really want to give us a chance, Tony. It’s been so long, I’ve wanted to do that since forever.”
Steve looked at him with an expression that was both confused and respectful. “You’ve spent a lot of time thinking.”
“Thanos has had his say,” he said, his voice sounding detached, even to himself. “We will have ours. The time for being passive is past, now is when we avenge. We aren’t called the Avengers for nothing. Natasha, get in touch with Clint, I want him here, no matter what. Bruce, see what you can do about a rescue mission, team up with Rhodey. Thor, I know that Asgardians will not help us, but I still need you to see what you can do about it.”
He had wanted to try for the kids, but then a confession he had made to Laura had thrown that out of the window – they were filing for divorce, and he had had to settle for visitation rights, because he knew full custody with the kind of life he had, was not possible. He was happy that she had at least not cut him out of their lives.
Steve stared for a moment as Rhodey walked off. Shaking it off, he himself walked to the wreckage that was earlier a grand building. Natasha was rapidly organizing living quarters for all, considering that most of them were wrecked.
“No one knew Bucky like I do, Tasha,” he said, a touch testily. He couldn’t talk about Bucky, it was too raw, the pain. Watching him tear apart silently hurt them all, especially Natasha, who had been by his side in the two years that he had been running.
“First floor, back, right,” said Nat, narrowing her gaze. Steve never forgot details; after the serum, it never happened. So why all of a sudden? She opened her mouth to ask, but Steve had spun away, and was almost out the door by then.
The anger in him was too precious, to intimate to share. He trusted them, Nat, Bruce, Thor, Clint, hell, he even trusted Rhodey with it, but he couldn’t. He sat there on the floor, clutching the bag as if he hoped Bucky would suddenly spring from it, saying ‘Hey, punk’.
“Dinner? At 6?” asked Steve, his eyebrows rising challengingly.
“Would you stop watching me?” an amused voice cut through his musings. He looked up in shock to see Steve wearing a deeply amused expression, but the smile on his face didn’t reach his eyes. He shook his head and smiled sheepishly at Steve. He opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted when the door to the kitchen opened with an almighty crash.
“That makes no sense. The Accords, Barnes, after all that, he won’t even want to be near me, leave along trust me. The whole idea is preposterous.”
“Steve,” she said, nodding at him. “First floor, back right. Go on, get cleaned up. I’ve spoken to Clint, he will be here in 12 hours, Fury is MIA but he dropped off his pager, Clint is bringing it with him, to see if something can be done with it.”
Everyone turned to him. His face was paler, more drawn than usual, his eyes held a deep emotion, unidentifiable, something that had been missing in the last few months that they had been in Wakanda. Ignoring the shards of glass at his feet, he trudged up to his room, his movements almost robot like. At the door, Tasha grabbed his hand to stop him.
“Talk,” she said, indicating the chair next to the bed.
He sighed as he turned the coffee mug in his hands idly. It was still early in the day, but he wasn’t able to sleep. Nightmares shook him in the night, and he found himself unable to stave them off. As he was on his third cup of coffee, Steve returned to the house from his morning run. He poured himself a glass of water, nodding a greeting at Clint, and sat at the island, his hands moving fast over the phone in his hand.
He waved his phone at them. “I received a phone call,” he said, his voice shaking with suppressed excitement.
Eventually he stepped out, knowing he couldn’t put the inevitable off for too long. His hadn’t shaved in two years and he didn’t feel the need to do it now. Rubbing his hair dry, he pulled on a flannel and khakis, the only part of him that felt like the old Steve.
It wasn’t a question. It was a statement, a matter of fact statement. Tony tilted his head. “I haven’t had a lot to do but think in the last couple of years,” he said, his tone suddenly closed off. “If you are sure you don’t want to come, I will just- “ He rose as if to leave, but Steve suddenly reached out to grab his wrist.
