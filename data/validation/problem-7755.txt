The despair in Steve's voice was so palpable that it felt almost suffocating, smothering Tony like the bags the Ten Rings had used to cover his head in Afghanistan. Tony gasped, forcibly stamping that horrible demon down, deep into the recesses of his memory where it belonged.

"Have you ever heard of Project Rebirth?"
"In an emergency, yes, Captain, I can," snapped Dr Strange. "But seeing as how I have had the ability to do so for the better part of a year now and have not made any such attempt, then suffice it to say that I only use these powers when absolutely necessary. Such as right now."
pull something as stupid as that again, you hear me?" Tony said as he yanked Steve to him, his mouth kissing and nipping all across Steve's pecs and collarbones as his blunt fingernails scraped lightly across Steve's back. "What if your buddy Bucky hadn't been up there with you, hmm? What if he hadn't realised that you weren't right and you ended up getting shot down?" He sucked in a deep breath, pulling back to stare into Steve's eyes, the sight of his mussed hair and kiss-swollen lips almost too beautiful to behold. "You've got me hooked on you now, okay? And you've got Pete to think about too, and neither of us can afford to lose you."
"Shh, mo grá," Steve whispered as he pressed his fingertips into Tony's scalp. "It's okay, sweetheart. It was only a bad dream."
"Yeah, just give me a minute," Tony muttered as he started digging through the kitchen's various junk drawers. "'Cause unless you want this thing signed with one of your papa's paintbrushes, that means I've got to find a pen."
"Yes, sir," Steve said firmly. After almost ten years in the Air Corps Steve was well-used to Colonel Phillips's warnings. And his tendency towards hyperbole.
The woman gave an almost mechanical nod as she pressed her right palm against Steve's window, filling the cell with the bright red light that he realised a second too late meant that his mind was about to get even more scrambled.
"Yep!" Peter called. "I'm already on it!"
Mopping his eyes on his soaked-through t-shirt, Tony pushed himself up to a sitting position.  His bleary-eyed glancing about eventually fell onto his monitor, and the schematic of the new defibrillator machine he had been working on.  After the incredible success of the pharmaceutical printers, Tony had, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical scientists, decided to focus next on developing a new type of defibrillator that didn't require a separate power source.  Expanding on a technology that he had discovered in some of Howard’s old files, Tony was working on developing an innovative power source that theoretically could power a device the size of a portable defibrillator for about fifty years.
“Yeah, Miss Potts.  Ah… would you mind coming down here for a sec?  Don't worry about knocking.”
The news, of course, had been a frenzy of activity, with various reporters and so-called "experts" still discussing the sudden appearance of the first spaceship over New York City—and its subsequent sudden disappearance—as well as the unexplained space phenomenon that was recorded over Africa approximately twenty hours later. Tony and Bruce had both theorised that the phenomenon in question had been caused by the collapse of Thanos' wormhole, which, thanks to the protective shield that encased Wakanda from the rest of the world, had been the only visible evidence of the battle.
Uncle Bucky was quiet for several heartbeats, his head hung so that his cheekbone-length hair covered quite a bit of his face. He hadn't gotten a haircut since his accident, and Peter had to admit that he kinda liked Uncle Bucky's longer hair. It made him look fierce. Almost dangerous, in a cool kind of way.
"No, I can't," Steve answered. He gripped Tony's hands even tighter, as if he was afraid they would be ripped away from him. "It's just a feeling that I have, one that I've had for awhile now. At first I thought it would be okay if we just had Bucky and Sam watch over him for us, but now… I thought about this during my entire patrol this afternoon, and I'm—I would just feel a lot better if Peter was away from the hospital. He's just way too vulnerable in that room all by himself."
"Your Highness, we believe that we may have some information regarding the recent phenomenon that might help to shed some more light on its possible origin," he began. "However, in order to corroborate this information, there are a few questions that we would greatly appreciate answers to, if you don't mind."
Tony thought as he tapped commands into his workstation with trembling hands.
It was that reason—amongst a few others that Peter didn't really enjoy discussing—that had led to Dad and Papa's decision to keep Peter out of school until the beginning of the new calendar year, rather than send him back at the beginning of the school year. Not only were they still getting daily phone calls from reporters and news agencies asking to interview Peter a whole nine weeks after Papa's safe return from space, Dad and Papa also wanted to make sure that Peter had as much of a handle on his new abilities as possible before he was put into what they were calling "a potentially stressful situation". While Papa's super strength was no longer much of a secret, Peter's dads wanted to ensure that his own enhancements remained a secret for as long as possible, which meant that Peter actually had to practise how to act normal.
"No, buddy," he finally said. "No, I can't."
It would be dangerous, and Peter would have to figure out how in the hell he'd be able to get away from his family long enough to make the trip. But if it meant that he would be able to find his papa and expose the rest of HYDRA for all the world to see, then it would be more than worth the risk.
I love you so much."
As the ship touched down not too far from the Compound's training dome, Nebula appeared behind Tony's chair, reaching for him before he could utter a word of protest. He wanted to ask if Gamora had made it, but then decided against it. He could vaguely remember Nebula mentioning something about Gamora being enhanced, as an explanation as to why she didn't require as much food as Tony. Thanos had enhanced her, just like he had pulled Nebula apart and then put her back together, piece by piece.
It takes a second or three, but finally Tony rolls his eyes, the exact reaction that Steve was hoping for.
"You are most welcome. Have a wonderful day at school."
As soon as Peter had disappeared down the hallway, Tony slumped down onto the couch, leaning back and closing his eyes.
"Then I highly suggest that you get your asses plunked down into your aircraft! Now!"
None of that mattered now, though. Peter was back, Thanos and his multiverse of armies were nothing more than ashes scattered across the cosmos, and Steve's glorious hands were busy gripping Tony's ass, his long fingers kneading his flesh like pizza dough.
All of which was probably just a cover for Peter wanting to sit on a hard school bus bench seat and hold his girlfriend's hand, out from under the prying eyes of his father.
Unfortunately, figuring it out would likely require putting all three of them through a massive barrage of tests, which was something that Tony knew he could never bring himself to do. Steve still spoke bitterly about his time of being treated as a human lab rat following his serum procedure, and there was no way that Tony would ever make him go through something like that again. And Bucky had already been experimented on enough for three lifetimes, and Peter… well… that was just a hard no.
Fury tilted his head, giving Tony his
Inhaling a deep breath, Steve gently knocked on the door.
"Uh huh!" Peter said as he continued his climb up the side of the spinning ship, desperately searching for another door to get inside. His head was already starting to swim, his lungs contracting as they struggled to breathe in the rapidly thinning air. Hypoxia was only seconds away, and if he fell…
"'Night."
"Peter told me you had another emergency call with Damage Control this afternoon," Steve said softly as he kissed Tony's cheek. "What's going on with them now?"
Another ear-splitting explosion caused him to jump, his arm instinctively pushing the stick to the right and almost directly into the biggest fireball that Steve had ever seen.
"We actually believe that it'll unlock all of them eventually," said Bruce. "But unfortunately, this Bible had a rather tenuous history with the translation that caused it to be delayed for over fifty years, and during that time there were several changes in both dialect and the people who were in charge of actually translating it, so—"
"Yes, sir," Steve said firmly. "As I said, I am ready to resume my duties."
Although apparently not enough to stop breaking his goddamn bones, as Tony would say.
"I'm afraid I don't have much more to tell you," he began. "I just put Hill and three other trusted agents on a plane about fifteen minutes ago, so hopefully once they get on the ground out there we can get some more concrete information."
Especially since some of the corporations seemed to be nothing but shells for other corporations, based on Tony's research. Unfortunately, nothing that they had been able to uncover so far had been able to crack those shells, leaving both Tony and Steve extremely frustrated.
"Steve, Pete is fine, I asked JARVIS to check on him on my way up here," Tony assured him. "And just because Beck was using this drug doesn't mean that—"
"You're looking a little pale there, Prince Peter," Flash Thompson sneered as he slid into his seat behind Peter. "You see another ghost or something in the hallway?"
"Pardon me, sir, but we're getting ready to close down," he said. "Blackout starts in forty-five minutes."
"I'm pretty sure the entire neighbourhood just heard you," Gwen said with a frown. "And I was just helping Peter pack up his books."
Tony chuckled. "Well, I guess it's a good thing I didn't have any other plans in the morning." It wasn't actually the truth. He'd been planning on working on the new nanotech suit he'd been building ever since their return to the Tower at the end of August, but he supposed that could wait long enough for him and Bruce to have a good look-see at whatever data Fury's scientists happened to have.
Peter nodded miserably, his hands twisting in his lap as he proceeded to tell Tony that he had been secretly decoding their HYDRA files in his room at night ever since he had discovered the bill containing the Registration Act. It was all Tony could do to stay quiet while Peter explained what he had uncovered, his fingers wrapped so tightly around his left forearm that he could feel bruises forming.
Tony gave a curt nod as the various senators disappeared from his monitor, rolling his eyes once the screen finally went black.
"Tony, I'm so close," Steve said as his strokes grew more erratic, his sharp breaths even hotter as he gripped Tony's hip to the point of bruising. "Oh God, Tony, I'm gonna, I'm gonna—!"
"'It is your duty to obey!'" Natasha said. "Steve, that guy sounds pretty shocked, I doubt this has ever happened before."
"I just figured that she'd've gotten a job already," said Steve. "She's gotta make a living now, doesn't she?"
"No, no, I won't," said Uncle Bruce. "Hey, you take it easy, okay? I'm gonna give you back to your dad now."
"No, it's not," Uncle Bucky said, so softly that Peter barely heard him. He let out a heavy sigh, a single tear rolling down his right cheek that he quickly swiped away. "Sam's the best of the best. There's no way I could do better than him."
"Here we are, young man," Grandma said as she set the fully-loaded breakfast tray down onto the bedside table. She sat down next to him, warming the bell of her stethoscope in her palm. "Let's see what you sound like first, shall we?"
"Yeah, well, you look like hell too, only I wasn't gonna say anything," Tony snapped, regretting his harsh words almost instantly when Steve's shoulders sagged. "No, honey, I didn't—I didn't mean it like that."
Steve nodded, moaning softly when Tony dug his fingertips into his scalp. Like Peter, Steve absolutely loved getting his head rubbed.
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. It was still hard for him to imagine Steve—
"Hey," Steve whispered. He slid his fingers under Tony's chin, tilting his head up to look at him. "We don't have to go out to dinner or anything, we could just have one of our old dessert dates out on the landing pad or something. Just a small celebration is all I'm asking."
But now wasn't the time. Peter had literally just been nearly strangled to death, and by the most powerful creature in the entire universe, even, according to Uncle Bruce, which meant that the gauge on Dad's freakout-o-metre was still all the way over in the
Peter chuckled as he pulled on his seatbelt.  “It’s so funny that neither of you can see it when it’s so obvious.  Good thing I can.”
Peter shrugged.  “‘Cause when I was in there, I noticed that his hands were shaking a bit.  And whenever he moved, he did it really slowly, like it hurt him.  So I just thought—”
"Why didn't you tell me that Howard Stark was involved with Project Rebirth?" he blurted out, immediately clenching his fists at his sides. Leeway or not, Phillips was still Steve's commanding officer, and lower ranking officers weren't exactly supposed to demand things from their superiors.
"Eh. I'm not as bad as I seem," Bucky said as they got to their feet. "Just don't tell anyone, okay?"
Thankfully, it didn't take long for Tony's body to relax and his breathing to even out. Letting out a slow sigh of relief, Steve pressed another kiss to the top of Tony's head and closed his eyes, willing himself to think of something—anything—else besides his fateful flight into the ice.
"Yeah, yeah, sure," muttered Clint. "Just so long as you keep all your clothes on, yeah?" He pointed his completed arrow towards Steve's tablet. "We good to go?"
"Very well, Captain," JARVIS said warily, prompting Steve to frown at the ceiling.
Earth was being invaded.
"Oh, shut up, mister goody two-shoes," Bucky said as he tossed a bit of roll at Steve's face. "And hey. Where the hell were you this afternoon, anyway? Sam and I were looking for ya."
"No, I'm not," Steve answered. "From the looks of things you and your dad are gonna have us pretty well prepared, so I don't see what there is to be afraid of. I'm actually pretty excited."
Tony nodded, leaning against Steve’s arm, and smiling as he wrapped it around his shoulders.  He’d never called Peter an angel before, but now that he thought about it, it certainly seemed to fit him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, he's breathing," Steve answered, watching Peter's chest as it rose and fell with his shallow, gurgling breaths. "But he's not—he won't wake up, Tony—he won't—he's not waking up, and—"
"Yeah, Pete, I see him," Dad grumbled. "Dude should've stayed dead."
"Well… yeah," Ned admitted. "But I'm sure I could see it just as easily in Hawaii."
was boisterous."
But then again, Barnes, or rather, the Winter Soldier, not only killed Tony's parents in cold blood, but almost managed to kill Steve twice
He would make them both proud.
“Mmm!” he mumbled as his eyes fluttered open, sounding so much like Peter that Steve couldn't help but smile.  “‘M not done yet!”
"Fine, fine," Peter said with a sigh. "He's been coming pretty much every day. Around mid-morning."
"Spider-Man? Why'd your dad name you Spider-Man? Does he not like you or something?"
"I will, Papa, don't worry," Peter said softly, blinking back the tears threatening to drop. He sniffed, swiping at his nose as he snuck a glance at his beloved papa, trying everything in his power to not think about the possibility of never seeing him again, and only thinking about nothing else.
"Talk to me, honey, please," Tony whispered as he brushed Steve's sweaty hair off his forehead. "Trying to bottle it all up inside never works, you know that."
"No, probably not. Uncle Clint doesn't mind the fights either, but he likes watching football over hockey anyway. We tried taking him to a baseball game once and he fell asleep."
Even if that meant playing puppet to a Langaran military government who seemed to be absolutely hell-bent on continuing to punish Howard Stark through his son, despite their own admittance that none of their own scientists or engineers could even come close to what Tony could offer them.
"What the?" he heard Quill ask, slowly turning his head towards him. Quill's expression hadn't swayed too far from the
But before he could even finish his sentence, Dad disappeared with a soft popping noise, so abruptly that Peter stumbled forward, barely able to keep himself from tipping over.
"Yikes," Peter said, wincing. "That must've been scary."
"That's the thing, I don't know!" exclaimed Scott. He bit off part of his final sandwich half, washing it down with a big gulp of water. "Hank didn't really explain it to me much before I went in there, so I don't really know how it works. All I know is that I got stuck inside 'cause Hope disappeared, but once I did get out, to me only ten minutes had passed." He held out his arm, letting it flop to his side. "So you can imagine that I was just a little freaked out when I noticed how different everything was, and everything that had happened. I mean, Hope was gone, Hank and his wife were both gone, my own daughter was almost a whole year older
"I guess we're just good at keeping you on your toes, right Sam?" Papa said. "Don't want anyone getting bored, do we?"
But Steve knows it’s only a matter of time before somebody does.  And when that happens, and his name is no longer mentioned even in passing… then he supposes he’ll just fade into obscurity, like so many other washed-up Olympic athletes.
"Well, I thought it was kinda funny," Peter answered. "Apparently in the eighteenth century doctors didn't know how to treat hernias, especially inguinal hernias, so they somehow came up with the idea that shooting tobacco smoke up the affected person's rectum would somehow cure the hernia."
"Oh shit, baby," Tony groaned as he clenched down hard around Steve, his fingernails digging into the hard muscles of Steve's shoulder. "I can't—I'm gonna—
"Okay, I want you to just stop, like right now, 'cause we're not going there again," said Tony. "Whatever's going on with these semi-enhanced… whatever-the-hell they are is not your fault. I know it, Pete knows it, and the rest of the team knows it. And you're not only a good man, you're the best person that I've ever known. And I'm a genius, so I know what I'm talking about."
Arriving back in the kitchen, Steve was pleased to find that not only had Peter started heating up the chicken broth, he had also begun prepping the chicken. Steve had explained to him once they started grocery shopping together that he and his ma had always used chicken thighs for their soups and stews since they were both less expensive than chicken breasts and had more nutrients.
"I'm gonna keep working on it, Dad," Peter said firmly. "I've already written a whole bunch of new code today, so—"
Gwen took a step forward, her expression morphing into sympathy as she placed her hand on Peter's arm. "I
"Yeah," agreed Tony. "So…?"
, it's still time for you to go to bed."
"That's right. He does not," Steve said, and
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
"That's 'cause we know that we've always got each other's back, Pete," answered Tony. "And so far these guys seem like they're just a bunch of live wires waiting to spark, so…" He huffed out a sharp breath. "But, yeah, I guess they're who we're stuck with for the time being."
"Yeah, I know, but—" He huffed out a sharp breath, taking hold of Gwen's hands. "Look, this—this is gonna be huge, Gwen, okay? Bigger than the Battle of New York, so… my dads, they're gonna need my help. I need to go help them."
Still, Tony supposed that he had to try. Had to at least make the effort to try and return to his husband, like he had been so gung-ho about before everything went to shit.
But now it all seemed like a moot point.
looks.
"Yeah, especially since everyone else is waiting in the living room so they can gawk at you." Tony clapped Peter on the shoulder, giving it a slight squeeze. "C'mon Casanova, let's not keep the lady waiting."
“Ha ha, very funny.”  Tossing a furtive glance over her shoulder, Natasha downs the rest of the tea in her mug and leans closer.  “The article I read said that Tony Stark parted ways with his father thirteen years ago.”
"Okay, but that looks like a micro-universe," Bruce said with a confused shrug. "Just like Scott said."
The whole thing was like something out of some old spy novel, the likes of which Tony would’ve probably never come across if he hadn’t met a tall, blond, and exceptionally handsome guy who just happened to own a bookstore.
"Yeah, it pretty much was," agreed Tony. He pressed his fist to his chest, right over his heart. "And his little head was right here, close enough for me to kiss him, and he just snuggled right in with his little face tilted up towards me, sucking on his thumb while the rest of his tiny fingers held onto my shirt. At first I was too scared to even move, thinking I'd wake him up again the second I tried to do anything besides just stand there, but after an hour or so I finally chanced it and sat down on the chair in his room. I'd say I was out less than thirty seconds after that."
He found Peter in the kitchen working through his third bowl of soup, with the makings for an entire fresh pot already arranged on the stove and countertops.
something hidden in the treeline along the side of the lake right before Pete got pulled under, so how in the
Fury scoffed, letting out a morbid chuckle.  “Heh.  Yeah, I guess so.”  Then he steepled his fingers under his chin, suddenly aging about ten years in less than a second.  “Tony, I can’t tell you not to go.  But please, as an old man who cares very much about you, don’t just try and wing this, okay?  We’re uncovering new information almost by the second here, and none of it’s good, which leads me to believe that Rogers’ kidnapping has been in the works for a long time.  And because of that, I don't think they’re gonna make it easy for anyone to get him out.”
"Ego was also a planet," added Mr Clean. "Until we destroyed him."
"We are indeed, sir."
, so…"
"Yeah, don't I know it," Steve said with a wink. Then he tugged on Tony's hand, pulling him back against the far wall as Howard called for everyone's attention.
"Uh huh. Miss you guys too," replied Peter. "Have you found anything interesting?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forgot to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"The Planck Scale? Yep," answered Tony. He turned to Scott. "Which means that when Pete and I were messing around with these things, we chose to chalk that part up to Pym being nothing but a delusional old man and then ignored it."
The sound of a clearing throat broke them apart, and Steve looked up to see Clint, smirking in the doorway of the jet as he fiddled with one of his arrowheads.
But the one time that Tony had attempted to show Steve what Rhodey had sent him, Steve practically hit the roof, telling Tony over and over that he could handle himself just fine, and didn't need anyone to help him.
Steve huffed, tipping his head back as his heart migrated from where it had lodged in his throat back down to where it belonged. Out of the entire set of mission parameters that Tony had given them, the re-entry aspect was the only part that had truly frightened him.
Tony circled around the hologram, dragging his palm down his face as he attempted to force his fried brain to figure out where in the hell the thing was going wrong.  He’d been at it for hours, ever since he’d tucked Peter into bed, and yet, three and a half pots of coffee later he was still stuck on the same goddamn problem.
He and Ma had been in that store before a bunch of times, as Ma did most of her usual shopping there. But that was the first time that Steve would be shopping for something so…
"Yes, it does," Steve said, clearing his throat. He chugged down the rest of his drink, the blue stuff that reminded Tony of that goofy alien booze from one of Peter's favourite television shows. "So your father never spoke to you about it?"
"We have a dedicated physician on her way here just for Peter, Miss Stacy, so there's no need to worry about him getting adequate medical care," Dad said tersely as Peter scrabbled futility for a handhold on his armour, trying to make himself as small as possible. All he wanted at the moment was to go home, away from the smoke, away from the fire demon, away from those horrible words trying to overpower his mind.
“A single gunshot,” Peter murmured, tapping the eraser of his pencil on his keyboard.  “Witnesses insist that it began as a single gunshot… JARVIS, this has to be it!  This has to be what caused the explosion that hurt Steve’s friend!”
"Yes, sir?"
"Not too close to the front, though, all right?" said Bucky. "Only nerds sit in the front row."
"Goddamnit, Rogers! Just tell me his name!"
Thank you so much for all of the kudos and kind comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!  💖
"Anthony Stark is a civilian scientist working for the Air Corps," Steve said through clenched teeth. "He graduated with top honours from Langara's finest university, and is responsible for the design of both the X-301 and X-302 aircrafts. He has also been conducting classes and simulations with the six Air Corps test pilots in preparation for the X-302 space-faring missions."
"All hostiles have been accounted for, Captain," he said. "This now concludes the training session."
"Steve Rogers," Steve said with a nod, gesturing towards Bruce and James. "And this is Dr Bruce Banner and Colonel James Rhodes. They're the ones who found the pager in D.C."
😭 = I got you right in the feels
A knot rises in Steve’s throat.
"Tony! Sweetheart, please, you don't have to do this!" he pleaded. "They've got you under some kind of mind-control, let me help—!"
Steve chuckled as he clapped his hand on his son's shoulder. "That's better," he said. "And when you're done, you can help me make you some scrambled eggs and pancakes, hmm?"
Steve gave a stuttered nod.  “Y-yeah,” he whispered.  “Okay.”
"Well…" Steve trailed off as he stirred the cinnamon and honey into the hot tea. To say that he was appalled when he'd learned how much modern medicines tended to cost in the twenty-first century would be an understatement. His own ma had had enough trouble trying to afford the medicines he'd needed so often as a child, he couldn't imagine what they would've done if the prices had been anywhere close to as high as they were now.
"Loving someone," answered Ma. "Or, two someones, in your case."
But Steve couldn't even bring himself to answer. It was like he'd been caught in some kind of energy shield, unable to even speak as he watched the enemy fly closer, and closer, and closer…
He had already tried punching through the glass wall of his cell, badly bruising his knuckles in the process when the wall didn't budge in the slightest. It obviously wasn't glass, but as to what it could possibly be Peter had no idea. He only knew that he had to get out of there.
"Yeah, okay," Steve said. He hurried over to Peter's side, planting a gentle kiss on his clammy forehead. "I love you, little guy. You sleep good, okay?"
Regardless, Steve figured it was better to be safe than sorry.
They ended up working late into the night, until Peter's eyelids grew so heavy that he could no longer keep them open and Tony insisted that they needed to let him get some sleep. By the time he and Tony had tucked Peter into bed and kissed him goodnight it was well after 2300 hours, and while the almost overwhelming anguish that had been hanging across Steve's shoulders like a lead veil ever since that morning had lessened a bit, his heart was still heavy with worry.
"That means you can't anticipate, and if you can't anticipate, you can't plan," Tony finished.
Raking his fingers through his sweat-dampened hair, Steve carefully laid back down next to Tony, draping his arm across his husband's waist and tucking himself up behind him. Then he buried his nose into the nape of Tony's neck, struggling to keep his roiling emotions in check. While it wasn't unheard of for Steve to occasionally revisit his flight on the
"Maybe," answered the woman. "But first I want to know how you people came to have it."
"They are all gone," Mantis said sadly, shaking her head as her antennae curled downwards. "This must mean that Thanos has won."
Which also meant that Peter absolutely could
Another long silence stretched across the room, broken only by the steady
"Okay, but then what?" asked Steve, obviously dreading the answer.
Peter gave a nod as he bit off part of another meatball. "Okay. I'll ask them."
"Uh huh," Peter murmured. "Are you guys gonna come again tomorrow?"
Tony shrugged, removing his glasses. "Your eyes are better than mine, buddy."
"Oh my God," Steve whispered, his hand clutching Tony's to the point of pain. "This Thanos… he killed Thor?"
"Yeah, Dad, I'm sure," Peter said with a frown. "Gwen's going."
"Sure," answered Peter. "Sounds good."
“Oh, wow!” Natasha exclaims.  “He’s that good, hmm?”
"Well, I think it's an absolutely fantastic idea, so let's do it."
"Goddamnit Steve, get the hell out of here!"
Peter gave an uncertain nod. "Okay."
"Pete, we can't worry about that now, yeah?" Dad warned. "Just try and stay focused on what we're doing."
😣 = the angst is killing me!
"And you knew he was yours right away, didn't you?" Steve asked. "As soon as you saw him?"
"What's going on in here?" Peter said as he suddenly appeared in the doorway, rubbing his eyes. Tony immediately launched himself at him, nearly knocking Steve over in his haste to reach the son that he loved beyond all logic or reason. Thankfully Steve recovered quickly, steadying Tony just enough to keep him from tripping as he stumbled over to Peter, pulling him into his arms.
He also seemed to be a bit more relaxed, with his eyes brighter behind his glasses and his shoulders less stiff, like something heavy had been lifted from them.
Peter smiled, a wide, bright smile that was so infectious that Steve couldn't help but smile back.
"Power is at one thousand percent of capacity, sir," said JARVIS.
"Oh, I definitely can," Peter said proudly. "In fact, Pietro and I were working on a new training algorithm that was gonna use some of these—"
"Okay, so give me the worst-case here," he said gently.
"So instead of accepting whatever mission HYDRA tried to give him, he just shuts down instead," Steve said in a rush, tears welling in his blue eyes. "Oh my God, Tony. He's only a child, and yet he's just so strong! They were using Loki's sceptre on him, and he was still able to resist it!"
"Really?" Ned said, his face lighting up so much that Peter felt a stab of guilt. Ned had been his best friend since elementary school, but ever since he and Gwen got together, he had been spending most of his limited free time with her. It had been fine when Ned was dating their classmate Betty, but apparently they decided to take a so-called "break" once the school year started and never ended up getting back together. At least, if the fact that Peter never saw Betty too far away from Brad Davis had anything to do with it."
"What the goddamn hell is he doing here?" shrieked Tony. Rage flooded his body as he pointed an accusing finger at the man who in his mind was completely responsible for Peter's deterioration. "This is all his fault, Colonel, so if you think that now's the time for some goddamn reconciliation or something, then you're out of your goddamn mind!"

—as she sat next to a nearby pile of rubble, clutching handfuls of ashes to her chest.
"Sure thing, buddy," answered Tony. He shot Steve one more furtive glance, delighting in the sly wink that Steve shot right back at him as he gave Peter's life jacket a quick once-over.

More than
"Yeah, yeah, don't go crying too hard on me now, Falcon, I'll wait for ya," Tony said. "Geez, you'd think you'd be happy with your new pack upgrade, but no, you always gotta be giving me the grabby hands. There's only one of me, you know."
"You're wearing the ring?" he asked, so boyishly tentative that Tony couldn't help but chuckle.
Like anyone would actually want to date him, the fucking mess that he is.
As they damn well should be, for all of the hundreds of levels of hell they had endured in order to get there.
"No, we know that, little guy," Steve said thickly. His heart was beating a bit faster than usual too, Tony could tell. "It's just… something that Dad and I aren't quite used to yet."
Dr Strange shot Dad a questioning look. "This plan of yours relies on the element of surprise, does it not?"
"Oh hell, not this again!" Peter said as the monster swung again, this time aiming for Peter's abdomen. Peter jumped back barely avoiding the blow and launching another web even as he realised that it would probably be useless.
Loki notwithstanding, of course.
And then the whole scene dissolved, leaving only reality behind.
"Whoa there, buddy!" Tony said as he jumped back. "You gotta give me some warning here!"
Eight days.
"Time to hustle, Pete!" Dad called from the living room. "The Dad Taxi's leaving!"
Unfortunately, it seemed as though only a few seconds had passed before Steve jerked awake again, this time barely managing to catch his gasp of anguish before it pulled from his throat.  The pain was even worse now, like a million tiny knives stabbing him from all directions, while his head felt like someone had taken an ice pick to his temples.  His knuckles were also throbbing in time with his heartbeat, as if he’d been forced to punch a solid brick wall multiple times.
cried Cam, pumping his fist into the air. "You tell 'em, Cap!"
"General O'Brien doesn't scare me, Tony," Steve said. "And I promise I'm not going to do anything that would put you or Peter in danger."
"I'm sorry, I'm afraid that I don't know your name, but can you help me get out of here?"
"Yeah, yeah, nevermind," Peter mumbled into his pillow, sorry that he'd brought it up in the first place. "Could you turn on the rain sounds, please?"
"So you're saying that the Meridians might have a spy?" Papa asked.
"Whoa!" Peter said in amazement. "So he can get big too?"
“Well, I don't know,” Tony said, shrugging.  “You're just acting kinda… odd.”
," Scott answered. "Or maybe
Steve nodded, banking hard to the right as another barrage of gunfire flashed by. "Copy that."
“Steve, it’s okay if you wanna kiss me,” Tony murmured as his hands came to rest on Steve’s biceps.  “I—”
"But not critical," Tony said with a frown. He drew in another raspy breath, clutching his abdomen as another coughing fit hit him. "Which means I'll be fine in a couple of days, just like I said."
"Tell him Steve will be out in a minute, J," interrupted Tony. He shot Steve a rather pointed look. "'Cause I'm
"I know you do." Peter brought Gwen's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it. "It's just… right now I really don't wanna think about it. I'd—I'd rather just watch the movie with you and forget about everything else." Peter knew Uncle Sam would be shaking his head in frustration if he'd heard him just now, but since Uncle Sam wasn't there, then he didn't need to know.
And like a fool, Tony had listened to him.
"You mean the Iron Legion?" Steve asked, sniffing.
“Well… we were searching for the Tesseract, yeah?” Tony asks.
Laying back onto the freezing cement floor, Steve closes his eyes, trying to concentrate on Tony’s footsteps.  The rhythmic
"Two of us," Tony said into Steve's chest. "Gods, that's something I never thought I'd hear."
“Oh God, T-Tony, I’m not—I need—” Steve stammered as he raked his fingers through his hair.  “Tony, I—I can’t—I need—I need you to—”
plan. Did you hear me? This was the boyfriend's plan!"
Pulling out of the crevasse, Joseph grinned as he guided the aircraft back up, preparing to complete his turn around the mountain when he caught sight of something odd out of the corner of his eye.
Pursing his lips, Steve rips the label off his juice bottle and balls it up, launching it at Natasha’s head as she skips giggling back to her desk.  Then he hefts himself up from his chair and retrieves the label, tossing it and the bottle into the recycling bin.  Once back at his desk, Steve opens up the Nike grant file and starts scanning its cover letter for typos, shaking his head about thirty seconds later when he realises he’s read over the same sentence three times.
"Yes," he said softly. "And if I can't plan, then…"
"Colonel Phillips is not looking to replace one military dictator with another. He has absolutely no desire to be in power, and in fact had to be convinced by myself and several others to even agree to what he's agreed to."
"Good idea. Go," Steve said rapidly, still scanning the area. The explosions had stopped, but there was still plenty of debris falling from the crumbling building and dozens of frightened people still milling about. "Do we have fire and rescue on the way?"
" Tony exclaimed. "That's… well… that's just—!"
"Eh, not really," said Carol. "But no big deal. I'll start my search in your solar system and go from there."
"I'm still here, Steve," Tony said, a bit more emphatically this time. "I'm right in front of you."
"That's not going to happen," Steve practically spat out, his teeth tightly clenched.
With an effort that could only be described as monumental, Steve pulled himself up to his feet, favouring his injured foot as he tried to stand as straight as possible. It was then that he happened to notice that he was dressed in some sort of uniform, complete with boots, fingerless gloves, and a cowl resting on the floor against the wall. Obviously modelled after his own Captain America uniforms, it was dark blue, battered and battle-worn, with a massive HYDRA crest across the chestplate and smaller crests on the outside of his arms, where his Avengers 'A' should've been.
"What?" Tony yelled, completely aghast. "That's a bunch of bullshit, and you know it!"
"Okay, Tony," Gamora said with a slight smile. "I do think you're right that this could work, but only with Mantis's help."
"And you never close your bedroom door," said Uncle Bucky, rather slyly. "What, your dads don't want you seein' that girl or somethin'?"
Tony grinned as he brushed Steve's soaked bangs from his forehead. "Well… since this is your show tonight, why don't you tell me what you want, hmm?"
"Tony!" Steve cried just as Tony arrived at the aircraft, a pathetic sound that nearly tore Tony's heart right down the middle. He was so weak that he could barely move as the medics unbuckled his harness and lifted him from the cockpit, their family picture clutched in one hand. "Tony, where—where are you?"
bring Tony to bed at any given time only made not doing so that much worse.
"Hey, I know you!" the guy said as they approached his station, loud enough to draw the attention of the dozen or so people milling about the lobby. "Isn't your dad Iron Man?"
Tony's shoulders dropped. "Well… that sucks."
I pray that all of you are staying healthy and safe 💖
His arms sufficiently stretched, Steve lets them drop to his sides as he breathes in again, allowing the comforting scents of Lycra, rubber, and chlorine to wash over him.  Many people find the scent of chlorine harsh and distasteful, but Steve has loved it ever since the very first time he stepped out onto the pool deck.
Tony shook his head, a deep frown marring his beautiful face. "Goddamnit, Steve, I was such a fucking idiot! I don't know what I was thinking, I should've never let this happen! I should've started investigating Beck the very first time Pepper mentioned his name, and instead—"
He wasn't a baby anymore. It was time he started being able to handle certain things himself, even if Dad and Papa didn't seem to want to admit it.
Steve gasped, fear hitting him in the chest like a spear. Thor had seen Thanos up close, had already fought against him and lost. And if he, an actual god, and Hulk, the strongest creature that Steve had ever seen couldn't beat him, then how in the world could Tony and Peter?
“Definitely!” Steve squeaks, clutching his sides.  “Which means we should probably get this over with as soon as possible!”
"I'm gonna go speak with King T'Challa," Steve told Thor. "As soon as he gives the okay, I'll reveal the location of the Soul Stone. It's gonna be up to us to keep our eyes on it until Thanos gets it locked in the gauntlet, but as soon as that happens—"
he asked, so softly he was barely audible, even for Steve. "You—you saw our—our—?"
But apparently Steve had made some pretty definite plans for the room that night, as Tony discovered as soon as they set foot inside. Flickering candles sat on top of the dresser and both of the bedside tables, throwing shadows onto the walls and giving off a soft, glowing light that highlighted the lighter blond strands in Steve's hair. The bed was already turned down, with a large bottle of what looked like scented massage oil sitting next to their smaller bottle of lube on Steve's bedside table.
He brushed his teeth, running his wet fingers through his hair afterwards in a pretty much futile attempt to get his hair to cooperate. After a dismissive shrug at his reflection Peter opened the door, allowing Ms Sharon to take his elbow to help him back to bed.
again once he got back from Italy, and Peter was certain that Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky would take him at least once.
The second thing that he noticed—or was it actually the first? He couldn't quite tell—was the
"Yes," Steve whispered, cringing as a sharp stab of pain lanced him right in the gut. It felt so wrong of him to wish that somehow Tony and Peter would both be spared from Thanos' devastating snap, but he still wished it anyway.
"O-kay," Dad said slowly. He shot Peter a pointed look. "So, you got a name there, Mr Guardian?"
By the time Steve wakes, hungry and shivering from the cold, at least twelve hours have passed based on the state of his leg.  He blinks his eyes open to find Tony sitting nearby, bent over his armour as he tinkers with some of its components.
"Quill, please! Don't!" Peter said, gasping as another ice bolt raced down his spine. He tightened his grip on the gauntlet, trying to ignore his sensations of impending doom as he noticed that the electronic device holding Thanos' right hand was starting to wobble. "Please, you gotta stop!"
Dad called, just like he had called for him on that day at Disneyland. "
"Oh, yeah. There's a great doctor who works here who keeps a close eye on him, and he still sees the surgeon who fixed his heart once a year. But you know what they say. I mean, even cops tend to have higher incidences of heart attacks and stuff just because of their jobs, right?"
"He's unbeatable," Gamora said, so frankly that Tony flinched. "I have fought with him and for him for years. He was unbeatable before the stones, and now, with four of them, he'll be even more so."
"Um… yeah. Okay."
"Yeah, I guess." Tony fumbled around on his desk for his glasses, finally locating them under a bunch of tipped-over papers right next to the picture of a three-year-old Peter that he kept on his desk. The number of available aircraft wasn't the main problem, not as long as the pilots flying them were capable.
And now, they no longer had to worry about it.
Tony nodded, not trusting himself to speak. "Together," he finally whispered. "I can do that."
"Yeah, but we're not trying it out on anyone until we're a hundred and ten percent sure that we're right, bud," said Tony. "And that's not gonna be for awhile. Okay?"
And if he did lose the election, well… Peter didn't like thinking about what could happen. Dad and Papa had adamantly refused to publicly endorse any politicians, not wanting to give anyone the impression that the Avengers could be politically swayed. It was absolutely the right choice, but Peter still worried that it was going to come back and bite them at some point. Peter had had enough experience watching his father deal with various government agencies and committees to know that they always came with preformed or hidden agendas, none of which were ever beneficial to their family or to Stark Industries.
"The tunnel is now sufficiently powered, Captain," said JARVIS.

"It's your eyes, mo grá," he finally said. "No matter what you say, your eyes can never lie. At least, not to me. And since Peter's eyes are the same as yours, his can't lie either."
“Yeah,” Steve says softly.  He’s plenty aware of how engrossed Tony can get when he’s working.  He sees it multiple times per week.
It felt like at least an hour had passed by the time Steve regained some semblance of feeling in his limbs, finally peeling his eyes open to find his husband's lust-blown brown eyes watching him, his chin resting comfortably in the curve of Steve's pelvis.
Not that Steve will ever get a chance to do anything more than look, but… apparently, he has a type.
"All right," Peter said once everything was up and running. "JARVIS, no one comes into this room except for me, understand?"
“Uh huh.”  Peter is quiet as they begin to walk across the campus, too in awe of how pretty it is despite the frigid January cold.  True to form, he starts coughing before they’re even halfway there, pulling his inhaler out of his jacket pocket and taking two hits as they arrive at the heavy double doors of the three-story Athletics building.
"Yeah, and he's not really all that much of a fan of hockey anyway," Peter mumbled. "And he and Betty have been hanging out quite a bit lately too, so they might even have plans already."
"Have you ever noticed any side-effects from your serum procedure, Captain?" he finally asked. "Anything you would consider… peculiar?"
"You don't have to thank me for wanting to be with you," he'd told Tony just the night before, while walking him back to his office after their date. As soon as he'd said it, Tony had dropped his eyes and started fidgeting on his feet, two things that Steve had noticed Tony often did when he was feeling insecure.
“That's okay!” Steve choked out as Tony slowly gained speed.  “I’m—I’m not—oh,
He had just slid under his blankets when the announcement came, one he had heard every single night for the last ten years and yet never failed to make his heart jump.
“Ahh,” Tony said, waving a dismissive hand.  “Just trying to help make the world a better place, and all that jazz.”
"Steve, please. You don't need to say anything—"
"Стиви?" he said, more timid and frightened than Steve had ever heard him. In his right hand he carried his rifle, the rifle Tony had built for him, while his left—wasn't there.
"But not one that we can rule out, I don't think," Steve said worriedly, his face pale and his voice about three octaves higher than usual. "Tony, we can't let him go to that party!"
"Steve," Tony suddenly said, tugging gently on his arm. Steve gulped as he leaned forward, his eyes going wide as no fewer than seven senators in a row proceeded to vote Nay.
I hope all of you guys are staying safe and healthy 💖
“Well… then I think it’s wonderful that your father encourages your love of reading so much,” said Steve.
Steve internally groans.  As much as he might enjoy reminiscing about his gold medal swims five years ago, he never got used to all the recognition he gained from them.
“Good fucking grief.”
"Tony, isn't that—?"
"Yeah, I'd have to agree with you there, honey," said Tony. "And kudos to your ma for being so awesome, yeah?"
"Okay, so what is it?" asked Tony, glancing furtively at Peter's monitor.
Weapons that were then used to target U.S. Army Special Forces units.  Including the unit that Steve used to lead.
And, right on the heels of that sentiment,
And Steve can’t help but notice just how well they fit together.  Or the slight blush that creeps up Tony’s cheeks as he releases him.
can't I just make it
"Maybe," Peter said into Tony's chest. "But the fact is that I am having to deal with it, and I just don't want to anymore. I just want it gone, Dad, all of it. I'm sick of having a ticking time bomb stuck inside of me, and I just want it out of my head." He tipped his head up to look into Tony's eyes. "Please? I don't—I don't want other people to get hurt again because of me. That's not what heroes do."
Steve thinks as he closes out the application and slumps into his chair.
"Let me," he murmured. He tapped Steve's shoulder, indicating for him to roll onto his back. "Get your pants and boxers off for me, yeah?"
"Oh God!" Peter exclaimed. He had no idea who could possibly be on that ship, but he was really,
None of his provisional battle plans had ever included the possibility of Tony—or Peter—going off into space. Not a single one.
“So, Peter,” Mr Rogers says once they’re back in the conference room.  “Can you tell me why you asked your father to call me, instead of joining your own school’s swim team or one of the local teams?”
“Very good, sir.”
"It's gonna be nice to get out of the city, don't you think, hon?" Tony asked once they had crawled into bed, Steve's chest firmly pressed against Tony's back. They were heading back to Malibu in the morning on Tony's private airplane, intending to spend the summer relaxing, playing on the beach, and going to Disneyland.
"I was six," Tony said. "I had a heart defect."
T'Challa's eyes narrowed. "Then we had better hope it does not come down to that, Captain."
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Dr Cho finished her exam, turning to Steve and Tony with a wary look on her face that sent Steve's heart into his throat.
Tony glanced over at Peter's monitor, at his son lying there motionless while his mind tried to repair itself yet again. "What about the other names on the list?"
Steve said as he turned to Colonel Phillips. "Do you really think—?"
And the fact that Tony remembers something like that is enough to bring a slight smile to Steve’s face.
"Well, yeah," Tony said with a shrug. "Helps keep my mind busy."
"Yeah. I know lots of people who blame him for what happened. But it's not really fair, is it? It's not like he's the one who blew up the power plant and caused all this mess. He wasn't even at the base when it happened. He was at the hospital with my dad."
"Well, like I said, Rhodey pretty much had to talk me down from the ceiling, and after that I just kinda stared at Pete for awhile, until he started to fidget and squirm. Pete never liked being in his car seat or stroller all that much, he always preferred being held, so it didn't take long for him to get antsy. And then when I didn't pick him up right away, he started to cry, and—"
Which, Tony had to grudgingly admit, was probably true.
There was a pause once Steve was done, as if O'Brien had expected him to keep talking.
"Your oxygen saturation is already below ninety percent, your lungs are soaking wet, and both your heart and your respiratory rates are elevated," Ms Sharon stated. "Sweetie, I'm afraid you're not gonna last too much longer unless you stop what you're doing now and get some rest."
"I'm gonna head back too," Peter stated as his mask closed over his face, the white adjustable eyes narrowing into playful slits as he looked over at Pietro. "Hey, Pietro. Wanna race?"
"Yeah, I do, but I still think you should take a break," Sam insisted. "There's no reason for you to exhaust yourself before our first meeting with a prince. Especially a prince who's grieving."
The cave. The Malibu house bombing. Project Insight. The streets of Queens. The Miami bunker. The Compound's lake. The movie theatre. The invisible HYDRA bunker.

Quill's head snapped back in surprise. "One of Thanos' guys? No! Ego was my father!"
"Do you think that's the new girl?"
"JARVIS, how close is Steve to his reentry point?"
Steve cleared his throat, glancing furtively at Tony.  “It’s always a pleasure seeing you, Mr Reeves,” he said.  “Have a wonderful evening.”
"Oh, really?" Sam asked, frowning. "And who in the hell is 'we'?"
Steve thought, surprised at the sharp flare of jealousy that shot through him. He had no business being envious of a busy father who finally got the opportunity to visit his sick child.
"Steve." Steve jumped as someone called out his name from somewhere, possibly from behind him, though he couldn't be sure. He couldn't be sure about anything anymore. Not after the stunning defeat they had just suffered.
The most frustrating part was that not even JARVIS had a record of everything that had happened, thanks to the whole jump-back-in-time do-over thing, so essentially all that Peter knew for sure was after Thanos got the Time Stone from Dr Strange, he then managed to get his hands on the Soul Stone in Wakanda and snap his fingers. And that Dad and Peter were still up on Titan when it happened.
"No, it's not," Peter agreed. "And that's why we're gonna change it. But first you need to go and call Uncle Sam, okay?"
Peter thought.
"No, little guy, I'm not positive," admitted Steve. "But you and I are gonna do whatever we can to keep him from getting to that point, all right? When I was growing up, my ma and I didn't always have the money for me to see a doctor, but since she was a nurse, she knew all kinds of good tricks to help me feel better."
"I know, mo grá, I know," Steve said, low and thick. He tucked Tony close again, his fingers gliding up his back to thread into his hair. "And I hate leaving you too, you know I do. But Fury's right. If that space phenomenon does turn out to be something important, then having the Wakandans as allies could be a pretty big help."
"Ahh, that means all at the same time, right?" asked Quill.
A wave of emotion suddenly hit Steve square in the chest, and he gasped, prompting Tony to grab onto his hand.
"M'Baku seems like a pretty stand-up guy," added James. "I'm sure he and the General will be able to get the country back into some semblance of order."
"Um," Tony said, forcing the word past the large lump in his throat. "You got any other examples?"
“Don't wander too far away, okay?” he calls after Tony, because apparently he just can’t keep his mouth shut.  “There's no way of knowing what else is in here!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Glancing over at Sam, Steve sucked in a deep breath and stepped through the circle, directly into the entry area of what appeared to be a large, Victorian-type house. Debris consisting of broken and twisted pieces of wood and stone littered the wide steps of the large grand staircase, and there was a huge gaping hole in the vaulted ceiling, almost as if it had been attacked by something.
Tony honestly couldn't remember, but even he couldn't deny that it felt good. Like
"All right then, Mr Strange Wizard," Tony said under his breath. "Where the hell are you?"
"Rhodey? Something wrong?"
"How's it going over there?" he asked in his Captain's voice. "Anything new?"
"D-doc—" the man managed to gasp through his gurgling, just before he let out a piercing scream. Steve immediately shrank back, grabbing Tony's shoulders as more and more fluid poured off the man's skin.
"Oh I know, hot stuff," Tony said with a grin. He tipped his head up to kiss him, forcing himself to pull back so they couldn't get too carried away. "But right now I'm thinking that we've got about thirty minutes before that kid of ours decides that he's hungry, and you know what happens when he decides that he's hungry."
Steve's eyebrows shot up, and he leaned closer, lowering his voice. "Oh, really? Does that mean Colonel Phillips has already decided on who's going?"
"Oh, you know I love it when you think like that. It's a date." Tony pecked Steve's lips one final time, giving his ass another firm squeeze. "Now, get out of here before I go out there and try to convince Thor to make dinner for Pete, 'cause I'm pretty sure if he tried that we'd no longer have a kitchen afterwards."
"Yeah, yeah," Peter muttered as he downed the last few sips of his cocoa. "And I'm not a child. I'm a teenager."
Warmth flared in Tony's chest as he recalled the look on Rogers'—
"Oh. Well, I s'pose that's a good thing," said Ned as they arrived at the front door. "So, do you think we're supposed to ring the doorbell, or just go inside?"
Tony winced, remembering the eerie look in Strange's eyes as he explained to Tony his dire prediction. Over fourteen million different possible outcomes, and only two of those that could lead to Thanos' defeat.
And so, Steve embraced it, as tightly as he embraced his beloved husband.
Phillips's eyes narrowed, and he stepped closer, lowering his voice.
Besides. Who better to help Bucky cheer up a bit than Peter, who despite his illness was literal sunshine in the form of a human child. Steve was convinced that if given the chance, Peter could probably even charm the socks off of old, crusty General O'Brien himself.
Steve heard a soft cough from the bed, and he looked down to see Bucky helping Peter to sit up, blinking and bleary-eyed like he had just woken up from a long nap. He breathed in, squaring his shoulders as he looked directly at his image counterpart.
Steve thought.
Chaos erupted on the bus, with all of the students scrambling from their seats to crowd in the back, clamoring to get a better look at the spaceship. Peter quickly seized the opportunity, launching a web at the emergency exit window across the aisle. With a final glance back at Gwen, he slipped out to cling to the side of the bus as he dug around behind his neck for his mask, pulling it up and over his head.
"Mmm. And how's Erin doing?"
Thor let out a wide grin, looking quite pleased with himself. "Well, I am aware that I am quite popular with most of the young people on this planet. That is, of course, assuming that your sister is indeed—"
In fact, now that Tony thought about it, Peter had been especially moody ever since he and Steve had gotten home from D.C. He had tried to brush most of it off as Peter just being upset about the whole registration act thing, but not even that was enough to explain all of it.
peanut butter!" answered Scott, sighing so heavily that he nearly tipped over. "Thanks—thank you, Captain. Rogers. For the—the offer."
"I know," Tony answered as he kissed Steve's knuckles. "We can tell him in the morning, all right?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t hesitate to leave me a comment!  😊
Peter shrugged. "I guess just go inside? It's not like anyone could hear the doorbell anyway over all the music."
"Hey guys!" she said. "You made it!"
Clint bursts into laughter over the comm.  “Way to leave Cap hanging out there, Thor!” he yells as Steve flips over the handlebars of his bike, launching it directly into the path of an oncoming truck full of guns-blazing HYDRA soldiers.  He cringes as the truck explodes, taking the bike right along with it.
"Yeah, that's fine," Tony said. "Thanks."
Even less so the fact that the giant purple alien had actually succeeded, if only temporarily.
"Pretty sure that one was it," Rhodey replied as he flew back around, stopping to hover across from Tony. "Falcon, can you confirm?"
Steve huffed, sadly shaking his head. "If he didn't before then he probably will now, and… around the base… I just—I don't know who might be listening to us that shouldn't be."
"Yeah, that's a go," said Tony. He lowered his arms, a huge smile spreading across his lips as the holographic nanites absorbed back into their container. Finally, he seemed to have broken through the proverbial brick wall with this tech.
They weren't going to take him or any of the rest of the team without a fight, that was certain, but it also meant that Tony needed to work
"Yeah, you're pretty cool yourself," Tony whispered back. "Now, get outta here before your stomach starts eating itself."
He felt like he had just lost a really brutal fight, but he couldn't remember throwing a single punch. His entire aching body was covered with various cuts, scrapes, and bruises, his head felt like it'd been filled with quicksand, and he couldn't remember the last time he'd had anything to eat or drink.
"Oh," Gwen said, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion. "Um, I startled you by saying hi?"
… You know, one would think that the great and powerful Anthony Stark would have better manners than that. I mean, Howard always had impeccable manners, but I guess that's one thing that he didn't seem to pass down to his son, so—"
Tony silenced him with another kiss, brushing his thumbs across Steve's perfectly sculpted cheekbones. "Say no more, honey. Just show me the way."
Not even Howard coming to Tony three weeks later to tell him that he was pushing him out of Stark Industries, a decision Tony still believes to this day was strongly influenced by Howard’s business partner, Obadiah the Asshole, could compare.  He should’ve known something like that was coming when Howard proceeded to shut Tony out of all of his mother’s funeral plans, giving him the lame excuse that he was “too busy with the baby” to be able to help.  At the time, Tony tried to brush it off as Howard not knowing how to grieve, combined with the guilt he must’ve felt since Tony’s mother had asked Howard to drive her that evening, but Howard had been too drunk to do so.
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
Emotionally, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to handle it if they were wrong.
"Yeah, only if Thor promises not to shout with glee every three seconds," Dad said as he took his turn kissing Peter goodnight. "And I thought
She broke off then, covering her face with her hands. "They made my brother and me watch while they—while they killed him, and then they took us and gave us some kind of drug, and—"
"I know you didn't," Steve murmured. "I'm just—"
"So, George Stacy told me that he won't be able to make it to the Mets game this coming Thursday," Sam said as he and Steve jogged to a stop outside of the Tower's main entrance. "Something about a school performance for one of his boys, so Bucky and I will have an extra ticket if you wanna come."
Tony watched them head towards the elevator, his mind already swirling with everything that he needed to get done before Steve left. He'd just finished a brand-new uniform for Steve a few nights ago when he couldn't sleep, a replacement for his traditional red, white, and blue Captain America uniform. This latest model featured upgraded Kevlar throughout the chest and abdomen—where Steve always managed to take hits, no matter who or where he was fighting—and some extra cushioning in his left boot to support the foot that HYDRA nearly destroyed beyond repair in their quest to study Steve's ability to self-heal. A shiver raced down Tony's spine as he recalled the stomach-flipping grotesqueness of Steve's poor foot, and how long it took for Steve to recover from it, with Tony worrying the entire time that HYDRA might've managed to push Steve's body beyond the regenerative limits of the serum.
"Good," Peter stated. "'Cause they'll need to."
It would be enough to kill any lesser man.
“Mmph!” grumbled Peter.  He supposed that even if the presence of Special Forces inside the country wasn't considered “official”, it still meant they would be allowed to receive supply shipments as long as their soldiers were within its borders.
Steve's lower lip quivered as he shook his head. "Please, mo grá. Just keep Peter safe."
“Okay, so… it’s obvious that the document’s been altered, so… now we’ve just gotta figure out who the hell did it, and what it actually says underneath all that redaction.”
"Yeah, bud," Dad said as he sat down on Peter's bed, leaning down to kiss his forehead. "Wow, handsome boy. Did you get a haircut today or something?"
"And cue the monologue in three… two… one…" Rhodey said as Thanos came to a stop in front of the Chitauri, a leering smile stretching across his puffy purple lips.
was different now.

"This isn't real!" he said in the best Captain's voice he could muster. "Get out of my head!"
"Ah huh. And what do you think? You think it looks like a person in there?"
Tony gave a stuttered nod. "Three days. Don't you dare be late."
"Um… for me?" she asked, taken aback. She swiped at her eyes, red-rimmed and puffy. "Oh no, Captain, I'm not here to ask you for anything. I just—well… I just wanted to see how Mr Stark was doing."
"Very good, very good," said the general. "And your impeccable record since joining the Air Corps ten years ago certainly speaks for itself. You are definitely a good man to have around, Captain. The perfect soldier, if I may."
"Yeah, Carol, I'm here," Steve replied. "Exit was a bit longer than last time."
"Солдат, ты соблюдаешь?" the colonel repeated.
"Go to hell, traitor," Peter spat out, cringing at how pathetic he sounded to his own ears.
And now, once again, all Steve could do was wait.
"Oh, that's good," Tony said in a rush. For how much he hated the idea that most people saw his child as nothing more than a burden to society, at the moment it was probably much safer for Peter that way. The last thing Tony wanted was for Peter's vast intelligence to be somehow discovered and for him to be forced into governmental servitude, like Howard had allowed him to be.
"Until I turn eighteen," Peter interrupted, frowning. "Yeah, yeah, I know. So when will I get to try out the new suit?"
Steve gave his head a hard shake as he retrieved some leftover homemade ravioli and garlic bread from the refrigerator and set about reheating them, including enough for the two of them since he knew Tony was more likely to stop and eat if they could eat together. Steve's stomach gave a rumble as the delicious scents of oregano, Parmesan, and marinara sauce permeated throughout the kitchen, and he smiled as he recalled how much fun he and Peter had preparing the meal the previous night, as if they were just a normal family making and eating dinner together.
"No, I'm not," answered Steve. "And that only makes it worse because we still don't know who all we can trust, but… from now on I think we should assume that we could be overheard pretty much anywhere on the base."
Tony shivered again as Steve's left arm slipped around his waist, pressing his back up against Steve's broad chest. His head tipped back against Steve's shoulder, his eyes fluttering closed as Steve reached for his bar of soap, the plain Ivory soap that he'd used ever since he was a kid, and began stroking it gently across Tony's chest.
"It is this time, Papa," Peter interrupted. "Please, just trust us, okay?"
"Nothing's more important to me than you are, Peter Edwin Stark," Tony said firmly. "And you know it,"
"Copy, Mr Wilson," said Stacy. "There is a bit of a problem, though. I'm not sure how we're supposed to get inside Captain Rogers' cell."
"I won't. I'm sorry," Steve whispered, just before capturing Tony's lips. It was a quick kiss, as they were both practically asleep on their feet, but it still was enough to send a burst of tingly warmth through Tony's exhausted body.
"Well, maybe 'cause the kid's gonna have it for their entire life?" asked Tomis. "I dunno, that sounds like kinda a big deal to me."
Steve hadn't been hit that hard since… well… not since the fight against Bucky, back when he was the Winter Soldier. And not even Bucky had packed that much of a wallop.
heard is an answer to my question!” barked Tony.  “What is the plan for getting Steve out of there?”
"Hey, hey, hey, little guy, it's okay. I've got you," Steve said as he attempted to grab onto their flailing son. Tony cringed as Peter managed to twist out of Steve's grasp and grab onto his IV needle, ripping it right out of his arm and causing blood to spurt from the open wound, dripping down his arm and onto the bed.
Dad flinched, his arms tightening around Peter as he looked over at Dr Strange. "If anyone would know, it'd be him."
Thank you so much for all of your wonderful comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!
It wasn’t too unlike the missions he had conducted during the war.  The only difference this time was that there were no Howling Commandos to back him up.
"We're hoping there'll be enough information here that we'll be able to finally take down HYDRA completely," Papa said. "And once that's done, then hopefully things will turn around for us."
Bucky gave a nod, sliding the glasses onto his face and leaning back against the pillows, his hands clasped tightly in his lap.
The tone of Tony’s voice, so melancholy and devoid of hope, is enough to make tears burn in Steve’s eyes.
"Yeah, I'm sure. I should be showing up around dinnertime tomorrow, all right?"
"Copy that, Danvers," said Steve, just as his X-302 pulled back into the hangar. "Keep a firm hand on the stick as you come through, there's a pretty wicked shimmy at first, but nothing we haven't handled before."
"We could all head out to Indiana for awhile," said Uncle Clint from his perch near the window. "I'm sure my sister-in-law wouldn't mind having some extra farm hands for a few days. You'd probably have to sleep in the barn though, the house isn't really all that big."
A pang of fear laced with remorse suddenly hit Steve straight in the gut, nearly causing him to double over. He simply could not ignore that his own husband and child should've been there too, standing side-by-side with him. Or preferably just Tony, with Peter safely at home.
"Sure, bud, that's fine," he said as he followed Sam off the tarmac and onto the street, heading for the freeway that led home, with Peter falling asleep again not even three minutes later. As soon as Tony engaged the cruise control Steve placed his hand on his knee, looking over at him with frightened yet determined eyes.
"No!" Steve shrieked as he bolted upright in bed, the tattered remains of the bedsheets clutched in his white-knuckled fists. Air whooshed from his lungs as his eyes flitted around the dimly lit room, trying to regain his bearings, his heart thudding so madly it was as though it was trying to escape from his chest.
Steve’s confidence gets a slight boost when the announcer introduces him as the defending Olympic champion, enough for him to give a genuine smile as he waves to the crowd.
"Well, all right then," Tony said. He'd run out of excuses. "Go ahead and plan your party."
“Yeah, I know,” Tony says quickly, in that awful dismissive way that Steve has already come to loathe.  “I’m just…”  He lets out a short laugh, throwing up his hands.  “I’m just the one who led us down into this goddamn booby trap, but hey, at least you're not gonna bleed to death anymore, so—”
Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, but thankfully didn't press the issue. Instead, he released Steve and plunked down onto the couch, patting the cushion next to him.
With a heavy sigh, Peter pushed himself up off the bed and got to his feet. He hadn't eaten anything for over three hours, trying to ignore his grumbling stomach because he could barely bring himself to step foot inside the kitchen. But he was already starting to get the shakes from low blood sugar, and the last thing Dad needed at the moment was for Peter to pass out because he'd been too stubborn to eat.
Ms Sharon sighed. "Peter—"
"Yeah, that sounds about right. JARVIS, how close is Steve to his reentry point?"
"Copy that," Tony replied as he swerved, heading back towards the hole in the roof. "Then I think it's time for a new plan."
Steve’s eyes are swimming with tears as he makes his final lunge for the touchpad, blowing water out of his mouth as he’s carried into the wall.  Then he sucks in a huge lungful of air, death-gripping the gutter with his right hand as he slowly turns to look at the clock, searching for his name.
of a bat connecting with a baseball briefly drew Tony's attention, and he watched as the ball sailed over the left field fence, the various cadets all whooping and yelling as they reveled in the batter's prowess.
Apparently Thanos was calling for even more reinforcements.
"I just got off the phone with Colonel Phillips," he began. "Carol and the other backup patrollers were up there for three straight hours, and they couldn't find a damn thing that might give us a clue as to what the hell happened out there today. Phillips already has the secondary backup crew up there with the current patrol shift, but again, he's not expecting them to find anything either."
“Yep, he’s waiting for me outside,” said Peter.  He shifted his backpack to both shoulders, hugging his shopping bag close and wondering if he should ask Steve if he was okay.
Then again, aside from Rhodey, Steve, and Sam, Tony had never been all that impressed with the overall leadership in the U.S. Military, seeing it as mainly a "good ole boys" club, and almost as politically-driven as the rest of D.C.
"From what I've seen, I can agree with you," said Grandma. "And to be honest, that's not all that easy for me to say. I'm not proud of it, but I've spent the last twenty-eight or so years blaming Howard Stark for what happened to my husband."
"It was supposed to be
"I'm sorry," Steve whispered, pressing a kiss to Tony's forehead. "I can get a different clock if that would help."
Mr Stacy leaned forward, his jaw set. "I was there, that night in Harlem when the Hulk and that other thing went nuts and destroyed ten city blocks. And I was also there during the Battle of New York, watching as those alien things destroyed buildings and killed people. And both times we lost a lot of officers. Good, loyal officers, who had families, and yet the Avengers seem to come out okay every single time. Don't they."
"Look at me, Tony," Steve said as he trailed his fingertips down Tony's arm, intertwining their fingers. "I love you, mo grá. I love you so much!"
Oh, he knew Steve would disagree, and maybe there was a part of Tony that might've too, deep down. But the fact of the matter was, Tony had become so tangled in his chains of guilt and grief over Peter that he couldn't even think about anything else. Couldn't feel anything besides the horrible, gut-wrenching pain, and couldn't hear anything besides his own inner voices telling him that he hadn't done enough to save his precious boy.
“Oh, really?” said Tony.  “But isn't he the one who’s supposed to be getting some honour or award at the end of the month?  Isn't that the gala that you insisted that I find a date for, or you would find me one yourself?”
And Tony loved him for it.
"Oh, yeah," said Cam. "When you see your kid tonight, tell him that we all say hi, hmm? No way any of this would've worked without him."
His son. His and Tony's sweet, precious boy was
His two precious boys, who he loved more than life itself.
"Come in?" Steve said, not too surprised when Natasha poked her head inside. It never ceased to amaze Steve how even-keeled Natasha could be while everything else seemed to be on a straight line to hell.
"Is that the Colonel Uncle James, or the Uncle Bucky, Uncle James?" Gwen asked as they headed into the dining room, which was unfortunately right next to the living room where the music was still going full-blast.
"His heart rate and blood pressure are elevated like he's under stress, Tony, but neither of them are dangerous," said Bruce. "You know I'll let you know if they get too high."
Ms Sharon frowned as she pressed her stethoscope to Peter's chest. "You really need your rest, sweetie. Your lungs are sounding pretty waterlogged at the moment, and I know your dads wouldn't want you to—"
"Yeah, it was," Peter agreed. Climbing into the driver's seat, he took a second to re-familiarise himself with the controls. "You do realise this probably means that they'll be sitting in that coffee shop a block away the whole time though."
They celebrated with plenty of pizza, Dr Pepper, and obnoxious music once everyone was safely back in the Stark Industries building. Tony hung back from most of the festivities, trying to keep an eye on Peter without making it seem too obvious. For his part, Peter did pretty well, managing to maintain his brave face for almost an hour before Tony noticed Gwen Stacy taking him by the hand and exiting the boisterous room, heading down a quieter hallway where Peter immediately started to cry.
"I know you do, Tony, and Peter, he loves you so much," said Steve. "He was so sad at first when you could never get away in time to visit him and it was breaking my heart, so once I figured out who he was I asked—"
—to how to properly ask a girl out on a date that didn't end with Tony getting slapped across the face.
"All right," Tony said. "Does that include our room?"
"Don't fucking touch me," Tony said, so low that Steve barely heard him. "I'm not going anywhere."
Steve asked. "It's an endearment, like sweetheart. It means 'my darling'. My papa used to call my ma that a lot."
"Sweetheart?" he asked, taking Tony gently by the elbows. "What is it? The questions about Bucky?"
"Uhh, well…" Tony stammered. "He went out for a run early this morning, and I saw his sketchbook sitting there on the table so I just decided to flip through it while I was waiting for him to come back, and I found a drawing that was just like the one that you drew. With the birds. It was just too similar to be a coincidence, so…"
"Which is why I'm here." Steve pressed a quick kiss to Tony's forehead and pulled back, indicating the food. "I didn't want you going hungry while you're trying to work."
“This is Mr Samuel Thomas Wilson, formerly of the U.S. Air Force.  Honourably discharged after two tours, former member of the 103rd Pararescue Unit, and currently working as a counsellor at the Veterans Administration On the Mall in D.C.”  Tony clapped Sam on the shoulder, jerking his head towards Obie.  “Mr Wilson, if you don't mind, could you please inform Mr Stane here what exactly it is that you do down there at the VA?”
And that was the last thing he needed at the moment.
Tony breathed in, his eyes briefly fluttering shut. He had feared that something like this would happen, despite Phillips's assurances to the contrary, but he had still been clinging to the hope that it wouldn't.
Steve looks down at his juice bottle, fiddling with the cap.  “Yeah, I guess.  I never thought I’d want to, but… I just can’t pass this up, Nat.  Not with this kid.  And besides being an incredible talent, Peter is probably the nicest, sweetest kid I’ve ever met, so anything good he’s got coming to him is going to be very well-deserved.”
😭 = I got you right in the feels
Peter shrugged, something that Steve had noticed he did quite a bit.  “Eh, mostly ‘cause I think playing in competitions would take all the fun out of it,” he said.  He leaned forward, lowering his voice.  “And ‘cause a lot of those kids’ parents are a bit mad, if you know what I mean.  Like… cuckoo.”
"Нет," Winter Soldier repeated. "Я решил не подчиняться."
"You do?" Steve exclaimed, wincing when Peter's eyes went wide. "I mean, you do?"
He simply could
"C'mon, Pete, it'll be better once you get it out," said Dad.
"I'd—I'd like to help you, Mr Stark, if—if I can," said Gwen. "Maybe if I could take a look at Peter's computer or something we could figure out where he's gone?"
Yet another rung in the skyscraping ladder of Tony's guilt.
“Sure, Obie.  I can do that.”
Peter instinctively wrinkled his nose. "I don't really have an opinion on how hot my parents are, or any of the rest of them. They're just my parents."
It was as if the rest of the universe was as stunned as he was.
"I'll make sure the guards are there, honey," Dad said. He reached over to give Papa's knee a reassuring pat. "And I don't think Pete would try anything stupid while his girlfriend is with him, so we should be okay."
"Uh huh. Try not to work too hard, okay?"
Never see his head bent together with Tony as they worked on one of their projects together, tinkering with this or that, or some other thing.
"Huh?"
“Okay, so I’m about ninety percent positive that Hulk just took out the last of the big bunkers, Cap, so why don't you go see what Tony’s up to while the rest of us search for stragglers, hmm?” Clint says.  Another roar cuts him off, one even louder than the last.  “Actually, make that one hundred percent.”
"Captain Rogers," he said, offering Steve a quick salute that he returned. "The general is expecting you."
"Relax, sweetheart," murmured Steve, his left hand a constant pressure on the small of Tony's back as he slid in a second finger. "Breathe."
"Steve?" he heard Tony say, frantic with worry. "Steve, what's going on up there? Are you okay?"
"Well, yeah, that is one of the main goals," Anthony answered. "The Air Corps isn't in the business of stranding its pilots out in space."
"Стиви," Bucky said. "We're all worried about Птер too, and we're workin' as fast as we can. But Наталия is right, this isn't something we can rush. If we pick the wrong phrase when we're trying to decrypt we risk losing the entire file, and then we're back at square one."
Was it even possible to retain any semblance of control in the midst of that much chaos?
It was Howard.
"Yes," said Gamora. "Which means there's only two left for him to find."
Tony scoffs, but takes a small sip of water anyway.
Who they had—
Tony was in his lab, working on whatever he was working on to make sure nothing like what had happened at the lake ever happened again. He and Peter had been spending most of their time in there ever since Peter's hands had healed, and Steve had just been trying to remain supportive while staying out of their way. He knew better than to protest too much when Tony got into one of his manic building modes.
Whatever it took.
"There's no grey area for me when it comes to you and Peter, Tony," Steve said firmly. "Absolutely none. And there never will be."
"Did you hear that they're gonna hold a dance for the freshman and sophomores?" Gwen asked once she pulled back. "It's the night before the regular prom, the first Friday in June."
"Oh? What's his name?"
"Tony, I promise I can wait," Steve said. "I'm not going to put you or Peter at risk just because I'm curious."
Steve scowled. "Copy that," he said as he pulled back, allowing Bucky to manoeuvre in front of him.
Tony grinned, one so beautiful and carefree that Steve could almost forget that they had just finalised a plan to save the universe.
"I'm not gonna be scared," Peter said, rather petulantly. "I'm not scared of bullies, Dad. Not even HYDRA ones."
"Mmm, fine," Tony said with a pout. "But I am gonna hold you to it, so be prepared."
"I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but I have orders," said Bartlett as one of his partners pulled out a pair of handcuffs that looked like they could've contained a rhinoceros.
He was cut off by another blast, this time straight to his chest, throwing him backwards at least twenty metres and landing him flat on his back, unable to breathe.
Surely he couldn't be the only person to have actually read the thing, or who would protest such a horrible injustice.
"Everything looks good here, Tony!" Bruce said excitedly. "Seems like he did it!"
"Okay, well, how 'bout I make you a trade offer?" said Pepper. "I've been going back and forth about even bugging you about this, but since you called—"
, Peter thought, his guilt quickly replaced by panic as he realised he was still stuck to the flying sentry suit and was rapidly approaching the opposite side of the prison. He released the web, dropping down onto the damp sand with a muffled cry and breathing a slight sigh of relief when no further sand monsters appeared.
"Sweetheart, I—" Steve started.
"I am already attempting to wake Captain Rogers, sir," replied JARVIS. "Please stand by."
He should’ve known that his first time bottoming wouldn’t change that.
Tony's lips curled into a smirk as he kissed that sensitive spot under Steve's jaw, smirking when he shuddered. "Soon as the kid goes to bed, honey. After that, you're all mine."
"We've still got two more!" called Sam as he angled down. "Bucky, Peter, on your two o'clock!"
“You're welcome, Mr Stark.”
"Sounds awesome, Papa," Peter said, bouncing impatiently on his feet. "I'm ready, let's go!"
"Well, that's only because we both love you," said Steve. He cupped Tony's jaw, angling it down so he could kiss him. "I'm gonna make you some breakfast now, okay?"
"Yeah," Tony said as he wound his arms around Steve's waist. "Just thinking."
was a favourite book of Steve's. "Yeah, bud, I s'pose he does. That's Ant-Man."
"Not critical yet, at least," muttered Steve, softening his words with a quick kiss to Tony's forehead. "Now, if you're going to insist that I not take you to a hospital, I suppose I can let that slide for the time being. But if I sense that you're getting sicker, or if your temp spikes up much higher, I'm not going to wait, sweetheart. I can't—I just can't take the chance."
"I'm Spider-Man," Peter said proudly as he grabbed onto Fake Man's arm again, raising the armoured suit over his head and launching it towards the far wall about thirty metres away. He let out a soft, "Hmph," behind his mask as the armour crashed against the solid stone, shattering into a bunch of pieces that scattered across the floor with very satisfying rattles.
mention my husband or my son around me," Steve spat out, his injured ribs protesting his vehemence. "They are both a million times better men that you'll ever hope to be, so you just keep their names out of your filthy mouth,
"Oh? And what's that, Mr Man-with-a-plan?"
"Sure, little guy," Papa said gently, his eyebrows knitted together in what Dad always called his worry wrinkle. Peter hated that worry wrinkle almost as much as Dad did, and even more so when he was the cause of it.
And now Steve knew that with his soon-to-be husband and son by his side, they could face whatever challenges life and work decided to throw at them.
It doesn't help that, for some reason, Tony seems utterly oblivious to his own charisma and charm.  And, how whenever Steve tries to bring up that fact, attempts to compliment him during one of their late nights tucked inside Tony’s lab when he’s tinkering and Steve’s sketching, Tony never fails to brush it aside, almost like he’s embarrassed.  Steve has heard him mention that he’s too busy to date, and while Steve can see that—he is a single father, after all, among all of his other responsibilities—he also secretly wishes that wasn’t the case.
Papa sighed, his shoulders sagging a bit. "Yes, you are. And I'm so, so grateful, Peter, because I love you. Both Dad and I love you so much. Our little family just wouldn't be complete without you."
he begged, hating himself for sounding so pathetic. "I don't want him to worry about me, and—"
Steve let out a soft smile. "Yeah, I do." He flicked his eyes over to the pantry as he reached for the freezer door. "Can you find the boxes of chicken broth in there for me? We're gonna get started on some soup."
"Hello, Mr Stacy," Steve replied. "And yes, this is Peter's Uncle James, who will be accompanying Peter and Gwen to the movies."
And the nearly overwhelming confusion he'd had once he finally woke up.
Tony scoffed, shaking his head. He knew that Peter and Steve had spent quite a bit of time discussing strategic planning since Steve excelled at it, so the barely-still-rational part of him had to assume that Peter wasn't completely flying by the seat of his pants.
Her words hit Peter like a blow to the chest, and he literally stumbled back a step. "Um… how—how do you think you know that? 'Cause I'm pretty sure that I've never said anything about being Spider-Man, and I
Steve nodded as a tear rolled down his cheek, his long artist’s fingers slowly curling around Tony’s wrists as he got to the final shirt button, halting his frantic movements.  “I know, sweetheart.  Tony, I
"Uhh…" Peter bit his lip, just now realising that he was asking JARVIS to help him find a building that was supposedly invisible. JARVIS was really good at a lot of things, but even he probably wouldn't be able to locate a building cloaked with HYDRA retro-reflective tech.
" Peter began. He pulled a chair over for Uncle Bucky to join him and opened the book, pointing to the chapter on asthma treatments. "But it even says so right here. Since they didn't have inhaler technology back then, I guess that was the only way they knew of to get the asthma drugs down into his lungs. But even then, Papa told me the drugs didn't really work all that well and that they made him hallucinate too, which is just freaky anyway."
"Yes, mo grá, I get it," Steve said softly as he cupped Tony's cheek in his hand. "But couldn't you have just upgraded the chips in my old uniforms instead of making me another one?"
From what Steve already knew, desperate for anything to give them an edge on an already devastating and very costly war, Langaran military scientists—with the help of a few civilian contractors—had developed what they termed a Super Soldier serum, a compound designed to enhance a soldier's strength and physical agility in the hopes that these enhanced soldiers would be able to turn the tide of the war that much faster. As a small and rather sickly child who had grown into a small and still rather sickly young man, Steve hadn't even been under consideration to get the special serum until Colonel Phillips showed up at his ma's house late one night after curfew. Steve vividly remembered how they had locked themselves in his father's old study for nearly half the night, discussing various things back and forth in increasingly loud voices that finally came to a head when his mother yelled at Phillips that he knew it was what Joseph—Steve's father—would've wanted, and that Phillips at least owed him that.
"I see," said JARVIS. "And may I inquire as to the purpose of this deception?"
"Thank you, sir."
"So you've mentioned," said Dad. "Tonight, okay, buddy?"
"Oh my God, are you okay?" Gwen exclaimed as she rushed closer, a pile of books in her arms and her pretty eyes wide with shock. Peter immediately nodded, leaning against the bank of lockers as he gingerly palmed the sore spot on his head, his heart thudding madly.
"What's up, big guy?"
"Colonel Phillips also called me this afternoon, Tony," said Sam. "As soon as Steve was airborne. Told us the whole thing."
Tony watched as Bucky shot Steve a rather goofy smirk. "Is that what Stevie told ya?"
"All right," Steve said with a nod. "You all know your assignments. Since we won't know what to expect until we're all in the air, don't forget to watch out for each other. The number one goal is for Carol and I to exit the atmosphere with all of our satellites intact, so be aware that the two of us will not be engaging in any dogfighting unless we have no other choice."
With a final nod, Wanda trotted off as Peter headed for the huge, arena-like area, his eyes widening in shock as one of the Hammer suits flew by him, repulsors aimed and firing right at Dad's heels, the left of which was sputtering slightly. He quickly launched a web, grabbing the suit around its ankle and digging his heels into the hard concrete floor.
Actually, now that he thought about it, Tony often had various books strewn about his workplaces at home, as did Peter, and actually Steve often did as well, but that was because he still felt more comfortable with books than electronic references, not because he was a genius.
"Thanks."
"Uh, just Papa," answered Peter. "Dad's busy working on some stuff with Uncle Bruce."
"Jesus, Steve, you're not crashing a date if we invite you along," Sam retorted. He began to slow down his pace as they approached one of the park's entrances, which Steve reluctantly followed. He didn't feel done quite yet, or at least didn't feel like he'd run off enough of his stress yet, and had half a mind to ask Sam if he could take off for a couple more laps when Sam grabbed onto his arm, halting him.
Steve loved him, and he loved Steve. And while he hadn't exactly meant to blurt out that little factoid in the heat of the moment like he had, after Steve's earnest confession Tony just hadn't been able to contain it any longer. Somehow, in only a few short weeks, Steve had managed to tear down all of the iron walls that Tony had so carefully constructed around his heart in the years since Peter's birth. Tony had resigned himself to being alone ever since Peter's heart diagnosis, and for the most part he had been okay with it. He had been fine with pouring everything that he had into his son because he had to ensure that someday Peter would be able to get the operation that he so desperately needed.
"Yeah," Tony whispered. Sometimes it was so easy to get lost in his own grief, he would forget that millions of others around the world were experiencing the very same thing as him and Steve.
"And you're sure that your friend's mother is home?" Papa asked.
"Yep. I'll be here." Tony's heart fluttered as Steve pressed his fingers to his lips, then to the screen before it went blank, something he did whenever they were separated.
"Yeah, I know," Steve whispered. His heart leapt into his throat as the processional music began, with all of the seated guests turning to watch as Peter led Ma up the centre aisle to her seat on Steve's side. Howard was already in his seat on Tony's side, along with his date for the wedding, the woman Steve had hired to clean out his house.
"Yeah, I kinda figured that," Tony said softly. "But you still don't wanna talk about it?"
Whoever it was that had kept HYDRA's records at that Mongolian base had apparently written down freaking everything
"Oh, really?" said Carol. "And here I thought the pretty yellow flash of light was just for show!"
"You doing okay, bud?" asked Dad. He looked exhausted too, with deep purple circles under his eyes. Peter highly doubted he and Papa had been getting much sleep lately.
Finished with his dusting, Steve crossed the item off of his list and checked the clock.  Only ten more minutes till closing time, and then he could go home with his boyfriend and the boy he thought of as his son and cook them all a homemade lasagna dinner.
be," Tony said rapidly. "He
—Tony picked up his stack of diagrams and notes and was just about to exit the lab when JARVIS spoke up again.
"Very good, sir."
"Ahh," Papa said with a short laugh. "Yeah, that was only a week or so after my procedure, so neither of us were quite used to it yet."
"So, you wanna tell me what's wrong?" she asked as they headed out of the gym. "I don't think I've ever seen you drop your pen as many times as you did today during practise, and you've been acting funny ever since you got to school."
"Well, we don't necessarily know how long it's gonna take," said Steve. "But if you're sure—"
“Goddamnit, Nick, who hired the fucking scientists?” yelled Tony.
Which, since it would be out in space it would be already difficult—impossible—anyway, but if the Langaran military government could be summed up in any single word it would be 'paranoid', so Peter needed to make sure that he left no room for any of their excess paranoia to possibly hinder the project.
"Okay, but I'm not sure if we should push that too hard anymore, especially after the committee meeting and now this bill. I think our main focus should be finishing the decryption of those files, and searching for a hard connection between HYDRA and Justin Hammer."
"It'd just be for the summer, Peter," Gwen said, as if she'd read his mind. "If I got it, which is still a pretty big if, I'd leave for England three days after the end of school and get back about three or four days before our senior year starts up."
Mags’s entire face lights up so brightly that Tony’s convinced she almost tripped the power circuits.
Papa's eyes crinkled at the corners as he laughed. "Well, you do eventually get used to them. It also helps that most of the time I was wearing a flight suit, and not my full dress uniform."
"I'd actually like to begin with some questions specifically for Captain Rogers," Davis said.
"We'll meet you all down in the lobby," Steve said.
"Good. And don't forget to give us a hug before you go."
With a frustrated grunt, Steve pursed his lips.
Plus, aside from Uncle Thor, Uncle Bucky was Peter's favourite person to arm-wrestle with.
"All right, bud. Have fun, yeah?"
The work helped to keep his mind occupied, Stacy had told Steve yesterday, but Steve could tell that underneath his tough exterior, the man was barely holding on.
"Yeah, Captain?" asked Tony.
"Yes, I can understand that," said Steve. "And I've already told your father that you're welcome to stay as long as you like. I know Agents Barton and Romanoff have been very grateful for his help."
"Yes, sir," Steve and Little Steve both said simultaneously. "
"I love you too, little guy. Sleep well."
The doctor's words reverberated inside Steve's throbbing head, and he dropped his chin to his chest, pressing his palms against his temples. He couldn't tell if the doctor didn't know about Peter's extraordinary genetic makeup or if he was just not mentioning it, but in that moment nothing terrified Steve more than the thought of Peter sitting in one of these cells instead of him.
Tony grinned, pecking Steve's lips one final time. "Well, then,
He supposed it didn't matter, because he deserved every single bit of it. Every single dram of misery and pain, because he hadn't done enough to stop it.
The guy shrugged. "Well, I dunno. Maybe 'cause they royally screwed something up the first time around?"
"Yeah, maybe, but this is
He had honestly been surprised that he'd been able to sleep at all, especially since his—and Tony's as well—sleep had been so horrible for the last several days. He'd been prepared to lie awake the whole night, to just hold Tony close as his mind ran though their complicated plan over and over again. It wasn't until Tony had already fallen asleep and he'd been just on the cusp of it that Steve realised there really was no point for him to dwell on it. Their plan, although complicated, was sound, with every person involved committed to it one hundred percent.
“Uh huh,” Peter said sadly.  Pushing himself up to his feet, Peter launched himself at Steve, hugging him tightly around his waist.  “Have a good night, Steve.  Thanks for coming.”
As evenings go, it wasn't too bad. They ate dinner with Peter, as they usually did, and then Tony headed back to his lab, determined to get Igor figured out before he and Steve went to bed. They had struck up a bargain once Steve's weird dreams had started that they would try and go to bed together every night, thinking it would help them both get more—and better—sleep, and so far it had worked out fairly well.
"Tony," Steve said gently. "One of my ma's good friends cleans houses for a living. If you want, I could ask her to stop by the house in the next couple of days and check on your father for you?"
“So about two hundred and forty doses per day,” said Tony.  “Enough to stock a field hospital out in the middle of Sokovia, yeah?”
Steve pursed his lips, fiddling with his bottle cap. Bucky had said something similar way back when Riley was killed, and Steve had just brushed it off as him venting some of his anger and frustration over losing another teammate. But if he and Sam were still actively discussing it then that likely meant they weren't the only ones, which also likely meant that—
"Yes, I believe we were," he practically growled as he dipped his head to find Tony's lips, slipping a hand underneath Tony's shirt to tug it off. Tony let out a gasp as Steve slid his palms up Tony's bare chest, his legs instinctively hiking up to hook over Steve's hips as his hands slid down Steve's back to grip his glorious ass.
"He's not exactly in a coma," Dr Cho said, and Steve nearly collapsed in relief. "But he's not exactly just asleep either. I've actually never seen readings like this in anyone else…" She paused, giving her head a slight shake. "Peter's brain wave patterns are alternating between two and four Hz, which is consistent with deep sleep in a child, but there are occasional dips down to zero, which is below the frequency for the delta waves usually seen during the deepest stages of sleep." She pointed to the computer printout, marking the various peaks with her pen. "Now, these dips do seem to follow a similar pattern to the EEGs I took shortly before Peter regained consciousness down in Miami, so whatever happened to him tonight doesn't appear to be as severe a blow, but—"
After an answering squeeze, Steve continued.  “February 15th, 2019.  I and what’s left of my team finally arrive at the field hospital.  After they stabilise him as best as they can with their limited medical supplies, Sergeant Barnes is prepped for transport back to the U.S.  The rest of us are ordered to go with him pending investigation of the explosions following the sniper shots.”  Steve paused again, his throat bobbing as he swallowed.  “An investigation that ended up going nowhere, Mr Stane, as even the very concept of an exploding bullet was deemed ‘too outrageous’ to be legitimate.”
"So, how's Dad doing?" Peter asked once Steve finally released him. "Seems like he's healing just fine."
"She's going to have to," answered Dr Strange. "As I'm sure you've all already realised, Thanos' resolve to obtain the Time Stone will be formidable, which means we absolutely cannot underestimate him. With the Time Stone in hand, Thanos can manipulate time to his heart's content, no matter what the outcome of the rest of the battle down on Earth."
"So, now you're telling me that I stink?" Bucky asked as they headed towards the shed housing the golf carts, just as Wanda, Natasha, and Clint took off towards the Compound's residential building. The nearly three-kilometre-wide training dome was situated a good kilometre away from the rest of the Compound's structures, just in case something happened to go badly wrong during one of their training exercises.
Which would make him around twenty-seven now.  An entire decade younger than Tony.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
Howard's shoulders sagged, his eyes flicking guiltily to the glass in his hand.
"Did you run that diagnostic yet, JARVIS?" Tony asked as he closed out the holograms.
"But not trustworthy enough to share your tech with us?" Tony asked. "Even after everything we've told you?"
Natasha rolled her eyes, giving Clint another sharp elbow to the leg before getting to her feet. "C'mon, Hawkeye. Wheels up at 0500, and I still have to bleach my hair."
"Thanks. I'll see you soon." And then he stood up from the bed, took hold of his shield from its spot by their door, and stepped out of the room, finally allowing Tony to release the floodgate of tears that he'd been desperately holding back.
"Wait, it was already on the news?" Peter hadn't turned on the TV at all since Dad had gotten home the night before, but if the news was already reporting it then it was likely that the entire world had already heard about it, which meant there was probably an entire army of reporters camped down at the base of the Tower, waiting for a statement.
And it wouldn’t just be limited to defibrillators.  Theoretically, as long as Tony’s math was correct, the possible uses of the new power source were endless, which meant that the sky was literally the limit as to what Tony could do with it.
"Hello, Peter," said Steve, attempting a smile. This boy was obviously far, far sicker than Tyler had ever been, and Steve wasn't quite sure he was comfortable with that yet. "My name is Steve."
"Don't, Tony!" Rhodey hissed when Tony took another step forward. "You know he's just trying to bait you, don't give into it!"
Steve scowled, his hands clenching into tight fists. "That's ridiculous. So basically they're living a lie just to buy votes?"
“Um…”  Tony’s fingers tighten around Steve’s shoulder as he burrows impossibly closer.  “I know this probably isn't the best time to be asking this, but—”
"I don't mind watching you," Steve said with a rather wry grin. He tilted his head, trailing his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. "Maybe we can even talk a bit while you work?"
"Dad?" Peter asked as he bounced impatiently on his feet, his huge brown eyes filled to the brim with curiosity and excitement. "What do you think?"
"I was gonna blow you," Tony managed to get out as Steve's nimble fingers slipped between his legs, already slick with lube that he'd somehow managed to grab in between kisses. He choked on another moan as Steve carefully pushed two of those fingers inside him, peppering kisses all along his inner thighs and the base of his cock as he gently worked him open.
"'Cause Hank told me that some guy was trying to steal something from his company, some old apprentice of his," said Lang. He huffed out a sharp breath, chewing nervously on his lip. "Look, I'm really, really sorry that I tried to break into your house. Hank told me that it was just some old warehouse that Howard Stark used to own, so—"
"Whoa!" Peter exclaimed as his fingers curled around her arm, preventing her from hitting the floor. He immediately hauled her back to her feet, overcompensating enough that Gwen ended up planting her palms on his chest to prevent them both from tipping in the other direction.
Tony cried as he came, gripping Steve's hair for dear life as he flooded Steve's mouth. Garbled nonsense words fell from his lips as Steve's calloused fingertips trailed up and down his side, his entire body buzzing with residual current.
"Copy that," Steve said softly.
"Well, I'm glad that the two of you hit it off," said Sharon. "He's such a sweetie, isn't he?"
if I hadn't been able to—"
"I—" Steve started, then stopped, gulping as he looked towards the centre of the lake, his panic spiking when there was still no sign of Peter or Tony.
Before everything started careening straight down into the deepest pits of hell, never to recover.
"Um… what exactly is it that they do?" asked Peter.
And, as it turned out, both Peter and Dad were right. Dad's phone call with the convoy foreman ended up being quick and easy, Papa's dinner turned out amazing, as usual, and Peter was able to finish all of his homework in time to help Dad out in the lab before bed. They were working on developing a portable repulsor, one that could be launched in groups with the theory that they could be used to help stabilise airplanes experiencing engine failures or other similar issues. Dad had already successfully tested out a prototype at the Compound recently, which managed to keep the Quinjet level enough for a smooth emergency landing after a simulated engine failure, even, as Dad liked to point out, with Uncle Clint at the controls.
Tony thought.
"Oh Christ, Barton, you're just unbelievable," grumbled Tony as Clint stepped inside the bathroom, followed by Bucky and Sam. "Did you guys manage to find anything?"
"Oh. Well, can I help?" Peter asked. "You know I'm pretty good with decrypting stuff."
"There's the right answer, bud," said Dad. "Now, I'm sure you've got homework?"
To Peter's shock, instead of being pleased at his remark, Dad's face fell, like he was suddenly ashamed of something. He turned back to his workstation, mumbling under his breath as he typed.
“I don't want you just sitting there and staring at me,” Peter cut in.  “I’m fine, and I know you probably have work to do, so… just please go on and do it.”
It was almost funny how quickly he and Steve shot to their feet, nearly tripping over each other in their mad scramble to pack up their picnic items and race over to the barracks. As soon as they reached the building, Steve grabbed Tony around the waist, peppering his face and neck with kisses as he fumbled for his ID badge to unlock the door.
"Restlessness?" Steve asked with a frown. "What do you mean, like a nightmare?"
Peter nodded, tossing an offhand, "Uh huh" as he hurried down the hall to his bedroom. As soon as he'd closed the door behind him he tore into the package, a wide smile stretching across his lips as he pulled out the oversized fluffy hooded sweatshirt printed with the Oxford University crest, with the words Somebody At Oxford Loves Me surrounding it.
"Um, I'm really sorry to interrupt, Mr Stark, but I think I might've found something else here," Gwen cut in from her spot on the floor. She turned the computer around, pointing to several lines of code. "It looks like Peter wrote this during school today."
"Mmm," he moaned as Tony pressed his ass up against him again, his full lips curling into a rather smug smirk even as his eyes stayed closed. Steve tilted his head, his lips brushing across the shell of Tony's ear as he whispered, "And you call me a tease?"
Steve gasped, managing to inhale a soap bubble which immediately caused him to choke.
Tony cleared his throat, giving Phillips what he hoped was an appreciative nod as he set the first of his slides into the overhead projector and switched it on.
"Well," Tony said as he reached for his coffee cup. "There ya go."
"Yeah, thanks, J."
Peter rolled his eyes. "Dad, I said it's okay. You used to say a lot worse before Papa came along."
Or at least, Papa sure made it seem that way.
"Pete, just get him inside!" Tony yelled as Peter pushed backwards, landing onto the hard floor with Strange still in tow. Tony quickly sealed the hole closed, collapsing onto the floor next to Peter once it was done.
"Dad!" Peter choked out, his vision already transforming into the honeycomb-like state it assumed when he could no longer keep his focus. "Dad, help!"
So why did Steve do it?  And what’s he been up to since then?  Was he able to get some help for whatever injury he was suffering from?
"No, no, you don't understand," Tony insisted, shaking his head. He pushed against Steve's chest, grunting in annoyance when Steve's arms held him fast. "I can't—I need to get my suit finished, and then I need to get working on yours, and then—"
Opening the door, Tony was pleased to see that he had been spot on with his assessment.  Not only was Obie sitting at his grand desk puffing on one of his smelly cigars, but he was even leaning back in his chair, resting his perfectly polished black Berluti loafers on top of it like he didn't have a single care in the entire world.
"You're not interrupting, Nat," Steve said attempting to force a smile, and failing miserably. "What's up?"
He had just turned back to face the others when a sharp breeze suddenly blew through the hole in the ceiling, accompanied by flying papers and leaves and a loud, groaning noise that reminded Steve way too much of the
"Peter Stark," he barked at the hospital operator, not even attempting to be polite. Tony tapped his fingers impatiently on his desk while he waited, his eyes flicking up to the drawing of Mrs Bird and her three chicks as a mental portrait of Steve and Peter sitting together in his hospital room chatting as they sketched formed in his mind, almost against his will.
But… that was impossible, wasn't it? Tony and Peter had both told Steve numerous times that despite everything that he'd seen in Star Trek, not even the greatest scientific minds in the world had managed to figure out how to safely teleport people yet.
"You two ready to go?" he asked as he looked between Sam and Bucky, both dressed in uniforms that Tony built for them. Tony had even managed to sandblast the red Soviet Union star off the upper part of Bucky's prosthetic arm, which now sported the same big
"Christ, baby, you're incredible," Tony murmured into Steve's shoulder, his fingertips trailing along Steve's sweaty back and sides. Steve raised his head, softly kissing Tony's lips before carefully pulling out of him and rolling onto his back, gathering Tony into his arms and drawing the sheets up over them. He knew they should probably get cleaned up and get something to eat before Peter and the others got back, but he was too relaxed, too content, too satiated at the moment to even want to move, much less attempt to make it into the shower that seemed way too far away at the moment.
"Looking pretty snazzy up there, Cap!" Sam called from his spot about a metre or so away from Bucky. "Are ya ready to get started?"
"Oh, honey," Tony whispered as he opened his arms, drawing Steve close, his fingers slipping underneath the hem of his t-shirt to ghost across the skin of his lower back right above his waistline. Steve shivered at the light touch, burying his nose into Tony's thick hair and breathing in.
“Yeah, yeah, chop chop,” added Tony.  “Papa’s got some hot chocolate to make.”
Several seconds passed as Joseph waited, his eyes burning with the effort of looking into the white-hot sunlight until suddenly the aircraft appeared again, its afterburners going full-blast as it dove straight down, heading directly for the location of the power plant.
"Well, that's because Chester is a good man who's unfortunately stuck in a bad situation," Grandma stated. "The same of which could probably be said about your father."
"Good," said Steve. "Then you have a go."
"Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me. Pete's always bending over backwards trying to help. He gets that from Steve."
"Tony, I haven't done anything! I swear it!" Steve exclaimed, his Adam's apple bobbing as he gulped. He took another step towards Tony, halting again when Tony raised his palm.
And the fact that neither he nor Steve would be able to visit Peter for at least the next couple of days was already causing Tony's anxiety level to ratchet up even more. As long as nothing went wrong, Steve and Carol's mission was scheduled to last a little less than three days since they would only be deploying one satellite each per orbital rotation. And while Tony knew that he might be able to sneak away from the base for a bit as long as everything was stable, there still was a very good chance that it wouldn't be.
The big hotshot pilot was not only hotter than hell, he was also a master cuddler. And that happened to suit Tony just fine.
"That is exactly correct, Your Highness," said Thor. "And if that is indeed the case, then—"
“Here we are,” he murmured as they reached the door.  Still grasping Tony’s hand, Steve unlocked it and held it open so Tony could step inside, turning to him as soon as it closed.
"Oh," Peter squeaked. "Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's only one Oxford."
as though Steve was a piece of him that he didn't know he'd been missing until he found him.
"You do?" Steve asked eagerly. "How long are you thinking?"
expert. He was the only person studying it at the time. Or at least the only one on our side."
mantra, but for the moment, it’s all Steve’s got.
Tony murmured, his brown eyes sparkling in the bright spring sun shining in through the training dome's windows. "If you must insist, then yes. You are the finest time-traveller I've ever seen. So do me a favour and be careful in there, yeah? 'Cause I'd kinda like it if you came back in one piece."
"So he's just using the Chitauri as his own personal shields," Tony muttered, wrinkling his nose in disgust. He supposed he shouldn't be too surprised. Thanos had essentially used Loki as his own personal errand boy during the Battle of New York, giving him the guise of commanding the Chitauri army as a way to both stoke Loki's bruised ego and ensure his compliance.
"Yep," said Quill, causing Tony's belly to drop to his knees. "That's his only goal."
"Of course it was," Steve said as he shook Stacy's hand. "Tony and I have arranged a car to take you and Gwen back to the city whenever you're ready."
"Sam?" he asked, choking off a sob when Natasha gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head.
"Tony!" Steve yelped, rereading the sentence again just to make sure he wasn't seeing things. "Look—!"
And then their Malibu house got blown up, and everything started going to shit.
perfect."
"Yes, I do," Tony said with wide eyes. "Pete's okay, though?"
"Something—something's happening!"
Steve thought, blinking back tears. Even though it was still the early twenties and the Great Depression had not yet hit, his and Ma's finances were precarious, forcing Ma to carefully budget each week to ensure they didn't slip into the red. So for her to sacrifice an entire quarter's worth of food or medicine to allow Steve to buy something that one might consider rather frivolous was absolutely nothing to sneeze at.
But at the moment, all Tony cared about was what she was carrying in her right hand.  A large, steaming mug of coffee.
If the potential he saw in Peter is real, and not just Steve’s imagination, then he owes it to Peter to not do anything that might jeopardise it.  And that includes potentially attempting to date Peter’s father when he still doesn’t have his own head on straight.
"That's it!" Quill said as Dad landed next to Thanos, looking up as Dr Strange raised his arms towards the sky and opened another portal, allowing Mantis to drop right onto Thanos' shoulders.
"Mmm," Steve murmured. "Now we're gettin' somewhere."
The sonic
"Well, good, 'cause I'm definitely gonna hold you to that," Tony said. He pressed a long, lingering kiss to Steve's lips, trailing his thumb across his cheekbone. "C'mon, honey. I bet Pete's already getting suspicious."
"T-Tony?" Scott stammered, glancing furtively at Steve. "Uhh…"
Steve gasped, his face flushing hot. "Sweetheart, I'm already having enough trouble controlling myself here. I don't need you making things worse!"
Thor gave a nod. "I do indeed. It is my belief that this secret place, Wakanda, might be the home to one of the six infinity stones."
And ever since then, Tony had been far too wary of trusting any potential romantic partners.  Especially since it wasn’t only his own heart on the line anymore, but Peter’s as well.
"Good," Steve said softly. He handed Tony the soup spoon, waiting nervously for him to take the first spoonful. Peter had told him it was delicious, but from what Steve had seen over the last year, Peter was far less picky about his food than Tony was.
"We need to protect the stone!" Steve yelled as he launched his shield at another speeder, causing it to crash right into one of the flying whale-like things. "We need to keep Thanos away from the Soul Stone!"
"Before you went to… wait, where'd he take off to?" asked Dad.
Trust Natasha to remember stuff like dances and corsages when she, Clint, and Bucky had just gotten back from yet another raid, this time to several small islands off the Alaskan mainland.
"Oh yeah? And how long did you and Sam wait?" Steve demanded, regretting the question almost as soon as it left his mouth. "Wait, you don't have to answer—"
"This has to be it!" Peter croaked past his dry throat. He knew that HYDRA had stolen the designs to Dad's Iron Legion, so if they had managed to build some of their own using the Chitauri tech, then…
Steve watched as Wong and Dr Strange exchanged loaded glances. "What? Is there something else you need to tell us?"
"No, Clint, they're just as human as we are," Steve answered, with only a touch of impatience. "And since we've already verified the coordinates twice, I think asking a third time might be pushing it a little. Wouldn't you agree?"
Well,
"Tony—" he managed, only for Tony to quickly shush him.
“Sleeping with the—okay, you know that entire thing was arranged by Obie,” Tony pointed out.  “And anyway, that’s completely besides the point here.  All I wanna know is how in the hell did you know that Steve would say yes?”
"Um…" he stammered, gasping again at a particularly horrible twinge of pain. He pushed himself back from the table, calling out a belated, "Please excuse me," as he stumbled towards the hallway bathroom, managing to make it just in time to barf up the entire contents of his stomach into the toilet.
Or, maybe not-so-secretly wishes, if Natasha’s pointed glances and particularly sharp pokes in his side whenever Tony laughs at one of his corny jokes are any indications.
"I'll talk to Tony," he whispered.
"It's only a stupid chest cold, honey, and I absolutely refuse to go anywhere just for a goddamn chest cold," Tony stated. "It's no big deal, Steve. I'll be back to normal in a couple of days."
"Put him through, please, JARVIS," said Steve.
"Okay, then if that's the case where does all of 'our' money go, hmm?" asked Sam. "'Cause I sure as hell don't see most of it. In fact—"
"Hey, I said he was cool first!" protested Simon. "I mean, did you see the way he stopped that runaway car that one time? That was way cool!"
Their cozy little bubble had popped. It was now time to face reality.
“How ‘bout all the calls except for Pepper, yeah?” Dad finally said.  “You know she doesn’t bug us unless it’s a real emergency, so—”
"Honey, we don't have to do this tonight," Tony murmured. "It's late, and you're just about zonked, so—"
How could anyone rest in a situation like that? It was too much to ask. Even of a super-soldier.
“I’m pretty sure you already know the answer to that question,” Fury replied with a severe frown.  “But, like I already said, it doesn't do a damn bit of good to dwell on it now.  We only need to focus on finding Rogers.”
"He—he's got a heart condition," Tony forced past the knot in his throat. "ASD and partial anomalous PVR."
Steve choked out, completely wrecked as he gave Tony's hair a hard yank. "Sweetheart, I'm gonna—"
"I know, sweetheart," Steve said as he tugged off his shirt, heat searing across his body with every touch of Tony's calloused fingertips. "I
"Oh will you just shut the hell up, Syler?" Chester snapped over the comm. "Everyone knows that a tonic water isn't worth a damn thing unless it's got at least two limes in it!"
"Way to go, kiddo!" Sam called from Tony's right as Peter retook his seat with the rest of his team. He leaned in, giving Tony a gentle nudge with his elbow. "That kid of yours is pretty incredible, Tony."
, babe, have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? But having abs of steel and arms strong enough to lift the Quinjet still doesn't disqualify you from nightmares, as not-awesome as that is. And, if I do say so, you're usually so concerned about everyone else's mental health that you tend to forget about your own."
"Yeah, I guess I can do that," Tony muttered. "You can just elbow me or something whenever you need my input."
Sighing, Tony drew Peter into a gentle hug, kissing the top of his head. "Pete—"
"What kind of meeting?" demanded Dad, his hands clenching into fists. "He's not gonna try and blame Steve for this, is he? 'Cause that's just—"
Steve’s heart skips at least three beats as he scans down the results again.  And then again, hoping that somehow he’s just misread them.
"Not yet, mo grá," Steve said, his voice so rough and husky that Tony couldn't help but let out an absolutely wanton moan. "Not gonna hurt you."
"That's 'cause you're stronger than they are, bud," Tony murmured. "You're way stronger than any of those assholes."
He just couldn't bear the thought of going back to his home, knowing that Peter would never be there again, never greet him with a "Hey, Papa!" and one of his million-watt smiles. Never see him racing through the hallways as he and Pietro hurried out to play frisbee golf in the yard, or work on one of their new training programs. Never cook another meal with him in the kitchen, or hear him ask Steve to watch a movie, or play chess, or help him with his history homework.
“My dear Captain Rogers,” he said, still chuckling.  “Surely you don't honestly believe that Dr Erskine wanted his work to die with you?”
“Steve,” Tony says, drumming his fingertips on the table.  “He told us to call him Steve, remember?”
"He's doing great," Steve said as he grabbed several of the plumpest, juiciest figs he'd ever seen, adding them to his growing pile of fruit. "Shuri said we should be able to go home tomorrow."
"That is correct," Gwen said, flashing her million-watt smile at him. "And do you know the man's name who started it?"
“Cap, I’m in position,” he whispers over the comm.  “On your mark.”
"No, Dad, I didn't mean it like that." Peter must've been more tired than he realised to bring up Grandpa when Dad was in such a good mood. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't've mentioned him."
"Yeah, I'll try and call tonight no matter what, okay? If I can't, I'll just see you in school tomorrow."
But still, the arm seemed to enjoy aching, and the annoying constant tingly sensation was absolutely not helping Tony's patience.
a sweet sight to wake up to," he murmured, his face still partially smashed into Steve's pillow. Steve loved how Tony always seemed to take over Steve's side of the bed after he got up. "Can you just stay like right there for about the next hour or so?"
" Steve nearly sobbed. "If you—if you don't mind, I'd—I'd—I mean, we still don't know if they—if they made it, but—"
And especially a question that he wasn't even sure if he were allowed to answer.
“Pete—”
Tearing his eyes away from Tony, Steve purses his lips, pointing to one of the perimeter corners.  “I say we start here, on the northwest corner.  If we can take out the guards there quiet-like, then hopefully we can keep the rest of ‘em from sounding some sort of alarm.”
"Yep," Peter said proudly. Steve was definitely a fast learner. "From what you guys have said the people in Meridia are starting to catch up with our tech, so we’ve gotta make sure that no one'll be able to break into JARVIS's programming."
“All right, just hold your horses.”  Dad’s eyebrows knitted together as he positioned the glasses on Papa’s face, giving his nose a playful tweak once he was done.  “Well, what do you know?  Even those ugly glasses look gorgeous on you.”
"So?" Peter asked once he'd fastened the button, turning to face Tony. "How do I look?"
Well, not
Steve reached for Tony's hand across the table. "I do know, Tony. My ma's life didn't end up going the way that she'd planned either."
"Look, I know you can't stand the guy, but you gotta admit that the stuff he put out was always way better 'n yours. I mean, the military didn't even give you the time of day until he pulled out of the weapons business, so—no—no—that's not what I meant, just—yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I said I'll get it done, which means it'll get done. Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know."
But instead of flipping to the drawing of the Harley Davidson he still had yet to finish, Steve turned to a clean page and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes so he could conjure up an image of Tony Stark in his mind's eye.  Steve’s lips curled into a soft smile as he slotted all of the details into place, focusing in on certain aspects of Tony’s features that had stood out the most.
Barely three seconds later, Tony jumped back with a yelp as a fully-grown man suddenly appeared next to Clint and Pietro, dressed in some kind of comic book-looking armour and wearing a helmet that resembled those worn by early twentieth century deep-sea divers.
But before he could even finish his sentence, people began pouring out of the circles and onto the plain, lining up behind Alt-Steve as if they were awaiting his orders. Wizards, Asgardians, a greyish, heavily-tattooed alien who looked like he'd just stepped out of a ring at the WWE—
said Mr O'Carl as he patted Little Steve on the top of his head. "
Maybe Natasha actually
"Uh huh," Peter said with a nod. "Have a nice day off."
"It's just a standard barracks room," added Steve, once again mistaking Tony's silence for hesitation. "I—"
Steve thought as he drew in a slow, deep breath, closing his eyes.
"I quite agree, sir."
Tony thought, the Steve-influenced, optimistic part of him peeking its head from behind the iron curtain that had dropped the day that Peter died in his arms. Because he supposed if he could look at their task from the perspective of it being a course correction instead of fix, then maybe—
"I know, sweetheart, but we owe it to him to help him get through this." A knot the size of a marble rose in Steve's throat, his own eyes burning with unshed tears. "We have to see it through, Tony, we have to!"
"Ah, no," Carol said. "But since I have a tendency to fly through ships, I usually try to avoid them."
It hadn't been at all surprising that Bucky had barely taken one look at Steve during their morning briefing and realised something was wrong. Steve had begged him off, not wanting to get into it before their patrol began, even as Bucky had warned him that he maybe shouldn't be flying if he was in that much emotional distress.
Tony was his lifeline. There was no way he could let go of him.
Good thing he always left plenty of lines between items, or he would’ve had to rewrite the entire thing.
“All right, honey, just get yourself comfy there,” Dad said as Papa settled in on the squashy white chair in the lab.  The chair, one that Dad had designed specifically for this test, was supposed to resemble a real-world version of the ONI immersion booth from
"Oh my God," Peter breathed as he continued to read what was essentially a mini history lesson on the evolution of HYDRA, from its beginnings centuries ago as a religious cult, worshipping something or someone called Hive, through its conversion to the draconian anti-freedom principles that were influenced by Johann Schmidt and continued on by Arnim Zola after Schmidt was defeated by Papa.
“All right.  Just… don’t be gone too long, okay?  There might be something else in here that we don’t know about.”
"Tony," Tony said. "Most people call me Tony."
There was a pause for a couple minutes while they both picked at their food, until Gwen spoke up again. "So, I found out some more stuff about Liz's dad, if you're interested."
Peter grimaced, glancing sheepishly at Strange. "Well, if what Dr Strange just said is true about how fast we're going, then we'd first have to figure out how to drop out of warp. We can't make course corrections while we're at warp speed, Dad."
"Oh for Christ's sake, I'm not telling you to ask Pete for help. All I'm saying is that it's okay for you to admit to him what he already knows. He already knows that you have nightmares. He already knows that you spend hours down in the gym punching the hell outta your punching bags until your knuckles bleed and the floor's covered in sand. He already knows that you run so much that you're blowing through three pairs of shoes in a month, and he already knows that absolutely none of this is helping you to get better!" He paused, weighing his next words very carefully. "And what you're showing him by doing those things, is that it's okay to try and sideswipe your problems instead of facing them head-on. And Pete already gets enough of that from me, Steve, he doesn't need it from you too."
"Just tell me the goddamn truth!" Phillips yelled, and Steve's belly gave a swoop at the colonel's tone, brash as per his usual, but also with an underlying measure of fear that Steve had never before heard.
"All right, bud," Tony said as he patted Peter's foot. "Are ya ready?"
"Why do all of the crises have to happen in the middle of the night?" Peter said as he packed his laptop into his backpack. "Why can't something like this ever happen during normal business hours?"
"Yeah, sweetheart, I'm fine," he murmured. Tony shot him one of Peter's
"Greetings, my dear friends," Thor cut in as he clapped Steve on the arm so hard that it nearly knocked him sideways. "I must apologise for my abrupt entrance, I'm afraid my landings tend to be a bit touchy without my hammer."
He felt Tony's hand suddenly jerk in his own as Howard called out ninety percent. "Steve, honey, you're squeezing my hand too hard—"
Tony shoots him a frown.  “Really?  You're still going on about that when you're sitting there bleeding all over yourself?”
"How's your inspection of the satellites coming?"
Tony's lips curled into a sneer.
He was brought back to reality by Gwen's fingers snapping in front of his nose. "Earth to Peter?" she said with a giggle. "Where'd you go?"
"There's a federal marshall waiting for you and Captain Rogers on the tarmac, sir, she says she has something important to give you," he said. "I asked her what it was but she wouldn't tell me, I don't know what you wanna do."
"Nearly one and a half litres, Captain," answered JARVIS.
"So tell him to send all the data they've managed to compile over to Bruce's lab, and he and I can take a look at it in the morning after we get Pete to school, yeah?" said Tony. He tipped his head up, planting a kiss on Steve's jaw. "Problem solved."
"Yes, Peter looked up both of those guys," said Sam. "And based on what he found, both of them were conducting experiments on the very same device that we're planning to use for our mission."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough already," said Tony. "The fact still remains that Fury told you that whatever this was doesn't need to concern us, and yet you're still making it our concern."
"Gwen, I know, and I really appreciate it, okay," Peter said. "I'm just—I guess when I'm with you I'd just like to be more… normal. Just be myself, without all the superhero stuff. Does that make any sense?" He didn't add that the vision of Gwen crashing to the ground had rattled him a lot more than he wanted to admit, and that he had already thought way too much about the possibility of some future bad guy intentionally targeting her just for being his girl. Obie had targeted Papa for the exact same thing, so Peter knew he wasn't just being paranoid.
"Grandpa!" Tony hissed, his left hand clenching into a fist. "According to the military leaders Grandpa doesn't even exist anymore,
And Steve has absolutely no intention of being the latter.
Barely even blinking, Tony watched as Dr Goldman returned, informing the shocked nurse that he'd gotten a hold of Tony Stark, and that he would be arriving at some point during the night. Then he tweaked a setting on one of Peter's monitors and left again, presumably to wait in his office for Tony's arrival.
Peter’s first meet!  And he blew everyone away! ♥️
that! So why can't I fight too? Why can't I stand up for myself against the bullies just like you and Dad?"
Tears welled in Steve's burning eyes, rolling down his cheeks before he even realised they were there. "But—but… fathers are supposed to be strong, and—"
"Understood, sir."
"Yeah, I remember you telling me some stuff when we were still studying World War II," Peter said. "He seems like he was a pretty cool guy."
“No, no, it’s not that.”  Steve huffs out a sharp breath, wishing that he could somehow press ‘pause’ on this conversation so he could better organise his thoughts.  “It’s just—I’m not—”
Tony shook his head, wishing with all his might that Peter was wrong.
"Yeah, and Bucky is well aware of that, Clint," Sam said warily. "He and I have talked at length about it, and he's willing to take the risk. It doesn't do anyone any good to stay cooped up inside all the damn time."
"So, based on the feedback that we've received from the flight reports and after a detailed analysis of the data, the Air Corps decided to go ahead with the next phase in aircraft design." Tony paused for dramatic effect as he placed the next slide on the projector, his lips quirking into a slight grin in anticipation.
Steve smiled into Tony's hair. "Back in my day, being invited to a girl's house for dinner meant that you were pretty serious about her."
Tony waved a dismissive hand. "None of that will matter unless I can get Steve back."
"Nothing," the doctor had replied, with such a dismissive shrug that Peter had been very tempted to launch his pencil right at her head. "All we're doing now is prolonging the inevitable and putting his father further and further into debt. He's never getting out of here."
Tony shot him the goofy, lopsided grin that he adored.  “Well, I can’t say that I don't love that sentimental streak you tend to have,” he said.  “Just as long as it’s the happy kind.”
"Don't forget to get something for yourself too," Steve said tiredly. "I'm sure you haven't eaten anything since this morning."
At least, not today. Steve knew he would have to sit the entire team down for a pretty intense debriefing once they got home, one where he would explain everything that had happened and what they did to fix it. Clint and Natasha had already explained some things to Wanda, just like Peter had asked more than a few questions of Steve while recovering from his electrical burns. Steve had answered them all to the best of his ability, but he also knew that Peter had a lot more, and had promised him multiple times that he and Tony would both explain everything once they got home.
"Mmm, well… he hasn't tried to steal any of your food, has he?" Tony asked. "'Cause if he has, then I'm gonna—"
Bucky breathed in a long, shaky breath, his chin quivering as he nodded.
"Gwen,
range.
"Copy that!" said Dad from somewhere Peter couldn't quite see, and he almost collapsed with relief. Dad was here. They were all gonna be okay now.
"Hello," said Natasha, rather warily. "So, can you tell us what this is all about?"
"Tony! Oh my God, you're awake!" Steve exclaimed as he leaned closer, carefully cupping his husband's cheek. "How're you feeling? Are you in any pain? What can I do for you?"
“Like I said, we’ll talk about it while I bring Steve back,” Tony said.  He gave Peter’s shoulder a gentle squeeze, leaning down to kiss him on the forehead.  “I’ll be back in a bit, so don't burn the house down or anything.”
"More," Steve said, grunting as he suddenly sat back, pulling off both their pants before guiding Tony onto his lap. Tony threw his head back as their cocks aligned and rubbed together, the pleasure already building deep in his gut. "Teastaíonn do bhéal. Teastaíonn do lámha uait. Teastaíonn
"I understand it perfectly, Tony," Steve cut in. "You're saying that this mission, this one mission could completely end the war?"
"Are you saying that we did it?" Phillips asked. "Are you saying that this whole goddamn thing was actually worth it?"
"Gems," Steve said, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Like the stone in Loki's sceptre?"
"That might be a good idea, mo grá," Steve said as he sat down on the bed, drawing Tony into a big hug. As much as he would've liked to have stayed in bed with Tony for the rest of the day, he was looking forward to the team's Thanksgiving dinner. Aside from being happy that they were all there—except for Thor, who had sent his regards the previous day—for some reason Steve had been feeling even more sentimental than usual lately, and in the theme of the day, was looking forward to telling his teammates how grateful he was for them.
"Iron Man," T'Challa cut in as he offered Tony his hand. "Yes, I am familiar with you, Mr Stark."
"Tony, now's not the time for petty disagreements," added Bruce. "We need to come up with a plan right now. And then a backup plan or three, 'cause I'm not sure one's gonna be enough."
"He's doing okay, though?"
"But—!"
Tony quirked an eyebrow as he brushed Steve's bangs from his forehead, his beautiful face so radiant in the soft bluish light of their bedroom that tears pricked Steve's eyes.
Peter frowned, only adding to his adorably disheveled look. He had needed a haircut since before they had left for Wakanda, and now, almost three weeks later, his curls were pretty much out of control.
"Um… you've seen Gwen when she's been here, right?"
“No, that’s not what I—”  Steve breaks off, letting out a heavy sigh.  He supposes they have plenty of time if Tony’s theory is correct.
"Oh, just shut up, will ya, Phillips? You just about blew my ears out with your stupid laugh!" Tomis barked back. "Now, c'mon Joe, tell us the names you guys picked!"
"No, thanks," Tony said as he set down his empty glass, ignoring it when it tipped over onto the blanket. Then he cupped Steve's face in his hand, angling it down so he could reach his lips.
"Hello there, JARVIS," Peter whispered as he trailed his fingertip across the letters, numbers, and symbols that made up the program that would hopefully help to save their planet. "It's nice to meet you."
Unfortunately, Steve highly doubted that the general would dare to do so again, which likely meant that he'd just painted a target not only on his own back, but on Tony and Peter's as well.
"Uh, I don't think I have a choice," Peter said as the ship took off towards the sky, with the alien and the wizard both disappearing inside. "Oh, crap, this can't be good."
into the water, there would've been no way that HYDRA would've been able to take cover under SHIELD's umbrella, biding its time until it could reemerge and wreak havoc on the world. Steve would've discovered them, if not right away then eventually. And he would have stopped them.
"Jesus Christ, Pete, what the hell were you doing?" Dad yelped, his helmet retracting as he fell to his knees, crushing Peter to his chest. Papa's shield dropped to the ground as he rushed forward, gathering them both into his arms.
"Yeah, pretty much."
he told the bedside nurse
"Yes, I am," Steve murmured as he kissed Tony's neck right below his ear, smirking when Tony let out a full-body shudder. After three years together Steve knew Tony's body like the back of his hand, knew all of his sweet spots, and he never failed to demonstrate that fact when they were being intimate.
The faintest hints of light from the rising sun were just starting to peek over the horizon when Tony woke from the deepest sleep he'd had in months. He groaned softly as he shifted, burrowing further into the cocoon of Steve's arms, a soft smile quirking the corners of his lips as Steve instinctively cuddled him closer.
His heart in his throat, Tony watched as the oscillating ventilator was wheeled up next to the baby's bedside, watched as Dr Goldman hooked it up to his tiny son's endotracheal tube, no larger than a coffee stirring stick.
"Elsewhere for a means of conversion," Peter murmured, swiping his hand across his freezing cold nose. "So that has to mean that they never got their hands on more of the Aminacin." Dad had told Peter that Director Fury had confiscated and destroyed Killian's entire supply of the drug when the Miami bunker was raided, and while Peter knew that Director Fury often said one thing and did another, maybe this was evidence that he did actually destroy the stuff.
"Yep," answered Tony. "Let's go."
“That was pretty impressive, Peter,” he says.  “You have a very natural stroke pattern, and I can tell you took your swimming lessons seriously.  Would you mind showing me the butterfly stroke now, please?  Down and back?”
The experiment had worked. Peter was now completely free from HYDRA's influence.
"Then how'd the rest of 'em know to come there through them portal thingies?" Rocket asked, turning to Nebula. "'Cause I thought you guys were stuck up there on Titan?"
It was a phoenix, its wings outstretched, preparing to take flight.
"Стив! Look!" Bucky exclaimed, pointing the tip of his rifle at the sky. Steve's jaw dropped as the wormhole, which had continued to bleed Chitauri the entire time they'd been standing there, suddenly closed in on itself, the loud
"Dad's right, Peter," Steve whispered into Peter's ear. "Just squeeze my hand, okay? Squeeze as hard as you need to, and I promise it's gonna be all right."
Alt-Steve gasped, his eyes nearly bulging as dozens of the golden circles began to appear, showering the battlefield with sparks. "
Steve's jaw tightened at the mention of Peter's former nanny. "I can't say that's a bad thing since she ended up being tied to HYDRA," he muttered. "And you told me that Peter always preferred you anyway, right?"
A company known for making weapons had to keep churning out weapons, or else it was just another company.  And that was completely unacceptable.
"Nothing important," Peter said with a quick shake of his head. "Just reciting some trivia stuff that we worked on the other day for Decathlon. One of the questions I got was about Admiral Nimitz."
"He's a kid?" a woman's voice suddenly said from somewhere off to the side. Peter gasped as she stepped into view; tall, dark-haired, and completely green.
"Yep," Steve said with a smile. "Together."
"After our previous discussion, I took the liberty of placing a tracer on the server," JARVIS began. "That tracer was just activated approximately three minutes ago, meaning someone was accessing the server at that time."
Peter thought as sleep started to pull him under.
"Stand down, you HYDRA piece of shit!" he said, strong but mechanical, almost as if he was being controlled by something.
“Ah huh,” says Tony.  “Well… have you ever wondered how Strucker managed to get it away from there so fast?”
, Pete," he said. "It's not, and—"
"Ah, you're just a big wuss!" said Dad from somewhere off to the side. "Lutefisk isn't near as bad as you keep saying!"
"Hey!" he said, or more like gasped when Tony opened the door, too stunned to say anything else. If Steve had thought Tony was handsome before he looked even more amazing now, dressed in a dark blue t-shirt and dark grey pants that almost perfectly matched the frames of his glasses.
"I'm pretty sure you haven't bud," said Tony. In a war-torn society, art and music were never given much of a priority, and Tony was thrilled that Peter had Steve now to encourage and help develop his artistic talent.
Tony frowned. Steve was right, of course, but leave it to Steve to worry about him when he was the one all banged up. Tony could afford to go without food for a day, and before Steve he often had, getting so wrapped up in his work that he'd literally forget to eat. But he'd already witnessed what could happen when Steve tried to go too long without eating, and that wasn't anything that Tony needed to see again.
"Look elsewhere for a means of conversion," Peter repeated, twice more as he tried to force his tired mind to keep working for just a little while longer.
Three of the longest seconds that Tony had ever experienced in his life passed before he heard Steve's reply.
Steve exclaimed, gaping at his husband. Tony had never mentioned anything about this to Steve before. "You never—wait, Loki did
Peter's heart gave a quick lurch at the word 'friends', briefly wondering if Uncle Bucky was wrong and he had just been misreading Gwen's signals the whole time when Gwen glanced up at him through her beautiful long eyelashes, and his stomach did that flipping thing it often did whenever she looked at him.
"Uh huh, got it," Peter said. He crouched down into the water, the tips of his skis poking up on either side of his rope. "I'm ready, Dad."
“Yeah, maybe,” Steve says after a short pause.  Then he raises his apple juice in a mock-toast, attempting a smile that probably ends up looking more like a grimace.  “I promise I’ll let you know if that happens, okay?”
"D-daddy, P-papa's down there, we g-gotta g-get him out!" Peter cried, his lips as blue as his papa's uniform as he continued to punch against the ice, leaving smears of blood all along the thick cracks that had formed. Tony grabbed onto his wrists, struggling to get Peter to stop before he could cause any further damage.
"Well, I guess they've gotta keep staying ahead of the curve," Steve replied as he sealed his canopy closed, patting it for good measure. "Besides, it's not like they're getting retired or anything. They'll still be in use."
"A fish… night light?" Gwen said, confused. "Um… Ned, I'm not sure that—"
Quickly dismissing that thought as ridiculous, Steve pursed his lips and clicked on Howard Stark's name, bracing himself as the file began scrolling across the screen.
"Yeah, bud, I'm fine," Tony said. He pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his stinging eyes. "I… uh…"
“Of course, Captain,” replies Thor.  He shifts slightly, holding out his hand towards Tony’s arm.  “Come, Stark.  Young Starkson is very eager to see you.”
As soon as Natasha exited the lab, Steve turned back to the screen, still scrolling with name after name. He watched for a moment, then had to look away, too overwhelmed by the sheer number of missing.
The next chapter will post on Wednesday, December 30th.  Happy Holidays to you all!  💗 💗
"They're probably too afraid of retaliation," Steve said. "Whether they intended to or not, they did end up killing King T'Chaka, and if even a fraction of the rumours about Wakanda are true, then I'm guessing whoever it is is going to be in hiding for quite a while."
"Everything's fine with your dads, милая ошибка," Auntie Nat said as soon as Peter opened the door. "No need to worry."
Peter's eyebrows twitched. "Um, thanks. I hope that's a good thing."
(See the end of the chapter for
As Tony and Colonel Rhodes buried their noses in the documents, Steve turned to Bucky, who looked about as uncomfortable as Steve felt.  He held out his arm, relieved when Bucky stepped forward for a hug.
Completely fucking useless!"
And now, all he wanted to do was sleep.
"Oh, Captain," said T'Challa, now smiling widely. "You have not seen anything yet."
Closing his eyes, Tony breathed in, absorbing the sounds and smells of the lake and the trees and the gentle wind, and the drop-dead gorgeous man standing next to him. For the first time in his life, Tony could truly say that he was content. His son was healthy, he had a man that he loved beyond words, and he finally had a real home to call his own.
Thanks to homework, helping with dinner, and then helping Dad in the lab, the rest of the evening flew by fast, and after talking with Gwen and telling her that his dads had agreed to let him go on their date, he flopped into bed exhausted, but happier than he'd been in a long, long time.
"Oh," Peter said. Papa and Dad had told Peter about his super soldier experiment a couple of weeks ago, something that Peter had to admit he found incredibly cool. "Well, that's good, but… but
Steve's heart was in his throat as he nodded. "At least everyone here."
Dad shot Papa one of his not-so-subtle I-told-you-so looks. "Yeah, and that physics test you had yesterday? How'd that go?"
Now though, Steve almost welcomed the strong, bitter taste. It was a good match for his mood.
"Captain," Dr Cho said firmly as she grabbed onto Steve's arm. "If that is indeed the case, then we will take care of him just like we did then. And he will come back to us, just like he did then."
"We're really sorry we're so late tonight, little guy," Steve said as he pulled Peter into a huge but careful hug, one that Peter had taken to calling his papa bear hug. "There's… there's been—"
"We shall," Steve said as he secured his shield and grabbed onto Tony's armoured shoulders. For all of the reservations he'd had about flying with Tony at first, he absolutely loved it now.
"Okay, fine," Peter said instead. He fiddled with his blankets for a second, trying to decide if he should ask. It'd been awhile since he'd needed Dad to help him fall asleep, but… the nightmares had just been so bad lately, so…
However, for all of Steve's meticulous planning, he realised only three hops in that he'd neglected to take into account the soreness in his right hip caused by him trying to compensate for the extra weight on his left foot. He paused in the very centre of the room, already dripping with sweat as he rested just the tip of his left toes against the floor, trying to take just a touch of weight off his right leg, and not even a second later found himself flat on his face, completely stunned, with his entire left side screaming in protest.
The sooner they could initiate Project Phoenix, the better. For all of their sakes.
Natasha smirked, leaning towards the monitor. "Um… Марк Ракстон, that's Mark Raxton, and Уильям Бейкер is William Baker. That along with Steven Rogers, James Barnes, Bruce Banner, and Peter Stark-Rogers are all that we've managed to uncover."
"But that wasn't your fault!" Peter cried. "Dad, it wasn't! It was HYDRA's!"
“And how many times have I warned you about appearances, Tony?” Obie continued, like he hadn't heard a word Tony had said.  “For a man in your position, appearances are half the battle in maintaining a good public view of the company.  And you being seen around town holding Captain America’s hand here is just not compatible with that view!”
Tony looked up at him, tilting his head. "Well, you've always suspected they were in bed together anyway."
"Yeah, he was the best," Tony said, not without a hint of melancholy. "And he would've adored you."
“No problem.”  Natasha leans closer, lowering her voice.  “And you never know.  Maybe this dad will turn out to be single and cute.  Did you think about that?”
Gwen tilted her head, giving him the smile that always sent butterflies flitting inside his stomach.
"Oh no," Steve gasped as the massive alien drew back his arm and launched his huge metal hammer at Bruce, knocking him off-balance just as an entire herd of the war dogs attacked him. Bruce cried out as he was driven to the ground, the snarling animals unrelenting as they bit and clawed at the red and gold armour.
“Ah, don't you mean the freestyle?” Peter asks.  Only his swimming teachers at the Y have ever called it the front crawl.
"Thanks, Dad!" Peter said as he gathered snow for his next snowball, his bright red nose and cheeks framed by the bright blue hood of his parka only enhancing his sweet, cherub look. More giggles ensued as he searched for Steve's hiding place amongst a clump of trees, finally launching his snowball when Steve attempted to move around behind him.
"Babe, you do realise that this is exactly what they want, right?" he said gently. "HYDRA? Wasn't the whole point of Project Insight to control people through fear?"
exclaimed Little Steve. "
"Tony," Steve said as he reached for Tony's hand, planting a quick kiss on his forehead. "Is Peter all right?"
"Approximately six hours, Master Peter. I'm afraid I am quite busy at the moment, so it won't be any sooner than that."
It also had been one of the most terrifying things he had ever done.  But as he went about the rest of his day, coordinating aid for the Sokovian team and working on the various non-weapons projects he was developing, he had deliberately chosen to focus on the liberating part rather than the terrifying.
“Steve,” he’d finally said, or more like barely whispered—
And as he drifted off, his fingers intertwined with Tony's and Tony's warm breath against his neck, Steve knew without a doubt that he was loved, and that Tony had his back, no matter what.
Steve reached for Tony's hand as they backed out of Peter's room, the muscles in his jaw twitching as they made their way down the hall to their bedroom. Tony had barely had time to cross the threshold when Steve halted, turning to Tony and hoisting him into his arms as he backed him up against the wall.
Pulling onto the runway, Steve quickly scanned the sky, again not seeing anything out of the ordinary. The D-shift was still up there, as they had all planned to stand by in the air in case the A-shift needed backup support, but there was no smoke or fire trails from missiles trailing from the Meridian border, nor could Steve hear any machine gunfire.
"Natasha?" Steve whispered over the comm. "What's your position?"
"Come in?" Papa said, his nervous face lighting up when Peter stepped inside. "Hey, little guy! Wow, don't you look sharp!"
Steve graduated Summa Cum Laude with a double major from a prestigious university, all while maintaining a full-time training schedule.  He should’ve been able to better decipher the signs long before he did.
After encouraging Dad to at least drink some water along with his coffee—Peter wasn't brave enough to try switching him to decaf—Peter hugged him goodnight and headed back to his room, where he found JARVIS just about finished with the drone upgrade.
Steve's body was stiff against Tony, refusing to relax or even bend at all until Tony retracted his arm gauntlets, trailing his fingers through Steve's sweat-dampened hair.
Tony rolled his eyes so hard that Steve almost had to catch him. "Jesus
"No, it's not, but it's also not up to me," Phillips grumbled, and Steve's head snapped back in surprise. He couldn't recall ever hearing Phillips speak anything less than admirably about their military leadership.
"Copy that."
"I don't see anything but trees, personally," said Clint from the copilot's seat. "These Wakandan dudes aren't Ents, are they?"
Tony nodded, relaxing his shoulders the way Steve had taught him during their sparring lessons. Then he tapped the container twice with his fingers and closed his eyes, his breath hitching as the holographic nanites began to emerge from the container, expanding across his chest and down his arms and legs, with the helmet locking into position a few seconds later. For a moment, Tony was frozen in place, afraid to move in case he suddenly lost nanite coalescence.
"Well, I don't know what else to tell you," Bucky said as he got to his feet. "I guess I'll see you at dinner?"
Tony thought, tapping his fingernails against his tablet. He briefly wondered if Strange had known then that he was going to die, or if it came as a surprise later on.
A knot rose in Tony's throat, and he tried to pull away, held fast by Steve's strong arm. "I should've figured this out a long time ago, Steve, but I was just too damn arrogant. I never thought—"
“Oh, are you sure?” Obie snapped back.  “‘Cause at the moment I can’t quite tell!”
"Yes," she replied. "But you're not the only one. There's also Bruce, Bucky, and—"
"Yeah, Sam, we're good," answered Steve. He took Sam's outstretched hand, hoisting himself up to his feet as Thor and Natasha came into view. "Nat, you still got that biological?"
"Grandpa doesn't stress me, Dad," said Peter. "He just doesn't have anything else to do, so—"
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"Which is… what, exactly?" asked John.
"But…?" Peter asked, raising an eyebrow. "What's wrong?"
Now, it was onto the next.
"And, what do you suggest we should do as our next step, Captain?" asked Dr Strange.
"Hey guys, I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but—"
"Please, honey," he whispered. "Please, don't. You're—"
"I believe, Captain, that—"
“I don't know about any other-way-round thing!” Peter protests.  “All I wanna know is what’s bothering you!”  He raises his hand as Tony starts to speak.  “And don't just tell me ‘nothing’, either, ‘cause I won’t believe you.”
It was not looking good for the poor Mets.
Steve shot him a wicked grin as he tightened his grip, leaning over to whisper, "Do you want my hands or my mouth, sweetheart?"
"My dad didn't get to choose his father, and neither did I," he added. "But my dad's a good man, and he works harder than anyone I've ever seen. I wouldn't trade him for anyone."
O'Brien waved his hand. "Yes, yes, I apologise for the rather intrusive question. I understand that you still receive your quarterly checkups from the medical office?"
"Hey, little guy," Steve said as he settled himself down on the spare chair. "I said I'd be back this afternoon, remember?"
"As soon as they're programmed into the simulator."
"Yeah, I'm sure." Dad cupped Peter's cheeks in his hands, brushing his tears away with his thumbs. "We're gonna get him back, Pete, I
“Hey, JARVIS?  Could you look and see if there are any of the neurological drug trials that’re still accepting patients?” he asked.  “I know someone who might be interested.”
"You know I will, mo grá," Steve said with a relieved smile. He quickly popped the rest of his croissant into his mouth and got to his feet, reaching for Tony's hand. "Shall we?"
"Sorry," murmured Steve, sounding anything but sorry. "I'll leave you alone now."
"You can tell me, little guy," Papa as he held out his arms. "You know you can."
"Uh huh," answered Peter, patting his backpack. "I'm ready."
"Yes, well, so did Thor, and from what he's been telling us, it was all pretty awful," Papa agreed. "But the worst part was that Hela was so powerful that he and Loki ended up having to destroy Asgard in order to defeat her."
yes, please. I want."
Steve chuckled, pressing one final kiss to Tony's lips. "I'll be right back."
Despite the fierce battles they had fought, the Avengers were overall a peacekeeping force, not a government-controlled enhanced army, and Peter knew Papa would never allow them to fall under any sort of government control.
Again, Tony paused, his eyes never leaving Obie’s face as Obie’s eyes flicked over to Bucky, and the empty left sleeve hanging from his uniform jacket, before returning to Tony.
"I have completed three such diagnostics in the last six hours, sir," said JARVIS. "I am unsure as to what another would accomplish at this time."
A tree with a face, arms, and legs. Like an Ent.
“Ehh,” Peter stammered.
"Yes, mo grá, I know that," Steve said, way too evenly for Tony's taste. "But there are plenty of other ways we can find out what we want to find out that don't include you having to talk to him."
Even more questions for him to investigate.
"Can we make him big again now, Dad?" Peter asked. "I don't think he likes this too much."
Tony inhaled a deep breath through his nose before responding, trying to keep his blood pressure steady enough to finish the call without popping a vessel or something. They had been going round and round for over an hour, which was well past Tony's limit of being diplomatic with government idiots. Especially Senator Davis.
"Well, let's hope so," Steve said as he unearthed some chicken thighs from the freezer, setting them onto his favourite cutting board before washing his hands. "We'll start with the tea first, and some breakfast for you, little guy, and then once the soup's done we'll bring him some of that. Sound good?"
“Okay, then I wanna help you,” Peter stated.  “If something’s happened to Papa, I wanna help you figure out what it is.”
“At this moment, sir, I do not,” said JARVIS.
"One that can only be seen in The Water of Sight, one of which I was lucky enough to find in our new home, hidden inside a series of caves cut into a mountain," Thor said.
as it then buried itself into Thanos' chest.
“Now that Pete’s a bit older, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind going out on the bike every now and then,” Tony added.  “I’ll have to get him a helmet so you can take him out for a ride sometime.”
The second text was from Tony, and as Steve read it over he sped up his footsteps until he was practically trotting down the street towards the Tower. The team had indeed found something of importance, and were waiting for him in Tony's lab.
"I'll take that as a yes," Bucky said once Steve had finally stopped coughing. "Gods, Steve, you've really gotta quit trying to choke yourself to death every single time I bring that stuff up!"
something Peter ever cared to repeat.
“Ah, not quite!” Clint rasps, clutching his shoulder.  “And, sure.  Whatever you say, man.”
"Absolutely," said Steve. He cupped Tony's cheek, brushing a soft kiss across his lips. "What else can I get for you?"
Wow!  I can’t believe this story is over!  I’m going to miss this universe!
Steve moaned against Tony's shoulder as he started with gentle rocks of his hips. "Oh mo grá, braitheann tú chomh maith! Chomh fucking maith!"
Steve thought as he helped Peter to his feet, then reached for Tony's hand.
"And?"
O'Brien had been damn lucky that there'd been a force shield separating him from Tony, because Tony had been so fucking angry in that moment that he probably could've ripped apart a vibranium shield with his bare hands.
"I have to be, Buck," he finally whispered. "I don't—I don't have a choice."
"No, Bruce mentioned something else that he needed to do for Director Fury at three today," Papa said, checking his watch. "But I'd bet that Dad will still be in the lab when we get back, so you can ask him all about it." He paused, halting Peter before he could climb into the truck. "Just remember, little guy, we can't say anything about any of this, okay? The news people have already caused enough of a panic about a possible space attack, and we don't want to be adding to it until we know what's going on."
"Okay, well, let me know when you do, okay? Maybe we can trade notes or something."
"Not so-called," said Tony. "He was
"His name's Justin Hammer, and he owns a company that he likes to think is comparable to Stark Industries," he said quietly. "They manufacture tech products, gadgets and stuff, but most of his main buyers are overseas 'cause he's never been able to compete with me head-to-head. And, 'cause I had JARVIS double-check this on the way here, he also has recently landed some pretty lucrative contracts with the military to produce weapons."
"No, it's not!" shrieked Tony, still struggling against Steve's ironclad grip. "They've got him! Steve, they—they took him from me!"
"No!" Image Peter repeated, panting for breath but just as clear. "You can't have me!"
Dad scoffed. "Yeah, well, pardon me if I don't exactly trust Fury and his vetting process too much at the moment. Especially since he just sent Steve and the others right into another fucking ambush." He winced, glancing at Peter in the rearview mirror. "Sorry, bud."
"And therefore bring an end to the war," said Tony.
Steve kissed Peter again, then slowly unwound Peter's fingers from his hand, flexing it a couple times once it was free and wincing at the pain shooting across his knuckles. Nothing felt broken, but given Peter's immense super-strength Steve suspected that it had been close. He got to his feet, hurrying around to the other side of the bed to find Tony still staring at Stane, completely still and unblinking, almost as though he had gone catatonic.
"And I'm here to make sure you don't forget stuff like that, Captain," Tony said. "It's my job to try and throw you off."
"Eh, I don't mind as long as I keep getting new suits out of the deal," Rhodey said with a wink. "Give Peter a hug for me, yeah?"
Pride welled up in Peter's belly, and he smiled widely. "Well, Papa is pretty smart. And he's known you for pretty much your whole life, so I think you should listen to him."
"It is, Peter, and they're called HYDRA," said Papa. "And everything that's happened since Project Insight has convinced me this was their backup plan all along. It's a lot slower and more involved than those giant helicarriers, but I think their objective is the same. They want to control people through fear."
"Okay, so, if I'm reading this right, which isn't a promise, by the way, it looks to me like part of this thing is charred," Tony said. "Do you know if Thor has any spares of these parts?"
"Would've had to have been moving pretty damn fast to be unseeable, especially by JARVIS," Uncle Sam cut in. "And as far as we know, no human can move that fast."
"And you're sure about that?" asked Mr Stacy. "Absolutely sure?"
"Yeah, it is," said Sam. "Peter's… well… he's—"
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if you're right about that," said Steve. "He sure knew his way around that aircraft."
"Then, are you planning to do something about it?" he whispered against Steve's lips.
"All right, all right," Steve said, rather resignedly. "I'll try it out."
Steve's throat tightened so quickly that he almost choked.
"Captain, Mr Stark requires immediate medical attention," stated JARVIS. “Life signs are critical.”
“Well…” Steve said, clearing his throat.  “I’m glad I could help.”
"I know babe, but like Bruce said, if we try and rush through that decryption, we risk losing more of the files due to mistakes," said Tony. "We've already lost more than I'm comfortable with, so we're trying to be extra careful with the rest. We'll figure it out, it's just gonna take a bit more time."
"It's okay," Steve cut in. "I'm just—oh God, Tony, I'm just so relieved to see you here."
“Well, it sure wasn’t mine,” Natasha says.  She tosses Steve a wink before taking a sip of her tea.  “So… did you see that the Economics Department hired a new assistant professor?  His bio says he only dates men, and I’d say he’s pretty cute, in a kind of nerdy, econ sort of way.  So… maybe—?”
Tony thought, grimacing at the severe roiling in his stomach.
Steve whimpered as Tony's calloused hand slid down his messy stomach to curl around his cock, already starting to harden again. "Are you—are you sure?"
A pregnant pause followed Tony’s proclamation, the air growing almost stiflingly thick as Obie’s expression hardened even further.
“Ah, yeah, I’d agree with that assessment,” Tony says.  He looks up at Steve, a slight smirk playing on his lips that Natasha keeps insisting he never gives anyone else.  “You think this is the place, then?”
"Honey!" Tony cried, repulsing away yet another target that had crept up behind Steve. Steve whipped around as the target flew backwards, crashing into the far wall. "Steve, think! Use your suit!"
“Oh, really?” retorted Tony.  “You mean the one who proceeded to write a massive hit piece on me the very next day?  That one?”
"I do appreciate your time this morning, Captain, and I only have a couple more questions before I dismiss you," O'Brien finally said.
“At your service, sir,” replied JARVIS.  Because no matter what, JARVIS was always there.
