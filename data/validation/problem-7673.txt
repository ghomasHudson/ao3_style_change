“Oh! So he’s grown from a minor nuisance on a soapbox to having rallies now, huh?” asked Steve, feeling the sarcastic rage build inside.
“Time. And. Place,” Steve spat out. He did not want his secret admiration thrown about as carelessly as a newsboy with the evening paper.
Now it was Tony’s turn to feel embarrassed. “Oh?” said Tony, liking how the word ‘official’ felt falling from Steve’s lips. “Any spoilers on the plan?
Steve felt his cheeks burn as the other dancers sized him up. The guys eyed Steve in confusion while the girls whispered to themselves in less than quiet voices. How unconventional! If someone strong like Tony took a partner, surely a man of Steve’s stature would take the girl’s part.
Like all good jazz; it starts off as a mess, get's itself organized, and then explodes in a burst of noise that we like to call music.
“Do you know the one thing in common all four of those companies have?” asked Natasha, dismissing another tower of dust covered cubes. “Very intelligent, very stupid men at the top of the tower.”
“You gonna let me run free on the how?" asked Clint, fingering a hidden blade along the length of his thigh.
“Right,” Tony said, shifting himself a few steps away from the deadly woman. Natasha was a good person and Tony trusted her with his life, but sometimes when she smiled, a voice in the back of Tony’s head told him to run away as fast as he could.
She rolled her eyes. “A job that utilizes all of my assets.”
“That is what you should expect if you betray me. There will be no second changes. No excuses of ‘I will do better next time.’ Work is hard to come by friends, and protection is even harder. You idiots are a dime a dozen, and don’t think I don’t have what it takes to throw your ass to the curb if you fail me. This is the only warning you will get. Do I make myself clear?” He inspected the line of fools, glaring each of them down into submission. Not a one of them moved to leave.
Jane took a step back. "The Tony Stark?" she asked, mouth agape. She didn’t seem to mind that Tony hadn’t accepted the neutral gesture.
“I thought we agreed to keep it low profile. This picture. This mark! It all screams you!” she shook the morning rag at him.
“No judgment. I’m not a fan of this stuff either, but we gotta get some food into you. ‘S why I brought this,” Tony said, holding up a large remote-controlled car. “Supped up an old RC for you to chase. Thought if we can’t reach the human, the wolf in you would appreciate the chase. How do you feel about rabbit?”
“Beautiful,” Steve murmured. He pressed his thumb flat against Tony’s slit. Tony groaned as he felt a thin line of fluid leak out his cock. He squirmed as it dripped down his throbbing dick and soaked the white sheet. God, why wouldn’t Steve get on with it? Tony hadn’t jerked off all week and he needed to come bad.
tooooo late
“I’ll believe it after that sandwich is gone”
“Panic attack,” Steve explained. He gave Tony’s hand a gentle squeeze. “It’s over for now, but he’s still a little shaky.”
“Yes it is,” Steve stupidly insisted. “They tried to kill me. They attacked you. Maybe I don’t have the same beef with them over the weapons, but goddamnit, don’t tell me to fuck off now. This is my fight just as much as yours.”
Tony let out a heavy sigh. “Look,” Tony said, running the rag along the length of Steve’s fingers. “I know you’re still angry at me. I get it. And, for what little its worth, I never planned on using you for personal gain or anything like that. Kinda got caught up in the secrets I had to keep, and now everything is coming to a head. So, sorry if I used you. I didn’t mean it.”
"Hey." A strong hand on his shoulder disrupted his internal rambling.
“Bit too easy if you ask me,” said Bucky
Ms. Potts ignored his remark. “Dinner with Victor will is scheduled for 7:30 tonight, so please be down in the car by 6:00. You know how busy the streets get in the evening. And don’t forget that Obie will be stopping by in a few hours to check on you. If there’s anything you don’t want him to see, take it down or take him out to eat at someplace nice.”Tony snorted as if the prospect of going out to eat was on a list of impossibilities.  “On the Southern Front, meeting concluded right on schedule. Our new provider has agreed to the terms of our arrangement. I’ll draw up a contract and we should be expecting product within the next few weeks.”
“What was that?” Schmidt demanded, hand already in his breast pocket.
A hand, quick as a snake, snapped out and grabbed Iron Man’s wrist before it made contact. Tony tried to pull away, but Iron Man’s arm was held in a death grip. Beaten blue eyes glared at him from beneath the grime. The warning was clear. Steve may be down, but he was not out for the count. “I will have your head, Iron Man,” he growled.
I know this is heavy, real life stuff, but I feel like you guys should know. I want to finish this fic, but I need to acknowledge that if I haven't updated it in a year, I most likely won't finish it any time soon. I'll definitely try, but I feel I should keep you guys in the loop. Hope you've enjoyed the chapter and thanks for sticking with me for so long.
A few minutes later, there was a knock on the back door of the truck. Tony opened it and there he was; big, blond, breathtaking, and as stiff as a board.
She shrugged, casual as always. “Can’t a gal stop by to see some familiar faces? Had some work I needed to finish up here. Thought I’d check in with a friend before coming down to see you guys.”
“On it,” Bucky confirmed with a nod. Without hesitation, he hoped over the shoddy cover and ran towards the action.
“Nope,” Tony whispered, trying to put some humor in his voice. “This is new.”
“Fine.” He gave in. “But you gotta understand.” Steve tried to break the news as easy as he could. He wouldn’t get a second chance at this and he wanted Tony to fully understand the gravity of the situation. There was no way of getting out of shit this deep. “There are some guys out there, really bad guys doing really bad stuff. It's not safe to go out alone this time of night. I don't know how things were in Boston or how things are in Manhattan, but you really need to be more careful here.
“Did you see it?” asked the kid, incessantly tugging on Natasha’s sleeve. “I kissed him. That means I married Captain America!”
“This way Mr. Rogers,” she said, ignoring him and coxing him over to the large door with a wave of her hand.
“Uh... I’m going to have to disagree with that,” quipped Clint.
“Then, at the very least, sleep on it,” urged Stane. “I know you haven’t been getting much sleep lately. Let me take your meetings for the rest of the day, and if you still think it’s the right thing to do, we’ll get started on the paperwork tomorrow. Sound good?”
Oh right. Not getting hit by bullets. Good idea.
Steve groaned as his muscles spasmed and shrunk back into human form.
“Keep the door open, please,” Tony said with a knowing smile. “I want to see if our guest is dumb enough to make a run for it.”
“Cap,” Tony wailed. “Big me is being mean!”
When and where would it be appropriate to drop casual questions or hints about his romantic interest? Here at the base? At the bar on a 24 hour leave? Was he interested in Tony? Was he even interested in men? What if he didn’t want a relationship? What if he just wanted a roll in the hay? Could Tony do that? Of course he could, but that didn’t mean Tony wanted a single night of fun. With all these questions running around in his head, Tony didn’t even take into account the biggest and most important question of all.
“That’s why I didn’t tell you I was Iron Man,” he admitted, pulling the rope tight, not caring if the harsh abrasions gave the man a wicked rope burn. “Everyone who’s affiliated with me ends up getting hurt in some way. I just- I just didn’t want you to be another causality.”
“You mean like this?” Steve whispered quietly into Tony’s ear as his strong arms reached around Tony’s smaller frame, wrapping him into a loose hug. Two large hands wrapped around the ends of the rolling pin, effectively trapping Tony’s calloused fingers beneath their warm embrace. Steve pushed the dough out in one long stroke, pressing his large chest against Tony’s back.
“Tony!”
Three groups of two split off and stalked into maze of the warehouse. They weren’t heavily armed, but they were packing much more heat than any
Tony looked up at the shovel, and he knew if he didn’t do something quick this was the end. The look in Steve’s eyes, the bloodlust puppeteering Steve’s every move, Steve was a man of his word and all the hurt he had sworn upon Iron Man, Tony knew that Steve would follow through.
"Not the point Falcon," he growled. He and Bucky weren't like that and Sam knew it. He had no reason bringing that up in front of Tony.
Embedded in the wood was a single arrow. The purple shaft and feathers still wobbled from the impact, as if mocking him. Steve noticed a small bulge at the tip as well as a white note attached to the shaft.
“No, but-”
“Granted, that wasn’t much,” Pepper agreed with an audible eye roll. “But now we know that the ‘call’ button gets stuck on occasion, so that’s a plus.”
So he snuck out in the dead of night; quiet as a mouse, RT covered by a dark wetsuit vest as he looked over the edge of the boat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Shit. No! They couldn’t go down like this. Steve had to-
Tony grinned. Oh, this was going to be fun. He wrapped his arms around the back of Steve’s neck, seductively grinding his hips against the growing bulge in Steve’s pants to capture his ‘attention’. “In that case, I’ll give you a private lesson. We got a tent on the far side of camp just for these kinds of situations.”
“Tony has that type of power?” asked Steve in generic disbelief. Who knew business dolls could be so strong. “We are talking about the same Tony, right?”
“And? Thoughts?” Tony acted as if he could care less, but the nervous fidget of his hands gave him away.
Steve snorted at the impossible possibility. “Wouldn’t that be nice.” Steve knew Sam was trying to make him feel better, but on a day like today, it just made him feel worse. There were moments when he felt so close and moments where it felt like there was an ocean between them instead of a couple dozen blocks of concrete.
Morgan’s eyes sparkled. “Really!”
“How much you want to bet that I do?”
“My workshop,” replied Tony with a complicated look. “But my new one is currently under construction right now, and the one at work has people that I’d rather not see.” There was a story behind there, but Steve didn’t push. “You should come and see it some time. Got all the latest toys. Can’t promise anything, but should be a fun time.”
He tried to remind himself how warm it was here. How much love he felt. Kindness, trust, boundless faith in Steve. The way the light in this mysterious man’s heart bounced off the star on Steve’s chest. Steve tried to remember it all.
“Just stay there Steve,” insisted Tony. The last thing he needed was Steve getting in the way and shot down by a stray bullet.
Tony groaned into his coffee mug. “It’s a little more complicated than that kid.”
Tony stared at Steve slack jawed. He knew Steve liked him, but he didn’t really realize how much. Tony always had doubts about their relationship wandering around in the back of his mind. Not about him not loving Steve. Never that. Tony loved Steve with every fiber of his being. No, the one Tony had doubts about was Steve.
"Oh come on Steve. This way you get to go with Barnes. You're always doting on him. Might as well give you two some quality time alone, if you know what I’m saying.”
In such close quarters, lips were loose and ears were always listening for gossip. Tony had to monitor his actions every second of the day if he didn’t want to get discovered. And there was no guarantee Tony’s interest would be returned if he found someone who caught his eye. He hoped, but one could never be too sure.
“Funny. I had impossible for breakfast this morning. You know what it tasted like? Not this!”
Tony was the first to break the silence. “Hi,” he said in a quiet voice.
“But you have to admit,” Tony replied with a suggestive waggle of his eyebrows, “It’s a very nice ass.”
"It shall be done!"
Steve looked at him. Then back at the card. Then back at Tony. Steve’s entire body was alight with energy. “This is amazing Tony! You got the job! And it's at Stark Industries." Steve was all smiles."That's amazing! Stark Industries is one of the best companies to work for!”
“Miss me Obie?” asked Tony with his usual air of cocky snark.
Feedback is good. Yes, I am writing this for myself, but it's always nice to know that someone else enjoyed my work.
Spider Baby
As they slowly walked back to their hideout, Sam kept sneaking Steve a look. “You should tell him,” he said, voice low and comforting against the white noise of the neighborhood.
“More like a German pain in my ass,” Steve swore under his breath. “These guys are Hydra; the same guys who gift wrapped me that grenade.”
But Steve, bless his heart, didn’t even bat an eye at Tony’s tantrum. “When I draw you, I want to capture who you are, not what you try to be. You put on a show because you feel it’s expected. Everything you do is supposed to be elegant and effortless. You’re supposed to be larger than life. Fuck anyone who thinks otherwise. You’re Tony Stark; the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist who works part time as a superhero.
Seven.
even existed.
Bucky snorted. “Try telling that to Steve. Guy lost his mind at the first scent of blood. Kept saying ‘mine, mine,’ up until I left.”
Steve looked down at his hands. He closed his eyes, found his resolve, and held onto it with both hands. “I want to be there,” Steve said. “Even if the results aren’t good, I should be there. He’s my best friend. We promised each other we’d be there till the end of the line.”
He reached for the zipper at his neck and pulled it down just enough to check on the modified RT device. He tapped his long nail on the casing and held his breath. No sea water leaking into the machinery. No cracks from the pressure of the ocean. It just hummed along like it did on land, performing the one job it was made to do; keeping Tony alive.
. Seeing Steve like that; knuckles covered in blood, teeth bared, veins popped and tinted blue, it made Tony’s heart skip a beat every time Steve landed a hit. Never in his wildest dreams would Tony have though to describe a man kicking the living shit out of another man to be arousing.
“Okay! That’s enough,” Tony said, scurrying out from under the wolf relative ease.
Ms. Potts smiled. “If there’s nothing else Mr. Stark, I’ll leave you to two your business.”
Immediately, Tony knew he had the wrong man. He may only have memories of light finger touches, but the muscles Tony felt under his fingers, the coarseness of the hair on the man’s arm, there was no way that this man was Tony’s Steve. He didn’t even wait for the man to turn around before pushing him out the door and on his way. Tony had already lost enough time waiting for the elevator. Now was no time to dwell on which wrong arm he had touched in his haste.
Steve waited in silence, dreading the next move the monster would make.
Steve just shook his head at his ridiculous boyfriend. “That’s high praise from someone who said they could make me come without using their hands,” he said, slipping a shirt over his head.”
Steve grinned. He set the wooden tray down on an empty spot on the bed. “You’ve been working really hard this week. Thought I’d surprise you with a little something special. Do you like It?”
“Being handled Mr. Schmidt,” Rumlow assured his boss. But even he glanced at the dimming light suspiciously.
“About before, just between the three of us; I bet Tony half a pack of cigarettes tall, blond, and beautiful asks for him before we leave.”
Tony pushed against Steve’s chest, trying to free himself from the warm embrace and get as far away as he could. Maybe if there was no evidence, they won’t be able to get rid of him.
“And you have no idea how much I wish I could knock some sense into him,” muttered Rhodey in a voice that implied he wasn’t just worried about the younger Tony Stark’s life choices.
The younger Tony rolled his eyes. “I wasn’t asking you. I was asking Cap.”
“That’s just how he is,” insisted Steve. “I’m nothing special.”
Tony’s breath caught in his throat. No way. This was happening? Now? Just the two of them on a beach in the middle of nowhere with no gossip mags or media or crazy extended superhero family to hold this sappy moment over his head for years to come? Goddamnit! How was Steve always so perfect?
“Maybe later. He’s got enough on his mind without having to worry about the fact that she’s missing” Sam whispered back.
Follow me on my tumbler and see all the shit I reblog.
The wolf didn’t respond. His attention was solely on Bucky as the white wolf paced back and forth over the upturned ground.
But Steve wasn’t fazed. He looked at Tony’s dick and then locked eyes with Tony. In the depths of those lust blown eyes, Tony saw something more than the hunger of arousal. There was adoration in the deep blue of his eyes. An endless supply of love. Steve look past all Tony’s doubts and just saw him as he was. Steve looked at Tony, and Tony fell in love all over again.
Tony pulled down the neck of his wetsuit. The RT device hummed along just as it should. Thick, cold metal insulating his chest. A literal shield to protect his vitals. Untested as to how much damage or pressure it could take. And he was about to test it. On an iceberg. On purpose. Stars above. This was going to hurt.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Come on,” he said, taking Steve’s hand.
“Hawkeye, hold your position. Keep an eye out for stragglers. I don’t want anything larger than a nut leaving this area.”
“Missus Barnes,” Tony said with a tilt of his nonexistent hat.
He could hear that distinct single eyebrow raise she did whenever he was being stupid or cryptic. “About what?”
Captain flag’s cheeks turned pink. “It was nothing. Really. You guy had it under control. We just picked off the stragglers. You’re… You guys are really good with guns.”
For my older readers, thank's for hanging in there. And for those new readers, welcome and enjoy your stay.
Steve shook his head and looked at Tony, determination on his face. “A roow woony.”
“You’re avoiding again.”
Tony swam down underneath Captain America’s icy coffin and pushed it up toward the surface.
Steve cocked his head.
A far away
Tony shook his head, smile still on his face. “Nah. I already gave them ridiculous nicknames to get ‘em back. Good pal of mine James Rhodes. Met him while I was at college, call him Rhodey. Hated when I first started calling him that, but it stuck. And I got this gal, Pepper, her first name is Virginia of all things. Why her parents name her that, I will never know. But, she’s got the prettiest peppering of freckles over her face, couldn’t help myself when I saw her. She hates it, good god she almost slapped me when I called her that for the first time. But what can I say, my charming personality wore her down.”
"Happy to oblige Captain," replied a beefy blond, placing both hands on Bucky's cheeks and pulling him into a full on kiss.
Bruce could fix Bucky. He had to. Tony had faith that Bruce could do it, and he would. After all, the man had brought Tony back from the brink of death with a shoddy car battery. What was an arm compared to a heart? Nothing. Absolute child’s play.
“You can’t make me. I won’t let you take Cap away from me!” screamed Tony.
Tony swam around the iceberg, debating how many hints Iron Man could drop before the Avengers started getting suspicious. But as he circled around to the front, something changed. The water hadn’t turned warmer or colder. Something was just… wrong.
“Tuesdays,” he called. Steve’s hands began to sweat when Tony stopped but didn’t turn around. “I’m usually here on Tuesdays. Sometimes on Thursdays,” he called once more.
Steve chuckled. “I thought you said you guys didn’t sell sex?”
“It’s none of your damn business!” Steve shouted back. Why didn’t Tony see? Tony needed to shut up and agree before anything else went wrong. And so many things were already going wrong.
“Yeah, and I’d rather not have a repeat on civilians,” Tony stated matter-of-factly as he charged up his one working repulsor.
Tony began to panic. Charging up his one working glove, Tony dashed round the aisles behind Rumlow.
“So are the runs. Is it the runs? Because if it’s not, it can wait,” his tone was, to say the least, testy. Damn, the second elevator was a half a dozen floors below. There was no way he would be able to catch up with Steve at this point. He rapidly stabbed at the elevator button, mentally begging for the elevator to move faster and give him a chance at redemption.
Clint rolled his eyes. “I can’t know everything. That’s Phil’s job. Ever since you put me and Rhodes in charge of opening up the new store, and Pepper’s settled me with babysitting your ass because you do stupid things when left to your own devices, my snooping time had dwindled down to zip. Gotta have someone else fill in the blanks every once in awhile. ”
That is if Steve ever forgave him. Once Tony got his revenge, he could become that type of mobster easily. Using his money and resources to help those less fortunate. Steve would like that. Tony swore, in his muddled state of sleep deprivation, that he would do all that for Steve in a heartbeat. That is, if Steve ever came back.
“No!” But the red flush of his ears betrayed his sinful thoughts.
“You’re special,” he shot back.
Steve, to his credit, only closed his eyes and let out a tired sigh. “Still royally pissed at all this, but maybe eventually.” Steve plopped his big head in the side of Tony’s neck. “I’m just glad you’re safe,” he mumbled into the mix of warm flesh and metal, lips grazing dangerously against the surface.
“What?”
“Understood, sir.”
“Hey,” Sam grabbed Steve’s arm. “I know you’re worried about Bucky. We all are. But don’t let yourself get too carried away. Killing won’t help anyone.”
“But you know what I mean,” replied Obie with a smile. “Relax. Read a book. Take a walk.” Stane took a whiff of Tony’s hair and made a face. “Maybe take a shower too. When was the last time you took care of yourself?”
Tony shrugged nonchalantly. “It happens. A lot more often than you would think, but it happens. I try not to make a big deal out of it.”
"Any hunches you can give me Falcon? Origin? Name?" asked Steve, trying his best to hide his worrying.
“What can I say? I like things that go boom,” replied Rhodey, admiring his reflection in the metal.
Logically Steve understood that both he and Tony led complicated lives. Their sources of income were illegal. Their work and any discussions regarding such topics had to be made of well fabricated lies. As rum runner, Steve understood this. He understood the risks. Sometimes people got caught in the middle of a firefight and he just had to accept that. Yet, why did learning about Tony’s true identity hurt so much? Why did Tony hide his identity from Steve for so long?
“I see you back there,” sneered Rumlow, swinging the glowing gauntlet in front of his face. “Why don’t you come out and play with ol’ Crossbones?”
The smart thing would be to shut down the company without consulting anyone. There would be fallout, sure, the board would be upset, stocks would drop (twenty percent minimum), but Tony could trust Pepper with all that. It would cost him a good sum for nice heels and a fancy evening dress to make it up to her, but in the end it would be worth it. Wouldn’t it?
The covering fools slowed their attack. Frequent “pings” of bullets were now one every few seconds. Perfect.
Steve rolled his eyes and his lips turned up in a fond smile. “You are helping. You got the money out of the hide-box”
Muffled by the helmet and woefully limited by the small eye slots, Tony spotted a red headed woman duck behind a makeshift barricade where the thieves were making their last stand.
“Okay, maybe I was being a bit loud,” Tony amended.
Steve smiled. "Yeah," he murmured in a voice low enough that only Tony could hear. "We're just a couple of rebels trying to take on the world with nothing but homemade gin and some art supplies. Look out America. We might be the next criminal power couple."
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve’s voice was reserved and hesitant.
Thanks again to kuailong for the beta.
There was also a large, white sink on the opposite wall. Two people could easily stand on either side of it and not be feel crowded. To the right of the sink, fraying fabric of various shapes and sizes were stacked on a shelf. Underneath the shelf was a basket already half full of bloody rags.
“Show what?” Tony asked in disgust, almost scared at what the answer could be.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw a suspicious black car pull up alongside. Someone rolled down the window as if to talk to them. Steve was about to stop and investigate, when his eye caught the glint of a barrel slightly larger than a cue stick.
“I think you should take it off,” said Tony, pointedly avoiding looking at his younger counterpart.
Bucky popped a look over their barricade just in time to see War Machine turn and walk away to the noise at the other end of the building.
The next morning, Tony stopped by the werewolf enclosure to wake up their newest resident.
“Don’t do it kid. His taste in fashion is atrocious. He has enough plaid shirts to clothe an lesbian bar,” warned Tony.
“So,” he started, trying to ease the tension as they walked down the poorly lit backstreets of Brooklyn. “You having money problems?”
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “Deal go bad, I take it?” Bucky asked, finally getting why Steve was so angry. Normally Schmit's rants wouldn't rile Steve up enough to for him to start with insults and threats. But today-
“Whyyyy?” whined Tony. “I don’t need to try them. I already told you I don’t like them.”
“Had to pay a hefty fee for offing three perfectly good pigs, but I don’t mind. Least I could do for some justice since Natasha decided to take care of Fisk herself,” Tony said, sliding himself down onto the dirt.
Passing through the threshold, Steve gasped in awe. It was much bigger than the shop front, no doubt about that. A main floor big enough to hold dances spread out in front of them and an open space with a balcony above, richly decorated in a vibrant red and gold trim reached out far above their heads. A large crystal and glass chandelier hung from the ceiling and Steve could only imagine what the place looked like when the lights went up for the night. The place screamed money and high class. He could almost see the shadows of well-dressed gents and fine dames milling about the floor, discussing politics and whatever else the upper class did as they sipped expensive drinks.
"Thor, we need to speed up the processing of the prohibition. Talk to Jane and see what you can do to make things go faster."
“I won’t tell,” offered Steve.
The captain looked down at his shoes attempting to hide his grin. “I mean, if it’s not too much trouble, that’d be really swell.”
Pages about how Steve’s biceps flexed as they pushed and pulled the dough until it was elastic and smooth to the touch. Long diatrads depicting the small beads of sweat that formed like a crown around his brow, glistening in the flickering light of the food truck. Paragraphs describing how his breath grew heavy and more labored with each push of the dough. Or detailed passages about how his eyes grew dark with intensity as he worked the soft mixture between his fingers.
Steve waited a moment before indulging in his. The first drink, it was his favorite part in making giggle juice
“I know every person on payroll. It shouldn’t be that hard to figure out if he’s telling the truth or not. If he is,” She gave him a pointed glare in contempt, not bothering to hide the disdain of his large hand on her small arm. “Kick him out.”
Steve was about to ask what happened, but Tony shook his head. He wasn’t done yet. Brown eyes locked in blue, Tony fingers drifted to the center of the flawless skin. He rubbed small circles into the flesh until something crackled underneath his fingers. Steve’s mouth dropped open as some sort of fabric or plastic covering fell away under Tony’s touch. As Tony pulled away the wrapping, a hypnotizing blue light filled the room.
Over the past two weeks, Tony had gotten better about it all. And despite the mountain of work and stress that Tony found himself drowning in, Steve thought he was slowly working his way into getting a straight answer out of Tony. But after today’s call, he wasn’t quite sure. Tony seemed interested, but maybe he really wasn’t. Maybe Tony was just saying things to placate Steve. But that didn’t make any sense. If he was just trying to entertain Steve and his simple hope for something more, why would Tony go to all the trouble of getting Steve in touch with the Iron Family? It just didn’t make sense.
Tony’s blood turned as cold as the metal cemetery gate. “Excuse me?”
The kid’s jaw dropped.  “Is this…”
Steve looked at the door in complete disbelief. He could hardly believe Dr. Banner wouldn’t let him in. Steve tried the doorknob. Locked. He pushed against the wood with his shoulder. The door didn’t budge. Steve took a few steps away from the door, completely baffled. Why would the doctor shut him out? Steve just wanted to help. Bucky was his best friend. Steve should be by his side, making sure everything was okay. Instead, he was out here, barred by a flimsy wooden door that refused to open.
“Really Bucky? Was that necessary?” asked Steve as he passed his best friend and right hand man hidden between the tight of the brick walls.
“And I told you, Miss Potts will be replacing Ms. Summers, so don’t even bother.”
“You sure?” asked Steve. He didn’t want to push too much, but it really looked like there was something important on the boy’s mind. Something must be holding him back.
“Oh, you know, trying to keep busy. Find work. Chat up some dolls. Create weapons of mass destruction. Take over the world."
Above him, adrenaline drove Steve to laugh out loud in relief. “You’re not so bad,” said a breathless Steve. He licked his lips, dragging the metal blade on the concrete with each confident step he took. “Big man in a metal suit. Take off the armor and let’s see what’s underneath.”
Clint lurched, almost choking on his coffee. “Oh my god.”
“Agreed,” chimed Thor, joining Bucky in his scrutiny.
He dug his palm into his shoulder and rolled over on his injured side, trying his best to put pressure on the injury and lessen the blood flow. Bright sparks from following shots danced by his face as he tried to plan his next move. He curled in on himself and tried to drag his injured body to safety. A few bullets leave burning grazes through his clothes and on his naked skin. He cowered behind a wooden crate and soon enough, the shots of gunfire had stopped, and the sound of breaking bones replaces the silence.
He heard Steve test the shove’s blade against the palm of his hand. The dull thud of each hit reminded Tony exactly what would happen if Steve landed a blow on his neck.
Tony nodded solemnly. “They were new members of the family. Looking for a way out, looking for protection. That’s all they were, kids just trying to make ends meet.
“Hey, it’s okay.” Steve said, placing a reassuring hand on Tony’s shaking shoulder. He smiled and kept his voice as low and as comforting as possible. “Maybe you won’t understand this yet, but he’s not Howard, Tony. He’s you. An older version of you, but he’s still you. You don’t need to be afraid.”
Thor nodded. “Agreed. We should trust our friend. As much as I worry about her health, I know she can take care of herself.”
“Not this guy,” Jan insisted. “Natasha, Carol, and I all had our turns working by the window. He barely looked at us. But now, he’s clearly checking you out.”
“To be fair, I ask myself that every morning before work.”
It was adorable.
“No! Never. It’s just… How do I put this?” Tony steepled his hands in front of his face. “It’s early in the morning. I’m tired and my verbal filter is pretty much nonexistent. But nobody is around to judge us, so I’m just going to come out and say it; how did we meet?”
Steve huffed, not the least interested in the food Tony offered him.
Tony looked down and kicked at the dirt. “What if you don’t like what you see?” he mumbled.
Tony took a moment to look down at his arm. The blood was beginning to clot, but it still looked like a mess. “It’s fine. Just another workplace hazard. Happens all the time.”
Tony let out a sigh of relief. It worked. He was ninety nine percent sure that the RT device would be able to withstand oceanic pressure, but there was always that one percent chance that it wouldn’t.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Look, you’re just going to have to trust me on this one Steve. I know people, and I bet you fifty cents that he’s head over heels for you.”
Steve’s heart skipped a beat. His cheeks turned hot as all other eyes in the room turned their attention to the naive child.
“I second that,” said Natasha.
“But not this many,” Pepper flipped through her clipboard of papers as if to reassure herself that she was right. “There shouldn’t be this many hands in the system. I don’t know. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but too many things aren’t adding up like they should. Lots of people authorizing things incorrectly or filling out papers they have no business with. Nothing that would set off alarms, but the sheer number is unnerving.”
“What do you think Tones?”, he asked, cocky assurance laced into every word.
“Thanks,” said Steve with a sigh of relief. “You don’t know how many times that has caused a fist fight or two. Not easy to be an immigrant here.”
How much time did Tony have before the donut truck had to move to the next army base? They never stayed in one place for more than a week. Sometime they stuck around for a mere three days. Sometimes one. Could Tony attract and woo a legendary American soldier into the back of his car in less than one day? Impossible. The numbers were against him no matter how hard he tried to make it work. Tony would have to be either very brave or extremely foolish to try something as risky as that.
“You didn’t answer my question,” said Steve with defensive force. “Who are you and how do you know my name?”
“At least you appreciate my company. Same could not be said for my date,” Tony said, placing the tray of food down a few meters away from Steve.
Tony glanced over his shoulder and saw the wolf pacing back and forth at the edge of the enclosure; watching them, waiting patiently for the first sign of weakness. “Honestly, I don’t know. But you know me, I love a challenge.”
Tony snorted. “You know, it would be a lot easier if you got a private line.”
Steve’s face paled. “Something that that?” he asked, pointing over Tony’s shoulder.
No beta. Just me. Let me know if there's any spelling/ grammar that doesn't make any sense. Flying solo here since my beta went back to uni!
“When I draw you, I learn something new about the man I love, every time. I’m reminded why I’ll never get tired of the view. I remember why I love you. ”
“Terrible," muttered Tony, quickly shucking the cap to the empty seat by his side. "But if someone asks me to pick one good thing about this stink hole, it wouldn’t be too hard.”
Through the small eye slots, Tony could see the murderous resolve in Steve’s darkened eyes. It sent a chill down his spine knowing that he was the source for Steve’s dark demeanor. “Steve,” Tony begged from behind the mask.
“It’ll be fine. I think it sounds like a day of untapped potential.”
Tony frowned. “It might take you too long to start from scratch. I guess you can help me roll out the dough?”
“Been through worse,” Tony grunted. His arms felt like they were going to fall off any second. They wobbled under his weight, but somehow Tony managed to push himself into a sitting position.
“Just try it,” insisted Steve. “It’s easier on the stomach than coffee and it still has caffeine in it. Thought it would be better for you since it doesn’t look like you’ll be going to bed any time soon.”
“Pepper, I’m not going back," he said putting his foot down. How many times did they have to have this conversation? "Blood for blood. That’s how it works. You come after the boss of the Iron Family with his own weapon, don’t expect to get away with it. What happened to me, with the shrapnel bomb, I’m damn lucky to still be walking around let alone be alive. Yinsen and Bruce patched me up, helped me recover enough to build the arc reactor, but there are people who weren’t as lucky as me. I saw them Pep. I saw their pain. I watched them die and there was nothing I could do about it.”
“I just… It’s hard to explain but-” Tony started to say something, but he stopped himself mid-sentence. “Okay, I do have one last secret. But it’s not a bad one I promise. Just… don’t run, okay?”
Steve grimaced. “There’s got to be another way.”
Steve turned around and looked around at his crew. Sam and Thor stood a few feet behind him ready for orders, but Steve didn’t have any orders to give. Bucky’s well-being was the only thing he could think about. Steve couldn’t do anything until he knew his best friend was safe.
A burst of warmth filled his chest as a pit of guilt pooled into his stomach. Tony had found him. Tony had found him of his own by his own volition, and Steve had greeted like he was a sack of worms. Way to go Rogers. Way to let the pressure of being boss get you so far down, you can’t tell the difference between friend and foe. Tony looked so baffled. He needed to do something to fix this. Not pointing a gun at the guy would be a step in the right direction.
“Hey! Look guys!” Bucky called from one of the long, darkened aisles of crates. “I found a robot!” The excitement in his voice was eerily similar to the blinding smile on Bucky’s face when he got that wooden truck for Christmas years ago.
“Huh. He sounded fairly human,” muttered Bucky.
“I won’t let you get in my way. I won’t let you hold Tony against his will,” growled Steve, stopping inches away from Iron Man’s unmoving form. “I’ll make you pay for everything you’ve done.” Steve shoved the blade of the shovel under Iron Man’s chin, digging the tip into the weak joints along the throat. “First, I’ll beat your head into a pulp. Then, I’ll take Tony someplace where you’ll never find him.”
“Tony!”
Steve's heart clenched in anger. That settled it. Steve grabbed his arm and proceeded to drag Tony back to Steve’s side of the river.
Good news for Iron Man. Better news for Tony.
Tony sighed. He removed his foot and casually walked around to the other side. He looked down at the grunt’s face, covered in dirt, sweat, and blood. “Just to be sure I understand, you’d rather ripped apart to keep your tongue than give up now and go back to your friends and family in one piece.”
“So,” War Machine was apparently crap at starting casual conversations.  “You’re interested in a Tony.”
“No, it’s not,” Tony said, pounding on the table with both his fists. “Wife is a job, right? Just like ‘mommy’ or ‘daddy’. But it’s only boys that can be daddies and only girls that can be mommies. Why can’t a boy be a mommy?”
“Hey, bricks for brains!”
That only made Schmidt’s face flush deeper. Steve was sure Schmidt would hit back, but he soldiered on through in insult. “Do you not see what I mean brothers and sisters? Before the war, Germany was respected. Feared by all. Now we are worth less than cattle. Berated, abused, discriminated against because of our heritage. Let us join forces to create a proud race once more! We are Aryans! We are superior! Hail Hitler!”
“Well, for one thing, names. Lots of names.”
“Why are you looking at me?” accused Clint. If Iron Man could raise a questioning eyebrow, he would.
Just a reminder, active writing and editing will be put on hold until further notice. Stomach pains have subsided, but I'm still being careful and cautious with my health. Chapter 5 will be posted on schedule, but I'm unsure about anything after that. Still intend on finishing.
Please don’t come back drunk
“You mean kiss?” asked Tony with a completely straight face. “You and big me already argue all the time like mom and dad. All we have to do is kiss like Jarvis and Mrs. Jarvis and we’ll be married.”
Tony pushed himself up to a seated position as the fight came back around. He tried to get up, but a claw came at him from his blind spot and dug deep into his arm.
“There is no other way Steve. You saw what that weapon could do. Either I take ‘em down now, or we duck into the nearest safe house until all this blows over.” Tony said, shoving the wires back into the glove with a frustrated grunt. The gauntlet was too damaged to fix. Tony couldn’t make lemonade out of lemons after all. He didn’t have the tools to fix it on such short notice, so he would have to make do with just one. Odds in his favor were getting smaller, but at least he had a blunt object to hit people with.
Bucky’s hand stopped centimetres away from unsettling the gray dust on the unlabelled lid. “Good point,” he said, gingerly moving away. Maybe that brain of his was working after all.
Was if it was true? Was Tony keeping Steve around just because he was useful? What about the flirting? Tony flirted with Steve like it was second nature. Had that been a lie too? Some weird sort of ruse to keep Steve a compliant and willing puppet? It didn’t feel like a lie. The way Tony’s lips curled when he smiled, the way his eyes sparkled when he looked at Steve, the brightness in Tony’s voice when he laughed, that wasn’t a lie. Was it?
The only reply was a groan from a fallen body that Happy had forgotten to run over. The sap was slowly trying to crawl away from the wreckage, but Iron Man spotted a short arrow jutting out of his shoulder. Iron Man sauntered over to the pitiful soul and ground the heel of his black leather shoe into the man’s injured shoulder. The man screamed out in pain.
Not that they really needed saving. All combined, Tony and the girls took out more than half of the enemy soldiers, but the sentiment was appreciated. After chasing away the enemy, the Howling Commandos helped the girls push the truck out of the mud and back onto the road. The girls took the opportunity to fawn over the very attractive men while Tony secluded himself off to make a quick batch of donuts to say thanks. The two groups exchanged stories about their adventures and then went on their merry way. Tony drove off thinking he’d never see the nice men again. At least he did until now
The kid’s mouth twisted into a deep frown as he inspected the adult man in front of him. “You’re old,” he said.
“Captain America likes strawberries,” said Natasha. She plucked a strawberry off the top a popped it right into her mouth. “Don’t you, Steve?”
“Cap? Where’d you go?”
Steve only smiled and licked Tony’s cheek again.
Tony heard her mentally groan. “I’ll see what I can do to keep him out of the shop. If you need me, I’ll be buried up to my ears in paperwork. ”
“Then what’s got his gears all rusted up?” accused Bucky.
“Why not? He’s clearly your type. Blond hair, tight ass, legs for days, and those muscles, god damn,” she groaned. “I’d kill to have him wrap me in those arms.”
“Would it have been thoughtful?”
“God, it must be so nice to be you,” said Tony to Steve as the wolf trotted over, pacing around the man in a lazy circle. “Gold fur, blue eyes, strong lycan muscles for days, you must look like a god when you’re human.”
Tony looked up just in time to see a bright white light fading into the far corner of the warehouse. Shit. That looked like the heat from a repulsor blast. Had Rhodey or Pepper gotten cornered? Had they gotten ambushed?
“Steve, I want to,” he said with a gentle smile, meaning it with every particle of his being. Steve was amazing in all iterations of the word and Tony, well; Tony wanted to do everything he could to let the world see how amazing Steve was. If Steve would let him, Tony would scream his name from the rooftops and paint his name in the sky for all to see. He would relinquish all power just to have Steve fuck him hard day in and day out for the rest of their lives.
“Not before you calm yourself!” Sam said with a snarl.
Within seconds, red and gold scales hidden under his skin slipped through his fleshy membrane and covered his entire lower body. His legs fused together, muscles and bones rearranging themselves to form a single, powerful tail. The slight webbing between his toes stretched and grew until they formed a translucent red fin. The gills around his neck fluttered like wings as they stretched to life.
“Steve!”
“Give it back!” he protested, reaching out to get the paper back.
Tony smiled and took a few steps into his space. "Steve, do you think I'd still be here if I wasn't okay getting my hands a little dirty. I mean, we drank bootleg out of two mason jars. Can't get more criminal than that,” joked Tony in a low voice. The words felt like dancing fingers along the back of his neck.
Tony grinned as he pushed Steve’s hand away. “Well, he’s going to hear it soon anyway. What’s the harm in starting early? ‘Tony, you’re so tight,’” Tony quietly moaned as he walked his fingers up Steve’s chest. “‘I love how your tight ass squeezes my dick.’ ‘Feels so good ramming my cock into your hole.’ ‘I’m going to fill you full of come you dirty slut.’ And don’t forget my favorite, ‘Sit that slutty ass on my lap and fuck yourself on my cock. I want to see your dick bouncing up and down as you take it like the hungry bitch you are.”
Schmidt looked down his nose and eyed the guard’s weapon with absolute contempt. “Rumlow, you still have your guns out. Why?” he asked with a grimace.
“Just dropped in?”
“This isn’t funny!”
“I don’t care about the business. We always have Malibu to support us if things go south. Besides, this isn’t about money. This is about revenge, pure and simple. We have an opportunity that not many other have. We can stop the weapons leak at the source. We can track down the bastards that order the hit on me, and we can end it before they try again. That's it. That's the mission. Stop the leak before someone else gets hurt. What we make is for the battlefield. Nowhere else. I don't know if you realize, but my name is on the line. And I'll be damned it I let someone ruin it while I stand by the sidelines twiddling my thumbs like some idiot.  We stop it here and now, and make damn sure that it doesn't happen again. Do I make myself clear?”
Tony nervously bit down on his lower lip. His eyes flickered over Steve’s shoulder to catch a glimpse at his older self, and then back to the ground. His feet were fidgeting a bit and there was a tiny sparkle of curiosity in his eyes, but he held onto Steve’s hand like a lifeline. “No,” he said.
“Well, tell me next time you set me up like that,” grumbled Steve. “Almost got chewed out because of your little surprise.”
Cue the next day when Clint swapped Tony’s morning coffee with a frothy caramel Frappuccino. Steve said Tony would never fall for such an obvious prank, Sam bet ten dollars that Tony would, and Natasha just sat on the sidelines, eager to watch the fallout over her breakfast.
“Not like it can do anything to us.” The rap of knuckles on metal rattled Steve’s nerves.
“Did you not see what he just did?” Steve harshly whispered, his voice bordering on hysterics.
Tony shook his head. He couldn’t let doubt could his vision. He was Iron Man. He shouldn’t be intimidated by a bunch of thugs just because they go their hands on some big guns. He had bigger, better guns than they would ever have, and he’d use them to take those scum loving bastards out one by one so they suffered a long, painful death.
A panicked chill ran down Tony’s back. “Since they were… puppies?”
“Miss?”
Steve looked at the door and prayed it would open. It did not.
"You got it boss," said Clint, almost skipping out of the room. Most likely, he was creating a shopping list of where to pick up necessary supplies.
Steve went back into the beach house and came out a few minutes later with his sketchbook in hand and actual clothes on his body. He sat down on the chair alongside Tony and, as he had done so many times over the years, flipped the book open to an empty page, twirled the pencil around in his hand, and began to draw.
“I was. I finished,” he stated bluntly. “I thought you two broke up months ago.”
He tried to hold out. He really did. But when Clint filled Tony’s mug up with 10 ounces of full strength Italian espresso, Steve threw his hat in the ring in if only to offer Tony some relief from the team’s daily torment. At least, that’s what he told himself at first.
“I am not! I’m wasn’t that sensitive as a kid.”
“In the breadline?” asked Bucky, taking the lead.
“I can handle myself just fine,” snapped Tony.
Tony became deathly still. Despite the pain of his wounds, he still felt the phantom heat on his lips. Steve had kissed him and risked it all despite the possible fall out if Tony didn’t return Steve’s affections (which was stupid because Tony was a little head over heels about Steve). He had done that despite the firefight, patched him up, and gone as far to try to go for help without a second thought. Steve was worth everything, and yet Tony put him in danger just by being around him.
The gravity of Tony’s words sunk in. Dammit. Tony didn’t want the news to come out this way. Yes, he did eventually want to reduce production and sales to make sure weapons got into the right hands, but this wasn’t how or when he wanted to break it to Obie. Tony rubbed his temples. The exhausting work over the past two weeks was making him sloppy. If he didn’t watch his mouth he might let everything slip.
“Local friend,” he quickely fibbed.
Tony nodded. “Positive. I know we get yelled at for a lot of things in life, but this shouldn’t be one of them. You shouldn't be punished for loving something. Or, someone.”
“TONY!”
Tony's sass meter goes up.
“I’m not surprised,” said Vision. “FRIDAY showed me the equations AIM used for the time machine. AIM’s process of pulling Tony into the present, it seemed as if one thing went wrong, the entire thing would collapse in on itself.”
Tony wanted to be relieved at the news, but he was worried about Steve. If Clint spilled about the incident (even by accident) Steve would be the one in trouble, not Tony. Because of his position and money, Tony would only have to worry about a few unsavory rumors passing between party tables and business would continue as usual. However, Steve was a working man. If Steve’s employers, present or future, ever found out it would be goodbye employment and goodbye social standing.
Tony’s brain screeched to a halt. “What do you mean ‘backup’?”
Hope swelled in Steve’s chest. “So, he’s-”
“So do these guys,” griped Rhodey.
“Yes boss,” confirmed Clint. Without a second to loose, a black shadow dashed out of the warehouse and after the car.
Shit.
“Tony-”
“Easy,” said the guy. “Just trying to help out.”
A small spark of hope flickered beneath the arc reactor. Maybe there was some hope after all.
Steve grabbed the man by the neck and hauled him up to his feet. Steve dug his fingers into the goon’s throat until Steve’s knuckles turned white. The man choked on his breath. He tried to squirm his way out of Steve’s grasp, but with his hands bound behind his back and his feet dangling a few inches above the ground, there was little he could do.
“You could always ignore her.”
Even if they met up again, despite Tony’s intentions to keep his distance, Steve would always be in danger. Tony’s name, the mafia family, the company, his money, the arms that he sold, they would all be reason to use Steve as leverage to get to Tony. Heaven knew what his angry rivals would do make Steve talk if they got their cold sweat hands on him. Tony had certainly employed a few unpleasant techniques in vengeance against the Ten Rings Gang. Torture, kidnaping, starvation, interrogation; he couldn’t do that to Steve no matter how strong the temptation to return the kiss. Tony had to stay focused on the mission. It was the only way he could protect those he cared about.
Rhodey glared at Steve. “You know I still don’t trust you, right? After all the bullshit you pulled with the Accords, I don’t trust you to take care of either of them.”
Silence fell over the conversation. No response from the Iron Family. Finally, Clint coughed in hesitation, breaking through the white noise. “Uh… You know I was talking to Iron Man, right?”
“Why?” Tony asked, chasing after Steve’s lips. “Don’t you want to sex me up?”
Steve noticed how his group nodded in hesitant agreement.
“Yeah. They liked it so much that the wanted to start production immediately.”
“Then stay out of my operating room and let me job!” Dr. Banner yelled, slamming the door behind him.
“What?”
“Can I sit on him?”
“Got any better ideas?” asked Sam, gray debris speckling the air.
was more than enough rubbernecking for Tony Stark, thank you very much. “Now can I go after my weapons?”
“Why would he think that?”
Most was better than none. And at the pace Schmidt’s crew was driving, there was no way the Iron Family could catch them. “Steve, let him go. We got what we came for.”
And yet he had to. If he didn’t take it, he would die. It he took it, someone else might die in his place. It wasn’t that he needed it more than them, whoever ‘they’ were, but he needed to do what was necessary to protect his people. It was days like today that he hated that the world was such a cold and unfair place.
“Don’t worry Tony. I took it to R&D to have them refine it,” Stane replied with careless confidence.
“Jarvis made them, now shut up. Third, we gave that up in about two months.”
Clint wasn’t given the codename “Hawkeye” for nothing. And that’s exactly what it was, nothing. Tony just had to stick to it. “Barton, now would be a good time to shut up,” warned Tony. ‘Smooth Stark. Don’t say anything that could be misinterpreted. Why not give them another reason to leave you high and dry.’
He rubbed an exasperated hand down his face. “Look, just give it to Pep or put it on the secretary desk right there. It’ll get taken care of,” he said, trying not to snap. Tony needed to keep his feelings under control, and this doll wasn’t helping.
Tony tried to confirm that he was capable, but it came out as a pitiful whine. He rolled over on his good shoulder and tried to stand. Strong hands gripped his blood soaked clothes and pulled him up the rest of the way.
“Or what?” asked Steve, wrapping Tony into a loose hug. “You have something particular in mind?”
Pepper shrugged. “Well, whoever she is, I hope she knows what she’s getting into.”
Tony’s heart skipped a beat. “Wait, that’s-”
Tony hummed. “Must have pulled something in my sleep.”
“Why not both?”
“Would I lie to a pretty doll like yourself?” Tony asked, smooth as a con-man.
“What the hell are you trying to do?” asked Stane, removing the needle off the record before removing a hand from his ear.
Tony smiled. He liked that about Steve. Steve was just so easy to talk to. Didn’t matter that Tony was essentially flirting with a person of the same sex, Steve took it all in stride. He didn’t yell at Tony for being a ‘goddamn fairy’ even though he didn’t mean it. Well, maybe he did mean it a little. But it was refreshing all the same. There were very few people that lit up Tony’s world, and Steve was slowly working his way into becoming one of them.
Who was he kidding? He was Tony fucking Stark. He was Iron Man, leader and boss of the infamous Iron Family. He could do whatever the fuck he wanted and ask Pepper to send one of her famous “I’m sorry my boss is an idiot,” fruit baskets later.
Tony let out a heavy sigh. “Pot. Kettle. Doesn’t matter anymore. Cat’s out of the bag. This is as bad as it can get. Unless,” Tony paused for dramatic effect. “Unless you’ve got something else you’d like to confess, Steve.”
“But Tony-”
Tony shook the thought from his head. He didn’t have time to think about that now. He had to focus on getting back to the ship and making himself presentable.
Steve blinked in shock. “What?” They were going to accept his decision just like that?
“No!” Tony exploded. “It’s my product and I didn’t not give the okay. It’s my name on the line, not yours, and I have the majority of the share in the company. I don’t care if you are a friend of the family. I will fire your ass right here, right now if you don’t stop production immediately.”
“Care to explain what that mean in Standard English?” Steve did not seem impressed at Tony’s ramblings.
"You sure that's a good idea?" he heard Bucky whisper.
Bucky nodded. “Yeah? What? You didn’t hear him?”
Everywhere he looked, there were smiles on all faces. "Reverse psychology," smirked Sam. "Works every time."
“Let be me the judge of that.” Steve halted his rescue attempt. “Please?”
Tony smirked. “Got me there Rogers.”
Tony let out a breath of relief and dropped the rock. “Damn it Hawkeye. Don’t sneak up on me like that.”
Steve released a tired rush of air. Damn his pride. He might as well say it. Couldn’t make things any worse for them. “Unless you got access to a weapons cache, don’t know how much help anyone can be,” he muttered, not caring if she could clearly hear him.
Steve snorted in amusement.
“Absolutely not,” said Tony. “Rhodey would kill me if I did that.”
A limping Bucky tried to approach them, but Steve just growled as he pressed his paw into Tony’s back.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“And how many times do you think I’ve heard that,” she asked, crossing her arms in clear annoyance. “I’ve only been here a few weeks, and even I know the people who organize and categorize all these forms are crap at their job.”
“Steve’s here?” Pepper’s eyes were wide behind the silver mask. “The same Steve that dropped by the office?”
“In any case,” said Tony, desperate for a change of topic, “ I’ll get the fryer going so we can start feeding the boys outside. Natasha?”
Tony's brain was running a thousand miles a minute. Devilish thoughts and ideas cascaded around his brain as warm dark arousal pooled in his gut. It was a familiar song and dance for Tony. Entice a man with a broken radiator and the next thing you know, you want to bend a blond over backwards and fuck an artist (and be fucked by said artist) six ways to Sunday. Normally, Tony would distract himself from such sinful thoughts by reciting all prime numbers up to eight digits, but today was turning out to be harder than most.
“You’re soft and flexible, yet as hard and as stubborn as raw iron. You burn like the sun, yet you never let those you love catch fire. Your body is covered in scars from betrayal and years of fighting an unwinnable war, yet you still carry your heart on your sleeve. You’re one of the smartest men I know. You can talk circles around me any day of the week, yet I never feel stupid.
Steve resisted the urge to frown. Small talk? Was that necessary? But she was being an absolute doll in taking him to see Tony, so he did his best to humor the lady without insulting her intelligence. “We meet in the breadline a few weeks back.”
Everything happened so fast. Tony tried to get between the wolves to break up the fight. He yelled “Stop!” and “Break it up!” but his cries fell on deaf ears. The weres darted back and forth among the trees, trying to get the upper hand on each other. Tony got close to grabbing Bucky’s scruff, but the wolf darted out of the way at the last second. He was about to try again when one of the wolves got a little too close and knocked him off balance.
“It’s rude.”
“Fine.” Steve verbally pushed back, ignoring Tony’s complaint. “You take Bucky and I do the responsible thing and take Tony home.”
The wolf only whined and pulled him closer.
Something was off. Steve could tell. It wasn't the feeling that Sam knew more. Sam gave Steve all he got. He always did. But that wasn't what was off. There was something more going on.
“I’m no doctor Steve,” Tony said in a hushed tone. “But that it looks more than just a black eye.”
Steve nodded in agreement as wordless seconds of shared history passed between them. Things like that didn’t need to be said. It was a common enough experience among first generation Americans. The bullying, prejudice, pain, and confusion was something they faced every day. To find someone else with a similar story in such a bustling city was always an unsaid comfort. To know you weren’t alone, or going crazy, as faceless people went about their business was a reassurance.
Running out and down to a busier street, Steve tried to wave down a cab. Precious seconds ticked by as cars whizzed on their merry way. It took forever to Steve to spot the familiar shape of a taxi car and even longer for him to finally attract the attention of the driver. Looking like a filthy, bloody mess didn’t help any in attracting people to help him. When he was finally able to get a cab to sit and stay, he ran back for Tony, praying to God that the guy hadn’t bled to death.
As if remembering that Steve couldn’t read his mind, Tony reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a business card. With a black pen, he quickly scrawled a set of numbers down. “Don’t know if you’d ever need it, but the number is a direct line to me. If you ever come in person, just tell the front desk that you’re looking for Tony. Only been working there for a little over a week, so I don’t have my own business cards yet. Think it’ll work okay? ”
Natasha turned to face him, eyeing the bottle sized lump in Tony’s bag. “I said I don’t mind the company. I know how hard holidays can be when you’ve lost someone important.”
The slim figure chuckled. “Looks like you lost something important,” said a familiar female voice.
Finally, Steve looked down at the mug in his hands and let out a heavy sigh. “We didn’t really ‘meet.’ At least, not in the traditional sense. I was a doll in the Dollhouse. My memories and personality were erased from my brain, digitized, and saved onto a wedge. I was pretty much a blank slate and you were the genius scientist looking down from your ivory tower. The extent of our interactions should have been limited to treatments. Before an encounter, you or Fury would call me up, I’d visit you, and you’d give me a new personality that met the request of a client.
In the living room, Clint covered his eyes and screamed, “Are you kidding me!”
The white wolf tried to approach, but Tony stopped him in his tracks.
Tony slowly woke up with the morning sun warming his back, the smell of saltwater in his nose, and the sound of crashing waves breaking on the white sand. A cool breeze from an open window of the beach house embraced Tony’s naked body while sleepy legs tangled themselves further into soft sheets.
Tony never could say “no” to a pretty blond.
Steve paused. “A war story?” he asked, not quite sure if he heard the request correctly.
Steve shifted in his seat.  “So,” he said, changing the subject. “What is it you wanted to show me?”
Tony reached for some loose fabric of the nightshirt. But the kid was fast. He dodged out of Tony’s reach and in less than a second, the kid had pushed himself up on the counter. He crawled across the counter until he was face to face with Steve. The kid grabbed Steve’s face with both hands and placed a syrupy, wet kiss on Steve’s lips.
"Less talking, more shooting," yelled Steve as popping out when he could to let loose a random bullet in hopes of landing a hit. With only a side arm and a few bullets. Steve and Sam did their best to hold their own, but they were clearly outnumbered and outgunned.
“That.”
“You might not, but I assure you, I do,” Tony bragged and Steve had to bit his tongue to keep himself from reminding him about the time they had ran into a killer toaster in the kitchen. Tony’s inventions didn’t always turn out well, especially when they were the result of hours of sleep and food deprivation. “Are we there yet?”
“No.” His voice was barely a whisper.
Steve knew it was just a way to keep him occupy and refrain him from playing with Clint, though he couldn’t understand why nor he could bring himself to contradict Tony. The mere thought of making him cry oppressed his heart. It was better to wait. Tony was looking more and more tired by the minute, so Steve might be able to put him down for a nap soon and that way he could have some quality time with Clint to avoid making him feel left aside.
“’cause you are.”
“Yes you do! And you’re going to tell me this instant because now I have to deal with your teacher, otherwise she’ll be a pain in my ass!” Howard yelled, putting slamming down the glass not in a nicely way.
"Why did you ask me to spar with you if you were feeling little?" Steve couldn’t help scolding.
“One of your teachers called. She was worried about you. She told me you’ve been seen sneaking these out for a while now. So, would you mind telling me why is that? Why is my twelve-year-old son stealing fucking diapers?” Howard asked, his voice far from polite or calm.
“Is he okay, JARVIS?” Steve asked, not waiting for the elevator doors to be completely open to step out.
What time was it? He stared at the window while trying to figure out why there wasn’t any light outside when just some minutes ago there was daylight. Oh yeah, keeping track of the time wasn’t one of his skills when he was working himself until exhaustion.
The fact that Clint was hugging a stuffed animal to his chest and wearing what clearly looked like a diaper wasn’t what unsettled Tony, but rather the fact that Tony had to refrain himself with all his might from going down there, a strong desire of occupying Clint’s place taking over him.
It would take Steve a few more days to realize there had been only one thing Tony had never pointed at or touched, but for the time being, he was more than satisfied with how everything turned out to be that day.
“Anything,” Steve promised before clearing his throat to begin reading out loud.
I leave? Who said I was leaving?”
JARVIS had been making that suggestion every twenty minutes for the last three hours and it was getting on his nerves. Not only that meant he had been making mistakes regularly, but also that his capability of concentration was decreasing considerably, something Tony couldn’t afford to do right now. He needed to sign all those papers as soon as possible if he didn’t want to be dragged to his office – it had happened before, so Tony knew it wasn’t an empty threat – by a furious Pepper and locked up there until he had caught up with all the backlog, which usually turned out to date back a year or so.
Sometimes, when someone from the team made a comment of how better their weapons would be if they were capable of doing certain things, Tony’s brain worked at the speed of light to visualize how he could make those improvements possible, and he developed them. That was alright, he didn’t mind carrying out those ideas, he enjoyed improving things, and helping others during battle by providing them with more powerful and useful weapons was always kind of fulfilling.
Tony got more restless, eyes darting from side to side unable to hold Steve’s gaze. “y-you-u,” he stuttered, voice so low even Steve struggled to hear it.
“W-wanna g-go.”
"Tony?" Steve called, startling him a little. "Hey, hey baby, it's okay," Steve soothed, placing a hand on his forearm. When had he gotten closer?
"Don't you wanna play a little bit before we leave?" Steve proposed, still encouraging him to take the rubber duck. Tony grabbed it, but did nothing but stared at it. "Maybe the toys I chose are not appropriate for your age, huh? Perhaps I should’ve bought some for bigger kids?" he wondered with a slightly disappointed tone of voice while he put his elbows on the edge of the tub and looked at Tony.
He gathered all the items scattered on the bed, placed the onesie and the diaper on Tony’s lap, turned on his heels and walked away to the closet to put back what Tony didn’t seem to want to wear for the time being. When he went back, a thin smile edged his lips, but it was soon replaced by line of confusion between his eyebrows. Tony hadn’t moved an inch.
“No.”
“Yes, you did!”
“I’m sorry, I don’t get what you’re saying,” Steve declared, finally taking his eyes off Clint to look at Phil. Maybe eye contact was necessary for him to understand what Phil wanted to say, because he was not following him at all.
Well, he'll be damned.
(See the end of the chapter for
First of all, thank you so much for your kudos and comments, they do cheer me up! :D
“You were taking forever,” Steve justified himself as he adjusted his clothes nervously. His worry might have altered his perception of time, though he decided to keep that information to himself. Phil bridged the distance between them and closed the window.
When Steve removed his hands from Tony’s shoulders and walked past him towards the door, Tony felt an inexplicable lump in his throat, as if a sob was trying to escape from it.
“So, was JARVIS lying?” Steve asked.
In spite of himself, Tony stood up and walked towards the elevator after asking JARVIS where Steve was.
With a skill that he had acquired without realizing it, Steve proceeded to unsnapped the crotch of the white and blue striped onesie that Tony was wearing, revealing the diaper underneath. All the blocks that had been decorating it had disappeared, which only confirmed the diaper was wet. When Steve undid the straps, he could see out of the corner of his eyes how Tony observed him with half-open eyes. The expression of mortification Tony usually wore whenever his diaper was changed was now replaced with one of pure curiosity, though the sight of pink blush on his cheeks continued appearing.
“I–,” Tony trailed off, not knowing what to say. Squirming a bit, he looked back and forth between Steve’s and Phil’s scowls and Clint’s hurt expression, and when tears began welling into his eyes, panic spread though Tony’s body.
“Are you going to eat, take a shower and go to bed?” Steve questioned, looking up but keeping his face close to Tony’s belly. When the latter didn’t answer right away, Steve blew yet another raspberry while his hands took care of his sensitive ribs.
“Don’t want it,” Tony said, tensing a bit when he saw that Phil had gotten closer. “Won’t happen again.”
“Tony… hey buddy… relax… come on, breathe buddy,” Steve said as he looked how the other man’s expression changed from worry to terror. “Tony, it’s all right, I swear it’s all right. I really don’t care about it. I’m totally OK with it, I promise. And I will never tell anyone about this if that’s what you’re worrying about, I promise… come on, calm down.”
Hey, I'm still alive.
At the begining I thought going straight to diapers and bottles would be too rushed, but then I figured Steve had been wanting this for a while, and he certainly wants Tony to be a baby, not a toddler, so, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't hesitate to go for what he wants. And Tony being OK with that? Well, if Steve had asked for his opinion, Tony might not have agreed to diapers and bottles just out of shame, but besides the fact that he does want to please Steve, deep down he enjoys those things too. It would take him a little while to figure that out, though.
(See the end of the chapter for
But there was nothing Steve could do except waiting patiently, otherwise Tony would never come around.
Tony squirmed a bit nervously as his cheeks grew faintly pink. Steve wondered what thought had made him react that way.
“I haven’t finished,” Tony argued, looking anxious.
The cuddles continued for several more minutes, where Steve did nothing but simply hold him tightly against his chest. It felt very nice. Tony had missed this interaction a lot, and it was more than obvious that Steve had too. Why had Tony thought it’d be a good idea to give up this? Right now, he couldn’t really tell. There was no doubt that this kind of relationship could lead to some disastrous outcomes, but Tony began thinking this was the kind of situation were the pros were more outweighing than the cons.
“What? When did he leave?”
Tony shook his head, maybe a bit too fast and hard. “Go.”
“How can you like it?”
Tony grumbled, “couldn’t you take it to the workshop with you? Did you really have to make me come all the way here?”
“Where does that come from?” Tony asked back, his body tensing.
“Why didn’t you tell me you wanted to go to the bathroom as soon as you felt like to?” Steve couldn’t help scolding, frustrated because the buckles refused to be unfasten and it was obvious that Clint wouldn’t be able to hold it anymore.
There, Steve had to manage to heat up the dinner using only one hand, since the other one was supporting Tony, who refused to let go during the process.
“Would you stop that already?” Tony demanded, sounding both angry and tired. “Don’t make me downgrade you to a simple personal assistant for phones.”
First, Steve had had to calm Clint down, as using his diaper had caused him a second meltdown. In order to do that, Steve had picked him up and rocked him, which was only possible after putting Tony down on the bed. Tony hadn’t liked that at all, and Steve ended up with two crying littles, one demanding to be allowed to leave and another one demanding to be scooped up.
“You placed it in my arms when I was already asleep!” Tony argued.
“I’m not hungry!”
“You must be hungry, you haven’t eaten anything,” Steve pointed out as he ran a hand through his hair, feeling more and more frustrated by the minute. A caregiver was supposed to make sure littles were safe and content, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he had been doing a lame job up until now.
Steve kept smiling as Tony squirmed trying to figure out what to choose next. The rocking chair was one of the things Tony wanted to keep, that meant he liked being held and rocked while being read a book or fed a bottle, right? Because Steve had no recollection whatsoever of seeing him sitting there by himself, not even once. That certainly made Steve happy, since having the chance to cuddle his baby and see how he adorably fought a lost battle against sleep was something he really enjoyed doing, and it would’ve been a real shame if he wasn’t allowed to do anymore.
Steve went after him again, this time faster, and literally carried him to the chair. He had to repeat this action around fifteen times. Did Tony really think he could get away from him when he wasn’t wearing his armor? He was a genius, he did know that wasn’t possible. He was doing it just to piss him off. And Steve was afraid it was working. Sometimes he ran as soon as he left him sitting down on the chair, sometimes he waited until he was all settled and ready to start eating. Sometimes he even pretended to take the fork to his mouth, before standing up and running.
“When… when you leave,” Tony tried to rephrase. Apparently, the misery he was experiencing had provoked him certain obliviousness, as he hadn’t realized Steve’s exclamation wasn’t the result of not having understood, but rather than just pure and utter shock.
“Go? Where?” Steve questioned. Had anything happened? Why was Clint demanding to go again?
- - - -
“You prefer to be with him,” Tony murmured, squeezing his hands together.
“Oh, sweetheart,” Steve sympathized, realizing what had happened.
, Phil thought to himself before turning around and starting walking towards the door; adult Tony didn’t seem to be very fond of being touched, so it was very probable that little Tony didn’t like it either. Out of the corner of his eye, Phil could see Tony squirming a little, clearly indecisive whether to follow him or not, only taking some steps forward when Phil reached the door and open it.
“I know, I don’t know what I was thinking, I can’t really understand why I did what I did now,” Steve acknowledged, turning his head to look at Phil. “And I’m sorry for telling him about that, I really didn’t mean to, I swear it just slipped out,” he apologized, turning his head now to look at Clint.
Maybe what Tony needed was a playmate, one of his ‘own age’. Playing with another little might be the thing that made the difference in his behavior, and what better option than Clint? Clint surely knew how to have fun with any toy, he made noises when he played with toy cars and airplanes, imitating their real sound; he faked his death way too dramatically when they played with water pistols – a bad idea when you were inside, Phil made sure to point out; he hid in places that would be unreachable for a real toddler when they played hide-and-seek, though he always gave away his hiding place because he couldn’t stop laughing. Even if Steve still wanted Tony to be a baby, it would be nice to see him playing like Clint did every now and then.
Steve walked as slowly as he could so he wouldn’t disturb his little boy’s trip to dreamland. They went straight to the captain’s floor, which, thankfully, was directly below Tony’s. He might as well have stayed at Tony’s, but there were no longer any of the supplies necessary to put him down to bed sleep on Tony’s floor. Everything was kept in that nursery, and now it was completely wrecked.
Clint kept shaking his head. “D-dun want p-pizza.”
“So?” Steve urged, Tony fidgeted in discomfort. “Okay Tony, help me out here, because I’m very confused. You got upset because you don’t want me to be Clint’s daddy, but even if that came to happen, I just don’t understand how that’d be a problem. I’m nobody’s daddy, and that’s only because you were the one who didn’t want me to be your daddy anymore in the first place,” he pointed out, and he couldn’t help feeling a bit bad when a shadow of dismay crossed Tony’s face. “Am I wrong?”
Before his brain had time to register what he was doing, Tony rushed to the bed and pushed Clint off Steve’s lap, sending him to the floor. Phil hurried to his side and helped him sit up.
“Yes?” Phil answered, looking up at the roof as he raised an eyebrow in confusion. JARVIS hardly ever spoke to him.
“To show a gift I’ve got for you,” Steve informed, hands rubbing Tony’s upper arms affectionately in an attempt to cool him off.
“Do you really want to go to bed without wearing one while we are sharing the bed?” And that was the only thing he needed to say in order to convince him. Because Tony might not like the idea of wearing diapers, but he liked it more than the idea of wetting the bed while he was sleeping next to Steve.
And then, Phil explained him everything. How sometimes Clint had a really hard time dealing with, well, life. A superhero life. How they had tried an endless number of things to help him cope with stress, and how nothing had worked. How they had come across with a website which talked about age play and how they had decided to give it a try. How odd it had been at the beginning, and how everything had fit in eventually. How it had helped Clint, and how both of them came to really enjoy it.
“C’mon,” Steve encouraged as he gently pushed his baby away and gave his diapered bottom a couple of pats.
“Well, you weren’t planning on leaving this mess like this, were you?” Steve asked with a disapproving tone of voice. Tony groaned loudly as he let himself fall back on the floor. He should have built that maid robot before opening the boxes.
“I’m sorry sweety,” Steve apologized. Tony always winced when the baby wipes came into contact with his skin, “I’m almost done,” he promised.
The whole choosing thing had proven to be quite successful with Tony, so Steve thought it wasn’t such a bad idea to continue with the same tactic. If Steve asked Tony whether he liked or disliked being diapered on a changing table, he would probably get all flustered and failed to answer; however, if Tony just had to do a simple motion to indicate that was one of the things he enjoyed, it’d be more probable he managed to do the task without so much fuss.
“Bathroom,” Tony insisted, though he didn’t resist when Steve pulled him back closer to him.
“Shhh Tony, it’s OK, I promise we’ll talk tomorrow, but now, just go back to sleep, it’s midnight,” Steve said, rocking both of them back and forth.
Anyway, hope you liked it, and as usual, if you spotted any mistake, please let me know :)
“That didn’t mean I wasn’t gonna keep my promise,” Phil remarked, “let it be the last time you go into the kitchen when no adult’s around,” he ordered, his tone of voice as serious as possible so there wasn’t the slightest doubt he meant it. Clint nodded shyly, squirming a little under Phil solemn expression. “And you’re going to explain your uncle Steve why his kitchen looks like a volcano of chocolate erupted there, you know how much he dislikes mess. Now, please stay still so I can finish washing you.”
Steve promised not to say anything to anyone before leaving the room, a bit taken aback. Though his astonishment hadn’t been caused by all what Phil had said, but by his own brain. Because that scene he had witnessed, Clint curled up into a small ball, wearing a diaper and sucking his thumb, while resting his head on Phil’s thighs, was well imprinted in his mind.
Steve rotated onto his rear leg to dodge the punch Clint had thrown at him, holding his fists up in case he decided to attack again.
“I… Iwannaplay,” Tony blurted out so fast that the words slurred together.
With clumsy movements, Tony got up from the couch, bridged the distance between them and sat down on Steve’s – Daddy’s – lap, throwing his hands around Steve’s neck and hiding against his shoulder almost right away.
“I didn’t know what?”
Everybody left, that was what Tony had stated, and Steve couldn’t refute it wasn’t a well-grounded assumption. Some way or another, people had abandoned Tony throughout his life, and even if some of those departures had been for the best – Steve didn’t even want to imagine how Tony’s life would be if Obadiah Stane were still alive – that didn’t mean they hadn’t left a mark on Tony. They had hurt, and they had scarred his trust on people in a way that it would take a lot of work and time for him to heal.
“Daddyyyy,” Tony whined in apparent misery. Steve huffed, his lips sewn into a grimace, knowing exactly what Tony’s aim was.
“I love you so much, baby boy, and I always will,” Steve whispered into Tony’s ear, making his baby curl deeper into him.
Second, well, I guess I'm still keeping it slow, but I do think Tony needs time to come to terms wih everything. Steve would surely keep encouraging him, and pushing him to go beyond his comfort zone, but not that drastically.
Tony sighed in relief, he didn’t feel comfortable lying to Steve, especially when he was feeling little, but it was kind of necessary right now. Unfortunately, Tony didn’t remember that things never turned out as he expected, and when he was leaning forward to get back to bed, Steve moved closer to him and hefted him up with ease.
“Ha, ha, ha.” Tony faked a laugh, throwing a pillow to Steve’s face, but the latter caught it before it hit him. Damn super soldier reflexes.
“Well, I take it back.” Tony’s eyes were looking everywhere but Steve. Surely he was trying to figure out an escape route. Steve was standing between him and the door, making impossible for Tony to leave the room without having to dodge him first, which was going to be very hard for him – impossible, actually.
“Always, always, always,” Steve repeated as he nuzzled Tony’s neck playfully, causing his baby to let out a soft and surprised giggle.
Well, it turned out it was.
“I said nothing,” Tony lied as he straightened up.
“Stories are for babies,” Clint argued, sulking. Steve had noticed Clint was paying more attention to the story than to the cars he was playing with on the floor, though Steve thought it would be better not to point that out.
"Okay!" Clint said too happily as he got up from the floor and ran to the kitchen.
Tony just wished this whole thing were easy. He just wanted to go with the flow. He wished his father had never found out. He wished he had never been forced to deal with all the psychologists who made him believe this was inappropriate. But apparently nothing was going to be easy for him, never, having an incredible brain and a huge wealth didn’t help him at all this time.
If you saw any mistakes, please let me know :)
And Tony said
“I don’t recall making you come to bed,” Steve said, putting down the book on his lap, “but I’m very glad you’re here,” he hurried to add, not wanting Tony to take his comment in a bad way.
When Steve opened his eyes again, Tony was already fast asleep, the pacifier had fallen out of his mouth and a thin stream of drool had trailed across his cheek, dampening Steve’s t-shirt. Steve just shrugged and pull Tony a little bit closer. He could have stood up and lay Tony on the crib, but he wanted to enjoy more the closeness. He was hardly ever lucky enough to put Tony down without having the experience a huge tantrum before, and he was determined to take advantage of it.
“But–” Tony trailed off, failing to translate into words everything that was going on inside his head.
Tony looked at Steve. He looked at Steve’s hand. Then, he looked at Steve’s lap, foreseeing where he was going to end up, and looked up at Steve once more. Rolling his eyes at him, Tony held Steve’s hand and let himself be pulled off the chair and led towards him, being turned around so he could sit down on Steve’s lap sideways, an arm surrounding his waist.
If you spot any mistakes, please let me know :)
“What’s the matter, sport?” Steve wanted to know.
There was no way he was going to leave this floor until Steve made sure he had something in his stomach and at least five hours of sleep. Maybe Tony should take advantage of this and rest. He hated to admit it, but he obviously needed it. Even if he achieved to escape and go back to his workshop, he wouldn’t be able to finish what he was working on, and it was rather frustrating that he couldn’t have been able to remember what that was yet.
“Jesus, Tony, are you OK?” Steve hurried and squatted down in front of him, scanning his body looking for injuries.
Shamefully, Tony couldn’t succumb to that desire no mattered how badly he wanted to; the reason why he’d decided to put an end to all that role-play thing was a valid one, and he was not willing to go back on it. If he could ignore vital things like hunger and exhaustion, ignoring that part of him who wanted to be Little should be a piece of cake. And it kind of was for some time, at least until Tony saw Steve babysitting Clint. That day everything began going downhill.
So, Steve just wanted to soak in the moment. He just wanted to keep holding Tony against his chest and enjoy how his baby melted into the embrace as though this was something genuinely longed for, how his baby nuzzled like a kitten into the comforting warmth, how his baby squirmed happily when he pressed kisses to the top of his head and how his baby smiled shyly when he whispered into his ear how much he’d missed him and loved him.
I wrote this in my job, with no internet (we haven't had Internet in more than a week, which is awful because we can't really work like that and is soooo freaking boring) so, I couldn't really look up for some words or expressions that I wasn't sure how to express. So, if there are more mistakes than usual, sorry in advance (let me know if you see any n_n')
“Promise?” Clint asked as he let Steve put his legs down on the bed.
Steve could feel his heart breaking in two, he hated seeing Clint cry. “Oh, sweetheart, come here, don’t cry, your daddy’s gonna be home soon,” Steve soothed as he grabbed Clint’s hands and pull him closer, guiding him to his lap. He had already gotten JARVIS to contact Phil, and he had said he would be back as soon as some rookies finished their mission.
After his parents’ deaths, Tony finally had the chance to be who he was, but the feeling of being and doing something wrong never left him. It wasn’t until after the kidnapping when he could no longer resist slipping into his Little headspace anymore. And even then, the only things he allowed himself to do werewas suck his thumb and play with some legos he had asked JARVIS to purchase for him online. Nobody could know his dirty little secret. There was already a lot of bad press all over the world about him and his one night stands, but nothing related to this infantile side of him. Well, nobody but JARVIS, but that was totally different.
Tony looked away. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s nothing bugging me.”
When he had the Stark Tower built, he made sure to include a spare room on his floor, which remained empty for a long time.
Measuring himself was not something Steve tended to do when they – Clint and Tony, most of the time – sparred, after all, both of them were skilled in multiple forms of hand-to-hand combat, and were more than capable of defending themselves. But hitting any of them while there were in their littlespace was something Steve couldn’t even imagine doing without getting goosebumps. Steve would have never accepted to train with Clint if there had been the slightest chance that he might slip into his little headspace while they fought.
“Tony… Tony… hey, wake up.” Tony came to reality slowly as he felt a hand on his shoulder, shaking it carefully.
When Clint had heard the sound that the vent cover of the kitchen did when Phil removed it, he had jumped down from the vent, surely trying to run away from him. But Phil was already waiting for him down there, and even if Clint had run to avoid being caught, he had been so astonished for having been tricked that Phil had had no problems catching him.
“S’rry,” Tony muttered, the word muffled by his knees.
“Clint? What are you doing? Come back now!” Steve ordered. For someone who had gone just to retrieve a few nuggets that were already served, he had taken too much time. “Clint? Clint?!... Seriously Clint, if you are trying to flood the kitchen again I’m not going to talk your daddy out of grounding you,” he assured, easily standing with Tony’s weight in his arms.
“Look, the only thing I want you to tell me is if you want me to stop,” Steve interrupted, saving Tony from having to speak up his mind, something Steve knew he certainly didn’t enjoy.
“Coming to bed two days in a row? Something very bad must’ve happened,” Steve pointed out when Tony entered their room. “You either burned your brain due to overuse and an unhealthy lifestyle, or you burned down your workshop during one of your experiments. And because you forbade Dummy using any extinguishers, he couldn’t put out the fire and now you have no place to hide,” Steve speculated.
“Clint, don’t make me go and get you,” Phil warned, making sure his voice was serious enough so Clint didn’t think that was an empty threat.
“I said I’m staying with you,” Steve said with determination. Tony snuggled closer to him, feeling secretly grateful. “And when you wake up, we’re going to talk about why you didn’t want to tell daddy you were feeling little,” he scolded, though there was no heat in his voice. Tony furrowed his brow in confusion.
What would happen if he screwed up this time too? What if Tony never achieved to be as worthy as a kid as Steve was as a daddy? Would Steve get disappointed too? What if someday he slipped into his little headspace while being in a bad mood? Steve would certainly not want to deal with a cranky and bratty kid, would he? Tony needed to find a way to control this, because losing daddy when he could have avoided it was not an option.
“No!” Clint refused from the floor where he was lying on face down. “You lied! You promised me chocolate chips cookies!”
Steve proceeded to remove Clint's diaper, or that was what the sound of the tabs being unfasten informed Tony, because he wasn’t really looking. Steve had spread his changing mat on the floor next to the sofa where he was currently seated on, but his eyes were fixed on the TV. If he couldn’t stop hiding behind a pillow when he was being diapered, looking someone else during the same process was kind of weird. Besides, Tony didn’t want to exchange glances with Steve. He was mad at him for pushing him away even if Tony had made clear with his whines that he didn’t want to be detached from him.
Tony curled into a small ball, hoping that position relented the waves of pain his bladder was sending through his stomach. He was bursting to go to the bathroom, and after holding it for almost an hour, his full bladder was demanding for immediate release, but Tony refused to do it.
“Tony!” Steve scolded when he saw that the thing that had hit him had been the sippy cup. “Why did you hurl that at me?”
Phil sighed before proceeding with a concern tone of voice, “look, I didn’t want to bother you with this, but I don’t really have an option. Clint’s feeling Little and a bit upset. I’ve been talking to him and I managed to calm him down enough for him to take a nap, but I’m afraid he’s going to continue feeling Little when he wakes up and I’m going on a mission now, so he won’t be able to reach me.”
“Then why you never do the things I ask you to do right away? Why do you fight this so much? You just get moodier and start doing things that are not good for yourself. I just don’t get it, I’ve told you I’m perfectly fine with this, why don’t you believe me? Huh?”
“It doesn’t look like it,” Tony accused, his pout deepening. “Looks like that book’s more interesting than me.”
So, the fact that Tony was so openly eager to know every little thing Steve did all of a sudden did take Steve aback, especially because of the look in Tony’s eyes. Whenever Tony questioned him about his activities, there was certain embarrassment, insecurity, nervousness as well as longing. But, why?
"No, I want a bigger slice," Clint repeated, folding his arms stubbornly over his chest.
"No. That was what Howard made you believe, but he was wrong. I already told you, there's nothing wrong with this. And I do want to help you,” Steve urged, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder and squishing it as a sign of support, he didn’t like seeing Tony having this mental war.
“Tony, I read the instructions on the package, but I’m not quite sure I got them right, and if you keep moving I won’t be able to diaper you, so please, stop this already,” Steve said without being able to disguise the frustration in his voice. He tried to turn Tony around, who had fallen on his stomach when he was dragged.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” Steve said, leaning over to kiss Tony on the brow before lower him back a bit until Tony was almost completely supported by Steve’s arm against his back. “You’ve been so good, daddy’s proud of having such a good boy,” he praised. The burning in Tony’s face was back in full force, though Tony doubted his face had had any shade but red during the entire evening.
Without losing any time, Phil’s mind began to think about the places Clint liked to use as hideouts, though he got distracted by a sudden noise which echoed down the hallway. The noise was so familiar, and yet, Phil’s brain didn’t seem to be able to identify it. It sounded like…
But then the fourth time happened, and Tony was right where he had started. There had been no nightmares, no battles, no Expos, nothing that could be considered stressful. Tony had been chilling out in their living room, drinking some coffee and catching up with the world through his tablet, delighted by the fact that he had a free afternoon – no deadlines to meet, no meetings to attend, no recovery from sleep deprivation to do, not even maintenance of his suit. He had literally nothing to do, something that happened once every leap year. And all of a sudden, Tony had felt how he began to sink into his littlespace.
A much bigger surprise when Tony had allowed him to be in charge of everything taking into consideration his intolerance of uncertainty. And Steve was totally taken aback when Tony played along with everything Steve suggested.
“JARVIS,” Tony called, his voice sounding way too hoarse. Tony took a hand to his throat and winced when swallow saliva. It hurt.
Eventually, Steve planned on turning the room into a nursery, the website where he had bought the changing table from also sold cribs and highchairs, but he thought it was still too soon for that. Tony hadn’t been that thrilled when he saw how Steve had redecorated the room, so Steve figured it was better to wait a little more.
Even if he could have easily disposed of the crib, the high chair, and plenty of toys and books that Clint didn’t use because they were meant for babies and he wasn’t one, Steve just couldn’t bring himself to do it. Tony had never gotten around to make use of many of those things, but they were his anyway, and Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that getting rid of that stuff was as if he were saying goodbye to his baby. He’d accepted and respected Tony’s decision, though he wasn’t sure if he was ready to accept there was a high possibility he wouldn’t have the opportunity to interact with his baby anymore.
“I wanna read Ender’s game.”
“I don’t know.” Tony whispered, his eyes looking at everything but his father. Even that monstrous antique Howard used as a desk seemed more worthy of captivating capturing his sight attention at that moment.
His eyes snapped open and his breathing stopped. This wasn’t his bed. This wasn’t any bed. This was the crib he had built no long ago. How the hell did he end up here? Nobody new about this room, about his nursery, the door was hidden somewhere in his closet. And even if somebody find it, JARVIS was the only one who could unlock it, and nobody but Tony was allowed to get inside. Oh, he was so going to disable the A.I.
A bit hesitantly, Steve turned around after staring at Tony for a few more seconds. He was going. Steve was going and leaving him alone. It shouldn’t matter, in two hours he would be back and then Tony might dare to ask him to play daddy for a while. Two hours wasn’t a long time, Tony could certainly wait.
The rest of the afternoon was uneventful. Tony seemed perfectly fine with doing nothing but relax and Steve couldn’t really say he disliked the idea. He’d planned numerous activities to keep his baby entertained and spend some quality time they both needed and deserved after all the ups and downs they’d been through – things that went from coloring to making some pretty cool craft projects which JARVIS had helped him to find on the Internet – but his baby hadn’t been so thrilled when faced with those proposals, and snuggling on his lap as they watched a movie in the living room ended up being what he preferred to do.
“Look, maybe I went too far a couple of minutes ago, but I don’t give a shit about that, I mean, I’ve never heard anything about age playing, and I do think is kind of odd, but it’s far from the worse thing I know people like to do,” Tony confessed, turning around to see him.
One corner of Steve’s mouth twitched slightly.  “Yes, Tony, you are. You don’t make decisions out of nowhere. I know you, and you’re not as impulsive as you claim you are. Your decisions, no matter how reckless they seem, are very premeditated. Even when you go against my orders in the battlefield, I know you’ve already calculated and foreseen every possible outcome.”
“N’t d’ddy.”
Tony couldn't help rolling his eyes. Steve was always doing research, he took it very seriously when someone recommended him to see or listen to something that would help him catch up with the twentieth century. If his memory served him right, Tony could even swear Steve had needed another notepad to write down every recommendation.
“What?” Steve asked, taken a little aback by how random that comment had been.
"And you are, just let me clean your face, your daddy’s going to find out you drank a smoothie if I don't and he's gonna be mad," Steve reasoned.
As much as he tried to get all the air he needed, he couldn’t. A panic attack, he thought he was having a panic attack. Again. His hands started to shake a little, his body felt cold and his chest tightened too.
“But Phil–”
A shame Tony hadn’t really realized how oblivious Steve could be.
“I didn’t lie, I told you I’d give you some cookies once you finished eating your lunch,” Phil pointed out, sounding falsely calm. “And I maintain it, no cookies until I see that plate completely empty.”
What exactly did Steve have in mind? What would he do after Tony told him he wanted to play? He’d said he wanted to know what Tony liked and didn’t like, but how would that happen? Would Steve ask Tony to sit down and plainly tell him everything? Would Tony have to admit to Steve he’d come to like pretty much every babyish activity they’d tried? Did Steve want Tony to start asking for everything and not only for a play date? Would Tony have to request diaper changes and all the other stuff?
Phil and Clint were still there, Clint perched on Steve’s lap, face hidden in the crook of Steve’s neck and arms around his waist. By Steve’s expression – a smile filled with warmth that crinkled the skin around his eyes – Tony could tell the archer was Little, and he didn’t like that in the slightest.
“Looks like someone needs a nap,” Steve suggested as he smiled fondly at Tony.
“No one wanted to give green-light to your departure.” Phil informed. Steve had already figured that had been the problem. Nobody in their right mind would allow someone who had suffered several concussions, had a dislocated elbow, two broken ribs as well as various cuts and scrapes all over his body leave only a few hours after being admitted. Steve reckoned Phil had had to scared the hell out of some people in order to be able to get him discharged, and Phil would probably have to deal with a furious Fury once he realized Steve had left before he was supposed to.
For a couple of days, Tony avoided Steve, turning to his favorite way of escape: hiding in his workshop and claiming he had too much work to do. Steve let him be, but this morning he had cornered Tony when he had gone upstairs to get some coffee, and Tony was unable to make a getaway – not for the lack of trying, of course.
Saw any mistakes? Please let me know :)
Just kidding.
"Hey, no, no. You're not falling asleep in the shower," Phil warned, shaking him gently but firmly. Clint just grunted miserably. "No, come on. We already made Tony wait too much."
By the time the pizza was ready to be baked, Tony was a complete disaster. His face, arms, legs and onesie were stained with flour and tomato sauce; and his hair was scattered with some of the toppings that never made it to the pizza. Needless to say Steve couldn’t have cared less, besides the fact that he was thrilled to see his baby having such a good time after how tensed and anxious he’d been when at the beginning of their playdate, the mess provided the perfect opportunity to continue getting information on the sly.
Of course, Tony wouldn’t have been that absent-minded during the battle if Steve hadn’t told him they needed to talk right before taking off and heading for Central Park. Who in his right mind would say such a thing minutes before having to fight with a freaking oversized lizard? Tony couldn’t help paying more attention to the little voice inside his head, which was trying to figure out what on earth Steve had meant by that, than to Steve’s orders.
Clint hesitated a little before standing up and walking towards them, dragging his feet as a way to show how much he disliked being made to do something he didn’t want to. Once he was next to Phil, he flopped down on the floor grumpily and leaned forward as much as he could, surely trying to get as close as possible to the TV without disobeying Phil. Testing boundaries. Phil rolled his eyes, not liking the challenging behavior, but turned the TV on anyway.
Not many hours ago, Tony had been relieved Steve was miles away from home on a mission, fighting back the urge to be Little was exceptionally tough if the man was around, as Tony just wanted to throw himself into Steve’s arms every time they ran into each other, to hell with his decision of putting a stop to all this. If he had allowed JARVIS to talk him into going to bed, it had been only because of Steve’s absence; otherwise, Tony would have stayed right where he had been and ignored that recent and annoying habit of his A.I. of telling him what to do whenever he realized Tony wasn’t in the correct mindset. Sleeping in the same bed with Steve when feeling Little was a resounding no, what if he sucked his thumb in his sleep? Or called Steve ‘daddy’ while still being drowsy? Or Steve’s presence sent him deeper into his Little headspace and Tony did something dreadfully embarrassing like forgetting he wasn’t wearing a diaper and wet the bed? Steve would be all over him again and Tony didn’t know if he could deal with that and emerge victorious once more.
“Daddy!” The words came out before Tony could stop them. He felt a sob finally managing to escape from his throat and his mortification increased greatly once his sight turned blurry. Was he really going to cry?
“Tony, stay still please, this is already hard enough as it is,” Steve scolded, trying to keep him still with one hand and unfold the diaper with the other one.
“I believe you also call it nursery, Captain.”
"It's not the first time we shared a bath," Steve interrupted.
Phil raised a confused eyebrow. “Is that it? You don’t want me to diaper you because I’m not your daddy?” he inquired. Tony didn’t answer, though he didn’t need to, the burning on his face did it for him. “Okay, okay, it’s okay,” he said more to himself than for Tony, “I tell you what, why don’t you wear a pull-up? You can put it on, and you can take if off whenever you feel like going to the bathroom,” he proposed, and he was relief when Tony didn’t seem to dislike the idea.
Indeed, Tony hated not being able to completely understand why Steve seemed to be OK with the whole situation.
“I know you do, but your daddy’s busy right now, he can’t come. And you can’t stay there until he arrives,” Phil hurried to clarify, knowing perfectly well that thought had crossed Tony’s mind. “You need to come out here.” Tony shook his head. “Yes, you have to change out of those clothes.” Tony refused once more. “Tony, your daddy wouldn’t want you to stay there, he would be really sad if he comes back and finds out you preferred to stay here instead of letting me help you.”
Steve and he were OK now. It had been weeks since their fight and reconciliation, and everything was just going smooth. Some harmless arguments from time to time – Tony had been too reckless during battle, Steve insisted on senseless bonding activities, Tony wanted to skip a checkup, Steve denying Tony coffee until he ingested something more nutritious – but nothing out of the ordinary. Steve had worked hard on making up to him, and Tony had appreciated it.
That thought made Steve feel awfully uneasy. Tony had claimed he wanted to have nothing to do with Age Play anymore and Steve had chosen to respect his decision after seeing how determined Tony was. But what if Tony wasn’t? What if Tony didn’t really want to quit age playing? What if Tony had been struggling with that and Steve hadn’t noticed because he’d stayed away in order to give him some space? What if Steve had been neglecting his baby?
It went without saying that that had been one of the things that had upset Tony and had made him realize there was something off in Steve’s behavior. Who would have thought it would also be one of the things he would later want Steve to keep doing.
Clint might have said that the whole age play thing was something between him and Phil, and there was no doubt he had meant that, because neither he nor Phil – nor Steve – had brought up the topic again. Good, Steve did not want any other metal picture to stick in his mind and keep company with the one he was already having problems to get rid of. But now that Steve had found out about it, he had a hunch that the this-is-just-between-us thing wasn’t going to last long.
Thus, getting Bruce to Hulk out was unthinkable. Never would Tony think about it again.
Yes, those little things certainly helped, but they made everything worse at the same time, too. First of all, how could Tony expect to leave everything related to Age Play behind if he continued allowing himself to do such childish things? And second, however comforting all that was, it always left a nasty taste in Tony’s mouth, because doing something infantile only made daddy’s absence more obvious.
Tony mumbled something back that Steve didn’t quite understand, and made a bee line to the kitchen.
“Not sleepy.” It was Tony’s only answer, which Steve interpreted as an affirmation.
What Tony wasn’t counting on was how deep and fast he would fall into his littlespace once he saw Steve. With little Clint. When he opened the door of his bathroom – where JARVIS had informed him Steve was – and saw Steve bathing Clint as the latter played with
“You see, I’d be a good daddy, I got my child to do as he’s being asked,” he pointed out, earning a playful punch from Tony, clearly failing to see the true meaning behind Steve’s words.
Steve was sure he would have to put up with a moody Tony the following day, anger – as well as avoidance – was a common side effect when he pushed Tony into some Little quality time. No matter how much Steve had tried to make him comfortable, Tony still got pretty embarrassed when his adult headspace took over again. Eventually, Steve knew, Tony would come to terms with his Little side, but until that happened, Steve was more than willing to be there for him.
Tony’s fingers fidgeted nervously. “Yes,” he answered in a tiny voice.
Phil seemed completely oblivious of the fact that Steve’s confused expression wasn’t caused by Phil not wanting him to make any noise, but by Clint himself. Or rather, by what Clint was wearing. A t-shirt and what was undoubtedly a diaper. Why on earth was Clint wearing a diaper?
Okay, he was definitely not expecting that.
“Oh, yeah, right, what I mean was, why are you eating that?” Tony asked.
Steve’s heart melted when that shy smile appeared one more time on Tony’s face. It showed him how Tony was enjoying this even if he was still struggling with the idea whether this was something he was supposed to enjoy or not.
“I don’t think that’s going to be a good idea. I mean, I’m sure Tony’s done his own research about it, there’s nothing more I could say about the topic,” Steve said, reaching for a cushions just to have something to do with his hands, “and suggesting to give it a try? I guess I already blew that chance.”
After some more kicks and punches, Steve placed Tony in front of him for the fifth time already, a little bit closer now, causing Tony’s legs to end up dangling beside the bed. Without hesitation, Steve simultaneously undid the jean’s button and unzipped its fly, pulling both the jeans and the boxers down. Nudity wasn’t really an issue here, besides the fact that they had shared showers in SHIELD several times after a battle and decontamination, Tony wasn’t exactly known for his modesty – someone who had several photos in his birthday suit out on the Internet couldn’t be modest, not really. Therefore, the blush on Tony’s cheeks were caused by the whole situation itself and not his nudity.
Tony could accept that – dealing with feelings had never been his forte – but what he couldn't accept was the reason why he had felt so bad, why he had had the need to cry as pitifully as he had cried. That reason was what he had disliked the most of the whole experience. That reason had made him feel incredibly stupid and ashamed. That reason was what had made him feel terrified. And it didn’t matter how much Tony mulled over it, he just couldn’t accept it as a valid cause.
The bad thing was that Steve was an extremely determined individual, and if he decided to do something, not even Ton’s power of persuasion could make him change his mind, at least not without a valid reason.
“I don’t want to do this anymore,” Tony blurted.
“No, you didn’t answer, you just avoid the topic as you usually do.”
___________
Hey! How you doing?
“Stop doing that, they’re gonna think this is a prank call!” Steve whisper yelled at Clint, a hand over the transmitter of the phone handset to avoid the guy on the other side of the line to listen to Clint’s unusual requests.
“Playing?” Tony echoed. Did Steve considered what they had done as playing? How come? They only reason they had grabbed the toys had been to take them upstairs and put them away, they hadn’t played with them at all.
Besides, what was the worst thing that could happened? That Steve ran into Clint and Phil while they were making out on the couch? That wasn’t a big deal, especially since both of them had caught him and Tony doing the same thing several times.
“I think you do, so please tell me.” Steve pursed his lips when Tony shook his head. “Are you still jealous of him?” he inquired. Tony drew up his free leg as he nodded shyly. “But why?” Another shrug. Steve heaved a faint sigh. “Tony,” he said in a warning tone of voice.
Squirming a little, Tony peeked over his knees at him, eyes sweeping up and down his body. Steve’s mouth thinned, the gesture being enough for him to understand what was in Tony’s mind. It was no surprise that his suspicions proved to be true. With slight difficulty, Steve stretched his arm, grabbed the top of the crib rail and pulled himself up to sitting position, his body resenting the effort.
"Look at me," Steve ordered gently, hands holding Tony's wrists. "C'mon Tony, look at me," he repeated. Tony hesitated a bit before turning his eyes up, his head still down. "There's nothing wrong with not knowing what you want, OK? I asked you just in case you have something in particular in mind, but it's OK if you don't," Tony said nothing, "we can figure out together what suit us better, don't you think?" Steve questioned, and gave Tony a slight squeeze with his legs to let him know he wanted an answer. Tony nodded. "So, please take it easy, this is supposed to be relaxing, you shouldn’t stress out," Tony nodded one more time. "Can I hug you?" Steve asked, though Tony found himself being pulled into a hug before he could reply, half-sitting on Steve’s lap.
If there was ever a complaint about all this, Steve could definitely blame it on Tony. Because if Tony had agreed to spar with him when he asked, instead of staying in his workshop working on some upgrades he could have easily left for later, Steve would have never gone to Clint’s floor, looking for somebody to train with.
turn of saying what’s in your mind. You’re a pain whenever I don’t want to talk about something, but now that you were the one who should’ve talked, you go and do this?” he reproached, “Why didn’t you come and tell me what you wanted? Why did you prefer to be all sneaky about it?” he asked, voice serene, but pissed.
Tony furrowed his brow in confusion. Chasing after each other, tickling and finding ways to lock the other one out of the workshop couldn’t be counted as playing, could it?
Tony stepped out onto his – their – floor. He could do this, he totally could. He’d go to Steve, tell him he wanted to have a play date, and then, he’d would tell Steve whatever it was he wanted to know. That would be it. Soon this ridiculous situation would be over, and things would be as they were before.
“You see, I told you that you were going to spill it,” Steve said, maybe a bit harsher than he had intended, because even if Clint looked upset when he realized the spilled water had reached his lap, his eyes welled up until Steve uttered that scolding.
Hastily, Tony uncovered himself, setting aside the blanket carelessly, staring at it with disdain. Then, he almost had a heart attack when he looked down and got a glimpse of himself: he was wearing a onesie and, of course, a diaper. Steve hadn’t even tried to cover up the fact he had been the one who dressed Tony like that, since the chosen onesie had been the blue one with the shield of Captain America printed in front of the cloth. Of course Tony had been the one who bought it in the first place – in his defense, he had bought one themed onesie of each of The Avengers, not just one of Captain America – but he had never worn it.
“Would you let me be in charge? I’ll plan a play day and we’ll do different things,” Steve suggested, “we can have a safeword so that we can stop if you’re not comfortable with something,” Steve hurried to say when Tony’s mouth tugged into a faint frown.
"Of course you can, kiddo," Steve agreed, chuckling when Clint shook his hand anxiously so Steve let go of it and ran into the room, straight to the toy chests.
With hesitant movements, Tony placed a hand on the door knob and twisted it open very slowly, still a bit reluctant to go inside. As expected, Steve was sitting on the bed, and Tony felt his heart beating with a mixture of apprehension and indignation, experiencing a sudden worsening in mood. It would have been a normal reaction – seeing Steve’s heavily bandaged upper body, scratched face and arm immobilized in a splint could certainly throw anyone who knew him off balance – but that hadn’t been what had upset Tony.
Half way through the movie, his eyelids began to feel very heavy; all the tiredness, stress and worries of the last month overpowering him. By then, Tony has pretty much given up his pursuit of finding a way to escape. Now the only thing that he was focusing on was trying not to fall asleep right there. Besides the fact he didn’t want to wake up with ink on his face – damn Clint – the mere fact of imagining Steve carrying him out of the room like a damsel in distress made him shudder. Or even worse, what if Steve scooped him up? – Tony doubted Steve would do such a thing when being in the same room with the others, but Tony couldn’t really help his paranoia sometimes.
“Jeez, I don’t think he’ll be mad because you found out, but I think he would’ve preferred to tell you himself in that case. So, perhaps you might want to say nothing about it?” Phil proposed.
?" he insisted.
That mental image of him chasing Tony while he giggled uncontrollably still looked agonizingly far. Nonetheless, having his baby melted into his embrace while he rocked him back and forth to make him fall asleep helped Steve realize that, even if it took Tony a long time to arrive to the stage Steve wanted him to be, he would undoubtedly enjoy the process.
And why were they piling up the boxes? Well, they were just not going to throw them away. Steve was a recycling freak. He recycled
Why did he have to feel this anxious? It wasn’t unusual for him to wake up and find the other side of the bed empty. Steve’s and his schedule hardly ever matched, Steve was a morning person and preferred to go to bed early, and Tony, on the contrary, liked to work well into the night and sleep during all morning – if he ever went to bed. Therefore, Tony should be used to it.
Nevertheless, Tony lived in a universe where everything he planned seemed to be impossible to achieved, and instead of getting the scene he had visualized, he ended up with a plate filled with that damn salad, and an upset Steve. Tony was not going to finish what he had just been served, and Steve felt strongly about wasting food.
But, most of all, what made Steve sure of that change in Tony was the way he looked at him. Affection and admiration aside, there was something in his eyes that was different and was only there when Tony was little, something that Steve had previously seen in Clint’s – and that had helped to convince Steve Age Play could be something real - a certain curiosity, a certain innocence. Those big brown eyes twinkled in a way Steve have only see in children.
“I don’t know.” His voice never sounded as thin as it always did when he was talking to his father, and he hated that.
"It's not what you think," Steve interrupted again.
Tony had no doubt that this was what he wanted, though it was way much easier and less embarrassing to let Steve be the one in charge of everything related to their age play. If his brain suddenly began condemning him for sucking on a pacifier or wearing a diaper, he could still appease his conscience by arguing Steve had been the responsible for those things. That would no longer be possible. Tony had to accept that whatever childish action he found himself doing – and enjoying – would be the result of his own decision.
“Yes.”
- - - -
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve,” Tony couldn’t help calling for him again, his voice sounding tiny even if he tried to speak louder. Still not answer.
“Tomorrow, sir.”
“Yes you are!” Steve said, as he hurried to grab him by the arm before Tony could lock himself in the bathroom. It was obvious that doors wouldn’t stop him from retrieving Tony, but destroying things unnecessarily wasn’t something he liked to do.
If you spotted any mistakes, please, let me know :)
That only meant this was Steve’s fault. He was supposed to be looking after Clint, not nodding off.
"So, what? Is that something that turns you on? Do you want me to get down on my hands and knees and call you Daddy? Do you want to humiliate me by making me wear and use diapers? Do you want me to be naughty so you can you spank me? Is that a thing for you?" Tony demanded, and Steve couldn’t help wincing at how wrong that sounded.
“You and I both need to work on our communication skills,” Steve informed after several seconds, “it’s more than obvious that we still are terrible at communicating.” Tony couldn’t refute that. Both of them had complicated everything unnecessarily. Had they talked about what they wanted since the beginning, things might have gone smoother. “I really have to go and see how Clint’s doing, if he’s alone too much time, he’s going to hide in the vents and he’s going to get scared because they’re too dark and will refuse to move until either Phil or me go and get him,” Steve said. Tony would have found the scene of Phil and Steve trying to coax Clint to go out of the vents funny if he hadn’t been to mortified because of Steve’s departure.
“Steve,” Tony called, blinking several times to get rid of his blurry vision.
Tony didn’t like to share anything with Clint, not even Steve’s attention, as he did everything in his power to keep it all for himself. Clint would get a bit annoyed by that, and even if there were sometimes that he would let it pass thanks to the fact that he got easily distracted, Steve was afraid there would be a time when Tony’s uncharacteristic behavior would cause a fight between them. Needless to say he did not want that to happen. In his mind, Steve had always imagined them being playmates, he wanted them to be, and that would never happen if Tony kept acting the way he had.
“Hey, normal human being here, not a super soldier,” Tony said, his voice choked, and even if Steve was clearly hugging him too tightly, Tony didn’t try to struggle free.
“I’m sorry to interrupt you Agent, but your presence is needed in Sir’s and Captain Roger’s room,” JARVIS informed.
Jeez, I didn't plan on taking this long to update, I'm sorry. But with holidays and eveything, I just couldn't get around to writing. And I guess I wasn't feeling like doing it either, I don't know why.
Sitting down fast, he took out his thumb and cleaned the dried drool that was on the corner of his mouth. Damn it! Why was this happening again?
Clint beamed. “Thank you!”
“I’m not, your daddy must have forgotten to restock them,” Steve lied, feeling awful for doing so. “Come on kiddo, just this time, I promise I’ll take it off if you want to go to the bathroom, just let me know.”
“Relax, I told you we’re already here,” Steve repeated.
“I… I don’t... don’t know.” He couldn’t have chosen a worse time to stutter.
“What?!” Steve exclaimed, startled.
“We could do something right now,” Tony suggested, his voice clearly insinuating what he had in mind.
After that afternoon he had come to realize he could achieve such mindset, Tony had fallen into it just three more times. One after a fairly awful battle, in which Steve had scared the hell out of everybody as he had pretended to die to surprise the enemy. Another after the annual Stark Expo, which Tony always enjoyed but utterly exhausted him. If Tony also took into account what he considered to be have been the first time, everything seemed to indicate that what sent him into his little headspace was stress, experiencing strong and staggering emotions.
That didn’t mean Tony had gotten angry at Steve, not at all. Steve hadn’t done anything wrong. If he had known that Tony had slipped into his Little headspace, he would have done everything in his power to get out of the mission and go back to the Tower, though he hadn’t.
Steve massaged his temple as an attempt to ease the headache he could feel coming. Clint had been doing that all afternoon, and Steve was afraid it was all his fault. Had he known promising no babyish stuff would be misinterpreted as no childish stuff in general, Steve would have never said such thing. But Clint had been reluctant to come along just as Phil had warned him, and Steve had had no other choice.
Regardless of whether Steve’s gut was right or not, when it told him Tony had made that decision not because he was sure he wasn’t going to like it at all, but because of the way Steve had handled things.
"Nothing, really."
“There’s an animated movie I want to see, JARVIS showed me the teaser and it does look fun, I can’t believe you haven’t watched it considering its about robots,” Steve commented, as he pushed him gently at his shoulders, encouraging to lay down. Tony refused.
“So? Do you want to try being a toddler?” Steve questioned. Tony’s face acquired a stronger shade of red before he shook his head. “I’d like a verbal answer, baby.”
Steve smiled at his enthusiasm, even so, he couldn’t help wondering if it was due to real hunger or relief for moving on to something less stressful for him. “But first, I need you to do something else for Daddy”, he continued. His baby’s face dropped. Steve guessed that cleared his doubt. “I know, baby, I know. But I still don’t know all the things you enjoy.”
After some more minutes of being frozen there, the armor bearer gave up and sat down on the floor next to the door, arms crossed in front on his chest. He hated how shaky he was feeling, he hated how Steve’s tone of voice could almost make him feel like a grounded child. He was starting to get into that headspace which he loaded so much, and exhaustion wasn’t helping at all.
Steve smiled satisfyingly once more before turning on his heels and walking towards the door, his mind already thinking about what the best way to take Tony to the room would be, without being too suspicious.
I leave?” Steve asked, his voice still expressing how bewildered he was, and the fact that Tony just nodded didn’t help at all. “Okay Tony, I do need some clarification, because you totally lost me here,” he said as he pushed the baby slightly away from him so he could look at him. Tony resisted a little, and he whined when he saw he no longer could hide his face against Steve’s chest. “No, sweety, I need to know why you said
“Maybe I should be a bit bigger,” Tony suggested, voiced muffled. Steve was afraid he said that. He didn’t want Tony to be a toddler like Clint, he wanted Tony to be a baby. If Tony had shown any sign of not liking being a baby, Steve would undoubtedly replan things; but Tony seemed to enjoy it, so Steve didn’t see any valid reason to change that. However, if Tony did want to be a bit older, Steve wouldn’t oppose.
There was no turning back. Tony had accepted and agreed to give Age Play a chance. However, it was one thing to say you would do it, it’s another to actually carry it out.
Certainly, Steve could argue every babyish thing he had done was caused by a valid reason, though he knew there were also some other things that hadn’t exactly happened because the circumstances so required. Lulling Clint to sleep on the rocking chair, giving him a sippy cup as if it was a bottle, and putting him down in the crib were definitely not necessary, and Steve was a little ashamed to recognize they were just the result of nostalgia.
“You should spend that time with me,” Tony complained.
“I didn’t even wanna take a shower,” Clint complained when Phil made him straighten.
“Well, actually that's good to know. I was talking to Phil this morning and he told me he was going to go on a mission that might last a week or so, you know that undercover missions can last more than expected,” Steve commented, playing close attention to Tony's reaction. His features certainly hardened in spite of himself. “The thing is, he asked me to look after Clint while he's away, you know, just in case he’s feeling little, and now that I know you have no problem with that, I’m gonna tell him–"
That was the reason why Tony tended to lock himself in his workshop for days in a row, because an idea that was not carry through could be something frustrating and unbearable. He needed to see those mental pictures making their way into reality. An unnerving feeling of anxiety would pervade his whole being until he had created or done whatever it was the thing that had occurred to him. So, a little sleep and food deprivation was a small price to pay in order for his mind to be peaceful, even if everybody else disagreed.
Twenty-five spanks. That was it. He was never delivered with more than twenty-five. And that was more than enough, Steve might not spank him with all his strength, but he didn’t go light on him either. By the time it finished, tears were falling freely on his face and he was breathing heavily. The captain helped him to stand, pulling his pants up right away and placing him between his legs to prevent him from trying to get away.
“Clint? Did he tell you what he needs?” Steve questioned. If his memory served him correctly, they didn’t have anything planned for the afternoon.
“Tony, look at me, please,” Steve ordered. “Tony,” he said, his tone of voice indicating it was definitely not a good idea to disobey him right now. Tony squirmed a bit more and his eyes darted around for several seconds before finally meeting Steve’s eyes. “
I'm really sorry for making you wait this long. I won't say I'll try to update sooner because I really don't know if I will, but I do promise that I'm gonna try.
“You should go see him,” Natasha advised, “he must be wondering where you are.”
Clint shook his head as he whipped the tears with the back of his hands, but more kept coming. “You’re mad,” he said after a few minutes.
Steve couldn’t make up his mind.
“I know, peanut. Daddy will snuggle with you in bed and read you a story as soon as I make sure Tony’s okay,” Phil promised as he made a beeline to Tony’s and Steve’s bedroom, hastening his steps when his ears perceived the sound of someone sobbing.
“Oh, thanks God!”
"I need to go and check something, don't worry about it, go back to sleep, I'll be right back," Steve promised, and Tony knew he was lying.
“Tony,” Steve warned.
- - - -
Restraining himself from putting Tony down on the changing table to get him ready and put him to bed as soon as possible, Steve walked slowly around the room, bouncing Tony a little with the intention of sending him further into dreamland.
Pancakes for lunch wasn't exactly what Steve considered a proper meal, but after all the drama from an hour ago, Steve didn’t have it in him to deny Clint anything. When Clint told him he wanted pancakes instead of pizza, Steve felt he didn’t have any other choice but to agree. Making pancakes with Tony perched on his hip and Clint by his side all the time making sure he created the shapes he requested had
Afraid he would scare Tony away, Steve refrained himself from opening his eyes or showing any signs of being awake. Was Tony there to stay or had he come here to look for something and he would leave once he found it? Steve hoped it was the former.
“And you won’t ask me to do any chores for the rest of the year,” Clint continued.
“No,” Tony told him as he grabbed the waistband of his jeans, preventing Steve from pulling them down. Steve got a little bit surprised, he really thought Tony was more than asleep.
By the time Clint and Tony were all clean up and apparently calm down, Steve was more than ready to go to bed, the fact that is hadn’t even started to get dark outside not being important. His idea of putting them down for a nap sounded more appealing than ever now. He took a book from the shelves before getting comfortable on the bed, allowed Tony to climb onto his lap and began reading. If that didn’t make them fall sleep, Steve didn’t know what he was going to do. His eyelids felt extremely heavy, and it was a matter of time before he fell asleep himself.
“Would you just shut up?” Steve interrupted him, trying to sound polite but the frustration in his face gave him away. “You know exactly what I want to talk about, stop playing dumb on me.”
“What? What are you talking about?” Steve questioned, eyebrows furrowed in complete confusion.
Phil’s eyes snapped wide open when realization hit him.
Steve wasn’t Clint’s daddy. Clint had his own daddy, and his daddy was perfectly sound and safe. Why hadn’t Phil stepped up and dealt with his Little’s distress? That was his job as a daddy, wasn’t it? Why had Clint had to be usurping Tony’s place? If anyone had to be on Steve’s lap that should’ve been Tony, unquestionably, because Steve was
But one afternoon, Phil had required his assistance once more, and Steve had ended up babysitting Clint until Phil had been able to make it to the Tower. Clint had hidden under the bed for the first hour, not really wanting to be Little when Steve was the only one around, but too deep into his little headspace to try to go back to his adult self. It wasn’t until Steve took out one of his toys – a remote control car – and started to play with it pretending to have a lot of fun, that Clint decided to come out from under the bed.
“No,” Tony said, though he was dying to say the opposite. It was never a good idea to call someone who was on a mission, as that could literally get him or her killed. Besides, chances were that Steve didn’t even have his phone with him. “When did he say he’s coming back?”
“If he ever jokes about it, I’m gonna stop talking to you,” Clint assured, folding his arms over his chest and kicking him one more time.
“Oh, this is bullshit and I’m going to prove it to you,” Tony said to his brain once more, climbing into the crib peevishly.
It must have been one of those days when Clint hadn't been able to help slipping into his little headspace and Phil hadn't been around. He tended to look for Steve, as being little while he was by himself was not a good idea. Besides, Steve turned out to be a good babysitter.
When Steve was finally able to soothe Clint enough to stop calling for his daddy, Clint refused to be changed on the changing table. Steve had to go and retrieve the changing mat to avoid Clint getting more upset than he already was, and convincing him to wear another diaper wasn’t easy either. Steve had to promise to give him a complete box of cookies, and not put back on the overalls – Steve couldn’t refute that, if Clint hadn’t been wearing them, he might have been able to make it to the bathroom.
No matter how much Phil called Tony, for the next several minutes the only thing Phil could hear were Tony’s sobs as well the quiet pleas for his daddy to come. Phil may well have gone inside the closet and tried to comfort him, but he thought it would be better to give Tony some space and time so the idea that he would have to spend the rest of the day with him and Clint sank in. Perhaps that was also one of the reasons why Tony was crying.
“Yeah,” Steve drawls. “I think-“
Eventually, the girl meets a man who works with her father. He comes around often enough that she calls him Uncle. Uncle is nice, calms the father down some when he’s angry, but his hand on her shoulder is just a little too tight to be comfortable, his eyes just a hair too sharp to be caring. The butler doesn’t like him, but the young girl looks up to him. ‘You are amazing,’ the Uncle says to her. ‘Smarter than your father, prettier than your mother. You will go places.’ “ Toni gulped down some more coffee.
”That’s the killing curse,” Strange said rolling his eyes. “You just killed your hair clip.” Regardless, he placed it on the counter and slid it forward. Toni shot him a grateful look and picked up the spider web shaped golden hair clip. She reached up and put it in her hair.
”Yeah,” Sam raised his hand. “What do you mean you’re leader of the Avengers? Steve’s our leader.”
”Probably already corrupted by her, then” Clint grumbled.
getting back into his outline. They try to talk to him some more, and he hums and haws and agrees until he finally just says, “Look, go ask Steve.”
”Stop, we don’t need to make a scene,” she murmured quietly, but Steve’s enhanced hearing picked it up. “You can kick their asses later during training.”
Strange himself flicked his hands at the young girl and golden whips shot out. They wrapped around her wrists and ate away at the magic pouring from them.
‘Yes, you must. But not yet. Come, let us walk.’ She holds out her skeleton hand and the young girl takes it without a moments hesitation. She’s seen and touched bones before, most of them her own, and they don’t frighten her. Lady Death leads her to a dark river and they stroll slowly along the banks. ‘What is the matter, darling?’ The older asks the younger.
He’s in the common room, designing on a tablet and tuning out everything around him. That is, until an insistent hand keeps tapping him on the shoulder.
”The web shaped one?” Strange asked.
The glowing ropes tightened in warning before disintegrating. Toni whistled, and Strange’s flying red blanket returned to its master’s side. It gave Spider-Man a high five.
“I don’t remember this,” Tony states, but it comes out as more of a question towards the end when he catches Thor’s imploring frown.
And she lets him finish, let’s him get out all of his anger, and picks herself up and leaves when he tells her to. She falls into the arms of the butler that is more of a father to her than her biological one is, and dies.”
”She dies,”Toni shrugged.
Strange’s cape flew off his shoulder and wrapped itself around Wanda, successfully limiting her movement.
”Of course we didn’t.” Clint rolled his eyes. “We’ve been pardoned. What more is there to know?”
Vision was at the Colonel’s shoulder wearing a sweater vest and slacks. Wanda brightened at Steve’s side when she saw him.
”Of course,” Steve said kindly. “We’ve been needing to talk anyway. Go ahead.”
He quickly scanned the small assembly before him. There was a tall blond woman, military judging by her stance, on the very left. Her pressed business skirt and suit combo along with the stern set to her mouth had Steve straightening his back involuntarily. She began to remind him of Peggy, so he quickly moved on.
The young man tells her his name, and sticks out his hand. Angel clasps her palm to his and answers with her fake name, the one her
gave to her. And the man smiles back.”

”Toni,” Steve said as the genius reached for the mugs.
"Yes," Clint tells her with a drawn out whine. He turns to Bruce, who is at the stove making tea. "Why can’t they just get along?"
”I suppose so,” Strange sighed. He opened another portal, this time showing an empty boardroom on the other side. Toni strutted over to him and they exchanged a brief kiss.
“Here’s what’s going to happen,” Steve starts lowly, and despite him not raising his voice, it cuts through the argument like a hot knife through butter. “Tony’s right, you do need to learn to clean up after yourselves. Starting right now, you three are on gym duty. There are weights that need to be put back, mats that need to be spray-cleaned, and machines to wipe down. I’m sure you can find something to clean. When you’re done you can go around the tower and pick up your stuff. Does that seem fair?”
“Okay,” Tony consents breathily, launching himself over the doors and into the car.
“Your aunt called, she said you had trouble at school,” Tony tells him, fingers fluttering over Peter’s arms to make sure nowhere else is injured.
”What, why?” Steve cried.
He claims that the weapons Angel’s Uncle stole from her killed his parents and brother and he wants revenge on her. Let me ask you this Captain. When someone you love is shot by a gun, should you go after the man who shot it, or the man who made it?”
Tony crosses his legs and there’s a fair moment of silence before he answers without looking up. “What?”
Steve was pretty sure he could see Rhodes and goatee man trading bets behind her back, but he didn’t know what they were for.
“You said to ask Steve,” Clint shrugs. “So we did and he gave us Elmers.”
Angel forgives him because she understands what happens when hands are tied, when messages are dyed black, and the darkness one being can possess spills over.
“Oh yes,” Bruce says, nodding at the reporter. They are currently at a panel style press conference for the latest battle, which as usual has devolved into a gossip fest. Tony’s not really paying attention, content to mess with his phone on the table.
Immediately Thor and Clint try to pin the blame on the other, while Tasha just raises her hands and says, “Wasn’t me.”
“Spider,” she says with a shrug.
“Also Steve is such a dad,” Clint pipes up. “I mean, America, baseball, the army, and the whole ‘I’m disappointed in you spiel’, how much more dad like can you get?”
Steve’s heart stopped.
”Yes!” Toni clapped her hands. “Accio clippy thingy! Avada Kedavra!”
The sky was just showing hints of light at the table in the Compound’s kitchen, sharing a companionable silence with his best pal. Steve had no idea what Bucky was thinking about, but Steve himself was pondering over the last few months.
Both Clint and Thor start to fidget under the ‘Captain America is disappointed in you’ glare. Even Natasha, usually unflappable, looks a little uneasy.
”Toni,” Steve admonished.
With that, they rush off and Tony sighs in relaxation at the quiet. That is, until he’s pulled out of it later by the smell of something burning and the sound of Thor yelling and Clint screeching. He vaults off the couch into the kitchen to witness the refrigerator, microwave, and sink on fire. Thor’s running around like a chicken with his head cut off, Clint’s cursing while trying to bat the flames of the microwave away, and Natasha’s trying to put pot lids over the burning stove. Bruce snatches a fire extinguisher off of the wall and sprays down the whole mess with white foam, coating everything including the people.
‘Hello, young one,’ the lady says. ‘Do you know where you are?’
”Your rooms are exactly as you left them, east wing is off limits,” Toni said, the speakers making her voice sound emotionless. She spun on her heel and strode back to the Compound, the others flanking her. As soon as they disappeared inside, Clint spoke up.
“No, go sit at the table,” Tony cuts him off almost immediately and Clint slinks back to the kitchen dejectedly. “It’s like herding cats.”
Next to her stood Rhodes. He looked great, and Steve was happy to note that he seemed as good as new with the braces Toni had undoubtedly built for him.
“Oh my god, you are such a mom,” Peter groans, and Steve smirks at Tony’s outraged squawk.
Tony and Steve freeze from their argument in the sitting area off of the kitchen to turn and stare at him. Natasha just sighs sadly and pats his back, shaking her head. "I know, it’s very upsetting, isn’t it."
.” He receives a spectacular bitch-face for that, but he doesn’t care, too caught up in the moment.
“Anyway,” Ned hurries to finish. “We ignored him, but then he said, well, he said...”
Years pass, and Angel meets Death many more times. Their visits are short but every time, Death reassures Angel that they will see each other again. Finally, the father sends Angel away to a boarding school in another village, as she had already discovered everything there was to learn in her own. There she learns how to act like she’s fine when she not, like she’s drunk when she hasn’t had a sip of alcohol for years, like she’s a slut who will sleep with women, when all she’s doing is making sure they won’t fall into bed with the wrong man, and men. Sometimes she takes one of the more dangerous men home, but she makes sure he’s had enough to drink that he passes out on the way there. And after one particularly wild party, she meets her savior. She walks back to her home, uncaring that it’s night because it just means that she’s surrounded by Hela’s children and pets and they comfort her. Then, their soft tune changes into something more urgent, telling her that she’s got some older boys coming after her. She’s not worried though, because the butler taught her to defend herself, brought in one of the women who fought in the war and she showed Angel
“May was apparently stuck at work.” Steve shrugs.
‘You were about to be jumped,’ he tells Angel seriously. And the shadows laugh.
”She arrives and proves to her soldier she’s not a threat to them. They go in together, and find out the dragons had been a false lead. Then Angel discovers a file on her soldier’s giant lizard. She flips through it and discovers the dragon right in front of her was the one to start a fire in the forge that dreadful night so long back. She feels a slight anger at the murder of her butler, but keeps her cool. She turns to the soldier to suggest they leave, when the soldier gives her a guilty look. Suddenly things make sense. The soldier knew it was the dragon who killed her butler, yet had never told her.”
