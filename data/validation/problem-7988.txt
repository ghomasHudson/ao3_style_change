Steve rises to the bait, surging forward and pulling Tony into a kiss, water pouring between their open mouths as they rut against each other, Steve’s cock settling against Tony’s. He can feel the ridges of his abdomen as his hips slide over his skin, hands reaching down to grope that familiar lean muscle. He knows every line and plane of skin on Tony’s body at this point, his fingertips and mouth tracing over it time after time. He remembers being in total awe the first time they had sex, Steve insisting they turn on his bedside table lamp so he could watch the way Tony’s body moved and flexed as he rode him. Steve never thought of himself to be an inherently sex-driven person, but there were multiple gym sessions with Tony in the following weeks where he had to learn how best to hide an erection in gym shorts and sweats when he saw Tony’s arms or chest flex a certain way.
The fingers are his own, he realizes after a few cycles of this, feeling returning to his fingertips.
They walk through the left wing of the house, ascending up the stairs. It almost feels like Steve is walking through a museum, not someone’s home. Other than the front parlor, there are no pictures of Tony anywhere else in the mansion. The walls are mostly adorned with fine art, but Steve even manages to catch the occasional photo of Maria and Howard peppered in.
“I told them to bring the essentials first. Plates aren’t that essential— what the hell do you think takeout boxes are for?”
. “I’ll have to think about it.”
Celebration rings out in the stadium, and Tony is suddenly airborne as Thor lifts him up, swinging him around in victory. The revelry is short-lived as multiple whistles start being blown, the refs, umpire, and both coaches all suddenly rushing together towards home plate. The cheering of the crowd starts to turn into disconcerted shouts as they wait for an official ruling. Thor doesn’t set Tony down as they wait, massive arms still locked around him, letting his feet dangle a foot or two above the ground. Tony’s too focused to care, doubt beginning to creep into his mind the longer they wait.
Pierce smiles tightly and squeezes Tony’s hand with a bit more force than necessary, and Hill and Coulson each shake his hand as well before filing out after their boss like the yes-men they are.
“Cut it out,” Steve scolds, arms crossed as he watches the play unfold in front of him. “You guys are being dramatic. I’m sure he’s just getting warmed up—”
His next swing finally connects with the ball, Steve watching as it sails further and further, higher and higher, disappearing into the stands. He tosses the bat aside and immediately takes off, sprinting around the bases rather than taking his time to celebrate a home run. As soon as his feet touch down on home again, he runs off the field, brushing past Dugan and his other teammates.
“I’m trying to quit,” she sighs.
trouble-maker?”
Tony shoves his hands in his pockets, the fall chill nipping at his exposed skin. He turns to look at Steve who’s standing a few feet back, giving him his space. “What do you expect me to do here, talk to the air?” Tony grumbles.
As his fingers run over his head, he briefly remembers the sound of his skull cracking against the ground. The flash of memory is gone in a snap, Tony’s brow furrowing. Where was he when that happened? Who caused it? He can’t remember anything beyond getting on the plane in D.C… He can’t even recall leaving the airport. Did something happen there? Why hadn’t he just taken a cab straight to Steve like he originally planned?
Lana dutifully follows them as they made their way around the casino, Steve still drinking his little tumblers of whiskey at a much slower pace than Tony is getting his drinks at. He’s switched over to vodka sours at this point, sucking one of the round cherry bulbs with the stem hanging out between his teeth. They squeeze their way in front of a crowd at a roulette table, Tony eyeing his partner.
time, Tony’s cheeks and lips flushed as he raises an eyebrow. “This okay?” He asks, stilling his hand.
Tony glances back at Steve and just shrugs, letting the man put a hand on his back to guide him over to another pod of tables. He snaps his fingers at a nearby waitress standing by the bar. “What can I get you boys to drink? Anything at all, it’s on the house. I’ll have Lana here be your personal waitress tonight.” He pulls a velvet rope aside to another one of the card rooms that appears the same as the rest minus the exclusivity barrier in front of the entrance.
life every time I go outside! No one fucking deserves that, Steve, and especially not you. So I’m ending it.”
This doesn’t clear anything up for Steve. So it wasn’t that Tony had somehow gotten outsold and forced out of the Irons? “Why on earth would Tony want to switch teams? The Irons have been winning championship games for seasons now—and even that aside, it’s
The cold weather makes Steve’s knee ache as he steps out of his building, hurriedly jogging to his car. Spring training may not start up for another few weeks, but a Captain’s job is never done. He has to fight against yawn after yawn tearing its way from his mouth, a restless night’s sleep catching up to him. He’d gotten too used to the quiet of upstate, spending his early months off with Bucky. The city welcomed him back with open arms and honking horns all night. There’s always a slight adjustment period, his spare bedroom at Bucky’s place always feeling a bit too quiet at first. He’s never been able to take sudden change very well.
There are some shouts from the viewers in the stands, and even the other team’s coach angrily storms over, throwing his hands in the air. Natasha completely ignores him, still locked in what appears to be a heated discussion with one of the refs. Finally, she walks away from him, mouth pressed in a tight line as she motions to the dugout. Strange is suddenly jogging out to the field, with Janet of all people tailing behind him.
,” Maria scolds at the same time Howard slams a hand down on the table, making everyone jump.
“Oh,” Steve glances over where he left the box sitting on the bar countertop. “Actually, no, I haven’t. I kind of came straight here.”
“I still can’t believe you’re done, Tony,” Hank Pym shakes his head, running a hand over his grey beard. “You’re so
Bucky flicks him behind the ear, pointing a finger at him. “Don’t you dare compare me to that chucklefuck. Besides, I get away with it because I’m your best friend, and also not a
“Thanks,” Tony croaks before taking a pull from the bottle. They drink in companionable silence for a few minutes, listening to the crackling of the fire, the city quiet beyond Tony’s floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains. Tony eventually speaks again. “Now what are you really doing here?”
Tony’s arms remain crossed. “I don’t like to be handed things, and I also don’t give a shit about whatever amount is written on that check. I’m not in this for money.”
“Both. I favor my left though,” he admits sourly.
Peter flushes even more if it’s even possible, a nervous smile gracing his lips. “I try my best.”
Right as Tony readies himself, lifting his bat up into position, a whistle is blown. He watches as the pitcher leaves the mound to be replaced by someone else. “Seriously?” Tony can’t help but ask, looking back at Whitaker for assistance. His coach is already approaching the Ump to try and contest, but the substitute was previously marked down and deemed perfectly legal. Tony swears under his breath, squinting up at the board to see the name of the fresh pitcher who just came in. Carson Greene. Tony knows about him— he knows about all the pitchers in the MiLB. It’s how he stays on top of monitoring his own skill level. He has to make sure he’s always outranking the rest.
“That’s great, Tony,” Steve says, and he means it. Tony looks hopeful when he says it, even if he didn’t say it to seek out approval. “It is, really.”
Tony’s mouth parts easily against his own, expert tongue coaxing into Steve’s mouth, firing synapses off in his brain. One of Tony’s hands quickly maneuvers all of the buttons open on his shirt, surprisingly deft despite the alcohol and not even breaking the kiss. Steve tries not to think about how experienced Tony is in doing all this, any concern leaving his brain the moment Tony rubs a hand down his chest, nails scraping lightly over his abs and sending a shudder through his body. He groans into Tony’s mouth, feeling himself harden as Tony presses the leg in between each of Steve's closer.
On Steve’s other side, he’s able to engage in the hardcore baseball talk that always occurs when Nat and Bucky around. He isn’t sure if he’s ever met two people more destined to be together based on their analysis and love of the sport alone, both of them still keeping up with teams across both leagues. They’re fascinated by the World Team, never having seen any of the International teams play in person.
Hammer throws the first pitch, a slider that Steve doesn’t even flinch for.
“Strike two!”
“Yeah, well, we can’t all be Brooklyn born-and-raised,” Tony bumps Steve with his shoulder, slowing his unusually quick pace enough to fall in step with the taller man.
When he gets home he immediately goes to his phone, fit's dialing Tony’s cell. The line is disconnected, an automated voice telling him the person he's trying to reach is not currently accepting calls. He tries Tony’s home phone. Same issue. He doesn't even have Tony’s email address, otherwise he would go to the library right now and try and contact him that way. He mulls over the idea of trying to send Tony a letter, but realizes that even if Tony’s home to receive it, he’ll probably just laugh at the fact that Steve tried to reach him with such primitive messaging and throw it in the garbage.
“Want me to sign your stethoscope for you?” He asks, bringing up both of his immobilized hands.
She nods thoughtfully. “My partner and I just had our anniversary last month. I’ve been with her for five.”
, he thinks to himself.
"Because everyone has to go, Tony."
Steve's hands curl into fists on the arms of the chair. "Was his contract only for a year?"
. “What do I have to be nervous about?”
Steve ignores his pleas, still furious about the entire situation. Tony is protecting this woman to save his own dignity or for some other reason that Steve can't think of. Meanwhile, she’s manipulating and putting Tony at risk just for a story. He can't let that slide.
Tony didn’t pay for all of it of course. They went in on it together, Steve having plenty saved up from his illustrious career to be able to look into all sorts of real estate options in New York. Tony helped him pull the trigger on the dream he had expressed to him so many years ago in that diner of the little house upstate. It had been a long process to find the perfect fit for them, but Steve was happy with the decision they made and knew that this is the kind of house Sarah would be happy to see him living in if she were still here.
The doctor confirms most of the injuries he was able to assess himself. Apparently as of now they’re out of the red zone, his most detrimental wounds should’ve having re-opened by now if they were going to at all. At this point all his body has to do is heal, and soon he’ll be moved out of the ER and into the general wing for recovery for the next week or two. She runs a few questions by him, checking on any lasting effects from his concussion. Once he begins to recite the basic components of creating neurokinetic, morphologic nanoparticles off to her, she deems that his brain has recovered.
"Focus on your drills, Rogers," She reminds. "Leave it to me to watch what Stark does."
“I suppose,” Steve responds unenthusiastically, gritting his teeth slightly at the bitter, poignant taste of the drink.
Tony smacks his hand away, struggling to keep himself in control when his body is just thrumming with energy that wants to
The entirety of their teammates in attendance of the game as well as Natasha, Janet, and Pepper are all piled into Steve and Tony’s room, helping one another nurse any sustained injuries after taking some time to sober up. Tony had made it out of the scuffle relatively unscathed other than Hammer managing to swipe his nails across the cheek to leave some scratch marks that were deep enough to bleed. Clint may have gotten the worse out of all of them, Natasha helping him pick small shards of glass out of his forearm from where he had blocked someone’s glass from being smashed into his head.
“Steve? Steve, are you okay?”
Steve just shrugs. "Nothing, really. I mean, I spent money to upgrade my bike, fix my old beater car, but that's about it. The only other things I spend it on is paying rent, buying groceries, and then the rest goes into the bank."
“Hey now, that’s no way to speak to your Captain.”
,” Tony answered. “Come on, we can make this work. I mean, this is just
them, don’t you think?”
She drops it after that. They return to their hotel, Tony taking an hour long shower until he’s satisfied. Pepper has to go back to the stadium before the game ends because there’s two other Irons players on the team and they need her attention too. She's kind enough to order him room service before she leaves. Tony has no idea how much money she makes, but the woman needs a raise. Two raises.
“Of course it’s not, are you
“That’s not just trash talk, that’s
"You're one of the best pitchers in the entire minor league and you're asking me to put you in a different position?" New Orleans' coach, a broad and terrifying man named Whitaker, asks in disbelief when Tony presents him with this concern.
him and not
Tony just smiles in response to the question and pulls out a tall mug before going to work. He’s got some fancy coffee machine that makes the hot chocolate for him, steaming the milk as he pulls out various bottles of liqueur. Steve watches as he makes the drink behind the bar like he’s been doing it his entire life, a bit of a scary thought, but not all that surprising considering who he’s dealing with here. Mixing in Rum Chata, Baileys, peppermint schnapps, and a shot of cinnamon-flavored whiskey, he then stirs in the actual hot chocolate aspect of the drink, tops it off with some mini marshmallows, and hands it to Steve.
? You got at least another ten years before you got any right to hang up your mitt.”
Tony rips the bandaid off early, jumping up onto his coffee table to make the announcement pretty much immediately after the team has arrived, not wanting to bring the mood down after everyone’s already started drinking.
“Yup,” Sam shoves a fistful of chips into his mouth. “Another two at least. Just signed my soul over last week. How about you guys? I’m sure everyone’s knocking down your door after that big win.”
Steve can’t get a read on Bucky’s face while he gets the news. He’s not exactly happy, but it’s better than nothing, and for now that will have to be enough.
“You must think I’m such a terrible mother,” Maria says eventually, a laugh that turns into a sigh halfway through escaping from her.
Steve waits outside by Tony's car, leaning against the hood. When Tony comes out of the building and sees Steve, he can already read the distaste in Tony's eyes even from a distance. "You really wanna get me alone, don't you, Rogers?" Tony calls out. His hair is still wet from his shower and he's swimming in an old Malibu Irons sweatshirt that hangs down over some ripped jeans and converse sneakers. He looks... Well, he looks like a twenty-one year old kid for once.
Tony smiles sadly. “I know, but it’d still kill her slowly. She wants grandkids and Howard wants an heir… I feel worse about the grandkids part.”
He’s still the same rule-following dweeb from when they were kids, but his appearance has certainly changed. People mistook them as brothers when they were younger, same dark hair and intelligent eyes, but Ty’s were shrouded by thick-framed spectacles. He’s slim but well-built, lithe muscles similar to Tony’s with an added height that leaves him with an impressive stature— He might even be taller than Thor. His once brunette hair has been bleached blonde, but he’s been allowing the roots to grow back out. Tony’s first comment to him was that if he’s not careful with his haircuts in the next couple of months, he might be left with some very unfortunate looking frosted tips.
As soon as word gets out to the team he’s allowed visitors now, they come flooding in by progressively growing groups. Natasha is the first to turn up, Tony getting about a hour of calm one-on-one time with her before more of his teammates start piling in. Rhodes is next to turn up, Clint and Quill quick to follow. The amount raises exponentially, Scott, Bruce, and Thor showing up with their other teammates, arms full of balloons, stuffed animals, snacks, and other goodies. Janet comes by with swaths of get well soon cards and gifts from fans that have been piling up outside of the Avengers’ stadium. He’s touched by the fact that people seem to care, Janet telling him the news of the assault is spreading quickly, and that there’s a similar amount of presents and well wishes left outside the Knights’ stadium as well. Nurses come by to scold the rowdy group, informing them that no more than four visitors are allowed in at a time, effectively thinning the party in Tony’s cramped room over the next few days.
Steve rolls over and cracks an eye open at the alarm clock, seeing flashing numbers blinking back at him. He reaches around the back of the nightstand, grasping the cord and giving a tug. The plug easily follows, confirming his suspicions that Tony was adamant about Steve having a relaxing weekend to the point of sabotaging his usual six a.m. wake up.
“Well maybe I’m not asking permission,” Steve snaps.
“Oh, believe me, I am,” he answers, still grinning with malice. “I am sorry it played out as it did. I really do hate to see my dear friend so defeated... But let’s face it, even if something like this hadn’t happened, it was only a matter of time until you followed down your father’s dark, dark path of alcoholism. I’d hate to see you end up like your sweet parents.”
strong opinions of him now. Some offer their quiet support— a couple of townhomes on his street now flying pride flags from their porches, others just being more friendly when he passes by them on his morning bike ride. Those on the opposite end of the spectrum, however, are anything but quiet on their feelings for the matter.
?” He snaps angrily, immediately softening when he hears the voice on the line. “Oh. Sorry. Yeah, hi Mom. No, I’m okay… You watched it? Y-Yeah, thanks, Mom. It, um… It was okay. Wish I could’ve played a little more but… Yeah… Yeah, I know… But, um, did Howard..? ...Oh. No, yeah, I know he’s overseas doing business I just figured maybe— I mean, it’s the
For once Steve doesn’t mind the deflection, even if it brings up sorrowful memories. It felt like so long ago that it happened, Steve almost can’t remember all the details, trying to pick apart the haze of his memory. “I did… Have you not cried at all?”
, bodies pressed together and limbs tangled as they spoon on the couch.
“M’Tired,” he mumbles, tongue feeling heavy in his mouth. He lets out a few irritated grunts, struggling to speak around the mask planted over his face, still blowing air into him.
Tony stands up and walks towards Steve, scooping up a razor thin letter opener from Natasha’s desk. For a fleeting moment, he wonders if Tony is going to try and stab him, or worse, kiss him, but he just gestures for Steve to step aside. Steve moves away from the door, watching Tony get to his knees and start picking the lock with the letter opener.
They walk out onto the field together to where the thirty-eight members of the Avengers stand, an even mix of seasoned veterans and new additions to the league. The group immediately ceases casual conversation and straightens their posture as the duo walks out of the tunnel, standing at their full attention. Steve and Carol come to a stop in front of them, Carol just quirking an eyebrow at him, gesturing with her hand that the floor is his.
Maria lights up. "You have a good eye."
Steve and Tony exchange glances with a smile. Steve kneels down in front of her. “We are, nice catch there. What’s your name?”
“I don’t want to interrupt your interview, Mr. Stark—”
Peter’s eyes shine, and that’s apparently all it takes before the floodgates open. They spend the next few hours talking about their shared loves for science and maths, Tony just imagining poor Bruce probably having to endure the kid’s motor mouth. Then again, he puts up with Tony, so this little sapling is probably no skin off his nose. Peter is exceptionally bright, both in how he plays baseball and talks about his knack for science. He really does remind Tony of himself.
“No,” Tony denies, soft but insistent. He wipes some sweat from his brow, hands trembling slightly. “I don’t know what’s going on but I can do this, okay? I
is on,” he explains. “I love this movie.”
The whistle blows for the half, players from both sides exiting the field. Tony skips the seventh inning stretch pep talk from Natasha, knowing he’ll get an earful for it later, win or lose. He locks himself in a bathroom to just be alone and
He seems honest. Relief washes over Tony. At least he doesn’t have to add Homophobic Childhood Friend to his escalating list of outside factors attempting to thwart their relationship.
“Thanks,” Bucky cuffs his shoulder, letting him know there are no hard feelings. The Stars get one more run in before getting their third out, tying it up yet again. At the top of the sixth inning, still no progress has been made. Steve is trying his best to focus, but he keeps finding his eyes drawn over to observe Bucky. He’s playing hard, extending himself to get those outs they need. The Mockingbirds have switched it up from their bunting method, now challenging the outfielders, specifically center field.
“He’s got Barnes’ blood and your name, of course he isn’t,” Natasha says dryly, smiling gratefully when Carol slides her a beer.
“He’s actually been very well behaved this visit. I might even give him a lollipop,” she smiles, patting Tony on the back to signal he can get up.
“Tony!” Ty puts his hand on his chest in clear offense. “I was
Steve throws another glance over his shoulder, his jaw hard set. It’s a fair pitch, but Tony stands by his point. “Trust me,” he mouths to Steve. If he slips up now because of a little sweat on his brow, then he’s not nearly the player Tony thinks he is.
Steve scoots his chair closer, leaning through the space separating them to press a kiss to his temple. His lips are warm and Tony can’t help but tilt his head closer, following the gravitational pull the man always has on him. “What are you thinking?” Steve murmurs against his hairline, reaching out to clasp his cold fingers between his hands.
Dressed only in his underwear, Steve slides out of bed and gropes along the wall until he’s able to find a light switch. His clothes are still strewn about the floor, but he also notices something folded at the foot of the bed. It’s a set of his own sweats, Steve holding them up to see they are the clothes he had let Tony borrow after his melt down in the rain a few months back. He had completely forgotten ever giving them to him, touched that Tony had actually thought to set them out for Steve upon waking up.
Tony’s smile is brighter than the sun. His eyes are a burning amber, face flushed with exertion and hysteria. Tear tracks shine on his cheeks, the rest of his skin shining with sweat, hair pushed back and sticking out in wild waves finally freed from underneath his hat. His jersey is untucked and hanging open, pants stained with red dirt and grass. He’s beautiful. Chaotic and brazen energy thrumming around him like something tangible, unable to hide his brilliance even if he tried. He runs towards Steve, Steve meeting him half-way.
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve whispers. “I know you’ve probably heard that a million times but… I’m just sorry you’re having to go through this. It’s not fair.”
"Morning," Tony huffs under his breath as he heads for the door. Steve hears an intense sounding electronic lock slide into place behind them, following Tony up the dark path back to the house. There's a few steep inclines that Tony almost face plants on, but he shoves Steve's arm away every time it's offered.
Tony actually straightens up a bit, feeling the light-hearted mood of the small crowd shift slightly at the implication, unsure if it’s just a joke in poor taste or that he’s not making a joke at all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, but then again, everything that comes out of your mouth is a crock of horseshit anyway, so I really shouldn’t be surprised.”
Steve sighs and holds his hands up in surrender. “Alright, alright. Don’t be late next time.”
Tony sighs and rolls his eyes so hard his head tips back towards the ceiling and stays there. "My old man wanted to invite you over to our house for dinner."
Steve has to shake himself out of it, still holding onto Bucky’s arm. He drops his hand away, nodding. “Yeah, sorry. That was… that was a lot." There's a tightness in his chest that's beginning to alleviate now that Bucky is standing in front of him, Steve now feeling a little ridiculous for freaking out. He's used to the crowds by now, and he certainly knows what to expect coming off a momentous win like that, but he had just felt so lost.
He smiles and leans over enough to plug it back in, checking his watch on the nightstand to reset the time. It’s a little after eight, meaning Tony probably left a few hours ago to get back to the city in time, and that Steve better get moving if he doesn’t want to be late himself.
“We’ll see,” Tony hums and very gently pushes Steve’s hand off his thigh. He avoids his gaze, staring out of the window for the rest of the ride.
fuck me.”
Steve and the rest of the team don’t have that much to do in the first couple of innings as far as defense goes. Tony’s pitches are aggressive, leaving absolutely no room for mistakes. The furthest one of their opponents runners can get is to second base before they’re either tagged out by Steve or their teammate at bat is struck out by Tony.
“What song was that?” Steve asks quietly, almost hating to follow up such beautiful refrain with his own boring, flat voice.
Tony leans forward, lacing his fingers together behind Steve’s neck. “Oh come on, you were never
It’s getting harder to breathe. Tony’s vision is starting to black out around the edges, his hands in front of his face blurring. The photos keep flashing in his mind, even after he squeezes his eyes shut. The moment that once made his heart race is coming back to do so again, now for all the wrong reasons. His chest hurts, lungs expanding painfully against his rib cage every time he thinks about Steve’s face. How could he be so stupid? So reckless? He’s ruined this. He’s ruined everything.
” Steve offers optimistically.
Tony doesn’t take his eyes of Steve’s when he addresses her, lips curling attractively around the cigarette in his mouth. “No time like the present, Jan.”
Tony is late.
The raucous group all come together to start the final countdown, ten seconds left in the year. Tony keeps his eyes on everyone sitting and standing in front of him, all their eyes glued to the TV, and away from him and Steve. It’s a little risky, but as long as his little trick works out, they shouldn’t have anything to worry about.
Where Steve had expected Tony to only draw back further, to become more hostile after letting Steve see him so vulnerable, he actually seems to open up, as minuscule as the change is. There’s no way he can know exactly what Steve and Howard had discussed about him, but maybe he can tell that whatever they had talked about made Steve ease up a little as well.
“If you got a good offer from a team somewhere, I’d go with you. You’re not uprooting me at all,” Steve denies. “Obviously a good chunk of the MLB resides in the South, so that crosses a fair amount off the list… but there’s always the West Coast…”
“He’s a good kid,” Steve argues. “Don’t talk about him like he’s a liability!”
Of all the vacation homes in the Stark’s name, their Truro cottage only comes second to the villa in Italy. It took about twenty years for Tony to fully appreciate the quaint little home on the bluff. As a kid, he always preferred the vacation estate in Italy which is at least ten times the size, not including all the land used for the vineyard and horse stables. Growing up, this was the boring option. A little house in the middle of nowhere with a bland, deserted beach, and the nearest town too quaint for his childhood desire for excitement and stimuli. Now, it’s the perfect escape from the constant barrage of animosity he’s been experiencing the past two months.
“Probably too long,” Steve answers with a laugh, going through his rounds of hugs and ‘good to see you’s to those he doesn’t see quite as often. “I’m glad everyone could make it. Tony’s going to be so happy.”
Tension is high as Steve watches the game from the sidelines. He can almost feel his knee flaring up in protest, even if it’s nothing more than a phantom pain. He played for the first half of the game, and they had been ahead, but now they’ve slipped under their opponents thumb within the last couple of innings. They’re at the end of the rope, bottom of the ninth, with only one player on second, and two outs already. Lang is up to bat, but Steve’s eyes are trained on their sole runner.
Tony swears under his breath, dipping his head low so the brim of his cap covers his expression. He can’t let one player’s carelessness get in the way of the goal at hand, but he sure made this harder. The defensive lineup he’s up against is ridiculously strong, a well-oiled machine who isn’t going to let Tony get away with anymore than a double. That could’ve gotten Nancy all the way home if he played his cards right, but now Tony is up against a behemoth of a defense team with only Steve on first and two outs against him.
“I can’t believe he’s
“What can I get you?” An older looking woman with chunky highlights dyed in her hair and too much silver eyeshadow asks, looking at Tony curiously.
The other man is right, but Steve still didn’t feel right berating one of his players when they weren’t doing well. He adjusts his critiquing methods to the players, but Tony was unlike anyone Steve had ever played with. “His parents just died, I was trying to go easy on him…”
“Do you want to stop?” Tony asks, Steve’s eyes darting down to his mouth when he sees his tongue swipe across them.
“Strike two!”
“Yeah, I guess so,” Steve answers, not really having thought about it. “I was kind of a sickly kid growing up. Bad immune system, allergic to everything. There was an empty sandlot outside the apartment I grew up in and kids were always gathering down there to play. No one ever invited me until Bucky noticed me watching from the firescape one day and called me down.”
“I can do whatever I want with it, and that doesn’t include throwing five thousand dollars on a 50/50 game of chance.”
“You should rejoin the majors.”
Steve hollers and bangs on the tables like everyone else, holding his glass up in the air for not only his captain, but his idol.
Pepper hums. “Yeah, Tony’s got physics on his side, but he lacks the technique. Just because he knows the angle and speed to throw the ball at, and can predict the spin, the way those pins fall are a bit of a wild card for him.” She glances sideways at him with a small smile. “Although I guess I don’t have to ask who you’re backing. Gotta support your man, right?”
Natasha’s eyes roll into the back of her head, never a fan of Steve interrogating her about decisions she’s made. To be fair, they’re supposed to be on the same page most of the time, a cohesive pair as Coach and Captain of the team. “As hilarious as it was to see his hissy fit on television at the All-Star game last year, you have to admit he did a great job as SS. Obviously, this is going to stay between you and me, but I’m not planning on letting him step foot on that mound
on a night out. Now head down, Gigantor.”
“Jesus fucking chri—
, says the look
“Hm?” Comes the drowsy reply from the other side of the room.
“Thanks,” he mouths. Even though it’s Steve’s job to try and get as many players out as possible, Tony likes to think that this one in particular was just for him.
“I’ll just have a black coffee,” Steve replies. The way the waitress is batting her eyelashes at him, he suddenly prefers her attention being focused on the man sitting in other side of the booth.
Irritation flickers across Tony’s face. He figures this conversation is over with, but evidently, Steve has other plans. “Basically. I haven’t actually gotten any kind of formal contract to sign but I told Janet and Pierce I want nothing to do with it.”
, and it puts a bad taste in his mouth. Tony spits on the ground to rid the memory and crouches in a ready position. He has a newfound drive for this game, and it's to get Steve Rogers out at every opportunity provided. It would probably feel more satisfying if he could've knocked him out as a pitcher, but catching an out would have to do.
to be ashamed of—”
. I know your game is to probably woo through brief hand holding and shy glances with your gorgeous blue eyes, but not everyone needs to be
“Alright, get the hell outta here.”
She sighs. “That’s not exactly true. You know no one
, really… Yeah, I just ate…” Another sigh. “Mhm… Yeah, I know I do… Thanks, Mom… Yes, I’ll tell her… Alright, love you too. Bye.”
"This is your first time speaking on behalf of the team. Nervous?"
Randomly being called by the Team Manager for a meeting during the off-season can mean a million things. Janet doesn’t specify why she wants to speak with Tony, just leaves him a message during his and Steve’s morning run that she needs to speak with him in her office whenever he has the chance to swing by. Not giving him a definitive time frame he’s supposed to show up at may be the most suspicious part of all of this. Normally she’ll at least lie to him so that when he shows up late he might unknowingly be turning up right on time.
“Well…” he can hear the struggle in Steve’s voice of him trying to find the bright side for Tony who wears a permanent pair of sunglasses. “Your first league game is tomorrow right? That’s exciting! And it’s in New York!”
win us games.”
He’s being so fucking blasé that Tony wants to scream. Shouldn’t he care more about this? Or at least show a modicum of surprise at this news? “I told them no, of course.”
Tony wonders if he had been missing something. He didn’t know the beginning of their relationship caused so much turmoil for him. “Were you surprised it was a man?”
a stubborn ass.”
“Then why are you pushing for this so hard?”
He never appreciates the kind of people who act the way Tony does— an entitled bully who can’t be bothered by anything or anyone— but there’s something extra infuriating about Tony’s behavior that really brings out the worst in him. Maybe it’s their leftover history from the All-Star game from last Summer. At the time, Tony hadn’t really stood out in his memories. He still tends to shy away from too much baseball talk in his personal life. Once he leaves that stadium, Steve doesn’t read the papers or tune in his radio to hear people talk about whatever the current hot topic is in the league. Apparently for the past couple years, Tony Stark has been
For once, Ty walks away with the last word.
Steve presses his lips together. What he wouldn't give to ruin a dinner with his mom at least one more time. Mentioning this aloud isn’t going to help Tony not hate him any less. "She'd probably still appreciate the apology," he says quietly.
, Pepper!” Tony hisses, flinching away from the peroxide soaked cotton ball again.
“Yes,” Tony affirms. “I’m here to play only if you’ll have me. I’m asking for your blessing, so to speak.”
Hurt flashes across Steve’s face before his expression turns guarded. He fixes a hard stare on Tony, jaw clenched tightly. “Tony. Stop.”
“Oh, so that’s how we’re going to play,” he growls, immediately digging his hands into the snow to start packing a snowball in retaliation.
“What do you think I should do?”
Tony glances back towards his cell phone sitting on the bed. He’s already a half hour late to the restaurant he was supposed to be meeting his old gambling buddies at, so there’s no harm in sparing a little more time to see if the movie adaptation is any good. “Yeah, okay, I’ll give it a scene or two,” he complies, laying down on his stomach with his head at the foot of Steve’s bed, ankles crossed in the air behind him. Steve turns up the volume and flicks off the lights for a proper viewing experience.
“Okay, I didn’t need to know
Peggy truly is a terrifying creature when she’s angry. Steve remembers how her accent seemed to strengthen when she would lecture the team, calling them
love with you. And it scares the absolute, ever-loving shit out of me because I’ve never been in love with anyone except myself. And I didn’t expect to fall for you
Steve meanders around the house, peeking into open doorways as he makes his way back to the stairs. Howard’s warnings about Tony swim around in his head, Steve forcing them away as nothing more than ramblings of a drunk. He ascends up to the third floor of the house which has two large oak doors towards the center of the estate, overlooking the main foyer. Steve pushes them open, his jaw dropping at the size of this library.
“Damn straight. But he might have just a little to do with that,” she says, giving Tony a friendly nudge with her elbow. She glances over her shoulder to where her father is gathering their things on the dock. “I better help Dad load up the truck before he throws out his back trying to do it all by himself.” She turns back to Tony, a pensive look on her face. “You said you’re out in Truro? Would you like to come back up here tomorrow morning and meet me for a run?”
Within a few seconds of Steve trying not to stare at the pink tip of Tony’s tongue as it stuck out between his teeth in concentration, there’s a little
He can almost see the weight get lifted off Peggy’s shoulders. He had always been so absorbed in his and Buck’s own feelings about the matter that he never really considered that maybe it was harder on their manager than he had thought. “Glad to hear that… Well, I should get going,” she peeks over her shoulder at where Tony is parked, fiddling with something on his dashboard as he waits with a furrowed brow. Steve is surprised he hasn’t laid on the horn yet. “We need to catch up just the two of us soon though.”
“Happy?” Steve asks, holding his arms out in approval.
Either way, he’s grateful for Steve’s insistence on a real, home-cooked meal every now and again. As he watches the man bring over their dinner, setting down the sides dishes in the center of his rickety old dining room table, Tony feels that prickle of sadness dig a little deeper at the thought of ever leaving this behind.
with Tony, but he’s not going to push. Why fix what isn’t broken, right? Steve’s in a little over his head too with everything, so maybe Tony being gun shy about calling their relationship more than just an
Tony gives an encouraging squeeze. “All the locals here know me and my family,” he pauses to wave at little old Mary sitting on her porch knitting, who gives a friendly wave and a bright smile. “No one’s going to yell at us or call the paparazzi. We’re safe here,” he promises. He’s introduced Steve as “his friend” a few times to the store clerks and restaurant in town who he’s all known since childhood. Everyone’s been nothing but warm and welcoming, not even batting an eyelash.
He hangs around their room for a while longer, flips through channels on the TV, people-watches from the balcony, has a brief but fulfilling phone call with Pepper who didn’t accompany Obadiah on the trip, but would be arriving before the game tomorrow. A group of the Avengers are arriving in the morning as well, regular league play taking a break for the couple of days surrounding the All-Star match.
Tony grins from behind the welding mask, flipping it up once he's satisfied with his work. "Completely untrue, Pep. We all know I'm a priority."
“...Stark is on shortstop, Wilson is on third, and as always, Shade is catching. Subs might change by tomorrow morning, as always, there will be no questions, and you all can get out of my sight because you’re all goddamn filthy. Dismissed.”
“Hm, and yet here we are,” Tony heaves out a loud sigh. “What are you on about anyway? Aren’t you alone in
Steve is just about to leave the men’s room when he hears Tony's name, making him hesitate. It's a woman's voice speaking, her voice echoing from the other restroom next door.
“Ouch. Sorry, Julius,” Steve says to the calendar before throwing his covers off him.
“They’ve made up their mind, Tony,” Tiberius interrupts. “But I heard after your hands heal, you could be added back to the active roster—”
Their flight into Massachusetts landed just a few hours ago, but he couldn’t fall back asleep after the drive out to the outer cape. Steve was fast asleep the moment he hit the mattress of the four-poster bed, Tony only managing to rest for an hour or two before he quietly slipped out of the master bedroom and onto the back porch overlooking the bluffs beyond while wrapped in a warm blanket. It’s pitch dark out, the moon barely a sliver in the sky. Tony has been holed up in overpopulated cities for so long that he almost forgot what it was like to look up at a dark velvet sky and see it dotted with countless stars.
“Alright, Mr. Stark,” Dr. Hallstatt is smiling as she comes in, flipping through the last of her paperwork. “Looks like you are finally cleared to go. It’s been a pleasure having you, and honestly, even I’m surprised that I mean that.” She sets a bag in his lap, full of all the lovely pain medications he’ll be taking for the next month. “Read the labels carefully and call me if you have any questions about refilling the prescription. And
“Tell that to the six-figure contracts,” she sighs before gathering up all the cards and shuffling them between two expert hands. “Alright, what’s next, Poker?”
She holds up a hand. “Save the excuses. As long as it doesn’t interfere with your performance, I don’t care. I get it, being homesick. I would run back to Boston in a heartbeat if I had the time. I’ll look the other way for now, but as soon as it makes you miss a game or practice, or if your numbers start to slip, you’re cut off, got it?” She cuffs the back of his head and sends him in to get changed.
He scrubs through channels as he drives, eventually catching the tail end of one weather report stating there won’t be any snow until early tomorrow morning. The news channel immediately shifts back to the main anchor, summarizing the main events that Steve now misses out on due to Bucky assuring him that
To most people, six and a half hours of prep time for anything may seem excessive. Since getting drafted, Steve learned very quickly that this was just the way of baseball. Of course, an entire day of practice leading up to the game isn’t just nonstop drills. There’s plenty of breaks, one-on-one time with the coach, cool-down time an hour before the game begins, and crosstalk about possible strategies and plays in the locker room beforehand.
Dove giggles, a sound so fake it almost makes Steve gag. "No harder than usual.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right,” Steve agrees, eyes drifting back towards the ceiling. “I should let you go. Sorry again about not being able to make it.”
Steve stands there in awe as Tony gets into the driver’s seat. "Is this a Shelby Cobra?" He blurts, still surprised Tony isn’t cruising around in some newer, European model.
“No we don’t!” Tony bursts, finally looking up at Steve. The man’s staring at him with shock and sadness written across his face, hands helplessly reaching out to attempt to coax Tony back to him. “I’m the last thing you need, and you’re the last thing I need,” he spits angrily. “I don’t want to do this anymore. I can’t be in a relationship like this that makes me so fucking scared about every aspect of my well-being and my partner’s. We tried okay? We tried for a long time and we did pretty good. Hell, it was even fun at first! Sneaking around, lying to the world, but that’s over now. Neither of us needs this. I should’ve never come out.”
Inclement weather cancels their first two games of the season, pushing them over into the second week of April. It’s a home game, the field still moist from that morning’s downpour, but the sun’s rays begin to peek through the distant storm clouds, and it looks like they’ll finally be starting the season.
"Clearly," Tony mutters under his breath. He turns around, crossing his arms and leaning against one of the shower stalls. There's no curtain or door, just the linoleum wall to separate one showerhead from the next. Steve almost wants to avert his eyes. He’s seen all the players naked in passing, but things suddenly feel intimate where Tony is concerned. "What, you didn't get enough of an eyeful last weekend? Nothing's private between us now, right?" Tony asks sarcastically while padding towards him slowly, causing Steve to take a step back.
“You’re thinking too much,” Steve whispers, rubbing a thumb between Tony’s pinched eyebrows. “You’re exhausted. We’ll talk about it more in the morning, let’s just go to bed.”
“Nah, that sounds stupid, it’ll never take off,” Tony snorts, tilting his head to look sideways at Steve. “Is this offer a team kind of outing or a Just-You-and-Me thing?”
Doctor Hallstatt goes on to explain all of his injuries, a long list that Steve has to sit down halfway through just to keep his knees from buckling. Multiple fractured ribs, a gash on the side of his head that needed five stitches, his left wrist and some of the bones in his hand and thumb were broken, and his right suffered a sprain. A slight puncture of his right lung from the injuries to his rib cage was still being treated, a small incision made during surgery to help the trapped air in his chest cavity escape while the tissue heals. For the internal damage, he was given emergency blood transfusions to correct the drop in blood pressure and blood loss, and the other corrections were successful, his wounds properly sutured. Now that the pressure has been alleviated to a substantial level, all that’s needed is time and the damage done to the inside is already healing by itself. Even though the worst of it isn’t outwardly visible, he has countless bruising all across his body from the attack. He suffered a severe concussion that they still need to wait for Tony to regain consciousness to fully assess, but shouldn’t be anything worse than some confusion and short-term memory loss for a few days. The X-Rays of his skull showed a slight fracture near the same site that the stitches were needed, but luckily no sign of brain damage or any trauma to permanently damage cognitive functions.
Steve is so stunned that he allows Howard to shake his hand a little longer than socially acceptable. His fingers are a little sore once Howard finally drops his hand away. "You're a fan of mine?" he asks in disbelief. Stark is one of the biggest names in the U.S. baseball scene. Their production company has made some of the best gear since the sport started. In the past couple of decades, they have begun branching into other fields as well. Automobiles, clothing brands, standardized police weapons, power resources, interior design, you name it. One would have to be living under a rock to have not heard the Stark name, but in the baseball world it’s considered blasphemy.
him. It’s sad, really. “Hilarious, Stark, really, so funny. Always something to say— I don’t know how your new team puts up with you.”
She glances back over the files. “There’s nothing here from any police reports, but I imagine that will be filed and investigated afterwards. He was unconscious when they brought him in, and his injuries do appear to be caused by some kind of physical trauma. That’s all the info I have for you right now.”
Steve doesn’t have time to ask Tony to clarify when a woman suddenly slips into the space on Tony’s other side, leaning in front of him. “Hi, Mr. Stark? Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. Is it okay if I talk to you for a few? Off the record, of course,” she flashes a brilliant white smile, holding out her hand.
“Yeah,” he immediately jumps in, picking Bucky’s jacket off a balance beam so he can help the man into it. “I mean, last week you could only get it to about forty-five, right?”
She hums in interest and they leave it at that. The snow is starting to come down heavier than before, Steve getting the address for Clint’s homestead from Natasha before catching a cab back to his own apartment. There’s supposed to be a pretty hefty snowfall on the way, so he hopes Natasha gets out of the city safely tonight.
She dotes over Tony especially, stroking his face and hair. “You’re not looking so good, that’s not a happy face. Must not be eating good enough food but we fix that today,” she tuts, then turns on Steve with a scolding finger. “Make sure he keeps eating, Handsome. You need to take care of him.”
“Stop looking at me like that,” Tony orders, suddenly very interested in the thread count of his hospital bed sheets. “What? He’s a good kid is all.”
Tony wants to keep up the charade of self-righteousness, but he can’t help but feel that wave of sadness he’s been trying to keep at bay when he looks at Natasha’s expression. “...I heard you were the only other person fighting for me to stay.”
The stadium is mostly empty when he shows up. It looks like there’s a couple of school buses parked out front, maybe some kind of field trip for one of the local elementary or middle schools, not very uncommon during the off-season. Half of him wants to roam around to try and find them for a surprise, but he doesn’t want to keep Janet waiting and his own curiosity is taking precedence right now. Maybe there’ll be time for that after.
let alone Tony. I’ll call him up right now and we can get everything sorted out.”
“Was he drunk?” Steve asks quietly, breaking the silence. Peggy shoots him an unreadable look that he ignores, eyes still trained on Tony’s still face.
“Hm,” Bucky ponders for a moment. “Yeah, I remember Barton, that guy’s pretty cool. Sure they won’t mind if it’s just me?”
“Like I said, it was Tony’s call,” Natasha frowns, tapping her fingers on her arm rest. “I assume the point isn’t just to move on to something bigger and better to outgrow the family name. People would be just as outraged if Tony started playing for the majors considering all the controversy around how he approaches the game. The fans may love his
Tony purposely hits a single. Examining the IL’s defensive set up, a double or a triple is definitely possible, but he's just petty enough to put his personal agenda to get closer to Steve Rogers above trying to get a better run, the All-Star Game be damned.
They all get out on floor nineteen, leaving Steve to go back up to floor twenty. His room is in the opposite direction of Tony's, but he finds his feet carrying him back towards room 2071.
He can’t help but be angry with Natasha, and he lets his frustration be known as soon as practice ends and the rest of the team hits the showers.
Rezzo stares at him as if he’s just grown a third head. “What? Are you insane?”
"Owner of the Malibu Irons and CEO of Stark Industries, of course," Steve interrupts once he finally puts a face to a name.
Tony grins at him as the whistle is blown and Waynes steps up to bat. “I won’t, sir. Thanks for trusting me.”
wasn’t able to make it thanks to being snuggled up with their secret lover.”
overdue for retirement. I won’t be able to rest easy unless I can find someone capable enough to fill the position— Probably because Fury’s ghost would haunt me if I didn’t—” she glances towards the sky before looking back at Steve. “And, well, I’m just going to be straightforward with you: I want you to take over as Manager of the Avengers.”
“Are you serious?!” Tony outbursts, hearing a few snickers from behind him. He doesn’t care what the other players think of him right now. “I get an out, two out assists, steal a base, and score a run within the first two innings and you want to take me
Tony reaches out and grabs the key cards before they can be placed in Steve’s palm, but the older man doesn’t look too bothered by it, a thoughtful look on his face. “Wait, he used to be on the Panthers. I played against him in the World Series.”
of his discarded baseball glove underneath the passenger’s seat of their car.
“Nat, got any fours?”
“It’s nothing serious,” Steve tries to brush off, thinking that even to his own ears the words sound like lies. Of course he wants
She shrugs and waves over at the computer room. "Take all the time you want, I like to be slow closing so I actually have an excuse when I'm late to dinner."
“Hmm?” Tony sighs sleepily, eyelids fluttering without opening all the way. “I was… list’n to that…” he mumbles, tucking his face into Steve’s chest. “...m’work’n…”
“Never seen it,” Tony muses, straying closer.
Tony tears the plastic off the sucker, popping it into one cheek. “You got it! Thanks again, Hel!”
“Yes, do
"And?" Steve asks, trying not to sound too hopeful.
no such thing,” he responds curtly, expression indifferent. “She’s been an advocate for you to join the Knights for the past few years now and is an old friend of Mr. Fury’s
“Exactly,” Natasha sighs. “The way Janet laid it out to me… Tony is sick of the negative attention around the fact that he started playing for his father’s team with no prior baseball experience. While it’s obvious to most people he’s perfectly capable of handling himself in a Triple-A league—hell, he’d be great for the majors if he worked out a few personality kinks—he still gets criticism on whether or not there’s nepotism involved.”
Tony rolls his eyes and Steve has to clench his fist at the side so he can fight the primal reaction to punch him. If he has to see Tony roll those goddamn eyes one more time when he’s just trying to be nice, he’s not so sure he’ll be able to hold back that violent instinct he
"Okay, it looks like they're all set out there," Peggy says, some of the tension leaving her shoulders right before she walks out onto the small stage set up for their statement.
He can see what he thinks is Tony miming a zipper over his mouth in his periphery as he dazedly stumbles his way over to the opposite side of the small room that feels like it’s getting smaller every second. He sinks down into a chair, placing his head in both his hands. His fingers curl into his hair, tightening at the roots before releasing and tightening again. He repeats this motion a few times just to keep the feeling from leaving his fingers, the blindside taking him out of the moment.
“Start the car for me, I’ll be right back,” Steve presses his car keys into Bucky’s hand before breaking off into a jog, passing right by the exit doors of the stadium.
Steve!” He cries out, throwing his head back “I can’t
"Oh, no, I'm getting lunch with my nephew. He wanted to celebrate my new title," she chuckles and checks her watch. "I should be used to him running late by now honestly— Oh, there he is."
going to open the door for when he was trying to hook up with a hot blonde, it’s Steve Rogers.
“Yes,” Tony moans, his breath fogging against the wall where his cheek his pressed up against it.
He walks through the crowds of mixed jerseys, everyone here supporting different teams and players from across the entire MiLB. Thought it isn’t really a Yankees game, the fact that they’re hosting brings plenty of blue and white jerseys for Steve to blend in with. He’s hardly the only person there with STARK and 42 blazoned across his back, but that doesn’t stop the occasional fan from recognizing him and asking for an autograph or a picture.
Steve and Bucky exchange surprised looks before turning their gaze back to Peggy who is smirking at them with her well-known, red-lipped smile. "The Stars are lucky to have scooped the two of you out of the Double-As when we did. In all my years of baseball, I don't know if I've ever seen two people play off each other as well as you two do. Welcome to the team and we hope you stay with us."
“Relax, Steve, I don’t judge. Age is just a number and you two are adults, so it’s none of my business,” Pepper holds her hands up. “All that aside… He tells me how
, and I’m going to make the most of being back in my old stomping grounds. I would tell you about all the incredible weekends I’ve had there if I was ever sober enough to remember them.”
With the clock ticking closer towards Last Call, and his tumultuous thoughts sobering him up, Steve decides it’s definitely time to go home. He needs to find Bucky first, knowing that he will probably want to hop on the back of Steve's motorcycle to get home. Pretty much as soon as he steps back into the bar, his friend is bumping into him. "Hey, I'm going home with Jessica. Didn't want to leave before I saw ya again," he slings an arm around Steve's shoulder. “I'll see ya tomorrow, yeah?"
-ing themselves over the fact that I'm showing up all of their favorite old players who can't handle a little change in the game."
Tony lifts his head, looking up at Steve with an unreadable expression that can’t settle between confusion, wariness, or rejection. Tony doesn’t falter in their dance steps, but the pace does lag behind the rhythm of the music. Neither of them correct it, their conversation taking precedence over coordination.
Now that the jig is up, the staff comes out of hiding as well and starts getting orders together to make fresh pizza for everyone, customized to however they like. Steve isn’t very picky when it comes to pizza, so while most of the team tries to coordinate their orders, he goes over to try on bowling shoes.
“Why are you bringing so much?” Steve questions in disbelief. Despite the judgement and annoyance written across his face, he still walks over to where Tony’s extra suitcase is sitting with three garment bags stacked on top of it. “We won’t even be gone for that long.”
“No, I haven’t heard yet. I got here not too long ago,” he leads her over to a couch so she can sit down. Her hands are trembling and he can see rumpled tissues peeking out of her coat pockets. “His injuries look like it was from some kind of assault though.”
"Glad you could finally make it," Obadiah says from behind Tony as he finds himself a spot on the bench, sitting by the other two pitchers who play for the Irons.
so confident in the fact that he was going to get Steve to fuck him once everyone was gone. He presses forward experimentally, sliding in half-way thanks to Tony’s forethought. He swears under his breath, head resting between Tony’s shoulder blades as he tries to hold himself back, rolling his hips slowly to continue to push inside of him, bit by bit. Even with the amount of times they’ve done this, in a countless number of positions, Steve always feels his breath get taken away the moment he presses into Tony’s body, the tightness of his muscle and reactions his body gives always leaving him in awe.
Peggy looks as equally surprised. He hasn't seen her in person since the last time he left her office after being dismissed from the Stars and that was about three years ago. "Steve!" she greets with a smile once the shock has subsided. She hugs him and he welcomes the embrace. She pulls away, holding him at arm’s length. "You look good. I hear you're captain of this team now," she's beaming at him and he feels a swell of pride.
Steve shakes his head. Of course. He had promised Steve he’d come straight home from the airport, but had clearly decided a pit stop necessary first. He knew Tony was probably just trying to manage his anxiety, but it hurt deep in his chest that he felt he couldn’t even face Steve sober after months of not seeing each other.
“What channel is it on again?”
Steve closes his eyes in embarrassment. “It’s… been a while…”
They end up losing, but it’s still a game well played, Steve giving his respects to the other team as they go down the line and shake hands. He gives Williams a pat on the back, letting him know what a fantastic job he did as shortstop as he follows the rest of the team back into the locker room.
“He’s going to press
A four year relationship doesn’t just go away overnight. Steve constantly reminds himself that Tony’s smiles are no longer for him. His touches are fleeting and innocent, not leading to anything more than a bit of friendly contact. He can sense Tony still has his guard up, whether it’s to protect his own heart or just keep Steve safe from the chaos there. He’s still so painfully, undeniably, without a doubt, hung up on Tony. He didn’t use their time apart to move on. He’s just as much in love with Tony as he was the day he turned up on his doorstep on Christmas Eve of ‘92, damp with snow and clutching a very meaningful gift in his hands.
Tony scoffs, smiling at Steve like he had said something particularly adorable and naive. “Mom left for Sunday breakfast with her girlfriends, and Howard is in bed nursing a hangover. Starks are bigger on the
Steve feels ice in his veins, hair raising on the back of his neck in alarm. There’s a moment that he wants to believe their coach is joking, but she would never kid about something like this. The room is deathly silent, shock evident across every Avengers’ face, none of them knowing what to possibly say in that moment.
He lets his eyes close, completely unconcerned by the world around him. They’re with mostly friends here, but even the strangers don’t stop either of them from showing their full affection to each other. They’re two men dancing together at their dear friends’ wedding. Two men who snuck off to have sex a couple of hours ago. Two men who are irrevocably in love with one another, and no amount of onlookers could change that.
you, there were plenty others…”
“Don’t put any weight on it,” she warns, but is ignored by Steve who steps away from both of them.
Tony makes good on the first part of his deal. He tags out one player himself, and also manages to get the ball to first base and home for two more outs. He can hear the garbled praise from the announcer’s box as they move into the bottom of the third with no runs for the International League.
This question flusters Steve much more than the last one did. He glances towards Peggy who's giving him a patient look. She takes a deep breath, motioning for Steve to copy her.
He tries putting off the cast as long as possible, hating the idea of having to go around with this big, clunky, plaster abomination on his arm for the next few months. Doctor Hallstatt eventually comes into his room himself and tells him they need to do it while his bones are still properly set to heal.
As promised, nurses come by a couple of hours later to collect Tony’s things and wheel him down to the other wing. He’ll be allowed visitors now, Steve informing him that the team has been coming by constantly to check in on his condition, namely Rhodey and Bruce. Tony feels a pang of sadness, trying to remember the last time he corresponded with either of them. He thought he has been doing everyone a service, keeping his distance with all the controversy these past couple of years, but maybe he’s only been harming himself in the process.
Strange definitely pitches less aggressively than Tony had been, but they still manage to pull a win for the first game. Natasha already informed him that he’d only be playing in the first game and that Williams is going to sub into his position for the second, so he hits the showers during that 30 minute break period. He wanders around the locker room after changing into sweatpants and a Manhattan Avengers sweatshirt, but there’s still no sign of Tony. He opens the pitcher’s locker curiously, peeking inside to see that nothing had been touched.
Janet’s hand flies up to massage her temple, squeezing her eyes shut. “It’s not about that, Tony. We’ve been working so hard to clean up your image and now you go and do this. It’s not going to matter whatever Hammer said to you because
Tony can feel his anger and frustration mounting. “You’re the one always lecturing everybody about injuries and taking care of them properly and blah, blah, blah! But now you’re not even taking your own advice!” Tony shouts at him, stepping closer into Steve’s personal space. “Don’t you care about yourself?!”
The room is dimly lit with two levels to the vast room, huge bookshelves lining the walls. Steve has never seen anything quite like it, plenty of tables and large, comfortable looking armchairs to sit in. Steve notices Maria curled in one of the bay windows towards the back of the room, now wearing a silk nightgown with what looks like a photo album in her lap. She's staring out the window and hasn't noticed Steve has walked in.
Tony glares at him before finally unbuckling his seatbelt. “Fine, but you have to come with me you manipulative dickhead.” He angrily gets out of the car, slamming the door behind him.
“Will do. Merry Christmas.”
"Here," Pepper hands him a comb, not looking up from her folder as she crosses out more names on the PCL roster.
Steve is a bit surprised by that. Sure, maybe Natasha is planning on bringing Tony in as a relief pitcher, but this is their debut exhibition game. It doesn't count towards the actual season, but half of the reason for having these pre-season matchups is to put your best foot forward and show those watching what your team has to offer. The news that Tony had switched teams spread like wildfire once paparazzi started spotting him coming in and out of their stadium. It would be idiotic not to have Tony front and center on that pitcher’s mound at the start of the game, and Natasha does not make idiotic decisions.
Tony and Steve laugh together, tangled up as they roll around in the snow until they’re both dripping wet and shivering. After coming nose to nose, they share a private smile between them before breaking apart, Tony immediately getting nailed in the back of the head by a snowball. He whirls around in fake anger pointing accusationally at the group of giggling children. “Alright, which one of you little buggers threw that?!” He scrambles off of Steve to immediately start chasing them down, a child-like glee on his face.
Tony raises his eyebrows, impressed. “Biochem
Tony thinks to himself as he picks up one of the balls in the bag sitting by the mound.
“You don’t know that,” Steve insists, following after him. “That pitcher had been watching you for the entire inning. You were not going to get away with that steal.”
Steve isn’t naive enough to believe this is the end all be all. Even though it’s the longest Tony’s abstained from alcohol, it’s not like it was something that just went away. Tony would always be an alcoholic until the day he died, even if he didn’t let a drop of booze touch his tongue until then. It was something that was going to stay with him forever, but he didn’t have to let it control him.
"Sorry to hear that," Tony says, and he does sound very sorry. Steve didn't know Tony had a sympathetic bone in his body. "But I bet your mom would still want you to buy that house for yourself. Settle down with a nice wife and your 2.5 kids." Tony dips another sausage in an obscene amount of syrup before shoving it in his mouth. "Regular nuclear family."
Tony almost pinches himself in case he’s dreaming. Steve is standing in his door in plain jeans and a dark hoodie despite it being the middle of Summer. He’s got a hat in one hand, blonde locks messy and flat in some areas from being tucked underneath it. He’s running a hand through them to try and fix them when Tony opens the door, offering that endearing Steve Rogers smile. “Sorry, were you expecting someone else?”
He feels something cold against his lips. He seals them around the opening on faded instinct, taking a deep breath. He hears a hiss, coolness rushing into his throat and opening up the airway. He gasps and splutters on it, coughing before it’s pressed against his lips again. He can still hear Pepper, but she sounds more distant now.
She blinks, gaze flickering between the two of them. She doesn’t look quite as dismayed as the two of them, her eyebrows raised in what seems like curiosity. “My parents… I come out to visit them in Boston during the break and they rent a house out here for a couple weeks. My dad and I like to do a little fishing together when I’m home,” she gestures over a ways to where there’s an older man tying a little fishing boat by the docks. He gives a friendly tip of the hat to them before going back to his business, Tony just noticing the tackle box tucked under one of Carol’s arms. She looks imploringly to Tony, an awkward smile on her face. “What are you doing out here?”
"It was alright," Steve answers, sitting down in the alcove with her. The bay window ran halfway up to the ceiling, providing a view of the stars appearing in the darkening sky. "Wow, I can't remember the last time I could see the stars this well."
When he returns to the living room, steaming mugs in hand, Tony is sitting up and luckily not covered in his own vomit. Steve sits down next to him and can barely set the cups on his table before Tony is straddling his lap and pressing him back into the couch. They trade languid kisses, Steve leaning back and letting Tony lick into his mouth, his large hands sliding up under Tony’s shirt to feel the warmth of his bare skin. Tony is the first to break away from the kiss, cupping Steve’s face between his hands. He’s still got a bit of icing stuck in his hair from when Natasha had mashed a piece of his own cake into his face, Steve reaching up to pluck it out.
“Danvers here is a lot more hands-on than most owners you’ll know in the league, so expect to see her a lot around the Stadium. I apologize we’re running a little behind schedule this morning, and I’m sure you’ll notice Coach Stark isn’t here just yet. Until he gets here I’m going to have you all go ahead and start warming up. Get some stretches in, go around the diamond for a lap or two if you need it—”
It didn’t take too long for Tony to return to his old habits, Steve just starting to crest the stage of
Janet doesn’t let him stray too far from the gate, allowing Tony enough breathing room to get a coffee from one kiosk and add two shots of bourbon to it from a nearby bar. The cheap paper cup is drained by the time they board, Tony settling in next to Janet with Steve and Thor sitting behind them. He feels a bit like the class clown who gets stuck sitting at the front of the bus with the teacher on a field trip, but he actually doesn’t mind Janet all that much. Their families run in the same circles, the Van Dyne’s contracted by both the Major and Minor League’s for uniform design and other branding opportunities. Janet herself is the reason for the Avengers’ new uniform design that came about a few seasons ago, updating their color scheme to a sleek gunmetal and white with subtle accents of crimson. She sketches absentmindedly on a pad she brought, Tony occasionally taking a peek whenever his eyes stray from his light reading on thermonuclear astrophysics.
Steve doesn't expect to see Tony at practice come Tuesday, but as usual, he exceeds expectation.
Tony can’t bear to look at him any longer. He turns away as Steve is dragged out, the door slamming shut behind him. His heart is thudding painfully against his chest, the aching in his ribcage no longer imaginary. He tries to banish the look on Steve’s face out of his mind, but his masochistic brain keeps replaying that moment of rejection over and over again. He shuffles over to the bedside table and immediately takes double the dose of his pain medication. His eyes slide over to the fridge.
“Nothing,” Steve lies pointlessly, still grinning at him. “I love you.”
With Pepper’s assistance, Tony and Steve hunt for apartments around the D.C. area. Tony wants to just throw a dart and settle wherever it lands, but Steve insists he actually try to

teammate.”
“Then I’ll see you at two,” Steve responds, catching the brief grin on Bucky’s face in the dark.
“Tony,” Steve calls out for him, grabbing him by the sleeve. He doesn’t have the kind of stamina to last the whole game so Natasha plans on subbing him in as short stop when they need his defensive skills most.
All it takes are some corny lines for the waitress’ affections to shift back to her first object of desire. “I’ll be right back to satisfy your tastes then.”
The strength of the hug from such a small woman always surprises him. “I almost didn’t. Finished up with things a bit early and thought I’d try and stop by to see everybody.”
Tony’s heart is racing now, his breaths shortening. He fights through it, no longer shying away from the confrontation but looking headlong into it, his stare hard and unwavering. “You think you saved me. Made my life
She keeps staring out the window, but Steve can see her smiling. “You know enough, then.”
Knowing he has to do something before Steve will let him go, Tony sighs and stares down at the grave markers. “Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. I know there’s no afterlife or whatever, and that you guys are now just a couple of corpses buried six feet underground, but I guess if I was
Tony shoots him a glare before apologizing to the nurse who just offers an understanding smile and finishes tending to his IV.
Steve looks at her worriedly. "Is that happening?"
The next hour of the night passes by exactly as expected. Everyone is offering to buy Bucky and Steve beers as they’re the only new recruits this season, and who are these two to turn them down? Steve takes his drinks a lot slower than his friend, keeping in mind what a struggle the stairs at their apartment are going to be whenever they get back tonight.
you say no, then I really have no choice,” she shrugs. “You’re too smart for me to be anything but transparent with you. You know you have all the pull here. I suppose I could just tell you if you don’t take Pierce’s offer then I drop your contract as well and leave you without a team to play on for the next season.”
And just like that, Steve glosses right over Tony falling asleep next to him last night. Granted, it wasn’t like they had been spooned together; Tony doubts they had even touched last night. He doesn’t really have any concerns with what happened himself, most of his worries centered around Steve making assumptions about his intentions. “I think I’ll pass,” he says eventually.
Vision demonstrates his practice swing, holding out his arms to Tony in a faux bow. "Satisfied?"
him there, knowing how unconvincing that would sound.
“Get out of here, Steve,” Bucky sighs from his bed later that night, an hour or two after Steve had already thought he fell asleep. He looks up from the sketch pad he’s doodling in, catching the vague outline of Bucky’s profile in the light of the lamp. “Treat yourself to a bed for once, you’ve got practice in the morning.”
Steve loves these moments with Bucky—staying after their games with the other neighborhood kids just to toss the ball around was almost more fun than playing the actual match.
. He’s selfish, reckless, stubborn, doesn’t play well with others—”
“See?” Maria’s looking to her husband.“I knew it had to have been the Irons. And you know, I never really liked that Stane. He’s been
ahead of the Irons.
“Have you been back here since the funeral?”
He wakes up a few hours later with the comforter damp underneath him. The cottage is warm, Steve most likely turning up the heat to protect Tony from pneumonia. The master bedroom door is open, the thick smell of maple and sausage filtering in from the kitchen. He dresses himself in a comfortable, worn-in pair of light wash jeans and a cream sweater, pulling on some woolen socks before letting his growling stomach lead the way.
Steve takes a deep breath and looks back to the dugout where Bucky's sitting. His best friend gives him a single nod that Steve returns before readying his stance. It's still the first inning, but just because this isn't a pivotal moment in one of the later innings doesn't mean Steve can't set a bar that will keep the team optimistic moving forward.
She stares at him for a few more seconds before shrugging and walking over to the couple’s table to get them a refill on their pitcher. Tony glances out of the corner of his eye as he sips on his cheap whiskey. The bearded men are staring at him now, muttering something back and forth to each other. He can't tell what they’re saying, but the pinched expressions on their faces can’t mean it’s anything good. So he won’t be asking
Steve retreats to the living room, pulling the curtains apart by a few inches to let some light into the apartment. He tries Bucky’s cell first, knowing that if the phone lines are affected in the city, they might not be faring well upstate either.
There are huge framed posters on the walls of all the greats, each lit up from a backlight, just like posters at the movie theater. Ruth, Robinson, Cobbs, Mays, “Stan the Man” Musial, Bonds… Lesser known names, too: Heilmann, Cochrane, Hubbell, and even—
"Her,
“Cat got your tongue?” Tony asks with a saccharine tilt of his head, oozing with impertinence.
He shakes his head. “I missed enough of the exhibition games, I don’t want to miss actual league play.” The kitchen doors swing open, Miss Sun and an additional waiter bringing out their plates of fried rice, crab rangoons, dumplings, and sweet and sour chicken. It’s all laid out in front of them, Miss Sun giving Tony a gentle, fond pinch on the cheek before wishing them a good meal. “Besides,” he continues. “This is the season we’re going to go all the way to the Championship to crush the Irons.” He stabs his chopsticks straight through a wanton to emphasize his point, rattling the porcelain dishes on the table. He pops it into his mouth, grinning around his cheekful of cream cheese and fried dough. “And the Avengers are gonna need their star pitcher to do it.”
Tony’s dark eyes flit up to him, his mouth screwing up to one side as he considers his answer. His fingers are restless, still tapping against the tea cup. “I didn’t cry at the funeral.”
“Relax, Cap, I’m just going to swap out your belt,” Tony scoffs. “I’m not some queer trying to have a go. You’d be so lucky.”
“Sorry that I don’t make it a habit to see movies that came out a
“Sit down,” Hill commands harshly, giving him another push towards the living room. She’s definitely got more of a spine out of the two of them, but she’s usually not this brash. Confused, he sits down in an armchair, staring at both of them in confusion. She pulls a folder out of her messenger bag and tosses it down onto the coffee table, the cover flapping open. “Care to explain?”
Tony stands in the hallway wearing a faded Pepsi-Cola t-shirt and jeans with a rip in the knee. "You're overdressed." He observes blankly.
“Fuck,” he sighs, eventually dragging himself into a sitting position. He really should be used to these kind of hangovers by now, but drinking as much as he did after traveling usually sets him off kilter a bit. He blinks the blurriness from his vision, realizing Steve is holding out a tall glass filled with a familiar red concoction complete with a celery stalk garnish. “You ordered this from room service?” Tony asks in a pleasant sort of surprise, immediately taking the cool glass from him and chugging down half the contents.
As much as he tries to ignore it, he knows Steve can smell something in the air. They’ve been practically living together during the last couple of months since their hectic game schedule came to an end, their belongings coalescing at each other’s apartments, though they tend to spend more time at Steve’s. It’s a little less visible to outside attentions, the neighbors not quite as privy to gossip. Tony hasn’t slept in his own bed alone in weeks, but after Janet’s meeting he keeps finding excuses to hole himself in the workshop and dodge Steve’s calls just so he can keep his thoughts away from his career.
“Oh my god. This is so bad. I can’t watch, but I also can’t look away,” Quill covers his face with his hands, peeking between his fingers. “It’s like seeing a car crash on the side of the freeway.”
Steve takes another step back. "I wouldn't use that language, but this doesn't change anything, Tony. You don't have to avoid me or skip games and practice, or worry that anyone's going to find out. I won't tell anyone, I promise."
No one is sitting as the second out is called and the next Clippers player steps up, a single player on third base, already in position to high tail it for home plate. The batter hits the ball into the outfield and the entire team is on their feet as they watch the ball come hurtling back down towards the ground before being caught snugly in the fielder’s glove.
“Steve, what are you doing?” His eyes widen and his body tenses with alarm as Steve brings a hand up to cup his face. Tony’s hands curl to fists against his chest, clutching the fabric of his jersey and warring against whether he wants to pull him closer or keep him at bay.
“I’ve been up since four,” he answers noncommittally, chewing on the end of his pencil for a moment.
“I told you a thousand times, Erskine, I’m fine.”
“You seem to be walking a little funny today, you and the other deviants have a little too much fun last night?”
He still gets dinner occasionally with Natasha or Janet, sometimes both of them at once, and even though he’s friends with both ladies, it still feels a little professional between them, most of their conversation getting dominated by Avengers business.
It’s a cryptic answer, one Steve isn’t expecting. “That can be normal,” he hedges. “Is there any reason you didn’t go to the memorial service?”
"I want to start with, of course, our incredible and fearless Captain Bradley—" Peggy allows the applause to break out again, smiling at their captain who's sitting in a nearby booth, accepting pats on the back. "As you’ve all probably heard by now, Isaiah will be retiring after next season—" Awws and boos erupt from the crowd. "—And even though we didn't make it to the World Series this season, we still finished at the top of the division and did much better than we have in years. Isaiah, you've led this team and raised them up by leaps and bounds and we all thank you for the years you've given as both a player and a captain," Peggy then signals for Isaiah to stand. He shakes his head as everyone starts banging on the tables, starting a steady chant of
feel good,” he purrs before leaning forward and sealing his lips around the head of his cock.
His head bobs fiercely. “Yes, Mr. Stark! I won’t let you down!” He almost drops his glove as he fumbles it out of his locker and quickly runs out to the tunnel, Natasha’s voice already echoing down towards the locker room.
Tony winces. His most positive coaching experiences thus far have both come from women, but it’s not like the bigoted fans were going to recognize that anytime soon. No matter how intelligent, strong, charismatic, and successful both Carol and Natasha are, they have to work ten times as hard to be recognized than any of the male coaches in the leagues.
An addition onto the back end of the house is the studio, both of them putting in the design work to make it the perfect space to suit both their needs. Plenty of natural lighting, shelving and storage for all of Tony’s tinkering and Steve’s painting materials. There are easels and canvases, rolling work benches and computers, paintbrushes mingling with screwdrivers. They’ve only had one or two accidental mix-ups between mugs holding Steve’s paint water and Tony’s coffee, but other than that things usually run smoothly whether they’re working at the same time or not.
Tony’s mouth goes dry. “But—”
, and this just doesn’t feel sufficient. He spins Tony around and presses him up against the wall, Tony letting out a slight hiss as his skin reacts to the cool tile. He can feel the goose flesh rising up on his arms and chest as he braces himself against the wall, Steve taking his hardness in hand to line up with Tony’s entrance. He wants to tease him at first, expecting a little resistance as he presses just the head of his cock inside of him, but he slides right inside by an inch, and he can tell it’s not just the slight added lubrication of the water.
in front of Annie!”
“Well, I guess I don’t know the logistics of it all,” Steve admits. “Just trying to see the silver lining here. Did Peggy mention any kind of clause that says the contract stays in place even if there's an injury? I mean, they’re still paying for the treatment and the surgery since it happened before season’s end, so maybe you’re still--” Steve realizes he’s alone, turning around to see Bucky had stopped about fifteen paces ago.
want to see you play for a major league team again. And all your friends do too. And, most of all, I think
Tony kicks Steve playfully under the table, his mood lifted significantly. “Fuck off.”
Steve follows about half the team onto the bus, scanning over the seats. Tony is sitting towards the back in a row by himself, sweatshirt hood pulled up over his head resting against the window. There isn’t much conversation going on in the bus, most of the players continuing the nap they had taken on the plane back to the East Coast. Steve makes his way down the aisle, tossing his bag in the empty row parallel to Tony before he plops down in the seat next to him.
They kiss in the grass, unencumbered by their reputation and their lives back in their respective cities as the sun creeps over the horizon, the fog retreating as it raises higher in the sky.
inhuman.
Janet’s office is at the end of the hallway. He can see some figures shifting around inside through the frosted pane of glass on the window along with the sound of multiple muffled voices as he approaches. Strange. He’s under this impression this is supposed to be a one-on-one. He hesitates outside of the door for a moment to try and see if he can pick out the voices. There are definitely a couple of male tones in there, and another female who’s not Janet, but doesn’t quite sound like Natasha either. He decides to just find out rather than ponder, and opens the door without preamble.
“If you feel up to it,” the doctor answers with a dry smile. He likes her already.
“Steve, c’mon!” He hears Bucky shout. “Where are you going?”
"Stark, what are you doing?!" the second baseman yells, but Tony can hardly hear it. He keeps his eye on the ball and in his periphery he can see the center fielder slow to a stop, knowing he isn't close enough. Tony stretches his arm out and catches the ball, clutching it in his glove before rolling to the ground to slow his momentum. He pops back up, holding the ball up in his glove victoriously. Cheering erupts, and out is called, and he can't wipe the grin off his face as he sees Rogers' surprise that he had dared to go after the ball.
Possible future recruits then?
“Yeah. He was devastated that he just barely missed you. I think he was really looking for a mentor,” Steve laughs. “He never shuts up about you, and I guess Nat let it slip to him that we were pretty close. I’ve got about an entire notebook of questions he wants to ask you one day that I told him I’d pass along.”
“Maybe you like pitching so much because you prefer to
, remember to take care of yourself.”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says before he can hang up. “Things are going to get better, okay? They will.”
“Tony?” He whispers down the hallway, poking his head into another few rooms. He reaches for a doorknob when it suddenly swings away for him, an arm shooting out and seizing him by the tie to drag him into the room.
“Oh, you know Steve, always showing up late,” Tony answers flippantly, distracted as he looks out onto the field to where Irons players are warming up and conversing in small pockets. He spots some familiar faces, but there are plenty of new ones as well. He can see the new coach, Killian, standing off to the side talking to the umpire. He looks like a smarmy prick, so he’s probably a great replacement for the helm of the Irons.
Obadiah ruffles the top of his hair, eyes twinkling. “Looks good on you kid, as much as I hate to admit it. You look strong. Healthy. You’re playing better too. I mean, you’ve always been amazing, but Romanoff must be doing something right if she’s been able to keep you in line this long.”
Steve does just that, almost bumping into Tony when he stops right in front of a set of double doors.
Steve finally obliges, placing one hand on the back of Tony’s head as he leans away from him and begins to pump his hips in earnest. The sound of wet skin slapping against wet skin is amplified in the room, the sounds of their misconduct echoing around them and making it all the more thrilling. Tony’s hands scrabble against the slick wall as Steve fucks him from behind, slowly sliding until he’s practically bent at a ninety-degree angle, breathy moans punched out of him with every thrust. Steve’s grip on his hair tightens, finally giving in to what Tony craves. He yanks his head back, earning a delightful sound tearing its way from Tony’s throat as he quickens his pace, letting all his pent-up frustration from the day out.
They ride like that all the way into Malibu, Steve busying himself with looking around at the California scenery. If Tony doesn’t want to hold conversation, that’s perfectly fine with him. Honestly, with the amount of vehement hatred that’s normally aimed his way, Steve prefers Tony’s CDs of screeching guitars and powerful vocals (though he did wish the volume was turned down a couple of notches). After about an hour of driving, Tony pulls off the highway and onto a more isolated two-way street winding into the mountains. They get further and further away from the city, Tony turning down the classic rock as they roll up to a massive electronic gate. Steve can hear the ocean's waves from here as Tony punches in the code to let them in.
He narrowly avoids the pillow that Steve chucks at his head. “I was only three when this came out, so shut it. Besides, everyone should see
It’s quick and rushed, but no less pleasurable because of it. Their circumstance is only fuel for their passion, Steve letting Tony yank his head back by his hair so he can hear those satisfying sounds freely pouring out of his mouth. Tony fucks him at a relentless pace, never once faltering in his rhythm or dragging things out. Steve is a goner as soon as Tony reaches around to pull him off. He knows all the right ways to bring him to climax, rubbing his thumb along his head and slit, stroking and twisting his shaft in the optimal motions that has Steve seeing stars behind his eyes. Coupled with the sensation of Tony penetrating him from behind, pulling out less and less until he’s practically just
,” she warns, shoving him away. “Don’t make me take it back.”
It’s just as electric as he remembers from the night before, but now with them both sober, everything is crisp and clear. A small sigh escapes Tony’s lips and Steve takes it as invitation to slide his tongue into his mouth, stroking his thumb gently across Tony’s cheekbone. Tony is the first to break the kiss, his lips still shiny and pink as he pulls back to look at him. “What was that for?”
"All right everybody, quiet down and fall in!" Steve hears the call of their manager from the locker room. He shuts off his water, not realizing he had been the last one in the showers while lost in thought. He grabs a towel and wraps it around his waist before walking into the locker room, all his teammates in various state of undress. Even in front of a female manager, everyone is comfortable. Sure, there are still people on the team who liked to whisper about getting a chance to get more intimate with Peggy, and Steve can’t even blame them. He would never be as crude as some of the other players; He respects Peggy Carter far too much to objectify her like that. He looks up to her as a woman doing so well for herself in a male-dominated sport, but more than that he just respects her as a person. The Stars were in much worse shape before she came along, and now that she has been at the helm for the past few years, things are finally starting to look up.
Tony finally pulls off of Steve with a slight pop of suction, staring up at him with the tip of his cock still resting against his swollen lower lip. “What am I?” He asks innocently, pressing the tip of one water-slicked finger inside of him.
Just a couple QUICK THANGS to address. I've gotten some questions about continuing this universe and possibly writing some "deleted scenes". When I originally planned this fic, I knew all the places I wanted time jumps, where I wanted to fill in the blanks later or let the reader do so. Those were purposeful decisions, but at the same time I am totally open to writing more about our boys in this AU (I've grown so attached) and it's like an 80% chance that I already have a couple of oneshots planned. If there's any particular favorite moments or "off screen" events that happened in this fic, please let me know!! I'd be more than happy to write them (if I haven't started already hehe).
, right?”
“Long term damage?” He does a remarkable job at keeping his voice even considering if his hands are done for, then he’s got nothing left. No more baseball, no more building, no piano, nothing.
Steve looks up from the photograph to see Tony only a few inches away from him, sitting beside him with his legs crossed, brown eyes open and earnest. They look too focused, almost unnaturally so. Even Steve is sure his gaze is a little more glossy at this point, and he hardly has anything on Tony as far as inebriation went. He feels his mouth go dry, tongue flickering out to wet his lips. “I didn’t want you to be alone?” He doesn’t mean it to come out as a question, voice sounding thin and unsure.
“That’s so far away! And school is bogue anyway,” Bucky huffs out a sigh. “I can try out for the rookies in two years, and that gives me three more to make a name for myself before I’m old enough to enlist.”
Steve turns a wide-eyed stare at him. “You’ve never seen
Steve doesn’t expect his and Tony’s relationship to change any, even after that disastrous family dinner, but just as he had on that night, Tony surprises him.
“Quit haranguing me, Doc, you told me
“No! I mean— Just with— with men, yes, I am, I guess…” He trails off awkwardly, wondering if he’s ruined this entire thing. Tony’s probably lost count of the amount of people he’s slept with while Steve could count them on one hand— Honestly, a couple of fingers.
. So, what, I’m not able to do anything on my own so I should just keep letting everyone else breed and mold me to be their little fucking puppet? To fulfill some dream that was never even mine just so others can sleep at night thinking they
Steve washes the same part of his back for the next five minutes, rubbing his neck underneath the hot water to soothe his aching muscles. Within the next ten minutes, the last of the players depart from the showers, giving cursory farewells to Steve and Tony on their way out. Steve doesn’t move from his stall, listening for silence in the other room. The showers are offset from the main locker room by a short hallway as the only separation. He’s able to hear the echoing sounds of conversation as the last of their teammates exit, hearing the loud exit door of the stadium open and clang shut. Then, there’s silence aside from the rushing water.
It’s a simple but spacious two-story house-on-a-hill a little ways outside of New York’s Capital, complete with a huge yard and a white picket fence. The outside is juxtaposed of white brick and mixed cobblestone, weathered naturally to not look
“You’ll try out too once you’re fifteen,” Bucky assures, throwing an arm around Steve’s bony shoulders.
Steve glances back at Tony who gives him a shrug. “Sure, why not?” Steve straightens up and lets the little girl seize him by the sleeve and start dragging him towards the rest of her friends, little bobbles bouncing back and forth on her head as she hurries along.
"Aunt Peg!" he hears from behind him. Tony Stark shoots him a look of disgust as he brushes past him to get to Peggy, the glare immediately replaced with a dazzling smile for the woman. He gives her a tight hug and a kiss on each cheek. "There she is, the most valuable woman in the MLB!"
Steve glances over his shoulder again and signals for Tony to wait, closing the blinds completely before he crawls into bed next to him, gently helping scoot him over without disrupting him too much. Tony feels his body protest with the movement, gritting his teeth to hide it. He just wants to be with Steve, he doesn’t care about the pain.
The most buzz around the team is centered around Tony Stark and his impressive skills shown during this pre-season, everyone anxious to see when he would grace the pitcher’s mound with his presence. Natasha and Janet sit off to the side, both of them doing uncanny impressions of a pair of cats who just chowed down on a couple of canaries. Steve glances around at the group as they all listen in, wondering if anyone is going to show any kind of resentment towards the outsider of the team for garnering all of the attention. Strange is the only one who looks outwardly peeved, but Steve also thinks that’s just his face.
. For a few years there, I thought you did too. I’ve made some pretty bad decisions in my life, but being with you has been the worst. It ruined my fucking life, Steve.”
“The Diamondbacks lost two more pitchers this season,” Thor hints, leaning across the table with his arms outstretched. “Come out to Arizona, Tony! I miss playing baseball alongside you. You’re too young to give up yet.”
With an excellent swing on Steve’s part, he earns a double and Thor is driven home. A wave of relief washes over everyone on the Avengers’ side as they continue to strengthen the lead. 14-16. Still too close for comfort, but better than before. If they can get one more run, then Tony will take a moment to breathe again.
“Good to know Rezzo hasn’t torn you to pieces yet,” The man says with a grin, patting Tony on the back.
Tony immediately groans and shoves Steve away from him, practically flinging himself over the back of the couch to escape. “
Just as he thought. Outside of the strike zone. Steve looks up at the clock, watching the time tick on as he readied for the next pitch. No more fooling around, now.
The music swells and all the guests get to their feet, turning to the entryway of the greenhouse. Bucky steps into the center of the aisle in his grey suit, flashing one last, private smile to Steve before holding his arm out.
Maria just laughs at the barb, "Says the boy who hijacked our private jet last year to spend his Thanksgiving in Cabo when you two got in an argument over which resort served the best turkey."
” He bows forward slightly, catching himself against the wall as Tony’s other hand snakes back between his cheeks and a finger prods at his entrance.
should be with the rest of the team right now.”
The new angle is sinfully fulfilling, Steve burying his face in Tony’s neck as he starts to lose more of his self-control. His hips jackhammer up into Tony who claws at his back and very freely vocalizes his pleasure, a slew of curses falling from his lips in a desperate, aching cry for more.
like it here. A lot. I like this team.”
Tony scoffs, wiping some nonexistent dirt off his nose. “I pitch circles around everyone’s batting lineup,” he counters, bumping his shoulder into Steve’s before grabbing his glove. He jumps to his feet and starts stretching his arms out in front of him as he heads out onto the field, but Steve can still see the line creasing between his brows.
Peggy had gone over with Steve earlier that day the best way to participate in this press event. He's the only one who hasn't done a junket like this before, even Bucky having attended this same panel last year. They all contribute to answering the questions, Steve trying to jump in at a good time with an original thought that the reporters can scribble down on their note pads. His one fear going into this was that he would do nothing but echo the other player's sentiments, sounding like a parrot in front of all these people. He's definitely speaking the least amount out of everyone at the table, but he hopes he at least doesn't look like he's about to pass out.
“How does anybody cheat at Go Fish?” Natasha snorts, laying down another set of cards.
He can tell Steve is taken by surprise by it all, but quickly catches on to what Tony had done. They only have a few seconds, but Tony pours as much love and passion as he can into those stolen moments in the darkness. He slides his hands into Steve’s hair, feeling the man’s tongue slide against his own. He wants to let himself get lost in the moment, to jump up into Steve’s arms and be swung around and forget that in a few short weeks he’ll be leaving for an undetermined amount of time. He won’t get to come home to this embrace every day, or wake up to this smell, or feel these lips against his own.
“Why?”
“You know weddings make me horny,” Tony says, hands immediately searching along the planes of Steve’s exposed chest before dropping down to rub the palm of his hand over his crotch.
“You watch a lot of Triple-A baseball?” He asks dryly.
jealous that he won’t get the opportunity to bat this game.
“Looks like your right will have to do for the near future, then,” she says sympathetically.
Tony's gaze flickers and he clears his throat as he pulls the toothbrush out of his mouth. "Um, the left window in that room... It sticks." He shoves the toothbrush back into his mouth. "Thought you should know."
The high pitched ring in his ears gets progressively louder before it suddenly starts to fade, the sounds around him coming back into focus fuzzily, like his brain is rotating a dial back and forth trying to find the right frequency.
The Stars hit the showers, bantering with each other, complaining about bullshit calls, and talking about earlier games of the season. As Steve rinses off the sweat and dirt, he doesn’t know how he feels about his first season as a major ball player. He has gotten plenty of acknowledgement and his life is changing rapidly. The Stars have done better this season than they had in the past seven years, the last time they had made the championships. Steve knew that with their current team, the Stars were projected to actually make it next year, something Steve will hope for. This is his dream team, a group of players he had followed ever since he was a kid, going to the games and collecting his favorite cards of all the famous Brooklyn players.
The banter feels like welcome amnesty, Steve almost having forgotten Tony’s bright and youthful rasp with all of the grief surrounding the last couple of weeks. He’s still wearing the grey and blue Avengers track pants but the jacket has migrated to being tied around his waist, a simple white t-shirt still clinging to his torso.
Steve smiles and presses a kiss to the nape of Tony’s neck. “I look forward to it. You can start tomorrow.”
,” she says, raising her eyebrows pointedly at him.
“Woof, let’s turn down the volume until I’ve had my morning coffee, Point Break,” Tony pats the man on one huge bicep, sinking down into the seat next to his teammate. Steve takes his seat in front of them, Janet hopping back into shotgun. As soon as they’re settled, the car is pulling onto the street, weaving between the hectic traffic to get them to the airport as quickly as possible.
Steve reluctantly tries to keep his focus but is distracted from his position as shortstop, eyes constantly flickering over to where Tony is sitting in the dugout. Rhodes is on the field with him, but Bruce has yet to go up and is sitting quietly in the corner with Tony. The two seem to be holding some conversation, but more often than not, Steve finds that Tony’s eyes are trained on the field and sometimes even directly zeroed in on him.
Steve blushes, shaking his head. "I didn't— I just meant so I don't have to come searching for you in the endless marble maze."
Hammer grins cruelly as he saunters back to third, looking relaxed while Steve looks ready to implode if he doesn’t unclench soon. “Hey,” Tony says softly to get his attention, squeezing his arm one more time before dropping it away, conscious of the attention on them and Hammer still watching. He keeps his teeth clenched, lips barely moving so his words are hidden. “Next one’s coming right to you. Be ready.”
The panel of players take turns answering the cookie-cutter questions that they're all used to. How they feel about the season, if there was more pressure after how close they were to reaching this point last season, how rigorous the training was as they fell under a new, stricter coach, how much pressure they felt being this close to win the American League, those kinds of inquiries.
“Strike!”
want to go out and get shit-faced because we have an excuse to, but no one’s going to blame you if you don’t want to come out tonight.”
Tony exhales loudly and walks over to him, gesturing with his hand for Steve to stand. It goes ignored. He rolls his eyes and goes over to the edge of the bed, grabbing Steve’s hand and tugging uselessly. Like he’s capable enough to get Michelangelo’s David out of bed based on strength alone…
Steve stands at the first base, ready as the first of Pittsburg’s lineup takes the plate. He glances across the field, catching his third baseman’s eye. Bucky grins at him, giving a nod.
Steve loops the bandages down to his wrists, taking his time with securely fastening them there. “What does she think not PR-wise?”
Tony hates leaving the stadium in uniform. Steve remembers the disdain on his face as he talked about it one day, making his opinion clear on how he wouldn’t be caught dead walking around in public repping his team like a Boy Scout looking for attention.
“Tony,” he calls out, slowing when he finally can match pace with the kid. “Were you looking to catch a cab down the block?”
Somehow, he’s not surprised to see mostly bare cabinets and a fridge containing very little in the way of actual ingredients to make any sort of meal, but instead an array of takeout containers and pre-prepped meals stacked up in the freezer. Steve sighs and pulls out a plastic container of curry, veggies, and rice, figuring it’s his best bet. He cooks himself two fried eggs, bacon, and toast every morning, so maybe a little change is nice. He eats his breakfast in the kitchen and tries to fiddle through channels on Tony’s radio. A lot of it is just fuzzy static, but he manages to find a few stations occasional reporting updates on the weather. The snow isn’t supposed to stop anytime soon, but will hopefully not dump another few feet on them overnight. They’re expecting it to be clearable within the next couple of days, but for now everyone is told to stay indoors.
“Okay,” Peggy claps. “You boys get changed and head down to the field to get warmed up.” She checks her watch. “I want everyone nice and loose before Coach Hodge puts you all through the ringer. We’re at T-Minus six hours and thirty-seven minutes before first pitch, let’s get a move on.”
Steve’s smile fades with uncertainty, searching Tony’s eyes to figure out if he means that or not. “You… want me to go?”
,” Tony gasps out, entire body jerking forward as Steve’s warm tongue swipes over his asshole. His fingers dig into Tony’s hips hard enough to bruise as he eats him out from behind, tongue prodding at the tight ring of muscle to slowly ease him open. He teases Tony like that for what feels like
“Yeah we did,” Tony grins, winking over at Steve who’s rolling his eyes. “So I heard you’re a damn good pitcher.”
Steve is covering his mouth, Tony able to see the edge of one dimple as he tries to hide a smile away from everyone else. At this time last year, Tony was so unsure of where they stood, or what he was getting himself into. Now, he feels the same way about where their relationship will go from here, but seeing the way Steve looks at him— Like no one else in the room is even there— he’s not so worried anymore.
hot topic. Maybe all the gab about him has rooted somewhere deep in Steve’s subconscious, slowly building up a distaste for his new teammate without him even realizing.
“Alright, my turn,” Tony holds out his hand for the camera, fingers impatiently waving for him to hand it over.
While there’s been the occasional lingering glance or playful slap to the ass in passing while in the locker rooms, Tony’s never been this forward. Steve glances back to the hallway just to make sure there’s no moving shadows or sounds coming from the locker room indicating anyone being around. When he faces forward again, he watches as Tony sinks down to his knees and doesn’t hesitate in taking Steve into his mouth.
"For being a fag?" Tony asks, raising his eyebrows. He's still walking towards Steve like a cat on the prowl.
After one long inhale and exhale, Steve looks back to the reporter. "Honestly, I didn't know people liked me that much," he chuckles, bashfully rubbing the back of his neck. "It's humbling to even hear that I'm a fan favorite to people. I try to keep integrity in the game and do my part to help the team first and foremost. I think people can just relate to the steps I've taken to get where I am today. There's sometimes dirty or corrupt players in the sport; I'm just trying to keep things honest."
To Tony’s surprise, Nick Fury is standing outside of the dugout, staring him down as much as he can with his single eyeball. The rest of the team looks surprised as well, Fury rarely making appearances to them during actual game time. Owners don’t necessarily have to engage that often with a team— they’re more about the numbers than actual human relation. He knows that Fury has multiple other business ventures, including many dealings with Stark Industries. Tony’s actually fairly sure he’s seen the man more times at his father’s events than he has since actually playing for his team.
Steve is speechless, and he’s not sure if there’s a single appropriate reply to what Tony just laid out in front of him. Dove is suddenly a saving grace, finally coming back to take their orders now that most of the tension has dissolved.
A tapping sound jolts Steve out of his reading, his eyes adjusting to the darkness of the room— when did the lights turn off? He looks towards the door where Mandy is standing. She lifts her hand, jingling a hefty set of keys at him. He quickly logs off the computer and lets her lock up. "Sorry, got caught up in my research."
“Can I see him?”
Steve stares at Clint in shock. "What?"
Steve’s hand comes down on Hammer’s shoulder. “Son, just don’t,” he warns condescendingly. “I’m going to suggest that you’ve had too much to drink and need to excuse yourself before you say something you really regret.”
The man locks eyes with him, jaw set in a hard line before he nods. “I’m trusting you, kid.” He taps the lid of his cap before quickly jogging over to the umpire to make the last-minute change.
“Of course,” Steve smiles, stepping forward to brush a bit of confetti off his face. He hopes the action doesn’t look too intimate to their friends, his hand dropping away to keep the gesture nonchalant. “Maybe I got it out of your file in Janet’s office.”
After enough time had passed, the switch was flipped. Steve went from trying to block out anything that could remind him of Tony at all costs to obsessively seeking out info on him.
If Tony thinks some inappropriate language and unconventional scare tactics are going to push Steve away, he’s sorely mistaken. If there’s one thing Steve Rogers isn’t, it’s a pushover. Even if Tony doesn’t want someone to pour his heart out to, he doesn’t want Tony to block him out because of this incident.
"Steve, stop!" Tony shouts, sounding more forceful than ever as he grabs at Steve's arms to try and keep him from walking towards the bedroom. His heels are digging into the carpet as Steve presses on. "I don't know what you think is going on here, but you need to leave
“Ah, Pierce’s team,” Steve takes a sip of water. “So what did you say?”
Tony falls silent as they continue to dance, putting his concentration back into his footwork. Steve expects the conversation to end along with the slow ballad, but even as the music transitions back into something more upbeat and the couples morph into groups of people dancing all together, Tony pulls him close, placing his lips at his ear.
“Thank you for tonight,” Tony says, barely above a whisper. “I… I’ve never… I’ve never had someone do something like that for me.”
“It took him long enough but… yeah, he did. I could tell he was stirred up about someone for a while, but he always avoided giving me any details. We’ve been best friends for a long time, I always know when he fancies someone but… It’s never been this intense. He seemed real sick over it for months before I finally got him to spill.”
“No Bruce?” Tony asks, looking around. He sees the familiar faces of Quill, Shade, Maximoff, and a few others on the team he’s not as close with, but there is no sign of his fellow brainiac on the team.
Natasha sighs deeply. “Steve, don’t waste your breath.”
He stands outside the door for a few moments. There's no sound coming from the room and right before Steve knocks, he thinks better of it and walks back to his own room.
Steve’s arms are shaking in protest as he continues to hold Tony up, the man going completely limp in his arms as he comes down from his orgasm. Steve clutches him closer, intoxicated by Tony’s natural and artificial scents coexisting, the rising steam in the room only further accentuating the smell of sex and evidence of what they’ve done here. He rolls his hips gently inside of Tony as he feels his member twitch through the aftershocks, earning a small whimper as he continues to prod inside of Tony’s sensitive area.
The woman just hums and flashes him an empty smile as she folds her napkin and places it on the table. "I think I'll retire to the library for the night," she says quietly. Howard just grunts and waves for Steve to follow him. As a guest, he’s being split in three separate directions with no idea what’s the proper choice. He’s closest with Tony, who was clearly upset by the conversation but probably doesn’t want to see him. He just met Maria tonight, and while she’s the easiest to get along with in conversation, she’s not exactly happy either right now.
Her voice is calming. A life preserver tossed to him in the middle of a hurricane on the sea. He grasps at it with weak fingers. “Uh… Huh…”
no. Drive, Steve.”
“Okay, I got it— No wait, I changed the input somehow— Okay, never mind, it’s this one.”
“Go fish, Sammy. Steve, any Queens?”
The players all line up, looking around uneasily before falling into a random order. Steve is towards the end of the line, second to last.
Tony continues to glare angrily out the passenger side window, doing his best not to react. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he replies defensively.
Steve laughs. “Be on your best behavior,” He chides, thinking back to Natasha’s joking comment from last night about his friend’s current status.
He’s not a spiteful man. Quite the opposite, really. Steve doesn’t believe in holding grudges, not when you never knew where life would bring you next. From a young age he had learned to be grateful for every opportunity, every blessing he was given or earned. It did no one any good to linger on any kind of negative encounter, not with a world as big as theirs.
all the of-age guests at least get a little tipsy, Steve feels that niggling guilt and worry for his partner. It’s not easy for Tony who had always fallen back on the excuse of his alcoholism developing out of being a “social drinker” to be in an environment like this. When they would go out to bars with friends, he’d get antsy and irritable. Most nights, they'd leave early. The very smell of alcohol used to set Tony on edge.
He can hear a group of voices all talking at once as he comes around the corner, entering the secondary room where players were treated due to any injury in-game.
He does a short lap around the first floor of the house, peeking out the windows to see people arriving and being ushered to the main greenhouse for the ceremony. It’s not an enormous amount of people, but there’s still a significant number of guests in attendance. Steve checks his watch, just a few minutes left until the ball has to get rolling. He makes his way back towards the hallway where the Groomsmen were split off from the rest of the wedding party when he hears creaking steps from behind him.
His point is further accented when another one of the PCL’s players streaks across home plate, brining the score up to 3-8. Many of the heads in their dugout hang in disappointment, but Tony seems to be the only one actively furious over how this game is turning out. Maybe the more seasoned players consider it as “just the All-Star Game” and have no concerns beyond that. It doesn’t hold any real bearing on their individual team’s performance, but this is so much more than some light-hearted, mid-season romp where rival teams within leagues come together as a singular entity.
Tony continues to stare at him like he’s shown up on his doorstep with a second head growing out of his neck. “You couldn’t have done that on the phone?” He asks, mirth in his tone as he fights a smile.
behavior. Pierce had nearly ripped him to shreds in the green room afterwards, Hill and Coulson clearly upset but too shocked to berate him much. Pepper had been the only one on his side through it all, torn between telling Tony she was proud of him but worried for his well-being and timing of the announcement.
It makes him miss Sarah.
It’s another hosting area of sorts, the room twice the size of the parlor downstairs that had been plenty big in itself. Couches and high-backed chairs of brown leather were placed around the room, a small bar in one corner, two billiards tables, and even a dart board in the room for recreational purposes. The lights are dim, Howard sliding a few switches on the wall by the door to bring them up.
here.”
Bucky sighs deeply and mutters something under his breath that suspiciously sounds like, ‘
For once, Tony goes quiet and lets her talk. Of course he’s aware of all the behind-the-scenes dealings that go on; He’s been around it since he was a kid listening in on his dad’s meetings and phone calls. As much as the leagues try and market baseball as this beloved sport where people from all over the country can come together and celebrate wholesome, family entertainment, at the end of the day, it all comes down to money and corruption. All the heart in the world won’t keep a team afloat if they don’t have the revenue to back it up.
Peter’s fingers dig into the ratty holes in his jeans, picking at the loose denim strands absently. “I-I’m okay. Nowhere near as good as you, sir.”
“I’m actually going upstate too. Visiting Bucky.”
Steve slips from group to group, not staying in any one place for too long. Bucky is over at the pool table, showing who Steve assumes is some player's sister "proper form". Bucky happens to glance up as Steve stares, throwing his friend a wink as he tightens his arm around the girl’s shoulders. Classic Bucky.
the actual reason,” Tony huffs in annoyance.
“Um, well, it’s a series of twelve poems, so they’re all about something a little bit different. One of them is actually known for being the first ever documented myth about werewolves.”
Steve clinks his glass with everyone within an arm’s reach, grinning so hard that he doesn’t even care when he feels some of the liquid slosh out onto his hand. He’s so proud in that moment and when he turns to his best friend, he swears he can see tears glistening in Bucky’s eyes.
Steve smiles politely through the conversation, not knowing how to contribute otherwise. He can’t exactly picture an MIT student being athletic enough to make it in the big leagues. And Howard thinks his son would want to play professionally after that level of education? Steve's head spins just thinking about the years of schooling one would have to go through to achieve all that. The MLB isn't exactly looking to recruit people of Steve's age or older with no prior minor league experience.
“Just for a bit,” Steve laments, letting Tony curl into his side the best he can. “Don’t want someone to find us like this.”
“That’s
smiles at him, possibly for the first time ever. "CSX2000," he says proudly, turning the key in the ignition. The sound of the motor roaring to life is orchestral. "One of the few original models still around. I've pretty much gutted and enhanced the engine, but everything else is original, even the upholstery."
into the mix as well. Might give all the whiny male fans validation to calling me a dyke and god knows what else whenever our team loses and it’s suddenly all my fault.”
His late start to the morning means he’s the last person to make it to Tony’s private box, the room already filled with familiar faces of close friends. “Steve!” Comes the disjointed cheer from the room as he slips inside, giving a little wave to everyone. Clint, Thor, and Rhodey are all getting food from the buffet selection, Pepper is grabbing a couple of beers from the mini bar for herself, Bruce, and Carol. He can see Nat and Buck’s backs from where they’re standing on the outside balcony along with both Carol and Clint’s wives and children, the kids clearly arguing over who gets to sit where amongst the three rows of seating once the game starts.
"Everything and more," Steve responds immediately. "Ever since we started in the Rookies, all we wanted was to stay local and play for Brooklyn. This season has been absolutely incredible for us."
“You would know better than I would,” Steve answers honestly.
he thinks fondly. “Then play for a team in New York,” Steve proposes the obvious solution. “You have your options. You could play for the Stars.”
“We don’t know anything other than they were overseas for business and it appears to be some sort of car accident. Obviously Tony will need some time to grieve so you may not be seeing him for a while. We should all do our best to be supportive to him, whenever he’s ready. That's all,” she climbs down from the chair and quickly leaves the room without another word.
