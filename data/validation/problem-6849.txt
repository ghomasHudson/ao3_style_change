With the three of them strapped up to BARF Tony could do his thing without having to worry so much about taking in details of their changing surroundings. When it came to Barnes, the emotions from Steve and Natasha ran too deep to take chances on missing details that could help them find him all the sooner.
Extremis, recognizing them as foreign bodies, destroyed them almost as fast as they could create them so if this was to be a viable long term solution, the bots would need to be able to self duplicate.
He’d stared at Tony’s picture frozen picture on the computer SHIELD had given him. Against Coulson’s advice he’d asked for Clint’s help using Google in order to look Tony up. Steve didn’t like to think of himself as a judgmental person, but he could see why Coulson had tried to warn him off it.
brains.” She insisted. “Gata. They’re so resilient. My uncle, he was experimented on. The humans nearly broke him.”
They're at the docks because Tony wants to know more about trade and there is no place for that like the docks where the fishermen hawk their prized catches and merchants come to collect their goods.
Tony made a face at that and rolled his eyes for Luke’s benefit because somebody other than Tony should realize that his A.I. was the biggest worry wort in existence.
"I just built the wings Airman, the work was all you."  Tony dismissed the praise smoothly, and Wilson seemed surprised by the humbleness of Tony's reply but Steve wasn't.
Ivan wanted to know what that was even though he wasn’t sure what knowing would change. It wouldn’t free him. Only the words could do that, and the only people who knew them were those who would use them against him... and the girl. She was another puzzel.
“Be that as it may, an uneven fight is an uneven fight and that’s not how we do things around here.” Steve insisted. “We’ll give you Thor. Tony, repulsors on their lowest setting and I won’t use the shield to-”
Tony snickered around his spoonful of stew. Luke’s shit eating streak was kind of amusing, he’d give the guy that. And weird tribal customs or not, if he wanted to bring Tony offerings that tasted this good he could court him till it went out of style. Which it had, probably not long after the invasion of Rome.
"I wouldn't say that. Are you?" She murmured in reply, sipping daintily at her glass of white wine and the teasing grin slipped off of his face.
Steve had promised to be just on the other side of the glass and Tony had made some joke about using his time better to go and get cheeseburgers, because he was sure to be starving when he came through and Steve had smiled, even though it was hard to find anything really funny.
It was Ivan, the patriot, who had looked after her and eventually led her to the red queen and then to the white, who was supposed to put ice in her heart.
“If I may interrupt?” Pepper interjected as she came sweeping in on her towering heels, halting Thor who was gearing up to reply.
“Sure thing." Sam agreed amiably, his mouth forming into a sly smirk. Steve couldn't help the slight thrill he felt at the warm weight of Tony’s arm in his, but he was perplexed by it. Thus far Tony had kept their PDA at these formal functions to a minimal.
Howard had hated Stone almost as much as the Stone had hated him, but both were businessmen and held to the golden rule of keeping the enemy close.
And though he was nervous for her she looked so very sure of herself hand in hand with her chosen mate, regal and proud as and Princess.
They’d been shifting through that footage for the last half hour. So far what they knew didn’t tell them much but what it did tell them begged a thousand more questions.
Little did she know that Tony was busy introducing himself to a gorgeous lady going by the name of Dagger. Bruce and Natasha must have felt something because Natasha frowned at him and Tony felt a flutter of worry that was distinctly Bruce flavored.
It was dark and shadowy in the hallways, the only light available from the emergency reds that had turned on with the alarm.  Which was still blaring loud enough to almost drown out the sound of gun fire and shouting coming from the floor below. Tony flew toward the commotion, anxious with every scream that floated up through the floor that they'd be too late to prevent someone from dying.
As one of his first and oldest friends Rhodey knows more than just about anybody else what it was like to grow up with Howard Stark for a master, but he doesn’t know the extent of it. Because Tony has never been able to bring himself to fully share it all. It’s a very private pain.
Tony leapt a literal foot in the air at the soft sound of the unexpected voice, whipping around to face the threat even as he positioned himself protectively over Natasha, tail arched and teeth bared.
"Are there any questions?" Helen prompted and Tony wasn't all that surprised when Steve, who had watched the presentation with intense focus and pursed lips throughout, was the first to speak up.
The warnings are all the same as are the potential pairings.  Please see the end for additional notes.
"Oh I could be very good for you,” Tony purred in response, because he wasn't a novice over here and two could play at that game. And then with a dismissive click of his tongue he went on. “But, here's another freebie, I’m not all that patient. Waiting around has never really been my style. So I’m going to dig up all your secrets and figure out how to beat your tech by Tuesday.”
There’s General Ross who sees what his daughter sees and wants to own it. He buys them from the college and it feels like a dream come true. Instead of mopping the floors, now they sit in a back row earning a certificate.
All those myths he’d heard as a kit, about how perfect everything had been once upon a time when Gata could bond with one another and live out their days in perfect bliss with their Pride were just wishful thinking if not utter bullshit.
With Howard Stark for a bio daddy that wasn’t exactly out of the realm of possibility either, though what the guy would have been doing all these years while Tony had been kicking ass and taking names he had no idea.
Tony’s eyes widened suddenly, another realization sinking in. Guy knew his name. Catman released an exasperated sounding sigh.
He’d never been able to let-go like that before, and it had felt every bit as amazing as he’d always wondered if it would feel. He simply didn’t want to regret it. He wanted sixty more years of it and two sets of gorgeous blue eyes across from him at the breakfast table, one of them belonging to a stubborn little boy who tried to make a little girl eat sand for teasing him one minute and curled around her like a protective shield the next when their parents were away and unsure whether to return.
“Erratic juvenile behavior is my MO. Did no one give you a briefing? I heard there was a whole report drawn up.” Tony blinked innocently at the tom and somewhere behind them Bruce broke out in a suspicious cough.
"Tony,” Steve tried to interject gently. Though he reached for Tony’s arm he was clearly torn between which of them to comfort, and Tony pinned him with a quelling stare.
He knew he was right when she sagged again, the strength seemingly gone from her, and her skin felt like ice pressed against his. It didn't help that that ominous humming in his  ears had quieted.
“You were gone again.” She murmurs quietly, mindful of the communication equipment that could be recording them for their masters. The soldier is glad for her discretion. She and Pietro have such potential. Killing them when he’s working so hard to keep them would be a waste.
“Good.” Steve nodded, like it had been his idea or something and pinned that intense ‘Captain America is depending on you’ expression of his on Tony that always made him feel like he was five again and in danger of disappointing his father. “Any luck locating where they might be working?”
It was a sentiment Tony couldn't really find too much of an argument for, especially when it was revealed that the African nation still had free gata and they weren't just servants of the royal house as the history books would lead one to believe. The Panther Pride was the royal house.
"Like hell." Tony was cursing. "What the fuck do you want Ty? If you're trying to breed me again it's too late. I don't know what daddy told you but my heat already passed."
I think it gives people hope, to see that we can find common ground. We’re different sure. He’s got a tail and whiskers, and he’s a blanket hog. [Laughter from audience] I can’t walk in his shoes and he can’t walk in mine, but every day I get to watch him be the amazing guy he is – smart, selfless and brave – and I couldn’t be prouder that he wants me to share his life and wants to share mine.
Parker, completely dropping his mask of professionalism responded eagerly, “Yep! Well half of us. The other guys are doing their teaching rotation up at the shelter. Normally Jarvis controls the towers defense systems but they want us to learn how everything works so that we can be better engineers and teach others if we have to.”
"Suppressants." Tony grumbled, putting the vial back in its case and locking it away. "The new formula I've been working on."
Tony could also have said that he was familiar with the subtle differences in scent produced by ‘mixed’ breeds because he’d lived with the knowledge of his difference his whole life and still subconsciously searched for it in others, but that was a direction far heavier than he wanted to go and they still didn’t have the time.
Traditionally the Benu were hunted in teams led by queen-fels and their mates (symbolic of the way the entire pride functioned as well as practical in a fight against enemy like the Benu). An equal number of teams were selected between the Fel and the Tom who were to be bonded and a contest was made of it.
Robert's face twitched but a moment later he nodded with a sympathetic hum that sounded perfectly rehearsed.
The Winter Soldier might be a ghost story, but Tony had a fairly good idea now how to get his attention.
"Excuse me?" Tony blinked up at Barton who had perched himself on the arm of the ratty couch Tony usually collapses on after long binges when he's too tired to make it to the penthouse.
“Steve, this is Airman Wilson. Wilson, this is Captain Rogers.” Rhodes introduced the stranger at his side with an expression that bordered on exasperated. It wasn’t considered proper for Gata to seek introductions on their own or speak first unless invited to do so by a master but Steve didn’t care. It said something about the guy though and Steve couldn’t help but smile a bit when Wilson extended his hand and didn’t wait before instructing Steve to call him Sam.
"It helps you sleep" he'd said, and Tony couldn't sleep because his body had begun preparing for heat, his scent already deepening with an edge of spice that Clint just wanted to close his eyes and roll around in until the end of his days.
He's seventeen. He's beside his mother in the car. Anger is burning bright and hot within his chest and he resolutely ignores the dull pain of her betrayal as steadfastly as he ignores her softly spoken attempts to explain how she thinks it's a good thing, that Hughard wants to take his whole life away. Shut him away behind thick abbey walls like the dirty secret he desperately hopes to forget.
For a time they just lay in the center of Tony’s bed, breathing quietly in the middle of his darkened room. The darkness made Tony miss the familiar light of his arc reactor. Eventually Steve ended up curled up along his back, one arm over the mound Tony’s hips made under the blanket. He continued to stroke his scalp but didn’t try to push for anything else. He just let Tony float in the security of being in his lovers arms.
He grins widely, breathing in deeply, comforted by the familiar scents of his home and his parents that every breath brings.
“There was a break in at Oscorp” one of the guests, a man Steve didn’t recognize turned to them.  He had his phone in his hand, playing a news clip for the people closest to him.
The phantom snarled, and it truly was a phantom because with all a five of them there its form was rippling and warping, as if it couldn’t decide which form to take. It went from resembling Barnes to looking like a stern faced woman with dead eyes and the next it resembled Howard, and following that Loki.
In short, a shit ton was riding on Tony’s ability to cozy up to Wakanda but lucky for Tony and his future Pride, he’s a first class businessman. He can’t remember when he last showered sometimes but don’t let the bouts of distracted mad genius fool you. He was confident he could out maneuver SHIELD, the US government and the World Security Council combined with a kiss for good luck while he was at it. It was going to cost him a pound of flesh or two, but he was used to that too.
“That’s not your call Captain,” Coulson reminded him but with a wry twist of lips he concluded, “But in this instance Director Fury happens to agree. He’s assembling a SHIELD strike team to handle this issue directly. Pride Avengers will consult. The public needs to see you’re willing to be a mitigating force against potential Gata threats.”
He looked soft in the glow of the Christmas lights. Soft, and strikingly lonely in a way that tugged at something in Tony's chest until he heard himself clearing his throat softly. Steve looked up startled, but relaxed when he saw that it was Tony approaching.
“It’s not all of us,” Bruce pointed out suddenly and when everyone turned to look at him he shrugged. “I didn’t say anything at first because I wasn’t sure if Hulks enhanced immune system played a part in that or not. It’s happened before.”
Though people didn't like to think of themselves as machines for some (stupid) reason, the truth was they just were. The human brain was made up of highly orchestrated sets of fundamental building blocks, computational primitives for constructing sequences - sequences which when experienced in constant repeat built what they understood to be life.
“See,” Tony murmured, crossing the short distance to put a consoling hand on his shoulder when Steve opened his mouth to protest. His body was entirely too tense but he responded almost instantly to the touch, unconsciously shifting closer to Tony’s body.
When his heart rate had slowed and a curious glance down at his arms revealed no more glowing veins, he started to feel awkward because, thanks for the assist and all but, he wasn’t comfortable being held by an actual ass stranger.
*Important. I apologize that these chapters are taking twice as long. I am trying to make up for it by keeping their length nice and meaty.  Good news! My beloved writing partner and all around best friend is back from boot camp! With jumping back into our Sound Of Music fic, and still going to work and class I think updates for this story are going to stay at a once every other week pace for the time being. But as long as there are people expressing interest my promise is to keep at it until I finish.
If that wasn’t how the Queens of old would have done things, too bad for those guys. Maybe they could have learned a thing or two. After all their empires, save one, are all dust.
Catman lowered his arms, releasing a low breath of air that sounded suspiciously like a suppressed chuckle.
"I was kind of a big fan boy. I was five shut up." Steve chuckled when Tony poked his chest. "The point is you're full of shit."
Bruce didn’t repeat what would happen if it didn’t. If the Cradle couldn’t heal Tony faster than Extermis tore him down, if Extremis never accepted his new alien fused DNA. Nobody needed him too. If it didn’t work Tony would die right there in that room and there wasn’t much anybody could do to stop it.
She met Tony on the stepping stairs of the Sting-Jet, because while not as roomy as some of the bigger jets in the Avengers arsenal the Sting made up for it in speed and state of the art cloaking technology, which she preferred on stealth missions. Officially it was called Sting because it was small with bite, like a bee, but really, Tony was just a nerd and couldn't resist the Lord of the Rings reference.
"I take it back. He's not a conservo-nazi. He's anti-establishment and he's got balls of steel." Clint's mouth spread into a wide beam of excitement, because his favorite sort of kat was the kind of kat who could flip Uncle Sam the bird.
He nodded, thanking her, grateful that they had at least something to go on. He needed to call Pepper. If it turned out to be true, that those kits had been part of a KGB operation, they would need to get ahead of the story, or Ross and his cronies were going to bury them in a government-funded torture chamber somewhere they’d never see the light of day again.
“Thank you Tony,” Steve breathed out in a rush, pulling Tony tightly against his chest, but not before Tony missed the way his eyes had clouded with tears he refused to shed and Tony’s chest clenched like a hand had reached in to squeeze his heart. He held Steve tight, tail winding protectively and possessively around his leg like a third arm, as if daring anyone to try and separate them. This close Steve couldn’t hide the way his body was trembling with shock.
He's tall and thin with a very tan complexion, thick glasses perched on a slightly beaky nose. He wears a funny little cap on his head that he explains is a kippah.
“Tony,” by his sigh Tony could tell Bruce had guessed where he was going with this. “No offense to Mr. Debar but when I said you need the opinion of a real medical doctor I meant someone with a medical license.”
Natasha’s thoughts whispered through his as she perched a hip on the arm of his chair and he drew her in close to his side. He pressed his face to the fabric of her shirt and took a slow breath in, allowing her scent and the heat from her body to ground him.
Steve swallowed. He’d had no real concept before this day how messed up his teammates genetics had to be. The way these Wakandian kats moved, how their whole bodies seemed perfectly formed to make them the ultimate hunters… it was something else.
The gold rings in her ears tinkled as she turned her head to stare intently at the general but otherwise she didn’t even make a sound. Not that anybody needed a translator for the threat in her body language. Yikes, the woman gave off an air so lethal even the humans could feel it. With most of his brain power focused on talking to the ship Tony kept having to fight back the instinct to lower his eyes and flatten his ears back to show submission.
"It. All of it." Luke grinned at him with some of the whitest teeth Clint had ever seen, completely shit eating and Clint relaxed, rolling his eyes at the lame joke.
He's tall and on the hungry side of lean but he's got broad shoulders and a sturdiness to his frame that tell Tony he's probably a good worker. He's what Hughard would call prime stock, the sort of man he'd hire in a blink to do the heavy work at the Yard, except for his skin is darker. Darker than anyone else Tony has seen. He's a negro.
Pietro appears on Ivan’s other side, rifling through the wallet Ivan had held in his hand only a second before for the correct amount of bills, grinning like the cocky kit he is. Of the two Pietro’s scent is sweeter. It’s sugar plums and the wind in your nose after fresh snowfall.
“To truly own something, one has to do more than buy it” the tom murmured in reply, lifting a sterling silver pot and turning it for Tony to see. “This still has the price sticker on the bottom. Admit it, if I stole every last thing in your cupboards you’d never even know.”
There were four trucks coming up the highway towards the farm, heavy with tech. There was a chopper in the air sweeping in from the opposite direction. With the amount of chatter being tossed back and forth over their radios Tony felt himself slide into their frequency more than he consciously tried to tap it.
But fuck it, Tony swallowed past the lump in his throat, he was a grown ass man. She was nobody to him. He owed it to himself and the others to get what information he could out of her. He wasn't going to start mewling and crying over the ancient past.
“Clint!” Barney screams his name, drops the bag he carries and reaches desperately for him, but there was no helping it as more and more tiles came loose and he went sliding off the roof edge.
Steve’s voice cracked and he bit his lip, stifling a shuddering sob and Tony grabbed him (because fuck if he could just stand there after that) pulling him close. For a moment Steve froze, but then with a quiet moan he buried his face against Tony’s neck, where his scent was thickest, and dragged in a deep desperate breath.
Captain America and Bucky Barnes, poster duo for Human and Gata codependence. Cap’s Gata side-kick was depicted as the worst sort of lap-kitty, the perfect example of what it meant to be a good boy. He’d wanted to be that once. The good boy someone could love.
"The kid!" Tony blurted, suddenly remembering the cozy den, and Harley putting together a model airplane with his grandfather. "Harley is he-"
Needless to say, Tony was ten times more curious now how the Alurio had been conquered by the Romans and why they had chosen to go into hiding rather than to simply go on a well-deserved killing streak of revenge.
“Hey, cheer up little man.” She sent as much comfort his way as she could muster, the way she always remembered feeling from her dad. “Everything’s going to be fine. You’ll see. We’re going to get our parents back.”
It still happens all the time. Whose gonna believe a kitten anyway if they go telling tales about the master?
Tony winced inwardly, feeling like a heel. If the kits were here it was because they’d been rescued from somewhere else, and after last week they had to be unsure of the stability of their situation.
By the time they were looking for volunteers, another world war had broken out. When the army came back to collect Barnes, Rogers had been just the right combination of good and crazy for old Dr. Erskine to think he was the perfect candidate when he volunteered as tribute.
“Before you start in Stark you should know that I was against the operation from the start. It was out of my hands.”
“Shh, bambino it’s alright. Just show him how to solve the puzzle and then Mr. Jarvis will take us to the park. You’d like that wouldn’t you?”
As Steve's eyes roved over the team making sure that each one of them understood how pissed the others would be if they got themselves in a fix without backup, not for the first time Natasha was glad that Steve was as sharp as he was. It was nice having him already know what they had to do without having it explained to him.
Steve had read up on the war in Afghanistan, but there had been nothing about furthering the Gata-Soldier project in any of the debriefs he’d been given.
Lady Ponka gave them both a curious look as she swept past them in the thick furs the Jabari tribe were so known for.
There was a deeply laced disgust underlining Luke's words now, a barely controlled sort of rage that made what hair hadn't been singed off on Clint's body raise.
Tony had never met anyone with eyes like that besides T’Challa and his companions. He’d almost wondered if it was a trait that had been bread out of gata outside of Wakanda.
Tony blinked, the smell of coffee making his nose and whiskers twitch, and looked down at the cup that had appeared under his nose and then up at the young woman who was holding it out to him.
Clint was going to be impressed till the day he died how thorough SHIELD had been in setting up the guy’s cover. All the way down to a fake Yowler account full of family and friends. But then again, when the target was the Avengers - which included two top spies, and two of the worlds smartest brains - thoroughness was required. Sure, not every kat was fortunate enough to have a Yowler account, but the kind of kat with the backing to become a medical aid would definitely be online with the rest, and if he wasn’t, well it would spark interest and whatever story James Bond kept spinning, the whole spy game was about being quickly forgotten.
“Tony’s our friend,” Harley piped up from his chair, scowling at the she-tom. “If he needs our help then we’re gonna help him. Right guys?”
. Tony knew it without her having to say it. Natasha looked directly at him as if she’d heard the thought but said nothing. He felt like he needed to sit down. If Ivan had made one of the Winter Soldiers credited kills fifteen years ago and the assassin who’d shot Natasha two days ago really had recognized her… that meant Ivan was alive. But how could that be? And how on earth was she taking this so calmly?!
home, and he'd invited the others to live there so technically it had been theirs too for months now, but somehow that hadn't been quite true until suddenly it just was, and Tony wasn't even sure when it had happened.
“Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier,” she offered in explanation.
He was referring to the way fels smelled stronger closer to heat. They weren’t effected by the pheromones the same way tom’s were, not completely, but even a baseline human’s nose picked up on some of the changes- particularly the enticingly sweet edge.
For a bare second he thought about Tony asleep in his bed and he twitched, the want deep in his muscle and bone to press close to him, closer even than they’d been on the roof, and his cheeks heated with the intensity of the sudden stab of need. His mother would have had all sorts of things to say about the bent of his thoughts, but truthfully it wasn't even really about wanting sex.
“No.” He answered. “You were squeaky clean. Little too clean. So naturally, I assumed you probably ran a Heat House when you weren’t punching out Hitler.”
"I believe you Rogers. That's what baffles me. You don't even like Stark, but you put yourself between him and what amounts to a bomb. Is that because of the bond that nobody wants to acknowledge is growing between all of us, or are you really just that noble?"
doesn’t want to do this, the whole ‘see Steve again’ thing, but he can’t ignore Sarah’s summons after everything she did for him, so  Tony had maned up and  hit the road. Rhodey  had  even  made  him  a travel playlist  to help with the nerves because he’s a real bro like that. Only when Tony  had boarded his jet and keyed up  the very first track on the so called, 'Ultimate Reunion Playlist,'  the first few chords had him  cringing  so bad he’d  jabbed  the next button before Gladys Knight could even belt out the  first midnight train.
It was silent for a long moment, with Tony staring at Steve and Steve staring at Tony, the captain stubbornly working his jaw as he worked through his thoughts until Natasha broke the silence.
At the sound of Tony’s interruption Thor smiled, glad that there were still some rewards in life he could count on enjoying more immediately. He suspected that Good JARVIS, Tony’s faithful artificial friend, had had a hand in Tony’s sudden appearance there. JARVIS was what Darcy would call a fretful wart, though without a body Thor wasn’t sure where she drew such a comparison. Nevertheless, the computer did worry and Thor was not above a little manipulation in the name of friendship.
“Is it dinosaurs in Central Park again?” Clint asked as soon as he ended the call. “Because I’m not getting out of bed for anything less than a cosmic level threat.”
Steve predictably turned an embarrassed shade of pink while Tony grinned into his cup. Natasha rolled her eyes at him while Clint made a gagging nose.
Tony and Pepper had to go through all of these names too, digging into backgrounds and searching for subterfuge of some sort. Tony didn’t trust Ross not to try and sneak in spies or otherwise try to sabotage their efforts on the island. That and there was a practical reality that they couldn’t take just anyone. At least not at first. It was perhaps a cruel reality, but a reality nonetheless, that to get their community off the ground they needed people with skills and talents to fill all the roles that would open up. They would also have to be relatively healthy and mentally sound. Unfortunately, the reality of the abandoned and abused of the Gata population was they were often neither.
“Mr. Debar came with lunch Sir and he agreed with me that your diet is suffering from a lack of variety. I bowed to his medical expertise.”
Dad could love all of them equally and likewise, Papa never let them forget that just because Nyota and T’Cael were biologically his, didn’t mean he loved Teddy any less and they were not to let their cousins in Wakanda pick on him just because he didn’t have royal blood like theirs.
Tony woke in a cold sweat, his heart pounding. The dreams had plagued him almost nightly since he and the team had returned from Asgard. Well, more accurately speaking they were Natasha's, and when they held her mind in grip while she slept she couldn't always keep her walls up. Her distress called to him, so thanks to their stunt in Asgard, Natasha was all messed up in the head about Ivan and Tony had a front row seat to the horror show.
"Don't encourage them to get any crazier," Steve muttered under his breath pulling a grinning Tony back toward the dance floor but before they departed he pinned Peter Rasputin with the kind of penetrating gaze that only Captain America could give, which threatened dishonor on your entire family line and all your cows if you disappointed him and said, "You make sure she gets home safe son. And take it easy on the drinks."
And of course, Steve had to be the one to lead them, never mind whatever condition his body was in. Sometimes his noble streak was insufferable, but lucky for him mostly it was charming. Crunching on her apple Natasha sauntered toward him and he stilled, watching somewhat warily as she took a hold of his bared arm.
Sonia for her part was looking at Tony with a cool calculating gleam was in her eyes as she reached down to continue stroking Andre.
"Bet she said she was thrilled about that." Clint jeered as on screen Amee visited the doctor to look into a bunch of hyped up symptoms that the dialogue tried to convince you was something terminal, but any idiot could tell were probably due to pregnancy.
Clint twitched, aborting the urge to sit up and get out of bed when Phil gave him the look of 'don't even think about it'.
The next day when Mama and Jarvis turn their backs for just a moment Tony slips out of sight once more, but this time he’s easily found by the surprised cry he lets loose and the utterly childish way he sobs his heart out outside the locked door of the workshop.
“Maybe we can’t,” Nyota admitted. “But maybe dad and the others can. We just have to plant the right seeds.”
But like so much of Sarah Rogers wisdom it was wasted on her youngest child.  Steve had done nothing but borrow worry as he’d sped down the long and lonely stretch of highway between Boston and Richardsville Georgia, a little town about fifty miles outside of Savanah that nobody had ever heard of unless they’d escaped from it.
“You can’t do that again. Tony that was – ” Steve sobbed against his chest and Tony wrapped his arms around him, wincing at how weak his limbs felt, but nothing in that moment could have stopped him from comforting Steve in that moment.
“Good point,” Steve admitted with a regretful shrug. She was right, and she’d even been fairly gentle about it. He’d seen plenty how Natasha had no patience for stupid.
It’s beautiful, but not as beautiful as the tinkling sounds of piano drifting lazily through the air as his mate plays, or the light muffled snores coming from the warm body tucked close to their chest.
And because Tony was better at smoothing over awkward emotions than talking about them, he grinned cockily and batted his eyelashes in Bruce's direction and said, "But it's good to know Brucie that you're waiting with such bated breath until my next heat. Counting down the days are we?"
Tony opened his mouth instinctively to snap back but no words came out. What was there to say? He was right. It was easy in a simulation to do the math and make the necessary call, but in reality… in reality it would never have been Natasha that Tony sacrificed. She knew that and somehow a man he’d known the shortest amount of time out of anyone knew that. So why didn’t Steve? Did he really think Tony was so callous when it came to ending others lives? Well why not. Tony was the Merchant of Death after all. Steve’s seen the tapes. He’d said so himself.
“Still, it is my hope now that we are strong that we can make a difference in the world, but it is not a popular thought among our elders. A few times we have entertained the notion of revealing ourselves to the world, but each venture has met with some sort of betrayal. First from your father who stole from us, and time and time again with men who saw in us only what they could plunder. Many on my father’s council still think that the rest of the world is too big a threat, and there is a great deal of unrest over the issue. My mother feels as I do, that if there is a chance of helping our brethren then it is our duty to try. But to avoid civil war my father cannot be seen as recklessly endangering our people. Thus my mother sent me on this mission, to judge not only your government but you Tony. Your character. Your weaknesses and strengths.”
"The man deserves a medal," Luke grumbled and Tony clapped a hand on his shoulder, using it for leverage to push himself up off the floor.
But Tony was above that, it wasn't the toms biological perfume that got him. It was that other part. The part where he believed Tony had good sense to begin with, that he had some sort of head on his shoulders that wasn't stuck in some juvenile stasis that needed constant adult supervision.
She was still standing on the other side of Steve’s bed, looking down on him. Her thoughts indiscernible to the outside observer, but she allowed Tony to feel her sadness, if from a distance.  Even so, the depth of it was sobering and made the food in Tony’s mouth taste like ash.
Tony had created these blunt ended arrows that while certainly not fun to get struck with didn’t break skin. The obstacle course was set up so that Clint had the advantage with many high perches but the disadvantage of a minimal amount of cover. Steve had one of the practice disks that Tony had created because there was just no way he was going to risk injuring one of his teammates using the real thing.
“Who wants to pee in my lab?” Tony, who had floated over from the observation booth, asked with a gleeful smirk. Steve was surprised to see that T’Challa and his guards had climbed down from the booth and were slowly making their way towards them.
"Stark! Shut up." Fury barked. "Coulson, if you were kept up to date on his condition why was he cleared for duty?"
“Neither would I.” She murmured a moment later, finally letting the poor guy go and pinning Tony with her gaze instead.
“Please, the kid cries. I only knew enough German to get by with a few barked orders, but there are certain words you learn quick because you hear them so often, you start to hear them in your sleep. Please, the kid chokes, And Bucky jest holds onto him, repeating the same thing over and over. 'You’re free. You’re free'.
"Or what?" The response had a curious ring to it but Tony didn't mind. You know the old saying about curiosity and cats.
From the jet, the island had looked small. Like a drop of cream in somebody's morning coffee, hardly worth the fuss that was being made over it. Steve had spotted four news choppers already circling the island, their harsh spotlights sweeping over the white tents that had been set up on the beach, a virtual city of them lit up by lanterns and fairy lights. With the long grass and the trees behind them it almost looked like some sort of fairy village, beautiful in its own strange way, but Steve found it hard to appreciate given the anxious twist of nerves that had taken up permanent residence in his belly before they’d even landed the jet.
Maybe the whole thing was a bad idea. Steve hadn’t felt this inadequate about anything since he was a ninety-pound asthmatic and it wasn’t a feeling he enjoyed.
Too bad he’d only remembered it there at the end, when it was too late to do anything but die for a lost cause and spit their kits out into the cosmos and hope for the best.
She gave the aid a severe frown. Whether she didn’t like being given orders by an assistant on principle or whether it was because this particular assistant happened to be a kat, who knew, but Tony was just glad that she didn’t try and touch him again.
“They’re moving fast Cap,” Tony warned. He was using another small percentage of brain power to follow where Jarvis had hacked into the buildings security feed.
Immediately he was assaulted with the sensation of sinking, of his head filling up with fog and nightmarish faces.
“I’ve known from the beginning that what Tony saw was a could have been, rather than a picture of what is going to be.” She confessed, and Steve’s eyes widened in surprise as he noted the way her shoulders tensed, the way she began to hold herself too stiffly (as if every effort was focused on keeping still and not curling inward) as she explained, “The little girl you were holding with the red hair, she looks like me. Not just the hair. I knew she was mine the moment I saw her. But it’s not going to happen. Not in this reality.”
THE FEMALE’S SUIT APPEARS TO BE MADE OF A UNIQUELY FLEXIBLE VIBRANIAM ALLOY WE HAVE NEVER USED IN WAKANDA. IT IS OUTFITTED WITH AN ADVANCED VERSION OF YOUR OWN TECHNOLOGY IN A CLEAR IMITATION OF YOUR ARMOR. YOU MAY AS WELL CALL HER IRON WOMAN.
“Morning.” Tony greeted everyone (which included Clint, Bruce and Thor) amiably, saying nothing of either his worry or his relief as he crossed the room toward Natasha. Because he rather embarrassingly needed the contact and because her tail twined with Bruce’s told him she’d let him, Tony inserted himself on her unoccupied side and smacked a kiss against her cheek.
That light show that had gone off in his head... Steve didn't even know how much he'd needed that until it was happening. His eyes stung, like he might start crying and he grimaced at himself.
"Christmas isn't Tony's favorite time of year. Can't say it's my favorite either," Clint explained with a groan as Natasha did something with his wounded shoulder (presumably something good, though it was hard to tell by Clint's miserable expression). "All that focus on families you'll never have and those sappy commercials of happy couples getting kits in baskets with red bows under their trees, completely glossing over the fact that some fel out there is never going to see her kid again and that happy couple is probably going to get tired of a crying baby in a week and ship the kid off to the Center for Unclaimed's in a cardboard box."
"Oh" the man raised dark eyebrows in an expression of surprise, eyes flicking to Phil. "But I thought you were collared."
Currently the ARK was flying over the Atlantic Ocean on what was definitely a planet earth and as far as Nyota was concerned, morning couldn’t come soon enough.
“Any luck on the Winter Soldier front?” Tony asked, even though JARVIS kept him regularly updated on Steve and Natasha’s efforts in companion to their own. Jarvis was running every CCV and shaky cellphone camera through an algorithm designed to snag anyone who resembled Barnes based off a detailed face map Tony had put together from Natasha’s memory. Meanwhile Tony was slowly but surely picking his way through every computer he could get his mental hands on, running his sound matching program. In his head (hence the near constant background headache). According to the good doctors Bruce and Helen his brain is almost more computer now than he should be humanly comfortable with.
"Okay, now what the hell does that mean?" Clint asked once more, throwing his hands up in exasperation.
“Bye kiddos, it’s been real. Sorry I was an ass about the stew, Luke. I don’t want to say it was better than tuna, but the body is weak. I may have to hire you on as my personal chief. Pepper has the paperwork.” Lifting his stack of files in salute Tony departed, only glancing back when Natasha’s thoughts followed him.
The Avengers were strong and they knew their gifts, but Tony had never been more aware of the alien nature of his genes. But this time the proof came from without and not within. This was the true modern Alurio, as close to the Alurio of old as it was possible to get. The distinction between them and what the world called Gata could not have been more clear, and privately Tony was beginning to understand why the Prince of Wakanda had such a stick up his ass about it.
Tony paused one of the searches to zoom in on the scowling profile of a Matthew Beavers. Mid-forties, bald, a strange looking tattoo peeking out of the collar of his shirt. Ex-marine. Twenty years in private security. Records suspiciously tidy.
And it was just good not to feel like he was the only one who’d taken the bait for once; because when he’d told the team, far from getting the united experience of shock and betrayal that the situation definitely warranted, Tony had received luke-warm shrugs and expectant nods.
Only, it was surging again, growing stronger as the voices of his friends grew quieter and the fog thicker.
Rhodey opened his mouth, about to say something when an enticingly rich scent filled Tony’s nose, his whiskers twitched from the slight air pressure of an incoming presence and his ears twitched toward the sound of someone clearing their throat just behind him.
Outside the facility the night sky was clear and the roof empty of all signs of life besides his own.
Clint and his brother Barney had gotten luckier than most. They’d been bought by Carson’s Carnival and shipped to the US of A almost before their eyes fully opened. The circus life hadn’t been so bad, when you compared it to getting chewed up and tossed away when your body was too broken to fight anymore.
“The mercenaries were enhanced too,” Steve noted. “And so far they’ve only targeted OSCORP. You think Osborn is trying to create more Gata Soldiers, don’t you?”
Tony only had a split second to think. Car hit by something. Dent in roof suggesting someone or something had landed there. Enough time to get in briefcase suite before -
“I am rerouting SHIELD backup to you Sir, but for the safety of civilians and other agents, Agent Coulson is unable to issue a no kill order.”
Obadiah flashes through Tony’s mind in pictures, glossy and pristine like the pages of a magazine, only in full color. He’s soft eyes and hearty chuckles, tinkling crystal glasses filled with bright amber liquid and the acrid smell of cigar smoke.
Nyota swallowed, gulping down a breath of cool air but it did nothing to relieve the burning in her gut. Riri had a good point. Even so, Nyota hated the idea but since she couldn’t explain to any of them why she hated it without admitting how weak she was, she just shrugged.
When a tom penetrated a fel there were certain biological factors that had to be in play to result in kits.  When Tony’s father and Robert Stone had decided that fifteen-years-old was old enough for Tony to become a baby factory, it had been necessary to know everything he could about breeding and how to prevent it.
“I trust you.” Steve repeated, just as firmly and decisively as when they’d started, and Tony’s smile warmed into something real.
He hadn’t planned it. That’s obvious right, because Tony could be accused of a lot of things, arrogance and overconfidence to name a few, but he had certainly not planned to watch the man he loved take a bullet meant for him, or the way that it would make him feel.
he asked, but the woman had disappeared, the fog thickening. But Tony had the strange certainty that she was still there. They all were. He could hear their chanting and singing, lower than breath but there just the same. And then her voice was back, trickling through his mind like water gliding over rock.
"The night Tony was abducted." Natasha explained slowly. "I thought the virus was going to kill him. It must have fixed whatever was blocking his reach before because I felt him reach for my mind."
Steve’s worry washes through them as he looks to Tony who offers silent comfort. They can feel other minds doing the same, so that it pulses across the bond they all share. There are more than just six Avengers now.
"Stark," Steve began in that 'captain's' tone of his, a teasing slant to his lips as he spoke ruining the effect. "If I let you think you were always right we'd all be outfitted with rocket boots and you'd be on the phone with the president trying to convince him that Metallica would make a better national anthem."
"I find that being specific helps prevent any misunderstandings. Why wasn't I informed of Mr. Stone's request Director?" She asked in a no-nonsense tone that demanded an answer.
Next up. There's a robbery at ViXon Tech and the Avengers go head to head with the mysterious Gata-soldiers and their stolen tech. Peter doesn't know what you mean by training wheels, and Ivan the trainer is being haunted by an annoying hallucination that insists on being called Tony. How's a guy supposed to concentrate on a terrorist plot with all that chatter? Peitro is pretty sure their handler is losing his mind but Wanda isn't sure if he had it in the first place.
The woman's tail swished lazily and at first it did not seem as if she would answer, and Tony wasn't the only one pissed off by that.
"Excuse me?" Steve gaped incredulously, like he couldn't believe the audacity of what he was hearing. Truthfully neither could Tony but for vastly less annoying reasons. "We've come a very long way and she won't even speak to us?"
It wasn't exactly popular in any school of thought but Tony had long held to the thought that human beings were basically computers anyway. Not the almost laughably simple systems they've managed to invent in copy, but nevertheless advanced computing systems.
And every three months he was forced to relive the steady feeling of losing control and watch as the heads turned and the eyes fixed on him with greed. So he didn't really care much that pheromone blocking was frowned upon and medically wasn't the best for his health, he wasn't going to walk around with his pheromones begging someone to strap him to a mating block.
Even though it meant she was finding him irritating he almost smiled because he appreciated that she called things how she saw them.
She'd always liked the winter. The beauty of the ice and the prisms contained within at the touch of sun. It's honest. One of the few honest things in the world.
“Tony, do we have eyes on the hostage?” Steve shouted over the comms, thankful not for the first time for flying teammates who weren’t restricted to getting places on foot.
Resolved, Tony let the rage he’d kept contained for hours (days) free, let his thoughts slide away with another deep breath, giving himself permission to feel the thirst for vengeance and not to fear the consequences for his body.
“Tony.” He replied slowly. “My friend’s call me Tony and yeah that’s it. Just know you and Harley are welcoming up here. Anytime.”
Tony smiled in reply, not quite able to find words to express how he felt. How amazing. How afraid. How hopeful... but the gentle rub of Steve's hand against his back seemed to say he understood.
They open their mouth to offer some platitude, but fate does them one better because JARVIS announces that Stark and the captain are on their way up. Jaime scrambles up, nudging awake the sleeping girl who yowls at the rude awakening and attempts to scratch him.
Tony staggered, dizziness overwhelming him as he blinked his head clear and shoved the noise back. He couldn’t fail to notice the return of energy building in his chest. He grabbed Harley by the shoulder and the kit tapered off mid-sentence.
Tony still wasn’t sure. He was still deliberating on it as he left Steve and Natasha to their research and trudged his way to the elevator to have JARVIS take him up to the penthouse.
Harley was young but he was far from an idiot. He’d picked up now on the tension in the room, his shoulders hunching defensively as he realized he’d done something wrong. He shifted uncomfortably on his feet, ears flattening as he made himself smaller.
“Those places. You could smell them a mile off. The drugs and the sick and the despair was a stench that was hard to get rid of. Bucky would get kinda crazy whenever we got near one. He hated everything about them. So did I, but it was different for him. It was…”
"I suppose it does," he hears Mama reply. "Hector's offer seemed more than generous Hughard. You can't ignore him."
Stay in the moment, he reminded himself. The future will be whatever you make of it. And this right here, this beginning with Steve and the team. It was good too. Just right.
The one asking the question had hair almost as orange as his fur on his tail and ears with the signature tabby stripes, so Tony was just going to call him Stripes and be done with it.
“Fair point,” Steve acknowledged, taking a long look at those rafters and calculated, changing his grip on his shield and let fly. Predictably the tom leaped out of the way of the flying disc but Steve had figured for that. It was incredibly satisfying to watch the shield catch the tom on its rebound and knock him loose from the rafters. Steve already knew how agile the man was and wasn’t one for repeating his mistakes, so that by the time T’Challa had twisted himself into a position to grab the railing on his way down Steve was already there to take him out.
“The needle isn’t going to bother him is it?” Dr. Salek turned toward Coulson who was there on behalf of SHIELD as well as Bruce’s official handler. The doctor held the needle delicately between two fingers and looked about as ready to poke Bruce with it as she was ready to attempt to dismantle a bomb. Tony rolled his eyes even as Helen quietly reached and took the needle from the nervous woman’s hands and grabbed Bruce’s arm, pushing back his shirt sleeve to search for a vein.
Bruce and Clint were both sporting reindeer antlers on top of their heads to match their fuzzy brown sweaters and Thor wore a matching costume with Harley. Tony meanwhile was sitting comfortable in a pearly white suit, his customer designed white shades tucked artfully into his hair.
Normally Tony would have told any asshole who tried to tell him what he could or couldn't do in his own lab to fuck off and provided them with a detailed listing of the highest bridges in New York state; but the thing was it didn't feel like Luke was throwing his weight around actually trying to make him quit. He got the feeling that if he really did tell the tom to fuck off that he would.
And truthfully, Tony was almost dizzy with relief because for a horrible moment there he'd thought that Bruce was telling him he was sick of waiting and that he'd given up on the idea of bonding with someone like Tony, because really when you think about it that would probably be the smart thing.
Pietro is certainly quick, but he lacks Wanda’s discipline and keen eye for observation. Sometimes this is good too.
"You really shouldn't miss the mind-numbing trash we put our lives on the line to protect. It's glorious."
The hunger is thick in the air as the sleek personal jet that can only belong to the visiting prince and his envoy finally comes in for its landing. It’s a gorgeous display of sleek metal and quietly humming power that Tony appreciates right down to his bone marrow. She’s not the biggest aircraft Tony has ever seen but he can spot at least four sets of guns artfully tucked against her body and it’s obvious that it’s intentional. Their showing off their firepower so there won’t be any confusion. The whole landing is an artful display of teeth really. Wealth and power rolled into one gleaming package, and on top of that her engine runs so smoothly she’s no louder than a purr.
Because there’s no reason for Steve to know how he likes his coffee - black with two spoons of demerara sugar (cabinet left of the sink, marked CRACK in Rhodey’s handwriting) or that he’s a chewy bacon guy (because why would you dry the life out of bacon people, come on) and that he can’t stand runny egg yolk, unless Steve has cared enough to pay attention.
Princess wiggled the cup invitingly, sloshing its contents and Tony arched a brow at her asking, “who told you how I take my coffee?”
As a reminder this is a poly fic with multiple combinations of relationships, but a Queen only has one consort. I think it will be very easy to understand and support why Tony chooses the one he chooses, but that doesn't mean his other options are less worthy or loved less. Please don't character bash it hurts my soul lol.
All eyes turned to Tony, who pulled his fingers from his mouth to gesture for the kits who were clambering around their heroes to pepper them with questions and play with the bits and pieces of their costumes, to take their seats again.
Natasha’s fingers had stilled on her tablet, pulling her eyes away from her work to stare at the Colonel because that hadn’t been a lecture. It was a warning. The incident at the shopping center had been all over the news that morning. An unidentified man had entered a shop, gotten into an argument with someone inside and exploded with enough force to destroy the store and blow out a section of the building. Police had suspected a terrorist with a homemade explosive until salvaged security footage had shown the perpetrator self destruct the same way their attackers at the safe house had.
Suddenly it was just all a little too overwhelming: the rapid cycle through rage, terror, and unspeakable gratitude. Unless something had gone dreadfully wrong with the arc reactor he was pretty sure his body was rattling. He could use some of that nasty tasting tea right about now.
And then he remembered what T’Challa had told him, that day in the lab, back when things had been simpler, when his hope had been younger but his doubts no less crushing.
His musings were interrupted when the door suddenly opened and just like that, the man who had been Peter’s hero almost his entire life was sweeping into the room with an apology for keeping him waiting that Peter barely heard.
He must have seen the coming refusal in Tony's expression because Thor's tone got very somber and cajoling.
“I will send Ms. Potts the details.” T’Challa replied evenly and Tony nodded seriously in agreement. Way too seriously, for far longer than the exchange really warranted.
Tony knew he was in danger of sounding like a broken record going on about how damn graceful the guy was, but considering that little maneuver left him with only Tony to land on top of, he felt it was warranted to note that not only did the guy stick his landing, caging Tony only momentarily with his arms and legs, he did it with an inch or two to spare between their faces and Tony only briefly felt the brush of a firm chest against his before Catman was leaping back to his feet. So Tony gave the guy props and everything for not crushing him and for badassary.
A completely expected but no less enthusiastic for it cheer went around the hall and when the rabble had died Bastet turned to Thor’s mother who was standing with his father a ways behind the bride.
He could see Clint’s shadow moving on the floor, leaping from post to post overhead. He held still, keeping to cover while he could waiting for the perfect angle.
“Who are you?” the soldier rasps with terror in his eyes but Tony doesn’t lower his guard or his hands. The soldier is an animal cornered but his teeth will still bite and his claws still rake. The woman washing at the sink doesn’t turn. They don’t exist to her.
You know, for people who are one mutated chromosome away from being kats themselves, human beings are funny creatures. They insist upon the supposed inferiority of those unfortunate souls saddled with the ‘Gata-gene” and no matter how many exceptions they’re presented against the rule it will always be a surprise to them when one comes along.
He’d opened his mouth to tell the kid once and for all to stay put when he felt the enemy approach. That mechanical hum in the back of his mind that he’d been persistently ignoring had grown steadily louder. Suddenly his brain seemed to catch onto some of the bits and pieces of the digital conversation passing around him until he could access the data as easily as if he we holding his StarkPad.
Under the cover of dark Natasha had scaled the building and slipped through a vent with such ease they might as well have left the front door open for her.
He couldn't force Stark to make them pride, to give him the promise of security he needs sometimes just keep his eyes closed at night. Those are Clint's demons and he's got to deal with them.
"No." Loki replied and the kick of it all was Tony could swear there was a deep wound underneath that single word. "To see my replacement."
It worked. It burned almost as bad as if he'd taken a blow torch to the center of his palms but it did work.
“Don’t worry about me. I get back to the lab, I’ll figure out a way to lick this thing no sweat but first things first. Right?” Tony flashed her a confident grin, even though he knew that she’d see through it.
Tony swallowed, feeling an odd sense of falling. He thought he had a pretty good idea of what Bruce was getting at.
Before they’d even landed at the tower Tony had JARVIS gathering everything he could find on the incident, every scrap of footage that had been found no matter how grainy or on whose cellphone it had been recorded.
Steve really decided for himself that he wanted to step out with Tony (and all that it would mean to do it) Christmas eve when they’d been sitting on the couch, the remnants of the party all around them. Most of the guests had either gone to find their beds but a few had simply dropped wherever it was comfortable in the living room, on couches or in Harley’s case curled up on the floor next to DUMMY one arm hugging the powered down bot as if to keep him from rolling away.
They saw the Alurio as a threat to their rule if they were allowed to grow too numerous so they did their best to wipe them out, and those they left they kept for slave work (and once the heat thing was discovered, grade-A-distractions. Ten out of ten would ride again).
Wanda. Desperate. He can feel her and Pietro now, their pain reaching through the fog, louder than any command in his head. Someone or something is hurting them. He snarls, the sound ripping out of his chest with a flash of bared teeth. Wanda and Pietro are his, and he can’t let – won't let, anything happen to them!
"You. Don't go anywhere." Tony tried to warn the black costumed vigilante even as he tried to wiggle out of Natasha's grip. "I'm fine, Natasha really!"
He closed his eyes, taking in the familiar (safe) scent of her and savoring the methodical rub and scratch of her fingers. It was a long moment before he was able to answer.
Of course she doesn't, because Tony is there and Mama is braver than anyone in the whole world, but Tony doesn't want another uncle if he's like this.
"But you do." The tom insisted quietly, not taking his eyes off of his work as he slowly peeled the bandage away from the healing skin on Clint's torso and he hissed, not entirely in pain at the inevitable pull on his skin.
"As soon as he sees you walking around all fresh and pink, he’s going to want to play too.” She offered instead, unsurprised when Steve's brow furrowed in displeasure, because it was okay for him to be a fool and take risks but it would never be okay for the others. That was just the way he was wired. His weakness, the part of her that was red and always would be recognized, and perhaps it was also his greatest strength.
“JOCASTA! Override the administrative settings and search for designation 20999” she shouted, even as Riri and Amory demanded to know what the hell she was doing. She doesn’t answer (she barely knows).
Sure enough, by the time Clint arrived at the jet it was to find Banner and Steve climbing aboard, Natasha already strapping into the pilot’s chair and Tony nowhere in sight. Thor is off world again so his absence was pretty much expected. Some protective instinct in Clint didn’t like that Tony wasn’t there where they can protect him, but he shoves that animal voice in the back of his head down because it was a distraction and he knew as well as anybody that Tony could take care of himself, heat or no heat.
Well, the short version is Clint decided to play hero and fucked the whole job up. He got his ass beat by his own brother and left to take the fall when the suits showed up.
The soldier mouths the word silently, marveling when its meaning and the memories attached to it don’t float away. It’s his now. He doesn’t know what knowing it changes, but it tastes like power in his mouth.
The loss of her whiskers should have put her at a disadvantage, but there was more than one way to detect changes in air pressure and she was an expert in all of them. Getting them plucked had been agonizing in ways that few tortures have even scratched at, but it like a few others had been a necessary loss. Ears and tails could be strapped, taped, and tucked away if need be. Whiskers could not.
“What an exquisite creature.” Sonia turned to murmur at Tony after a moment. “Those eyes are magnificent. Andre has always stood out, having that bit of yellow in his, but I’ve never seen eyes as feline as hers.”
“You’re coming in loud and clear Cap, mostly loud.” Tony’s voice suddenly filtered through the comm and some of the tension in Clint’s gut eased. Tony was alright. For the time being.
She’d led them here. This was their best chance, their only chance of getting their parents back and changing the future for the better. Whether she was right or wrong about that her cousins were going to follow her because they were Pride, and she was Queen.  Whether she wanted to be or not.
Tony opened his mouth to tell him how wrong that was because A, learning about it was exactly what he Helen and Bruce were doing down in the lab non stop, and B, Tony was 97.353% sure of how his body would take to BX; but Natasha beat him to the punch.
Steve’s hands tightened on Tony’s waist and Tony rolled his eyes. Good job calming things down Bruce.
And that's how the next to godlike heroes of the Egyptians became household slaves. Over time they became popular pets for the wealthy but after some rich idiot got his wangle bitten off by an aggressive kitty, it was agreed that something had to be done to properly domesticate them.
Furnace! Furnace! He thinks, desperate for control but his brain just buzzes louder, the world around him morphing and changing into -
The collar was simple but fine leather, with an unobtrusive purple plate in the center with an chip embedded that allowed JARVIS to monitor his condition and his location at all times. One could never be too careful.
“But it is your scrutiny we must worry about now.” T’Challa said, neatly switching the subject. “You will have to stay secluded, at least until you can once again form a mental barrier between yourself and the minds of others. Bruce tells me there is a human telepath who may be able to assist you with the changes you have undergone and help you gain the necessary control over your abilities.”
Tony paused mid-read, glancing down to meet the curious pair of yellow eyes belonging to… uh. Okay so Tony didn’t actually know the kids name, but to be fair there were a lot of kats at the shelter and no matter how important Maria’s House was to him, the reality of running a major corporation on top of the growing list of other things he managed meant he didn’t have a lot of time to put faces to names.
That was what Steve really hated most about politicians, their ability to smile and shake hands with you even as they sharpened their knives. He didn’t trust Prince T’Challa and not just because he’d already lied to them. Nobody else seemed to be able to see it but he could. Wakanda might have come out of hiding for the Avengers but T’Challa wasn’t here for the sake of their Pride. It was Tony he was here for, Tony he’d focused most of his efforts on the last time and everyone had noticed how hard Tony had taken it when he’d discovered the truth about the guy.
Using Prince T’Challa as a sounding board just made sense given that he was the only authority on Wakanda’s technology and its people that Tony had. Thus far he had proved himself to be trustworthy and had put a decent amount of faith in Tony that he would honor the bargains they had made and would not use any of his knew knowledge to harm Wakanda. A history changing, and unprecedented alliance was forming right under everyone’s noses and it was happening across the net in what basically amounted to texts. Tony’s life was weird.
Because it wasn't always sleepy cuddles and dopey smiles. Sometimes it was lustful eyes and gripping hands, and "Strap him down Boy. it's not unusual for a kitten like Tony to be anxious their first time, but once you warm him up you'll see how he takes to it".
She was in love with her groom Thor was sure – she’d talked of nothing but the tom since her last journey to her home world and had whined incessantly at Mother until she’d approached Bastet about the union – and therefore was excited to begin her life as a part of a mated pair, but she would make that life far from the home she knew, among many strangers.
Peter heard himself spit out the truth before he could stop it. It was like he was just vomiting words. He couldn’t help it. The way Tony was looking at the clip of him fighting those bad guys like he was something amazing and he’d just called his webbing genius. Peter’s ears were standing straight up, dizzy delight rushing through him in a brilliant jolt as Tony smiled at him, but the euphoria was followed by terror at what he’d just admitted.
“Sorry Bucky. I can’t let you take her.” The kat said, their voice heavy with modulation to make it indistinguishable. It was enough to snap Ivan out of the fog. Iron Man. That’s where he recognized that triangular symbol from. The same design in the center of that star is on the face of the reactor that powers Stark’s suit.
Tony was still wondering how any of it was possible. Something was going on here and the pieces of the puzzle were all right there, he knew it. He had only to figure out their order.
“Tony Fucking Stark.”  the guy drawled, country as you please, apparently having no trouble whatsoever believing it was really Tony with his ass hanging out his window. “Tell me how it is a guy can build a fucking robot, but can’t figure out how to change a tire?”
His head had finally cleared enough to realize that someone had a hold of him and was yanking him away from his prey. He had just enough time to realize that it was Steve, pushing him back, inserting himself between Tony and
So I decided to leave T'challa's official arrival for next chapter because this one felt complete without it. I'm particularly interested in how you think Steve did. Haha did he take T'challa's advice? And better question, should he take T'challa's advice? The jelly was strong. :P
“A geriatric citizen is an old person, usually someone from the last living generation. Or you know, Captain America, although he cheats by being ridiculously young and fit. It’s not very fair to the rest of us.”
“She’s a nasty woman from a movie, but she isn’t looking for you because I’m an asshole and it was a bad joke. Sorry.” Tony apologized. “And you guys aren’t going to be sold again. If you want to go live with a nice family we can arrange that, but it will be your choice.”
“Tony.” Pepper reprimanded without even looking up from her StarkPad and Steve’s neck flushed red. But Tony caught that brief flare of his nostrils, the way he took in Tony’s scent and the way his deepened just that little bit with arousal.
It was a lot to hope for. Bruce was still not wholly convinced that something that wonderful was possible. No matter what the data said. And even if it was, he didn't think he was the kind of guy who got lucky like that. The Avengers were likely an experiment doomed to failure.
Natasha was suspicious of the fact that he’d bonded so quickly with the intern, but weirdly (even to himself) Tony just couldn’t find it in himself to feel the same. He couldn’t explain it. He just knew on some instinctual level that she was meant to be his.
“Tony, Tony please, just listen,” Steve reached again to grip Tony’s arms and squeeze gently, interrupting the desperate flow of words and Tony snapped his mouth shut mulishly and turned his head, maybe in an attempt to hide just how upset he was becoming again. “You’re right. Absolutely right. I handled it badly and I’m not proud. The only thing I want you to know is it wasn’t about you. I’d be… Tony I’d be so happy to have kits with you someday. I’d be… so honored.”
Mother? In his day it was mother but he had no idea what was considered correct these days and didn’t feel like opening up an argument with Tony if Mother was considered horribly offensive.
"Tony are you alright?" Cap asked, unaware of the silent exchange, hand reaching toward him like he might gently grip his elbow and Tony shrugged out of range. He couldn't handle being touched just then.
"Sir," JARVIS projected the reports on the HUD display with a hint of worry. "Agent Romanov is correct. Your current BPM is 190, and your body temperature is at 102 degrees and climbing. It would be wise to cease your current activity."
For a moment he was terribly torn, and of all the things that could have come to mind he suddenly thought of that moment in his lab with Luke when he'd felt... good. So good. So sure of himself.
And Tony totally did. Other than that one slip with Fury he’d not melted any brains or caused any accidents. He’d successfully bonded with Bruce and Natasha even when he’d been psychically stunted so what could the danger be really?
Tony tore his eyes away from the quickly disappearing figure of the tom to stare at Thor, one eyebrow inching upward.
Tony should know. He's a kat too, and Howard might have been Tony's father but that didn't make Tony his child. Not in Howard's eyes or anyone elses.
But T’Challa hadn’t said anything he hadn’t been wondering and putting together in the back of his mind since this whole thing started and he realized that Barnes must still be alive.
The Morning Show’s host had one of those smooth smarmy voices that in Nyota’s experience, usually accompanied the kind of toms her parents had warned her away from and that aunt Tasha had taught her how to incapacitate without breaking a sweat.
A bead of sweat rolled into Tony’s eye and he blinked it away. It was a dreary gray winter day in the middle of New York City but Tony’s body didn’t seem to know it. One of the unfortunate side effects of heat was a literal jump in his (already hotter than the human average) body temp. He was hot, achy and uncomfortable, making the idea of taking a long soak in a nice pool very appealing. The Tower had at least two of them that Tony had never even been in (preferring the private pool at his Malibu home) but there was no time for stripping down and floating his discomfort away.
"I do not know the specific language, but the AllSpeak allows me to understand all that is spoken to me, and for me to speak to all in return." Thor explained before returning his eyes to the dot in the distance that was their strange new (almost) friend. "What he calls you is difficult to express in your English, but it is not a name but an endearment. It means Queen in my heart."
"Quite right Peach, but it's the principle of the thing." He says, and thankfully they’re back to normal once more.
The Avengers leading the way as the first government sanctioned pride, it had opened up the door of discussion for forming other units in other cites in the future and the necessary changes that would need to be made to the strict domestication regulations.
Who cared if he was the best looking tom this side of the milky way (visiting alien princes not included).
"The people rejoiced and Namer fell to his feet before her, and asked her to become his queen. This made his first wife very jealous but Namer loved no one so much as he loved Niethotep and the children she bore him.She was queen in his heart. For herself, Niethotep was no longer thought to be a demon but was called Alurio, a child of the gods, and it was believed by the kings of Egypt who followed her husband as well as those of the surrounding lands, that so long as the Alurio were welcomed into their houses then their kingdoms would never fall to any enemy. Even one so mighty as the Benu.
"Sorry. Hugely intimidating, not at all tiny, massive in a perfectly feminine and non derogatory way. Have I mentioned you look fantastic in blue? Is Cap jealous you're wearing his colors?"
The kit is thirteen years old, and he has just flowered. It’s what they call it when kittens start heating every three months. His very first heat had been miserable. Painful and frightening as his body had called for the mate he didn’t have without mercy.
He’d asked JARVIS where to find Steve and had been informed that Steve was waiting for him in the Penthouse with dinner.
From the smell as Tony stepped off the elevator, Steve had made his killer spaghetti. Which he made from actual tomatoes and shit because that’s how Lula somebody had taught him to make it and they didn’t have the canned crap back in his day. Whatever, the point was it was delicious and there was something incredibly nice about getting through with a long day of work and coming upstairs to the smell of a meal and your very own barefooted super soldier.
Practically speaking, they all understood how this should go. Tony as the queen should bond them all. His focus should be on the pride's unity, daily needs, and future well-being. Privately Bruce thought that while Tony wasn't the most emotionally perceptive fel out there, he made up for it with a surprisingly giving nature. Tony was guarded, and rightly so, but once tapped he was a fountain that gave so selflessly at times it bordered on self-destructive.
“Whoa, easy! It’s not going to explode if you touch it.” Tony assured her with a frown of concern when she didn’t make any attempt to close the distance she’d put between them. “It’s never done that before, granted, but I wouldn’t have it out of the lab if I weren’t sure it was safe.”
He’s crawling almost as soon as his mother puts him down on his stomach and by six months he’s hard to keep track of.
“It’s unlikely. He was hovering by your bed until I kicked him out. Instead of going home to sleep like I told him to, he's camped in Steve’s room.”
“The company is refusing to resume labor unless we can guarantee that the project isn’t going to be shut down.”
It's irritating as fuck and Steve can take that superior attitude and shove it where the sun doesn't shine.
“Tony is strong, and our friends in there as well as on other worlds will see to it that he is well taken care of.” Thor was saying. Steve looked up curiously, waiting for him to explain. Thor had gotten back from Asgard late that morning, just when they’d all begun to worry that something might have happened to him. Steve knew he wouldn’t have missed this if he could help it.
Which is why Breeders came up with mating blocks, where you shackle the fel down on their front in prime mating position. Howard had purchased one after Tony’s third heat had passed with no babies in sight and Ty had bitched to Robert about how Tony wouldn’t take teeth. Which should have been the end of it really, except fifteen-year-old Tony concocted all sorts of unstable potions to jack up his glands and halt his ovaries in their tracks. Because fuck being impregnated against his will. Eventually when even the mating block failed to do the trick Howard learned what Tony had done, and when the doctor reported the significant damage he’d done to his reproductive system and strongly discouraged breeding him he’d finally been forced to give up.
“Aye my friend. Though she may indeed seem a god to you Midgardians, she is but one of many from a race called the Kǫtrdýr. We came across them many earth centuries ago. There was a brief war, which my mother helped to end. As a show of good faith that our two kingdoms would always be at peace, Bastet presented her with a pair of kits.”
Tony has heard this almost daily since the day of his birth and knowing Hughard, probably even before.
Everyone turned and looked at her but if Natasha was at all bothered by the intense scrutiny or the shock rippling across her teammates faces she didn’t show it.
The red studded boots were just all Tony, and the white silk jumper her wore wrapped artfully around his powerful legs. It was cinched at the waist with a mesh band that looked thinner than smoke and did little to hide the olive skin beneath. The long sleeved top was stitched effortlessly to the band and was more sleeves than not, with how much of his chest it left bared to the world. His ordeal with Extremis had seen the arc reactor removed along with all of the evidence that it had ever been there, which filled Steve with an odd pang of wistfulness. Tony must have felt the same way because the only hint of ornament he wore was a necklace of his own making, a long silver chain that ended in a metal disk, fashioned to resemble the missing reactor.
Which totally wasn’t fair because Tony hadn’t actually drunk that much liquor. Not tonight anyway. But even he could admit it must have been going to his head because said head felt foggy and thick, and his tongue kept acting like it was covered in tacky glue.
He really didn't. There wasn't anyone standing there who didn't know what a game changer this could be. It could blow the game wide open.
“Technically we wouldn’t have to.” Riri theorized, catching on to Nyota’s thoughts. Nyota beamed at her. “If we could open a portal between both earths just before the incursion point, theoretically we could time it so that one of those earths jumped to another designated location, say ahead of the collision point, thereby missing the collision altogether. It would be nearly instantaneous. The people on planet wouldn’t feel a thing.”
him see.  Steve made no mistake about that. If she hadn’t chosen to let him see this side of her he’d never have known it was there at all because that was how Natasha operated. How she protected herself.
Tony has been through many tutors but Herr Vonkov in particular is a nightmare. He is always caning Tony's bottom and coming up with humiliating punishments for his smart mouth.
Tony wanted to insist that neither of them were as qualified as he was in the field of engineering and that if anyone was capable of safely stretching the limits of the cradle it was him, but the protests died on his tongue in the face of Luke's silently patient demeanor.
They'd been sleeping together for under a month, only that night Clint couldn't sleep because he was royally fucked and he knew it. Tony had wandered into the kitchen in those ridiculous sweat pants and that holey tank top with his hair all mussed, and asked him if he'd like a mug of warm cream.
He could respect that, do his part not to take it personally, but if any part of her wanted to try, Tony wanted her to know he’d be there.  Natasha blinked slowly, allowing her eyes to soften as she closed the distance between the three of them, placing her hand between his ears and sinking her fingers into his hair as she pressed her cheek to his, a soft purr rumbling in her chest.
Tony arched a disbelieving brow, though honestly, he wasn’t sure what if anything to make of the information.
Clint cackled out loud because he loved that woman. The console of the jet made a beeping noise of its own and Clint put his phone back in his breast pocket and flicked on the jets communicator.
“Listen. I wasn’t there, but I know one thing. You were the best thing to ever happen to Barnes.” Tony’s hands clutched tightly to Steve’s back when he thought the soldier might try and move, his head shaking in protest at the words, but Tony held tighter and pressed on. “Yes! Steve, I mean that."
He makes a face at the mention of the dour schoolmaster who teaches all the young children of court.
"I shall do so Sir, but if it is your intention to prevent Ms. Romanov from making good on her threat, might I suggest an impromptu vacation? You do enjoy the Malibu house." JARVIS answered as Tony plopped down in the open chair beside Rhodey.
He hissed when the guy moved suddenly, but it was only to present his hands toward Tony, wrists up and fingers fisted together.
Steve grit his teeth together but said nothing in reply as the Colonel patted Wilson’s shoulder in a companionable way, still holding Steve’s gaze.
He swallowed thickly, biting back the words that wanted to tumble from his mouth. He wasn't even sure if it would be more cutting remarks or apologies.
And by god was Steve in a state. His aura was still inky and black, roiling like a pot on low boil on the edges of Tony’s consciousness – a pool that no sane man would step into, but no one had ever accused Tony of complete sanity.
"Hey stop! Theif!" He shouts, heart cracking in his chest. And even as he jolts, moving to run after the figure shoving his way through the crowd of startled onlookers, Yinsen has grabbed the back of his shirt to hold him back.
Steve just kept smiling at her as he resumed awkwardly unwrapping those bandages still around his torso.
Steve had been all but ordered to consider Tony as a potential mate when Fury had first presented the Initiative to him, but Steve was not the sort of guy to follow orders blindly and that fresh from losing Bucky the idea had left him feeling sick. In those days just getting out of bed in the morning without wanting to slip back under the ice took most of his energy; but he’d told himself he had to keep going for Bucky’s sake, and that Bucky would have wanted the Pride, would have jumped at the opportunity that Fury was offering and that it would mean so much for the Gata.
“Cease fire! I need all units to stand down! That’s an order!” Steve commanded over the open SHIELD line because that was what he was good at. Getting other people to listen to him and follow his direction, without wasting precious time on questions. That and he trusted Coulson to take things from there and get SHIELD and the local authorities in line. “Iron Man, get the girl. Widow’s on her way to you. Hawkeye and I will deal with the others.”
JARVIS replaced the blinking screen with a detailed map showing the guys movements over the last forty-eight hours and Tony didn't know whether he wanted to curse or laugh.
"We'll never be a real pride until we bond," she pressed and Tony rolled his eyes toward the back of his skull. He chugged the rest of his drink and set the glass down on the bar with a thud.
“I took her while you were napping. That’s not a problem is it?” Tony answers with a sharp toothed smile.
Natasha was a harder read. She was too good to let it show, but she had a weakness now. The careful way she held her emotions in check, effectively erecting a wall of silence between their minds was a tell all of its own. The bond was constant, which meant it was nearly impossible to keep that sort of blankness up twenty-four-seven. The fact that it was there at all told Tony enough.
“That was quite the match,” Coulson noted as Tony and the rest of those just finishing the game filed into the observation booth. The agent was eyeing Prince T’Challa speculatively. “Hopefully getting punched in the face isn’t going to result in an international incident?”
just went to show that you never really knew a person. The child in him wanted to wail that she of all people should know him better.
“He also told me that you are the kind of person who hides how sensitive he really is. Or at least it seemed like it, you know. From the TV?” She amended when Tony arched a brow at her in question. “Never mind, the point is that’s pretty stupid Tony. The things that make you weak in the eyes of your enemies are the very things that make you such a great leader.” She admonished, looking up from her tablet with an adorably stern expression that struck Tony as familiar.
“Hey Tony,” Steve greeted back, all soft and fond, and whatever appetite Tony had previously held for actual food slipped away as he took in the sight of him.
It was a familiar problem in business. What needed to happen here was Stark Industries needed to steal a deal right out from under the world powers, and once Tony and Lady Wakanda were in bed together he needed to get her to sing all her secrets.
“Only if you call me Steve.” Steve answered, taking the offered hand and shaking it firmly.  “Sounds like you lost a bet?"
"I'll second that." Bruce murmured with an apologetic smile in Tony's direction to which Clint raised three fingers in silent agreement and Thor slapped the table enough to rattle the fixtures on top and declared loudly, "Well spoken, Miss Potts."
Almost as if on cue Amory came running into the canteen, his dark hair looking windswept and his fur standing on end.
As soon as Tony's brain recognized that he was once more standing upon solid ground he collapsed to his knees and hurled as cold shivers seized his body.
“JARVIS?” Tony asked, deceptively calm as he watched the tom sitting outside the doors to his very private penthouse getting to his feet. “Why is Prince T’Challa sitting outside my door?”
“I – he knew you were undercover, somehow.” Steve explained with a visible wince, still not looking away from Natasha. “He even knew what color your eyes were. I think he knew because I knew…”
“He’s you. Who is it that you think you are?” Tony asks, cocking his head. His tone is patient and expectant, almost parental. The soldier is tempted to shoot him and just be done with it, but it’s more important to figure out why this keeps happening. Whatever Tony wants, the soldier needs to figure it out first and find a way to eject him for good before it jeopardizes the mission.
He cringed at the deep bloody gashes that seemed to magically appear across his once friend's torso and the gurgled cry of pain Ty let loose as the other tom spun and his barbed tail whipping his barbed tail across his enemies neck almost dismissively.
“I’m sorry.” He gritted out, hand coming up to grab a fistful of hair as he turned about on his heel to face the other man.
Not that Tony needed the gesture to know the moment of truth had arrived because there was an audibly collective gasp from the crowd and the kind of stunned silence that usually proceeded some sort of tragic accident. He turned his head to see what had caused the reaction and froze.
The Cradle was ready and Bruce and Helen as ready as they’d ever be for the maiden voyage of what amounted to a medically revolutionizing procedure. If it was a success their patented technology would change the shape of the world. Well, correction. Kats can’t own patents (unless they inherit them the way that Tony did) but corporations can and Pepper has tied the Cradle and their nanobot tech up in so much legal red tape it would take three lifetimes to untangle it, so bygones.
Generally these contests were undertaken with good humor and boasting, but it wouldn’t be a wedding without a brawl (or seven) and the competitive nature of the Kǫtrdýr was only bested perhaps by those of Asgardians. It was not uncommon for blood to be shed, or occasionally for a hunter to lose their life in pursuit of the powerful Benu. It should be a rousing evening indeed! It could only have been better if Loki were by his side once more, for once he had trusted no one at his back in a hunt so much as he.
“Ms. Cook has been looking all over for these guys. Sorry if they bothered you. They were warned these rooms were off limits.”
Tony almost didn't see it at all, tucked as it was under the tom's shirt, but as Luke knelt down to unlace his boots at DUMMY's insistent nudging it slid forward. It, turned out to be a glossy blue stone hanging at the end of a thick golden chain. There was something about it that didn't sit right with Tony. He knew precious gems when he saw them and though he couldn't bring forward a name for the stone, something about it tugged at his memory. He'd seen it before, or something like it. He knew he had, but the where and the when was the question.
“I must confess I am unfamiliar with your C-Town. But from a young age I learned at my father’s knee the importance of the courting rituals. So, naturally when it became clear that I would be spending a lot of time under the roof of a Queen, I called my sister in a panic and had her ship me some of our best Chelia. They are incredibly delicious but swim in piranha infested waters so our fishermen do not often pursue them.”
And they might be running out of moments. So hey, not Tony's ideal scenario but when had his life ever gone completely according to plan?
T’Cael and Matai were sitting together, both boys whispering furtively in a way that usually spelled trouble. They both fancied themselves inventors and had a knack for biting off more than they could chew.
Tony, reminded of why he was pissed, turned with everyone else to glare again at fury, a muscle in his jaw working as he clenched his teeth. Fury's expression remained stony but he hesitated, which told Tony that he definitely didn't want to answer that question and didn't appreciate being backed into a corner over it. He hissed low, and Pepper squeezed his arm again.
"He sends me something broken knowing that I won't be able to resist trying to fix it, he knows me and he knows more about my biological imperative than I even do at that point, and he's banking on the fact that once Clint is in here," Tony tapped his chest emphatically, "that I won't be able to walk away from what they're selling. And he's right. I take the bait, even when I know there's a hook.
Surely it wasn't Luke's dream to work for SHIELD the rest of his life? He wondered what Luke's dreams actually looked like, what had driven him from his home in the Congo in pursuit of the next to impossible for their kind. Tony wanted to know, and if he were honest, there was a growing part of him that hoped there was room in there possibly for a few new dreams.
When he had the urge for a home cooked meal Bruce went to the common floor; because he’d inadvertently started that trend when it had just been him and Tony in the tower before the others had moved in.
Tony Stark would be calling her personally to congratulate him, kind of flew out the window when she looked at him like she didn’t know whether to shake him or burst into tears. She got that look a lot since Uncle Ben had died.
Steve glanced over to the other side of the gym where Tony had migrated toward the observation booth in order to entertain their guests while the rest of the team got dressed and stretched. He was already suited up in the armor, and was currently hovering a foot or so off the ground in order to converse with those in the booth.
It was all there in her file of course but subterfuge wasn’t the strong suit of domesticated kats, so if there were any holes in her story he was confident he could sniff it out. Though come to think of it, there wasn’t much scent to speak of coming off the girl. There was enough for him to be able to tell that she was a fel, but she was wearing some sort of scent dampener that made her scent seem very faint. About as noticeable as catching a whiff of someone baking three floors up.
“He wasn’t.” Princess snapped suddenly, the playful mood disappearing between them at the brittle edge to her tone. Tony felt like a heel.  It was too easy to forget. Even though Princess had a photo ready mask of confidence, she was carrying around a tremendous amount of grief for the family she’d lost. Most especially for her papa. She had a way of breathing around the word,
Luke's eyebrows raised in surprise at Tony's intimate knowledge of his background and the engineer heaved a sigh of irritation as he stood up from his chair, shoving his hands in his pocket.
“It is natural for a tom to mark their partner. It’s a fascinating science. When we are intimate with a fel, the more our brains come into sync, the fels body will respond to ours and produce a matching scent. It is an excellent way for a tom to judge compatibility and to ward off competition. It’s all on the drive I gave you.” He explained, tapping the small disk he’d placed on the table between them at the start of the meal. “I find it particularly calming when a fel I’m interested in wears my scent. It’s less pleasing when that scent changes to match another.”
Steve gritted his teeth, wanting to call the man out on his bullshit but mindful of the rules Pepper had laid out for them. Ross hadn’t really said anything worth getting upset about and embarrassing the team over.
For an anxious moment Tony thought that Steve was so pissed he wasn’t even going to dignify him with a response, but then he heard Steve sigh over the com, frustrated and fond all at once as he said, “Always.”
She and her brother are like him, weapons created for the empire, but they are different too. They came willingly, so they were allowed to keep all their memories. Their memories of terror and loss are what fuel them through the pain of rebirth and the rigors of training.
"Like you ever doubted it. Where the hell are we?" Tony glanced around, trying to get a feel for the neighborhood by the people passing by and the cars lining the street, but honestly this had to be the most non-descript strip of New York city in existence. Blue collar, lots of pleather and cheap stockings. A couple of paint jobs and a hipster bar or two saved it from being downright seedy.
The strange woman grips Mama's face and talks at her in Hebrew before pressing kisses to her wet cheeks.
“Have you not wondered why prides form around a Queen?” Prince T’Challa asked with a hint of a smirk, unable to hide his pride as he said, “The Queen brain is the alpha predator and those who would be prey are wise to find a protector. I give my Queen fealty, and she protects me from other Queens who could make a meal of me. So you see Mr. Stark, if you wanted either my mind or my heart, you'd have to go through my mother, and she is a formidable woman."
“I have an extremely advanced A.I. who could find a needle in a haystack.” He patted the kids back stiffly in what he hoped was a comforting way. “Now move. Trust me to take care of it.”
As much as Tony wanted to thumb his nose at (not)Luke’s advice he wasn’t going to play around with Bruce’s life. He and Natasha had bonded under duress and Tony well remembered the agony of it, and didn’t pretend not to know how close they’d both come to perishing. He still wasn’t completely sure what had tipped the scales towards survival. So Helen was there along with a SHIELD medic because Pepper had insisted and Tony couldn’t deny the need.
Obie puts pressure on them for more deals, more contracts, more weapons. Always more. They meet every deadline because fuck all the people whispering about how they can’t hack it, how they’ll drive the company into the ground. And fuck Stane for ever doubting that they could.
They'd kissed before this, but Tony didn't misunderstand the question. Steve was asking if he could kiss Tony with meaning, with declarations and commitment attached. Once more now with purpose. No more wandering eyes, no more side flirtations. A kiss, like a promise. A promise they'd make to each other.
“Then we’ll help him,” Steve murmured, leaning close. He kissed Tony chastely, over and done far too quickly for Tony’s liking. So Tony grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back in, deepening the kiss.
So there he was, heart hammering, coming to the awful (wonderful) realization that he might at that very moment be pregnant with Steve’s child, while the man in question had blushed a furious red, and mumbled some apology about getting carried away and not meaning to hurt him – like he thought Natasha and the others were worried because Tony was some sort of virginal milk maid, scared off by a bit of roughness in the sack. And that’s when it had hit them all. Steve had no idea what the so call mating gland was really for.
Oh and it should be mentioned that she had a bracelet full of actual teeth and claws. Like, body parts she'd clearly taken from somebody else.
Time to get up, he ordered himself as he pulled his body out of bed. He wasn't going to get back to sleep and there wasn't much sense in laying in the dark feeling sorry for himself. He was lucky to have survived and wallowing in self-pity was a sorry way to repay the ones who hadn’t.
He’d harassed Clint into joining him that afternoon because the archer needed it, and because Steve knew that out of all of them, being left out was hardest on him.
“Feet off the table Tony, this is not a barn.” T’Challa leaned over his legs to set the mug on the table near him.
Instantly, Tony’s mind flashed to Steve and the way that their bodies cradled one another as they slept, limbs intertwined, but then he remembered that Steve wasn’t coming to bed anytime soon, would likely spend the entire night buried in SHIELD files; and just as quickly something else came to mind. He saw himself getting into bed, and wrapping his arms around T’Challa’s broad chest and seeing what kind of body pillow he’d make.
It’s the Italians who want reformation, who are losing jobs and land to more and more Austrian homes and businesses. It’s the Italians who whisper in corners and plaster posters on walls and ask themselves why they farm, pick, and build for a monarchy that sets them apart and thinks of them as second class.
"What, something different other than dealing with my stubborn ass?" Tony asked skeptically, because lets get real, there were a million other things Rhodey could be doing with his time. Deserved to be doing with his time really.
“And you will be the Panther, just as my brother is. Do you think your uncle is less than I am?” T’Chaka scolded, pausing them right in the middle of the hall with a firm grip on his arm. It was still busy in this section of the palace at this time of day, the holy men trailing up from the temple with the visiting noble men and women from the other tribes.
What made her unmistakable as the Queen was the impressive collar around her throat, for while Tony could spot a few sporting the startling Egyptian looking fashion, hers was well... fit for a queen.
“So quick to call in your debts when we have only just caught our breath,” T’Challa teased crossing over to the bar where Pepper had organized a spread for their royal visitor. He grabbed a cube of cheese off a tray and popped it into his mouth chewing and then carefully swallowing before he went on, “But as you said, a deal is a deal. I have a few medical files I’d be happy to share with you that should help enlighten you on uninterrupted Alurian biology and our known capabilities. Over dinner.”
"I don't know if that's fair Tony," Bruce interjected hesitantly, clearly wary of stepping into the argument, but he was quickly backed by Natasha who sounded bored with the whole thing but unflinchingly certain.
Hi there, so after further developing the "trip to Asgard" portion of the plot I need to split this portion into two chapters. Which just means more story for you in the long run. I'm so sorry I haven't responded to comments yet. Work life is picking up and I'm using my spare moments to keep up with writing. Thank you for leaving them. They're great fuel for a hectic week. next week is shaping up to be just as busy but once more into the breech!
It was galling to admit, but the question was burning at the center of him. That’s what Tony really needed to know. Did he truly see Tony for who he really was, want him for who he really was, and would he be able to put Tony and the Pride first before anything else? Or was Tony going to look inside of him, go reaching for his heart only to find that he truly belonged to Bucky Barnes?
But they need a balance. Sheer grit sweetened with a strong moral center. Remembrance, faith, and above all else unshakable dedication to the indisputable truth that some things can never be sacrificed.
Steve surged forward, mouth covering Tony’s and Tony surrendered to the hungry pressure of his mouth with a groan. The voice in the back of his head that whispered a man like Steve couldn’t really want him (couldn’t really need him) went mercifully silent in the wake of the evidence. Steve held on to him like he might drown if he didn’t.
“Wasn’t dressed for the date,” Tony quipped through gritted teeth. It burned. It positively galled (it terrified). He ignored the slightly stunned but pleased expression on Steve’s face because that level of awe shucks was just uncalled for. Tony wasn’t that much of a loose cannon.
“Have you thought about how Santa is going to get in here when there is a giant hairy goat eating the walls?” Tony asked, archly and laughter rumbled in Thor's chest.
“Would we really call this hallway public?” Tony asked with a baleful stare in the direction of the nearest camera. Jarvis’ eyes weren’t visible to the public of course but Tony knew where every camera was placed by heart.
In what seemed like a split second the confrontation was over, the black-costumed tom already sprinting to Natasha's aide, unworthy opponent left to crumble behind him.
He has no concept of wanting to die, only of a desperate desire to stop (for blissful nothingness) even as the barrage of ice and fire continue in relentless assault.
She'd been dealing with the media practically since the alarm had gone off upstate, and doing her usual bang-up job of it too, but they'd both expected Christine to push back like this. She never had forgiven Pepper for that trash jibe. Rhodey kept warning Tony to stop sticking his dick in crazy and one of these days he was going to listen.
"E.T." Natasha remarked, gently squeezing the little device and watching it close. And Tony's nervousness melted away, seeing that she understood.
Before he can bring that knife down on their throat, Tony shoves the other two under and the forest around them warps liquid and hazy until it rights itself and the hot heat of sand is beneath Tony and the sun beats harshly down upon the soldier’s head.
The pride was just another example of that. A small hope. Terrifying in execution but worth the potential reward. Just as Steve had been affecting Tony's life long before Tony had ever actually come into it and vice versa, they'd changed Bruce's in some very defining ways. There was a web of connections running between them all that frankly had an element of divine design to it.
“Tony’s got a point.” Natasha backed him up. “You’re still new to Gata instincts, and they seem to be pretty strong where mating is concerned.”
Steve’s voice filled his head, momentarily distracting him from talking to Pepper who was calling from Japan where it was roughly six in the morning the next day.
YOU SHOULD HEAR THE SOUNDS YOUR SERVERS ARE GOING TO MAKE IN A MINUTE WHEN I UNLOAD THE PACK-MAN VIRUS.
But it said everything he needed to know, that neither one of them had made an attempt to escape or to hurt anyone. Tony was just fine letting Fury cool his heels. The kits were where they had apparently decided they wanted to be and he had bigger fish to fry at the moment.
"We care about you Tony. We need the facts, even if there's nothing we can really do if something goes wrong."
“Though physical separation across great distances is not recommended indefinitely, it does not appear to be fatal. Examination of Captain Rogers, who shows signs of a successfully established bond with a deceased party, does seem to suggest however that permanent separation from a partner can cause a significant break down in cognitive function.” Helen answered with a sympathetic look in Steve’s direction as inevitably eyes drifted toward him. He just nodded, to show that he was listening but Tony read his discomfort with the scrutiny in the way he held himself.
"Naturally,” Tony mimicked her prissy tone. "You're going to make a sizeable donation to the Resilience Rehabilitation Center. You're also going to complete construction for me at a discount that could get you elected for sainthood – so I guess you could say you’re actually going to pay
"But unfortunately last night's shit show has only reinforced people's fears that kats with claws are dangerous and can't be allowed immunity to govern themselves. I intend to show them  otherwise, but it would help me out if the next time you feel like bathing in the blood of your enemies, you got a stress ball instead."
"You get her home safe son." he mimicked as Steve pulled him close to his chest. "Do you hear yourself when you talk, Captain Dad? I bet you're gonna keep looking over my shoulder all night, checking up on her."
“No, that would be extremely rude. I’m inviting Tony to dinner,” the tom answered with a grin, his eyes flicked to Steve who was watching them both now, not quite able to hide his distaste for the idea.
"Yes." Tony replied with a tight smile. "Imagine that. It's a good thing isn't it that Dad decided not to 'tame' me or, I'm sorry, I believe domesticate is the polite term. I couldn't possibly have defended myself or anyone else that day if he had. "
“That I needed the quickest way to get inside his head. I did it didn’t I? I got inside his head,” he answered sluggishly as Natasha laid her fingers against his temple, as if she could still feel the pain throbbing there, even though Tony was pointedly shielding them all from it.
He'd had less opportunity to study his teammates, but with how often they got injured and how little they seemed to care for actual medical doctors (it wasn’t just Tony, even though he was definitely the worst) Bruce, being the resident (unofficial) biologist, had all of their files and had gotten more than a few peeks at what was going on inside them on a biological level.
Clint couldn’t stop thinking about whether or not he had a family somewhere still wondering what had happened to him, if the comic books he'd probably worn thin were going to gather dust in a box somewhere or get thrown away, and if he still believed in heroes now that he was there in a cage.
“Alright we’re done here.” He decided, firing without further warning and though he was not surprised when the blast shattered the tree branch and sent debris crashing to the forest floor with no sign that Loki had ever been there, it didn’t stop relief from making his legs feel weak.
A moment later the Avengers were crowded around his workstation staring up at the holographic files that Tony had spread above the table.
"Aye, many strange beasts dwell on Múspell. The fiercest of which are the fire giants - " Fandral's sentence was cut short however when RaTu batted him over the head with an annoyed swipe of her hand, a low growl rumbling in her throat.
"Certainly not. I've known Anthony since he was a kit. I am suggesting that his handlers should be under scrutiny. I think we can all agree that Stark is an extraordinary boy, but he has a history of volatile, even destructive, behavior that can and should be curbed by his owner. This nation owes Anthony a great debt and we should have asked a long time ago why that isn't happening."
“His name’s Jamie. There’s at least one future where we have a kid so… there’s that,” Tony answered, crossing his arms in a show of nonchalance, voice controlled and even but inside he was at war. On the one hand, there was the rational part of him that realized this was a huge shock to them both and would change their lives drastically. Steve deserved some time to process and figure out just how involved or not involved he wanted to be in the kids life. It wasn’t like Tony couldn’t financially support a child on his own, so baring all the messy emotional shit it was almost like he didn’t even need Steve really. He didn’t. Fuck if he was going to drag the man kicking and screaming into playing father. Hell no. He’d never do that to his kid, not after Howard. If that was how it was going to be, Steve could just go. They were better off without him.
They’re running a company but there is setback after setback. There is always something or someone in their way. Even their own Handler! Especially their Handler.
“Your Papa said all that about me?” Tony asked, ten shades weirded out by the thought and ten humbled. He knew he’d done some good things for Gata over the years, but he also knew it wasn’t nearly enough and that plenty of kats looked down on him for rocking the boat. Bad kitty. So Tony never took it for granted that for a few, he was a hero and a role model.
Natasha was there that very night (or at least what Tony thought was night without windows or clocks to keep track of time) apparently having guilted Bruce into letting her in while Tony napped. But as soon as she was through the doors his head was full of her thoughts and he was waking up, as desperate to see and touch as she was. Tony was as careful as he could be but like Bruce she could definitely feel him banging around up there. If she minded, it wasn’t enough to move and Tony had fallen back asleep with her curled on the bed beside him, her soft purrs rumbling in his ears.
because he trusted Steve to have his back and fight his corner no matter what life threw their way. If that was going to happen Steve had to put his cards on the table.
“That’s good, Stevie. Now come on home.” Bucky’s voice had been soft but firm in his ear, guiding him like some sort of north star when it was too hard to see through the dark of his worry and the anticipation of grief. And then Bucky’s breath had hitched, a telling hesitation behind his sigh before he’d dropped the final bomb.
Yowler might have been the only social media platform designed for kats, but it was still monitored by the government, and now that everyone on the team knew that “Luke from medical” was actually T’Challa Prince of Wakanda, what would have been the point in continuing to use it?
"Sounds like expensive property damage." Natasha countered with a small smile and Thor threw back his head and laughed.
The countdown to Christmas has begun with Tony no closer to finding a formula that works and the team still in the dark about just how dangerous Extremis really is. Things are heating up between Tony and the captain (and not in the sexy way Tony might prefer) and Thor is determined not to repeat past mistakes (or let his friends repeat them either).
Tony collapsed almost as soon as they staggered into the barn, his body sweating and shaking as his body fought a battle it would lose against a virus that was either going to rewrite him or kill him.
His body was trying, which was why he had such a strong craving for fish all the time now. Bruce had figured out just how much energy his body was putting into self-management every day to figure out the kind of nutritional intake he'd need to sustain that kind of performance and the results spoke for themselves.
He was trying to soften the blow, Steve knew that, but it was hard for his smile not to resemble a grimace just the same.
The other kits giggled and Tubby’s ears drooped. Tony gave him a consoling pat on the head, then noticed that Stripes was eyeing the prized location on his stomach speculatively. A look from Tony made him think better of it as the older fel nudged the one Tubby had called Tink until she got the hint and climbed aboard.
“I’m sure you’ll think of something Mrs. Keppel, but you’ll have to excuse me. Pepper’s yanking my leash again.” Tony stepped back with a wink, grateful to put distance between them.
"People usually get put you down for that," he remarked, subdued, glad that Sam had been spared that but wondering how it had come to be.
He stumbled, falling forward, and Tony was there to land a solid punch to the jaw and grab the rifle, attempting to pry it from his hands.
The probability of being woken by a fel's heat calls were even lower in the tower because the walls were reinforced and the only two fels in residence didn't trust strangers enough to risk enticing any random tom off the street into their sanctuary.
“If he was recovered by the soviets they would have seen the serum in his blood. They would have seen it as an opportunity to create a soldier of their own.”
The scent of sleepy kits saturates their skin, strongest coming from the boy in their arms. They can’t see his face entirely from this angle but it doesn’t matter. They recognize themselves in the soft curve of his cheek and the fan of dark eyelashes that rest against them. They can map the imprint they’ve left down to the smallest detail and find the shadow of the boy they used to be.  They don’t need their nose to know who this boy is to them or what he means.
“JARVIS says you have boxes in storage at a mansion but we couldn’t go there so Thor brought some of his.” Harley offered helpfully. He was helping Thor to line the hall in fresh garland made of weaved evergreen.
“He said Resilience! I heard him. Did you hear him?!” Tommy demanded, his white ears flicking back and forth rapidly as he all but leapt three feet into the air from his seat.
Silence fell over the table as if someone had called for it, all the low conversations dying out as everyone turned and looked at Nyota. As if she would know or could do something to make it real for them all. She knew that they wouldn’t actually blame her if it turned out that her crazy plan had failed and they’d been spit into some other universe entirely, but she couldn’t help but feel a twist of guilt. She’d been the one to put the hope into their heads.
There. The buffet block looked to be made of thick steel. It wasn’t perfect but it was going to have to do.
“That won’t be necessary Sir. He is still in the tower.” Jarvis replied, sounding pretty damn close to bashful and Tony frowned.
Robert's smile got a little more tight to match Tony's as he hummed in a thoughtfully disagreeing manner and said, like an adult explaining something to a small child, "As I said, everybody's awful grateful for what you kits are doing, but Howard should never have broken the law Tony. It wasn't fair to raise you up like one of his experiments, and the pressure they're putting on you now with this whole pride thing... Well we're all worried for you back home my boy, and we wanted to be sure and tell you that if you ever need anything you know who to call."
He and Steve walk with Bucky through the streets of Brooklyn and they dance there in a club, alone in a crowd, eyes only for each other.
She was already moving away to sit beside Clint, snatching the rest of her fruit, her mouth curled in a smirk. Rhodey was chuckling into his coffee and Clint was outright howling with laughter.
The team was gathered near the elevator, all in their suits except for Steve, who was in army dress (because he got the luxury of dressing however he chose and not as someone's fantasy fetish) and Natasha who had gone with a slinky but elegant evening dress.
“Can’t be us. We’re well and truly out there and Clint and Phil are even more ancient news than we are.” Tony prattled and Steve, smiling fondly, gently touched his elbow, as he introduced his new friend.
" Natasha nodded covertly in the tom's direction and Tony bit back the urge to indignantly insist that he had not been licking his lips, he wasn't a complete ingrate, in favor of giving the tom another once over until he spotted whatever it was that Natasha was so caught up on.
“Aye, but she was not raised in a Pride and to many that is reason enough to think her inferior. She will have a road ahead of her to prove herself to her kin.”
He kept sinking, the pain piercing deeper and deeper as he sunk lower into the fog. He wasn’t alone in it. There were people there, men and women in strange garb circling around him, their silhouettes just barely visible through the swirling mist. Some of them were covered head to toe in fur, others like him were more humanoid. Some sang and some chanted, the tongues as varied as their appearance.
The point Steve is trying to make Shelly is that the Avengers are a Pride first.  I mean that’s why we’re doing this right? The team is a family, and it’s very important for us to focus on that identity rather than think of ourselves as some sort of army.
“In theory, anything is possible. But to reverse engineer my armor based on sight alone, frankly they’d have to be smarter than I am.” Tony denied and the words hung heavy in the silent room. He wondered if they could all hear the fear in his voice the same way he could. He wasn’t afraid of the possibility of running into someone smarter than he was. Tony was arguably only the second smartest person in the known universe (fucking Reed Richards) but only an idiot actually thought they could hold the metaphorical crown forever anyway. That was the way of the future. Sooner or later somebody smarter gets discovered.
"Don't say that." Steve was frowning, maybe at Tony's choice of words, or maybe just because Tony's reaction hadn't been what he was expecting. But really what had he expected? It was 2013, even if interspecies relationships weren't legally recognized nobody was going to harass them in New York for being together someplace normal. Someplace not a fetish joint.
Tony reached hoping that she’d hear despite the distance. He didn’t hear a response but he felt her moving in his mind, a light caress of comfort that seemed to him to say she knew.
And of course, there was the fact that physical exercise just helped clear Steve’s head almost better than anything else. Not as well as sex, some mocking voice whispered in the back of his mind, and he blushed thinking of the way Tony’s way too talented tongue liked to move when they kissed and the way his tail liked to curl around Steve’s nearest appendage all soft and insistent.
Teasing aside, Steve had been right to worry. Privately, though he still complained about it outwardly, Tony was grateful for his sessions with professor Xavier. That first week Charles had stopped by daily to give Tony a crash course in keeping his shit together, but they’d tapered off to every couple of days and now to once weekly.
"Maria? Maria Carboni you absolute Schtnker! Wait right there-" The woman turns her head to holler back inside the room, "A cold Isiah you lying fool! You've never been sick a day in your life. Oh why didn't you tell me she was coming."
None of the guests besides the Kǫtrdýr could feel it happening of course but the hall grew eerily hushed as Bastet wove the two together. Of course mating was possible without a Queen's involvement but the Queen brought her power and the power of the whole Pride behind her. Only a bond reinforced by the Queen was unbreakable.
“You did not sleep well.” Wanda comments as the three walk quickly back towards the apartment they are renting. This mission requires becoming natives of this city and aliases that will not be questioned if they should come under SHIELD scrutiny. Director Fury is not a man who takes security lightly, but he is out of his depth. He doesn’t know the enemy was already in his home before he bought it.
Rhodey who is smart and knows when to hold his tongue but doesn't mince his words where it matters and is the first person brave enough to see how stupid Tony really can be sometimes (how flawed) and loves him anyway.
He'd done it now. But that had been the plan, he reminded himself. He'd been terrified of taking this step when he'd been obsessing over the future in his lab designing his idea of Pride, but that little display of temper from Fury had gone a long way towards confirming his suspicions.
The cancer has been the work of a few years struggle now, so it wasn’t like Tony hadn’t known in the back of his mind that this day would come. So why is he dreading this so much?
“It makes the most sense.” Tony replied. “I know the Pride needs a Queen but there are others out there. You can’t tell me that the Warrior Prides didn’t have a way around losing their Queen.”
Maybe a payment from TERROR R US, his inner Clint supplied and Tony hated himself just a little bit for having an inner Clint at all. He heard Clint yammering away in the kitchen even before he’d walked through the door but he came to a complete stop when he walked in and realized that their resident archer wasn’t alone.
He knew that voice. But Tony couldn’t heed it. He didn’t want to keep breathing when every breath was knives in his lungs.
“Stop me when I'm wrong. You didn’t want to be Queen. You were raised for it but you always wanted different. It made you rebellious . Probably drove your parents nuts insisting on galivanting through the galaxy sowing your wild oats. You had a string of conquests but he was different. He was the real deal, only mommy and daddy didn't approve. Probably threatened to cut you off if you didn't come home and start taking your responsibilities seriously. You left him and the kid behind the same way you found him, on a whim, and you never took a consort in all this time because deep down you know nothing else is going to compare to what you turned your back on."
“I lost him, not long after. Three or four weeks, maybe. He was acting stranger than usual, going feral on us… it could have been the war, could have been any number of things. We really did deserve everything he wanted to throw at us. But I can’t stop thinking now, that maybe his moods were driven by the fact that I got him pregnant. And then I got him killed.”
"I've put in some of that canned fruit you like. For you and your boy," Mr. Allen says with a low murmur, even though the kit hasn't asked for any. He winks with one kind brown eye and says, "My Marilyn really enjoyed your get together. You're a good boy."
“A little jerky on the takeoff but the landing felt alright.” Clint shrugged and Tony had that look like he was going to take the wingpack off of Clint and start tinkering right there and then. Steve quickly intervened.
“That can’t be good.” Tony muttered. Steve shifted to get a better view of his phone, where JARVIS was helpfully uploading information about the incident and playing the news clip in the corner.
“You goaded him! What the hell were you thinking?!” Steve accused, and Tony didn’t argue the point, too busy noticing that Steve had completely broken through the restraints on his chair, the metal bands still clamped around one wrist. There were angry red circles where the other bands had once rested. All Tony could think about was soothing the pain he must be in, but Tony’s head was throbbing so harshly it was all he could do to keep his barriers up.
Tony’s head was splitting with pain when he came to. Harley was leaning over him anxiously his small hands tapping insistently at Tony’s cheeks. Tony gingerly picked himself up off the floor with a groan. His heart hammered furiously as his chest clenched tightly in pain, his body flushed with heat, but he took deep swallows of air and tried to compartmentalize. The pain could go in this nice little box here and he’d deal with it later. Glancing blearily around he didn’t see Mrs. Keener anywhere and suspected she’d finally decided to make a run for it. He wondered if she’d even tried to take the boy with her.
Princess turned her unusual eyes on Sonia with coldness, not quite able to hide the fury behind her gaze as the woman’s inquisitive grey eyes regarded her curiously in return.
Steve startled out of his thoughts at the sound of the unfamiliar voice. He turned, surprised to find the owner of that voice was a dark skinned kat he didn’t know. He was in the company of Rhodes though, so Steve tried to school his expression towards friendly rather than suspicious.
“Awful, at the end.” he interjected softly. “But it was beautiful before that. You’re beautiful and I’m honored that you’d let me know you like this.”
“One, I’m not stupid. I can put two and two together as well as the next guy. Two, he’s honest with me about it. He tells me when he’s missing him, and when… when my hopes and dreams don’t necessarily align with reality, but that’s okay because he cares about me. The past is the past, but right here and now, Steve and I care about each other and we aren’t hiding from the hard shit or holding back. So I call bullshit, on the Steve can’t love Tony because he loved Barnes first train of nonsense.”
But the minute Tony started thinking about the possibility of bonding with Steve his heart started to pound, and he could barely restrain how eager he was. In truth he and Pepper had so much more to do they could have stayed at it all night, but she got tired of Tony’s twitching and longing looks toward the door and finally called it quits.
“We.” Natasha flicked her tail in irritation, her ears twitching atop her head as she lifted Tony’s eyes to hers by the hand sunk in his hair. “We try and bring him back. As a team. As a family. It is not all on you, or Steve, though he’ll think that it is.”
“We are putting the first pride on American soil together Stark.” Coulson pointed out, sounding tired, and there was a part of Tony that felt uncharitable (low even) for being such a pill about it given how majorly he’d fucked up that night; but Tony had never been good at holding back and his mistakes aside, it was the truth.
“How will that affect your work as Avengers?” Coulson wanted to know, and Thor echoed his worries, wanting to know how a potential bond could affect the team with his frequent need to return to Asgard.
“J, give us the footage from the stores again.” Tony instructed and the A.I. immediately complied, the grainy security footage recorded at the onset of the event beginning to play again on the large screen. It’s all normal at first. Shoppers going about their business, enjoying a little weekend shopping until suddenly a kat in silver armor jumps up onto a jewelry counter and begins shooting randomly into the air, presumably shouting for everybody to get down by the way people start diving for the floor.  He’ accompanied by two others, both noticeably shorter and as Tony carefully watched their movements he thought to himself, younger. They were kids, and they weren’t shooting as randomly as he first thought.
With the date of the surgery looming, Bruce and Tony get their bond on but Fury has a surprise that shakes up all of their well laid plans.
Them being Strucker and the others, but it’s not just them. She means all humans. Wanda may have chosen this fate but she is still a kat. She knows that the choice was just an illusion.
Tony pinned Peter with a rather serious look and continued, “First things first, you and I need to have a talk about what happened that night at Oscorp. It’s important that the Avengers catch the thieves before they can hurt anyone. You do know why, don’t you Peter?”
"Congratulations?" He quips with a surprised eyebrow lift in Coulson and Clint's general direction. "Did you finally win that bid to appear on Supper Nanny?"
“Steve." She looked at him again. "You should always expect that Tony’s going to be thinking ahead of you. Stark will hold something close to his vest in one hand even when he’s showing you something with the other.”
Well not solely, Tony amended. Forcing himself to do as T’Challa had advised, and start thinking like a Queen. Tony looked to Clint (healthy, whole, safe but still too far away) and listened to him banter with Natasha, and thought they’d also have the Avengers; and they were going to grow. He’d make sure of it.
There. Steve’s shoulders drooped, feeling heavy as he finally said the words aloud. Tony had been through so much, and had given him such a gift of trust and he’d completely and utterly screwed him over.
“JARVIS, appropriate theme music!” he called out, waiting in anticipation as the A.I. left him in a moment of judgmental silence. And then the tiny sounds of 90’s pop music began to fill the lab and Tony threw back his head and laughed.
He gripped his hand tighter on the wheel and let his foot press heavier on the gas. Ready or not, some things just came your way and there was nothing to do but meet them head on.
"You are a worthy Captain, and a warrior of distinction Friend Steven. I am honored to fight beside you and under your command; but Anthony is Queen. It is a truth we must recognize. You most of all, if you are to have a successful union."
He’s not going to let his insecurities and his over active brain spoil what is so far a very good thing between him and Steve.
Wordlessly Steve reached over to turn off the stove and Tony took his hand drawing him towards the bedroom. When they were inside and Steve had closed the door behind them he turned into his arms, and just as before Steve met him as if he’d anticipated the move. They moved in sync, extensions of each other and Tony purred in delight as Steve’s warm mouth moved against his, pouring out his passion.
“Present company excluded of course. We should get going if we’re going to be fashionably late instead of irritating.”
There was a knowing look on Bruce’s face, a sadness that seemed to hang over his shoulders as he gestured with his head towards the door and said with an understanding little half smile, “duty calls.”
“I agree.” The soft feminine voice of their mate lilts as she enters the room behind them. They don’t turn to see her. It’s like they’re scared to.
"It was a nightmare. They can't hurt him anymore, or you." Tony insisted when she fell silent. She gave him a look.
They stagger from the jeep, gunfire and bombs exploding in their ears as they scramble for shelter. Their heart is hammering in their chest as their nose fills with the scent of blood and death. Smoke and sand cloud their eyes and a high whine fills their ears as a missile arcs through the air and dives into the sand not far from them.
“Yeah baby I know, it sucks. Do you want to come back to the tower with me or stay here with Bruce and Amory?”
There was little place in the world for a child of his body right now, and perhaps even less so for whatever JARVIS would become if they broke that final barrier. Maybe one day they would, because Tony's brain was so much better connected now, so much faster and more efficient than it had ever been, and he saw the way now.
Ross is right. He’s just looking out for his daughter and they are selfish for endangering her, selfish for even looking at her. What kind of a life would she have with them anyway? The life of a degenerate. Ostracized and shunned. All of her promise and potential wasted. She doesn’t deserve that (him). She deserves to be happy.
He put it out of his mind but had to pick it back up again when Phil approached him about the collar and later again at the gala at the end of the month.
He knew she didn’t just mean about the island. She meant all of it. The island, his struggles with extremis, the fact that he’d bonded with her and was thinking of building a Pride (on certain conditions). Yeah all of it.
The second important point to remember here was that however unpleasant coming to grips with ones own prejudices could be, realistically it was bound to happen on both their ends, so it wouldn't be helpful in the long run to hold a grudge.
He has to get them out of here in one piece, preferably with the mission completed, but if it comes to it Ivan will abandon the mission in a heartbeat to protect them both. Protect the children. He’s done it before. He remembers that now.
"It's been awhile Tony." Ty began, all confident grin and white teeth, as the bartender slid another cocktail Tony's way and Tony barked a laugh in response.
Rain. Tony decided as he took a slow breath in, letting their scents mingle together on his tongue. They smelled like a fresh rain in spring, when it kicks up dust and pollen just before it pours. Just before everything gets washed clean. Cleansing.
The virus had not only revitalized the damaged and underperforming portions of his body, it had unlocked many of the dark areas that the human brain (Catus or otherwise) did not use in the first place. The effects on the brain had been different with each of the test subjects the virus had been used on, with many developing strange "super powers" across a wide spectrum.
‘Are you alright’ his eyes asked, and she let her brooding slide away for the time being. She was getting awfully maudlin lately, and sooner or later she’d deal with the root cause, but now she needed to focus. She nodded slightly in answer to the unspoken question and turned her attention back to their guests.
"Is this a game to you Tony?! You know how unstable that damned virus is and yet you just put countless lives at risk, especially yours!" Steve pressed closer, lips curling in snarl as he got in Tony's face. "You had no right to challenge my orders!"
He wasn't going to run away, Tony determined holding tightly to Steve's back. Not this time. To hell with self-doubt. Pity party over. No more demeaning himself and his relationships. He was fucking Ironman and Captain America never quit. If the two of them couldn't make it work then it wouldn't be for holding back.
Tony’s voice cracked as another stab of heat twisted in his belly and he closed his eyes, riding it out with a shudder. He stayed still until it had passed, panting for breath. He licked dry lips and exhaled slowly before opening his eyes again to meet Steve’s darkened ones. His arousal was thick in the air around him, storm clouds burgeoning in the middle of their rain storm, but Tony wasn’t afraid.
Steve looks like a child whose just been told he’s won Christmas for the rest of forever, eyes wide and sparkling as he asks all breathless, “Really?”
She stood over him, numbly terrified in a way she’d not experienced since she was a kit watching the house burn down around her.
“Good. Get him out. We’ll rendezvous at the jet with the one we caught. The other is still at large. Be careful.” Steve answered as Tony glared up at the slight figure crouched on the ceiling not far from where he’d landed.
Tony blinked slowly and barked a laugh, ignoring Killian entirely, he twisted his neck to stare at Stone.
“I wish I could Pep,” he responded with an air of gravity. “But public safety waits for no kat. Cap’s been making noise about getting the team back on a regular practice schedule and he wasn’t thrilled with our performance when we were two down this week. You know what they say, heroes never rest.”
She didn’t have a crush on Barnes, of all toms. That was just ew. And no. Jaime was… well Jaime. He’d always been her best friend. Hers, not Anna Jones or anyone elses, and she just didn’t like the thought of him getting all dopey about some fel someday and forgetting all about her. Was that so hard to understand?
Natasha got stiller and Steve’s shoulders tensed, but he nodded, glancing to Natasha for confirmation. The fel woman just swished her tail, as if the morning were like any other, and they weren’t about to embark on a quest to draw out a deadly assassin.
But as Luke kept so helpfully pointing out. Tony was building a Pride, and that meant no more slinking off to a dark corner to (possibly) die in privacy. His team (his family) deserved to know the details, especially because of the high risk.
“I realize that you are angry with me,” T’Challa sighed in response, clearly still not convinced though small smile had appeared again on his too pretty mouth. “I accept your taunting as my due. But I hope that if you are willing... perhaps you will spare me a dance?”
“Save me some hot water,” he said instead, the words rumbling a little in his unexpectedly tight throat and Steve smirked leaning close to whisper in his ear.
Bonding or no bonding people were still going to be people, and just because she saw him up close and personal didn’t mean Natasha was going to think any better of him than anyone else.  Well, Tony couldn’t change who he was and he wasn’t about to start now.
Still, Natasha had a point. Steve needed to be doing a better job of socializing with his fellow guests instead of obsessively watching his boyfriend hold court at the head of their table.
“Consuming the Benu provides one with sight. It is believed that after a few generations of consumption that the Kǫtrdýr developed the bonding abilities that were passed down to the Alurio but that was after hundreds of years. I must agree with Banner. Developing such a strong link to a stranger’s mind after only one consumption seems unlikely.”
"Aye, the Benu's wings are the colors of sun and fire. Some say the first was born at the creation of the world, in the mountains that spit fire into the sky; and that when it dies it is only to be born again from the ash. Surely you knew this?"
He almost thought more to himself than to her but Natasha heard it anyway. Tony and Harley removed the last of the objects blocking the door. It would be useless anyway against extremis powered agents. They’d just have to be quick about this and hope AIM didn’t track them to the barn before they had time to get a defense together.
He stiffened, all good humor fading as his mouth twisted into a snarl, pushing the venomous thoughts away.
"My father in particular I think would be scandalized to hear someone called it that. I shall enjoy telling him." A warm voice above Tony said with a chuckle, and Tony glanced up to find Luke Debar leaning against the back of the couch smiling down at him. Jarvis hadn’t announced his arrival but then again with a party in full swing and an unusual mix of people coming and going it made sense to drop the formalities.
Clint was going to reach them first Tony realized as he watched through a security camera as the two silver shapes, having downed the rest of the officers, go tearing down a hallway headed toward one of the exits.
“What’s a geriatric citizen?” a kitten with a tattered ear asked shyly, and Tony frowned as a chubby little tom snickered at her until she curled herself in a tiny protective ball.
Something about hearing Tony and the others referred to as Bucky's people had broken something inside of Steve. In all that time when it had just been him and Bucky against the world, he’d never stopped to think that maybe Bucky’s world wasn’t so narrow. Maybe Bucky had people he couldn’t leave behind and still be the man Steve knew he was.
So maybe Steve was always going to see the boy lying in the incubator with tubes and wires sticking out of his appendages struggling for each breath, and feel kinship.
“Tony, you’re going into heat.” Steve insisted and at Tony’s shocked jerk he lowered his voice even further, pulling Tony closer by the hand on the small of his back. “Natasha says you’ve been focusing a lot of brain power elsewhere so maybe you didn’t put it together but it’s coming on. I can smell it.”
“Then I wish you all sure hands. But the boy should not be here. His mind is still developing. He may be damaged by the experience.”
It was typical tom posturing, trying to warn all the other toms present he was biggest and baddest and not to get in his way when he rolled some ‘lucky’ fel on their back. Tony’s teammates had gone stiff, ears alert and eyes fixed on the prince as he drew closer, the air becoming charged with fight scent. Next to Tony Steve’s whole body was brimming with tension, but outwardly he looked calm and still as a statue as he watched T’Challa’s every move and Tony’s mouth stretched into a toothy smile.
“You insult me, and here I’ve come ready to offer you a gift that might solve all of your problems.”
Her response was slow in coming but it came with a gentle wave of real affection that helped chase away some of the chill lingering in Tony's bones.
Fitting Tony thought, because he’s getting the idea that he’s looking right at all of Steve’s demons.
Bastet blinked at him slowly and Tony got the feeling she was confused as all get out but unwilling to show it. He grinned.
“Because we were never able to stabilize it. When we began testing on human subjects some of them reacted negatively. There were casualties… the government shut us down. Killian didn’t want to accept that answer, he wanted to keep going. When I refused he fired me.”
As usual Luke held himself proudly and Tony looked on as he somehow made the act of shrugging out of that atrocious coat look graceful and choreographed.
Bruce was frowning at one of the monitors and Helen, who was watching another, noted with a small betraying hitch in her breath, “Patient’s core temperature just spiked.”
"And if they wanted the kats for profit how come there haven't been any other attempted thefts on this scale?"
“I apologize.” T’Challa returned shortly in reply. “I should have been more precise. I meant you are not bonded and you do not share his scent. Among our kind, that means you are still free to entertain suitors.”
It's not long after that when Mama wakes him up after Papa has left for the yard. As she dresses him she asks him if he can keep a secret. Tony might only be two but he's exceptionally smart for his age. He can already read on his own without Mama's help. He nods his head eagerly and Mama smiles, though Tony thinks it does not reach her eyes like it should.
Tony touched his wrist and made a soft sound in the back of his throat, his scent going sweet in appeasement without much thought as he offered the tom an apologetic smile and murmured, “I know Bruce.”
"Look Cap, I don't let people into my space, let alone my lab, unless I know everything there is to know about them. Debar's public records, besides being squeaky clean, just happen to be some of the more impressive I've seen." Tony stopped in front of Steve, trying to impress his point without the conversation degenerating to their history of finger pointing and name calling.
The only thing missing was Natasha, sitting with legs folded in the lazy boy while she pretended to do serious work on her phone, but was actually driving the internet trolls wild decimating their scores in Candy Crush. Clint lazing on the couch watching some trash program with a bowl of fruity pebbles, probably complaining about the fact that JARVIS had stocked pebbles this week instead of fruit loops or some shit. Bruce sitting beside Helen, discussing some new theory and trying not to look smitten. Harley sprawled on the floor with his school books, trying to explain the nature of homework to Thor.
Looking up at the others once more, his gaze caught Steve's and stayed there as he took a breath before the plunge. "I have something I want to share with you all, but it's... Later. It's for later."
It was warm in her palm and with the pressure of her grip she heard the mechanical whine of mechanisms shifting and releasing. When she opened her palm the little metal box had opened down the middle where a soft blue light was now emitting from the crack in slow measured blinks.
Natasha prompted, already scrambling up the side of the column, reading his affirmation over the bond without Tony having to so much as say a word of agreement. Halfway up she dug her front claws deep into the plaster striking the steel center with a clang.  She propelled herself backward, using the traction from her claws as they ripped through plaster and drywall, in order to swing herself around to kick the assassin firmly in the backside.
Ivan says that it’s a mistake to fall in love. But (she) was always going to love the one who saved (her) saw (her), the one who needs them more than they’ll ever need him. The soldier gave them life before they ever thought they deserved it, and now that they are damned and know they definitely don’t, they can only treasure the gift of love all the more.
It was a little slice of heaven on a cold winters night, and Tony could appreciate how romantic a gesture it was. Business dinner his ass. The cuisine was his favorite (curtesy of his mother, who had never let being sold to a French jewelry merchant make her forget her roots in Sicily) the private setting was just as he secretly preferred (no plastic smiles and carefully crafted masks for the cameras) and the song was a childhood favorite. It was kind of touching that T’Challa had put these things together about him and cared enough to cater to his tastes, until he remembered that the tom only had that knowledge because he’d gotten close under entirely false pretenses.
He's read all about sex of course. It’s old news to Tony how babies are made and the physical mechanics are just that, mechanics. He’s not sure what all the fascination and secrecy is about. He might not mind a sibling…
Nakia was there, leaning against the wall opposite the door, keeping a steady eye on Prince T’Challa and Coulson was there too, sitting in a seat beside Clint, watching the goings on in the operation room with a laser attention that almost rivaled Steve’s own. Steve hadn’t taken his eyes off of Tony since Bruce had kicked them all out of the room so that he, Helen, and T’Challa could get things properly underway.
Steve had no idea what he was talking about but judging by Senator Stern’s venomous glare, Tony had likely hacked somebody’s computer again for information he shouldn’t have.
The two traded banter as they left the gym and everybody allowed themselves to be entertained by it and weigh in when necessary, silently agreeing to ignore the elephant in the room for the time being.
The trouble with humans and Earth before their parents had founded Resilience, was that all legal Gata residents were registered with the government and collared.  Nyota and her cousins had already taken care of the getting the collars part, no thanks to the Avengers who had shown up and made things twice as hard as they had to be.
“Epeja.” Luke answered readily, dark eyes settling on Tony as the fel sniffed at the bowl of orangey looking stew, whiskers twitching. It smelled nice enough.
The man the soldier was before this was not so willing. A blind fool, unable to see the might of the empire, and so he had to be crushed and stripped of everything.
Bruce wanted to ask if Tony was the first fel that Steve had ever watched go into heat, but it felt too nosey. He tapped down on the rise in anxiety by focusing on his breathing as he chose a mug from the cupboard.
That said, there will be plenty of romances to go around, but Tony's eventual mate is going to end up being whichever individual (or combination of individuals) serves the family the best, because families are good and these poor guys are overdue for some good. (Looking at you Marvel).
“We’ll find him Steve. Sooner or later he’s going to surface somewhere, and we’ll be ready.” Tony assured him. Steve mustered a smile in response but it was thin.
“Not intentionally! Right Tony?" Papa hastily interjects, jiggling Tony as if his compliance would come tumbling out of him. Tony's still giggling as Mama marches over to take him from Papa and Papa is saying, "A minor accident but we’ve got it under control here Peach.”
