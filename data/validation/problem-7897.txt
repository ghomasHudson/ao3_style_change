Carefully, he raised his arm and threw the part away, out of the cave. It did not fly far, and when Tony reached for the next part, he changed his throwing position as best he could.
As if at a command, the two aliens stepped aside and another person stepped out from behind. "No," Tony whispered and then shouted, "No!"
teve had written. Tony snorted.
He typed it in and limped into the anteroom, accessible to most agents and Avengers. The transparent glass gave a good view of the untidy workshop. But Tony's eyes stopped in front of the second security door. The alien lay there, dead and ugly, dumped by people who obviously didn’t think too much about how to shift the alien gently. Tony rolled his eyes when he saw that the thick body lay on top of one arm so that it was certainly damaged.
?" Steve read the headline aloud. "
Steve stared in horror at Fury, who turned on the spot and walked to the elevator. Hill and the other agent didn’t move. The others had their eyes fixed on Fury, his back to them before the doors closed.
I wish you a nice day and to all Americans out there: I'll wish you a nice day after you've been voting.
Slowly he went to the closet. Beside the shield laid a letter and an old cell phone.
He did not do anything about them. He quickly dodged a stone that had passed dangerously close to his arc reactor.
"Hey," he said, trying to sound calm and strong as he knelt beside her. "It’ll be alright. You're out of here soon. You're all out soon," he said to the other two.
"Barnes, do you have any more to tell us?"
"His daughter and wife were killed in the same grenade attack as the six-year-old son," said Clint. "He joined the company a year later. He has not even been seen to attend therapy. His father died right between the death of his family and his joining to the company. He had inherited a considerable fortune from him. He bought shares and multiplied the money. Partially the media spoke of the miracle man. He rose so quickly into the ranks of the multiple millionaires."
I wasn't quite sure when I wrote this whether this was way to fast with Steve being in the workshop after what had happened, and also with Tony kind of protecting Bucky, but it felt right to me in the end, so I kept it. I hope it isn't too bad for all of you.
Tony clapped his hands and ran as best he could, without showing his pain, to the big table in the middle of the room.
"A few hours ago, there was no alien ship that attacked the East Coast. We have to look for Tony, the government can’t forbid that!" Steve exclaimed, taking a step closer to Fury.
It made no sense for him to search for more information. The best SHIELD agents were set and Friday went on and on. But Burkwill had been careful. They could confirm the three states, but nothing more. At least the mechanic could use his arm again, and his ribs did not hurt too much anymore.
"It's going to be hard, Cap," Falcon replied through the com, "in front of the entrance is a whole horde."
"What's that?" Steve asked the artificial intelligence that was also installed on the plane. He nodded toward a very long island that built up like a wall off the coast.
Only after a short break, the third agent spoke up. He had an unusually high and soft voice for his height and stature. "Stark is now a matter for the government and SHIELD. Residents and professional teams will search every square feet. The time remaining before the next attack must be used by excessive training to prepare us. Not only the United Nations and the inhabitants of any place on this planet rely on your commitment; even Stark does, for when he returns. He will want to find a working and solid attack plan. Your job will be to train together, as a team, as the Avengers, and be ready when you need it to be." He stood still for a moment. "You shouldn’t spend your time looking for Stark, but for team building and strengthening. With training and investigations.”
The Russian sighed. "How are you today?"
A message had been sent to Steve, and Tony quickly read it. There was a technical issue that was called due to a server overload. In retrospect, traces of foreign IPs were found, but still could not be assigned. Tony sighed as he read the further description of the problem. Then he handed the phone back.
"I thought he was jogging with you?" Clint asked, reading a report.
Burkwill looked at a wristwatch, then the grin widened. "I did not give any of my employees something valuable. The smartest of them, Lady Elise, has an IQ nearly forty points below yours and even she is still predictable. The rest of my workers are even worse: Peter Krum, Kima, General Astif, you know. The whole range of criminals who put their hopes on me to kill you. Because you have wronged them; because their families died because of you. Because you're the monster you claim to fight."
"Boss, I cannot see the screen," said Friday. "The program does not let me see the window, but everywhere in the headquarters, it should be on screens. Rogers is on his way to you."
"Do you need anything else? Something to eat or drink? A bedtime story?"
Tony frowned. "Humans?"
"As long as the negotiations are not over, he shouldn’t leave the headquarters alone, that’s what I was told. It's easier to stay here."
If you kill me, then I am with my children and my wife. Then my earthly life is over and I’ll see my family again, and I won't have to think about you monsters anymore. In any case, it will be better for me.
He could not, not now. He knew he had promised to get more involved, but he could not. Not after such a secret was made public, and not when he was not sure how he would react to the others; if he had his emotions under control.
It was Tuesday, two weeks later, when Tony was staring at the phone in front of him. "I didn’t know that your wife could bake so well," he eventually brought out and looked at Clint. The archer grinned. "The eighth best thing of her!"
"It’s important that none of you seem nervous when addressing this very sensitive issue. I expect complete commitment from you. In addition, the government should see that they have done the right thing to free all of you from your allegations."
And they had one last thing in common, Tony noticed: they both played great pieces by Steve Rogers.
"Well, that worked," Tony rejoiced. "Friday? Would you be so good and close the door again? Oh yeah, play the New York press conference when it starts. And until then; music please!"
had happened. He didn’t want them to know. It was unfair against Steve and Barnes.
She shook her head. "Nothing that doesn't heal again."
Steve released his hand from Tony's back to wipe his face. The mechanic took the opportunity and pushed away from him. Steve's eyes were red and swollen when Tony looked at him. "Seventy years ago, the world had thought that Captain America died, forever. And yet you are here. And Bucky, too. You have both been frozen for a lifetime. He can get a few bullets, Steve. Hey, do you want to go to him? That might help."
The man was talking to agents again and tapping his watch before turning and staring at Barnes. "Rogers, Stark, you knew about that?"
"I'll stay in the living room," Steve said into the silence that had once again spread. It was unusual that they all talked so little, Tony noticed, but probably his colleagues were all as tired as he was.
Tony looked at Steve and Natasha, who both raised their eyebrows. "The older one asked if the creature still says what it should say and the boy said yes. I remember exactly what he said then.
The lights of the houses were all off, rarely could you hear a dog barking when his master came back from the tiring work in the evening just to ignore his pet and put his feet up. Probably the wife would bring a cool drink quickly and then put on the TV with the football program, Tony thought.
"Oh," confessed the other. Now
Their footsteps echoed in the garage as the three got out and headed for the entrance to the building.
When he finally gave up his night's sleep, it was just before seven in the morning. The whole tower was still quiet, only sporadically could the mechanic see agents running in the big park. He was not hungry himself, but the pain began to fade away. Quickly he swallowed another tablet, foreseeing that this condition would not last long. At five o'clock he would have to go to the meeting, and until then he had a lot to do. With the elevator, he drove to his workshop, entered the codes and entered his own area.
Steve didn’t move, but he knew it was true. Rhodey glared at him angrily, as if trying to get something out of Steve. The soldier didn’t know what he would have to do to prove he didn’t want to hurt anymore. It was clear that Rhodey did not believe he would care for Tony, but he wanted to prove him wrong. Nevertheless, he said nothing.
Vision tried to push away from the knife and seemed to want to say something but Burkwill kept his mouth shut. Tony's eyes were on the android. He did not know what to think - if what he did was wrong right now, or all the time.
The cameras first showed the crowded room and were then focused on the wooden table, which was being used by the Avengers, who were greeted with applause. Cameras zoomed in on Steve and Tony made a face as the man waved awkwardly at the cameras.
"I just did my job!"
Two new men came running from the bridge side toward Tony and forcibly tried to pull him away from the
"I'm going downstairs," Tony pressed between his teeth. He had to get out of this room.
Clint shook his head. "No concussion, no amnesia, nothing. Everything stays the same. The painkillers work and Tony has made clear to go for a quick start of the therapy."
So, yeah. That was all a little rushed. But I don't really feel the story anymore, you know? I'm just gonna finish this with the epilogue next weekend and then I'll forget about this, haha.
The explosion was loud and powerful. Both Tony and Rhodey were thrown back. Just like before, the mechanic only heard the beeping in his ear. Then it was suddenly dead quiet.
are the reason for what happened?
The man chuckled. "This woman can bite and kick hard, you have to leave that to her."
"Weapons down," Tony repeated, angrily. His eyes fixed one of the young agents so he would not have to see what was happening in the video next. But it was like an accident, he had to look. The car blocked something of the view, but he could still see his mother wrestling for her life. Treacherous tears crept into his eyes and he wiped them away with his hand, which Steve did not hold. The soldier moved closer to Tony, showing him proximity. Tony's mother died and Barnes looked at Tony almost imploringly.
"We're going to lose all our lives!" Bucky pronounced his thoughts, waving his arms wildly. “And the civilians down there, too!”
Burkwill grinned as he slid his hand down again and reached into his pocket. His stomach touched Tony's as he moved slightly. The younger man tried to hide the shivering from the cold. He could feel exactly the eyes of the others on him as Burkwill pulled a pocket knife from his pants and opened it. Slowly he put it between the neck and shoulder of Tony but did not press yet. Almost as if he did not want to hurt him. He grinned and then shrugged, then squeezed the spikes in Tony's skin and removed the knife. It was red, but Tony did not flinch a bit.
Tony did not hear him anymore. Steve's hand was still on his arm, not letting off of him as he stared at the spot where the man had just shown himself. He was fifty, at most sixty years old, and looked well-groomed. And he had threatened him, with the death of other men.
"Watch out. I'm not saying that because I want to persuade you to stay, but because I want you not to go alone, Tony. Yeah, we have a problem, a damn big, to be honest," he said, calmer this time, and kept walking toward Tony. He put his hand on the other's shoulder. "But we will
He heard the two men behind him being thrown to the ground behind the bridge. The aliens stopped where they were and Tony could only hope that Wilson and Khatib understood what he wanted to say.
Tony nodded slightly. "I promised not to seek Burkwill," he said softly. "Now I'm looking for Pepper."
Tony felt all the people in the room get more attentive and exchange worried looks. He reached for Steve's shoulder with his hand so as not to fall over. The soldier handed him the glass of water Rhodey had given him earlier. After he drank, it got a little better with his coughing.
"Did I spoil you?" The voice asked through the laptop, innocently. "I'm sorry, but you both knew it all the time anyway. I just want to help. You and your teammates who had to listen to you so often."
But Clint shook his head. "Not necessarily. Devices can also have failed. Or employees. Or the ship never flew past New York. I just remember the Chitauri that came out of a wormhole."
As Fury was about to respond, Vision moved forward.
The elevator doors opened in the moment and several people stepped out. In the front, there were Fury and Natasha walking, who limped a bit. Tony remembered: She was shot, too.
"Where have you been after Ultron? You knew that I was feeling bad. You knew it exactly. Where have you ever been for me?"
"Friday, check the suit again, I have to go upstairs. I want to have all the bugs fixed, I don’t feel like another cave and an explosion in the air ..."
Four agents are in danger and I can and must prevent them from dying. And if I catch the psychopath first, that's good."
Natasha's shoes were not in the entrance, so Tony figured they should continue to wear them and he and Steve put their jackets on a small cupboard that didn’t even close properly anymore. Through the second door on the left, a small woman with glasses in her hand pushed first, and Natasha followed.
Steve had expected it. He closed his eyes and laid his head on his hands and exhaled loudly. "They aren’t looking right!", he finally said and pressed his hands on his eyes.
He added something, but Tony did not listen. His eyes searched the room as he considered what he would do in the next few hours. He certainly could not sleep while they were so close to getting the madman. Or getting caught by him. He swallowed.
"Yes," he said. "He has. He’s transported the trigger for this attack from the ship and made sure that we could prevent bigger damage."
"Yeah, it was, Tony."
For the first time in a very long period of time, he was really hoping for strangers to save him.
Tony could see quick glances from the others to Fury, seemingly just getting new information. He sighed.
He turned his eyes away again and he looked at General Astif pervasively. "A city being attacked would bring nothing but innocent people to die, devastated areas and a too-fast death for Stark."
Steve stared at the floor in front of him and for a moment just heard the silence. He was frustrated. It was true. The danger was real. It could come at any time to another attack. And the agent was probably right.
, he thought, but then looked at Rhodey again. "Are you going to talk about the aliens?"
"I can't do anything. They would kill you."
"Can you fly?"
"The door was not closed, I wanted to look after you." Steve tried to look strong. His shoulders were pulled back and his chest was outstretched. He ran as if he was in the military again, but Tony could tell the man was a bit paler than usual.
"Excuse me," interrupted one of the agents. "But why is the press so fixated on this Burkwill?"
Clint and Natasha also joined, so Tony climbed onto the pilot's seat.
The Figure moved very quietly into the room, no sound was heard. The Person knew exactly that the last visitor had left fourteen minutes ago. Now was the time to go inside. Almost sceptically, The Person watched down at Tony Stark, who lay lifeless on the small, white bed. Sores on the head were sewn and the right arm was sheathed, but The Person needed to know more. Slowly, The Figure pulled the blanket from under the weak arms of the mechanic and opened the hospital clothes with the utmost ease. Although Stark had invested a lot of money in the best equipment, he had insisted on such hospital shirts. They should be better for the patients if the doctor must open the shirts without having to lift the body.
He raised his hands defensively. "Why should I just look in his room?"
"In the background of the video, we can confirm the Atlantic," he continued. "The sounds indicate that the video was filmed nearby a large body of water and this must be the Atlantic. Barton just pointed out that the plane, which you can see in the background," he pointed to a point in the sky that was barely big enough for Tony to see on the small screen, "is just starting up or landing."
He shook his head. Slowly he walked ahead and turned right where the therapy room was. It should begin soon.
"Boss, you were last here at two o'clock in the night, which was just over 3 hours and 30 minutes ago. The security settings make me remind you that more sleep might be healthier for you."
"Oh no," he called in a deep voice.
"The doctors are done," he explained. "Rhodey went to Tony. Those are the files of what happened to him."
Fury looked at him quietly for a moment, then shook his head. "We can’t go for that yet. Search teams from SHIELD and the government are strategically searching all sorts of places from there," Fury explained, pointing to the hologram that was now showing the trails of the search teams.
"Damn it, Friday, remember me to not build that big next time," he murmured more to himself than to the AI.
Tony dropped his head a little. He did not want to hurt her. "I barely had time, sorry, Pepper," he tried to answer. "I was mentally absent a bit, too, I guess.”
"Helmut Zemo has escaped," the other man suddenly said in a much thinner voice than Tony expected.
Only once had James seen this new worker.
When Tony tried to turn his head in the other direction, he was overcome with such a pain that he went black again. He barely heard his own cry of pain, so quickly had unconsciousness overcome him again.
"You're bleeding," the other replied, ignoring the mechanic. Tony looked at his hand. He did not realize he had cut himself. Slowly and carefully Steve came towards him, the door to the workshop fell softly behind him into the lock. Tony himself did not move. Just watched the other man walk up to him slowly. Tony could clearly see the soldier trying to hide the tremor in his hands. The knot in his chest threatened to take his breath away.
"Only then?" he asked himself aloud. "Idiocy ..."
Several news channels from all over the world tried to take pictures and video footage of the incoming heroes and pushed forward. The security officials tried to ignore them but reaped only bad looks and sometimes even slight pushes if the reporters penetrated too far.
Steve had turned quieter and looked at Tony in the end. He sniffed his nose and cleared his throat when he felt he had to cough again.
. Then it would be too late already with your great plans!"
Even though he had betrayed him, the mechanic felt bad as he carried his own dying creation across the battlefield. Rhodey came flying to him and secured his back while Tony came to a stop on the back of the tank. With his repulsor, he defeated an alien who had seen him and got ready for the others, who stood guard over the tank and came running up to him. Rhodey came to a stop beside him, handing a grenade to Vision without words. Tony could feel the hatred that, despite everything, went from his friend to the android. Vision hobbled quickly. Rhodey and Tony were in the field fighting. Sweat was running in his helmet as the mechanic turned and saw three other creatures running towards him. With his energy beams he switched off two of them at the same time, but the third one kept coming towards him. The claws had stretched out and ready to strike. Tony was in shock. Maybe everything had become too much for him, but he could not react anymore.
"You have to go up, the therapy will start right away."
It was faster than expected and Steve could only jump quickly, so the creature had fallen over the edge of the ship and dropped hundreds of feet down into the stormy day.
"These sounds were caused by you, Stark. You know that," the voice said, pausing. "
James investigated the crowd full of surprised-looking people. Inwardly he sighed. Working with less intelligent people was annoying but a duty. To calm himself, he looked at the perfectly symmetrical pattern on the opposite wall. Each of the many lines on the wall could be mirrored on a vertical and horizontal axis. An artistic gimmick that has calmed him for years.
Tony had jumped up and pointed to the ceiling with his hand, indicating the place everyone associated with Friday. It was stupid.
Although Kima could pronounce the strange race’s name perfectly, he apparently did not know anything about them.
Of course, he'd thought about what he could do, calculating everything at his flight from New York to Toms River. But the only way to save the inhabitants of the small city and the nearby metropolis had been to shoot the creature in the air.
Normally, his body would never react that way, but those cursed injuries made everything else impossible.
Over time, the conversations became less and less. Tony and Steve had both talked briefly at first, just to make sure the other one was still there, but then they sank into their work. Both watched the video – which was fortunately recorded - several times and could not tell by any programs or observations where the man was and where the other agents were being held.
The other man had been with James for a long time. Peter Krum, that was the name of the forty-seven-year-old. He had accompanied James for twenty-one years. He had been one of the first to follow his call and join him. Together, the two men had to fulfil a mission that should soon reflect the work of the last two decades. For so long, James had been waiting for this day, for so long he wanted revenge.
The pressure from his shoulders subsided as the soldier took his hands away. In the little light, Tony could barely see what the other one was doing.
"A painting by a Norwegian child is almost identical to the creatures. The picture was uploaded three years ago by the boy's father. The child was nine years old then."
"You all stay here, I need you all," Fury explained, pointing to the Avengers, "as soon as we have more information. We can assume that the man whose identity Agent Barton is about to provides more information about is going to send us more information."
, underneath the picture.
When Steve let his eyes wander, they got stuck at Rhodey. The man stared completely disoriented, now motionless.
, just like he did.
Trembling and sniffling, he reached up to avoid being too loud, repeating words like a meter over and over again. "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck."
Tony could see landscapes, but also cities. Some pictures showed fantasy worlds, which the woman had probably painted, others even fight scenes, which could come directly from a comic, if you could not find Captain America himself in between. Tony grinned at Steve and pointed to the picture and the other’s eyebrow raised in confusion. Only then the woman turned to her and breathed in shock.
Steve sat down exhausted and put his head in his hands.
"Why didn’t you bring Stark here? Or sent him on the ship to a slow death? What was the reason for this? It could all have been over and we all would have gotten our revenge. You have had the chance to finish him."
"Yeah, and?" asked the tired, resigned voice of the billionaire again. "Would you mind so much?"
(See the end of the chapter for
One of them had noticed them, made a thunderous scream, and ran toward them.
Rolling his eyes, Rhodey shook his head. "I can’t be your babysitter. I have to go to New York right away. We have to attend a press conference.  Every single media agency claims to know something different about the great hero of America, Anthony Edward Stark. We’ve got to put an end to it."
She paused briefly and Tony thought of his own father, who tried to solve his own problems with similar methods.
Going down the stairs was easier than going up, but still, Tony's ribs burned after the three floors. But only when they closed the front door did he allow himself to breathe properly. The fresh air was good for his lungs. With his hands, he groped for his smartphone, while Natasha wrote to the driver.
"I have to," he corrected.
They are talking about what alliances would mean for their country, for their patriotism and proudness, but nobody takes a position. There are no demonstrations, no masses of people going out, solicit for help and safety or a stop in their coldness against each other’s homelands."
alone there."
"I just organized a watch quickly," Burkwill chuckled, finally releasing Tony's back. He walked three steps back, while the mechanic heard something big coming up behind him. He turned just in time to avoid being caught in the back by giant claws stretched out by a tremendously big creature. Tony froze when he saw the alien in front of him. He felt again the pain in his stomach and chest, in his arms and in his head when he was almost torn to pieces by a bomb hundreds of yards in the air. It was exactly this alien that he had carried away. His eyes were wide and his brow furrowed so that he could barely hide his surprise and fear.
The two attackers weren’t hurt, so they went directly into a next attack. Falcon, too, had attacked the brain and Clint shot one arrow after the other. With his huge hands, however, the monster struck out as if trying to fish the Avengers and the arrows from the air.
She looked at the three again. "That's why I did not tell anyone, not even my now ex-wife, because I thought I was crazy. It had snowed again and on my way back all traces had disappeared under the snow. I thought I had imagined all this, but then I found this note there with those grunts. And then exactly the same things came to Toms River a few days ago. I was shocked, I sat there on the couch and could hardly look at it. I knew it was the same thing, so that's why I published it, the picture, I mean."
"We have a huge problem and all you think about is how
"It was a river. The tracks stopped at this river. I searched for a long time. There was a ford, I ran over, through the icy water to find the tracks on the other side, but they were just gone. As if those things had been swallowed up by the earth. There's a photo of the footprints that go into the water."
After that, the other monsters made their way to them, slower this time.
"The fight was a little less than two days ago. Tony, I ... I'm sorry. I could’ve prevented all this. I mean - If I had fought the creature. I should have told you about what Bucky - what Barnes did. I didn't want you to feel betrayed. I think - I
Tony grabbed the soldier's arm and pulled the man behind him. "Come on," he shouted in the out race. "We're flying to Boston."
"Fuck," he mumbled again when his cough had calmed down a little.
"You got him, Tony," Rhodey screamed. With a loud splash, the creature finally fell over and became silent. But the cheers of others abruptly stopped. "What the ...", Tony asked himself more than anyone else.
sounds were caused by you, Stark." There was only a crash, and Tony certainly could not associate that with any event. It could be anything: Sokovia, Afghanistan, somewhere in the US. Everywhere where something has broken, where someone died.
Barnes, who shut his mother's throat.
"The former Tony Stark might not have done this."
"There's another problem," Barnes contradicted his long-time best friend. Tony's ribcage rose and fell. "No remains of Stark weapons were found. Wilson should have been equipped with them."
He waited barely a minute before ordering Friday to inform him when the others had left the building.
She had studied the reactions of the Avengers closely and understood that Steve wanted to postpone this encounter. She nodded.
A wave of relief came over him and he had to hold on briefly, to not thank some gods. His hands were still trembling as he tried to wipe some soot from a wound on the mechanic's head.
right.
Tony had told Friday that she should tell Steve that he would not come down again. After that, he had piled a pillow over his sweaty face and tried to fall asleep without worrying about getting rid of his clothes.
The second time he had talked to him was when he had brought them something to eat during the therapy sessions. He had been two days after he woke up, and Steve had been too worried that it would be too early, after three shots in the back, more than twelve surgeries and two times in which his heart did not beat in just three days. He'd asked Tony to bring something to eat because he did not want to leave Bucky because anything could still happen, and Tony had come.
“Let’s keep in touch, keep me updated.” Steve said. “if I can do anything to help...”

Steve just cried into Bucky’s shoulder.
He had just done it again, when all of the sudden he found himself with a lap full of  Tony, his lips occupied by kissing those plump lips back and the taste of wine on his taste buds. Steve kneaded at Tony’s ass.
Steve moaned and bucked his hips so hard Tony almost flew off.
He heard Tony talking, so it was probably the phone of the genius that had pulled him from sleep. He blearily opened his eyes when Tony sighed.
Another smile.
The calls stopped an hour or so later, the texts around lunchtime, and Steve let out a breath of relief. He focussed on his work and grabbed a beer and some Chinese take out on the way home.
‘Glad you’re okay, definitely snapchat tonight.’
Thus, as Tony stumbled through the common room after yet another difficult meeting or negotiation, Steve took matters in his own hands and scooped the tiny genius up.
"Just like that, fuck, you're doing perfect."
She led Steve towards  her car and drove him to his appartement.  She made him take a shower and ushered him into bed.
‘I do, and it feels amazing to play with them.’
For now find the art here
'Steven G. Rogers pick up the phone!’
“Steve, not that we’re going to do that, but do you realise how much the nudes on your phone are worth?” Bucky exclaimed. Steve shrugged.
'Steve?’’
“It’s the best.” Tony  gushed.”it’s every flavour you could possibly want. Ice in every colour.  It’s huge and it’s glorious.”
The most beautiful butt he’d ever seen, all golden tanned skin, a leaking cock trapped between toned legs. Steve groaned as he came, imagining his cock sliding between those bubble butt cheeks or even fucking into the tight hole between them.
Steve couldn’t believe they were doing this, having sex in semi-public. He'd never pictured himself the type for that, but Tony .. oh Tony made him do and feel things he'd never felt or did before.
They had matching grins as they got ready for the day together, giggling as they stepped into the elevator and made the ride down to Tony’s office. Happy dropped off their Starbucks breakfast not much later, raising an eyebrow when he found Tony on Steve’s lap.
As soon as the door was closed, Tony shot Steve a grin and dove underneath the desk. Steve immediately got with the program as Tony opened his trousers, and let his hand slide into Tony’s underwear.
‘I could send you a snapchat, what’s your snapchat name?’
They stumbled into the elevator and Tony laughed softly as Steve just stood there, turning his head but not seeing anything.
Steve’s face lit up with a bright smile.
“Close your eyes.”
“Yes, take me like you promised to do.” He breathed.”gonna come soon, Steve.”
“So ready.” Tony reassured him with a bright smile. They went back to the lobby together, where pepper was already directing the movers towards the penthouse and telling them to please be careful around Tony’s very expensive things.
“Well then, boyfriend. Let's shower before breakfast.” Tony said, feeling Steve’s gaze on him as he shashayed towards the bathroom.
“I’m looking forward to that, sweetheart.”
Tony spoke Italian? Now that was something Steve didn’t know he was into. He could feel his cheeks heating up at the delicious accent, though. His hips pistoning into Tony, shoving him upwards and almost against the headboard.
“Oh and make sure the footage of earlier this morning and what we're about to do now are not able to access except by me.”
“I see that hit a nerve, are we willing to work along now, Mr Stark?” the man smiled, tipping Tony’s chin up.
"Already under, aren't you?"
“I’m still leaning towards no.” He gritted through his teeth.
https://twitter.com/eriotafterdark/status/1384890374326521859?s=20
“Your boy will come home, Stevie. They’re going to find him.” Bucky told him.
They were his family.
“Sweetheart, please?”
He didn’t tell Steve how he’d asked Jarvis to request an urgent meeting with a certain Mr. Loki Laufeyson as soon as Steve was asleep.
‘let’s test that when you get here, sugar 😉’ was the answer. Steve smiled, he was feeling giddy and nervous. He looked out of the window and not much later, in his eyes, the heli veered towards a tall building and started to land.
“Go on, try it.”  Tony smiled, and Steve took a piece of the fried squid, closing his eyes as he savoured the taste and let memories wash over him. He made a little appreciative sound and then took a bigger bite, combining it with his mashed potatoes. He might have moaned softly, because damn it was so good, then he heard Tony’s fork clatter. He opened his eyes again, only to see his date staring at him wide eyed.
‘Arrived safely, lunch now, snapchat 2nite?’
Steve was pulled into that universe where you’re half asleep and half awake, you can’t quite open your eyes, but you can hear things and hum occasionally. Sometimes you wake up, and sometimes you don’t
Steve dotted kisses to Tony’s back, and tony hummed in approval. The hands of the blonde left their position to wander for a while as Tony slowed to a delicious grind of his hips.
‘Safe flight, sweetheart.’
“You ready for the show ?” Tony asked, Steve hurried to get out of his pants and underwear.
“Steve? We've got him. We're bringing him home.” Virginia Pott's voice sounded, and Steve’s knees gave out beneath him.
Oh, so Steve had been aroused by one of his models, and the poor guy was obviously embarrassed by it.

"Green." Tony's eyelids were heavy, and Steve smiled, caressing his lovers hair.
‘Yes, fuck yes call me.’
“Well, I’ve got to admit I’m curious now.” He confessed.
Keep an eye out for bonus chapters in the future!
Steve waited for the confirmation from Friday, before allowing Tony to finally touch him. Meanwhile, he reached into the bedside table for the cuffs and the rope.
He was sure he looked dumb, being so in awe of the man beneath him and the man next to him. He just couldn’t help it, and Tony’s fingers pistoning in his ass and brushing his prostate probably didn’t help matters.
“I can hold off kissing you until we get back if you’d prefer…” he started. Tony shut him up by kissing him.
Of course, their picture was on the gossip sites in minutes, front page. Tony sighed when he got a call from pepper.
Tony’s legs spread automatically to make room for Steve between them.
He put his phone down and went to the kitchen to make himself some snack. Soon enough, he heard the tone that told him he'd gotten a message. His eyes went wide when he opened it, a tan wrist disappearing into dress pants, obviously pleasuring himself.
“Are you able to video call?”

Pepper eventually did return. Asking Tony for a file he had ready for her on his desk.
They applauded after every song and only separated for a short bathroom break.
“Now, what did you manage to catch?” Bucky grinned and made a grab for Steve’s phone. Steve dodged the attack but it caused his phone to fall to the ground. Bucky made a dive for it and had already unlocked it before Steve could catch him. He whistled when he saw the pictures of last night.
Steve reached out to swipe away the tears of his lover.
‘look at all that empty place waiting to be filled, sigh...’ read the caption. Steve smiled and send a picture of the bulge in his pants.
“That was so great, thank you for taking me here , Tony. “ Steve said sincerely, pecking Tony on the lips. “best date ever.”
Then came the rapid fire of text messages, an incessant pinging that made Steve bury his hands in his hair.
There was someone waiting for them on the roof of the building , and Steve’s heart started beating faster as the heli touched down and he was allowed to get out. The man hurried towards them.
“Hold out your hands for me, darling.” He breathed against his lover’s lips, Steve did as he was told and Tony slipped the padded cuffs around Steve’s wrists, before giving Steve a gentle push, making him lie down and enabling Tony to attach the bound wrists to his headboard.
“Hmm yes, I’d like to see you in my office. Gives me something to dream about during work.” Tony mused. “let’s do it.”
For now find the art here
“good boy.” Tony whispered in Steve’s ear, the praise made him shudder.” do what he says. I know you can do that for me.”
“So that means that...?” he stammered.
“Who says you were the one going to do the topping?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Very okay.” Tony hurried to assure him. Steve shot him a grin and dove right back in, probing at Tony’s hole with his tongue. After a few minutes, Tony wordlessly handed him the lube. Steve got the hint and lubed his fingers up, before rubbing at the sphincter between those firm ass cheeks.
Comfort and fluff

This question surprised Steve, but he quickly wrapped his arms around Tony.
Thank you.’
Steve flushed and Bucky grinned.
“you’re going to sleep. “ she commanded him.”and Bucky and I will pick you up for dinner and drinks tonight. “
“This is Virginia Potts, Mr. Stark’s secretary. Who are you?”
They kissed longingly and messy , while Steve 's hand expertly found Tony's wrists and tied them up.
Tony had lost track of time, he didn’t know how long they had him here already, because there was no indication of time passing. The lights never went out and there wasn’t a window or clock to be seen  . The gorillas occasionally returned to give him another beating, and always left him bruised and hurting.
“Why?”
“of course, honey.” Steve would do anything to see that smile in person. Even if that meant he’d have to walk to where Tony lived. He’d get there.
‘Yeah, would you be good for me?’ he asked, cheeks burning and arousal simmering higher and higher.
Tony pressed another kiss to those rock cut abs , before wrapping his lips around the head of Steve’s cock.
“Well, they had to find out eventually, let’s see what the damage is.” Tony sighed, threading a hand through his hair and looking up when a sleek, black car stopped in front of the alley.
“Oh baby that’s perfect. Thank you.” Steve was nearly sobbing as Tony started to work him over. Pure pleasure shot upwards from his hips to his spine, adding to the sensations of playing with his nipples, it made his Head spin
Tony nodded, thought about it for a moment. He was torn, because he knew lots of people would probably be in danger if he helped his kidnappers, but ... Steve, Rhodey, Pepper. What if they got hurt, because of him?
‘Great idea! It’s Iam_Iron_man.’
“And here I thought I had a chance, Buck. He’s gorgeous and so sweet. Perfect.”
“At some point, yeah. But mostly about you.”
"Green as can be." Tony sighed, as Steve opened their bedroom door.
TUM TUM TUUUUUUUMMMM
“Just imagine, you have me pushed down on the backseat, music is playing, maybe we’re even driving through the city? You could fuck me while taking in the sights .”
“I’m sorry honey. I need to go into the office.” Tony pecked Steve on the lips.
He took a deep breath as he settled in the Heli, in half an hour he would see Tony. His Tony, for the first time.
“Fuck, Tony!” Steve’s hands flew up to Tony’s hips, guiding him down and helping him back up.
“it is!” he gave in, and then scooped up a blue one. “this is going to be fun, try it. “
Steve played with Tony’s fingers and tapped the palm of Tony’s hand in tune with the music, which made Tony’s heart flutter.
“Oh darling.” Steve moaned, hands flying up to his nipples and twisting the piercings they found there. Tony’s moans got louder as he bounced himself up and down, his eyes closed.
“Steve?”
They walked the short distance to the theatre and tony insisted on paying for the tickets.
“Steve?”
“Hello sweerheart, welcome home.” He jumped over the back of the couch, straight into Steve’s arms. Steve smiled at his lover fondly, before kissing him tenderly.
“My name is Steve Rogers ma'am, Tony and I had a lot of contact the last few days. Any idea where he is?” Steve asked hopefully.
“No, I’m pretty comfortable around you too.”  Steve told him. Tony smiled and pecked Steve’s lips again.
“No need to ask, unless I safeword you’re free to do whatever you want.  My safeword is obadiah.” Tony said. Steve nodded and kissed all the left over bruises from the abduction and then lifted Tony’s legs over his shoulders.
“Okay love. Just...” Tony carefully slid out of him, still erect and about to come.
“even better, I would be joining you.”Tony grinned. Loki raised an eyebrow again.
Steve smiled broadly, remembering the evening before.
Now that seemed to catch Loki’s attention, and his eyes flickered as he leaned in over the table.
“Okay, I’ll come back in a few minutes then.“ she said, already unlocking her buzzing phone and taking a call while walking back out. Steve could hear her heels ticking in the hallway and sagged in the chair, no longer being able to hold in his moan as soon as she was out of hearing range. Tony’s eyes shone with mirth as he came up from under the desk.
“Hey, it’s not fair, but we have each other. I’ve got your back, Tony. I’m here.” Steve caressed Tony’s back and kissed him again, right as a flash went off.

“Coming right up .” the girl smiled, and tony pulled Steve with him.
I've decided to post the bonus chapters in an additional story , but in collection with this one.
“Tony! Sweetheart, are you okay? I was so worried.”
“Well you better move in quickly, then, so I can steal more of them.” He quipped, shashaying towards the elevator. Steve’s laughter accompanying him, and making the morning just a little bit better.
Keep an eye out for bonus chapters in the future!
It was a picture again, this time of a obvious hard on in swimming trunks, an inviting pool and sauna in the background. Steve swallowed.
“green.” Was the immediate answer.
‘Well this is a nice way to wake up, let me repay the favor.’
Steve burst out laughing when he saw Tony’s teasing grin.
“Don’t be silly, I’ll send my Heli to get you.” Tony murmured, before his eyes closed and he started snoring softly. Steve smiled and after looking at Tony for a minute more, he ended the call. He fell asleep with a smile on his face, he was going to see Tony.
“Tell me what you’d do to me.” He commanded Steve, slightly breathless. It made Steve smile.
“Good boy. I’ll bring you to our lab.”
‘Then I will gladly call you so.’ Steve promised, stretching out in the water.
“What was that, sweetheart?”
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
“I think I might have the equipment to fill that. ‘
“Tony, sweetheart?” Steve said hopefully.
“Is this okay?” Tony asked.
“Maybe we could watch a movie?” Steve offered. “Or just walk? I’m pretty sure I’m up for anything as long as it’s with you.”
“you look delicious babydoll. You enjoying that?” Steve asked, all inhibitions forgotten by the sounds the other made. Hand making its way down his pants.
“Hey sweetheart.”Steve reached out to swipe back Tony’s hair, and Tony noticed Steve’s erection still going strong.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah ofcourse, they won’t mind you being there, Mr. Artist.”
He caressed Tony’s hair and Tony closed his eyes automatically.
‘You’re welcome sweetheart.’
“Where am I? Why did you bring me here?” Tony demanded to know. The man put a tray with bread and water in front of Tony.
Tony looked miserable there, and Steve couldn’t have that, so he pulled Tony close and kissed him deeply.
He smiled and texted back.
‘Rogers. Come on ...’’
“Was good.” He murmured. “so damn good.”
“I am, he’s sending a heli, I think? That’s what he said anyway.”Steve blushed, Bucky whistled.
“You like to be told what to do, don’t you?” Tony whispered in Steve’s ear, nibbling the earlobe. Steve nodded instinctively, wondering if his brain could actually shut down, because this sure as hell felt like it.”Well, I think you should show Loki here a good time. Think you’re up for that?”
“first date selfie?” he smiled.
Tony sat up and trailed his hands all over Steve’s arms, Steve flexed intentionally, just to show off for this gorgeous man. Tony bit his lip as his hand trailed further towards Steve’s chest and stomach. He flicked the nipple piercings which made Steve hum appreciatively.
“Even though the sex was more than great.” Steve said with half a smile.  Bucky rubbed calming circles into Steve’s back. “But a relationship? No way.”
“You like that, honey?”  Steve asked, Tony nodded.
“But Tony, think of how horrified your father would be.” One of the eldest board members said, and that made Tony feel cold to his core.
A message had been received. Immediately Clint opened the laptop again and clicked on two or three buttons before a black screen opened again. Slowly, Tony pulled away from the wall he was leaning against and walked to the center of the room to better look at the screen. He felt Steve's arm, which accidentally touched his after he had come closer. Vision stood behind Tony, arms crossed, trying to get a glimpse of the screen all were staring at.
"Oh, yes," Tony replied. "I am sure that Mercedes’ Formula 1 team would have won the last race, but thanks to a mistake in the -"
"We’ve got them!" Clint cheered in the microphone to the others. When the cheers of the others arrived over the communications system, Clint sought a suitable place to land. Fortunately, the plane was built so that it could come down and start almost anywhere without problems. Clint didn’t see what happened, but Natasha suddenly shouted and then put her hand over her mouth. Bucky took a deep breath and suddenly seemed tense. Clint looked over a mirror at the others. "What happened?" He asked curtly.
"Let me help you," Steve said so softly that Tony could barely hear it. The words bounced off a wall of thoughts that the man could not yet arrange. "We’ll go through this together. We are always here for you. I'm here for you."
Steve saw that Wanda kneaded her hands restlessly and heard that Bucky exhaled a bit louder than usual. Both were restless and both had their reasons to feel so.
"And I think Friday has some good ideas, but here she’s turned off."
Clint's eyes slid back over the white sand below. Some sandstone formations were all over the beach and created shadows. Suddenly Natasha stirred.
"Quiet," said Agent Dragenbach softly, turning her head to see Tony. He was still standing next to Burkwill, whose knife was dangerously close to his neck. The mechanic barely suppressed his anger and clenched his - probably blue - hands into fists as the General touched Pepper in various places to check her health. He spoke something in Arabic and Burkwill answered something and made waving gestures. Someone from the retinue came up to the general and put something in his hand. Tony did not know what it was at first, but Lang and Dragenbach could see it.
Maybe Burkwill had looked up to this and even made a show of it, but Tony was sure he could not foresee such a fight. The Brit was still sitting in his tank, defying all attacks, probably even with the most up-to-date technology that Tony himself had developed for his next suit. He knew the man could have used his technology if he was able to get all those information, but the shield still could not last forever. But too long. They had to find the brain and then get Burkwill out of there.
"After I've sent Rogers out of my room, who prefers to play protector in a completely safe area than to take care of an alien army?"
"James Burkwill," Clint said, and Fury tapped some files on the laptop and then showed a picture of the man. It showed him, surrounded by several security men wearing sunglasses and suits in the middle of a shopping mall. The man wore a distinctly expensive suit with one of his arms loosely hanging down. Tony shuddered when he thought it was his work in some way. The man still had dark blond hair and fewer wrinkles in the picture as far as Tony could tell. The beard was smaller than the one he had seen yesterday.
Tony could not help rolling his eyes, secretly knowing it was true. And he wanted everything to be as it used to be, before the deal. Memories of how he was drinking with Steve or watching movies came up in him.
"You can’t do it. What if it makes things worse? We've all been wrong about our last big decision and see what happened!
Fury turned his gaze to Tony, who at first could only look at Barnes. He did not know why, but he nodded. "Ask him what you want. But we need him."
"A fight?"
Tony had gone to the hospital floor, where only a few days ago he was lying in a coma. A strange feeling of tightness came over him and he grabbed his neck. He swallowed as his breathing became harder. He quickly closed his eyes to calm down. In his mind, he immediately thought of his workshop, which he now wanted to go back to. He looked around quickly. A green plant stood right next to the mirrored elevator. The light lit the wide corridor with a nice tone. It came straight from the walls and ceiling, there were no visible lamps. Tony remembered how fascinated Steve and Thor had been when they first saw those lights in the headquarters.
"It's one minute to five, boss,” she replied.
"Ghost what?" Steve asked, and Tony could clearly hear his heart pounding.
, he remembered.
"I let Friday make sure you stay in your room."
"I can supervise him," Vision interjected.
followed him. Tony still felt it’s strength under the armor and he could barely stand upright. He realized that the suit must help him because alone he would not have been able to counteract such forces. Only a few yards in front of the others they stopped. Tony studied the prisoners. It must have been Wilson who had hobbled. He looked up at Tony with a pained face and barely nodded to him. Lang sat next to him, blood all over his face, apparently with a broken nose. Beside him, there was Agent Khatib, whose suit was little more than a few rags barely covering his trembling and wounded body. Agent Dragenbach looked most likely to be ready to fight. Angrily he stared at Burkwill and tried to tell Tony something with his eyes, but his attention was drawn to the person next to Dragenbach. Pepper had her head on her chest. Tony got angry when he saw that they must have completely surprised her. She still wore the clothes she usually wore at meetings. At least they had not gone farther, Tony thought, but then Pepper raised her head. Tony's heart stopped beating for a moment, and he could not stop himself, and tore himself away from the
The sound clearly indicated that the line had been broken off, and Friday had a channel appear on a screen that would broadcast the press conference.
He couldn’t ban the sound of relief from his voice. Tony was glad that his friend was not angry because he had concealed the matter with Barnes.
"I'm sorry," he whispered desperately as he felt how weak his friend was. "I am sorry. I should have been more careful.” He pulled her closer, hoping to give the same warmth Steve had just given to him. His voice trembled and his hand did not rest on her back. He shook his head as if to prevent himself from a panic attack.
Wanda, who was now slightly behind Steve, had given him back cover at the beginning. The last hundred or perhaps one hundred thirty feet of the ship, now lying in his back, were now free of the monsters, and Wanda, whose arms were already trembling with exertion, caused beings on his side to fly into the air and die.
He looked at Tony again and pointed his thumb at his former team-mate. "He was a bit stubborn with his opinion and we had a little misunderstanding. Look to Stark, be so kind, Vision.”
But the soldier gave an apologetic look to Tony at that moment and he knew that he was concerned about him. His heart raced briefly before he could calm down again.
His eyes scanned the room, searching for information he might have forgotten since yesterday. The stranger had shown himself here, but why? From the looks of it, he could be pretty much anywhere and easily kill several agents. If he just wanted Tony, he would have an easier game, he could have simply kidnapped the mechanic.
"Up, Rhodes," he shouted to him. One of Burkwill’s fighters was loading a weapon that was too big for the armor to withstand. The other responded quickly and intuitively. A tree behind him went up in flames after a loud bang.
Young Kima was sitting a little bit lost at the end of the table, furiously pounding it with his pen. Peter Krum, who was sitting next to James, leaned forward to listen to the words of another mediator – a stupid and below average farsighted woman, widowed just two years ago. She complained about something she was not intelligent enough to comprehend. Peter listened, and James was sure the younger man must be bored because of her. He glanced at James quickly and then thumped loudly on the table.
And the flimsy memory of not-a-kiss, and the warmth of Steve’s shoulder pressed against his as they read by the fire – all of it was suddenly stronger than the desire to push back. Because, in a moment of complete honesty with himself, Tony knew that, even if he had something to prove here, it wasn’t going to happen this way.
Steve returns a level look. Then, never changing his expression, he smacks Tony soundly on the ass – so soundly that Tony jumps a little and yelps in protest. He shouldn't be surprised, though – he knew he was going to regret
"It worked, didn't it?" I asked with a smile. "They ended up together."
Tony ran out of the damned coat room, tucking his shirt in, desperately straightening his suit as he walked. Relief was mixing with disappointment that Steve hadn't ran after him. He allowed himself a long litany of
Steve just blinked at her for a moment, almost in incomprehension.
Tony thought his voice faltered there towards the end of the sentence, but honestly, he didn't give two fucks.
Tony: No one calls it hacking any longer. This is not the 80s. And she won't.
The air vibrated with unspoken words. Or maybe it was all in Steve's head.
either," he added with a sharp little laugh that sounded almost painful, "I just..." For a second, Tony Stark looked almost lost for words, which was not what Steve would have expected from him, but then again, he was nothing like Steve had imagined him to be, either way.
Tony: I mean for you, obviously.
Tony: Not the worst.
"Are you all right? Are you okay?" he asks, but Steve answers with a kiss, hot and sloppy. "I wanted that," Tony whispers into Steve's mouth. "I wanted to kiss you. I wanted to touch you. So
“Yeah, Tony,” he said softly. “You are.”
Tony: On my side? Stellar. Why are you sidestepping my questions?
Tony: And I'm thinking you're probably right, you know. I never do it when I talk to Rhodey, you know? Not for decades now. But with Pepper? Oh, man.
"Look at me, you big ass," he said, tugging at my upper arm, so of course I did. I loved how handsy he was – I imagined he was that way with his Steve, because they were closer, they were these good friends (friends who could touch and kiss and have sex, apparently, and that kind of friendship was something I couldn't understand in my heart, but no one asked me to understand).
," Steve almost snapped. "But it was all a setup, apparently."
Tony quirked an eyebrow. "Cocky much?" He'd noticed Steve hadn't answered his first question, though.
"I'm from a parallel timeline," I managed. "Will you sit down, please?" The last time I was this close to him in a similar fashion, afraid he was going to faint on me, was when he got out of that space ship with Nebula. I had no more control over the situation now.
He considered this for a moment. "What do you mean?"
Tony: That's not how it works.
Tony: Okay, that's pretty terrible.
The fact was,

Tony: I get it.
Steve gives him a look that would have been hurt, if not for all the resignation that suffuses it. "Have it your way, Tony. I considered you a friend."

Tony: Steve.
Tony: And I want to, honestly, I do. I want to have all the discussions with you.

Tony: Won't you tell me what's bothering you? What's going on?
from me, Tony?" His voice was still low, even though the door was thick and locked. The timbre seemed to connect directly to Tony's cock just like Steve's gaze seemed to tug directly at Tony's heart. He swallowed thickly. And under Steve's burning eyes, the unlikely puzzle pieces started sliding together, to form a picture. The way Steve stared at him right now, at his lips, the way he wouldn't stop touching Tony; Tony had seen it all before, with other people. It spoke of one thing: desire.

," Steve murmurs at him in that same tone of voice, damn him. Tony wants to melt on the spot. He barely manages a half-sarcastic thought of
The velociraptors were closing in, most of them slow, but the leader much more confident, taking enthusiastic leaps. By his calculations, they had about a minute to get the hell out of Dodge or risk being eaten alive. The thing was, they were surrounded on three sides, and as he backed up, Tony could feel the tide slosh against his ankles, soaking his shoes and socks enough that they squelched wetly with every retreating step.
Mere moments after Tony had started to think that this would all turn out fine, that they’d get back to the resort without incident, completely intact, the velociraptors showed up.
Steve, being the epitome of human perfection, just had to prove the fact every five minutes — and without even knowing that he was doing it, too. It should’ve been annoying, really, but Tony couldn’t help but find it all surprisingly endearing.
,” Scott said, and Tony didn’t even have to hear the rest of the sentence to know that he wasn’t going to like it, “
Tony nodded, considering. He leaned forward slightly to murmur, quiet and impressed, “Seven? Really?”
“Are you sure about this?” Scott asked for the third time in as many minutes, pulling the two vials away from Tony’s reach. He’d only been an ordained minister for about a week now, but he was taking this wedding more seriously than— Well, than anything he did, really.
, ran through Tony’s head—leaving a large gash on the back of his leg. Blood darkened his suit, slowly blossoming, but Steve didn’t stop. It was like he hadn’t even noticed until he’d knocked one of the creatures out, nearly collapsing as he took a step back, but catching himself just in time. He swayed on his feet, squaring up in front of the last velociraptor, like a concussed boxer readying for his last round in the ring, and swung the shield in front of him. The velociraptor easily dodged it, and Steve ducked to avoid the subsequent swipe directed right at his head, losing the shield as he threw his arms out to steady himself.
. His mouth, however, had different ideas, and, like a marionette being controlled by a wicked puppeteer, he was helpless to reply, “I guess so.”
“They’ve got a claw on one of their toes,” Peter answered immediately. Quietly. “Three inches long. They probably use it for stabbing, to defend themselves.”
Tony stood, ignoring the mud that was now staining the left knee of his jeans, and took inventory of what they had — and more, importantly, what they didn’t. With the suit and his phone lying somewhere in the T-Rex enclosure, and all the power systems in the park shut down, they were basically clean out of tech, save for the arc reactor. But Tony wasn’t about to take that apart and use it for scraps anytime soon. They had no food, no clean water, nothing except for the clothes on their back, which, with the rain still damp on their skin and the temperature dropping to a steady cool, wasn’t quite enough. And, to top it all off, they had no weapons to defend themselves — and Tony didn’t think punching out dinosaurs with his bare fists was really the best idea.
That startled a laugh out of Tony. “I don’t know, kid, that’s pretty pricey.”
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s crying until he lets out a wet, choked-up little laugh, his heart swelling with affection. And maybe this isn’t quite the proposal he’d been imagining for himself the past couple days, but it’s perfect nonetheless, and he cups Tony’s face between his hands and pulls him in for a kiss.
Osborn looked nearly pained as he grit out, “Yes.”
They just needed to get back to the main building—or any building—dry off, warm up, and grab a bite to eat in the mess hall. Easy.
He swallowed, the sound seeming to echo through the cave.
“Ow!”
. And if there was any doubt in his mind as to what exactly that meant, the logo also included a helpful little outline of the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Third, and most importantly, Tony didn’t
“Harry, Peter, please tell me you know how to swim.”
, but it was definitely… peaceful.
“Um. Here?” Harry answered.
He really should’ve expected that he’d be this charmed by Steve, by his honesty, his modesty, his knack for storytelling, but it still managed to catch him off guard, just a little. They talked about SHIELD like it was the weather, about Fury’s work-in-progress team like fantasy football. They talked about Bruce, the kids, Osborn, and for a while there, Tony felt almost normal. Normal for him, at least.
“Yes,” Steve said again, his lips curled around a grin. “I’d love to.”
“Don’t even start. You’re lucky I wore anything at all,” Clint retorted, and started chugging coffee straight from the pot as he went to sit down at the kitchen table.
Tony blinks, his hand pausing on Steve’s back. “Oh,” he says after a moment, his expression going slack, eyes wide and mouth agape. He swallows, licks his lips. “And you’re upset because you didn’t want me to, or because you did?”
All he got in response was a confused, tired, “Huh?” But it sounded human, so Tony took what he could get.
and— And I don’t want you to have to take care of me, Tony. You’re already so busy doing so many amazing, wonderful, impossible things, and I’d just keep you from all that. I’d be a burden, don’t say I wouldn’t. And you just, you deserve so much better than that.”
“I— What?” Tony only just managed to get out, still a bit dazed by the turn this conversation had taken. “What are you—?”
Tony knew this was his last chance to take back his tech, so without thinking, he reached out and snatched the gauntlet from the velociraptor’s grip, stood up, and motioned for them all to make a quick getaway.
Like,
, without much of a problem.
Bruce sidled up to Tony, elbowing him lightly to drag his attention away from Steve. It was no easy feat, and between the soft little smiles he kept throwing Tony’s way and the effortlessness with which he dealt with the kids, it took a good thirty seconds before Tony finally turned to Bruce.
Around them, the sounds of the jungle’s steady breathing were strangely calming: the low, howling calls in the distance, the rustle of leaves below, the wind whispering through the trees. Like a lullaby, almost. His eyes slipped shut, though he kept listening for danger, and had almost drifted off by the time Harry murmured, “That’s another two dollars.”
, who should probably not be here, and should definitely not be running through what amounted to a museum at breakneck speeds, all but tripping over themselves as they skidded to a halt exactly a foot in front of Osborn.
“It worked like a charm back in the day,” Steve defended. “And this is my first mission with SHIELD. They only found me a couple months ago. Haven’t been doing much since then. Catching up on reading, mostly.”
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea, Mr. Stark,” Peter said, desperately and urgently tugging on the hem of Tony’s button-up, as if wanting to drag him away. “Please stop that, please, please, please—”
"Captain Marvel? Carol? Would you sign my clipboard?"
And right now, the hum was different; wrong. Tony stopped. Listened for a moment longer. Then he picked up speed  and hurried towards the elevator at the other end of the pilots' deck. It would be a bad idea to start spreading panic now; people milling about would surely block the corridors. Also, perhaps he was wrong. He would try and check first.
It was so frank and earnest that Tony had to stop for a moment. To swallow. To recalibrate. He stood there blinking for a second. "Yeah, all right," he blurted. "Doable."

Steve seemed to be reading his thoughts. As he wiped his skis, very conscientiously, and checked them for dings, he said: "Is this where you are going to be hosting your corporate retreat?" He didn't look at Tony as he said it, and for some reason that was infuriating.
Tony being Tony, he jumped to the next topic without much preamble. "Know that tiny donut shop on the corner of STREET and STREET? Does it exist in your time, too?"
Tony: All good.
"Nah," Peter was saying in reply. "I like it how many people there are, actually. Diff countries, all that. Besides, I did get to see Sam and Kamala, so that's a bonus." Peter had shared a hospital room with both of them at different points of the war. "And then there's my Monarch of the Balcony" – Peter leaned into him a bit, nudging him with his shoulder, and his tone was playful and wry. It was straddling the line between the flirty and not, which seemed to happen quite a lot with him. "And that's a heavy weight argument right there, buddy. As for the music – you know what, I've heard worse. Speed it up a little, throw in the beat, it'd be perfectly fine. Although," he continued, "I do like my lyrics, if you know what I mean. But what's bothering me right now is,
But, since that wasn't going to happen, they could still have this one last night together, if Steve figured out what he wanted.
Okay, not nothing, it was sweet and it was kind; and Tony had no idea whatsoever what to make of it or where to file it.
Tony: Shoo? Really, Steve?
Speaking of Rhodey, he seemed mightily nervous tonight, for whatever reason. He had decided to wear his civvies, and, unlike Tony, he was very conservative in his choice of suit.
Steve rubbed his forehead for a second, as if looking for lost words. The gesture was so spontaneous and somehow endearing that Tony softened immediately. He couldn't quite look away. His throat was tight and his mind was a little foggy; he felt frozen in place. Every step they took lasted years. Steve was too close for comfort.
Gathering his thoughts, Tony looked at Rhodey. His friend still seemed tense – but not tense with frustration; it almost seemed like anticipation.
Tony: No, scratch that. Pls forget I asked.
called for questions. Not food, not air; answers were what he needed. Answers and plans. He realized he was back to fully alert, and on the verge of starting to fidget.
"I stuck 100 bucks on your statue. With a piece of gum."
Tony: Steve, tell me something.
seem to be some kind of favorite Sokovian pastime.
On second thought, probably everything Tony did that first day was a bad idea. Likely, if he hadn't waved at the techs working the night shift and blown kisses in their direction, the prank war wouldn't have started at all. Well. He was, as ever, absolutely unable to ignore Hammer's comments, while outwardly pretending as if he blithely didn't pay any attention to them. Still, he should have stopped at that. He
He closed his eyes, just for a second. Took a breath.
Tony: Rogers, you sent this to me by mistake, didn't you?
"Nat. Wait."
He thought he detected a jerk of irritation in Steve. Tony wasn't doing it on purpose, not exactly – whatever he was doing. It was just that his mind was racing million miles a second in every tangential direction imaginable, and he could feel his feet vibrate with the urge to do something, anything.
"Tony! Decided to honor us with your presence, have you now? How's life in the upper crust? Do tell, do tell." Hammer really couldn't let it go, but Tony decided not to play.
"Perhaps I'm here because I decided to go sit in my own room for a while," he replies, feigning indignation. "I still have my room here, right?"
Or... did they purposefully try to weaken Steve, not for that reason but because they... wanted to sic the two of them on each other or something? Make them fight? Their estrangement was common knowledge now. Was that why they put them in adjoined cells, divided only by a door and a lame excuse for a brick wall? Making them turn on each other
Not that he should be dishing out advice, but... "I pretty much just blurted it out. It blurted itself out. I don't know."
He scoffed.
She didn't sound reproachful, so I don't know why I had the urge to be defensive. I hadn't stolen him away from her.
"I gotta see if Darryl's okay." Thor sounded breathless. Steve nodded. Tony fought off a stab of untimely jealousy, because his own reasons for wanting to go down were so much better and so much less purely personal than Thor's.
Unconsciously – Tony thought – Steve rubbed his neck on the right side.
"Slower," Tony tells him, and he doesn't even mean it as an order, exactly, but Steve's eyes snap to his own, his breath hitches, and Tony can see him get hard under his tight uniform.
The bed was old, and he had a slight crick in his neck, but he was warm and snug, all wrapped up in blankets. The wintry freshness on his face, as a contrast, let him know the fire had died down during the night (crap, he’d forgotten to bank it), and now he’d have to get up and light it again. In a minute. He delayed opening his eyes. Savored the fact he could postpone the beginning of this day for a bit longer. If he didn’t open his eyes, there was a 50% chance he wouldn’t have to deal with anything.
The sudden nakedness didn't seem to perturb Steve in the least. He made half a step to the left, guiding a very willing Tony to lean back against the bricks next to the fireplace. "What I want is to get you to bed and keep you
. Just at the beginning of his hole, stretching the rim stingingly, deliciously. He heard Steve suck in air, then he relaxed the digits a little. Now they were side by side, inside Tony’s hole; Steve waited for him to adjust, but too soon, too vigorously, he pushed in; Tony welcomed it. He welcomed the ache and the stretching and the sharp burning. He could feel his cock jump, jerk, once, twice under Steve’s hand. And the clump in his throat was too dry for words, and he could feel the flood within him start, rise, but he pushed it down, down; not
"You should probably go to sleep," he said frostily when he was done. "Maybe you can sleep it off."
Tony: about the mythopoetical whole
Tony: I'm sorry they were in the Raft. I'm sorry I parted with Natasha on such terms. I never wanted any of this either, Steve.
Forgetting himself for a moment, he tried to jump to his feet; gave up. "You know what, I don't see why you're even asking. You evidently have all the answers already, so why don't you tell me?" He was speaking coldly, looking to wound "What is it I'm going to do with it? Subdue you? Take you in? No, guard your back, Rogers,
"Well, that explains it then," Steve smiled. "I'll be there around 5?"
Nebula hints – in her own weird way, that is more like a hit on the head than a hint, really – that the pair to go to Vormir should have some kind of emotional attachment to each other. An emotional connection. She glances at Natasha and Clint as she says this, then away. She seems unsure about something. But Steve and Tony exchange a look. They don't even need to discuss this.
Tony: Sry, I'm just really, really tired and I'm fed up with everything. The last straw and all that.
Tony nodded, eyes hardening in determination. "Let's go."
"Please." He realizes it's his own whisper. He's rocking back.
The disappointment in the pit of Steve's stomach was acute; not because he needed a confirmation of Tony's identity, but because he'd been hoping to see his face as he drank. Just a glimpse, after months of separation. He imagined he could see a glint of brown eyes through the visor slits, but it was just that – imagination.
It... made perfect sense, actually, and now Tony felt like a total piece of crap for making fun of him, but that was the effect Steve had on him. Whatever Tony did, he ended up feeling like the bad guy. He didn't know how to talk to Steve any more; had he ever known?
He felt stirring against him, and then a gentle hand touched him on the elbow and patted him awkwardly a few times. It was like an anchor, a line pulling him slowly back out of the waves of hysteria. He could feel his stomach calm down bit by bit, and it was like something had finally stopped tickling the insides of his brain – all of this gently guided by the rhythmic patting of that warm hand on his elbow. "Aw, god," Tony said finally, when he thought he might sound like himself again. "That was embarrassing. I think I haven't laughed since..." He stopped.
talking about friendship," he points out firmly.
"I second that," Clint piped in as he jumped lightly into the saddle. Now all they had to do was fight their way back through the enemy lines and rejoin their small army. "You would not believe the amount of moping we all had to deal wi-hey!"
Tony: That's not how it works.
He was silent for a longest minute. "I didn't think you meant it," he said then.
Tony: queen to d2
"Hey, it's only fair", Tony blurted, trying to make light. He shrugged. "After my towel fiasco, I mean," he added by way of explanation. He managed not to say
Another stinger like that, and Steve almost comes on the spot. "Harder," he whispers, "
"Would," she said. "Could. Might," She touched the amulet around her neck which now held the time stone again. "Yes. I see it all."
It's Clint and Rhodey (who never really hit it off as friends in any significant way) that end up going to Vormir, and, after very careful planning and new input from Nebula, who reluctantly discloses more info, they pop into existence there, create a momentary diversion, snatch the soul stone from Thanos in the moment he gets it, after killing his daughter, and disappear seconds after they appeared there. It's a most elegant piece of action, according to the two of them.
"So you decided to move the car out of the way?" Tony said dryly, because everything was weird, and this was his way of dealing with weird. A thank you might have been nicer, he knew. "You're a, what, a park ranger or something? Striding around the woodlands at night, protecting hobbits, freezing to death?"
Tony: But I'm scared for you.
that. He stared at Steve, waiting for a reaction, for – well, not denial, not that, but at least some kind of calling down; no, scratch that, a
His eyes went wide. I don't think that was the reaction he was expecting.
Soon enough, the shivering subsided a bit, so Tony left Steve to try and tuck the dog into blankets while he brought it some hot soup from the kitchen. Later on they would have to try and feed it something at least semi-solid, but for now warm liquids were the thing.
Tony: sometimes I really hate you.
When Tony died, I'd stopped smiling, but yesterday and today I realized the necessary muscles were still in a working order.
“ah, but my dear papa isn’t here anymore, now is he?” Tony said, voice sharp and agitated. “It’s Mrs Potts who runs the company now, and let’s all just be glad she cares more about me than Howard did.”
‘Kay. Gnight.’
“Sweetheart?” tiny kisses on his cheek. Tony shuddered, feeling sensitive all over, but that could be because Steve was playing with his nipples too.
‘You ready? I’m excited.’
“all right, we’re going to take the elevator, you ready?” he asked.
For now find the art here
“Excellent choice.” He grabbed the dildo and the lube and settled on the bed. Hand already lubing up the big thing.
Tony moaned at the praise and bobbed his head even more eagerly, eliciting the first moan of his captain.
Tony pressed some money in the stunned drivers hand, before pulling Steve with him towards the elevator.
“She would have loved you, especially because you make her son happy.” He pressed a sweet kiss to Tony’s cheek.
“Steve!” he smiled brightly, jumping into his boyfriend’s arms as soon as he had dismounted the bike.
“So, that’s a yes?” Tony asked hopefully. Steve chuckled and kissed Tony.
“It’s okay if you did, just tell me.” Tony put a hand on Steve’s leg.
They decided to grab lunch later and went their separate ways to shower after the run.
'Please pick up the phone let’s talk about this.’
“That’s you, right?”
“I’ve always wanted to share a rainbow cup with someone.” He beamed, and Steve couldn’t help but think how cute Tony was right now.
Tony didn’t give up the next day either. Steve’s phone started ringing while he was doing the finishing touches on the Thor piece.
“doesnt matter. Are you okay?” Steve asked, looking Tony over for injuries or the likes. “I followed you because I didn’t want you to go through this alone. I don’t care if they know about us, Tony. I know you want to protect me, but I just want you to be all right.”
‘I want to see you do it.’
Tony smiled:”yeah, you like the limo? Maybe we should christen it.”
“uhu, three fingers. Feels good.”
“Hi Sam! How was your holiday.”
“Jeffrey? Who’s Jeffrey?”
‘Oh lunch! And yes yes yes see you tomorrow, hug you tomorrow!’ was Tony’s enthousiast answer.
“I did. “ Steve confessed, feeling the panic rise again. What if Tony didn’t want anything to do with love? What if this was more of a friends with benefits situation?
Now, Steve started really pumping his hips, hearing Tony gag just a little bit. The two pinches to his thigh (their non verbal sign to stop) didn't come, and Tony looked like he was happy having Steve's cock stuffed down his throat.
Tony turned around and kissed his boyfriend good morning properly, making the blond chuckle.
Steve knew it was useless to argue with her, so he nodded.
‘Go to sleep, then. I’ll be there in the morning.’

“dont want to moveee.” Tony whined.
“okay. I’ll do it.”
He found his completion not much later, Loki’s lips wrapped snugly around his cock, Steve watching them both in awe. Tony’s last thought before everything went white was how cute Steve was when he got something but didn’t quite seem to believe he was allowed to have it.
Steve groaned, so that's how Tony wanted to play? Well, game on.
“I'm going to towel off and hit the sauna. I like your voice though, we should do this again.”
“Thanks Happy, that will be all for today. Enjoy an evening off. I sure know I will.”
Tony looked around the room at his business partners.
Steve wrapped a hand around the length of the other man and in a few strokes brought him to completion as well. Tony sagged against him, basking in the glory of the orgasm. A small smile tugged on his lips.
“I... I love that idea, Tony. I really do, and I love you so much. Let’s see if we can plan this properly, okay?” Steve smiled.
"You're very welcome, Tony." A gentle kiss, a hug, until Tony started squirming again.
Tony licked the underside of his shaft and Steve jolted like there was electricity running through his body. Then Tony found that sensitive spot close to his balls and started placing with his sac, and Steve didn’t even have the time to warn Tony to pull off.
Steve smiled and sat up again to pull off his shirt, then he relaxed back against the cushions, fingers playing the metal rods through his nipples.
