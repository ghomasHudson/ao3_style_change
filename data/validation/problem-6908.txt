“The sentiment is mutual, Steve,” Tony replies just as quietly. Then he smiles a little and says, “I would always save your life, too. Always.”
Steve brings his right arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him closer. He’s leaning on the open doorway, the night wind soothing their tuxedoed bodies with fresh air. Tony feels warm and happy right there at Steve’s side, as though his life couldn’t get better than this.
Steve smiles. “I could see that. It was painful to watch,” he says, smirking. Tony makes a mock-offended face, and Steve laughs. “In the best way,” he adds. “When I said the total blackness made you stand out, I meant it.”
Tony isn’t ready to talk about last night – at all, but he can’t have Steve feeling guilty for something that existed only in his mind.
Jan told him that the only reason people would look twice at his mask was going to be because of its beauty, and not because it is worn by a man.
Steve looks absolutely delighted. “Long before last night,” he supplies. Tony nods, before realizing Steve is talking about himself. “Me too.”
It’s no different now, after the kisses, after the caresses, after the sighs and the closeness of their bodies. It’s only been one hour, maybe even less, since they first kissed and things spiraled down in a vortex of heat and passion, but Tony is just as breathless as he was when he first brought Steve in his room.
At that, Steve lowers his hands. His cheeks are not entirely back to normal, but he seems less embarrassed, at least. “I used to think that your cartoonists slacked. Not that it was my place to tell,” Steve hastens to add. His cheeks color a little more. “But the way they drew you… It wasn’t close to the real you, the one in the photographs. Every time I had a copy of Marvels in my hand after seeing you on that newspaper, I felt annoyed, like it was somehow a personal insult that they never got you right. They
– why would Steve do that? But it’s not like he never brought Tony some food down in his lab – in fact, it was quite common he did that, especially if Tony was going through one of his inventing spirals and lost every cognition of time. Besides, it’s rude to ask the reason behind someone doing something nice for you, Tony’s fairly sure. Ninety-percent sure.
“He says hi, by the way,” Steve continues. “My Tony. He told me to say hi to our ‘awesome counterparts’ and that you would be interested in my GPS-watch,” he finishes, looking at Tony.
Right now, he bobs his head up and down, aiming to drive Steve insane through his dick. His hand massages what he doesn’t manage to cover with his mouth – it’s been quite some time from the last time he’s done this, and Steve is not exactly small, so he doesn’t even try to take everything in his mouth. Plenty of time to practice that, in the future. At least, Tony hopes.
That’s how, not long after, Steve tries to push Tony off his cock as he manages to say, “Tony, ahh, I’m going to—”
After the movie, they go to the main tree in order to open their presents at midnight, as per tradition. Someone suggested doing a Secret Santa on the first year, but after a smart comment made by Tony, they decided everyone would get presents for everyone, and that rule hasn’t changed.
to let down your guard?” he asks, appalled. “You know, that’s the perfect moment when a supervillain would strike – when you lower your shield and decide to trust him. That’s pure tactical mind, and here I thought you were the tactical one—”
Steve grips his shoulders in a strong vice and moves Tony’s entire body in front of the punching bag. His Cosmo splashes all over his hand. Tony can’t find it in himself to care.
grow up with the intrinsic need to have a sugar daddy. Ever since childhood, they get told that, if they’re good enough, they’ll get to sit on a bearded, old guy’s lap, and he will buy them all sorts of things. All they need to do is convince him they were good boys or girls. It’s the very principle of the sugar daddy, okay, it just
But right now, nobody is joining them on the dance floor for a Foxtrot. Tony can hardly blame them – it’s not a very common dance.
Tony stares at him, an involuntary smile spreading across his face. “You’d better be serious, mister,” he says.
He should have known better. Steve knows him better than most people – heck, he’s probably the person who knows him better than everyone else.
He has a perfectly trimmed goatee, brown Bambi eyes just as deep as his Tony’s, deeper bags under his eyes and a light frown, which makes the whole appearance just a tad cuter.
Steve is looking down at him with a heated gaze, and Tony has his tongue on Steve’s dick when he comes.
Muffled piano notes mark the beginning of the new song, and Tony recognizes it after a couple of seconds. He smiles, heart warming up, and he’s filled with the sudden impulse to go along with the feeling and not squash it down, just this once.
A pang of longing rushes through his body, leaving him breathless. His chest aches. He needs to hold Steve again. He needs to be able to kiss him whenever he feels like. It’s like his body became addicted to Steve’s proximity in the span of one night, and is now demanding its fix. The thought that he isn’t allowed to do all that makes him feel dull inside.
Tony holds his breath as the Waltz slows down to its ending notes, and they come down to their last steps.
On other nights, though… Tony lets himself hope. “This doesn’t have to be the last time we do this,” he says, quieter than before. He hopes Steve realizes the seriousness of his tone.
“Okay, I’ve got it. We’ll need just a couple of modifications to the original plan, nothing major.”  Tony’s heartbeat accelerates in his chest, knowing what is going to happen. “First, you’re not allowed to talk to Immortus again,” he says lightly. “You can still schmooze, but try to avoid him.”
Besides, Steve knows the override codes to get in as he pleases. They were supposed to be for emergencies only, at first, but with time they have sort of evolved into Steve’s free let in whenever Tony forgets to eat and has locked himself in, in order not to be disturbed.
“Nobody has ever done justice to this body,” Steve whispers quietly without looking up, silencing every one of Tony’s wandering thoughts.
Unfortunately, blessings on that evening could be counted on the fingers of one hand. They made little to no progress with their plan yet, first because they haven’t been able to spot Immortus so far, and second because Tony is unsure when their act should begin, to be credible when they do meet the guy.
He can feel the others’ curiosity, but he knows they won’t ask – so he decides to sort of answer the unasked question anyway. “So if you have any questions about this, I’ll try to answer them myself. For the specific ones,” he looks at Tony again, “I’ll gladly take them to my Tony, and we can try to come back here together – so you can geek out all you want,” he finishes, smiling.
That’s why he participated at the ball, Tony figures: every member of his magazine receives an invitation.
He’d never bet on Steve being a better schmoozer than him, and yet here he is, staring dumbly at Steve’s perfection and almost slacking at his own duties as schmoozer and host.
he never does. It’s like being an adolescent all over again. “I remember. It was the very first thing you told me,” Tony says.
He sits on his bed for a couple of minutes to try and regain his cool, but he soon finds that the more he lingers, the more his mind plays tricks on him.
If that is all he’s ever gonna get from Steve, he’s glad he can at least imprint the sight of it into his memory. Another thing that will forever be burned into his brain.
Steve watches Tony’s horrified expression, and takes in the scene in front of him. The top of Tony’s head barely reaches Steve’s eyes. He’s leaner than his Tony, less muscular, and his legs look so
“Who are you calling Mister,” Tony said with a laugh snuggling into Steve. He was prepared to argue more but the lack of sleep caught up to him and it was only a matter of minutes before he was asleep in Steve’s arms.
Tony was a couple hours into designing new arrows for Clint when he heard someone enter the workshop.
As soon as the programme ended Tony rushed to his bedroom. He slammed the door shut behind him letting the tears fall. He sat down on the bed, trying to calm his breathing.
Steve looked shocked, he stepped forward making Tony step back. "Sweet heart, Tony what are you trying to say."
They kept up the banter while Steve cooked, Tony loved mornings like these. Where it was calm, no missions, no emergencies and no fury-
Tony sighed. He finished eating, clearing the plates away and saving Steve’s waffles for when he got back. He decided to get some work done if he wasn't getting time with Steve.
Tony knew what that meant. Steve was going to get up and get changed, cover up those God-like abs (Tony knew he was thirsty but could you blame him!) and make him leave the bed.
But Steve wasn’t here now and Tony was forgetting to eat despite Jarvis’s constant nagging. He would work himself to the bone because without Steve he found it difficult to sleep. Nightmares would haunt him, keeping him from rest.
Steve none the wiser smiled "Thank you Tony for being so understanding," he said, walking over and kissing the top of Tony's head before leaving again.
It was later that night when they were all sitting on the couches watching Instinct, a crime show they all like when Steve and Bucky walked in. Bucky walked slightly behind Steve, as if he was trying to hide behind Steve.
As much as Tony would later deny it he would do anything for Steve's waffles. The pair got changed and headed down to the shared kitchen. Tony sat at the island and watched Steve make his waffles.
It was only a couple days later when Steve had been called away on a classified mission somewhere in Europe. Of course, Tony wasn’t allowed to know anything. This was due to the small teeny tiny incident that occurred when Tony travelled to Portugal to make sure Steve was okay after he was injured on a mission. After that a new rule was put in place to stop any further interference from Tony.
This was the fourth night in a row he had spent working on fixing and improving the suit. He was currently trying to reinforce the chest plate after it was torn off him like it was fucking papier mâché during the fight. “Idiots always ruining my design.” Tony muttered shifting about some prototypes on the screen.
"Heard what? That the one person that could come between me and Steve just so happens to be the one fucking person that is barrelling back into our lives?!"
Tony sighed; he knew she was right. He was just being paranoid. Steve would come back, kiss him and hold him. He would tell him he loved Tony and everything would be okay.
But the emotional side, the side that was currently winning, had other ideas. Tony was facing his work, but his mind was somewhere else. Black and white images of Steve suffering in a cold, cramped apartment followed by Steve coughing up blood and clutching his heart in the medical wing followed by terrible thing after terrible thing flooded his imagination.
Steve glanced at the picture. His puzzled expression relaxed in recognition. He grabbed the picture and showed it to Bucky and Tony. “Remember those camera men, Buck?”
Seeing the face, something snapped in place. This was pre-serum Steve. Tony has seen one picture of his lover before he became Captain America and this is exactly what he looked like.
“I guess I’ll dive right in. He thinks you don’t like him.” Bucky glared at Tony. “Things don’t always work out and that’s fine - I’m not going to threaten to kill you or anything if your relationship falls apart. I AM going to hurt you if you keep dragging it out and unnecessarily hurting him.”
“-Nope! I’m going!” Tony cut off Steve and sprinted to the mirror, he wanted to rip off the bandage.
“I love you Bucky. That isn’t changing. I don’t care that you’ve changed. I’ve changed too. Can I touch you?”
“This is definitely going to happen. Who should represent the Avengers?” Pepper leaned over Peter’s shoulder, reading the article he’d pulled up on the trend. “Probably Captain America or Iron Man. It’d make sense for one of the most public figures to go.” She focused her attention on Tony, “You are the one providing the money and the one most directly connected to Stark Industries.”
“Okay.” Tony went upstairs and showered off all the grease. He sat down on the bed for a quick nap before bed. Several hours later, he woke up to a dip in the bed and a warm body laying against him.
“I’ve seen how you eat with that spidey metabolism - I think this is the perfect amount.” Tony didn’t mention the fact that Peter had eaten way less than normal during lunch earlier.
After coming home from a particularly boring meeting, Tony was touched that Steve had thought to leave him a voicemail. Tony hated traveling to the satellite branch of Stark Industries in LA without his loving boyfriend, but the daily calls made it bearable. He plopped down on the bed and requested that JARVIS start the playback.
As Bucky walked to his room, he was approached by Natasha. “I have a spray that would keep it from smudging for longer, do you want some?”
If it went well, he might surprise some others with a bucket of cold water. They would make a compilation. Hopefully, Bruce wouldn’t Hulk out. Actually, that might be cool. Hopefully he does Hulk out.
After the ceremony, he came home, changed, and showered. Downstairs, Tony and Natasha were playing chess while Clint made dinner. Peter was working on a science project with Bruce’s help.
“I’m on edge all the time in my suit. Now that I’ve been fighting in televised battles, I feel so much pressure to ensure that none of my actions could allude to who I am. I’d also be nice to be accepted as an official part of the team. I could actually attend post-battle meals in public with you guys or strip my mask off to breath easier after a fight. It’s not like I don’t get enough press coverage from being Tony Stark’s and Captain America’s son so I think the benefits outweigh the cons.”
“You spent like an hour sketching this guy and you can’t even remember what he looked like? He’s probably rolling in his grave.” Bucky laughed.
The Pledge of Allegiance is a short expression that every American child memorizes and recites daily at school. It is also used in almost any event where an American flag is brought out. I know it’s been confusing to exchange students that have been around so hopefully that’s a bit helpful!
“They’re just too loud I guess. With the whole senses dialed up to eleven thing, the noise makes my ears ring and my head pound. The bright lights and cheering doesn’t help much either. It’s stupid, I know.” Peter sheepishly explained.
“How’re you feeling?” Tony looked up at him as he entered the room.  “Better” He slunk down in the seat next to his boyfriend and cuddled up to his side. “It doesn’t seem so fresh anymore.” That was true. With Tony, Steve had finally begun to accept the future and all of its quirks. He got over the people in his past live, comforted by the fact that many of them lived long, happy lives. Tony nodded and lovingly rubbed his arm.
Just below and over his elbow was a peacock with a butterfly and a firefly on either side. The peacock had red and gold ocelli adorning its wings. The butterfly had red wings with black and blue lines criss-crossing out from the body. The firefly had just done a loop which left a trail of golden light resembling a portal. There was a snake wrapped around his upper forearm which was wearing Loki’s helmet. An emperor penguin was sliding on its belly beneath them. It had tiny cat ears and a silver spiked necklace around its lower neck. There was a cheetah with silver spots licking its paws next to the penguin.
Steve glanced thoughtfully at his pencil. “I guess they never came up since I never had them around him.”
“Hey, Steve, I wanted to talk to you about-“ Tony had come into Steve’s room, without knocking as usual, to ask him if he was really enjoying his time here. Steve seemed hesitant about skiing already and he wasn’t exactly as enthusiastic as everyone else. He was also going to apologize about the teasing because he may have had a slight crush on his childhood hero and couldn’t bear the thought of Steve being mad at him.
“I know I’m not always great at communication, but I’ll try to share as much as I can with you - not the stuff that you could just find online, but the real me. Sweetheart, I want you to be able to tell me if anything is ever bothering you.”
In two days, everyone had packed their warmest clothing and prepared to hit the slopes. They clambered into a private jet and anxiously awaited their trip.
“Yeah we’ve been dating for the better part of a century. Are you going to join or keep satisfying yourself over there in the corner?” Bucky’s question pulled him from his trance and he realized that once again, he was masturbating.
Steve smiled and went over to Peter’s room to grab the heater and all the blankets. “Might as well have twice as many.” He explained.
“Wait, I wasn’t trying to shame you or whatever. I just meant that you seem to have a preference for a more physical relationship.”
Steve blushed. Clint made gagged noises and sprinted out of the kitchen. How the hell were they still like this after two years of dating?
“Frail? Stevie? He lived for nearly two decades like this. He survived poverty, rationing, a war, and a million bar fights like this. You kissing him isn’t going to do shit. Jeez, both of you are idiots sometimes. Go make up with him.”
“Yes, sir” Tony teased. Steve could practically see him saluting with a smirk on his face. He smiled and shook his head, still amazed at how close all of them had gotten. They were practically a family at this point.
Tony’s head throbbed at Steve’s blatant concern. His face scrunched up. Here come the waterworks. He somehow managed to shake his head as he choked back a sob.
“So there is another party, some press thing again, and Pepper says I have to go,” Tony spoke nonchalantly as him and Peter curled on the couch, “It’s next Friday. I got a nice suit for you to wear.” Peter swallowed and tilted his face, “Sorry, but I’m actually busy that night.” Tony raised his eyebrows: Peter typically wasn’t busy Friday nights because it was when they went on dates. When he looked at Peter’s serious face and realized that his boyfriend wasn’t about to crack a joke about being lonely, he couldn’t bring himself to ask what else was on that night. Peter jolted up, “I ugh, I actually forgot that I need to be home tonight. I promised Aunt May.” “Bye Tony,” he waved as he pulled on the spider suit and swung out the window.
“Really soon. It’s getting hard to breath and my tongue feels to big and my throat is...” Steve sounded weird. His cheeks looked puffed up.
Tony looked Peter over to make sure he hadn’t woken up when he noticed a dark spot on his lover’s neck.
Why were they sleeping in the same room? In the same bed? Tony was so deep in thought that he almost didn’t notice Peter shifting on the bed.
“Good Morning!” Tony was upset at being interrupted from his daydreaming, but that was quickly replaced with overwhelming happiness when he saw that his daydreams had manifested into the real thing. It was even better than the daydream because real Steve handed him a cup of coffee as he cuddled up next to him. He smelled fresh and showered. Tony adored it.
“Steve. It’s your turn now!” Peter abruptly stood up and grabbed Steve to give him the same treatment. In a matter of minutes, Steve was also adorning the blue mask.
Tony cautiously sat down on the couch. He left a good six inches of space in between himself and Steve. Steve scooted closer. Tony scooted away. Steve sighed and pressed play on the remote.
Steve’s shoulder sagged in relief and he beamed at Tony. “Maybe someday I’ll build up the nerve to do something in public, but for now, can we continue where we left off?”
Sam, who heard the chaos, sprinted to Steve’s side. He repeated a mantra reassuring Steve that he was safe and able to breathe. Eventually, Steve calmed down. He choked up bile in the sink and let Sam lead him to his bedroom.
“I’m so sorry Pete. You were right. I was just being a helicopter parent because I get so worried about you all the time. It isn’t an excuse, but I hope you’ll forgive me? I’d be more than happy to help you plan your reveal.”
“-It’s okay. I’m actually pretty tired. Skiing really takes it out of you. I’m going to go to sleep. Goodnight.”
Tony drummed his fingers on the table. His mind was far away from the red head seriously reviewing a stack of papers in front of her and Pepper’s detailed explanations. His thoughts were in Fiji, planning a trip for him and Peter after this deal was struck. He saw a smile lighting up Peter’s face when he told him. He saw Peter excitedly dashing across a pristine beach into gentle waves. He saw Peter falling asleep with his head on his chest in a large sunbathing recliner.
“Well, I thought you might deserve a bit more rest if you were up late last night watching T.V. or whatever it was that caused you to fall asleep on the couch.”
Memorial Day is a holiday honoring soliders who lost their lives fighting for our country. It’s somewhat of a large thing, but unless you are in or know someone in the military, most people don’t really do anything about it.
“You’re breaking up with me?” Steve’s tone was flat. He was in too much shock to even process the situation.
“Don’t even try to make excuses Rodgers. I guess even America’s golden boy has his problems. Just be grateful I’m giving you a week to move out.”
“How’s everyone?” Steve panted as started walking toward a clearing in the debris. They’d just finished defeating a villain who was trying to plant mind control bombs all over New York City. “Weird alien shit.” Steve mumbled beneath his breath. Why couldn’t they just have normal human adversaries anymore?
“I need you to promise that if I ever did cheat, you’ll leave me, but other than that, you don’t need to promise me a thing. You don’t need to change. I love you just as you are.”
How can someone be so stupid? Tony thought crankily from his seat at the table. Him and Pepper, along with a few board members or advisors or something, were sitting across from a screen showing several other people in business attire. Pepper, as per usual, was doing most of the work. Their agreement was that he would do most of the behind the scenes engineering projects and act as a figurehead for interviews and such. Pepper handled the more business-related aspects of running the company. Case and point, her leading the conversations and negotiations at this incredibly boring meeting.
Peter felt a hand rest on his leg. He tilted his head in confusion, “Mr. Robert?” The man gave a smirk, “Want to have some fun?” Peter quickly realized what the man wanted and shook him off, “No. I’m with-“ “Stark” Robert cut in, “That doesn’t mean you can’t try other options. I’m sure I’d also be able to afford you baby.” “No” Peter stated more firmly. “What a loyal sugar baby,” Robert cooed, sending a shiver down Peter’s spine, and tried once again to touch him. When Peter swatted his hand away again, Robert grumbled and backed off, “Stupid slut.”
Peter's enhanced senses can't handle the loud noises during the fourth of July celebration. Tony comforts him.
His head whipped around as his enhanced hearing picked up the sound of clicking by the door. He stood up in an offensive stance and walked around a corner that would allow him to see the door, but where the attacker couldn’t see him. Once he recognized the blonde hair of his boyfriend, his tension melted away and he ran up to give him a hug. “You weren’t supposed to be back for three days.” Bucky gave him a once over to check for injury. Steve was remarkably unharmed and he let out a sigh of relief before pulling Stve back into his tight embrace.
“Captain America has one night stands?” Clint finally shook off the initial surprise and joined the conversation.
“Besides that last one, do you need anything for those? Should I keep a physician here?” Tony was relieved that the last item was only a joke, but the all the other ones were worrying. “How’d you survive all these things during the Depression?”
“Hey, Steve. Did you get hurt?” Tony whispered, because for as worried as he was, he couldn’t think of any battle incidents that would’ve caused serious injury, and he knew Steve secretly hated medical.
“But then you wouldn’t be able to hear as well. I want my teammates to have the best.” Tony stuck his bottom lip out and pinched Bucky’s butt as he reached over him toward the coffee pot. Bucky grinned.
After that fiasco, everyone decided to retreat to their own rooms and sleep off the tiredness they all felt.
“I was just...” Tony decided that he had already made a fool of himself today and been inconsiderate of one of his best friends so he might as well continue to bare his soul, “...a little bit jealous. I like you Steve.”
“Probably,” Steve admitted, “It’s in my room if you want to test it.” He was always prepared for an attack.
Steve’s heart melted. He didn’t even notice his phone turning on in the back of his jeans as he crouched down to help the little guy.
Tony’s breaths sped up and shallowed as he thought about all the mistakes he’d made with Peter. How he didn’t deserve him. How he was corrupting such an innocent child.
Natasha nodded thoughtfully. She remembered when he came home, distraught over his search for the right church. She, albeit not a religious person, pointed out that personal worship was a thing that he should look into. He found that he much preferred a personal connection with God rather than being weirdly stared at throughout mass.
“He’d probably pretend to dislike them at first, but eventually fall in love. You could definitely convince him: he’s so smitten he’d do anything you asked.”
“No time like the present.” Clint moves to take Thor’s spot. His fingers were nervously tapping against his thigh, but otherwise he had a battle stance on. The mirror flashed and a man staggered out. He clearly acted drunk. “DON’T HIDE FROM ME CLINT” the man screamed. He had a dark smirk on his face. “Barney can only cover for you for so long. In the real world you’re going to have to stop being such a pussy and man up.” Clint’s eyes went wide as he surveyed the scene. He gulped and dodged his father’s punch, but much slower than his usual reflexes would allow. When the man realized his punch hadn’t landed, he became angrier. He turned to the side and swung at apparently nothing, but just before the punch peaked, a woman appeared and she was hit square in the face. She tried to smile but her face was twitching. “Don’t worry about me Clint.” Clint closed his hands into fists, he wasn’t a child anymore. He wouldn’t let his father do this. Deftly, he pulled out an arrow and shot his father. He joined Thor on the other side.
“Charlie. You know? The dog he picked out from the shelter the day before you got back. He seemed really excited to show you, but I guess he never worked up the nerve.”
Feel free to request stuff as well! I do not do incest, pedophilia, graphic r*pe, or glorified self-harm. I also don't write about the actors. I love Marvel and all their casting choices, but I find it rude to make stuff up about a real person's life.
Peter had been awestruck when he met Captain America .The idol worship became respect and admiration when he experienced the Captain’s leadership prowess and fighting skills on the battlefield. Then, Peter met Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers drew cartoons of the Avengers and left them on sticky notes around the house. He made hot chocolate if he noticed someone was having a difficult time sleeping. He listened attentively to Peter’s problems in school and offered solid advice. He took care of everyone. That’s when Peter knew he platonically loved the man. And if he helped Natasha in setting Steve and Tony up, well no one had to know.
“You don’t need to thank me for that stuff. For one, I’m a selfish man. I like seeing you happy so I’m really just indulging myself.” Peter rolled his eyes but let Tony continue. His tone became more serious. “I also want you to know that you can share anything with me. I know you’ve been through some shit. You’ve seen things that no one your age should ever have to see. Being an Avenger only adds to that. I’m so grateful that you trusted me enough to show me a vulnerable piece of yourself.”
“You’re the cutest boy I’ve ever seen. Isn’t that right Charlie? You’re going to be a good boy for me, right?” Steve’s gentle voice played over the speakers in Tony’s room. “That’s it. You’ve got it!”
“I’m not mad at you.” Steve gave Tony a reassuring peck on the lips. “I’m mad at those damn reporters. Can I get an interview to clear all this up? Natasha helped me figure out what happened.”
Tony sighed dramatically as they rounded the corner. “We have toothbrushes. You know that right? And they’re much better than these.” Tony picked up the plastic packaging like it was garbage. “Ours are electric and everything. They even have special modifications that I added so they’re molded specifically to our mouths.”
It was so natural. Both men were so nonchalant about it. Steve even grinned at Tony before turning his attention back to the page.
“If I may, your words ‘just be grateful I’m giving you a week to move out’ during your most recent argument may have prompted him to leave.”
Tony nodded vigorously and gave a relieved smile. Steve leaned in to kiss him. When they pulled back for air, he said “I guess I’ll have to forgive you then.”
“I’m not going to eat any of it. I just want to collect some for testing. C’mon, it’ll be fine. Don’t worry so much.” The natural scientist in Tony wouldn’t allow him to just leave behind all these carefully catalogued jars. So what if he couldn’t read the script? One of these probably cured cancer or something. Yeah, he definitely needed to check all of them.
“Eggs?” Steve tilted the skillet toward Natasha, who nodded over her cup of tea. He scooped a sizable amount onto her plate before dumping the rest onto his plate. They ate in comfortable silence, both catching up on the news as usual.
“Go back to sleep Tony.” Steve kissed his forehead. “JARVIS told me you finished your project. Good job. Now you should get some rest.” Steve whispered in his ear and Tony contentedly drifted back to sleep.
“We didn’t have to double up Mr. Stark. It just happened. I can leave if you need to talk in private.”
The super soliders continued to speak over each other with a good natured tone. Bucky had an eyebrow raised and Steve was trying to look stoic. Both of their lips were twitching upwards as they surpassed giggles.
“It’s alright baby. You just need to let me know if you’re feeling insecure, okay? I want to be able to help you through these things. Can you promise me that you’ll communicate this stuff?”
A couple of hours later Bucky and Peter came in to see Clint, Tony, Bruce, and Steve sitting on the living room floor in a pile of stuff. Tony had decided to get all the other boxes driven over from storage. Most of it was propaganda stuff, Steve didn’t own much, but occasionally they would find something meaningful and Steve would tell a story or stare of into space with a slight smile.
“I’m sure Natasha would be able to set you up if you’re looking to get some action man.” Clint offered.
The restaurant wasn’t somewhere anyone in the world would expect Tony Stark to visit on his vacation. The outside was rundown and the inside was understaffed. It was located in the middle of nowhere, New Hampshire.
Steve just glanced at Natasha and casually said, “Nat and I have a lot of long missions together. Good stress relief. I really need to go though.” He started stepping toward the doorway.
“This is my stop. My boyfriend’s a real grump about medical.” Bucky wagged his fingers teasingly and turned to climb the stairs to medical.
Now that he was all fixed up, he joined the rest of the team. Natasha had a ice pack against her lower rib cage. Bruce was helping Tony put antibiotics on his wounds. Steve and Bucky were just trying to get any dirt out before their cuts closed over, they were immune to infections and scars anyway. Fortunately, it was an easy mission so the whole team wasn’t assembled. No one was hurt badly.
With one swift movement Tony was under Steve, big hands roaming his body and down, lower, lower until his mini skirt was raised up: “God…are you even real?”. Tony’s only respons was a loud moan as he arched his back onto the mattress as Steve played with the plug in-betweeen his fingers. He could have felt Steve’s eyes fixed on his body, thick an needy and it felt so good. Having his own supersoldier, his lover, his husband and saviour there driving him to cloud nine.
In this position the vampire grabbed the headboard behind her after lining his cock to her entrance. Painfully slowly he pushed inside her hot, velvety entrance. Her wetness making it easy to fully enter her.
Steve shook his head: "Nah, just finished a beer, I don't wanna overdo it", he smiled to the other looking into his eyes. Steve was starting to have some small wrinkles around his eyes, Tony noted, they were cute, made him more human...less impossible to reach.
Steven smiled and held his hand out: "I'm Steven Rogers". That was unexpected. Tony blinked twice and shook the hand: "I'm Anthony Stark…". The blond smiled and nodded towards the kitchen: "Beer?"
The next morning Tony woke up with a slight headache, not too bad after a long night. He felt his head rise and fall in a wave-like rhythm, his cheek pressed on top of a soft bare chest.
Toni stared into her eyes for long until Steven stepped behind her, gently taking her coat off: "my mother, Sarah Rogers, head of the family before me"
He sighed looking up at the dark sky above them, light pollution was a disgrace: "Well yes, I'm an old fashioned man"
“He said he has to work on some project...pretty sure he's working on another better coffee machine”
At the blond's silence Tony just huffed and looked around the dorm room: it seemed nice, clean and nicely furnished, the guy had a simple taste but he could change that. Tony's eyes landed on the desk, there was a trophy on top of it next to some chemistry books: "Uuuuuh football player?", The brunet grinned madly like he had found the holy grail.
He crawled back up to her to leave wet kisses on her chest, around her nipples. His tongue circled on the nipple and his lips closed around it, sucking heavily until he released with a loud pop.
In the meantime Steven marched upstairs with his hands holding her up against himself, squeezing her thighs dragging his digits into her soft, warm skin. Her toned legs perfectly shaved, she was attentive to her looks.
"Chick at hour three, hasn't moved her eyes from you since you started standing here like an idiot", Bucky's voice in his ear made him cringe, they could have talked at a normal distance like normal people.
He clenched his coat tightly around his slim figure not to give away any hint of the surprise when Steve himself called him: “Upstairs!”, yes. It was show time.
The blond, pale male let his fangs show through his smile and waved elegantly, scoffing at his friend's comment
"too bad! Rhodes's dorm room is right next door!", Steve tossed the cardboard aside next to his desk and stared at tony
That was how they worked: the second they were talking, the rest of the room was background noise. It was Tony and Steve, Steve and Tony; no one was going to change that.
Toni arched her hips up to let Steve slip her dress higher, right below her chest. His tongue was ravishly licking up her inner thigh to her belly button, his hands unable to stop caressing the taut muscles of her abdomen.
When Steve entered the hall of their penthouse he was greeted by the slow rising of the lights and Friday’s voice: “Good evening Captain, I’m afraid Mr.Stark-Rogers hasn’t come home yet”. The soldier just nodded in acknwoledgment when an idea struck his mind making him grin wide as he started to undress quickly heading for the shower.
Was Steve blushing? Oh God no, this was wrong, they shouldn't have talked tonight. He wasn't ready to forget or even say no to Steve
The woman leaned in on the table, her chest provokingly uncovered by the cleavage of her dress: "what if /I/ misbehave?"
Steven smiled softly and patted his own friend's back while addressing the counterpart: "I hope Bucky is not boring you out with his family's stories and what not"
Her voice was higher now and it hit Steve’s ears almost offending him. He growled and raised up on his knees grabbing her throat with one hand: “You’re such a whore aren’t ya…”
The vampire helped her take off her coat, hanging it near the entrance and did the same with his own coat. He then moved to slide her chair back for her, smiling softly as he sat back down on the other side of the tiny table.
A loud gasp and a giggle escaped from her lips when the tall man lifted her up into his arms, kissing her deeply, pushing his tongue inside her mouth.
Rhodey nodded and immediately reached for the handle only to be surprised by a massive chest in front of his face "Uhu…."
With this new information he stared pounding inside her again and again, moaning and grunting her name out loud
The party had to go on and God was it difficult. Every time the genius turned to talk to someone he spotted the light blue of that ridiculous shirt. At some point he was sure he could have smelt Steve's presence nearby. Yet, they were far from meeting, from talking or touching. Nothing was wrong between them, let's be clear, they just couldn't talk yet or else they would have forgotten about the party at all.
Like a good host, that Stark wasn't, he showed them both inside offering champagne and some appetizers, which of course were declined.
Blue. Blue and blue again. Literal pools were staring in Stark's direction and all he could do was swallow down the honey-coloured drink he had in his hand.
Toni moaned when Steve bit down with sharp teeth and all tongue in the middle of her breasts, making her back arch above the mattress: "Tell me about it~".
Pepper was stunning that night, a backless dress showed her beautiful form to the people around her, she was a good PR after all. Anthony was still talking with the investors of the new protection project when once again the genius lift his look up: he was looking at him. Steve was chatting with Bruce and Natasha, but he was looking at Tony.
The taller boy smiled warmly and turned his head lightly: "Imma...Imma give ya a blanket". And he stood leaving Tony there quietly curling up on himself as he felt colder by the alcohol in his body having its effects. Steve returned and placed a soft fuzzy blanket on top of Tony and nuzzled his shoulder with a soft smirk. The brunet giggled lightly as he tangled calloused fingers through dark blond hair: "Steve…"
This wasn't the moment to remember, but as soon as their eyes met Tony couldn't stop his mind from racing backwards to that evening...it was a normal evening like the others, a movie playing in the background and the others watching it in the living room...
"Hey yourself", Stark turned on his stool holding his glass up, pouting at the sight of Steve's empty hands, "No drinking tonight?".
He leaned in close, brushing his nose against her jaw and up to her ear lobe: "you won't look for one after I've started"
Steven pulled out almost completely until only the pulsing tip was inside and then slammed back in starting a brutal pace.
"I apologise for my rudeness, I must say I was intrigued by the way you carved the shape of your eyes in my skull", Rogers gently held up his hand, taking the one offered by her and brushing his cold lips against warm skin.
"I've had worse nights, I hope you don't mind going out of this place. The party is gonna be way longer than I can bear"
Once again, with sharp fangs he dug them into the flesh of her thigh, sucking strongly filling his stomach with the warm liquid.
With a gentle tug on her arm he led the way to a smoky dim lighted pub. It was mostly empty, a few tables occupied by two or three people chatting quietly.
“C-close-ah-YESTHERETHERETHEYESSTEVE!”, Tony moaned out loud, bending in half backwards basically (Gosh he was so flexible) as he thrust up, overwhelmed by the sensation as he came heavily onto himself, skirt and corset stained white. Tony kept moaning and whining while his husband kept thrusting inside his oversensitive body until: “F-fuck Tony- Ba-baby boy mhf! Tony-”, Steve slammed twice again coming inside Tony with a loud growl of his name. His length twitching inside Tony’s walls, stretching him slightly more and filling him up, making the brunet cry out his name once again.
The blond smiled, straightening his back up, and licked his lips: "a lovely name. I'm Steven Rogers, head of the Rogers family".
"Neither, since I've been attending these parties for my whole life and my father won't stop talking about you and your family all the time"
"I deliver myself, they open, I jump out in a skimpy outfit, they all laugh and maybe I even get someone's number!"
The vampire laid her down on the dark sheets, the red of her dress popping out amongst that darkness.
"I'm o-okay Steve-", the genius patted that strong muscular chest lightly and swallowed down some more of the water, "I'm fine". When Stark looked up he knew he was in danger. Steve's eyes were on him once again with that soft blue hue that made him weak at the knees.
The vampire only grinned, leaning in himself, their noses inches apart: "I would make you obey". The tone in his voice lowered, his voice vibrating against her. She shifted on her seat, never leaving his eyes and she leaned back tossing her long, dark curls behind her
Steve needed someone who loved him head to toes. Who cherished him in a way that Tony wasn't capable of.
Steve fiddled with his sleeves waiting for Tonny to walk in the bedroom, he checked himself in the mirror, combing his hair back just one time.
The other nodded deeply and turned immediately to a dirty blond guy (Steve recognised Clint, a player on his football team)next to the stereo, gesturing at him to turn the volume down.
Only, this time no one interrupted them, not even when Tony grabbed Steve's arm dragging him upstairs.
Toni turned to see Steve hanging her coat. She uncharacteristically felt out of place: she was used to being the centre of attention, this wasn't her first time going to a man's home without knowing him well.
Not that he didn't enjoy it. But it was not what he wished for his current bed companion. Steve didn't deserve this...the fast screwing and the "you know who I am" note in the morning.
Steve was going to interrupt the other's monologue but decided to fully answer after him: "I'm- no! I don't suck at chemistry it's just really hard-"
Toni moaned loudly again, her throat pushing against the vampire’s cold palm and fingers making him squeeze in answer.
“Where is Tony?”, Pepper, the third friend of their small group, asked to the host with a small frown scanning the room
Steven raised back up holding her waist tight as he let her taste her own blood on his mouth. The woman’s arms were pulling at his back desperately, leaving scratches with her nails.
The majority of the guests had already left, which let Tony have some space as he sat on a stool at the corner bar. He signaled the bartender to pour him another whiskey; he held his chin up with his palm while his other hand played with the small umbrellas that were meant for drinks.
Tony immediately caught up with the steam of the fight and stood hastily to face the blond guy: "It was a prank! Fun people make pranks! And I was supposed to be at Rhodey's dorm!"
Yes, they were married and yes they lived together; but also they were two superheroes in one of the most dangerous countries in the world apparently. To the point of ridiculous. It had been a week and a half since the last time he got to see Tony alone in a room, all the days after it had been either Steve or Tony going to bed too late or getting up way too early.
He was wearing that damned blue shirt, of course he was. Didn't he have another shirt? That one was for parties and only that one? He needed to get some help for his wardrobe, maybe even Tony could have helped him. Stark took the sight in: Steve Rogers was a masterpiece. He had those strong arms, his back perfectly curved and his hands so big. He matched the same canons of a greek statue but had the soul of a norse god. Maybe he could have asked Thor if they were partially related, wouldn't have been surprising.
Steven stared dark eyed as his husband pushed him down onto the bed making him fall on the mattress which wiggled lightly under their weight. The soldier let his hands travel up Tony’s toned thighs, tensing muscles under feather-light touch. Anthony, on his side, stroked his palms hungrily over the soldier’s suit, his mouth biting and tasting on the other’s neck and jaw, making sure he was going to taste Steve for days after that.
"The very owner of this house, you would have known already if you didn't waste your introduction on yourself and instead asked for my name", the woman smirked in victory. She clearly knew the power she had on men and vampires, apparently.
Rogers chuckled lightly and followed the other with his eyes: "You're leaving?", And he immediately bit his tongue. What the hell Steven. You don't even know the guy and now you ask him to stay for whatever reason. The question resulted in Tony turning slowly with a magnetic grin: "If you insist...I can stay, quarterback".
The Vampire gave her three harsh slams, their skin slapping loudly and with the last one he released a loud animal growl.
The flashes and the sound of shutters made Steve squirm in his too tight tux, one of his hands rising to shield his eyes from the sudden lights.
The lights in the big ballroom glimmered as Tony scanned it with his eyes, almost making it difficult for the man to make out the figures dancing around him. It was chillier than usual that evening, thankful for the warmth filling him from the whiskey he was drinking, Tony Stark spotted a well known figure among the others.
"Steven G. Rogers!", Howard Stark cheered at the sight of his favourite (and most menacing) non-human. Weirdly enough, the word vampire always scared the others.
"If you'll excuse me, Steven, this game of stares can continue later. How about you meet me outside in an hour?"
He looked at Steve with warm eyes and scoffed with a grin: “I created a kink monster, I swear. Should’ve stopped when I had the chance”. The other shrugged while slipping the covers on top of themselves: “ya married me tho”. ”Hell yeah I did”, and with that Tony wrapped himself around Steven’s body kissing his chest, already drifting off to sleep.
He leaned up, kissing Steve's lips softly. The smell of beer collided with the sweet scent of Steve's cologne, making Tony wrink his nose as he stayed still waiting for Steve to return the kiss. Waiting that didn't last long since Steven was now wrapping his arms around his waist, kissing him even deeper, just like last time.
"Stop thinking please", a hoarse voice spoke above his head. The sleepy blond creaked his eyes open and sighed, "I can hear your mind racing...just stop". He huffed a chuckle as his hand stroked through Tony's curls, eyes closing again.
Tony was all in in everything he did. That was why he couldn't let himself love like this...not with Steve risking his life every day, or even worse HIM risking to leave Steve alone. God only knew how loyal Steve was when he was committed to something, or someone. Anthony wasn't going to leave him mourn him forever and never moving on.
The blond got up to open the door, in front of him there was a big Christmas box, just a few inches shorter than him, said box didn't have any names on or signs, just some stamps and a ribbon. He looked around in the big hall of the building: no one was in sight. Maybe it was some kind of equipment Sam, his flatmate, bought online for his classes; considering this, Steve decided to push the huge box inside.
He was always throwing parties, singing out loud in public, creating machines and planning pranks. The latter was his favourite activity.
They screwed one night but Tony was already losing his mind over the blond soldier. This was not okay. Just not- Tony.
The other followed curiously until he saw Steve actually pulling out two beers from the fridge: "waitwaitwaitwait. Are you not going to fuck me over the counter now?"
It felt like a shock down her chest to her toes: a wave of pleasure shook her body making her wet the bed and Steve’s length up her entrance. She stayed upright for several seconds until she felt it, the thing that made her definitely drunk.
The brunet blinked twice and grinned: "knew you couldn't resist...even if it's 'not for you' ". At the recall of Steve's own words he scoffed and stuck his tongue out, climbing up on the couch to rest between Tony's body and the back of the couch: "fuck you"
It was not that heavy, still it was a nice challenge for him to bring the gift inside his dorm, he left it by the door not wanting to break something in it. After that he noticed the time: "ugh fuck", he grumbled and decided to just get ready for sleep.
If anyone would have asked someone about Tony Stark on campus they would have said anything but that he was a boring guy.
Steve stared at the other guy with a quizzing face: was he even serious? That didn't sound like a plan on first instance and...who would have laughed at that?
Toni Stark grinned, gripping Steve's forearm tight with her red nails contrasting against the darkness of his own coat: "So it's that what you want to do? Court me?"
“Hello Captain”, Tony’s voice was honey poured on his ears as he heard the brunet step inside the bedroom and closing the door behind himself. He turned around and the air he had in his lungs got caught up and ecploded at the sight. Red heels were slipped on top of white stay-ups that  lead Steve’s eyes up to a white and red skirt, way shorter than the ones his “chorus girls” used to wear. A light blue corset hugged a lean chest and those perfect hips of  Tony’s, a white star in the middle of his chest. To top the outfit: red lipstick and a tiny hat.
Her body felt like she was running miles and her energy had to pump towards her goal of pleasure. Her mind was fogged with only images of Steve’s body on her, her sense of touch heightened making her feel Steve’s tongue lapping at the holes in her thigh.
It wasn't uncommon for their species to attend such mundane events, they needed to show how good of beings they were.
"I am the one giving orders here", he mumbled as he leaned down to kiss down her neck, tasting her sweat on his tongue keeping back from eating her raw and alive, at least not yet.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck shyly and let out a small puff of air: "Hey James...I'm sorry can you...maybe turn down the music? I'm studying next door and it's finals week and I-"
Anthony's laughter faded slowly into a soft giggle as he lied back on the armrest of the couch yawning softly and kicking his feet against Steve's thigh: "Gimme space yo-you beefcake!" He hiccuped and laughed once more at Steve's pout. The blond sniggered and gasped even louder than his laugh: "your feet are freezing!", He gently scooped said feet and placed them on his lap to cradle and massage them lightly. Anthony just giggled more and sat up shaking his head: "NONONONO dooontt~", he hugged Steve's neck sniggering tiredly and drunkenly closing his eyes.
"I mean, everyone seemed happy and I got to talk about my projects and even had a few drinks so", he shrugged and chugged down the water, coughing up when it went down the wrong pipe.
His attention moved to her other breast, flicking the hard teat with his tongue and drooling all over it again.
The other was mesemerized, call him a sappy artist but Steve really was asking that question. How can someone be so beautiful, charming and good in every way; and most of all how could that same perfect person decide to spend his whole lifetime with him? ”Stop staring my love, I’m going to faint over here”, Steve was brought back to reality by Tony’s breathy words and got back to his ministrations. His tongue was wet against the goosebumps it left up Tony’s inner thigh as it trailed up to the main object of his attention. He closed his lips around Tony’s member, suckling ever so slightly, teasing him and bobbing his head down as slow as possible, trying to make the other conscious of every inch of his own skin. Steve’s own situation desperate in his pants.
Her curls bounced against her damp forehead when she shyly nodded, her lips opening once again to take Steve’s thumb inside her mouth.
Gently, oh so gently, the soldier brushed his thumb against the corner of Tony's mouth, drying some droplets. The shorter man clenched his jaw looking up, swallowing drily this time. His hands moved automatically up Steve's forearms, tugging slightly as Steve was going to pull away.
“How long?”, asked Steve with a feral growl”How long what?”, Tony, the teaser, knew exactly what Steve implied”How long”, Captain America held back a moan, “how long have you been wearing this?”, and there he proved his point by poking at the very bright, captain america themed, butt plug that was stretching Tony’s sweet spot. ”All day long my Captain…kept thinking about you all day…”, the answer satisfied him enough that the supersoldier got to work like a man on a mission.
“None of that, you need sleep,” Despite his firm tone Steve couldn’t help the blush forming on his face.
Tony dropped his head to the desk "Bucky needs him, Bucky needs him. Bucky comes first." He muttered getting back to his work slightly angrier.
"You're just being paranoid. Steve loves you; he chooses you. He will always choose you," he mumbled, the tears made speaking harder.
The tower felt empty, sure he had his friends, Peter was coming around more to talk to him and Pepper tried to make sure he was eating at least one meal a day but it wasn’t the same. He missed Steve’s smile, his open arms, his laugh, his voice. “Get a grip Stark,” he said aloud, god when did he become so needy.
They stood hugging for what felt like hours but was only minutes. They walked out of the toom together joining the group with smiles. They sat down on the couch, Steve with an arm wrapped around Tony and Bucky sitting next to Steve on the other side.
Tony thought about the day with a smile. He was so caught up in his own head he didn't even realise that Bucky had walked up to him.
Sleep wasn't easy that night but eventually morning came. Tony forgot about last night, he smiled and rolled over. Reaching out for Steve but his smile quickly disappeared when all he felt was the cold bed. He sat up and looked around. Stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, his frown deepened when he saw Steve and Bucky cooking pancakes together.
They were called out when some chemist believed he had found a cure for his cancer. Let’s just say the results weren’t pretty and it ended in a steroid fuelled maniac with super strength running around New York. He had already attacked and seriously injured a group of 25 tourists and killed 2 others. Tony and Steve were the first ones to initiate contact, Steve tried to talk sense and well….
"Oh, come on Tony," Bruce and Natasha followed Tony over to the couch. "You know they aren't like that. Bucky is his best friend, but you're the love of his life!"
However, like always the universe just had to have its little laugh because just as Steve served up the waffles, he got a phone call. He smiled apologetically at Tony, walking away to talk.
Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his face as he looked at the plans for what felt like the hundredth time.
“Not a call, not a text message, not even a fucking letter. Stupid Fury, stupid mission, stupid, handsome, amazing Steve” Tony muttered to himself. Dammit no focus on work, not on Steve, work work, work. Tony forced himself to look back at the schematics on the screen but it was no use all he could focus on was the ache in his chest. He stood up and walked around the workshop, yawning. It was another night he was spending without sleep. He could hear Steve’s voice in his head, the disapproving frown that he would do anything to make disappear. It was unfair because It wasn’t even his fault technically. It was all Steve’s fault really.
Tony huffed and started to eat "So much for peace and quiet..." his mood only got worse when he saw Steve walk back in with his jacket.
Steve took a deep shaky breath, tears falling "Tony what n-no please no. I ca-can't no. You can't g-go. I need you Tony, sweetheart pleas-please."
“Nothing sweetheart come on now, time for bed,” Steve said gently picking Tony with little effort. Tony in return gave a squeak fo surprise.
Steve sighed in reply walking into the bedroom they shared. He placed Tony on the bed carefully then walked over to the dresser grabbing a long shirt and clean boxers for him and Tony. He passed the clothes to Tony before changing himself.
Steve was a constant, he would bring Tony food when he was on a working binge, gently remind Tony when it was time to come to bed and force Tony away when he wouldn’t leave. Steve always seem to know when Tony needed a break, when he needed to be held even if Tony didn’t realise it himself.
Steve gave a hum to that and Tony sighed. "Fine make me get up and leave the comfort of our bed," he knew he was being dramatic but he was comfy.
“No go away less, much less, how about never actually. Yeah, just stay here with me. All the time, think about how much time we could have, we could get through your lists” Steve listened to Tony’s rambling with a smile.
Tony gasped out loud: “pleasepleasepleasepleaseSteve!”, he clenched a fist in Steve’s hair as he was desperate to get fucked and fucked good. Tony had always been so loud in bed and his husbans loved it. Steve brought his head back up, holding his tongue out against Tony’s tip, teasing it some more before leaving it and nuzzle the shaft down, towards the perineum. The genius was a panting mess, way too sensitive already because of the plug and Steve’s actions, he willingly lift his legs up onto the other’s shoulders, moaning when that damned perfect tongue teased against the plug and circled around it. “Come on Steve…come on come on”, he begged with soft whines and rolling his hips to get any kind of friction anywhere on his body. Captain America licked around, kneeling up in an odd position with his head down and ass up undoing his belt with frantic hands, he lapped at Tony’s hidden spot grunting and moaning lowly, moas muffled by being under Tony’s legs. Releasing a contented sigh as soon as he was able to pull his length out he knelt up, pushing his lover’s legs down, bending him in half and swifting closer, shaft in one hand pumping it red and hot: “slick it up baby boy…c’mon show papa how you like it”.
Toni fell limp against the mattress with a ragged breath, her chest again falling up and down under Steve’s eyes.
His teeth grazed on the round muscle still hidden under the dress, before she could move again he bit down, digging his fangs into her flesh, sucking. He felt the thrill of warm blood dripping down his throat, which made him even harder than he already was.
Steven was immediatly patting his back and helping catch his breath again: "Ya need to be watched 24/7 uhu". He chuckled taking the bottle and placing it down to help Tony undo his tie that also got wet from Tony's sputtering and coughing.
The way her hands moved while she spoke, her lips curling around the rim of the glass. Steve was becoming hungry and the warmth of the pub didn't help at all.
"Ah! AH STEVE FUCK~", the woman squeezed her own breasts when she felt him tongue-fucking her. He was so damn good at it. The contrast of her heat and his cold tongue made her shiver all over. Her legs kicked around and against his big strong back "m-more Steve, I want to feed you-"
She seemed even younger while asleep, like if her worries all slipped away with her own blood sucked by her current bed companion.
The night went on slowly, everyone still talking about business and boring diplomacy discussions about God knows what projects in some God-forsaken countries.
The glass clattered against the wooden table when Toni put it down after drowning her third Old fashioned.
Steven stared at him for a moment before handing him the beer with a stern look: "Not for me. If it is for you then alright...you can go".
A quick nudge to his elbow shook Steve awake from his train of thoughts involving being bored, hungry and absolutely thirsty.
It felt like ages since the last time they got to put hands on each other and Steve was so touch starved he wasn’t sure he could hold in tears the moment he had the possibility to touch his husband.
You could have cut through the silence that was stretching between them. None of them daring to start a new conversation after Steve's cryptic comment.
The brunet planted his cheek better against Steve's pectoral, listening to his heart beat as he looked at the sun coming up. What was he going to do...
Tony moaned more and nodded frantically, leaving Steve’s lips to mumble helplessly: “readyreadyreadyplease”. And so Steve obliged: with one hand he held his own base pushing inside, carefully slow not to hurt the other who was already begging to go faster. Captain America moaned out as he rolled his hips inside, snapping in sharply to bury himself inside completely. Iron man gasped out loud: “YES!”; he gripped the front of his husband’s uniform to haul himself up, biting at Steve’s jugular and ripping some buttons open. wanting to feel Steve’s strong chest under his hands.
The blond tried to stutter something out but his mouth was suddenly dry and all the blood he had left in his brain travelled South, the fact that Tony was staring at his old fashioned army uniform like that didn’t help neither. ”I see we had the same idea…great minds think alike uhu”, the genius was so close, his husky yet soft voice so hot against his cheek. Tony’s hands stroked up his torso to his tie, tugging at it to pull him closer: “Let me show you how much I appreciate what you do for this country”.
James, by his side, while fixing his own dress just shrugged: "I think they can't remember, they're humans". The last bit wasn't said without a pinch of contempt.
Through the paper thin wall Steve could hear the music blasting inside the dorm flat-like room nextr to his, it must have been a kind of Christmas party, it didn't really help the growing headache he felt because of finals. He should have known people were going to be wild before vacation days, nonetheless he couldn't have gotten ahead with homework before that evening: he had a part time job at the library that occupied the majority of his time alongside his lessons.
Peter was a bit terrified. “We hurt him.” He mumbled over and over again. Tony was also in shock. Why hadn’t he even considered that Steve wouldn’t like a challenge that involved ice? The guilt gnawed at his heart and he felt like crying. He felt as terrible as when he realized how much harm his weaponry had caused.
“Mmm” Bucky leaned over and kissed Steve. The adrenaline coursing through his veins made Steve almost frantic. He squeezed Bucky’s ass and deepened the kiss. Bucky pulled back with a small moan.
“No matter, I’ll buy you one. Let’s go.” Tony hopped out of the car and handed the keys to the valet. The bellhop handed him a heated blanket, as requested, and went to remove the luggage from the trunk. Tony opened Peter’s door and wrapped the heated blanket around his shoulders before they walked into the lobby together. Tony spoke to the receptionist and asked for a swimsuit in Peter’s size, which a staff member immediately set off to get. He then led Peter through the lavish halls and up the elevator of the luxury hotel and into a room marked ‘Spa’.
“He smiled and reassured me that it was totally alright. In fact, he was gay himself. He started talking about how he had been trying to ‘turn me gay for him’ but now he didn’t have to put in so much effort. Suddenly, he was kissing me. I tried to pull back because I wasn’t into him like that but he only pushed against me and made it stronger. I kept trying to lightly push against him to get him to stop, but I didn’t want to put myself as Spiderman. He kept saying things and then he grabbed my hand and made me touch him under his pants. I ended up punching him and running back home.”
“Me neither. In the Depression we didn’t exactly have the time to travel off for something like this, let alone the money to afford the gear and shelter. We can figure it out together, alright? And you can call me Steve.”
Tony’s heart broke as he realized how many insecurities Steve had been hiding. Steve halfheartedly tried to shake him off, but he just held on tighter. “You aren’t weak. You’re one of the smartest and strongest people I know. I don’t like you because of the attributes you got from the serum or the superhero image you project. I like you because you're the man who was intelligent enough to navigate an entirely new world. The man who was strong and stubborn enough to make his place in a modern world. The man who was kind enough to take care of my emotional mess of a person after my break up. The man who forced me to keep myself healthy. Wait, that’s wrong. I don’t like you just because you take care of me. I like the cute cartoons of the team doing ordinary things. The way you adore Netflix documentaries. Your integrity to follow through with promises. Your loyalty to the side of justice. The way you’re willing to sacrifice everything you are for the greater good. Actually, don’t sacrifice yourself. I’m not great at this…”
Natasha smirked at him knowingly and rolled her eyes when Clint started speaking again. “What’s your type? There are so many female SHIELD agents. Fancy any of them?”
Steve couldn’t move from his spot as Tony ran upstairs, turning his head to hide the tears that had started to leak down his cheeks.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand, attempting to reassure him. His grip was extremely weak. Panic just surged up and through Tony again.
“Yeah, the communists were supposably ‘godless’ so they made sure to become extra religious here to prove they weren’t communist.”
Tony heard knocked on the door and “Tony? It’s Bucky. I’m need to talk to you.” Without waiting for the door to open, Bucky strolled in.
“Charlie was Stevie’s friend.” Bucky answered suggestively “I think they have a name these days. They were...” Bucky trailed off in thought before snapping and lifting his head up “Friends with Benefits!”
“Yeah. Back home Ma and I barely had mattresses, we were practically sleeping straight on the bed frame. During the war, we slept on the ground or worn down beds if we were lucky. When I woke up, I couldn’t sleep in these beds. The mattresses and bedding is so soft. It reminded me that I was in the future. That everyone I’d known was dead or near death. Now, I like the future, I’ve got new friends. The feeling of being out of control still creeps up though. I get flashbacks of the plane falling, of the icy water filling the plane.”
Clint shrugged it off as Tony’s eccentricities. Natasha raised an eyebrow, but didn’t say anything as she dug back into her meal.
Bucky spun around with his hands up for Steve to examine. He made a twirl motion to gesture that Steve should do the same.
Tony, probably from the sleep deprivation, stumbled right as Steve spun around and spilled his fresh cup of coffee all over Steve’s shirt.
I love input about my writing whether it's bad or good. If you notice something I could improve, go ahead and let me know because I'm always trying to be better.
“Are you alright?” Peter face stiffened In concern and he reached a hand out to feel Tony’s forehead. “I told you all of those late nights would make you sick.”
Peter smiled and put down the volcanic ash one. He put his finger in the blue, de-stressing one and spread it thinly across Bucky’s forehead.
It was a little odd that no one had been on the comms since he did the check up. Usually there were jokes and complaints galore after a fight. Clint begging for food, Natasha threatening to fly back alone if everyone didn’t hurry up, Tony laughing at screen grabs from the playback of the battle, Thor promising a large feast, and Bruce begging someone in medical to stop squirming.
“There isn’t an ‘under God’ in it.” Steve’s eyebrows furrowed in concentration. “I’ve said it at least half a million times from my younger days. It was definitely correct.”
In the meantime, Steve was walking back in the rain. He had brought a jacket and the tower was only about a twenty minute walk at his pace. He brushed a finger along his own lips and blushed. He hadn’t meant to run away, but as soon as Tony’s lips hit his, all he could think was “Danger. I need to leave right now.”
Steve was suspicious now, but he knew Tony wouldn’t hurt him. He hoped it wasn’t some giant over-the-top surprise. Tony enjoyed giving extravagant gifts and Steve knew it was his way of showing love, but sometimes they were just too much. He reached in his pocket for a paper from earlier and realized he must have left it in the living room.
“Coming?” Peter was looking over his shoulder at Tony with a confused look on his face. The other three were already several yards away, listening to the animated speech of the employee. Tony rushed to catch up with them and see what the commotion was about.
“Okay?” Steve was a bit confused at Tony’s strong reaction but settled back in. “That’s alright. You don’t need to rush.” He quickly found himself dozing off to the humming of Tony’s arc reactor and the swell of his chest as he breathed.
Pepper sighed and left Steve to draw in peace. Tony scrambled after her. “Don’t worry, I’ve got this.”
“You didn’t say ‘under God’ in the Pledge of Allegiance during the memorial ceremony. They’re blowing this up way too much.” Clint supplied. “It’s just been this whole thing recently. Like should kids have to say ‘under God’ when they recite the Pledge even if they’re in a public school? Does that God refer specifically to the Christian God or can it be taken as any higher power you want to worship to? Etcetera. Etcetera.”
Peter and Tony laughed a little before recognizing that something was off. "He’s not breathing” Peter observed. Steve’s eyes were open, but they were erratically jumping to different spots in the room. He was shivering way more than expected and he was hyperventilating. He was panicking.
“What’s that?” Tony’s heart started pounding. That list of illnesses was daunting enough, what could make it worse?
Tony’s mind drifted to images of Steve’s pink cheeks. He purposely made more jokes around the man because of that adorable expression. It was one of many faces that Tony couldn’t get enough of - Steve laughing at his favorite sitcom, Steve intensely staring at his unfinished artwork, Steve giving the puppy dog eyes to try and convince the team to participate in an activity, Steve scolding Clint for reckless behavior, Steve fussing over Tony’s small injuries, basically any expression Steve made.
“Okay, you don’t have to talk about it. I just want you to know that I’m here if you need me for anything. I’m not leaving unless you want me to.” Tony did his best to try and keep his voice calm to hide his concern.
Steve’s eyes filled with doubt, “You don’t have to lie out of pity. I know you’ve been avoiding me. You’d probably get bored with me eventually. I’m not very smart or personable. Hell, I can’t even figure out the tablet you gave me. Maybe it’s for the best.”
“All their weapons were in the other room right? This looks like a medical area. I don’t think they’d keep dangerous stuff with their first aid supplies. It might be valuable medicine.”
The full effect of Steve’s new condition hit Tony like a ton of bricks. Obviously, Tony knew the serum gave Steve superpowers that made him Captain America, but he’d still been thinking about the whole thing in a somewhat vain perspective. He’d considered that Steve might be insecure because of his shorter height and less muscular physique or that he might feel upset that he couldn’t fight villains anymore. He hadn’t considered the fact that Steve was changed internally. That deserumed Steve had to fight for his life on the daily. Steve was fragile.
“-you said you could nap, right? Why don’t we nap together for increasingly long periods of time? It’ll be during the day when it’s light out. What do you think?” Tony finished his offer.
“Wait, did you just offer to help?” Tony was curious now. He still had a couple minute before another wave hit him. “How did that work?” Tony couldn’t imagine Steve trying to convince a teammate to have sex with him because he was super horny even if that teammate was his best friend. Steve seemed like the type to be too worried about danger or consent issues or being impolite, or too stuck in his ways of dealing with his issues by himself.
Here are my oneshots for the Marvel Fandom! They’re all ships between established characters in the Marvel Universe!
"OI WHAT THE FUCK RHODEY WERE YOU GOING NOT TO OPEN-" big brown eyes shot up to meet blue wide, scared eyes staring at him. Him. Who was dressed in a skimpy elf outfit and was now faced with a piece of a hunk that even in his wettest dreams he couldn't have even imagined.
A shiver ran down the woman's spine at the sensation of his cold breath against her warm skin. In a few seconds she was pulled up by her hand and secured inside her coat and the two of them are marching out the pub in the cool air of the city at night.
Toni yelped out loud: she expected the pain of course, but not the insane pleasure that came after the bite. She felt her power give out, making her limp at Steven’s mercy.
She gasped for air when she felt Steve’s fangs leave her thigh, dribbles of blood were traveling down her perfect skin.
At those words Steve let out a loud groan: "oh no I hope he didn't tell you the time he got stuck in the woods naked!"
Like a predator stalking his prey he pumped inside the writhing woman under him. “Y-yes- t-there Steven- the-OH”
Fact is: no touching, no kissing, no cuddling for much too long. And this needed to end immediately.
"Thank you" the genius's smile was so soft in Steve's eyes (yes, he even found out that he was actually a genius). The moment was so sweet that Rogers could resist: he leaned close, pecking Tony's lips feather lightly, barely letting the other understand what was happening.
The vampire grinned wide, a lopsided smirk that made his face lit up with a sort of madness in it. His eyes immediately went darker, even redder in the pupils: "are you willing to be my feeder?"
"How did you find the party? Am I the best party thrower or not?", Tony grinned around the rim of his glass before drowning its content and hissing at the tingling sensation.
"Yes, they used to scream as soon as they saw us. Not knowing that we actually don't kill our feeders, unless they misbehave"
"like what you see?", the latter flirted lightly while making a slow twirl showing off perfect toned legs and just a glimpse of booty. Steven blushed madly and just shook his head heavily: "N-No I'm just trying to understand what kind of prank is even this"
His hand kneaded her right breast, feeling the hard nipple underneath her dress. He pulled back slurping her blood away from his fangs, licking enthusiastically.
The only thing that distracted him from her eyes was the movement of her hand bringing the glass of champagne to her plump, red lips.
When he finally pulled back she was a panting mess, struggling to push down her dress completely. She turned once again: her body was in full display now. It felt like he was at the feet of a deity, a holy shrine he was soon to enter.
"I said, would you like to grab a drink nearby?", Toni grinned deviously even if slightly irritated. She liked when men listened to her and gave her their full attention, no exceptions for vampires.
The vampire knelt up, yanking off his shirt tossing it to the side, he unbuckled his pants and whipped the leather belt to the side.
The way her body arched against the mattress, her breasts almost brushing against his arm made him understand that he hit the right spot.
She willingly opened her lips sucking on his tongue: it felt kind of weird to feel it so cold against her own warm mouth.
Steven pulled back from the breath-taking kiss, leaving a small peck under her chin as he once again lowered himself on her. Her body quivering under him, ready and in anticipation.
Oh hell no. Steve apparently was a total hunk and a sweetie massive beefcake with morals?! Tony wasn't letting go that easily. "Oh no baby, you're gonna hear me rant for the whole night before I leave you alone". The other laughed heartedly and showed the way to the living room.
The blond grabbed his thighs lifting them up and starting to pull out and snap back inside: “ah! Sh-shit- so tight- yes. Fuck-Tony”. He quickly undid the jacket of the uniform tossing it to the side, staying in his shirt as Tony pulled on the tie: “K-kiss me baby- ah! please-”, and Steve once again failed not to being stunned by the beauty below him, kissing way too lovingly for the moment, but adoring the way his husband became compliant just by a gentle kiss. The shorter man threw his arms up around his soldier’s shoulders clinging on him as Steve started to thrust harder, making him feel every inch ad every snap. He rolled his hips slower as he pulled back from Tony’s mouth: “Tony. So perfect-Gosh-”, and he was back at thrusting harder, snapping his hips strongly. Tony’s vision going blurry at the beautiful sensation, moaning out loud, arching his back, throwing his legs up and down squeezing Steve’s hips and digging his heels into the small of his back encouraging him to go harder and harder.
"Don't be so harsh with them, they don't have eternity to think about if vampires appear in pictures or not. Let them dream of the moment they will have some power over us with some blackmail"
"Good...you were listening", her fingers circled the rim of the glass. Her eyes going down watching her own movements and then up to Steve's ones
"Tony? Are you with us?", Pepper brushed her hand up Tony's arm. He shook his head out of his trance and looked at her with a forced smile: "Yes. Yes, pardon me I...", and Steve's eyes were gone once again looking at Sam now, "...I got distracted".
Steve looked down at her, eyes roaming up and down her body. His hands joined his eyes pushing up her dress, feeling her inner thighs: "fuck...your skin is so soft…" he leaned down, kissing up her skin, her smell filing up his nostrils and lungs.
The vampire leaned down to kiss up her neck, smelling his scent on her. The woman tilted her head kissing his slow and tender, in stark contrast with their latest activity.
They both smiled, way too polite for the atmosphere that was forming between them. Images of her naked on his bed were already forming in Steve's mind, hopefully she wasn't that resistant.
"Did you enjoy your party?", Steve broke the silence, turning his face to the other once again, smiling softly in his own unique way. Stark just nodded, stealing a water bottle from the counter and opening it.
At this Bucky, the brunet friend, laughed out loud, bending his back slightly and patting his chest with his hand. His family ring shining under the lights: "They are hopeful for real, aren't they?!"
"You did the same! But I dont blame you, I know the effect I have on people", Tony just shrugged knowing this would have earned him a joke or at least an eye-roll from the other, or he hoped to earn those.
The blond stood back in front of her, stroking one lock of hair behind her ear: "got shy all of a sudden?"
Her thoughts didn't have time to evolve since his tongue was already pushing against her labia, collecting wetness and making Steve slurp on it.
Steven didn't wait long when he saw the elegant figure walking down the stairs. Her red dress is now covered by a thick coat and a fluffy scarf.
And Tony was gone. He licked his palm like a good bathing cat, slicking it up as much as possible and reached down, loving the sensation of Steve in his hand, both at his mercy and controlling him with just a few words. In the meantime the soldier leaned down: he bit, licked, sucked at Tony’s neck and jaw, making sure to leave bruises for the days to come. Loving the sounds the other was making as he pulled the plug out, tossing it to the side for later. He took the occasion of Tony’s moan to shove his tongue in his mouth, tasting it enthusiastically and letting their tongue twist and tangle together.
"That despite being one of the few women at MIT you felt at home there way more than with your parents"
Nonetheless, the blond looked up and- wow- he locked eyes with two light blue pools studying him like a manuscript. The woman had long lashes, just a black line of eyeliner complimenting the shape of her lids.
Once again Steve was in his space. What was it with him invading people like this, very american of him.
The two glanced at each other, locking eyes once again. The blush spreading on her cheekbones was of the most beautiful and lively tone he'd ever seen until that moment. Outside, in the empty street, he could smell her better without being distracted by the drinks and food passing around.
They both collapsed down  onto the bed, Steve making sure to lie sideways not to crash Tony. They lied there panting in silence: Tony closing his eyes with a soft contented sigh and a sly smirk on his face, Steve staring at him gently caressing his torso and undoing the corset. Tony smirked and hummed: “Let’s not wait this long next time…” ”I agree on that Mr. Stark-Rogers”, and Steve’s hand was stroking the brunet’s chest opening the top of Tony’s chorus girl uniform even more.”That’s a first”, he teased.”You know that’s not even remotely true, baby boy”The other chuckled and opened his eyes smiling over to his husband: “Maybe, but I like when I tease””You know me so well uhu”, and the blond leaned in kissing him lovingly, taking his time to push off the corset and slipping it off of Tony, taking off the skirt too and tossing everything to the side. ”Getting me naked after sex?”, he chuckled again at the soldier’s annoyed expression.”Shut up smartass, someone gotta clean ya”, and with that Captain America stood and disappeared into the bathroom to run warm water in the sink.
