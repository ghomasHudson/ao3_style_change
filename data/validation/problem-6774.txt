Dvorak snorted to himself, folding the page of the letter he’d long ago stopped reading. Loyal like a dog was Rogers. No matter how many times his cause kicked him in the side, he always came crawling back. They could all turn on him and he would keep his mouth (for the first time) firmly shut.
Consequently, there was hardly anything to keep Steve’s mind form straying into territory that he’d rather it didn’t go. Keeping his demons on a tight leash through work, was something he was an expert in. He’d had to be, or he wouldn’t have survived this long. In a war, if you couldn’t focus on the mission at hand and only that you put your men in danger. You had to lock all your concerns for you family and your life into a small box and shut the lid.
They went to the opera that night and sat in the box with Thor and Siv. Maria was instantly smitten with the prince (no surprise there) but unexpectedly (for Steve at least) he ended up as smitten with her as she was with him. He let her sit between him and Siv and answered all her many whispered questions about Norway (Where is it? Is it very green? Do they speak French there?) with attention and good humor.
sister,” Steve tried to make light, tried to banish that terrible look off of Bucky’s face but when his prala laughed the sound was almost as bitter as his expression.
“I’m fine.” He panted with all the strength he had left and then heaved himself over onto his side, and threw up.
Steve had seen livelier eyes on corpses. The blue of Schmidt’s eyes was like ice, void and frozen. When he did move there was not an ounce of gentlemanly pretense to his posture.
Frau Hogan told them to wear several layers of scratchy sweaters under their jackets and Natacha had stitched bright yellow stars to them, so that they wouldn't look like Germans anymore.
It was an endearing sight to be sure. He was glad for their sake that the authorities had enough mercy left in them to put them in the care of their mother's kin. They would need a woman's tender devotion after the horrible way they'd lost their father. The way they'd been made to bury their grief and disavow him was a senseless cruelty on top of it that Deiter found it hard to stomach.
Tony poured the dirty water onto the bare patch of dirt just outside the kitchen door, sighing at his ill luck that the servants would have the day off the exact Saturday that Artur and three of his siblings to come up with the idea to try and make bricks out of mud because they all wanted to be stone masons.
The iron bars of the front gate loomed above Tony as he stood outside the villa Captain Rogers and his family called home. A pigeon, sleek and thin, with head bobbing, landed on the heavy gate to pass judgment and ignored Tony's grunted attempts to get the damn thing open. The little rats had convened the moment Tony arrived, their little bodies poised upon the gate like gargoyles.
"Is it so hard for you to believe I care? You say the children will be safe, but then you rush into every danger available to you. I'm tired of asking what happens if you die."
“That’s not very ladylike, but given the giant hole you’ve got in your side we’ll forget we ever heard it.” Scott quipped and she made a rude gesture at him that had him grinning.
“They haven't time either. I’ll need a table, Dobas.” Steve interjected, his voice earring on the side of military command. Kurt blinked at him, taken aback by his brusk tone, but thankfully even he had been too long a soldier not to hop to when spoken to in that tone by a commanding officer.
“Y-Yes,” Ian interrupted the couple, shifting from foot to foot in order to warm himself.  Now that he was standing still, he felt light headed, like he had to sit down. “My name is... Edwin. My father and I were out hunting and… we got separated. I’m turned around.”
“A shame then, to spend it on the road.” Tony mused and Rogers paused to pin him with a smile so banal it was pointed.
The cool air that had surrounded her thus far seemed to warm a bit as she contemplated his words, but she held her head up high and didn’t look at him as she poured herself a cup of tea.
Part two. Once again, heavy warnings for violence, antisemitism, child endangerment,  and an additional warning for dub-con. Steve is not intentionally malicious here, but both he and Tony are in a state of duress and the lines of consent get crossed. I think we've made it clear what Tony decides he needs in that moment but that doesn't make it right. In other words, don't try this shit at home. I'm serious, don't try any of it.
“Too much wine and an eagerness to fight, sounds about right. Slow down, Major. We’ve got the whole evening ahead of us.” Khalmmer laughed, the sound bright and clean, easing the nervous tension in the group. Steve blinked at him, taking in the ease with which he play acted with new apprehension. Khalmmers hands were clasped behind his back now. Like loaded springs.
“I do have a staff Susann. They run the house just fine.” Steve grumbled. Susan hummed, but it sounded doubtful. She was still smiling pleasantly however when she asked.
"I don't know. I don't know whether you're coming or going. Whether you're a sinner, a saint, or the very devil himself, Stefen Rogers!" he heard a voice that sounded like his say over the rushing of blood in his ears. "But I know what you're not. And you're not one of them are you? Gypsy boy."
But the Nazis weren’t really asking for his opinion, so Steve just did as his commanding officers expected him to do. He showed up in uniform and meandered around the room with Tony at his side, and tried to ignore that he was being presented like another piece in Göring’s collection as he was introduced to guest after guest as ‘the lion of Austria’ and exclaimed over.
Tony’s heart fell into his stomach. His pulse raced as he released a shuddered breath and laughed. He leaned down, gripping Stefen’s hands with both of his now, and pressed his lips against the clammy skin on the backside of Stefen’s wrist to hide how quickly he was crumbling.
Steve was gratified that even Stark did not think it wise to try and combat that sharply worded command, the monk nodding silently and scrambling to keep up with Stefen's long strides as he exited the room.
“No!” Dvorak shook his head like a rabid dog snarling right back, “We had the chance! We could have killed him! We had the chance and we-”
Had he? That was a surprise to him. But maybe it shouldn’t be. Charlotte looked back at the music room, soft affection gliding over her face.
Natacha had mulled it over for a moment before finally nodding in agreement to the deal, smoothing out the now wrinkled bundle and placing it back on top of the pile in her trunks. One more crisis dealt with Tony’s attention had been pulled away by the sight of Maria passing the door with an armload of books taller than she was.
Still, Tony was forced to concede that they were right, Stefen was well enough for Tony to take his eyes off of him for a few hours, to spend some time with the children if not to bathe and eat a hot meal.
"Uh-oh, better catch us some food then." Bakhuizen teased as he passed them, on his way to procure dry clothing. Stefen wasn't the only one blessed with a fine figure Tony noted abstractly.
Stark was part of that now. No. Stark was the start: the wave of reverb that had sent them spinning back into place.
It was a few moments more before there was a gentle knock on the door, and Bucky crossed the room to let the arrivals in.
Natacha felt cold and suddenly very small. Father had never said as much. When they heard stories, rumors of families kicked out of their homes, people arrested and disappearing without word, they were always assured it was only happening to the bad people. People who were against the Reich, or people who were jealous and greedy and out to destroy all that good hardworking Germans had built like the Jews.
“Enough,” Bucky barked, glaring around at them all. “Stefen’s going to be executed in five days, while we stand here with our thumbs up our asses. Call yourselves sons-of-whores for all I care, so long as you focus on the damn mission!”
“Naturally if they cross our borders to kill good Germans we will do what is necessary to protect our people.” Striker continued, relaxing back into his seat. “Just as we must do with the growing threat from these Czech roaches.”
“Oh, this is Ian, James, Artur,” Steve began to rattle off, gesturing to each child as he went. “The shy one is Maria and – “Sara marched forward and back in parade just like they did at home and Tony laughed. Steve’s cheeks felt hot.
The powerful vehicle and the speed and confidence with which she handled it, all while looking like a doll was a potent combination. Tony found her almost aggressively attractive, and the realization was strangely comforting. It felt good to feel the flush of desire uncomplicated by history, fear, or heartache. Was it such a crime to allow himself to revel in that simplicity?
If Tony noticed the change in address he didn't show it. He continued to play with the same finesse as before, the careful timber of the piano slow enough to rake Steve's nerves.  Enough of this.
“How do you know what I was thinking?” he managed to mumble, because it had been a strange thing to say when really he could have been thinking anything at all. Anamarie leaned back on her palms and shrugged.
His father couldn't eat and Péter had seen blood on the towels Bucky had been using to wipe his mouth. Péter knew what all those things meant. He'd watched both his grandmother and his mother get sick and die before this, so he knew what it looked like.
He knocked smartly on the closed door, more for show than anything because he barely waited for a reply before trying the knob, feeling a surge of savage delight when it twisted easily and he thrust open the door.
Tony watched James scamper off, happy to see him so active again with no sign of the wheeze that had plagued him the week previous. While he and his siblings were occupied with the sled, Tony took the rare moment of peace to himself to take another inventory of their supplies. He did not allow himself to think about the past as he worked, only the future (only forward) because there was no fixing the road behind them. They had to be ready for what was ahead, and Tony believed fervently in preemptive action verses reactive. Reacting was what had consumed Stefen’s whole life. Reacting had got them here in the first place. They needed to anticipate. Anticipate. Adapt. Evolve.  That was how they’d survive this.
Frowning, Tony called for the boy’s attention and patted the empty seat next to him (Artur having claimed a spot on his father’s lap some time ago). Silently Ian crossed the isle and gingerly took the seat offered to him. His shoulders were still slumped but the tension in them eased somewhat when Tony wrapped an arm around him.
It was an entire room full to the brim with art. Tony’s heart thudded, the closest he’d felt to feeling at home since he’d arrived. This would be useful. As Tony wandered further inside he wondered absently who the musician in the family was. He supposed with seven children, at least one of them had to play, even if, judging from the dust floating in the air, it was years ago. Even in this room, meant for company, everything was untouched, nearly abandoned feeling.
“Are you mad?!” he turned water dripping steadily from the dark spikes of his hair and into his eyes, which glared hotly at Bucky with something like hatred.
“The uncles… these were men in your village? You both talk as if you were all family but you and Bakhuizen don’t share blood… do you?”
“I could play in my grave Charlotte. This won’t be a problem.” He took another swallow from his cup, just to take the edge off. She sighed, her mouth pinching a little at the corner.
Dr. Fischer raised a brow, his expression unchanged, as if it wasn't even a possibility that they would arrive and find that the worst of the rumors were true, that Rogers was not ill but merely defiant.
Tony watched as the two traded places, and Péter began untangling the coils of rope they'd brought with them. Péter looked tired, and Tony was glad that he seemed to know his own limits and wasn’t letting a thing like pride keep him from taking a break when he needed it. Péter was filling out more, but his body wasn't used to manual labor. Ian on the other hand had spent more time building up his physic, what with all those morning drills.
“Thank you.” Bucky grunted out, gritting past the pain in his arm to hoist himself up. He could warm up inside. Sweet mother of god, he’d kiss a harry tit for a glass of Willamina’s cider!
Her mother. Natacha's boots crunched in the snow as she walked, slow and steady around the house toward the sitting room window she'd left cracked open for her return. The answer had come to her.
“Eat your roll, Ian” Tony admonished and Ian’s hand halted halfway to James plate, while the younger boy’s glare intensified.
“Can I help you fi-” she called out to him and he cut her off, ignoring the way her face settled into an unconvinced masked.
“For this.” His fingers had drifted to his pocket. “They have no proof, but they wanted their message to take.”
You could also, coincidently, use it to carry the highly combustible explosives you’d made; but that was a selling point Tony felt it was better to leave out for the time being. No need for anyone to get nervous.
“Did you...” Péter fumbled to a stop, suddenly embarrassed to ask after Tony. He wasn’t sure why. Herr Stark was their tutor after all. Part of them. The household that was. Father had always maintained that the household was important, even the staff, because they were all family and as head of the house it was very important for him to care for the people within it. With Father gone that meant Péter was the head.
The door latch that Tony and he were finishing was an equally simple design. A small notch of wood nailed to the side of the door with a larger plank atop it. Another plank nailed to the door itself, long enough to swing into the space between the two and prevent the door from opening.
The laundry maids usually didn’t get up till later in the morning but Hammer and Julia came along around six thirty or so to start the day bright and early.
He heard the fire of guns over the roar of the wind as it flip his hair around his ears, as well as each ominous thud and ping as they struck dirt and grazed the sides of the truck. Bucky continued to swerve and Tony fell into the back of the truck bed, jarring his shoulder painfully as he landed.
“The sheets. When was the last time they were changed?” he snapped toward Pepper, but it was Bucky who answered full of piss and vinegar, as if he’d heard Tony’s uncharitable thought.
He gripped the table as he began to shake, and another sob tore from his throat. His children’s voices continued to drift softly through his mind, their faces to swim before his eyes, and he bit his tongue hard, squeezing his eyes closed.
It had started with places: people Sam had known and Steve through Sam. Stories upon stories comprising eleven years of friendship, well worn by retelling; and it had slowly branched out into a life that Sam had lived before coming to work for him, that Steve was realizing, too late to do anything about, that he’d known very little of.
“You mean they’ll arrest you for being disloyal. They’ll take us away from you.” She predicted fearfully, hoping that was all there was to it, that the things that kept her up at night weren’t true. “Then take it back! Tell Ian and the others that you didn’t mean it – ”
“The boats have dried,” Tony heard himself announce and the quiet chatter between Bakhuizen and the children dwindled. James and Artur sat up straighter in their seats, already eager for what they hoped he’d say next. Tony didn’t disappoint them.
When Tony had blurted out that his son had helped the monk build a working radio from scraps up in the attic, he'd been shocked and demanded to see it (in part hoping that the trip would distract Tony from the conversation for the time being).
“Don’t thank me till we get them past the gestapo.” he said as Harold appeared in the doorway to signal that the car was ready for departure.
It was strange to feel so happy in the middle of so much misfortune but he couldn’t seem to help that feeling any more he could his distaste for the Baroness.
Natasha Romanoff is fiction, but I think she shares the spirit of these women and I am glad I could use this story to bring them to your attention.
Bruce gave a small nod, as if he’d known all along and Tony hadn’t just admitted something to boggle the mind of any sane man. The little smile that curled around his mouth looked somehow both satisfied and sad as his eyes came up once more and met Tony’s with knowing.
In Pola their butler Jarvis let Tony trail along behind him, and had never stopped him from asking questions (or made him feel stupid for not already knowing their answers). His mother wore loose silks and bright colors to rival the deep aquamarine of the waters, and she wore her hair down, singing more… laughing more. Nowhere else had ever compared.
"You've been through so much, the last few months. I'm sorry I didn’t shield you the way I should have... and that I've not been a better father to you." Steve looked at his children, forcing himself to look each one in the eye. He had been to war, seen death, even faced the prospect of losing his best friend and his lover on the same day, but this still felt like the most difficult thing he'd ever done.
And so it went, Tony sat alone at his table while the train lurched along, passing through fields and hills and skirting the edges of towns that from the outside, almost looked as if they hadn’t been touched at all by Hitler’s rise, and he tried to distract himself with his book but largely failed.
She seemed, on the surface, to be dealing with everything as best she could. But looking at her now, Tony began to rethink. Perhaps not.
“Why do you think I am lying?” She asked, completely guileless. “It’s not the first time I’ve fallen.”
The Führer was meeting with the leaders of France, Britain and Italy to discuss his aggressive actions against the Czechs in the city of Munich that very evening. They hoped to strong arm him into backing down from the idea of reclaiming the border lands for Germany and to negotiate some sort of resolution for continued peace. It was a peace everyone knew they would never achieve. Hitler refused to back down no matter who advised him it was the wisest course, and there would have to be war as a result. Until then, it was a waiting game. It was the waiting that was the worst part. Always was.
“Pete…” he lets out brokenly, already reduced to heart wenching sobs because he knows he just knows what’s about to happen next.
Tony looked at the letter in his hand one more time, just to double check that he hadn’t misread the information as it was pretty unbelievable after all, he glanced up at the wall helplessly and then down again at the letter in his hand to read it for what felt like the hundredth time.
Actually, maybe not Tony thought to himself, Lily might have registered him in the muggle world, he knew after all that she and James marriage is also valid there on her insistence.
When the pain he felt the instance the gauntlet was on him gone, Tony knew he just knew that somehow Peter was responsible. So he looks to where he saw him last but he’s not there he’s beside Tony.
“Kid we can’t just do that type of surgery out of nowhere, we need to prep and we would need your aunts permission” Tony argues back.
“Gross I knew that stuff was coming out of you” pipes up Sam, completely ignoring the tense atmosphere in the room.
‘Tony no one can know that you have him… Harry is in danger and if you take him in and I hope you do so will you… They will come for him… Voldemort wasn’t after me or James… He wants Harry… Keep him safe Tony’
The others wanted him in there, to preserve his body for the funeral they argued. But before that can happen the world needs fixing, Peter isn’t their priority but he’s Tony’s.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t even know that he was holding and shook himself from his melancholy thoughts, they would do him no good. He was here for a reason and that was so he could finally gain his independence and get out from Dumbledore’s thumb.
Harry could say without a doubt that he did not see that coming and he was also extremely confused some of the results were expected and others not but that could easily be explained and the rest, Harry didn’t know how they could possibly be explained. He handed the parchment to Sirius at his insistent nudging, he could see his godfather’s eyes widening the further down he read that was a good sign; shows he wasn’t keeping things from Harry.
Peter just stands there confused before looking around the room he’s eyes landing on Bucky.  Peter stares at Bucky’s arm, realising he still has his, the damaged dying one and he knows for him to fully heal he needs to get rid of it. To stop the damage from spreading.
“Sorry cap, this is important as well (Tony didn’t  actually know if this was true or not) and besides I’m retired remember? I’m sure whatever it is it doesn’t need the whole team”
They had been in the office of his lawyer for the last two hours going over the parts of his inheritance that is held in the muggle world mainly what he had inherited from his mum and surprisingly quite a bit from the Malfoy side of his family tree. (And wasn’t that a treat to find out that he was related to the stuck up ferret)
“You are in a way, your arm is dying to stop the damage spreading and in its place a new one will grow”
Still he’s too slow from stopping Tony getting the gauntlet off Thanos but not too slow to use the distraction of Thanos realising he doesn’t have the stones anymore to take them from Tony.
“The pain would of killed you before you even finished healing, but because you’re here you don’t feel pain so your body can concentrate on the actual problem instead of just the symptoms of the problem.
Sirius argues that Tony would without argument take him in, he adored his little sister and would of done anything for her.
They were trapped and James was... She spun round on her heels frantically hoping desperately that maybe Voldemort had forgotten to put up wards, when that didn't work she tried her emergency portkey that all order members had that would take them to the hogwarts infirmary.
It was an ironic twist that fate had Morgan’s and Peter’s birthdays on the same day. Tony thinks it’s a blessing and a curse because he’s never as sad as he would be if Peter’s was on a different day but he’s never as happy as he would be if Morgan’s was on another day.
Tony was confused, and he had to question why Obadiah would even keep this from him, none of the man’s actions made any sense, after his death Tony had found a box of his stuff and it only led to more questions. He shook himself from his thoughts thinking Obi always just brought back the betrayal that had apparently been going on from the moment he had met the man.
Peter nods and takes her hand and the three of them continue to walk until something something changes.
He had thought that he had gotten ridden of the girl when he convinced Howard and Maria to give the bitch up; Even at the young age Obadiah knew that Lily Stark possessed an intellect and perceptiveness for beyond what was normal for her age and would soon surpass both her father and brother and therefore she had to go before she could become a problem. If any of the Starks would figure out what he was up to it would be her. It was a blessing that she was dead in his opinion, he placed the letter in desk draw he would place it in his safe at home when he left to go home.
Thor just shook his head in response, they had gotten into this argument many times before, he grew tired.
“Clint!” The captain scolded “we have to be sensitive to Peter’s pain, it must have been a hard decision to make”
Vernon Dursley was a creature of habit; therefore, his everyday habits were quite easy to predict something that came in quite handy for his nephew. His days always began and ended the exact same way, and it was because of this that Harry found it extremely easy to avoid his uncle and slip out of the house unnoticed when he was supposed to be doing his chores.
The first thing that he notices, other than the pain that he was growing through was numerous heartbeats all around him; it sound as if the whole team was huddled around his bed, which would exactly be a
Peter was scared, ever since the spider bite his senses had been dialled to 11, his world washed with colour, sounds and smells now he couldn’t sense anything.
And he was an avenger, it doesn’t matter that it was never official, that the team was broken up when he came onto the scene.
The whole battlefield let’s out a breath when they realise nothing happen and they look to Tony suddenly scared.
If Peter had been there it would have been his twenty-first birthday. Finally the adult he so desperately wanted to be. Instead when Tony sees him next he’s still going to look sixteen, he will still be sixteen.
'I have a bad feeling Tony, I know that something is going to happen with Sirius that will stop him from looking after Harry, he was named godfather and Alice a friend of mine from school is his godmother, but I fear she is facing a fate worse than death in the oncoming days.'
They had made the appointment in the muggle world to make it harder for anyone to track what they were up to, there were some of course that still could but it brought him and Sirius some time and lessen the pressure on them.
He feels like a crap father when he can’t be there hundred percent for Morgan on her special day. But he knows that even though she’s sad, she understands why, there was never a chance in any universe where Tony wouldn’t tell her about her big brother Peter.
“And where would be look?” Gamora asks, speaking for the first time since they came back from the soul world.
If anyone would have asked, Mr and Mrs Vernon and Petunia Dursley would exclaim quiet adamantly that they were perfectly normal people with a perfectly normal family, there would be no mention of their quite abnormal nephew and Mrs Dursley’s abnormal sister and brother in law. They would of course also have said that that perfectly normal Wednesday evening was as perfectly normal as all Wednesdays prior. After all, in true Dursley predictable behaviour they had begun the day same as they always do.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t even know that he was holding and shook himself from his melancholy thoughts, they would do him no good. He was here for a reason and that was so he could finally gain his independence and get out from Dumbledore’s thumb.
There’s a lull in the fighting once more where Peter catches Mr Starks eye again and just as he looks away his Spidey sense kicks into high gear.
For a moment he contemplated leaving his nephew with whoever he was with now, but it was dismissed the next second. That was his baby sister’s son, his own flesh and blood, and Tony had to at the very least check to make sure that the child, Harry was okay.
He hadn’t seen the freak in a while, he better not be up to any of his freakish tricks he thought to himself again.
He grabbed hold onto Sirius’ proffered arm and his godfather spun on his heel and for a spilt second, they both experienced the nauseating sensation of being squeezed through a tight tube and being spat out on the other end. Thankfully Harry was much better at side along apparition than flooing and managed to land on his feet quite gracefully. No sooner had they left, the flower beds began to wilt, and an unusual chill swept through the streets.
No one knows it but putting Peter in a cytogenetic chamber was the best thing they could of done for him because it shuts down his body and puts it into hibernation, so it doesn’t need to waste the energy it has stored away on everyday functions and can just concentrate on healing.
Harry owned a lot to his godfather in fact, he knew everything about the order of the phoenix and their current movements and he knew more importantly of the meddling of a certain old breaded wizard. Dumbledore had enacted a communication blackout on Harry, something that all his so-called friends had no problem following despite the fact that Harry had only just a short few weeks ago witnessed the death of his boyfriend Cedric not that those traitors were privy to that little titbit of information. His godfather was the only who knew and had bothered to keep in contact and make sure he was okay, well okay as he could be given the circumstances.
Harry looked around the room that they had just arrived in, it was quite ostentatious he thought but then again what else should he have excepted from the arrival room of Gringotts for the more affluent and elite of the goblin’s clientele. He was pulled from his observations by Sirius tugging on his arm and he began following his godfather and their goblin escort through the long and winding corridors of the underground bank; it left him quite disoriented when they finally arrived at the Black family’s account manager’s office, but he supposed that was the point. Nobody was stealing anything if they couldn’t find their way around the maze of corridors.
These diagrams were old. Older than anything else in the journal. A product of insomnia and the lingering taste of night terrors, something Tony often came back to in his most desperate hours when sleep had evaded him too long and the demons of his past encroached too close.
“Right. So you say you’re going to take down the Nazis. How?” Steve pushed down the emotions that Dernier’s letter had dug up, needing a clear head and focus.
“They would be some of these sematic barbarians that you’ve described, and yet we can all recall the Cimbrian war and its aftermath. Come, I’m eager to hear it from an expert. How is it that these inferior people were able to conquer their rightful masters?”
Precisely. Tony thought, but a groan from the inside the truck sent his heart racing again and he scrambled to hop out of the truck bed, calling Bucky's name.
They’d meant to keep his face clean. No strikes to the back of the head, nothing that could be fatal.
“It’s a man on foot...” Scott announced a moment later and Bucky’s shoulders slumped with relief. It could be someone looking for the aid of the priest, or one of their informants returning to them. He hoped it was Jann, who often traveled dressed as a boy when she didn’t wish to be recognized.
“You mean before Barney just dumped me there, like I was yesterday’s garbage?” Clint added sullenly, leaning further to snatch one of the pistols from Bucky’s offered hand.
Charlotte’s mother Anne, the Countess Von Schrader, started in soon as Tony had joined them and Tony was grateful if only because it meant distracting Steve from whatever staring contest he was having with the Count. Countess Anne bore a strong resemblance to her daughter even with the coffee brown curls piled atop her head, but there was a severity to her features that Charlotte did not possess. Tony couldn’t say that he’d seen so much as a smile from her since the Count and Countess had arrived, but as was expected, he flashed a show ready smile and accepted her praise with a slight nod of deference.
Artur struggled more with some of the extreme exercises, such as the hike the pimpfs had gone on where they'd been required to carry an eleven pound knapsack over thirteen miles, but he was stubborn as a goat. That and the fact that he was a Rogers coupled with his Ayran looks endeared him to his section leaders, who liked to remind everyone that his father had once been small too and look how he had turned out. The same did not apply to Péter, but then again Péter was unfortunate enough to get his mother's dark hair and eyes.
"Wanda has always seen the world differently. It's worse now since Dachau. The doctors there wanted to study us and Papa couldn't always stop them."
He sighed heavily at James deadpan expression. It wasn't so much irritating that he'd been caught not listening but rather the reason why.
Tony’s adolescent years had become a game of thumbing his nose at his father by shamelessly chasing every passing attraction, male or female, without a thought to the family name or the indecency of his actions. The only good thing about being forced to spend a quarter of his year in Germany with his parents was the red-light district in Hamburg.  He’d studied the full spectrum of human appetite quite thoroughly among the sailors who crowded Reeperbahn, but contrary to what his father might have imagined it wasn’t all rolled stockings, drag shows, and decadence. People said that love between two people of the same sex was a perversion, and that two men especially could never feel anything beyond a base and primitive sexual hunger for one another.
She thought about secrets that must be kept at all cost, and the sacrifices that must be made to keep them safe.
She caught Tony’s eye as she turned and took her place and he gave her a wink. Beaming she turned back to the crowd, and as the first notes of Bucky’s violin struck up she opened her mouth to sing.
Steve stared up at Tony and Tony stared back, his face coming closer as he shushed the babble that was pouring out of Steve’s mouth, his grip holding iron tight but his thumbs leaving soft, purposeful trails against Steve’s skin like someone molding clay. Steve trembled and above him Tony breathed heavily, his voice raw and thick as he rasped, “Alright. You’re alright, Stefen. I’ve got you.”
What kept him up most was he couldn’t stop thinking about how unfair it was, that he got to go someplace magical and make new friends and get everything he’d ever wanted – just because he was rich. Meanwhile that little girl was likely carrying everything she owned, while her parents prayed they’d be let into the country at all.
But no sounds came from within the cabin, and Bucky reappeared a moment later making a quick motion with one hand that Tony only just managed to make out in the dark. It was safe.
wouldn’t be received well considering that from their point of view, their father had started having headaches and then nearly did drop dead.
"I am dedicated to the good of Austria. Knowing more would only endanger you so do not ask. A few months ago a German team of researchers were dispatched to the prison camp at Dachau to begin a project heavily reliant on human experimentation. Information about this project is of great interest to those who do not wish to see the German army grow any stronger than they already have. Among the scientists involved is a man named Dr. Erik Lehnsherr, a celebrated geneticist. He is father to the twins and no friend of the Reich, but his compliance with their program was forced through their captivity. That is no longer the case."
Tony stumbled over the word hurt, unable to bring himself to voice the fear sitting heavy in his gut. Dead. He thought it but couldn’t say it. Péter might be dead.
Throat tight with emotion Steve silently folded the letter and placed it back in its envelope. It would have to be burned he knew, but he was loath to do it. Glad that at least for a little while he could keep his old friend’s words close to his chest.
“Stay close,” he warned, and Tacha nodded turning to make her way towards a group of older children, the others trickling behind her. He watched their retreating backs, ignoring whatever charming thing Khalmmer and Charlotte were saying to the small group clustered around them. Whatever Khalmmer had said, it sent another twitter of laugher through the group. Steve jerked as Khalmmer clapped him hard again on the shoulder. Alarm at the sudden touch jolting through him so quickly, his brain was unable to keep up with his instinctive reaction.
Anxiety tightened Tony’s chest. And why not? It was heavy material, featuring a cast of undesirables. Definitely not Reich approved.
He gestured for Natacha and the other two to stay and took a deep breath before darting across the few feet of open space between the tree line and the wall of the cabin.
"It's brother Simone," brother Vogel exclaimed in an excited whisper that was instantly and harshly shushed by Richter.
“That was a nice try, but I used that trick on Sara the other day.” Tony replied, laughing tiredly when Ian just nodded seriously and replied that he knew. He’d been watching.
Steve listened closely to the footsteps coming from the approaching guard. They emptied the bucket he used to relieve himself every fourth day and had done so two days ago. Aside from the over flow of watery shit and piss, the cell was relatively clean. Steve often had the bewildered thought that every time he was bound and manhandled out of his cell for interrogation some little toady was scrubbing and sweeping away his blood and filth. Some little minion paid to maintain the illusion of civility.
But Steve had already turned to the window again, the Mayors word’s playing like a record track over and over again in his mind. The ambassador was dead. Fighting was breaking out. Vienna. Graz. Berlin.
"I must say. You’re not at all what people expect you to be. Are you? I noticed you’re flying the Austrian flag, but not the German one.” He noted conversationally, false friendliness dripping from his tone. “A very interesting choice. Aren’t you worried it could lead someone to doubt your patriotism?”
This time around Tony had been right, with some help to keep his lungs open James illness had run its course; but he still tired easily and they might not be so lucky with the next illness or calamity. Someone developed strange symptoms Tony had no experience with, and what then?
Stefen sounded so wistful, his voice deepening with ache and Tony closed his eyes allowing the word to wash over him, picturing it all for a moment.
Tony and Péter managed to find Pepper in the crowded market after. They stopped at a vendor when the smell of roasted nuts proved too irresistible to ignore. Tony got the chestnuts for himself and a bag to share with Stefen, and Péter got a large bag of cinnamon dusted almonds to split with his siblings; but judging by how fast the hot little delights were disappearing down his gullet Tony thought it best to trot back and purchase another.
He sighed, gripping the pen tighter between his fingers and leaning closer to the parchment as he prepared to detail his suspicions to Farkas, only he found himself hesitating.
“They’ll be subdued.” Tony pointed out, without looking up from his work carefully beginning to assemble the materials of the explosive.
“Stefen -” Charlotte began to plead but Steve silenced her with a stare and spoke over her, his voice as unyielding as it had ever been. “Stay. Here. Is that understood?”
Steve made his way to the other side to where Sam waited, the trains steam pushing thick though the air between them.
“I’m afraid so.” Tony replied with a wan smile but the soldier did not return it. If anything, the confirmation just made his back go all the straighter and his tone all the more militant as he gave Tony the customary salute.
That was the last straw. Péter downed the rest of his drink, like he'd seen his uncle Bucky do countless times with his beer and stood up. Natacha watched him fretfully.
"Money can buy a man a lot of things." Stefen answered cryptically, but Tony didn’t need a straight answer from him. He already knew the truth, and it was… flooring to say the least.
“That’s drivel.” Natacha’s eyes narrowed in fury and Tony met her angry gaze with a firm expression of his own. “I’m sorry
AN: Feelings exploding every which way. I hope you didn't think that we forgot about the Baroness ;) Don't be too frustrated with Bucky. He means well, and is sure to come around.
Tony woke slowly and stared at the ceiling of the cabin. He breathed deeply in and out for a moment, listening to the crackle of the fire as the tears dried on his cheeks.
Welcome to the war years, AKA the last leg of this story. Coincidentally it also requires the most historical detail (which means research yaaaaay) so we apologize for how long it took us to get this out to you. Speaking of long, you might have noticed the title says November Part 1. That's right. Part II is done and will be posted following this when we get through editing it.
Ian stared curiously between them both as Natacha clutched her cup, staring at him with the guilelessness of a lamb but Steve knew that just meant she was trying to think up some way to avoid answering him.
“That’s a good idea Artur. Let’s get the bed ready,” Ian jumped on the suggestion Artur quickly following after him.
By the time they got upstairs and settled around a hot drink in the kitchen he was feeling steadier. Enough to think that it was a good thing that Maria had decided to make something to warm Tony after god knows how long he’d spent in that cellar.
Bucky was driving up front with Lt. Becker because his face was less recognizable than Steve’s. Up front Becker’s calm voice could be heard calling out a greeting. Steve's shoulders tensed further as a voice laced with suspicion barked to know what their business was. There was a rustle of papers as Becker handed over the documents Coulson had drawn up for them.
“James got you dirty. You hate being dirty and James hates being told what to do. You got into a fight and Péter probably sent you back inside, and that’s when James decided to redecorate.”
He made a couple of rounds through the room while the band played a few lively dance numbers, assuring all those who asked that the children would be performing before bedtime hours caught up with them. He then made sure they were all accounted for, starting with the youngest. When he’d worked his way up to Natacha he blanched, finding her cornered in a corner of the ball room with Frau Ursala who was rubbing a coil of her red hair between two of her fingers and eyeing it like someone would something under a microscope.
“What?” Charlotte asked peering at him in confusion. Bucky blinked at her, her face swimming before him a little. “You said something, only I didn’t quite hear.”
"Cameron must be running late this morning.  There was a lot of booze at the party." he pointed out with a smirk, but that of course just made Stefen look concerned.
Tony turned in his seat to follow the motion of a large crane as it carried a load from the dockside and lowered them onto a ship that was locked in harbor for repairs. They were using a model several years out of date he observed, indeed much of the machinery looked as if it hadn’t been updated since before the Great War. Hughard would never have stood for it.
No, when they went searching they would find his name on a Marxist list somewhere. Perhaps even that workers union meeting he'd attended in 35'. Point was, he’d seen what they did to people whose opinions didn’t match their own. It wouldn’t be long before they were storming his own house and frightening his new bride. Sometimes, measures just had to be taken.
It used to be his mother who found him in his thoughts, and when he could his father had before mama died. Because there was a before version of his father and an after. Sometimes, there was something frightening in the way father would hold himself, the way shadows crossed his face and made him different, someone Ian didn't recognize anymore. Peter used to complain that father had lost any interest in them when mama died.
"Are we all going to stay together?" Maria’s small voice was almost lost over the crackle of the fire. Steve’s eyes burn with the threat of tears. He did his best to blink them away. Swallowing thickly as he forced out the words, “If I can help it, we’ll never be parted again.”
Since he was not welcome in the parlor room with the aryan elite any more than Jan was, Bucky ambled down the hallway, drink in hand walking with the goal of...fags he deiced. Yes, a good smoke was in order, but damn he was out again. Stefen had some, or rather he had the spare square he always kept handy for Bucky when he inevitable ran through his own.
“And how can you tell that under the muck up there? You fret too much Heidi. That roofs been getting on as much as the general is. We’ll come back when the snows have gone and take a look.” He finally grunted, his voice retreating down the ladder and Tony sagged with relief.
“That’s why your Da joined the army so that he’d never have to beg again for what should have just been given, and he fights every day so that you don’t have to either.”
“Stefen we’re together to the end of the line. All I want in the interim is for you to finally be right again. I want you to stop walking around like the best of you died with Peg and to stop throwing away your chances with your children. And Stark… Stark brings out the best in you. And the worst.” Bucky admitted quietly, hands clenching and mouth twisting like the words had been yanked out of him.
Tony took a seat carefully. Though both men had been sat up here for most of the afternoon it didn’t look as if they’d touched much of the cake, and if the crumbs littering Bakhuizen’s plate were anything to go by he’d eaten the majority of what had been touched.
Then she turned and scuttled towards the baroness, affording only one glance back to the door of Rogers room. Her father’s room.
The Reich would arrest Tony and put him on trial and when they found him guilty they'd throw him in a prison camp, because that’s what they did to people who opposed them.
Bitterly, Charlotte thought that she might have forgiven him, here at the end of it all, she might have loved him still, sick or no, had he sought any comfort in her and committed himself to a marriage with her based on mutual affection. It would have been right. It would have been noble of him to do it. She would never have spoken a word of his affliction to anyone, and would have admired his strength and courage all the more for his silent suffering.
Some people wisely began to shift away from the ticket window, expressions tortured but warry of the police. Others stubbornly stood their ground.
He stared at the sketch in his hands, the thick and fine lines swimming in front of his face.  He’d meant to be sketching Johans, but Johans had red hair. Red. So why had he filled it in so dark? And his hands were all wrong. Johans had fine but square hands, no scars. The hands Steve had drawn were longer, nimble fingered and lined with fine intricate little scars. They were the hands of a mechanic. Not the son of an accountant.
Thankfully Göring’s wife showed up at that moment to announce dinner and lead them all to the dining hall to take their seats. Steve grabbed Tony by the elbow and hung back until he was sure Göring and Vonkov were well out of ear shot.
“What’s happened?” he demanded to know, only to be immediately shushed by more than one voice, the heads in the room barely even bothering to turn from the television box, where a news program was blaring loudly. Maria abandoned the spot she’d been sitting in beside Natacha and ran to Tony, who picked her up wordlessly and moved closer to the television.
Warmth spread from his chest and sank down into his belly at Tony's admission and Steve's mouth spread into a slow smile.
But those were words Tony knew would not fall on fertile ground. It was a soldier’s creed, to die for others and in that at least, Stefen was no different from his comrades.
Stark Industries had started from a collection of small shacks at the edge of the river Elbe, and risen to the biggest private shipyard the world had ever seen. Even the Brits, who had held the undisputed title for best shipmaker’s the world over, had taken a back seat to Stark ingenuity and design:
Steve was looking down, frowning at the cobblestone, his shoulders tense and heavy once more. Even though his gaze was directed away from Bucky the lost expression that passed over his face, open and pained, didn’t escape him. Bucky’s stomach twisted with something too close to guilt for his liking and he clenched his teeth.
"You should ask your uncle, or Tony. I've never been good at talking to woman. I still can't believe I managed to string two words together to talk to your mother." Da chuckled softly, working the needle deftly. Ian wrinkled his nose. He didn’t want to talk to those girls. James was much better at talking to people, girls specifically, and everyone adored Artur and Tacha. Ian just couldn’t seem to muster the courage, or the words. The words where the biggest problem.
Tony nodded, relief washing through him and rose from his seat, confident that the captain had received his message and the warning in it.
Natacha and James were slower to unthaw than the others, unwilling to forgive Tony for denying them news regarding their fathers' fate and not inclined to indulge in what to them seemed like the baseless hope the others were keen to rest on.
In the chair by the radio Tony sighed. Péter had lost count of how many times Tony had sighed in the last hour. He was restless, but he had nothing on Uncle Bucky, who was a certifiable mess, pacing back and forth, threatening to wear a hole in the carpet.
Last year Steve had given in to the pressure and Artur as well as his brothers had officially joined the program. He’d thought that a few hours after school would not change much, at least not quickly, but Artur had always been so keen to keep up with the older boys. He’d come home singing their anthems. While Steve was sure the songs were something they were all being taught the older children must have either guessed at his distaste for it or at the very least had a stronger sense of self-preservation than little Artur.
Stefen swallowed past the tightness in his throat and clenched his hands. He was the worst sort of hypocrite, but he needed to say this.
“Are you taking the others on another excursion?” Péter asked, running his hand over the smooth sides of the boat. There was an edge of envy in his tone that Tony quickly tried to dispel.
Across from him, Charlotte sipped her tea. The china clinked, scraping against the silver, grating on Steve's nerves. She’d been quieter than usual, and near silent since their soup had been delivered. In her defense, Steve wasn’t making himself good company and it was not easy carrying a conversation entirely by yourself.
“The Rogers live in the country, miles out in the middle of nowhere.” Ingrid shared with a vindictive gleam in her eyes, as if not living within the city proper was something dirty. Natacha supposed it was, but she quite enjoyed their quiet little villa.
“Damn the Reich. We can damn them together. We can do whatever mad thing you want, Tony.” Steve promised vehemently, pulling him closer. “Just so long as you promise to trust me when I tell you something is too dangerous. Please. Let me take care of you.”
In which we learn more about what Steve was up to in Vienna and discover that Steve is neither the shining picture of Aryan supremacy that the government likes to tote nor is he anything close to as put together as he appears. But we knew that.
“You can’t mean both.” She hissed, clenching her skirt in her fists tightly. “It’s disloyal. It’s lying. Are you asking me to lie?”
“Right.” Stefen nodded briskly, turning slightly toward the plump shopkeeper’s wife. “Mary, it was very good to see you again. Give my best to Friedrich.”
Péter wanted to scream that he’d never have done that, would never have betrayed his family like that. But they were going to leave and never come back. He’d known that, and he’d only been trying to say goodbye to his oldest friend. It was Harry who had betrayed Péter by showing the letter to Hammer, but he couldn’t say that.
“Nothing’s happened.” Steve assured him, but Ian did not look as if he was relieved. “You know I won’t let anything happen to you, don’t you?”
"Listen to me boys," Stefen spoke very quiet. "They had no choice. You understand? The Germans will not take no for an answer. It was either sign or face prison."
They continued to chat the night away. Tony making leisurely passes at Virginia, cheekily leaning into her side as they spoke, she and Bucky piggy backing stories about the end of the civil war and the things the family had gotten up to.
"The bell rang for supper so you're late, as usual." Bucky said, saying nothing more of his worries or about the task looming darkly on the horizon.
Steve turned from where he sat to glance toward the table, where he was keeping an eye on Bucky who was playing a game of cards with Kroger and Zimmerman, loud and happy in a way that Steve could only be envious of courtesy of the Pilots Salt Parodi had passed around to the weary men.
“How long have you known Henry Osborne?” The Agent asked Péter and Péter clenched his hands under the table.
Tony’s eyes were pulled like magnets to the paintings adorning the wall, his gaze landing in particular on the large portrait of a ship at sea riding the wind tossed waves.
Harry let out a nervous breath that he had been holding in for the duration of the conversation with his uncle Tony (not that he had actually called the man that).
"We need to go brother, if he is really there it would make these last 13 years worth it, worth all the pain and heartache because we would finally have our darling baby boy back, our Harry."
Nobody said anything, so Strange gave a short nod bye, opened one of his yellow portal things and stepped through before he left though he turned back to Peter and said “When you’re back home, swing by the sanctum we need to talk. Your father knows where it is.” He nodded his head in agreement, what the doctor wanted to talk about that they couldn’t just talk here and now.
Even when he couldn’t be there he protected Morgan, she sleeps with a spider-man plushie underneath spider-man quilts, with a picture of Peter by her bedside looking after her; scaring away all the monsters with a spider-man night-light shining away.
“Your aunt arrived; he went to catch her up before they came back into the room.” The man answered steadily, his attention already held elsewhere as he made to leave the room. He was never good with a lot of people in the room, Peter thinks it has more to do with the fact that he doesn’t really like any of them than any anxiety he may have like would be the case with Peter.
“Peter nooooooooo!” Tony screams, the whole battlefield eerily quiet as Thanos’ army fades into dust one by one.
Tony knew he also had to go shopping for everything a toddler might need, stuff like diapers and toys he didn’t know much else but that could wait until he actually had his nephew or at least tracked him down.
Harry made his way through the short tunnel connecting Privet drive to Wisteria walk and waiting for him on the other end was aforementioned godfather, obviously under countless glamour spells along with other charms to help make sure his presence wasn’t detected by anyone other than Harry himself. Harry couldn’t help the smile that creeped onto his face as soon as his godfather came into his sight; his steps became quicker and soon enough he fell into run and all but collapsed into Sirius’ arms. Sirius let out bark like laughter but nonetheless pulled his godson even closer and let out a relaxed sigh knowing that the boy he thought of his own was okay, that he was alive and well albeit a bit thinner than he would have liked.
Vernon took another bite of his dinner; the chicken was quite juicy, and traces of the gravy could be found dripping from his moustache. Through his small piggy eyes, he could see Petunia adding another helping of potatoes and piece of chicken onto their son Dudley’s plate. Good, the boy will grow up to be big and strong, Vernon thought to himself. Unlike that runt of a boy, speaking of.
Steve thinks it’s a little creepy. And he swears he even sees Clint with a broom waving it at the kid.
Also I realised a mistake that I made in the first chapter I write the Petunia was the one adopted (she was) but Lily was as well.
And if it wasn’t the middle of a battle, Peter would definitely be embarrassed by that but as it was an explosion goes off next to them before Peter even has the time to think about.
“Well as you know the former chief warlock made himself quite illegally my heir’s magical guardian and he did not protest his participation, it was also witnessed by a Lord of the wizengamot and the minister himself and they did not protest either, by stating that only of age wizards were allowed to compete and then allowing his participation they acknowledged him as of age”
"There is something of great importance I wish to collect and it just so happens that Stark is going to collect that same thing"
There was Captain America right in front of him, Peter that this wasn’t the first time they had met and even interreacted, but it was the first time he wasn’t being distracted by a million other things and could actually begin to comprehend what was happening.
It’s Peter! He’s alive! He just woke up.” The princess exclaimed in disbelief and she race back out of the room. Tony immediately goes to follow but Steve is stuck in disbelief.
Tony lets a breath and all but drags Peter into his arms, he clutches him close and has no intentions of letting him go ever again.
His smart, beautiful, vibrant, sister was gone, murdered by a crazed sociopath with a Napoleonian complex and daddy issues.
“Listen here, witchy witch don’t assume to know what I got going on . You know what they say it only makes an ass out of you and me but mostly you. Only you actually”
Vernon was monetarily distracted when Dudley turned on the TV, he sighed as the news about the abnormal activities played again, something about some group called the avengers and picked up the secondary remote and turned the channel.
“Dumbledore sent him on a last-minute mission, he couldn’t refuse as it would have sent off alarm bells and we need Dumbledore to remain ignorant if this is going to work.”
Thor blinked and looked at his brother, who was once upon a time his wife, the mother of his son, their son.
They turn as Peter comes within touching distance of them, and he knows, he doesn’t know how but he knows that this is the human form of the soul stone.
Harry was still coming to terms with the fact that the Norse Gods were seemingly real let alone the fact that he was apparently related to the king of the Gods through both his mother and father (and that in itself was a whole other can of worms) or that they themselves are FREAKING GODS. He also didn’t know how he should feel, he suffered all those years at the Dursley’s when he had family both mortal and immortal and not one of them cared enough to take him in, and his parents they were really alive so where are were they? Where are they now? Don’t they love him?
“I don’t really know, he was like a father to me I guess he just wanted the company to himself. You know he was the one who arranged for my kidnapping in Afghanistan and the one who conceived your grandparents to give your mum up”
With that said, Tony heard some talking going on in the background and heard Ross reply to someone saying “It could be arranged”
“Do we have tooo?” He whined, even as they made there way out of the shop to the law office just down the road.
Peter wasn’t all that upset by the bird themed avenger comment, he the soul stone didn’t lie to him about the arm growing back, if it wasn’t going to maybe he would be more upset, but he isn’t, so he cuts across whatever the man’s reply was going to be.
“How do you know my name” He asks, thinking belatedly that maybe she was thinking of the other Peter, the older one.
“Manager Cut-throat, we are here to formalise an emancipation and for my blood chosen son and heir to formally claim his heirships” Sirius got straight to the point and had finished speaking before bowing to the goblin behind the desk.
Peter almost reaches out to pull Mr Stark back into a hug before he manages to stop himself he definitely did make grabby hands to him though.
“Gross I knew that stuff was coming out of you” pipes up Sam, completely ignoring the tense atmosphere in the room. Peter smirks at Sam and decides to have a little fun by not correcting him. Suddenly Sam is afraid very very afraid.
“No my arm is dying, you need to get rid of it to stop the damage from spreading, it’s stopping me from healing fully”
A blinding smile appeared on his face. Before he could say anything, a piercing alarm sounded and the lights began to flash red, the alarm stopped before the Captain's voice exclaimed through the speakers.
"I was proven to be innocent of those crimes, was I not brother. I was not acting of my own accord you know this"
Tony nodded forgetting that the lawyer couldn’t see him, it made sense they’re people who would take advantage with a lawyer it mitigated the damage.
Tony has no time to celebrate the win as he races to catch Peter before he falls. He hits the ground limp just as Tony gets there.
Loki just sneered in response, before clearing his face back into a blank mask, he would need the emotional distance however small it maybe for what he was about say. It would bring up hurtful memories for the both of them, but perhaps if what he heard was true whilst spying on Stark it may just allow them to start healing.
There was some more banging and crashing, grabbing Harry from his highchair Lily began racing up the stairs sparing a moment to press a short kiss to her husband's lips and a whispered 'Be safe' against them. Reaching her son's nursery she heard a chilling, high-pitched cackle.
People are displaced, scared and didn’t know what was going on. The avengers need to be there for the public they argued.
Gamora didn’t know how to answer that, she guessed Quill could be considered powerful or at least before the Killed his father and as a result Quill lost his newfound powers but none of her other friends were all that powerful when compared to the immense unquantifiable power of the soul and the rest of the infinity stones.
It’s only ten minutes later but Peter’s sure it’s been hours when another explosion goes off and he’s thrown to the ground clutching at the huge gauntlet in his hands.
Ten minutes later and he was still reading, and just about ready to pull his hair out, the goblins loved making their contracts as convoluted as they could. They were petty and vindictive creatures like that and Harry was glad that he had more common sense than the majority of the wizarding world and actually treated the damn creatures with respect or he was sure that this contact would be a whole lot worse than it already was.
, as Mr Stark walked in with his aunt in tow who by the look on her face had heard her nephew’s last comment.
They were walking for hours before the find another figure and they knew just knew that this was Natasha Romanoff, the black widow.
“The avengers will always face the odds to beat the impossible, it was the whole reason we were formed in the first place” Natasha replied.
Peter felt a little weird when he woke up, I mean instinctively he knew he no longer had his left arm even without looking, it was like he was experiencing a lost his body didn’t quite know how to deal with. He was in pain, but not really at the same time, he guesses that’s what phantom pain feels like. When you’re not actually in any pain but your brain is misfiring confusing thinking that you are, so hurt even they injury that supposed to hurting isn’t there anymore
Lily could hear Voldemort coming up the stairs, she had dropped her wand in the passageway on her way up she would have to pass him to reach her wand.
Steve stands and moves to take the kid from Tony, he was the closest to Peter he shouldn’t have to do this Steve thinks  so he takes the burden on himself, not that it’s really one more of an honour.
If she could just get to the fireplace on the other side of the room they could get away before he'd realised they'd gone. But even as she thought it, she realised how hopeless it really was. Voldemort was already at the nursery door.
"It keeps the useless midguardians out fine but poses no obstacles to a god, especially one with my such talents and skills"
He pulled the stack of parchment that cut-throat had put in front of his godfather and got to reading, he was not stupid enough to sign something without reading it first no matter how much more respect and trust cut-throat and Harry had for each other which was a lot more than was normal between goblins and wizards.
Peter walked up to her but unlike with the stone she’s didn’t sense when he was near so he reached out and tapped her on the shoulder. She startles but turns to face him.
Bucky lets out a sigh from next to him and steps forwards. “You all need to back off, you’re scaring him, right now his body is in fight or flight mode if you don’t stop crowding him he will fight and probably win to”
Currently the perfectly normal Dursley family minus one abnormal nephew were sitting around the table enjoying their dinner that had been painstaking slaved over by the aforementioned absent nephew.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know. There was a letter your mother wrote thirteen years ago but I only just got it and once I read it I made plans to come and get you but then I found out that someone I had trusted and purposely kept it from me and that I got it thirteen years too late”
And suddenly he gets up, his energy renewed. Ready to give every last atom and cell of his body til he’s nothing when he catches Strange looking at him, holding up one finger.
A couple of minutes passed, and Dudley hadn’t returned with or without the freak but that was alright Vernon thought, probably just taunting the boy. When a few more minutes passed, and Dudley still hadn’t returned, Vernon began to stand up when he heard a dull thud coming through the front door, he turned to his wife with a small frown and they both made their way to the open door. Petunia let out a small gasp and clutched her hands to her mouth in shock, Vernon’s frown deepen and opened his mouth to ask what was wrong when Petunia seemingly fainted on the spot. He rushed to his downed wife and when he got closer he finally saw what had shocked his wife so before he could comprehend what he was seeing, he too appeared to just collapse.
Loki seeing that his oaf of a brother had lost patience and was gearing up for a lecture injected "and since he is also your son, I thought you might also like to come..."
That to Peter as a scientist makes sense, his healing factor isn’t being spilt so it can concentrate all its energy into one area.
Not even when he was forced to feel every single one of his cells tear apart only to stitch themselves up again as his healing factor kicked in over and over again.
He’s never fought so hard before in his life, probably because he never really had anything to fight for.
“Where’s the guy with a goatee” that had to be Mister Stark, right? That the other Peter was talking?  Or maybe it could be the Strange guy? Peter wondered as he knows that Mister Stark wouldn’t leave him if even if he had just scraped a knee. The reply to the question was lost as everyone began the notice that he was now awake, since everyone saw he was now up Peter opened his eyes blinking rapidly in order to adjust to the new light and sat up, clutching his still throbbing head, and looked around. His gaze landed on Steve Rogers, Captain America! Peter was most definitely
Tony looked down at aforementioned tablet and raised one eyebrow in confusion; What he was seeing couldn’t be right because if it was he got his sister’s letter 13 years a little to late. He looked up
'My darling Anthony, if you’re reading this letter it means that I'm no longer here, along with my husband, and now you're my only hope …'
“Actually, I was thinking of going away for a bit a lot has happen to me the last few months, I could easily arrange to stop by you.”
Gamora and the lady she was with Natasha she had found out when they were wondering the orange landscape trying to find a way out were currently in a staring with the red-faced man who was there when Thanos had first brought her here however long ago. Natasha had informed her that he was named red skull- rather apt Gamora had thought; apparently one of her new friends’ fellow warriors had quiet a bit of a history with the guardian. He had also once upon a time been in possession of the tesseract- the mind stone but he had been driven mad with power as he experimented with it until Natasha’s warrior friend had taken it and crashed into an ocean.
Peter doesn’t know what that means but he can guess so he asks another question. “Why I’m I here?” Again the figure stares as if judging him, seeing if he’s worth the answer.
Everything in his life had lost all meaning, none it mattered as the moment right now did and okay maybe he was fanboying just a
What was he the infamous Tony Stark, playboy, philanthropist, billionaire going to do with a baby? He'd never even had a stupid goldfish growing up, what was he going to do with a kid? He could just barely look after himself even then, if he is being honest with himself that was only because of Pepper micro managing his life. Little children especially babies had always made him uncomfortable; they were just so…fragile and dependent. Tony was scared that he would fuck up any child in his life.
Peter begins to wonder like he did when he first enter this world five years ago knowing that he could walk for years and nothing would change.
“My heir’s forced participation in the Triwizard tournament where it was stated only those of age would be able to compete, it was magically binding….”
“When you leave is entirely up to you Peter, I would suggest though before you do so that you find the others”
Harry thinks this is stupid and really doesn’t want to go through months of court appearances and check ups. Which is where his uncle Tony comes in, as an actual blood relative and not related to him through adoption and marriage like the Dursley’s he has a stronger claim and they are hoping that he would take Harry in over the holidays.
Thor woke with a sudden start, sensing a dark presence looming over him in his bedroom within Avengers Tower. He sat up immediately, summoning his trusty Mjolnir into his hand. Before he could do anything else however, the lights flickered on revealing a tall man with startling bright green eyes. Thor let out a quiet put upon sigh, weirdly or at least, weird for someone who wasn't a norse god from myths and legends, the sight of this male in his room made Thor relax.
Steve comes back to himself with Tony’s shout of “Peter!” That he’s pretty sure was heard all the way to Alaska and races towards the lab where cytogenetic chamber is knowing the way from both Peter’s and Bucky’s stay in there.
Peter thought mind reading was an affect of the mind stone not soul. The figure rises an eyebrow in judgement.
Tony said this in just about one breath, he could not take it if his nephew didn’t believe him. His baby sister’s little boy. Tony was devastated when out of nowhere his parents had decided to give her up.
Screaming fearfully (with the charm broken, maybe the neighbours would hear?) Lily turned clutching Harry tightly to her, she whispered "Harry, you are so loved, Mama loves you. Dada loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong"
“I didn’t choose the name Spider-Man for shits and giggles, my DNA is literally half of that of a spiders”
He was like a kid in a candy store which wasn’t that far of from the reality as they were actually in an ice cream parlour. And Sirius had to, just had to try all the exciting muggle flavours.
That had to be Bucky he had the mouth of a sailor when he actually bothered to speak, he glared mostly though which honestly scared Peter a little bit at first than he had gotten to know the man and found out he was a giant cuddly teddy bear underneath it all.
Harry is not too sure about this part of the plan, why would his parents let him believe they were dead for the last thirteen years?
By the time Steve has carried Peter to edge where the compound once stood and laid him down where there’s no longer any debris digging into the poor kid the footage had circulated all on going and active news outlets and by the end of the day it would have been watched by the entire world.
But does that mean he could only really regrow his limbs four times, until technically he has eight limbs?
Again some talking going on in the background most be more than the lawyer and his nephew there wherever they were most likely and Ross’ office.
The stairway and the downstairs were suddenly bathed in a bright green light, through the doorway she saw James' hand stretched out along the floor, his glasses lying just beyond the reach of his fingertips, the lens sporting a jagged crack. Oh god! Oh no! James! Lily's mind convulsed in fear and she started to shed silent tears. She looked down at Harry, her little beautiful baby boy as he let out a whimper, he was all she had now.
He thinks about his aunt May, Ned and Mj even Harry who he hadn’t spoken to in years even before Thanos and the snap that decimated half the universe.
But then he gives out a spluttering cough and his eyelids begin to close. Tony turns to Bruce (sorry Professor Hulk) “Get some medical attention here now!” he demands, Bruce just stares unsure if Tony knows the uselessness of that demand, it wouldn’t do the kid any help.
It almost sends him to the ground in a sensory overload, Peter can barely concentrate to figure out what is wrong and given that his Spidey sense has naturally been a dull ache ever since he came back from being dust whatever it is most be really really bad.
"Zigeuner. Gypsy boy." Stefen huffed after a long moment, something hateful in the sound that made Tony wince. "Do you know why I joined the army Tony?"
“You shouldn’t be alone.” He stated firmly. That he knew, down to the center off his being. Tony Stark should not be alone.
Whatever Stefen wanted to say must be important. All that intensity was still locked tight within his body, and every last drop of it felt like it was focused on Tony now.
Ian stepped back from the door, craning his head back to see that a balding man had opened the shutters of the upstairs window and stuck and was leaning out in an attempt to get a good look at him.
“Why?” Bucky asked, ever the straight shooter. When he had Coulson’s attention he gestured aggressively with his cigarette between himself and Stefen. “You want something from us or you wouldn’t go through all that trouble of spying on the captain. So what is it?”
He’d thought it looked like a Stark ship the first time he’d seen it. He’d been struck even then by the realness of the waves, the rawness in the artists brush strokes and the attention to details that could only be captured by someone who had walked those decks and seen the sun touch the water in just that way.
For Christ sake! Bucky stirred his food mulishly. He couldn't even enjoy a constipated Rogers apology anymore!
“Tacha do you remember when your Baka taught you to dance the Kolo?” he asked and beside her Péter’s face lit with delight. Natacha only nodded but there was no mistaking that she remembered or the wistful expression that passed through her eyes.
“What does he want?” Tony asked. He didn’t feel like mincing words. His stomach was grumbling horribly and he could tell by the light filtering in from above that breakfast was long over. Given that he’d missed supper as a part of his punishment and he was likely to go without
Her eyes were glassy and her stare removed. Her face was cut and her night gown was stained with blood from some injury he couldn't see. Next to the girl and the man a woman lay twitching in the throes of death, until she went still - like a discard doll. Without thought, Steve moved her crooked arm into a better position (more comfortable) and turned back to the child. The trio must have jumped from the apartments above. The man had tried to break her fall.
“They’re all men and women I’ve known Tony. They’re all Jews, and they’ve all been arrested and killed, the same way you will be if you don’t get your head on straight.”
Bucky mentally kicked himself for extending a truce between them (and against his better judgment too). It was only a thin relief that Stark was, for all intents and purposes, on their side. He was still a liar and deviant little bastard whose motives couldn’t be trusted. They were all just lucky Stark had decided to go against the Reich. It left Bucky cold thinking what Stark’s intellect could achieve for the wrong sorts of people. With a brain like that in the Reich, Stark could easily be the down fall of any resistance. And looking at Steve in the dimly lit alley, staring back at Bucky so solemnly, he couldn’t help but think that Stark was going to be their down fall no matter what side he was on.
That wasn’t kind, she thought with a wince, lowering her cup. He was under tremendous pressure, and with James missing it could only be that much harder to bear. She knew she had to be patient with him, supportive, but it would have been easier if he’d just allow himself to take some comfort from her. It was one thing to be stoic, it was another thing to snarl and snap at her as if she were the enemy. To blame her for doing what he’d asked her to do.
He did not love her. If that had not been clear before, it was clear now in the way he had handled their engagement. By rights she should have been furious and turned him down. Imagine, seeing a man for as long as she’d been seeing Stefen only for him to simply disappear, calls unreturned, and not so much as a letter for weeks. She’d had to learn through a mutual friend that his promotion had finally gone through, ceremony passed without so much as an invite, and that he’d already reported to his post.
He must realize, as Tony did that this was it. This was likely the last time they would ever see one another. Tony swallowed thickly unsure how to how to say goodbye.
It was silent as the children digested his treasonous words. Tony could hope of course that the little ones would listen to him out of hand, because he was a trusted elder and was to be listened to as a matter of course. They couldn’t completely grasp the notion that he might be bad, might be someone they shouldn’t trust.
Pepper, as it turned out, could be rather threatening when she was displeased. Tony did not feel it wise to cross her.
“The program said the Rogers Family Singers would be performing didn’t it? I am the head of the Rogers family.”
The one good thing about Captain Rogers living in the countryside was that the train wasn’t very crowded when Tony boarded that Sunday. There were just a few other people sitting down for coffee when Tony made his way to the dining cart. A pair of men in business suits at one table and an old woman with a small dog in her lap at another. She was speaking animatedly to the young fellow sitting opposite her, who might have been her grandson if one judge by the similar shape of their faces, but either way the poor boy didn’t appear to be very invested in the conversation.
“We’ll find them.” Daniel insisted with the kind of will born of desperation. “We can do more on the ground than your father can do. People may feel better talking to us than a man in uniform.”
“She’s alright, I see her da!” Ian said, squeezing himself in, elbows and knees going everywhere. James was right the little car was far too small. It didn’t stop him from practically throwing Tony in by his jacket, or Tony turning - banging his elbow into the driver's shoulder as he leaned over Ian to grab Steve by the shirt - to drag him inside until Steve was laying atop him, his head and shoulders wedged in between the driver’s seat and the woman in the passenger’s seat.
But Charlotte was looking at him with warm eyes, fondness that wasn’t cemented in any one reality but dreaming, seeing all the possibilities real or imagined.
She'd been waiting outside city hall for over an hour, and Charlotte was finding it hard not to fidget. Her poor wrinkled handkerchief bore the brunt of her anxiety, as she continued to twist it over and over again in her lap, watching the people outside her window. And still, she didn't see the boy in the cap approaching the car until he was rapping on the window, startling her out of her contemplation. Even with his cap pulled low Charlotte could see the impish delight at having freighted her in the boys twinkling almond eyes, a smug smirk stretched between his grubby cheeks. Charlotte frowned, prepared to shoo the boy away, when something about him made her look closer.
It had given him hope once. A reason to long for the future, when he could be free of the abbey for good. The world had seemed better then, ready and waiting with arms open.
Steve chuckled at the old memory. Phillips always said that, and he almost always didn't keep his word.  No mistaking, he left Steve to defend himself and fight for his right to be there same as anyone else, but it wasn’t coincidence that Steve’s unit was usually better stocked on food and bandages either.
Good, he thought. If Tony was angry at least it meant he was there. Steve would do just about anything to keep him present he was realizing as he heard himself say, “Come to the study. This concerns you.”
What boy wouldn’t want to go, in pursuit of the prestige and power the Reich promised to those who proved to be the bravest and strongest, those willing and capable of sacrificing the most? The Führer called men like that the jewels of the nation. Men like Péter's father.
James had forgotten for the time being that he lived to annoy and was helping Sara with her food, though truth be told he seemed far more interested in getting as much of the spread into his mouth as he could. Ian was chatting happily away with his father about some comrade of his in the HJ, and whatever Ian’s story was about had prompted an easy soft smile from Stefen before he looked up and caught Bucky’s eye, his whole face breaking out in a grin.
"I've been worse," Bucky muttered, catching his feet finally, enough to support his own weight.  Dr. Richter was there another moment later, batting Tony's hands aside to tear away Bucky's shirtsleeve and begin poking perfunctorily at the wound.
When they reached the vehicle Tony paused, waiting, thrusting a hand out to grab Clint and hold him back as well. Bucky had already opened the driver’s door and climbed halfway inside when he noticed Tony and Clint weren’t moving.
“Baka was there to watch us. He could have gone out on a date of his own; instead he found me under the bed and told me that if I never came out, I’d grow a hunchback. How was I going to grow up to be a
Pepper, wonderful girl that she was, immediately began fishing through her ring of keys for the right one.
Outside the gate, Bucky was standing near the open door of the truck staring up at where smoke was rising above the prison walls.
"Thank you for that, and tempted as I am to simply accept your adoration at face value, I care about you far too much to let you go on thinking there isn't a big difference between reading a book and years of experience." Tony smiled at him but it didn't reach his eyes. There was something very wistful about his expression. Sad, Péter thought with disquiet. Tony seemed very sad just then. His voice was subdued when he continued.
Time stretched before him like an open grave. That was all there was now. Just practical actions to save what was left of his family. No point in dwelling on the lost.
Rogers took a breath and the let it out, his anger changing into something sharper, under his control. “I'll be with them in a moment."
Tony’s mind raced. Dachau? The name tickled at his memory and it was a moment before even his powerful mind could dig it up out of the millions of bits of stored data. They’d built a prison in Dachau for all of Hitler’s enemies. When the church in Innsbruck had been raided they’d taken the men they’d arrested there, Tony remembered. The brothers at St. Péter’s had whispered about nothing else for weeks.
“Gypsies, here?” he scoffed openly, adjusting his grip on his stack of books. With a disdainful sniff that even Hammer could have been proud of he demanded to know if the Captain had been made aware of the situation, even though he already knew very well that he had.
She didn't move, light blue eyes staring down Hammer with the censure of a judge staring at a capital offender and after a long drawn out moment Hammer visibly swallowed his retort and began to shrink beneath the stare.
Tony closed his eyes and tried to block out the voice in his head, that kept taunting him that he’d never hear Stefen say those words, and it was a good thing because he’d never have forgiven Tony for letting harm come to his children. Tony came to a halt when Ian’s tracks suddenly turned, leading away from the road, poorly viable though it was, and off into the woods.  Gut clenching, he followed the tracks until the ground beneath his feet began to slope, the mountainside beginning a sharp decline. He could see from the marks in the snow where the sled had gone downhill and disappeared out of sight.
Getting to the gate unencumbered was surprisingly easy.  In the chaos following the explosion, nobody seemed to want to bother with Cardinal Rossi. They met up with the two doctors, Lucas Deurr and the brothers from Engelzell at the gate. All of them covered in the robes Tony had brought, waiting anxiously in front of the grim-faced gate Guard who was leveling a riffle threateningly at Leshnerr’s chest.
Rogers was not fooled by either the innocence in his expression or guilelessness in his tone, Tony could tell and he felt a thrill of satisfaction go through him. It was a small victory but it was his and he was pleased the captain knew it. As the man unclenched his teeth just long enough to bite out the reply, “You may call me Captain” the corner of Tony Stark's mouth lifted in a little grin.
“Yes... yes, Tacha’s right there’s still time.” Ian jumped on the feeble hope Natacha offered them and Tony kept silent.
“Bhut wat bout wat e’ ded!” Hammer wheezed through his bloody hands, and what was hopefully a broken nose with any luck. Tony didn’t stay to hear the lieutenant's answer.
Stefen’s eyes were determined but there was a plea in them, a desperate one for understanding – for permission – that made Tony want to pull his hair out.
He’d told them, some vicious little voice kept whispering in the back of his mind. It didn’t matter in that moment that Stefen had just committed a capital offense in front of his staff. Hearing that god damn thing rip in two had been the most satisfying sound he’d ever heard. Music to his ears.
“It’s been an honor, Captain.” Coulson admitted with quiet admiration, a bare faced sort of awe Tony had never before witnessed on the abbot’s stalwart right hand. They were birds of a feather, Tony thought with another pang of loss. Everything Filip did in his service for the Abwehr, Tony imagined was for King and Country. Even if it had been decades since the monarchy had fallen apart, as long as there was still an Austria, there would be men like Agent Filip Coulson protecting her interests.
Charlotte was not a stupid woman and it would only be a matter of time before she drew all the right conclusions if Steve couldn’t get his damn head on straight. Bucky had meant what he’d said that night.
One hand reached to cover Steve’s clenched fists. Steve stared at it, biting his tongue and holding incredibly still to allow Tony to continue his explanation. “If it was just about the weapons or the company, he could have taken me then and there. But he can’t just be satisfied with that, no he’s got to be the one to catch Enemy Number One. I’m the key to finding you and he knows that. He knows me too well I’m afraid.”
“Aw honey, its okay,” he tried to sooth as the little girls face continued to crumble. She let him wrap his arms around her though and even lowered her hands as she glared up at the ceiling in reprimand.
"A monk, but you’re so…” Bethany gaped, her eyes roving over him appreciatively before she realized what she was about, and a faint blush colored he cheeks.
In moments like this, he pulled up the memory from December. Tony had lost himself so often in the memory of dancing in Stefen’s arms, under moon and shadow, that it had all started to feel like a dream. Did it ache to remember? Like an open wound. But Tony did not know what he would have done without some sort of sign, that no matter how broken things were, Stefen still cherished him. Tony had only to close his eyes and remember that night to know the promise he wore hidden under his shirt still held true.
He didn't care. That had been his favorite book. The first one. The first friend to keep him company.
Artur looked up, waiting for Steve to counter. Steve held Tony's gaze a moment longer and then looked down into his son’s concerned blue eyes.
Most days Steve prayed for numbness, and most days those prayers went unanswered. There was no coping with the pain, just living through it. Long agonizing stretches of life that were only distinguishable from each other by the level of pain he was in. The worst moments came not when they pumped him full of chemicals that brought burning waves, melted his bones, and turned his brain into an angry swarm of hornets; but in the aftermath, when he was left to recuperate, his body feeling like it had plunged into ice and every nerve scraped raw until the press of air against his skin became an agony.
As the lesson moved smoothly into music Tony could not help but feel a glimmer of hope. He could not say what was to come; maybe he already suspected that a hangman’s rope lay in his future, but that was alright. There were worse things to be than dead.
"It's to house the new furnace. It takes a lot to heat a camp this size, and winters cold already bites us."  The warden replied. It was a simple enough answer, and readily believable what with the soft snow drifting around them. This was the coldest November they'd experienced in quite a while.
“Yes, at quite a young age too.” Obadiah confirmed before Tony could come up with any sort of reply of his own. “Fifteen wasn’t it Tony?”
Since studying animals was just about Artur’s most favorite thing in the world, second only to eating sugary confections, Tony wasn’t surprised a bit at the near feral gleam of anticipation that lit in his eyes, the boy practically shaking with excitement.
As the banging continued above Steve realized the disturbance had to be coming from the servant’s quarters. Steeling himself he pulled the gun from the drawer, rising with the intent to seek out the source of the disturbance and deal with it however necessary, visions of Schmidt's private soldiers dancing in his head.
was the one who could have been hurt. Steve’s spine snapped straight. His head came up and a moment later his hands were roaming over her body, checking for injuries.
Tony turned away from the desk and turned back to the rest of the room. The longer he surveyed it the more he noticed the troubling sterility of it. As beautiful as it was it was stale, too picturesque to be used for anything but pictures. Too clean, Tony thought, for children. There were no scuff marks to show a single child lived there, let alone seven of them.
“A fairy, Bakhuizen.” Kroger called from where he lay over on the sagging sofa, “Why don’t you make a wish?”
Maria couldn’t sleep unless he sang her to sleep. She who would clutch his hand and hum along to whatever tune he’d pulled from memory until she drifted off. Tony hoped it helped the others as well.
He found himself smiling softly at Péter who looked away once more, brow furrowed deeply in thought.  Steve nudged his shoulder with his own and the boy's mouth quirked at the corners in a self-conscious smile.
Artur blinked up at him, cheeks still flushed with anger but his brow had wrinkled in confusion and he wasn’t attempting to run anywhere (or at anyone) so that was good.
When he’d first arrived, they had shaved his head and shoved him into a line of other prisoners for a shower. If you could call it that. The rain room had been large and bare. The cement cold under his feet.
Steve took up position beside him, leaving just enough space to deny familiarity and reached inside his breast pocket for the cigarettes they both knew he wouldn't find. Scott watched him fumble for a moment, breath pluming out in white streams in the cold winter air. Steve gritted his teeth so hard he thought they might crack.
“Yes. I’m hoping for a girl this time. Between Frank and Ret I think I could use another woman around.” Turning, Susann’s eyes landed on the children, eyes sticking first on Péter and then Natacha. He thought he saw what might have been tears in the corner of her eye but with a toss of her head and a wide smile if ever they had been there, they were gone.
Tony had gotten hurt. It made something in Natacha's stomach twist unpleasantly every time she looked at those bruises on his face and neck, and it just made that anger inside her burn hotter.
One might think that having attained such wealth Stefen would covet luxuries for himself, but instead he thought of others. A man of few words and yet his actions spoke clearly; love expressed in full bellies and soft flesh.
Tony yanked off the safety clip and pulled the pin, carried by furious adrenaline and blind panic, not thinking about getting shot or falling from the truck as he rose up - just far enough to take aim, and throwing the damn thing before it could explode in his hand.
“Of Captain Rogers pride of the Gebirgstruppe? Yes. But Stefen Rogers?” Stef’s gaze snapped back to him all the intensity from before returned to crackle in the air, all of his focus on Tony. Just how Tony craved it.
“No speaking!” A guard shouted by the door. The water suddenly cut out and the prisoners shuffled like pale wet mice to the sides, parting for the two guards who charged in. One snagged Steve by the back of his neck and threw him off balance. The other snatched the man behind him, the one who had warned them to be quiet. Steve went without protest as the Krippo dragged, scraping his shins against the floor. Without warning his face was shoved into the ground, grime and dirt grating against his sensitive skin as the hand gripping his skull smeared it back and forth. The guards yelled above him, and then there was white hot pain exploding over his back, knocking the air from his lungs.
“You take a breath, find your note and it’s just yodel-lay-ee-oo. See? There’s even a song I know. We’ll sing it together. We’ll be so loud no one will even remember the thunder.”
“I should have been a painter. I’d have made a fortune selling your portraits.” Tony mumbled to himself with a small smile. He leaned down to press a kiss against the curve of Stefen’s shoulder, but when he turned to slip quietly from the bed he was startled by the hand that suddenly gripped his.
ABösendorfers. Cherry wood that was nearly black it was so dark. He'd never seen one up close, constrained to watching the gleaming black wood from afar in festival halls and dimly lit concert arenas (Tony had been in attendance for charity work of course, though such expensive charities had only received Nik’s stamp of approval few and far between). He slid his hands over the heavy keys surprised when they came away clean. What he wouldn't give to play a Grand Bösendorfers: clean lines, the tone alone was superior to anything Tony had ever laid his hands on.
“You’re green. Are you about to be sick?” James exclaimed loudly, leaning right into Bucky's face. “If you are, do it on Ian, I don’t want -” Bucky cut him off, shoving him away and James sat back in his seat with a plop and stuck his lip out in a pout.
“Was that clear enough?” Tony murmured into the tense silence with a breathless laugh and Steve let out a huff that might have also been something of a giggle, maybe a cry, he wasn’t confident of what his body was doing anymore. His nerves felt like he’d been hit by a lightning bolt.
“I’m a survivor. I’m whatever I need to be. Maybe I’m just smoke...” She sounded sadly resigned to that, and Tony knew that a part of her was hoping he’d convince her it wasn’t true, but she didn’t believe that he could.
“Tony and I were born the same year. Our mothers were best friends and had planned to baptize us together, but Tony’s father forbade it. Still, they wanted us to know one another, so we would celebrate our birthdays together in December.” Grig explained, his voice soft. That gentleness only further angered Tony, because baptisms and birthdays weren’t the half of it.
The housekeeper released a shaky breath of relief and slumped back against the bed when Fischer deposited the unused syringe back into his case full of supplies.
She said nothing more, turning with a swish of her pale skirts to follow after her siblings and leave Tony to his own thoughts.
“He can speak for himself Stefen! You heard him.” The man practically growled as he turned back on Tony. “So go on Pretty Boy, let’s hear it.”
A pretty flush of exertion had bloomed on Natacha’s cheeks by the time the dance had ended, and it was strange to see her almost shy as some of the nearby guests stopped to congratulate her on her fine dancing. She met his eyes just long enough for him to note the sparkle in them before she shifted them almost guiltily away and Tony took her hand in his and pressed a kiss to the back of her palm.
“I need help getting it into the right hands. Sam's too easily disposed of. A man followed us to the train and I don't think Sam would have made it to the border if I’d tried to give it to him. They’d kill him no questions asked, no one would notice him disappearing.”
“Magda!” Franz- her brother he remembered- snarled, reaching out for the weapon. She backed away, keeping it out of reach and Franz faltered, his expression shifting from shock to fury. He was shorter than Magda, his dark hair trimmed in the stylish manner kept by most students. But they had similar jaw lines and the same eyes. Eyes that were widening in recognition as they shifted back to Steve, taking him in.
In the Rogers bleak little villa there was no peace. Silence, yes. God was there ever silence. Open and thick like a heavy fog: an effect like being drunk without any of the benefit.
There was a pregnant pause, in which Natacha sat silently seething, until beside her Péter took a slow breath and hesitantly spoke.
Willamina scoffed as the radio host paused for breath, and then launched into a report on the mobilization effort of the army and the reputably countless demonstrations of support popping up all over the country as they prepared themselves for the inevitable pushback of Hitler’s plans to invade the borderlands.
He’d promised Bucky that if anything happened to him he’d make sure his sister and her family got out of Poland before it was too late.  He’d written to them, only to discover too late that Rochel and the girls had disappeared. The only upside was that it appeared to have been on her own steam, but it was cold comfort to think of Rochel alone on the road with two girls and no help. She’d never risk crossing through German occupied land to get to Steve and any method of contact Bucky had given her to reach him would go unanswered because Bucky was gone.
"You trust her?" He barked at Vis, nodding towards the girl, but rather than wait for Vis to answer she answered for herself, chin jutted outward, "I'm the reason you were able to get these at all.”
But just the thought of moving seemed to awaken his body to just how much pain he was in, because it came rushing up like a wave all at once, no morphine left in his system to blunt it. Steve keened low in his chest, curling his legs into his stomach as he rode it out, fighting not to pass out. His fingers were numb. He flexed them to try and get some feeling back, only to realize that his wrists were still bound behind his back. He was on his stomach, suspended ever so slightly off the ground by his hands and feet, secured to something solid above him. The bonds were tight. Whoever had tied them was no fool and hadn’t left him any room to move his wrist or ankles.
“You’ll be with him.” Tony muttered under his breath, the music spilling out now in oily black notes.
Entering Salzburg proper what energy the children had exhausted on the long trip was amplified and returned to them with gusto by the sight of the bustling crowds and white cream buildings (even Natacha was practically humming with excitement).
"Maria, sweetheart, what did you think rabbit stew was made out of?" Bakhuizen pleaded at their backs, but the little girl just glared hatefully and turned her pretty little nose up. Tony bit back a chuckle.
Bucky might have felt something more than the vague urge to be sick witnessing Stefen teaching his children Romany words for the first time he could recall, but considering every word spoken made his head pound, resisting the urge to hurl was the best he could do. There was no point in telling them to be quiet either, Christmas morning had the children all flush faced and rambunctious, loudly chattering over the clink and clank of dishware as they ate.
More worrying, there was nothing to suggest that Steve lived there either… as if he had counted himself among the dead.
“I’ve been died on Stefen, remember? My parents left me alone in the middle of a war. I hated my father for sending me to the monastery.”
She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and giggled. Péter fought a grin. Natacha was like father. She used to laugh more.
Steve reached into his desk and slid his fingers around his gun, his senses screaming with a sense of impending danger. For a moment he thought wildly about getting to the children, making sure they were safe, but he was torn between that and the impulse to seek out the threat and neutralize it.
"I don't plan on dying, Tony. But to act like it's not a possibility isn't a luxury I can afford." Steve licked his suddenly dry lips, willing himself to go on. His heart was still beating rabbit like within his chest with anxiousness but he would not shy from this, from the very thing he wanted. He wanted it too badly. "I’ve plans to purchase a home in Switzerland and to send the family there when it’s secure to travel. Whatever happens…  Tony there is a place for you here, if you want it."
Even if Steve thought the other boy was a bad influence, he knew how much their friendship meant to Péter. He trusted Péter to know his own mind.  But more importantly he realized, even if Péter hadn’t yet, that the friendship between the two boys had a time limit, and the clock was only ticking downward.
Tony fell on his backside, too stunned to do much else but blink back up at the captain. Though he must have shouted because a moment later Herr Bakhuizen had appeared in the door.
Bitterly he wondered if today his pulo would manage to scrub away the evidence of his Roma blood and his irritable heart. Surely there wasn't enough lye soap in the world.
“Yes, as well as the Young Maidens,” She answered with a slow nod, as if they were going over notes for a speech and Tony wasn’t seconds from taking a torch to the house.
“Well done, Ian. Do you want to learn to float now?” Stefen murmured lowly, one arm rested around Ian's stomach holding him to his chest. “When you're tired it's a good way to rest without having to leave the water.”
He was clever, Steve would give him that. He’d not expected the man the Abbott sent him to be so smart. Even for a Stark the man's mind was truly something extraordinary, flinging equations and algorithms about like an artist slung paint, easy as his next breath. And as more letters had come Steve could not deny that the man was insightful and did well with the children.
It was too easy to think of slapping that sneering grin off Emil’s face. She thought of his hand squeezing her shoulder, and the shock that would be on his face if she turned and jabbed his belly. He’d never call her little girl again. She’d make him pay. She’d make them all pay.
“Come on, come on, I know you're all clever little foxes and the material is boring you to tears. It’s boring
“My father says the Führer is naive to think so many countries will just hand over their land. He says there will be war,” Péter warned but Harry only scoffed.
Pacing the floor Bucky halted in front of the writing desk in the corner and just before Steve's patience was about to snap he finally said, "She said Jonny came for tea the other day and that Frank misses playing with kids his own age. Susann wants to send him up the river."
A chorus of ‘yes fathers’ rose up in reply and Maria’s lip quivered as she grasped little Sara’s hand, the toddler abandoning parade rest in favor of clutching the hem of her dress tightly in her tiny palms as her face crumbled. Artur had the same miserable pout on his face he’d worn at dinner. Péter looked as if he might say something but couldn’t figure out where to start. While Natacha and Ian just looked resigned, James was harder to read. Tony doubted the stony expression he was aiming at the ground meant anything good.
When they had four ramshackle tents set up and sleeping rolls at the ready James just couldn’t seem to take it anymore and demanded to know when they could race their boats.
“Nothing gentle about me darlin,” Bucky replied, sparing her a brief flash of a smirk because he knew she was trying to distract herself from the pain. He made sure to proceed even more carefully. “I just hate seeing a lady suffering. That’s all.”
Her arrangement with Stefen was primarily one of convenience. They were of a similar age, a certain familiarity, and most importantly of like goals. She was a woman of progress and strong convictions who wanted to do more with her life than churn babies into the world, and he was a man of action whose moral compass pointed true north. He was not easily manipulated, brow beaten or puzzled out, which in itself could keep a woman on her toes.
“Wasn’t Poland then,” Bucky muttered, tightening the strings on the violin and saying nothing more. Stark was too nosey. “And Baka is what we used to call your grandmother James. You were very little when she came to live here. You might not remember her but she was a special lady. She loved to dance, didn’t she Tacha? Taught Péter and Tacha the Kolo, the Krakowiak, and all sorts of things.”
“Was there anything else, Captain?” Stark’s voice brought him back and Steve grit his teeth before turning to face the man again.
"Evening Officer! It's a beautiful night isn't it?" He called out cheerfully, pointing towards the sky. "Just look at those stars. You can't see stars like that anywhere else in the world can you? You ever wonder what's up there? My father says we'll never know but that's what I get for asking him, he -"
The drab wardrobe Tony had brought from the abbey didn’t suit him and neither did the scholarly dregs he’d managed to create from the sensible bolts Virginia had acquired for him. Steve had instructed the shop girl to pick things someone like Thorson would like. Someone who took over a room as soon as they walked into it. A good choice he’d thought again with pride as he let his gaze wander over Tony in the coat and tails he’d chosen for the dinner party. The monk had forgone gloves, going with a more casual look but it did little to detract from the overall effect.
And Bucky saw Rochal, his nieces, Natacha, her sisters, and he thought with a stab of agony, they were all just girls.
Right. Tony had only met General Schmidt the once but the man had left him with a cold feeling. He did not need to imagine what would happen if the twins were discovered here and Steve had his own children to think about.
“Alright, alright. Artur partner with James, Natacha with Ian. Péter why don’t you and I-” Steve began but Péter interjected.
They ate in tense silence. Péter coughing every so often and looking up to catch Steve’s eye. Steve ignored him, any trace of his mild mood slipping away with each minute.
“This is nice” Peter whispers and immediately proceeds to ruin the moment by saying “I guess we’re there now”
So he fights even harder until he can’t fight anymore. He’s just a about to give up, sure that there’s nothing left in him to give anymore when he and Peter next catch eyes.
There is a brief pause in the chaos of battle where Peter and Tony just stare at each other, before Peter is rumbling away like nothing has changed, like it hasn’t been five years since they last seen each. Like he hadn’t died in Tony’s arms pleading with Tony, to save him.
And then Steve comes saying that “there’s  footage of the battle…. Everyone saw… Spider-Man, everyone knows it’s Peter…. They know he’s…”
'I have a son…I wasn't ever going to tell you… I didn’t want father to know…his name is Haraldr James Potter… But we just call him Harry’
Obadiah Stane was not a very considerate and compassionate man, evidence by the fact of him keeping and hiding a letter he was sure Tony would very much want to see. Which presented Obadiah with a problem this letter threw a spanner in his work and would derail his plans for Tony and the company and thus unfortunately it could never make it’s way into Tony’s hands.
Lily turned back towards the door where Voldemort watching her, they were safe! Harry was safe, she was so sure they were safe!  Lily stepped in front of her son's crib protecting him, shielding him.
Only to see that he was back in that place, as far as he could see (which was pretty far with his enhanced sight) there was orange nothing but orange and let’s not forget the dust.
At this point the other avengers really really wanted to leave the room but both Tony and Peter were standing in front of the door.
“Son check for the boy, if he isn’t outside or finished with the chores too bad he will be locked out. His own fault really”
It’s at that moment that he catches Doctor Strange’s and Mr Starks exchange out of the corner of his eye.
"If it is such a problem you ought to talk to Stark about his security." Loki snarled, ignoring his brother's last comment. Stark did not deserve the truth for what he had done or more appropriately what he hadn't.
He at last came to the end of the parchments and signed his name at the bottom next to Sirius’ signature. He was finally free.
"Brother" He said, setting down Mjolnir. "You startled me." The god of mischief lips twisted up in a slight sly smirk. He was pleased with himself, as that was his goal.
The guard outside posted by the headmaster to keep an eye on Harry (that he wasn’t even supposed to know about) would have been an entirely different story and his jailbreak cut short if he hadn’t taken the liberty of memorising the guard schedule and he knew that at this particular point in time that Mundungus Fletcher was on duty and that he had already left to go see a guy about some stolen cauldrons. This was of course a lie orchestrated by Harry and his godfather.
He left them, he was gone, so he couldn’t protect them. Peter blatantly ignores the chance that they could have been dusted too. He doesn’t want to think about them alone wondering the strange orange world like he was.
“So no you haven’t, you might know, you might acknowledge but you don’t feel. I don’t feel it now either.”
“Kid, it’s time to go” There’s a hand on his shoulder and for a second Peter thinks… he lets himself believe that it might be Mr Stark. But then he looks up and see’s the other Peter, the older one who said he was from Missouri.
So he holds on tighter as even more explosions go on and he feels the weight of someone throwing themselves over him and pulling him out of the way as a missile explodes just where he was.
“He seems eccentric to be sure.” She continued “He seemed more than ready to teach the children the curriculum you selected for them, and even more important he did not question it. Besides, I think the children like him.”
“Since you seem too hung up on picking fights, Sara and I can take care of the supplies. In fact she can build the damn puppets herself!”
But his mind was sinking again, into the black ocean, under waves of exhaustion. Steve clung to Tony as best he could but the hand reaching up from the depths was stronger.
Tony would never understand all of his mother’s choices, but in the eyes of her son, Maria Carboni’s saving grace had been a willingness to love and be brave even standing in the shadow of her worst mistakes. Hughard had run from his shadow until the day he died. The choice was before them all now, whether to run or to face this mess of their own making. Italy had a problem of conscience on her hands, and Tony could only be grateful that for the moment, her people had determined to listen to their better angels.
“Captain Rogers!” a man behind the desk immediately called for Steve’s attention. Herr Shultz, according to his shiny brass name tag, saluted smartly as Steve drew closer and Steve returned the perfunctory gesture with his jaw clenched tight.
"That's what they told me." Tony replied simply, his gut tightening with anxiety. He'd wondered why they'd waited so long to speak with him. Why he hadn't been carted away in restraints right there alongside Stefen. He doubted that Hammer hadn't run telling tales about him that could curdle milk. The man had called him a fairy right in front of two policemen for god's sake, and yet the Abwehr had kept him for last. Hadn't even questioned why the tutor wasn't more concerned about the status of his employment now that the master of the house was gone.
She nodded. Slowly withdrawing her hand from his and rubbing it against her chest. He hoped it was to warm it from the chill of exposure, but suspected it had more to do with his grip.
The woman came once a day with bread and water. She changed his blanket and tidied the pen each day before she left, faithfully scraping up Patroche’s shit and even Steve’s waste.
He hastily took a step back, averting his eyes as Stefen turned to look back at the camp where Bakhuizen was putting his violin away, making no secret of his focus on them.
Péter gaped at him, eyes searching his wonderingly and Tony shrugged in response, feeling suddenly uncomfortable with the naked emotion in the boy’s eyes.  He’d been so caught up in Péter’s dilemma that he’d almost forgotten he was holding Sara’s hand, who was struggling to keep up with their longer strides.
The station in Geneva was twice as crowded as the first time Péter had come through. Not only was it full of students making their way home for fall break, he couldn’t help but notice the number of refugees clogging up the receiving lines and ticket stations. His wandering eye caught those of a little girl clasping tightly to her mother’s hand. The girl and her mother were both dressed in too many layers for the weather. There was plenty of cold this time of year coming down from the mountains, but it seemed to him as if the little girl and her exhausted looking parents had tried to wear on their backs whatever hadn’t fit in the cases they carried.
Steve drew a quick breath and crumpled the letter in his fist. He couldn’t find Bucky’s sister Rochel or her two girls. Didn’t even know where to start. Just like he couldn’t find Bucky or Tony... Péter.
“And housekeepers never sample the masters liquor. Pepper you naughty girl.” Stark teased, reaching for the bottle, or maybe Virgina herself it was hard to tell. Either way Virginia swatted away his groping hand and set the bottle on the desk before sitting primly down and pouring herself a glass.
The door had crashed against the wall so hard the baroness had cried out in shock and the little girls had screamed. Charlotte had quickly rallied, pulling herself together enough to herd the children out of their father’s path as he tore frantically around the room talking to himself.
Bucky snapped his mouth closed and graced him with a blank look. The corner of his lip twitching in what Steve was sure wanted to be a snarl and irritation settled in Steve's stomach. He was not an invalid who needed to be led to water. If he damn well wanted to swim he’d swim and not a moment before!
Cameron’s face fell, his head drooping with shame. It hurt to see the anguish on his face, almost as much as the knowledge of what had put it there. The villa was home to Péter, but it wasn’t just his home. Joshua had helped his father nail every board and lay every brick. Frau Klein had helped his mother run the house and watched over her while she was pregnant with Péter, Daniel toddling around her feet and Cameron strapped to her back. It had never mattered to Péter the way it mattered to Harry that they sometimes employed their neighbors.
!” Bucky barked, the sound harsh in the quiet of the room and Péter jumped. He didn’t feel bad for it though. It hurt him down to his soul sometimes watching the children struggle, but the kid was dead wrong and way out of line.
“What’s wrong?” He hissed as quietly as he could, scrambling from his bed. Was it the Germans? Could they have tracked their broadcast that quickly? Could they track it at all? Or maybe one of the staff had overheard. Maybe they’d been reported and the police were here to –
On the outside, Ludl Chaple looked peaceful and undisturbed. A small grey stoned church mostly empty on a working day, save for the occasional coming and going of an automobile. bringing someone on church business. One such automobile brought a man who went by the name Visser, or simply Vis among the locals. With him that day was a young woman carrying a large covered basket. Her jacket was that of a working woman, plain and modest, but there was nothing modest about the bright red of her painted lips.
But he didn't crumble. The pain was there and then it was gone as he retreated further behind his walls, all expression bleeding from his face.
"For a moment, I got lost in a dream," Stefen began, fingers continuing their slow rubbing of the back of Tony's neck, the blue of his eyes distant for a moment as he chased a memory.  "I thought with the Führer dead that things might be different. Maybe then I'd have done enough… we could have chance at a new start, you me, and the children. The house in Switzerland, a quiet life... Péter could keep going to school."
“-boats, please.” Ian insisted a touch louder and a lot more stubborn and Tony gave up while he was ahead.
“We can’t give into the fear. This storm will drown us if we do.” Tony pleaded lowly. His eyes were what Steve was drowning in. He felt like that sailor from that Italian opera he’d taken Peggy to. Like he’d lost his grip and slipped into a turbulent sea, only to spot the light that would lead him to safety as the waves crashed above his head.
. A traditional adornment of gold coins, worn by married women around the neck or the waist. To sleep with a man without one is unclean. If the strand breaks the union is considered void and the woman unclean until it is repaired or replaced.
“I’m sorry.” She said, as if that was good enough. As if that would save her brother from a bullet if he got caught sneaking around the border in an active conflict zone.
Tony didn’t say how Professor Einstein had been the first and only person ever to call Tony a genius, as if it were obvious and his potential a matter of course, truancy and deviant behavior be damned. He’d confessed to Tony once that he’d been a terrible student himself, once upon a time.
He’d pass it off as the captain simply not wishing to ruin his super but he’d shared enough meals with the man now to know that he hardly ate then either. There were many things that could take away a man’s appetite, Tony knew, but he couldn’t help but flash back to that night in the captain’s room- see the wild white of his eyes and his shaking limbs again.
Tony turned away, started up towards the camp site. His limbs were tired from lifting little ones up and out of the water, from the hike and general wear and tear of keeping up with seven highly intelligent not to mention headstrong children.
“Tony!” he gasped Tony’s name in warning, but Tony just opened his throat, taking him in as deep as he could and Stefen came with an almost violent sounding curse. He fell back against the door, shaking knees nearly giving out as Tony released his cock – the wet sound echoing within the small workshop.
"Did your Da tell you that I've been working with Janneke Van Dyne?" Bucky announced to the table at large, drawing all eyes to him and Steve sagged in relief.
He ran his fingers over the beads, fascinated by their deep red hue and the nearly maroon veins that ran through them like bloody veins. The coins were obviously very old with foreign writing on them, but they had been recently polished so that they glimmered. There was something familiar about them Tony thought the longer he stared. It took a moment more to sort through his memories to figure out just where and when he’d seen them before. In a little bag, locked up in the chest in Stefen’s study. The captain must have had them strung at great cost he realized with an uncomfortable twist in his stomach.
“Do not test my patience.” Schmidt snapped abruptly, his eyes flinty hard. He sat the glass done with a clink. “You may have heard. General striker has been moved from his impressive work with the HJ to a much more president position. We need men with General Strikers sort of passion.”
Steve swallowed thickly, air catching and sticking in his throat when he attempted speech; but that was good because he couldn’t think of a single thing to say. Words were not enough. Except… maybe… a name, his name, floating up like a reflection in a pool of water. That could be enough.
Stefen let out a little gasp of dismay as Tony released his cock and went to his knees. The shock barely had time to register on his face before Tony was working his trousers down with impatient tugs.
Bones creaking with age and weariness Tony rose from his chair, Stefen’s words to him in the dream echoing in his skull, and reached for the radio sitting at top the shelf carved next to the bed. He heard a rustle as one of the children rolled over in the bed but he didn’t take his eyes off the bulky machine he held between his hands.
The cook lowered her head again and returned to their work. If she let any tears spill, they were lost to the dough and the rocking motions of her hands at work.
"Tony," the captain walked toward him, his tone beseeching but Tony turned and glared at him in warning.
“What about the children?” Stefen voiced similar worry, and Tony cast a glance backward to confirm that they were the four of them listening intently, their faces pale and solemn. “We were supposed to report to Baker Street in London and meet up with Holmes before the mission. I was promised my children would be taken care of!”
She nodded mutely, keeping her cheek pressed to his shirt, her face hidden from his view. She couldn’t face him just yet. She only hoped her brothers never heard about this.
His mouth twitched toward a smile as her eyes widened and in a far more confident voice than before she answered, “Je suis bien… Monsieur Majeur. Et vous, comment vous-allez?”
Curious, she went and stood beside him, greeting him with a practiced smile she knew hid any hint of her true feelings.
“You did it for me.” Steve reminded them both, his hands already settling on Tony’s hips once more as he slid further down the bed until Tony’s thighs bracketed him on either side, Tony’s knees tucked under his arms.  Tony fell forward, until he could rest his hands upon the headboard, gripping it hard as he struggled for patience. Steve’s mouth was tantalizingly close to his throbbing cock, his warm breath coasting over his most sensitive skin sending shudders up and down his body.
Steve had stared at him, dazed, until Bucky had lowered the instrument and sighed. Steve didn’t remember much after that. Bucky must have put him back to bed.
“Oh for heavens sake, James are you honestly refusing to put on pants?” Tony sighed, already knowing the answer and sure enough James’ tear stained face scrunched up and he took a great gIant breath before wailing loud enough to be heard in China.
He didn’t want them to know. Sometimes he didn’t even want to know what he was thinking. It got very bad inside his head.
“And others, particularly those from the south, sadly are muddled and mixed with any number of unfortunate bloodlines, even negros.” She lowered her voice as if she were sharing with him some tantalizing bit of gossip, and Tony fought the urge to knock her out of his way as he got up from the bench and took his bows as the audience politely clapped.
“Mio dio, God has truly forsaken me. The way you look right now.” Tony cursed under his breath and Steve huffed a laugh. Tony wanted to ruin him. He was surely going to hell.
And slowly Ian began to float, his body relaxing into his fathers with trust as Stefen captained his drifting.
“Captain?” Steve blinked and released Maria’s wrist instead of helping her like he'd intended, his hand falling with a thud onto the table unsure of what to do. He felt suddenly like a brute, too large for the table. Shame pooled in his gut and flooded his face.
Tony clenched his hands, struck by the realization that he wasn’t sure. Maybe Obadiah would have thought to write him if his grandmother had passed. Probably not. It wasn’t as if they’d kept in contact. The Carbonis had been held at a distance before Tony was even born. The reality was that Nonna and Nonno could very well have died and Tony would have no idea. But the thought was too painful to bear so Tony shoved it away, buried it so far down it would have no chance of rising again to haunt him.
Okay then it was James. Tony really did not want to be dealing with this right now or to have to admit that it had happened because Tony hadn’t been keeping as close an eye on them as he should have been (considering they should technically have been in the schoolroom right now going over their History).
He would do what he had to in order to get the job done and when this was over he was leaving the army, and going home to his family. Whatever had gotten so bent inside him could be faced, so long as he was with them. Soldiers come home with irritable hearts, Bucky’s mother used to say. Well irritable hearts be damned.
“That wasn’t an invitation to negotiate Mr. Stark, but I’m listening.” Holmes replied, folding his hands on his lap and waiting.
“Report?” he asked, as if the three of them weren’t whispering in the dark with only the occasional flash of lightning to illuminate them, and he weren’t clutching to Tony’s sleeve like a lifeline. If Bucky thought anything about that was strange he didn’t say so, though he stared long and hard at Stefen in a silent battle of wills, communicating in that wordless language all their own that two people built over a lifetime together.
This is the KNIGHT at the INN. You asked previously for a detailed report on the current health of Germany. I have acquired assistance, who will henceforth be known as PAGE. It is our solemn duty now to tell you what goes on now in the body known as Germany.
Willamina and Frou Hogan were fawning over the little ones in the kitchen, wiping sweaty brows and tear stained faces, griping about heat exhaustion and Herr Stark’s irresponsibility; because neither Péter nor Natacha had dared breathed a word about what had really happened.
Lt. Becker shot him a look as he plopped down to remove his boots, wincing as he undid the laces. Underneath his trousers the skin was red and puffy, rubbed raw by friction.
Da reached out and touched his shoulder again, his hand smoothing over the worn play shirt Tony had made him before he looked up and met Ian’s gaze once more, a smile playing in his eyes.
James looked to Stark with a flicker of uncertainty as if he’d just realized that the vein throbbing at his Father’s temple did not bode well and Stark nodded with a small smile, ignoring Stefen’s glower (like he always did).
“Charlotte.” How to tell her the Reich would never be done with him. Nor he with it. Not until one of them was destroyed. He squeezed her hand and untangled their fingers. She sat back in her chair, smile pleasantly fixed, the moment of vulnerability passing like a puff of smoke.
Sorry this took so long! I got promoted at work, moved apartments, lost my computer, replaced it and in other words life happened. This chapter is entirely in Tony's point of view and covers the month that Steve is gone and the next one (which is almost finished) will be in Steve's. Bonus we finally get to meet Bucky! That should be coming your way within the next week. In the meanwhile enjoy Tony's dive into
But, not only was he coming, the captain was dressed more casually than Tony had ever seen him in plain trousers and a white shirt and a pair of sturdy hiking boots.
Steve watched her hesitate before she nodded again, shoving another piece of soggy bread into her mouth.
“How are the children?” He asked, unable to hold the question in a moment longer, eyes darting about as if he expected to find them nearby. A foolish thought. At this hour they’d still be at lesson.
He wanted to trust Tony, but he couldn’t be sure of where he stood on the Jewish problem. Sympathizing with an eccentric old soldier like Steve was one thing, Jews were entirely another.
A state of fear blanketed everything. It was inevitable that people were beginning to talk about pushing back. It was human nature after all to cast one’s eyes about, looking for weapons, when they were afraid.
“There you are!” Stefen trotted toward them, all energy, effectively stopping what was sure to be yet another collision of wills (and a boring one at that) between himself and Hammer. “Ton-Stark, I need you to- what are you doing?”
"Sometimes the caravan would travel away from Aue. I think these times were hard on my father, but he understood my mother's need to be with her people. I missed him terribly, but I knew that we would always find our way back to him. Along our way Mama would leave messages for other caravans, directing them toward the little cabin in the deep of the woods of Aue where my father lived. A mark like this means shelter..."
Having a full dinner with the entire family present for the first time in months brought an unexpected air of festivity to things. Willamina served knödel along with the pumpkin soup that evening, and the scents of nutmeg and cream wafted through the room as the children chattered about their lessons. They'd been limited to just an hour or two a day while Tony cared for him, and though they'd been very well behaved largely left to their own devices, now that he was visibly on the mend Steve worried that they were growing restless, cooped up for long hours with minimal supervision.
A year ago, even months ago you needn't have worried about speaking your mind. Now it seemed like everywhere Steve turned there was another vacant spot where a friend had been. Caught supporting the wrong ideas. Arrested for the wrong politics. Knifed in their beds to path the way for Hitlers rise.
“I see. And will they be joining the children and I at their lessons?” Tony asked, expecting that they would because there was hardly anything for two young people to get up to during the day besides schoolwork.
Yes, growled like a beast Tony had made the mistake of poking. There was a wildness in the gleam of his eye as he stared into the fires glow that Tony recognized from the mountain.
"Tony!" a familiar voice called from Tony's left. It was followed by a sharp whistle and Tony turned his head, finally catching sight of Clinton. He’d climbed on top of a wooden crate for a better view and was waving vigorously with one hand to catch Tony's attention.  Bucky was standing beside him, looking jumpy. He made something like an apologetic grimace at the passerby who had turned to look and yanked Clint down from the crate.
, otherwise known as the German Youth Movement; the League of German Girls and Hitler’s Youth was born from their structure. The Führer must have admired their accomplishments greatly.”
Without questioning the feeling further, he abandoned his quest for acidic materials to investigate, turning the corner just in time to catch Frauline Werner disappearing into the captain’s study, shutting the door with a soft click behind her.
Frau Hogan gasped, her hands flying to her mouth in horror. Dvorak wrinkled his nose in discomfort and took a step back. Rogers had gotten the fever before, and everyone knew it had taken his wife. The whole house was probably infested with disease.
“That was only because those boys – ” James began but quickly aborted with a pain filled exhalation of breath that made Tony suspect he’d been kicked under the table by Ian.
Ian yanked his way out of Tony’s loosened grip and stumbled toward his father, eyes all ablaze and mouth twisted up stubbornly.
Schmidt had held his gaze - the cold glittering expression in them promising that he would pry Steve’s children from his hands one way or another- and smiled, raising his glass in a toast.
“My dear Captain,” Schmidt interrupted with a tut as if he were speaking to a child and Steve bristled at the insult to his rank. Carefully keeping his face neutral as he corrected him.
Steve let himself a small smile though, trust Kurt to start straight in on the subject Steve was least comfortable with. Dobas had always been implosive, hotheaded and much too eager for good time and glory for Steve’s tastes. Even now Steve wasn't sure if Kurt had missed his company or the customers he brought in.
There was no plan. No fix for this.  They’d been taken off guard and now the enemy had the upper hand. Tony couldn’t hide the chest in Stefen’s study and he couldn’t get into the attic to destroy the radio, and both of those things had been discovered and taken in for evidence.
There was a pause and then the floorboards above creaked and they heard footsteps, and what sounded like something heavy dragging across the floor. He and Péter shared another anxious look and rushed toward the stairs in silent agreement.
“Be reasonable man. If we have to establish a government in Czechoslovakia we’ll need the people’s full support. These are delicate matters.” Striker responded, his lips curling into a smile as he blew out a puff of smoke. “We cannot afford a national divide. I don’t need to explain all this to you, Göring.”
Stefen swayed toward him as if pulled by gravity and Tony swallowed, throat tight and dry and desperate hunger burning low in his belly to touch him. It felt like years since he had touched Stefen.
“That all depends.” Tony replied with a delicate sniff, fighting for his equilibrium back. “I understand that Bruce Banner has been placed here as Chaplin.”
"I spent the night in the Alton's barn.” The older boy explained. “I've been looking for you all day. Are you alright?"
Steve felt a surge of frustration wash over him; not at Tony, but at himself, and the foolish belief he’d so briefly entertained that he could keep this part of himself contained.
And why not? Tony was everywhere in his head. He didn’t have to close his eyes to see his long shapely fingers, or remember they way they had climbed over his arms, scrapping his nerves into a raw fire.
“She adores it.” Tony promised, taking her hand and pulling her away with him into the swirl of dancers.
The man was lying, Tony was sure, though he could not figure out why the Nazi's would lie about something so simple.  But he could tell by the placement of the structure alone that its purpose, no matter how massive, was not to heat the rest of the camp.
“She is. Very.” He responded, sounding short even to his own ears. She was just like Peggy. He trusted her, she was loyal, and had always been a good friend to him. Good company.
“Here you are love, poor thing. Your fingers must be frozen stiff,” the woman tut-tutted reappearing from the kitchen. Ian noticed her eyeing the blue tips sticking out of the strips of burlap he’d wrapped around his hands for warmth as she handed him a steaming cup. It was warm chocolate, he realized with delight, hands still shaking slightly as he raised the cup to his mouth. The taste was a shock to his tongue and almost too rich.
He’d been so selfish with his grief before, he realized that now, but it didn’t make opening up any easier. He was still so afraid of what could happen to them all… but he’d been a coward too long already.
Steve slept. At some point he rolled in his sleep, fitfully jerking back and forth, his body protesting vigorously as the smell of blood and sewer penetrated his dreams. The ugly faces of his attacker morphed and molded into other faces: soldiers, younger, more Italian. The bodies multiplied, so that Steve was pressed close to their stinking cold flesh. They groped at him, his face, and his chest. He couldn’t breathe and he was so damn cold.
“You're leaving?” James cried, the first to notice. He sounded stricken. “You can’t leave us here! You can’t!”
It was the desperation in those depths, the silent understanding between them both that if Tony pushed, Stefen feared he'd give in, and if he lost Tony as a result... Stefen was begging him not to make him face that.
She had a superb chest though, which heaved when she sang. Tony, during one of those rare events where Farkas had let him out of the abbey to travel among a contingent of brothers set out to lend aid to the poor and hear the woes of the people (or something of that accord, Tony had been more concerned with how quickly he could slip free) had gotten the chance to see her sing in just such a lounge a number of years ago. Admittedly he'd not paid much attention to her voice so he couldn't begrudge the woman too much of her stardom.
After a moment a look of determination settled over him and quite decisively he looked back at Tony and announced, "I am going to get him a horse for his birthday. It was awfully far to walk."
Tony had just gotten the children settled into their rooms for a few quiet hours of play and was looking for Harold for a ride into town when he spotted the baroness sitting alone in the sitting room. The radio played a news report in the background. She had paper an and pen in her lap, clearly meant to be writing a letter but her eyes were focused somewhere distant. She looked deceptively small in the big backed chair, a delicate flower in an elegant day dress, plucked from the vine and deposited into the cold lonely room. Tony's steps faltered as he passed the parlor door, hating himself a little for the moment of empathy when she looked up, startled by the sound of his footsteps and locked eyes with him.
“I won’t go to my knees for them!” he continued in that clipped commanding way that Natacha hadn’t quite figured out how to do yet. She squeezed her door open a little further just as father strode by, the baroness right on his heels.
Steve ran until he couldn’t anymore.  He tried to be smart, using thicker pockets of trees for cover and steeper ground to force his pursuers to abandon their vehicles. Even military automobiles were only so equipped for off road travel and Steve was intimate with their weaknesses. After a time, the gunshots behind him grew distant and tapered off altogether. He kept running. The numbness from the morphine faded in staccato bursts of increasingly brighter and brighter pain until it was back in full force a consist burn that covered his entire body.
He was thankful for the small heat lamp tucked between the milk crates in the back of the truck, to keep the milk from freezing in the early hours of morning. It was a long route between small towns in outer salzburgerland, and Bucky was lucky to have caught the dairy man before he started out. It might have taken him another day or two to reach the Villa on foot if he hadn’t. It had cost him the only money he had on him but the delivery man and his boy were a good sort, and had made good on their word to take him as far as the villa.
“That’s enough from both of you. It’s Christmas Eve. Virginia will kill you both if you’re not on your best behavior.”
“He’s seen the radio?” Péter asked hesitantly, looking up again for the first time and Tony nodded. Looking hopefully toward Stefen the boy asked haltingly. "What do you think?"
The future was uncertain now, but some things should stay the same – like celebrating with your loved ones on Christmas and holding them close to you while you still had the chance to do it. Charlotte had been making noise about having a small gathering, to keep up appearances and stifle the rumors circulating after their disastrous trip to the Berghof, all of which would naturally be blamed on the horrible illness that had struck him so unexpectedly. Tony knew it was dangerous to overestimate just how much defiance the Wehrmacht would tolerate from their pet hero, but since Stefen’s shockingly close brush with death, the captain seemed to have turned a corner in his mind where it ceased to matter how the Reich felt or what they would do. Grimly, Tony thought that the reason behind it was that it had finally sunk in that Stefen was going to lose. There was no scenario where good prevailed and the Nazi regime crumbled without touching his family.
“The theory of radioactivity…” Péter wet his lip nervously before looking back up at Tony, and going on with more determination. “Did a woman really do that?”
He could see that now. Steve had lost weight and even though it was clear he’d been out in the sun his skin, which had always favored his gaja fathers, was an unhealthy shade of pale. In Vienna Bucky had thought when the bruising faded his skin would return to normal. Instead Steve looked...ill. Just ill. Almost the way he’d looked as a little boy.
Steve stepped forward, opening his mouth to demand to know what was going on but he was cut off by the door swinging open announcing that the Mayor had finally arrived. Hasenkamp strode in briskly clutching at a brief case, his puffy brow glistening with sweat despite the cold outside.
“He’ll do well for the Sicherheltsdienst. They’re expanding you see. Anyway,” he fluttered a hand at Steve as if he were discussing the weather, “before he left he expressed concern over your son. Why he wasn’t taking his rightful place at the officer school.”
The children’s world was changing rapidly, Tony wished it wasn’t so but he also knew that Péter going away to school was for the best. He was certain that if the boy were to stay, that he would be hurt and eventually killed. This unshakable certainty was there every time Tony looked at that thin boy with the kind face and the crooked reading glasses he didn’t wear enough. It was there in his bright eyes and compassionate gaze and in the determined way in which he went about getting an excitable Artur to focus on combing the grass for the correct sort of stone. And it was there, in the under bed of his nails that for a few days a week were always stained a faint red that somebody less attuned to small details and less sharp of mind might have missed. Péter Rogers was a good boy.
His first stop would have to be Diagon alley, there he could listen and observe and hopefully pick up some information without anyone realising what they were giving out. He would have to visit the daily prophet offices and Gringotts while he was there.
"If he was with either of them we would of found him years ago, heimdall would of and you know I had my feelings about them" He said bluntly.
Thor grew concerned he knew what that blank face meant, he would not like what came out of his brother's mouth next.
Loki, closed his eyes and clenched his fists, he did hate to be reminded of such a horrid time, these mortals always brought it up, it was like they were born with a lack of tact.
There was pause and then some rustling As the phone exchanged hands and finally Tony heard someone breath out and say.
He doesn’t feel as though he’s pain but he doesn’t want to argue with an all powerful sentient stone.  “When can I leave?” he asks instead.
He pulled the stack of parchment towards him that cut-throat had put in front of his godfather and got to reading, he was not stupid enough to sign something without reading it first no matter how much more respect and trust cut-throat and Harry had for each other which was a lot more than was normal between goblins and wizards.
Harry was currently wondering who was the parent in his and his godfather’s relationship, the man was just about jumping out of his skin with excitement and mostly likely due to a sugar high.
“There are many doorways to other planets hidden throughout the cosmos if you know where to look, they are not all that hard to find” Came the vague and not all that helpful reply.
Peter takes a step towards them but stops with one foot hovering over the other and just like whatever demon was possessing the boy is gone.
Tony stormed into the briefing room A.k.A the common room to vent his frustrations to the aforementioned Steven Grant Rogers.
Because Tony knows Peter would have treated her like his little sister, looked out for her, protected her. He would have been an amazing big brother.
“Late afternoon tomorrow, Mr Ross said we could take the company’s plane, we will leave early morning”
. The team is understandably a bit co-dependent at this time and whenever one of them gets hurts the rest always gravitate around that person until they’re better.  Which is fine when it’s someone other than him that has to suffer through all the hovering and mother henning.
Peter keeps on walking until something changes and he see’s another figure in the distance and he knows just like he knew with the soul stone that this figure was Gamora daughter of Thanos.
When he looks up he spots Peter hanging onto the celling like well like a spider, hissing at anyone who comes close. Even Tony
Maybe it was time that he took a very long vacation, one that lasted a few years, at the very least until Harry was of age to go to Illvermory as Hogwarts was out of the question regrettably and then it would be down to good old muggle fake names and disguises along with some glamour charms to keep Harry’s identity safe.
“Bruce now!” Shouts Tony, Bruce nods his mind made up, if it keeps him calm then, Bruce will help. He turns to Strange and T’challa they can take the kid to Wakanda, they nod and plan is put into motion but just as he’s about to pick the kid up he opens his eyes again.
Tony made to get up before Steve grabbed his arm and once again let loose the eyebrow of disappointment.
“No. No you haven’t I have. I felt it when we were on Titan. I felt that moment where everything changed. I felt as my body tore itself apart just to be put back together again. Everyone else was the lucky one they didn’t feel. They were gone in an instance. I wasn’t.  I felt as my body fought death, as time went on I felt it get weaker, felt it break down until it lost the battle. Until I was nothing, until I felt nothing and then I was gone to.”
Tony found himself to be surprisingly hurt by this statement and rushed to explain himself, he didn’t want his nephew to think he had just abandoned him.
'James and I, we’re in hiding right now. James didn't want to tell you…I agreed because I knew you would want us to go to you… Insist that you could keep us safe'
Peter finally stops talking and relaxes into his hold like he never wants to leave and let’s out a happy sigh.
For a second he’s just staring blankly ahead before he turns Tony and looks him the eye and asks “Have you ever felt that moment when you know with ever fibre of your being that you were going to die and there was nothing not a single thing you could do to change that”
James stands up instantly and performs a mirror spell on the front door. His mouth hangs open in disbelief for a moment before he gets himself together and turns to his wife.
His son groaned and got up from the table and hobbled towards the door reluctantly, the freak would pay for making them pause their dinner.
Which started a new line of thought entirely, he did want Harry to experience the same childhood that he had, that Lily had before she was adopted?
Tony thinks that a lot has changed in five years, he has a daughter now and they had just celebrated her fifth birthday.
“While you do that we can also do the claiming, you will need to prove that you have a legitimate claim first heir Potter-Black, so one drop of your blood on this parchment please.”
“Get lost, cyborg” A higher more feminine voice answered presumably Quill replied. “Like you know any more than I do”
Tony needed to find out where his nephew was now, he knew from the letter that going to Sirius would lead him nowhere, but he had no other way of finding out where Harry was, there would be no sign of him in the system as there wasn’t with his father, and Lily after her 11th birthday.
