The bell rings to signal the end of gym and Cindy feels like just laying on the ground and just..... Never move again.
"Wellllll....... Pepper may or may not have cleared the entire thing with the PR and the board of directors, and Fury finally gave the go ahead for Steve and me coming out to the public  I have a press conference the day after the fair." he says cautiously  looking for Peter's reaction.
"Mr. Stewart is this about the clothes?  I just got new ones because my old ones got ripped " also why did this have to happen in the middle of class with all the other student watching?
"Fine, but as long as you're here, I'm coming with." Peter sighed but agreed, he may be perfectly fine, but any excuse to spend time with his boyfriend is a good excuse in his book.
"Ok, I know you’ve been gone for like twenty minutes,  but we just got the magazines,  and holy shit Miss Jones did it!!" Mami practically squeals.
It didn't have to mean anything and he definitely wasn't going to tell anyone, It's just! The man was what Thor would describe as perfect, Bruce felt like warm tea and books and calm all the while hiding so much raw power that he could destroy anything he wanted to.
"So what's the game plan for tomorrow? " Ned asks. Peter for the life of him, couldn't figure out if there was anything important coming up tomorrow. It doesn't matter anyway, after the schedule he has been keeping, it's a miracle his fathers let him come in today.
"So, Pete,  anything interesting happen today?" Tony asked him when they were working on the suit that day.
"What is this democracy?" Alfred moaned into his hand. The rest of the class seemed pretty entertained by their squabble, other than Ms. Terry that is, but she hated everything that came out of Peter's mouth so he didn't pay her any mind.
"Well, he does look like a hobo." Flash agrees taking the joke as a signal that Tony is on his side ...... Ned almost worries for the boy........... almost.
Steve is a great cook who wants Peter to eat more with his enhanced metabolism, Why would he complain?
Peter looks around and finds a pen to stab Obadiah-Mandarin-Skull  with since he had taken the bullets out beforehand.
"I'll do both of those I think." Alice smiled. "Come on, I'll just take you to the group." Alice grabbed a  box of security passes and lead Peter towards the entrance.
"No buts, you're all great and I can't choose one to be better than the other." Peter said sternly, the three of them ignoring Peter's classmates and a snickering Ned.
"So what's going on with you and Thor?" Tony says and sits down opposing Bruce . Bruce wished the tea that sprayed from his mouth caught Tony and removed the insufferable smirk.
Happy insisted on the widows being tinted!! Besides that car was probably the least showy car in their garage!!!
"Wade, calm down, remember your no kill streak? It's been six months, don't break it." Peter tried to calm his boyfriend down and sent a warning glare towards Flash to keep. His. Mouth. Shut.
"You did that on purpose. " Bruce glared. Normally getting glared at by the man who turnes into a giant green rage monster scares people. Unfortunately Tony Stark has never been normal. So, He doesn't even flinch.
Natasha got close to Flash and whispered something that sounded suspiciously like "sleep with one eye open" Peter sighed, He'd have to talk to his spider-godmother about killing teens.
"No Wade come on, we're on a tour" Peter sent a pleading look at Sara who took the hint and began hearing them all towards lab 53.
Buzzfeed continuees to not give the full picture,  he didn’t just ask the lady to stop flirting with dad, he made out with him infront of god and everyone.
Ned doesn't really know what role he has in the SI. The official term is something close to paid intern. The unofficial term is more "Peter's best friend who makes codes with Tony and Peter for the suits sometimes, and helps other interns the other times."
Hel, Thor let the man ramble on for hours to watch the way his eyes light up when he's feeling passionate about the subject. Nevermind he didn't even understand what the man ever said.
It doesn't even take ten minutes for people to start recognizing him, normally, Peter doesn't have work in the levels lower than 50. Heck, he barely walks in through the front doors! When he does go lower however, he's usually in a frenzy. So he can't be blamed if he doesn't recognize half of the people who are smiling at him right?
His phone projected a hologram of Tony Rogers-Stark,  Steve Rogers-Stark and Natasha Romanoff they looked slightly disgruntled,
"Let me stop you right there, if you're talking about Peter then he's not just an intern." Clint ground out. He was about to add something but Flash cut him off.
But before Flash could reply something, someone from the crowd (and when had that gathered? come on super senses, what are you doing) yelled out,
Ned makes eye contact with MJ. The girl's face containing a profound displeasure at yet again being told that they'll like the destination, Ned understood the sentiment.
They loaded on the bus, even though Mr. Warren told them, where they were going, they could have walked also. Peter thanked Mr. Warren's common sense for having the fore sight of actually taking the bus instead of letting the kids walk.
Officer Francine Pennington looked scandalized at the very idea, and Peter got it, he really did. Regular people would probably be traumatised after being nearly kidnapped, he himself had to calm down a lot of people.
And if Thor gets rejected, of this there is a very big chance, Bruce could turn back to being reclusive. Thor could not take that chance.
Ahem.... That probably wouldn’t work out great. Besides,  he doesn’t even know if Tony's into guys or not, let alone him.
"Guys, come on, let's meet the Avengers!" he exclaimed a bit... childishly and proceeded to heard the tour group towards the elevator.
"I don't know man, I hope not." Peter nervously chewed his lips and looked out the window as his worst fears came to life.
Ned and Mrs. Leeds walked towards his stall and he happily explained to her what exactly Mary did. He did see her eyes mist up when she heard what he named Mary, but didn’t comment on it. Really, Ned and Mrs.  Leeds were both too good for this world.
To the media concerned There will be a press release held at  02:00 pm tomorrow. We cannot disclose the reason as of yet, but it is of extreme importance.
Peter blushed and coughed quietly. rubbing his hands when he got in the building, the tour group was already there, the intern was passing out the security passes. he ignored the group in favour of holding his snacks bag in one hand and texting Shuri with the other.
"Mr. Stark I have a question for you!" Flash was waving his hand like and if the smirk he gave Peter was any indication, he was about to ask something really really stupid.
He looked behind the officer to see that his pops had one hand over his dad's shoulder and boy did they look mad.
"Really it's cool Maddie, we should get going with the tour." he cuts her off with a smile. The girl nods looking slightly starstruck.
"We came to talk to him Tony and maybe getting him in a safe environment would help improve his behaviour. " his pops sighed.
Peter hoped that it wasn't something bad, they just had the baddie of the week the day before yesterday. (also he wouldn't want to miss a fight, a fight where he could fight with the earth's mightiest heroes -he can fanboy a little even if it is his family)
"You know Howard, I've hated you for a while. Ever since you raised a hand on Tony in fact." he paused.
Peter was glad to see that no physical harm was done and breathed a sigh of relief. He looked towards Ned and MJ to see Ned with his hand over his mouth, and MJ biting her lips to stop laughing. She also seemed to have her crisis notebook out.
In hindsight he really shouldn’t have left the tower without the nanotech suit or maybe he should have paid more attention to his surroundings because one minute he was just putting his phone in his pocket, the next he woke up on floor in a dark room.
"Why are you calling my Baby boys best friend a fatass?" A new voice joined their fray, from right next to Flash's ear. MJ looked impressed by the fact he managed to get so close without any one noticing despite wearing red and black.
Peter debated whether it was worth it to just wither away in bed and sleep the rest of his life, but decided against it. He groaned.
"The chaperon of a tour seems to have asked him to leave the premises. one of his students is showing signs of bullying young sir."
Thor glared, "Do not taunt me with what I can't have Steven, especially considering you are on the same boat."
The class window Isn't really anything like some of the floor to ceiling ones at the Tower,  as a result the Iron Man suit had to tilt a little to get in, but Friday angled the suit so the walls were spared.
"Dude, remember that kinda trigger happy insane guy I told you not to mess with, this is his boyfriend.  Trust me you need to call this off. " Bob says as he takes the mask off and procede to give his gun to another guy.
"Grow some balls on you Wilson? Think you can talk back to me?" Tyler crowded him like he was trying to intimidate him. Wade debated standing to his full height and taking off his hoodie and see if he had enough courage to look him in the eyes then.
"Now listen here miss, I don't know who you think you are, but-" Mr Tritter was cut off by The king of Wakanda himself standing beside the girl with a hand around her shoulder.
"He must have hacked the AI! " Flash exclaimed. MJ gritted her teeth then made eye contact with someone behind him. a minute later a mechanical spider jumped on Flash's head and the boy was jumping around trying to get it off. MJ smirked and the rest of the students laughed. Mr. Tritter tried to Get the spider off the boy's head and succeeded to do so after a minute or two (or ten, but who's counting?)
No one really saw the looming dark shadow near the child. Steve smiled his angelic smile when he saw the Baby.
He just could never get the eye right, he knew tony would scoff, "It's just simple brown eyes babe". And Steve would have to conquer with there being absolutely nothing simple about those eyes thank you very much, it takes about months for him to correct a single skech of his husband.
"I really don't think you can wingman for me in this case" Steve definitely did not have a shakey voice because Tony was still pressed against him even if he wasn’t reaching for the sketchbook thank you very much.
Peter Rogers-Stark had a lot of regrets in life, for a teenager, and for a super hero. Those regrets constitutes from not being able to be the best, to that one taco he had a few days ago. (Man he should not have let /someone/ talk him into eating that taco)
"Hello, Midtown High, my name is Sara and I'll be your tour guide today, before we begin I need to give you security pa...." She trails off as her eyes catches sight of Peter and bugs out,
Peter kisses him and immediately all his attention shifts to him. Whenever Peter kisses him Wade feels like he feels it with his whole being, every single of his senses focused on Peter. It happened the first time they kissed, still happens now, and he really can't see it stopping anytime soon. Peter is like a plug to all his senses that just pushes everything away.
Peter sighs and shakes his head looks towards his teacher pleadingly who is currently slightly pale faced and visibly shaken.
Tony was working on his suit while wondering how long would Steve's workout session with Peter would last. He really wanted to work (hang out) with the kid.
"Wait what do you mean in his school lab, I thought you helped him make it?" Steve seemed confused looking at the robot.
(Yes he knows they have a crush on each other. No they don't know about the other one's crush. No he is not allowed to tell ether of them if he wants to live. And yes it is absolutely frustrating when they have a supernatural marathon and both of them complain about Cas and Dean.)
"Oh, Peter thank god you're here, listen, I'm gonna have to borrow Sara for a while, could you lead the tour? thanks!" And just as soon as she came, she left pushing Sara out the door cartoon style.
Tony looked at him, his face telling what he thought about that interruption,  it was specifically his 'what made you think you have enough intelligence to interrupt me you heathen' face that he knew from Pepper that was frequently used on board members.
"Wait, you actually do like me? I thought Brunnhilde was just kidding, you don't really have a reason to like me, and I thought Hulk would be an anti incentive since that thing in Sakaar and he did hit you before too, besides you're so gorgeous and you could have your pick of person why would you choose me and now I'm rambling, ... "
"Alright alright, I won't. You finished with the notes?" Tony changes the subject. Peter eyes him carefully before he answers,
And....... Surprisingly Peter Parker.  Huh, she didn’t expect him to be able to stand after the marathon. Peter raises his shirt to wipe his face and........
"Manage what Flash?" he asked flatly. The limit to the amount of time he could deal with douches in one day exceeded after that terrible phone call.
"Friday, send this footage to all the Avengers, and the undead asshole and Pepper too, so she would understand why we have a dead kid in the facility."
"But he will, he's so beautiful and he'll find someone else who's beautiful, and they'll be beautiful together! " he wails again this time hugging Betty. She hugged him back instinctively.
"Now listen here, I don't need no trouble here We're just looking for someone and I'll just take 'im and leave. " Mr. Yelli says while pointing his gun at the students.
"Hey, bambino, it's ok. At least you can brag about your Fathers being Avengers  now ?" Tony says playfully, giving Peter a side hug. Peter returns it because no matter how mad he is he really cant stay mad at his family.
"This is what I meant by you two not being subtle. Everyone is listening to you two right now. Do you want to announce something to the world Ned? " MJ pointed out. Bless her terrifying attitude.
she paused to take a breath eyes roaming over the students.  Not the least bit perturbed that they were only half listening to her and half gawking at the tower.
Before they could rip Flash and Eleanor a new one, the doors opened, and in walked MJ and the subject of their conversation.
After Mr. Leroy checks the attendance and the rest of Ned's class is finished with ogling the building, they're all herded inside.
"PETYPIE!!!!" Was Peter's only warning barring his spider sense before he was tackled by a very enthusiastic Deadpool.
"He's been going on about his 'great' project Ever. Since. We. Got. Here. This. Morning. " MJ practically hissed.
Charlie wasn’t there this time it was.  Well, it was Charlie but a different Charlie.  His name is Charlie bucket. Really, the SI employees have the weirdest  names.
She asks and Peter doesn’t have to answer because of the noise and clamour that follows the avengers in public.
"He indirectly asked me if I was getting money for buying new things by selling drugs." Peter sighed. Ned gaped at him
"It is see?" Peter pointed to the window next to him and Ned looked out, frowned, and then contemplated,
She  has seen the Avengers tower before, heck it was kinda impossible not to see the giant tower if you live in new york, and same goes for Tv in all over the world.
His fathers were in the room, his family was in the room, his boyfriend was in the room and they look like they're covering up that they're mad.
Peter withered down looking at the floor, something he does when he is confronted about putting himself in danger for the sake of others, or just suffering in silence for some atrocious reason
His suspicions were confirmed when there was a nervous giggle from the front, "uh, no actually, I'm-im in a relationship I meant any questions about the tour?"
Ned looked around to see the slack jawed expressions of his classmates. He could not help but think, 'it be like that sometimes '
"Yeah yup totally, rivals. Flash and me rivals since middle school. " Peter felt that sometimes he should just sew his mouth shut. That was the worst attempt at lying and he was talking to the Black widow for Christ's sake!
Peter could hear everyone squeak out a "SON?!?!" Before Tony spoke up, "you know what kid? Could you get out of the building please? Just get out, we'll have a talk with your principal tomorrow, just get out of my building now." Peter looked at Mr. Warren, the man seemed to want to protest, but, really, what do you say against Ironman and Captain America? Flash -who for once seemed to get survival instinct- bolted out of the door.
"I know I just....got.... caught up, I didn't mean to I swear." the three men sighed Steve ruffled Peter's hair
An intern is waiting for them in front of the ID detector. Try as he might Ned could never really remember the names of all of the employees. Not even all under his jurisdiction. There are just so many scientists and personnel and interns working for SI.
"She's kidding. But nothing against you, Peter has a boyfriend,  and they're really happy." Ned says
"Congratulations on getting Peter's adoption public MJ. How many magazine did you go to?" Betty congratulates her when the superhusbands leave and the class has a few minutes to walk by themselves.
"This is the last room in the tour, the people in here are all working on transferring  the reactor tech to everyday lives, from generators to batteries, anything you can think of that could need a power source, the reactor is being tweaked, updated and whatever that needs to be done to make it work. " Betty announces cheerfully.
"WHAT DOES SHE MEAN NOT USE THE FRONT DOOR? DO YOU SNEAK IN THE TOWER PENIS?!?? IS THAT WHY SHE KNOWS YOU?"
He did have to stop halfway however, abruptly at that, when the whole warehouse exploded into a million goddamn pieces.
"I didn't know either, turns out they sent an email to my parents, who didn't even tell me I had a field trip." Peter was not pouting goddamnit.
"Oh, Allfather's beard, don't tell me you didn't tell him you're in love with him? It's been ages Thor!"
"you two need to bang, or kiss or whatever just get rid this stupid ust! I'm getting suffocated" he pointed at Steve and Tony.
"As fun as it has been to stare at each other's faces for 10 minutes, I have better things to be doing." MJ cuts into the scilence
Turns out he did not have to worry about that because apparently May was a strong woman who knew when her time was up, and had talked to Tony -and by extension Steve- about taking the boy in.
If you asked their tiny group what they would do if there was a field trip to Avengers tower a year ago, Ned would have laughed. Peter would have panicked and MJ would smirk and proceed to draw Peter's face in her crisis notebook.
"As he was saying, Peter was Tony's intern before we adopted him, he still works on the company, but he's more of a trainee to Tony than an intern. " Steve finishes. Pointedly staring at Flash.
"What's up with you space cadet, it's not normal for us to sneak up on you " MJ comments she doesn't look up from her sketch pad, but it's a near thing, which means she's actually worried.
i'm glad you asked  @ takashit, because, you see,  here I was doing some experimente with Tony, and some.......... House hold equipments when a chsese grater slipped and got thrown at me
He looks around just in time to see Ned bounding towards him with a gleeful Wade and smirking MJ in tow
Hell with Barton always finishing his donuts.  Not even the Supersoldiers or Peter or Thor did that. And Tony walked back to the tower while making sure Pepper gets the message that he would in no way be able to make it to the next meeting and planing what prank he could play on Clint.
"Well it wasn’t exactly what I wanted to spend my day either" Tony grumbled as he hugged Natasha too. Clint and Bucky joined on the group hug and thor got enthusiastic enough to lift all four of them off the ground.
"I wanna help you though, dad's a genius  but he's dense as a baby of concrete and superglue when it comes to feelings. 'sides, why do you think I never called you uncle?" Steve stared at Peter.
"You're sure this will work though, because the people are actually waiting for the king and his consort. "
So my intern just forced me to go through the # brokenstony. So.... @ ActuallyIrish wanna say something?
"but hey! look at the bright side, I don't have to go to school tomorrow! " Peter tried to sound upbeat.
"Hmm, never mind, if he gets too rowdy I'm sure Wade will put a stop to it." Steve said with a smile that really made Peter question whether the "it" in question is the bullying or Flash breathing........ Knowing his boyfriend, It's probably the latter.
"What? He was serious?  You? Peter goodie Two shows Rogers-Stark selling drugs?  " Peter was  treated to another bout of laughter.
"What the fuck did you call my kid?" Tony asked with a calm facade, but one look at him would reveal the storm brewing behind his mask.
"You know I always wondered why someone as smart and amazing as Tony has self worth issues, I  guess I  just found out huh?" his glare could cut through steel and the prone man on the floor whimpered.
"I just had to fall for the unattainable guy, anything else just wasn’t enough for my stupid life. "
It's not really believable for Tony McFreaking Rogers-Stark to start signing permission slips for sixteen year olds, especially since the news that said sixteen year old was adopted wasn't even out to the news yet. ("I'm working on it Tony, its hard to manage the PR when I have to manage it for /you/"—Pepper Potts  2k18)
"Hey cap!" Tony walks in on him drawing him yet again this time startling him into closing the sketchbook with a thump.
"Alright buddy, here's the deal, you keep your mouth shut the rest of the trip, and don't bother Peter or his friends. Ever. And you walk out of here alive. Do we have a deal?"
Before he could decide what he should do, in came the intern who he made eye contact with when he caught Shana. Turns out he did go to get help and not because he's scared of his ugly mug.  Go figure.
"Yup, It's a three year plan but I'll probably get there. Of course Tony could still reject me, but I do have a plan."
Peter was really thankful for MJ's intervention and putting her hand over Ned's mouth. He was probably about to talk about spiderman again.
"Flash, literally no one else cares, can you trun the jealously down please, I can't hear Ms. Trinket over it." Cindy bit out.
"No, being team mom makes you mom.... What am I doing with my life? Why am I convincing my father that he's a mom?"
Bucky sighs, "Still traking the van through the CCtv footage, would've been easier on them and on friday if it had a licence plate"
Peter, in what he considers to be possibly his wisest decision throughout the entire week, sits on the ground with the others handing his phone quietly  all the while keeping a careful eye on the assaulters.
Peter gets down excitedly throwing a few helloes and good days while he gets out of the tower, (real talk, Peter, like his father doesn't remember the name of a lot of the people who works for them. he just smiles and greets when they greet him)
"HAH I WAS RIGHT PENIS PARKER! YOU WERE LYING!!!!!" He yelled, and was about to go off again when a knife and two bulletes whized closely past his head. Some red tendrils of magic was hovering next to his head threateningly.
"Oh his overseas trip with Tony Rogers-Stark? Give it a rest, no one will believe you and we'll see you're lying when we reach there anyway. " Flash walked away.
He was pushed back, his back thudding on the wall. His vision had little black spots dancing in it. He blinked to clear his eyes only to see a hulking mass standing in the circle. The creature's eyes glowed like blue fire. The smile on his lips as sweet at they come. His hair a surprising blond.
"It's Friday, go take a nap, and I swear I'll get back to you on this" Dr. Banner nodded and stalked out of the room, hopeful to his room to sleep. Ned, pointedly ignored all of his classmates who were (very unsubtly) pointing at him and whispering.
"I know you realise that he genuinely cares for Peter, and I know for a fact that you respect that." Tony merely grumbled.
"Additionally, you get a pseudo step son if you ever do get together with Bruce." Steve pointed out and smirked at him.
"I...... You know what I don't have to answer that." Bucky looses it yet again and Nat took a bottle from the fridge. Its labelled as Natasha's and he's pretty sure it was Vodka.
The rest of the class was too excited to notice Ned's worried face or MJ's amused one. (Just like no one knew that she texted Clint that morning while on the bus)
Eleanor was.....  How to put this? Desperate to be on the top of the social chain. Cindy feels some people just pity her at this point with this many rumours swirling around her. Cindy personally thinks It's really nobodys business who she slept with but that's just her.
"Then, and again I know it won't happen, but on the off chance that it does, Then you get me and Bets in the divorce,  how bout that?" Cindy yet again shows off her absolute lack of people skills.
Wade for his part, looked at Flash forlornly as though not being able to kill him is a great dissatisfaction then waves goodbye to leave. he shared a curt nod with MJ, (They had this You Hurt Him I Hurt You And We Don't Interact Otherwise relationship).
"I don't think anyone in our school will take over the world Mr. Barton. Why would you think that?" he asks like the Dumbass he is.
"Well considering that I know everyone of you used that excuse at some point, let's go home before we tell him how dumb it was of him to get in a strange van when someone offers him food" Rhodey inputs after pointing Bucky to thank the Officer Peter was talking to.
"Whatcha got there soldier? " He asks, because it would be a cold day in hell when he can leave well enough alone.
"Come on, it'll be fun, imagine the faces when they see the avengers sparring with Deadpool and someone they think is an intern." Sam says with an evil grin of his own.
"And this is one of the higest labs we are going in today. As you can see this is one of the reasearch areas. " Betty points out.
Sam, Natasha and Bucky collectively grimaces. They knew Tony was dense, but to this degree...... Yeah, Peter was right.
"The tour group is waiting for Boss's appearance and you're here to talk on his behalf until he gets here mini boss."
Natasha let out a soft growl. "Which teacher is it? Isn't he supposed to call and check home first?"
: they went on a karaoke double date and MJ and her girlfriend sang Toxic together and Peter and his boyfriend Danced to Take me to Church.
Some thing like this has been going on for the last three days, Peter has gotten a total of.... 5? no 6 hours of sleep in the last three days, needless to say he doesn't appreciate Mr. Tritter going on and on about the periodic table.
Cindy looked at Eleanor to see the girl look dazed,  like she had no idea what happened.  It was.... Probably the first time she was rejected.  Cindy shrugged to herself when she left. There's a first time for everything
He moved away and commanded, "medic on field" and watched with the judges as Mary came to life with a mechanical whirl.
After sending them away, Peter pointedly ignored the stares his peers kept giving him. Even though a yelling Flash is hard to ignore.
Whoops. Well, at least the golden boy of America tried his hardest. There was no way for him to stop that after all.
He made sure Bucky didn't kill Howard. He had no need foe Maria Stark, but Howard. Howard needed to see what he did when it was too late.
Peter jumps then whirls in his arms. All Wade could think about was how good it was to hold him again. He is the perfect hugging size and shape.
Pepper walked in holding her coffee in one hand and her phone in the other looking every bit the business queen she is.
"Then why do you let Flash push you around? You could just call your dads and he'd back off forever!"
"Wade! These are my friends Ned And MJ." Peter introduced. MJ looked up at Deadpool with narrowed eyes, and Ned poked him to make sure he is real.
:and he's so kind you know. Because of how he looks and some stuff in his past people just assume he's just not capable of being good but that's not true. He is one of the kindest people i know. And he's, he's just been dealt such a terrible hand in life and anyone else would just not have a shred of decency in his spot but he's just so damn kind. He constantly puts himself in harms way for others.
Peter was about to answer when a young man of around 19 with blonde hair and blue eyes came to greet them.
"Rogers-Stark who is this? " his fahter's voice was clipped. He supposed he was weary seeing an unknown number.
"Yes, and Bucky's captured by Hydra, but we will be out in the future. " the man smiled, it came more like a grimace. Howard nodded,
This is a reminder to everyone that follows me to strengthen their garage security or they might find a stray billionaire in there
He wanted the man to anguish in the realization that the son he so easily gave up before the boy was even born, that boy filled his roles better than he ever did.
"Nothing bad Miss Jones, just a new intern, she seems bright." Fishlegs says as he gives her a file to sign.
"Kid, you made your web formula in your school lab by yourself how many  fifteen year olds do you think has that kind of talent?" said the robot.
Natasha was doing yoga, and attempting to teach Wanda to do the same (Wanda, who hates Yoga) Bucky was lifting weights with his metal arm (weights that are waaaay less then his limit of carrying things.) Vision was calmly floating. Rhodey was apparently punching a punching bag (which is exercising, something he usually wouldn't do without Steve's coaxing)
Cindy stared at Betty's face to see it go to heart eyes in a second...... It was. ..  Kinda embarrassing actually.
"Yeah, he should definitely come back from an overseas trip to go to a field trip to where he already works? Get your priorities straight Flash." Ned replied. Never mind that he has told both of his friends to grab a quinjet and come back just for the trip because he didn't want to go alone, Flash is a dick.
Peter omitted the part where Flash was having a mighty good time tormenting Peter all day, he said something about Peter not going because he didn't want his secrets to get spilt. But whatever , Peter was already too upset to pay any attention to the other boy.
Peter grit his teeth. "I said leave my stall. Any moment my dad's gonna be here, and trust me, you can't handle a lawsuit from him" he'll probably have to move Flash to a secure location.  Maybe get him an emancipation?
"Our tour guide is going to be here, so be on your best behaviour,  that means no name calling,  no fighting, and definitely no disrespect towards the SI and Employees.  "
He fell in love with many over the centuries, the latest resulting in the disaster with Jane. But never before did he fall as fastly and deeply in love before. Not throughout the cosmos.
When he just finished his patrol last night there was a house fire that took an hour to get in control. After that some burglars thought it would be a perfect time to rob a house. After stopping that, he saw Doctor Octavius, looking vaguely suspicious.
"Peter is my son, and I hope you didn't have any plans to come back to this building ever again, because you're banned forever. "  Tony spit out.
"Hey, fatass, where's your intern of this tower now?" Flash jeered for the hundredth time for the last hour, he was currently getting on Ned's nerves.  If it weren't for Peter's secret, he would've just yelled out how much of a not intern Peter actually is.
A noise comes from the pillow that Steve has his head burried in. The other occupants decides to take it as a negative answer.
He looked at the assailant and had to stop from recoiling. He had never in all his years that he knew the boy has seen Flash Thompson so pale and ashen.
They walked to the door only to find Eleanor  all over Peter's personal space. The boy looked extremely uncomfortable.
"People! The wall closest to the door! If they are going to shoot they're gonna aim where you are the first thing!" he says and they slowly but surely go to said corner.
"So how did you manage that Penis?" Peter sighed, It's not that he couldn't totally break out of Flash's grip on his shoulder, but it just raises more questions.
His super strength and spider sense is the only reason why he didn't topple over when someone pounced at him with a cry of,
Howard Stark was desperate. He didn't really know what he's going to do, sure he is young. Very young for a CEO of a weapons company. But the amount of stake he has had to put into this project is grand even for him.
"You told aunt Pepper about Flash?!" Peter yelps. He thought she was the only family member who didn't know.
"Yeah I've got a question for ya cutie are you single?" Jessie giggled from somewhere in front, now that he noticed all the girls had moved to the front while the boys were pushed to the back. His plot scenes began tingling,{ O_O } that was babyboy up front wasn't it? {How the-}
@ C Giacometti he's actually the least chill, and the PSA's are a lie. He never followed a rule in his life.
Ah, so that explains it, Amilia  and Alice used to have suffocating amounts of sexual tention, they got together Six months ago, that must be why she's so tense.
"Well, you could grab a beanbag and your laptop and hop to it, looks like you have a project to sell. You'll have all the data emailed to you already. " Fishlegs pointed towards the monitor and there it was, her picture next to a  project number.
Peter supposed he was the leader. He was the one wearing the black mask  Peter desided to call him Mr  yelli in his head since he sure could yell.
He and Bucky got to the center of the mat, the rest of them were relaxing under the highly elevated viewing area, if Peter ever trains in this room, he tends to avoid looking at that area,the less attention he pays to people  that might be looking at him the better.
"What happened?  Did something blow up in the lab?" Steve says already getting up and walking out of the room. Tony didn’t tell him about working on anything potentially life threating, but he has a running theory that his husband doesn’t realize when something could harm him.
@ Foley you will not believe how cute he is, I just wanted to stuff him in my pocket and take him home with me.
Peggy blinked, what was she doing in an interrogation room? A groan coming from the floor made her look down to see Howard clutching his jaw.
Remember how he mentioned Parker luck laughing at his face in the beginning ? Yeah, it's doing exactly that right now. Peter can feel something is about to go wrong (which he can but you know what he means)
"Peter! My dude, My nerd, I was just telling Falcon here that I am the superior uncle." Clint grinned.
"Ok, I guess, and you all, bar Peter is a part of the avengers initiative,  to save the earth from grand scale harms?"
"Which is good because you look beat. Is Wade allowed to visit again? or did he break something... again?"
The class was busy gawking at MJ walking behind Pepper. They used a different ID detector, meaning they didn't bother looking up from their phones or scan any pass they just walked through one and into an elevator.
"Class, has your parents alerted you that they have been sent an email the day before yesterday for the upcoming field trip? Apparently all of them accepted so you are all going to the field trip today." Peter jerked, email? His dads didn't tell him about getting anything. He raised his hand and Mr. Warren cut him off,
Granted he was getting way better at it since he started to go to his uncle Bruce to clear up what he didn't understand.
For the first time since Thor came to the realization that he loves Bruce, a tenetive hope grew. Maybe Bruce actually reciprocated?
"He looked like he was ready to cry, what did he tell you?" Natasha cut straight to the point. Steve sighed.
Here ye here ye, this is a callout post for @ BeeQueen who thought  @ Stark Industries  aka @ parkour isn’t that cute. I would also like to inform that yes, yes I am that petty,  and my boyfriend is frankly gorgeous.
Before the Avengers could answer, the door opened again and a girl walked in, she looked around, saw the tour group (Ned waved hello) and decided that she was not dealing with this and promptly walked out. Asking Friday about another Gym.
"Oh, and Howard, when I meet you in hell. It might not be fun for you." he says and turns then walks out.
"YEAH, I JUST WANT TO CUDDLE WITH BABY BOY WHY IS THAT SO BAD?" Wade yelled out from where he was dodging repulsor blasts.
"It's ok, man, I'm still bummed you can't come to the surprise field trip tomorrow, it's gonna suck without you there."
"Well, no. I tested her in a lab, but haven’t gotten out to the field yet. But I do have plans to finish all the functions by a few months, so I'll be taking her out then."
"Oh, ha ha ha, oh my god your face! Pfffft hows it going in traitor land Bets?" Cindy maneged to get out between her gafaws.
Also fuck Tyler and his uncle's friend. Who cares if he works there? And why does he have to be so loud?
"PENIS PARKER IS FRIENDS WITH THE PRINCESS OF WAKANDA?!" Flash yells out. Peter sighs then suddenly a knife, an arrow and a bullet graze past Flash making the boy jump and shiver.
When Peter went inside he was pleasantly surprised to see Deadpool running around the living area, then his brain processed the fact that the other boy was actually  running for his life.
There was six guys with guns, two of them were grabbing Bob, so they might have a late respond time, he was sitting close to a chair that he could grab but that would require getting free of the hand on his neck first.
Cindy just stared at her looking for logic in the last statenent, but then remembered it was Wade,  and Betty was right.
"After all we've been through and I've gone through all the trouble of getting the legal document of making you my heir, you'd think he would introduce himself as more than my intern." a new voice calls out, the owner of the voice walking on the podium.
Peggy's next bout of teasing was cut off by a bright light that whisked those from the future back to their time.
"Come on Tony, he's not even doing anything, he just wants to meet Peter." Bruce, sweet innocent Bruce input from where he is watching all the drama.
They would need to have a public wedding with Media and influential figures later, but this... this is just for them and their family.
"Well, kind of? " Peter looked back at the man who was still under his comrade, "He works for AIM sometimes, mostly he's freelance though" he stops himself before he gives his father an aneurism.
"I can't just go up to him and ask,  Hey Tony is there any chance you might like fellas?" Steve says in a high falsetto voice.
"Peteeeeyyyyyyyy" the voice drawled and Peter shifted a little, barely opening one eye to look at the offender.
Tony was, ogling Steve as soon as they began sparring, Natasha was taking in both of their fighting styles,  Peter was sure she could take down all of the team without breaking a sweat.
He reached two names, one being dad with a wrench emoji and the other pops with the american flag he pressed to call the latter.
It ended with Sam and Tony finding the mother scorpion and destroying it with the Hulk's help. None of them were in the mood to do any kind of cooking, which resulted in getting takeout on their way home, The owner of the Italian place they went to seemed a little shell shocked, but put their (huge) order through.
"Well, those of you who don't know would get a nice surprise wouldn't they?" The man said good naturedly and the class grumbled about secretive parents.
"Yeah, we signed an NDA, you guys would probably get killed if you know" Cindy added, then bit her toung to not laugh at the horrified face of everyone.
"well, for starters, we came from the year 2018" the man next to the blue eyed blond says. he stood up and offered Peggy a hand to shake. She looked back and forth between the man and Steve.
"Captain! " the man in the eye patch calls him. He steadies himself. He can't lose composure now. After all, all good things to those who wait. And his star? His star is the best of all.
The group entered the room, Peter was not not even the least bit surprised when Alfred told them to look around and made a beeline for the Brit named Arthur.
"YES! Thank you Peter. There is a group waiting for a tour of the grounds, Amilia was supposed to give the tour, but that idiot apparently blew something up and I think she's in the medbays now. I would take over the tour, but I need to make sure she's OK, can you take over just until I get back?"
His saving grace was that his pops was also at those parties and looking as uncomfortable as he felt and His dad trying to get out with the two of them as soon as possible. Though he audibly gulped when some of them gave him a shark like smile so he must have done something right.
He didn't realise how fast his two hours of prep time went out. And before he even knew it the early comer parents  started to trickle in.
Me @ spiderman when he came to the tower through a window  and just laid down on the floor : why are you lying on the floor?
"Well you know how I had a field trip tomorrow? so I got Dad to sign the permission slip, but since the adoption isn't public knowledge yet, my teacher thought I forged the signature. And I don't think he likes me very much but any way he gave me a months detention. "
And the rest just follow his example, so when Tyler took a look at Wade's scarred AF face and when he announced he was pan as his fun fact at the beginning, he decided he found the perfect punching bag. And since Wade was supposed to keep his head down, he did not in fact bathe in his blood. Really. The things he does for love.
"Yes, I am Flash, we're in the building! You saw what happened until now, I'm dating  Wade for crying out loud, why is it that hard to believe?"
Ned spared his best friend A glance, Peter had his face buried in his hand. Wade was hugging him from behind. To stop him from interference or for moral support, Ned had no clue.
MJ was reading something on her phone most likely a book, Peter wasn't sure. Flash has been quiet since his initial outburst.  But Peter was pretty sure he would be back.
So yeah. Avengers tower. Exciting. For Wade at least cause Babyboy is here! And for the rest of the class too. He supposed.
They entered just in time to see the Avengers and one Deadpool laughing at something Peter said, Sam was pouting though and glaring at Clint while rubbing at his arm where a rubber tip of an arrow hit him.
Steve's heart does a loop de loop in his chest, so his three year plan is going to be set in motion. He leaves the bag to go to the mini fridge in there
No guards at all, none on the roof, none near the gate,  no guards at all. That made warning bells ring in his head. If he were thinking logically, he would have stopped, maybe slowed down, looked for a trap. As it were Steve's only goal was to reach his husband.
"Hey, pops, I'll just.....  go to my room..." he grabbed Wade and was about to walk out when he was stopped.
Wade I swear to god if you don't stop being self depracating in your Twitter handle I will eat all the chimmychingas.
So an absolutely terrible accident happened with the shield today. Somehow the Captain's hand slipped and the shield broke all the anti-homeless spikes on the sidewalks closer to SI. Truly a wonder of nature and physics.
"Good Morning Miss Jones, I was expecting you after school." Friday sounded slightly perked up as MJ scanned her own pass.
Come on, It's pretty obvious,  Tony Stark just came out as Bi like two and a half hour ago, who else could it be?
Peter thought he impressed the judges enough. At least, the head to toe black clothed dude didn’t find anything to say against him before they left, but he didn't say anything at all so....
"I didn’t even see anything! You shouldn’t be mad at me! Even if you are not any more than normal. We're fine!"
The people in the room were staring at them as they were trying to figure out what was even going on.
Alice narrowed her eyes at Mr. Collins, "you know what Peter, Maybe you shouldn't lead this tour..." But Peter cut her off,
She saw Cindy, then looked towards the group, processed it and just felt like crawling in a grave and staying there, the one time the surprise field trip is at a not boring place, and It's her office.  Freaking peachy.
"He met you three times and fainted twice, but, I do get what you mean." Steve took out a water bottle and handed it to Thor
Alfred opened the doors and they entered. Peter was one of the last people that got in. Of course, he promptly froze when he did get in the room though.
"If it helps Mr. Rogers-Stark, Bob refused to take part in the kidnapping after he figured out they were going to kidnap Peter." Ned pointed out helpfully.
"You're way to obsessed with his genitalia to not have a crush" Michelle walks in from nowhere startling him.
"I don't care who your boyfriend is, you're coming with us." Mr. Yelli says like he  was absolutely not afraid of who Peter's boyfriend is, Peter could probably call Wade off from killing the guy,....... Probably.  But he can't really make any promises after that.
"Listen kid I don't know who you think your parents are, but I am a police officer. You can't do shit about me kicking the stupid fairy out" Mr. Thompson growled into his face.
After all, It's not new to have his husband kidnapped. They've practically all been kidnapped at one point or another in their line of work. If anyone other than those who know him well were to look at him, they'd see him keeping his calm and being a good soldier.
"That was when May was in comfort therapy. She finished the paperwork with Mr. Rogers-Stark then to get Peter adopted. After Peter...... You know, then Mrs. Romanova-Potts said he should get some training as the heir of the company.  He was so shocked to know he was the heir. Then Mr. Stark figured out I was the one who hacked the suit that one time in the Vilture incident and he wanted to hire me, and Mr. Odinson-Banner thought he could use a computer expert.  And I don't know what blackmagic Mrs. Romanova-Potts and MJ did, but they communicated, and she thought MJ should be her intern."
Peter finished another mini lecture by the time they reached the lab. When they did enter the Lab though, Peter froze for the second time that morning.
Peggy frowned hearing her friend. She looked towards the people from the future to see them all frown at Howard too.... Bar Tony whose only reaction is an eye roll and a sigh.
Peter went out of the class with Ned and MJ glad to have them in his last classes too. He was about to open his locker again when he caught sight of what looked like a familiar hoodie.
"Yes and he also kinda has all the Avengers wrapped around his fingers, -so I don't think you're in a very favourable position right now, especially with Loki and Widow in the same room. " Flash gulped and finally looked around at the other Avengers....... They did not look happy at all.
"And I assume the Robot has been field tested?" the black clad judge asked narrowing his eyes. The red headed man looked at the other judge with a scowl.
"I'm sure he is." he grunts not lookin up from his formula, trying to work out how best to make his web conductive.  It'd probably be easier when Shuri sends him the Vibranium she promised.
Peter, however was violently reminded that Flash was going in the tower, which means that if any of the avengers get news of him doing anything remotely wrong, they're gonna be there, which is bad news for Flash, and the person at the PR who thought they could withhold worrying about the news of Peter's adoption till next month
"as impressive as that is, I have to share that you two are also the worst at noticing your own feelings for each other, and even worse at figuring out the other's feeling for yourself.
And that is how Peter found himself on the tour bus of Midtown High waiting to go on a tour to the building  that he lives in as though he didn't help with the newer updates designs.
"Is this the kid you thought didn’t have an internship or whatever?" Tony waved a hand towards Peter, looking at Eleanor .
And he is healed completely, he has super healing thank you very much, but super healing does absolutely nothing to prevent the overdrive of senses always out to get him. He hopes that he would be able to have a mostly quiet day.
"yes, let's have a talk later, a loooong talk well invite the principal and some lawyers too, nice small party." Mr. Tritter gulped and looked about ready to pass out.
"Hey! He's not that insane! He just likes to talk to the boxes sometimes" Peter crossed his arms defensively.
"And you, kid," he turned to address Flash, "Peter is no longer counted as an intern because he is the heir of this company, and I hope you weren't planning on working here, because that won't happen."
"Dr. Technus how the heck did you manage to blow up your equipment? " Danny asks looking pissed as he and Cindy extinguish the last of the flames.
The man's eyes focus on Ned when the rest of the class is too busy mumbling "Holy shit that's Bruce flipping Banner."
If half an hour after the snack break his entire class gets thrown out of the building well, that's no one's business but theirs. And if someone got Fury to pull him from East-West to go to a school closer to Midtown…. Well, it seems he was growing on the in-laws.
The creature doesn't reply this time, merely smiles, the angelic quality to the smile makes him nauseous.
"Do you know how many employees work at SI? the avengers don't have time to get to know every scientist,  let alone intern, how are you planning on using them to expose my so called lie anyway?"
He was of course fine in day one but he was not allowed to go to school or patrol for at least two days to make sure he " didn't keep giving his old men repeated heart attacks, do you hear me young man?" He struck a hard bargain with Tony to let Deadpool in the tower. And due to him being "injured" even got both Tony and Wade to play nice.
Peter looked at Ned who shrugged helplessly back, you don't mess with a princess in warpath, especially if the princess in question is an expert in weapons technology.
Peter supposed the positive media from back then helped with mellowing things out with their coming out tomorrow. The public has been as sick of their will they won't they as the avengers and Peter was.
"Is he still going on with the intern thing? I thought Pepper cleared that out?" Steve asked looking at his husband.
"I was hungry! And I desired the frozen treat. I do not believe it demerital to watch classics like the fault in our stars! T'was a heart wrenching masterpiece." he decidedly does not pout, again despite what his brother would say.
Peter sighed, his father was the definition of Extra™ and he watched Yuri on Ice, he knows what Extra is.
Oh shut up @ Akemi, not everyone is gay, and It's frankly disgusting to project your thoughts onto someone else
"Do not. Mess. This. Up or so help me Odin I will release blackmails you don't even remember existed." he hissed and left.
"That's Vision, he's..... an AI but he has a body. And I'm Peter. " he says. Peggy raises an eyebrow at the robo man,
"Woah, woah woah dude, calm down you're looking for me, let him go" Peter almost stands, but then thinks better of it.
If Peter didn’t have sensitive hearing, he might not have picked up on his fathers approaching them. But he does have super hearing so he did hear his fathers approach him.
"Mini boss, could you make an appearance and give a speech at a tour today? I'm trying to fit it in Boss's schedule but it is not fitting unless it cuts into something. " Friday informed. Peter grew uneasy at the thought of a speech.
There is nothing to speculate, We've been banging for the better part of the month and It's amazing.
Thankfully they didn’t have any other interruptions. And the tour was actually pretty enjoyable, and they went to some parts of the buildings Cindy didn’t go to often, so she realised what happens there.
"I mean, his hair looks golden enough, he's a morning person, his eyes look like the sky so he obviously has some reverse sky and sun art thing going"
"Hey Dad, pops, I was looking for you, about the gaming system upgrade, and I thought we could......  Why are you looking at me like that?"
"Dearly beloved, we're gathered here now to let go of our frustration of about five years when these idiots were lost in pine city and complain about  them-" The boy began earning an eye roll from his father, and a sheepish smile from his new stepfather. Natasha raised her glass in a silent agreement.
"We're here for the ten am tour? We're from Midtown. It's under Effie Trinket?" Ms. Trinket says cheerfully.
The remaining team members thanked Bruce before going back to the movie, now able to focus on the plot.
"No no no let's go back to 'that boy’ We all want to hear all about him" Sgt. Barnes said with a hard look arms crossed in a threatening manner.
Hoo, boy he's the sweetest thing in the universe let me tell you, muchos adorable, and all around amazing boyfriend.
"You....lost... The page?" Steve did not know how to feel, there is literally only Tony's pictures in the sketchbook.
He must've been close enough for Tony to hear him because suddenly the other man looked up and beamed at him,
"Be prepared tomorrow, I have a feeling you'll be called to the principal if Tony has anything to say about it." she says as though Peter didn't interrupt her.
"STAY THE FUCK OUT OF MY BUILDING DEADPOOL, JUST BECAUSE FURY LET YOU IN SHIELD DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO COME IN THE TOWER." Peter heard his dad scream from where he was running behind Wade with his gauntlets on to blast him.
"- how does that work?? I may be the only human in the Avenger scientist  but I'm still a friggin avenger! How the hell did those mines be enough of an incentive to take a risk like that! And not to mention you basically handed me a way out and expect me to what? Stay put? What kind of dumbass logic-"
Betty was hyperfocusing on her sales pitches and had not looked up from her laptop for the last two hours.
"No he is not, he's gonna finish his homework, then go to patrol then come back in two hours tell us if anything needs be done that he saw in his petrol, eat an early dinner then Go.To. Sleep." Peter smiled bashfully at Clint.
"Everyone get to the corner near the door now!" he exclaimed but was unheard. The students bar Ned and MJ were all cowering against the wall farthest from the door that is where they would aim first.
There were perks in travelling with your billionaire bestfriend, for instance, they could get you any tea you wanted in their privet jets.
"You love it." Tony says then receives the call he was getting about buying and dissolving the Keaton company.
"Stark. Don't go walking into businesses that aren’t yours. I'm having a talk with this brat here and nothing more."
"Uncle Clint, I'm not a genius!!! " everyone in the room seemed to give 'pete' a flat look even the robot who didn't have much in terms of different facial features.
"Did you just call him Penis Parker?" Rhodes threateningly asked him. The boy looked terrified. A tiny vindictive voice in his head told Peter that he should let this happen, that Flash deserved this. Unsurprisingly, that voice sounded a lot like Wade.
"Um.... I'm not sure? Mary is kinda too advanced to be shown in a science fair." he says thinking about his robot that is designed to act as a red cross paramedic.
He had to do something about Mr. Thompson first though, because it looked like he's about to make a scene.
Everyone is tense in the quinjet. Not that Peter could blame anyone,  he hiself was taut as a tightrope.
"Hey Pete, Mario cart tournament you in?" Clint asks as soon as he steps inside the communal living room. before he could say anything, Steve interrupts him.
The silence between them is pleasant as Steve draws and Tony watches. He wishes they could spend more time together like this, maybe one day Tony would lean onto him as he draws, maybe he'd get to kiss the other man on the head.
"So, then I told her that she can't use her fucking powers in training, and in the next round of combat she shot me, which, hurts like a bitch, but at least she didn't use her powers......" Deadpool rambled on all their way to the next destination, which Friday provided was a lower level avengers gym.
"Besides, he says that he was adopted after his aunt died, but really who would want him? He's probably homeless now." Flash continued because he has the self preservation skills of a moth near a candle.
Both the women of the group had red hair one had green eyes and the other blue eyes. Both looked dangerous but not poised to attack.
Peter frowned and looked at his class and remembered if anyone could be targeted. There were some kids from rich families,  but if they came for them they were going to take them alive for ransom, There was Flash who could be the target since his father is a police officer, but he doubts it, so that leaves him. Adopted son of two Avengers, and his two friends interns to Pepper Romanova-Potts and Bruce Odinson-Banner.
They don't get off on the right foot. That's ok though. He got to see the fire in his Star's eye. And not just from afar. It was directed at him.
: 'ned mj and peter  are already taking their college courses on line, do you have the ability to do that with the job and high school?'
"Hello? Am i talking to Peter's stepfather? " Mr. Steward asked getting over the shock of familiarity of the voice.
"Well, OK then, oh, Pete can't  give you a security  pass in that  case, or Ned or MJ. " Alfred  says and gives the rest of the group guest level passes.
"Hey, Wade, mind letting me walk?" Peter managed to say even though he didn't look particularly bothered by being smushed against the merch -if his grin was anything to go by-
"Did you see the magazines? " he asks them dramatically. She could never decern if he was ever actually serious or being dramatic for the drama.
"Come along kids! We don't have time to dawdle.  We need to get moving! " she hearded them towards the receptionist area,
Peter, who had his face in his palms for the last fifteen minutes groaned. Forget what he said before. He does not love his parents. At all. They're the most embarrassing fathers in the history of ever.
Friday lets them in with minimal fanfare. Peter relaxes a little then frowns. He knows there is going some kind of drama going on, and if it isn’t now he wonders when they would show up.
The downside to travelling with a billionaire bestfriend, especially Tony Stark is that the man is -pardon his language - a nosy fuck.
There was a pause where Tony mulled over what Peter said.  He wasn’t team mom no matter what Clint says, which reminds him, he needed to add oreos to the grocery list or there would probably be bloodshed and..........
My only question is, What did I ever do to make you think that I'm straight?  How do I stop it? I'm bi ffs
"It has been a while since I've been summoned by a human. " the creature's voice was soothing, like an old friend,Howard jolted with the realization that every part of the demon is made to entice.
" Deadpool!  What are you doing here?" Betty asks, nervous about the class behind her. The class that immediately broke out in murmurs as soon as they saw him.
My favourite person? Definitely  @ S Industries. He's one of the kindest people in the room. Not to mention extremely smart, the  Kid's just too good for this world.
: 'Ned is coding robots for cleaning entire rivers in a matter of days. What exactly have you done?'
"Ok, I'm not someone who would stop you from showing off, but It's not really your style. " Tony says in that tone he uses when he means, i want to know what's going on with your life, but I'm not gonna push you about it.
They're not Knock offs and Shuri insisted on giving him the komoyo bead. But he doesn't think pointing  that out would help his case.
"Why, do you think it takes an entire month for these- conferances to finish up." Thor says as he dodges a punch from Steve.
His fathers were late, he could hope that they were just letting it go, maybe one of them decided at the last minute that they weren’t ready to tell the world about their relationship or Peter.
"You did kinda just adopt everyone. And then proceeded to act like a mother, 'sides, I think everyone likes having you as team mom." he begins another sketch of times square this time.
"why didn't you tell us?" Flash demands. MJ scoffs, closes her book then promptly slaps Flash across the face.
"There's this kid 'ere,  goes everyday to the Avenger's Tower. Who's the kid" the man says sounding calm.
The tour guide they got was called Shana. She was enthusiastic but also wobbling on her feet. Wade recognized the look from Peter she was right on the precipice of going in a caffeine crash and possibly passing out. She was nice about explaining things though so Wade decided to keep an eye on her and catch her if she falls.
Tony frowned when the teacher told them to be quiet, the other kid in the corner was obviously making much more noise. Heck, Peter didn't even say a word.
"Well, that trip is happening tomorrow, and I took the permission slip, and dad signed it, but our teacher Mr. Collins said, 'Peter your lie about the internship has gone far enough as it is. You could fall in serious trouble if it goes on record, and after that you forge Mr. Rogers-Stark's signature?'" Peter takes a breath to calm himself not looking at Steve.
"Yes sir? " don't ask Peter how his AI managed to sound mischievous but that's exactly what she did.
"Here's an idea, How about we have a family night? we'll get up late, get the training done, then just.... hang out, all of us. " Steve proposed.
He didn’t know how long he  stood there, unmoving, barely breathing when there was a tug on his arm he looked down  to see a red and black gloved hand tugging him insistently.
"Hello, Midtown high, I'll  be taking over your tour from here,  our tour guide Mr. Fei long has something urgent that he needs to take care of. Oh, hey Ned. " he greeted.
"Because that's what you get for betraying me and not coming to the trip to suffer. " Cindy informed her gleefully.
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise. How does this phrase come in if the man in question never went to bed in the first place?
I almost had a sensory overload from all the standing around an TALKING. also some of the old people were creeps.
"And, why-" Tony's voice was deceptively calm "did you call him penis, when his name is clearly Peter?" OK, then, it's time to give his fathers a speech about how it's illegal to kill teenagers.
Betty ran towards Cindy and nearly knocked into the girl, pulled her a few feet away from the crowd to make sure they weren’t overheard.
Tony sighed and stretched walking in the room. it was hard, but he made a couple of upgrades to one of his suits and Natasha's widow's bites. He promised Peter that he would let him help with Clint's arrows. Tony was waiting for the boy to get home so they could get started.
He wanted to see the light leave Howard's eyes when he realised the man he trusted, the man he spend so long torturing his precious Star for was a demon.
She moves to the questioning room where they're being held. logically she knew it was a terrible idea to keep them all together, and she doesn't usually do the illogical thing, but some how she thinks it would be best. (Which is the author's way of saying she really didn't want to write them in separate rooms and also is feeling very very lazy)
Ned looked positively elated, "Hi Wade. Peter we need to go to next cl- " Ned was cut off by an announcement
"Actually they were gonna join the earthlings in Trondheim vikinlag. What they wanted was the royal family to be there. " she says and Thor gets the distinct feeling that he's missing something.
Ok but are some of the Avengers actually gay?  I mean everyone knows about Stark, but is there anyone else?
He was just about to relax when he -unfortunately- saw someone else walking towards him. Damn it why is Harrison Thompson walking towards his stall?
"Oh oops" Ned looked around sheepishly "But still man it is kind of a stupid conclusion. " he justified.
"Well your buddy should have the courage to come see his lie unfold then shouldn't he?" Flash shoved Ned.
Oh my god, I cant believe the Avengers let someone like @ widow fight with them, I don't need someone like her saving my life.
"Kid, you came with us the last five missions, there's nothing small scale about you." the robot (she really needs to stop calling him that) says reassuringly.
Peter snorted, "He's allowed in.....for now, I don't know how long till dad has another blow up about him." Ned nods in understanding the two exist the school where Ned goes home and Peter gets in the car with Happy. Peter started chattering and the man rolled his eyes, the kid may or may not have grown on him, but he's not gonna tell him that.
Even then he already knew what Ms. Lanister was talking about in this lesson, something about some sort of fungi. He wasn't really paying attention.
"Hey!" Tony poked his cheek. "I'll have you know the other guy is a sensitive person, and you're gonna hurt his feelings."
"Well, this has been informative, but we gotta go, see you later teachers." his Dad said with a smile dripping saccharine.
"Uh, royal consort? Do they mean Brunnhilde? I didn't know you guys were dating? " Bruce's vice comes out slightly strangled.
"I am not the team's collective mother right Cap?" was what Steve was greeted with when Tony burst into his room without knocking.
But his head was slightly unclear from thinking about May and he doesn't show it but he is slightly pissed. And Mr. Stewart had his hand out expectantly for his phone so Peter went up to the front of the club and handed him the phone. If that's how his teacher wanted to play it then so be it.
*A video of different clips of steve taken from various news and pictures with the music of I need a hero*
Betty ignored the shocked faces of their class mates and threw a shit eating grin her way before launching into her usual tirade for the tours that come in the SI.
"Of course you’re not just going to walk home kid, you could get into more trouble and besides you just had to go through nearly being kidnapped. I'm not gonna let you just walk out right now without adult supervision! "
Betty and Cindy rolled their eyes and gave up on saving her, she probably won't learn any other way.
The nurse that left him on the cot had to hurry back to help the others with Maria. It was like no one gave a second glance at the beautiful little boy.
"Flash if you're going to call someone a bad bitch, you should say the full title, not everyone's title works broken down. For instance, you're a dumbass, but you could also be called both Dumb and Ass" Ned quipped getting a small lip twitch from MJ. he calls that a win.
"Bullying records going as far back as freshman year,  five physical injuries in the past two months, regular verbal abuse, and a few attacks against his friends also." Friday chirped.
"No, dude, I'm out, I'm not just gonna stand here waiting for Deadpool to come and beat my ass" Bob says and tries to walk out.  Peter hears a faind murmur of "deadpool??! Behind him, but chooses to ignore it.
"Fine. But you’re ok with this right? I mean if you're uncomfortable I could get them to stop." Tony says as he takes a seat next to Steve looking at him worriedly.
"Hey yourself." his voice was wobbly and he was distantly aware of a Peter colored blur going towards his husband and clinging to him like a koala bear.
When he reached his locker along with MJ hoping to catch Ned, he didn't find him. They decided to wait for him since they had the next class together.
The girls exchange a look at the name, who names their child Fishlegs.  The man nods and smiles towards them,
"HEY PENIS DON'T YOU WANT TO EVEN MEET THE NEW KID?" Flash yelled across the hall. Peter winced and hoped the new kid -whoever they may be- didn't become Flash's new punching bag.
It was a normal day in S.H.I.E.L.D  headquarters. Director Carter was signing some paper works, Howard Stark made another failed attempt at finding Captain America.
"Peter! it's refreshing to see you use the front door every once in a while. " Friday quipped and Peter blushed slightly at Alfred and his friends snickering. Ms. Terry however has been going slightly more red each minute of the ordeal.
Reaching the food court, Peter left the Class to their own devices and telling them that they had to leave in half and hour or so. He was very ready for the day to be over. Peter grabbed Ned and MJ, (he didn't have to look to know that Wade would be following) and chose a table. So of course, most of his class had to choose that table as well. He even saw Flash sulking at the corner furthest from him.
"Uh, no, I do not encourage teenage vigilantism, I only help because the teenage vigilantly would go off by himself if I don't help him."
: Ryner apparently since the day Peter handed in his paperwork Harrington wasn't there so he gave it to Ryner.
The avengers nod and agree, and if Peter gets more doted on for the next few days It's no one's bussiness but theirs.
"Eleanor?....  Guys???? Oh uh Betty!  Hi - um what  are - what are you all doing here?" Ned's voice reached a new kind of high, Cindy was impressed actually.
"Well, he's taking a day off for starters, also Nat could you check with the others? Everyone better be nice to him tomorrow . We could have a family day. Heck, I'll even throw in the Red and Black asshole if it makes him feel better."
"Miss Alice is more likely to arrive there." Somehow Friday's voice sounded more.... Airy? Peter shook his head. The AI has been programmed to show sass.
"Class,  we're going on a field trip tomorrow." Ms. Terry announced, and then waited for the class to calm down.
Peter started calling the rest of the Avengers uncles and Natasha Aunt about a year ago when he was adopted. Wanda let him off because She's more of an older sister than anything,  he didn’t even realize he was exempt from being called uncle since it seemed natural for Peter not to.
: anyway Captain America and Iron Man is currently tearing into Ryner now. Ned and Mj are in a group hug with Peter.
The two of them took a minute to just,, take it in.  They're going to work here! They're going to work here,  in this huge architectural marvel with some of the greatest minds in the planet.
When Peter, MJ and Ned were the last three without security passes Sara gave them an apologetic glance,
Bruce tilted his head challengingly, "you sure you wanna go on that lane Tony, because I will not hesitate -"
"You're all here? Why are you all here? Uncle Clint did you tell them?" Peter panicked , looking around to find an exit for Flash. There was none, oh boy.
Betty and her made eye contact from where she was reading over her shoulder  (she knew Cindy talked to MJ, she just didn’t need to know it was to get her and Ned together)
"Alright follow me." she takes them to the receptionist area where five people were answering calls left and right and two of them were typing something on their computers. "
He hoped his dad was alone in a room and didn’t call anyone else. But well, he also hoped his dad wouldn’t blow a gasked so clearly he was hoping for too much.
"Listen, whatever your name is, even if you really did adopt Peter, don't encourage his lie about the internship at Stark industries. " Mr. Stewart sighed.
She shook her head and looked around, nearly all her her classmated looked ready for death. Well thats what happens after marathons in a school of nerds.
"Yes, but she checks out all the necessity for the fair. Which is basically just made without anyone's help, and able to help the world in some way."
Peter sighes and from where he is next to him, Steve notices, "Hey, Pete, what's up? You've been quiet for a while." Steve points out using what some of the less mature avengers has named his Concerned Mother™ voice. (the more mature Avengers don't call it that at all. What are you talking about? Shut up Clint.)
Peter went to take a look, that blew up in his face, and he had to stop the man from making yet another machine that..... Peter doesn't remember what it does, but it must have been something threatening.
He thought he had beaten it. He thought the demon forgot about a measly deal. Maybe even the demon hadn't cared enough to collect the boy.
He twists the hand to hold it against the guys back and used his other hand to grab him in a chokehold till he passed out then he immediately let him go and dropped him to the floor.
"'Eugene Flash Thompson' not that bright a kid, it's not a big loss that he won't get in any good college, or get a good job"
"Call him names? Push him in the hallways? You know regular bully stuff."  Betty shruggs no noticing Ned and Peter's twin winces and MJ's smirk.
"I can't give a speech, if dad's gonna be there, he can handle the speech thing right? I'll just hang around in the background." Peter said.
a card but between having to hand it over since he was banned and not banned and the sneaking in and running for his life (being chased by certain repulsor wearing people) time to time, at this point F.R.I.D.A.Y just has him scanned by biometrics and informs him whether he's banned currently  since no one could be bothered remembering if he should have the badge currently or not.
"Your pitch is gonna go to the upper levels to be accepted or rejected so I'd recommend making more than one . "
But anyway ever since Peter said that he has an internship to SI, and Flash shot him down, no one actually believed the boy. It wouldn’t matter much if it was just that, but Flash has made it his personal mission to bother the other boy he even has his friends in on it.
"What are you talking about? Peter's....." He couldn't finish whatever he was about to say as Peter cut him off.
When he went to school the next day he realised that he underestimated exactly how worn and old his old clothes were..... That and how different they were from designer clothes.
Peter thought about what to do the whole day. His family probably let him sleep in because he was running on Wakandian time. But now that he was up, and everyone was probably busy.......... He could always go on a Patrol, or he could go to his lab to work on the new web formula, he could probably find some of the avengers in the gym though.
Peter rolled his eyes, " just, yesterday you were talking about how poor I was? What did I pay her with Flash?" Peter checked to see if everyone had a pass and began to heard them to the avengers exhibition, while simultaniously reciting the history of Stark industries .
"Yes, glad you know me, but why are you calling Ned names you son of a trash can?" MJ raised an eyebrow.
"Hey Leeds, where's your intern buddy now, too scared to show his face here?" Flash nudged for the umpteenth time that day. Ned sighed for the umpteenth time that day.
Right now he got a call from Mr. Keaton. The guy gave him heebeejeebies, and not only because he kinda looks like Tooms (But that definitely plays a major role in the dislike.)
"Peter, you're an excellent student and all that, but you can't keep lying about having an internship in such a prestigious place." he was about to say something more but was cut off by Flash.
Wade frowned at the ceiling as Peter shot him a look. He would never understand Wade's choices in nicknames.
"That was Ned saving your life, you are now forever indebted to him, and can only repay him by being his servant for the rest of your high school life." MJ replied.
"Sure, I have to go to a meeting wjth my team, but leave it on my desk later." Mami shrugged and left.
What Peter didn't notice was Shuri quickly telling Friday to sent the security footage with the audio to every avenger in the building. If that woman thinks tgat she can  mess with Peter,  well... she's not a Princess for nothing.
"That's a slight to our contract isn't it? Since Tony is mine, you had no right to hurt him as you did now did you. No one else has a right to anything to do with my star. And It's such a shame that you're the one who violated the deal, considering you're the one who made the deal. "
"Hey, babe, it's one of Peter's teachers."  Peter heard Steve's phone switching to speakerphone  and another very very familiar voice floated in.
Everytime he hears Tony is in danger, or got injured in battle or even just threw himself at danger like the self sacrificing idiotic genius that he is Steve feels like there's a steel trap constricting his heart.
"Boss has left the lab approximately one hour ago to get refreshments.  He left the tower forty-five minutes ago " Steve pauses as his heart speeds up.
Turnes out it really was to knock me out since the guy fell asleep instantly but we were still going and I tried to stop the car but it hit a Fire hydrant before I got to the brakes. "
The Avengers are holding a press conference tomorrow at ten. We have been informed that is of extreme importance.
"Bruce, bruce, you are, one of the most brilliant people I know, how many could even do half the things you could do? And I don't know how to make you believe but you are beautiful. You are possibly the most beautiful person I have ever had the pleasure to meet. And I love that Hulk makes you stronger. I love everything about you Bruce and I am in love with you."
"I'm here to talk to you Eleanor " he answers playing with a small knife he seemed to bring out of nowhere.
Peter wasn't paying attention, if he had been, his eyes would be wide as sausers. As it is, he was pulled to attention from Wade's absurd amount of emojis by two voices laughing. Peter looked up, and now his eyes /were/ wide as sausers.
"Sorry, I thought everyone knew though?" Peter says unsurely. Steve took a bottle out sending a pointed look to Natasha.
"Apparently MCU did something worse, I Don't know." he paused and remembers why they were talknig about that in the first place. "Besides, he's a sweetheart " he added.
Betty and Cindy had the Level three badges that are customary for interns. (Ned and Peter tweaked it a little so they can go to Peter's floor. And yes she realises how ridiculous it is to have a floor even though Peter doesn’t spend time there other than when Cindy, Betty, Ned and MJ visits.)
"WHAT THE FUCK PARKER?!?!" the scream in a familiar and unwelcome voice startled Peter from his phone. He looked at the tour group and actually took on the fact the people there seemed to be in his class..... a tour.... to his class. Peter felt a headache coming.
The demon leaned his head, "Of course I can, but can you pay for the deed?" It really is the smile that is the most unsettling part of the demon.
She quickly steals a glance at Steve to make sure that was ok, he was smiling besottedly at Tony,  huh, Steve and Tony. She smirked, they're a nice match.
"Oh my god I love you so much" Tony breathes out, and to Steve it felt like a great weight lifted off his head.
It has come to my attention that for the last month, there has been a lot of speculations as to weather or not Steve Rogers and I have been engaged in a relationship.
MJ snorted and brought them all back to reality, "good luck leading the tour loser." She said in true MJ fashion that made everyone jerk their head towards Peter the boy sighed, this is gonna be a looong day.
Peter tuned out everything else knowing that his family was watching intensely and this training was mostly for him to be able to focus all his attention despite the vibrations coming from all directions.
"And here we have an example of a supersoldier, his idea of a lazy day in has training in it." Tony snarked. Peter agreed.
Peter finished just as he heard the noise of a quinjet engine on top of the building,  oh so that was the engine he heard.
The point he's trying to make with this; there is, under no circumstances any way that their shithole of a school met any requirements that are needed to tour the SI tower. And he would know, he goes there every weekend and he got banned from at least half the labs.
"Wait...... Are you,  flirting with me?" he asks sounding more surprised than he should have been based on what Betty and Cindy heard.
"Sometimes, maybe letting go is the best you could do. " he whispers. And Tony goes boneless against him. He looks defeated. Steve doesn't like that look on Tony.
See they've been pestering him about his choice in clothing a few months since he moved in. After his dad adopted him, aunt Pepper has been adamant about him looking the part of billionaire's son and prodigy and heir and a bunch of other things. He's been avoiding going shopping for a while (he likes those pun shirts OK?)
Everyone was sitting down to gather their breath except for Flash because he likes to think he's macho or something.
"Alright, since no one will probably pay attention to anything in this room anyway, how about we move to the next section, which is...." She was cut off by another frazzled looking intern walking towards them,
"Ok, but who are you? I didn't really catch your name " he says pointing at the short man with a goatee.
"like I said, an error." Cindy could practically hear Danny grit his teeth. And decides to intervene
He was frozen for a different reason though, next to the stove, a young man clad in red and black was whistling to a tune and flipping pancakes.
"Hah! Bet Penis Parker knew where we were going and that's why he didn’t come to School for a month.  "
Tony cried in secret when he heard about his mother, he clenched his teeth when he heard about Howard.
"Peter, Alice seems to be coming back, would you like to go upstairs with the team?" Friday asked and the rest of the team looked towards him expectantly,
The tour group reaches one of the more higher level labs they will see. And while Ned would have probably frozen in shock about the whole thing in the past, He. Is. Bored. don't get him wrong, the lab is cool, but it's... actually one of the lower accessed labs he goes in.
"Aren't you the one who always tells me to have fun? Well this is me, having fun...... And showing off." he amends at Tony's raised eyebrow.
Petey leads them to the cafeteria about an hour into the tour citing a small break for snacks. He shows them to a table then heads off to get his own food.
"Holy shit is that the Hulk?" Eleanor says. Betty frowns and looks behind her to see Dr. Odinson-Banner talking to a few scientists.
Peter smiles. They are adorable when they’re getting along. He hears a slight squeal a little of to the side.
But Wade will not blow up. He won't, because the school might be shady but it was the perfect kind of place for someone of his track record to be , what was the Pirate king called it? Rehabilitated. So yeah, school may be shady as fuck but no one questions a transfer senior or the fact that he looked like a walkng acne culture. Well they question, just not in the
Bruce was treated to one of the rare Tony Stark real smile that was saved for people he really cared about.
They were halfway through the line and Flash was about to scan his pass when a car stops in front of the entrance . And from the car emerged the legend Pepper Romanova-Potts herself. She was one of the few residents in the Avengers tower who is still badass even after getting to know them.
Oh well. He looked around the room wondering if he should have done something special to surprise Pete. He glanced down Peter did usually like it if he felt like he didn't have to hide his face in public but he also preferred Wade to not be uncomfortable so the hoodie stays and so does the facemask. While he was checking himself, the group began to move, following someone dwarfed by the dicks. He follows the group into another room while debating with yellow.
He hoped his star wasn't expecting more, he couldn't forgive Howard for all he put his Star through.
"Flash!" the boy heard a call from a familiar voice. He turned around to see the other boy approach. Not knowing what to expect. Maybe Mr. Stark changed his mind and send him to tell him that?
"What are you talking about? Peter left his work to help me with this tour since I have to be away for a while, if anything, I'm bothering him." Mr.Collins looked shocked as did the rest of the class, bar of course Ned and MJ.
"The density in oba- uh, this dummy is the same as human flest so It's more or less accurate. Of course, nothing can actually stimulate the emergency of a field surgery, but this is the closest thing " he shrugged and stabbed the pen in Obadiah-mandarin-skull's chest.
"Ok, to be absolutely fair, Pepper was considering your school simply based on merits I just bumped it up."
Ned snickered and went back to his coding. But only for a while before he saw Clint and Sam running as though their life depended on it.
(Black widow would make the list but she face planted while staring at Pepper one too many times to count.)
"And the guy I talked to brings out a gun and he was trying to point it at me but it was pretty awkward since he was in the passenger seat and I was right behind him and he let out a warning shot "
"Ok, so maybe I am that bad" Tony conceded, because, really, why would Pepper be wrong? ever? Peter went back to listening to her lecture)
Behind her however another girl walked in. She, like Pepper, had coffee and her phone and she also had sunglasses looking cooler then normal. Ned smirked. MJ looked like the walking personification of the five minutes late with Starbucks Meme.
"uh- well, i-uh" Flash really didn't have any defence for himself, but he looks damn well about to cry.
"It's just" Peter sighs. "I've been handling Flash, and he's been targeting me since freshman year, but he's starting to bother Ned and MJ now. And some other kids too, so it's not like me being his main target is helping anyone."
"That's ok, let's go to the reception and call from there. " she said and got up prompting Peter to follow.
"Come on Peter, where's the fun in that? Besides, inspirational is tall blond and patriotic's job." Rhody piped in.
"Shouldn't you have been? It is a once in a lifetime opportunity." Jessie says from his other side. He looks around to see that they were trying to corner him.
Peter knew without Wade there, he would be swarmed by questioning peers, and of course a seething Flash. (Peter decided the best part of the day was seeing the life leaving Flash's eyes when he met Wade). He knew that wouldn't stay though, Peter'd probably have to answer a gazilion questions when he got back to school the next day. He grimaced at the thought.
It had the hight and measures of Obadiah Stane, his face looked like what Peter had seen in the picture as Aldrich Killian only fatter, and the dummy was bald and red. It's his aunt's favourite dummy to shoot at so there's plenty of bullet holes.
I wouldn’t call it making out, it was more like an attempt to suck eachothers soul out through their mouth.
He enjoyed the shock and terrified look in the man's eye, in fact, he would probably look back at this moment at bad days.
Said person didn't notice him yet. Which was good as Peter slowly sneaked behind him. He could just tap his shoulder or something and not make a scene. But the entire day has been dramatic for him anyway so he promptly full body tackles the other boy.
"So anyway I knocked it out of his hand and he tried to punch me.  And I caught his hand and grabbed it in a hold but I think I held it too tight and it might be broken but it could be just held at the wrong angle so - "
: so the two highest scoring classes in bio scored a Field Trip. And I'll tell you before if I can see one of Peter's ramblings about his boyfriend.
It's probably gonna destroy my reputation as a stone cold bitch, but idgaf.  I have met @ S Industries in person only once, but if anything happened to him, I will kill everyone in the world and then myself.
Flash found a tall burly looking man and began walking next to him. Peter recognised the guy from the police. He was Flash's dad? No wonder Flash had a bad attitude.
"Steve! Pete! Hey there!" he says as though they just happened to meet on someplace by chance and Steve hadn’t been ready to yank his his hair out for the last few hours.
Flash, who has managed to convince everyone that the girl they saw before couldn't possibly be MJ, and they all saw wrong, tilts his head,
But Peter reserves the right to claim that everything that went wrong this time  is entirely his aunts fault.
He sighed and left the class, he wondered how to tell this to his fathers and not have them coming in his school repulsours ablaze and demand an apology.
Ned pats his back from beside him, but he can tell he was trying to stifle his laughter.  MJ shows him no such courtesy. The girl snickers freely behind him.
Flash's father's eyes widen realising he has been beaten he doesnt put up much of a fight. Peter sighs.
"MJ? What'd she do?" Betty frowns when Mami just hands her a coppy of The Vogue,  she turns to the front page and then her eyes widens, "You're kidding me?"
"Come on now Pete let's have a long nice chat about all the things you forgot to tell us about your school."
(Heaven forbid Peter call him anything but Dad or any of the Avengers Mr. or Ms. something, they'll think their little spider got hit in the head and got amnesia, then somehow the blame would fall on Wade and tony will drop him from Floor 90 again and Natasha will proceed to chase him across the city with various threats of murder and torture all the while the rest of the Avengers doted on Peter
He sees a frazzled looking intern checking security passes and her tablet. there must be a tour of the ground today. Peter nods at her and walks out to the place where he usually goes to get snacks for his and his dads invention binges.
"Hi Peter,  your life is doomed anyway,  now are you putting Mary in or not" MJ says not looking up from her skech, which looked suspiciously like Flash in a guillotine.
But the fact of the matter is that they're not just their interns, they're practically family - literally in Peter's case - and the Avengers, as heroic as they are, ...... Are embarrassing.
"It's a chance, not a blessing, besides, I'd better keep him where I can keep tabs on him." Tony mumbled behind his mug. Though that didn't stop peter from hugging him.
It wasn’t everyday the  Avengers landed a quinjet on top of a NYPD station and then proceed to rush down the stairs.
"Dr. Odinson-Banner!.....  Er, Bruce, I finished the irrigation code. And It's working better than I thought it would! ..... " Ned bounded in the room full of energy.
He understands why Peter had to go. The guy is the heir to the Stark Industries, also an Avenger in training, and really, he can't fault Tony for making him take an excused week off.
"Eugene Thompson, visitor" FRIDAY's bored voice rang through a speaker. The rest of the line went smoothly... Until it got to Ned that is,
"I didn't know robots could talk so... well, or swear for that matter." Peggy says. She gets more and more interested in the robot the more it talks.
He turns the corner and considers the door he closed on his way out, maybe he'll talk to them tomorrow, though he did have to collect his winnings from the birdman.
A clink of a fork meeting a glass filled with apple juice caught the attention of the surrounding people. The wedding was a quiet affair..... as quiet as it could get with their family.
Wade, who was still staring at her, looked back over to Peter who was Chatting to the lady on the counter. "Alright."
Steve was biting his lips to keep from laughing. Tony turned towards him when Peter left the room with Wade in tow.
Before Peter could respond,  Ms. Terry walked over to them in a threatening manner. Even though Peter's spidy sense wasn't going off, he felt that something bad was about to happen.
His luck on the other hand is absolutely bull. which is where the patented Parker luck came from, back when he was still a Parker.
It wouldn't really be a problem normally, but she took a one and a half month vacation from her work and decided to hang out in the avengers tower.
"Is that why you said Peter is an intern? To take the light off You and MJ?" Mr. Leroy asks curiously.
"Well, he'd been calling and begging for his blessing everyday, Tony gave him a chance yesterday." He explained. Peter Beamed at Tony.
