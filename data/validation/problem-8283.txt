“There was,” Tony pauses to cough, “A grenade,” he finishes exhaustedly.
“Are you both gon’ keep doing this thing you’re so keen on doing?” Fury asks, teeth gritting on ‘keen’ as he glares at Steve.
T’Challa pacifies from the lack of Tony’s vocal response. He sighs, fingers reaching for the intricate beads around his left wrist.
And another.
Natasha’s hand is soft on his cheek when she turns him around to face her. “You would have done the same,” she murmurs, levelled and calm, close to his ear.
“Can I ask you something?” Pepper’s voice cuts his wayward thoughts short.
Them and his own peace of mind. The dull way his empty cage has once again started to ache, his own smile –
She doesn’t believe him completely, but she moves past that with eloquence.
have one.
He doesn’t think he could have –
And he steps elsewhere. Always. He’s so tired of falling, he doesn’t want to risk it.
“I talked to Barnes.” He says, summoning his serious face back.
. No details about the injury what-so-ever.
Point is, Tony
“Because I’m terrified of the idea that if I tell you how I feel, you will reject me.” Tony pauses. And then, because he’s got nothing else to lose, he adds, “There’s also the fact that you deserve so much better than me.”
Later, he tells Steve, “I’ll always stay for you.”
She’s pretty tonight. All dolled up like she’s heading somewhere fancier than have takeout for dinner at Tony’s penthouse.
Like that day when she slipped a sunflower behind his ear and called him Antoshka, he loves her
It’s a two in one technology. It powers him and enables power to his suit too. It’s his own invention, out of hurried desperation.
That’s where Natasha Romanov is different from Pepper Potts.
“No,” Tony cuts her off with a smile. “It’s fine.”
He’s on the bed, leaning against the headboard, legs straightened out as the holographic projection of his latest work shimmers in front of him.
“I thought, among all of you; who create and save, I thought I was the only destructive variant. Then I met Viz; born out of the same stone. He understood me, in ways only he could. He loved me and I, I loved him too.”
He waits until he’s jolted from the act of it – Come aware, with the questions; what, why - floating in his head and he decides enough is enough.
over the outside of his thigh. He keeps looking at the watch around his wrist and back at Steve and when he cannot take it anymore, he opens his mouth to hurry Steve on, only to be interrupted by him.
The clock on the bedside table reads half past three.
Maybe he misses that. Especially tonight when the silence is so deafening.
He wants out but he doesn’t know how to ask without drawing any more attention than there already is on him.
They fight, they break apart but at the end of the day, they come together for Thanksgiving and Christmas anyway. They forgive and they try to forget.
“You’re scary,” Tony tells him when Steve demands he finishes both blueberries and a banana before their journey ends.
Rogers is tired.
He forgot.
R&D’s requests, reads through and signs
They burn the fifth centre to the ground and leave to Chukotsky District for the sixth.
Isn’t love
Tony is 45 going 46 and when he was 15, he realised he blamed himself for everything. When he was 18, he blamed everything else except for himself. When he was blasted away from the humvee and woke up in a cave, he was 15 again but he saw Obadiah Stane burn and he thought:
He doesn’t know what he’ll do with that knowledge because he’s too faulty to take advantage of that without hurting himself by proxy.
Pepper’s stricken voice is a relief when it comes after the sun goes down.
“Thought I killed you with my own hand.”
Tony’s head whips around to face him, “Why?” he asks back, scandalised, “I just jumped you, you blonde idiot. I’m in love with you! You want friendship while I want to fuck you and then take you out on dates and do that over and over for everyday of my life and Steve. I want to see your face the first thing in the morning, I want to kiss you awake, I want to kiss you to sleep, I want to burn omelets trying to make you breakfasts in bed, I want to hold you, do all those juvenile things teenagers do, bring you to Disneyland, see you smile, see you laugh and I want to be the reason why -,”
Tonight, when he witnesses again, after so long; young love.
When Tony points it out, the man doesn’t bother denying it. “I do consider the good Captain as my friend.”
He calls Pepper after one of those days, voice roughened and nerves stretched to far ends as he holds the old-fashioned land line phone’s receiver to his ear in shaky hands.
“C’mere,” Steve snags them. He holds out the other fruits wordlessly and Tony takes them, watching him march towards the vendor again and for the love of God, he purchases bananas just because Tony asked.
Both their knees buckling, sending them sliding down the wall and Steve shakes –
He knows he’s smarter than this. He knows all about abuse and its vicious cycle but he doesn’t know if it’s abuse when it was him who lifted his hand
. Around him, inside him; overwhelming.
This is what he expected he’d be doing when he joined the Avengers. Not wallow in forgotten feuds and try to become a family they will never be even if they all die trying at it.
It’s a bit of a straight forward comment, but there’s no beating around the bushes with it. Steve should stop acting like everything’s his fault. He’s no Atlas. The world is not
it happen.
“I’m not running a free bed-and-breakfast,” Tony tells him on day seven.
Steve Rogers loves and he hurts and he begs for forgiveness. His Achilles heel is Tony Stark and Tony Stark wasn’t even made aware of that.
A while after, Steve’s halfway through his second report and Tony’s fully relaxed on his lap - head leaned back into Steve’s chest, nose nuzzling under Steve’s jaw and he’s got his eyes closed, got Steve believing that he’s fallen asleep - when he murmurs, soft and sleepy, “Thank you, I needed this.”
Kiss him all over until his jaw aches and he can’t breathe and all he can taste is Steve. Steve and just
He assumes Barnes will be around there too. Stuck by their hips now that they’ve settled their little crush issue; Tony’s lips quiver, threatening to smile and he allows, liberating the muscles that keep them taught and forbidding.
“For you people? Nothing,” Fury spits. “SHIELD will handle this from now on. You can help with the clean up.”
Cups his precious face in two hands and kisses the glow out of his mouth. Lets Steve wind his arms around Tony's waist and lift him up, walk them to the couch, and lay them down, and -
But with the way he is right now
Can smell the fresh lemon scented body wash Steve liked to use. Mingling with the minty sharpness of his aftershave.
to be Tony’s workspace has now become a communal place too.
Maybe that’s the progress, maybe it’s not. He doesn’t know. He’s long past caring. He just wants to move on. Even if the silence is unbearably deafening.
you,” he enunciates, “Didn’t say it was for sex," he smirks.
, does it hurt.
Tony tolerates her and her attempts.
Tony's mouth snaps close at one. His eyes narrow and he points the glue-gun at Steve. "You," he says, "You, you, you. I know exactly what you're doing."
It’s been a while since Tony’s lain on the same bed with Steve with both or either one of them actually sleeping.
“Hard to explain.” Barnes scrunches his face in concentration. “It just – I feel it. Like, it does something in my head. At first,” He adds, looking up at Tony, face back to its ominous blankness. “- not so much, but lately, it’s… I can’t be near her without getting a headache.”
Fortunately for him, that’s when his hour ends, and when he lays in bed that night, sleep evades him like he’s back to ground zero all over again.
There is nothing he wouldn't do for Bucky - That is the fact.
Just a small shift in his seat, but it makes a distinct difference after he’s been tightly maintaining his rigidness on his seat.
"Finish it," he says.
“I’m sorry.” He keeps mumbling. Over and over. Even as Tony hushes him. Tells him it’s not his fault dammit.
Tony’s broken.
So is the way Steve worms back into the comforter, shirtless with a new pair of boxers and pulls Tony close.
She pauses, but she doesn’t pull. Her thumb gives a single brush over his cheekbone and she answers, “You are just as important as Steve is to me. You’re both my family, my boys. And I only want my family to be happy.”
Bucky seems to read him well. He takes the mug away and catches his empty hand before bringing it to his chest. Then he places it over exactly where that wound had been last week; bleeding viscous blood all over them and when Tony looks up at him, desperate and scared like he was that day, he assures, “I’m fine. Still alive.”
“Can you shut your fucking trap?”
His voice cracks and his lips tremble but he never notices all these, too enraptured by the sight of Steve in front of him, whole and unharmed. No tears, no –
Tony scoffs, as if Steve’s spouting nonsense, “I just told you that -,”
“I don’t want you to get married!” Peter promptly burst into tears, just as Pepper ducked into the room and froze in the doorway.
“Guys,” Steve warned, and they fell quiet again. “That sounds good, Sam. Get their number, book us a unit or two depending on how big they are.
“Is the sex still good?” Natasha asked candidly, and Steve almost choked on a sip of his coffee.
With the Time Stone in tow (and Strange’s yelling still ringing in their ears), they bounced to their next time and place: Asgard. Thor had told them that Heimdall protected the Space Stone, that he was the only one who could see through Loki’s tricks properly, so they headed straight to him.
“Great,” Tony grinned, because he could work with that. “Okay, we’re gonna have to go DIY on this one, kid; is that okay? We’ve got some boxes at home that could work really well, but we’re gonna have to pick up some paints and glue. Sound good?”
Rhodey just huffed a laugh into his beer and sent Tony a knowing look. “Sure, Tones.”
“Aw, come on,” Steve smiled, clambering into bed beside him. “I’m sure I can think of
been that far away.
FRIDAY continued, as curious as Steve imagined an AI could sound.
Rhodey sniffed heavily, rubbed a hand over his eyes, and shook his head with a weary smile. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll get out of your hair – you’re… you’ve been looking through Tony’s stuff?”
“Yes, because that always ends up going well in movies,” Steve sighed, taking another sip of his coffee.
As he had expected, Steve’s door was firmly closed and he was nowhere to be seen when Tony quietly slipped out of his apartment. He tried to ignore the way his chest ached as he passed by Steve’s apartment, and instead made himself focus on the day he had ahead.
“Where is my gauntlet!” they heard Thanos scream, and quickly scrambled for the closest exits to stall him while Steve and Carol stayed behind to attach the stones.
FRIDAY interrupted and Tony blinked away the cobwebs to see the kid step through the doorway.
-way, but he was an engineer, mechanic, inventor first and foremost. Making things was what he did. It was nice to go back to his roots.
“Perfect, don’t let him leave,” he swept up his warmest cup of caffeine, and jogged to the elevator.
“I would like to Tony - really, thank you - but I need to meet Buck at the tarmac tonight and I have a few things I’d like to take care of beforehand. Send them to my StarkPad and I’ll take a look?”
A voice that sounded suspiciously like Rhodey’s told him to man up and talk it out with Steve. He had to agree, all this hesitating was just prolonging the inevitable.
- returned the Mind Stone to his unconscious counterpart, moments after the second Steve left to find Tony and Lang outside. The third Cap hesitated, as the second had, and looked down at the unconscious form of his younger self for a few moments with a sombre expression laced into a line between his brows. Tony recognised it as the same look Steve had had on his face earlier when their eyes had caught across the courtyard.
“More,” Tony gasped finally, hands scratching at Steve’s chest and shoulders and legs trembling around his waist. “Fuck, faster. Fuck me like you mean it, Rogers.”
expecting interest.”
“Not you, idiot-”
“Oh, oh, fuck-” Tony moaned, shuddering again with every punch and drag against his cock. Every touch was like the ambient warmth of a battery strapped to his chest, keeping him alive in the coldest of desert nights. They were coming out of the cold, now, making way for great strides and innovation.
Tony slid his sunglasses onto the bridge of his nose once they stood in the doorway and looked away in thought, but Steve stopped him before he could voice whatever he was about to say.
He designed, coded, manufactured, fitted
They’d broken the ice, cut the tension, and at times things were eerily reminiscent of how life was before everything went to shit. They all had their bad days and busy lives, but they didn’t need time alone to recover anymore. They could patch themselves up together.
"I briefly imprisoned his brother and helped him find Odin before he passed." He shrugged. "Thor grows attached easily. He seems to be under the impression that tentative ally means friend. He has visited the Sanctum several times since."
Bruce held up a large hand to silence him and Thor did not react at all - did not even seem to be aware of the dark clouds looming overhead. He was panting as the sky rolled anxiously above. His gaze was transfixed, almost in anticipation. If Thor knew what they were about to face then it could go one of two ways: well, because they had the advantage of knowledge, or horribly because Thor had fought a lot of overpowered aliens in his millennium-long existence and that was before he craved the comfort of a bottle in each hand.
They waited for a moment in silence, and then Lang said, “Anyone else think that was way easier than we thought it was going to be, or –“
“What?” Tony asked, smiling back.
“Besides which,” Natasha continued. “Killing Thanos won’t bring everyone back.”
One evening, around three weeks after the snap, Steve walked into Tony’s office to find Rhodey sat at his desk. There was a half-bottle of whiskey in front of him, and he looked suspiciously teary eyed.
He was met with stunned silence.
he was talented and therefore slacked off as much as humanly possible, making it impossible for everyone else to truly get their bearings. It was completely unfair to all the rest of them, and Steve, frankly, was getting sick of it.
“Do,” Steve told him, a hint of a smirk touching the corners of his lips. “I’ll look forward to it.”
“He won’t be able to generate more and heal himself fast enough,” Bruce ran a hand over his face. “Ideally, he needs a transfusion, but it’s not like we can just go into a hospital and ask for a bag of blood -”
closer.”
“More than just a pretty face,” Tony grinned, though he knew Cap couldn’t see it.
they were talking about! He had never heard of anyone finding their soulmate and finding they didn’t get along like… well,
“Thanks,” Tony grinned, and Steve rolled his eyes. “But I’m serious. It’s the middle section, when I’m dancing with Pepper in the dream sequence. I feel like I’m going to trip her up by accident. Could you maybe stay a couple minutes longer and take me through it?”
Wanda levelled off next to him, her stare watery and broken as she looked at Pietro.
“I’ll make sure to do that,” Tony replied distractedly, too busy jotting down all the names on a scrap of paper he had pulled from his briefcase.
“Wait,” Cap called, grabbing his arm before he could get out of reach. Tony turned, surprised, and then watched as Cap pulled a scrap of paper out of his pocket and held it out to him. “If you ever need help, just… give us a call.”
the one you’re chewing out? Also, seeing
“What?” Peter asked quietly, rubbing the back of his head.
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine, infinitely charmed, and nodded his head. “Yeah, you’re doing a good job.”
They were both still pretty mad, if the luke-warm shoulders they were giving him was anything to go by.
For just a moment he panicked, remembering all at once what had happened, what his family had
–“ Tony started snippily, and then took a deep breath and sighed. “I just… what else am I supposed to do? Climb out of the fire escape every morning?”
“You miss that bit when I said I was an expert marksman?” Clint smirked. “You think I can’t take a little twink like you down nice and easy?”
that they could do that might help reverse the situation they were in. He wasn’t stupid enough to convince himself that it would work, but… a small part of him desperately hoped it would. If they could get Tony back – if they could get the
“We, uh…” Steve cleared his throat, and it felt like he was splitting the silence with a knife. “We don’t have any music now the band has gone. Would you – could you sing so I -”
“You’re welcome, buddy,” Rhodey replied, and then patted Tony on the arm as he pulled away again. “So, how’s work going?”
“Of course,” Steve nodded, following.
“Actually -” Rogers started, catching Tony’s elbow just before he could sit down. “I don’t think George would be too happy if you sat on him, do you?”
Now, the night before Christmas, everything looked perfect. The lights on the tree sparkled, light bouncing off the shiny tinsel they’d hung all around the room, and there were already a few presents scattered around from the other Avengers, family, and friends. Steve and Tony had a full sack of presents for each other and Peter to add once the little boy had gone to bed, but they were safely tucked away in the back of their wardrobe for now, and Steve doubted Peter would last much longer before he fell asleep.
etched skilfully into it), and he braced himself for more of what would surely be an unpleasant surprise. When Rogers did open the door, however, it was to two seemingly regular-looking people lounging around inside.
“I know,” Clint rolled his eyes, cracking a little smile. “Sorry.”
“Will have saved them all,” Tony insisted quietly, and then took a deep breath. “This… it’s okay, Steve. Really. I should have died in Afghanistan, should have died of palladium poisoning, should have died a million times before now. I was never meant for more than this.”
“I told you taking this job was a good idea!” Steve squeaked excitedly, small and hidden amongst the locks of Bucky’s long hair while he perched on his shoulder. “I told you I had a good feeling about it!”
Someone cleared their throat behind him. “You’re, um… you’re awake.”
“Papa!” came Peter’s agonised cry from nowhere, and Tony had spun on the spot before he’d even really thought about it. “Daddy!”
Beside Tony, Steve cringed a little at the crudeness.
“Want to see the progress we’ve made?” he asked tentatively, groaning as he sat up.
“And here I was thinking you were here to help me find my soulmate,” Natasha replied, rolling her eyes. “You’re just too picky with other people’s fairies.”
“Thanks, Dad,” Peter whispered, and then listed to the side so Tony could wrap his arm around him. “I’m sorry you got beaten up.”
Tony was like a cuddly limpet in the mornings, clinging to the nearest person he could find. He could barely function before a couple of cups of coffee, and so reverted back to a little boy, craving attention, becoming very tactile with anyone who showed him even the smallest amount of attention. Of course, he grumbled about it later when he was fully awake, but Steve thought it was adorable.
with the guy standing next to him. He glanced up and was momentarily taken aback, firstly by how well built the guy was, and secondly how
job – but… do you guys think you could let Tony play your show in New York a few days from now? It’d mean the world to him to play one last show.”
“It’s good shit,” he hummed, blowing a perfect circle of smoke out of his mouth, and then put it back in the ash tray. “Wanna tell me why you’re out here in the middle of the night?”
“We’re coming to your room next, Stark, so make sure you have pants on,” Barnes yelled after him, followed by even more hysterical screams.
"I can’t
Steve came to a stop and seemed to consider him for a moment. Then, reaching down to tug Tony’s napkin towards him, he pulled a pen out of his apron and wrote down… a
but a twink.
“I don’t make the rules, kiddo,” Tony replied, though he looked a little distraught as big, fat crocodile tears started to well in Peter’s eyes. “Come on, baby –“
“Jeez, gimme a minute to process, buddy,” Bucky huffed, throwing a glance over his shoulder. The beauty at the end of the bar was still muttering irritatedly to herself. He hoped he wasn’t the source of her irritation. “What am I supposed to say to her?”
The toy drive was real, too. Steve was the leader of a biker gang, sure, but that didn’t mean they were evil. Besides, the kids always loved a bit of a show, and they could use their somewhat menacing demeanour to get people to donate. All Steve had to think about was Clint, about how he would have spent his childhood if his Ma hadn’t found him, and he found he could be quite persuasive.
“Oh, this is Steve,” Bucky replied. “My best buddy.”
it,” Rhodey snapped as he and Steve raced into the medical bay.
“Hey, baby, sorry,” he hummed, not making any attempt to move as Steve walked towards him. There was a guitar in his hands, he realised. “Did I wake you?”
And, without another word, without waiting for Tony to agree to follow him, Rogers had turned around and climbed back up the stairs again. Not wanting to be alone anywhere where the lion could potentially catch him again, Tony jerked forwards and followed, making sure to keep in pace with Rogers the whole way to his office.
Everyone seemed to deflate a little, as though they had been collectively holding their breath. Bruce nodded his head sagely and turned to exit the room again.
Pulling up, he killed the engine and climbed off, kicking the stand out so his bike wouldn’t fall over as he moved away. Readjusting the gun in the back of his pants discreetly, he tweaked his stance so he looked a little more intimidating, and then strode over to the boarded up door.
“No need to be bitter,” Cap replied with a smirk. “Just because you’re down fifty bucks.”
He’d also taken to
,” Tony huffed, blowing a raspberry against Steve’s neck before stepping back again. “Kids that I’m taking out to lunch. Keep talking like you’re talking, and you’re not allowed to come -”
“Hey, why don’t we, as a special treat, let him sleep with us tonight?” Tony suggested, and Steve rolled his eyes; Tony loved snuggling a sleeping Peter.
They were almost at the end of the dance break, and Steve found himself not quite ready to let go just yet. Tony’s expression, when he looked up, seemed to portray something similar, and he was just opening his mouth to say something –
“- two, three, four,” Steve murmured, and Tony dutifully lifted him high in the air, bringing him back down in a graceful arc. “Perfect.”
Tony couldn’t say he really minded.
it work.
He was on his knees, punching Stane square in the face, when his proximity censors went off. Approximately three seconds later, faster than he could even turn, a rock-solid mass smashed into his side and sent him sprawling away from Stane.
“Who are you working for?” Cap asked urgently, taking a step towards him. Tony instinctively put a repulsor up, remembering all too well how much it had smarted to get that shield to the head. Cap paused, glancing between Tony’s hand and then his face plate. “Why are you doing this? All this time… all this time you’ve been branded a villain, a terrorist, but -”
“It’s, yeah, nice to meet you, too,” he nodded, and then took a deep breath. “Can I… can I get you a drink? On the house, of course.”
“Okay, you can both get down from the table,” Steve compromised. “Lily, baby, you don’t have to eat your eggs if you don’t want them.”
“You fucking jerk,” Tony huffed out a laugh, smacking Steve lightly on the chest. “God, I’m having a mid-life crisis, aren’t I?”
“Noo, Dada!” James cackled, wrapping his little arms and legs around Tony like a cuddly octopus. “M'gonna get s'big as Papa!”
“Good,” he grinned. “Okay, so that had to be a little scary there; I’ll admit that things didn’t go
“I wasn’t on it, Tony,” Steve told him, reaching to hold Tony’s hand in both of his own when he started patting him down for injuries. “I didn’t fall; I’m fine.”
An explosion boomed somewhere off to his left, and he froze in place, not knowing whether to stay where he was or run for the hills. Particles of dust and rubble rained down on him from the stone ceiling above, but… it didn’t
“Of course,” his Pops replied immediately.
“You just moved in,” Rhodey rolled his eyes, accepting a carton of take-out that Tony handed over to him. “You’re not moving out again just because you have a weird crush on your creepy neighbour.”
Tony choked on the sip of drink he had just brought to his lips. Spluttering and leaning away from Steve to get a look at his face, he let out a gurgling noise that was actually supposed to be… well, he didn’t know what he was trying to say.
“Was that… did someone just press the buzzer at the gate?” Steve asked, brow furrowed.
Things had changed for them after that. With a proper publicity team behind them manned by James ‘Bucky’ Barnes, and money to actually get in the studio and start writing and recording their own stuff, there had been buzz around them before their first album had even dropped. Their first single,
“C'mon, kiddo,” he coaxed, watching carefully as James clambered into the chair. “Atta boy.”
“All right, all right,” he called, and then had to wait at least another minute for the cheering to calm down. He turned to the band. “We’ve not sold
He never thought he’d say it, but thank God. That meant that the likelihood of someone getting caught in the crossfire that was sure to unfold here had dropped exponentially, at least. His employees – the loyal ones, at least – were safe and alive… and would be receiving big, fat bonus checks in the mail tomorrow.
“Really,” Steve nodded sincerely. “Right, Aunt Pepper?”
Clint cheered and thrust his fists up in the air in triumph. “Thank you!”
“I’ll shoot off an email to the Dean at MIT,” Tony mused, already pulling his laptop back to get a start on it. “He’s a friend of the family. I’m sure we can get some trial runs going over there.”
“He only calls me that when he wants something,” Rogers replied as he shoved Clint off him, as though that explanation made the situation any better. “What do you want this time, Clint?”
Between them, his Dad and his Pops got them all settled into a comfortable position on the single bed. Peter closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting their joint warmth seep into him and anchor him to the bed. He was safe; he was loved.
He was gonna have to speak to the guys about not parking their bikes out on the street.
“Ah, okay,” Steve called back. “Never mind then!”
Steve smiled uncontrollably. “I think I could deal with that.”
The lion roared, and it was a very close call that Tony didn’t actually shit his pants. Throwing caution to the wind, he turned tail and started to run, planning to not stop until his legs physically buckled.
Interesting.
Tony grinned. “That’s the spirit.”
“Hey, I don’t think you realise that I’m stuck with the fairy of whoever you end up with,” Tony huffed. “It’s only gonna hurt your relationship if mine isn’t going well; I’m doing you a favour, really. We should just stick to one night stands -”
“Hey, those are the sticks me and my buddy Bucky used in our sixth grade hockey final,” Steve replied. “We won that game.”
“That snarky son of a bitch,” James –
“- messed up my fucking bike -”
His day started like no other; he woke at six, went for a jog around the Facility’s perimeter, and once he was back inside he blared the morning’s news through his suite while he showered. There was never anything new to hear; more people dead in riots, another government toppled, suicide rates quadrupling. Every day the same. Every day just a little bit worse.
for god’s sake. If Peter had shown up to school in that, he would have gotten the snot kicked out of him. So why hadn’t his Dad?
“No thanks,” Peter shook his head, swallowing past a lump that was starting to form in his throat. “You go have fun, but I think I’m gonna stay at my regular table.”
Tony startled and turned, only remembering he was completely nude as he came to a stop right in front of
“Is this really going to work?” Natasha asked him in a quiet moment one evening, on the eve of their final trip.
For what it was worth, Rogers Mansion really was breathtaking. Idyllic, quiet, with turn of the century architecture and immaculately kept, sweeping grounds, Tony really had to give it to Rogers – sometimes, money did buy everything. Setting off up the path, Tony took a deep breath, feeling more calm and collected now he had made it. He would get this meeting over with quickly, tell Rogers the pros and cons of what he was proposing, hopefully get him to see some sense, and he’d be back in his own bed in the city by the end of the day.
“I’m thinking I just go straight up to them and stick my tongue down their throat,” Tony hummed, bouncing along beside Natasha as they followed their waitress across the restaurant to their room at the back.
,” Tony huffed under his breath, closing his eyes and feeling around with invisible hands until he caught a hold of Bucky. Then he sort of…
They both fell silent, waiting for Rhodey to return with Bruce. Steve hated silence, especially when he knew it was because someone was hurt. Before he could stop himself, he reached out and laid a gentle hand across Tony’s chest, feeling for his heartbeat. It was there, if barely, and Steve let it thump against his hand, almost imagining he could push some of his own life force – his will to live – into Tony to help him heal. It didn’t work, of course, and Tony remained terrifyingly cold and still, but it comforted Steve all the same.
“Thanos.”
He didn’t really know what to do, and found himself running towards the crash site before really making a conscious effort to do so. There was a person – a blonde woman – circling around the ship, scratching her head as though she were confused, and Steve thought that maybe she was the Nebula that Tony had been talking about, or –
buying an island just for parties, Tony.”
“Then you…” Emotions flickered across Tony’s face, first relief and then confusion. “How the hell did they all get into that state, then?”
“Quarantine?” Tony asked, and he nodded. “It means you’ve got to be put in a sealed room all by yourself until you’re completely cured again. No going outside, no TV, no tablets, no games consoles, no books -”
And Tony would have argued with the kid, only Iron Man actually
A guy called Bruce lived directly on his right. He was a little shy, but seemed really cool; he was a science guy, like Tony, only Bruce specialised in gamma radiation and particle physics. Incidentally, he also made the best pot brownies Tony had ever had.
“Looks like I have to move into your building,” she huffed, and then took a sip of her wine while Rhodey laughed.
Or so he kept telling himself.
“You… know my name,” he managed to get out, watching as the guy laid a glass of beer down on a coaster for him. “How do you know my name?”
“Everyone has a story here,” Rogers cut over him quietly, and Tony closed his mouth quickly. “Don’t think I’m not aware that the rest of the world thinks we’re a little crazy, that we’re odd. I understand that, but everyone here has a story. Clint was beaten as a child; Bruce, too. Thor’s brother went insane and killed a bunch of people; Sam lost a friend in Afghanistan. Bucky lost his arm in the same war, and Natasha has been used as a weapon so many times she’s lost count. Betty ran away from an army general father who wanted Bruce dead. Jane had her research into other cultures destroyed.
“There are eggs on the table,” his Ma replied, accepting the kiss he planted on her cheek as he passed with a smile. “And please don’t antagonise your brother. He’s in one of his quiet moods this morning.”
“Baby eggs, Papa! Baby eggs!” he cried. “We're gonna have more babies!”
“Well,” Tony hummed, “would you rather be a robot who looks like a human, or one that looks a little boxier?”
“Well, I don’t actually play,” Steve shrugged, still grinning. “But those guys do, and they’d play better with an audience…”
“Excuse me?” Tony scoffed playfully. “Fine, see if I blow your world now, you meanie -”
Overall, dinner went… cordially. Honestly, though he was hotter than the third circle of hell, Steve kinda seemed like a bit of a stick in the mud. He was uptight, quiet and frustratingly polite to a point. Tony and Natasha had never been like that, not even in the beginning, and Tony wasn’t sure he liked the whole
“I can’t –“
Clint was fifteen. Steve’s Ma had taken him in at the age of seven after having found him rummaging through their garbage cans for food. He’d never really told them the full story, but they were both pretty sure he’d run away from a very abusive household. It had apparently been bad enough that when his Ma had officially requested to adopt him a year later, she’d been granted full guardianship pretty much immediately. Clint being deaf had proved a bit of a challenge for them both, and Steve still remembered washing cars for a whole summer when he was younger so he and his Ma could afford to take a sign language course, but Clint was family, and he deserved their love and respect.
And then there was Tony.
“Peter, honey, stop,” his Pops waved away his apologies. “Stop making excuses for us. Of course we… we would never mean to hurt you, but… but we did. You’re hurt because of us and what we did to you.”
“I don’t understand the question,” Rhodey replied, wincing in sympathy as Pepper applied some antibacterial cream to Tony’s face. “Is this some weird guilt trip? Because you’re not allowed to do that – not after
“Hi,” the nearly naked stranger grinned easily, seemingly completely okay with meeting a new neighbour for the first time in only his underpants. “Just moving in?”
He never risked human life, for one thing; it was actually amazing how people seemed to forget that when they were sullying the very name of Iron Man on the news. There was no denying that he caused a lot of property damage, but it was only ever sketchy and or/morally ambiguous companies and individuals who came under fire.
seem silly,” Pepper grinned, “but we don’t need to worry about that until later, okay? Right now, you guys need to get moving.”
“Yeah,” Peter sighed, rubbing his elbow. “Thanks, Steve.”
“I, um – can I get a beer?” Tony asked, because he was already here – he might as well get a little drunk before he faced Pepper and Rhodey again.
“Thank you,” Peter sighed, feeling something hard and uncomfortable in his chest dislodge a little. “Okay, let’s go over everything one more time. Your name is Tony Carbonell, you transferred from out of state, you’re sixteen, you skipped two grades, and – do you have your timetable?”
“FRIDAY, scan back through HUD recorded feeds and see if we have any weird alien shit going on here,” Steve heard Tony mumble from beside him. “Is this guy human?”
“It’s my business to know the names of my competition,” the guy replied, and actually
“Sure,” Tony agreed, shuffling a little closer across the couch.
Peter just ignored him and stepped up to the front of the line, smiling at the lunch lady. “Two mac and cheeses, please.”
Steve inhaled sharply. “Show me.”
“You never actually answered my question,” he hummed, reaching up with a grimace to pull the first aid kit down. He carried it over to the island and Pepper dutifully opened it while he sat next to her. “I have friends, right?”
“Stop,” he ground out, panic really starting to set in. “Please.”
“No reason, it’s -” Tony sighed when Steve sent him a pointed look. “I’m… I’m
Peter’s face scrunched up in confusion. “I don’t know what most of that is.”
“You… really?” Tony asked, a little surprised. “So even though your boss said you’re not expecting anyone, you, the butler, are gonna let the stranger into his house? That’s… great, okay, I’m coming in.”
he signed, and Clint just shook his head, looking a little sheepish.
“Been stuck in space for weeks trying to stop Mr. Blobby taking over the world, and now they won’t even let me finish my gateaux,” Tony mumbled, tipping his dessert into the trash.
“Leave me alone, Flash,” he sighed, and then moved away to grab a couple bottles of water. “Not today, okay –“
“With our money, let’s just be glad you haven’t bought a party island or something,” Steve replied with a smile, and felt Tony pause against him. “You are
“I know,” his Dad replied, and then paused. “You got number five wrong, son.”
Now he knew why his Dad hated magic so much.
Before he could finish his sentence, his Dad raised his gauntlet and, without even a hint of remorse, shot Peter directly in the chest. He went flying into the staircase and landed hard on his broken arm, sending yet more agony shooting through his body.
“Sorry,” Tony grimaced. “Sometimes my mouth works a little faster than my brain – my friend Pepper tells me constantly I have to work on my filter. It’s a problem, really -”
“Great,” Peter nodded. “You wanna take a left when you get inside and walk past the lockers; it’s the last door on your right. If you don’t know where any of your classes are today, you’re gonna wanna ask a teacher, not a kid. You probably won’t end up in the right class if you ask a kid.”
Steve’s heart sunk further, and he dropped down onto a sofa that was placed behind him. “
They sped through the city in companionable silence after that, knowing from previous gang wars where they were going. About a block away from HYDRA’s clubhouse, they came to a stop and parked their bikes. Bucky then led them down an alley that would bring them out where they needed to be.
At the sound of the second voice, the lion’s head perked up again, and the man on the stairs smiled warmly at her. “Do you hear where he is? Go find him.”
was all she replied.
he replied, and Steve had to close his eyes for a moment to let that sink in.
Peter froze for a moment, completely taken aback. “I… did they actually say I could sit with them?”
In true Stark fashion, Tony was halfway out of his bed, eyes wild and hands quivering as he looked all around him. As soon as he clocked Rhodes at the door, he sagged back onto his bed and a terrified sob left his mouth.
“If we find and destroy the stones before Thanos can get to them, we could easily kill the sucker,” Rocket butt in. “Just zap his purple ass out of existence.”
Cap, to his credit, kept his eyes firmly on the helmet, still not letting his eyes wander. Tony put his hands on his hips, framing his midriff, and watched with a strange fascination as Cap seemed to swallow thickly.
“You’re no fun, Pete,” Tony sighed as the bus finally came to a stop outside the school, and everyone started getting to their feet. “What’s the worst that could possibly happen?”
“Come on, then, baby boy,” Steve hummed, kissing Peter’s rosy cheek. “Daddy, do you want to
. God fucking – are you hurt? How hard did you come off the stupid -”
“You’re telling me,” Tony mumbled, jotting more names down. “And… Thor, did you say?”
Rhodey sighed and placed his spoon down in his bowl. “It’s a nice place, okay? Good, family atmosphere, hearty food, and great booze. Believe it or not, after spending a full day with our shitty customers, sometimes it’s nice to actually leave this place.
“I killed someone,” he whispered, whole body quivering. “I – I -”
“Don’t forget your shoes,” Steve called as Peter ran for the door, and the little boy quickly skidded and scooped up his shoes as he went. “See you soon, buddy!”
Finally, after what had felt like an age, he was moving in.
“Peter!” he snapped, coming to a halt in the middle of the room; he wasn’t going to chase him around all day. “Why are you being like this? You usually
He was on the ground before Tony could catch him.
Because James was following him around like a lost duckling, sippy cup still stuck firmly in his mouth. He pouted when Steve shooed him away, and Tony took pity on him, pulling Peter’s abandoned chair out beside him and patting it.
Because sometimes he saw footage of the Avengers kicking ass, of them working together as a team, and he lamented the fact that he didn’t get the same treatment. They were basically doing the same thing, after all – Tony might have been a little more heavy handed than the Avengers, but they were chasing the same endgame. Why were they heralded as heroes while he was branded a dangerous vigilante, a constitution hating hippie, even, on more than on occasion, a potential terrorist?
"Oh," Steve chuckled, leaning back a little so Tony could see his eyes. His hand fell to his own thigh from where it had been hovering and Tony immediately wanted Steve's arms wrapped around him. "I took it from him - me - then rode back to the tower. I got it back to the motel before I noticed it had gone."
Steve would be defensive, there was no doubting that, but if Tony made it clear to him that the team, their relationship, was priority maybe he would bypass the initial fight response. Maybe this time Steve would listen to reason.
And he rather thought Jarvis would have liked that idea, too.
“Nothing, really. Fury was just on my ass. Probably wants Iron Man airborne again,” he said, shrugging. Steve made a noise of understanding and the rest of the drive passed quickly as Tony absorbed himself in his phone. He heard the pair talking about the upcoming meetings, but all he registered was the bass rumble of their voices in his chest.
"Are you-?" Steve spoke hesitantly.
the look said, and the soldier went back to his pen and paper.
Steve moved to stand beside him, his broad hand skimming over the small of his back before settling on his opposite hip. He pulled him close and Tony went gladly, only a little surprised by the strength behind Steve’s tugging. Steve had always had power brimming beneath the surface - he was so large, it was hard to forget that strength, even if he was doing something as tame as cleaning the coffee grounds out of the annoying nook at the back of the machine. Realistically, Tony should bump up ‘New Coffee Machine’ to top ten in his to-do list, but he liked Steve’s concentration face too damn much.
Steve chuckled because it was just like Tony to want to extend his pleasure for as long as possible, even if it meant denying himself release. He wrapped Tony’s legs around his waist and guided himself slowly past the initial resistance into his body. Heat surrounded him and he groaned, panting as he laced his hands together with Tony's. He held Tony close, wanting to watch as pleasure relaxed Tony’s features while he adjusted to the girth of his prick slowly easing into him. He had prepared him well and he slowly undulated his cock deeper into the wet warmth that welcomed him.
Tony might understand if Steve had wanted a moment away from the socialising. Apparently he had never enjoyed mingling with strangers and only ever went along to parties pre-war because Barnes wanted him there - not that anybody could make Steve do anything if he was firmly set against it, but still. Barnes always had a sway like that.
Steve was thrown, voice caught in his throat as another surge of arousal plummeted deep to the base of his cock. He hadn't known that the Tony he worked with for years had actively used him as wank material.
“We’re going to be alright, Tony,” he said sincerely, a promise from his Captain and his friend. It wasn’t much - it didn’t mean anything to Tony, not really - but Steve hoped he would remember his words. He hoped they would provide some small comfort during the next thirteen years of fights and hardship (both at home and otherworldly). It couldn't all be for nothing. He hoped now more than ever that it was the truth, that
Steve’s mouth went dry at the thought. His instinct was to say no, to offer something more heartfelt and gentle. But, the frustrated part of him that wanted Tony to stick with the team and follow orders appreciated the appeal of stuffing his prick past those smirking lips and demanding his full attention. This was his stolen gift; they could do whatever they wanted.
Steve agreed eagerly, his hands moving to divest Tony of the torn top he wore. He touched everywhere, seemingly without a plan, and drew Tony into a passionate kiss that had him melting into the cradle of Steve’s hips.
He gave Tony a kind smile and forced himself to ignore the
The two Stones had fortunately been returned to their natural positions without hitch in 2012 New York. He had two Stones left to deliver in 2014, but something made Steve pause. The mission was not complete and there was no reason for him to stick around, yet (as the dust of battle settled, shawarma was consumed, and Loki was sent away in chains) he found himself hesitating.
He smiled softly and sighed a breath of relief. With a final kiss - gentle and placed perfectly - Tony followed Steve into a heavy slumber.
Tony only had a second to wonder if Steve had a plan or if he was making things up on the fly when slick fingers massaged around his hole. They were broad and cool against the heat of his body, firm and commanding on the most sensitive skin. He could feel Steve watching his own fingers, likely considering if Tony ever rocked his hips into Strange’s touch with urgent little thrusts as he was doing now. A dry hand settled on his backside to pull him apart and Tony cried out with need, which was enough to drive Steve into action.
Did Steve have a thing for capes?
Tony wiped his hand over the lower half of his face and looked away, worrying his tongue between his teeth (he hadn't expected this little heart to heart) then looked up with a plastered-on smile. "Fine, it's fine. I’m fine. All in a day's work right? I'm still not sure if I'm a fan of shawarma, though - I guess it's one of those fleeting, liminal space things." He pulled a face and shrugged, preoccupying himself with the armour instead.
It was gratifying to be together like this again, to feel the basic press of their overheated bodies together. Finally together, equal as they should be.
would-... And you want to know the kicker? I thought it was
“He’s got a point-”
But why? Why did it not work? There was no reason for Tony to not have a memory of the new timeline. Surely, as far as he was aware, nothing had changed for him. Whatever Cap had changed had always been
"That or punch you, I'm glad it's this if we’re being honest,” Tony replied, lips twisting into a playful grin. His mask was melting away again to reveal the intelligent, sensual, generous man beneath.
Tony felt himself laugh, louder than called for, and the joyful noise filled the room as he draped his arm over the back of the sofa. He turned so he could face Steve fully, cheek resting on his fist.
upgraded his new arm by the end of the second-month post-Thanos (the kid called it
Tony would laugh if he had the energy. He hummed Cap's Star-Spangled Man tune instead and the swat to his thigh was worth the sting, even if the jolt made him clench around the too-small plug inside him.
and Tony didn’t want to jeopardize the camaraderie with another messy breakup between himself and Cap. The team came first. And now that they had Thor and Bruce back the high-school drama would just be embarrassing, to say the least. He was glad they had missed it the first time.
Plus, he was beginning to get a crick in his neck and the place where his left ass-cheek became thigh was decidedly numb. His cushy meeting pillow wouldn’t have let him achieve this damned fate.
brought about the destruction of Asgard and marooned the entire population on a mad dictator’s orgy ship that was almost immediately boarded by a mad Titan.
"By your leave, yes," Steve replied, his hand reaching out to carefully hold one of Tony's. Warm, now. "I hurt you, it's only right that we do this your way. What you need, I'll follow."
Tony nodded, his van dyke scratching across the starchy cotton pillowcase. He remembered fighting, the air tense with passive aggression and mistrust. Splinters in his fingers and fear in his chest.
Tony indulged within the candied moment for some time before they both pulled themselves away.
"I was never far away, brother," said Loki as Thor settled their foreheads together, so quiet that without the suit Tony would not have known what was said.
like that. All those years in the ice must have got you worked up, huh? I know that must have been frustrating. God, I’m shocked you didn’t bust as soon as I touched your pristine engineered prick,” Tony rambled, coaxing, his stream of consciousness only interrupted by a grunt as Steve began to finger-fuck him in earnest; forcefully shoving his fingers into his hole and the muscles had to relax against the onslaught.
"Bro-th-er," said the spectre, the voice unnaturally distant as though it were speaking through a wall of water. The light pulsed around the figure and Loki grew vivid, solid, as they watched him reach out to Thor.
and Tony wondered if he was afraid of caging him. His arm around Tony’s waist didn’t feel like a restraint. “I'm sorry I ever made you feel that you didn't."
Tony couldn’t help the fond snort that escaped him, despite his out-of-sorts mood. He dropped his paper ball to the table and breathed out, long and shallow.
“Steve!” He yelled to the ceiling as the first wave of come splattered across his stomach. Steve watched, fixated as Tony’s straining untouched prick bounced with every deep thrust, every clench of Tony’s arse around him, shooting come in wet streaks over tan flesh. He maintained his brutal pace, fucking Tony to overstimulation. He fucked him until he couldn’t bear it any longer and pulled out quickly with a curse.
As Tony watched the original team - new and naive to the universe in a way none of them had thought possible - he felt wistful and nostalgic.
"Already forgiven," he repeated in a murmur. His gaze fell to Steve's lips and as he leaned in Steve moved to meet him, the years of distance between them finally closing.
Tony turned his eyes to the crew jettisoning themselves from the ship up ahead, the drones following their safe landing into a goose infested clearing.
Honestly, he could watch Tony work all day. The buzzing excited energy rolled off the man as he brought up holograms and he was intoxicating to watch. Hell, Tony could talk him through how an e-mail worked and Steve would hang onto every word. He was pretty sure that had happened; a vague memory of a StarkPhone in his hand and Tony's warmth at his side. He could tell that this Tony was still off-kilter from the attack by the Chitauri, but Steve hadn't realised that he took away so much inspiration from the disaster. Here he was already designing the team custom made weapons and armour.
“FRI, be a doll, make a note.”
Steve was the type of guy that would tell someone if he had a problem with them. He enthusiastically told Tony thousands of times when he had a problem with him. Instead, as soon as Steve got wind that they might end up alone together, he excused himself and hightailed it out of there as fast as his serum-ed legs could carry him. It was demoralising, to say the least. Tony had thought… Well, he'd thought they had gotten over all that backbreaking baggage between them. Apparently, Steve felt otherwise, just not enough to do something real about it.
Steve moaned his name like a curse, closing his eyes and dropping his head back as his hands skittered over the skin and metal of Tony’s chest. He was rewarded with a lick and then another.
deep dark secret about Tony’s past quietly to himself.
“You’re a menace, Parker!” He called after him, Peter’s following laugh unavoidably making him chuckle too. Tony smiled for a good long while after that, even as the shadow of the past loomed overhead.
"I-" his voice caught, so quiet that he barely heard himself speak. He didn't know if he could say it (that which had been haunting him for months- years:
Tony looked into Steve's eyes, saw love, respect, and a weight lifted.
A pause. A clenched jaw, unclenching. “I feel like I’m waiting for the other boot to drop. I thought about this every day since I got back - what I should have said to you. And now… It’s hard to let go of caution.”
As he watched the team take their positions, he flicked the comms links on and followed their progress. The carrier took flight over Manhattan, invisible to the naked eye so he could stealth his way past Washington Square Park and over Soho. He sent out two drones to gather intelligence, pilot fish to get in closer to the action.
Bruce was transforming again as Tony turned away, olive-skinned and approaching the reunited pair quietly.
He wasn’t that man anymore. Neither was Steve.
The image of his original self, terrified after the battle and with only his bots and his suits for company, was an image he was glad no longer existed in his lived memory. Steve - knowingly or not - had offered the comfort that his past self had sorely needed and Tony couldn’t find any more bitterness in his old tin heart for the other man. That comfort hadn’t changed the course of history; Siberia still happened, and maybe even hurt worse for it in the long run, but deep down Tony did not feel any true resentment. They’d been there, done that, burned the t-shirt.
"I'm sorry," he said, his expression sincere and with a depth of heartache that must reach his core. He said it as if he meant it. He said it as if he
“Honestly, I’m disappointed in both of you. It's 10 am,” Clint replied, turning his nose up at the equally sugary bowl Bruce held defensively close. Clint bit into a spoonful of marshmallows, littering splashes over the tiled floor. With a mug of cereal and coffee, Tony wasn’t sure Clint had a leg to stand on.
“It’s not- I’m not,” Tony frowned as the words tumbled from the back of his throat. He screwed up a piece of paper just so he could squash something in his hands as he tried to form a coherent sentence. He couldn’t exactly tell the kid he was sour because he just worked out that Steve was avoiding him after travelling back in time for a post-battle booty call. Tony wouldn’t shut Peter out, though; he deserved more than that. Tony would be the first to admit he was a crap father figure, but at least - unlike Howard - he would be there. In the end, he settled on a pathetic, “I’m having boy troubles.”
FRIDAY pressed play for him and both cameras followed the on-screen Tony in his old workshop as he made post-battle repairs to the Iron Man suit.
Steve caught hold of a smile before it could crinkle the corners of his eyes the way Tony liked best (crinkles were good. Soft and old, a well-worn book. Crinkles meant he had done something right and Tony was long past pretending to himself that he didn’t want Cap’s approval). Steve quickly covered the lapse with a look of admonishment.
“It’s totally not my fault! I was going to speak to him, I really was, but Sergeant Barnes was right there and he said he wanted to fight me before he goes back to Wakanda and I really, really, wanted to! And he taught me that cool trick where he catches a knife in mid-air - not that I’d ever use a knife like that - but he said I reminded him of Captain Rogers before he got all big and you can’t expect me to say
“Presumably a rather large breakfast,” Tony replied wryly and with a playful patter of fingers on Steve’s chest. He kissed Steve’s lips and felt him let out the breath he had been holding with a huff of laughter and his will to argue abated.
“The meeting was fine,” Tony dismissed and kicked out the chair beside him with a screech so Peter could sit. “The arm is fine.”
After Pete left later on that evening, Tony returned to trawling through JARVIS’ code with FRIDAY in an attempt to ignore the plucky resolve clawing its way across his ribcage. He lasted exactly four minutes before his attention was solely focused on the more immediate issue at hand.
They hadn't fixed everything. And soon they would need to decide on the next course of action to take: how the outcome would affect the team, what it meant for their future together.
Tony begged; whatever it was Steve had in mind if it involved his dick it would be worth the pause. He groaned in unadulterated rapture as the head of Steve’s cock breached him, the slide easy and comfortable through cushion-soft flesh after the thorough stretch. “Please, yes.”
Would that have fixed things, or pushed them even further apart?
“He owes me an explanation.”
“Stark,” Steve echoed, fond and mocking him good-naturedly. He stood with a stretch, looking far more awake than he had half an hour ago. He ran a hand through his hair with a lopsided grin. “I’ll shower then we can get breakfast together?” He finished the question with a hopeful lilt to his voice, giving Tony the option to have the final say.
“True. You want to tell them,” he observed. Of course Steve wanted that. After all, they’d promised not to leave each other in the dark again - a similar courtesy should extend to their teammates.
Tony groaned around his mouthful and swallowed before taking more of his length and Steve watched, mesmerised, as his cock disappeared into Tony’s more than eager mouth. He stayed stock-still, not wanting to overpower the man before he was ready, and stroked his fingers curiously up and down the ridge of Tony’s throat. Tony was sucking him deeper, little by little, and swirled his tongue over the sensitive underside of his cock constantly.
Tony smiled back at him, feeling filthy and obvious and alreadyregretting his decision to not drag Steve home to bed and forget about the party entirely. But with Steve, he was ready for anything life threw at him - even if it was an evening of frustration trying to hide his hard-on in a crowd of friends and colleagues. Hopefully, they would all be drunk enough by now that they didn’t notice how sweaty and happy they both were.
His hand was cold and clammy against his thigh where the fingers dug tightly into the flesh beneath his jeans. The skin under his nails was bleached white where it wasn't a dark blue, the cold of his exposed soul battling with his death-grip.
He didn’t mind. Well. He only minded it a
Bruce had sought him out late one night when Tony had arrived back from a press conference with Beijing media.
a doughnut-dimension he
As Loki grew corporeal he looked far from the threat he once used to. He was a pale blue all over, sickly, and if not for Thor rushing forward he might've fallen to the ground. Instead, he fell into his brother's arms, who had jerked out of his stupor and rushed forward to haul his spindly form upright.
"Bike?"
“I’m on board for whatever this is, seriously don’t stop, but mind telling me what’s gotten your star-spangled panties in a twist?” Tony panted, shuddering against the wall. He was already leaning back in for a second kiss but caught Steve’s jaw instead as he answered.
“I think you already knew, Tony,” Steve argued, holding him a little tighter. Which was fair; as soon as he had the opportunity, Steve had always - without fail - introduced Tony as his boyfriend, his partner, his fiancé. Steve would even take Tony’s name after the wedding if they decided the Cap rebranding nightmare would be worth it. “Thank you, for that. For all of it. And I am sorry for interrupting you, I shouldn’t have.”
“Rogers,” he said affectionately. Here they were: making a semi-functional decision together.
“We're the fucking Avengers."
And, like a coward, he had jumped into the past to hide from his heartache at the soonest opportunity.
One rambunctious goose - and holy hell, that thing was
Steve returned the smile readily and took a moment to read Tony’s expression; relaxed and easy, without disappointment or expectation. Steve could see the line of Tony's thoughts in his eyes. Tony was a realist, a futurist, an ex-playboy: Super-hero colleagues with benefits wasn’t a bad deal, even if it was a one-time thing.
"Remember Clint's?" Steve asked. His voice was hushed and the baritone rumbled through Tony’s chest.
Being teammates again after their epic fall-out should’ve been enough, but Tony had never been good at stopping himself short when he wanted something. He missed his old friend and - in the quiet moments when he wasn’t strong enough to lie to himself - he could admit that he missed the man who had held him in an unyielding grip and washed dry come and sweat from his skin like he was honestly something worth taking care of.
Tony swallowed a few times and nodded. He wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist and propped himself up on his elbow, eyes shining happily.
“Thank you!”
“Certainly. Congratulations on the engagement, Tony. I’m sure we’ll meet again soon," Strange clinked his glass against Tony’s in a celebratory farewell before he inclined his head in Steve’s direction. “Captain Rogers.”
he had been keeping at bay since discovering the truth was suddenly overwhelming and pouring out of him in a tidal wave.
He was only a little shocked that Tony actually kept lube on him: a small travel-friendly bottle tucked away in the lapel of his jacket strewn across the floor. Tony might tease and flirt, but it was probably some combination of medical-grade and armour-safe lubricant. Multi-purpose and elegant, as always.
Tony needed this and to some extent he expected that Steve needed this, too. And they would communicate like fucking adults until everything was squared away. If they were ever going to move on the air between them had to be cleared. Otherwise how could they ever trust one another again?
“Hey. Tony.”
"You've got us,” Steve said slowly, as though Tony was not aware that his childhood home was filled to the brim with life.
surprise Tony. It was hard, befitting of the most recent iteration of the Cap suit he wore to the night’s event, and it left no room for argument. He even seemed to stand bigger by Tony's side, feet parted just so and his jaw square and stubborn. “I need to borrow my fiancé.”
He pressed the heel of his palm into the strained line of Tony’s erection through his expensive trousers as he plundered his mouth, groaning at the sheer majesty of it all. “What do you want?” he asked, forehead bumping Tony's, once the overwhelming urgency was somewhat out of his system. His voice was thick and almost unrecognisable.
“Don’t stop,
him, stole the very breath from his weak pithy lungs) and Tony met the look with a sardonic raise of his brow. Golden fist loose, he made a very subtle and not-at-all childish jerk-off motion in the direction of Ross, tongue-in-cheek.
They had shared a room after. Steve had been miles away, as still as a statue the whole night, and Tony suspected that neither of them slept. He certainly hadn't.
He took Tony’s jaw between both hands and he pulled him in for a kiss, deep and heated. He couldn't hold back the adoration and the bone breaking ache of passion he held for the man his arms, but Steve was past caring, past hiding. He kissed Tony messily, holding him in place as he poured his admiration from his heart to Tony's. There was a clang as Stark’s projects hit the floor and with a little jump, Tony had himself sitting on the bench behind him and was threading his fingers through Steve's cropped hair. He pulled them close together until Steve was bending over him, snug between his thighs.
Tony.”
“Oh," Peter sat, the fight seeping out of him. He turned earnest brown eyes to Tony and took a seat. “Then what’s up?”
Ross was speaking - had been speaking for the last three damn hours - when Tony blinked back into the room.
Steve pulled back a moment and Tony was afraid he had made a misstep. He tried to keep his expression neutral, unsure how much of him that Steve could see in the dark between them. Something must have been right, as Steve was kissing him again and gripping him tightly. He rolled them, until Tony was comfortably pushed into the mattress and pillows, and lined their crotches to one another.
“That was-” Steve murmured with an indecipherable tone. Tony was beginning to realise that the other man had the habit of leaving behind his vocabulary in the intimacy of the bedroom. It was probably quite telling of the super-soldier’s psyche, but now wasn’t the time to analyse.
brand of naughty.
“Christ, Tony-” Steve gasped, his cock throbbing as he obediently pressed a second digit inside his lover. He had no idea that Tony thought about him like that, had no idea how deeply mutual their attraction was. Tony's awaiting hole pulsed around the new stretch of his knuckles before relaxing to accept the slow push and drag of his fingers. He could do this forever, or at least until Tony was a wet mess of leaking precome and begging for release. He found his prostate easily and tapped a teasing pattern over the nerves, sparking small fires throughout his body until he was shuddering.
he didn’t say. “-I just thought, after the battle, that maybe,- but... God forbid anything ever be easy with him.”
He looked at Steve and didn’t feel distance - didn’t feel anger. He no longer felt like they were on two planes of existence, moments away from converging and crashing in a spectacular fall of worlds. They were aligned now. This felt like beginnings.
Tony had the arm and the hard-light shield. (He wouldn’t need it. He
"Tony... I was selfish with you and since I've been back I have acted like a coward. You have a right to be angry, to yell until you can’t anymore," Steve frowned, and Tony knew him well enough now to understand that the anger twisting in his expression was targeted inward. His jaw clenched. "I didn't even think - would you have slept with me if you had known I was from the future? I took advantage of kno-"
Tony's eyes dropped to the glass of gold spirit the other man held when his gaze caught sight of scars running along each finger. They twitched under his inspection, shuddering in a way that felt disturbing to witness. He felt pity, Tony realised: Strange had been an excellent and talented surgeon - arrogant, but deserving of praise - but now?
you decide you want me and look for that in the past? It’s been more than ten years… It’s not even been a year for you. Please tell me you understand how fucked up this is. You
and smiled up at Steve.
“No problem,” Tony nodded, ready for action. He had been expecting something to come up. An undercurrent of anxiety had plagued him all evening - paranoid, that someone had decided to cause havoc while all of the available Avenger’s and co. were currently under one roof. He kept the easy smile on his face; it would do no good to cause mass panic. “See you around, Doctor.”
-  was already in the throes of dance with Thor ahead of the surveillance ship, lightning streaking past the periphery of Tony’s vision. In the distance, a bright golden glow was streaking steadily closer: Captain Marvel, making an entrance.
“Fuck,” Steve cursed, his thrusts only increasing in tempo. He pressed Tony into the bed, burrowing his nose just above his collarbones.
"Yes sir," the A.I. snarked, clearly doing no such thing.
Tony filled in the gap, “-sure?”
How often had he recalled the memory of the way Steve had felt inside, against his lips, while the Steve he knew had no knowledge of it. He had felt so betrayed when Steve chose not to trust him with Ultron, despite what they had shared (it had mattered to Tony, damn it, even when he told himself it meant nothing real) -
He laughed in pleasant surprise, eyes twinkling with amusement. "Really?"
He remembered being with Steve.
“Is this the only instance?”
instead of
"A partner sent to the hospital?"
Steve’s fingers put uncertain pressure on the skin at his waist again, but this time it felt like fidgeting and Tony couldn’t have that.
“Tony-!” Steve came inside him with an uncontrolled cry and a tear escaped to roll down Tony's cheek as hot come poured into his body. It wasn't his own orgasm - it did nothing to stop the pounding of blood through his dick and the painful ache in his balls or the deeper longing and disturbing emptiness he felt - but it was somehow better. Steve was filling him with his spunk, the culmination of their long fought-after relationship; marking him in the most primal, animalistic way.
. The slug was barely a two.
Steve swallowed and stared at him for a moment before capturing him in a kiss again and - as declarations of love go - Tony thought he’d done okay. Two broad hands came up to cup his jaw and Steve kissed him deeply, long slow movements that spoke of the earnest devotion of his love.
He wondered if the deluge belonged to Thor having finally found closure - a phenomenal release of the god's pain and relief - or it was merely a sympathetic coincidence of nature.
The line of Steve’s mouth hardened, but his eyes were warm.
because he didn’t want to be without distraction. Without that, his thoughts would inevitably turn to Steve.
“Ew, I’m going to stop you there. What did I say about bringing up other people in bed?” Tony interrupted playfully. He let his arms drop to wrap around Steve’s shoulders as his own began to twinge from the awkward angle. Steve huffed with mild amusement creasing his brow and glanced to the balcony’s edge: definitely not a bed. “Point taken. Continue.”
“Whoops,” Tony grinned at him, and Steve refused to admit that his heart skipped a little at the sight. “Looks like I gotta go, sugar plum. I only wanted to drop by and say your ass looks great in those shorts, anyway.”
“I fucking told you so,” Rhodey laughed. “He’s like a fucking cockroach, I swear!”
tobacco in it – and Steve felt oddly grateful for it. Sure, Tony shouldn’t have really been doing it, but he hadn’t been having an affair like Steve had thought, and he was just so happy that he found he really couldn’t even be mad.
“I adore you,” Tony whispered in return, and Clint snorted into his cereal. “You’re my sun, my moon -”
Steve still looked mightily unimpressed, though he flipped the carton of eggs open all the same.
“It’s breathtaking,” Steve smiled, and then leaned in to kiss Tony gently on the lips. “Just like you.”
After Peter had finished his milk and gingerbread man, he did start to list against Steve’s side, obviously exhausted, but when Steve suggested he take him to bed for a bedtime story and sleep, Peter stubbornly shook his head, rubbed his eyes, and refocused on the end of his movie.
“Psst, Pete.”
“You’d waste all of our resources for one man?” Bruce asked. “I love Tony, but –“
“It’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Tony backtracked quickly, unable to stand the way Peter’s bottom lip was starting to stick out. “You’re a passionate person, and that’s never a bad thing. We’ve just gotta teach you how to tell when something is or isn’t worth getting mad about, otherwise you’ll end up like the Hulk, huh?”
“Come on, get up,” Steve laughed, pushing himself to his feet. After a moment, he reached a hand out for Tony to take, and helped him to his feet, too. “Your footwork’s fine, but you need to work on your leadership.”
?” Tony asked, more confused by the minute. “Why the hell are you in my apartment?”
Not that there was anything left to fight. Thanos and his army were gone, his cronies disappeared along with half of the population – half of his friends. In the days immediately following the snap, Humanity turned in on itself. Governments toppled – world leaders evaporated or weakened by what was collectively being dubbed
me,” Tony snapped, voice rising. “You promised me you were done with the stupid stunts and the hospital trips. You
“All the single ladies, all the single ladies -”
“Hello?” Tony called out in a last ditch effort, gearing up for the very real possibility that he might have to scale the gate himself. He momentarily considered just giving up and trying to reach Rogers on the phone from back at the office, but just the thought of Pepper’s unimpressed stare had him reconsidering.
“Jesus, Steve, we’re not in the third grade,” Tony snorted, batting at Steve’s arm to push him away fondly. “Now go take a nap before the pizza gets here. You look like you haven’t slept in a week.”
Steve tried to be subjective as the number went on, tried to focus on Tony’s dance efforts so he could give him some tips afterwards, but the longer he watched, the more he got caught up in Tony’s voice, in the curve of his spine, in his face. Pretty soon, he was transfixed.
“Jane is an ethnologist,” Rogers told him. “She met Thor on one of her trips.”
“Nope,” she replied, much more eloquently than he would have expected. “You’re a pretty shitty fairy, you know that?”
“I try,” Natasha shrugged with a grin of her own. “So, tonight, what’re you thinking? Got a game plan?”
“Told you I wasn’t perfect,” Cap replied with a smile that made Tony’s heart beat weirdly in his chest. “I’m, um, I should go. You’re not a prisoner – you’re free to go – but… maybe wait until I can get you some clothes and a way to sneak you out without raising suspicion.”
on it.
Steve laughed. “Please, I’d bend
Steve nodded, agreeing. “No more hiding.”
?” Bruce grumbled, stepping out of his room as they whipped past. “What else could possibly be happening now?”
Peter snuffled against Steve’s shoulder and then gave them a watery smile; Peter liked sleeping in their bed just as much as Tony liked having him in there with them. If they both had their way, Peter would still be sleeping in their bed when he made it to adulthood.
Tony quickly cleared his throat and made himself turn back to his laptop, ignoring how his cheeks felt a little warmer than they had before. Old buildings like this had insulation packed into the walls - that was the explanation.
“I have friends, right?” he asked, pulling a bag of peas out of the freezer to ice his shoulder.
“So… looks like you’ve still got it, too, huh?” he asked, trying to smile.
Sighing, Peter dropped his pen again and turned back to his Dad. “Yeah?”
“Pepper?”
“This game is unfair; you can see fairies and I can’t,” Natasha replied, taking a bite of her own sandwich, “and neither. He had a bluetooth earpiece in. That, and I get a weird headache when I try to focus on people who’re talking to fairies.”
Nearly all of his friends – the people who kept him sane in this time period when all he wanted to do sometimes was scream – were gone, and yet all Steve could think about was a man that wouldn’t even speak to him after the Accords. Steve stuck by what he had done, by his beliefs, but he couldn’t help but feel guilty over the execution. If only Tony had
Peter and Tony stood in silence for a few moments, before Peter cleared his throat. “So… you let Flash copy your pop quiz?”
“All right, baby, okay,” Tony chuckled, petting the back of her head. “Slow down. You’ll
“She's never even seen another duck!” Tony whined, staring forlornly at the five eggs nestled firmly in his sock drawer. “We live fifty stories up, Steve! How,
Natasha smiled at that. “I’m sure we can bring Bruce around. I think he’d be honoured, actually. You wanna play the show, too?”
“Some might disagree with you,” Tony huffed bitterly, and then sighed when Cap sent him a pointed look. “I’m… trying to be better.”
“Buck explained,” Tony waved his concerns away. Taking a deep breath, he continued, “I don’t like having to do this in the hall. How about we take this conversation into your apartment?”
“He said he wasn’t tired,” Tony reasoned, “and, to be fair, it
“You still won’t tell us exactly what you even do,”
And so, after they’d finished their breakfasts and gotten dressed, Tony took a couple of deep breaths to calm himself down, and then he opened his door and prepared for the worst.
Tony’s expression was hard to read, but after a moment it was gone as he moved past Steve to head towards Carol – but not before gripping Steve’s shoulder for a long second.
do, okay? This isn’t necessarily an all or nothing situation.”
While Tony hummed his way through the few bars leading into the dance sequence, they both got into position. Steve allowed Tony to take the lead, because there was really no point in them doing this otherwise. It had nothing to do with the fact that he was still struggling to process the moment they had just shared, and needed Tony to take charge.
The started with the Time Stone. Tony knocked on the door to Doctor Strange’s Sanctum and greeted him like he’d known him for years. Strange looked momentarily startled as they all swanned past him, but then a glazed look passed over his face and he sighed heavily.
Before he could finish his sentence, Tony swung his armoured leg back and kicked him firmly in the side. Stane wheezed, words clogging in his throat, and doubled in on himself. Tony kicked him again, harder, and then again, channelling all his hurt, all his anger into swiftly beating the shit out of Stane. He wanted to hurt him like he’d wanted to hurt no other person before; he wanted Stane to hurt, to know how much he had hurt and betrayed Tony. He wanted Stane to bleed like Tony had bled in that damn cave in Afghanistan.
Rolling his eyes again, Tony ducked through into the kitchenette and pulled a couple of beers out of the fridge. Popping the caps on both of them, he carried them back through to the living room and handed one to Steve, who was still stood like a lost puppy in the middle of the room, before he dropped down onto the couch with his own beer.
“Be smart!” he called after them. “Use protection!”
many millions of records that we can’t take requests, right, guys?”
“Because,” Buck replied, rolling his eyes. “You’ve upset Steve.”
For a split second, Tony seriously thought about ignoring whoever it was and hoping they went away, because he wasn’t expecting Pepper or Rhodey, and realised they were the only two people he would really open his door to anyway. After a moment, however, it became apparent that the knocker wasn’t going to go away until Tony had opened the door, and so, with a deep sigh, he pulled himself to his feet and headed for the door.
They… weren’t really having a lot of luck.
Bruce was waiting outside when they pulled up, looking terrified. Thor plucked Pietro’s limp body off the back of Steve’s bike as he skidded to a stop and carried him inside quickly, Wanda following a hair width’s distance behind. Taking a deep breath, Steve forced himself to kick out his bike stand and then climb off, and was the last inside as everyone raced to see what was going on.
“It looks worse than it actually is,” he reassured, snatching up a dish towel to mop up the worst of it. “I got hit in the face with Captain America’s shield. Even with the helmet on, it still packed a punch.”
Steve nodded, remembering in frightening detail that there had been a hole in his side. He took a moment to just breathe, body shuddering a little, and then he stilled when an arm – Tony’s arm, he realised – wrapped around him from behind, and a warm, sleep-limp body pressed against his back.
“I had kids, you
When he woke up, Steve felt strange. His body thrummed oddly, and his brain was telling him that he should probably be in pain, but there was a complete lack of feeling altogether. Suddenly overcome by fear, his eyes snapped open, only for him to let out a deep, whistling breath when the first thing he saw was Clint laying, completely unhurt, next to him.
“So?” he asked before he could stop himself. “We’re all old, Tony.”
partner, too, and that thought was a little bit terrifying.
“So when I offered to set you up with a bunch of girls…?” Natasha yelled from her bike as they sped through the streets towards HYDRA’s clubhouse.
“You want to use a time loop, don’t you?”
Stepping into his own dressing room, he took a moment just to breathe. He was shaking a little, he realised, from the adrenaline rush, and felt full of energy. Someone had left an ice bucket on his desk filled with champaign and a few bottles of water; he opted for the water, figuring they would be celebrating later, and that he needed to rehydrate properly after losing so much water in sweat.
“No!” Peter huffed, pausing the game he was playing on his Stark Pad long enough to roll over the side of the chaise lounge he was lying on and spring up to his feet. “I don’t want to!”
“I’ll rest when we’ve fixed this thing,” he ground out instead, and purposefully avoided Natasha’s disappointed gaze.
“Oh crap,” Peter mumbled aloud, staring at the tiny scar in the centre of his left palm. “Oh, double crap on a stick.”
“Dust it off into the trash, kiddo. Don’t just knock it onto the floor,” Tony told him, kissing the top of the boy’s head as he passed towards his and Steve’s bedroom. “Night, everyone.”
“Tony –“
He had just so happened to be completely naked.
“Hey, they’re nice boobs -”
“We won’t be able to get you back!” Steve hissed, stepping towards him. “Everyone else will come back, but you –“
But between the joy, he realised there was still something he needed to do. The universe wasn’t safe until the gauntlet was gone, and though it felt incredible, he knew that it, too, needed to come to an end. As though it were a sentient thing, something jolted in his head and he thought he heard the stones screaming – but maybe that was just him. His whole existence started to hurt, and he could feel himself start to tear apart.
“Well, since it’s Christmas,” Steve replied with a nod, “I think we can manage that.”
Tony had to admit, that really did sting. They ribbed each other, sure, but Natasha was his best (and only) friend, and he knew it was the same for her. He had slacked off a little, he knew that, but… he kinda liked having Natasha all to himself. He wasn’t in love with her – nothing of the kind – but… he liked her company. Soulmates were a big deal, and he… he wasn’t sure he was ready to give up the little family the two of them had made for themselves quite yet. God knew he hadn’t had anything of the sort amongst his own kind.
“Do a twirl, Peter Pan,” he called, and then rolled his eyes. “Damn, kid, we should have dressed you as Peter Pan.”
He had just gotten back from destroying one of the last remaining warehouses storing his discontinued weapons. The Avengers had showed up before he’d managed to blow it all to hell, so it had turned into a bit of a to-do. Tony assumed they had thought the explosions would cause some damage to the populated buildings surrounding the warehouse, as though Tony hadn’t calculated the amount of fire power needed to just take out his weapons.
“I can’t say anything,” Steve sighed, running a hand across the back of his head in frustration. “He’s the lead; if I piss him off, he might quit, and his understudy’s already down with mono. It’s only a couple more weeks until show week – I’m just gonna have to suck it up.”
“What’s… what’s highly strung mean?” Peter asked, settling easily against Tony’s chest.
likes our original stuff, apparently.”
Steve didn’t know what to do. The Skull had told them a sacrifice was the only way to find the stone, and though he didn’t want to believe him, he knew it had to be true.
He spent the rest of the day locked in his office, trying desperately to fight his urge to go over to Rogers’ place anyway and give the owner a piece of his mind. Who in their right mind set up a dive bar opposite a well established, profitable restaurant and expected to make any money?
“Nick Fury sent for me,” she told them as they led her towards the medical bay. “He gave me these co-ordinates. Is he here?”
The safe house was… kind of gross. Not that Peter had really expected anything else, of course, but… yuck. What he hadn’t been expecting was for his handprint to open the door straight away – either his Dad or Mr. Fury had added his biometrics to the SHIELD system, and in that moment he was so grateful that he nearly broke down on the front steps.
There was kind of an unofficial ceremony once soulmates found each other, in which their fairies lifted the spell keeping them hidden so their human’s soulmate could see them, too. Traditionally, the fairies, though they could see each other, were supposed to wait to meet until they were introduced to their human’s soulmate, also. Tony had always thought it was a bit of a stupid rule, but it looked like Bucky’s fairy wanted to play it by the book.
we’re talking about.”
over the table.”
Steve paused, a little at a loss of what to say. Of all the things he had expected,
Captain America, of all people, had arrived. As he stood, panting, over Tony, light pouring through the hole Tony had made in the wall backlit him, giving him an almost ethereal, angelic presence. Tony was momentarily struck breathless by the sight.
“Santa gotta come!” Peter hiccupped, staggering to his feet to go toddling back over to Steve, where he planted his head firmly against his legs.
Pickings were mightily slim on the ground in the cafeteria, eligible fairy wise, so Tony ended up spending most of his afternoon back in Natasha’s office again. He tried not to annoy her, really he did, but it was
Tony slumped, knees wobbling as Steve hushed him. “Just a minute, Tony, I’ve got you,” he said, a lighthouse in the face of this oncoming wreck. Tony didn’t question the pause; didn’t question Steve, despite the painful throb of his turgid prick. He grunted, a thick noise in the base of his throat; he couldn't manage much more as the sensitive raw aftershocks of it all shook through him.
He had started the assimilation during his self-imposed banishment at the lake house, but then the time-heist happened and that was that. The end goal would be to have both JARVIS and FRIDAY’s data streams running in tandem throughout the Mansion. There was a lot more code to write, but it was possible.
The thud and clatter of crockery faded, only to be echoed by a clap of thunder outside. No rain.
* * *
It felt like forgiveness.
“You would know,” Steve replied cheekily and bit down at the soft skin above his collarbone, making Tony flinch while he thrust closer. He jostled them briefly and gripped Tony’s arse with both hands to help the smaller man grind up against his lower stomach to relieve the ache in his crotch that was becoming harder and harder to ignore. The hold on his shoulders became just shy of painful.
Briefly, he wondered if the other man knew that he had figured it out and Tony wished, just for a moment, that Steve did know - that they could leave it all unspoken and move on, go back to being friends like before everything became so much more complicated. But it was immature idealism and the gulf between them would grow to breakpoint if they maintained this silent purgatory.
“Hm, maybe later,” he teased - because wouldn't that be wonderful? - and nudged at Tony’s legs so his feet were resting on the edge of the bench, knees to the ceiling, thighs spread. He leaned over Tony’s prone form and began to circle the heat of his hole with the broad pad of his slick thumb, applying pressure when Tony spread his legs further for him. He had imagined this (only a handful of times in the quiet of night when he permitted himself the luxury), but his fantasies fell into a shadow compared with the wondrous reality of touching Tony so intimately. He was warm, soft, and yielded to his caress so nicely. Steve could see the moment Tony's body relaxed from tense-anticipation to the need to be filled, balls clenched close to his body rhythmically.
“Good,” Steve praised and worked his fingers faster, harder, into Tony; so deep that he would have bruises later where the knuckles of Steve’s other fingers punched against the flesh of his buttocks.
“I’ll hold you,” he said and squeezed his other hand around Steve’s wrist. “If I push away or let go you know to stop, cool? Otherwise, I’m game.”
"Fuck-" Tony groaned in surprise as his hole twitched and throbbed around the silicone, shaking him in place as the torment continued. Cap helped him straighten and turn, and Tony felt the rough rasp of his suit against his hyper-sensitive prick as Steve’s large arms enveloped him, his full trembling weight cradled in a loving embrace. Tony caught his breath, dazed. "Did you have that in your belt?"
would really sucker-punch his evening in the balls.
Peter kicked at him. Missed. “You’re the worst,” he said with a laugh.
He made sure his room was regularly cleaned without bleach and he kept a full stock of candy bars. The White Wolf had a sweet tooth, who knew?
“Huh,” Steve said as though there was more to the picture than three idiots with too much internet access and not enough brain cells.
Tony looked up to the other man, eyes blurry with lust. "I'm keeping it. You're made for me. I'm keeping you inside me forever. All of your come, send it my way, plug me up." He was probably (definitely) babbling, but he could hardly be blamed; he hadn’t been expecting mind-blowing sex
He tapped his gold fingers impatiently along the walls of his coffee cup, the rhythmic dull thuds filling the almost oppressive silence of the ride down to Steve’s floor. JARVIS would have talked to him at this moment. Advised him against such a rash course of action. Would have forced him to call Rhodey, first. But JARVIS was dead and the bastard was the one who held secrets from him all those years. JARVIS had
“How could you be so reckless, first of all. You should count your lucky stars and stripes that everything is still in one piece. We got lucky. I
He moaned out his need wantonly instead, reduced to a senseless pleading thing. “Steve, Steve, yours- oh, fuck.” The words came without thought, punched through his lungs into the humid air around them.
Tony had never been the type to hide: when he saw a problem he found a solution. He infiltrated a terrorists’ headquarters without a working suit or official training; he built Pete an A.I. of his very own, to keep him safe because he was never going to stop being Spider-Man; he built E.D.I.T.H., understanding that maybe one day all the Avengers and all the Kings’ men wouldn’t be enough to stop the apocalypse.
had he gotten in?
he decided and patted Peter’s shoulder, it definitely wasn’t.
Tony stared at the middle distance before the ceiling and thought he really should be used to night-blackened walls by now.
But, as Steve considered his next move, Tony’s confidence flickered. A mask sheathed his doubt within an arrogant smirk, acting the part of the playboy. That was something Steve recognised, too - the playboy mask. Perhaps because he hadn't realised Tony had been flirting, the other man felt he had to maintain the mask through all their early interactions, until flirtatious jokes turned to bite and snark in his mind. Steve hated that mask; Tony should have never felt the need to use it with him. He cast his mind back to the fading smile his Tony had hidden from him as he said his goodbye before his trip. Tony had laughed so effortlessly with the spider-kid, but as soon as he saw Steve his defences covered that congeniality. Steve wouldn't admit to being jealous, not now when he was too busy deciding to show Tony all the kindness and -
"Tony," Steve began, but he waited for permission to continue. He was using the Captain America voice - the one he used to talk to witnesses.
“This is,” Tony pushed his glasses further up his nose and squinted at the date in the corner of both screens. It seemed to be two screens of security footage of himself in the Tower from the same camera. “Hm... This is after the Chitauri attack," he snorted, then amended: "The first attack. What’s wrong with it?”
A foot jostled him under the table and Tony snapped to attention (afraid for a ridiculous instant that someone had heard his thoughts) to see the other members of his party stand and shake hands with Ross. He plastered on a tight smile, followed the gang out of the room and rubbed his hand on his pants as he went, feeling puerile.
The hand disappeared and Tony felt it as Steve began to jerk the sizeable portion of his cock that had not made it inside him and Steve managed a few long indulgent strokes before he began to take his pleasure wholeheartedly. He resumed the fast pace he had maintained while finger-fucking Tony moments earlier and his hips stuttered, pushing the head of his cock in and out of him by mere increments and Tony understood. Steve was going to jerk off inside him until he came. He was going to remind him, undeniably, of how much of a whore he truly was for Steve’s cock - all while barely touching him.
FRIDAY called, but Tony barely heard her over the pounding in his ears and the breath rushing in his lungs. He shut the screen off, then closed his eyes for good measure.
Everyone turned to Thor, whose disposition quickly transitioned from eager-for-battle to aghast-and-betrayed.
“I never
to sleep with me and decide I’m unworthy of his trust? Turns out, hey, everybody was right! Tony Stark really must be a miserable piece of shit."
Past-Steve had never slept with him, had never known they'd fucked.
"That's kind of you to offer, Tony. Something more stealthy might be good," he suggested, shrugging a shoulder modestly. He bit the inside of his cheek to hide a smile. In recent years Tony’s outrageous flirts had died down somewhat, but he supposed Tony had had other things on his mind. He used to joke with the team like that all the time. If he had to guess, Steve would have blamed the fallout of Ultron to be the cause of Tony's comedic withdrawal. He had too much fear in his heart to joke, back then.
“So!” He began with false cheer, clasping his hands together around his mug. He shone a winning smile at the other man. “You’ve been avoiding me, which I thought - you know - sure, that’s fine, it’s not like I have a right to your company, but then I discovered
"I will," Steve promised, reaching across to squeeze Tony's shoulder. "Do you want some time alone? It's-" he checked the wall. "-gone two in the morning."
“I actually thought you would wake up
“You really don't know when to shut up do you?” Steve asked, only a little annoyed. He liked it when Stark teased him, challenged him. It made his blood pump fast and redirected straight to his cock. If he had the gumption, he might've finished more than one argument with Tony rutting below him.
Steve bit his lip and tried another experimental thrust, this time harder, deeper, and Tony moaned encouragingly around him like he’d handed him the heavens and stars above. He did it again and again and then he was thoroughly fucking Tony’s mouth, thrust after thrust. Tony’s spit was getting everywhere, face red, and his neglected cock hanging out of his trousers in a dishevelled mess, but he looked gorgeous to Steve. He imagined it must be unpleasant, to some degree, having a cock shoved down one’s throat over and over until it was raw, but Tony seemed to get off on it - couldn't get enough of it, and Steve was happy to oblige him. Tony’s nails dug into the skin of his wrist, firmly keeping him in place as he fucked his way to climax.
Tony thought.
In the end, no matter how tempted he was to stay, he had to finish returning the Stones. Steve kept that thought in mind as Tony walked with him to the door and squinted into the early morning sunlight.
The second kingly presence in the room, T’Challa, looked unflappable as always. Unlike Thor, T’Challa had more experience with successfully employing diplomacy to solve his problems and (unlike Tony) he had the tact to not punch Ross in the teeth. Tony scrunched up his nose, most certain that T’Challa’s attention was only bolstering the General on, but the King was working an angle that Tony couldn't see yet.
If they were conjured by Loki, these geese may be far more dangerous than their excessive height would suggest. They had only had the chaos god for a day and already he was already screwing around. “Make sure Spider-Man stays in this dimension.”
“Aren’t you?”
His grip relaxed on the book he held slightly as he breathed out a shaky rush of air. He remembered Steve had said something after they slept together, something he had dismissed at the time and recalled weekends later during the strained ennui of board meetings.
He shot him a sharp look as the kid untangled himself and danced backwards, grinning like a hooligan as he ran to the door.
"Well, I'm not going to argue with you there. But even so, you can’t deny the appeal of taking absolute control of my pleasure like that. You seem to forget that we don’t do this just for you; I like belonging to you, I like it when-”
then drew him in once more with a hand under the small of his back. The worth of Tony’s name had never meant anything in comparison to the weight of meaning Steve had inflected into those two syllables.
Tony sighed and stood, then held out his hand to draw Steve to his feet. He didn't let go as he drew them across the room to Steve's bedroom. It was completely dark, aside from the light spilling across the carpet from the fire in the living room. Had Steve even slept before Tony had come barging in?
The rest of the team, including Steve,  slowly made more appearances in communal spaces and the great old house breathed a sigh of relief as it was filled with laughter and petty arguments and Clint’s old socks in the kitchen cabinet.
much faster than this,” he snorted - a high pitched rush of noise - and he grinned down at the faint yellow mark that spoke of a healing love-bite marring Steve’s otherwise flawless throat.
The goal had never been to bring JARVIS back, but Tony couldn't deny that was the hope. Trust Steve to know him so well.
“Ha, I claimed that year! That means I won!” Thor laughed. His fist met with the table victoriously and everybody concealed a wince.
“FRI-” Tony began to warn.
Defeating a grandiose Titan and getting away with the very first time-heist
been a dick move and Tony thought it had explained why Captain America was always so hesitant to trust him.
Tony couldn’t help but hide a smirk: apparently, Steve after a night of
“JARVIS had recordings of that day we went back to the Tower. He saw us apprehending Loki. He saw us going back, taking the Stones. He saw you, returning the Stones. And hours later he saw me, in the workshop, alone. That’s how it originally went, right? You sped off on your one-man road trip and didn’t come back, I assume?” As Steve said nothing, standing seemingly numb from shock, Tony bolstered on and distanced himself. He walked further into the room, away from Steve, to put down his cup of coffee before it spilled. “Except, that’s not how I recall the scene playing out. As a matter-of-fact, I remember you paying me a visit in the wee hours of the morning after the battle. But I guess if I asked you about it a year ago, before we got Thanos, you would have called me nuts.”
Sure, they'd all been busy, but maybe Tony had been willfully ignoring the new distance between them as an act of self-defence. An outright rejection would have hurt too much. That same reason had stopped Tony from seeking out Steve’s company after Thanos; too skittish to risk their unspoken truce crumbling down around them. Even before then, during the five-year gap of hell, he hadn't reached out. He exiled himself to a cabin by a lake in the woods and avoided everybody.
Tony had settled down to nap once the conversation turned to less interesting matters, thinking he should have known better. He wished he had the foresight to bring his cushy meeting pillow with him, as he had made snoozing during board meetings with S.I. something of an art form and it was a real shame to not employ his skills in situations that called for it most.
Tony smiled, glad to have smoothed that out. He sent a quiet
and Tony had outright refused on principle to call it something so infinitesimal, until he used it ironically and it stuck).
He ignored his baser instinct that told him to look away, to hide his pain, and his upturned face was greeted with Steve’s mouth on his, joining him in the shadows. Steve tasted a little of Cola and lemon (because Steve was his
“Hey, it’s your house! Why’re you askin’ me?” he laughed, already on his fifth mouthful of pasta. He pointed the gloopy curvature of his spoon at the sixteen or so screens of footage surrounding Tony. “I’m sure Thor’s handling it. What’ve you been doing down here? Checking for plot-holes?”
- he didn't want to fight anymore. Instead, Steve nodded in agreement, the shawarma was… Fine, from what he could recall. The food itself hadn't made a lasting impact. He had followed the team to the restaurant, shell-shocked and trying to calm the patter of his heart whenever he looked at Iron Man.
wait until the Avengers are there to take care of civilians before the real fights begin,” he finished. “You could have let me die back there, when Stane set the rocket launcher off, but your first instinct was to protect me. There wasn’t time for you to think about it – you just did it. You… you nearly melted in that tin can of yours – Doctor Banner and Cho had to use the Cradle to produce new tissue for you -”
than me – why do they like you when they’ve only ever made fun of me for working hard? Why are you so popular when they think I’m such a
odd. Was he taking the helicopter on the roof somewhere? If he was, Steve would have no hope of following.
“Because I’ve had a crush on you for years?” Tony replied, shaking his head as though he thought
“Because,” Peter’s bottom lip began to wobble again, but Pepper just hugged him tighter and continued to stroke his hair. “Because my friend Harry’s mommy and daddy were married, and they got
“We could also loose control and destroy everything,” Steve countered, but his argument sounded weak even in his own ears. “We shouldn’t…”
“Speak for yourself,” Bucky huffed, flexing his heavily tattooed flesh and bone arm. “I’m in top physical condition -”
Tony nodded, and was about to turn back to the bed to make sure the remains of his armour was actually under there, when a thought came to him.
“You’re home,” Steve found himself saying, following Rhodes over to the bed. He knew what a panic attack looked like, and Tony was definitely having one. “On Earth. 2019. You’ve been hurt, injured, but you’re okay. Tony, you’re
“You might think you’re a joke, Tony,” Steve murmured, leaning in to kiss his slack lips. “But all those people disagree with you.”
“Which hurt like a bitch, by the way -”
A few hours and a lot of paint later, the whole thing had been given a single coat of paint and had dried nicely. Peter, too excited to wait for a second coat to go on, had pulled the costume on, and was now refusing to take it off.
In the middle of a crater that definitely hadn’t been there a few minutes before, there was a woman. In her arms –
“Hmm, hmmm, one, two, three, four,” Tony hummed, and then they were dancing.
It was all… very odd, to say the least. Sure, he was used to the attention because he had grown up in the shadow of his father, who had undergone the same kind of treatment, but… never had he imagined people would go crazy on this scale for him. Most of the attention was positive – his fans loved him, and so did most of the rest of the world – but every once in a while a news article would surface about a child he had supposedly fathered with a D-List celebrity back in the day who was clearly just talking trash because they needed the money, or a reporter would overstep by trying to climb the wall of his and Steve’s house, and those… those were the times when he kinda missed the early days, the good days when they were all just struggling musicians, and he was working part time as a repairman.
But the seven year old managed to slip around Tony and peek right into the sock drawer. As soon as his eyes landed on the eggs in there, his whole face lit up and he let out a little gasp of joy.
?” Tony spat, and then pushed Steve so hard that he staggered backwards. “Are you fucking serious?”
“Oh, it’s fine now,” Steve replied. “It was there, blinding, and now it’s completely gone again. That’s not the point, Buck - are you going to go over and talk to her? She’s your
After that, it was chaos.
Peter nodded his head, then yawned. “Will you… will guys stay with me?”
Natasha ended up getting her usual pastrami on rye, and she bought Tony a meatball and mozzarella sub while he stole pieces of bell pepper as the prep guys ignored his very existence. They ate as they walked, deciding to forgo the subway because it was a pleasant evening, and life felt good.
“There,” Tony hummed quietly, pointing to a screen in the top left corner of the room.
Natasha waved him off with a fond sigh, but beside him, Steve let out a disbelieving little noise. Rolling his eyes once he was sure Natasha and Bucky were safe, he turned back to Steve.
had done.
“He’s…” But even as Tony watched, Rogers ducked down and seemed to scoop up a part of the chair. Only, on closer inspection, it was, in fact, a tiny chameleon that had taken on the colour of the chair cushion. As Tony continued to watch, George slowly changed to the colour of Rogers’ hands instead.
Steve was an all-round artist. He could play the piano as well as the guitar, sing, and was amazing with a paintbrush. He was well educated in history and the arts, and was a sarcastic little shit to boot.
“Tony, I swear to God,” Natasha growled from behind her desk, hunched over a manuscript with a pink marker pen. “Shut your mouth right this second before I tear your pretty wings off.”
He died knowing he had saved the universe.
Tony, catching on to his meaning, nodded his head and got to his feet. “Sure, and then I’ll come help with story time.”
Peter frowned. “But then how would people know you’re both my daddies, if I have a different last name? That seems silly.”
“Go back to leaving at the regular time, and just tell him you’re not particularly comfortable being bombarded with his dick so early in the morning?” Rhodey suggested simply instead, and Tony huffed out a laugh as he dropped down onto the couch beside him with his own food.
, we’re still here,” Lily whined, and Steve couldn’t help but snort out a laugh at her horrified face.
“Back on the Old Block would be a killer band name,” Rhodey announced, and then turned to Tony. “Also, he’s
Only, he couldn’t get through the damn gate.
“Just this second, as it happens,” a man replied, sweeping his long, lanky hair out of his face so he could see Rogers as he hugged him.
Tony’s life had changed, too. Suddenly, he was being invited to big, Hollywood parties with loads of important people from not just the music industry, but the film, television and sporting industries, too. Paparazzi set themselves up almost permanently outside his LA home (which he and Steve had been able to buy and share from the first single sales alone, holy shit) in the hope that they would catch him doing something scandalous. They followed him around, too, and suddenly every time he met up with a friend or colleague, he must have been dating them.
“I was going to stay for another hour,” she sighed, but was already moving back to pack away her work. “Honestly, living with you is like living with a child.”
“Y’know… when I was in high-school the first time, I was a lot like you,” his Dad started with a sigh. “I was smart, I wanted to learn, and I didn’t understand why that was wrong. That, along with the fact I was so much younger than the other kids, and… I was an easy target, I guess.
. Who produced
“How’re we going to do this?” Steve felt no shame in asking.
Steve was just about to agree when, as though an angel with impeccable timing was looking down on them, he heard his phone chime a text in his pocket. Not even stopping to check it, because he knew who it would be, he screamed, “She’s got him! Everyone retreat!” and then sped back down the alley with Pietro’s limp body still draped across his back.
“You snitched,” Tony replied slowly, expression hardening, “and now a Nazi sympathising biker gang has your fifteen year old brother hostage -”
“No, Pete, see, that’s not how Santa works,” Tony shook his head. “He won’t come if you’re still awake!”
thinking!” Steve snapped. “This is Stark we’re talking about! He’s made it all this way by himself – if we can help him, we have to!”
It took Tony a moment to realise he was talking about the boxes still stacked in the middle of the hall. “Oh! Oh, um, thanks, but there’s only a couple left. I think we’ll manage.”
Steve couldn’t think of a single thing to say. All this time, all these years, Tony had been an asshole to get his
“I was thinking,” Tony mumbled, sticking his pen into his mouth to chew absent-mindedly, “that maybe I was gonna sit at the popular table today? You can come too, if you want; it’s just that the guys keep asking, and it seems kinda rude to turn them down, don’t you think?”
“No.”
“Okay, you can watch the end of your movie, and then it’s bedtime, baby,” Steve compromised, running a gentle hand through Peter’s unruly hair.
“Twenty years,” Tony went on. “Twenty years we’ve been friends, and not once have you betrayed me. And then that dive bar -”
“You… you made it yourself?” Cap asked, seeming genuinely impressed.
“I am,” the guy nodded, and then held his hand out with a kind smile. “Steve Rogers, nice to meet you.”
A collective sigh of relief left them, but Strange waved it off.
, and before he could really stop himself, Peter was crying, too.
But honestly, he didn’t know what he meant. He didn’t even really know where these weird feelings were coming from. He had always been isolated, had isolated
. God, she was gorgeous. Short, wavy, fiery red hair, a plump, full pair of luscious lips, and curves that went on forever, she was absolutely stunning. But he also got a sense of danger from her, an independence, that was also very intriguing to him.
“I’ll see you at lunch,” Peter rolled his eyes, and then left his Dad to find his own way.
But they were going to
forgot he didn’t ever kill people.
” Pepper agreed immediately. “
He had just stepped out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist when suddenly Bruce came bursting through his door. He had the decency to flush a little with embarrassment once he realised Steve was half naked, but ultimately looked too rushed to really pay it any mind.
“I’m fine,” he chuckled, stretching out a little as Tony rolled off him and laid out beside him. “Are you okay?”
“Hah, funny,” Flash chuckled. “I was just about to wail on this nerd.”
“That’s okay, Peter,” he sighed, leaning down to help him to his feet. “You’ll get it next time, okay? You all right?”
He was really going to have to work on the whole name thing.
“Think, Peter,” he sighed, running a hand through his still sweaty hair. “Don’t be a doofus right now.”
“I’ll talk to them in a little while,” Peter murmured, suddenly overcome with tiredness. “For now, can we just -?”
There were already a number of bikes parked outside the gang’s club house when he got there. The building wasn’t really all that spectacular – in actual fact, it was a small, abandoned warehouse – but they usually kept the outside as respectable looking as they could. Now, with the windows boarded up, it looked exactly like what it was – a stronghold for an illegal biker gang.
face told him he’d failed.
“Um, thanks, I guess,” Tony nodded, and then glanced around at them all. He kind of didn’t want to leave, all of a sudden; he felt weirdly good, standing amongst them. It kinda felt that maybe he wasn’t as bad a person as he had always thought. “I – yeah, I’m going.”
Steve knew a Tony apology when he heard one, and stepped forwards. Just as he thought he would, Tony opened his arms and let Steve fold himself into them, hugging him tightly. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s middle and hugged back, shutting his eyes tightly for a moment to compose himself.
“See you tomorrow, Tony,” Natasha smiled, and then winked at him as she and Bucky turned to leave. Tony tried not to shudder.
to dress up!”
“Stark, I swear to God, if you don’t get your butt back on stage and into position -”
Tears streamed around Tony’s oxygen mask, and when his wild eyes clocked Steve the mask began to fog as he exhaled sharply. Steve didn’t know what to do – Tony was
“It’s top of my resume,” she replied dryly.
Steve let out a little cheer, the goof, while Bucky took another deep breath to steel himself against the inexplicable nerves that were lighting him up inside. Why was he nervous? This was his
He could hear the others following, and risked a look back; HYDRA were trying to chase them on foot, but were getting further and further away, fight draining out of them as they realised it was over, that their leader was dead.
“Petey?”
“How is my princess?” he asked, leaning in to kiss her rosy cheek. “Hmm. A little warm.”
For a moment, Tony seriously considered seeking out the source of the voice, if for no other reason than to make sure this wasn’t all some huge fever dream, but ultimately decided against it. He could hear noises coming from the archway at the end of the corridor, and so, hoping he was heading in the right direction, he set off again.
Peter hummed, obviously thinking hard, and then nodded his head. “Like Wall-E.”
A chant of
"You know, that was some fine shield work back there. And those legs," Tony whistled appreciatively, roughly dragging Steve abruptly from his thoughts. "Remind me to design you a better suit, Cap. And I'm sure, I'm positive, that there is a way we can get you a better gauntlet for the shield. Trust me, it’ll streamline the whole process. Thor’s given me some ideas... I'll send you designs when I've got a few going.”
Tony faced him fully and leaned against the workbench, lending to show off the length of this torso, hip cocked suggestively.
“Fuck,” he said breathlessly at the realisation. He pawed at Steve’s chest, clinging onto him just as desperately. “Fuck. Yeah, yes, more.”
But the kid was there, so he didn’t. A flimsy excuse, he knew, but Tony didn’t have a better one to cover the gaping hole of vulnerability in his chest. They owed each other a world of apologies, so many so that it would take a lifetime before they were squared away. Somehow along the way Steve had forgiven him and with every action since, he had tried to atone for his side of the fallout: he trusted him, called him Tony, and carried him off the battlefield when it was all done. At the end of the world, that was enough for Tony. He was glad to have his friend back.
way, but something more friendly. It was a joke with respect to their past, not a sincere offer, and Tony appreciated the banter. He was never one to hide from his past (mistakes and all) and he was glad Stephen wasn't going to let it come between them. Especially if they were going to be assembling together in the future.
“Careful,” Tony warned, shielding his spiced tea as the man kicked his converse up onto the table.
said the Steve that had never fully trusted his word.
He had no reason to want to remember anybody else when Steve was so damn great - not infallible, but human and wonderful. Steve even made his vegan breakfast burrito to perfection in the mornings, maintained at the right temperature beside a shot of coffee ready for him until he stumbled out of bed.)
After that, Tony had made a point to invite Thor to his and Bruce’s weekly ‘old movies’ night. The god didn’t always turn up, but Tony didn’t expect him to. That was half the point. No expectations.
Got issues? Iron Man stood up and did something about it.
to that, Tony! If anything, I did you a favour.”
“I have some things I need to take care of in Brooklyn,” Steve said, gratitude softening his voice. If he guessed correctly, his past-self was enjoying a humongous slice of pizza by now and scrolling the internet to learn of the new world. Or, perhaps wondering where his bike had disappeared to.
“What was that about?” Steve asked as they set off, the car quiet now Ross’ voice no longer filled the air.
he had a house full of loud superheroes that were good company when they weren’t stealing his gluten-free bagels - Tony hadn’t consciously noticed that Steve had been hiding smiles from him. And now that he was noticing, he couldn't help but feel keenly aware that Steve had been
Between one moment and the next, Tony was out of the elevator, across the hall and knocking on Cap’s front door without even a pause to check if the man was already in deep sleep. Fortunately, the door opened before the panicked thought had even fully formed in his mind.
“Um… both,” Peter pouted.
“It’s…?” Well, that was news to
“Peter?” his Pops called, and Peter froze. “Peter, honey, we know you’re here. You must be so scared, sweetheart, but it’s time to come home now.”
“Oh!” Lang laughed. “Yeah, so my, um, buddy Hank and his wife made this machine that shrinks you so much that you can get into the Quantum Realm –“
He chose the team that would be going back in time – himself, Lang, Carol and Tony. In the early hours of the day they had set as their departure, he roused them all from their beds and had them gather in the conference room.
“Hey guys,” he panted, clutching his broken arm protectively. “You gonna join us for milkshakes? Uncle Thor isn’t feeling banana today, but I’m sure we can find something else –“
“It’s been like a week,” Tony replied, feeling himself start to smile. “Not that long.”
“Still got that phone number safe, right?” he asked. “Wouldn’t want to have to start all over again.”
“You’re being ridiculous,” Pepper replied, not even really paying him that much attention as she tapped away at her calculator. “We’ve got completely different niches, okay? And our customers are loyal – I don’t really think we’re going to lose any to Rogers’ place.”
on your creepy nudist neighbour,” Rhodey snorted, and Tony tutted.
, Steve.”
“It… it is?” Peter hiccupped, leaning back in Steve’s arms so he could see him properly. “Really?”
“There’s a first aid kit in the top cupboard,” Pepper told him, a little concern coming through like it always did, no matter how much she tried to hide it.
“Yeah, sure, so – but the Quantum Realm is super dangerous, and the last thing Janet told me was not to get trapped in a time loop down there,” Lang continued. “Turns out I’m not so great at listening, either, because when they wouldn’t answer me on the comms link I… kinda panicked and got trapped in a time loop.”
?” Cap asked, exasperated.
He pulled Steve in a little closer, so they were touching all the way from their chests to their thighs. Steve shuddered a little, couldn’t help himself, and when Tony caught his eye he felt the air leave his lungs in a rush.
Bucky smirked, and then hummed. “Pretty, huh?”
Maybe it hadn’t been such a bad idea to come here after all.
“Sit your old ass down before I
“Tony’s fine,” he replied before he could stop himself. “And… I mean, the hockey sticks are a little tacky -”
“We’ll see how she goes,” Steve hummed around a bite of toast. “Might just be a twenty four hour thing.”
“Okay!” Peter gasped, finally surging into action as he took the clothes from Steve. “Um – can I wear some of Daddy’s aftershave?”
,” Danvers hummed, snapping Steve out of what he realised was quickly becoming a trance of
The doors of the elevator were just closing as Steve padded out into the living room, but when he looked up at the illuminated floor numbers mounted on the wall above, he realised that Tony was going up rather than down – even
Fairies were like the world’s worst kept secret. The idea was that if a person wanted to find their
James paused for a minute, thinking that over, and then, with another giggle, nodded his head.
“Ok, this is going to sound crazy –“
“It’s nice to meet the asshole Natasha never stops complaining about,” Bucky replied, and Tony snorted.
Rhodey just gave him a flat look.
“You joke too much,” Peter huffed, though he shuffled forwards all the same.
“You can’t back down now,” Tony shook his head. “We knew what we were getting ourselves into. I – I can do this, alright? I can do this, and then you have to go save the universe –“
“Steve, don’t,” Tony sighed, running a tired hand across his face. “Please don’t lecture me. I’m splitting each one half and half, okay? And it’s not nearly as much as we used to smoke -”
“Is that huh a yes?” Tony asked hopefully, “because I’m gonna keep pestering you in rehearsals either way, and I guess I just thought it’d be nicer to be able to kiss you after I pester you -”
“My baby,” he whispered, cupping the back of Peter’s head. “Listen to me, okay? Me and Daddy getting married doesn’t change anything, all right? All that’s going to happen today is that we’re going to sign a piece of paper, and then we’re going to have a party. That’s it, buddy.”
“All right, all right,” Bucky mumbled, taking a deep breath and putting the glass in his hands down. “Fine, fuck, I’m going.”
“I’m Buck,” the guy replied. “I live next door.”
“Is this an old message?” Steve asked, and Natasha shook her head.
Bruce paused for a moment, obviously overwhelmed by the responsibility, before, taking a deep breath, he started tugging supplies out of the expansive first aid kit they usually kept under the bar.
Tony had promised to keep quiet in exchange for Steve promising never again. So far, he had managed to keep that promise. He hadn’t been back to the hospital.
The rest of Bucky’s sentence was cut off as Natasha closed the door with a firm snap behind them.
Steve felt like he was going to be sick. For a moment time seemed to still, his breath caught in his throat, and all he could see was Clint’s confused, terrified face as he was taken away from him. He couldn’t move, couldn’t breath, couldn’t think – all he was was the single tear running down Clint’s face.
A little part of him, he guessed, didn’t want to be the first.
He blocked his path.
“No, I’m done with this!” she yelled back. “Call me when you actually make some progress, yeah? Because right now I don’ wanna see you.”
got tossed around much too liberally. Of course,
When Steve had signed up to choreograph the school musical, he had thought for the first time in his life that being a small, scrawny, artsy kid would work in his favour. He had been beaten up for taking ballet and jazz tap instead of “real sports” his whole life, and had thought that high-school would be no different; this musical, to him, was a chance to change how everyone saw him, to prove to them that he was just as capable, just as worthy of athletic praise as all the huge jocks out on the football field.
Had he mentioned the guy was gorgeous? Because he was Adonis levels of hot. Golden blond hair ruffled and obviously just slept on, warm, bright blue eyes that seemed kind, a jawline that could cut glass and sculpted abs that must have taken years of work, Tony was actually pretty sure he had never seen a more beautiful person in all his life.
Tony reached out and grabbed a couple of fries. Staring Steve down the whole time, he crammed them into his mouth and – shit.
“You’ve got to be more careful with it, bud,” Steve sighed, grabbing a plate from the pile his Ma had placed on the table. Picking up a spoon, he started dumping eggs onto his plate. “What if I’d trodden on it?”
Well… that was that, then.
Steve grinned and reached up with his free hand to link his and Tony’s fingers together against his chest. “Yes, boss.”
” Pepper screeched. “
“Good,” Tony sighed. “That’s… all I ever wanted.”
“I guess I do like watching you baking cookies or colouring with him,” Tony mumbled, turning in Steve’s arms to face him.
Who knew so many people went for the rugged, slightly grimy, potentially homeless look he had been sporting back then?
“I – you had to heal… Doctor Banner said -” Cap seemed to realise halfway through stuttering that Tony was playing with him. “You’re making fun of me.”
“Thanks,” he mumbled in reply, pushing his hood back so he could fit it in his left ear. The right one, Steve was pleased to see, was already in his ear.
Tony texted.
Suddenly, a series of loud bangs and crashes came from outside, cutting Steve off. Pausing for a second, shocked, Steve made himself move from his seat – the others hot on his tail – and ran for the door. Outside, the street was in complete chaos. HYDRA were there, circling on their bikes, laughing as they took it in turns to drive past and take bats to Steve’s and the other’s parked bikes.
The smile faded from Tony’s face and the team as a collective halted their arguing to focus on the centre of the table where a large projection reading
Maybe what Steve needed (as Bruce needed to get out of his head; Thor needed companionship; Tony needed Pete within a thirty-mile radius) was to not be friends with him for a bit.
“Yeah, about that…”
hung for all to see.
“Fuck,” Tony groaned, somehow surprised by how sweet the sensation of Steve’s naked skin on his felt. He pushed his hips into Steve’s, feeling the drag of heat curl loosely in his stomach and send fire through his veins. A large hand moved to the back of his neck as their mouths and bodies met as one, holding him in place, as though Steve were afraid he would vanish from beneath him. The thought tightened the sharp heat in Tony’s belly and he keened, gasping against Steve’s mouth. “Oh, yeah. That’s good, Rogers, yes.”
, his mind helpfully supplied.
Tony hadn’t acknowledged it, but he missed the self-righteous son of a bitch, and
He clung to Peter’s steady voice, a branch at the edge of the waterfall.
He kept up the torturous pace - body trembling with effort - and maintained a keen eye on his lover, anticipating his next direction when the madman had had enough of this game.
“Regret, yeah, feelin’ it,” he lied, his head hung low and dizzy over the side of the balcony. He could feel Steve rocking against the back of his bare thigh, a slow strange rhythm out of time with the intensity of his fingers. “God, yes. Don’t stop sweetheart, you’re perfect, you’re so perfect.”
He knew it was a stupid question; he could see for himself that the footage was of the same day and same time. The shadows across the floor hung the same. The grease marks behind his left ear were the same. His clothes, the armour, the food wrappers beneath the desk. His silly hip-wiggle: it was all the same.
“Brother!” Thor roared, his tumultuous voice rattling the cutlery on the kitchen table. He held out a hand and in an instant Stormbreaker was in his grip. He stormed towards the South-bound window, looking out to the pastel blue sky beyond.
The screen before him fizzled, as though FRIDAY was blinking away a spell of dizziness.
He felt someone come up behind him and looked up to find Clint peering over his shoulder. “Ugh,” the archer said. Tony frowned at him rudely.
"It's me, brother," Loki replied and his red eyes were wet. Even past the blue tone, he looked exhausted, almost sick with it, and too weak to hold back the tears. "I promised you- I promised you the sun."
Tony pushed his hips down into Steve’s boldly, rolling his thigh up against his balls, and felt satisfaction when he heard a shocked grunt escape Steve’s throat. It was the thought of his cock against Steve’s - so big it should have been intimidating, but back then it seemed like a challenge - without fabric separating them, slick and naked, without secrets or lies...
With that in mind, Tony smiled, a charming, confused little thing. He flicked his hand not holding his drink - agua fresca; watermelon, mint, nothing hard - lazily towards the floor of mingling supers and benefactors. "I didn't think that charitable giving was your thing."
“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Tony snorted, then finally - god bless - took the tip of Steve’s dick into his mouth, swirling his sinful tongue around the ruddy head.
“You’re having fun,” he mused, ducking his head slightly so he could brush the tip of his nose against Tony’s. The action brought them closer together again. Eye to eye, barely visible.
Tony waved his hand with a dismissive flick of his fingertips and looked away before he spoke. "He'd say that we're fucked up. We've got enough baggage between us to nosedive my jet - and that thing can hold a lot, mind you.” He sniffed and looked to the fireplace, jaw working around the words to come. “There are parts of this that aren’t healthy... But when we work we're amazing, we get each other. I'm not half as good as anything as I am when I'm doing it next to you," Tony shrugged casually, as though it had always been known between them. In all the years since the first Chitauri battle, Tony learned that vulnerability wasn't the enemy. "And that's the truth... You'll always have a chance with me."
“Does that mean I actually won the bet? I had the last date in twenty-sixteen, so I’m closest,” Clint grinned smugly at the rest of them, looking a lot brighter with his arms crossed over his chest. “I
Tony fiddled with the nonexistent dirt under his matte metal nails. A glutton for punishment, he offered, “That’s cool. Only... I have some plans in my workshop for Alpha Flight I thought you might want to see. I could use your artist's eye for some of the aesthetics, I’m terrible at interior design. No pressure or anything. I’m just saying the offer is there. If you want.”
Tony dismissed the thought as soon as it crossed his mind. Obviously, Steve had put the Stones back. He wasn’t a complete crackpot. Although, Steve was a bit of a nut at times and he sure had a lot of regrets on those broad shoulders of his... Had Steve taken the opportunity to stop his past-self from sleeping with Tony when he went back to return to Stones?
Oddly, Tony probably had more alone time with Barnes than he had with Steve since the final battle. Employing the same approach he had used with Bruce seemed to do the trick: don’t be afraid of the dude that happens to
"Are you okay?" Steve asked with a quiet chuckle, brushing his fingers over the sweat-slicked hair that flopped limply over Tony's forehead. He sounded reasonably concerned, but not apologetic, and Tony felt pride that Steve understood how okay it was for them to get off on what they just did. "Do you want me to finish you off? I'm not actually going to make you wait unless you-"
filled the silence that answered him.
“Tony,” he bit out through gritted teeth, hands clenched into fists against Tony’s shoulders. There was only so much torment he could take. “Are you going to suck me or not?”
- the appropriate time or place to be having fun getting naughty. Especially not
said the Steve that slept with him. The man who had watched him survive the full force of all six Infinity Stones.
“What did you do now?” Tony asked, half-joking as a sliver of nervousness pierced into his throat.
“The good old days,” muttered Tony and he snorted at his sentimentality. He took a sip of cold coffee and grimaced before swallowing the rest of the cup in one gulp.
and he would never actually hurt him. Steve wasn't punishing him, he was claiming back what was his.
Unlike himself, the other man wore a cape.
"You're going to work yourself up again," Steve laughed, pulling him into another cuddle.
“Jesus,” Tony said breathlessly, head tilted up to the ceiling as Steve kissed along his newly bared throat. He had showered after they had said goodbye to Thor and he smelt of expensive cologne; much more like himself. Steve wouldn't be able to smell it again without thinking of Tony's beard against his cheek, their bodies pressed intimately together. “Now that’s just showing off.”
“Captain, I have eyes on you and the flock.”
written all over them.
“A filthy fuck in my workshop with Captain America? Hell yes, we’re staying here. Unless your delicate 40's sensibilities require a cushy bed and the light out I - Oh!” Tony yelped as he was spun and slammed back down onto the workbench, shoulders meeting the surface with a dull thud.
He was so casual, so ignorant of Steve's inner turmoil, that Steve couldn't help but relax and fall into his open arms. He waited for a beat and laughed when the A.I. didn’t deign to answer.
Steve’s hands untucked Tony’s shirt, the ends rumpled and hitched up over Steve’s forearms as his thumbs pressed into matching impressions he had left not twenty-four hours prior along the slope of his hips. The bruises were purpled now and hurt enough to make Tony’s cock begin to swell and plump, a harmonious race of nerves between masochism and hedonism.
Steve was quiet, as though he was trying to decide whether he had a problem with that.
Tony reeled, his metal hand flying up incredulously to stop the younger man before he dug himself a bigger hole. “How’d you work that one out?”
Steve’s hand touched the metal of his wrist. The sensors told him it was warm in temperature and affection. “I’m not goin’ anywhere, not if you don’t want me to,” he said and his mouth tasted like sweet coffee when they kissed.
For some reason, that angered Tony more than he anticipated.
In the centre of the garden, obscured slightly by the topiary and the green of Bruce’s shoulder, was Thor in his fading pyjamas and a long cardigan. A few feet ahead of the pair was a glowing blue light, long and rounded but humanoid in shape. It dimmed, growing opaque and multi-coloured as the available Avengers looked on and waited for their cue.
It began to rain as Tony made his way back to the workshop - streams and fat droplets poured down the windows he passed, already overflowing from the gutter above. The noise surrounded him as he walked, cushioning his steps through the empty hall.
Tony’s mouth twitched with amusement.
“Do you want-”
There was a pause and a mutual shuffle as everyone decided to follow his lead and stand down. He maturely held his tongue and did not make a James Cameron joke (he'd save it for the kid). Instead, Tony let out a breath, his racing pulse beginning to slow, and he commanded the suit to flow back into his body - settling at home in his bones until next time.
Tony watched, momentarily bemused as the other man swept away; his cape seemed to defy gravity in a way that wasn’t due to Strange’s usual flair for dramatics. Steve grabbed his wrist before he could linger on the thought and Tony was lead away and up the stairs beyond prying ears to the upper levels of the Mansion.
He didn’t keep track of where their clothes had fallen; he wasn’t planning on needing them for at least another few hours.
Tony barely hesitated.
"It suits you. But you should rest," Steve firmly said and Tony thought fondly back to the days before the Accords when the good Captain would find him awake in the middle of the night and force him to eat protein bars or send him to bed. Maybe Steve had cared back then and it was him that had been too scared to open his eyes and see it.
"Sure," he said and did not for a second let his disappointment colour his tone. “Another time.”
And that was interesting. In all the time they’d been together, Tony hadn’t seen Steve outright jealous before. Tony hid a smile - it was flattering, really. A bit cute, too - and nodded up at his partner.
"Ready," he replied and took Steve's hand in his to rejoin the party.
He watched as Steve’s tongue swiped away the sheen of moisture gracing his upper lip he had traded during the kiss and estimated it to be coming up to five am.
wasn’t that sad? He was right back where they started a decade ago; pining after a man who sought him out once for a post-victory screw.
"Yes. Don't stop,” Tony murmured and he pressed his nose into the shorter hairs behind Steve’s ear, along his hairline as he spoke. He knew that - given the opportunity - Steve would use every moment to atone for his past mistakes (to wait for a signal, despite how much he would rather be jumping into the fire) but Tony didn’t want to think about the past anymore. He didn’t want Steve acting carefully around him. He wanted the man - irresponsible time-travel decisions and all. He wanted the future.
If Thor was calling a storm on the property, it was likely to be at least an eight. Tony had his hard-light shield up as he followed after the Hulk, Mark LXXXVIII materialising seamlessly to accommodate his metal arm as he rushed through the splintered and buckled doors -
“You like that,” he said, panting as he moved his attention to kiss and bite at Tony’s ribs and stomach. He tasted of sweat and musk from strings of Tony’s pre-come that had dripped to his abdomen. His hand moved faster, harder, and Tony keened and arched under him. He was so beautiful, so receptive and eager. Steve wasn't using his full strength, but he wagered Tony found the power behind his touch more than a little bit sexy, judging by the way he scrambled against the bench.
Steve's moans quickly grew more rugged, deeper and pleading as their flesh stroked mutual pleasure against one another. It was one of the most primal sexual things Tony had ever had the pleasure to be a part of.
talking about it, good to know. And
“Uh-huh,” he replied, genuinely speechless for once. He reached out blindly for Steve’s cheek and brushed away the longer wet hairs clinging to his forehead. He kissed him, slow and full of promise, the unspoken words he was too afraid to say aloud.
The team began to retreat; first Barnes, then Barton and Pete followed. Tony looked across the clearing and caught Steve's eye, the other man's expression a mixture of grim remorse, and Tony wondered what story his own features told.
"Let us have this, Rogers. We can debate the moral conscience tomorrow."
understated - for him, anyway.
"Past-Me was a dick," Steve replied. "I won't ever want to go back. I was looking for something I didn't need to go looking for."
Here and now, it was all Steve Rogers. The man carefully mapping out Tony's back, taking a firm hold when he found what he wanted, and growing hotter beneath him by the minute. Tony relaxed further into his body. He settled his weight against Steve's stomach timidly as if he were afraid he might chance a burn upon contact. He trailed his mouth along the line of Steve’s jaw, leaving his lips wet and parted for breath along the way.
“No, damnit. Please, Steve, I’m almost- please,” He begged, because surely this type of torture was hurting Steve as much as it hurt him. He wondered what they looked like to the room behind - what a friend or a stranger might see if they went looking for them, only to come across the picture of Captain America bouncing Tony on the tip of his dick.
Steve got like this sometimes, commanding and assuming more boldness with his actions. He was happy for Tony to take the lead, to top or bottom, to dole out pain and pleasure or beg for it himself (Steve Rogers was always so fair, even in bed) but sometimes he
“I love you,” he said out loud to the screen, without anybody but the A.I. to overhear him.
They’d been on unequal footing since almost the beginning. Had Tony unintentionally created a self-fulfilling prophecy with Steve: pushed him and the team to breaking point to prove to himself that he could never be deserving of Captain America's trust?
He supported Tony’s weight as they showered together and Steve took his time washing the dried sweat and cooling mix of lube and come from Tony’s skin. Steve touched him with love, uncaring that he was showing his hand, and Tony preened under the kind treatment. Tony teased him, kissed him, and offered to wash Steve off too. Steve enjoyed the easy warmth and the feeling of camaraderie they shared as hands passed over grazes and bruises from the New York fight and their enthusiastic sex.
“Uh, I don’t want to- But, has anybody seen Loki?” Bruce asked, scratching a large green thumb over his temple with an anxious expression across his features.
If Steve had expected Tony to say anything - an apology wasn’t it. He had always thought Tony had too much pride to admit when he was wrong - sure, Tony made mistakes and recognised them enough to fix them, but a verbal confession was a surprise to Steve. Maybe, he thought, he had never given Tony the chance to feel safe enough to admit something he felt was a weakness. If things had been better, maybe Tony would have come to share a little bit more of himself with Steve - with the team.
They kissed and undulated against one another, letting a natural rhythm flow as their bodies met and reignited together, closer with every touch. They were learning and relearning, finding each other again in this unique moment in time. Tony didn’t think about how they could have had this since that first time, nor did he think to the future. He let himself be stripped, eager to get his hands back on Steve and help him get naked, too.
he hissed and thrust again, slowly, shaking with the effort of controlling himself. He felt a squeeze at his wrist and looked down to see Tony pressing him deeper so his nose nuzzled against his balls. Tony was full, full of his prick, and arching up for more.
He shouldn't think about it. He had stolen this moment from the universe; he shouldn't let his mind wander elsewhere. He forced himself back to the present and savoured the warmth of Tony firmly against his body.
