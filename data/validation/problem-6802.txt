God, he needed to sleep - just for a second, he thought, tilting to the side and weakening the compressions he made over Steve’s star-spangled chest.
“The psycho assumed he got him, so we rolled with it, staged the fake private-funeral, and the guy came out of hiding – he gets cocky when he gets the outcome he wants from us,”
Natasha asked the doctor if she could do it instead, staring Tony down, eliciting a nervous twitch from Tony. The doctor merely snorted and carried on - Nat hadn’t been serious anyway, but the threat carried through.
“I just-! I misread your closeness as a romantic thing, up until… well, just recently, actually,” he conceded, rubbing his sweaty palms together. “Nat told me she’s gay.”
Bucky was never a deep sleeper, especially after the war. Hearing the crunch of snow distantly outside woke him in an instant; he was surprised to see Tony awake - there was no way Tony with his regular hearing would have heard the approaching ambush, but perhaps a part of him sensed it, or whatever, Bucky thought.
“Uh, excuse me? Didn’t I mention earlier I just naturally count the cards, or weren’t you listening?”
The following silence could be cut with a knife. Rhodey just smiled to himself, feeling oddly gleeful for his best friend; since coming downstairs, Tony had been deliriously happy, humming softly to himself.
Steve was a little worried; Tony had admittedly been slacking off when it came to training. It had only been going on for two weeks or so, so he hadn’t really felt it necessary to bring up just yet. But if his performance was off today, it would give Steve the opportunity to suggest coming back to more regular sparring sessions that didn’t involve the whole team.
Steve’s heart thumped in his chest when he realised Tony sounded disappointed, with a pointed edge to his tone that suggested there was
Tony unleashed the last remnants of the suit’s energy into his gauntlets, which he’d quietly aimed towards Doom’s gut while he was monologuing.
Steve gave her a steady look, hands out as if approaching a wild animal in submission - not a seven-year-old.
. He’s on his floor - mind out for all the shit he’s got lying around, he’s working on some robot,” she waved her hand, dismissing him casually as she turned back to reading her book, hiding her smile behind it.
“You didn’t have to do this, Steve,” Tony said from the sink, scrubbing the last of the crockery. Steve looked up from where he was drying them with a dishcloth, and smiled shyly.
Steve grinned at the pair, before looking up to when Tony and Clint began a ridiculous high-pitch screaming. Both had jumped backwards from the fire, crashing into the ground and scrambling to get back from a fire that was now impressively roaring. Bruce and Rhodey were shouting at them - all while laughing - as Nat just cackled, throwing her head back and letting her red hair curl and bounce with the movement.
“Who’s ready to get beat up by Thor?” Clint hollered, blissfully unaware of the fact that Steve’s mind was going into overdrive.
The rest of them slowly joined them, and they lead under the stars of the Moroccan sky, feeling lighter than any of them had in a long time, and it wasn’t just because of the pot.
Doom stumbled backwards, waving a command with the gesture of his hand, and one of his lackeys gathered his vulnerable form in it’s arms, and retreated, firing up its own, more primitive repulser technology.
After that escapade, Fury had informed them he’d received word from local authorities that Avenger intervention for menial matters wasn’t necessary. Basically, a polite way of saying Kindly piss off next time.
When Steve and Bucky stood through the door, Sam glared back at them. Shaking his head, he took one last glance outside, and tentatively shut the door. Rhodey had thrown more paper onto the fire, and Tony was set down in front of it. He was dripping wet, and Rhodey threw blanket after blanket over his friend. Bucky lingered back, until Sam approached his side.
An hour or so in, and Thor was out, having lost all his chips. Jane rubbed Thor’s massive arm consoling while he pouted. Half an hour later, and Bruce had conceded , though he looked very amused and kept casting glances at Tony, who - fair play to the man - was exceptional. A few minutes later, Natasha also ducked out the game, an air of understanding between him and Bruce. Rhodey hadn’t even joined in the first place, instead choosing to overlook the whole game with an observant gaze.
Steve watched from the corner of his eye the interaction taking place between Tony and Thor, barely noticing Bucky toss seaweed over Sam’s face.
Nat’s body seemed to have gone slightly looser, the vice-like grip she had round her own knees reducing by the slightest amount.
Tony got up, making sure to push his stool under the table with as much huffing as possible. He stopped in the doorway, and Steve looked up from his sketchbook, noting the expectant look from the brunette.
“No you didn’t,” Natasha called over her shoulder as they strolled down a steady slope towards the beach, “I threw them off the pier when you went to get sunblock,”
“Yeah, probably not, I imagine they’re all running for the hills by now,” he half-heartedly shook his fist in the air, deadpan expression on his face “they’ll rue the day they messed with the Avengers, or whatever. Still, kinda didn’t wanna risk it - getting him more involved than he was already forced to be.”
, Nat had lamented at some point, and now… Tony had to agree. Ever since he spent more time training with her, getting shit done rather than feeling like he needed to protect his ego. So, he didn’t really mind if they joked about him not keeping up with them, not just because Nat’s ‘take no shit’ outlook was rubbing off on him, but because he knew that in reality, he was training
“I tried to tell the surgeons not to bother with it - your liver that is - hardly valuable, damaged beyond repair. Definitely wouldn’t be worth the trouble. They neglected to listen to me.”
“Well,” the engineer said, casting his eyes up to meet Steve’s, which were dancing as wildly as his own were with joy and amusement, “You got me there.”
“Well, sure. It won’t be hard per-say - I can salvage something from the tech on your suits, make a communication devise or something that tells someone where we are. If we’re lucky, S.H.I.E.L.D. will be looking for us-”
The mission had gone as expected up until Hydra pulled the big guns out, literally. Hydra had concentrated their efforts to strike-team alpha - Steve, Bucky, and Sam. Since the loss of their asset, Hydra have been particularly keen on getting their hands back on a super soldier, or two. Sam had only just managed to swoop down to push Steve out of the way of a blast that would surely have immobilised him for the rest of the operation - only in doing so did he crush his left arm under his own and Steve’s weight at an unnatural angle.
“Nah, it’s fine, I don’t mind…” Steve smiled in return. Bruce was exactly the kind of calm and comforting presence a person needed in the morning, especially this one, since he knew Buck wouldn’t have forgotten about the night before. Hell, he’d probably roped Sam into his business already.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Then if you know the time and day, you’ll also note that this is officially outside of consulting hours so I’m afraid you’ll need to get in line and make a date with Hill who will make a date with Fury who will make a date with Larry-what’s-his-name who will make a date with JARVIS who—“
Tony had a quip at the tip of his tongue but it wouldn’t come out. He shook his head and focused on reaching Thor. He flew through the flattened tunnel of trees and deposited Clint and Natasha at the edge of the lawn where Colonel Sanders in his four-storey glory was roaring to the skies. His filters cut out the noise but his sensors also showed at least three hundred recording cameras pointed at them from the surrounding buildings. Tony sighed and fired off a perimeter of smoke flares. No ogling hopefully means that they would evacuate. The camera count only dropped to half and Tony sighed again.
This was heading into a territory Tony didn’t particularly know how to articulate. He leaned back against the wall, having unconsciously moved closer to Steve from the cot while he’d been talking, and tried to think it over. When he thought he could put it to words, he opened his mouth with an answer.
"I am, as you see, immobilized and lightly beaten. I've been better but also a good deal worse. Now cut me free with that whittling knife of yours."
Jim sits back into his seat and looks around the bar. Tony fumes at him over his own drink from across the table. The bar has filled up a little more since they arrived but their corner, the tables around them are still empty. He’ll have to thank the waitress when they leave. He takes a drink.
Tony turned his attention back to where Thor, Clint, and Natasha were trying to draw the Colonel away from the Library. The Colonel roared and jumped into the air and landed with an almighty thud. A large boom resounded through the park and a crack streaked up the walls of the Library.
“No, you can’t. Those gouges from Vanko haven’t healed. Your jaw is still bruised. We haven’t even found Vanko’s anchor. What if he comes back?
Looking at the sharply dressed man he’d steadied, he realized with a pang that he recognized the tousled head of dark hair and goateed face with the handsome cheekbones. Steve had never met him in person, but there was a thick file on Tony Stark he’d gone through and he’d seen the man’s tech in action with them on the field. And there was also the internet.
And with that, they’re two floors down, outside in the sunlight, and panting from laughter and embarrassment mingled.
The first time Iron Man curled into his side as Tony Stark, the true Golden Avenger, Steve felt a little
Tony rolled over in the cot and stared up at the spotlights. He was not going to think about Steve masturbating because that way lay madness. He was not going to think of how Steve was probably sitting outside, fly open, dick in hand, moaning Tony's name as he—
“Just promise me,” Steve added quietly, after their laughter died down, “that you’ll keep yourself safe.”
And he’s cut off by Steve’s mouth and he hums happily into the kiss, morning breath be damned. He deepens the kiss, reveling in the fact that he can touch.
"I always blamed Howard," Stark continued, voice a rasp. "For mom's death. How could he be so irresponsible with her sitting by him, you know? How could he" —his armored arm lifted, but dropped half way— "just be that irresponsible to
“Witch!” the kid screamed at him from down on the street. “I’m a witch! And I'm eighteen! I’m not a kid!”
T'Challa ran into the Captain and the Soldier first, the former bloodied in the face and weary, the latter slumped and missing his metal arm. He stopped and made no further advances, but it was proven futile when the Captain pushed the Soldier behind himself and raised his fists.
“Even so,” Thor says, heading out towards a patch of concrete, away from the lawn, “I will bring back a great boar to feast upon tonight!” He raises his hand in time to catch Mjolnir from wherever he had left it and lifts it to the sky. “I will return shortly!”
Steve sat now, amused, while Tony spouted off about vampires and teenage girls. After a full ten minutes of watching the other man gesture increasingly wildly, it was apparent that Tony was actually serious, and Steve has to put up a hand. Surprisingly, Tony stopped talking.
He set his glass down harder than he should, but it didn’t break like it would have. It was a long time before he looked up again.
Tony taps at his chin then clicks his fingers, and suddenly they’re standing in a rowdy wet market, probably somewhere in Southeast Asia – Steve doesn’t know it.
“I didn’t,” Steve said firmly. “There was - remember that dream of mine I told you about?” He waited for Tony to nod before continuing. “That Cube, it’s still out there somewhere. I just wanted to know more about it. I didn’t know they’d go looking for it. And I definitely didn’t expect them to find anything even if they did.”
"And we'll need to ride with you," the Captain said, coming to a conclusion just as fast. "Leave the Quinjet for Tony. If he's willing to take Zemo. Taking Zemo in will protect him from whatever punishment they'd have for him. Only if he's willing." And it would spare himself and his friend, he didn't say.
This was what Tony might have wanted. Was this what Steve had wanted? Was this how the Soul Stone kept the souls it collected? In some Matrix-like simulation, keeping them happy and docile so it could have them forever? He was ashamed to say that he might’ve been tempted to stay if this was what would be waiting for him.
T'Challa raised a hand and clapped it hard on Stark's metal shoulder. It earned him a hard glare but he saw the spiral of guilt and anger ebb at the contact.
Sam turns to strong-arm Rhodey into double-teaming Steve only to see the War Machine hovering slowly towards the ceiling hatch.
flutter in his chest. The warmth from the armor and the warmth from Tony’s body were two different things and Steve knew the feel of both now. Two of the men Steve had admired were the same person. The one who gave him a new home and the one who made him enjoy this new home were the same person. Steve felt something like pride that he could be as close as he was to Tony Stark, and closer still to Iron Man. It was like the final barrier had been stripped between them.
In the end, the glossy lapel holes he loved to finger (Asolsa Lucida, as Tony’s tailor informed him) or the texture of fabric he loved to stroke (Tony loved silk the most) weren't the things that kept his attention – they drew him in like a moth to flame, but it was Tony who kept him circling around, mesmerized.
“Tony provides all the toys,” Bruce continues, patting the walls as they walk. “Very traditional father gesture.”
T'Challa left with a smile of his own. He had a kingdom to settle, the UN to placate, a heavy mantle to don, and a legacy to maintain.
, can you believe that? The woman who always told me to put on a seat belt, killed by one. They told me it was a car accident. I believed it, just like that. I believed it and didn't know better for twenty, twenty-five years. Even
And he is completely naked. With someone equally male and naked pressed against his back, kissing along his shoulders.
Tony ground his teeth. “Why can’t you give me Steve? What are you going to do when you’re whole? Who’re your brothers?”
Tony was technically a consultant for PLASM but despite his grumbling at the title, he had taken the role to heart. They’d eventually moved to the newly opened Stark Tower in New York and Tony had made room for the rest of the team to stay. He had also taken it upon himself to design new gear for Clint and Natasha and Steve was learning quickly about ghosts and psychokinetic energies, particle physics, and robotics just from Tony’s general rambling as he had worked into the night.
He hears the quick patter of small feet and turns just in time to catch a young boy barreling around a corner and into his arms. Steve looks down and sees Tony’s brown eyes peering up at him through messy brown hair.
The sounds were different, the smells were different, and the food had moved on to exciting avenues. And even though Steve loved the people, they sometimes threw him off, too. Right around him as he walked, he could count seven out of twelve people staring down at their phones, thumbs tapping away. Some of them had earphones dangling from their ears and most didn’t look like they were looking at where they were going. That last one was also a bit of a constant and Steve relaxed a little.
Tony shook his head then circled his fingers at the ceiling, asking for the lights to come on gradually. They faded in, and Tony tried once again to blink the blur away from his eyes. He focused on the ugly sculpture Pepper had placed in his room until his eyes adjusted to the brighter light, to the details of color. He blinked rapidly then squinted back at the figure.
Tony gave him the smallest and most genuine of smiles in return and Steve committed this feeling to memory – this new turning point in their lives. Steve would do his best to earn back the trust of this man who had dragged him through all the highs and lows of life. And he knew Tony would do the same.
In many ways, kissing Tony was a re-enactment of their entire tumultuous history. The turbulent times where one or the both of them had been presumed dead. The highs and lows of them forming and breaking the Avengers again and again. The crushing pain of betrayals and divides.
“Oh my God, I’m so sorry, Steve,” Tony blurts out, reaching forward to take Steve’s hand away to check the damage. Steve’s cheek was a little red but nothing was broken or bleeding and Tony relaxes a little.
He sits up with a flail and feels his elbow hit something and hears a soft “ow”. Turning around, he sees Steve, hair absolutely mussed, rubbing at his own cheek with eyes still squinted from sleep.
“I can take a lot from you, Steve,” Tony said, voice quiet, almost a sob. “God knows I’ve taken a lot from you. But this. I can’t take this, Steve. I can’t.”
Steve gave him a small squeeze in response and watched in delight as Tony groaned in pleasure, turning his head to the side, eyes closed tight. Steve felt that tug from the anchor, the one that had always brought him back to Tony and he stroked a thumb over the warmth, feeling it tug him closer still. Tony was almost panting beneath him, breath catching in his throat with every one of Steve’s strokes.
Two hours later, Tony’s state could only be described as utterly miserable. His mind had been reduced to two simple thoughts: sex and Steve. He lay back onto the cot, cleaned and showered inside and out, pants back on, and, with huge effort, dragged his sluggish thoughts back to examining the entire situation. He had been so sure that whatever it was that had been forced on them, he would have thrown it off in twenty-four hours. And there were still two hours left.
“Nice suit,” Steve observes dryly. He and Loki have never been properly introduced, but just as Loki recognizes him, Steve knows him too – and also knows what he’s about. Apart from the regular Hollywood prattle, Thor has mentioned a word or two in warning about his wayward brother. “You don’t see too many people favoring green these days.”
Tony points, and when Steve looks, he’s pleasantly surprised to find Phil trying to make his way over.  The usually calm and collected agent looks uncommonly flustered and for once, Steve suspects it’s not because of his presence.
Bucky doesn’t know what to say to that, so he takes a page from Tony’s usual playbook, the one the man seems to have maturely set aside for this conversation, and re-directs attention away from the actual matter at hand.
“Bye, Tony.”  Bruce waves him off and brings something new up on the holo, his attention already diverted.  Tony opens his mouth to snap back but Bruce reaches out without looking, pushes a button on the desktop, and the door whooshes closed.
“Vehemently opposed to it.”  Tony smiles, tight-lipped.  Suzanne toddles back with their drinks and Tony raises his eyebrows at Steve over the rim of his mug as he takes a sip of it straight black.  “Basically, all the Avengers would like to know where you are and that you’re safe, but everyone wants to give you your space.  You’re on a team mostly comprised of angsty, anti-social loners.  They think you’ll come back on your own time, when you’re ready.”
Natasha’s jaw ticks, her stare challenging Tony to ask another question.  She moves toward the door to the basement stairs, clearly assuming Tony will follow her.
He glances toward Bucky’s bedroom one more time, looking for assurance that they’ve gotten away with their ill-advised coupling, and finds the door still firmly closed. He allows himself to relax just a little before ducking outside. The late night air is cool in his lungs as he takes a deep breath, but he also inhales a faint, unexpected tinge of cigarette smoke.
been in love with him.”  She smiles at him, even through her tears.  “And I think maybe I always knew that.”
Pepper’s gaze softens in a different way then and he wonders how often she looks at him like that when he’s not paying attention.  He turns from the mirror to face her directly.  She reaches out and runs a hand through his hair and it’s odd, because it feels like she’s trying to comfort
He digs into his third Nathan’s hot dog, handing Tony another as well, which the other man takes with disdain.  It doesn’t stop him from eating it.
Tony abandons rimming Steve to watch Bucky ride Steve’s face, the movement of Steve’s chin and the arch of his throat signaling what he’s so eagerly doing.  Tony knows Steve must taste himself dripping down Bucky’s inner walls and he’s struck by the need to do the same, to taste Steve’s come on the flat of his tongue.
“I’m not…” Steve pulls back slightly, casting his gaze downward.  “Tony, I just thought…” He rubs his hands over his face, getting a streak of paint across his cheekbone.
Neither of them moves immediately, but Fury keeps staring at them, his arm outstretched toward the exit.   Natasha glances toward Bucky and Fury’s good eye twitches.
His fingers itch to disrespect Steve’s boundaries so he glances out the window seeking a diversion, taking in the city as they fly over Roosevelt Island and the Queensboro Bridge.  To his left, the tower fits into a nice little space between the Empire and the Chrysler, slotting into the skyline like it was always meant to be there.
Steve whips his head up so fast his neck wrenches.  He catches a flash of Natasha’s red hair in the mirror before he turns fully around to face her.  His heart pounds wildly in his chest and he has to wonder why in the world she thought it would be a good idea to sneak up on someone recovering from an abduction.
“God, Tony…you’re really fine with this?” Steve hears himself asking before he’s aware he’s thought it. Tony looks up at him, blinking once or twice before slowly pulling off. He smiles softly, a hand pressed comfortingly to Steve’s thigh. The sweet, innocent gesture is undermined by the way Tony’s lips and chin are already shiny with saliva and how his erection is tenting the front of his dress pants. “We’re really okay?”
“Maybe I can talk to her, Tony.  I know this is a dangerous line of work we’re in, but Lukin, the Red Room…they’re after me.  They’re not after you, this doesn’t have to involve Iron Man-“
realize the truth of the matter now, but his worry is for naught. “You at least going to see the girl again?”
They'd been silent since the search for survivors was called off. The flight home was accomplished mostly by JARVIS, via the suit's auto-pilot. The pressure sensors showed that Steve's hands were locked around the built-in grips as securely as ever, but rather than molding himself lovingly as usual against the contours of the metal, the hang of his weight bowed as decidedly far from his armored transport as he could hold himself and not fall out of the sky.
The shrill voice of grievously wronged Kyla, or was it Twyla, on the screen, faded into the background as he concentrated more on staying still and centering his focus on the way Tony was making him feel. Tony was rarely wrong, at least when it came to sex, so if he thought Steve should get some enjoyment from this, then there was probably something to it that he'd missed the first time around.
Steve spoke his name in warning, and laid hands on him, guided him to the bed-platform, and arranged him on his right side. Hypersensitized by sightlessness, Tony was raw to the unfamiliar fiber texture of the sheets, to the foreign tensile factor and deep, sluggish roll of the pseudo-mattress, like a half-congealed waterbed, a slow gravity well, reluctant to conform to the contour of his body.
A hot mouth slipped over the tip of his cockhead where it peeked out of its foreskin, and then enveloped the rest. The head and still-pliable shaft made an easy portion for Tony, who could take him to the root at full mast, purple-red, thick, hard, and thrumming. Thinking it made him itch to get there, and he twitched and filled out a little more, but his imagination alone wasn't enough, not when contradicted by the very immediate lack of physical stimulation.
He waited for no answer, sidled closer and stroked a hand down that rough patch where the lather was already rinsing away. The water had become hotter, and the stall steamier, as he made a show of a shimmy and slanted in to follow the same path with his mouth, and Tony's cock rose to meet him metaphorically halfway.
sex, the freedom of unrestrained lust, the hedonistic joy of burying his body in another, using its power to take pleasure, to give it, to stoke and slake every wanton desire. Plowing into the dense, dark earth, soaking it till it stuck and clodded, sowing his seed in lush, fecund fields.
anymore," Steve spat, low, blunt, and brutal, like there was anything left for force to accomplish. He hadn't even raised his voice. Steve was often many kinds of loud, but that had nothing to do with what made him dangerous.
?" Tony sneered, gesturing with the nearly empty martini glass, then tossing back the last swallow and dashing the glass on the floor in a fountain of shards. The light caught the crystal in a momentary rainbow mosaic. "There,
Tony's shirt had been in tatters from the brawl when they'd been taken, and he didn't need his sight to let its remnants fall to the floor, to toe off his shoes and socks, and to drop his slacks and briefs. He took refuge in the false privacy, hearing rustles that he gathered to be Steve going through the same undressing routine.
She broke her attention away only for long enough to signal the bartender out of his near-camouflage once more. “Put these on my tab, please,” she instructed, with a flick of her hand toward their untouched drinks.
Catlike and slinky, she moseyed over. He could almost see the tail up behind her, twitching at the tip. She reeled him in by the tie, one-handed, then worked the knot a few inches down his neck, and undid his top two buttons, the oval edges of her nails tapping dangerously at his throat. He felt hypersensitized, flushed and broken out in a light sweat, hot under the literal collar.
Did that mean Steve had considered quitting the Avengers? Tony would never have let that happen. He'd quit, himself, before he let Cap leave the team over this. Over anything.
“Last rest stop through the desert, so if you need to do your business… I’m going to use the little girls’--”
He was going to have this once and only once, and he'd never get to feel Steve bare, or be flooded with his come.
Then again, for all the amazing things Tony did, Steve had long since held him in as much esteem as any Avenger. Even though he stayed behind when the Assembles were called, in all the ways that mattered, Tony was one of them.
That was the last of it; he stopped, hand on one black-denimed hip, tapping a toe and chewing distractedly on his upper lip, and studied the object of his dilemma. His erstwhile helper had already retreated back to his station and sat silently,
The world narrowed. Steve was a tangle of inflamed, lit-up nerves, his senses overpowered with hot salt and sex. He could smell and taste it, lick it off his drying lips when he swirled his tongue around to re-wet them, breathing open-mouthed and loud.
, that throaty rasp to her voice, out in the open and hidden from no one, he had done that, too. It was a savory morsel feeding his pride and whetting his hunger even more, making him want to gorge himself on all the ways he could inflame her with his sensual attentions.
As Tony ushered them out the door and into the early afternoon sunlight, it was Steve's turn to mutter. "How do
He flipped her skirt up and stuffed it under some straps, stripping his dick in punishing strokes and grunting roughly till he brute-forced the second, burning orgasm from his balls, pointing himself at her legs and jizz-striping her silk stockings as she stared, open-mouthed.
"Alien LMDs!" Clint broke in. "All part of the setup! Granted, their clients generally know why they're there, and only put up a token protest, so I think you might've done a little more damage than usual, but it's all covered by the deposit!"
For those who took their pleasures with less pampering, there were several corners partitioned off to sequester the sharper gleam of metal, with subtly sloped bare floors to drain the fluid runoffs.
He wrapped his free hand around the back of her head, exerting firm but careful pressure to urge the turn and tilt he wanted. Nosing a few strands of silky hair out of the way up and around the outer arch of her ear, he situated his lips so his breath would blow teasingly across.
of metal on porcelain and the decorous levels of conversation from the few occupied tables blended into an omnidirectional hum, like an indistinct jumble of radio chatter across the frequencies.
"You're a braver man than I, Steve," he’d declared, then hesitated, “just… never let me bring you down. I can’t… a bad influence is the last thing I can stand to be.”
This was obligation. It was penance. But still, Tony grew feverish with the need to be battered fast and merciless, to bottle back his screams till they burned his throat as surely as if he'd shouted himself hoarse. He was that far gone for Steve Rogers, or just that hopelessly perverse, to let his mind transform coercion into his own cheap, sordid fantasy.
Steve shared Tony's shower for the first time the morning after the night he’d shared his bed for the first time.
Wouldn’t want to let a lady feel like she wasn’t wanted. He’d let her set her stage, and she was a fuckin’ showstopper. Looked like time she took a volunteer from this audience of one.
Tony kept on jerking him and sucking in quick, hard pulses, alternating his tongue between underside and crown, rubbing with the flat of it and darting with the tip, lapping up the welling precome. Steve's balls were so full that the touch became a whole new torment when Tony took and rolled them in his other hand, then reached back to press a hard rub behind them. Like a flanking maneuver, it was stars and sparks jolting him from yet another angle, deep within.
He had, not that any earning was actually required. They were both inveterate cuddlers -- it was the most closely held part of their relationship. Between Tony's exhibitionist streak, his own die-hard competitive nature, and the pair of them being raging adrenaline junkies, their friends and teammates had gotten more than one eyeful of sexual escapade.
Steve looked over his shoulder at Tony, seeming not at all surprised to see him so near, which in turn didn't at all surprise Tony, since Steve had almost certainly heard his approach.
He made no protest to Steve withdrawing once more to the dark behind his eyelids. Instead, he reabsorbed the extension creating the mirror screen, blanked his camera feeds and internal visuals, and let the Endo-sym roll a visor across his own eyes, snug over the bridge of his nose. They'd both seen everything they needed to for today.
He tried to push his sluggish, halting thoughts around the edges of what could be affecting Steve exactly this way, but he couldn't process; his mind wouldn't do more than brush against it, just slipped and slid away, like trying to reach through murky water to grasp something else already liquid.
Attired in a crisp, white dress shirt bisected by a slim, silver-grey tie tucked away between two buttons, and matched to the calf-length waist-apron worn over slacks just a shade darker, the bartender looked like a perfectly fabricated embodiment of the ambiance.
Well, come to think of it, that last part, the invitation, was probably just because he'd happened by at the opportune time.
"Ah, sorry about…” He gestured toward the once-glamorous dress, rife with snags, creases, and stains.
Tony really was handsome, fine and well-made, Steve thought for the umpteenth time, but it was his kindness and zest for life that made him more than the flashy painted-wax figurehead Steve had observed during some of the Stark business and media engagements. It was another way he was like the rest of the Avengers, Steve realized. Tony wore a mask and had a dual identity, too, just like any of the superheroes, even if his private self was a different kind of secret than some of theirs. He wasn't wearing that mask now, and Steve allowed himself to bask in the bright warmth and cultivate the flicker of hope that maybe someday, he'd feel like he could quietly inquire if their friendship could grow into anything more.
"Ok, blow me now," their patron requested, slightly breathless. Tony could see his hips starting to twitch restlessly, and from the shifting of his shoulders, he was probably wringing his hands behind his back.
How dispirited his (once? still? he hoped) lover had looked, combing fingers through his hair and working loose his collar and tie, with slowness in his step and dullness in his eyes, and Steve had pushed a plate of Jarvis’s dinner leftovers at him in payment for, “I really need to talk to you.”
Steve's head snapped up and he dragged in his own air as Tony replaced his mouth with a loose, one-handed hold, stroking Steve's red, straining length slow and light, like he knew it might just kill Steve right now to cut the stimulation completely.
"Wake up, old man," Tony barked out, and Steve's lids flew open, his lungs expelling a nearly silent gasp. "How do you like what you see now?"
Steve could tell why he said it. Within a few unfamiliar syllables, he could hear the difference in the way the words flowed like melody from the old man's lips.
And then there was this side of Tony, where his light went out like flicking a switch, and the weariness showed through, and it reminded Steve all over again how very hard Tony worked, giving long hours and all his best, all the time, to both his company and the team. Thank God he
"Mm, thanks for coming down, babe," Tony told him, always heartened by his boyfriend's presence, but concern for DUM-E's well-being still hovering at the forefront of his mind like a warning in the Iron Man HUD.
"You're such a bad influence, Tony, you make me forget everything except you," Steve had done his best to joke. It was good he hadn't fallen as flat on the shower floor.
Meanwhile... why not. He'd indulge. He toed off his shoes and bent up one leg at a time to pull off his socks, balling them up and setting his footwear neatly to the side, before stepping onto the plush pile.
Oversensitized as he was, Tony's tongue felt like wet velvet sandpaper rasping over his engorged shaft, catching every vein and ridge, just shy of starting to abrade. His body prickled all over and his addled brain belatedly caught up to Tony's request for handling. He took Tony's head between his palms, thumbs at his temples, feeling every working of his jaw as Tony set upon him in earnest, bobbing his head up and down on Steve's length, starting shallow, and going a little further every time. Steve took it as encouragement to meet his rhythm, kicking his hips for every increment Tony took him in.
From a door discreetly slotted into the far back corner to their right, a slender, white-haired and dark-suited gentleman emerged to an exuberant greeting. "Mr. Bassat!
He took a visibly deep breath, like he was steeling himself. "Look, sometimes I just need a... a big. Rug."
Having now seen up close the intricate artistry, and thinking of the multitudes of hours involved in their creation, it seemed to Steve a shame to throw any of these on the floor to be trompled upon! But that was their purpose, he supposed, and that was the craft: masterful works of art that also served a practical and worthwhile function.
He gathered the skirt into bunches at the sides and hitched it up; it fell back over his arms as he stuck his hands beneath, smoothing his way up silk-covered thighs to the tops of her stockings. He skimmed his fingers under the bands, slipping them around toward the sensitive skin at the insides, and she shifted in place, trembling minutely and setting loose an unintelligible low sound that rose to a jump and gasp when he pulled at the clipped-on garter straps, giving them a snap.
A coy curve of her lips colored the words in dangerous shades as she proffered a hand. “I feel like I ought to be offended, but honestly, it’s surprisingly refreshing. You’re a breath of fresh air, as well as a tall drink of… soda water.”
Still spinning high, jangling and fizzing with aftershocks, Steve slumped amidst the cushions and took in the compelling scene. Tony was braced on spread knees, wearing a pleasure-pained grimace. Nostrils flaring, and gusting out a symphony of needy, wanting noises, he stroked down his chest and flanks, breaking off to tweak and tug and circle back and forth between one nipple and the other, as he rubbed himself off. Oh, he was a sight, pent up and frenetic, working himself quickly from the get-go and only getting faster from there, only now abandoning his restraint after not touching himself this entire time he'd been taking care of Steve.
Tony just wriggled against him, pressed all down his front, lithe and vital and provocative. "Oh, will you now? Might have to take you up on that, soldier. Not gonna let you sweep that one under the rug!"
me, because I have to--" He removed one hand from the bot's head to jerk his thumb back over his shoulder. "--go get something to make this better. I'm gonna... Look just, stay here and don't go back into charging mode, all right? Pretty, pretty please with quantum processors on top?"
Tony cocked his head in that considering way he had when he was concentrating on a tricky problem. Too bad he couldn't untangle Steve's unstable feelings the way he could sort out the wires and circuits of his exotic electronic gadgets.
He took a deep, shaky breath, and then another, pulling out and pressing back in, slowly. Such an easy, easy slide, but perfectly close and snug, the sharp, bright pleasure centered in his cock, and buzzing and tingling outward to every extremity.
An even more agreeable sight was the way the cords of Tony's forearms tightened, his shoulders and biceps rounded out against his shirt sleeves, and the middle button gaped a tiny bit, as he upheld his share of their load.
Tony was fine with letting Steve continue to handle this from here. He wished he could put the blindfold back on.
Of all the breadth of his sexual adventures it was the unspoken threshold he never crossed. But fuck, he couldn’t help but be led, just a footstep, into the deep, dark, well of temptation. “I…
The charred, blackened thing he still wore was what should have been his wedding suit. Tattered and singed, its once-fine weave was caulked with a stomach-roiling charnel taste and stench, with patches of weeping, raw flesh showing through like innards. Viscera, exposed by what had burned and crumbled away.
"Glad to be here," Steve reciprocated, and meant it. Even cloaked in a mysterious objective, Tony's enthusiasm was infectious. Steve was smiling broadly, and in fact, didn't mind a bit. If he'd been destined to leave his old life behind with the ice, he would forever be thankful it had been Tony and the team who'd found him, and invited him to share the momentous and madcap adventures of the Avengers.
"Remember how we used to talk, Steve, how we'd hope and plan? That dream of growing old together?" He manifested an extension of the armor in front of them, a shimmering plate of silver showing their heads pressed close, a distorted reflection of a distorted reflection. "How's that happy ending looking now, hmmm?"
Himself, he worked in mediums that mixed and changed with the days: watercolors rippling in soft, crystal depths for his eyes; bold, brash acrylics for the armor's gloss and shine; and oils, with their pungency, for building up rich subtleties in layers, the patina of the complicated man he’d come to know.
Idly, Tony hefted a couple of axes and a mace, more than anything, just to have something solid in his hands, the reassurance of metal. Decently forged and balanced, he found, despite even the weight and sheen of the alloys feeling subtly off. Looking up, he saw Steve, across from him, doing the same.
They were given a private chamber to deliberate and then act upon their choice. The centerpiece of the suite was a massive platform covered in layers of rich-looking fabrics, not quite, but resembling closely enough to be called, a bed. Investigating further, an unobtrusive door led to an "outside" courtyard area where a lawn of not-quite green not-quite grass bordered a flat oval of hard-packed not-quite dirt. Several racks of melee weapons lined the perimeter.
He closed his eyes and this time, he saw the red of Tony’s cheeks as they stood looking at the snow, and the quirk of Tony’s smile. The way he laughed as he spun through the air in the Iron Man armor.
In the past year, he’d been to more places, experienced more things than he ever had when he’d been alive. And what was the purpose of it all? He knew the Avengers had acted to move him on from this half-existence but as nothing had worked, this objective had fallen to the wayside. There was never any burning desire in Steve to do anything, want anything - nothing like what Class Four ghosts should feel. Steve had started to just enjoy the moment. And those moments had, of late, become moments with just Tony.
They stopped outside an imposing concrete building sunken into the ground on the outskirts of a small town. Tony dropped out of the parked vehicle with careful grace and Steve was allowed to leave a moment later when the magnets on the anklets of his feet freed their hold.
Bucky considered for a moment, then leans over to poke Steve in the stomach. Steve lets out an undignified yelp at the cold finger and rolls into a more upright position. Better.
There was silence from the speakers and Tony fidgeted with the hem of his sleeve as he waited, hands itching for anything to distract him from an answer he was dreading.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw a blur of red, white and blue. He turned to smile in greeting when he saw what was in Steve’s hands.
“I knew you wouldn’t,” Stark said, and Steve felt himself being eyed critically from behind the sunglasses. “You don’t quite look the type. Didn’t like the pet names, and you know who I am; believe it or not, I’m not usually the one dishing the groping when I’m draped over someone.”
Through his cameras, Tony saw her shoot a dozen stingers onto the chicken then dash away as it roared in what was probably pain. Three of Clint’s arrows flew over the chicken and four arcs of light connected to the stingers from four arrows embedded around the chicken. The chicken squawked again and fell heavily to the ground under the proton streams. His new gear was working like a charm. Good, because the old proton packs may have worked for the original Ghostbusters but they were ghastly and impractical for people like Natasha and Clint.
Tony felt his hand open and the Soul Stone dropped away. He was tugged backwards, away from the light, through the planes of existence and when he opened his eyes again, he was alone in the lab by Steve’s shield and the two relics that had started all this and brought him here.
Looked like Plan A didn’t work. Tony tapped his knuckles on the shield’s surface then reached up to remove the Tesseract from the seal of the Containment Unit. “Knock, knock. Time to feast.”
Steve looked up, alarmed, but Tony’s expression was relaxed, calm. The warm tingling was travelling up Steve’s arm to the rest of his body, racing through his veins, and he brought his other hand up to cup at the vibranium core, his anchor, Tony’s
Tony sobered up immediately. “I’m my own boy, thank you very much.” He signalled for JARVIS to keep the Mark VI on standby and then dropped himself into the armchair by the bed. If this was actually a lucid dream or a hallucination, he was going to make the best out of it. “How’d you get here? Have you always been around? How well did you actually know Howard—“
Tony waited for him to continue but there was only more silence. “Steve?” he tried after a worrying amount of time passed without anything further from Steve.
Having no feeling for temperature, Steve hadn’t realized just how cold it had been, especially at their altitude in the Tower. It was only after Tony had sneezed three times in succession that Steve had realized the redness of Tony’s cheeks and nose, and how he had been shivering in his single layer of clothing. Feeling like a heel, he’d urged Tony inside against all protests of being fine. He couldn’t even have given Tony his coat because he didn’t wear a coat, and even if he did, it would have fallen through Tony and not done a damn thing for the cold anyway.
Tony snorted like the gentleman he wasn’t. “If only.” He pulled back his hand, showing Steve how the catches opened and closed. “See this,” he said, pointing to the braces, “It’ll hold and hide anything solid that fits this size. You’d think a gun under the sleeve perhaps, but I’m working on something a little less lethal, with a wider distribution of force. Should be good for controllin’ mobs once I refine my designs. But that was what blew down my walls and the shed.”
The scene flashes before Steve can respond and they are standing in a cemetery, surrounded by row upon neat row of white tombstones. Steve recognizes this; they’re in Arlington but he doesn’t know which section.
“Same as Sam. Nada,” Bucky says. He turns to gesture at a passing waiter. “Steve has the worst case of Ugly Duckling Syndrome I have ever encountered.” The waiter returns with a glass of water and Bucky thanks him, taking a sip before continuing. “If I had a guy like Tony come after me I’d—“ and he shuts up, a horrified expression crossing his face. Rhodey muffles his laughter in his own drink and Sam and Clint laugh outright and then try to cover it up by drinking.
are too much of a paranormal target for SHIELD to risk having millions of spirits near. You’re still only a consultant for PLASM and—”
Steve tried to contort his face into something stereotypically old and Tony burst out laughing, heedless of the curious glances from the PLASM support teams that had swarmed in for clean-up. Tony hadn’t let out a good hearty laugh for weeks and weeks and his stomach almost ached at the uncontrollable tremors that ran through him. Steve laughed with him and it didn’t matter whether or not Steve was corporeal in these moments.
“How did Steve get his shield?” Tony asked the obvious, mind unable to come up with anything else. “How did
There was something fumbling between his legs, and he gasped at the pressure against his groin. Breaking the kiss, Tony looked between them to see Steve pushing his own pants down and freeing his impressive erection. The sight of it leaking and flushed was almost enough to make Tony come then and there.
He was devising a plan to get a few contained spirits out of the Containment Unit when he stepped into the conference room behind Spengler and didn’t immediately notice that the room was dead silent despite the presence of his team as well as Fury and Hill. He looked up and saw everyone with their heads turned, staring straight at him.
Bruce quirks an eyebrow; he knows. In addition to the shrill emails from Tony, he also gets a number of almost diary-like ones that were clearly the result of serious pining. He nods. “I’ll see what I can do.”
There was one man he was constantly near, one man who filled gorgeous bespoke suits in ways that made Steve forget his own name, one man who could make Steve's heart beat too fast just by fingering the pearly buttons of a Zegna waistcoat. One man who loved spending his time in t-shirts or loose hoodies or tight-fitting tank tops or – not that Steve could complain too much – sleek red-and-gold metal.
Steve feels himself fading out into the numbness of the cold. The thing that is wearing Tony’s face beats on the ice over Steve’s face, desperation in every pounding of his fists.
He felt his heart pound again at the memory of a moment ago, at the sight of the tan of Tony’s skin, and the small dips of bone and muscle at his hip. He raised a hand to his chest and pressed hard but couldn’t feel anything there. Phantom physiology, Bruce had called it, not unlike living people feeling their missing limbs.
The smoldering ruins of the train was over a mile behind him. Steve could still see the grey smoke rising, signalling to everyone in a ten mile radius. Better the smoke cloud back there than a smoke cloud hovering over the ruins of Timely. Fisk was a child in that regard; that man would destroy all that he couldn't control. And like a child, the plan to run a train full of explosives through Timely was ludicrous yet frightfully simple. Unlike a child, Fisk also had goons to guard the train against Steve's meddling.
The Avengers had been called out for a Class Six Stampede earlier in the day. Steve was no stranger to animals in the street but this had been more disruptive than anything he had ever seen. Perhaps mostly because the animals were of the zoo variety and lion ghosts leaping into stores had not been met with much enthusiasm.
Steve definitely couldn’t take it anymore. He stood and spun Tony back around to face the desk, and he ground into Tony’s ass, letting Tony feel the sharp line of his zipper over his hard cock, his belt, the rough fabric of his pants. Tony moaned and pressed back. Steve reached down to hold his hips in place, then undid his own pants just enough to free his straining cock. He pressed his hips back to Tony’s, letting his cock settle between the cheeks of Tony’s ass, and rubbed himself into the wetness of the lubricant.
Bruce pats Thor on the awkwardly on the arm; Loki was still a touchy subject. “I’m sure your mother taught him equally well.”
“Wow,” Tony said, still breathless. “I didn’t know I needed that on my bucket list but apparently I do.”
, because that’s about the only thing you’ve demanded of me. Tell you everything. Defer to you. You said you were
Bruce realizes his mouth is gaping open and he closes it with a click, reaching up to take his very clean, very clear glasses off to wipe on his shirt. As he flicks his eyes down to his glasses, he sees Steve’s hand shift to where it is now more or less gripping Tony’s ass. Bruce chokes on air and Steve, evidently having sensed why, lets go of Tony with a start. Tony yelps but clings on to Steve, knees tightening visibly around Steve’s hips and arms moving to circle around Steve’s neck.
There was a pause, and Steve made his way around to the front of the couch, looking down at Tony who was slumped against the opposite armrest, face plate down.
Steve shook his head. “Let him be,” he said. “It’s been a tough year fer him.” And Steve meant it. Tony should have the opportunity to let some new roots take hold. Steve knew Tony had had a huge part to play in the fall of the Confederate army towards the end of the War. The man didn’t like to speak of the War, just like Steve or Bucky or any other soldier here didn’t like to speak of the War, but Steve could read like any other and the rifles he’d wielded against the South were all branded STARK. Steve could add the ones to get two.
He shifted to balance himself then brought his hand down to cup the bulge in Stark's pants, giving it a firm rub. Stark whined – so
A wave of red light bloomed in a dome from the kid, washing over everything on the streets and over Tony’s hovering form in the air. Tony’s filters couldn’t keep the light out and by the time he managed to blink away the spots in his vision, the kid was gone.
Steve recovered and offered a small smile in return. "Farewell. Thank you for everything. For me, for Bucky."
Tony’s hand was petting lightly at his hair. The other hand was now rubbing circles over the one Steve had over his chest. Steve buried his face into Tony’s neck, breathing in the scent of
He pushed away from the wall and left the room. He heard his name being called behind him but he ignored it and kept walking towards the hangar, swiping the emergency sequence on his phone and calling JARVIS for the suit.
“Might I suggest you take some nutrients first, sir?” JARVIS enquired. At the same time, U wheeled over with a large cup of green smoothie and a cheeseburger on a tray.
“Thank you,” Steve said after a moment. “I’m just glad you’re sleeping well again. And alive.” He paused, a twinkle appearing in his eye, a corner of his mouth lifted in a smirk. “I figured you for a fantasy buff. It was fun.”
He spun Tony around again and with a hand looped around the end of Tony's tie, he dragged Tony down until he was bent low, legs straight, hands braced on the pole, ass in the air, exposed. The game transformed. Tony was now egging Steve on, an endless stream of filth pouring from his mouth as he shivered from head to toe, the tension and heat rolling off of him with every broken plea that punctuated the filth.
"We need assurances you won't just turn us over," the Captain said. "Wakanda signed the Accords and we need to know you won't just drop us on Ross's doorstep."
Tony smiled. “It didn’t have it, because I had a piece of it, and I traded a piece of mine for it. Gave it to you. Made you whole again.” A spasm tore up Tony’s left arm, from the Stone, and Tony couldn’t help but cry out at the pain. Shit, he couldn’t keep this up. He tried to drop the Stone, but….
. Tony didn’t know how he’d managed to resist it before but this was like a dam breaking and he wasn’t going to resist it anymore.
Slowly, as if weighted in lead, Tony reached up and took Steve’s hand in a stiff handshake, feeling the tingle of warmth radiating from Steve’s palm and into his own. Tony had always thought that Steve would have callused hands and he hadn’t been mistaken. He was touching Steve. Outside of a dream. He almost expected his hand to fall through but
“Hypothetically speaking,” Bruce begins, as they wander towards the library. He knows (from Tony) that Steve likes the quiet there. Chances are he’s reading or drawing if he isn’t actively training. “Is Steve the mother or the father of the Avengers? And would that make Tony the mother or the father when they get around to it?”
Steve sat back into the chair and waited. The leather squeaked as he shifted but otherwise, like all of Tony’s things, it felt comfortable. Secure.
There was another muffled grunt and Tony could hear the sounds of skin rubbing along slick skin. “I’d like that, thanks.”
The burning numbness had taken all his senses but Tony could feel the barest brush of lips on his. A trickle of strength bled into him at the touch and he felt the numbness recede, just a little, and he relished the fleeting feeling of warmth on his lips. He squeezed his eyes closed and nodded again, willing his grip on the Soul Stone to loosen.
At the end of the night—in the early morning—Jim is unfortunately more drunk than tipsy. The result of having maybe too much of a good time with his best friend. Especially after Tony started requesting the fancier drinks.
Steve opens his mouth in question but is pushed aside by Pepper Potts, Tony’s ex-personal assistant, current CEO of Stark Industries.
“Tony,” Steve cut in, voice a rasp. He pulled off his blue helmet in one fluid movement and tore open the front of his own star spangled uniform revealing a sweat soaked chest to Tony. “Bed. Now.” He licked his lips, his darkened eyes boring into Tony's. Tony’s mouth went dry.
Except Tony should be in the car behind Steve. Steve turned and saw Bruce in the car, ripping open Tony’s shirt to bare the broken arc reactor. He turned back.
had walked the streets to fight off a giant blob of slime. Once again, a group of middle-aged men had saved the city. Tony, finally, after the death of his parents and Jarvis, had read up all he could of the paranormal. He had hoped, maybe, to see them again.
“Tony,” Steve said firmly. “I knew exactly how your chest would have looked, with the scarring, and now I do know how it looks. Nothing more.” With that, he sat down and pointedly looked between Tony and the bed.
Natasha nudges at Rhodey to make room for her in the booth and she sits down, arranges her dress, and then clasps her hands in front of her. Clint joins them moments later, new drinks in hand which he hands to everyone.
Steve stopped pretending to ignore the man and looked up from staring at his knees. Stark had his Face on, the one of insouciant detachment. It was a face he usually fronted for people he didn’t like.
Thor laughs. “My guess is that this is for the final movement of Natasha’s very devious plans in ‘getting the estranged parents of the Avengers together’?”
T'Challa looked between the man's face and his armored hand. "They won't know. And Wakanda will stop them easily if they come. Will
There were no clouds, no rain, no thunderstorm to punctuate the moment when it had happened. There were none of the protesters denouncing Captain America as a hero of their nation, no radicals calling for the blood of the rogue capes, no adoring fans screaming their love for Iron Man. Captain America was not the hero but the villain. Captain America had brought destruction and fear to a country, a world full of people who had believed in him. Iron Man had been the poor hero who’d tried to stop the Captain’s rampage and had only barely survived to emerge as the savior and victor.
At the helicarrier, Tony stowed his armor in his ready room and lugged the Trap with him towards Lab 03. The thing was heavy, even with the weightless slime, and in his somewhat exhausted state he appreciated Natasha’s work with these things even more. He had about ten minutes before the rest of the team arrived for debrief.
“You would have been back to your buff self in no time. Punching out grocery store robbers with ease. Wouldn’t that have been better?”
“Hello darling,” Tony said, voice rough, and Steve himself stopped breathing. And he would blame that for why he was subsequently pulled down to clash lips with Tony for only a briefly wet and rather unsatisfying two seconds before Tony was out cold, yet again, beneath him.
He was holding a piece of Steve’s soul. Tony closed his eyes at the surge of emotion. He needed to bring Steve back.
Steve can’t see Tony’s expression but he sees Tony reach out slowly and take the pen and paper, writing a long message and signing it with care before handing it back.
Tony felt the warm hands on his back and waist tighten, and he clung on, burying his face into Steve’s neck again. He realized then that his cheeks were wet and he started laughing. He giggled louder, even as Steve pulled back. Steve’s thumbs swiped through the wetness on his cheeks and Tony reached up to press Steve’s hands tighter to his face.
A faintly glowing and definitely transparent entity moved toward him through the low light of the morning and Tony could finally make out a tall, broad-shouldered figure in what was distinctly a full Captain America costume. It looked human, seemed to be lucid, wasn’t immediately trying to kill Tony, not affected by the Mansion’s general security, and did not trip JARVIS’s sensors. Was it not a classified entity? What the
Stark could have played it up, could have exposed his face, could have had his arm in a sling, could have been using a cane or crutch like he clearly needed to. They could have paraded Steve in public, in front of the people, the “fans”, but no. They were being driven in a nondescript, armored vehicle to an undisclosed location where Steve could be held until his trial. Held, or maybe made to disappear. Steve wouldn’t put it past Stark to do the latter, but Steve himself was a man of his word and he wouldn’t pull any tricks to escape; he’d earned his place in this car and he knew it.
“Since we’re both single fellas on Valentine’s Eve,” Steve continued, palms sweating a little as he ploughed on, “want to join me for dinner? Or we can plan something nice for tomorrow if you think you’re up for it.” He stood still and waited for Stark to come to a decision, hoping he didn’t just make a huge damn idiot of himself.
“You get better every day, Wanda," Vision says with indulgence in every word, "and you sell yourself rather short. If I were to make an analogy, I would say that you are already a butterfly, merely beginning to stretch your wings.”
Jim nods, ignoring the last part, not even pretending anymore. “Good authority, Tones. Any more desperate flimsy excuses?” He leans forward, making sure Tony is looking at him before he continues. “You deserve to have something for yourself in your life, Tony. You deserve to be happy. And if you both happen to want this, why wouldn’t you just try? At least try?”
Tony snaps his mouth shut and narrows his eyes at Jim. Jim takes one of the glasses the bartend slides before them and takes a long sip.
“Sorry,” Tony said quickly, and accelerated towards where Thor had been. Natasha and Clint, wrapped in each of his arms, would be able to handle the G forces.
Tony tugged and Steve followed. They walked down the street, hand in hand, and no one was fazed by the sight.
When he started feeling light-headed, he pulled off and fell forward to rest his forehead on Tony's heaving belly. He felt a soothing hand running through his hair as he caught his own breath. He thought he did a stellar job, all around.
“My plans are for leisure this day,” Thor says, and accepts a hug from Sharon, lifting her off her feet in the process.
Certainty One was straining under new evidence, Certainty Two was thriving under new evidence, and Certainty Three was something Tony had to keep with him despite everything. Tony had gone through non-consensual body modification. Tony had gone through death by palladium. Tony had literally just gone through death by soul removal. And now, he was facing the reality of souls.
When the Trap finally closed, Tony let his arms drop to his sides with a thump and looked up at the landing Quinjet. He shoved the Trap off of him and stood to shake the grass off the suit. His poor suit - newly machined and already filthy. Bruce had made his way over to inspect the Trap with the Energy Meter as usual. Tony was about to head to the Quinjet to find Steve when Bruce stood abruptly from his inspection.
“That's all, right?” Tony spoke up, pushing away a surge of panic. “Can I go back to work now?” Tony Stark, dodging the emotional confrontation like only he could.
Tony was standing stock still but there was something like relief in the line of his armored shoulders.
“It was going to get it either way. It was either you or me. And I’m already dead. It wasn’t even a choice. If I can help, why shouldn’t I?”
“We found it,” Fury said simply. “Picked up Howards old search missions and went from there. We only found it a few days ago, and only the shield.”
He eyed the pitted plank of wood Stark was resting his head on. Taking a quick mental inventory of himself, Steve settled on his hat and looped it over his head from his back. He lifted Stark's head gently, the dark curls of hair tickling his palms, and placed the hat underneath. "Hold on to my hat, darlin'," he murmured.
“Love is a human emotion,” ghost-Tony said in an unfamiliar tone. He walked towards Steve as if floating through honey. “But it is powerful and it would have made a good brother.” He stopped right before Steve, a foot away, and smiled with a tilted head. It was unnatural, but somehow familiar even on Tony’s features. And Steve knew where he’d seen it before.
Smiling around his mouthful of heated skin, he closed his eyes, cast away the rickety iron rails and the red desert around them, ignored the almost painful tightness of his own pants, and focused on the taste of Tony.
"I thought he was drunk, you know," Stark interrupted. There was no change in his sunken expression but his eyes were cast to the ground now. He turned away before he spoke again. "I thought he was drunk, when they died." He shifted on the ground and the groan of scraping metal punctuated the air before he settled again. "I knew there was a cover-up. I thought it was his blood alcohol concentration. It would've taken away from the grand tragedy of the story and they couldn't have that. Obie couldn't—SHIELD couldn't. They couldn't have that."
Tony beams at him. “I need dad to give me better materials and machines. I want to give Jarvis something that looks nice.” Without another word, Tony drags Steve by the hand through another series of winding corridors, ending up in front of a heavy set of wooden doors. Tony hesitates at the door but Steve urges him on. Tony visibly steels himself with all his seven-year-old determination and he pushes open the doors.
Steve’s cheeks reddened, actually reddened, and he looked away. “I’m sorry. It’s how I’ve been entering your dreams, I think. The light always changes after every haunting and I always had to make sure.
Steve continued to look unconvinced, guilt now dominating his features. Tony sighed and rubbed at his forehead.
“Captain,” Tony said, still looking down at the hem of his jacket, “I believe the meeting is in Room Five.” He stuffed his hand into his pocket and lifted his head, unable to resist seeing Steve’s face once more. Cap had lowered his hand but didn’t make to move anywhere. “If this is a consultation visit, my official consulting hours are—“
“Wow,” Tony says under his breath, “I would have thought that my dreams would erase Pepper’s terrible taste in art.”
There was silence from the speakers and Tony tried hard to listen for any sign of life from Steve and to ignore the fact that Steve had been
Steve knew about the defence system, and Steve also knew that Tony had been working on it for almost two years. The protonic energy Tony must use would harm Tony’s person as well given the nature of the hauntings. Steve knew all that, because Tony himself had said it, shown it to him. Steve had never wanted to shake another person as much as he did Tony right then. Tony needed a shaking.
Steve should be angry. Steve should be wary. Tony had finally let him in on the Illuminati’s activities but Tony had also proven that he could still hide things from Steve; he could hide things no longer as innocuous as a secret identity. Steve shouldn’t even be here, but all he could think of was how he couldn’t remember the feel of Tony pressed close to him all those years ago. He couldn’t remember the brush of Tony’s hand across his neck. He couldn’t remember how warm Tony could run. He couldn’t quite remember the low hum of the armor when it had been plastered to his side.
,” Tony said, incredulous. “My sound and camera filters have filters. Hermetically sealed and all that jazz.” He turned to Steve and thumped at his own chest, right over the arc reactor. “I’m fine. I’ll be fine. I promise.”
It took him two attempts to open the door, his mind fuzzy from the punch and from the party high and general tiredness from a job well done. The door swung open and he stumbled in. The kid really did a number on him because he felt so disoriented for a second – everything seemed out of place and his bed wasn’t where he felt it should have been. Nevertheless, he did manage to find it and he sat down, rubbing the melting peas soothingly all over his face and then flopped onto his back.
Tony barked out a laugh as he rode through a particularly hard buck. He grabbed onto Steve's hat on his head, ropes still trailing from his wrist, and planted the other hand flat on Steve's chest. "Nuthin’ firmer than a blacksmith's hands."
“I was thinking about taking you out somewhere nice tomorrow,” Tony said at last. “Wherever you want. Just the two of us.”
“The blob’s been eating up my arrows and Tasha’s stings like cotton candy. I’m out of Anti-Slime Slime arrows.” He fired another Waterfall Arrow at the blob. “Tasha’s ETA’s two minutes.”
Steve laughs and holds up a hand, pushing back the twinge of pain in his heart from the memories of Bucky. Small Tony is no less talkative than Adult Tony. “Bucky is definitely one of the bravest and most caring but I want to tell you about Iron Man.”
"A big baldy with a bowler hat got to me," Stark said, conversational. "I managed to get to the Bartons before he knocked me down, tied me up, then left me here and rode on towards you. Did you see him, by chance?"
Bruce smiles and they step onto the landing for the recreating floor. He looks up at Thor. “Kitchen?”
“Stone, I know you never got over me but fucking me by proxy is a new low,” Stark shot back, apparently finding his voice. “If you’ll excuse me, I have a date with someone I actually want to be with without compromising myself as a decent human being.”
Steve lets Tony pull him along the corridor by a small but firm grip. Tony must be around seven or eight, Steve thinks. There is still some baby fat around his cheeks. They make numerous turns, too numerous to be practical, and they end up in what looks to be a very small version of adult Tony’s workshop. Small Tony takes him to a small bench, patting the floor at Steve. Steve sits and waits.
Tony knew three certainties in his life: one, that the scientific method prevailed, mostly; two, that anything was possible; and three, that despite the time and space that had separated them, he got to meet Captain America, meet Steve Rogers, and call him a friend.
And so they sat on each side of the bars and Tony taught Steve rummy whilst Steve went over his plans for dealing with the new surge of raiders.
Steve opened his eyes and turned to the voice. Tony was seated on the armchair like it was a throne. Legs crossed and hands draped over the armrest. He smiled when he saw Steve lift his head.
Tony scrambled over his bed and moved to stand beside Cap with his arms outstretched. “It’s Captain America’s Ghost. Really. I would know.”
He strained against the hands, thrashing, but it only invited claws to dig into his mouth and press sharply on his tongue. He shook his head violently, wincing when they pressed in harder, gagging when they surged into his throat.
The warmth beneath his palm was growing hotter with every movement, stronger, surging through his arms and the rest of his body in waves of almost unbearable heat. It felt so wholesome, so
Steve smiles at that. This is just like Tony. Except the blushing - but this is a dream so Steve is going to ignore it out of politeness. And ignore it even more because he wants to feel the heat of the blush beneath his palm, which he thinks might be just a little bit too far even for a dream. “Crushing the moment with sex jokes again?”
Steve lunged forward, all semblance of calm evaporating in an instant. His shoulder connected with the
When Steve had been young - shorter than everyone, louder than anyone, and sicklier than an entire hospital ward - he had been certain of the one thing in life: he would probably not live beyond his teenage years, despite the tender care of his mother, and he’d never looked far into the future beyond vague concepts and general wants and desires. Even through his victories against HYDRA, he’d never thought anything more than what it was they had to do next to win the war.
Whoa, okay. This is something these two are going need to work through together by themselves. “You know how he feels about being an Avenger, Steve. He’s still working through the Ultron mess and—“
“Alright, people,” Steve called. “Thor, take Clint to high ground. Tony, fetch the Trap and take position above the blob.”
Steve couldn't resist. He stilled his movements and pulled Tony down for a wet kiss, allowing Tony to reach between them to unbuckle his belt at long last.
They’d done the easiest first and visited all the graves of the people he knew whom he had left behind; people of sentimental importance. He had gone to Howard’s grave first, given his anchor to the material in Tony’s chest that had been a part of his shield. He’d visited Dum-Dum’s grave. Dernier’s grave. Jones’ grave. Morita’s grave. Falsworth’s grave. Heck, even Colonel Phillips’s grave. Bucky’s parent’s graves. He’d still visited his parent’s grave and Bucky’s grave even though they had been the ones who had left him behind, but he couldn’t bear to not see Bucky again, even if it had been as part of a granite memorial.
T'Challa gave Stark one long, last look, then nodded in farewell and left for his own jet. They both had too much work to do to dwell on personal loss just yet. He still made sure to see the trackers he placed on Zemo and the Iron Man both fly away together at high speed before he set his full concentration on returning home, two runaways in tow.
After lunch, Sam and Sharon insist on cleaning up by themselves and Bruce takes Thor along to look for the elusive Steve.
His methods were sound - he had the evidence - and unlike his dad, he wasn’t going to lose Steve. The rest of the Avengers and PLASM were currently in the streets of New York, responding to the sudden outbreak of hauntings. Tony had convened with them at the helicarrier, collapsed, and then the sirens had become endless and they had left. Tony had stayed behind, here. He knew what he might have to do and no one was going to talk him out of this.
It was like that now. That was now the fate of every one of Tony's suits but it wasn't like Tony ever wore them twice anyways. It wasn't like they were a complete loss even after they were stained. Steve did his best to clean them off once he got them off of Tony. And most of them came back from the dry cleaners without question and in pristine condition, ready to be passed on should Tony choose. Tony accused him of driving his poor tailors and cleaners to drink from the extra work. Steve had no grounds to argue against it.
When Starnes started listing the damages to Steve, Tony simply offered to build a better shed but he was met with an aloof upturn of a rather high nose.
Tony let out a strangled yell, hand twisting in Steve's hair. Steve swallowed around the hot stretch in his throat and earned himself another yell. He pulled back a little and started a ruthless pace, moving up and down Tony's cock until his saliva started pooling and easing the way for him. The slick sound of skin sliding on skin grew louder and louder with every bump of Tony's cock at the back of his throat and Tony's hand wound tighter and tighter in his hair.
Steve took out the bread and oats, then rolled the grocery bag up and tucked it into his bag drawer. He considered his empty hands, then turned to the electric kettle to pour some water for tea except it was cold and empty. Right.
Tony smiles at him through the mirror, face gaunt and eyes shadowed. “They’ve been finding me,” Tony says, voice pained. “The more I think about it, the more they come. I don’t have the right to keep refusing them,” he swipes at the cuts over his collarbone. “They’re not wrong.”
It quite literally opened doors, too. Steve gained access to Tony's closet. The size of a small apartment, it was like a treasure trove and Steve didn't know how to handle it. The first time Tony asked him to go pick out a different tie for him because they were running too short on time for him to change into an evening suit, Steve stood there in the 'closet' and took in the entire section of suits and ties and shoes and shirts and sat down on the nearest bench to control his thoughts and his very ill-timed flash of arousal. And when Tony wandered in five minutes later, creamy white shirt undone at the collar beneath a slate gray Tom Ford ensemble in a cut which accentuated his hips, Steve lost it completely.
Tony came with a cry, muscles taut and back arching. Steve felt the rush of hot semen down his throat and he squeezed his eyes closed as Tony twitched in his mouth and came and came.
Steve gestured at the paper littering his desk. “I gotta write all this out and get it to Murdock.” He smiled at Tony. “And then I can let you out in the morning to start with the compensations.”
“A million turkeys died in their sleep to manifest this,” Tony said. “And it all ended up in a giant chicken.” He banked hard to the left to dodge the swipe and put a good fifty meters between himself at the Colonel, studying the field. “Distraction didn’t distract enough, Clint. Got anything else, Cap?”
“No P.K.E.,” Clint said, fingers flexing on the Wand, “but you’ve got five seconds before I try to shoot it with everything I’ve got on my back.”
It was a joy with Tony being open to the Avengers about being Iron Man. It was a fixture of Steve’s life; the way Tony outside of the armor would tuck his fingers under the collar of Steve’s shirt, the way Tony’s sleep-slowed breath brushed across Steve’s shoulder, and the way Tony sometimes threw a leg over Steve’s thigh as if trying to get closer to Steve than he already was. Steve knew it all now, the little secrets of Tony’s life, and he cherished them as he built his life with this man and with the Avengers.
“Very true,” Thor says, “though I wished my father would have shared his wisdom of war with my brother as he did with me.”
Clint activated the small explosives embedded into the tanks. The tanks blew open on the side facing the blob and spilled the yellow Anti-Slime Slime around it. The blob trembled and let out a low pitched keen.
He turns with the shield’s momentum and puts a few feet between himself and the Skull in the Valkyrie’s bridge.
“Tony, you didn’t show at the shareholder’s meeting today,” Pepper says immediately. “I should have expected as much given the party last night, but if it wasn’t for Obadiah, it could have gone horribly. Don’t miss the Board of Directors meeting.” She doesn’t wait for Tony to reply before continuing, checking an item off the list in her arms as she speaks. “Jackson from MedTech needs his proposal either approved or rejected. You’re the one who hired him. He said he would only deal with you. And this is why we don’t let you hire people.” Another check. “Dahlia called again about the engine. She wants to know if you were serious about the collaboration. I told her you were. She said she wants to talk details with you. I scheduled a call for Tuesday.” Another check—
“I’m Captain America,” the entity said without further preamble. “Went down in ’45. Probably died and I guess I’m a ghost now. Don’t know how I got here but I’m glad I did when I did.”
There was a choking sound from the bathroom and Steve took a few hurried steps toward the door in alarm. Did Tony trip? He hadn’t exactly been dry when he came out in just a short towel—
Tony nodded, and then shook his head, clearing the ringing from his ears. “Hey, Steve. Welcome back.” He tried to smile up at Steve and he thought it came out cheerful. “Got you away from the thing, the Soul Stone,” he held up his left arm, or tried to, showing Steve the green glow from between his fingers. “Don’t do stupid things like sacrificing your soul for me. You were just going to leave me like that? Did you ever consider what I’d feel about it?”
“I’m graceful,” Pietro mutters, “or else I’d trip on rocks and break my nose every time I run. Or run into walls. I can be graceful. People just don’t see it… It’s not that special. And I can fly. It’s more like being in the air for a long time before hitting ground but I can fly.”
The thought was like salt on his wounds and he gripped the hair tighter, pulling out strands, and stroked roughly at the bloody, gouged cheeks. The teeth-baring screams cleared Steve’s thoughts and memories for a second, grounding him again.
Steve claimed Tony’s wandering lips in a sweet kiss and then he took his partner, his friend, his lover, his sweetheart, back to their home for the holidays.
“I’m fine,” Tony said harshly. And he was. He felt more rejuvenated and energized than he had since… since as long as he remembered. It had all been because of that damned
“Tony,” Steve said at last, voice breathless. “Why am I outside and why won’t you let me in? Aren’t we—can’t we—do this together? Aren’t we supposed to do this together?”
“Nuh-uh, Stark. The last time there was a Containment Unit in the streets of New York, we had city-wide pandemonium when it failed and
Tony Stark, Steve learned, could be surprising and thoughtful. Steve found himself in the Smithsonian on what he'd thought was a whim of Tony's. He didn't particularly enjoy walking through the World War Two exhibit, but he was happy all the same that the men and women who'd braved their lives were remembered here. That his Commandoes were remembered, that Bucky was remembered, and that Peggy was honored. That wasn't the surprise. The surprise was going to the display about himself, about Captain America, and finding, on a mannequin in a newly erected glass case, a familiar beige suit.
Tony didn’t know how to answer that. He released the catches for the helmet and he pulled it off, shaking his hair out. He turned to Steve and raised an eyebrow. “Isn’t it always? Pity this one’s gone, though,” he nudged the Trap with a clang of his armored foot, “I just wanted to keep one of them as leverage for Fury to authorize a full Containment Unit for the Tower. I refuse to believe those things are magic.”
All in all, it hadn’t exactly played out like a routine Villain Beat-Down. The last thing any of them had expected, other-worldly Thor included, was a teenaged tantrum followed by something Tony still didn’t have a handle on. He wasn’t calling it magic, that was for sure.
“Tiberius Stone, CEO of Viastone – yeah the media and tech conglomerate,” Stark said woodenly. “I should rub it in his face that you know mine and not his but then he wasn’t the rich American CEO who was held in a dingy Afghan cave for three months.” Stark turned back to face Steve, fingers tapping against his own biceps, mouth thin. “Us rich kids know each other. We used to, hm, date is a strong word but we had a thing. Fell out. I hate him. He wants to hate me. We dig at each other when we see each other. It’s all good fun. You’re not going to go to the nearest journalist with
Was Tony catering to this many different partners? Was Steve just another in a long line? They'd been dancing around each other for some time, obvious in their appreciative glances, their too-close stances, their perfectly incidental touches, obvious in the frequent little tugs, the measurements of tension, on strings that ran both ways.
Steve dropped his hand away from DUM-E as the bot answered with a long rising whistle and started moving. He accompanied himself with a rhythmic series of beeps, slowly extending his arm toward Tony till his claw rested atop Tony's shoulder, and against the side of Steve's where he and Tony stood touching.
"Oh, don't be like this, baby. Come here." He wrapped an arm around Steve's waist, fingers flirting with his fly, and the other around his neck, cradling it in the crook of his elbow.
, though his arousal was a roaring beast caged inside his skin, and he felt drawn scar-tissue tight, and his cock was white-hot from Tony's firepit of a mouth, blazing and burning for release.
He rocked them together, breathing into the short hair behind Steve's ear, driving them toward the peak. When he felt Steve's body stutter and clench, he nudged his own Extremis; moments later, Steve gave a hoarse shout, spurting over his hand. He himself didn't even need to ejaculate, just let Extremis trip his pleasure centers into the white-hot override of orgasm, let himself cling and tremble and moan.
, Tony was so strong, unflagging and flawed and formidable and sloppily human, unstintingly a hero, and Steve
Tony's hands came down to sculpt aqueducts into Steve’s hair, and Steve hummed. He tilted his chin to see Tony’s pleasure-smudged face, the drip of his watercolor lashes, the red splashes of his cheeks. Still kneeling before him, holding his eyes, he took himself in hand. His arousal, deferred, flared hot and bright, and a thick tremor rolled across his shoulders as he thumbed over the head.
Five minutes later, Steve trotted in. He was carrying his shield, but dressed down, in jeans faded practically as white as his t-shirt, both of which hugged his body deliciously as he ambled over. Tony knew that well-worn denim to be almost as soft as flannel, and stole a quick touch, tucking his fingers just inside one back pocket when Steve stopped by his side and leaned in for a kiss.
"Oh. Well, that's good. If Captain America promises, it must be true, right? Yeah, uh. Anyway, thanks for coming to the shop with me. I should probably..." He trailed off with a rueful half-smile and a handwave to the air, not sounding particularly reassured or relieved at all.
"--a rug. To warm up a place I thought was fine the way it was, and never noticed it was so bare. It's the perfect answer. A rug, a really uh, giant-sized, handmade one. Good thing there happens to be one of those right...
Steve might buy it of the Stark he saw in scandal mags, the gossip rags -- be they broadcast or in print, they were hard to avoid, especially when, he was a little bashful to admit, his attention so easily snapped to any mention or glimpse of Tony. There was no question, no denying, and in his mind, he wasn't even trying, that the man, in name or likeness, as in person, turned his head.
He was pretty drawn to Tony, himself. Even if his was more along the lines of... what Tony's only sounded like. Steve knew the breezy compliments were one of Tony's ways, and that they were genuine. He just knew better than to think the flirtation behind them was.
Having arrived fashionably early, Steve named his reservation, and nodded his intent to take a seat at the bar.
Then there was melody, stirring piano and strings. Steve opened his eyes to the roll of end credits. The theme music overtook the subtle percussive beats he'd been lulled by.
Tossing her small purse to the couch, Starla kicked off her shoes and shimmied out of her jacket with a hum and an exaggerated stretch and twine of very nicely toned arms above her head, then chucked the garment onto the cushions as well.
Tony's heart had slowed and Steve's pounded hard but rarely fast, so they were still matching pace. The air was rich, redolent of cucumber-lime-musk, a melange of their sex and the unretrieved soap-cake now shrunk to a sliver, and all this was the best, bar none.
"No! No, Tony, I did, that's not it at all." God, Steve was making such a mess of this, making Tony feel bad no matter what he said. He wanted to shrink inside himself, but kept trying to dig himself out. His own troubles didn't matter, as long as he left Tony knowing that nothing he'd done had upset Steve or made him feel bad. "I just wondered. It seemed very… spontaneous, that's all, but there's nothing wrong with that, either."
They responded eagerly, wheeling over and crowding in for the offered attention. The sentimental moment quickly devolved into something more like a hand-pile, where three of the hands were bot heads and two were human, with Steve and Tony both reserving the arms that remained wrapped around each other's backs...ides.
," their man gasped out in a rising pitch, his rhythm stuttering and stalling. Steve's throat convulsed in Tony's hands as he took down the liquid shot into him with a low gurgle.
All their talk of service and earning was a power play, and Roger knew how this one worked. It was power that built on itself; not the kind where more for one meant less for the other, but the kind where more for one meant more for both.
Could he care so little for his friend and their team? Could he be so blithe as to write off the fallout or bank on it buried by shame, that he'd notch his bedpost with the shield, then bounce both it and Steve back out his bedroom door?
, to letting them try, even though to his foundation, he knew better. He'd just wanted to make Steve happy, to give him everything, even if it meant committing the cardinal sin of accepting that his own fulfillment was required for it to be possible.
Tony sent his several thousand concurrent Iron Sight camera-drone views to background processing, upon hearing the sound of footsteps. A heavy tread, if a little slower than it used to be. Ah, yes. He'd been waiting. His door was always open for Steve. He picked up his drink.
Just lassitude stealing through him, his earlier anxieties diluted in the wash of orgasm and the comforting heap of Tony's lithe weight. Even the tang of their exertions was grounding, ripe and earthy, giving him roots.
He'd shown up through the dimensional gate in Richards' lab one afternoon, dressed in a worn hoodie and jeans, with an armored Captain America uniform and shield in one locked case -- opened once then never again -- and his leather in another. A man of few words, closer to silent than succinct, he shared little more than he was from a plane where "his" Tony Stark had been lost to... something apparently unspeakable.
to be seen." Tony had rolled his eyes and batted aside the feeble protest with a leer and a lazy drawl. "Steve and I see each other every day. As much of each other as possible. That goes double --  make that squared -- for today,” he’d smirked, jostling Rhodey with a playful nudge to the shoulder, while Steve shrugged with a smug little grin, the color high in his cheeks.
He was sincere in every word, but could tell he was still falling flat. His ability to rouse and inspire with stirring words had deserted him in his time of need. The winning smile he attempted felt like a jagged crack in his face. This must be the mirror image of how forced hers had looked to him.
"Tony, wait," Steve said hurriedly. "I want to try to fix this. I know what we did back there wasn't... very good, but isn't there... Couldn't we put it behind us and try again, the right way this time? Even if you don't feel quite as much for me, it's ok. I still think we could be something good."
Something was wrong. Behind the faceplate, Tony felt his face screw itself up, grotesquely squeeze and twist, a thin tugging at the corners of his eyes and the back of his throat. Something?
happy, to give him everything, even if it meant committing the cardinal sin of trying to accept that his own fulfillment was required in order to make it possible.
Roger bit his cheek against a smile at her indignation, and the images it put in his head. He had just met Starla, but he could already imagine the row if anyone tried to use gender roles to dictate her behavior. Blazing eyes and wrathful, self-righteous fury, standing over a vanquished foe, that’s what he saw. Woe betide that man -- or fellow woman, for that matter. It was a mistake he planned not to make.
Steve slid his hands up Tony's thighs, wiry and tensile and strong, and slid his mouth along his curving shaft, suckling lightly and feeling him swell the rest of the way. He backed off to the head and flicked his tongue around the flare and into the notch underneath. Tony's groan echoed off the tile, and his fingers tightened, then his hands were gone. Steve felt him shift and snuck a look through slitted eyes.
Tony hunkered down further, scooting around to sit cross-legged, and looking DUM-E straight in the "eye."
These insinuations were quickly becoming downright offensive. Even if he were available and interested, messing around with the likes of her seemed like a good way to
And indulge, he did, immersed in the world of dark, molten sensual response: the propulsive movement of his muscles and limbs; the heated clutch and bare, thin-liquid slide of Starla’s body enrobing and moving with his; the constant friction dragging along his cock from root to tip, keeping him hot-wired with a humming thread of current.
Something else Tony knew, with a fervent certainty that fell somewhere between faith and superstition, was whose name had been imprinted on those rockets, the malingering half-life of the youth he'd spent pre-packaging vessels of death.
A strip-tease, was it? Roger wouldn’t mind that, seeing her unpeel and reveal herself, inch by what he was sure would be breathtaking inch.
“Fine upstanding, all the way,” he confirmed. The look they exchanged was conspiratorial and amused. Roger was a little surprised at how companionable this was, laid-back and completely lacking in any post-coital awkwardness, devoid of all the earlier gamesmanship and tension. Having moved past their contentious meeting, he and Starla seemed
DUM-E beeped a happy-sounding reply, and with a whoosh of hydraulics, extended his strut at a sharp downward angle, back end raising high, so he could fold his head down and in against the shield.
The high-octane dirty talk fell by the wayside, replaced by harsh breathing and wet-slapping bodies, broken up with moans and groans, curses and gasps and growls, the language of raw sexual indulgence.
She laughed, deep and throaty, and leaned down to retrieve -- something? -- a couple of small items, maybe -- from out of her purse. A shiny corner caught the light in a quick flare before she secreted whatever-it-was out of sight down the front of her dress.
“But I understand. Perception is everything, isn’t it, darling? I see that I should at least introduce myself to the man who has spurned my advances so definitively. To tell you the truth, I’m a little shocked you haven’t recognized me. I do have something of a reputation, even a degree of, shall we say, infamy, in some circles.”
she was. He spread her open and got his first peek at her shiny pink hole, glistening with abundant lube, and more shiny streaks where he’d just slopped it around.
The nature of the strike told it all. They'd wanted torment. Grievous injury, and the agonizing hope of survivors. Whether or not there were any was of no relevance.
,” she chanted, and he ramped it up, gathering her in his hold and setting a rhythm of long, driving strokes, getting them down to fucking in earnest. The tail of his tie was aswing in front of him, and he freed up a hand for the instant he needed to fling it over his shoulder. With it out of the way, he watched, mesmerized by the sight of her wide-stretched rim sucking down his dick to disappear between her cheeks.
Oh, fuck. He'd been sitting on his feet all that time. too. No wonder. God, the two of them, neither ever meeting a limitation they wouldn't push. At least this would pass on its own, even if Tony was having an unpleasant few moments. Steve would find a way to make it up to him, and pleasing Tony was never a hardship.
Closer yet, and he noticed the one piece that appeared mismatched: a narrow gold herringbone chain that hung down past the choker, disappearing beneath her clothing.
He was primed, leaking and buzzing with it, rocking his hips into his fist to Tony's urgings: "C'mon, c'mon, gorgeous, just look at you,” and “Yeah, Steve, make it good. Show me just how you like it,” his voice as rough and tumble as if he’d been the one with the cock scrubbing the back of his tongue. Tony's filthy talk was a little embarrassing still, but a lot inflaming, always, because Tony did make him feel adventurous.
Captivating as this was, however, Steve was also beginning to feel uncomfortably out of place and intrusive, with nothing to do but stand across the room, effectively eavesdropping. Fortunately, Tony broke the moment just then to beckon Steve over, laying a reassuring hand in middle of his back and making introductions.
They made their way back into the lobby, and Steve took a seat, sinking into a heavy, cushioned armchair that seemed befitting of an Asgardian throne, and leaving Tony to take care of the business dealings.
She bowed her forehead into one hand. When she looked up, she had her inscrutable mask back in place. “Such a gentleman. But no, thank you, Roger. I’ll be fine. Don’t forget, I’m richer than god. I could walk out of here butt naked, and by tomorrow, bare-ass dining would be the nobody-if-you’re-not-doing-it new trend and they’d be cleaning skid marks off the seats.”
Truth be told, Steve had firmed up more from the past twelve seconds of Tony's unabashed sex talk and their banter than from the previous twelve minutes of Tony drooling on his balls without actually bothering to blow him. Just hearing it, including Tony's uncannily accurate reproduction of his own enthusiastic, uh, encouragements, had his face feeling hotter and redder than the non-action had done for his dick.
He had the feeling that this time, Steve wasn't trying to make him unshoulder his guilt, but to shoulder his own way into it beside him. He couldn't allow that. The idea was intolerable. This wasn't a load that was halved in the sharing; the furthest thing from it. Crippling enough, the knowledge that he'd brought this down upon them. He couldn't bear for it to reflect upon Steve. For any scrap of blame this caused Steve to take up, it only compounded the magnitude of Tony's own wrongdoing, his failure, even further.
Exasperated, Tony ran his other hand through work-disheveled hair and queried, "J, you got any idea what this is all about with DUM-E?"
What a mouth-watering, pretty picture. Full points for presentation. He’d wish for a camera, but he didn’t need it. She was clay for him to wet-sculpt, with his hands and his mouth and his cock.
to suck on her open ass, licking up her crack in broad, scouring stripes, and stabbing his tongue back in to clean her all out and play around in there.
“Oh, fuck, oh, god, you feel that, you feel me riding your wet hole, letting you feel what’s going in you?”
The explanation itself, it took Steve a minute to process, to fit the words and their meanings together, and then it clicked, making sense in such a perfectly weird and twisty
"So unless you have any further grandiose threats, imprecations, or vitriol to spew? No? Then I believe our business here is concluded." Tony lobbed the bottle in an arcing overhand toss toward Steve, who reached up to catch it by reflex. "On the house. After all that
She curled her grip around his belt buckle, and it pulled at the crotch of his slacks, dug his inseam up into his balls.
Tears streamed into fabric, sobs disguised as grunts, while Tony pretended he could see Steve's eyes lit with joy, and not Steve's face full of sorrow, like a ghost of regrets hovering in the darkness behind the blindfold. He wanted to writhe and wail, beg and provoke, till self-control snapped and they surged together in the rise to the finish. Instead, he was held fast, pinned, stifled.
Or maybe that was just the effect of the accompanying exaggerated grin and contrived eyebrow waggling he chose to animate across his face. It elicited the surely intended chuckle from Steve, and then Tony lapsed into laughter with him, letting the slapstick slide away into a natural and unguarded smile.
Steve huffed. "I enjoy my soaps just fine without my pants around my ankles and your slobber all over my dick. It's distracting."
"What do you say, JARVIS, looks like you're the one who might need some extra arms to get in on this, hm?" Tony suggested.
Steve turned toward Tony, leaving the hand on DUM-E's strut solidly in place, and motioning Tony the last few steps over with the other, wrapping it around his waist and pulling him in close. Tony gladly closed the distance between them, pressing in tight to Steve's side. The tugging feeling in his chest became a gentler and warmer one, one that rose up and formed itself into words he hadn't known he contained, and carried them from his heart to his mouth.
Their musk and perspiration commingled in the air till it seemed like he could taste her, even though this sex hadn’t been about mouths or kissing.
She lobbed one his way, and he caught it by reflex. Now that he thought about it, he was parched. And for that matter, famished.
Though not much of a wisecracker, Tony was articulate and incisive with language, as clever and quick with words as with everything else.
His eyes had fallen closed; he was antenna-tuned to her proximity, just breathing into the startling, inflammatory touches.
He inched his left leg over, closing what had been the sightly open fall of his knees, and looked up into arctic blue eyes above razor-slash cheekbones, the better to feed the exsanguination she wore on her lips.
-- before Tony gave the answer he hoped for, sliding their lips together with better skill, showing him how they fit.
He nodded, satisfied, and got to his feet. Stopping to pick up the heap of his discarded clothing, he trailed a few steps behind as they made their way back over to the couch, availing himself of one last opportunity to admire her truly fantastic legs and ass.
Which, when it came right down to it, she hadn’t ever straight-up made one, but there’d been no mistaking her intentions.
And Tony was right, the soft, dense fibers felt extravagant under his bare feet and between his toes, and without thinking about it, he wiggled them down further in, feeling his smile stretch, too.
"He has neither complained nor confided in me, sir. At the moment, he has engaged his sleep mode, but when the cycle completes, I shall, if you wish, enquire."
Said yes, and taken it a step, a few light-years, further. Picked the spot, insisted on flying everyone out, made a... a pageant of it. Thrown his
His traitorous self felt regret, rather than the appropriate relief, at the abandoned caress. He was a selfish man, greedy for tokens he hadn't earned, even when he knew he'd forfeited any rights to having these wishes fulfilled.
His own slacks were a little wrinkled, but not terribly the worse for wear, and would cover his fluid-streaked shirt tails, which had not fared as well. They both had jackets, which had remained out of the line of fire, and would help maintain some semblance of dignity on the way out, too. Starla had slipped into hers, and with a small grimace, was wiggling her stocking-clad feet back into her shoes.
Another brittle silence hung between them, grey and dull as the flecks that littered their hair and drifted loose, as the pallor that blanched the planes and grooves of their faces. Massive and dense as their grief, with nothing left to fuel its outlet, that mounded within and between them like psychic slag heaps.
He ignored the discomfort, doing a few controlled-breathing exercises while he sipped from the heavy, cut-glass tumbler, and took out his cell phone to send a text message to Tony:
Mr. Bassat walked them around the room, pointing out a few of the bigger carpets spread across the floor and hung on the walls, and in a couple of cases, moving frames aside to reveal unseen pieces sitting out of sight behind the others.
He shifted his attention -- most of it -- back to the television, but left his hand resting on Tony's head.
The soft touch of her mouth was electric, delicate and daring, gentler by far than anything about her demeanor, and the shock that spiraled through him was beyond anything warranted even by the hint of hot, smooth, wetness from the inside of her lips.
Steve flicked his eyes up, meeting Tony's obliquely, studying the soft tilt of his head, the mussed waves of his hair.
Tony brought his own hands back to Steve, this time setting them lightly at the base of his neck, index fingers wrapping just above his collar bones, where he could push into the dips. He liked to be able to feel those soft spots as Steve's throat worked, as he sucked and swallowed.
“Here, hold this,” he ordered rhetorically, stuffing the back hem of the skirt under the upper straps of the garter belt. It distorted the fancy-ass design, but kept Starla’s fancier-actual-ass on display.
Steve could never tire of watching him like this, wanton and shamelessly debauched. He'd drink it in for every second he could indulge, but it was no surprise that Tony was past the point of prolonging this. It wasn't more than a minute or two before he convulsed and and came with a keening cry and a spreading stain that darkened the satin of his pants.
Tony was flying high on Extremis-supplemented endorphins, maxed out to full charge like a redlining power plant buzzing and humming in his bones. He felt radiant. Luminous, like an icon. A messiah.
"I'm really sorry to hear that. And I hope I can try to make you feel better. But first -- DUM-E, you know we love you, right? Tony, me, the other bots, JARVIS? All of us. That's really important."
"Now, I've got a city to run, nearly a million estimable citizens whose health and beauty need seeing to, so no more time to squander on personal pleasures." The first part was the truth; the second a lie. He
A toss of her head flipped and resettled the raven-dark, spiky layers that swept to one side on top of her head, leaving the short-clipped back and severely shaped sideburns unruffled. She barked out an indelicate cackle, unhanding him before his reach toward his shoulder could connect to do it for her. “Full points for creativity, professor. That’s the most scholarly rejection I’ve ever been dealt.”
The master key to Steve was to give him a war. Making it one he couldn't win was diabolical. Setting him against himself was transcendent.
While Butterfingers and U motored around making themselves generally, well, U-seful, DUM-E moped for hours in his charging bay with his claw hanging low, waiting till Tony launched into a round of assembly work before sounding off a wild flurry of beeps and boops and wheeling out at reckless speed.
“Ma’am.” She chuckled, full and hearty. “I haven’t heard that one in… longer than your seven years, not from anyone who wasn’t getting paid to say it, anyway. Well, I suppose you’ve made yourself clear enough. My congratulations, my apologies, and my loss. You’re absolutely certain I can’t tempt you into just one little taste?”
" He shut his trap and trapped the laughter in with a hand clapped across his face, but from the frown Steve shot at him, he was sure it was leaking out around his eyes anyway. Steve rolled his, and turned his attention back to the bot.
And with that, gathered his resolve to confess, apologize and explain the mess he’d snarled and tangled, in his head and two more points knotted up down a rope through his middle.
While he let Steve perform, Tony looked upon the room. Aesthetically appealing figures in all shapes, sizes, and colors conjoined in a multitude of permutations, percolating in plotted trajectories and seething, mindless motion. The air was spiced with incense and body secretions, pulsing with slaps and thuds, singing with moans, cries, and shouts.
He tweaked the subroutine of Extremis responsible for altering Steve, maintaining the bulk of his body while letting his face fall back to its sags and wrinkles, and then deepened all the lines in his own, thinning and hollowing his cheeks, and sinking the set of his eyes further back in his brow. He steeled himself to be disgusted by the image, and was startled when he actually felt a pang, soft and sentimental, clutching around his heart.
She took another slim packet from her purse and pulled out a moist towelette, offering one to him, as well. He accepted, setting his things down to the side.
Steve shot forward, pushing himself away from the couch back so he was sitting up and leaning into it, his torso curled over Tony's.
"And if it could always be me, you'd never have to. So, we'll share it this time. I'm... I'm glad it's with you, Tony."
." The rumble of it had almost started to get Steve going, but then Tony had subsided back into silence, and Steve was just supposed to sit there, and... nada, nothing.
He could push down Tony's throat; he knew Tony could take him, slide himself right down into that tight, closed space...
Tony gasped loudly, gaping his eyes and mouth a into ridiculous saucer-face. "Oh, my dear, how could you forget? I must know!
Here as every part of her he’d seen, she was lean and spare, smoothly fleshed without a scrap of extra, and he already couldn’t get enough. He swore some more and stopped breathing and ran his hands greedily over all that harnessed-in skin, circling and dimpling it with his thumbs.
Steve broke his paralysis, picking up a length of black fabric from some supplies laid out on a sideboard. Maybe a not-quite towel. What was he--? He was smoothing and twisting it into a long strip, then holding it with one hand toward each end, and raising it in Tony's direction.
Tony chortled, admiring the artfulness of his own temporary laugh-lines. "I think you make more a mockery of yourself." He pumped Steve's dick in two tight, short strokes, watched his jaw clench and felt a tremor roll through him. "But I do want you to enjoy this, so if you really feel so strongly about it... How about now?"
Steve offered his right hand and had it accepted for a more traditional American handshake, the old man's bones light, but his grip sure. "A pleasure, Mr. Bassat." Regardless of the words exchanged with Tony about titles and respect, Steve certainly hadn't earned the first-name basis. "Any friend of Tony's is a friend of mine."
When a completed project required cleanup, he shot out once again, zooming and weaving perilously between human and fellow bots alike, to snatch up tools, supplies, and chunks of scrap, moving them from place to place as rapidly as possible -- never mind that all he was really doing was grabbing an ongoing succession of objects, only to deposit each one a few feet away, in a location decidedly not related to its proper point of storage or disposal.
“Yeah, come and get me, tiger.” She egged him on as he pushed off and covered the ground between them in rangy strides. His simmer flared to a rowdy boil; he planted himself behind her, took her by the hips and dragged her against the tented front of his crotch, gave her a good preview of what he was gonna put in her.
Clint massaged his temples. "Ok, look, we were all sick of you two circling around each other, you know, so we called up the Guardians and asked if they had any galactic pals who could arrange some kind of orgy, or fertility ritual, or sex-something-or-other... Turns out, some friends of theirs run this exotic-fantasy fulfillment service, so we..." He sighed gustily. "It was supposed to get you to admit your feelings and whisk you away for a great weekend fuck-cation in the alien honeymoon suite. That's all."
She slipped off her stool, taking him to his feet along with her. In her low heels, they were almost exactly of a height. Her eyes danced and glittered with the most enticing kinds of trouble.
He took his unhurried time perusing Steve's pink lips, wet with spit-trails leaking like tears from the corners, and watching the subtle working of his jaw and the bob of his Adam's apple through several thick swallows as he reacclimated to his mouth being deoccupied.
, Roger, dammit, fuck, oh god, I want you to go first, blow your load in me, shoot me up with your hot come, c’mon,
There was simply no argument with this level of perfection, and Steve was part of it, the single external component to make the system complete.
And thinking about his unexpected, life-altering turns, that was why he was perfectly content to let an unplanned excursion with Tony fall under "find out when we get there."
"That's right. I know what you're here for. And I know how you ask for the things you don't want to want." Tony used his feet to kick Steve's legs open wider, and undid his belt and fly to reach inside, shoving impatiently at the stodgy Y-fronts holding his target cocooned in tight elastic. Steve bucked, but he was in a disadvantaged position, and Tony shortly had the constricting underwear worked down to the tops of his thighs, stretching beneath the grey-furred balls on display beneath his half-hard cock, framed in the open vee of the trousers. He eyed the testicles critically, and gave them a rough squeeze. Steve tried to shrink in on himself, but there was nowhere to go.
“Sorry to break it to you, but we’re two hundred years, plus, past the Oklahoma Land Rush, and also, not in Oklahoma. So if you wouldn’t mind?” He flicked his eyes down and then over, highlighting the two tracts of contested territory.
"And now you realize how wrong it was to have done this without our knowledge or consent?" Steve asked pointedly. Disappointed Cap also existed completely independent of his uniform.
Long arms were good for something. He reached down and goosed the tight globe of Tony's ass, just because they were naked and it was a tempting, perfect curve, and he was allowed.
Steve moaned at the sight, and between his own legs, in the background, he throbbed in time. He closed his eyes once more, bringing Tony’s clean, salty taste to the fore of his senses, warm droplets of water renewing on skin with each bob of his head, and hot beads of heavier fluid trickling across his tongue.
Tony wasn't deserving, and -- Steve was, but for it to come from him would be a travesty. Like breaking someone's bones just to play the hero for knowing how to splint them. Just add it to the list. Steve had always deserved things that Tony didn't have within him to give.
Tony replied anyway, with a guileless glance and a studiously neutral, "I'm glad you're here, Steve."
A switch inside him flipped. Compliance to resistance, frustration to fight. It made no difference to Steve's relentless possession of his body. Tony bucked in his hold, and Steve clutched him tighter. Chin hooked over Tony's shoulder, Steve growled in his ear.
Seeming to have concluded one line of thought at least to his own satisfaction, Tony turned his head to catch Steve's eyes, shooting him a sparkling smile. "So! You ready to go shopping?"
The newcomer was no middle-aged matron. Tall, lean, and angular, this woman strode in like a two-legged grudge on the prowl, all pugnacious strut, a parabolic antenna for the eyes.
Tony stroked him, his armored thumb spreading the drops of liquid leaking at the head, luxuriating in the slide of hard flesh through the smooth metal covering his palm.
"Or to put ten things in the wrong place." Oops, like Tony's mouth had just put itself in the wrong place. He raised his hands. "Sorry, sorry."
Steve panted, sweat-sheened and red in the face. "You... bastard," he gritted out. "Don't... mock me."
Tony could see that Steve definitely had DUM-E's attention. The bot had finally lifted his head away from his patriotic "pillow" to tilt it up quizically toward Steve.
"That's good, Cap, glad I could help get your mind off of work for a while, you need it,” was all Tony’d said, and had let Steve see himself out.
Oh. So Steve wouldn't have to see his rejection through the act. That was fair. He nodded curtly, and Steve stepped to his shoulder, nudged him around, and lowered the makeshift blindfold in front of his face, settling it from brow to bridge of his nose. Behind Tony's head he tied it snug enough to be secure, but not so tight as to bind.
Wanted to feed that joy like a carefully tended spark, shelter it from the whipping wind that was the hurt and loss and wrong of the world, coax and nurture that tiny flame so it could thrive and warm and sustain them in turn.
So when Steve came home with Irish Spring and Ivory, Tony countered with bay rum and bergamot. Inevitable to amass numerous varieties, nearly as many bars and cakes as bottles bought, but who was counting?
He grinned in gigawatts. "But not today? Whenever you're ready, then. You come right on back to me, Steve. I'll be waiting."
It might anyway. But Steve -- hadn't broken, hadn't moved anything but his head and hands, hadn't thrust, hadn't
"Tony," Steve whispered after a short interval, "I've got some bad news for you, fella, this isn't how you cut a rug."
. Titles and surnames are but vessels, empty of honor until filled with it by actions. First names hold no disrespect for your elders when a good young man like yourself demonstrates it in the ways that matter."
Then she turned on her heel, blew a kiss over her shoulder, and sashayed off with a swing to her hips and a swish to her skirt, every inch the manic, gleeful coquette. Roger would call it a calculated tease, but it wasn’t. Well, the calculated part, that sure was. They both knew how to put on a show. But a tease, no. A prelude, a promise, and it was definitely having the desired effect, keeping him on the hook, hard, hot and bothered, and primed to take off in pursuit.
"Nice to have you back, DUM-E. And I, uh. Yeah. I love you too. Just the way you are." Tony looked up at Steve. "You, too." And then he called out to the other bots, "Butterfingers and U, too. Why don't you guys come on over here and join us for this, uh, group hug thing."
Tony shrugs off his touch, turns to the holo and opens up the video of the first interrogation of Natasha after Barton brought her in.
Tony stares back at him, his eyes wide and dark in the dim light and his gaze intent.  Half his face is illuminated by the warm glow emanating from inside the house, his chin and jaw line contrasted with a hint of blue from the arc reactor.  It’s strange to see Tony so still, so quiet, and Steve’s never been the target of Tony’s laser-like focus for so long.
Fury points to the empty stool to Steve’s right, the only seat Steve can mark as empty in the joint.
Steve chuckles and lets his sunglasses drop back down.  He glances through the large plate glass window of the restaurant, and then at the crowd gathered on the sidewalk.
“Then I’m glad you found him,” Bucky replies quietly, with another kiss to Steve’s fingers. “That you have him.”
“Ah, ah, ah…” Steve gasps with every short thrust, voice higher and more breathy than Tony’s ever heard. It sounds like desperation, but the good kind of desperation that means he’s begging for more of what he’s getting.
“It really does.” Steve agrees, hand on Tony’s shoulder as he peers out at the cityscape.  “You left just the
With his father being who he was, Tony had grown up in the presence of some of the world’s most powerful men. It takes more than Melanie Wilkes to wow him.
He wishes he could tell Bucky the truth about where he’d been and what he’d done. He wishes he could tell him how dizzy in love he’d felt last night, and how desolate and heartbroken he’d felt this morning when he’d left that hotel room.
“So you know Steve’s here?”  Bruce asks plainly.  Tony can’t imagine he’s such an easy read, but of all the new acquaintances he’s collected as of late, Bruce is the one who seems to be riding the same wavelength.
“A pale shadow of one.”  Fury shakes his head.  “Perhaps fortunately for us in this case, there’s only one you.”
“Captain Rogers…don’t have much time.” The message is coming in clearer now.  The woman, whoever she is, is trying to sit him up.  She has surprising force for someone so slender.  Maybe she’s not that delicate.  Maybe he’s hallucinating this whole thing.
“The ‘sort of sometimes’?” Jan murmurs to Steve as Bucky gets up to help Nat with her coat, and Steve nods. “Guess I’m back to flirting with you, handsome. Brace yourself.” She purses a kiss in his direction, and then sits up straight in her seat, rearranging her face into a polite, kind smile to greet Natasha.
The words are pushed out of Tony’s mouth like it’s painful for Tony to even say them, and that in itself makes Steve bristle.
“I know nothing ever happened between the two of you before, back then, or even after he came back. I believe you. I am not accusing you of anything, or saying I don’t trust you.” Tony attempts to choose his words carefully, a task he’s never been particularly good at the best of times.
“Irving died in the war. Was with the 26th at Kasserine Pass. She got the telegram about two days after you shipped out.” Steve’s fingers pull at the fabric now, tugging on a loose thread and making the hem run. “Scared the shit out of me. I felt terrible for her…but that didn’t stop me from thanking God it was him and it wasn’t you.” Steve glances up, but just as quickly looks back down. “Kinda makes me a terrible person, huh.”
“Sorry to be blunt.  I know it’s not my business, but after so many years of taking care of him it’s hard to stop.”  Pepper’s hand goes to her necklace, fingers gently running over the diamonds and sapphires.  Steve wonders if it’s one of Tony’s more extravagant gifts.  “It’s not like Tony to hold back; it means a lot that he is.  I think if I don’t nudge you in the right direction you’ll both be waiting around for the other for quite awhile.”
"Ok, let me explain. My shield, there. Do you think I just throw it around as many times as fast as I can?"
By fifteen minutes before the ceremony, the guests would all have been gathered, mostly seated, perhaps a few still milling, the pews lining them into orderly rows queued for the slaughter.
He gave his pent-up dick a few long rubs, a shot of friction he could just about taste, rippling down and getting his hips warm and loose and his pants tighter than ever. His eyes stayed locked on target, ten feet away.
Steve believed firmly in always holding onto hope, but this refusal was one he shouldn’t have to repeat. He worked his jaw in a circle and rolled his shoulders back, feeling something crawling between them, and the phantom sensation of being watched. Time was counting down, and he needed to extricate himself from her brazen pursuits before Mrs. DeWard could arrive to find him in this compromising position.
Steve's skin prickled with sweat and his muscles had bunched tight; he loosened his fingers from their tangle in Tony's hair, and forced himself to hold back the unruly thrusts that gathered, ready to break out past the barrier of his hips.
"Fine. Point established. You have no scruples. But so help me, Stark, do not touch me with that abomination. Keep it away, off me, out of me, I want nothing to do with it."
“Your Bond could use some practice, but I assure you, loverboy, the pleasure is equally mine,” she intimated, pure seduction under inky, sweeping lashes. She swayed in to brush their cheeks together, just barely, the dangling jewels of her eardrops tapping the edge of his jaw, and a bolt of heat shivered through him. “You have more of a Captain America quality about you, and he’s always been
He stretched his lips and throat and let Tony sink in to the root, nose to the wet, coarse curls, another texture. Tony shuddered and gasped, and Steve stopped breathing and swallowed, tongue flattened to the thick ridge, held open, expanded, around Tony’s hard length.
at it, the same way he always did, the same old cover-up for being of no inherent worth in himself, the same old delusion that he could give any gift that wasn't a curse.
"All that stuff Steve's saying? That's what I meant and wanted to tell you. It's just, he's way better at it than I am. That's why... that's why we all have each other and it's good we're all different, right? So we can help each other with the things we're not as good at?"
you," Steve chanted in a vicious crescendo, as Tony continued to expertly manipulate him, mercilessly exploiting his arousal. His eyes closed again, his head falling to hang heavily across Tony's arm. Tony left the hold loose now, forearm angling down and fingers resting at Steve's collar bone, no longer a choke, but an embrace for Steve to strangle himself upon.
"Ok? Sometimes, yeah. I could just really use that. I--" A flicker of defiance, of defensiveness, passed over his face, and he suddenly looked lifeless and drained, like a flash fire that had burned away all its fuel.
Now that she’d announced herself, it seemed she was banking on him being impressed by her name and fame. He took a wild stab, a roughly calculated risk, knowing he might be making an even bigger fool of himself.
Steve’s mind freezes as Tony takes that last step between them and wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders.
Tony rolled his eyes but got up and picked his usual corner cell. The walls were nice to lean against and he wasn’t on display if anyone happened to walk in. Steve closed and locked the door behind him and then pocketed the keys instead of hanging them up again. Tony spun around once then sat himself down and looked up expectantly at Steve.
Steve grins at him, hands shifting back and lower on Tony’s hips and Tony bites back a moan. Steve’s grin grows wider. “This is so much better than phone sex.”
Tony took a step forward and really studied the entity - the ghost - standing before him. It—He looked exactly like in Howard’s old pictures; the flop of his blond hair, the light blue of his eyes, the damned
The door refused to open and Tony sighed, opening the chute door and dropping the Trap in. The chute hissed and clicked, and Tony heard the Trap being picked up on the other side. He waited thirty seconds then pulled up the access controls again, letting JARVIS run the unlock.
A waitress comes by with a pitcher of beer and Jim smiles at her, handing her a tip before she leaves. When he turns back, Tony has pillowed his head on his arms on the table and was rolling it back and forth. Jim sighs and reaches over to scratch the back of Tony’s head lightly then goes about refilling their glasses.
“What about that time I first crawled into bed with you and every day after that?” It wasn't said with an accusatory tone and Tony took comfort in that.
He’d started taking up his time by tagging in on PLASM missions with the team sans Tony, mostly sitting in the Quinjet, taken the team up on Trivia Nights (he could beat Thor, if that was any consolation) for the sake of learning about the new age, learned some biophysics and psychophysiology from Bruce, and then had still spent more time than was probably healthy in Tony’s workshop with Tony.
And of all the information Steve had at his fingertips, Steve chose to believe in Iron Man’s words even if they hadn’t even been directed at him and were rather short tempered from the long days spent slogging through ocean and eating nothing but fish; that they had been short tempered probably spoke more of the truth than anything. SHIELD had received Stark-made aquatic gear to replace their SHIELD-issue gear and that gesture, no matter how Iron Man managed to bring it up to his boss as relevant, was what had won Steve over away from his distaste of Tony Stark. He may not know anything about Stark as a person but he knew how his own image as Captain America had been twisted into something the public could consume with glee and he could easily carry over the comparison to Stark.
Stark's eyes softened at the gesture. "Am I your darling now?" he said with a tilt of his head. "I might just get used to this damsel business."
. “There was something possessing the arc reactor, the vibranium,” he said quickly. “It used to be in Steve’s shield but it migrated. It kept Steve from moving on and it’s been absorbing P.K.E.; my hauntings, the slime today, probably the Colonel we thought had skipped dimension,
T'Challa had no doubt that he could tear the Captain and the Soldier apart in their current condition but this was no longer his objective. Slowly, he raised his hands and removed his Panther helmet to look them both in the eye.
Tony came twice more, not even attempting to bite back his shouts of pleasure. He was rewarded with the sounds of Steve’s groans of something that sounded like Tony’s name. He didn’t think he could come any more, but his entire body was still flushed and the antsy buzzing still hadn’t receded from underneath his skin. And he still wanted Steve, so, so much.
“I—I kissed you,” Steve confessed. “I thought it was you and I was hoping…” he trailed off, unsure if he could just say it to Tony after all. He frowned, though, as more memories of that night came to him -  discrepancies he chose to ignore. “It does explain the lack of beard.”
he doing this? Because Tony was Howard’s son, his only remaining link to the old life who wasn’t losing their mind? Because it was the right thing to do? Because it was the only meaningful thing he
Tony flew down to Natasha and she threw the reprogrammed hexagonal Slime Trap at him with a salute. He fumbled with it, getting it to face the right way, and hovered in position above the blob.
Steve slid the seat back until there was just enough space between him and the desk. He clicked his fingers and pointed to the floor in front of him. Tony licked wetly at his lips, the sound loud in the silence between them, and then walked around the desk, the fingers of one hand sliding along the edge of the table and the other pulling at his tie. When he stood in front of Steve, hip cocked, he dropped the undone tie into Steve’s lap.
He flew himself to the helicarrier, refusing the Quinjet ride. In the hanger, he queried JARVIS on his phone and JARVIS helpfully displayed camera feeds from the meeting rooms. The cameras in Conference Room Five were on a loop; looks like they were already there. So much for throwing everyone off by arriving early.
Steve had stiffened at the first words but laughed as Star—Tony had continued speaking. Steve braced himself and reached forward to grasp Tony’s hand, taking the opportunity he had all but crashed into. The contrast of soft skin and scars and calluses tickled his palm and he held on, feeling a surge of heated excitement he hadn’t known he could feel anymore.
Tony felt a rare blush rise up his cheeks. He knocked his head back against the wall with a thud. "Ugh. Sorry I've been difficult.”
Natasha takes her chance, and her victory. She leans forward and lets her face relax into a genuine smile. “Tony, you’ll never know unless you try. My sources—“
Tony activated the Trap, holding it in place with both hands. It shuddered violently and he could feel his thrusters working hard as JARVIS stabilized him in the air. Good, because he didn’t think he had the full concentration to keep himself steady without some help. The blob gave a mighty groan and was slowly drawn into the Trap in a whirlwind of P.K.E.. Tony closed his eyes against the blinding interior of the Trap and waited it out. With a final gurgle, the blob was in and Tony tumbled back through the air at the recoil.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Steve said, injecting all the conviction he had into his voice. “I want to stay. I’m going to stay.”
When he could see again, he was staring at the white star of a certain uniform, held tight in warm, strong arms.
“I’ve been looking back at your work and I don’t think I’m… convinced at how far you’ve spread yourself out.”
“I’m always afraid of putting Rhodey here,” Tony says at last. “I know he knows what he’s doing, but I can’t control what happens to my weapons when they leave my head. I had to shut it all down. I had to hunt it all down.”
Tony didn’t want to test out what they would do to a person so he dodged again, rolling lazily around the ball of pink. The feeds on his HUD showed Clint on the rooftop opposite the kid, arrow notched but not drawn. Bruce was hovering nervously in their landed Quinjet a little ways off. Natasha was approaching the kid front on, batons stowed and hands raised. Steve and Thor were making their way toward the kid from the sides, hammer down but poised to spin and shield ready to be raised.
Tony didn’t say anything further and he turned away from Steve once again, walked away. Maybe for the last time. Steve wanted it to be the last time. He knew he’d lost this War, lost everything to it and he wanted to start anew. He didn’t want to see what this world would become without him there to curb the insanity.
They stood in the cold silence now, and Stark's gaze returned to the shield on the ground, face now openly dejected. Perhaps it had been much more than a working relationship than T'Challa had realized.
And just a few weeks ago, rogue soldiers had ridden in to Timely, again, covered in dust and the rags of what once could have been uniforms. They had taken over the inn for the better part of a week, bragging about the Indian’s they’d rounded up and sent off. Steve had kept a close eye on the newcomers, lounging at the bar most days with a hand on his pistol. Tony had taken to following Steve like a dog with a bone and the both of them had ended up in a corner of the inn one night, Tony getting steadily drunk, and Steve getting steadily more agitated at the increasingly raucous scene towards the middle of the inn.
did,” Stark shot back. There was finally a spark of life in his voice and Steve couldn’t help but pay it his attention. Not like what he hadn’t done, so many times during the War.
They happen across a gracefully floating Vision, cape billowing in a manner Thor must approve of, hand reached out towards Wanda on the ground who is starting to hover herself into the air atop a pale halo of pink light. She laughs as she surges higher and almost into Vision’s arms, and they end up dancing around each other through the air.
Steve turned from the window and strode past the straight-faced soldier into the dark corridor. The walls were bare, the tiles on the floor colorless. He brushed a finger along the smooth paint of the walls as he approached the interrogation room. His fingers tapped out a familiar tune from a long time ago, from someone he’d let them think he’d forgotten. The soldier marching behind him opened the door at his command and he stepped in, eyes on the scant contents on the room first and not on the spotlit figure hunched and tied to the chair in the middle.
Bruce looks over to where Sharon and Thor are laughing over something Thor just said. “So,” he begins, “you and Sharon?”
“Boss blacks them out himself,” FRIDAY adds with a hint of frustration. "I only apply the usual protocols for his communication with the rest of you."
found a puppy earlier in the day. He’d taken it right back to the flustered owner who had been walking the little fella. He’d also turned down an offer for coffee as a Valentine’s date but that was beside the point of the here and now.
“Out of the way,” Bruce growled, eyes green, and Steve fell out of the car right through the chassis in his haste to obey. He crawled from the car then turned to face the burst of light from the middle of the workshop.
It was in the way Tony didn’t back away, fighting back and matching every ferocious bite with more teeth and nails, too ferocious for his Tony, until something—something hot and searing bloomed between them, whiting out the world around them as they grabbed and pushed and pulled themselves into something different, something new.
Tony Stark of the endless wardrobe, choosing, more often than not, a simple leather sports jacket instead of a velvet dinner jacket. Steve's eternal frustration was somewhat justified. But he did the best he could with what he was given. His memory, sharper since taking the serum, helped him recall each and every suit Tony had ever worn. His skin, so much more sensitive to the textures, memorized the feel of each one.
Steve didn’t know if he wanted to move on. Some days when Steve had ventured out, he’d marveled at the future, the different technology, the different

"I said my piece the best I could," Steve said. "I let him know I'm still here for him. I don't have a reason to believe there would've been an emergency that needed me in these last couple of days so I feel like I'm hoping something bad would happen just so he can call—"
.” He wriggled in Steve’s lap and they both gasped at the feeling. “I’ve finished everything planned for the year. I’m officially on holiday.” He turned his head and nosed at Steve’s cheek. “Take me home.”
Tony was silent for a long time and Steve looked away, giving him a semblance of privacy for his thoughts.
Stark didn't move, eyes still fixed on the shield that lay by the entrance - the Captain's abandoned shield. There was a history there, a history which had only fanned the misdirected rage. T'Challa himself knew how he felt about the Captain when his attempt to catch and kill the Soldier had been thwarted again and again, and he hadn't even personally known the man. But he also knew how he would have felt if he had killed the Soldier given what he knew now. He could only imagine what Stark would have felt if Stark had carried through with his violent grief only to find his friend and an innocent man dead at his feet.
"Gonna ride you like the prized stallion you are," Tony breathed. He nipped at Steve's bottom lip sharply then withdrew before Steve could recapture his lips for a kiss. "Incoming trains, incoming riders, incoming sun, take your pick. I'll finish you off in two minutes. Got any objections, Steve, oh Sheriff, my savior?"
Steve saw red. He reached behind the agent and fisted his hair, pulling his head back to stare up at Steve. Steve could smell the blood and sweat on the man, and the tang of something bitter that was terror, as appropriate. He was glad he had his men shave this agent before they gave him to Steve. At a certain angle, he could have almost pretended the man was someone else.
They shook hands once again and T'Challa turned to leave. Before he stepped down from the landing pad, he looked back one last time. Steve had the phone held to his ear, a startled but real smile lighting up his face for the first time in days.
Steve and things Steve could do to him. It was impossible to think of anything else. Every single surface in the workshop and the Tower could be used. Every lighting permutation had an associated simulation of its effects on Steve’s hair, skin, his eyes. God, Steve could bend Tony over the railings outside the Tower, fuck him with his fist, and Tony could scream for more. And yet with every impossible spurt of come over his stomach, the buzzing beneath his skin grew more and more unbearable. His dick was starting to chafe from the attention despite the lube and the soft toweling but it wouldn’t stop demanding more, hardening after every increasingly dry orgasm like he was a teenager again. Until the rest of his body finally gave up.
Tony mumbles under his breath as he wipes his hands with a napkin. Jim can see the red rising up his neck and decides to give Tony a break. As Natasha says, one step at a time and getting Tony to speak this much is a giant step forward.
“What did you expect me to have done, Steve?” Tony asked, spreading his hands wide. “Single-handedly save the universe, the multiverse, from complete annihilation?”
Steve hesitated, unsure if he was still welcome, and he kept himself in this spot a respectable distance away. “We need to talk,” he said.
Steve started to get used to having Iron Man curled to his side with the crown of the helmet pressed to the crook of his neck, and sometimes with an armored arm wriggled into the space between his back and the cushions of a couch. It was comfortable, mentally if not always physically, to know that Iron Man trusted him this much—that anyone could trust him this much.
It didn’t take long before he came into Steve’s fist, his erection twitching alongside Steve’s as they thrust together, releasing together, Steve’s deliciously filthy promises breathed into his ear. The feeling of his orgasm was like a cool shower for his fevered mind. He felt his floaty sanity reassert itself; the tendrils of coherent thought were snapping back into place one by one and he used it to savor the warmth of Steve enveloping him.
The very best times, though, were not during the trips themselves, but during the return trip where they had hours upon hours to themselves, undisturbed. Even though he'd never called himself a businessman, even though he rarely appeared to care about the running of Stark Industries beyond Research and Development, Tony still had a mind for business. It was why Pepper ordered him on these trips. Tony had a mouth on him and he could talk the talk with the best of them. And this talking always riled Tony up; he would pace up and down, hands waving animatedly, his suit jacket unbuttoned as he poured his thoughts about the successful merger into the open space of the cabin. Steve watched, amused, noting the creases at the back of Tony’s jacket from sitting for too long. He wanted to smooth them out.
A soft touch brushed against his shoulder and Tony lurched to his feet, swinging an arm wildly behind himself to ward off whatever was there. Backing away to the other side of the room, he shoved his hand into his pocket for his phone as he glared at the doorway.
, apparently new to her powers and mastering them even as they were having this confrontation out in the evacuated streets. Smart kid, Tony had to admit. Kept them all busy for more than a few minutes. Just needed some guidance.
“I see friendships have been forged,” Tony said by way of announcing his presence. He pulled out a stool by Natasha and dragged a plate of bacon and eggs toward himself. It had definitely been prepared by his kitchen staff. He was sure Clint would have burnt the eggs just because he could.
Steve snorted. He’d seen those in his nightly wanderings and they didn’t look very appealing. He shook his head. “No,” he said, “I’d want to go somewhere lively, spend time with people I care about. I’d want to visit Coney Island again.” He glanced over at Tony, who was gazing out the window, eyes unfocused but nodding at Steve’s words. “We could go there, go on all the rides.” And he could picture himself walking on the boardwalk, Tony dragging him along through the crowds. “I want to try eating cotton candy.” He remembered the sweetness, the way it melts, how he and Bucky had shared a small ball of it, fighting over who gets to hold it and laughing when they’d kept walking into people. “I can show you up at the games, win and rub it in your face.” And he pictured winning a trinket, presenting it to Tony, Tony smiling and—
Steve looked taken aback for a moment, but pulled out the black phone. They both looked at it, as if it would ring under the scrutiny, but it stayed dark and silent.
, and it broke the reactor and tried to use my ghost to gain more power and Steve traded mine for his and now he’s gone and that entity is
deep into the night and even if Steve didn’t need to sleep, Tony surely did; Tony had become increasingly manic with each passing day that he’d slept badly. On the month anniversary since Steve had appeared as a ghost, and after night after night after night of increasingly numerous hauntings which had resulted in Steve forgoing his wandering of the grounds to actively watching over Tony’s sleep, hoping to drag off the clawing entities before they left physical injuries on Tony, Tony was the one to sit Steve down for a talk.
Stark stood with a cocked hip and continued to study Steve, and Steve tried hard to keep his worry out of his face, to push forward the earnest happiness his chest was pumping out to the rest of his body.
“Alright, Stark,” he called, “Time to get you home before you end up on the wrong side of the tracks again.”
Steve smiled, happy for the first time in too long. “Then I look forward to us working together once again, Shellhead.”
He stepped right through the door of the car and took a seat by Tony, reaching back to deposit the shield in the backseat. Tony didn’t show any indication of knowing Steve was present but he shifted at the sound of the shield touching the leather.
The Captain looked away, guilt written across every feature not covered by his blue helmet. "He's still—we left him back there."
Around them, the newly opened Café Auviene is bustling with noon activity. The name is a little inaccurate and pretentious but the food is more than decent. Tourists and locals alike make their orders, talk about their day or, in the case of the occupants of the table in the corner, make plans for an “exchange” to happen tomorrow at midnight. She’ll follow up on that after this but now-
any of it. He’d stopped wandering the city alone, then. He could take not touching but nothing threw him off more than missing a smell, especially with his senses as enhanced as they had been. From everything to nothing had been more noticeable than he would have thought.
In a flash of light, the claws vanished and Tony managed to draw in a painless breath. He thought he saw a face with an expression twisted in worry hover over him. He tried to say he was fine, tried to placate the Worried Face but his lips refused to move.
Tony cursed out loud then swooped down to take Clint and Natasha with him to the other giant possessed mascot they had to take care of.
After a long while, Tony decided that watching Steve develop a crick in his neck was going to give himself a crick in his own neck. He pulled out his pocket tools and picked himself out of the cell, then took his pillow and blankets and laid them gently on the desk then turned to the gently snoring Steve.
Woah, okay! I hope that was as enjoyable as it was for me to write it! To disambiguate, I enjoyed writing it very much!
Tony chuckled at the old joke. “He got it from a strange fellow on one of his hunting trips,” he said. “The strange fellow gave him the most fascinating quiver I have ever laid eyes on.” Tony accepted the cards from Steve then started flipping the cards to their right side. What was Steve doing to them? “When attached to Barton’s belt, he could just reach down, turn the plate, and the desired arrow would rotate into place and pop out on top for taking.”
This close, he could smell the sooty, metallic tang that always hovered around Tony. He slid off and teased at the skin under the head with his lips where Tony was most sensitive. It earned him a sharp intake of breath and a hard tug at his scalp. With his free hand, he reached up and under Tony's shirts to rub soothingly at Tony's chest. Tony's breathing slowed just a little, his thighs relaxing. Steve gave the side of Tony's cock a sloppy kiss then dove down, sheathing his mouth upon Tony's girth until his nose bumped wiry hair and skin.
T'Challa should return to his jet – return to the captive, his fugitives, and his home to put his father to rest – but though he has nothing owed to Stark, he felt he should give him the benefit of sympathetic ears; he wasn't sure the man had anyone else who would understand him. He wasn't sure the man would ever turn to anyone else for this.
Tony tilts his head like Peggy had, expression unnatural in its childish inquiry, eyes flashing an unnatural green. “If you let me have you, I will let you out to save them. You can die for something good. Something great. Let me have you?”
“Ta think he came from big money, eh, Steve?” Bucky asked from beside him. He gestured widely with his own mug of cider at the spectacle of Tony trying to sing and dance a jig to little success. Tony tripped on his own feet, taking down three giggling girls with a bark of laughter. “Well maybe I do believe it, come that sight.”
Rhodey and Sam put their hands up immediately. Bucky looks at Clint and gives him a hard nudge and Clint immediately raises his own hand. The four of them look at Natasha intently.
And he thought he’d made friends in this new life. Over time, they’d brushed the title aside and treated him like just any other hero wanting to do
“You could look less like you’re going to your execution,” Ton—Stark said from across the back seat of the car.
“You know I want you. Always have,” Tony said, hands shaking for entirely different reasons. “Whammy or no.” He stood, reservations cast to the winds.
“Doctor, Mister Stark listens to you, so please talk some sense into him. We are getting tired of the—as Vision so helpfully says—unresolved tension that is clearly running between them. The Captain likes to drill us hard when he is lovesick.”
“I want you to know I'm not going to leave you after we have sex. That was never an option. I'm not with you now just to get sex. But I've also wanted you for a long time, and I'm going to keep wanting you. That’s not something I can deny."
"Can I trust he will be delivered to the right authorities without further injuries?" T'Challa asked as a matter of course.
Tony groaned long and loud, theatrical for his own sake, and tried and failed to not think about the softness of Steve’s skin as he reached between his legs again. This was torture.
PLASM had not made it better, putting him through a rigorous panel of tests, asking him to recall all the details he ever knew of his life. They’d put him in numerous machines and made him do various things like walk through walls and pick up objects (he strangely could do the first only sometimes and could never do the latter). They put living people and spirits in front of him but he could touch neither. Once he had been deemed somewhat explicable, he had been handed over to the Avengers, who’d been tasked with the long term mission of helping him move on, with hopefully no actual avenging.
“You get to face the door, Mister Stark,” Steve said. He gave Tony’s cock one stroke, taking in Tony’s choked sob, then gripped at Tony’s hips.
After a small fire and an almost literal heart attack (he needed to improve the shield on the arc reactor; he shouldn’t have forgotten, yet he had), he had gone back to the drawing board. Steve had laughed at his singed eyebrows but Tony could see the worry in those translucent eyes of his. Tony had refused to let it warm his poor heart but it had happened anyway. He knew Steve was trying to not smother him in protection like he initially had with the sleeping thing but Tony appreciated it, especially since the hauntings seem to have stopped altogether.
The major news stations were already covering the earlier fight a few blocks down from Midtown but looking at the unruffled faces passing him now, Steve had to wonder what
He closed his eyes. “Continue Phase Two tomorrow, J,” he said in lieu of wallowing in Steve’s non-response. He was achingly hard again, his body having apparently recovered during the down time. Wallowing or no, thinking about Steve was enough to get his heart pumping hard again, not to mention the steadily more insistent fantasies of Steve clothed, Steve unclothed—
But it wasn’t letting him take them back. Something was resisting it. The Stone had manifested and he was holding it. He knew that. The Stone was in his will. He could
It was meant to be a day of celebration. Steve’s first year as Sheriff since he arrived in Timely. Tony’s first year staying put in one place since the War. They didn’t give a reason for why they were having a gathering, but the town didn’t need one to have some fun. Almost everyone in town had turned up at the inn for a good night.
“What’s rummy?” Steve asked, seating himself on the ground opposite Tony on the other side of the bars.
"I know the truth about Zemo," he said. "His plans to fracture your Avengers. The framed bombing. The video of the Stark's death. The Winter Soldier program. All of it." He tucked his helmet under an arm and spread his other arm wide, claws retracted in a show of peace. "As of now, I only wish to help you."
There was a pause and a faint grunt before Steve answered him. “Of course I’m touching myself. Should I stop?”
. If magic existed, then it was science. And Tony knew science. And science wasn’t magic because by definition, science defined things whereas magic was a load of hocus pocus nonsen—
. Anything was possible, right? Three certainties in life, and Tony thought he should just live by the second one.
Mostly, Sam thinks it helped with team bonding. Except for himself, Rhodey, and Steve, the rest of the core team had been civilians. And born only a year ago in the case of Vision. Natasha had just been happy to not be a part of SHIELD/HYDRA. And the Avengers definitely aren’t military.
Tony sat up with a sigh. He took the food from U and waved the little bot off with a pat; he hadn't had food for almost twelve hours and he'd probably need the fluids. He ate the burger in three bites and chugged down the smoothie before continuing.
“Right now," Steve said, breath ghosting over Tony's lips. "I just want to see you come. Then you can fuck me through a bed.”
There are faceless men standing behind and around Tony, forcing his shoulders back and pushing his head down again and again into a barrel of dirty water. They’re jeering at Tony, calling him a murderer, a god of death, a war profiteer, a whore, a corporate negligee. The box in Tony’s hand is sparking - a battery - and Tony is drowning.
“Tony,” Steve said firmly. “You were one of my best friends. We have issues to work through but I still want you in my life” —he took a deep breath and let go of Tony’s wrist to lace their fingers together, palm to palm— “and
He sat up and pushed Bruce away roughly. The workshop around them was empty. No one else was there apart from Bruce and the only other movement was from DUM-E and U’s frantic wheeling.
Tony stood slowly and thought over what had just transpired. Steve was his friend. Steve was his good friend. Steve was probably his best friend in this town and the only person besides Bruce to whom he would trust with his life. Tony did not need more that what he already had. And what he had with Steve now, he would always treasure.
Steve cleared his throat and dragged his thoughts away from the increasingly inappropriate daydreams that were flashing through his mind. “What about you?” he said, waving a hand at Tony. “What would you do?” Wait. That didn’t come out right—
As they stood staring at each other with random pedestrians passing them by without a second glance, Steve saw Stark’s hands uncurl and his arms unfold. Stark reached up and plucked his sunglasses from his face, revealing the bright, brown eyes that the internet liked to focus on. They’re filled with emotion now, widened in something like wonder, and they crinkled a little in the corners as Stark smiled at him like he was glad for having misjudged Steve. It was an honest and trusting expression and Steve found that he liked it.
“I know you have a comfortable bed, Sheriff,” Tony said quietly to the room at large, “And so do I for that matter, but you are simply too heavy for me to carry so this will have to do.”
“Fury has a point,” Steve said through the team's comms, interrupting Tony’s increasingly off topic train of thought.
Tony’s private floor of Avengers Tower was quiet when Steve walked in. He hadn’t been to this floor since before the Civil War and he hadn’t really expected for his old codes to work anymore but they had unlocked the doors just like old times. Just like when he’d been welcome to go in and out of Tony’s rooms as he’d pleased.
Steve blinked and Tony could see him put together everything that had transpired. Confusion, to horror, resignation, acceptance, bliss, more confusion, and finally, realization. Good, because Tony didn’t think he had the energy for longwinded explanations. The numbness was travelling up his neck and he couldn’t feel his heartbeat anymore.
Through his cameras, Tony saw the Trap lift off the ground and he made a split second decision and flew straight through the maelstrom to pin the Trap to the ruined lawn. He missed the Trap entirely, hitting the lawn a foot from it instead. Out of sheer dumb luck, his flailing arms managed to grab onto the Trap before it flew off. He thought he heard Steve yell at him over the comms but he held down tighter on the Trap, thrusters pinning him to the ground, the energies whirling around him, and he waited the storm out.
century, even coming from someone who didn’t even know him: people have preconceived images of him. At SHIELD in his Captain America persona, all the agents fawned over him, idolized him and idealized him. They judged him and put him in a box. It was stifling and it was restrictive and Steve wanted to get away. Steve knew he wasn’t only Captain America – the title, the “Legend” – but all his meaningful interactions have been with SHIELD and the Avengers as Captain America and he really wanted to get away from fronting that persona all the time.
Back in the room, his observation room, he stared out into the city he’d once loved. It had changed so much, new buildings rising and falling as the powers around them warred over nothing and everything. His was a dying breed. Hunted. Killed. Experimented on. Any one of these buildings around this nest of backstabbing liars could still have a friend or two of his in it. Screaming, dying. He used to fly through the skyscrapers, an armored arm around his ribs as held tight to an armored shoulder. He remembered the laughter and the joy. The smile framed in red and gold. The easy silences and the purposeful days. The lazy afternoons and the heated nights.
The agent huffed out a laugh at the lie, still breathing hard. They were well trained, Steve knew. This new life needed tougher enforcers and SHIELD had done an admirable job of breeding them. Too bad they weren’t as tough as the capes. As tough as Steve.
Bucky shrugs. “Doesn’t stop you from just asking over your little video calls. And emails. And instant messages. And—“
Bruce nods in agreement. They stop by the library and knock on the doors. No answer came so they open the doors and peer in. The sunlight is streaming through one of the far windows, lighting on an armchair with its cushions still disheveled and compressed from someone sitting there. A book lies open, face down on the small table next to it. Bruce isn't able to make out a title but it looks like a classic.
Natasha smiles and stands, looping her arm through his as they walk out the front door and ignoring the cameras and phones aimed their way. They do make a lovely couple. Too bad it was only this way in the gossip columns; they both have their eyes set on other people.
Tony was not doing this. This was going to undo all his hard work. Undo the little bit of happiness he’d been trying to build with Steve, to
Tony laughed out loud, a hand thumping the bed between them. “We’ll see about that, Captain Arrogant.”
Down in Tony’s private workshop, Tony shed the suit and freed himself into the cool, filtered air. His crotch thanked him but also screamed at him for more contact. More pressure. More friction. More more more—
Steve is standing in Tony’s workshop. The light is dim and he can’t see beyond five feet around him. He turns and tries to find Tony, or anyone else, and he is met with emptiness. As he weaves around the benches to where he knows the door should be, the details around him change, some features sharpening and some blurring into the haze beyond. The surroundings distort and shuffle again, and suddenly Steve is staring down at Tony working on something at his old holostation.
Stark clenched his fist on the seat between them – his uninjured hand. “Disingenuous as always,” he said. He turned to face Steve fully, and Steve caught sight of a wince at the corner of his mouth. “It’s a work in progress and the people wanted accountability for the death and destruction that tends to follow in your—in our wake.” Steve snorted at that, lips curled in disgust but Tony continued, unhindered. “You can’t tell me you want us to walk away without consequence every time we happen to level a building full of people?”
Natasha huffs in amusement. “Sure you don’t want to come up?” she asks, indicating behind her. “You have half a minute before the fliers descend on you and then you won’t be leaving until after three meals and a party and an after party and an after party party.”
And in the limo back to Tony's tower, he finally did. He took Tony apart slowly, stroking him and touching him without undoing a single button. He loved the tightness of the muscles cording Tony's arms. He loved the quiver of his stomach as he rutted their fully clothed hips together. He
Senators with bold patterned ties that flashed interesting colors under the flashbulbs of cameras. Businessmen in pinstripes, eager to shake his hand, to pat him on the shoulder and pose for photographs. Howard Stark, who only wore suits on occasion that were almost indecently trimmed. But Steve hadn't had the heart to admire it. He'd dropped himself into the middle of the war and he focused all his effort on defeating HYDRA. And when the icy waters were rushing over his head, well, there was no heart in him for anything more than to feel peace in the encroaching darkness.
