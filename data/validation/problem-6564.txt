A smile crossed Steve’s lips. With one last nod to himself, he opened the bottle of lube and poured some into his palm, coating his fingers with it. With his free hand, he pushed Tony’s left leg a bit further upwards, then inspected his opening. It was so
me to let it go?” Steve asked, and Tony only pressed his lips together, for once unable to find a proper answer. Steve sighed. “You know we have to talk about it eventually.”
Captain America, that couldn’t be all that comfortable. He tried to move, but only managed a pitiful try at rolling off of Steve, and by the time he geared his body for a second try, Steve had already wrapped an arm around him.
Bruce nodded like all of this wasn’t a big deal, and only just turned around to hide a wistful smile of his own. “Good.” He pointed at the shopping bags next to the counter. “There’s fresh fruit in there. Help me cut it?”
Had the others actually expected them to hook up at some point? Tony couldn’t remember ever having given off any signs that he was interested in Steve like this. Or vice versa, for that matter. Well, sure, there had been that intense sort of tension between them from the start, but that had been animosity at best, right? They’d yelled at each other, they’d bickered and teased each other all the time. Only when they did get along, they were in sync in easy seconds and…
It was the wrong thing to say, that much was clear. Steve’s brows furrowed, and Tony could see determination sink in quickly.
“I keep telling you. It shouldn’t be a surprise.” Natasha grinned and brushed a kiss across his forehead, before sliding into the seat next to him. “The twins are in the armory with Clint,” she told him. “Vision is… walking around, watching everyone. Thor’s staying close, for now. When Tony’s done, I think we’re good to go.”
“No.” Natasha smiled and cast a long glance in the direction of the elevator. “Tony said it’ll be another fifteen before the arm’s back online, and that doesn’t include any fine-tuning, so I think James is out of the picture.”
Doubt flickered in Bucky’s eyes, along with confusion and fear. There was no belief yet… but there was the space for it. Then, anger overwhelmed his features as he threw another punch, screaming, “Shut up!”
Steve was always turning his world upside down so effortlessly. He wondered if he even realized he was doing it.
TS 3:42 A.M.>Good. That’s good. Sry for being melodramatic. I didn’t see anyone either, hence the blue balls. I’ll write you when I’m back?
They were both sitting on the benches in the hallway now. The clock next to Bucky’s room was ticking away, loud and relentless, making it hard to ignore how long Tony and Bruce had been in there by now.
Obligingly, the man walked out into the direct light above him. He seemed familiar in a surreal sort of way, like he’d been dreaming of this face, dreaming of what the person attached to that face had done to him.
So Tony tugged off his shirt next, and opened his belt without taking his eyes off of Steve. He couldn’t help but grin, cocking his head. “Any surface is fine, really.”
He’d never gotten his hands on a private picture of Tony as a baby. There were only the professional photo-shoots Maria and Howard had made him go through in the early years, and then, everything the paparazzi had caught him doing. Tony’s life wasn’t anything but well documented, but this… this was something rare, something special.
Steve’s other hand pressed against Tony’s cheek, his fingers lightly exploring the softened hair in Tony’s neck. “I’m so sorry you got hurt,” he spoke quietly. “I don’t think I’ve… I didn’t think this through. I was reckless, and impulsive…”
Vision’s mouth twitched with another smile as he stepped closer, motioning them to the wall. “I suggest you step into the armor, and Captain, you should be using your shield, just in case.” He turned around, glancing at the ceiling just as a first
“It’s more than I ever thought I’d get, so.” Tony brushed a finger along Steve’s cheek. “We just have to make it count.”
There wasn’t an inch of him that didn’t tremble with awe. “Perfect,” he mumbled, completely sated and feeling full in so many wonderful ways.
Steve shrugged, a touch irritated with himself. He was so ready for action—any action—that he didn't think it would matter. Clearly, he'd been wrong about that. The gentle way with which Tony treated him now was making Steve a little impatient.
. He chuckled softly, brushing his fingers along Steve’s neck. “I’m good. Walking will be a challenge, but you only did what I asked for, so no need to worry.”
pressed against each other, with Steve brushing his fingers over Tony’s arms, and his back, tracing his muscles, and…
“Uh-uh,” Tony started, and let himself fall back into the chair, “And you know that I could just track your location, right?”
There was a very long, very heavy silence, and Steve watched as Tony’s mouth opened in disbelief. “The
"Don't get your panties in a twist, Cap," Natasha said, flippant and unperturbed as she shifted in her seat and leveled him with a smirking stare. "A little friendly teasing never killed anyone."
Steve whirled around and took off, hard and fast, in the other direction. He threw open the front door, raced across the hallways and through the windows between the living complexes, desperate to keep up with the colorful flash ahead of him.
“Just doing what I can to keep it together,” he paused, getting a look at the expression on her face. “Won’t let anything happen to either of them.”
burn up, two years ago. So I’m gonna ask exactly one more time before I raise the alarm: Who. Are. You?”
They all likely threw a lot of commentary and innuendos their way, but Tony didn’t even listen. As soon as the elevator doors closed, he barreled into Steve, pressing him into the backrest. He closed his eyes as they kissed, and in this moment, Steve became
In the end, though, it took the whole rest of the day and a few hours into the night before Steve finally woke up. First his fingers twitched, then he furrowed his brows, slowly blinking himself to alertness.
Before he knew what was happening, Steve was pressed with his back against a pillar and a knife at his throat. He got a few more hits to the head that almost had him lose consciousness, but eventually, the man in front of him looked to be a second from finally driving the knife home.
“Me neither,” Tony breathed before leaning in and kissing Steve square on the mouth. He brushed his tongue along Steve’s lips, a small growl clamoring through his throat.
Steve clenched his jaw, then threw his shield at Ultron while dodging another blast. He effectively sank it right into Ultron’s armor, causing a deep lash in his torso. “Your definition of ‘change’? I wouldn’t call it a comfort.”
Steve shook his head, and it was still so fucking strange to see him, and not see him at the same time. “I don’t have all the answers. I came here in hope we could find a solution together.”
“Oh,” Rhodes voiced numbly, then his eyes widened. “Oh!” He stepped back, looking at both of them, then at Natasha, who merely nodded without even taking her eyes off the magazine in her hands.
And it made him wonder… What would Tony—back in 2018—think if he found out about them? About their marriage? He’d be just as shocked as Steve had been, sure, but apart from that… Steve had no idea whatsoever how Tony would react.
There was almost no chance—not even for Tony, which was saying something—that they could avoid each other all the time. And maybe,
TS 2:43 A.M.>FRIDAY says you got banged up but you’re fine. Mostly. So. Get well soon, and call me? Or something. I hope you’re ok. In any case, Happy New Year and… come back soon
Soon after, Ian was fighting the bottle, pushing it away and crying. Tony jostled him a bit, but he wouldn’t settle down. Something was missing. Out of place. And Ian was too clever not to notice.
“Yeah!” Tony exclaimed. “It’s… well, I brought the supplies, and I kinda planned to cook for everyone, but it’s just…”
“A world of no,” Tony said, shuddering. He knew Steve meant well, buying him all kinds of extravagant drinks so he wouldn’t feel left out whenever the others got a bit drunk, but… most of the nonalcoholic beers were a travesty. “Soda’s fine. Thanks.”
“Sometime, yes,” Tony agreed softly, and leaned in to kiss Steve’s lips once more. When they broke apart, he twirled the sunglasses in his hand, looking down at it. “I thought I’d call it Binarily Augmented Retro Framing.”
"What you're suggesting is… It's too risky for me," he added, and immediately knew this would backfire. He knew he shouldn't be saying anything to give any illusion that he might be interested but he couldn't bring himself to lie. "I'm sorry."
“You seem stressed,” Tony said, his voice a bit toned down. The others were immersed in the movie again, with Thor’s laughter and Clint’s random snorts resounding in the room, but Tony could see that Steve wasn’t really into it. He had that look again, like his thoughts were locked up in a whole other lifetime, and while Tony couldn’t exactly relate, he did feel sympathy for the guy. Hard to imagine having lost everyone you ever knew, and a whole world as well, in the blink of an eye.
read the whole thing in one go now and gave me a few great pointers, and generally improved it a whole lot, so I think it's actually finished (Yay!). I will post every Sunday and maybe 1-2 times in between
“That’s not…” Bruce trailed off, leaning down to examine the disc beneath the microscope. After a moment, a sigh left his lips and he glanced up at Tony with an expression that was half exasperation and half pride. “Alright, genius. Let’s go over the formula again, see if it works in theory, and once the new equipment is set up, we can do some test runs.”
Tony smiled that special crooked smile of his, a look of curious wonder on his face. “And what particular moment would you want to keep?”
Steve walked up closer to Tony. “Why are you so angry at me? I didn’t—I could’ve reacted better, I know that, and I’m sorry, okay? You surprised me and—”
A few beats ticked by, the air lingering with their mingled breaths. Then, Natasha glanced up pensively, her eyes focusing on something across the room instead of looking at Steve. “Even if he is still there. Decades of indoctrination won’t just vanish into thin air. He’s not just going to know right from wrong because you want him to,” she said haltingly. “Even if you get through to him, he’s
Steve looked down at himself, at his brown pants, his tattered leather jacket and the blue shirt with the white star beneath.
"You're dealing with a minor," he said promptly, giving the woman a pointed look. "I'd keep my distance if I were you." He turned on his heels then, only to find Bucky standing a step behind him, just as he’d suspected. Steve clapped his shoulder with a tight lipped expression that showed every ounce of fury Tony's comment had lit up. "Come on."
God, Tony had failed him. Steve had given him everything—even his life. And Tony had given him nothing. Only a resentful heart, a stony purpose and iron contempt. In his self-absorption he had never tried to make amends properly, had never tried to get over all the bitterness.
“I know, but I wanted to. I just… had to work through a few things first. Mostly I tried not to freak out that I’d actually worked with you guys.”
It was a miracle that Tony could navigate himself anywhere under these circumstances; much less to the safe house’s observation room where they’d be supervising the fight from afar.
“You can get them out later. I’ll help you, but for now, you gotta leave them behind. And you don’t have much time. Give me the coordinates.”
Those words followed Steve through his day. Tony was with him when he showered in his SHIELD room. He stood next to the window as he combed his hair. He smirked at him as he rifled through his new drawer and pouted when he put on clothes. He brushed his lips across Steve’s before he left his room, promising he would be there when he returned.
“First correction, I am Swiss,” Zola said with his strangely distorted voice. “Second, look around you, I have never been more alive! In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body. My mind, however, that was worth saving, on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing
Tony’s head had tilted as he considered him. “Are you alright? You seem… I don’t know. Like something’s bothering you.”
“Tony…” Steve warned, but it was without any heat. Ever since their first encounter a couple of weeks ago, he kept thinking about their kiss. And no matter what Tony was ranting about, Steve knew perfectly well that all of this wasn’t real—not when he was truly lying on some hard cot on the front lines of a horrible war.
No, Steve was standing firm, and gradually, Tony began to realize that there was every chance he wouldn’t budge in the slightest.
“What? You gotta warn me,” Tony said. “It’s only a matter of time till my kid will slam his door into my face and listen to music I hate and meet people I despise.”
Immediately, Steve felt guilty for thinking that Tony had abandoned him. Instead, he started to worry.
Still. Tony realized he’d take all that if only Steve wouldn’t be sitting here all night, drowning himself in whatever morals-misery he’d conjured up in his mind.
Steve kissed his shoulders, his arms holding him tight, their breathing settled into something resembling normalcy. He realized his hands were shaking when he tried to turn Tony around, gathering him close and holding him in the aftermath. Tony burrowed into his arms, his hand reaching for him, drawing it over his side.
After Ian had finished his bottle and burped loudly over Tony’s shoulder, Tony took him down to the common floor. As soon as he stepped out of the elevator, however, the phone in his pocket vibrated with a message. Picking up the device with one hand, he realized it was just an automatic notification of someone adding an entry to his calendar.
The painting in their bedroom was missing because it had yet to be painted. The blue circle that had always seemed so abstract, so other-worldly was now something cherished and familiar. And Steve could already see himself standing at that wooden easel and put those colours together.
Tony turned his head sideways and cast Bruce a bored expression. “Spoilsport,” he said, just as Stevepulled his hand back so fast that Tony almost tipped over.
God, he really needed to stop thinking about this, else he’d start to get horny all the time; and the RV offered little privacy. Thus, instead of dwelling on the texture of Steve’s lips, Tony finished up and washed his hands. Outside of the restroom, Tony immediately spotted Steve and Bucky walking towards the snacks aisle inside the shop. He whirled around, turning his back to them, and plucked a random tourism pamphlet off the back wall, holding it in front of his head.
“Fair enough,” Tony said, having half a mind to just tear off his own clothes, rendering all of them useless so Steve had to follow through with his little dare, but he was too busy
Tony shrugged, and glanced at Steve. “Yeah.” His face softened slightly as he stared back at the ground. “Yeah, make it count.” He cleared his throat, calling over his shoulder as he turned around. “You two should get inside, by the way, we got a surprise visitor you might wanna see.”
For now, though, there was waiting. Steve took hold of his sketchbook, retreated outside to set up his tent, and waited for Rhodes and Tony to return.
Reaching for Steve, clasping the hand around his, he dragged Steve back on top of him. The first contact of their dicks brushing along another was heavenly and Tony groaned as he wound one leg around Steve’s hips to draw him even nearer.
Of course he didn’t remember. This was going to be great. “Yes—I’m gonna leave. Still got that apartment in Brooklyn, so I won’t be far away. I’ll leave the city for two or three weeks, but after that, I’ll be ready on call.”
"I usually don't call them dates," Steve said, eyes set on Tony even as he was efficiently ridding himself of his utility belt and pushing down his pants. It was all so fast, and already getting quite hot.
institution—to push their own interests down on the team, it wasn’t something Steve could stand for. It had been the same with the World Security Council, the same with SHIELD. He knew that doing this now would be something he’d regret forever.
“Means to an end,” Tony explained, drumming his fingers on the table a few times before he looked back up to meet Pepper’s stare. “Banner agreed to work on the arc reactor with me. Now we need partners. Partners who know what they’re doing in their respective fields. And we need them fast if I want to do this while I still have investors.”
“Are we on the path yet?” Natasha asked, while glancing down on the streets. They had still about thirty miles to go, and the traffic didn’t seem to let up any time soon.
Steve shook his head and took Tony’s hands in his. “I—God, I didn’t even think about telling you, because didn’t realize you wouldn’t know.”
“I didn’t have the time!” Tony protested. “And Extremis is a constant presence, that doesn’t mean I get lost in it. I got it under control, and whenever I’m with you, I’m
That was the first thing Steve could even think about, his mouth going dry. The guy looked like he was taken right out of a magazine, even now, late in the evening. Steve wanted to reach for him, trace the fine fabric that hugged that body just right. He'd only seen bits of what Tony looked like naked, but the idea of undressing him
Steve nodded. Natasha was right, of course. In two weeks, freshman orientation would begin and that meant that, if Steve wanted to get his friend back, he needed to make every second count.
“I remember everything,” Bucky replied, sounding terribly defeated. “I remember how she looked at me. I remember that choking her had meant nothing to me, and it… it killed me every time I looked at you. I wish I could give you his regret, but the man I was back then wasn’t able to feel anything. He didn’t care, he couldn’t. I just… I am sorry
"I pushed him away, Buck. For good..." He sighed and shook his head, getting up and going to fetch his bag.
“Yes,” Tony agreed. “In fact, I think that… you and me going camping is a really great idea. Unexpected, maybe. But great.”
“No, not really.” Steve was sitting in the reading chair next to the large window front, a book in his hands.
The limousine neared the mansion’s main entry and that was when Steve saw them. There was a group of strangers on Stark Mansion’s steps. The staff, Steve supposed. People whose station had been his own just a few weeks ago.
As Tony made his way through the hallway leading to Barnes’ room, he came across Steve and Natasha. Every waking hour, they were seated side by side in the hallway of the infirmary. They didn’t talk, as far as Tony knew. There was still this icy distance between them, and above that—whenever Tony walked past them, the air was thick with anticipation. They were expecting him to finally offer the solution to everything on a silver plate, as if he was the only one who could do so. It left him both pleased and scared shitless of failure. If Bucky Barnes died at their hands, the consequences could be inexorable.
A heavy weight compressed Tony’s shoulders and his insides were pooled with dread. Ultron’s presence was right
Bucky was circling the room. His gaze flickered back and forth between the grand open space of the sofa area, the bar, the ceiling-high glass front leading up to the tower’s roof and the New York skyline. Steve knew it had to be at least a little overwhelming. Even though Steve had been living here for a good while now, that still hadn’t changed. Sometimes, when he walked into the kitchen in the morning to make both him and Tony a coffee, he paused and simply stared.
Tony was quiet for a moment, probably weighing his words carefully. And probably also realizing that Steve already knew all there was to know. There was simply no reason to keep secrets from him.
This is it folks! Last chapter :) I will post a Bonus chapter in a week or two, but otherwise, this is it. I know a few asked if I would solve the issues Civil War created and I did, in parts, but I also didn't, because I really want to be able to eventually continue this series when MCU moves on to Infinity War.
The word sounded ridiculously cheesy to his ears, but it didn’t make it any less true. He’d thought, on some level, their few shared nights would have prepared him for this, but he was wrong. So incredibly wrong. And now that he was inside Tony, Steve felt at last that he did own him—at least a small part.
Tony nodded. “Her shadow has been between us all the time. Since the moment we arrived here. And even now… even in death she’s one step ahead of me.”
He wasn’t listening to Tony. “Hold still,” he ordered, setting Tony atop the island. “You’re bleeding.”
Barnes was quiet for a long minute, his attention focused on the half-empty bottle next to Tony. “What are you doing?”
“I wanted to tell you earlier this night but...” His eyes were starting to feel wet again. Steve hated it.
The testosterone in combination with the super soldier serum made it hard for him to get wet enough for any intrusion. He should have told Tony, should have said something about his body being so unusual...!
“Favorite soldier? You talking about me?” Steve mumbled into the dark hair while he was kissing Tony´s scalp.
“What are they gonna do about it?” His boyfriend smiled. “Kick us out of the restaurant? Us? Two of the Avengers? I don´t think they would dare something like this.”
“Don´t worry, Cap.” He licked his lips again and the simple gesture was enough to take Steve´s breath away. He was aroused only from the kiss they shared a few minutes earlier.
“I promise.” He just had to smile again but Tony didn´t notice. He was excusing himself and hurried back to his workshop. Steve unmuted the TV and the smile froze on his face.
Tony snuggled closer so their thighs touched under the table. Tony´s small hand made its way to Steve´s knee, squeezing gently.
The soldier nodded, just a slight bow of his head and the nurse was on her feet to help him immediately. When the pain finally subsided he closed his eyes again and tried to fall asleep. But he couldn´t stop smiling.
“Brought you bagels,” he said as enthusiastically as he could manage without his voice breaking. He noticed his hands were shaking.
“I even paid her to shut her mouth about that!” Tony huffed at the screen. “This little bitch! I will make her pay for that, I...!”
Tony´s hands looked so small compared to Steve´s own. He found it cute and couldn´t help but kiss his boyfriend over the table of the diner they found themselves in after a long day of preparation for the surgery in two days.
“Do you want to fuck me, Cap? Because I want you to fuck me” he purred. “I have some toys for that occasion upstairs in my room.”
57 minutes later Tony landed in front of the apartment building Captain America was currently living in, a bag of freshly baked bagels in his right hand. He quickly made his way up the stairs. The floor only had to apartments, one without a name tag next to the door. Tony figured this must be it and knocked.
“Oh,” Steve said, confusion showing clearly on his face. Steve had the opposite of a pokerface and if he hadn´t been Captain America Tony would have probably found that endearing. Who was he kidding? He absolutely found it endearing even though Steve was twice as heavy as himself and could punch through a tank.
“We could pick up bagels on the way,” Tony suggested rather to himself than to JARVIS. He could hear the AI sigh.
Steve was on his feet within a second, grabbing Tony´s right hand and holding it tightly between his.
Steve swallowed hard and tried to calm his racing heart down by some breathing techniques he learned during WW2. It wasn´t helping. Tony reached out for his hand and squeezed gently. He was only smiling for Steve´s sake, the soldier knew that and he was thankful for it.
“Yes,” Steve answered. He sounded out of breath. He couldn´t tell the other man. The night went so well, he had fun and he enjoyed kissing Tony. There was no way he was going to ruin that with a confession like this.
His head was resting on Steve´s shoulder. The position looked really uncomfortable but the billionaire didn´t move an inch, just snuggling closer, careful not to hurt his taller boyfriend.
Two of the men helped Happy taking Tony down. His legs immediately collapsed under him. Happy untied the rope around his wrists, helping Tony into an upright position.
“Seriously, Rogers?” Tony smirked and nodded to the tiny chain. “You just open the door to anyone who knocks? I could have been a crazy axemurderer. Or one of Jehova´s witnesses.”
A loud, genuine laugh escaped the soldier. He pulled Tony closer to kiss him with a smile. Everything was going to be alright.
“Fuck you and your language!” He nearly screamed. “I wanted to make you happy! I didn´t want the world to know about...”
“Thanks,” he said in a carefree tone of voice. Tony didn´t need to be the genius he was to notice Steve faked it. “You want anything with it? Coffee? Eggs? Cheese?”
They chatted while enjoying expensive wine and delicious steak with baked potatoes. Their topics changed from work to more private matters like Steve´s life before the war or Tony´s not so happy childhood. And Steve still couldn´t bring himself to reveal his past life as a woman to the billionaire.
“Any news, JARVIS?” he asked his AI. A bone crushing exhaustion had come over his body but his mind was still running laps. He didn´t want to sleep and at the same time didn´t want to stay awake. But when he was asleep he couldn´t control his thoughts, couldn´t keep the memories away so he´d rather stay awake and in control for as long as possible. It had been barely 30 hours since he last slept, he could easily last another day or so.
“Don´t look at me like that!” Tony pouted. “That´s the “I´m disappointed” stare and I don´t deserve that!”
“JARVIS told me you had a panic attack.” He was still watching Tony out of those perfect, blue eyes.
Steve smiled at himself, rested his head back on the pillow and waited until Tony entered the room in a hurry. The soldier laughed at the sight of his boyfriend.
“Penises of trans-men!” Tony´s voice was far too loud this early in the morning. “The surgeon takes a part of the forearm and forms a phallus that develops sensation over the course of a year. You can even get an erection rod and get a boner if you want to.”
“Eggs would be nice.” Tony carefully followed the Captain to the kitchen. Even though the apartment wasn´t that big it looked empty. Steve, who was a big man by all means, looked small in it, almost as if he was a stranger in his own house.
“Good morning, Captain,” she said, obviously excited to meet the famous Avenger, but Steve felt too dizzy to care. “The operation went well. There were no complications and you didn´t even need a blood conserve.”
Tony was glowing. He smiled and laughed genuinely at the soldier´s stories from his childhood. While telling his own stories Tony always chose the right words. It was fun listening to him and whenever he talked about his robots his voice would go up a pitch. Steve couldn´t help but think about a proud mother talking about her children. He found it cute.
Steve smiled brightly at him, a happy, honest smile. Tony felt the soldier gently pulling him closer. Tony didn´t object. He let himself be pulled in a hug with no input of his own – or so he told himself when Steve wrapped his arms around Tony.
The billionaire looked like he wanted to argue but closed his mouth instead to kiss his taller boyfriend.
When Tony let go of his lips the soldier looked around with his heart pounding in his chest. He tried to tell himself that in the 21th century nobody would mind two men kissing. They would be fine! No need to make himself panic about it.
“Yeah, no, I was just...” Tony nervously ran a hand through his hair until he felt something. His blood ran cold and for a horrible second he thought he might pass out on the spot. Fuck! He was still wearing the collar!
They arrived at the door of Steve´s bedroom where they stopped, Steve´s eyes were glued to the ground.
For a second he actually considered just leaving and hurling himself back into the Iron Man suit he had left in front of the building. But he went to the bathroom instead, spraying his face with cold water. Yep, he was still wearing the collar. There was no way in hell Steve could have overlooked it.  This was worse than all the walks of shame in his life combined.
Steve felt his arousal spark again. Heat was pooling in his lower body when he thought about Tony kneeled down in front of him. The billionaire smirked.
Tony would have preferred passing out over Steve´s eyes flickering to the collar and then back up to his face. He gagged for a second, trying to collect himself before he embarrassed himself even more. Panic was rising in his chest, he couldn´t breath, couldn´t think, just helplessly stare into Steve´s very blue, very concerned eyes.
Tony felt as if he had been crushed by a car. He closed his eyes, taking deep breaths until the panic slowly subsided. Only the exhaustion stayed with him. He couldn´t bring up the courage to open his eyes so he just kept them shut until his breath evened out he was finally – finally! - falling asleep.
He felt Tony´s lips on his again a second later. Slowly he closed his eyes and allowed the billionaire to enter his mouth. Tony tasted like wine and cigarettes and so much more. His tongue gently played with Steve´s, his touches making the soldier relax. He could hardly stop a moan escaping him.
Oh crap! He passed out in Steve´s apartment. Logic dictated that this must have been Steve´s bedroom. If there hadn´t been a burnt looking Captain America uniform hanging next to the wardrobe it could have been a random hotel room anywhere in the US. Tony looked around a little longer. There were no personal belongings other than the uniform, a pair of worn out Converse and a phone charger to be found.
“Sorry for that,” his boss slurred from the backseat. “You know what? Take tomorrow off. I´ll get by for a day without you. Maybe take my private jet and fly to Hawaii for a weekend, how about that?”
“Of course I am,” the soldier replied, absentmindedly petting Tony. “I have waited my whole life for this.”
Like it had said on the ads in front of the club it was a men only night. It sure wasn´t the first time Mr Stark had forced Happy into such a position but even after all those years it never got easier.
Speaking was too difficult at the moment. But he wanted to see if everything between his legs looked like he envisioned. He tried to sit up, his upper body covered by a white shirt. The nurse pushed him back into the pillows.
“Cap, calm down.” The billionaire kissed him affectionately. “I have enough experience for both of us, so don´t stress it.”
“Except for what is between my legs. And when I learned that in the 21th century it is possible to build male genitalia from a forearm I decided to take last step to finish my journey that started in 1936.”
He hurried to pull his pants back up, took his packer and fled towards the elevator. Shame was burning on his cheeks and he wasn´t sure if he could hold back the tears any longer.
So, I have apparently caught a flu that's planning to kill me real slow, so I'm sorry for slower updates. Hope you guys are still here for the rest of the story... This will be a dual-POV chapter.
It had taken a whole day of Tony debating with the US Ambassador of the United Nations to allow Bucky to travel with them to London. A whole day, and an agreement that Bucky would be under strict surveillance the whole time. Outside of the church three task forces were waiting to escort Bucky to the cemetery for Peggy’s burial, and bring him back to New York immediately after. Right behind them, there even sat a UN-assigned psychiatrist that Ross had demanded accompany Bucky at all times.
“I agree,” Natasha said, smiling that bemused smile of hers. “But you’re being evasive about Tony. Don’t think we haven’t noticed.”
“117 countries want to sign this,” Rhodey argued, and Tony wanted to lean over there and kiss his beautiful bald forehead. “And people are afraid.”
All the mercs were wearing at least two guns, and while some looked like they could be trained in hand-to-hand combat, it was more than obvious that they’d be no challenge for him. Then again, they were mercenary soldiers. Mercenary soldiers rarely held any real danger for him.
“Well now,” Tony chuckled against Steve’s lips and gave him one last peck before he drew back. When Steve looked up, Bucky was staring intently at the television. “Couldn’t have that. Now that we just fixed you.”
, socked him right in the jaw, smashing him against the nearest wall so hard he had to stay down for a good few seconds.
“Well, as I said, I have work to do,” Tony announced, casting Steve a strained smile as he walked towards the door again. “Have a good trip, wherever you’re going.”
Vision smiled—the second one—and reached forward, wrapping a hand around Tony’s and keeping it there. “He still is.”
And Steve sat like that, aware of the others talking quietly around him. He heard Bucky and Tony say something about damage limitation, bringing in the Stark Relief Foundation, and funding of repair works and fixes on the Hulkbuster. When Steve looked over to Bruce, who sat in a dark corner of the Quinjet and looked to be on the verge of crying, he put two and two together. It was his job to comfort his team in a situation like this, but his limbs felt heavy, he couldn’t form a clear thought, and all Steve could do was lean back and stare into the distance.
Rhodey sighed, rubbing his forehead. “After you suggested for Car to come along, I thought it wasn’t a big deal to—”
Steve sipped from the beer, and glanced at the armor. As always, it looked magnificent. He could never really get over how amazing it was that Tony could create such wonders with his own two hands. True genius had always impressed him, even when he and Tony hadn’t gotten along in the beginning.
“Among other things, yes,” Tony agreed. “The day he arrives—beautiful, sunny day in April—we aren’t exactly in good shape, and we lose control over the situation. Where—where I come from, we were still fighting but you don’t have to be a futurist to know where we were heading. So I travelled to Nepal. There’s this—there’s this cabal of sorcerers, because of-fucking-course there’s sorcerers these days, too. They have the Time Stone, it was the last gem the warlord was still missing, so that’s where I thought I was needed most. Turns out the Sorcerer Supreme got another idea.”
There was something to be said about waking up and immediately finding someone’s lips planted to your mouth.
“Here goes nothing.” Tony entered the numbers and pushed open the green-lit lock. Behind, he found what looked like a glamorous hospital room. Sheets were folded up on a shelf in preparation for maximum fluid discharge, bottles of water and snacks stood at the ready, the bed was bolted to the floor, and a couch with its back to the window.
The frenetic tension in Steve’s body is a warning for how badly he’s going to get it. Tony isn’t sure he’s going to be able to sit straight after. And everyone will know, they’ll know what he is and he’ll never have any self-respect again as he imagines his teammates, people who he could have called friend, thinking about what Steve did to him in this cluster-fuck of a cave-in.
There’s spittle connecting his mouth to Tony’s cock, and it spasms up in front of him, tapping the bottom of his chin. Steve looks up at Tony’s face, seeing his omega staring back at him slack mouthed, a vision of need and arousal. They lock eyes, and it’s like a shock to the system, like a cold limb being plunged into hot water, almost painful. It’s overwhelming, the intimacy of it, the way Tony looks and
Steve was only able to scent Tony through the cloud of beta cologne the other man wore because of his super senses. It’s how he knows that Tony was coming off a heat– a heat he spent alone.
“Tony, Tony it’s ok, I’ve got you. I have you sweetheart. Going to make you mine. Be a good boy for me, relax, let it go. You’re here.” And it works. Like nothing but JARVIS telling him where he is and the date and time has ever worked. The panic subsides, Steve running his hands up and down Tony’s arms and shoulders, calming and soothing.
“Boys,” Natasha says, and Tony pulls away to see her tapping her food expectantly, ears twitching as they usually are.
“Tony, I just want to say thank you for having us at the tower and maybe— maybe clear the air between us?” Rogers looks so earnest that Tony imagines for a moment that he means it. That it’s not just a tactic to get everyone working together smoothly. Thing is, he’s willing to play the part. Especially just to have Rogers look at him with something that isn’t disdain for a moment before Tony ruins things, like he always does.
“I think it matters now, Tony.” Steve’s voice was brittle, like spun glass, sharp and ready to shatter.
“Ah-ah Cappy. That’s not going to get you what you want anymore. Learn to use your words like a big boy.” He watches Steve clench his fists and unclench them, eyes glued to Tony’s face. Steve would love to put his hands on Tony’s neck, make him submit, Tony can feel it. He half wants the man to try it, maybe see if he can escape. And if he runs, Cap will track him down, and then—and then—he kills that train of thought.
It doesn’t take more than a few more thrusts before the electric storm coalescing at the base of his spine makes its way out of his body, spurts of come painting the towel on the floor.
Even after their moment in the evening where it seemed like Tony cared, it doesn’t get better after their fight. If anything, it’s worse than ever. Tony still can’t cook, and he often needs to be dragged up for lunch, dinner, or off to bed. He swears only a little less and takes his spankings with as much stoicism as he can muster, unabashed at his arousal, and how much it bothers Steve. He gives a leering little smile after that looks more like sharp knives in his mouth than an invitation.
From there, Pepper had tried to comfort Tony, offering to play Omega as much as she could despite being a beta herself. Steve has always thought the majority of their problems derived from their mismatched designations. An Alpha couldn’t physically knot a beta without proper preparation, otherwise there was a risk of internal bleeding. Having to knot outside the body during rut was painful, but necessary if you didn’t have the right genitalia to match with. Tony was just the exception that couldn’t deal with ruts well. Steve and Bucky handled it just fine, finding moderate discomfort better than seeking a rut service.
“I never would have left if he hadn’t hit me, you know? The whole time he’d just been making me miserable over food, over where I was and who I was with, leashing me and dragging me around for show. He’d tell me he was a good husband, providing for me, but I would have rather eaten at the poor house on some days. I should have left sooner. It always gets worse with those kinds of alphas. I didn’t know it then.” Edith is holding her cup, staring deeply into its contents. There’s a little cream from the hot chocolate stuck to her upper lip where she’s been sipping it. If she were his Ma, or his Grandma, he’d wipe it away. He feels like he knows her, like she’s his. If he’d been alpha then, he would have protected her.
“Cap, why can’t you just leave it alone? I don’t think we’ve ever had a conversation that doesn’t end in a fight, and I don’t see it changing any time soon.”
“No! Don’t touch me!” The vehemence with which he spat out the words surprised even him. Steve looked wide-eyed, an innocent expression pasted across his gorgeous face.
It doesn’t stop Tony from envisioning the very moment, so long ago, that he realized Sunset wasn’t going to let him go.
“I’m getting up.” Tony starts to crawl over the bed, and slides off of it onto the floor, dragging the covers and pillow with him.
“He was the one who tried to get your suits, yes? I bet the paperwork saying no hit him so fast he needed reconstructive surgery.” Now Tony cackles at Nat’s crack at the Senator in question. Nat places a proprietary hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Yeah, Tony,” Steve says as he reaches Tony’s half-hard cock. With that, Tony can feel every pump of blood into his dick that makes him harder within seconds of Steve’s touch.
Steve walks in on Tony who has somehow pulled several blood samples out of his own arm, tourniquet still attached. He’s bleeding down his skin as he stares at the holograms in front of him. Tony looks softer, face open and awed at the data he’s examining. It’s a stark contrast from the stormcloud looks Tony often gives his inventions. Steve feels like he’s smoldering just looking at Tony like this. It’s endearing and perfect, watching Tony’s softer lines crease with confusion and frustration.
“Steve,” he breathes out and props himself up. Steve walks into the nest and kneels down in front of Tony.
He doesn’t make it very far as he’s tackled, this time the wolf’s paws hard on his back while he freezes, feeling a whiff of hot air on his neck.
“Stark Tower? That big ugly… building in New York?” Tony glares at him now. It took less than a minute for garbage to come out of Rogers’s mouth. His building is a stunning example of modern architecture. So what if the Captain probably likes his late victorian with a side of musty old curtains and brass fixtures. Tony notes that the Captain must have all-around bad taste. Has he seen his own uniform even?
He pulls Steve out from under his nails, saying goodbye to the intensity and passion which he inflicted on the other man. He scrubs Steve from his glands, flushing his ignorant body’s hopes of anything that looks like permanency. He uses a chemical agent to dissolve his mucosal plug, letting all of what Steve put in his womb slough down his legs and into the drain, where dreams of children and white picket fences go to die.
“Ah, I remember you do everything yourself, except for pilot the Iron Man suit. How’s that working out for you?” As Fury side-stepped Tony’s interrogation with his bold declaration, Tony knew the other man knew his identity and maybe that he was dying. Fury knew, Tony knew he knew, and Fury knew that Tony knew that he knew. If he weren’t so tired, he’d be furious. As it is, he’s reflexively defensive.
“It’s ok. You’re not wrong.” She rubs her hand up and down Tracy’s arm. Trevor is still sitting there with his arms crossed defensively.
It explodes and he’s tossed bodily to the ground, landing in a bus stop before skidding hard on the concrete. The HUD flickers and he stands up, dizzy.
The door makes a loud thunk behind him and he looks around to make sure he’s not disturbing anyone. There are a few people in pews and he goes towards one himself to take a seat.
SHIELD is a nondescript building not far from the Tower, and he finds himself in a barren conference room, much like the one in which he examined the contract between Tony and himself.
“With the suit separate from Tony Stark, you’re looking at a military who thinks Iron Man is nothing more than property. Property that needs strict regulation.” And wasn’t that just the truth. By disavowing that he was Iron Man, publicly, his position was more tenuous. It irked to be reminded of that by an intelligence agency of all things.
“I was wondering if you can tell me anything about what the church did in the ’30s and ‘40s regarding helping omegas.”
The blanket settles over Tony’s prone form as Steve gazes down at the omega. He wants badly to carry him to his bed, but Steve doesn’t think Tony would like being touched by him. He’s surprised at how much that stings. Tony should trust him, and one thing Steve can agree on with everyone is that it’s obvious Tony does not.
“Well, we can’t always be correct, but we’re mostly certain that this particular manner of death is suicide. The way it’s written, how it was in the home, and they don’t note what caused the asphyxiation, it was probably hanging. That was common, not mentioning the cause to preserve the family’s integrity. This—this is what we work to prevent now. Things are better, but they’re not all better.” Brenna died, alone, in her house. She would have rather not lived than go one more minute with her alpha. Steve wants to be sick. Brenna gave him a little flower once. Something she had been handing out to the omega girls. He remembers taking it carefully in his hands so no one could see and taking it home.
Tony keens, the stretch and burn of it all he can focus on as it steadily presses into him, inch after inch pushing him wide open. He can feel his hips cant back, giving the other wolf room to work himself in, each aborted thrust taking him deeper. It feels better than human sex, like a high that Tony has never experienced and doesn’t want to come down from.
Steve doesn’t know what to think, and he wonders what it was he felt on Tony’s chest, but he’s not about to press his luck.
Steve doesn’t stop anyway. Tony can feel the tight ring of muscle as it fights every inch, every bit of Steve. When Steve seats himself, that last part is the most painful. It stretches him harshly and he cries out. Steve releases his hand off Tony’s mouth and moves to hold Tony’s hips as he starts his first slide back out.
“I should be dead.” Clint’s first words are rough, and the man coughs briefly. Bruce holds up a cup of water with a straw, which Clint drinks, grateful.
Steve rubs at his fatigued eyes, trying to get them to at least feel like he wants to close them and rest. His burgeoning hard-on is an uncomfortable addition to what is already a fraught bedtime routine. But at this point, he’s not going to stop himself. Whatever his mind wants to come up with has to be better than contemplating his bleak existence as a ghost in Stark’s Tower when he’s not being an Avenger. His routines have become rituals to nothing, meaningless even as they sustain his reality.
“If I did this, I wouldn’t want to remember, because it’s not me. It’s just this body, this biology. And I have a right to never have to knowingly see the person who gets me through my heat, ever.” He lies. It’s a conversation, right?
“It doesn’t matter. I still won’t knot you. You don’t deserve it.” At that Tony’s face morphs into something hurt and vulnerable. He steps away from Steve, touching the front of his chest in a way that looks like he’s reassuring himself of something. The skin around his eyes is pinched now, and his shoulders curl down over his chest.
They spend the rest of the evening tweaking sensors. At around nightfall, Tony gets the results from SHIELD’s servers. He does not like what he sees.
The fingers withdraw with a slight squelch, which under any other circumstance would have humiliated Tony, but instead the lurid sound inspired him to think about what Steve would sound like, going in and out of him at a hard, bruising pace.
It’s with that, that Tony begins to scrub Steve off of him, a ritual in preparation for removing Steve from his soul.
He releases a barrage of missiles straight into the face of the whale. It roars and makes a hairpin turn towards him while he passes by. Plus one for having some kind of intelligence. It’s not the soldiers who are guiding it then. Perhaps it’s internal. Maybe he can hit it in the hive-mind or something.
He makes a steak dinner, carefully defrosting the meat in the sink with warm water. There’s also potatoes and asparagus that he dutifully prepares. When it’s all done, he cuts the steak in half to make sure it’s cooked, medium rare, and takes Tony’s plate down to where he knows the man will be.
As he watches Tony shovel in the food, he thinks of what else he’s going to do in regards to Tony’s life. The man goes to altogether too many parties and events. That needs to change. Tony doesn’t need to be seen everywhere and anywhere. He’s an omega. His company will understand.
In a matter of weeks, Tony gets paler, slower to move. He picks at his terrible meals and generally doesn’t talk back as much. It’s been a month or so, and Steve has been working with SHIELD to take on some missions, but they have no use for him yet. So here he is, watching Tony turn into a shadow of himself. It concerns him, but it’s like the darkness before dawn, it
The initial bonding process was important. He needed to be as intimate with Tony as possible in order to stimulate Tony to produce the hormones necessary to strengthen the bond. Already he’s been too far apart from his mate in the efforts he made to explain the new normal to his teammates.
“Brenna Clarke, née Burke and Colleen Byrne, née Smith, mid to late 30s, both omegas. Not sure if they made it through the system the church had going here at the time, but they’d be in the birth, marriage, and death records. I’m just trying to see what happened to them.”
Tears leak out of his eyes, and he can feel every breath start to compound. Expand his chest, his mind, until he’s a whirring bundle of madness and need. He needs Steve. Where is Steve?
“Jesus fuck.” The air on his exposed ass is cold, but worse is the discomfort of it, the exposure and vulnerability. He has no idea what’s going on, but this has passed the range of wild animal and is treading into sentient cryptid territory. He has no idea what this
“The Avengers initiative. Something to think about, should the need ever arise. Take it home and read it over.” She abruptly closes the file and pulls it off to the side. Underneath is another file, which she also tabs open with a finger.
“So far tonight I think I’ve compromised quite a bit in your direction. Don’t you think?” Steve asks, running a hand through his hair. The ground he’s ceded is all a part of ensuring that Tony meets him in the middle, before moving towards the direction that Steve wants.
“Well you’re here aren’t you? You’re trying? That’s more than our alphas would have done,” Tracy says.
It’s not enough to slow the pace of the fight, and they each dive head-on at the other, their trajectory taking them up into the air. Tony slides the man into a mountain, breaking off bits of rubble and scraping at his own suit while Mr. Muscles struggles and punches at him as if he can’t feel a damn thing from being dragged across solid stone.
Soon enough, Fury stands in front of him, flanked by his flunkies, including Captain America, who must have slipped in out of nowhere, if that was even possible for the muscly hidebound man.
It had seemed like it, when she’d come in wearing Vera Wang and Louboutins. Almost like a date. He was supposed to have given up on his feelings, but he saw Pepper daily, and sometimes, his loneliness would get conflated with the affection he held for her. Tonight was one of those times, and Tony appreciated Pepper’s delicacy on the matter.
do you need?” Tony snapped. He didn’t shout, since that wouldn’t do him any good with an infant, but he
He would need to tell Tony that he wasn´t male underneath his clothes. That he was born female. That he was not the man Tony was hoping to date.
“Hmm.” Tony let himself be held. His head was feeling calmer already. Maybe things would turn out to be okay after all.
“The serum enhanced my metabolism. If I go for a run in the morning I have to eat half a pig afterwards.”
Considering that the only time the billionaire couldn´t find the right words was when he had a near death experience Steve started to worry about his friend and teammate. He muted the TV, crossed the arms in front of hist chest and waited for the confession of a problem Tony caused.
“A week ago you were too shy to tell me about your lack of dick. And now you want the whole world to know?” He pulled Steve into a hug. “They... they might hate you, Cap. I don´t want that for you.”
He had been to fancy restaurants before but this night was special. He was having a date at a place where there were way too many forks and knifes laying besides his plate. The soldier carefully watched Tony to prevent embarrassing himself in front of the billionaire. Not again. The evening already had been embarrassing enough.
Steve looked at himself in the mirror. Broad shoulders, strong arms, perfectly shaped pecs and his packer was hold in place in his black jeans. There was no sign of his lack of a real penis. Nobody would be able to tell. He was going to be fine.
The billionaire fell onto his knees in front of him and the sight alone made Steve´s breath hitch. He noticed that Tony was opening his belt.
“Do you want one?” Tony was looking at him waiting for an answer. He seemed to be even more excited than Captain America himself. “I can get you an appointment! You would have your very own dick within two weeks!”
“Take your time, Cap.” The billionaire opened his dark, brown, beautiful eyes and they were so full of love and affection that it made Steve shudder in a good way. “You don´t have to make that decision today. Just... tell me if you made up your mind.”
“Stay for dinner?” he asked. “Maybe we can have a glass of wine afterwards and watch a movie? There are still plenty on my list.”
Tony smiled at him before taking another bite of his own bagel. This was feeling pretty normal so far.
“I can not tell you how much I don´t want to have this conversation with you right now,” Tony replied but Steve didn´t let him of the hook that easily.
He repeated this to himself while getting dressed. He chose a white dress shirt that was just a little bit to tight with a black vest on top. Nothing too fancy but hopefully elegant enough for a date with the Tony Stark.
Well, this had sounded very differently in Tony´s imagination. He suddenly felt dumb, standing in Steve´s small hallway, looking absolutely debauched, wearing no underwear. If it hadn´t made the situation even worse, Tony might have giggled maniacally. He was an idiot. A complete idiot beyond any hope of saving.
There was a second of embarrassed silence. Tony stared at the crotch in front of him that probably looked nothing like he had expected. Only then he noticed the packer that had fallen out of Steves underwear and was laying next to his right foot on the ground.
When Tony knocked on the door Steve nearly tripped over his own feet before he managed to open the door to his room. Since they lived inside the same building Tony picking him up felt a bit weird but Tony looked so stunning Steve forgot about it almost immediately.
Tony pulled him into a kiss - their first public kiss! - and Steve couldn´t bring himself to close his eyes. His boyfriend looked so relaxed and excited about the phalloplasty at the same time. It obviously was important to Tony that Steve was happy.
“You could at least buy me dinner first,” he replied in a flirtatious tone before he practically ran out of the room.
Steve caught Tony blushing and it was probably the cutest thing he had seen in years. It was hard to make Anthony Edward Stark blush; Tony was usually confident, proud and egocentric. He always knew how to make a situation less awkward and what to say to whom. Steve had only ever met one person as charismatic as Tony – his father Howard Stark.
And just like that the doors of the elevator closed behind him, leaving Happy alone in the quiet parking lot.
“Was that a “Yes, I know what a date is” or a “Yes, I´d like to go on a date with you”? Because I´m gonna drink a whole liquor store if I make a fool out of myself again, Rogers.”
And when they later made their way downstairs for breakfast Steve couldn´t stop smiling. Of course Natasha hat to make a few snarky remarks but he didn´t care. He was in love and he was happy for the first time since he went into the ice.
It was on the news only six hours after Steve had left the clinic. The gossip was floating around the internet, new theories came up faster than Steve could catch up with them. Of course, Tony was outraged when Friday informed the two men about the news that everyone in the country probably knew by now that Steve Rogers had asked a doctor for phalloplasty.
Tony´s lips caressed Captain America´s truly impressive chest, tiny kisses and gentle nibbling. It made Steve starting to feel hot under the blankets, the smell of sex still in the air. With a sigh he closed his eyes.
Tony´s fingers grabbed his thigh, caressing him until they reached what was between his legs. When the fingertips brushed his vulva Steve couldn´t help but moan, his hips bucking up from the mattress.
“Thanks, but I´m fine.” Tony felt the anxiety rising in his chest again. He really needed to leave now. He abruptly stood up, his vision went white for just a second but he managed to stay upright. “I´m gonna go now. I really have had my fill of hospitality.”
He stabilized the billionaire as he was trying to walk. They ever so slowly made their way to the exit. It were moments like this when Happy seriously considered to quit his job. Tony was getting cum all over his suit and he could already feel the judging eyes of the lady at the dry cleaning establishment.
“Sometimes people do. Better to keep them for myself.” Tony didn´t offer another explanation. Instead, he kissed his way downwards, spending way too much time exploring Steven´s abs when Captain America just wanted this talented tongue between his legs.
The cute blush was appearing on Tony´s face again. God, Steve would never get enough of it. He kissed him gently when all what he wanted to do right now was to slam his tiny boyfriend against the wall and kiss him until they were both out of breath. He tried not to think about it too hard.
Steve looked up and Tony noticed that his own bagel was still laying half eaten on his plate. He just couldn´t look away.
“Okay, okay, that´s it for tonight,” Happy said to the men.  His tone of voice didn´t leave any room for questions. Neutral. Professional. Not at all like he was picking up his boss at a gay fetish club.
Tony didn´t trust his voice enough to answer. Instead, his body went into autopilot. He undressed, turned the shower to the hottest setting and stepped under it. The hot water made him feel better for about five seconds.
“Will you be there when I wake up?” Steve asked and his heart skipped a beat when his tiny boyfriend nodded eagerly.
It was half past ten when they made their way back to the tower. Still, Steve didn´t want the night to end just now. He was sitting in the right seat watching the lights of New York in the dark while Tony was driving.
There was this cute blush on Tony´s cheeks again. Steve couldn´t help but stare at this handsome man that always acted so tough but was so kindhearted. He placed one of his large hands at Tony´s shoulder, gently massaging him with his thumb.
Waking up next to Tony in the morning was nice. His king sized bed felt warm and comfy, Tony´s legs intertwined with his own. Still sleepy, Steve opened his eyes only to find the billionaire already awake. He was laying on his stomach, reading something on his tablet.
Even though his body hurt he felt great, endorphin rushing through his veins. It took him hours to fall asleep.
The soldier choked on his coffee and started coughing. But he still smiled when he caught his breath again.
They ate at the kitchen table; bagels, eggs with bacon, milk and freshly cut fruit while a random pop song was playing on the radio. Tony couldn´t help but awe at the amount of food Steve was eating. Of the five bagels Tony brought Steve ate four, together with about a dozen eggs and ten stripes of bacon. He washed it down with two cups of coffee and half a gallon of milk.
Tony´s heart sank into his stomach. The wave of panic was rising again in his chest. He really needed to leave now. He pushed back the chair so forcefully it fell down. He opened and closed his mouth wordlessly. Before he could even take a single step towards the exit his legs gave up. He collapsed on Captain America´s kitchen floor.
After all those years of working for Tony Stark Happy knew too well how his boss was trying to cope with his bad conscience.
“The team will show up tomorrow. I thought you maybe wanted to rest today and not have ten thousand people asking you about your dick,” he chuckled.
“I guess I´m coming a bit early,” Tony chuckled at his own dirty joke. “Don´t worry – doesn´t happen that often, I promise.”
“Tony!” Steve could hardly stop himself from pulling his lover into a kiss. He wasn´t feeling confident enough for public affection just yet.
“No. Just wanted to ask if you´d have dinner with me.” It didn´t sound just as confident as he would usually expect from Tony.
Now it was Steve who blushed. Somehow he seemed to have missed out on weeks of body language. That was probably due to the fact that the Avengers had to save the world at least three times during the last eight weeks but still. He could have noticed earlier.
Steve´s eyes wandered to the clock on the opposite wall. Half past four. It was pitch black outside.
“No! No public sex! I already told you so.” He intended to sound rigid but he had to laugh halfway through.
Just when Tony decided to retreat and drink himself to sleep to forget this embarrassing visit, Steve grabbed the bag with the bagels and made his way to the kitchen.
Opening his eyes took him an eternity. The single room they brought him after the phalloplasty was not entirely dark. The dim light was enough for Steve´s enhanced eyesight to make out a person sitting next to his bed.
That didn´t seem to stop Tony´s enthusiastic thoughts about being face-fucked by Captain America, though. He was about to describe in all details what his talented tongue was about to do to the Captain´s new dick when Steve crossed his arms in front of his chest and sighed.
“Until you decide whether or not you want a dick I´ll just have fun with the assets you already have,” Tony teased with a smirk.
They made their way into the garage where Tony picked one of the most expensive cars. As if he still had to impress Steve. Tony, charismatic as always, initiated some small talk and Steve just could not find the right moment to talk about his lack of a pair of male genitalia. He even forgot about it completely when they arrived at the place Tony had picked.
During the next five minutes Steve told Tony more about dicks than the billionaire ever wanted to know. The smaller man nodded and tried to understand what his lover was talking about, but Steve was way too excited to care.
With the help of lube Tony´s fingers slid in easily, stretching his partner carefully. Steve´s head fell back on the pillow and he relaxed his body with a sigh. His lover knew how to handle his body, working his fingers in and out until the heat in Steve´s lower body was unbearable.
Tony thought to himself that he urgently needed to design a new, better uniform for Steve when he heard a noise from the other side of the door. A quick glance to the window told him it had to be late afternoon. Could he really have slept that long?
The billionaire sighed quietly, letting his head rest against Steve´s shoulder. Steve radiated heat, his big arms closed tightly around Tony´s back. He should have felt trapped and helpless and the mercy of an artificially enhanced super soldier. But instead he felt just safe.
But the other man already pulled Steve´s pants and boxershorts down in an attempt to blow the soldier right then and there.
He shoved his tablet in Steve´s face. Captain America blinked twice and stared at the collection of dicks on the screen. Each picture had a description that said something like “9 months post-op”, “Two years post-op, patient has full sensation”.
The rush of the high Tony had felt during the session was long gone by the time he made it to the bathroom. Showering sounded exhausting right now so he just wiped down with a wet towel before collapsing on the sofa in the living room with a drink.
From somewhere far, far away he heard someone shout his name. He was lifted, his head lolling back. The world around him was blurred and somehow muted. The feeling wasn´t pleasant but it was better than being fully conscious. He thought for a second that someone was holding his hand, but it was only Steve checking his pulse.
“You may not.” Tony was already on his way to the workshop. He only recently had developed a new suit that was designed specifically to travel large distances in very short amounts of time. The challenge of arriving in NYC before Steve had finished his morning run itched beneath his skin.
“And our Bucky wouldn’t do that,” Tony agreed. “But the Winter Soldier would. And you saw how easily he was triggered.”
A smug smile creased Steve’s mouth, and he glanced away, down, and back to him again. “At least we can talk about it now.”
Steve’s gaze dropped to his back, travelling over the newly-exposed skin. “You slept… in your jeans?”
Bucky snorted and clapped his metal hand on Steve’s back as they made their way to the living room. “And here I thought I was done watching you pine for Tony Stark, but of course I ignored the possibility of time travel.”
how he felt, and they only had about half a week before freshman orientation would begin. The only thing he knew for sure was that it was a wonderfully warm feeling to be around Tony. That the cold he had experienced in their weeks of separation was something he could never have again. He desperately wanted warmth again. It was unlike anything else—more powerful than anything else.
threat to national security. Fury is trying to stop something before it even started. Based on what? He makes compromises because he is afraid of losing control. And this is the exact behavior that wills war into existence.” The tone of his own voice startled him with its conviction, his heart straining to be heard. That was a lesson learned the hard way. A lesson he would never allow himself to forget. “This is why I need to know where your loyalties are. I need to be able to trust that you’re not keeping information from me.”
Heat scorched Tony’s cheeks again, his hands curled around his shoulders in a frozen embrace. “I’m sorry about that. All of it. I don’t like my life without you. These past three months? Really sucked.”
Steve shifted uncomfortably, and if Tony wouldn’t know the man as thoroughly as he did, he’d say that he was
Pepper cast him a very pleasant smile that looked much more intimidating than any real scowl could’ve been. She nodded her agreement. “Of course, Mr. Stane. And then you asked me to become Mr. Stark’s personal assistant and what can I say, the job grew on me.”
Steve looked at him. His joyful expression, his ridiculous goatee, the scars at the edges of his field of vision, those white teeth biting his lips like he couldn't contain himself. Steve wanted all of that. He didn't want to think of anyone else having that look directed at them. He was so gone it was crazy. Tony had so easily entered Steve, not only into his body, although that was an amazing experience in and of itself, but also his presence, his attention. Steve reached up, circling Tony's neck with his arm, as his other hand moved to pull up his own leg, giving Tony better access. "Kiss me again…" he requested.
Steve tried capturing Tony’s gaze. He almost dared to ask him to just tell him about the many times he and Indries had been down here. How much could it hurt, really? Wasn’t it better to talk about it? For a moment, Tony even looked like he wanted to tell him something, but then, he just shook his head and turned around… and that moment was gone.
Tony Stark himself was covered in cum, blood and other ominous bodily fluids that Happy did not want to inspect further. His boss seemed to be unconscious, his eyes closed, his breath unevenly.
Tony smirked into the kiss that got deeper and filthier every second. The billionaire pressed himself against the taller man so Steve could feel something hard brushing his inner thigh. He was already out of breath when Tony pulled away.
It still felt weird letting another man see him naked like that. Steve spread his legs, making himself vulnerable in a way he hadn´t experienced before.
At 2:33 AM Happy entered the playroom, only to find his boss, Anthony Edward Stark himself, hanging from the ceiling, a rope around his wrists holding him up. About a dozen more or less ruffled and exhausted looking men in leather had gathered around him.
