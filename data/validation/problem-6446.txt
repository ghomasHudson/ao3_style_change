He had too much energy, too much excitement - too much happiness - to contain. He had no idea how he was going to pretend to care what Alexander Pierce had to say-
A not-especially-well-designed dart gun – almost certainly adapted from a traditional weapon. But still, he was sure.
And it was like he knew exactly what Steve was thinking. Like he could actually feel what Steve felt, just then.
” Adam carried on taunting “Except when it doesn’t suit you. Happy to take it upon yourself to stop visionaries like me, when
For a few wonderful, calm moments they just laid there together, Tony listening to the rhythm of Steve’s heartbeat, Steve carding his hands though Tony’s hair.
And Tony kept trying to tell himself that this couldn’t possibly be real. That these daydreams would clear as soon as his head did, that he’d be able to think of all those anxieties and contingencies when he wasn’t high.
“Well, if you’re going to do something stupid, at least let me know how it went,” she told him by way of a parting message, raising her hand in a casual wave goodbye as she turned to carry on along the corridor.
…Then it didn’t really matter how much of an ass Steve had just made of himself, did it? The point was that Steve might’ve just said goodbye to Tony for the very last time.
And then Tony’s eyes flitted lower very briefly, and Steve remembered the lace shirt again - for the first time all evening, he thought how ridiculous it was that he was wearing it-
A ‘perfectly harmless’ component that had caused Bucky’s arm to malfunction, and throw Tony clear across his workshop-
Steve felt a frisson of heat under his skin. A growing frustration at this circular argument, the build up of everything he wasn’t letting himself express.
And, at last, he had Steve curled up against his chest, comfortable and happy and safe, his fingers tracing idly over Tony’s skin, his heart beating strong and slow-
He found himself thinking back to the dream, so sure he’d remember it – it felt so real, and vivid, and recent…
He wasn’t sure of that, of course. There had been far too much loss and grief and trauma for Steve to be certain that he was glad of it - that the prospect of magically undoing it held
There was a stab of panic when his eyes caught on the silhouette of a man walking out of the shadows. Tony’s ribs clenched tight, an icy wave of adrenaline crashing through him…
He didn’t have to worry about what he was doing with his face, while Tony was being charming and interesting and beautiful.
“I’m sorry,” came out as barely a whisper. Tony didn’t even know if Steve had heard it, before he gasped,
“I didn’t watch much of it,” Tony explained. “Only enough to see what it was… But it’s footage of Hydra...
that if he said it again, he wouldn’t stop speaking - that he’d say everything he was thinking right now, which would probably be the worst things he could possibly say-
“And I can’t be the one to make you happy, and there’s probably not much I can do to help…” Tony just carried on, over the top of Steve’s increasingly desperate muffled yelling  “But I could probably help more, if I just got it through my head that my feelings don’t count in this, and there isn’t a compromise, and we’re not building anything. There are just those things… that maybe I even see better now, I don’t know… things I wasn’t kind enough about before, because I was still thinking like I mattered. Like there was some point in trying to prove I was your equal or as important as anyone else you cared about, or as worthy of it. And if I hadn’t been so desperate – so hopelessly,
His limbs slumped into a heavy surrender, all the tension draining out of his body as he lost his resolve. As it turned out, his unhinged level of focus had been the only thing keeping the exhaustion at bay. Now, along with everything else, Tony was forced to confront the aching back and nagging headache that he’d apparently been ignoring for hours…
“Well, you know one place that’s been a Hydra base since the early nineties,” Tony interrupted casually, not even bothering to open his eyes.
wants me to work on the Tesseract project - but, whatever he does want from me, it involves offering me a job on the Tesseract project,” Tony shrugged. “Which didn’t happen in the first timeline, right?”
for bringing that up… That petulant part of him, that had always been prepared to get his head kicked in rather than let anyone treat him like shit -
And then remembering how casually Nick Fury had strolled through Tony’s living room - how little he’d thought of that violation…
Tony looked at Sam and Bucky briefly, his sad smile breaking out into a genuine grin for the first time in hours. And then he turned back to the officer to answer, confidently,
And Tony even knew that if, somehow, by fluke, he managed to do what Rhodey or Pepper occasionally pulled off, and got Steve to say
The thought doesn’t alarm him. He realises now that there’s always someone else here… he knows it’s okay.
But Tony had pulled back immediately, simply letting two thin trails of blood run over Steve’s skin, only the faintest trace of that taste on his tongue-
of his commitments for the day - and he didn’t care. More than that, he might even have been pleased about it. It might have added a touch of harmless rebellion, or an enticing element of novelty-
He was terrified that any move he made would send the whole thing crashing down around him - and painfully aware that he couldn’t stay still.
Contrary to everyone’s awkward assumptions, Steve had picked up the actual workings of modern technology pretty well. The true purpose and modern ethics… not so much. But as a cognitively enhanced, at one time highly-trained strategist, he’d managed to master a smartphone…
Steve made it over to the desk in two large strides, the Facehugger already poised between his thumb and forefinger. He glanced at it, and thought back to what Tony had said about how it worked…
He’d waved the question aside at the time – mainly, because he’d wanted to carry on talking about how absolutely perfect Tony’s hands were… But Steve found himself pausing to think about it now.
Their eyes met. And, even though Tony had no idea what to do with his face, he found himself smiling. A sad, kind sort of smile that was somehow exactly how he felt…
Steve was still sleeping deeply in Tony’s arms by the time the sun set that evening, his body heavy and warm against Tony’s chest.
He couldn’t help feeling like this was a step backwards. Tony really thought that he’d moved beyond this overwhelmed, physical reaction to Steve. Their last few appointments had actually been enjoyable,
… A society that would’ve taught people the specific wrongs of what Obie did – a people who would have put him to death for it.
been this happy, or this in love. There is no one else in the world as beautiful and brilliant and wonderful as you for anyone else to be this happy with, right now. And I know you don’t understand how I feel about you, and I know you don’t believe it, and I wish I could tell you but there just aren’t words…” Steve carried on babbling, like he was talking to himself, as he ran one palm down over Tony’s side in a firm caress-
“But we are already sitting in an empty room, on an alien planet, is my point” Steve answered. And Tony couldn’t help a little smile, even through his discomfort.
Officially speaking, he’d never told Bucky about his hopeless crush on Tony Stark - although, of course, they both knew that he knew. But speaking it into existence was different, and Bucky understood that. He knew why Steve was so reluctant to acknowledge this, to make it real, to make it fully a part of himself…
“Look, Steve,” Tony exhaled, in a placating tone - the same pointedly calm tone of voice he’d started out with, when they were arguing about Bucky in the first timeline… “I know that this is hard for you, for all sorts of reasons. And I’m not saying I understand them all. But I can’t help you with any of that, unless you’re prepared to talk about it…”
spent the best part of a decade trying to make you laugh!” He told him, with a comedic incredulity “I actually sat there and tried to think what you found funny, what I’d seen you laugh at from other people – because you
without Tony - that the hypothetical fear of losing him in that bunker was a thing of the past. “Oh, God, I love you-”
The objective lines and numbers and patterns that represented everything he and Steve had spent so long working towards, everything they’d both wanted so much-
So he just stopped, and tugged Tony close to him again, and Tony let go of a surprised little laugh as Steve pressed him up against the nearest wall and kissed him hard. And Tony smiled against his lips, and threw his arms around him, affectionate and playful. Warm, and natural, and… his.
Tony surrendered that last line like some terrible confession, his body stiffening as though he was bracing for Steve’s reaction-
But now that he’d thought of it, the idea was going to nag. In fact, now that he’d recognised it, he seemed to be getting hungrier by the second-
He didn’t remember thinking about that at all. He didn’t remember preparing himself, or deciding he was ready…
“And, when you’ve spoken to Franciszek you just use it to send him straight to earth, right?” She clarified, carefully.
“Well… Like I say, it could’ve been a disaster,” he murmured - resting his head on Steve’s chest again purely so that he could hide his shyness. “...So, you know, the right answer would probably be to think about it
, more basically… he was just more aware of her in the moment, more aware of the individual parts of her, as all his broad social understanding faded into the background.
“....Yeah,” Sam concluded, after a moment. “But I don’t think it was actually on any water…” And then he blinked, and focused on Bucky. “Were you singing Disney songs in a garden?”
If there was any anxiety or animosity in Steve’s tone right now… well, there was a time when Tony would simply have assumed that it was aimed at him.
something, that he was prepared to fight for something, to do anything for that something… even if he hadn’t quite worked out what it was, yet.
the residual effects of whatever he’d been high on, or the feeling of coming down… or if he was genuinely just so done with all of this.
…Which meant he’d become the sort of person who looked forward to crises, because a crisis meant he got the chance to be made uncomfortable by a co-worker.
But he couldn’t tell if it felt like Steve was hurt, or lost, or nervous, or in some sort of trouble. He didn’t know whether this meant that Steve had just had a heart attack, or if he was just
And the point that won the argument was when Tony realised that at least that initial high had worn off… and he liked that.
And then, almost as suddenly as it had started, Steve had felt himself coming to a sniffling, trembling stop. His head buzzed with a strange feeling of afterglow, his body more relaxed than it had been when he first broke down… And he’d realised-
“Honestly, I’d like to pretend otherwise, but I probably would have snapped at you if you had brought him up. At least at the beginning,” Tony sighed, wincing softly before he added, “actually, I’ve always kind of wanted to apologise,
let that second issue colour the first. He had allowed his hurt to bleed into his anger. He had convinced himself that Steve’s crimes were proportionate to the pain they’d caused him, that Steve’s penance should be in some way comparable to Tony’s heartbreak – which meant he’d always felt Steve was due more punishment that someone he didn’t care about… simply
to try and keep a lid on that one. He’d been forced to accept, at least hypothetically, that he might have to skirt around the edges of it, if he was going to work out what was going on with Tony… But he could try his best to focus on the Tony part of that equation.
When the lights came back on Steve saw Adam sprawled on his back, blinking furiously against the trickle of blood flowing steadily into his eye.
And, even if Tony had been listening, Steve was suddenly very aware that he probably wouldn’t care about a political argument in another timeline, or a physical fight that would never happen now, or the actions of a team he hadn’t even met yet…
A big part of this mood was simply the thought of having someone of his own, having something go right for once, having something to look forward to-
Stay here, and risk putting a very tense Steve into contact with his very strange mood, and potentially trigger a fight… Which might just about crush him, right now.
He crept from one door to the next, listening carefully. There was the distinct murmur of quiet activity behind the first four doors; the dull rhythm of speaking, the drag and
” Tony breathed, just entirely overwhelmed, his whole body still trembling with the force of his climax, his mind completely blown by just how much this all was

“We should head back to the room first” Steve sighed, as he pulled his misshapen t-shirt down to cover the obvious tears in the seams at the top of his jeans. He saw Tony blush… and bite back a grin.
“And, more than anything, actually, I’m sorry I didn’t say I was sorry sooner. Properly, I mean. And I’m most sorry for that because… The thing is, Tony, you’re right. I do find it hard. And… maybe it isn’t quite the same for me, and maybe there are reasons I find it hard and… Hearing you say that, it just, meant so much… and you were right, it’s probably hurt me as much as anyone.
to say. That was what Steve was waiting for. It felt like that was what the whole world was waiting for.
They slipped between the bars and pushed through the door – a calculated risk. There was more chance of them being caught if they stopped to listen, than if they took the chance and went right in.
“So, yeah, he’s either going to hate that I’m a vampire, or he’s not – and the second one is worse,” Tony bit out, feeling increasingly weighed down by all of this. “So, either he’ll run a mile when he finds out, or I’ll kick him out because he didn’t – or I just have to lie to him, and then we’re not talking about anything, are we?
“You were asking for that,” Tony taunted. Steve managed a breathless laugh, his hips still tensing upwards.
to say that he wasn’t wondering how Tony’s plan fit in with his. That’s what his next questions were all about. That was
“And – assuming it’s true – it’s also weird if Vanessa Lui has just left her twenty-year-old daughter to run her company for her.” Tony went on. Steve shot him a questioning look, and Tony sighed “And, yes, I did that too – but not because my parents thought it was a good idea. My parents- died-”
...And he trusted Steve, and he liked being able to trust Steve - he liked being in an open, vulnerable relationship, much to his own surprise.
“Hm? Oh, because my other shirt got covered in pollen, and that wasn’t helping, apparently…” Steve remembered, pulling his collar away from his neck as he spoke. He’d managed to forget the lace shirt at some point in the last hour, and now it was itchy again.
…But then he’d think of himself as a sexual abuser, giving that same justification. A teacher taking advantage of a pupil, or a prison warden sleeping with an inmate. Telling himself that he’d done this reckless and harmful thing – something that Steve couldn’t possibly have the capacity or the information to consent to – because Steve

was the variable you’re using as a comparison.” And then, when Steve frowned at him, he explained further. “Okay, so you know when Dev said, with a 25% concentration in the blood, Ambience does this, and with a 50% concentration in the blood is does that…” And he waited for Steve to nod at him. “Well, I think what he

- that determined, caring, courageous man who still laughed at Tom and Jerry cartoons and remembered everyone's coffee order and who’d thought to talk to Tony about his mom…
Simply knowing that much made Tony feel better about… well, everything. It made the world seem a fundamentally more positive place, it expanded his very definition of hope and potential.  Even if that was all Tony ever got out of this… It would have made any pain worthwhile, given any life more meaning, guaranteed that he ended up in a better place than when he started.
And maybe yesterday Steve would have worried that would seem pathetic, or pushy. Maybe he’d think that again tomorrow. But, right now, there was still enough of that wonderful, calm feeling to see him through it…
“...So, these people paid you half a million dollars to upset me in front of Steve, and take a photograph of what happened?” Tony summarised. Wesley nodded. “...Who are these people?”
“Thank you,” Tony murmured, deliberately keeping his eyes lowered while they collected the others' clothing in the hope of avoiding any further conversation.
He took another step closer, firming his casual posture slightly, his tone slipping from personal conversation to personable presentation.
“Oh, uh, something about a security clearance glitch?” The clerk stammered. And before Steve could overreact, Bucky loudly intervened.
Tony took a deep breath that hurt his ribs and made his head swim. His vision darkened at the edges. His jaw felt so heavy, his lungs protested at the effort.
There was no fear, now. No secrets, no anxieties. No worst case scenario he was trying not to think about.
And then he felt that heat surge from deep inside him, that wave of pleasure that just kept breaking as his orgasm crashed over him. He screamed – something that was meant to be Tony’s name, and ended up as an almost pained,
And he knew that Tony already drank his blood, and liked his blood… but that wasn’t the same thing either.
“No, it’s fine,” Tony cut in, somewhat surprising himself and then having to rush to catch up, “I mean, whatever is going to make it easier, in the long run – if he’d rather have you here… or, if… you’d rather be here, or whatever – I don’t mind, either way.”
“Please tell me this is the first one,” Bucky commented lightly, like he was trying to make a joke of it.
fucked it up so many times by then. And I know that I always came across as judgemental or disinterested or ungrateful, but only because I was trying so hard not to come across as… to not make everything more uncomfortable and complicated, but, still, I thought you just… didn’t like me. I just thought that every time we talked it was awkward and I got it all wrong and I made you feel bad, so why would you – And, you were the only person I’d ever met who didn’t give a shit about Captain America, and what the fuck else was there? I literally didn’t even know at that point – and all I could remember about the person I was before that is that no one thought that much of him, and I, just, I didn’t-”
asking you to let me in. But there’s only so much I can do to stick with you, if you just keep walking away.”
“Bruce Banner? I gather he’s one of your party?” The officer waited for Tony to give a dazed nod before he carried on, “he’s made it through to the final of the Princess Aura Folk Dancing competition. Which is, you know, quite a big deal. Scaramouche would like to know if you’d like to attend.”
And then, once that immediate task had been completed, a little part of his brain was freed to think back to the cabinet he’d just opened…
Maybe it was just how awake he was. Maybe, until now, he’d just been too worn down and weary to properly feel exactly how furious he still felt. His blood ran hot with it now. His eyes stung. He remembered how angry he’d been when it first happened… he felt that same rage now. Anger at Steve. Anger at himself.
If Tony could just bring himself to shake Bucky’s hand, and declare the project a success, and make it clear than neither of them ever
“And I know it was important, to acknowledge everything we’ve lost, but, y’know, I think it’s just as important to acknowledge what we achieved,” Scott continued, settling into his own voice. “I mean, against all odds, we managed to fix this thing…”
And Steve was sure he’d be infuriated by this later, that he’d eventually remember all the reasons it was inappropriate and complicated and unfortunate… But in the moment, it actually made everything seem much
Steve nodded. A watery giddiness crept up along his legs as Tony led him over to the couch, until he felt unsteady on his feet. When Tony guided him to fall into the cushions Steve was relieved and ashamed in equal measure. His head was swimming…
What started as a thick mental fog had quickly sharpened into a jittery anxiety… Probably triggered by Steve saying the words ‘Truth Serum’ - but certainly enhanced by the drugs. Tony knew anxiety well enough to know the difference. His walk to the hotel had been powered by that sharp-yet-poorly-defined-nervousness that came with too much caffeine, dialled up to eleven. To the point where everything was so overwhelming and in such high definition that he couldn’t take any of it in. At one point, he’d been genuinely concerned about the risk of a heart attack.
,” Steve answered, nervously - actively fighting the temptation to squirm around this with ‘technically true’ slogans…
“So, what do you want to talk about?” Bucky offered. Steve glanced over and threw him a smile for that, although it didn’t reach his eyes.
She’d never thought to correct him when he referred to the helicarrier as their first meeting, never thought it might make a relevant addition to a personal conversation, never considered that maybe Steve would just like to know…
He was just following the usual pattern of ‘going to bed’, too preoccupied with thoughts of what would happen when they got there to consider the plan.

He should probably have left a few more minutes in between jolting awake in that armchair and bolting for the door - or, seeing as that idea was still unbearable, he could at least have paused for a few moments during his power walk along the beach, just to clear his head.
Or, sometimes, Tony would take a few minutes to appreciate how it felt to be in his own body. He’d just sit there, or stand there, and let this power flow through him, and feel the strength throbbing in his muscles and the
The beginning of a new relationship had always been an anxious time for Tony. He was usually so preoccupied with not messing things up, or second guessing whether he really wanted it, or waiting for the other person to change their mind. Even with Pepper, who he
about what they might be. How all of this might fit into the real world. What Steve was really at risk of, how Tony could make it better…
There was a familiar twinge of harmless guilt, as that heat began to seep deeper into his muscles. He knew that moments like these were painful for Steve, and often embarrassing, and obviously if Tony could’ve fixed this particular side effect for him he would have… But Tony couldn’t help being excited, right now. He couldn’t deny that he loved it when Steve lost control like this, that he liked being completely overpowered sometimes…
himself to pay attention to her, forcing himself to look directly at her with such unwavering focus that his eyes were starting to burn-
“Fair enough” Steve nodded, taking two of the drinks. They were tall glasses, filled with what looked like orange juice. Steve took a little sniff of one of them, and wrinkled his nose. Not orange juice, then.
Her mouth literally fell open at that, her eyes flashing with alarm before she turned to look at Nick.
His body was instantly flooded by the heat of it, the shock of it, the overwhelming wonder of it - everything he would have felt the first time Steve said it, if he’d not been too busy bracing for his world to end…
But there were no meetings Tony could gate-crash this afternoon - or, if there were, the exhausted SHIELD officials had decided not to tell him about them anymore. Bruce had very politely declined his offers of further assistance, and Pepper had just flat out told him to stop being weird.
They chose to shower together – mainly because, by then, they both just wanted to get into the shower.
The more he was starting to wonder if the happy relationship he was trying to picture was simply the friendship they’d had before…

He felt that the few hours they’d spent lying quietly together, trading gentle kisses and tender touches and occasional endearments,

Which was dark. Almost all of the light seemed to come from the sparkling gold fairy lights that netted the ceilings and fringed all the bars. It reminded Steve of the night clubs that Tony had been photographed in when he was younger… photographs Steve had no reason to have looked up and probably shouldn’t mention, ever…
“It was… wonderful. I think,” Tony sighed. He noted Rhodey’s truly heroic – but ultimately unsuccessful – attempt to keep his excitement from flashing up on his face. Tony made a point of carrying on before he could say anything. “At the time, at least. Because, for a start, he didn’t freak out. About the blood, or about me being a vampire, or… any of it. And that would’ve been a pretty big thing, I think. And I think that part’s just good… I mean, maybe it’d mean rethinking some stuff around the edges… but if it was just that, I don’t know if I’d have to rethink my whole approach to life. I think that would’ve just been nice, and maybe kind of better…”
“But I’m not just asking if you want to be my boyfriend. I mean, I want that too… and, honestly, I think we have to believe that can work before there can be anything more… But I also think that… this is
“Please don’t worry about it,” Galileo smiled indulgently. “We’re quite used to the initial reactions of visitors,” and then she waved toward the building,
There was a giddy surge of pure elation, as Steve felt all the things he’d never find the words for.
Which felt like the most natural thing in the world, and the most perverse thing in the world, all at once.
He looked up at the wall in front of him, where all of his holograms had been projected. He’d shut them down now, obviously - he certainly didn’t want Steve walking into all of those images just
And then Tony’s hand was on the back of his head, cradling him close, whispering to him, over and over,
The thought that maybe Howard had done something terrible in the past, that he’d betrayed Steve or gotten on the wrong side of him or had some reason to flinch from that powerful goodness in him or...something… Something like that would’ve made sense of everything.
Steve glanced down at Tony, regretfully, and saw a similar expression on Tony’s face… which then melted into a smile.

Steve’s attempts to continue begging were cutting into jagged, hiccupped cries, as wave after wave of pleasure began building up in his already sensitive muscles. There was a shock of excitement every time Steve heard the chains rattle against the headboard, adding to every second of anticipation up until this moment, and every wordless longing Steve had ever felt, and every perfect teasing pleasure up until this point-
“Really?” Sam groaned, screwing his face up in either irritation or embarrassment. Bucky felt himself smile regardless, simply because he was getting a reaction.
Steve pulled Tony hard against his chest, one arm snaking tight around his waist, the other hand going to the back of Tony’s head, guiding him up into the kiss. He could feel Tony smiling against his mouth, warm and unhurried and playful, his fingers curling into the fabric of Steve’s t-shirt. Steve was momentarily overwhelmed by the abundance of it. How good this felt. How much he loved Tony. How much of Tony he had, right now. Steve pulled his arm tighter around him, indulging in the solid strength of him, the perfect shape of him. Stroking his other hand down over Tony’s neck, and the curve of his shoulder, and the sweep of his back, and all those other little details that he loved so much about him. Tony hummed softly, parting his lips and kissing Steve deeper, pressing his whole body against him. And then Steve felt Tony move, that slightest hint of friction shocking through him, forcing him to break away and gasp for air.
...That confidence had wavered just a little, when he saw the havoc he’d created a few days earlier - and so easily remembered the feelings that had triggered it.
He resolved to ignore the intense tingling that was building under his skin, the pressure that was increasing in his hips.
And it turned out, that was as much as he needed to remember. Steve followed that basic instruction, and watched the tiny little device come alive and melt into shape, pouring itself into one of the USB ports until it filled it almost invisibly.
apologised, for that.” Steve assured, softly. Heard himself say it, really – he had no memory of thinking it, first.
“...Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea so far,” Tony smiled, eventually, a hint of something more in his tone-
not going to correct it” Tony explained, already walking over “C’mon, you’re the speed reader – you do the wordy bit, I’ll do the science bit.”
He could hear the need and desperation in Steve’s voice, he could see the way Steve’s whole body responded to him. He knew Steve wanted him. He

” And Steve saw Tony’s eyes go to the little silk-lined caddy that stood next to the bed, the one Steve had caught the barest glimpse of as he was falling. And then Steve heard the familiar, ripping sound of duct tape being pulled from a roll.
“Captain Rogers,” Nick spoke first, in a cool, professional tone. “I’m director Nick Fury, of SHIELD,” he introduced himself, extending a hand. Steve stood up to take it, making sure to squeeze just a little bit too tight. And then he looked right at Nat.
And then, when there can’t have been more than a few minutes left to go, Steve saw one of the guards move. He looked up just as she put her hand to her ear, and glanced at her partner…
. All of it was so much worse than any of the things Tony had thought to worry about at the start. Turned out, Tony had more to protect himself from - and so much more to protect - than he’d ever realised-
He could feel Steve throwing him a look from across the table, and pointedly did not turn his head. Vanessa was oblivious.
Steve simply couldn’t help himself. Every time he saw Tony he would find himself pausing or hovering or slowing down like this, like he was playing a weird game of chicken with himself. So far, he’d always managed to back away at the last moment, ducking into another corridor before Tony spotted him, or giving an awkward nod from the other side of the room and scurrying off… Never sure whether he was relieved or disappointed that he’d gotten away with it. Always telling himself that he wouldn’t put himself in that position again…
sorry Tony, I am-” Steve hiccupped again, just as soon as he was able. And Tony curled his hands more tightly around him, and whispered close,
Steve was suddenly outside of reality, beyond the context of their lives or the complexities of their relationship or the idea of consequences. This wasn’t even, ‘what would happen if Tony took a sex drug, in real life?’ – this didn’t feel like something that could happen in real life, even as it was happening. He -

“Did you tell me he was at the door?” Tony demanded, his mind already racing ahead to a thousand other things.
Steve wasn’t even sure how he’d figured it out. It felt more like remembering something that he’d known forever, something he’d simply forgotten to take into account…
...Tony got the impression that Wesley wouldn’t be making any trouble for either of them, after this.
...And then there was that other part of it. The part that felt completely alien, but still so very human-
It was the one option that soothed both his fear of losing Steve and his fear of going ahead with it – a way of walking away without it hurting too much, or a way to keep that option open in his head… He didn’t even have to work out which it was, just yet. If he told himself it wasn’t
The really enlightening part of that discovery was realising just how much he might have pinned on a basic misinterpretation – a mistranslation he’d been only too ready to accept, because it was what he’d been expecting in the first place. His initial search of the term had brought up ‘vampire hunter’ and… well, obviously. Made too much sense to question. And when he’d seen that word, again and again, it had seemed only too plausible that so many people would fear and hate him… He’d kept finding proof of his own assumption… because he’d been looking for it. Because he’d not been critical of it, or bothered to look for other explanations, or considered all the information he
that I’ve told myself a thousand times that I can’t keep trying to control things like this, and I’ve wished so many times that I could just… not do what I’m doing right now. But none of that stops me being scared, and none of that answers my question about which part of this is stupid, and…” he felt himself running out of words. Running out of energy. “And basically, I know I can’t leave Bucky in that bunker, and I just… Can’t lose you
to stand by his principles, oppose The Accords or help his friend. He was angry because Steve had been so blinded by the purity of his motivations that he’d assumed the rightness of his methods.
By then, the four of them had followed the map to a less built-up area of the city. The glistening skyscrapers had petered out into more modest venues; glass fronted boutiques and specialist theatres and sidewalk cafes. They rounded a corner, and found a huge grass-covered park, like a community sports field set in the middle of a town. It was filled with wooden stalls, some decorated with flags and banners, some covered by sparkling canopies, all of them displaying rows and rows of brightly coloured flowers…
And then Tony was on top of him, pinning him to the bed, covering him completely – grabbing mindlessly at Steve’s clothes and sucking deep, bruising kisses along his neck. Steve rocked up against him, wanting to feel that friction… wanting to feel Tony push back.
felt important, after nearly a year when nothing had been nice. Tony felt rested, genuinely healed by this reprieve from all that poisonous misery. He was glad of that.
“So, back to the room so you can conduct chemistry experiments in the sink?” Steve offered, cheerfully.
The fact that he was able to join in with this conversation - that it hadn’t even felt performative.
The green man walked out into the room first, striding confidently, his otherwise human features arranged into a showman’s grin. A young woman followed behind him, scurrying, her eyes shining with nervous excitement. She was wearing a pearl pink shift dress that shimmered when she moved, and her candy pink hair was tied up in neat pigtails… And Tony could no longer tell if her skin was a subtle shade of pastel blue, or if all the vibrant colours were playing with his perceptions. What
“And that’s what Steve would’ve thought, and that’s why he would’ve been happy to another location…” Tony realised aloud. “…Maybe he’s been there before. Maybe that’s when he got this flyer…”
That cold feeling stirred in his gut again, unsettling another random collection of childhood images - like the gritty silt that muddies a clear pool when you disturb it. Once again, Tony found his mood subtly coloured by the echoes of things he was trying not to think about.
happy we found someone who can fix it. And I know he’s not as big an ass as everyone else we’ve seen, so, you know, it’s really
Tony stood up straighter then. A loud, piercing alarm sounded in his head. His brain helpfully supplied the question,
Eventually they found four booths, in a X shape, so that each had two padded silk walls – with couches so wide, it was really more a bed with a little square cut out of one corner, for the table to slot into. The one they chose faced an empty couch, and behind that there was just the bar… which was probably as secluded as it was going to get.
He clenched his teeth against the blush that was already running up his neck, his gaze fixed on the wall directly ahead of him – avoiding Tony, standing over to his right, and the angry clattering he’d just set off, somewhere to his left.
The most confusing thing about it was the sudden sense of clarity. The way everything just seemed to make sense, when Steve was actually there.
A flood of relief that Tony was here crashed right into a wall of concern – because Tony wasn’t where he
And then he felt the dull press of Tony’s fingertip against his hole, every nerve exploding as Tony caressed possessively over his rim, and then pushed into him maybe half an inch.
Steve, in his own head.  And when Tony dismissed his – obviously ridiculous, entirely baseless – assumptions about Steve, he was just left with Steve as he found him.
“We could aim for the west side of the building,” Bucky suggested. “I don’t know if there’s another door, but there were a lot of windows, right?”
“You are so good, Steve,” Tony purred, like a lullaby, stroking his fingers through Steve’s hair. “You are perfect. Beautiful, and kind, and strong. And you deserve to be happy.”
The both sat up immediately, their laughter entirely forgotten as they focused on the short, slight figure in the shadows – and then the gap where she had been.
“Oh, we don’t want you to say anything,” the Rousseau replied, “we have the show all set up - but it’s all about
that, in the moment, he’d really believed it was the only way to save Bucky’s life – that his motives were entirely reasonable…
It began, as it always did, with that little surge of relief. A rush of light-headedness, as Steve’s ribs relaxed enough for him to take a comfortable breath.
to hold on to. He had no idea what he was expecting it to do. He had no clue what was behind his sudden inspiration that it might help – but something had to help. Because he was sliding into something truly awful with terrifying speed, and he just didn’t have time to think of anything else.
He didn’t even care that, in reality, this sudden confidence was entirely baseless – and probably as weird and frightening as everything he was running from.
In this scene, Tony decides to chain Steve to the bed, and gag him, and force Steve to listen to him say exactly why he's so angry - after which, he does ungag Steve and give him a chance to respond.
“Depends,” Tony mused - not even realising that he was no longer awkward or anxious about this topic, at least for as long as Steve was actually there. Not recognising just how much mental pressure had simply evaporated the second he heard Steve’s voice. “I mean, if I ate
experience only those effects that I so choose, now.” And he contorted his features into such a smug,
That wasn’t even one of the many injuries Steve had simply assumed he’d have to nurse, silently, for the rest of his life.
Suddenly, Tony could feel himself standing in front of a distinct line. A moment that could fundamentally tip the balance. A moment there may be no coming back from.
Steve moaned, when minutes of struggling still hadn’t gotten them to within grasping distance of shore.
Which may have remained a simple fantasy, had he and Tony never gone back to Anni Vara. If they’d just come home to Earth, with all it’s complicated realities and personal risks, this idea may have always stayed just that – an idea. Something he liked in isolation. Something he liked to think about, without ever actually wanting to
“Well, for a start, I think I have to… actually think about what happened to me. What Obie told me…”
“Well, for the first day or so, you’re unlikely to feel any effect at all, as it won’t have had time to build up in your system. After about a week, your body adapts to it, and you’re unlikely to notice the background effect at all – what’s interesting about the effect of the atmosphere is really how it interacts with other substances.”
“Now, just so you know – we don’t approve of shaming people into taking these drugs, any more than we approve of shaming people out of it.” Belle explained, walking over to them again. But she didn’t sit “So, this shouldn't be taken as an encouragement to do anything you don’t want to, or any pressure to do something you aren’t comfortable with. This is just so that you know your options, and that they’re available to you.”
“Oh, Steve, I love you, I am going to love you for the rest of your life,” Tony promised. “I will do everything in my power to keep you safe, and happy, I-”
“Yes,” Steve answered instantly, looking up at Tony again. Because he was sure of that. This was a lot to feel, and he didn’t have the words for most of it yet – but he was sure that all of it was good. “Yeah, that was… Amazing. You’re amazing, I love you…”
is that I’m just not Bucky, to you. I’m not Nat, or Sam. I’m not Wanda or Clint. I’m not someone you want to confide in, you don’t wonder what I think or care how I’m feeling or care what I think about you. And I’m not someone you hate and I’m not someone you ever
Eventually, Tony just smiled and accepted it. Unlike him though it was, he decided that there was no point in overthinking this tonight. That dazed and happy was just going to be it, for the moment.
But then his eye caught on the little glint of light at the back of the room – reflecting off of the body armour that he’d left sitting on one of the desks.
And two seconds later, he realised that the advice didn’t really apply any more, and certainly not in this situation - so, he set about doing the exact opposite of what he’d been told…
“Hi,” Tony whispered back, lifting his head. And then, simply because he’d spent half an hour that afternoon thinking of how awful it would be if he never got to say it again, he added, “I love you so much.”
Bucky – in such a way that you could’ve both died.” Tony cringed. “That was… irrational, unreasonable, dangerous behaviour – and just so you know, I
. Which, purely out of habit, probably started as an attempt to overcome this reaction. The overwhelming physicality of it, the fact that he didn’t have an actual trigger to rationalise… This was the sort of thing a person should try to talk themselves
“Definitely stop the Mallamens” Steve nodded. “I think we’re as sure as we can be that Zan was telling the truth about the slaves – and probably what her mom is planning to do to them… But we’re not sure about what the special project is?”
The sudden shiver of pleasure as Tony moved just slightly, cutting into him just a little deeper, a fresh shock of pain running through the afterglow of the first.
– but he didn’t know what tone of voice he was writing it in, so in the end he’d dropped it. Actually, he hadn’t known what tone of voice he was using for the whole damn letter, whether he was hoping Steve would feel better or worse when he read it…
tearing the Avengers apart. Not by going on a secret mission. Not by stealing a Quinn Jet. Not by harbouring a fugitive – by
Steve’s whole body flinched tense, his arm immediately locking into place in front of Tony, pushing himself in front of him as he switched into combat mode.
The pleading scream ebbed away, as Tony recognised that he didn’t need to beg - as his focus shifted to positioning himself against Steve’s hands. He pushed his weight up onto his elbows, his head still bowed.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve whispered, letting his thumb roll over Tony’s rim, his other hand gripping Tony’ s hip hard enough to bruise. “So fucking beautiful. Breath-taking. Perfect.”
Somewhere, Tony already knew there was another word for that. There must be. He could feel it so clearly, so distinct from everything else in the world… Whatever Steve was to him now, whatever bond they shared - there was a name for it. Steve was... something more than a partner or a provider or a protector… something that no one else on Earth would understand. But Tony knew it.
“…We can’t just ‘drop by’ any time we like,” Steve replied, somewhat coldly. But Bucky just frowned at him.
For Pepper to have realised that Tony’s sudden willingness to make phone calls for himself, as monumental as it was,
And then, as he was about spiral into a full on freak out, he heard a sharp intake of breath from behind him-
these words were meaningless, and wrong, and meant to upset him. He knew that he could answer every one of these points, and that Adam wouldn’t listen, and that it wouldn’t matter anyway – he didn’t care what
Tony’s spine jolted with something much like panic, stars exploding behind his eyes as he screamed into the pillows, not yet able to process this new level of urgency-
he looked, how innocently amazed and openly excited… genuine human emotions, deep and important emotions – the parts of Steve that Tony had so longed to be let into, for so long…
“Thank you,” he whispered – and Rhodey rolled his eyes at that response, which struck Tony as just perfect.
There was something exhilarating about the drama of this. Even the anxiety and the angst felt strangely compelling. Real.
Tony pulled Steve into him, his palms so much hotter against Steve’s skin now, his whole body imbued with that inhuman strength…
… And Tony was vaguely surprised that his fingers weren’t trembling when he locked the clasps shut…where all this thrumming excitement and physical elation could possibly be going, for his limbs to still be this steady-
attention,” Tony observed, casting a wry eye over Bucky’s torso - but then he finally noticed the bundle of fabric that Bucky had clenched in his hand.
not anxious and ashamed all the time, just, in general. Because when I look at my life I see more than some disaster I have to explain. Because… Well, because you,” he smiled. Steve felt his breath catch again, but at least this time it was nice. “And that’s the thing,” Tony carried on. “How we feel can change everything about how something looks. The best plan in the world can start to look dangerous, if you go into it feeling scared. You can convince yourself you’re the worst person in the world, if that’s how you felt anyway…”
His elated smile quickly pinched into a thoughtful frown, as he tried to place that feeling of connection. And then he glanced at Steve, and found a similarly thoughtful look in his face.
This incredible excess of adrenaline, that made his lungs burn and his muscles tense to the point of genuine pain. This alien feeling of having no control whatsoever over his own thoughts, the seemingly random surges of pure emotion. That unplaceable
...These were the things that should have stopped him asking for these papers in the first place. Or at least made him think more carefully about the request. Steve knew, if it hadn’t been for his single-minded determination not to think about
He already knew there was no point in asking if his fears were reasonable. He didn’t have enough information to make that assessment, or enough time to make it in-
Exhausted though he was, Tony was now sober enough to recognise every nuance in Rhodey’s voice. Tony knew exactly what level of ball-ache this clean up was shaping up to be… probably light to middling, in the grand scheme of things – but pretty damned frustrating, in the immediate.  He could tell that the team had dealt with the vast majority of issues in the few hours that they’d been here; and, naturally, Rhodey was focussing on the elements that were going to be complicated and uncooperative and awkward, further down the line.
“Why?” Tony breathed, sounding so genuinely baffled, so… overwhelmed – and Steve wanted to stop to take that in, but he
“So, now what?” Bucky asked cheerfully – and Steve was forced to swallow a sudden, bitter taste. Steve hated that question. He’d been running from that question for weeks, and fighting with that question for days, and even now that he
“You can touch, you know…” he whispered teasingly, just as he curled his hand around the length of Steve’s cock. Steve groaned, his hips snapping up into Tony’s grip as he grabbed mindlessly at his arms, greedily caressing every inch that he could reach. Tony let those simple pleasures shiver through him, his face resting in an elated grin. He kept his eyes fixed on Steve’s as he began to move his hand, indulging in the sharp edge of desperation in Steve’s expression, the heavy heat of his cock against his palm, the sensations that rolled through Tony’s back as Steve touched him…
. And I knew my Father wasn’t a bad person and I knew so much of what he was saying was true and I didn’t
“Which was back when Tony Stark was untrustworthy and short sighted, wasn’t it?” He carried on instead, his voice getting grittier as he spoke. “Look, I’m sorry if you’re offended that we don’t all suddenly share this vision of Saint Tony that you’ve just decided on right this minute, but some of us are still trying to help anyway.”
, and if it meant that he’d finally accepted this was a vampire thing, and if he was really ready to learn the details of his identity, and…
And then Tony felt a hot little spike of resistance. Another part of himself, a part that had grown increasingly annoyed as the rest of him had softened towards Steve. Another voice that whispered back,
much – he hated so many people. He felt it like a wave of heat over his skin. It had a taste. Sharp, and sour, like spoiled milk.
“Well, I think there might’ve been some useful information in there somewhere.” Tony muttered. “When my ears stop ringing, I’ll think about.”
to touch him. He spent most of his time irritably distracted, unable to concentrate over how much he wanted Steve-
“That’s okay, because I love being handed things,” Pepper announced - and, immediately, Tony’s shoulders sagged, because he knew where this was going.
– which helped prove how effective it was, because he did freely give up all this relevant information without any suggestion from the interrogators whatsoever. Including most of the details about how the truth serum was made.” Tony finished explaining. And Steve let go of another little breath.
“Ouch,” Tony agreed, with a sympathetic smile. “Fair enough, something like that warrants a clear escape plan.”
He might even have been holding his breath as he ladled out the servings into two heavy ceramic bowls.
was why he’d cried in anger at his fathers stupid putdowns, and lost so many nights sleep just thinking about his failings, and all those other things that seemed so nonsensical after they passed. But of course, it all made perfect sense when he felt like
The very fact that Steve had made the connection - the fact that he’d gone looking for it - was the symptom of a much deeper, more fundamental understanding. Something that felt like an enlightenment and a confirmation all at once.
“Oh, Tony, fuck yes, fuck-” Steve begged, his whole body already tensing in a growing need to come. Tony drew back, running his tongue over Steve’s slit again as his hand slipped away from Steve’s leg and curled around his own dick. “Please, baby, please-”
It was the way Steve reached up to touch him. The warm, easy way he wrapped his arms around him as he pressed his lips to Tony’s – the unhurried, carless way he kissed him, his lips soft and heavy and almost clumsy. It just felt so…
The hundreds of names they had in their ‘Avengers Directory’, from scientists to army generals to enhanced individuals.
him thinking his way through the next few weeks. Tony could see the worry, and the determination, and the optimism, in those subtle little changes on his face. It made Tony want to reach out to him. It filled him with a sudden urge to help, to make this better.
. Or demanded Bucky explain the difference between a general anaesthetic and being cryogenically frozen, like that nurse in Oslo – as though Bucky’s traumas weren’t valid if they couldn’t be defended objectively. At least, this time, no one had done anything to make things worse before they could even start being shit in the first place.
His first breath of that heartbreakingly familiar air was nearly enough to floor him. The nostalgia of it was so thick he could physically feel it, pumping through his veins and flooding his lungs, sliding down the back of his throat. His knees started to tremble. His vision started to fade. Involuntarily, he slid to sit in the rotten wooden bench that stood by the entrance to the graveyard - which did absolutely nothing to help, because
“Yeah, sounds like a plan…” He muttered, and then, in pure desperation, he added, “I’m sorry, I’m just suddenly really tired.”
And then the low, comfortable ache of Tony’s teeth settling into his flesh, a warmth rolling through his muscles-
Which was still an afterthought, compared to that burning desire to keep Tony’s neck bared for him like this.
The final of the folk dancing competition was being held on an outdoor stage in the centre of an enormous field, in the grassy outskirts at the edge of the city. Somehow, Tony and Rhodey had weaved their way through the tightly packed crowd and found a little space right at the front. Behind them, excited revellers waved banners and chanted their favourite’s names and jumped up and down to the beat, like the audience at a music festival. On the stage, several heavily-sequined men were throwing increasingly aggressive shapes at one another, while an intricate laser display played out behind them.
Steve was so determined to have done it, so terrified that it could all be snatched away from him at the last minute, that he could quite easily have walked up to the Ancient One and thrown the stone at her with nothing more than a ‘

enable him in something she thought was crazy. She wouldn’t trust him over what she already thought she knew, she would think of it as her place to prevent him hurting himself.
“We have no reason to think that,” Tony sighed – and then, out of nowhere, thought to add, “but it might be an idea to see who you can have standing by, while I investigate this – you’ll get a call back within the hour.”
“Well, if you know how I’m about to get myself killed, maybe,” Tony frowned at him, stepping closer.
want that system to be hooked up to any other type of system. If you were going to save your brain on a server, you wouldn’t hook that server up to the internet, would you? Or would you? I don’t even know…” Tony sighed. “So, part of me thinks that we could try New Jersey, and see if there
And he had thought, vaguely, that he’d have to make a real effort to avoid the topic, when he next saw her. That he didn’t want her to know about the… latest development, with Steve, so it was probably best to avoid talking about him at all…

Remembering the night Steve had spent curled up against his chest, soft and warm and happy, mindlessly talking through all the little elements of his life…
“That is literally what we’re here to do…?” He said, instead. Steve’s shoulders slumped in a defeated sort of a way. He sighed,

his thumb trace over Steve’s jaw, feeling a shiver along his spine as he watched the same feeling run through Steve-
“Good morning gentlemen,” Freddie greeted politely. Then he paused, waiting for Tony to join the group, exuding that illusive blend of innate seniority and dignified deference that Steve had only ever seen from TV butlers.
They’d exhausted all the mission related conversation by the time the food had arrived. After which, Steve had made a few brave little attempts at small talk, and Tony hadn’t known whether he resented Steve for bothering, or hated himself for the way he was reacting.

An unpleasant, unclean feeling crawled over his skin. A shadowy collection of ideas came together as one wave of anxiety in his head…
And he saw that same panic rise up in Steve’s eyes, that same instinct to interrupt Tony, to deny or downplay or deflect these words… Not because he didn’t like hearing them, but because he thought he wasn’t allowed. That instantly relatable feeling of tension,
It didn’t make Tony feel less like himself – it made him feel like he suddenly understood himself, immediately
“It always sounded kind of fake to me. I mean, it’s not that I don’t trust Nick – I know he’s on my side, and no one’s ever going to be able to buy him, or blackmail him or whatever. It’s just that I don’t always trust what he’s telling me? He does this thing, where he only tells you what he thinks it’s best for you to know…” And then Steve shook his head sharply, like he was telling himself off, and seemed to focus. “But my point is, I feel like I can’t take the risk. And, I dunno, that seemed like kind of a shame at the time… But I just keep thinking about it, now.”
re-evaluate his entire relationship with Steve while he was on drugs. He would not let himself forget a betrayal that huge and two years of abject misery because Steve was also kind of sweet…
of Anni Vara is a product of many interconnected components, all of which have to be understood and replicated and adapted for human biology. The Facility is very much a work in progress. And I’m proud of it, and the experience we offer here… but it’s not quite the same, as being a Varian, on this planet. The peace they have is about much more than a freedom from material concern. They are free from shame. They have a mastery over their emotions, an understanding and command of their phycology….” His affect was outright reverential now, his words increasingly aimed at the white space above their heads. “But we’ll get there. We’ll find the right mix of components, we’ll perfect the education that will have to go along with it… We’re maybe two years away from Genesis Day – less, if we continue to appeal to such interesting research subjects as yourselves….”

like a… blood bond, kind of thing?” Rhodey enquired, gently. Like he’d been waiting for Tony to mention it, so that he could ask.
“Would you believe me if I told you that I’d been on worse dates?” Steve managed to joke – whispering too, for some reason.
Well… It didn’t really matter now, seeing as the worst of… whatever it was, seemed to be passing. He still felt a little bit…
A strangely pleasant tearfulness welled up in Steve’s chest, as Tony took his hand and led him through the house.
“I also feel pretty stupid for saying that everything special about you came out of a bottle” Tony commented, lightly. And Steve laughed, softly… and then there was a considered little pause…
And this revelation just kept unfolding in Steve’s mind – clear, and coherent, and concise – as Tony continued, breathlessly,
“So, that’s what you’re going to do now?” He asked, his voice sounding like his own at last. Tony glanced up at him, his eyes flashing gold under the lights before they settled, deep and dark, on Steve. Steve felt his breath catch in his throat… but even that wasn’t
rudimentary one… It’s not capable of forming judgements or interpreting human emotive cues – but the responses are clearly aimed to learn from the user…” As he was talking, his fingers were dancing over the screen, his tone drifting away from Steve and into talking to himself…
He thought back to his mothers friends and his friends' mothers - newlyweds with young children and jobs at the hospital, who all dressed like this and wore their hair this way… They’d all seemed so grown up to him at the time. He’d never questioned that they knew who they were, that they knew what they were doing, that they knew as much about the world as any adult…
, the idea of you caring what I do, of you expecting more of me than you could a stranger.” A shade more emotion came into his tone, words came just a little quicker “I want you to trust me, and… I know I have to earn that back. I know, whatever has happened in the last few days, this can only be a start – and I swear, I will… But, what I mean is…”
“I’m so sorry” Steve croaked. He felt Tony soften against him – relieved he wasn’t dead, in the first instance.
“I did ask – apparently she usually shows up to this one.” Tony shrugged. And Steve shrugged back – well, they’d guessed that much. According to the notes on Tony’s little file reader, the second-floor parties were all actually themed by substance – and, when you knew that, you could see that alcohol was a much more coherent theme in this room than ‘Black and Gold’. As well as all the very well stocked bars, there were also several staff members circling the room with trays of shot glasses, and ornate glass bottles left on every table. And, as Maribelle was apparently The Facility’s resident expert on alcohol, it made sense that she’d be in this room, if she was anywhere.
Looking into Howard Stark’s work history, and early research, and personal relationships… all of that had to be fair game, surely? Seeing as it was
“I’m sorry you had to watch Bucky die. I’m sorry you had to make that horrible choice to crash that plane, to say goodbye to Peggy – for how frightened and sad you must have been,” Tony said softly – like he
“Zan?” Steve asked, his eyes dropping to the parcel. This was a larger, uglier envelope than the one that had been delivered last night – grey, and cheap, and bulging in the middle with something other than paper.
Tony took a minute to settle his weight back onto his feet, letting go of a purely symbolic breath. Somehow, he knew he’d only get a few minutes before his head was just a mass of panicked noise again – so, he calculated quickly.
And there was a natural instinct to assume his own sanity, a feeling that there must be a sensible answer if only he could find it…
simply indulge in the memory of Steve pushing into him… his perfect body, tense with need and sheened with sweat…
He didn’t even bother wondering if he could force himself to drink other blood. He’d learned that the very idea of it made him feel nauseous.
“Well, I assumed,” Tony answered with such casual confidence that Steve couldn’t help but laugh. And then Tony turned his attention to Steve’s still stunned companions, ignoring their baffled expressions as he explained, “I’m terribly sorry to drag the good Captain away, but unfortunately our bedtimes are now mandated by a government committee, so,” he finished with a theatrical shrug, while Steve snorted another laugh-
wrong, last night – but he knew from too much experience that it didn’t actually matter. He remembered
Steve just sobbed into his gag, frantic now – and then a little voice whispered in his head, so bitter and nasty he wasn’t sure if it was really
But there was the tingling of a smile as Tony asked it - so maybe it was, at last, beginning to sink in-
But before he could get to even that minor point of satisfaction, his eyes caught on the screen to his right.
“First bit of good news,” Tony beamed, theatrically. “It is, in fact, the first one – which is to say, this is going to sound scary, but really isn’t.”
Tony tried to think of what time he’d woken up that morning… and all he could remember was that he’d woken up in a bed still warm on Steve’s side, and the dawning realisation that everything had changed.
That it was so important to do right by other people, that he was usually so preoccupied with the question of
And Tony was almost certain that he would have to rely on it, that he already knew how this next conversation was going to pan out-
“No, Steve,” Tony smiled, warmly, reaching over to place a hand over his. “That’s not what I was saying, really. It
He followed that feeling through to the kitchen, with no real plans for what he was going to do when he got there - and then he spotted Tony standing by the sink, finishing a glass of water.
“That’s Maribelle behind the bar” Tony whispered back. And Steve looked over to see that, yes, it was.
useful listed under that heading. He turned to glare at Pepper, and found she was giving the entry a disapproving look.
Tony looked over and found Steve frowning thoughtfully, his lips pursing as he repeated the word in his head.
Tony unclasped the medical carry case and pulled one of the bags free, his whole-body thrumming with an electric intensity – a fear unlike anything he’d ever felt before. Of a completely different nature to the anxieties and nervousness and panic his human brain had experienced. This was ‘fight or flight’, already decided for the latter. A surge of pure adrenaline, immediately and entirely focused on this one obvious priority... Like the ‘fear’ that motivates a lion to furiously maul a poacher.
And the part of it that whispered to Tony in a different voice. The pervasive sense that he knew how it was supposed to work this morning, that he was
He huffed his way past the memory of Tony’s outfit, and tugged at the collar of his own t-shirt - which was at least a size too small for him, and two sizes too small for this weather.
“It would appear that the diary referenced on page 229 of the Operation Rebirth file was written by an Etienne Rossinhol, at some point in the 18th Century,” JARVIS announced, “It
Tony shoots Dr Stape, and it's made clear that the shot basically destroys the body - again, the actual anatomics are not described in detail, but there are a few general references to the damage done.
The guards didn’t spot Tony, standing right there in the centre of the corridor, for at least three seconds – not until they’d taken quite a few anxious strides towards him. And then they were clearly taken aback to find him there, visibly fumbling to raise their weapons-
Within moments, it was actually painful to maintain his pretend-relaxed posture. His eyes stung with the effort of it, his legs burning with desperation –
Tony's fears that Obie was putting blood into his food for weeks before it happened, in order to prepare him - and the fact that he still doesn't know if that happened.
Bucky, standing just beside him, one arm held in front of his face, his metal arm out to the left of him in a purely symbolic attempt to shield Steve.
you calling me?” Came out flat and fatigued – more disappointed than angry. He heard another breath, slower and more deliberate, and he could so clearly picture Steve’s face. That punctured optimism, with just a little hint of temper…
“Hey,” Tony called out to him before he’d even rounded the corner, apparently alerted by the sound of his voice. Steve found him sitting on the floor of the workshop next to an open file box, surrounded by a messy spray of papers. There were another two boxes sitting behind him, one of which was already sealed, and behind that about twenty more of them piled into a neat-ish wall. Steve smiled, harmlessly intrigued.
. Finally free from so many limitations, not swayed by rage or pain or guilt or fear, not trying to avoid anything or force anything or make anything right in his head – just thinking. Really, just… thinking.
So, Steve drank his, in the head-back, single-gulp method that Natasha had taught him, all those years ago…
Ah, yes. Tony remembered. The big meeting with the Vice President's new committee – probably entirely pointless, but not something Steve could just walk out of…
Steve had spent so many nights stewing over the injustices he’d suffered through, pointedly telling himself that no good came from spite or vengeance, that a good man only fights to make the better place - that it wouldn’t have made anything better to punish those people…
“I’m amazed you can tell the difference,” Tony muttered. He considered asking again why it was ‘Phil’, all of a sudden… he was strangely relieved to remember that it wasn’t actually any of his business.
before The Adams took over – looking at this, you’d think that the place was just always staffed by slaves… But, yeah, there’s a written agreement… wow,
Steve huffed out something that might’ve been a laugh or a sob, and just let his head fall into Tony’s hair.
Surrendering to powerful, supernatural feelings that might alter the most personal and fundamental parts of him…
mean listening to him when he said he wanted both of these things? Or being the responsible one, and saying it had to be one or the other? That Steve couldn’t be in a personal relationship with someone he was obliged to like that. That Tony couldn’t involve Steve in this dangerous, unknown world of vampirism if he was going to be anything like his boyfriend…
And then Steve curled one hand under Tony’s shoulder, and gripped Tony’s hip with the other, and started fucking into him fast, and deep, and
It was how beautiful Steve was and how much Tony had always wanted him… the rapidly dawning realisation that, no, they
The uncomfortable awareness that he liked the idea of Steve being stoned and uninhibited. The undeniable fact that, in the first instance, it struck Tony as endearing and compelling and… exciting…
his hurt feelings important, and real, had he been right to share them, to expect them to matter, to hold Steve responsible for dismissing them?
Steve felt the stirring of a different sort of discomfort, low down in his stomach. Already, he didn’t like where this was going…
you control the ventilation systems and everything, from there?” Steve asked, like he already knew the answer.
beautiful. Like a living, breathing piece of art. Tony let his eyes drift up over that glorious chest, over the smooth planes of flawless skin, the imposing physical strength of him… He looked up at Steve’s beautiful lips, flushed an even darker shade of pink, fuller and softer than Tony had ever seen them. And then at last he met Steve’s eye, and it was like he’d just stepped off of a cliff. Tony just
Tony hadn’t realised just how much he’d come to rely on his digitised textbooks and hologram displays, until several box files of dusty old medical reports had been delivered to his office. He was almost embarrassed by how quickly he became frustrated at having to manually scan for things, and how aware he was of the effort of holding things in his hands-
“But my point is, that isn’t anyone else’s fault, and I know it isn’t, so you don’t put that on other people – I was raised on that, and most of the time I tried to stick with that, but then New York happened, and I met you, and… I don’t know. I was angry when I talked to you, which isn’t the same as you making me angry. And instead of pretending I wasn’t, I just… I don’t know, I don’t remember over thinking all that much when New York was happening, maybe I did… But I feel like that
“...And the first time around I didn’t tell you any of that,” Steve heard himself speak, not sure if Tony could even hear him, not sure if it was right to continue with the story - not sure what else to do. “Because I thought it would hurt you so much to hear it-”
There was a flash of blinding panic in Steve’s head, bright enough to blot out his most basic senses.
…So, really, that narrowed it all down to keep biting Steve, continue taking bagged blood from Steve… or die.
change Tony’s opinion of whether this thing could work. That’s the bit where it mattered, knowing how Steve felt about him.
Steve felt a little curling of guilt, low in his gut. He thought back to the night before, to Bucky saying that his arm felt entirely different since that final procedure. The little hint of excitement as he tried to explain what he meant, the way he’d flexed his fingers as he tried to find the words. In the end, he’d settled for ‘normal’.
And, in hindsight, it would be obvious that Sam was only asking him to think about his feelings. Pointing out - quite correctly - that his pain wasn’t down to anything Wanda had said or done. Giving him the opportunity to really lose his temper and rant about his actual issues, if he wanted-
emergency shut down, and he can’t get access to any of my records. And I think he was in the middle of doing something with it, and that might actually be bad right now…” he trailed off with an embarrassed shrug.
Well, he knew that - for no apparent reason - he was deeply and personally irritated by that statement. But he’d intended to let it go. He’d expected to just let it go.
it to Steve to like him in the first place. He wasn’t obliged to form any sort of bond with Steve, he didn’t have to give a reason to take it back. And it was perfectly valid for Tony to be more
“Working late?” A familiar voice asked, cheerfully. Steve glanced over his shoulder to see Clint resting nonchalantly against a stair-rail, pretending not to look at Steve’s screen.
“And the thing is… I can’t explain this – I can almost see this guy losing his mind. Or, I don’t know – disappearing into it? These notes, they start off much more coherent… and then it’s like he, I don’t know, starts skipping out the joining bits… and then starts just, dropping in things in that he’s not mentioned before – and the tone of these little memos get’s more and more, I don’t know, desperate?” Tony sighed, struggling to describe the feeling he was getting from all of this.
For a second, Tony was too busy thinking that Steve was adorable to recognise what he was saying. And then it hit him.
And he only wanted it more when he heard Steve groan softly, his fingertips digging harder into Tony’s skin.
And thinking that brought him back into the real world a little bit – at least enough to process the fact that there was apparently someone else in their room. That sounded like something that required attention.
Steve sighed, and brought Tony’s hand to his chest, resting it over his heart. Tony could feel the rhythm of it beating against his palm.
“We have a grand banquet planned for every night of the festival, over a hundred different parties and theatrical performances, sporting showcases from the greatest athletes in the galaxies,” Rousseau Number One went on, like he was listing things as they came to him, “all culminating in the Gala Ball on the final night.”
gas, descending from the ceiling of each cell. And then, one by one, the people inside seemed to drift back to their senses… And smile, calmly. Andrew stopped tapping his foot, and slumped his shoulders, like he was relieved… A woman in the cell above him stretched, casually, like she’d just woken up from a nap…
And, as the bartender turned to make whatever drinks Steve had ordered for them, Tony dared to let his hand slip away from Steve’s… over his wrist, his forearms… up over the smooth expanse of skin, the line of solid muscle… The whole time almost holding his breath, trying to control the butterflies in his stomach. And then he felt the slightest flicker of tension run up through Steve’s shoulder-
“Okay…” Tony muttered, his eyes dropping and drifting into the middle distance, the way they always did when he disappeared into thought for a second. Steve took the opportunity to grin briefly, as though he could really get it out of his system like that. He flexed his hands at his sides, dispersing what he could of this elated energy, pointedly reminding himself of his plan as a way to focus,
By the time the sun appeared over the ocean, Steve was at least starting to feel like he’d found his true thoughts under all the noise.
That heat coiled more sharply. His lips curled into a darker smile as his cock stirred… But he decided to leave those ideas until he could really indulge in them - maybe even until he could share them with Steve.
held Steve to a different standard to everyone else in his life – even while he was mad at Steve for doing that to him. That he’d come to think of Steve as unfathomable, unpredictable, outside the realms of analysis and understanding… because of all those questions,
Steve had started this endless night with the same panicked noise in his head as Tony, at the mercy of a similar mix of emotions. And, like Tony, Steve had dealt with it by reverting to form, immediately falling back on the coping mechanisms and personal habits that had been there since
Steve let his head fall into his hands. He was sure all of this felt much simpler at the time. He was pretty sure it actually felt… nice, at the time.
“Oh, hey,” Bucky greeted him, in that rushed tone of someone just on their way out the door. “I was going to call you-”
Right now, he simply had a sense that things weren’t coming to him quite as clearly or resolutely as they sometimes did… But there was still something there. Something he could lean into.
more scared of these people than you are of us?” Wesley looked up then, a more immediate flash of panic in his eyes as he glanced between Steve and Tony.
a bed, like, a mile up the beach…” he cast a glance at the window, huffing petulantly as he visualised the journey. And then let his head fall back, and closed his eyes again. “...Just give me a minute…”
“Yeah,” Tony grinned, leaning into him. “But… Seeing as you can only be here for a few more hours… Maybe we should leave the talking, for now…” And he glanced up to watch Steve’s eyes widen, before he dropped his head and took Tony’s mouth again-
And then he felt Tony’s lips press oh-so-tenderly to his hip again, kissing the wound, then running his tongue very slowly over the cut.
I mean, are we done with the angst, before the happy ending? Are they done torturing each other in this fic?
“Okay, well, like this,” he said, plucking a stalk from one of the pots in front of him. He held it up for Steve to examine. It looked like a little sprig of wheat, but with pastel pink petals where the kernels would be. “We call this a JimMiami - this can make you see the theatrical stage show in the mundane world around you, the things you wouldn’t normally perceive to be there.”
But he could feel Tony moving closer. Steve scrabbled to shift his mind out of daydream-mode, as all of his muscled tensed in preparation for something… for
“Of course it does,” Steve cut in, so sincere that it gave Tony pause. “...Look, I know you don’t know me, and maybe it’s no comfort hearing any of this from someone you don’t know - but you know that
So, maybe it would’ve been better to have just walked away. To have never asked Steve if he knew. For Tony to have lived his entire life with the horrible worry that maybe Steve had lied to him, rather than being hit with the certainty that he had…
on pursuing a plan to stop me. I suppose I could, if you were insistent on reporting it back… But, I suspect you won’t be. Not once you’ve forgotten there was anything objectionable about the place. Because you’ve forgotten what your objections were.”

“We’re stranded on an alien planet where the air is drugging us, with no real idea what the fuck we’re here for, and no control over what the fuck we’re doing,” he huffed, indignantly. And then the stubborn expression folded into a sullen grimace, before he fell into the seat behind him, and covered his face with his hands. “Oh… He hates me,” he groaned.
“...That’s why?” Steve questioned softly, sounding somehow fragile. Tony snapped up to look at him again. “...You… felt something, like that?” Steve clarified-
, at the time. At the time, Tony was simply pleased that Steve felt comfortable enough to talk about it, and maybe intrigued about Steve’s sexual history – amused by some of the anecdotes, without further consideration. He might even have been a little bit smug, when Steve told him about the
Once again, my apologies that this update comes so late on a Monday - on this occasion, it is because it was my birthday last week (along with Cap 😊) and my family managed to turn a small afternoon get together into four days worth of drama... Although I am happy to say that it did all come off well eventually, and also that I'm FINALLY back on schedule with everything 😊
Really, he would’ve liked to get annoyed at Steve right now. He could’ve gone into quite a satisfying little rant about how thoughtless it was for Steve to leave him bunched up in that chair for six fucking hours-
All resistance, all pressure, all pain. All that frustration and longing and disappointment… just gone.
that Varian society saw nothing inappropriate in public displays of affection. He knew that there were other couples at the party displaying rather more affection already… logically, this was the exact reaction he was expecting.
Which would have been a truly tragic thought, if it weren’t for how blissfully happy Steve was right now.
“No” Tony remembered, suddenly. “No, uh, we’re supposed to stay here… we’re… I think we’re supposed to be downstairs…”
felt like a little static shock, every time he said it. And every time he saw Tony smile when he said it. And every time Tony said,
“Yeah, of course,” Rhodey replied, already unfastening his seatbelt. And then he paused, and turned to look at Tony again. “I mean, are you sure you’re up for this right now? It’s not like we’re going anywhere.”
He was desperate to tell Tony to go and drink, to take better care of himself… But he felt sure that would upset Tony, and anyway, he didn’t know the first thing about this, to be giving advice.
when he recognised that he was tidying a room he hadn’t even been in for a year. And then he’d realised that he still had three whole hours to kill until Steve arrived – and regretted putting his work away so soon. And then he’d decided that he should probably think about what he was going to wear…
“Um-hm, so why have you got that puppy-caught-in-the-pantry look on your face?” Tony teased. And Steve blushed. And smiled, self-consciously, and dropped his eyes… “This must be the weirdest beer fear ever, huh?” Tony mused, his tone light and interested. Steve glanced up at him again.
, when he stepped away from that panel, that he had to focus on those two immediate priorities. That, even though there were a thousand important things that he
“Don’t sugar coat it Nat, say what you think,” he mocked, avoiding eye contact with the woman out of second-hand embarrassment. Nat shrugged.
…Climbing into Steve’s lap at the Christmas party last year, armed with a sprig of plastic mistletoe and a cheesy joke, and being pleasantly surprised that Steve actually kissed him… and kept kissing him…
Steve threw his head back and screamed, one hand balling the bedsheets into a fist, the other frantically grabbing the back of Tony’s head.
changed, by that second kiss. Maybe that adorable, dazed joy had worn off, or his personal revelations had settled in by then-
And, okay, Tony knew that Steve was the only reason he’d been there in the first place. That he’d basically forgotten Bucky even existed, for large parts of the day – which was one of the things Tony planned to feel bad for, when he got around to it.
And, more importantly, Tony didn’t have the time or the mental capacity to consider the decision too deeply.
didn’t really clarify anything; other than the fact that he’d really liked it. And that’s the bit he wasn’t confused about.
going to find out what this ‘special project’ is, and get these people off of your planet – here, hold this” He told her, taking a USB stick out of his pocket and placing it in her hand.
And then the specific memory of Tony teasing him about his PSAs - the playful smile that Tony could barely contain, as he leant his weight on Steve’s desk and mimicked,
Steve felt his stomach turn over again, that same instinct to claw his own skin off out of sheer embarrassment. He didn’t even know what he’d done… But, Jesus, what if it
He huffed as he recognised the final sentence, and the weary confusion that came with it. He’d run his eyes over these words so many times that the shape of them was intimately familiar - and he still didn’t have a clue what they said.
He followed that instinct, letting the tip of his tongue trace over the line of Tony’s shoulder blade, biting hard enough to leave a dull indentation in his skin. Tony keened, his breathing growing sharper and sharper, until it fell in time with the frenetic rocking of his hips-
about you is perfect,” Tony carried on, seemingly unmoved by Steve’s increasingly frantic whimpering. “Every inch of this beautiful, strong body, the way you move, the sounds you make… I can’t believe I’m allowed to just touch you like this…”
“I haven’t had that one yet,” he smiled, gratefully. And then it cooled just a little, before he added, “I got asked whether I thought the Avengers should be on social media…”
“It’s not, actually,” Tony corrected, carefully watching Wesley’s facial expressions. “You started out as a legitimate photojournalist in DC. Then you slid into selling compromising pictures of politicos to the tabloids. But you’ve never been a celebrity pap.”
Steve leant up into it, one hand coming to the side of Tony’s face, his lips hungry and forceful against Tony’s soft, warm kisses. Tony pressed a firm hand to his shoulder, encouraging him to lie back rather than pushing him. He could feel the trembling restraint in Steve’s back, the way he fought to follow Tony’s instructions against an obvious instinct to grab him with both hands. Tony smiled against Steve’s lips as he ran his palm over his chest, letting his fingertips trace over the line of his muscles, delighting in the co-ordinated shivers he felt from Steve. Tony leant back just enough to watch Steve’s face as he stroked a rough hand over the outline of Steve’s cock, pressed hard and wet to the fabric of his underwear. He watched Steve’s eyes widen, the way he pinched his lips as though he was trying not to bite them, the little flutter of a breath caught in his throat.
He glanced at Steve again, and saw Steve thinking the same thing he was – they’d got what they came for. They knew
In a fit of pique, Steve threw the covers aside and sat himself up, shuffling to the edge of the bed before he asked himself where he was going.
Steve smiled, in spite of himself – but only briefly. That’s how it worked, these days. Even the things about Tony that made him smile made him sad. He thought back to that short period in his life, when he might’ve been able to tease Tony for that. When Tony would’ve teased him back, for being awkward and embarrassed and flustered – but without malice. With a certain sort of affection, sometimes… those few warm moments that had filled him with so much hope –
. Sometimes you could be so different. There was this whole other side to you I couldn’t work out… And I’ve just realised, it’s not a whole other side to you at all.” And he paused, and looked right at Steve, those beautiful dark eyes so wide and full of feeling “It’s just
“…But I could inquire as to prices, in a few days. See if the management confirm that crazy-ass business model.” Tony muttered.
“Woah, sorry,” Steve cut in, speaking on auto pilot. Aware that Tony had moved onto an entirely separate and very serious topic – while Steve was still very much stuck on ‘I love you.’
And then he felt Tony’s hand caress over his ribs, and up over his chest – finally coming to a confident stop, firm against his skin, right over his heart.
Just hearing Adam say that… Steve understood that he’d never want to forget anything that had happened between him and Tony. Not the confusing bits, not the painful bits, not the embarrassing bits – none of it. He wasn’t sure whether that was the same as wishing it’d never happened… But, what
Tony waved the holograms closed out of habit, already shifting his weight to sprint out of the workshop again-
Steve, pulling Tony into a bruising kiss the second the Jet landed in New York, his arms braced hard against Tony’s back…
Steve respond; digging his fingertips hard into Tony’s muscles and taking him right to the back of his throat,
really like him, I just think I do, because I’m attracted to him. Possibly very attracted to him. Which I shouldn’t be. And wouldn’t be, if I weren’t a recluse, and a total clusterfuck of a person.”
Then, he took the marker pen - designed by Tony Stark himself to be permanent on any surface - and wrote in clear, block capitals along the sleeve of Other Steve’s uniform-
Tony snorted a laugh that ran on into a string of giggles. Because he’d forgotten he was wearing the toga. Because he’d been standing with Rhodey for at least ten minutes, and this was the first time anyone had mentioned the toga. Because he’d just remembered how he ended up wearing a toga-
Immediately, his hand was wrapped around one of the little sachets in his pocket. He remembered there was a reason he’d been reluctant to take this… but he had no hope of remembering what it was. And he’d used all of his cognitive capacity having this idea in the first place. He wasn’t able to analyse it.
Pepper and Rhodey burst into shocked giggles, Rhodey spluttering into the waterglass he’d had pressed to his lips. Tony looked at Nat incredulously.
he had any concerns about Tony picking Clint, they were purely practical – that it was only because he thought he had more chance of keeping Tony safe than Clint did…
And there was also a smug smile, which might have been for Steve’s benefit, or might simply have been because Steve was there.
Tony dropped Steve’s wrist, his other hand caressing lower, down to the curve of Steve’s waist. He watched Steve’s throat tense as he swallowed, hard, his eyes dropping to focus on Tony’s mouth. His fingers curled tighter into Tony’s hair, sending a sudden static shiver down the back of his neck. And then Steve moved his other hand, bringing it up to the side of Tony’s face-
Then came the wave of friendly memories and heartfelt regrets, none of which he’d built a defence for yet, and then a twist of confused sadness, like trying remember a bad dream-
In terms of managing expectations here - there is no porn in this update. This is all hardcore emotional analysis and communication-
It had to be a question about the two of them. Him and Pepper. Whether he was happy in this relationship, whether he really wanted the future it was leading to…
Some primal part of him recognised that he was on a bed, that Tony was climbing onto it with him, that this warranted a flush of heat over his skin and an immediate hardening of every muscle.
And now here he was, standing in one of the many gardens of the Varian Embassy, watching Tony effortlessly charm an audience of alien diplomats… Feeling
It was all still there, just as sharp and just as awful… but not moving so quickly, somehow. His heart was still racing and there were still tears sliding down his face, and there was still that bitter, metallic taste of fear… but the frantic thoughts had quieted, just for a moment.
Tony smile before he could open his eyes. His fingers were still curling into the fabric of Tony’s shirt, his breath still coming in ragged, noisy gulps, when his vision finally cleared. The first thing his saw was Tony’s mouth, dark red and slightly swollen and…amused.
. He bucked his hips, a desperate scream trapped in his lungs as Steve began to move against him, taking him deep and slow, like he was savouring every inch. Tony tugged at Steve’s hair again, and this time Steve responded by sucking sharply at the tip of his cock, digging his nails into the tender flesh at the curve of his waist.
He could feel Bucky and Sam having a silent conversation over the top of his head. He wondered if there was any chance that they were high enough to forget all of this by the morning… But he doubted it. It didn’t seem like that sort of inebriation.
“Hey, while we’re waiting, and since everyone’s here, why don’t we have a toast?” Scott suggested, somewhere between earnest and hysterical now. Bruce and Thor took their glasses too enthusiastically, Clint and Sam took theirs dutifully, while Rhodey and Bucky moved robotically-
have… Well, that, or accepted that he just wasn’t up to it, and not good enough for Tony, and not deserving of the effort-
going to be hurt when he learned the truth about his parents, however carefully Steve broke the news.
this was all for the greater good. Maybe he’d part convinced himself that he really was the hero of this story… But Steve could see that, just below the surface, Stape knew full well he was in this for selfish reasons.
” Tony hissed - fighting the strangest urge to laugh. “Okay, look, we don’t need to distract them for long. We’ve just got to get them away from the back door for long enough to get through it.”
“Well, I, uh, I know how to take my own blood, and there was an empty Med Lab, so, I figured, you know, I’d take the chance while I had it…” Steve over explained. And somehow Tony found himself smiling.
… All with that slightly sinister filter over everything. That ominous music playing faintly in the background of Tony’s memories. Those blink-and-you’ll miss it scene-shifts that only he could see…
The others were already waiting for them, seated around a long wooden picnic table. Clint was at one end of it, sitting in a canvas deckchair, keeping his eye on the BBQ - Steve was faintly relieved to see that Laura and the kids had decided to sit this one out. Wanda, Thor and Scott were on one of the benches, Bruce, Rhodey and Bucky on the other, none of them looking especially comfortable.
“Well, it worked, if that helps,” Bucky mumbled - and then kicked himself, and made a note to leave the talking to Sam.
It went against every direct teaching and unconscious assumption about what it was to be a hero or a man or head of the Rogers household. All those lifelong pressures, those inherent burdens, all the rules about never showing weakness and never whining about his problems. That seemingly endless parade of 1940s American Role Models instructing him to put on a brave face and put the suffering of others first and to never let the bastards grind you down…
means, I could connect a tracker from there…” Tony produced a tiny little device from his pocket with a flourish. He could see Steve squinting to look at it. “
“Look, Bucky… It really isn’t as simple as that,” he sighed, dropping his shoulders. “I mean… my life isn’t exactly something another person could… fit into…”
“...But there is other stuff,” Steve went on, timidly. It was the nervous tone that snagged Tony’s attention.
And he let his hand slide over to take Steve’s, a happy little dip in his stomach as he felt Steve squeeze it.
Tony let go of a heavy, trembling breath, a pleasant tearfulness flushing his face as he tried to decide which part of that to swoon over first.
be for each other in human terms. How much better his life might be with just some of that support, and understanding, and genuine affection for something… To recognise that part of the draw he felt to Steve, or the light-headedness he felt around him, had nothing to do with being a vampire. That part of the calm and confidence Tony was feeling, in spite of this enormous event, was simply because
“That’s it sweetheart, like that, that’s good” Tony purred, completely still except for the firm caress of his fingertips on Steve’s hips.
Suspended for however long somewhere between consciousness and not, entirely at the mercy of the intense chaos of feeling that he’d fallen into.
Tony talked about Steve sometimes… It made Tony feel like a part of Steve. It made Tony feel more like home…
He thought of all the reasons he’d longed to hear Steve say that, all the things he always thought it meant - getting married and having kids and growing old together…
right. It came completely naturally, in a way that Steve hadn’t felt since he’d been thrown into an alien future-
Maybe it was only that reading paperwork seemed more manageable than trying to deal with his own thoughts. At least he could push through that. He could
Steve felt it closing in on him. The fluttering feeling rising higher in his chest. The increased awareness of his own skin. The fluidity of his thoughts, the way his observations and interpretations and daydreams ran away from him – which seemed entirely inappropriate, under the circumstances… But so natural. So hard to fight.
Steve had no idea who he was anymore. He didn’t know what he liked, what he thought was important… What he’d choose to do in his spare time, even.
That, right now at least, he really wasn’t hurt. All those sharp and heavy emotions that had burdened his every movement since last April, just… gone. The relief was dizzying. He literally felt his shoulders loosen, the constant, dull ache in his back finally easing…
they would, because he’d studied this moment so carefully. Across multiple timelines. He’d watched the security footage of his own recovery before he left 2023, and read every report that anyone had ever written about it. He’d even used one of his remaining Pym Particles to watch the whole thing play out, before he finally came to settle in 2011.
“Seriously Steve,” And he leant forward, to emphasise his point. “You don’t have to come with me, if you don’t want. But if you don’t give me a solid reason not to, I
thing he’d warned himself against at the start. The one thing he should have been safeguarding against this whole time – the reason he shouldn’t have said yes in the first place-
“What?” Steve asked, still dazed. Tony lifted his head, resting his forehead against Steve’s. Steve could feel the heat of his breath as he spoke,
actually get to like me for a bit in the middle there, because actually he likes me fine when I’m not being an asshole to him - but then I just couldn’t help being an asshole again, and screwed the whole thing up. And I
how they should react, if you change the background variables by those percentages… I don’t actually think they’re making that bit up. I’m saying, the only way they could
, I can only assume is deliberate, seeing it’s all easy enough to check. Just like someone was obviously put in charge of
Tony felt a queasy little turning in his stomach that he wasn’t sure he liked. The distinct feeling that he was experiencing two reactions that couldn’t happen together. Somehow, he’d managed to half talk himself out of liking Steve. He’d reminded himself of all the hurt Steve had caused him, and still there was this deep, empty longing… His body didn’t know whether to melt at how soft Steve’s lips were or harden at the memory of Steve
” Tony groaned, looking up at the ceiling. “But this is as stupid an idea as it’s ever been, for all the same reasons it always was-”
He and Tony looked up in unison, the same confused frown on their face… melting into the same amused grin, when they saw that Bucky was now soaking wet, and fixing Peter with an outraged stare.
Tony, losing Bucky, losing anyone… But he knew better than to force the issue. The point was that all his ‘biggest fears’, the things that had lurked just under the surface, the things that had leapt up to answer this call… weren’t there anymore. And without that default file to rely on, and without the time to go searching for something else… His brain just blanked on that whole ‘fear’ thing.
. That he’d babbled, and ended up in an agonising and protracted discussion about the nature of blood donation, and whether he trusted Nick-
“...No,” Steve realised aloud. “I guess… I don’t know, maybe I didn’t want to tread on your toes, or something?” He narrowed his eyes, not entirely sure himself what he was trying to say…
“Yeah,” Steve breathed through a laugh. “Of course - otherwise he’d have asked you to find out, now wouldn’t he?”
“...They didn’t, in the end,” Wesley huffed, sounding bitter about it. “Well, I never got the pictures, did I?”
about it all… which I think is a whole other thing… And I think there are parts I do feel bad for… Even though, honestly, I’m still pleased it turned out like this. I mean, if I’m really honest – if you offered me the chance the go back and change something,
Wondering if JARVIS would’ve told Tony when he arrived… If Tony was inside, wondering why Steve was being weird and rude and just staying in the car…
“Yeah, definitely,” Bucky nodded. “There was definitely a second when I realised my arm wasn’t moving,
Another howl of laughter broke out from the other end of the table, and Steve didn’t bother to hide his sullen pout.
“If you want to know what I’m thinking, mainly I’m just thinking that I want to kiss you again,” Steve told him, firmly. “I have wanted to kiss you since the first moment I met you. I have thought about you – I have thought about
That exhilarated fizzing broke out over his skin - burning hotter and sharper now, and not only because he was that much closer to home…
“But you… you think you will see him again, is what I mean?” Steve cut in, leaning forward slightly.
Steve threw his arms around him immediately, one across his shoulders, one tight around his waist, pulling Tony hard against him. Tony relaxed into it, opening his mouth, one hand caressing up along Steve’s neck and into his hair. Steve gripped him tighter, rocking against him, a sharp heat shooting through his hips as Tony moved to meet him, his other hand grabbing roughly at Steve’s shoulder. Steve felt Tony moan softly against his lips, clawing the fabric of Steve’s t-shirt into a fist, kissing him increasingly desperately.
Steve’s eyes widened, and he nodded, small but determined. And, God, Tony nearly kissed him again then, just for that –
Tony threw the weapons down and pushed the two front guards aside, a flat palm to the centre of each of their chests, brushing them up against the wall as though they were cardboard standees.
“Captain Rogers,” a smooth, professional voice snapped him out of his daydreams. Steve looked up to see Alexander Pierce strolling across the lobby towards him, hand already extended. Steve made sure to leap from his seat in time to take it.
But – and wasn’t this darkly comic – he’d actually thought that maybe this might be a chance to talk to Tony.
, it is objectively true that Fury would’ve done as much damage to humanity, as the project manager who delivered a Tesseract Weapon to Hydra.
“…Could we find reference to something she shouldn’t know?” Steve asked, an interested edge on his voice now.
thought that finding someone who would agree to have him – as unlikely as that seemed – was actually a pathetic and selfish ambition. That was the foundation for all of his guilt and apprehension. The underlying assumption that Steve – that
rewrote medical science, built a robot suit out of scraps, and escaped...” and then he pressed his fingertips just a bit harder, right at the line where the scar frayed into smooth skin.
Tony never imagined he’d have to critically evaluate that particular coping mechanism. He’d never asked himself whether it was fair, or what it represented, because it had seemed like nobody’s business but his - what could it possibly matter, if Tony had been a bit hard on one dead man purely to spite another…
Should he tell Tony just how much he wanted this, could he reasonably put that extra pressure on him?
still 2019, that that would be the calendar they were using, would it matter? Was that interpretation even
“Oh, right, yeah.” Steve nodded – and then, because he vaguely remembered that it was what he was supposed to be doing, he drained his glass. And he went to put it down on the table behind him, readying himself to follow Tony to… wherever it was he’d just said they were going-
. Steve just followed his commands, like he could hear Tony thinking… As quickly as that, Steve didn’t have to think for himself at all. He didn’t wonder why, he didn’t ask himself what happened next. He just let Tony undress him, obligingly shrugging his way out of his T-Shirt and stepping free of his jeans, blissfully free of all control.
There was still something otherworldly about the freedom of flying. At times, it was like being free from the boundaries of reality, feeling so at ease with the sort of speed and movement that should’ve been impossible.
Their first appointment was scheduled for a few nights later, on what turned out to be a pretty dismal Monday evening. By the time Steve and Bucky arrived the rain was running down the lab windows in sheets, and the room was filled with a vaguely comforting drumming sound.
But, now that Tony had some real work to focus on, everything was a little bit easier. He could direct events more confidently, now that this was a scientific procedure rather than a social interaction. He knew in advance that he could always fill an awkward silence with a bit of technical detail. He could think ahead to the next question, the next task, the next checkpoint.
remember your office phone number” Steve carried on with his line of thought anyway “And, anyway, you
Before Tony could say it back, Steve was pushing his shirt up over his head, his hands caressing over Tony’s ribs as he moved.
“Um, okay…” he muttered to himself, aware that he had to be a little bit polite about getting rid of Pepper, but having literally
The strangest sort of focus had gripped Tony, in the moments afterwards. He’d been so overwhelmed by elation and adrenaline, and the world had seemed so vivid and magical and
. And how could he tell Tony what he was feeling when he didn’t even know? How could he explain, when every part of himself was screaming something different, and he didn’t know which were real and which were things he’d just
Tony pressed himself up onto his arms, so that he could look Steve right in the eye when he carried on,
“Well, in complete fairness to the old guy, that is literally what happened when you met me, almost scene for scene. Not all of his predictions were accurate, or even coherent, but I think we have to give him that one.”
In the last four days, Steve had found himself remembering a pretty independent minded kid back the thirties and forties. Someone who used to think about
Tony’s movements weren’t quite as controlled as he ran his tongue over the wound, healing it. He pushed his fingers into Steve shaper and shallower, an illicit thrill running up his spine as he felt the trickle of Steve’s blood running over his hand – as he pushed Steve’s own blood into him.
rebrand this whole thing as something he’d had no control over, something that didn’t say anything about who he
For a moment, he wasn’t sure it was even there, or if his own guilt was manifesting in hallucinations - both seemed equally unlikely. And equally terrifying.
It was how much Tony loved him, and what Tony could do to show him… the incomprehensible idea that Steve loved him back…
“And it’s not a big deal, is it?” Steve asserted. “You can just say that, and it’s not a big deal, because obviously you think she’s beautiful, because she is beautiful, and no one would even blink if you said it. But if I’d ever said it about you, it would have been
And then he must’ve reached that middle ground. The point between emotional elation and rational thought… an aware sort of dream-state, or a still-hazy wakefulness…
“Come here,” he smiled instead, reaching out to pull Tony into his arms. He was weightless, in the water, his skin slippery against Steve’s…
And he couldn’t see how saying that he’d simply been selfish and callous and not thought about Tony at all would make Tony feel any better.
“Mh-hm,” was as much as Steve could manage - along with a very enthusiastic nod. Tony’s smile darkened into a grin as he picked it up, like he knew how Steve’s blood would jump, seeing that collar in Tony’s hands… When their eyes met, the spark was so physical that Steve’s shoulders tensed upright under the power of it, his body pulling him forward even before Tony instructed him, calmly,
These were just the darkest fears from the recesses of his mind - and it was probably ridiculous to throw away his only chance at happiness on such a vague what if…
He sat up again, and made himself look at the file reader. It was a homemade device that looked like a tablet computer, except that this had been specifically designed as the most hack-proof piece of equipment on earth. The USB stick blinking patiently, the screen awake but blank, waiting for the download to complete… Tony stared at it anyway. He would
He already felt guilty, for the particular framing that was forming in his mind - but, really, that was only because he was framing it at all. Because it
That need to plan for every eventuality, risk assess every situation - leave as many options open as he could…
And Steve caught the jerking motion of Tony standing up suddenly, the colour already running out of his face by the time Steve looked over to him…
And a vague assurance that Tony would help them if they needed it, which had actually been the most difficult part. He’d thought about writing ‘
And then, before Steve could look over to the pile of bloody limbs at the other end of the room, his eyes caught on Tony.
Steve’s grip tightened reflexively, his voice cracking as he pleaded, desperately, into the crook of Tony’s neck,
“No, it’s… Look, the thing is – by the time someone cares about you, the deal is done. They’re invested, then. They’re going to get hurt when you get hurt, no matter how far away from it you try to keep them. They’re going to get hurt when you push them away, just as much as if anything actually happened to them. And they’re
some pretty fancy places… and this is…” He gestured vaguely to the bar at the back of the room. A huge, sparkling glass bar that might actually have been made entirely of diamonds.
Steve recognised his cue, and planted his feet more firmly on the floor, subtly broadening his shoulders.
fun in your head.” Tony carried on explaining. “People who daydream about walking into their office and shooting the place up – most of them wouldn’t even want to act it out, they wouldn’t even like the play pretend, in the moment. It’s
Instead focusing on that familiar pinch of injustice he felt on Tony’s behalf, that very specific protective instinct that he’d bitten back a thousand times before…
That feeling of confidence, and playfulness, and maybe a little bit of risk taking… was that what he would have been like, if Obie hadn’t taken everything from him? Is this the personality he would’ve had, the way he
“After you hit Wesley,” Tony carried on, awkwardly. “I think maybe even after that thing with Nick… There was this… moment. And I liked it. And I don’t mean that in some creepy,
“Here,” he said, awkwardly dropping a heavy set of keys into Steve’s hand. “There’s a house a way down the beach, by the pier - the address is on the tag. It belongs to the company - to Stark Industries - I think it was employee housing or rented out or something, until last week…” And then he caught himself, waving away the unnecessary details and bringing himself back to the point. “But yeah… no one is really thinking about it, no one is staying there - I don’t think anyone even knows I have the keys, actually. I took them home by accident… So, yeah, if you need somewhere to stay, I don’t think anyone will look for you there…”
That there could have been some part of this that Steve could look back on, without remembering such horrible fear…
Apologies again for this slight delay in updating, and to anyone whose comment I've not yet gotten around to answering - and, more importantly, apologies for being such an unbearable tease. I swear to God, we're so close to those tags now... but not quite yet.
He was about to lose the only thing he’d cared about in twenty years, and there was nothing he could do about it. There was no way to prepare himself for it, there would be no making it better once it happened – by working out where the problem was, ahead of schedule, he’d actually just brought that date forward. And there was no answer to any of that, either.
And there were no more words after that. No more ideas. Just a burning, physical need that he could feel in every part of him, a total focus he’d never felt before in his life, a heightening of pleasure to almost frightening levels.
of those words was a visceral, physical reminder of that horrible night, and the dark months that followed it. Words he hadn’t let enter his head since he slammed those dusty books closed when he was 21. Words he
appealing idea that maybe his father had done something similar. That all this time Tony had been taking his fathers’ shifty gestures as some indication of Steve’s nature, when in fact they were a sign of Howard’s own guilt and inadequacies...
Interesting fact: there was a ‘vampire family’ in 16th Century Russia who were known for being expert healers. People would travel from all over Europe to seek their advice and remedies.
. Tony didn’t know how that made him feel. Mainly, he was concerned that it made him feel anything at all… “You can see yourselves out, right?” He added, somewhat abruptly – neither of them seemed to take it personally.
only led to the guilt he felt about the life he was leading… It led to memories of that long, awkward talk with Pepper, and the shame that curled with every word he’d said to her since… The fact that he was lying to her by keeping Steve a secret. The fact that he didn’t trust her enough to tell the truth.
If, maybe, this was just a simple case of him falling in love with someone that was out of his league.
And then he rounded the corner and saw Steve, Sam and Bucky, standing at a little distance from the people clamouring for drinks, Sam hovering anxiously behind Bucky… who was... yelling at Steve?
Steve’s spine straightened up from under him. He felt an instant stab of adrenaline, a hot prickle of irritation over his skin.
I’m sorry I said that about you tearing The Avengers apart and… a lot of things I said because I was angry and scared or just plain insensitive, and I didn’t mean them.”
For a start – Steve had never had the luxury. Every time Steve had been faced with a complete crisis of self, or had his entire perception of reality shaken… which happened
“The thing is… I’m not going to tell you we’re the same in any way,” Bucky said. “I mean, how the hell do I know if that’s true, right? I feel like it sometimes – I should probably tell you that. Even before last night, sometimes I’d feel like maybe you got it somehow. But who am I to guess why that might be…”
That first hour after Steve hung up, so much had tried to crowd into Tony’s head that it’d turned into a deafening white noise. He’d been infused with such sudden and overwhelming energy that he didn’t know what to do with himself.
Steve had mourned a lost future in which Tony got to grow old with Pepper and Morgan, back when it was the only ‘happy ending’ he could imagine. For so long,
is Fritz Haber,” Steve informed him brightly. “Often called the father of chemical warfare. He’s the man responsible for creating the chlorine gases that killed millions of men in the most brutal way possible, and very nearly won the war for Hitler. Do you know what he was working on, before he became a mass murderer?” He paused, waiting for Nick to shoot him an impatient look before he continued, “Fritz Haber wanted to end world hunger. When he started his research, it was because of a fertilizer shortage in Europe - they say that half Europe would’ve starved to death, if it weren’t for Herr Haber. He developed a method for extracting nitrogen from the air, and that method is now thought to be used in two thirds of the world's food production - did you know that?”
To suggest every idea that he thought Steve might like, without worrying what it would mean in the long run.
Steve’s continued bemusement that he wasn’t going to question it… But it was as though Tony’s brain just dismissed that for him.
you,” Tony whispered, hot against Steve’s ear, his movements dragging waves of friction up through Steve’s hips.
Tony had filled an emptiness in Steve that Bucky could never reach. There was a part of Steve that already belonged to Tony, a part of him that Bucky could never get to.
“He did. He still does, actually,” he replies. And then, with only the suggestion of a questioning tone, he adds, “You remember Steve…?”
Steve felt his fear boil over into anger - a scalding, physical rage that tensed his jaw and curled his fists-
That’s how the fantasy always went – because it wouldn’t be fun, it wouldn’t be satisfying, it wouldn’t be
That was what he’d decided before this strange emotional interlude – that was what his rational brain had thought best, and it was always best to go with that…
“Please,” he barked, dropping his shoulders and lifting his hips and trying to wriggle back against Steve’s hands - thrilled to find that Steve’s hold was too strong for Tony to be able to move him. “Please Steve, please-”
Of course, he had been every bit as frustrated as Steve for the last two days, and he was still agitatedly counting the minutes until he could be with him -
else’s behaviour. He had let those first few exchanges colour his view of Steve – even after Steve had spent years treating him better than that. He
“I’m so glad you’re here,” Steve said, with no attempt to hide the sincerity and emotion in his voice - how could there be? He hadn’t known he was going to say it.
A static charge started to build on the surface of Steve’s skin, his lungs burning as the air around him thinned.
But he couldn’t have called and asked for forgiveness. He couldn’t have simply said he understood a thousand things that Steve hadn’t even said. He couldn’t have started by saying they could move past it – not with only that letter between them. It wasn’t even a pride thing. It just wouldn’t have worked. It would have only dealt with a tiny part of the picture. It would have left all those issues out there, waiting for them – all the revelations he was sure Steve wouldn’t have come to, if it had gone that way…
“Jesus Tony,” he gasped, his gaze falling on Tony’s mouth. And then he felt Tony’s thumb slide over the button at his fly, hesitating as he whispered,
“Well, no,” Steve answered thoughtfully. “I think Fritz Harber knowingly, willingly, signed up to an evil, poisonous political regime, and I don’t want to downplay that,” he said, as though to make clear he wasn’t making this concession out of any affection for Fury, but rather a specific hatred of the Nazis. “I think Fury is just arrogant, and short sighted, and far too sure of his own point of view, and far too willing to dismiss the consequences for others… That’s not the same thing.” And then he paused, a flicker of thought creasing his forehead before he added, “
Steve had always been ashamed to want too much, when other people had so little. Always embarrassed to ask for anything, even in his own head. Even if he
about all of that, I really am. I’d say if I wasn’t, because apparently I can’t help saying everything right now. And I
But, for a moment, Tony simply considered him with a sort of blank interest - an expression Steve just couldn’t read.
“And by the people-acting-weird-stuff, you mean like that Vanessa woman just abandoning her company?” Steve clarified.
The Red Skull smiled back, as though he knew exactly what Steve meant, and reached out to take the stone from him.
It was like a nagging feeling of anxiety, an irritable fear that he’d done something terrible or forgotten something important. A feeling that permanently distracted him and set his body in a state of constant tension. It made it almost impossible for him to maintain any train of thought, which only added to the feeling that he was missing something…
that this approach had cost him as much as it had saved him… maybe more…. Seeing as he knew, deep down, that pretending things were simple had never stopped them being complicated. Pretending to be sure had never made him sure – it had never made him right, after the fact. So, he
Which had just left him with an immediate and overwhelming instinct to flee from the situation - something that had apparently motivated him all the way along the beachfront before he’d stopped to question it.
All the background reading he’d done about Bucky, about the history of Hydra and their work… and their various bases…
He felt only slightly less responsible for the fact that Nat and Pepper had chosen to tag along. Of course, they had missed the initial argument, and probably wouldn’t have been dragged into the silliness of it even if they’d been there - officially speaking, it had been their own choice to come. But Steve still felt like the awful afternoon they were about to suffer through was somehow on him. That it had been triggered by him. That he could have stopped this whole thing a long time ago…
“We don’t have to go, you know,” Sam interrupted his thoughts, dragging him back into the world with a disorienting jolt.
The computer announced something, a string of unconnected noises happening far, far away… Steve was too busy telling himself not to kill this man. Not even because of the actual words he was saying. Steve
If Tony could ride this wave of nausea, if he could wait out this overwhelming panic… something better would come. Some pleasant memory, some reassuring thought.
. Tony knew it was terrible to hope that Rhodey had a point, to hope that his life could be a little bit better – he knew it would hurt all the more when it was crushed. And he knew it would be even worse, if he admitted that hope now. If he actually told Rhodey that he was, for a moment, considering whether he maybe had a point… it would mean
what you did, to save me. What you’ve been doing, all this time. Don’t think for a second that you’ve ever once let me down, because you haven’t. Not even after everything you’ve been through. Even now, with
And there were still all those voices in Tony’s head. At least forty years of nasty, judgemental voices, and they all still knew their cues, they knew what they were meant to leap in with now… But, oh, they were all consumed by doubt, now, and second guessing each other and arguing with themselves… they didn’t fit anymore, they couldn’t argue back… until all of that had just faded into a nonsensical noise…
And then Tony was just standing there, his phone still pressed against his ear, a stupid grin plastered all over his face.
He gritted his teeth, giving his injured hand another shake before he checked it again… Still a little bit surprised by how quickly it healed. That he could actually
“As it happens, you really aren’t worth the time or effort,” he sang, back to his cheerful voice. “If you’re going to learn all that, you can do it on your own. I just wanted you to know that the organisation you work for is actually run by Hydra, and that there is literally no one you can go to for help. Not Hill. Not Natasha. Not anyone. Remember, if Alexander Pierce can be a Nazi, anyone can. So, maybe think a bit about that weapon you’re helping them to build. And be careful…” He stepped back, and took a theatrical look around the room, squinting at all the dark corners before he warned Nick, “there could be eyes
Steve, looking at him like that… What might’ve happened, if it had been just the two of them there, if Steve already knew and there was no drama or trauma or complicated conversation to have…
And then Steve leant into him, and Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, trying to draw him closer.
And then Tony had worked his way down as far as the dip of Steve’s waist, his fingertips digging into Tony’s the soft skin over the curve of Steve’s hipbones, and Steve rocked into it instinctively-
,” Steve continued to gush, an amazed smile seeping into his voice, “and unarmed, and injured, and tortured, and terrorized - and the bravest thing I could imagine any civilian doing under those circumstances was refusing to help them. And the smartest thing I could imagine anyone doing was sabotaging that weapon. And
And, for a few minutes, it worked. Steve was able to put all his excess energy and all his tension into the physical exertion of it, focusing his entire being into those simple, brutal motions. He listened to the rhythm of his heart, and his revelled in the pure relief of his breathing, and he let his mind run away from him in the same way as his body. The background noise faded; the resistance melted away. He let those ideas and memories flow through him, as he let that force run up his back and through his arms,
to show Steve this, to share it with him, to make Steve understand the multi-layered importance of it. Tony made a point of telling himself so – in the playful tone of a parent, pretending to be strict in the build up to a big surprise.
He sighed, already looking over at the stack of spares that was always waiting for him in the corner of the gym. He knew he should just walk over and get one. That he should move right onto the next thing, think
Tony’s shoulders softened slightly, more in weariness than relief. The compromised comfort of knowing that he had at least found the crux of the matter under all the noise - however messy it was.
“Well… you know you said that there are all these sick kids that need blood, but not enough people donate it?”
“So, where are we going?” He asked lightly, trying to stay in the moment. Fighting the temptation to catalogue all the things he could see and feel, or run away with
And Tony didn’t want that anyway. Not right now. He’d reached that particular stage of melancholy where he didn’t
Before too long Tony wasn’t just remembering those moments - he was imaging them. Happily dreaming of a future where he and Steve could be together like that…
Without even realising it, Steve had come crashing back to the real world. He’d remembered that there was such a thing as consequences, that there was such a thing as the future – that there were in fact a thousand potential futures, and he did care which one he ended up in, and it was up to him to do something about it-
It had all sounded so measured and final when he was practising beforehand… and then it had come out hesitant and unsure and
He threw a poisonous glare in the direction of his desk. He knew it was ridiculous, but he couldn’t help feeling like that stupid file had ruined everything, that his life had been so happy and hopeful and good before that one piece of paper…
“Okay Steve, I know this probably isn’t the right time, but we’ve gone way past the right time so many times that you’re running out of time,” Bucky began, impatiently - all of which went right over Steve’s head. “So, I’m sorry if this comes out all wrong or if you find it hard to listen to me, but you
“It would be nice to get a straight answer out of someone for once…” Steve mused eventually, falling into the back of the couch again. “…I actually don’t know how we’re going to work this out if we can’t find
mean, that would make me walk away from you,” Tony carried on, breathlessly. “There isn’t anything I want in this world more than I want to be with you. I love you. I love every brilliant, brave, sweet, stupid, infuriating thing about you - and I would have, if I’d met you in 1942. And I’d have promised you forever without a second thought - and I’d have stood by you through anything. I don’t need a vampire impulse to tell me that.”
“Oh,” Tony blinked, shaking his head as he remembered why they’d started talking about this. “Oh, that was the big mistake, not telling me?” He frowned. “Wait, why didn’t you tell me that?”
“It was a stupid plan to stop an imaginary threat, and the whole thing was very unfair to Tony,” he continued, recognising the strange lightness that had bubbled up in his voice. “And when I look back, it's really obvious that we should have just told him, and that he probably would have fixed things better than we did, and I think were were all really stupid about the whole thing from start to finish,” he finished by throwing Scott a smug smile,
Because Tony – naïve and foolish little cherub that he was – had been braced for an alien lab full of inhumane experiments. An army of brainwashed people, being prepped for warfare. A huge slug, awaiting its next human sacrifice. You know, something simple.
And, if you are caught cheating, you know better than to point out all the previous problems in the relationship that might not have been all your fault.
“Well, your name isn’t on the deed yet, obviously,” Tony muttered, having suddenly come over all shy. “That would probably be a bit hard to explain, seeing as I’m still technically supposed to be trying to track you down… I think… But, once we’ve got the team pardoned, it
“Well, I can’t really take any credit,” Steve muttered, finally starting his own meal. Trying very hard not to look smug. “Like I say, it’s not my recipe.”
And, of course, once Steve realised what he was doing, he realised it wouldn’t work. That no amount of paperwork would make him feel any more prepared, or any more in control – or any less anxious. That nothing he did tonight would make tomorrow come any quicker. That he wouldn’t feel any more relaxed right now, however much admin he got done.
He didn’t know what to call this awed sense of joy and excitement that was so far beyond either of those words. He didn’t know how to categorize this nervousness that wasn’t bad and wasn't frightening…
thought about taking the easy way out, or letting someone else take the fall. I never once set out to be spiteful, not out of jealousy, not out of anger, not for revenge, not
And, by now, Steve was simply going from one sentence to the next. He forgot to consider the context, as he let his mind unpack the last few words he’d heard…
Whether belonging to something, by definition, meant there had to be someone who didn’t belong. Whether there had to be
He forced a long, slow breath out through his nose, as quietly as he could, before he slid his fingers under his waistband and retrieved the tiny glass cylinder he had concealed there. He curled his fingers around it, reminding himself not to squeeze too tight yet. And then he arranged his features into a concerned expression and looked over at Gary.
But, Jesus, Steve looked more beautiful with every second… this look of, sort of…awe-struck wonder had come over his face, and his eyes looked even bluer, and… God, it was more than beautiful. It was
“…You want to ask if we can extend our stay?” Steve quirked an eyebrow – and Tony pulled a sour face.
heard of Tyrone Powers, a few weeks earlier. And not only because no one from this century had heard of him. Steve could see it in Tony’s reaction. Slightly shy and a little bit embarrassed and mostly hopeful…
“...more than I do, probably,” Steve realised out loud. “I… feel like I haven’t been thinking about the right stuff. For a long time. Like maybe I’d know myself better if I hadn’t been so afraid to look, all this time…”
The room filled with the sound of chimes again - and, again, everybody looked up in bafflement for a second. And then Tony remembered, and sighed,
Tony felt a little smile take him by surprise. There was that pang of empathy again. That little flicker of connection, which he was starting to think might just
“Yeah, okay…” Bucky muttered, straightening his shoulders in that way Steve knew only too well. “You’re going in the ball pit-”
“So, yeah, whatever happens, I’m going to be here, loving you and doing whatever I can to make your life better, even if I’ve got to do it from a distance…” Tony summarised, self-consciously. And then he gathered himself, taking a little breath and setting his shoulders before he added, “but, honestly, I don’t want to do it at a distance.”
Steve was thinking of the raid at Helen Cho’s lab, the fact that Wanda and Peitro had helped Ultron to take her hostage.
… It would be nice, to let himself slip into this now. It was so much more exhausting to stay focused, so much
“Oh my God, I’m so sorry” She gasped – obviously trying not to smile. And Tony just laughed, positively
Steve, wrapped up in someone else’s arms, letting someone else comfort him and reassure him and look after him…
He grabbed roughly at the back of Steve’s head, tears stinging the corners of his eyes, every muscle in his body tensed in a desperate need for release.
“Jesus Christ my whole life just flashed before my eyes,” Rhodey panted, reaching over to snatch his keys out of the ignition. Tony just let him. He’d moved on from the ‘car’ part of this plan.
Tony paused, the marker pen still poised in his fingers, a specific little smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
“Now, you rest,” Tony replied warmly, dropping his head to kiss Steve’s forehead. “And then we’ll get you cleaned up, and wrapped up in soft things, and I can finish telling you just how wonderful you are…”
Just like I used to worry about you doing dumb things before there was Steve. Before you were a vampire, even. But I’d never think you were going to hurt me, or screw me over, just because you weren’t thinking straight – then or now.” And then he made a point of turning in his seat, so that he could look Tony right in the eye when he told him.
had been the outcome Steve had wished for, the only way he could picture a world in which they won… Back when winning that fight was the only alternative that existed.
But then Tony pressed just a little firmer against him, swallowing hard and exhaling heavily before he met Steve’s gaze. Steve felt a kick in his gut, and managed to pull himself to a tense, fidgety stop under Tony’s palm. And then Tony flexed his fingers against Steve’s skin, affectionate and reassuring, his eyes wide and warm… but his tone was steady, and very serious, when he asked,
And –  I always hated people who argued like that with me. Like whatever I tried to do wasn’t good enough unless it was perfect, even for people who didn’t have a better plan. Or like there was some ‘right’ answer, and if I even needed to have it explained to me then I was somehow lacking, and… I really didn’t mean to do that to you. I didn’t mean it to sound like… I was just, probably more emotional than I should’ve been, right then, and it probably came out all wrong, so…” And he shrugged, good-naturedly, and then finally added. “I’m sorry.”
Steve knew so much of the difficulty Tony had with this was not knowing how to react to it – well, he knew it
...Did he really want to do any of these things? Or was it only that he hated the thought of not being
He traded cheerful small talk with the few engineers that Nick introduced him to on the way, always simply as Steve.
“Which part confuses you?” Steve enquired, cheerily. “You didn’t know you were working for the Nazis?” And with that, he tossed the rest of his papers onto the table, letting them fan out in an untidy display. This time, he didn’t pause to let Nick take them before he carried on. “You
“Oh, God Tony, I’m sorry, please don’t leave me, please – I swear, I can be better, I will be better, I’ll never lie to you or hurt you like this ever again, please just give me a chance-”
“You haven’t upset me.” Steve said, quietly, a blush running up his neck as fought the urge to look at the floor. “I just… I, uh, I’d like to explain that, but…”
“You… Make it hard, for me to be nice to you, sometimes.” Steve started, carefully, watching Tony’s face – so far, just the faintest hint of surprise… “It’s like you don’t know what to do with a genuine compliment, or you’re scared of actually valuing someone else’s opinion of you, or you’re wary of trusting a kindness… and, all of that breaks my heart. To think you’ve been hurt that much, and hounded that much, and attacked and put down that much… I don’t blame you, for this. Partly, I blame me for this, for whatever part I played in making you feel like-”
Steve thought about getting up then. It wouldn’t even have been ‘getting up’, really; Steve had just been sitting on the edge of his bed all night. Part of him was dying to leave his self-imposed solitary confinement, to face the unbearable tension that he could feel building on the other side of that door. Part of him
Tony held his grip firm as he helped Steve step across the floor. There was a happy strangeness to the springiness of it underfoot, something harmlessly
Every inch of him throbbed with a pleasant ache, as a shimmering giddiness rolled lazily through his head.
he wouldn’t be able to go to Tony for help again, after this was over. That had always been part of the deal.
“You know…” Steve spoke up, awkwardly. Tony blinked, still trying to focus when Steve carried on, “I mean, obviously, you don’t need my permission to fall asleep in your own house,” he gestured vaguely to their surroundings. “....But I mean, if you wanted to get some rest…”
“I thought I was going mad!” He exclaimed, too loud and too sharp. And he saw Steve flinch, and he really tried to calm himself - but- “I have
taking my blood,” Steve exclaimed, panicked and angry and openly emotional. He felt Bucky sit up straighter, shifting his gaze from Stape to the side of Steve’s head.
he’d control himself the next time. So he made himself keep his head upright – for long enough to realise that Steve wasn’t looking at him right now. Steve was looking over Tony’s shoulder, his eyes following Bucky’s movement, softening in sympathy as Bucky slowly sat himself upright. Tony could tell that, for the moment, Steve didn’t know that Tony
watch it. I just… I thought you should have the choice, and I couldn’t watch it without… unless you wanted me to… But… Me finding this doesn’t mean you have to do anything at all, especially not right now…”
And all the while, Steve had carried on trading jokes with him, and accepting his hopeful invitations, and casually lying about what he’d been doing at the weekend, and dismissing Tony when he asked what was wrong with him lately…
And, in Steve’s defence, that was mostly because there were so many rumours about Tony Stark. A lot of it was just Steve remembering the things other people said, rather than coming up with these ideas himself. That Tony Stark was been horribly scarred in some sort of accident, that Tony Stark had spent the last twenty years modifying his body, that he had some sort of wasting disease… And Steve had known it was all very unkind and very unlikely and that it shouldn’t have factored into his impression of Tony Stark one way or the other – but, yeah,
wasn’t worth something… ‘I am trying to get it right’ is not quite the same as ‘I just keep getting it wrong.’ ‘Sometimes I doubt even my core beliefs’ doesn’t mean that isn’t what you believe in.”
” He gasped, incredulous. Not really because JARVIS had talked back, but because Tony had the sudden idea that his AI had just
Steve was forced to stop then. He was overwhelmed by such a powerful affection for him that it made his legs feel weak.
Steve’s shoulders tensed, as they began to walk towards the group, their eyes locked on him specifically. He braced his legs against a bodily urge to flee, his lips already parting to give the objection he hadn’t thought of yet-
Steve’s body jerked inwards, his cock pulsing with a sharp, searing pain. He was still so sensitive, still flooded with the afterglow of the last time Tony made him come-
Or whether he wanted to pull Tony into his arms, and tell him it was okay, that however Tony wanted to deal with this, Steve would support him-
It was so powerful that his legs literally weakened, and he was forced to sink inelegantly to the floor. His heart started racing in his ears, his breaths coming higher and faster as he recognised what Steve had
. That all of his desire and urgency came direct from how much he loved him. That no one else could have met this need in Tony – no one else could have inspired it. Steve could
“Well, no – just cos someone fucks you, doesn’t mean they like you,” Tony corrected him. He heard Rhodey huff out an exasperated little breath, and went on “
it was all a bad idea, something he should have stopped to think about when everything changed… Well, he’d sort of forgotten what ‘reason’ was, right now. So, that would simply have to wait.
There was another flash, and immediately Tony’s hand was on Steve’s shoulder, pressing against him reassuringly through yet another burst of light-
The direct translation of which seemed to be ‘an abomination’ – which Tony had to admit, was a nice touch. There was something quite satisfying, vindicating even, to think there was once a whole group of people who would have seen Obie as nothing more than that…

A pointed observation about why their experiments were obviously flawed to begin with, before an unfriendly agent became involved.
probably think there’s been no harm done, and as much as I still think it’s creepy and wrong… I’m not sure I actually care anymore,” Tony realised out loud. “...I just wish I’d figured that out before I dragged Bucky and Sam on the world's most boring mid-day hike, and got arrested-”
As such, Tony didn’t bother to leave a pause before he sent the response that he and Steve had already agreed on.
And then he saw that tiny pearl of perfect, crimson blood roll over the curve of Steve’s fingers… He could feel Steve watching him watch. Tony’s mouth watered in anticipation, his teeth burning almost pleasantly in his jaw, his gaze drawn to the vein throbbing just under the surface of Steve’s skin. He could feel Steve’s heart beating in his own chest.
The world around him faded to nothing, the very concept of reality disappeared, Steve lost all sight of the barrier between his own consciousness and everything else.
Tony gave another little squeak of alarm, frantically scanning in all directions for any possible means of escape, before he scrambled around Nat and Sam…
Tony swallowed down his many questions and objections for fear of what might slip out after them - which left him with an awful lot of words in his head.
“Sure, sure, the car’s up on the kerb,” Happy replied, gesturing to what was clearly an illegal park job.
Tony waited a few minutes after he made that call, until he felt that little surge of relief that told him Steve had gotten the message. Then he sent Steve another text,
Tony had to squeeze his eyes shut, first against the flood of morning light, and then against the flurry of activity that was apparently still going on in The Facility grounds…
He heard the scream get caught in Steve’s throat as a guttural choking sound. His entire body tensed up towards Tony’s lips, one hand clawing over the back of Tony’s head - like it was all he could do to keep from grabbing him by the hair and fucking his face.
When Tony had stripped him completely he gave Steve the softest push, and Steve just let himself fall into the couch. The sheets felt so cool against his skin, silky soft and obviously expensive…
“What’re we doing?” Steve tried pulling things into order, grabbing for what he thought was a priority question.
“Well, not really hurt me, to be honest,” Tony corrected. “I think it might just have been… well, maybe not a
There was a serious impulse to snatch it back, to snap that if Steve was going to be so ridiculous about it, he couldn’t have it-
let people help you, because you don’t want them to get hurt? Or, you don’t want them to get mixed up in things, or you don’t want to see them try and fail…”
it. Because he wanted it now more than he ever had, now that he’d worked himself up into this state, now that everything was out there and
Tony whimpered, rocking up to meet this new rhythm, one hand grabbing frantically at the sheets and the other clawing at the back of Steve’s head. He gasped for air, a pleading note in every breath, waves of pleasure crashing over the top of one another, pushing harder and harder against that limit. That frustration burned brighter with every sweep of Steve’s tongue, until eventually it consumed him, his every thought and feeling and impulse focused on this desperate pursuit for release-
And Tony brought the bag to his lips, letting his teeth rest on the surface for just a second… letting himself feel Steve’s blood waiting there for him…
“But you don’t mean that.” Steve said, more soberly. He felt Tony straighten, just behind him, but he didn’t take his eyes off of Adam.
“You have no idea how good that was,” Tony promised him. “Or how fucking good I feel right now. Really. This isn’t something I put up with for you, you know.”
He thought of Tony being weak and vulnerable, simply because of his selfless impulse to leave the best for other people-
Steve melted into it immediately, moaning against Tony’s lips - still rutting against his hand. Tony ran his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock, wetting his fingers before he started working him off in fast, sharp strokes. Steve’s muffled cries reverberated down through Tony’s jaw as he carried on kissing him, devouring Tony’s mouth now, nipping at his bottom lip as he rocked his whole body into him.
His chest was still heaving in a desperate attempt to draw enough air into his lungs, his head was still swimming.
He felt like he was having an actual crisis of faith. Like he was looking back on a lifetime of religious devotion. The decision to seriously think about changing, to consider that there might be an alternative, was a huge step in itself.
“-Those are the performances we stage in the main hall, after dinner each night - without wishing to brag, they’re considered the crowning jewel of the whole event. And, of course, this year we’ll be celebrating The Avengers, and we would
Steve exhaled as subtly as he could, his fingers twitching against a desire to ball his hands into fists. And then Tony brushed a gentle touch over the side of Steve’s face.
His voice literally trailed off into a whimper as he tried to process that. Realising as it hit him that

tone of voice. His mind was still set to that worst-case-scenario mode, his body preemptively tensing toward action, as he opened the text.
There was the physical temptation to keep looking over to him. The constant awareness of the shape of him, just out of his field of vision, like something caught in his eyelash. And the growing danger that he was going to find himself thinking all the things he’d been running from for months – that, if he wasn’t very careful, he’d end up thinking that Steve
And then there was a sudden startled yelp from Tony, and a sharp intake of breath, as he flinched back into Steve’s arms.
And all the while that warmth kept building, bubbling up into a pleasant sort of excitement now that he’d allowed it.
in a way that he’d never felt before, in a way he probably had no right to feel - but that he simply took for granted, at the time.
miss those. It had taken far too much time and effort to get to this point. There was just too much on the line. And, logically, Tony knew it would bring him closer to Steve if he went to those meetings.
The door opened with a jolt. Wesley appeared wearing an impatient expression, which quickly sharpened into apprehension when he realised who it was. Tony noticed that his shoulder still looked misshapen.
a dream, but a very specific reality - that safe, natural place he sometimes fell into with Steve… A state that Tony had so comfortably slipped into the night before, and didn’t want to leave yet…
And Tony let Steve kiss him. He let Steve’s lips gently tease his mouth open, he let his body melt against Steve… He let himself have this-
And then Steve put his arms around him, and he was suddenly lightheaded, just high on the smell of him…

“Nice enough,” Steve answered instead. “Although not ‘interesting’, really…” He tried not to look smug when Tony giggled at that.

“Indeed there is,” Freddie replied with a far-too-friendly smile. “As a matter of fact, there is a full guide that we’d be delighted to share with you - it also contains a more detailed itinerary of events, and some details on the history of Bulsara, and the festival.”
“Steve,” Tony spoke very gently from behind Steve’s shoulder - and immediately a wave of physical relief rolled up along his spine.
Steve immediately recognised it as a gunshot and jarred to a painful stop, instinctively ducking and bringing his hands up to cover his head.
“Where?” Tony enquired, more animatedly - pointedly ignoring the low rumble of snickering from the other side of him.
And, on top of all that, there was the growing recognition of just how worried he was about Tony. All the things he’d heard for the first time last night, that just seemed to get worse and worse, the longer they had to settle in his head. All the things he didn’t know… all the new concerns that had started to occur to him-

“No, I don’t regret it,” Steve carried on, more cautiously. “And, I mean… To be honest, I’d never really imagined myself… well, being in
place. That, in all his years of having this argument, with Tony or with the memory of him, Steve had never yet tried being honest like that… Whatever it led to, it wouldn’t be the same rhythm that they’d run through so many times that it was etched on the inside of his skull. There was a giddy sort of release, simply in that.

All at once, Steve realised what he’d really been looking for on this trip - and why he was never going to find it. He recognised that he hadn’t been looking for the world of Brooklyn Heights in the thirties…
unbearably frustrated – and it wasn’t like he hadn’t noticed that issue before Tony Stark came into the picture. Steve had been trying to ignore it, sure. He’d tried to convince himself it was a minor issue, in the grand scheme of things… But, okay, he
“I take it the base in Sokovia was a no, then?” Steve sighed, his thumb rubbing anxious circles on the back of the phone he was still holding.
“Anything connected to the main server” Tony confirmed, proudly. “It’s like a virus, it just spreads from there.”
When the portal closed behind them there was a moment of deafening silence. A sudden isolation and stillness that almost buzzed around their heads.
He hadn’t just behaved insensitively, when he first met Steve. It wasn’t just a years-old mistake that he had to say sorry for. It wasn’t even the catalogue of equally thoughtless remarks that he’d made since, or any of the… many…many errors of judgement he’d made, about Steve… It wasn’t just ‘the things’ he had to apologise for.
The part of it that was undeniably a human reaction to the pain Tony was feeling – a response to the part of
And when he did… When he felt Tony’s smile melt against his lips, his hands snaking around his waist, warm and affectionate and
mean something. That Tony could be failing Steve in a deep and brutal way, if his own prejudices kept him from believing Steve when he said he wanted this…
On balance, giving himself some leeway for the mind-altering drugs, he could probably stand by everything he’d said. Some of it he should’ve said to other people, okay. But he’d basically give a (much less dramatically worded) assessment of
Steve gripped himself tighter, working himself off in shorter, sharper motions, but every sensation simply frustrated the need he was trying to sate-
“And, you’re right, I don’t really know what I’m talking about, and if I’ve just massively put my foot on it or said something really insensitive, then I’m really, really sorry…”
But that’d been too complicated. So he’d just followed Tony into the unknown, and spent the last few hours hoping that maybe they were just on the other side of the planet – that maybe they

, by the chip we added – like, literally by the physical intrusion of it…” And then Tony paused, and shook his head, and reminded himself that Bucky probably wasn’t interested in theory, right now. “But, the point is, this means that a) we’ve probably found the problem, which saves any more exploratory surgery and b) the problem happens to be in an accessible place, so that should make fixing it much easier.”
Steve hoped that, with the additional information he’d have, and the impact he could have simply by being there,
“Thank you,” he smiled, his stomach twisting pleasantly at the little flicker of recognition in Tony’s eyes.
But, of course, the light bulb had already lit up in Tony’s brain - and Steve’s too, if the way he tensed was any indication.
“But you’re not worried about that now?” Steve asked, carefully. And Bucky paused to consider it before he answered.
There was a large, square living area, with a cream coloured carpet that was so thick it bounced to walk on it. There were three huge couches, and Steve had no idea what fabric they were covered with, but it was so luxurious that a shiver ran up his spine when he touched it. The bathroom was bigger than Steve’s apartment. He only glanced into the one bedroom, but he was pleased to see that the bed was roughly the size of a parade float…not that it should matter, he reminded himself, as he fully intended to sleep on the couch.
denied that he wanted to be with Tony. He’d never pretended that he thought Tony’s relationship with Pepper was somehow superior, or that he hoped it worked out for them this time. He didn’t claim not to have an interest, here.
“...If we do this - if you’re going to actually be my boyfriend… Then you have to let me be your boyfriend,” Tony said, more seriously. Steve, whose heart had hiccupped at the mention of the word, could only wait for him to continue, “the thing that finally made me believe this could work is the fact that you opened up to me. I just need to know that
Twenty years of putting his every human impulse into a box labelled ‘for later’, all these unspoken, unquestioned rules about what was really important… Somewhere along the line, Steve had lost sight of what he was putting off. He’d been so sure for so long that his personal preferences weren’t the priority, that his own hopes and ambitions would have to wait, that he had no choice but to sacrifice what he wanted… He hadn’t even realised that he’d forgotten what it was.
“Okay, I’ll put my top AI on it,” Tony laughed. “But I should probably finish with this project first…” he suggested, gesturing to Bucky’s arm.
– but I did that once, when I first met you, and I think it literally ruined my life, and probably could’ve ended the whole world, and might have
talking “For the things I did, and the way I treated you, and so many of the choices I made. I should have told you about your parents, right from the start. I wish I’d called you after Bucky broke out of the compound. I’m sorry for so many of the things I did, and said, when I was in a panic of my own making. I
“Apparently my blood is a national secret,” Steve rushed on. “And I can’t go giving batches away at community blood drives, and I don’t even know the effect it might have on someone else, blah, blah, blah… Do you think that’s even true?”
And then Tony pushed back with more force, all but throwing Steve onto the bed, climbing on top of him with incredible speed. Steve groaned, arching his back in desperation as Tony leant his weight up into his arms, so that he could look down over him.
“Oh, um, I don’t actually think you need any of this,” Steve muttered, holding it out to him, “But, I thought, you know, just in case…”
And then he’d got as far as clearing away the body armour he’d been working on. At first, there was a little lift in his chest, as he remembered Steve taking an interest in it before. Another little flicker of excitement, as he thought about telling Steve how far it had come. Thinking that Steve would be interested to see it. Wondering if it would be finished… before…
“And it’s fine,” Tony forced the conversation forward, glancing away again. “I mean, it gets the job done. I’m not going to starve to death on it…”
From being as confused and fuzzy headed as he’d ever been in his life, Steve now felt as though he could literally see everything in more detail. He could hear more sharply. And, when he looked at the little device in his hand, the name immediately occurred to him – as did the entire plan it was attached to.
