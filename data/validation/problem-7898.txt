But it doesn’t last much longer than that.
The following morning, Stark casually strolls into the kitchen for his customary cup of coffee, as if nothing untoward had occurred the night before. That’s fine with Clint. He is all too happy to ignore the elephant in the room as well, but then Stark just has to open his fat mouth and ask for a favor.
Tony sits up, his back straight and eyes wide. “Oh my God, you’re a genius,” he dives for the phone. “I have to tell him!” he tries to dial, but his fingers are clumsy and slow, much slower than Rhodey who similarly flops over and slams a limp hand down on the cradle of the phone to cut the call. Tony tries to push him off, but Rhodey is persistent, slapping him away.
Steve crosses his arms. “I don’t know what your problem is. Hawaiian pizza is good. It’s sweet and a little salty.”
Tony looks up sharply at the camera. “No. Absolutely not. What’s he got to do with any of this?”
“But yours has M&M’s,” Tony whispers back. “Besides, stolen popcorn tastes better.”
“Master Erskine has transcended this life and returned to the Force. That is my fate, as it is yours and the fate of everything living,” Master Phillips interjects. “But in the meantime, have patience.”
Rhodey concurs, “That could work,” before turning to Stark. “They’re also checking all outbound flights. You’re gonna need to find a place to hide him onboard in order to pass inspection. Otherwise that’s an armada of tie fighters on your ass.”
Though much too late to fool anyone, Steve quickly plops back into his bed, rolls on his side away from the door, and pulls the covers up to his neck, feigning sleep.
, on the corner of an alley, wondering if it is the libel of a jealous rival or an advertisement of her popularity and success as a prostitute. Perhaps it is even the scribbling of a jilted ex-lover considering the response written below in a feminine hand, declaring
Steve wonders, and not for the first time, what is underneath that helmet. Stark sounds young (or at least not particularly old) and his body though armored is of a pleasing shape. He finds himself contemplating the color of Stark’s eyes, his hair, whether his nose is thin or broad and his chin sharp or rounded. Is he ugly under the helmet? Is that why he doesn’t find it so terrible to be hidden away as such? Steve has a hard time believing the man suffers from low self-esteem.
Antony is quiet at that.
Dracula scoffs. “Unimaginative.”
It’s not exactly the admission Tony was hoping for, but maybe in time–
“Don’t hold it like that,” Aemilius instructs him, correcting his grip on the net. “You need to release quickly and trap your opponent under so they cannot escape, then you deliver the winning blow.”
Tony simply wraps the Golden Rod himself and puts it into his own bag. “Yeah well, I can get you one later. If you’re good,” he says, before slinging it over his shoulder. “Now, let’s catalogue the other artifacts until Pepper can break us out.”
P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S / H-A-R-D-A-S-S
is the unspoken question.
And now Steve raises a brow. “And do you think they washed this… all-important artifact of its ‘healing essence’ before they lovingly stowed it away among the pharaoh’s unmentionables for his majesty’s continued use well into the afterlife?”
“The man’s arm was broken during training; it will take six weeks to heal, meaning he will miss our match altogether!” Stefanus shouts. “Crispus has been disciplined, but still he was able to afford multiple prostitutes to warm his bed for the week!” His arms flex, and he looks very much like he’d like to strangle Antony, but instead his hands cover his face, his fingers sliding down like claws over his eyes and down his cheeks as he takes a deep breath. “Bacchus is slated to be his replacement.”
“You mean if?”
“I knew you could be reason–”
Tony is stunned. He doesn’t know what to say, only: “Cap. Language.”
The two back down, the tension deflating as they both recline in their respective chairs.
“What do you think of the redhead sitting astride Marcus’s lap?” He tries again.
The bartender gives Tony a quick onceover and whistles low. “Moving on up in the world?” he asks before addressing Tony himself. “Can’t say I’m not jealous. Steve is one of the best. He’ll really take care of you, you know, and he has one hell of a flogging arm.”
Steve only grimaces as he massages the bruise developing on his thigh. “What’s the matter, Tony? Did I hurt you?”
Tony doesn’t know what happens next, which of them makes the first move, but the next thing he knows, he’s in Steve’s lap, his mouth on Steve’s, their tongues tangled together, and his ass grinding into the man’s growing erection. His lips slip down along Steve’s jawline to suck a line along his neck while Steve groans, his tone low and breathy as he chants Tony’s name like a prayer.
Steve tries to placate him. “Look, sometimes… Sometimes, you talk about different things with different friends, okay?”
And what?
Unfortunately, Antony and Tiberius run in the same social circles, and when Hadrianus presents his son at the Forum a month later as a fully-fledged citizen of Rome, Tiberius is there to snub his debut. The only youth who hadn’t followed Tiberius’s lead was Julianus Rabirius, the son of a plebian family of senatorial rank who had already been too low on the social ladder for Tiberius’s sway to have been effective.
Steve looks over at him. “So?”
“Who do you think it was?” Steve can’t help but ask.
‘Rhodey’ sticks, both the name and the man himself. He doesn’t much mind the moniker, preferring it to Tony’s other nicknames for him: honeybear, platypus, and – when Rhodey is in a foul mood – sourpatch. He quickly becomes a fixture in Tony’s life as he takes the younger student under his wing.
“Most men don’t want me like you do, not in the same fashion, and the women? They want me to pay for it, and I never really had the extra money lying around, so… so this is different.”
Stark’s shoulders slump. “Yeah.”
“Ow! Ow! Ow!” he complains, leaning into her hold to relieve the pressure.
“Quiet.” Purple Man tilts his head in an almost clinical consideration. “Won’t you look at that? I think he’d much prefer you, but it’s your call.” It makes sense, in a way. Thor is a beast of a man, an actual god amongst men (though one still under Purple Man’s control), and he supposes if one had to take it up the ass, smaller would be preferable.
But Dum Dum is unimpressed. “The way he’s going, he’ll be ninety-five before he gets his first kiss.”
“It is the curse of being Hadrianus’s son.”
“Yeah, big guy,” Tony concurs as he struggles to free himself, eventually popping loose of the Asgardian’s hold.
“Hm. It’s 8 a.m., and you’re still mostly sober. It must be a Christmas miracle… in July.”
“Tony, stop that,” his father shakes him off. “Have a little composure.”
“Children, the lot of them. I can assure you you have not encountered one so experienced and vicious as I.”
Parentalia was in February and was a festival in honor of the ancestors where the living visited family tombs outside the city walls.
Steve’s skin is clammy and salty with sweat as Tony sucks a mark on the back of his neck and listens to the gentle hitching of the other man’s breathy moans, his near-inaudible pleas. With Steve’s thighs spread and draped over Tony’s still-clothed arms, the position allows him to gently bounce Steve up and down his length. His body is svelte and lightweight, more like that of a woman than most men he had been with, the differences all the less obvious with Steve turned away from him, but Tony knows better than to say that out loud, lest he end up with another black eye and blue balls.
Mr. Rogers’s mouth straightens into a thin, hard line. “So, are you saying Irish need not apply?” His tone is harsh, his demeanor transformed into one of fight rather than docility as he straightens out to his full height and crosses his lanky arms.
Clint scoots out his chair, the legs screeching across the tile. “Don’t know what’s happening here. Don’t care. I’m out,” he says as he makes a beeline to his room. He can pack up, claim any of the other vacant guest rooms, perhaps even the one next to Nat. It’s on a different floor, and he’s sure his two team leaders will appreciate the privacy…
“Is this a test?” Steven tips his head to the left, as if trying to figure out Master Erskine’s game. “If I pass, will you be my new father?”
But Dum Dum shakes his head. “Nonsense. You are much wanted, especially when it is young Gabriel’s turn at the dice and the banker position falls to me. In such a case, I promise to split the proceeds betwixt you and I.” He grasps Steve’s shoulder, giving him a hearty pat. “Oh cheer up, old chum. Your luck is only shoring up for a big pay-day – I just know it – but in the meantime…”
Master Erskine nods. Fair enough.
Okay, now Steve is just being ridiculous. “I’m sure you’ll do fine. Tons of people kiss every day, and no one has died from it” that Tony knows of, anyway.
“You have our word,” the duo proclaim in unison. “Do we have a deal?”
“Suibne is ainm dom” is Irish for “Suibne is my name.”
Tiberius had been older than Antony, having already dedicated his toga praetexta and bulla to Lares two years prior and graduated to the white toga virilis of manhood. He had come with his family to visit the nearby Servilia family monument and had slipped away during the ritual offering.
Tony is about to fuck it all up.
Stark’s fingers twitch, clawing at the armrest of his chair. “Don’t make him do this. Not… not like this.”
As if he didn’t know.
There’s a responding knock: Y-E-S
“What do you think of taking a day trip to Kho Tao?” Tony says as he tries to show Steve some promotional material on his StarkPad. “We could go scuba diving.”
He’s talking up an attractive blonde from BU when he spots Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Handsome, made to appear even taller with his stylish flat top.
“You don’t have to be mentally ill to need a little help now and then,” Rhodey reassures him. “Just… think about it, Tones. I want you to really consider it.”
Now, Tony can be more open about his preferences.
Paterfamilias: male head of a Roman family.
“I prefer you clean-shaven, my dear Antony,” Tiberius says one day as he cups Antony’s chin. “Though it is hard to see, the stubble is rough against my face.”
He must have said the quiet part out loud because Steve insists, “I have a daughter. I’ll– I’ll take care of her. You don’t have to do anything.”
“That’s what I thought.” Dad turns away. “I’m leaving. Early. Do whatever you have to do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s an ominous pause, long enough for Stark to prompt: “Talk to me, Rhodey.”
“Perhaps you should get a second opinion.” Tony knows he’s had several for his own ailment. “I can get you one when we return stateside. My treat.”
He hadn’t, but that isn’t the point.
Antony steps out of his bed chambers to find a bustle of activity. Iovianus is directing various domestics to gather up the grave offerings of woven flower garlands, violets, wheat, salt, and wine-soaked bread to be ferried to the Staius family mausoleum located outside the city limits. It is a mass exodus of sorts, with the entire city closed for business and emptying out into the surrounding countryside to visit loved ones and long-dead ancestors, the living offering up all matter of goods at monuments beside the main and branching roads in an annual renewal of mourning and familial obligation.
Stefanus puts aside the shield, gently setting it down atop its leather case. “If my intent was ambiguous, then I must be doing it wrong.” Slowly, tentatively so as to allow Antony to escape should he desire, Stefanus gathers him in his arms and pulls him closer. He pauses for a second, looking down at Antony’s widening eyes then brings his lips down over the other man’s, unsure at first then growing in boldness the when Antony embraces him as well and tilts into the kiss.
And there’s really not much to say about that, except: “I will ensure your family receives your earnings. You have my word.” Stefanus raises the tip of his sword to the base of the defeated man’s neck.
He had considered having kids when he was younger, but it had always seemed like a distant possibility, something he’d get around to eventually in the undefined future. He had time; there was no reason to rush…
It is an attractive vase, but very expensive for something Stefanus is so used to seeing as utilitarian in everyday life, containing everything from wine to oil to fruits. “I think it might be overpriced?”
(Pause for laughter.)
“The retiarius, Bacchus,” Stefanus replies. “We trained together as retiarii before I switched classes. He is the closest thing to family I have left, and I… I worry about him every time he enters the arena. Every time, I worry it will be the last, that he will not survive his next bout.”
Dracula is speaking to Tony but staring directly at Steve. “Might I suggest Anthony the Black Widow?”
“I have to.”
They both dress, and Antony calls for late night service for two of wine and various delicacies from pork-stuffed dormice to fillet of ostrich served with a sauce of honey and expensive spices to be delivered to his room.
He thinks of the very first time Bacchus helped him don the toga praetexta, his eyes full of sorrow and resignation. He had told Stefanus that he will endure.
“Yeah, I can still come. I don’t have to be hard for that.” Tony sounds almost resigned at that. “We don’t have to, you know. I don’t need or want a pity fuck. Hell, I never even thought you’d be interested. I thought you were straight.”
“Fits of great distemper and ceaseless frustration. Only a beautiful maiden or lad –young healers of some expertise – wielding the…” –Tony coughs– “golden rod can cleanse such torturous afflictions from the pharaoh’s body and mind, returning him to placidity and good cheer, bringing peace and prosperity to the land.”
And now his father turns his attention to her. “Is it true?”
Steve has a sinking feeling in his gut. What if Bucky hadn’t made it; what if he’s talking to his murderer right now? He can’t betray their location, especially with the ship out of commission. They’re sitting ducks. If it was Steve alone, he’d risk it, but with Stark stuck here as well…
“Come on, I know that look,” Tony says, giving Steve a knowing smile. “Little Stevie has a crush.”
There’s a code of conduct surrounding such matters, but then again Tony couldn’t remember if he bothered to tie a sock on the knob.
Stefanus blocks Bacchus’s blows, the trident glancing off the surface. He spots an opening, hooking the edge of his shield onto the fork of the trident, then dragging it out of Bacchus’s hands entirely to throw it aside into the dust, but Bacchus is on him the next second, bowling him over, reaching for the dagger at his side as he uses his knees and protected left arm to pin a struggling Stefanus to the ground. Stefanus reaches for his sword just out of reach, his fingertips gracing the hilt as Bacchus holds the dagger high, his eyes wild, his breath rapid and erratic.
It is an unusual occurrence. Stefanus reported to the Staius villa for bodyguard duty in the late afternoon or early evening after his training had ceased for the day and collected his per diem every morning before he returned, passing his agreed-upon fee to Priscus and keeping any additional tips Antony had so generously bestowed upon him for his exceptional service. Antony himself had little reason to visit the gladiator barracks, and so Stefanus is elated but curious as to the purpose of his presence and that of the lady beside him. However, the reason quickly becomes apparent when they are led to one of the nicer private rooms off the main barracks. Unlike the small windowless cubicles that made up the majority of the block the gladiators had colloquially termed “the brothel,” this one is larger, used for entertaining more upscale clientele. Inside, there is a bedframe made of woven metal with a feather mattress atop it underneath a large, elevated window for light and ventilation.
And so Steve mulls it over. Six years of silence to make six shirts of nettles.
But she’s already turned heel, making her way towards the upper decks.
“Because he’s straight,” Rhodey supplies.
Tony decides to do the same, drawing his signature character, though with less competency than Steve.
“Tony!”
“I’m not a boy,” Antony protests, though his purple trim and amulet said otherwise.
“Round two?”
“You saw the state of the bodies back there. It’s been at least a year, and the roof is mostly holding. No food. No rain. Any that are left have probably dried up to nothing.”
“Yeah well, I had to get up some time. Sore muscles don’t get better from lack of use.”
“Did he now?” Jarvis looks into the rearview mirror at his charge. “She was a fine woman. I am sorry that she has passed. She was very young.”
Steve looks at him, at the man’s dark expression. “…What?”
“I do not
“Your timing is highly suggestive. I doubt it has escaped your father’s notice.”
Steve considers Stark. Though he can’t see his expression, he knows the man better than to think he’d let it lie. “What are you planning to do?”
“Just humor me a bit, okay Tones?”
“He was a practical one. They all are. You don’t understand because Priscus is your first dominus, and we’re all fated to die in the arena before any of us can ever hope to earn our freedom, but even outside the ludus, out there… they– they ensure to set the purchase price so that you can only afford to buy your freedom after your best years have passed, when you’re too old to be useful, when the cost to feed and clothe you outweighs the worth of your labor. Only then will your freedom be within reach. Then they will take your money and expel you to live a life of poverty with no support in your old age, using your hard-earned coin to supplement the cost of a new slave to take your place. That’s the truth of it. A dominus will only act when there is something in it for him,” Bacchus says, the weight of his words heavy between them. He places a hand on Stefanus’s shoulder, takes in a steadying breath. “So, if you have a chance to leave with Staius while you are still young and strong, use him as your ticket out. Collect what tokens of favor you can to fund your freedom once he grows tired of your charms, and if he is kind, if you can negotiate a better exit from his service…” he can’t even finish the sentence, too overcome with the thought of his upcoming abandonment.
“How about now?” Tony suggests. “I’m not doing anything right now.”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony agrees. “That’s the smart thing to do.”
“Howard.” Mamma collects him in her arms, shielding him from the short-tempered man. “He’s just a child. He can’t turn it off just because you demand it of him.”
“Antony…”
“Tony…” Rogers calls out, even as he remains in position, “Tony, it’s okay.”
“Have you ever heard of jet lag?”
“What? You’re going to make me walk in this heat? I’ll boil.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dracula hisses, waving off his concern.
“Hey Tones,” Rhodey greets him, hand on his shoulder. “You want to… maybe go inside? Maybe fill me in on what’s going on?”
“Look, I grew up in a normal household with two parents who stayed together throughout my childhood. They weren’t the warmest people, but it’s not like they beat me all the time, and yeah, maybe Howard yelled at me and didn’t particularly like me, but believe me, I had it coming sometimes. I was a bratty kid, okay?”
“I could come up with something else,” Stark offers instead with growing excitement. “Perhaps a cloth made of interlocking metal scales for ease of movement and protection.” Steve can already see the wheels turning in the Mandalorian’s mind as he imagines it. “Maybe something a little form-fitting so it won’t get caught on anything.” All the better to show off his ass. “You’ll like it.”
When he hears more guards approaching, he dips into what turns out to be a laundry. That gives him an idea. He picks through the clothing, finding dark green pants, top, and complementary cap that is more to his size, emerging shortly after in a passable disguise, provided he keeps his head down with his gun at the ready, pretended he knew where he was going, and only encountered the others from a distance.
“…Yes.”
“Lady and gentleman, this is what we are after.” He unrolls the copy of the inscription with a flourish, revealing a young maiden – a servant perhaps – presenting the Golden Rod to Ramesses III in the time before it was passed down to his son and eventual heir, Ramesses VIII. Steve, who stands to his immediate left, has already seen it, but Tony cannot resist the pomp. “The Golden Rod of Destiny, last owned by Pharaoh Ramesses VIII. Legend holds that the wielder will be granted untold powers, bringing peace and prosperity to the land…”
He knows Barton killed Natasha, but “You should let up on the poor guy. He’s going through a lot right now.” Not to mention, after what she did, the woman had it coming. He didn’t exactly approve of how Barton had gone about it, but it was understandable at the very least.
Steve is a lot of things, but he would
The man is undeterred. “Yeah, I won’t even have to pull my punches this time,” he replies.
Now isn’t that a disturbing thought? His direct supervisor finds him
“Well, first off, you might want to keep your elbow straight,” Steve says as he steps in to adjust Tony’s stance.
“Is that why you wanted to hurt him? Because he upset you?”
Steve peels off his fingers by bending back the pinky far enough to be worrisome. “Tony, will you–”
“I’m a little ahead; I think I can take off the rest of the semester.”
Suibne peers over his shoulder in suspicion. “Suibne is ainm dom.”
I revised the note on Chapter 1, but in case you haven’t seen it, please take a look at Jayjayverse’s wonderful art piece that inspired this fic located here:
insincere offers to consummate their marriage.
Later, once the cameras have left and the newlyweds have retired to the privacy of a conference room, Tony has the gall to inquire, “What was that back there?”
“We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to,” Steve tells Tony for the second time, his fist wrapped around Tony’s half-hard member. He had been trying to get Tony to rise to the occasion for the last fifteen minutes, and his failure to do so was starting to make him question whether Tony had changed his mind somewhere between the bungalow and their pool villa. “You can back out. No hard feel– I mean, I won’t hold it against you.”
“Bucky, cut it out, okay?” Steve admonishes his friend
“I am fine. You need not worry,” but he picks at his meal.
help from a neutral third party.”
“He may have other qualities beyond the physical,” Erasmus says rather charitably as Suibne’s thin arms swing his trident wildly like a sword, nearly twisting his upper body around in the effort. His opponent, another novicus named Bacchus, easily steps out of the arc of attack then sticks his own blunted trident onto his shoulder when Suibne overcorrects, earning a point in his favor.
“Oh look, another one there be,” says a voice emanating from a bouncing blue light flitting from one end of the circle to the other.
Suibne nods. He had learned from the Southern tribes, the potters who had adopted some of the Roman customs and their language, having dealt in extensive trade with their colonies before the invasion, but he thought it would be easier if… he doesn’t know what he thought. That they’d leave him alone if they thought he couldn’t understand, if he was too dumb to speak their tongue? The notion seems laughable now, though Suibne doesn’t feel like laughing.
“Did you see a fire?”
Stefanus had told Antony, but he had never once imagined the man would think to do anything about it.
“Tell me, Mr. Rogers. Have you ever traveled outside the country?”
“That’s out of my control,” she tries to reason with him, “but I haven’t done anything. I haven’t acted on anything. I thought it would just go away with time.”
“…Sounds like someone might be in need of a ‘healing amulet,’” Steve grouses.
She is quiet at that.
Black is indeed beautiful.
The other boy is more serious than Suibne has ever seen him as he helps him fold the toga in the fashion of the freeborn, with the excess at one end flung over his shoulder. He completes the look with the pendant, but when Suibne goes to remove it, the other boy stays his hand.
“Your father will be ill-pleased should you flaunt your…
“Careful, that’s my future wife you’re putting your mitts on,” Pinky pipes up.
Stark must step aside at the not-so-subtle threat because the table moves once again. Steve’s hand fumbles for his lightsaber, but it falls into the space between his hip and the hull, settling somewhere underneath him where he cannot reach.
It had been bad, downright ugly, and highly embarrassing. And so first thing in the morning, after he pieces what little he recollects together into a semi-coherent picture, Tony scrounges through his trash for honeybear’s list and calls the first shrink at the top, setting up an introductory session for the following week.
“Not gonna happen.”
The consequences are immediate. One second, Dracula is sitting across from Steve, annoyed but otherwise harmless, and the next, he has pounced on him, his long fingernails fisted in Steve’s shirt, scratching the skin underneath, and teeth hovering over his neck. He screams when he spots the silver chain Tony had given Steve to wear under his shirt, and it is only rage that keeps him from flying off at the sight as he tries to work his way around the necklace without burning himself too badly.
“What do you mean we’ll have to share?!” Tony rages at the stoic man in charge of reservations.
“Remind me: How old are you again? Fifteen going on fifty?”
“This is Tony. My mom works for his parents,” Steve replies.
Steve wets his lips. “Do you believe… well, do you think there are survivors like me?” It’s something that had been plaguing him for days. He’d felt their deaths, thousands of Jedi disappearing abruptly across the Galaxy, the void they left behind peppering across the known worlds, like miniature black holes of conspicuous nothingness littering the star-ways. Steve had survived, but only because he happened to be in the outer rim – only because Master Phillips did everything he could to ensure his survival – and even then, it had been a near thing.
Stefanus purses his lips. He raises his shield. “Again.”
“…Did you seriously just ‘language’ me?”
He can see Antony thinking back to his visit to the ludus as he tries to identify the gladiator in question. “Is it that gladiator with the long hair? Your training partner, the one you were sparring with when I came to see you at the ludus?”
“Go back to MIT, and we’ll never find out what I am willing to do to ensure your future. Everybody wins.”
Tony straightens his suit, picks off a speck of lint on his sleeve, and rotates the bouquet 27.2 degrees to ensure optimal viewing angle from the door. Each of the flowers are perfect, hand-picked by his personal florist for freshness and superior symmetry, but some of the blooms are slightly larger, and he would prefer they be the focal point of the arrangement when he picks up his date for the Maria Stark Foundation Charity Gala.
“I did not know…” Antony tries to defend himself, but Stefanus is not having it.
In the two years they had dated, Steve had never met the man, the myth, the legend, but this eventuality had been anything but a surprise. Steve had known about Tony’s infamous father from the very beginning, the association rather obvious when one has “Anthony, son of Dracula” printed on his S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued work badge. Steve had initially thought it was just a name – perhaps the man had even lost a bet and had to legally change it to the unfortunate moniker – but he had quickly come to understand that Tony’s (adoptive) father is literally the iconic centuries-old vampire. Even Agent Coulson had warned him to steer clear of the pretty brunette R&D director if he was fond of breathing.
“See, you’re a natural,” Tony encourages him without a hint of sarcasm. “Now for a dip.”
“People will talk.”
It’s important that Tony doesn’t forget, doesn’t lose himself, when he is writhing under Steve an hour later, after they’ve eaten and their dishes are hastily abandoned in the sink to soak.
“That is correct. Largely, we create families by adopting foundlings and passing on our traditions, but we can have romantic liaisons if that’s what you’re asking.”
Tony surfaces then dislodges his snorkel. “You’re scaring away all the fish.”
He shakes his limbs out and squares up to go against the next gladiator.
The man – no, the kid – is young and likely unfamiliar with that mode of handwriting.  Tony had ordered FFFAFA, but with the way Steve had connected the letters, the f’s leading into the a’s had looked like e’s to a kid who had never had to read cursive, and the a’s themselves with their curly swishes through the middle had looked like fancy zeroes, turning what should have been snow white into a color akin to tutu pink.
Stark is about to tell Rhodey he’s being ridiculous – Jedi aren’t magic – but he stops himself. Steve had very recently proven he could do a lot of things Stark had previously thought impossible. Both men turn slowly to stare at Steve, who simply huffs and crosses his arms.
Antony can only laugh. “Julia was a gift,” but Stefanus can tell he is pleased nonetheless at the turn of events.
He peers over at the family portrait on the mantle, raises his glass in mock toast and drains the remainder in one go.
But Servilius is on a roll. “It’s been eight years. You got to let it go, my dear Antony.”
“For you and your ‘friend’… for one of you to find a man who would love you, cherish you, a man rich enough and weak enough to buy and free you both from Priscus so you can be together?” He turns away, furiously tearing off his towel to wrap a toga around himself.
That just won’t do.
Steve looks at his arms and around his back, then gives Tony a once-over, focusing on his legs where the zombies had almost gotten him. “No, I think we’re fine.”
“Yes.”
He tilts his gaze to regard the figure, trying to imagine the alternate orientation. “W.”
“So, Mr. Stevens, what brings you here today?”
“Do you have a problem with my line of work?” Tony inquires, tapping a pointed finger on the hieroglyph depicting the admittedly-phallic artifact. “The Golden Rod is the find of the century, and if stories of its healing properties prove accurate…”
Tony is the first to speak. “Was that–”
Steve breaks their kiss, his forehead leaning against Tony’s. “Wait, stop,” he pleads, his hips shying away. “Stop.”
Tony steps aside with an overexaggerated flourish. “After you, Cap.”
It takes a lot to render
All in all, Steve gets the distinct impression that not only is his presence unwanted, but Dracula dislikes him entirely on principle.
“…Was that her name?” Tony snaps his fingers. “She looked like a Cindy. But yeah, she liked me. I could tell.”
“I’m not the one who needs to eat six times a day,” he shouts instead.
He continues on, passing an unfortunate
“So… have you thought about my offer from the other day?”
I had to split the last chapter in two, because it got very VERY long. I also updated the tags to include racism. Tony meets Rhodey spring semester of his freshman year at MIT (circa early 1986). In late 1986, there was a study published about black student experience at MIT based on surveys of alumni who attended the university from 1969 to 1985. Many participants said they felt isolated and experienced cultural barriers with white students, and a minority (15%) experienced discrimination from classmates and white faculty (there apparently was a suggestion that they ‘go somewhere and do things you people can do’).
By the time Tony mostly sobers up an hour later, he’s absolutely mortified. “I’m so sorry,” he repeats for what has to be the twentieth time.
“Sounds like a big problem,” Steve observes.
Tony’s chest begins to constrict painfully, ominously.
Steve retrieves his undershirt, pulling it over his head, then bends down to pick up his button-up. “I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” he confesses, threading his arms through the sleeves before going to work on the fasteners.
Now that… that is useful information. He wonders about the source of such graffito. Is it from a rival seeking to undermine the gladiator’s masculinity, a lover perhaps, or even a customer?
What if Stefanus is comically small and unable to complete the deed? His mind wanders to the graffito he had seen that morning:
“He didn’t know before, but he’ll stay now, Mamma,” Tony says, but the look on her face is anything but reassuring, “right?”
“There you are, Antony,” Iovianus says, hurrying him along. “Come, come, you should be at the very front of the procession.”
And worse yet, based on his abysmal dating record as of late, the father can only be one alpha.
“It’s
“Still nothing?” Stark says, his gleaming helmet leaning in to observe Steve.
Steve is suddenly angry, aggressively pointing out Tony’s window. “You know what’s going on out there? Men are dying out there doing what you’re doing.”
And now Stefanus looks surprised as he touches Antony as well, his fingers pressing over Antony’s own, threatening to penetrate him dry.
Is that something a man congratulates another man for? Like ‘Hey, congrats on your dick being a certified weapon of mass destruction; I hope Steve’s ass survived the battering ram that is a night with you even if his furniture did not’? It seemed at once impressive and also way too much information.
“It’s about Dr. Pym, and you know… his
Tony’s mouth is a hard, thin line. “If the thought of sleeping next to a man is enough to throw you off your game, then you should have said something. I’m sure Thor could have protected me just fine. Hell, send Jan. Our targets would probably underestimate her.”
She relaxes, and Steve wonders if she would have had the strength and resolve to do what needed to be done. If not her, would Bucky…
As if Tony didn’t already have enough problems, how is he going to explain how he tried to get over his crush on Steve by sleeping with a string of doppelgangers?
“M,” Steve replies easily.
It is an unmitigated disaster, worse than that time in the eighties when Tony had thought gold finishes were the wave of the future and carpeting in the bathroom was in any way acceptable. That had been bad enough, but now, everything in his most-recent bathroom remodel, from the tile to the counters down to the toilet and matching tub is some variation of bright Pepto-Bismol pink instead of the far more understated snow white he had ordered.
protest Tony will later deny.
Tony exhales in relief.
The morning light is grey, the air heavy with dew that settles on the stones of the courtyard, making them slippery. But it is no matter to the lone figures standing in its center: an instructor and a Jedi Initiate six months shy of undergoing the first round of trials. The instructor taps the boy’s knee with his staff, nudging it an inch over into the correct position.
“You’re on.” Clint shakes her hand. “They don’t even like each other. Easiest twenty bucks I’ve ever made.”
So Steve runs. He disappears into the treeline, leaping over root and under branches, cutting a zig-zag path through the underbrush. He wipes his blurry eyes on his sleeve to clear up his vision, never pausing in his retreat.
“Watch the ground,” Steve tells him. “Zombies can’t climb.”
Stefanus shifts, turning to face Antony as his hands find his chin, his wet cheeks. “Then let me take care of you,” he says as he gently kisses the corner of his mouth. “Let me take care of you, Antony.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“You must try the wine; it is simply delightful,” Antony gushes, his grip on his cup loose and wobbly.
one?” Not that Tony would be opposed to a do-over, if Steve wanted to.
Tony accepts the gift, his fingers still shaky, so Steve grabs the box instead before it can slip out of his slack grip. “Thanks, Sam,” he says on Tony’s behalf. “I think… I think we should probably uh… regroup and collect the rest of the supplies together.”
“I know you know,” Tony lies. “I’m just saying it so it’s out there. None of that unspoken crap, because we’re men, and men don’t do that.”
“I didn’t order this.”
Steve’s vision narrows; he feels dizzy, and there’s suddenly not enough air, and Tony? Tony is still talking. Why is he still talking?
A lump of terror rises in Antony’s throat like black bile. “You cannot lose.”
When Antony takes his seat beside Tiberius, the man casually places an arm around his shoulder, drawing him close. The action inspires Antony’s face to burn and his stomach to flutter in a way that isn’t unpleasant.
Steve tugs at his sleeve, a touch self-conscious to be dressed in such loud colors after a lifetime of wearing only neutrals. “I could stay on the ship,” he offers.
“I don’t know. An adult. Twenty-five maybe?” Twenty-five seemed old enough to know what you’re doing but not too old to think better of it.
Tony had meant to retire.
“Please,” Stark begs, his voice on the verge of breaking, even as he doesn’t break his stride. “Please.”
The man is whistling an ambling tune Clint doesn’t recognize as he stands at the stove flipping the last of a stack of pancakes. “Sure did.”
“The man sounded very motivated over the phone. Spirited. I thought it would be a good match.”
“If you hang tight, maybe I can swing by in a couple days, but it’s crazy here, man. You know that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine guy?”
Cap is lucky Tony showed up at all. By Tony’s reckoning, he had earned his minor mental breakdown, and he could inflict it on Cap if he felt like it, but involving Cap in his freak-out meant he’d have to involve the man in other ways as well, possibly for the rest of his life, and Tony isn’t quite sure he is ready to face that particular outcome just yet.
“You okay?” he had asked.
Steve suddenly deflates, his expression flummoxed at the unexpected offer. “…What?”
But Bacchus doesn’t let up. “When was the last time you had sex you’ve desired?” He ignores Stefanus’s glare. “A man shouldn’t die before experiencing the first blooms of love…”
“We heard–” she looks at the bodies strewn around them, her hand tightening around the machete in her grasp. “Any bites?” she asks, her voice tense, business-like.
“I desire your full heart.”
Too late to back out now.
“Would you like to be?”
Pinky leans forward. “Did she use her tongue?”
It is also frustrating.
Steve almost wishes the arms dealers would make their move already so he can bag them and get the annulment he so desperately desires because the longer Tony and he have to keep up this charade, the higher the chance that one of them isn’t going to survive the fallout.
Auctoratus: A gladiator who was originally free and sold himself to the ludus.
Antony proves to be a generous tipper as well, gifting Stefanus what he had called a ‘small token of his appreciation for a night well spent.’ It’s double what he must have paid Priscus for the privilege of the night, and Stefanus doesn’t disclose his windfall to anyone, adding the sum to his winner’s purse for safekeeping.
“You’re a big phoney, Steve Rogers, and I don’t like phonies,” Tony declares.
“What about my suit?”
“You look amazing, honey,” Tony says, squeezing Steve’s hand in his own.
“Or maybe the Easter Bunny? The rabbit that shits colorful eggs we’re expected to collect and ingest.”
“You move around too much.”
Tony never forgives Howard for any of it.
They sit in silence yet again until Steve feels it, another sharp jab to his side.
Tony spends the next two years shuffling between MIT and Stark Mansion in Manhattan, between his college life with Rhodey and home life with Steve. He comes to understand what Steve meant all those years ago, about needing to straddle two worlds and learning how to show different facets of yourself under varying circumstances. He thinks he is the best, most authentic version of himself when he is with Steve or Rhodey, a fact he mentions to honeybear one night in the man’s off-campus apartment when they’re both high and he’s feeling acutely nostalgic.
“It’s a nice amphora, and the painting is… well, it’s something else.”
Steve hears a ruckus outside as Stark fires up the engines and launches his craft at a steep incline. Unsecured, Steve nearly rolls into the cargo hold, grabbing onto an errant strap along the side to keep from falling entirely, the table slides across the floor and would have taken him out if not for the body of the dead stormtrooper wedged between them.
He stands corrected.
“Steve,” Tony stops him. “I get it. You should never have to compromise on something like that. You have boundaries, and only a complete asshole would try to coerce you into making an exception.”
“Stefanus is not Tiberius,” Antony stubbornly insists. “He is not freeborn–”
“I’m glad to hear it.”
“And now you know better. So what if I fuck men too? What are you going to do about it, huh?” Tony can suffer a lot of shitty things in his life; Steve’s reproach is not one of them. “Gonna sell the story to Fortune 500 or the National Enquirer? Don’t bother; I’m already a disappointment to the Board.” He can’t fill his father’s shoes. They’re too stiff, too square, and he believes he’ll never convincingly pull off a leather dress shoe with all the certainty of his twenty-one years.
Under the thrall of a new relationship and his own inexperience, Antony quickly gets in over his head.
Antony doesn’t know what to say about that, except: “And now you’re both free.”
“Well, I do.”
. Things didn’t work out with Jan? So what? No one gets it right the first time out; some don’t get it right the first fifty times, but you get up, have an open mind, and try and try again until you find something that works. You… you have a clean bill of health – the perfect body, really – and all the time in the world to make the most of it, and you have the audacity to be unhappy about it,” Tony says, quietly furious. “I’m
This chapter is from Tony’s POV and will delve a little bit into Tony’s childhood. In stark contrast to what happened with slave children (slaves were often sold naked and considered available for sex at young ages), Roman attitudes towards the freeborn were very much “Think of the Children.” Freeborn boys and girls wore a purple-bordered garment, the toga praetexta, and protective amulets (the penis-shaped bulla for boys or the crescent-moon-shaped lunula for girls), which indicated their status. Adults could not use obscene language in front of children wearing the toga praetexta, and having sex with them was a capital offence (though there is some indication that some men found the toga praetexta alluring, like jail bait today). When boys reached 15-16, they went through a ceremony where they took off the toga praetexta, put on the transitional tunica recta, then dedicated both the toga praetexta and their bulla to Lares, the household gods of the family. They then don the white toga virillis (toga of manhood). This ceremony usually happened during Liberalia in mid-March. Young men would commonly hire a prostitute as their first sexual experience before they were married at later ages. (Young women would be expected to remain virginal until their first marriage, though there was no stigma with divorce or being married multiple times.)
“And I do not.” Tiberius drops his chin, turning away entirely. “Did you not hear what I said? It is uncomfortable for me. I would like to continue kissing you, but if you cannot do this one little thing–”
Tony thins his eyes at his friend. “…Really?” he deadpans.
It had started out small. They’re in the lobby the morning after when Steve gets the distinct sensation that people are staring. They’re not the arms dealers he and Tony are after, as Steve can hear snippets of whispered conversations.
“I wouldn’t try to cheat my best customer, not for a slave discounted so steeply,” the slaver reasons. “He doesn’t have the constitution of your usual purchase, but what he lacks in stamina, he makes up for in… other areas, as you can see.” Suibne doesn’t like the sound of that. “And if he doesn’t serve well in that capacity, I’m sure he’d make a fine r
“They’re beautiful, Tony,” Steve says, accepting the bouquet. “You really shouldn’t have.”
“My pen name. It is quite common in my field. My real name is Pepper, Pepper Potts, but I go by Frank Finley professionally.” She accepts the handshake with a firm grasp of her own.
“Fuck you,” Antony says as he leaves Tiberius pained and breathless on the floor, grasping his sorry cock with both hands.
“Nuclear. Missiles. Wrong. Hands.”
He scoffs, weary of their game. “I don’t know why I bothered.”
“Tuberculosis?” he guesses.
,” Steve protests.
Steve stands silently beside him, taking in the sight. Naturally, Tony assumes they’re both are on the same page, that his boyfriend is similarly shocked, the assault on his eyes too great for words, until Steve whistles low. “It turned out real nice, Tony,” he says, a spring in his step as he ventures further inside. “And have you seen the size of this tub? You think we could both fit at the same time?” Tony can practically hear the man’s brow waggling at the suggestion.
“He doesn’t… it doesn’t hurt when I’m with him. I don’t feel brought low by the experience.”
“That’s not what you said last night.”
Contrary to Tony’s expectations, he finds himself liking Steve. The other boy may be stubborn, his imagination lacking a certain sense of narrative cohesion, but he is fun and compassionate and willing to entertain Tony’s flights of fancy, so really he’s the best friend Tony has ever had.
Steve seems to hesitate, then: “Just… good luck at MIT. Study, but don’t forget to have fun, okay?” he says, a touch awkwardly. He never was a fan of goodbyes.
Bacchus nods, and with that, he steps out of the relative safety of the hypogeum, his stride confident and sure-footed, towards an uncertain fate.
But Antony steps between them, drawing the man’s attention if not his ire. “Why? Do you need advice on how to please a partner? Though considering your past performance, maybe you are in dire need of a lesson or three.”
The man finally lies down, his body too stiff to be comfortable, so Antony curls into him, kissing his shoulder with his arm and leg draped over Stefanus until the man finally relaxes.
He hopes Stefanus is sane at the very least, and if he is not… well, the damage will be minimal considering the man’s station, the wound likely constrained to Antony’s pride to have once again let his cock hamper his common sense.
“Meet the Mark LIII. It’s essentially a drone with a VR holographic interface that I control from the safety of… anywhere but the actual battle. Once I get the bugs out, it will have near instantaneous bidirectional feedback, allowing me to still provide real-time combat and air support while minimizing personal risk.”
“…Tony needs to find another emotional support animal?” Granted, the unicorn had been a logistical adjustment in all their classes based on sheer size alone, but Tony had insisted the creature’s separation anxiety was so bad that he couldn’t in good conscience leave it in the stables. The last time he had tried had led to more than a little horn-based property damage. Mr. Fury almost got gored through his remaining good eye trying to reign it in.
like when they were kids.
Dracula lifts his hips up, flipping over Steve who hangs on even as he ends up under the vampire’s bulk.
He has a point, and so the man accepts contributions from both.
“I’d– I…” Steve sucks in a breath, visibly gathering his courage. “I’d like that.”
Clint raises a brow as Stark attempts to speak in muffled tones before prying off Steve’s fingers. “We were not. Steve made a bet that he could touch the vaulted ceiling in his room, and he had tried to use the bed as a trampoline to reach it.”
Tony, predictably, doesn’t back down. “Make me.”
The rest of dinner passes uneventfully with minimal conversation, mostly directed towards Tony who continues to run interference between the two.
Now Steve looks miffed. “I never said I was a virgin.”
Steve looks murderous, but he imitates Hodge, standing at attention as directed. Still, he can’t help but scowl instead of adopting the older boy’s more neutral expression. He can practically feel the waves of self-satisfaction radiating off Hodge, and he bristles at the notion that the boy might have gotten away with testing Steve.
Rabirius cants his head to the side. “What did you do?”
Tony decides to focus on the part of the apartment that does look more or less permanent. “At least you have a real bed, winghead. It sure looks comfortable.”
“Huh. And here I thought you were smarter than that.”
But then Steve covers Stark’s hand with his own, his thumb worrying the space between Stark’s thumb and index. “I can get you something for that in a bit.”
They lead him to the main house to a private bedroom with walls decorated in erotic scenes either painted or inlaid directly into the stone. Suibne blushes at a particularly explicit mosaic featuring three men in a rather compromising position.
“…I’m fine,” Steve says, looking away from Tony, towards the band as his face burns.
Steve eyes Captain America, suspended within the billowy softness of a jumbo cotton ball. “Hey… What if his best friend is named Bucky, who he’s sad about leaving behind in the past?” he says as an aside, utterly breaking character.
“Do not purchase it on my account. I–”
It happens again.
“Who is it, Tony? Who do I have to help you seduce?”
“What’s that?” Steve asks, pointing to the flashing notification in the corner.
This time, Dracula accepts.
“I do,” Steve admits, “and when that happens, I know I can always count on Iron Man – on you – to figure it out for the rest of us.”
“What happened to Mr. Stark?”
“Which is impossible in her presence,” Tony finishes. “Some things never change.”
“Here.” He reaches between his own legs, caressing the entrance of his ass, teasing his own hole with a slight dip of his fingertips. “I would like you here.”
The look on the man’s face is almost worth the two-hour refresher course on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s sexual harassment policy.
“You may speak again, Captain. Let Iron Man know what a good job he’s doing and maybe he won’t be so glum, yeah?”
In retrospect, riling up Captain America is much easier than it should have been, based on the way Howard always talked about the man with a healthy dose of admiration and more than a little deference as he praised his leadership, bravery, and levelheadedness, saying how Captain America always seemed to make the right decisions even in the midst of combat armed only with a shield. Then again, Aunt Peggy had always said Rogers was an unusually scrappy fella.
Bucky had fallen ill with a pox and had been secluded from the others for days now. Occasionally, the pox had swept through the Brookland Home for Boys and taken one in twenty as well as deafened an additional two. So, realistically, the odds were good for Bucky to pull through unharmed but still too low for Steve’s comfort.
Stefanus is at a loss for words. There could be an innocent explanation, considering his rather physical occupation. They could conceivably be from training, a few good hits delivered by a blunted sword, but when Antony gently turns his hip to examine the bruises further, he sees the angry bite mark on his ass with a much more obvious provenance.
Stark is quiet at that. Steve thinks he’s won (with his prize being blessed silence), but the man again opens his mouth. “…It is the price of being a warrior. The others, the ones left on Mandalore… it’s different for them. They gave up the old ways of our people, but they’re vulnerable without the beskar. Threw us all out – all their warriors – exiled us to Concordia when we refused to give it up. It made Mandalore weak, weak enough to be invaded and occupied.”
Had Bacchus been lying about his chances this whole time? In a way, it made sense. Bacchus was always trying to get him to spend his earnings on prostitutes and drink, things he could enjoy in the present without an eye towards a future he didn’t have the heart to tell him was a fantasy. If Bacchus had said something in the interim, if Stefanus had known…
freed humanity from struggle, from conflict and pain, from the burden of choice. Look at the world around you and tell me it’s not worse now that I’m in here. I was a god – your god – but I didn’t let you suffer in the wilderness, alone, without guidance. So tell me truthfully: did you and your little friends really improve anything, by taking me out of the equation?”
“We can take things slow.” Tony never has, but he can figure it out. For Steve.
Priscus holds up a hand to assure him. “Fear not, Staius. I do not disclose the identity of any who come seeking…
“Unlikely.”
“If you can’t get it up, I could always get Bruce in here. The Hulk could probably get the job done right.” Tony is blasé, cultivating a nonchalance calculated to piss off the man.
And true to his word, Stefanus saves every copper As he earns, earmarking them towards his and Bacchus’s freedom, foregoing the pleasures of the prostitutes that visited the barracks in favor of his own left hand despite Bacchus’s frequent insistence that he should find some comfort outside their daily grind. Stefanus is sorely tempted sure, but his earnings always seem low in comparison to his purchase price as it is, though he figures that once he starts winning in the arena, the gap will decrease.
Perhaps he should sleep outside on the reclining lawn chair, leaving Tony to his own devices. If bandits arrive to kidnap him in the night, Steve will still be close enough to spring into action.
It is certainly a risk.
Tony snorts. “Like you’re one to talk.”
“…Always have to do everything the hard way, don’t you?”
“Steve,” he corrects him. “Call me Steve.”
“Yeah, did you think I was kidding when I said I’ve fought vampires before?”
“Well, you know what they say. Nature has a way of balancing things out. The big beefy ones are always dumbasses. Their height and muscles compensate for their severe lack of brain power.” And if Tony is including Bucky in that assessment, he’s not going to say it overtly, but Steve is smart. He’ll pick up on the slight and then make some half-hearted remark in his friend’s defense.
(Well, joke’s on them; Tony happened to like DUM-E.)
“I… I don’t want–”
“Two heartbeats, sir, though I would advise further medical attention.”
“Tony!” Steve cries out again, his hand now on his dick, sliding his foreskin up and down over his shaft. “Tony, I’m– I’m so close.”
So from then on, Tony sticks to women and alcohol. It’s easier that way, and with a clean nose, he won’t have to suffer the worried glances of Steve when he stumbles home at an obscenely late hour smelling of sex and scotch.
“Tony!”
So Tony does.
“Come on, Rogers. Why don’t you loosen up a bit? Prohibition has been over for six years already, and even if it wasn’t, international waters. Arbitrary American laws hold no sway here,” Tony gently cajoles him as he takes a sip of his first scotch. “Anything you’d like. On me. I started a tab, and I aim to make the most of it.”
And so, they talk about other things, about how Tony has been doing since the funeral – Tony says he’s been doing fine, just peachy; in other words, he lies – and about Rhodey’s job as an officer in the Air Force. There’s a lot of potential for upward mobility, and he believes he’s really found his calling in public service. Tony is happy for him. Rhodey would have been miserable working at Oscorp or SI; he’s sure of it. There’s also a new woman in his life, a fellow pilot named Carol, who seems promising, and maybe Tony will get to meet her for Christmas if the relationship lasts.
They each pick up a garden hoe, using them as rams to carefully bat and dislodge the slats from the door – the untreated wood splintering easily from exposure and the rain that must have streamed down the side in the winter months now that the canopy has been compromised – until they’re in. The air is still and stale, the interior deathly silent, almost eerily so.
“Don’t forget to call, shellhead,” Steve tells him on the day Tony is due to ship out. He doesn’t hug him goodbye. They’re fifteen now, almost men or so they think.
Rhodey would be a great asset to their projects for the Department of the Defense, maybe not anything high security considering his age and inexperience, but over time–
“I can think of one or two activities.” He pulls lightly at Steve’s belt. “Only to pass the time of course, if you’re game.”
“Steve–”
“Who’s Abercrombie & Fitch here?”
As (plural Asses): Copper base unit coin
“Sorry,” he says, because he feels an apology is owed. Steve had wanted to take things slow, and this is not most people’s definition of slow.
Stark doesn’t hand over the radio, nudging it behind him. “If they find us, they’ll kill us both.”
Tony had almost forgotten. “You know what they say: Go big or go home,” he says flippantly.
“So much so that he empties his pockets in addition to his balls for her.”
“I’ll be sixteen in three months.”
“Okay, fine. Slavedriver.”
– “I care for you a great deal.”
“Purple Man,” Stark addresses him from the free side of the plexiglass. Imprisoned in his white hermetically-sealed containment chamber, Purple Man isn’t quite the threat he was, but Stark is wary, a haunted look behind his brown eyes accentuated by dark circles his concealer can’t quite cover.
“Bodyguards are not uncommon, but the public need not be privy to
“Hey… hey there,” Steve murmurs, softly shushing as Tony begins to cry. “It’s okay; it’s okay, Tony. I’m okay; you’re okay.” He looks down at the grinder. “We can find you a new one.”
Master Phillips gives up. He cannot win, not against a man so seemingly reasonable yet surprisingly stubborn. “I hope you know what you’re doing, Master Erskine.”
“Do you think it’s wise to–”
Dracula pushes his chair back, allowing himself room to stand should the occasion call for it. “And what if it is?”
Antony is surprised at the man’s fury, but despite his ire, he doesn’t even try to hide his deeds. “I did what I had to to protect you.” He will never apologize for protecting Stefanus. Never.
Fortunatus animula dulcis, perfututor = Fortunatus, you sweet soul, you mega-fucker.
What is the point of it all if he was always going to end up here, having accomplished nothing?
“And then the villain takes off his person mask, and he’s like… I don’t know, a bloody skull underneath.” Because Nazis don’t deserve skin, apparently.
“I said get off!” Tony’s leg shoots back as he turns, nearly kicking Steve in the groin in the process and scrambling to the other side of the bed, reflexively assuming a defensive pose.
Steve bows his head. “I beg your pardon on their behalf as well as mine. The fault is entirely our own,” he says, allowing genuine sorrow to filter through his voice. “If you could be so kind as to allow us leave, we will exit your presence with our deepest apologies.”
“…What?”
Steve sneaks around the perimeter, ducking around blind spots created by large crates (while helping himself to a machine gun from the pile) and carefully timing the guards’ movements to bypass their notice, slowly making his way towards the center before slipping inside. He then moves carefully down the corridor, hiding in empty rooms and checking around corners to avoid enemy combatants. He can’t afford to go in with guns a-blazing, not when he hasn’t located Tony.
Tony side-eyes Cap’s plaid shirt and high-waisted olive khaki ensemble. “That outfit come with a prescription for Viagra, old man?”
“Some of this stuff is sensitive tech,” Steve points out.
“And I wanted her, too. With you,” Steve adds. “It’s always been you, Tony.”
Its source turns out to be a small youngling, a boy of approximately six. Short and nearly skin and bones, he doesn’t stand a chance against the larger child he is pitted against. Still, he holds his arms up in an untrained attack formation.
“You know you love me.”
“I think Hadrianus cares not what I do, so long as the public excuse passes muster,” Antony deadpans. His father only cared about appearances, about power and fortune, not who his son happened to bed for the night behind closed doors. “Gladiators are still acceptable bodyguards these days, are they not?”
“You’re pretending to be something you’re not.”
“You’ll die if I don’t,” he tries to reason. First Master Erskine, then Master Phillips, and now Stark himself? Steve can’t lose another person. He can’t. “I can help you.”
“That’s cheating!” Tony protests.
. His weakness is
Nat squints her eyes at their team leader, her gaze even and calculating. “Twenty bucks says it’s Cap.”
Steve must be drunk because he only continues, “Don’t get me wrong. Dames can be quite nice, but nothing beats a partner who can really throw their weight around.”
. His advisors probably got it for him so he’d be less uptight and go easy on the capital punishment. I cannot be the only one who sees it.”
Tony looks over his shoulder past the gantry to find Cap frozen in the lab’s entrance.
“And I can see that your face remains as clean as a baby’s bottom, while my beard is growing in quite nicely.”
“…Let’s just go to bed. We’ll drive back in the morning,” Tony suggests, feeling more disappointed than he should. It’s not like he didn’t know there wasn’t a chance Steve would react poorly to even the barest whiff of homosexuality. It wasn’t uncommon, even among people who were otherwise decent folk.
Rhodey holds out a hand to Steve, who accepts. “Tony’s told me so much about you.”
There’s a knock on the door, just on the too-insistent side of polite. “Tony, are you in there?”
Antony spins around. “You do understand that if you were free, we could not be together, at least not publicly,” he says, his tone wounded.
And it was all Antony’s fault. If he hadn’t favored him, if he had simply purchased him outright before Hadrianus could finalize the contract, then Stefanus would have been safe.
“They are Gardenias, sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. informs him rather unhelpfully from above. “I believe they signify secret love.”
Steve is crouched low in the tree line just outside enemy base. He peers at the building where his new buddy Sergei had said they were keeping Tony. He had even drawn him a poorly-rendered map in exchange for keeping his right hand mostly intact. He had then knocked him out and kept him and his unconscious buddies securely tied up and stowed away in the bathroom of their pool villa for safekeeping, leaving a do-not-disturb sign on the door handle to prevent housekeeping from finding and freeing their guests.
Fat chance of that happening. Steve rarely shies from what is difficult. He has plans damn it, plans that require he meet Dracula, look him square in the eye, and–
“One day, but not today,” Bacchus clarifies.
When Stark emerges ten minutes later, he hands a twisted, cracked cup holder to Steve. “We might need more of these,” he says before stalking off towards a junk heap in the distance.
When Steve wakes in the morning, the man at his back is gone. He turns, his hands searching the bed beside him all the way to the edge to ensure Stark’s absence before he undoes his blindfold. He blinks against the harsh morning light until his vision adjusts, and he locates his clothes folded neatly on a nearby alcove.
Bucky sighs. “Not this again.”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers, I expect to see you both back tomorrow after class,” he states sternly, before returning to his desk pack up for the day.
“Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off; what are you?”
Well now, that’s just unfair.
“I’ll believe
“It doesn’t count if you had to pay for it,” Bucky reminds him, though Pinky kicks him for his trouble. He seems really interested in the answer.
It is a normal occurrence for Tony. Some kids get to go to science camp for the summer, but in his family, it’s his father that leaves. It’s easier in a way when it’s just the four of them: Tony and Mamma, Jarvis and Ana. His father isn’t an easy man – “Children should be seen and not heard” – but his absence means Tony doesn’t have to sit up quite as straight at the dinner table or justify how he has spends his free time after school. Mamma will even let him choose what they have for dinner and often talks to him about his interests.
Stefanus’s head lolls to the center, his eyes focusing on Antony’s concerned face. “Why do you hesitate?” he asks. “You demand I submit, and I cannot stop you from taking anything you desire.”
“I’m sorry, shellhead,” and Steve does sound regretful, “but I think this is something I’m going to have to do by myself. I’ve got to stand on my own two feet eventually.”
Until Steve kissed him one day after returning from a particularly rough mission.
“You’re such a flirt. Keep at it; flattery will get you everywhere.”
“If the Oxford fits–”
Tony tosses the shirt back at him, but Steve only lets it fall to the side.
“I– I understand.”
“Then show me,” he points to his tin mug balanced on a fallen tree across from them. “Bring me that cup with your special Jedi mind powers.”
“Don’t see how it’s any of their business what happens between two consenting adults.” Tony interlaces their fingers, rubbing circles into the spot between Cap’s thumb and index. “You mentioned sparring, but I think it might work better without the suit.”
“’Sides, feeling’s mutual. Not like I’d be interested in ‘em anyway,” Steve mumbles.
There is really only one explanation for the Mandalorian’s behavior.
“I know that, but–”
,” Steve bellows. “I am nothing without Captain America. Don’t you understand? Gail and I were supposed to get married, have a gaggle of kids that would keep my parents company in their old age. And my brother? Dougie was only fifteen last I saw him; I never got to see him grow into a man before he was gone, too. I was supposed to come back and live a regular life with people I knew and loved, but I’m going to outlive them all!” He places his hands on his temples, sweeping them back to run his fingers through his hair. “I tried with Jan, but it didn’t work, because I’m too old. I couldn’t connect with her. I don’t understand anything in this damn future, and yet, I will be forced to watch this pass as well. Captain America was only supposed to be a temporary solution to a short-term problem with an end date, but now he’s all I got. He’s the only thing in my life that has and will endure. A life like mine… long and unending… it’s a curse.”
“Goddamnit, son. I said–”
“Yeah. It happens. Growth spurt,” Steve says, thoroughly amused. “I guess it all happened at once, huh?”
“And remain silent for the term of six years after said agreement,” the second faerie finishes, bounding ahead of the first. “If you fail in either task, you will share in their fate.”
“Can you do that from the beach? I haven’t had a vacation in months.”
That seems to shake the man out of his stupor. “Yes!”
Suibne unfolds the cloth, but it proves too long and voluminous for him to discern how one is supposed to wear it without having it drag along the floor as a tripping hazard. He tries wearing it like a towel and then draping it over his head like a scarf or blanket, wishing for the simplicity of a tunic instead. He’s trapped under the middle of the damn thing when he feels someone pull it off. He’s about to scowl at the intrusion but stops at the look on Bacchus’s face.
Of course, nothing can ever come of it. Not only is Steve so painfully, so obviously straight, but he is one of Tony’s closest friends, and Tony would rather have Steve in his life as a friend than scare him away with what will soon prove to be a passing fancy.
“You’re not alone anymore. We’re a team. We need you.”
Steve’s heated gaze always had a way of stirring Tony’s libido. Still–
“I saw it on late-night TV. People kiss with their tongues, I swear!”
“I do not believe he considers it a waste of time to ensure your speedy return to your studies.”
“I think you might find guarding my body easier from inside my bed chambers,” he says, his tone low, seductive.
And so Tony relents, “Then find me a new assistant, and remember: No beauties. That means no models, no actresses, no cigarette girls, no damn wolves in silk stockings.” He didn’t need another Gialetta, his last long-term assistant and lover turned Nazi sympathizer.
he had replied.
“Yes, and now that I have fulfilled my vow, I can pursue what I want.”
“What man wouldn’t need a drink or five to get through an evening with
“That’s my man.” Antony yawns then drops into a deep slumber. When he wakes in the morning, Stefanus will be gone leaving behind only the scent of musky sex lingering in the air, but for now, they rest wrapped up in each other.
He’d been filling out, too. Whereas Steve had been a scrawny shrimp a mere four months prior, now he had grown tall – taller than Tony even – and while still slim, he’d started to bulk up a bit as well.
“You told everyone!” he fumes. “You told everyone about us, about me! You told them I let you fuck me!”
That does nothing to reassure Steve. He is a light sleeper, but vampires are even lighter intruders.
He does not see Master Phillips fall, but fall he must because the padawan is not alone for long.
Scratch that. This entire exercise – this ‘friendship’ – is going to be a trial.
“You don’t. It is what is called a ‘trust exercise.’”
It's too far; both of them know Stefanus is dead, done for, and all Bacchus has to do to seal the deal is bring down his dagger through his eye. It will be quick, and if he aims right and strikes true, relatively painless…
“Stay for a spell, dear Staius,” the host urges, his eyes drifting to the boy who had served Antony all night. “I’m sure the fair Lucius would love to entertain you further.”
“…He can hold a shovel.”
He rounds on Tony. “What was that back there?”
Tony sighs, collects himself. “Okay, if you’re all done making bets–”
“My uncle is staying with us, and my mom got mad he brought ‘trash’ into the house, so she threw it out, and I managed to snag it before the garbage man did,” Pinky tells the others, pulling out a coveted Playboy from his backpack.
“Thank you, fearless leader,” Tony says, clearly happy to have scored a win, however slim.
The candidate Rhodey sends is decidedly not a beauty. Small and worryingly scrawny, the man looks as if he wouldn’t survive a stiff breeze, much less the journey to Egypt. Why, the dry heat alone would–
boobs is one of the boy’s better attributes; it’s partially why they got along so well. “Come on, can’t we just play on? Steve’s not even–”
“You tell me, doc. Personally, I think I’ve lived a pretty privileged life up to now. Not a lot of people have had the same opportunities, the same advantages I’ve had, so really, I’ve got no cause to complain. I think honeybear’s just worried, you know.”
Tired of their squabbling, Gabe asks, “Have you had your first kiss, Tony?”
“I wasn’t going to suggest that,” Tony protests, but in such a way that casts doubt on his statement. “I was merely pointing out that dating is hard in our line of work, and if you wanted to give it a go – the real college try – then I wouldn’t be…
He’s nearly eleven weeks along when he takes a hard hit to the stomach and is tossed around like a ragdoll by a new villain known as the Titanium Man built using Vanko’s old specs. Worried about the effects of the impact, Tony had flown back to the Tower before he could be medically cleared or debriefed.
“Yeah, man. Just… I don’t know. They’re hunting them all down.”
“Would you like to see the stars?”
“Yours,” Rhodey states without hesitation. “You didn’t have to hire him.”
“I will drink to that,” Antony finishes his wine only for Priscus to refill it. “Now about Hadrianus’s candidacy…”
“You heard me. A
) Tony protests, getting into Cap’s face. “I can still fight.”
However, all is not lost. Luckily, it’s early enough for Jarvis to still be abed and for Steve to have left on his morning run, so he nudges the guy awake and sends him packing in short order with a mumbled apology and directions to slip out the backdoor.
He soon comes upon the front gate of the ludus. It is an expansive complex, impressive in its own right, with a walled-in courtyard at the center where the gladiators practiced their craft bookended by long, flat outbuildings where they kept horses and armor. Towards the back is the main building, with gladiatorial barracks on the ground floor and Priscus’s villa above. It is there that he is received in the open-air atrium by none other than the lanista himself.
“I don’t want to take it back.”
“Tell me, Staius. How will Hadrianus work with the patricians to address the dreadful tax rate?” Longinus is asking him, leading to a drawn-out, incredibly dry conversation regarding tax law and policy (Antony’s own personal Tarturus).
Tony doesn’t want to wait. He takes the keys, turning to his companions, but before he can say anything, Pepper swipes the smaller of the two. “I will take the single room. You boys have fun in the suite,” she says, as if any other option had been on the table.
It’s not like the “lie” is far from the truth.
“It’s not you; it’s me,” he blurts out, like that isn’t the oldest line in the book.
All is silent, almost deathly until…
“…That’s it?” He sounds surprised.
Steve springs into action, already hurrying to the duffle bag to retrieve his satellite phone. “I’m calling it in. We’ll get samples from all the food and drink you had tonight, analyze the poisoning agent, and get you to a–”
“And later, when you’re more comfortable, if you would like…” Antony gives him a look, one of a hunger Stefanus is only all too used to seeing in men’s eyes. But if he can pass more nights as he has, be unavailable to others who would use him more roughly, then what is the harm?
He can hear the telltale clicking of Pepper’s heels in double-time followed by shouts and scuffling on the other side.
His mother tries to assuage his fears as she tucks him in, but Tony isn’t convinced.
It doesn’t mean anything – none of this does – but Tony must have started believing Cap’s bullshit somewhere along the way, and now he is paying the price, like his mother did decades before.
“Hail Bucky?” Steve calls out, dropping the pile near the charred remains of the prior fire. “Dum Dum?” He peaks inside a lean-to, finding it empty. “James? Percival?” He walks the perimeter of the campsite. “Gabriel?” He looks down a path of crushed leaves and disturbed branches, recently traveled with footsteps leading away from camp. “Jim?”
Stefanus thinks about his sword slicing down the base of Aemilius’s neck, about how every red denarius he earns will be going towards his and Bacchus’s freedom so they won’t meet the same fate. “I’ll consider it.”
“The curse!” Steve exclaims into the impenetrable darkness.
“Guys,” Steve says, stepping between them. “Can we just… I don’t know, get some sandwiches and watch some cartoons or something?”
Steve narrows his eyes and without much ceremony, hauls Tony up and impales him on his dick. A better man would go slow, would ensure his partner is comfortable with the intrusion, the angle, before seeking his own pleasure. But Tony doesn’t want a better man. He wants Captain America in all his power and fury, holding Tony down, punishing his body, hurting him in unspeakable, unforgiveable ways…
Five harrowing minutes later when they have finally leveled off, Steve climbs over the bodies, the table along with various detritus Stark had previously stacked upon it. He eventually makes it to the cockpit where he falls into the copilot seat and straps himself in. He breathes heavily, his adrenaline still running high but with the edge just beginning to subside. “So…” he begins, “That went well.”
“But how do you talk to them? Like… what line do you use to seal the deal?”
He lifts his head to meet Steve’s lips once again, a hand snaking into Steve’s pants, tracing the outline of his generous erection. Tony hasn’t been with anyone in months, not since he’s gotten sober, and he wonders how much he’ll have to stretch to accommodate Steve.
There had been a point to this meeting, before it devolved into wild speculation on the identity of his sperm donor (as Tony had taken to referring to Cap in his head).
“Ow! What the hell, Stark?” Steve doesn’t drop him, but it’s a near thing.
“Just a minute! Can’t a man shit in peace?”
His words prove prescient as not even a week later after their daily wash, an attendant gives Suibne a clean white toga bordered with a wide purple stripe along with a phallic pendant on a leather cord. “Wear this for your audience with Dominus,” they tell him.
Stefanus cuts a fine profile in his utilitarian tunic, dagger at his side and a keen eye for their surroundings. Antony wishes he could cut the evening short and see exactly what he has to work with underneath all that off-white wool. He had declined Priscus’s offer to examine the man in the nude before final purchase, preferring to be surprised the night of, but now he wonders if he shouldn’t have prepared himself in some way. If Antony had been interested in topping, Stefanus’s cock would require little consideration beyond aesthetic preference, but his plans being what they were…
“…In their original forms?” Steve hesitates to ask.
Purple Man intends to keep it that way, but perhaps it wouldn’t hurt to treat Stark, to give him a boon, a little something he desires but is too afraid to ever actively pursue.
Tony had done a lot of soul-searching on his own, and though he clearly loves Steve, he isn’t quite sure whether he is in love with him or whether that even mattered, because again: Steve could have moved on by now. The thought hurts him more than he expects, prevents him from calling and getting the answers he desperately needs (even if he’s not sure he wants to hear them).
“Fine,” Tony concedes. “Far be it from me to assume you’d want to get your dick wet during our honeymoon.”
And so when he finally meets the other boy after he and his mother have moved in and settled, Tony pretends he’s not nearly vibrating with excitement at the prospect of his very first age-appropriate friend who isn’t Jarvis.
“I’ve already made my donation and put in an appearance.” Tony usually left these things halfway through anyway, once he had secured a date for the evening. “Besides, I’d, uh… be interested in seeing if your flogging arm is as good as I’ve heard.”
That is all well and good for him, noble even, but Antony just found gladiators hot.
“Safe travels, Bucky,” Steve says on the day of their parting. He grants him a small wave.
“Presume nothing. This is me propositioning you. Explicitly. Would you like to join me upstairs where we can do what we could have been doing the last five days instead of bickering over itineraries and how much situational awareness is appropriate or possible at all times?”
Bacchus survives his bout, as does his reprieved rival, and both attend the victory feast later that night in celebration of a fruitful munus. Stefanus feels the weight of the winner’s purse heavy at his belt.
He’s still wearing that ridiculous spandex, his uniform hugging every curve, every bulging muscle, and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. It’s unseemly, but it’s not Purple Man’s disgust that matters. If it were solely up to him, Captain America would be manning a solitary outpost in Siberia, but Stark lusts after the man. Having spent nearly a month amongst the Avengers, that much is obvious to Purple Man. Stark’s eyes follow him like a lost puppy, his body language more open to Rogers than to his own bodyguard even. He trusts him, defers to him when he’s allowed, and is hopelessly taken by the man.
S-A-F-E / P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S / G-O-N-E
But Antony only shakes his head. “Quite the contrary. It would please me greatly to please you, so I think tonight I would like your company instead. With our clothes on, of course.” Stefanus must look perplexed, because he explains, “I paid for the night, and you will stay the night, but I think I would much prefer to dine with you and hear more about your travels. That is an unusual accent you have; from where do you hail, Stefanus? How did you become a gladiator? I am all ears.”
He tries to reason with his father. “Listen. I’ll be back in the fall. It’s not that long, in the grand scheme of things.”
When Tony is old enough to understand what happened, he would think that this had been the beginning of the end. Had he stayed for tea after or quit piano earlier, perhaps none of it would have happened, maybe his mother would even still be alive…
“I was drunk.”
Steve glares at the journalist. He may be right but bringing up Natasha was a bridge too far. It was ghoulish, unseemly, and completely inappropriate given the circumstances. He takes a half-step forward, but Tony grabs his hand before he can go any further and squeezes, subtly reminding him to play nice, to smile or at least not challenge the guy to step outside and settle it like real men.
“He’ll be fine. What could go wrong?” Tony wants to retract his words the minute they leave his mouth. Virgil’s death, Gialetta’s betrayal and subsequent madness… even Rhodey himself had been forced to leave him after a number of years, no longer able to stomach his selfish obsession with adventuring, with finding a cure at the expense of everyone around him.
“I could get used to this,” Tony mumbles as he leans his head back to rest on Steve’s shoulder. Steve wraps an arm around him, the other placed lazily on Tony’s nude thigh. The temperature of the water is perfect, though the bubbles have begun to subside.
Antony frowns. “I’m sensing a but.”
“I need to take off your helmet,” Steve says, reaching to lift it so he can see the extent of the damage. Perhaps he can even repair–
Slowly, tentatively, Tony shifts onto his haunches, leans over their daughter, and brushes his lips against Steve’s.
“I think he’s…”
“He was cold, calculating, never told me he loved me, never even told me he liked me, so it’s not such a stretch to believe I was a disappointment to him, but you know, he stopped at the one kid, so the fact that I was his only choice for an heir… well, that’s on him.” Tony never asked him to put all his eggs in one leaky basket, but then again: “I just think he never liked kids; maybe Mom wanted two and they compromised or something.” He thinks of Steve. Perhaps Howard would have liked him better if he was more like Steve, minus his recently-discovered sexuality of course. “Well, he disliked most kids.” And ultimately Howard was still willing to throw Steve to the wolves, if it would keep Tony in line. “He saw them as useful sometimes. Not often, but sometimes.”
Bacchus gives him a lopsided half-smile and pats his upper arm in easy camaraderie. “Have fun. I want details later.”
“Then what–” Tony misses a beat, and his leg brushes up against Steve’s groin. His eyes widen.
“When will you crazy kids learn?” Clint sits down at the table in the breakfast nook. “So, what did you play for this time, or was it just another blow to your pride?”
Stefanus looks between the bed and his two guests before addressing Antony. “I am pleased that you have chosen to visit, Antony, but…” he glances at Julia yet again. This cannot be what it looks like.
“Your tests are wrong. I can’t be pregnant. I’m pushing forty-three. I’m”
“Hey!” Steve yells as he sticks his knife deep into the temple of his second assailant, pulling it out as the zombie falls. He kicks at one of them, pushing it into a second, and drawing the attention of all three who turn to pursue him, leaving Tony upon the ladder.
This Stefanus certainly looks like he’d be worth the effort.
“The ‘public’ includes members of your own family as well, Priscus.” Antony knows Priscus is liable to sell his own mother downriver should the price prove high enough, but it doesn’t hurt to clarify the extent of discretion he expects.
While Steve tries to find a vase, Tony scopes out his apartment. It’s a nice place, with a full-sized bookcase ensconced against an exposed brick alcove. There’s an overstuffed black leather couch nearby with a record player behind it atop a buffet cabinet filled with old vinyls, and beyond that, the kitchen where Steve is filling an old spaghetti sauce jar with water.
“I speak of the gladiator.”
“Hey!”
“They don’t,” the contractor replies. “We had to order it special.” He then addresses Tony, “Look, Mr. Stark. If you want to change the color, we can tear it all out and start over, but it’s going to cost you.” He knows he’s good for it. If Tony Stark really wants something, money is no object, and what Tony wants is a modern, clean,
Howard was less amused, and when Jarvis had picked him up at the train station, he had warned Tony that his father had locked himself in the study, where he had been on the phone the entire morning, trying to clean up his mess.
That sextarius of wine had also cost a week’s wages of a standard public servant.
“Didn’t say you were, but maybe–”
In this story, Tony feels isolated because of his age, while Rhodey feels out of place in a largely white campus. Their experiences are different, but I like to think they relate as outsiders, albeit in different ways.
“I think we both know why,” Bacchus replies. He grasps Stefanus’s thigh, already prepared for death. “Omnes Una Manet Nox. Et calcanda semel via leti… I’ll see you again in the Fields of Elysium, Stefanus,” he mutters through a wheeze. He’s heaving, his chest rising and falling visibly, through fear, through waning adrenaline, as the crowd calls out for his death, uncaring why a gladiator would flout his purpose and cast aside his weapon, thinking he had lost his nerve in the end. Stefanus knows better; Bacchus’s actions are not the result of cowardice as the masses suppose, but mercy, sacrifice, and brotherly love.
Antony Staius is in love.
“I did, and maybe in the future, you will be more judicious with your affairs.”
Tony shudders when Steve glances his prostate. “Fuck, Steve,” his whispers, his voice gone low and breathy as his thighs clench around his hand then relax to spread wider, to accommodate Steve’s body. “Oh fuck! Just fuck me already, darling.”
“Agreed. If one is a man,” Fidelis watches the boy rise, observing his underdeveloped muscle mass and limbs long and near-gangly for someone so small. “I asked for decent recruits, and all I got was him.”
“Steve, can you please pass the rolls?” Tony’s mother had requested during lunch.
“Hey Nat, have you seen my charger?” Steve inquires. He doesn’t even look up, his eyes glued to the screen of the latest StarkPhone Tony had supplied to each of the Avengers, save Thor who left to deliver his brother to an Asgardian prison shortly after the Battle of New York and had yet to return.
And with that, he leaves, slamming the door after himself.
“Your father then?”
“Shellhead? Are you in there?” Steve calls from the other side of the door, followed by subtle knocking. When Tony doesn’t respond, he continues. “I don’t know why you’re sore with me. Maybe if you’d come out and–”
“Every time someone orders pineapple on pizza, a demon gets its horns. Though this is half a pizza, so maybe it’s just the one horn, like a unicorn,” Tony rambles on. It offended his sensibilities as both an Italian and a New Yorker, and he always had to place the order under a false name. He preferred the small pizzerias and would like to one day patronize them in person again. He didn’t want to have his options limited because Steve’s taste buds developed frost bite and had to be amputated (or at least that’s what he theorizes must have happened for him to think fruit on pizza is in any way acceptable).
“Cocoa sounds amazing,” Tony replies, plopping down in one of the chairs. He takes in his surroundings and wonders how Steve feels about the downgrade in lifestyle after having lived a decade in a mansion.
“It just seems to me that you’re lying low because you’re embarrassed when you shouldn’t be. Howard was a hard man. He was smarter and more competent than most and as a result, expected a lot out of his fellow man,” Steve pats him on the shoulder in easy camaraderie. “It couldn’t have been easy being his kid.”
Tony’s version of ‘figuring it out’ involves a welder and University President Jerome Wiesner’s car. The prank is messy, clunky, and missing the finesse and intelligence of a truly great MIT hack, but it gets the job done. Of course, Tony had copped to the deed immediately and was suspended for the rest of the academic year. Rhodey had been quick to point out that had Tony been anyone else, he would have been expelled, but as it stands, he
“Why not? We’re married, darling. Can’t I ask my husband for a dance?”
“Didn’t stop you before.”
“We will restore your friends to their original human forms if you sow six shirts of nettles for them to wear…”
Steve sets a tray of fried eggs, sausage, and the pancakes he just finished in front of him along with a mug of coffee. “I said I’d bring you breakfast in bed,” he tells him gently as he finishes the presentation with a miniature gravy boat of warmed syrup.
Steve is not amenable to that plan.
In contrast, nothing he did to improve ever seemed to matter to Master Phillips. Master Phillips remembered him as a troubled boy, from before he had managed to develop emotional resilience and restraint, when he was still struggling to fit in with the other Jedi Initiates and had gotten into more than one scrap. Master Phillips had had to discipline him multiple times during his stint at the Academy and must have been sorely tempted to expel him at least once. But that had been over ten years ago. In the interim, Steve had flourished under Master Erskine as his padawan. He had done his best to practice meditation and squash any remaining attachments, to accept things as they are and have compassion for all living beings equally. The incident with Master Erskine’s assassin… that had been a mistake, and he could own it as such. There is a process to these things, and Steve had failed to remain level-headed in an emotionally-fraught situation. It was a blunder that is unlikely to reoccur, especially with Master Phillips as his new mentor. Steve will be calm, the perfect padawan, and if someone happened to murder Master Phillips right this very second, he will even restrain himself from extreme retaliation.
It starts like this: Tony is antsy and itching for a fight with America’s Golden Boy, the freshly-defrosted Capsicle himself.
“Then what if I’m just plain no good at it?” Steve nearly wails.
“I don’t know. How about a pie?” Steve probably hasn’t had a decent slice since his last visit… which was two weeks ago. When they both failed to get off. Because Tony was being a dick on purpose, and Cap tapped out before he could tap that.
It feels almost normal, this type of back-and-forth. Like the good old days before everything fell apart.
Antony can’t believe it. Hadrianus had ridiculed Caesar for doing exactly the same thing when Antony was but a child. “Mother has been dead for over twenty years.”
He rubs the back of his neck, moderately embarrassed. “It’s not a big–”
“She seems healthy, too.” There’s wonder there and an underlying relief as well. “I always thought if I had a child…”
“I would be honored to handle you, if you would have me.”
Steve doesn’t know what to do with that information, so instead he wets a hand towel and hands it to Tony. “I’m sorry to hear that.”
For those who are wondering based on the conflicting hints RE: Steve background. He is part Jewish from his father’s side, but his mother is Irish Catholic. He had a mixed-faith background between his mother and paternal grandmother (before she passed).
“I love it.”
“So, I guess that’s it, huh? Wham, bam, thank you, ma’am,” he asks Steve’s back.
He had thought he had caught a stomach bug from questionable sushi, but one trip to his private physician had confirmed the worst.
“What does it matter? If a dominus and slave can form a relationship, then why not a free and freedman?”
Master Erskine is always doing this, reading too much into every little interaction and assigning meaning where there is none. It’s one of his more annoying traits.
Steve swallows on nothing and stands up immediately. “I– I’m going to refill the canteens,” he says, before stalking off.
Tony stands, pushes Steve back down in his seat by his shoulders, then spins around to deliver a mean right hook straight across the interloper’s jaw.
Tony is unimpressed. “That’s not a real weakness,” he says flatly.
“Yeah,” Nat reports. She looks at the box. “What’s that?”
Tony shrinks in on himself. “I wanted… well, I just wanted to be a regular student. Have the normal college experience, you know. Besides, I wasn’t that bad at it. Cindy was really into me.” Five minutes longer and he’s sure he could have gotten her number.
), who has trouble relating to his much-older peers who seem to all be into cars and swapping spit with the first girl who might let them touch her boob after three months of going steady or whatever. Tony doesn’t get the appeal, but that’s not the point. The point is that he only has one shot at a good first impression, and he needs to make it count.
after watching
And because Tony has known Steve for years (and because he might have felt the same way about Bucky in the early days), he doesn’t make Steve squirm. “You’re still one of my best friends, you know. Just because I’m hanging out with Rhodey doesn’t mean it changes anything between you and me.”
“Shocking, I know, but recent research suggests women are people.”
Tony ignores him, sweeping the flashlight from side to side across the wall of the burial chambers to read the hieroglyphics contained within.
“You like Tony, don’t you?” he asks the prone man. “You want to make him happy?”
Steve places a hand on his knee, his thumb lightly rubbing a circle in the joint. “Maybe we should put on some pants.” He gives Tony a peck on the corner of his mouth then steps away from the bed to root for his newly-minted partner’s pants among the disaster that is his bedroom floor. He finally finds them near the door under his jacket with the zipper nearly pulled off. He places them on the edge of the bed, within Tony’s reach.
Following one bad decision with life-altering implications, Tony unilaterally decides to not burden Steve with the consequences of their actions. He’s doing Steve a favor, saving him from a lifetime of obligation, he reasons. Steve would never want this baby; he doesn’t want to be a father, at least not yet and certainly not alongside Tony. But the deeper truth is that Tony simply doesn’t want Steve.
“We are very happy, ecstatic really,” he gushes as Steve stands behind him, ever the stoic but supportive spouse. “This ruling has been a long time coming, and I’m so happy to have married the love of my life.”
refusals, Tony had massaged his forehead and sucked in a steadying breath. “…Are you kidding me right now? What’s the problem this time? Are they too flirty? Too available? What’s your deal?”
“I have charm,” Stark replies, ignoring Steve’s snort, “but I wouldn’t have to work half as hard if I looked like you.”
Steve blushes scarlet, and Tony knows he’s hit on the truth. Then he remembers how Steve had appeared flustered in his apartment. “Steve, when you said the second bedroom was for guests…”
It doesn’t stop there. Within the first half hour, Tony manages to not only insult Cap’s wardrobe and age, but also his grandfatherly etiquette, his aversion to spicy food, and his old-fashioned sensibilities.
“I still pay your bills.”
“You will find that Mr. Stark would prefer a… shorter sabbatical as it were,” Jarvis tries to warn him.
Alexander Pierce/Priscus is the lanista/dominus who owns the ludus and all the gladiators.
“I’d ask if you brought flowers, but uh… I think we both know I’ve had enough of those,” Tony rasps and tries to laugh it off, but it comes out a wheeze.
“It’s not about need but desire,” Tony replies, rolling heel-toe on his feet. “Besides, isn’t that what you love about me?”
He's so hot, so empty, and he’s on the verge of telling Stefanus to just fuck him already when the man’s cockhead breeches him ever so slightly at first, and then deeper and deeper, impaling him further down his length with every thrust. Antony moans, his blunted fingernails scratching light pink ribbons in Stefanus’s back at the slow pace, as he slides ever further down. Stefanus makes a strangled sound in the back of his throat, then he holds Antony’s hips steady to control the speed and depth of their fucking. He’s muttering things – guttural sounds and phrases – in a language Antony cannot hope to understand but wonders if it is witchcraft just the same when he feels his sanity fading.
“He has spirit.”
Over a dinner of Chinese takeout, Clint cracks jokes at Steve’s expense. “Careful with that Kung Pao chicken, Bruce. It will sting Steve when you eat him out later.”
“Why did you do it, Bacchus? You had me.”
Clint shouldn’t ask, but – “Then why is Steve’s bed in shambles?”
“You haven’t even asked him, have you? Afraid of the answer?”
“You want something. Name it.” Tony will give Steve near-about anything he asks.
“Master Phillips, this is Steven Rogers. He will be accompanying us back to the Academy,” Master Erskine says, as if that is in any way a reasonable course of action. He addresses the boy, “Steven, this is Master Phillips; he’s the headmaster of the Jedi Academy I was telling you about.”
“Don’t chu wanna have a li’l fun, Cap?” he slurs, clumsily sliding his hands up under Steve’s shirt.
The second orb scoffs. “I like these better. They are much more sensible this way.”
The others seem surprised and much more attentive now. “Really? With who?” Gabe presses.
Priscus looks down his nose at the boy still cradling his bandaged wound. “Mark my words, boy. Though I favor your rather delicate countenance, I will not hesitate to ruin it should you run.” He grabs Suibne’s hand, digging his fingers into the angry flesh of his brand as the boy cowers. “Do not mistake my benevolence, my mercy, for soft-hearted foolishness.”
Rhodey concedes the point for the sake of argument. “Okay… so this guy, who is
With a roar, Steve grabs the retreating stick, snapping it in half before he tackles Stark to the ground. Stark uses his momentum to flip him over, but Steve knees him then rolls him off. However, before Steve can pummel the Mandalorian, Stark is on him yet again. They tussle across the forest floor until Stark uses his superior weight to pin Steve to the ground, his knees pressing into Steve’s thighs with his legs locking around his calves, his arms holding Steve’s own up over his head and his helmet inches from Steve’s face. Steve can see his reflection, angry as he struggles. His breath is ragged and rapid as it gently fogs up the shiny metal. And then he feels it. A growing hardness in Stark’s groin pressed flush against his own.
Suddenly, he hears a light roar. He sees his opponents look up, just as the first five are gunned down from above. His gaze is similarly drawn upward, until he spies the source: A Mandalorian, wearing red and gold armor drops into the fray, his blasters blazing and beskar acting as a shield against any return fire. Steve snaps out of his shock as he joins his unlikely ally, cutting down any in his path, until both he and the Mandalorian are fighting back to back. They circle around, firing and slicing through opponents until only they remain.
“For good reason.”
Abraham Erskine/Erasmus is the doctores secutorum, who later picks out and trains up Stefanus as a secutor.
“You don’t think they’ll check?” Steve asks. Stark’s ship is newer, and it’s possible their inspectors won’t be familiar with the various features available in this model – the storage hatch might even be a custom alteration – but then again, the scavengers who stripped his ship had found it just fine.
“I love you, sweetheart.”
Steve buries his face in his hands and weeps.
“…Tony?”
Steve had remembered the day Master Phillips had told him they would be sent away from Coruscant, the very center of the Core Worlds. He had thought he was being punished for what he had done to Master Erskine’s assassin, with his new master possibly being collateral damage or even acting as his voluntary jailer.
Tony had even enlisted Steve to help him in the endeavor. Steve had written down the exact order as dictated and read it back to Tony, double checking for accuracy.  Tony had been very precise on the form, relaying hex color codes instead of more-subjective names to specify the color of marble they should source, but it looked like the contractors had disregarded his instructions entirely to opt for rose quartz instead.
Having to concentrate on the road, Steve had been fine on the way over, but as they stand side-by-side at the door, he fidgets, runs his fingers through his hair to feel the evenness of his part, manually checking that each strand is in place. He looks down at his pants, scrutinizing whether the long drive had cemented permanent creases in them. Are these wrinkle-free? Should he have worn jeans? That’s what country boys do, right? But what about five-hundred year old vampires?
“…You wouldn’t,” Tony nearly hisses.
Hodge waits for Master Phillips to leave. “Nice job, Rogers. You got us both detention,” he complains, elbowing Steve who subsequently rounds on him.
“Alright, fine.” Dracula goes limp. “I concede.”
And now the man is shaking his head. “I don’t need a villa, nor a prestigious apartment in the city, nor any number of things you think will make me happy. You are all I want, all I have ever wanted, and I am asking as a freedman if that is something you want as well, a relationship on a more even footing than before.”
“Hey… uh…”
“Stop that,” Stark says, his fingers stilling. “Stop making him say those things.” Rogers whines and fucks himself back on his fingers, inspiring Stark to continue his violation.
Steve seems to mull over his answer. “You could join us.”
Still nothing?
Later, after Suibne is returned to the retiarii barracks dressed in his scratchy tunic, he lies on his side facing the wall. He doesn’t turn around when he hears someone enter the room nor when he hears that person heft himself up on the top bunk adjacent to him. He only curls up smaller and tries not to cry. Crying is a weakness he can ill-afford. He startles when there is a hand on his ankle then looks over his shoulder to find it is only Bacchus.
The man spits on his arm as he tries to pry off Steve’s iron grip. “Piss off.”
“Though I feel I should remind you – simply as a professional courtesy – that should you utilize his services in public, people will see you together regardless of whatever I have to say on the matter. If tongues wag, do not assume I am the source.”
“I freed you all.”
“Hm. How do you suppose we should spend the interim?”
He raises a brow. “I know you too well for
It feels… more than the countless others who came before. Less empty. Most of the men he had been with had been anonymous. He hadn’t known much about them other than the shape and feel of their bodies underneath his own and had thought little of them after the act. It had been purely physical, a pressure release valve on his psyche that once tapped would sustain him for a few days after while not diffusing the main issue, whatever it may be. But Tony… he knew Tony, like he had known Jan or Gail. He had worked with him for months, knew parts of his history, his joys and hurts, and perhaps that made all the difference.
Stark is in disbelief. “All of them?”
“I like it now,” and that is all he has to say about that. “What about you?”
Definitions:
“Yeah?”
“I’m afraid I do not understand… Antony. Have I displeased you in some way?” Priscus will have his hide if Antony returns him untouched with demands for a refund.
“I spoke to Mr. Rhodes, and he told me to come here to meet the client for my formal interview,” he explains as Tony stares at the ad, silently cursing his one-time assistant. Mr. Rogers fidgets a bit, trying to smooth out the wrinkles of his best (threadbare) work shirt. “I know I don’t look much the part, but I’m a good worker, sir. I don’t much mind strong-headedness – have a touch of it myself –” he catches himself on the slip. “That is to say, I can get on with just about anyone of any temperament.”
“It is nothing, just a small token of–”
No matter the cost.
He leans into Tony, kissing him fully, gently pushing him into the mattress as he strokes his partial erection and nudges his knees apart with his leg.
“The type of sex I like, it’s easier to find men who… who match, but discretion can be a challenge. A man gets Antonius Staius to bend over for him, and he’s more likely than not to brag about it, but I like it, and a couple men with loose lips are not going to diminish that.”
“I don’t.”
His friend seems to accept his answer, raising his cup in toast. “To Aemilius.”
my bed chambers,” Antony takes out his coin purse, weighing it in one hand then placing it on the table, the clink of many coins unmistakable, “to ward off assassination attempts, you understand.”
This story takes place in roughly 49 BC during the waning days of the Roman Republic before the establishment of the Roman Empire and at the peak of the gladiator games (munus/munera). It is approximately 5-6 years after Julius Caesar first invaded Britain and coerced many of the native Celtic tribes to pay tribute and send hostages. Generally speaking, conquered peoples who fought against Roman forces were usually enslaved wholesale, but if they surrendered, they were spared this fate. Steve’s tribe did not surrender. Caesar is assassinated five years later in 44BC. So anyway, I did some research, but it’s very hard to narrow down every single detail to the same specific time period so bear with me on any anachronisms.
Still…
Steve yawns as he settles in, cradling Tony closer. “Good night, sweetheart.”
Antony’s expression becomes unreadable, his verbal affect flat. “Oh? And who is this friend?”
Bacchus looks surprised. “You can speak?”
“I haven’t really done it much since the war, and it seems to have fallen out of fashion among civilians.” It’s not like Steve
And now Tony just looks miserable, so Steve stops, retracting his hand only for Tony to dart out and hold on.
“None of… What the hell, Stark? The Avengers are my business, and if you can’t… if you have a medical issue that is going to interfere–”
“Took the words right out of my mouth.”
“If we could focus on the mission–”
“…No one of consequence”
“No, but I’ve seen the trailer, and Bruce Campbell is pretty easy on the eyes.”
“Your company, for one, as we have done tonight.”
She never told him he was a good kisser.
good for their cover, so Steve accepts, allowing Tony to pull him to the dance floor, but once they’re there, they run into yet another problem.
Then there are footsteps. Two – no, three – new sets of boots stomping across the floor.
“It is the way of the Jedi,” Master Phillips replies, confirming Steve’s supposition.
In Steve’s confusion, he blurts out, “You’re still a virgin?”
“I didn’t name the goat. He came with it. Organic, pasture-raised with plenty of friends, a horse named Belle, and all the other kids.” Steve slows to take a left into the long driveway of the Dracula family estate. “Only the best for your father.”
Maybe after he’s come down, Steve will suck Tony off. He’ll make it sloppy, his thumb pressed into Tony’s hole, trying to keep his cum inside as Tony cries out and his legs turn to jelly. He’ll keep him upright though, make sure he doesn’t fall. Cap’s always been considerate like that.
“Is that the look you’re going for?” Steve snaps back.
Purple Man’s voice drops low. “You’re trying to resist me, aren’t you? No one can resist me at this range,” he says, hovering just behind Tony by his ear so as to not obstruct his view of Captain Rogers. “It’s not like I’m even getting anything out of this. This is all for you. I’ve seen how you look at him, so don’t pretend you don’t want him on my account. Just think of this as a reward for all your hard work.”
“Language.” Steve grabs his captive’s left hand, folding it back until he hears a crack. The man shrieks. “Now you listen here. I will break every bone in your body then make you swallow your broken teeth one by one until all you can do is painfully tap out Tony’s location in Morse Code with the useless stumps that were once your hands.” He breaks a pinky finger on the man’s right, inspiring a fresh wave of screams.
Probably, but “I think the time it would have taken to get him lower is worth the twenty cred.”
“Oh, and how do you figure that?”
He sits up. “What are those?”
Was his master less of a Jedi because of his attachment to Steve? Master Phillips probably thought so, but Steve is not so sure.
And so he accepts the proverbial olive branch, his teeth piercing the creatures flesh, tearing it away as chews. Stark turns his back on Steve then, lifting up the bottom of his helmet to enjoy his half of the meal unseen.
“And Howard is…”
Bucky can only grumble, “And this is why we don’t take our partners on mission.”
It figures Steve would worry about that, even at a time like this.
Antony frowns, his brows drawn together. “But I like my beard.”
Steve’s smile is a touch stiff. “Nice to meet you, ma’am.”
“That is neither fun nor a fact.”
Bacchus brings the training trident down on Stefanus’s unguarded knee for the second time in a row, the third such hit in their sparring session. Fidelis calls for a break, and Stefanus rubs the reddened spot, wondering if it will soon bloom into an ugly bruise.
“You think we’re having sex?” Stark manages through amused chuckling. “And you’ve also somehow decided that Steve would be the one to… to bend over and take one for the team?”
“It’s my understanding that it’s healthy for couples to spend a few hours apart.”
“Bacchus, I– I am sorry… for running out of time, for not getting you out.”
“It sounds like Supreme Chancellor Palpatine did that.”
“It’s just sex.”
Contrary to expectation, Stefanus takes to the shield and sword far better than he had the net and trident. His experience as a retiarius also serves him well in his new capacity. He knows how they move, how they respond, having been one himself, and when he wins his first bout, Fidelis grumbles and complains, but he pays his outstanding bet to Erasmus.
So, in a way, Tony does learn the value of secrets.
Tony licks his lips, the coppery tang vaguely unpleasant. “You know the rules. No petnames. Now shut up and fuck me like you mean it. I don’t have all day.”
Munera were also extremely expensive, and Augustus capped the cost of a praetor’s munus at 120 gladiators costing 25,000 denarii for an ‘economical’ munus while an imperial munus cost a minimum of 180,000 denarii.
fall in love with him. I am serious, deathly so.”
“Yeah. Seeing as how you’re going to be living here from now on–” He must have said something wrong because Steve’s face drops. “…you’re staying, right?” Tony hadn’t considered it, but a few of the kids at his school have two families. Sometimes they live with Dad, and sometimes they live with Mom, and Ms. Sarah didn’t seem to be married at the moment. What if…
He had truly thought that would be the last he ever sees of Stefanus, and so he is surprised when the man calls on him two weeks later at the Staius villa. With Hadrianus safely engaged at the Senate, he approves his admittance and receives him in the atrium. Stefanus looks well. He wears the blue tunic and complementary cloak Antony had purchased for him months ago in the early days of his service and seems glad but simultaneously apprehensive, his expression a touch guarded when Antony greets him.
“We must be scrapping the bottom of the barrel if we’re accepting the likes of you.” Hodge, the star pupil of the Savrip Clan and son of a Senator, had taken one look at Steve in his grubby shift and lack of proper belongings and decided his (lack of) worth. He had even pushed Steve’s cot closer to the latrines, declaring he smelled like he belonged there.
“But do you understand–”
“It’s a tight fit,” Stark points out. Plus, the blindfold is not exactly comfortable to sleep in.
Tony means for it to be comforting, but Steve just looks miserable. “It’ll never work. She doesn’t like me that way.”
The door flies open, revealing an aging man, tall and sinewy, still strong, his skin unnaturally pallid and hair long and surprisingly full for his age. “Anthony, my boy. Come in. Come in.”
“The Empire has taken Mandalore.”
“Name the goat,” Tony clarifies, his fingers tapping on the side door. “I don’t want you to get attached.”
“I will never forgive you,” Antony vows, “Not for Stefanus and not for dragging Mother’s memory into your personal vendetta.”
Tony looks down at his machine gun, woefully unused. “So, we’re not busting out of here Rambo-style?” he asks.
“Maybe if you started making sense–”
The grinder is a loss, dented and covered in rancid flesh and sinew. He drops the device with a loud clunk and sighs, nearly falling to his knees as Steve catches him.
“Your mirror is lying if you think you two look the same,” Antony retorts dismissively. “You must have quite the high opinion of yourself. Only you would be conceited enough to think you are the only blond man in Rome.”
“Why not?”
She stubs out her cigarette and turns to Steve, leaning in closer to seductively stroke his hip and pluck the half-finished cigarette from his lips. She smells of smoke and sex, and her eyes are a touch too bright.
Steve allows Tony to bend him backwards, intent on the man’s smiling face.
“It is not about desire but about necessity,” Hadrianus counters, his arms crossed. “I will put a stop to your dalliances for your own good.”
Steve wants to ask, but the memory is clearly painful for Stark, and tonight is about pleasure. There will be time for questions later when they survive the morrow.
Steve shrugs. “It’s a matter of strength and balance, I suppose…”
“Ready when you are.”
And now his friend is exasperated. “I warned you, Stefanus. Didn’t I warn you not to fall for him? He’s freeborn; he rents you out as if you are a mule with little choice in the matter. That is not a good basis for anything at all.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “You sound exactly like my mom.”
“…Are you really using that ‘old man’ excuse again?” Steve isn’t even that old, physically-speaking.
“It’s okay,” Steve says, even though it isn’t. “You were sick–”
“No.”
“Which is…”
Steve hates it. Without the distraction of other people, he is forced to focus his full attention on Tony. He wishes any of the cocktails he had ordered had the slightest effect on his sobriety, like it clearly had on Tony, who seemed to prefer a liquid diet over any of the food.
He waits a beat, looking back at Steve, whose hand has wandered near his belt, close to his lightsaber. “What about the apprentices? The ones that haven’t made it into the Order yet.”
“Tony.”
Chester Phillips/Fidelis is an ex-gladiator and the doctores retiarii (trainer of the retiarius gladiator) of the ludus, who trains Stefanus and Bacchus.
“I’ve seen you in the baths. You could become quite popular amongst that set,” he insinuates, glancing pointedly at Suibne’s clothed groin. Suibne glares at him and shifts his thigh for better coverage. Bacchus only holds up his hands. “I do not stare, but it’s hard not to notice. Maybe one day, the rest of you will catch up to your cock.”
“It’s a shame, really,” the woman says, carefully nonchalant. “He’s a handsome one but stubborn.”
Their baby positively wails, and Tony sits back just as quickly as Steve resumes rocking back and forth to try to settle her once again.
So Antony tries to please him, to placate and compromise, not realizing he is ceding ground while Tiberius stands still in all matters.
That’s the joke. Fin. The end.
He wants
“Your punch needs work. I barely felt that at all,” he says, tapping the raised pink ASPS brand on his own right fist and then his eye. “You should put your whole body into it…” He eyes Suibne’s physique. “Though that might not be much.”
“I’m so sorry,” Rogers interjects, clearly ashamed. “That was… I– I shouldn’t have – That is to say… well…”
“Yeah. He ships out Monday.”
Steve nods, unable to meet Tony’s eye, though he does drop his hands to stare at them in his lap.
“I haven’t,” Steve insists. “I want to do this.”
“Rhodey, come on! Don’t be a dick!”
“Antony honey, you seem like a nice young man, but your former lover is a cunt,” she states bluntly. The fact that a woman could be so forward in her language shocks Antony into silence. “It is not polite, but it is the truth. He is not a good man.”
Tony sighs and rolls his eyes so hard his head lolls. “Alright, alright.” He retracts his arm to stand then gives Bruce a look, hooking his thumb back at their team leader. “Talk to you later, Brucie baby. Daddy calls.”
Master Erskine gravitates towards it, leaving Master Phillips no choice but to follow.
“It’s nothing,” he says quickly, breaking away, but it’s too late. Tony had felt–
If it got out that he liked men… Well, the consequences for someone of his wealth and social capital, while embarrassing, weren’t particularly devastating. He’ll survive, but Steve–
“Consider me a patron of the arts,” he tries again.
Rhodey even moves into one of the guest rooms in Stark Mansion. It’s only temporary, a little over a week, but it’s a bit of normalcy in Tony’s life, to have someone who knows him be around, someone from whom he doesn’t have to hide.
“No.”
“It’s just a suggestion.”
“Or carnal lust, not as the object of such but as the lover himself,” Bacchus amends. “Livia is very good; she does this thing with her tongue that can strike a man dumb.”
“Two what?”
It could have been avoided entirely if not for his affair with Antony, Stefanus thinks bitterly, but he tells Bacchus instead, “I wish it did not have to be so. Perhaps if I had stayed a retiarius–”
doing here?
It has been nearly a year since then, but the question still stands.
“Such a polite young man,” she comments.
“Kiss me again,” Steve murmurs, his lips nibbling at Stark’s jawline as the man lets out a shuttering breath. Their lips meet, sloppier this time, as one of Stark’s hands slides downwards to palm Steve’s growing erection.
“You and I both saw what he did.”
Steve pauses at the foot of his bed, his back rigid and Tony replays the words in his head and realizes his grave mistake. Before he can figure out how to fix it, how to take it back, the man is back at his side. “I do love you,” he reiterates, and something in Tony’s lungs begin to loosen, to feel a touch lighter, less painful. But then Steve continues, “Even if you’re a real dick sometimes. I don’t understand it myself, if I’m being honest. You are an insubordinate, unrepentant jerk with a God complex who’s always pushing my buttons on purpose – don’t think I haven’t noticed – and you can’t ever say anything nice to save your life. It’s like you’re allergic to sincerity, and don’t even get me started on how you–”
Stefanus wonders whether they will still bury Bacchus all the same or if he had earned a more ignoble end with his last act. If he is to be discarded, forgotten… who will provide the coin over his eyes to pay Charon for passage on the River Styx? Who will ensure a proper burial and engraving for a born slave, much less tend to his grave, clearing the weeds and leaving offerings for the nourishment of the dead? Stefanus has money enough to bribe the gravediggers and hire a stone mason to do his work. If he has to do it alone without Priscus, without the collegia retiarii, then so be it.
“She’s white.”
“Need I remind you this is not actually a vacation?”
Stark grunts as he finishes securing his cargo. “At any rate, we don’t have a choice unless you’re confident you can convince them you’re not actually here with your Jedi mind tricks.”
Tony hadn’t meant to posit himself as the neighborhood kissing expert, but he supposes if he’s in for a penny, he’s in for a pound. “Uh… Yeah, I guess it was okay. Like she was pretty good, but I’ve kissed a lot of girls since then, and they’re all pretty different, you know,” he hedges. “So, it’s hard to say.”
“Hm?”
“Since when have you ever gone easy on me?”
“Hey.” Steve says from behind him.
The Mandalorian nods. “That may be so, but it does not change anything. I took his money and gave him my word to see this mission through, and you should know a Mandalorian’s word is his bond.”
“Do I have to?” Tony never liked the piano. Unlike robotics, notes and meter didn’t come easily to him, and he is loathe to practice a skill he has little interest in developing beyond the bare minimum expected of him.
Chase.
“And if you are to flip it on its head?”
“White roses? God, that’s just so… so basic. So cliché. You’d think my body could at least come up with a better flower if it was going to up and die on me,” Tony says to no one in particular.
“Then what’s with the third degree?”
“Your form is sloppy, even for you.”
Steve and Tony escape the planet’s surface but are pursued by the newly-declared Galactic Empire.
“Okay, thanks for the drinks, but we should get going,” Steve says, nearly bodily herding Tony away from the bar.
“Dominus?”
Steve had complied, but when he passed the basket to Tony as an intermediary, Tony nearly dropped the entire thing when Steve’s fingers brushed up against his wrist. Steve had steadied the basket before it could fall.
It takes a while for Steve to adapt, but with Bucky vouching for him, the other boys eventually warm up to Steve, including him in their games and studies. He becomes a little less isolated, a little less lonely, and even though he never truly overcomes his confrontational nature when pressed, he gets better at suppressing it. In time, he even passes the Jedi Initiate Trials and is quickly chosen by Master Erskine as his padawan.
If he survives that long.
Steve mouths at the skin under his ear. “It’s okay, sweetheart,” he murmurs, because he knows it’s difficult for Tony, and if he were to try to hold off, he might not finish at all. “You can come.”
Steve sighs. “You are a very frustrating person to love; you know that?”
“Have you even tried?” Tony can tell by the look on his face that Steve hasn’t.
Steve almost rips off his buckle when reattaching the top of his uniform, but to Tony’s disappointment, he doesn’t take the bait. “I don’t know what’s gotten into you, but I’m leaving. Give me a call when you’re done being such a punk, or – baring any major personality changes – I’ll see you at the next mission.”
“Okay, it’s a date.”
Tony shrugs. “I don’t know what to tell you, Steve. Maybe you shouldn’t have pulled the alarm directly in Dr. Pym’s line of sight if you didn’t want to get in trouble. I mean… at least wait until he turned around or something.”
“He is tall and fair and bears a striking resemblance to a certain patrician, the source of your original shame. You gallivant around the city like a fawning woman on his arm,” Hadrianus grits out accusingly. “And with the exception of today, he never leaves before dawn. Do not presume it has gone unnoticed.”
And then Afghanistan happened, and he wasn’t sure his heart could take it. Literally. That was followed by the whole palladium situation. Who could think of children when one was dying? His body had become hostile territory. And then by the time he got that sorted out and Dr. Cho fixed his heart, giving him a mostly-clean bill of health, well… Tony was 42, and his window had passed. It was too late. Perhaps it had all been for the best, he had thought. He would have made a terrible parent.
That leaves Steve.
Noxii: Condemned criminals usually sentenced to die by beast in the venationes (beast hunts) or the ludi meridian (fatal re-enactments of Greek or Roman myths, such as the immolation of Hercules, the death of Orpheus at the hands of a bear, the castration and possible impalement of Attis, etc)
Tony thinks, a touch delirious, as he slips seamlessly into the black.
“Look, Stark, I’m not trying to be difficult for no reason, but every time we go out there as Avengers… there are no guarantees. I can’t say what’s going to happen next time. We get hurt; we hurt ‘em back. We get killed, we walk it off. And then we go out there the next day, and do it all over again. I’m comfortable doing that because it’s just me, but if I was an omega – and a pregnant one at that – I’m not sure I’d be comfortable putting my child’s life at risk.”
Steve is disoriented, being tossed within his harness as Stark deftly navigates between and around the fighters, firing off return blasts. They’re much smaller, more agile than his craft, but Tony has experience under his belt, and he’s able to take out three before long.
And now Dum Dum sounds uncertain, even though he had achieved his desired result. “You sure? Stevie didn’t want to interrupt your studies. Your program is very competitive; cut-throat, he says.”
“What’s wrong?” Stark inquires, having paused in removing his leather under-armor when he realized Steve hadn’t so much as taken off his tunic. “Are you having second thoughts?”
Tony kicks him in the shin, startling Cap awake, who takes one lazy look at Tony before his eyes widen in realization and he nearly catapults backward off the cot entirely, taking the sheet with him.
There’s a thundering of footsteps as Nat appears at the opening of the aisle, sliding to a stop as Bucky almost runs into her.
“He is a pattern. Priscus the Younger would boast of your proclivities, of the disgusting things you allowed him to do, and I chose to not only ignore the warning, but cover it up entirely, not because I thought him a liar but because you were young. The young are prone to thoughtless deeds, but you are a man now, and I do not think even the whore we hired for you that night taught you your…
“I would recommend wrapping it before you place it in your satchel,” Tony tells him, completely unamused, as he gingerly holds out the Golden Rod to Steve between thumb and index finger to stow away in his bag.
It would be cute if it wasn’t so frustrating.
But no. Galina had been in the weight room two nights prior, beefing up for their annual strongest Avenger competition, determined to take Steve down in the ultimate contest of skill and strength. Thor had been spotting her all evening. He had said as much the following day while they were in the guy’s own parlance ‘hurling the pig’s skin.’
“Well, he can prefer all he wants. Wiesner isn’t letting me back on campus for the next six months at least. That should be long enough to make an example out of me, so no one else attempts to do what I did,” Tony slides into the car and waits for Jarvis to get in before segueing into the meat of the matter. “A little bird told me about Ms. Sarah…”
That seems to snap Steve out of it, because he unceremoniously approaches Tony, places his hands on either side of his hips, and pushes in with all the intimacy of a gut punch. Tony gasps at the sudden intrusion, but Steve doesn’t break his stride, doesn’t deviate from the parameters set by his partner. He only fucks into him at a fast clip designed to bring their coupling to a swift conclusion, and when Tony fists his own member, jerking himself off to completion, Steve pushes him into the bed and roughly thrusts in and out, until his body stiffens then there’s a muffled cry and gush of hot fluid filling Tony’s channel and spilling over his thighs when Steve pulls out. He rolls off Tony’s body then sits up on the opposite edge of the bed to pull on his pants.
Tony curls reflexively, his knees drawn up and hands cupping his sex. “Fucking A, Cap! It’s freezing!”
“Excuse me?”
“Is it not obvious?”
“Roger that, Cap.”
Stefanus would never deny Bacchus his delights considering the man had won his fight, but he had other plans. “Perhaps another day I will join you, my friend.”
Well, almost the same.
“Believe what you want.”
The boy’s dark hair is long and softly curled while his chin and chest remain smooth, though with that muscle mass Stefanus suspects he’s older than he’s presenting himself to be, having been depilated rather than possessing the natural hairlessness of early adolescence. The boy winks in his direction, and Bacchus holds his cup aloft in acknowledgment. “Want I should call him over?”
“You understand nothing.”
Stefanus sighs and rolls onto his back to face the ceiling as he taps his forehead. “Have you ever had a friendship not predicated on what you can provide for the other person? Someone who cares not for your money or influence?”
“Still want that kiss?” he murmurs as he folds it over Steve’s eyes.
Vernae: A slave born in a household or on an agricultural estate. They had no legal fathers but were sometimes the children of free men, possibly their master (dominus). Vernae were typically treated better than other slaves, and there was more of a social obligation to take care of them.
“I am no liar.” He blocks yet another strike and manages to avoid the half-hearted net toss, dragging it away to toss to the side.
“Steve–”
“Steven!” a young woman calls out as she stamps over and boxes the child’s ear.
“Yet,” adds Dum Dum. “Steve’s been crushing on her for like two whole years. He’s even saving his first kiss for her.” He makes a kissy face, and Steve socks him in the shoulder, much to the boy’s displeasure. “What?” he says, rubbing his arm. “You don’t want Richie Rich to know you’ve never even kissed nobody?”
Steve, kissed you. You want him. He wants you, but he doesn’t believe you actually like him back in that way.”
“Fun fact: That’s not the ham. It’s salted with the tears of the pie slinger.”
Good.
paragons of virtue reliving glory days with old friends in the nursing home who need you to hold their dicks steady so they can piss straight.”
“Yeah, and uh… sorry about before. It couldn’t have been easy watching me go through all that,” Tony says. “Thanks for sticking around, because I know I can be a real pain in the ass sometimes.”
It comes back positive, a result that is further cemented by an ultrasound a couple days later when he sees the bean itself and hears its double-time heartbeat, strong and sure.
Having made the decision to proceed, Steve waves at the others, signaling them to move out. They make their way down across the parking lot towards the Home Depot where they fan out in pairs with their weapons drawn, killing the slow-moving zombies and leaving the incapacitated ones, the dried-out husks, where they lie. It would be mercy to destroy them, but they are short on time, only crushing the skulls of the precious few in their path as they approach the building. There priorities lie within.
“That’s what? Like fifty rejections? Has to be an Academy record,” Bruce comments, as he opens his locker beside Tony’s.
Steve already knows what he’s thinking. “No.”
“Are you being serious?”
“Then why doesn’t she have a name, huh?”
Steve can’t see anything, barely has room to so much as breathe, but he hears Stark and Rhodey push the table atop the hatch, metal screeching across metal followed by the sounds of the ship firing up and taxiing slowly to the nearest port. They must reach its destination in customs because the ship pauses once again, though he can still hear the faint hum of engines on standby from within his claustrophobic coffin.
Rhodey had been in charge of the initial interview, and if he had rubber-stamped a candidate, then who is he to complain when Tony actually selected said candidate. Had he had found Mr. Rogers deficient in any way, then he shouldn’t have passed him along.
would fetch. Suibne hadn’t understood the term, but he wondered if the second man regretted his intervention when Suibne had thrashed and nearly bitten him when he tried to undress Suibne for the auction block. Suibne had stilled when the blade glanced his sternum and hadn’t struggled further as the blunted end drug down his skin, slicing the scratchy shift asunder for easy removal. The blade had stopped at his sex, and Suibne had held his breath, too scared to move.
“By the Sith. The Republic… the Jedi, they fought alongside us and helped free Mandalore recently, restored our government,” Stark clarifies. “That’s part of the reason I took this job. The Jedi helped Mandalore, and so when one of them asked for a boon in return…” – another pause – “The pay wasn’t too bad either, but it isn’t the main reason. I don’t know the details of what’s going on with the Jedi Order or the Republic right now, but I have a mission, which is to deliver you to Tython, and I won’t fail.”
Steve cocks his head to the side, his smile fading. “You don’t like it?”
“I’m sure you are, Stark.”
“Who’s that?” Steve asks, pointing to a figure in red.
It doesn’t matter either way, but with nothing better to do before Stark’s friend Rhodey picks them up, Steve finds himself curious about his companion.
Stefanus is wary of Antony’s intentions when the man quietly negotiates with Priscus for exclusive privileges to his “bodyguarding” services. Though Stefanus has little say in how Antony chooses to use him, Antony tries to win him over anyway, showering him with compliments and gifts.
Stark breathes in deep. “Depends. Are you going to regret it if we don’t die tomorrow?”
“Let’s try this again, but with less commentary from the peanut gallery,” Tony begins. “Due to recent circumstances–”
“You’ve been inside me; I think I’ve earned the privilege of calling you by your first name.”
With Quinquatria soon upon them, Antony looks into Ignatius, the retiarius Stefanus is destined to fight in the arena. The man is a seasoned gladiator, a veteran of good record as Hadrianus had reported, having lost his second bout and been reprieved only to win the next fourteen. Antony can easily deduce why this may be the case. Ignatius is skilled, true, but he also has an edge, something Stefanus and many a secutor would be unprepared for…
Steve finds Dracula in the parlor room, perched imperiously upon a weathered leather recliner.
But then Steve sighs. “I’ve missed you, shellhead.”
Tony looks like he’d like to argue the point but one look at their science teacher has him backtracking. “Alright, Dr. Pym. Have it your way.”
Tony can feel Steve shudder, his Adam’s apple dip, and the next thing he knows, Steve’s hands are on his ass, and he’s lifted into the air as Steve walks them back the short distance to his bed. He spills Tony across the surface, his lips swallowing Tony’s squeak of surprise and his hips lightly thrusting between his thighs.
Stefanus doesn’t see the trident until it’s barreling towards him. He raises his curved rectangular shield yet again, blocking the attack, but falling victim to the weighted net in its wake. He falls to the ground, sweeping his leg out to take Aemilius with him mid-lunge. The trident veers off-course from his leg towards his face, catching the lip of Stefanus’s helmet, and pulling it off him entirely to the gasps of the crowd as the men wrestle on the ground. Stefanus abandons his sword in favor of staving off Aemilius’s dagger, angling his head to allow his opponent to bury it in the dirt beside his face before flipping them both over, kicking up dust and sand. They scrape and tussle until Stefanus manages to place Aemilius in a headlock, his arm squeezing against the man’s neck as Aemilius kicks out wildly, futilely, his face turning dark and near purple before he finally taps out against his opponent’s arm and the referee calls the match in Stefanus’s favor.
His surroundings are preternatural silent. There are no birds, no chittering of crickets, nor the footfalls of rabbits and other woodland creatures save the crunch of his very own.
“So… what do you think, Cap?” Tony asks him as he stands down and subtly commands the suit to descend. Cap circles the suit, inspecting his craftsmanship as Tony continues, “When it’s ready for prime time, maybe you’d like to go toe-to-toe with it; see what the suit can do?”
“I’m afraid that will not work today, Mandalorian,” a gruff voice replies. “We are looking for a fugitive, one who cannot be allowed to leave the surface.”
“Is that what gets you going?”
Tony seems vaguely disappointed at his acquiescence. “Oh darling, always the romantic. Do stop. You’re making me blush,” he deadpans before turning to face Director Fury. “Leave the announcement to me. I know just how to spin this trainwreck.”
“And yet here you are.”
There’s rustling as Bacchus carefully rearranges his own bonds and flips sides so that his head is closest to Suibne’s feet. “Where are you from, Sheev-na?” he murmurs in the dark. When Suibne doesn’t answer, he prattles on. “I hail from a villa in the countryside. Born and raised. A vernae is what I was. Before.” He hears Bacchus shift onto his side. “Do you know what a vernae is?”
In the aftermath of Stark’s revelation days before, Steve had spent quite a while thinking about the Jedi and their aversion to attachment. He always knew where he stood with Master Erskine. Though his original master had espoused many of the same beliefs as the instructors at the Academy, Steve knew the man cared about him all the same, but then again, Master Erskine cared about everyone. His attachment to Steve hadn’t been particularly specific or special. The man had compassion for all beings and cared for them equally as is appropriate for a Jedi.
“They will return to their original human forms as if none of this ever happened?” Steve presses.
“Tony–”
What would Steve look like lost in pleasure, sprawled boneless across his sheets, legs parted and shaking and skin flushed as it had been an hour prior?
Steve retracts his lightsaber, but it remains in hand. “How… how did he know what was going to happen?”
“Fratres Semper” means brothers always.
“We offer a complimentary tattoo service should you desire,” the slaver says after coin has exchanged hands. “The forehead is the conventional spot, especially for one so… unruly and prone to disobedience. I make no guarantees of the quality or length of his subservience, so caveat emptor. No returns, even if he proves a fugitive.”
And why wouldn’t he? Steve is all baseball and apple pie – polite, courteous, athletic, and straight as nails – the epitome of the wholesome all-American man and everything Tony wasn’t. Though Howard never said it outright, Tony suspected his father actually preferred Steve to him some (most) days. He certainly spent more time with Steve than his own flesh-and-blood son the past three years, not that Tony ever held it against Steve.
“Color me surprised,” he states flatly, looking anything but.
“Jim?” Tony cants his head to the side. He already knows a Jim back home – two in fact – though one goes by Jacques because he’s a pretentious asshole. This guy didn’t seem like a Jim. “How about I call you Rhodey?”
Steve sits back, his finger still thrusting into Tony as he tears open a wrapper with his teeth and the other hand, then quickly rolls it down his length.
“Sure thing.”
“Et tu, Brute?”
“Don’t encourage him.”
“Get off my fiancé,” he says more forcefully, even as Dracula refuses to let up.
“How dare you?” Stefanus recoils angrily, much to Antony’s surprise. He will not make such an enormous sacrifice to appease Antony’s misplaced jealousy; he cannot. “How dare you ask this of me? To give away what modicum of succor I have in this hell of servitude to please a man who wants for naught, who already has everything? Bacchus was there for me before you, and he will be there after you have discarded me, and yet you ask…” he closes his eyes, takes a steadying breath. “I have so little to my name. Not even… even my body is forfeit and yet you desire ever more pieces of me, what little I have left to call my own.” He drops the linen, standing nude before the man who will take everything from him. “Is this what you want? My cock? My ass? I cannot refuse you, so take it, but leave me my friend.”
He wants to tell Steve he can’t play Avengers if he’s not going to take this seriously, but then Tony will have no one else with whom to play. “Alright,
Stefanus turns away, avoids looking at the man he loves as he hurts him, uses his body. “If it is all the same to you, I’d rather not.” He loves Antony, a kind man who asks instead of orders, who is sensitive to his boundaries and history. That is who he knows Antony to be…
“But I am not here to discuss leasing gladiators for our own games,” Antony states, putting aside his cup. “I am on the market for a bodyguard, and I am looking to hire one of your gladiators for the job. You will be well-compensated, of course, and should he please me, it may turn into a more regular arrangement.”
“But–”
For his part, Stefanus’s mood is bolstered by the win, but it is quickly tempered by the realization that as a secutor, there is a chance he will one day have to go up against Bacchus with an estimated one in five chance one will be ordered to kill the other. He doesn’t like those odds, ergo he must earn enough money to get them out. Then, they will leave Rome altogether. It doesn’t matter where they end up, as long as it’s far away and peaceful without the constant threat of death. Perhaps a goat farm on a rocky disused property in some far-flung colony where their slave brands will be little more than footnotes in their history.
Stark has the gall to look perplexed. “For…?”
On the flipside, what if he’s too big with Antony’s body unable to accommodate his massive girth? He supposes the solution would be the same in either case, but he would be relying on spurious rumor for his satisfaction.
Several prospective buyers had examined him, but he had proven too small and lithe for manual labor and too malicious for other purposes.
“…Do you think me stupid or simply blind?”
Tony brings home a new woman every couple days, and Steve is always there the morning after like clockwork, offering breakfast with a side of polite conversation until Tony manages to make his way downstairs (but never managing to dodge the awkward morning-after kiss and supplication to call them later). Tony isn’t sure what Steve’s deal is. Perhaps he’s a sex-repulsed service top, only interested in aftercare and idle chitchat, or he’s trying to vet future girlfriends and hasn’t yet found Mrs. Right among Tony’s numerous and varied discarded conquests.
“Right away, sir.”
Scultimidonus: “Asshole-bestower”
Steve chokes on nothing, and hides his face in his hands as he curls in on himself and weeps. Grief is a high, piercing whine ending in a punched-out hiccough then revving up once again.
“Nuclear missiles, Tony. Innocent victims. These people must be stopped. The sooner the better.” He pulls sharply at the blankets, abruptly stripping Tony of the soft covering.
By the time they finish their drawings, Steve has produced a passably good likeness of a muscle-bound action hero wearing a skin-tight uniform in a design reminiscent of an American flag. He has real artistic talent and a true appreciation of the male form a-la-Arnold Schwarzenegger. By comparison, Iron Man is all awkward angles and weird proportions more conducive to a robot than a person.
Steve hadn’t been underselling it.
“It’s my fault,” he repeats. “I’ve wanted… for a long time, I’ve thought about it, wanted a family, the whole white picket fence dream with… I’m sorry, Tony.” He holds the baby – their baby – closer. “I’m so sorry. It’s – it’s okay if you don’t want to be involved. It’s my fault, so I’ll take full responsibility for her.” He chokes up a bit, but manages to hold himself together. “We’ll be fine. I’ve saved up enough to move out of the Tower if that’s what you need. I can raise her on my own.”
“S– stop,” Stark whispers, his protest barely audible.
Chapter title is from Horace’s Odes, specifically Ode XXVIII: “Omnes una manet nox, et calcanda semel via lethi” which means “One night awaits us all, and the path of death must be trodden once.” Night in this sense means death, and the phrase basically means everything must die. Ancient Romans believed that people went to different afterlives depending on their deeds. Warriors and heroes went to the Fields of Elysium while regular people went to the Plain of Asphodel. However, if a person committed crimes, they could be sent to Tartarus to be tortured until their debt was paid.
The body under Stefanus writhes as he thrusts in and out, the wet sound of skin against slick skin filling the unfamiliar room. His partner moans, clings to him, the needy little whimpers of
“Yeah. Yeah, it did,” and there is the truth laid bare. Tony simultaneously can’t believe it and is yet so weary to be proven right about something so damaging, so hurtful, but then Steve clarifies, “but not for the reasons you think.”
“This is nice,” he sighs, his head dropping back to rest on Stefanus’s shoulder. He tilts his chin up to face Stefanus. “A man could get used to this.”
Tony shrugs. “Alright… What kind of movies do you have?” He looks over at their TV set up, “Hey, where’s your VCR?”
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, only: “Cap, be reasonable. Where are you going to go? This is your home.”
True to his word, Steve becomes more engaged in the recreational activities the resort has to offer.
“I like having options,” Tony counters. “Besides, I saved space by not packing any nightclothes.” He smooths his palms across the bed on either side of his thighs, giving Steve a saucy wink. “It’s sweltering, and I sleep in the nude.”
Suibne throws down his trident, rips off his manica, and lunges at Bacchus as both tumble to the ground in a tangle of legs and fists.
“So, let me get this straight: We are traveling across the Atlantic by ship to reach Egypt, where we will meet up with your contact, hire a bunch of locals for the actual digging, and then break into the final resting place of their king to retrieve…” Mr. Rogers – or Steve as he had insisted on being called – pauses to look at the diagram of the artifact originally found inscribed on the walls of the tomb of their target’s father, Pharaoh Ramesses III, “his golden dildo.”
Stefanus brings his wooden sword down on Bacchus’s unprotected right shoulder, causing the man to hiss in pain and roll out his arm to ease the ache.
A quick inquiry had revealed that the ludus providing the entertainment is owned by Aegeus Servilius Priscus Structus, Tiberius’s uncle. Luckily, the man has a reputation for being a ruthless businessman unlikely to let personal or familial considerations taint his professional dealings. He could be discreet, provided Antony paid for the privilege, and Antony is more than willing to do so if it meant he could have Stefanus of Britannia for the season.
“I do not know,” Steve admits, and there lies the rub.
“Spirit only gets you so far,” Fidelis grouses. “He’s destined to be a laughingstock, derided and reviled in the arena as he prances around in a tunic with gold streamers glittering in his wake. I need men, not the lanista’s trussed-up little pusio with perfumed hair. The crowd will eat him alive.”
Sure enough, Steve answers wearing an undershirt and plaid pajama pants.
“Fat lot of good it does you. Have you ever actually tried–”
“It will pass.”
“I do
“One month five days.”
pushing him forward. Stefanus looks into those beautiful brown eyes, half-hooded with pleasure, and has never been happier, more fulfilled.
“I’ll see what I can do.”
Steve coughs, clearing his throat. “Well, you know what they say about getting a good night’s rest.”
Antony doesn’t quite remember who or what started it – if one were to ask him later, he would say it was Hadrianus – but it had ended with Antony stomping off into the brush to cool down, lest he said something he regretted. (Everything he had said to that point was perfectly fine and within bounds to his adolescent mind.)
“Stefanus?”
“I have told you to call me Antony.”
?” Steve begins, uncertain how to even broach the topic now that he has Tony’s attention. How else could he lend his support to a guy whose teacher is victimizing him if he can’t even figure out how to talk to him about the violation in the first place? “It’s just… if he’s forcing you, you know there are people who will believe and support you. You don’t have to take it.”
Clint would normally call bullshit, only… Steve looks so ashamed that the whole fiasco had been a result of a childish bet rather than the vastly-more-respectable explanation of bed-busting sex.
Tony is willing to bet he dirties up much nicer.
“While I can see how the timing could cause
“Something wrong?”
Because at the end of the day, Steve might like him more than he used to, but he will never love Tony. How could he?
“I’m going back to my room.
Steve wants the baby.
And Antony, with stars in his eyes and a fierce desire for acceptance, kisses him back.
“Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own,” Steve declines.
He may be (temporarily) confined to a physical prison, but Stark is trapped in a cage within his own mind, constrained from pursuing what he most desires. He will never escape him, even now. He will never be free of what had transpired during their time together, and when Purple Man gets out, they’ll pick up right where they left off – him and Stark – working to build that better tomorrow in a haze of purple…
But his new dominus, the man known as Priscus, demurs. “He is rather pretty, is he not? I would prefer his face unblemished so as not to spoil such beauty.” Suibne is unaccountably relieved until: “His right hand will do just as well, to remind him who he belongs to.”
“James. James Rhodes, but most people call me Jim.”
“No, I am perfectly fine,” Antony quickly replies, refusing to flee from under Tiberius’s half-embrace like the baby Tiberius always assumed him to be.
Tony waves off his concern. “Details. Irrelevant.”
And with that, he’s gone, leaving Tony naked and scowling and alone in the janitorial closet.
“Say, you about ready to go?” Steve asks, having finally placed the arrangement in the center of the kitchen table.
“You’re dead again,” Fidelis tells him, grabbing him by the shoulder and forcing him to stand straight. “I don’t know what has gotten into you, but that fancy benefactor of yours isn’t going to save you in the arena, boy. So, shape up and give Bacchus a fight he can learn from.”
Steve thinks of Dum Dum, of Jim and James and Gabe, he and Bucky’s original team from the early days of the apocalypse, when they still held out hope of beating this thing, of holding off the horde, stemming the tide of the enemy until the military could regroup and–
Other graffiti are as follows:
Purple Man claps his hands together. “So where do you want him, Tony? Over your desk? Or maybe the couch would be more comfortable.” He gazes over at the minimalist sofa, its cushions flat and perfectly boxy, not even overstuffed for effect. “Though it doesn’t look it. You think he’ll end up staining the leather?”
“Why not?”
“Oh come on, there’s always a but,” Tony nearly sneers, running his fingers roughly through his hair. “You’re upset. The fact that I had a man in my room last night upsets you.”
Master Phillips grabs him by the elbow. “Run!” he hisses.
“Look, I’m trying to cut down on dairy, and I’m not wasting my weekly allotment on what amounts to culinary blasphemy.” Tony pulls down a couple plates. “J? Call in the order. The usual, and put it under Roger Johnson.”
“Where do you think the meat grinders are? Home appliances?” Tony hazards a guess as he tags along, his eyes trained on the passing overhead aisle listings. “Is there a kitchen department?”
“I go where you go, Stark,” he explains, slipping into the man’s now-empty chair and rolling off to the side for a better view of the action.
It’s late (for Steve) when Tony knocks on his door. The man is a creature of habit; he has likely already showered and dressed for bed.
“…How about we go down to the park and maybe see if we can join a baseball game?” Steve suggests instead.
“But–”
Suibne rubs the spot and glares back but keeps mum.
“Can’t. Do. It.”
“I just thought…well…”
It is his last stand.
And adding insult to injury, he hadn’t managed to get Steve laid, not even once.
After the money and product have changed hands, and he’s walking away, his companion Master Erskine informs him, “You could have talked him down to sixty-five.”
And in that short timeframe, Steve had had over three dozen partners, and never the same one twice, not that he wanted to disclose that to Tony. So he tells him instead, “I think it’s still better to be safe. Not that I don’t trust you” –Steve isn’t the one who has to worry about getting sick; he’s
?” Bucky asks.
Unfortunately for Tony, reality is not pornography, and the twins are not conducive to sharing. He had only earned himself a slap and iced soda poured in his lap at the suggestion.
Perhaps if he stayed very, very quiet–
Steve curses then pulls at the belt holding his robes together, quickly wrapping it around his eyes and securing it with a knot behind his head. “Better?”
“That wasn’t a no.”
“All of them. They’re even rounding up the younglings. Nearly everyone with so-called Force sensitivity.”
“Steven.”
“What of this one?” Bucky asks, scratching rolling hills side-by-side with a stick in the dirt.
“Brock started it!”
“Not a problem, but the next bed will be steel-reinforced, so the only issue will be the mattress if you want to try again.”
Steve concurs. “Yeah, your dad and I patched things up.”
“So what? I have my bachelor’s already. I could walk into Raytheon next week and land myself a job.”
…Tony was never supposed to fall in love with him.
Like Steve hadn’t lost the people who raised him, likely many if not all of his friends, and his entire future in a matter of days. Steve is momentarily at a loss for words.
“It is not too late to build your own legacy, my dear Anthony.”
Antony’s face twists into one of anger and more than a little shame. “Because a man who owns his own body will not stoop to share it with another in that way, at least not in the bright light of day.”
His father returns, but his mother’s ailment doesn’t subside. Instead, it grows in frequency and severity over the next nine months, until she’s breathless and nearly choking on half-formed daffodil blooms every day. Dad isn’t around – too busy with Stark Industries to be home – but Tony is. He hears her fail to catch her breath, watches her waste away, her skin pallid and nearly grey under her concealer. His father thinks she’s watching her figure as women are wont to do, but Tony knows better. And so, he searches libraries, poring over books and medical journals until he identifies the culprit: Hanahaki’s Disease, a vanishingly rare disorder caused by unrequited love in certain genetically-predisposed individuals. He makes copies of everything he can find on the condition and then sets out to confront his father.
S-T-E-V-E / S-T-E-V-E / S-T-E-V-E
Two months pass, and his mother is coughing. Her lips are red, and the color coats her teeth and dribbles out the corners to be wiped away in crimson smears that ruin her foundation. There are large yellow petals mixed with blood and phlegm in the tissue she tosses into the toilet.
There’s a grumble followed by a low “Fuck you, darling,” but Tony exits less than ten minutes later.
Suibne tips his head forward then sharply up, butting the buyer’s nose in a gush of red, just as his seller yanks the chain connected to his iron collar, choking him as he falls to the ground.
“Oh… well sometimes the truth stings.”
Stark hums. “That’s true, but I was thinking… well… can I be honest with you?”
Stefanus knows the truth of his words. Still–
The last thing Tony needs is commitment. He can’t even commit to a regular sleep schedule, much less a whole other human being.
That was the last thing his father will ever say to him.
“I think I’m gonna pass on that, honeybear.”
Bucky frowns. “Your choices are ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS. We don’t get the fancy British channels here.”
As slaves, Steve and Bucky are going to be referred to as “boy” by other characters throughout the fic, regardless of their actual age. In Ancient Rome, a puer (boy) referred to either free male children or male slaves of any age. A slave was never considered a “real man” (vir) and would be referred to as “puer” (boy) as they age.
would even look like, the aggressive blonde holding him down, tearing off his clothing as Tony weakly tried to protest, to beg off and retreat to the safety of a highly-populated school event. Would Tony like that, for the other party to take charge? Is that something Steve should try? Or would Tony be frightened that someone so much larger and stronger could easily box him in and take what they wanted from him?
Rhodey is blasé. “Not in the physical sense. Nothing that Jarvis can’t handle, anyway.”
Tony gives him a loose one-armed shrug. “Well, nobody’s perfect,” he says, moments before vomiting all over the man’s sneakers.
, and masturbation is better than taking Tony up on one of his many,
Tony rolls his eyes as he draws a finger down the condensation gathering on the outside of his glass. “Oh please. Aren’t you supposed to be my big strong man on this little trip?”
It takes them two weeks.
Tony leans up against the counter. “I didn’t know you had a two-bedroom,” he says, peering down the hallway where he counts four doors: one for a bathroom, one for a hall closet, and two at the end that he presumes are for bedrooms.
Fuck.
“No, it’s not!” Tony exclaims in frustration. “Why do you have to be such a sourpuss about this, sourpatch?”
Mr. Rogers seems relieved at that. “I have to say I’m surprised. When I answered the ad, I didn’t expect
And with that, Stefanus escorts Antony out of the party and back to his villa. The fresh air must have reinvigorated the man’s libido because once again, he asks for Stefanus to guard his body from within his chambers. Stefanus has barely secured the door before Antony is removing his toga and lounging across his bed in such a way to be alluring, his cock plump and half-hard with anticipation.
“No, it’s a real thing. We use the Force.”
“Such a nice girl. Cold and ruthless,” Dracula takes a sip from his goblet. “Unattached as well.”
And if he and his team thought about it too hard, if they gave more consideration to the people the zombies had been rather than the reality of what they are now–
“I don’t see how that’s relevant.”
Antony jabs Romulus with his elbow. “Take a look at that one, the blond who lost his helmet. What was his name again? Stefanus?”
Steve places a hand on his knee. “That’s still two days away, isn’t it?” He slides up his thigh, looking over at Stark’s impassive helmet and trying to imagine the expression of the man underneath.
They are broken, and whatever hopes of reconciliation Antony had entertained are now dashed. There is no coming back from this, no undoing the damage, not this time.
“Hey, Captain America is cool,” he protests, putting his drawing next to Tony’s. “He’s an American hero who punches Nazis, because there’s nothing more American than punching a Nazi, or that’s what my Bubbe always used to say.”
“…Okay,” Steve says slowly.
On the appointed day, Tony dresses down, dons a pair of sunglasses and a nondescript hoodie, and takes the subway then a cab paid in cash to get to his shrink’s office.
“You should get dressed, patatino. Mr. Morelli will be here soon,” she tells him as she carefully fixes her makeup with a moistened Q-tip.
Steve grasps either end of the towel, pulling it taut across the back of his neck. He shrugs. “You’re looking mighty sore, and I’m just saying, you could have made it happen if you focused on one.”
And so, he cuddles up next to Steve, faced away so Steve can kiss the back of his neck and along the plane of his shoulder.
“I have hired Julia to… show her appreciation, if you would like that,” Antony explains, “but only if you desire to partake, and she will be paid either way.”
“It’s just… with his fair hair and that face… Need I remind you of what transpired last you took a shine to another like him? Your father spent a small fortune to keep that scandal out of the public eye, and you are older now. No longer a youth where such… indiscretions may be excused as boyish folly.”
“Tones?” is the tentative reply.
, likely written as a warning to either party. Antony knew the wisdom of that one all too well and sought to never stick his dick in crazy (or more accurately, to never let crazy stick his dick in him), not after the first time.
“You know, I’ve been reading up about the mummy’s curse,” Steve whispers softly as they carefully approach what has to be the antechamber. “’All people who enter this tomb who will make evil against this tomb and destroy it, may the crocodile be against them in water, and snakes against them on land. May the hippopotamus be against them in water, the scorpion on land.’ That’s what they found in the pyramids.”
Peristylium: An open courtyard in the center of a Roman house
“Less talking, more assisting,” Tony says as he exits the burial chambers back into the antechamber.
“But it’s been two years!” Tony exclaims.
Tony thinks there might be something wrong with his new friend. “Okay. Fine. Whatever,” he concedes. “His name can be Red Skull.”
“Hey you!” Tiberius calls out to him. “You there, boy!”
“I know what I have,” Tony grouches, his brows drawn together and mouth twisted into a sour expression. “Cap can’t help me.”
“You are worried for your friend, the Barnes boy. You are afraid you will lose him,” Master Phillips says, and for a minute, Steve thinks maybe he understands, but then he continues, “You should not. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. Attachment – the desire to hold onto something – can lead you to take more extreme measures to keep it. You must let go of these desires, accept that all things pass away eventually.”
And now Suibne turns over completely onto his back, sitting up to face the other boy. “Did you mean it before?”
Stefanus thinks of Bacchus’s mother. What promises had her dominus made? What private arrangement had they had before he married another and sold her and their son off to parts unknown? Stefanus doesn’t think Antony would be so cruel, but then again, Bacchus’s mother probably didn’t think her dominus would be either.
Stark seems to reconsider his statement. “I didn’t mean that,” he says, “I know you’ve lost, you’ve suffered, and grief isn’t a contest.” He momentarily pauses, withdrawing from the bowels of the ruined ship to turn and lean against its hull, sliding down to the dust. “It’s just… we made mistakes, but we had just gotten it back. Mandalore, that is. The rebels won with the Republic’s backing, and now that same Republic has betrayed us.”
They don’t talk about it again, about what Tony had said when he was a vulnerable child, but Steve makes it a point to compliment Tony on his resourcefulness and his contributions to the Avengers when merited. And later, when Tony is cleaning out his boxes of forgotten childhood memorabilia, he comes across a picture of the costume he and his mother had made one Halloween when he was nine. He’s wearing the Captain America star and stripes she had sewn him, a makeshift shield in hand and broad smile across his face.
The stranger side-steps him. “How about not. You’re like fifteen.”
“It’s all my fault,” Tony hears. He is surprised when the words don't come from his lips, but rather from Steve, who looks absolutely miserable, on the verge of tears even.
“Maybe tomorrow, honeybear. Got a new missile launcher for you, but I’m still adjusting it. I think it’s a bit much.”
“Hear me out before you refuse, Stefanus,” Bacchus is saying after Stefanus’s first bout in the ring against a more experienced secutor had ended in defeat, with the editor having spared his life. “We can go halves on the fair Livia for the hour. She does not mind.”
“But we can figure it out, right?”
I couldn’t figure out how to work this in, but one of my favorite ancient graffito (in addition to the examples from the last chapter) that was actually found in the gladiator barracks at Pompeii is: “Floronius benefac miles leg VII hic fuit neque mulieres scierunt nisi paucae et seserunt,” which means “Floronius, privileged soldier of the 7th legion, was here. The women did not know of his presence. Only six women came to know, too few for such a stallion.”
