Tony narrows his eyes. “Is that because he thinks that I might kill someone else, or because he thinks that I might do something to myself?”
“You’ll have scars,” Tony comments, pressing the tea towel to each wound, cleaning it of blood and any dirt that might have tracked inside.
To paraphrase Cersei Lannister, it is his fucking turn in the sun, and everyone else can go suck it.
felt like you were doggin’ her footsteps. No, as long as you’re alive, you’re a threat to her, and who knows when you might decide to go back on your generosity, like using your company to fucking blackmail her into meeting with you today.”
“You left me alone,” Tony says, lifting his eyes to catch him in a terrible glance. “You… you walked out of the house constantly, each day, at dawn, and you didn’t show up until midnight, and you missed… you missed everything, and you left me alone, with the kids, you left me to take care of them; you took advantage of the fact that I wanted to be with them, and you decided that you could back out of all of your responsibilities. You did that,
Steve nuzzles at his throat, his teeth finding Tony’s shoulder, and his fingers prod at Tony’s rim. He slides in with ease, and Tony makes a soft, pleading sound, lifting up onto his knees. The pressure is filling, satisfying, and soothes the cramping in his belly, and Steve slides another finger in, watching Tony’s face with keen interest, his thumb rubbing at his perineum.
Natasha shrugs. “I will never apologise for having my friend’s best interests at heart, Tony,” she tells him, her voice sharpening around the edges of the words. “It’s the same reason why I gave him those pictures of you and the Winter Soldier. I thought you were cheating on him, and he deserved to know.”
Tony is surprised, but he thinks his face manages it well, remains gracious even though his stomach is churning with nausea.
“All we wanted to do after that is have you grow up normal, put this behind you, Tony,” she says, earnestly.
Tony tries three different outfits before he settles on a black t-shirt and a pair of jeans that make his ass look great – Steve, despite wanting to pretend otherwise, is definitely an ass man.
Steve had forced another pill down his throat, one to sober him up rapidly, and when he wakes up next, he’s more alert. He realises quickly that he’s tied up, his hands knotted behind his back, and there’s Steve, sitting opposite him.
“And I do have a job,” Tony reminds her, slyly. “I can’t believe that you forgot that I was the CEO and Chairman of the Board for a multi-billion-dollar company.”
Steve shakes his head, his face vicious and determined. “No, you’re wrong. You’re wrong, Tony. I did want you. I
me.” He shakes his head, the blood like a fever in his face. “When you were possessive before, it was because you wanted me,
After a while, his lungs start to burn in protest, and he’s forced to rise desperately through the dark water. When there is no further to go, his hand and his head only hit solid rock, no real air. He feels along with the ceiling of rock, finding nothing. Everything is submerged.
, but it was necessary for him to fly down in an arc and land on the ground, in front of Steve, just as Natasha climbs to her feet and rushes over.
Tony flicks a hand in his direction, dismissively. “I’m done with this conversation. I’m really tired, Steve, and I’d like to go to bed. Conversations don’t just happen when you
Tony hushes him, curling a hand around the nape of his neck. “It’s okay, baby. You can fuck me now. Fuck me
to think, because the rightful alternative is to blame themselves for their incompetence and their reckless behaviour and their selfishness.
Shame suffuses in a deep colour in his face, and he runs his tongue between the seam of his lips. “You’re right. I’m sorry. That was selfish of me,” he says, quickly, padding over, after he’s closed the door behind him, and sinking into the uncomfortable hospital chair that has only minimal cushioning.
Ms Lewis nods. “I saw the newspaper articles, you know, about the circuit boards and the engines and the guns.”
That only makes Steve grin harder. He reaches up and smooths a thumb over his cheekbone. “That’s ‘cause you’re mine,” he muses. “You like what I do to you in this bed, don’t you?”
So, how can he possibly tell Rhodey any of this, confide in him, when Rhodey has so much more important things to deal with and think about instead of Tony’s stupid marital problems?
Obadiah clutches the door to the heater for dear life, and when Tony brings it down again, he lashes out with his claws, slicing the shovel in half. The metal edge tumbles to the ground, and Tony stares at it, stunned, for a moment, long enough for Obadiah to lunge for him, taking him down to the ground.
His fingers withdraw from Tony’s body, and the hand that was on his cock, wet with pre-come bands around Tony’s throat.
to that. You made me anxious and scared and I was constantly looking out for you, trying to find out what you were doing, what lies you were telling me, what secrets you were keeping from me, and I was… I was terrified at first at the idea that you might have found someone else, and it made me second-guess what I thought about myself, whether I was attractive or kind or a good father or a good husband or a good cook or good at sex or whether I wasn’t keeping a clean home or whether I was expecting too much out of you or whether there was some fucking need of yours that I wasn’t satisfying. And it was all
“That’s my boy,” Steve says, with that savage, possessive edge that makes Tony want to come right the fuck now.
Each night, he dreams of Steve, the time they spent together in New York, wrapped up in each other, bodies pressed together, naked and hungry and warm, and everything is perfect, everything is what he wants, and when he wakes up, he remembers that Steve isn’t there, that Steve is missing, that Steve might be dead, and he’s vomiting all over again.
,” he snarls, his voice heavy with hurt. So, I call bullshit on you being tired. I don’t care if you actually
“Adrenaline, a couple of syringes, just in case,” Steve reassures. He squeezes Tony’s shoulder. “I love you, you know? Nothing he did to you will ever change that, and because I know of your propensity for guilt, I don’t blame you for this, for anything that’s happened. This guy is evil, and he needs to be taken down. That’s it. Nothing else.”
“Yeah, uh, Steve thinks that a friend bought it for me. Sometimes, the kids play with it,” Tony says, his hands fluttering in the air awkwardly.
This chapter continues in the same vein. They will not sort things out yet. This is like Part 2 to their argument, but it gets better in the sense that they actually get some things out, especially Tony.
He sees a pair of grey eyes, the slow lick of a smile, indulgent and soft, and the shame pools thick in his chest, because that’s a lie.
“The guy from my dream the night before,” Tony says, smacking his lips to rid himself of the dryness in his mouth, like sawdust. “The guy in the dirty sweater, with knives for hands, the same guy that Pepper saw in her dream as well. He stalked me through the boiler room, cornered me in this alcove sort of thing, and he was, he was about to kill me, and I burned myself on one of the pipes; it was so hot that I burned myself, and I woke up in the middle of class and look–”
“Don’t you dare fucking move,” he tells him. “You keep spreading it okay. I’m not done looking my fill.”
Tony yawns, silently. He quietens, burrowing closer to the desk, when the teacher’s eyes angle on him.
“I think he took it well, to be honest,” she says, wistfully. “I think I’m going to fail in getting him into a tux, though.”
“I never wanted your marriage to reach the state that it did, and if I played a part in that, and I know I played a part in that, I’m sorry, Tony. I’m really sorry.”
Steve’s hand fits against his cheek. “You have friends here, you know? There is no need for you to think that you have to do all of this on your own. You are a most competent omega, Tony, but even you require rest.”
“Maybe she just associated you with the change. It was you that she caught, remember? Besides, maybe she thinks that you’re strong, that you don’t need to be with someone at night, and maybe she thinks her father is weaker, that he needs you there.”
James sighs. He grabs Tony suddenly by the waist and moves him bodily to the side. “Let me do this, would you?”
Tony shrugs. “He didn’t have any family members. His parents were both dead. He didn’t have any brothers or sisters. I was the closest and only thing he had to a friend. And when he died, he left me everything. It left me only minutely richer than I already am,” he says, dismissively. “I went to the funeral.
James’ mouth twists, not a smile but close. “Agreed.” He sighs. “She’s been following me. I think she was waiting outside my apartment the whole time; she probably saw you come over, me go to your house,” he says, apologetically.
“I rubbed my cock all over you, and you didn’t say a word,” he says, his voice smooth like a slow honey drip. “I touched your thigh, and you didn’t say a word. I told all kinds of stories about what I liked to do to all of those omegas in the brothel, and you walked on by, and this morning, I fucked that peasant boy right in front of you until I came, didn’t take my eyes off you for a second, and you didn’t attack me to defend your precious propriety. Don’t tell you that you are a most chaste omega, Tony. You have shown yourself to be quite the opposite.”
“Listen to me, your Daddy and I love each other very much, and we love you very much. That is all you need to know. That is all you need to believe, okay?” he soothes.
Steve considers him. “That’s what you think? That you were this… innocent little victim, and I screwed you over to get my dick in you?” he asks, incredulously, his voice thin with his own hurt.
we were. I went to college at fourteen because I’m a genius, and geniuses don’t stay in high school when they learned the entire high school curriculum at seven.” He looks away. “I had one friend. Rhodey. And my life
. You broke my heart. That is all I know. You broke my heart, and you gave my father all he needed to break it further, and you have the nerve to come back to my door, after all of these years, after I have attempted to move on from the raging whirlwind that is Steve Rogers, get me caught up in some Nazi plot, destroy the home that I had built for myself, and drag me into all of this, and then, after we’ve fucked as a way of me putting you away for
“It was really great sex,” James says, wistfully. “You know, until you, I’ve never had sex before,” he tells Tony, “at least that I can remember,” he adds after a moment.
And then, Steve had growled, a fearsome, terrifying thing, and he’d punched the frat boy in the face, and then, his friends jumped Steve, and then, Steve’s friend, Sam, was getting involved, and suddenly, before he even knew what he was doing, Tony was breaking a beer bottle on the edge of the bar counter and jumping into the fray.
“Come on, Howard,” Maushmi rebukes. “We have raised him well. He might have some… odd pursuits for an omega, but it’s nothing that an alpha would baulk at once they see Stark Industries coming along with him. This would be a good opportunity for him. Who knows, he might be able to find a good alpha officer that will like him, odd pursuits and all? We shouldn’t risk this opportunity.”
Howard hits a button. The Cadillac rises, floating in thin air as though controlled by an otherworldly force.
Maushmi nods, resting her head against Steve’s shoulder. “We have an open day tomorrow,” she explains, excitedly.
The knife-edge of suspicion digs its way like some dark, awful parasite that wants to eat him whole.
“Okay, fine,” Steve says, heavily. “I can accept that. I can accept that I looked at those photos of the two of you and came to the wrong conclusion, just like you did. I’m
“It worked on my systems. As far as I understand, the code that the man used has not been used in many years,” JARVIS says, slowly.
He sounds agonised, tormented, and he’s fisting his hands in his golden hair, tight against the scalp, like he wants to tear the strands from his head, and go lower, raking bloody lines down the length of his face.
It’s an uncomfortable maneuver, but he manages to climb on top of the pilot’s prostrate body and slide through the window, gripping onto the edges of the cockpit door.
abide it. But I can’t promise you that it is something that can change, the way that I feel, the way that I look at you, my fear, my disgust for myself, anytime soon. It wouldn’t be fair to you to stand here and promise that all was well, that I was ready to be your omega in every way, that I wanted to have children with you.”
“I can’t believe that’s all you think that our relationship was,” James says, practically vibrating.
“Hey,” Bucky said, softly, and his fingers prodded against the underside of her chin so that she would look at him. “We love your son.”
Antonia Stark wants him, wants to be with him and love him and have sex with him, Steve Rogers, with his asthma inhaler and body that looks like a good fall would break all the bones on his body and a set of lungs and a heart that makes walking up a flight of stairs painful.
Tony hangs on to the top three feet, all that remains above. The forward movement of the submarine continues, but, to Tony’s slowly dawning delight, the dive stops. No more of the periscope goes under.
“Drop it down here,” Steve advises, motioning towards the nearest side cabinet in the corridor, filled with ceramic vases and strange potted plants and framed drawings that the kids made at school.
“I think I know why you don’t want to believe me,” he murmurs, “and I want you to know that any girl, any boy,
“You fucking… did you think I’d be okay with it?” he demands. “Did you think I’d just smile and bear it, like the poor, put-upon house husband, you fucking prick? Did you think I’d just be
“Uh…” Tony drawls, mulling the question over. “If you don’t mind, I can tell you what I see with them?”
Suddenly, Steve is moving, moving like a predator and backing James up against the cabinets. He crushes his mouth to James’ with bruising force, and Tony watches as a switch is flicked on inside James, as he moans and clutches at Steve, as if desperately keeping him pressed against James’ body, as if he’s scared that this isn’t real, as if Steve isn’t real and this isn’t actually happening.
The sound is damp in the room, heavy with it, the lube making squelching sounds every time Steve thrusts his fingers inside Tony’s body. Steve’s eyes are centred on the way that Tony’s rim looks strained around his knuckles, the blood hot in his face.
“Well, it isn’t in the first one. And in the second and third, to be fair, you can’t get drunk on mortal liquor, and I have built up a heavy tolerance after decades of being a lush.”
, and it’s been such a struggle, and his head’s felt like underwater for months, muted and decaying slowly, and now, he feels whole, he feels like he can smile and have it not be a lie to make someone else feel better.
“No, no, get some sleep,” Steve says, yawning. “We need sleep, now that there’s no creepy child molester trying to kill us in our dreams.”
Tony bristles. “You don’t get to say that to me. You don’t know me. You don’t know our marriage. You don’t know
Tony starts backing away as James stalks towards him, all of that hard muscle under his skin, those long, gorgeous lines of his body, and then, he’s hitting the wall with a dull thud, his palm flattening to keep him on his feet, as James crowds him against the wall, not so close that he feels that he can’t leave but not so far away that Tony would lose sight of the point that he’s making.
Tony makes a sound, fluttering his hand through the air, as the colour rises high in his face. “You’re just saying that because I’m willing to help you commit a number of felonies,” he says, embarrassed.
“Also in the vein of being such a good boyfriend, maybe we could go and try out that thing you mentioned with the vibrator this mornin’?” Steve says, waggling his eyebrows.
spread their legs for me. You have no allies here, Tony. Only me; let me do what I want with you, and I swear, on my honour, that I will protect you.”
“I understand,” Tony says, softly, tangling their hands together for a fleeting moment, before he withdraws it. “So, Natasha-”
Maybe he’d surrendered any value he may have had as an omega to an alpha who wouldn’t want him as anything more than a bed partner.
Maybe something would be different in their marriage today if Tony had seen him like this, seen him less like a monument and more like a man.
He dreams of Tony, dreams of them dancing in the living room of the lake house, the sunlight edging in through the window, flooding them in gold, fitting together like puzzle pieces, Tony’s mouth humming against the pulse point in Steve’s throat.
But the others, the other parents, who circle the three like hungry predators, waiting to sink their ugly, sharp claws into whatever new scandal that Tony might present to them, they’re the ones that have the problems. They titter when they think that Tony’s back is turned, make insidious little comments about Steve being a cuckolded husband and James being the pool boy that Tony fucks every now and then. They complain about James being around the kids, as if Tony is a bad parent for allowing such things, and they unfortunately make some stupid remark about how
“Okay, this is going to end badly,” he says, his stomach rolling and tumbling, and he’s halfway certain that he’s going to vomit up the contents of his gut.
He doesn’t even have time to process what’s about to happen to him before they are wrapping their hands in his hair, pushing his head down with a firm palm to the nape of his neck, and his head is going into the water.
Steve looks a little uncertain. “I don’t know if this is a good idea. I mean, Tony, people might talk.”
“And the kids are gone because of me,” James says, his expression solemn and strained. “It’s my fault, no one else’s.”
Tony purses his lips, the air looming stagnant in his lungs. “I had to talk to them about it,” he whispers, “about the photos, what we found. I had to ask them. They said that, well,” he clears his throat, “they said that they hid it for my own good, that they wanted me to live my life without what he did to me hanging over my head, that they killed him because they wanted real justice and because he deserved it, pretty much everything that I thought they’d say.” He purses his lips. “Well, I suppose it all would have worked out if Obadiah didn’t come back from beyond the grave in our dreams to kill us all,” he says, dryly. He shakes his head. “Did you get the stuff?”
The next morning, Tony awakes to the news that the lord’s brother’s brother has been found in one of the village brothels, with his throat cut open from ear to ear.
“-and I don’t need to hear any more because I already know what’s going to happen next,” James says, thin and taut at the edges.
Tony stares at him for a moment and turns his head. “I’m done here,” he says, definitively, grabbing his clothes from where they litter the ground.
James makes a disgusted noise at the back of his throat. “It was my fault,” he grumbles. “I wasn’t paying as good attention as I should have been.”
Steve grins, just for a moment, switching the vibrations higher. The resounding sensation makes Tony yelp and seize up, hand fisting in the sheets like he wants to escape the vibrator and Steve’s hold.
me that, and I… I…” Steve deflates, the hurt bleak on his handsome features, “don’t think I could’ve done it, Tony, don’t think I could’ve been with you like that.”
“It’s you, just you,” Tony gasps out, digging his teeth into the muscled curve of Steve’s shoulder, raking his nails down his back. “God, Steve, you’re the only one who can do this to me, I swear. I could never have this with anyone else.”
is a kind man; he loves me, and he loves my children, and he’s made a family with me, all of these years. If it wasn’t for him…” he shakes his head, “you don’t know what it was like for me, after you left,” he admits, grudgingly. “You don’t know what it was like. I felt like a fucking ghost, wandering the streets, waiting for something to ground me before I floated away and ceased to exist, and yeah, that sounds fucking sentimental and total bullshit, but that’s what I felt like. For fuck’s sake, James, you dumped me after fucking me-”
Tony lifts his head and twists it to look over his shoulder, only to find Steve standing there, sweat dampening at various spots all over his front, from his run.
Maybe there will be one day where he can look at Natasha and talk to her and not immediately think of all the times that he imagined Steve losing himself in her beautiful body, her unburdened shoulders, her white skin, her lack of children and responsibilities, all the awful things that he’d thought about himself and his appearance and his inability to hold Steve’s interest.
The next day, Tony climbs out of a cold bed only to find that Steve has already left. The bathroom is still sweltering hot after the shower that Steve must have taken, the glass all muggy, and the toothpaste cap is off and lying on one corner of the benchtop. Tony glares down at it and puts it back on after he’s finished brushing his teeth.
He comes around the other side of the table to embrace her, to bring her smaller body against his chest.
“Now, all the omegas in the crowd would know how hard it can be putting on makeup in a car that’s bouncing like a kangaroo on a trampoline,” he drawls. “What if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile wouldn’t touch the ground at all?”
Tony nods. “You know, my parents were still alive when Steve and I got together. They met him, they even liked him. My mother, who hated the idea of me with a boy, a white boy at that, loved him. My father loved him, even more than he loved me. But yeah, Steve knows, he knows what my father did to me, what my ex-boyfriend did to me. He knew all of it.”
…” he trails off, shaking his head. “I didn’t pay as much attention to it as I should have; now, I know why… I know why he was like that.”
“None of that is… that’s not true, none of it is,” Steve protests. “Fucking hell, Tony, I am not sleeping with Natasha or anyone else
The moment stretches taut, and Tony waits, waits for a reaction, waits for anger, for tears, something which he could deal with, because Tony always works better with something to deal with – he’s also a dramatic person himself, with terrible floods of emotion, and if Steve was like that too, it would be easy to deal with.
“We’ll clean it up before they can see it, unless you were planning to let them sleep somewhere other than their rooms tonight?”
“We were just introducing ourselves to your omega,” Lady Natasha says, her green eyes flashing, as she gives Lord Steven a smile, one that has a lot of teeth.
Toni makes a soft noise of disgust, before it morphs into something high-pitched, that might actually become a shriek if she opened her mouth.
Sam considers him, carefully, and then, the lines of his face, the lines around his eyes in particular, soften.
Is this it? Is this where she tells him that she’s sleeping with his husband and that they’re planning on running away together so he should get used to the idea of being used-up and alone and a single parent for the rest of his life?
When they pull him out, he promptly throws up the lining of his stomach, because it’s not like there’s anything else in there. He pants, loudly, a high-pitched wheeze to every breath he takes, as he claws desperately for more air.
Tony takes a deep breath and starts waving his torch at the nearest edge of the circle of safety that they’ve found themselves in, as Steve continues his slow turn.
He picks up a brick from the ground and throws it as hard as he possibly call through the window, startling Steve.
For a second, he can feel Steve’s surprise, his mouth slack under his, but then, a groan rumbles through him, rumbles against Tony, and he kisses back, firm and gentle in equal measure, dry and without skill, as though he has not kissed many people – Tony would prefer it that way, would prefer an alpha who is as inexperienced as he is.
Pepper gnaws on her lower lip, and with great lack of enthusiasm, she unbolts the door and pulls it open, revealing Lord Steven standing on the other side, his eyes on the ground, one foot turned up to the ceiling. He lifts his eyes, and Tony is struck by the resolute look in his pale eyes.
The silence turns sticky, the longer it goes without Steve saying anything and Tony saying anything, neither of them willing to give an inch at all.
“Rude,” Tony huffs. His eyes light up. “We could do the anal train; you both could DP me, but I have to pick up the kids later, and if we do that, I might not be able to sit down; of course, that’s easily solved by either of you picking them up. I could suck off one of you, while the other fucks me. What’s your poison?”
Tony is livid; he feels the jagged, primal rage rip through his body, until he’s seeing red, red, red.
“Then, the gem and some of us are going up in a big bang. I don’t think Hitler would like that a bit. Now, I don’t want to talk about this anymore. Show me, Rogers, in five seconds or-”
That’s how James comes, and he pulls off just in time to have streaks of come hit his cheek, his nose, his lips. Tony pauses, and the come sliding down his cheek in a filthy line. Some of it, he can taste on his tongue, and James tastes exactly how Tony remembers from that one blissfully hot night they shared together, tasting of salt, warm and full, and he fastens his mouth around James’ cock to catch the last few dregs of his orgasm, as James pulses in his mouth, thick and slow.
“Yeah, you are,” Steve snarls. “I look at you, and you just can’t help yourself, can you, sweetheart? You’d spread your legs in an instant if I just gave you the fucking signal. If I touch you, you’re on fire, aren’t you? You have my name, you have my children. You couldn’t
He knows that fact like he knows any other true thing in the universe: the grass is green, the sky is blue, water is wet, humans evolved from apes, and Tony Stark loves Steve Rogers.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony says, sternly. “But to answer your question, Abraham is a gifted, intelligent man; his intellect is quite incomparable, but there are certain areas where his intellect can be compared, and it is me who eclipses him. So, he came to me, and I asked my sire, who absolutely did not want me to come, but my bearer is quite confident that I might find an officer or two here that might be willing to bond with me.”
The alpha from the fair has a name, and his name is Steven Grant Rogers, from Brooklyn, as Abraham explains.
“He has but a brother, a twin brother, I hear,” Pepper tells him. “Not as skilled with a sword as Lord Steven is, but sharper with his tongue. His brother acts as his castellan and in charge of the castle and the lands while Lord Steven is away at war. His mother and father are both dead. He has a few friends that he trusts, all of them knights at his hand. But you would not be walking into an established family.”
That night, at dinner, Grant hands him a glass of wine, and there’s a glint in his eyes that tells Tony exactly what’s going to happen when the castle falls asleep.
At first, the water just tastes stale, and then, he tries to get up, get out, because his lungs start to burn, protesting the lack of air, but they hold him down. There are four of them, and only one of him, and so, he can’t seem to dislodge them.
“Besides, do either of you have a sane explanation for what your so-called friend did to Pepper?” Howard prods.
that I thought that about you, that you were capable of doing that to me, but… you still lied to me. Is it really just because you didn’t want me to think the worst of you and Bucky or-”
“No one’s going to kill you,” Tony insists. “Just… turn yourself in. I’ll get you a lawyer. A good one.”
The pain is like nothing that Tony has ever felt, even worse than being cut up in a cave in Afghanistan, with strangers’ hands removing parts of his chest cavity to make room for an electromagnet, worse than palladium poisoning and the arc reactor being removed from him against his will and going through a wormhole into space and having a parking lot full of cars dropped on his head and trying to stop Sokovia from falling and fighting Steve and Barnes in Siberia.
He boils water for the noodles, and he hears footsteps behind him. He looks over his shoulder, slanting a warm smile at Steve.
When it is securely placed inside, they hear an ominous marching sound, and nine armed Nazis appear at a trot from between some tents and climb into the back of the truck with the gem. Behind the water barrels, Tony and Bhim exchange hapless looks, but Steve just concentrates on the sight in front of him, his mile working a mile a minute.
“Wait, wait,” Steve soothes, grabbing onto his hand. “Even if you could pull this off, and I ambush him when he shows up... you have to go to sleep to make this work.”
Steve twists his head to look at him, and there’s colour in his face, and his face is pinched thin, like he’s in pain.
“Or… counter proposal, you can come in for coffee, and we can start watching Friends? All the seasons are on Netflix.”
, Steve. He didn’t say any of that. In fact, he’s made it fucking clear that nothing like that happened between us. What more do you
“I am so happy,” she says, her voice thick, barely biting back the sob that rises in her throat. “because I have you, and I have Steve and Bucky, and I have Uncle Rhodey and Aunt Pepper and Uncle Bruce, and I have all of these amazing friends. I am so happy, Peter. You don’t need to worry about my happiness.”
He leaves the bathroom, clearly going to get things ready in Tony’s bedroom. Tony wraps the towel around his waist, pinning it at his hips, and clambers to his feet, looking at himself in the mirror above the sink. He opens the cabinet underneath the sink, beginning a quick, furtive search until he can close his hand around the stash of Adderall that he has. He pops one into his mouth, cups his hand underneath the running tap and swallows it.
why we can’t be friends, James? We could never be friends; friends does not encapsulate what you mean to me, what you will always mean to me, even if I walk out of the door and never see you again.”
lie to you about this?” Tony demands, gesturing to James. “He openly admitted to being in love with me. Why wouldn’t he just tell you that yes, we’ve been fucking, yes, he’s been cheating on you, yes, we’re in love and running away together? Because honestly, it would’ve broken us up, and he would’ve been the consolation prize, and it makes sense why he would do that. But he
“I felt like shit, of course,” Steve goes onto say, weary and spent. “I thought I was betraying Bucky by feeling anything for you, and then, I don’t know, after a while I forgot. It still hurt, it really fucking hurt to think of them, but it was… I started to come to terms with the idea that Bucky was really dead, that… I don’t know, I think Sam called it an ambiguous loss? And I was starting to come out of it, come to terms with his death. I still loved him, of course, loved Bucky desperately. He was my first love, my oldest friend. He was… even when I had nothing, I still had Bucky. And I suppose, the more time that passed, the less I knew of how to explain it to Tony, to tell him about Bucky, about how I felt. I didn’t want to hurt him, didn’t want him to stress over the idea that he was a rebound, that I was still in love with someone else, because that
It’s a mean, quick punch to Tony’s gut, the words alone, and the ache ripples outward, until everything is drying up in his body, and his eyes are stinging, stinging bright.
Once that is done, Pepper returns to New York, to May Parker and Peter, and Rhodey returns to the Compound – if anyone is going to lead the Avengers now, Steve would be happy for it to be Rhodey.
There’s an awkward silence in the air following his question, but thankfully, Peggy is a lot bolder than Tony is.
He knows what it’s like, to grow up in a family where you can never be enough for one of your parents, and frankly, he’d rather throw Steve out the door onto the streets with his bare hands than allow Peter and Maushmi to suffer through that.
Wanda smiles, just a hint of her pearly white teeth. “Don’t think that therapy isn’t a way forward. It might actually help, being able to talk to someone who doesn’t know either of you. It’s worth it, you know, trying to fix your relationship before you take the nuclear option.”
Steve nods, miserably, wiping at his eyes, clearing his throat. “Yeah, they were sending me on a whole lot of missions. I tried to get out of them, but Fury, he’s a real hard-ass, and he doesn’t believe in… well, in distractions.”
He hears Jarvis walk on by into the rest of his room, and he thrusts his head under the shower spray, drenching his hair, humming to himself, the words coming to his brain without much forethought.
“I should be heading out. I don’t want… I don’t want to cause problems for you by being here,” James says, quietly.
“Let me take you to dinner,” Steve says, softly. He frowns. “That was supposed to come out as more of a question than a command.”
“Yes, he was, and I will mourn him as my brother, but I will not mourn him as my omega’s rapist,” Steve says, his voice sharpening around the edges of those last words.
Bucky made a derisive noise at the back of his throat. “To be honest, baby doll, we don’t consider that to be a proper marriage.”
Before Tony can even do something smart, like fist his hand in Rumlow’s shirt and drag the bastard down with him, Rumlow is pushing him down, through the hole, and he yells out, as he’s suddenly caught in freefall, tumbling through something like thirty feet.
“Yeah,” he clears his throat, “I’m sure. I… I want to stay here. I want to stay in this house that Tony and I made our home. I want to stay in this house that Tony wanted to be
He collapses, and Rhodey is the first to land beside him, tears in his eyes, as he already guesses what is about to happen, what
The teacher nods to the Scandinavian exchange student, who had been waiting uncomfortably in front of the class. He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the Bard.
The woman turns to him and bows low over Tony’s hand, as all alphas do with omegas. “It is lovely to meet you, Lord Anthony. I am Natasha, Ser James’ wife, and an old friend of Lord Steven’s.”
“Yeah, of course, I just…” Steve chews on his lower lip. “Do you really think you should be drinking right now?”
Tony leans forward and brushes his mouth against James’, fleetingly, his hand working its way into his long, unbound hair, and then, the press of his mouth firms up, pushes hard, and his tongue works its way into James’ mouth, licking behind his teeth.
Tony finishes his last dumpling, wipes his mouth with the napkin, and puts both the empty takeaway container and the used napkin on the tray by his bedside.
He spots the pen knife lying on the bed, and he wonders why he hadn’t seen it when Grant was raping him, wonders why he hadn’t thought to use it and open Grant’s throat from ear to ear instead of suffering him on top of him.
Steve swallows hard. “I’m glad you came to the show.” His brow furrows. “Even if I’m not particularly stoked that you saw me like that.”
Steve groans, his head hanging forward, and his hips stutter and falter, pausing, like he’s getting used to having his cock in a vice like Tony’s body. And then, he grits his teeth, thrusting forward – Tony feels Steve’s ribs shudder against his stomach, and he almost says something, reassures him, but the last time that Tony made an assumption about Steve’s ability or lack thereof to do something in his current state, well, it didn’t end well for them.
“Yeah,” Tony says, resoundingly. “He left a letter, but it didn’t explain anything.” He wrings his hands together. “I just assumed he was done with me, you know? I’d outlived my usefulness to his cause, and he’d… he’d gotten a little something extra for all of the problems that I gave him.”
, Steve, your mistress and our kids! But I can’t do it anymore, not when you treat me like this. Not when there’s a fucking double standard.”
They lay Natasha out onto the floor, and Tony chokes, flying forward, resting his knees at her hip. His hands hover over her, and Steve is crying, great, heaving sobs, in one corner of the cell, and he doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know what to say.
“I wish…” Bucky’s throat flexes, “I wish I’d gotten the chance to know him. I wish… I wish I’d known him as your husband and not as, as a victim of the Winter Soldier. I wish… I could have spared you this.”
,” Steve says, passionately. “And it really fucking kills me to know that that’s what you thought, after everything,
There is a loud crack, and Tony’s eyes snap open to see a bullwhip coming out of nowhere, wrapping around the middle of the poker and tearing it out of the Nazi’s hands. The poker sails high across the room, free of the whip, and lands in the heavy curtains over one of the windows, which immediately burst into flame.
“Those are bold words coming from someone who isn’t capable of making that car stay in the air on his own and has to rely on his omega son to do his work for
They turn at the next corner, and they know exactly where they’re going, as though Obadiah knew they were coming and was welcoming them. The skies are dark, the colours the colour of a fresh bruise. There’s a single tree by the ruins of the preschool, the leaves and branches of which are infested with crows.
“Yeah, and I thought you told me back at MIT that you were trying very hard to go for the very opposite of Ty. Sounds to me like you took a few steps back there, doll,” James taunts.
“I feel self-conscious,” Tony says, voice sharp around the edges. “It’s not you. It’s me. I feel self-conscious. I don’t need to have the differences between us pointed out in vivid display, okay. So, you know what, fuck you.”
He descends into the boiler room, which seems to stretch the length and breadth of the entire preschool. Pipes and ventilation ducts snake all around him, and there is a row of old black filing cabinets lining one wall. Tools are strewn about, and in the centre of the boiler room sits an old wood-fire oven that serves as the trunk to a set of black pipes.
Phillips rounds on him. “Do you know how long it took to set up this project? The grovelling I had to do in front of Senator Brandt’s committee?” he demands.
That night, Tony, Pepper and Natasha are in Tony’s living room, after he had pleaded with them after the last bell rang for the day to stay with him for the night, considering that both of his parents were still away and him and Jarvis had a deal whereby Jarvis wouldn’t say anything as long as Tony was doing anything unsafe or illegal.
Toni pauses. “I don’t know how I feel about the fact that one of the only two people that this eighteen-year-old girl likes is the guy I’m about to marry.” She pauses. “Is she pretty?”
“Yeah, and I believe him. I believe you both when you say that you haven’t… you know, you haven’t slept together or anything,” Steve begins, awkwardly, running his tongue over the seam of his lips, “but I guess… I don’t know, I guess I’m wondering why you didn’t
Tony glares at his boyfriend. “You’re not helping the situation.” He pauses, a little bit of urgency to his voice. “You are staying, though, right? Staying the night?”
“That’s my boy,” Steve says, fondly, and it fills Tony with such a sudden rush of pleasure and satisfaction that he feels the goosebumps rise across his bare skin. “Now, why don’t you get on your knees for me?”
“Thanks, babe,” Steve says with that golden smile, leaning down and kissing him swiftly between the eyes.
Then, someone pitches out of the dark at him. Tony yelps and grabs the nearest heavy thing, ready to bash the intruder over the head with a night lamp, but then, Steve’s face looms out of the darkness, balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside his window.
Tony makes a face, because it’s not her at all; he loves Wanda. If Tony and Steve have couple friends, they have Sam and Wanda. It’s just that what he’s planning as a surprise for Steve is a little embarrassing, playing into the kinks that had made their sex life so good once before.
“I know, I know I fucked up, especially where the kids are concerned, and those pictures,” Steve clears his throat. “I found them.”
“Obadiah Stane is still alive somewhere. I’m going to find the son of a bitch and get rid of him once and for all,” Tony says, coldly, fixing all of them with a stern look. “I wouldn’t wait up if I were you.”
. I’ve spent years without you, Tony, and I don’t know if I can do that again, keep myself away from you. I can’t, I just can’t, and I need to know if you feel the same way if you really think that you can stay away from me too because I don’t think you can.”
“My mother had previously threatened to remove the use of his tongue should this happen again. It appears she will have to come through on her promise,” Thor tells him, sadly.
Steve grips his hand, balancing a foot on the wall, and Tony pulls, pulls so hard that he thinks that his shoulders will pop out of their sockets, but finally, he manages to get Steve out as well.
!” James barks down at him. “Would you just listen to me? The guy’s nowhere near your kids, Tony. I’ve bugged his place.”
“We’ll see how many you want,” Tony says, lightly. “But I can only buy you books if you go to sleep now.”
“And you accept that Tony is completely capable of making his own decisions, is smart enough to make those decisions?”
A dark, acid chill creeps over Tony’s body, seeping into his bones and into his sinew, leaving him shuddering, and he pads towards the lounge, eerily feeling as though he is approaching his own death.
“Look, I can’t just destroy the bugs. It’s not that I don’t want to or that it’s not possible, because I could’ve just crush it under my boot, but… then, they’d know that I was onto them. I don’t want them to know that I’m onto them. I want them to think that they’ve won, that they’ve got me cornered.”
“What if we didn’t go back in time to stop Thanos from snapping his fingers, but we went back in time so that we could collect all of the infinity stones, bring them back to our time, to 2023, and snap
For a second, it’s just the four of them, their family, and Tony can breathe and pretend like there’s nothing wrong, like the twins have just had a nightmare and they’ve crawled into bed with Steve and Tony and this is how they’ve always comforted them, formed themselves into a cocoon so the twins know they’re protected.
“I suppose that was the reason why you didn’t tell him about Natasha either, because that would mean that you would have to explain everything to him, everything about SHIELD. What about the Winter Soldier?”
Tony scowls and feels a hapless, frantic swell of panic when Steve reaches out and grips the gun in his hand, the muscle in his arm flexing.
“Do you believe him when he says that nothing romantic or sexual was going between him and Natasha?”
“You definitely look… it, taller, that is,” Tony stammers. He then remembers the clothes that he’s holding. “Here.”
Maybe he’d dreamed it, maybe he’d overreacted, maybe this is just how alphas reacted when the virginity of an omega didn’t need to be protected (after all, no one but Steve and him know that their bonding has not been consummated; to the rest of the world, Steve has made him his omega in all the ways possible, and perhaps, this is how alphas acts with omegas who don’t need to be virgins).
“You don’t get to leave me after this, not after you’ve been inside me and come inside me and touched me like this,” Tony snarls, his mouth pulling away from his teeth. He looks at Steve, who’s watching him with an unsure expression, like he’s hurt and pained and doesn’t know what to do. “Neither are you. You don’t get to leave me.
like that, a woman you never even mentioned to me, Steve. You have never mentioned any of your fucking work colleagues; you have never mentioned that you are particularly close to any single one of them, but
know. It’s just… gonna take me some time. All I can say is that we’re nowhere near capable of this technology.”
Tony wonders how many years she’s obsessed over this, obsessed over blaming Howard for this, for bringing this man into their lives, for not doing the things that needed to be done so to prevent this man from getting his hooks into them.
Steve is staring at Tony in groggy alarm. He reaches for Tony, but Tony flattens himself against the wall.
Sometimes, immediately post his relationship with Steve ending, he’d pick fights with people, in alleyways, in underground rooms, and it would leave him bruised and bloodied and cringing from the soreness all over his body.
Tony and Lord Steven are bonded the next day in a ceremony. Their hands bound and oiled, with an old wiseman who speaks over them with vows and promises that they make to each other.
He takes a deep breath, and the urge lessens, but the humiliation is bright in his chest. His hands clutch at the edge of the table, tightening to the point of pain.
I do have to warn everyone, because I see this coming up in the comments a lot - you may disagree with how they resolve things, and by that I mean, Tony and Steve. You might think that Steve doesn't grovel hard enough, and that's your right to do so, but I approached it in a way that this Tony would react and what he would accept, and if you were expecting Tony to walk away from his marriage at the end of this, I am sorry but that's not going to happen. They will resolve things and stay together, and I'm sorry if it doesn't happen in a way that you want, but this is how I saw things realistically happening.
There’s a cock pressed up against his rim, as soon as Steve withdraws his fingers, and Tony lifts his head, the heat of lust making his head spin.
“Oh,” Peter says, and Toni can’t tell anything about he’s feeling about that from that monosyllabic word.
The first German mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose from the tank truck to the plane, sees Steve and the second mechanic and runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when Steve puts the second mechanic onto the ground with a devastating left hook. He turns to find the first German mechanic flying at him. They roll toward the rear of the airplane and its lethally spinning reversed propellers.
“That’s not what I’m doing!” Tony insists. “I’m not treating you like you’re breakable. I just thought, I mean, it’s been so long since you had to worry about these things, and I didn’t want you to exert yourself when you might have forgotten how to–”
“It’s just us, Pepper. You don’t have to call me that,” Tony says, exhaustion setting in his voice, as he turns around and starts stripping out of his clothes.
Natasha looks around the cell, groggily, running her fingers through her matted red hair, before collapsing back onto the pillow.
“I want to ride your cock and watch the video at the same time and have you tell me how much of a slut I look like in the video,” Tony confesses.
Steve bristles, and Tony starts anxiously fluttering around the edge of the conversation, getting ready to put an end to it, especially if fists start flying.
, and he was talking like normal, talking like Bucky, saying the same things that he used, and I was like… it was like I was fifteen all over again, and I couldn’t help myself. I was just-”
Eshe leans back, gives them both a weighty stare, a stare that makes Tony feel like he’s in school and he needs to shift in his seat, thinking that he’s done something wrong.
“I know the kinds of people that you used to fuck before I came along,” Steve drawls, “and I know that I look
“Oh, fuck off,” Tony says, derisively. “Don’t you dare try and change the subject. I gave you an explanation, Steve. What the hell were you expecting JARVIS would tell you, anyway?”
“Hey, are you deaf man?” he calls out, stalking out from around the bar. “I said get out, and I meant
, how are you doing?” she asks, kindly, her eyes drifting up to catch his, even though her hand continues with the knife in steady, rapid movements.
Steve smiles down at their daughter and smooths back her curling, frizzy hair. “I can see that. Thank you very much.”
Tony sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “It’s not about forgiveness,” he says, haltingly, his face strained. “It’s about not being able to go back in time, James. Too much time has passed; too much has happened, to you and to me. It’s too late for us. We can’t… and I don’t want to go back. I love my children, and I love my husband. I do. He’s hurting me; he’s hurting me a lot, but I still love him. I still want my family whole, and if I… if I let things change, if I left him for you-”
“You were five when you showed up with your first broken nose. It happens,” James points out. “All we can do is teach him to be brave and how to make bullies back off. He’s gonna get shit, Steve. You can’t stop that. He’s Tony Stark’s son, he’s a genius, and he’s got three dads. All you can do is teach them both how to deal with it. Let him do the ballet. It’s what he wants.”
Tony dumbs the photo album onto the coffee table, open to the picture of everyone at Tony’s fifth birthday party.
“For fuck’s sake, Steve!” Tony says, her mouth pulled back in a snarl, jumping out of the bed and glaring down at him. “What the fuck is your problem?”
“On your back, baby,” Steve tells him, his fingers winding around Tony’s ankle so that he can drag him forward.
Tony nods. “I guess I just wanted to feel like I was part of something greater than myself. And Stark Industries… it doesn’t give me that,” he says, honestly.
He covers his face with his hands, as Steve angles his mouth off his cock, running his tongue over his lips to clean up any excess come.
Steve didn’t and doesn’t love him the way that Tony loves Steve, and that was just something that he just needs to accept.
God, only he would get turned on while his kids are being held hostage somewhere and possibly being hurt by some assholes who have a revenge boner for the three of them.
Tony plants his feet on the mattress and spreads them, so that Steve can see his balls and a hint of his rim as well.
And Pepper, God, he loves Pepper, he does, but the last thing he needs is to be dragging Pepper into more of his mess.
“Oh, my God, Steve, that pillar is going to fall, and you are going to die, and there are snakes everywhere. Get down here,
The sudden longing to go back to him rears its ugly head, but Tony presses on. Between the five of them, they manage to destroy all of the evil bunnies, and Thor has Loki in shackles, ready to transport him, sullen and sour, back to Asgard to await trial,
“Good,” Tony smooths his hand over their hair as he slides to his feet. “Why don’t you guys go wait by the car, while I have a quick chat with Aunt Wanda, huh?”
“Okay, then,” Steve says, clipped, and drags the seatbelt to cover him and Peter, while Tony follows suit with him and Maushmi.
“Come on,” Steve cajoles in a what Tony perceives as a mean way, “come on, Tony, be real for a second here.”
were my family, and I just…” He rubs his hands over his eyes, and it hurts, hurts to get the words out, hurts to form them in his lungs. “I always thought you felt the same way. But then, you started to slip away, so, clearly it wasn’t enough, this life that we were building for ourselves,” he finishes, bitterly, his lip curling up sharply, grinding his teeth. “You were all I wanted, you were everything to me, and you don’t want me anymore, and you don’t even care. I have loved you through everything; I have loved you even while you humiliated me and disrespected me and shamed me and accused me and
Natasha looks like she wants to say something, and maybe Tony would prefer it if she did, but she doesn’t, she doesn’t say anything.
It ends quicker than Tony assumed it would; he thought Grant wanted to take his time, but clearly, whatever sick thrill he had gotten from Tony’s distress had dissipated eventually, and he comes, leaving a sore wash of heat inside Tony, when he withdraws. Grant gets up, looks over Tony’s naked body, the destruction he has left in his wake, and considers him with the same disinterest that one might with a corpse of someone they didn’t care about.
“It is not a Jehovah’s Witness.” JARVIS hesitates for an agonising moment. “Miss Romanoff is at the door.”
He pulls his hand out of Steve’s sweatpants and sucks in his fingers into his mouth, dragging over the musky, salty taste of his pre-come.
Steve takes it in with a stoic face, but when Thor leaves the penthouse, Tony waits for it, waits for the grief to come. It starts off slow, with Steve’s hands, poised on his thighs, clenching and unclenching around nothing. The tension then spills into his shoulder, as his body curves inward, as though protecting himself from the onslaught of emotions that he must be feeling.
The path between Tony and the center of the room is overrun. The circle of flame around Tony is dying down, and his throat flexes, panic flooding his chest and his mouth, tasting like bile, staring beyond the circle of dying flames and then up through the increasing smoke where Steve is still climbing, now near the top of the pillar.
Warnings for this chapter: implied/referenced domestic violence (not between Steve and Tony), marital problems, lingerie kink, almost sexual content.
Tony deflates like a tyre hitting a shard of glass on the road. “Maybe this is both of our faults,” he says, quietly. “Maybe we both fucked up. Maybe we should’ve… just communicated, you know? Talked this shit out. If I’d… if I’d come to you when I first started getting suspicious that you were seeing someone behind my back, then, maybe we wouldn’t be standing here at the edge of…” he trails off. “well, I guess, the edge of divorce.”
Tony thinks of the years between seeing Steve again and his abrupt departure in the middle of the night; he thinks of the warm bodies that he’d made love within an attempt to forget Steve’s face, his hands, his warmth, his heart; he thinks of all the nights that he’d dreamed of him and then, woken up in a terrible, resigned stupor, alone; he thinks of all the times that he’d forced himself to remember that Steve didn’t love him, Steve didn’t want him anymore, and he couldn’t waste his life on someone who didn’t want him forever.
But it’s too late. Steve is running back through the path of flames to the centre of the room. Snakes strike at his flying heels. Steve reaches the base of a pillar, and he uses the torch to clear away the scattered snakes climbing on it. He pulls out his whip, drawing it back, then wrapping it solidly around the pillar around fifteen feet up.
There’s a high, thin scream that blares through, and then, an awful thud, and the dial tone, and Tony lowers the phone, staring at the screen, bewildered.
“Nothing much,” Pepper hums. “He was lowborn, originally; he came from nothing, when he saved the King from being killed by bandits. He was raised to a knight by the King, and then, once the rebellion was over, the King ousted loyalist lords and placed him as the lord of the Brooklyn Lands.”
“Are you calling me fat?” Tony retorts, with just the smallest hint of genuine question, but that was better saved for another day.
“You didn’t tell me about her because you thought you were doing something wrong, right?” Tony pushes.
Tony worries his teeth on his lower lip, staring up at him through the dip of his eyelashes. “It’s what I do best,” he manages to say, seductively, his voice and soft like a slow drip of honey.
of a terrible and irresponsible father,” Tony says, crossly. “Besides, Pepper needed the specs for that new body armour we were going to sell to the Air Force – please don’t start with the
He hates that, he hates that it’s now on his head, to forgive and forget, to make everything better, to make everyone comfortable, to be happy with Steve, even if he hurts him, disrespects him, offends him, and he hates that Steve put him in that position, holding him hostage to a completely different result.
Tony and Steve hunker down in their car, watching as a sedan pulls up in front of Stark Manor. Sarah pulls out, followed by Melina, and then, another car drives up, containing Virgil and Patricia.
That same suggestive look returns to Barnes’ eyes, and Tony’s fairly certain that he can take it from there.
He knows what’s going to happen, so he steels himself and hides a carving knife, typically used for slicing up meat, in his cloak, before returning to his chambers.
He’s stretched so full and taut around the wide girth of Steve’s cock, and he can’t halt the rise of his own hips to meet Steve’s, every drag of his cock catching on Tony’s prostate in a way that makes spots dance in his vision.
The moment is shattered, when the man next to Steve shouts out, “hey, let’s hear it for Captain America!”
“She’s a friend of Daddy’s from work,” he explains, ruffling his hair. “You stay right here, and I’ll be right back, okay?”
He hates this, hates asking JARVIS to lie, but if anyone found out, they’d assume the worst of him; they’d think he’d spread his legs for James without a thought to his husband or his children.
“They were throwing me around like a rag doll,” Tony gasps, his throat aching. “They must have switched the baskets.”
He laughs, harsh and grating. “And here I was worried about a seductive, voluptuous redhead, when I should have been worried about his best friend coming back to life.”
Tony takes the chance to kick the throttle, and then, the cart shoots off, doubling its speed and shooting under the low cross beam at the same time that a huge rumble of fire shoots up behind the Nazis, catching their car and setting them, Zola and all of his men, alight.
Steve grunts at his filth and shoves the vibrator deep inside Tony’s greedy body, with a dirty little grind, making him arch his back and all the words fall off his tongue, as he tries to catch his breath and allow his mind to reboot.
Steve slings an arm around her waist from behind, as they walk over to the elevator to take them to the second floor where the bedroom sits. He presses his lips to the bare curve of her shoulder where one half of the shirt sits loose.
They both shove pieces of paper into his hands, and Tony exchanges a look with Steve and James over their heads. He unravels the pages, and a knot forms in his throat, like nothing he’s ever felt before.
“Keep it in your pants, handsome, or you’ll come and I can’t be fucked waiting for you to get hard again. Come on.”
“Then, why didn’t he just say that to me?” Tony demands. “Steve doesn’t… God, Wanda, there are so many days where anything could have happened to me, and Steve hasn’t cared. Why would he care now?”
“Funny,” Tony muses. “He made the same noise, and then, he punched the frat boy in the face, and his friends jumped Steve, and then, Steve’s friend, Sam, was getting involved, and suddenly, before I even knew what I was doing, I was breaking a beer bottle on the edge of the bar counter and jumping into the fray.”
“Because you were seventeen, Tony,” James groans. “And I was… God, I was putting you in danger, getting you involved in things that I had no business getting you involved in-”
That hurts probably more than anything – he might have been able to stomach the cheating, frankly; he grew up around the infidelity, and it’s nothing terrible that he won’t be able to tolerate. The betrayal is like a white-hot knife through his belly, cutting swiftly and mercilessly to draw blood and to be as painful as possible, but it’s nothing that he hasn’t endured before, it’s nothing that he couldn’t endure. He could stand to share Steve with someone else, if it meant that he came home every day and still loved him and still loved their children, but the more and more time that Steve begins to spend away from him, the more he starts to think that this life, the life that they’d made together, made in agreement with each other and want from one another, is not enough for Steve.
“Ah,” Tony drags out, “Dr. Erskine came to me, well, he came to my father, actually. He spoke of what his plans with the procedure, said that he couldn’t do it on his own, that the science would only get him so far, and that he needed a machine to be built. Well, not just one, but many machines, for the procedure to work. I’m the only one who can make those machines, so I made them, with the agreement that I would be involved in the process. I was… curious, I suppose, and I’ve lived a very… orthodox, unadventurous life. Just… luncheons and parties and balls and smiling pretty at alphas so that I can land a good bonding,” he says, a bitter note to his voice. “My life was not what I wanted it to be; it lacked purpose and value, so I changed it.”
Tony’s tongue is dry and stuck to the roof of his mouth, and he processes it, processes it as quickly as possible, and then, he looks around, searching.
Steve turns around to see him and stands, surprised. “Tony,” he murmurs in that way of his, like he’s trying to express a hundred different emotions in a single word.
Maushmi clears her throat. “Alright, that’s enough.” Her hand tightens around Tony’s shoulder. “The police have heard enough from these boys. They have gone through something awful tonight. They need rest,” she says, sternly, as if telling Howard that he better be prepared to go to war with the entire Timely police force if it means that Tony and Steve will be allowed to leave the station that night.
So, after the phone call ends, he strides purposefully into the bedroom, only to find Steve packing a bag.
There’s a harder bang, like the sound of a body colliding with a door, and then, the door bursts open, and Jarvis is standing there, rushing over to Tony who is on his belly, trying to crawl out of the shower. He doesn’t even think, grabs a towel and wraps it around Tony’s damp body.
Just to piss him off, because Steve always hated how much he drank, he pours himself another, as Steve watches.
, Tony. You’re always going to be my son. There aren’t any lines I wouldn’t cross to keep you safe.”
They’re in a jet, with Tony at the wheel, and he looks over his shoulder to see Steve buttoning fatigues over his Captain America costume.
“Because you are too young. You are only six and ten. If we were to… if we were to consummate this bonding, if I were to take you in the ways that alphas take omegas, I fear it would make me the same as those alphas who go to the brothels, searching for children to satisfy themselves.” Steve’s face twists with revulsion. “I kill those men, Tony. If I see them, I kill them. I will not become one of them.”
“The kids, James. I have kids. They’re tiny, they’re so tiny; what… what am I going to do?” Tony lurches to his feet, panic clawing at his throat. “I have to go. I have to go and grab them from school. I’ll… I’ll call Steve on the way, and we’ll, uh, we’ll get out of here. We’ll leave. This guy, he won’t be able to find us.”
Steve looks a little sheepish, and he wanders towards the line of buses again, picking up a spindly hand rake from the ground.
Tony lifts his hands high above his head to curl around the bedposts and arches his back, just as Steve fully seats his cock inside him. Tony sets his teeth on his lower lip, grinding down, hoping that he’ll be able to taunt Steve enough with an instinctive bid of friction to get him to wrap his hand around Tony’s cock, get him off that way.
kids. And clearly, they don’t. So, I’m furious, and I’m going to go after them, and I’m going to bring our kids home, without a scratch on them, because I will
He has nothing to be ashamed of; he has no reason to cower under the sheets because Steve’s had his fill of him, and now, like jealousy is the only fucking thing that exists in their marriage, the only true, honest emotion, he has the fucking nerve to do this, to treat him like this, to lay claim to him like he has any fucking right after everything that he’s done.
Toni’s smile widens. “Thank you for saying that, but when I first found out that you were growing inside me, I thought I wouldn’t be a good one. I was so scared, and then, when they put you in my arms for the first time, and you looked at me–”
Sam sighs and makes a small motion with the fingers on his free hand that Tony takes to meaning that he can enter the room.
Tony swallows hard and steps away from the door, padding over to the kitchen. There’s a lot of stuff in the fridge, but of course, no booze. No, all of the alcohol is kept in Tony’s special place, only to be drunk when the twins are spending a night with their Rhodey or Sam and Wanda, and Tony has a moment of peace.
Tony’s hands wind their way into Steve’s thick, golden hair, tugging at the strands, as Steve continues to kiss him, kiss him like he’s starving for it, and when he finally pulls back, when they both recognise the need to breathe, Tony’s lips are dark and bruised, and he runs his thumb over the curve of his lower lip, feeling the flesh hurt under the pad of his finger.
“We’ve been through a lot together,” Tony reminds him. “A lot worse than me rigging some electronics for you.”
“And this is annoying me too,” he murmurs, slipping his hands under Steve’s shirt, before he takes that off as well. “And this.”
“Sir, I am worried that you are desperately checking whether the house is secure because you wish to avoid going to bed,” JARVIS tells him. “And I believe the reason why you are avoiding going to bed, even though it is already quite late is because Master Steve has not yet returned home.”
Tony lifts his head, his vision blurring at the edges. “It’s a bad habit, I’m afraid. I’m trying to break it.”
“I… I was actually tired,” Steve says, dully, panicking. “I was genuinely tired. I was coming back from long missions.”
Tony tells him the story of how he accidentally gave Maushmi’s favourite Barbie to charity, and how she didn’t speak to him for three days, until she needed him to braid her hair for school, and it makes James laugh, so Tony considers that a win.
“I never want you to go anywhere either,” he manages to say, his mouth a slack, wet smear against the bare curve of Steve’s shoulder. “I want you to stay here, right here, with me, inside me.”
Tony sucks in a sharp breath, and he musters up the strength from somewhere to text him back, letting him know where he is. Moments later, the front doors are bursting open, and Steve is throwing himself down the stairs to reach him. Steve ends up on the grass with him, wrapping his arms around Tony, clutching at him, so that Tony can bury his face in his shoulder, sob a little the way that he wouldn’t have had the courage to do otherwise.
