maybe. The idea of a full grown man trying to beat a small, scrawny Steve, a tiny scrap of a boy fighting a drunk veteran, twists something in Tony. The back of his neck prickles with fury.
“Stark was acting under my command,” Loki says, warning, and Thor crumples back into himself.
“What a nutjob.”
“You keep saying that, but you won’t really know until you have a suit.”
“Steve,” Tony says, much closer now, and Steve sucks in a shaky breath though his mouth. It doesn’t help at all. Tony’s sweat is evaporating into the air, a fine mist of pheromones coating Steve’s tongue like candy. He feels like he’s drowning. He can’t breathe. “Hey…”
“Give him time,” Strange says, quiet. “We just got Steve back, and then…” He sighs. “It’s no wonder that he’s…struggling. He’s been through a lot.”
“I wanna have you with me for a bit while you’re gone,” Steve explained, blushing faintly. Tony smirked at him, but he was gentle when he pulled out, tilting Steve’s hips up to keep as much of the mess inside him as possible before plugging him back up. The plug wasn’t as big as Tony’s knot, and he could already feel some of the combined mess of his slick and Tony’s come leaking out, but he wanted to keep that full feeling if Tony was running off. He always felt needy after a knotting, preferring a long aftercare scene with Tony’s fingers pressing in and out, obscene noises filling the room as he massaged the soreness from Steve’s body. But they both knew there wasn’t enough time for that.
“Sir and Dr. Banner had a strong disagreement yesterday afternoon. Sir became very upset and experienced the preliminary symptoms of a panic attack. He proceeded to take the nearest shortcut out of the living room, which naturally meant jumping off of the balcony and calling a suit to him mid-air. Dr. Banner reacted as you might expect to this.”
“JARVIS, what’s…oh, boy, I don’t know how to pronounce this.”
“I basically tricked you into bonding with me,” Steve sobbed, and wow, he was a fucking mess. He curled up on the floor next to the glass, turning away and resting his head back against the cool pane because he couldn’t stand to look at Tony right now. He pressed his chin to his knees, scrubbed a hand through his hair. “I lied to you. I went through your things. I pried into your personal medical information without your consent. And then, knowing all of that, I took advantage of you. I was the one who wanted to bond. I wanted you so badly. I
“I don’t want anyone else,” Steve tells him. He’s so stubborn. He’s magnificent, even splotchy and soaked in tears. He looks like Cabanel’s
Peter shifts on his chair, an uncomfortable expression overtaking his face. “Sorry. Just…I can’t help but feel like he’s not really dead, y’know? Like not forever. And I know you think so too.”
“Will you marry me?” Steve recited dutifully, kissing Tony’s brow, his crinkled eyes, the corner of his mouth and everyone was watching and cheering and nothing was better than this.
Tony shakes his head. “No such thing,” he tells him. He means it, too. There is nothing he wouldn’t give Steve. He would bisect his own body and pull his living heart out of his chest if Steve asked him to. There is no future where Steve asks him for something he isn’t willing to give.
It’s not like Tony’s a furry or anything. (Are you still a furry if you’re into cephalopods?) And it’s not like he’s routinely seeking out a very specific and yet strangely prolific kind of hentai (which has nothing to do with the fact that he’d probably be most interested in ‘consensual tentacle bara’ but he doesn’t know if that’s a thing) or ordering tentacle dicks off of Bad Dragon (not that he would because he could make something
“You can’t smoke on the grounds, can you?” he guesses, and Logan chuckles.
“Tell us where,” Natasha said, taking Steve gently by the elbow for the barest breath before pulling back again. None of them said anything about what Tony’d likely been through for the better part of three weeks. It didn’t really need to be said.
Tony doesn’t open his eyes once.
“Weird,” Spidey says.
“Morning, Pepper,” he says, putting on his best smile. Pepper doesn’t even spare him a glance.
Hill doesn’t say anything, which is answer enough. Behind him, he can hear the patter of footsteps, and he turns and raises a repulsor, only to lower it when a familiar head of blonde hair peeks over the top of the stairs. Steve’s expression is determined, blood on his fists, and Tony reaches a hand out to him.
Strange,” Peter says, rolling his eyes. Steve doesn’t know how he’s able to convey that whilst wearing the mask, but Peter’s nothing if not expressive. “Maybe he can help.”
“That is your personal assessment, Captain,” Xavier says. “I wouldn’t call you naïve. Hope is often a scarce necessity in our dangerous line of work. Sometimes it is all we have.”
After it was done, Steve roused sometime in the mid-morning to find Tony staring down at him as though he were a stranger. His face was slack, eyes roving wildly over Steve’s face as he sat up beside him in bed, one leg folded underneath him, the other foot planted on the floor. His hair was wet from a shower, and he’d put on a pair of cotton sleep pants. He looked like a Roman statue, golden muscles and shadows cut sharp by the full force of the sun, and Steve smiled up at him with contentment and joy before he registered Tony’s unnatural stillness. Tony wasn’t touching him, either, which was strange, just watching with that same indecipherable look on his face. He didn’t even react to Steve’s questioning hum, a small sound in his sore throat as he stretched out a hand towards Tony’s face.
“Truce, truce,” he laughs. Tony jabs him painfully in the stomach with his free hand. “Stark, I swear-”
“Pepper, no. Listen to me. There’s a whole squadron of these assholes, okay? He was just given an invite to an already existing homicidal psychopath club. If it was just him, we could have taken care of it.”
"Didn't you hear? I'm unstable. I need supervision."
“Uh, Cap, kinda working-”
“It’s barely started. And you know an orgasm cuts that right off for me half the time,” Tony says, easy. “Tell me what you need, Steven.”
The mansion is one of the things that Steve had been sure to avoid with extreme prejudice in New York, along with his old neighbourhood and the entirety of south Brooklyn. New York was a chameleon; she was changing all the time, donning new faces, new landscapes, new people. It was easier, in some ways, to feel grounded here when it looked so little like the old city he’d once known, the cobbled streets and the red brick and the sludge.
, and when Tony shifts one foot to press his dextrous toes into Loki’s crotch he can feel Loki come underneath him, around him, a high, skirling whine making him gasp and choke around Tony’s cock as the soft fabric restraining his crotch soaks straight through. His eyes are red and watering, so emerald bright it’s like he’s lit from within, and Tony takes a long look at him, thrusts his hips up twice, then pulls Loki back by the hair and comes messily all over his mouth, his jaw, his gorgeous neck.
. Steve wet his lips, rocked back and forth on his feet a few times, then reached out and punched in the door code.
“God,” Tony breathed, nosing gently behind his ear. “You smell like sin.”
He chances a glance at her, where Pepper is staring hard enough to burn a hole in his head.
“Obedience spell,” he admits, and Beth stares at him, her brow crinkling. Colour floods her face.
“Not really,” Tony says, polishing off another oyster. “If I die you get everything, as usual. Love you, sorry. I think that covers the usual speech. We don’t usually get to say goodbye, do we? Thank god.”
I'm baaaaack. Chapter warnings, as usual:
“Eyes on me, gorgeous,” Tony tells him. “Ready?”
Steve shakes his head, numbly. He doesn’t say anything else. His eyes are so red. He looks broken.
Below, he can see the wreckage left from their battle; a few crushed cars, police, a gathering crowd. He can track where the battle between Moonstone and Hulk must have spilled into the street, or perhaps it was Executioner. Thor hadn’t sounded regretful enough to blame himself, so it must have been Moonstone. He desperately hopes Bruce is faring alright alone in the jet.
“Yes, Tony, yes,” Steve babbles, half out of his mind with it. The metal of the cuffs is straining, a quiet clicking creak, and Tony reaches down and takes Steve’s dripping cock in his hand, working him once, twice. Steve arches his back, eyes fluttering shut. His mouth opens, a gasp that might be Tony’s name or a benediction spilling from his lips as he comes, warm and sticky over Tony’s fingers, his own stomach, his chest.
. He was.
“Is this what you want?” Steve asks him. He opens his eyes, tilts forward towards the camera. His brows are creased as he studies Tony’s face on the screen. “Just this once, be honest with me. Is this really what you want?”
“Yes.” JARVIS’ voice is solemn.
“If I had offered this information a year ago, it would have destroyed the burgeoning bonds between us,” Natasha tells him, and Tony nods, because yeah. That’s true. “We trust each other, now. You can forgive me.”
,” Bucky threatens, and Tony laughs. The line cuts out.
“I saw you get shish-kebabed,” Hawkeye says. “What’s your status?”
Then the interviewer had asked her final question. “A lot of people have wondered, how have you managed to keep your dynamic a secret all this time, when you’ve been so prolific in…sharing your affections?”
Loki sneers at him, black lips curling back over sharp teeth. “I would have thought you would sympathise with his moralising,” he says, and Steve looks at him. He looks at him, and he imagines what it might feel like to let Tony take him apart. He thinks about Tony’s warm, clever mouth, and the way his hands move when he works. He remembers what Tony looks like when he’s freezing someone out. Steve makes a decision, in that moment. Suddenly, the next steps are easy.
“And your soulmate?”
“If she was telling the truth about her names,” she says slowly, “that would confirm my suspicion.”
“Don’t,” Tony says, turning, then regrets it at the flash of something wary in Loki’s face. He rallies, feeling uncharacteristically awkward. “No, I mean, thank you for offering, really, but I kind of want to milk it.” He winks at Loki, who looks surprised. A bark of laughter breaks his face wide open, some of the tension leaving him, and Tony snickers with him, pleased to have avoided…whatever that was.
There's no sign you'll come back. Sometimes
“Yes, sir.”
“You know, y’all are the only adults I know trying to get me to curse
“You got me all trussed up,” Steve burrs. “I’m not doing anything.”
“He called me Rogers,” Steve says, and Sam raises his eyebrows. “He hasn’t done that in ages without it being a joke.”
The doors close on Steve’s pained, longing expression. It’s enough to make him want to go back, but he knows he can’t.
“Tony.” Tony turns back to him. “I’ve never had a friend like you.”
,” he’s saying, more sound than word. He rolls his forehead against Tony’s shoulder. “Oh
“What the captain is trying to say,” Thor says, expression openly amused now, “is that we have come to an agreement, and we wish for you to remain our leader in the field until our captain is once again fit for the role.”
“He should go back. His references are good. He could get hired for any house or hotel, easy,” Tony said, an old argument, but Rogers just shook him.
“If you want to go,” Tony began, but Steve shook his head mutely. “Um.”
"Just a peck on the cheek, in the suit. I felt it. I flirt, it's nothing, I didn't think-" He exhales, pushing away from the worktop and spinning towards the back wall. He pushes off the stool and wipes his hands on a rag. "When he appeared here, I didn't know what to think. When I asked him why me, he said not to ask stupid questions. So I told him he'd have to convince Clint, not me."
“You surprised me!” Tony says, one hand cutting through the air. “It was just a fucking kiss, Steve, and in case you forgot I was climbing you like a tree, clearly I wasn’t fighting you-”
“It doesn’t mean anything,” Tony had said.
A single moth flutters through the shaft of sunlight that streams through the high window. It paints a large moon of light on the carpet in the centre of the room, and the moth cutting through it makes a menacing shape on the ground, big as a bat, or a bird.
Tony turns dutifully around at the kitchen island to glance into the dark living room, rising and bringing his bowl of pasta with him as he stands behind the couch. Thor follows, curiosity beating out his voracious hunger, as Fox News comes up on the screen. Dana Perino is sitting at the usual desk, hands gesturing as she sits across from a commentator that Tony recognises from the usual news circuit.
there was hunger there. He stepped forward, scenting, and Steve tamped viciously down on the sound that wanted to crawl out of his throat. “Like…lying in the grass in August. Living, growing things. The sweet, vanilla scent that comes off of crisp, freshly unrolled paper vellum.” He paced forward again, his face swimming a mere half-foot from Steve’s, closer. “A sweet New England summer wind, with that faint hint of ocean salt to it that makes you want to strip and dive straight into the nearest body of water. Sticky heat. God, you smell like long hours over a drafting table next to an open window in high summer.”
“Me, probably,” Steve says with even humour. “And here I am, unable to argue with you.”
Stark blinked at him, shocked, but Barton just snickered, and then Banner, and suddenly the whole team was laughing. Even Fury looked a little amused.
The figure stalks closer. A black mask covers his face, long, greasy strings of dark hair hanging over his eyes. He moves like a professional; unstoppable, efficient. He is coming to kill them, Steve knows. He can feel this in his chest, in his bones, heavy as lead. Panic bubbles up from his throat, accompanied by the copper tang of blood.
Steve wasn’t pouting. He wasn’t. “Oh, okay.”
“Stephen said he was looking into it, but.” Steve peeks, just in time to catch Tony’s helpless shrug. He’s got a towel wrapped around his waist, the other ruffling through his hair. Water slithers down the long tendons of his neck, over his sternum and the slightly paler patch of skin there where Tony’s body has been through trauma after trauma. He doesn’t quite have scars, just a slight variance of colour: a small, paler sunburst at the centre of his chest. Steve’s not even sure most people would notice it, but Steve’s noticed. The shape, now that he’s looking at it, is strangely beautiful. Sun-like, almost.
Tony jerks back a little, like Reed’s hit him. It’s so simple, said like that. There’s always been something admirable about Reed’s absent-minded wisdom. Sometimes, Steve thinks he’s the only one Tony will listen to.
Pym laughed, nodding towards the door. “Go on, Stark. I’ve got the old girl.”
“Every day, I have strived to become the kind of man that Steve Rogers would be proud to know. I expect for the rest of my life, I’ll have him whispering in my ear. For my sins, I’m sure he’d tell me. I will treat this haunting as a gift, as I expect each and every person who knew him will as well: the gift of Steve Rogers in your life, ever urging you to be a better friend, a better citizen, a better lover, a better parent or student or soldier or athlete. A better person, striving for a better world.
“It is good to see you looking so well, too!” Thor boomed. Natasha lifted her hand in a tiny wave, Bruce and Clint nodding, and Steve blushed and ducked his head. “Come down when you are ready, and we shall feast together!”
“Tony,” Steve complained, and Tony grinned, pulling out of his embrace.
. The first time a quarterback had looked at him with a shy smile, a dimpled chin and bright sunshine-yellow hair, Tony had followed that boyish grin straight into a quick and dirty bleacher fuck, mud staining his tailored white trousers as white teeth were carefully tucked away behind pink, swollen lips. Stubble burn on his thighs was a new experience, but oh did Tony learn to love the feeling, the bruises on his hips, the feeling of being small and held safe in someone’s arms. At fifteen, every college boy was bigger than him, and he did love a good pair of guns. That winter, coming home for Christmas and reencountering all of the old Captain America propaganda was like seeing his first circuit board; suddenly, everything clicked into place. The world made sense, born anew again. He’d never jacked off more in his life, prior or since, than he did during that week and a half.
“Loki’s been sleeping here.”
Tony laughs and throws open the door, ready to face the scowling Natasha, the cadre of supervillains, an injured Steve.
“And let me guess,” Steve drawls. “Clint and Natasha don’t count because their jobs before this were with SHIELD?”
The professor nods. “Then maybe you should return to the field as second in command.”
He remembers, with a distinct kind of clarity, reading Charles Bukowski’s “Bluebird” for the first time. He’d picked up
“I’m really, really sorry,” Nico Minoru says.
“Sometimes, war is brutal by necessity,” Steve says. He keeps his body language soft, but his eyes are unflinching as he meets Tony’s gaze. “You know that, or you wouldn’t have bombed Gulmira.”
“I don’t know why I put up with your nonsense,” Stephen sighs, and Tony rolls his eyes. “You explicitly said it was urgent. Many times. Over many messages.”
Tony hazards a smile at him, and for a moment they just look at each other. Steve’s eyes tracing his face are almost as tangible as hands. Everywhere he looks, Tony feels it.
“Stark!” Thor shouts, but Tony blocks them out. He tries to make sense of what he’s seeing.
“You’re getting worse,” she observed. There was no judgement in it, just a quiet statement of fact.
“So he twisted the knife in your insecurities.” Bruce’s voice is dark, and Tony shivers. “You must’ve said something nasty.”
“Well, it might not be possible, when we first get him back,” Steve replied, voice even as he could make it. “If you care at all about me and Tony and our bond, you’ll do this one thing for us. If I’m right, you’ll understand immediately why when you see him in person for the first time. And if you don’t, then my request is moot.”
“No, he makes unilateral decisions when he is sure he’s right and thinks someone else will get in the way of him doing what is right. You can’t tell me you don’t do the same exact thing, Captain. Or was it someone else who blew up SHIELD?”
Steve opens his mouth, then closes it again. That was not where he thought this conversation was going. “Yes,” he says, but it sounds more like a question than an answer in his own mouth. “Tony had the suit on. I knew he’d probably be fine. It was selfish, and illogical, to try to save Tony when he didn’t need to be saved.”
Tony is rocking on his feet as he waits for the elevator doors to open, fidgety as he always is when he’s nervous or exhausted, the way he never is in battle or when he’s focussed. Tony is pure energy, light and warmth and electric pain arcing out to sear flesh when prodded. He sparks bright, burns hot as stars, and Steve is drowning in his velleitie.
So, first of all, an apology. It’s been a long time since I’ve updated, obviously, and the honest truth is that it’s just been so fucking hard to write this story in light of the recent U.S. election and current political events. I am a queer, brown, and chronically ill second-generation American citizen. A close family member recently got deployed to the Middle East. So, I don’t think I really need to explain more than that, if you really read what I wrote out here. Many of the political figures on the security task force in this chapter are real people, and I have tried to align their characters to their comments on the record about relevant real-life events.
Carol holds him, and rocks him back and forth, and tangles her fingers in his hair. Together, they cry, exactly how Steve expects: Carol, silent and blotchy with fury in her eyes, Tony desperate and aching, unfairly photogenic with his olive skin that refuses to betray a flush. Steve wants to tell them both that it’s okay, that they don’t have to take everything upon themselves and press everything down so hard. He wants to hold them both in his arms and let them cry on his shoulder instead.
"On the cheek." He pulls onto Grand Central, revving the engine a little for kicks as he merges smoothly into traffic. "Tell me flirting with a literal vengeful god who threw me out of the window of my own tower is a bad fucking plan."
“Thank you,” Steve says, fervent, weirdly serious, and then he’s reaching over to the bedside table for the lube. “I just…the way you looked at me, like I- God, I…”
“Of course.” JARVIS is silent for almost a block, which Steve knows enough to understand is practically an age for an Artificial Superintelligence. “You and Sir are volatile, Captain,” he says as Central Park comes to an end. “And while I can understand why Sir might love you, and how it is easy for others to love Sir, it is sometimes hard for me to understand how you two love each other. But what do I know of love?”
“Well,” Tony says, ignoring the slight stiffening of Loki in his lap, “that’s one way to deal with a panic attack, I guess. Not one I’ve ever chosen, but I mean, if it works for you, go for it. Not sure I’d do that myself, but everyone has their own coping mechanisms-”
"You run to keep yourself from going crazy."
“Let’s get this over with,” she says, clipping past him and into the dining hall. “I’m sure we’re both busy. I have everything laid out for you in the conference room.”
“Hey, can you pick me up?”
There’s a small, companionable silence in the confession booth. Steve wipes at his eyes and takes a shuddering breath. He lets the atmosphere of the church wash over him: the unique, echoing silence, and the faintest scent of the thurible’s swaying left from morning mass, and the smooth texture of the wood against his arm where he’s pressed against the booth.
“Hulk want burger. Tin Man always eat burger when sad.” He frowns a little, his dark green mouth stretching into a huge downward curve. “Tin Man gone long time. Hulk think Tin Man back now. Tin Man o.k.?”
Steve swallows, guilt and desire tightening around his chest in suffocating bands. “Yeah,” he rasps. “I, uh. I thanked him, last night.”
This is not Steve’s first death, but it might be the one that haunts him the most.
“She’s presently occupied. Perhaps tomorrow morning.”
There’s no electric dissipation to herald his disappearance this time, no flash of golden light. Tony wonders how much of what he’s tracked so far can be attributed to what Loki wished for him to see, the way Natasha sometimes makes noise in the dark to let Tony know she’s approaching. He stares for a moment longer before looking out the windows, remembering the shatter of glass and the inspissating air roaring around him as he fell.
“Be back in a sec,” he says, eyes flashing with gentle amusement. Then he turns around and leaves the bathroom.
“It seems so,” Xavier says, and Steve turns to look at him. “Does this time work well for you, Captain? Only, I have a teaching schedule, so my availability is limited.”
“Yeah, well. I wasn’t either,” he says, staring down into the mug. “I just felt like I was.”
“I can’t understand why you’re doing this,” Tony says quietly, and watches Loki open to him, body going lax and expression shifting. “I don’t know what you get out of it, what you want in return.”
Steve sets a slow and steady pace, not soft, just deliberate. He’s pressing into Tony’s sweet spot every time, and nestled in together like this he can get pretty deep. Tony’s content to melt back into his arms and let him run the show. Steve’s callouses are just shy of too much on his cock, and Tony moans quietly under his ministrations, then louder, his noises increasing in volume with his pleasure. No one would ever call Tony quiet, in or out of bed.
, he thinks.
He’s distracted enough that he forgets what had originally roused him, but Tony’s never been anything but sharply observant. His eyes scan the landing pad, and then he’s pushing himself to his feet, turning away from Steve and the 90-plus-story drop. Steve twists to follow him with his eyes, which means he’s just in time to see the space next to the quinjet distort strangely. The air…twists, somehow, a gold spark flickering, then twisting, almost like water circling a drain. It spreads, opens wider, and through it a single, long-fingered hand pushes through. It’s shaking, flecked with blood, and the vambrace that follows it is all too familiar.
“Just hear me out.”
“I want to come,” Steve says, broken. Tears gleam on his flushed-pink face. He’s…
Steve meets Tony’s eyes head on. Tony’s eyes are wild in his face.
Unfortunately, to the surprise of absolutely no one, he does not make good on his decision to keep his hands off of Steve.
Tony raises his eyebrows at him. “Are you serious?”
“Hush,” Steve murmurs, squeezing Tony in a hug. Tony subsides, pressing his forehead into Steve’s with a rough sigh. “Whatever it is, Tony; the UN, the US government, Loki’s Big Bad, we can face it. He told you as much, didn’t he?”
“Hey, Shellhead,” he says, quietly enough that he hopes Tony doesn’t startle too bad.
that.”
“You’re such an asshole!” he shouts, but there’s no response. Fucking typical. “He’s probably not going to straight out kill him. Right?” Tony heads towards the elevator, but then pauses when there’s no response. “J?”
“How long was I out there?”
He separated the yolks from a few eggs, setting the whites aside and adding the yolks to his own egg mixture. With the serum, he could never have too much protein.
“You’re talking about that fear like it’s tied only to your family being poor, or you being sick,” Tony says, “but it wasn’t so great being a male omega in the 1920’s.”
"Are you trying to screw us over?"
"Of course," Pepper says, smile sharp and glinting. Tony grins at her.
He pushes himself up. He scrubs an unsteady hand over his eyes. When he looks up, stars—endless, across the ocean, as far as his weak human eyes can see. He remembers the portal, its endless non-Euclidean forms. The vastness of that chitinous army, black carapaces lit by swathes of glowing cosmic dust.
Afterwards, they lay in Tony’s bed together, Tony half-collapsed on Rogers’ chest. The sheriff’s calloused hands swept slow over his spine, fingertips catching on the occasional scar, lingering over the mottled lines of Tony’s body. The sun had long gone down, and in the faintest glow from the stove’s grill, Tony could make out almost nothing of Rogers’ face. He seemed content enough as he was, half-asleep and perusing Tony’s body like he had nowhere else to be.
“You can barely walk.”
“You know how I feel,” Steve says. He’s quiet, but firmer this time. “I just wanna know where we stand. I…you’re a good friend, Tony. I don’t wanna mess that up. I’m sorry I’ve been such a coward about it, but with everything that’s happened, you…” Steve clears his throat.  Tony takes a long sip of coffee. “It’s important to me. This…this. So. If this is what you want, then. Then let me know, and I’ll back off, but if not-”
“I’m afraid I can’t help you,’ JARVIS says primly. Steve lets out a breath, jaw tightening. “Miss Potts would have a word with you, when you have a chance.”
“Well, I kept saying that-”
“You don’t know that,” Pepper says, but her heart isn’t in it. She opens her arms, and Tony slumps forward, pressing his face into the crook of her neck. “I wish you wouldn’t blame yourself for these things. It wasn’t your fault.”
When he opened his eyes, Natasha was watching him, expressionless and patient.
“My brother is more feline than insectoid, ‘tis true,” Thor agrees. Already, there was syrup in his beard. His plate looks like a crime scene set in an IHOP.
He has two shoulder missiles hit the enhanced woman in the sternum, blasting her into the dirt without even turning around. Now that he’s seen her in action, he knows it won’t hold her down for long. He prefers enemies that he can go all out on.
“Yes. It was Loki, all this time, who had been ruling Asgard in Odin’s guise. I had declared my abdication, our father had never officially repudiated him, and our mother was dead. Legally, the throne was his.” He looks up to meet each of their eyes individually, from Natasha’s blank mask to Bruce’s furrowed brows. “He has caused a fair amount of embarrassment for the council and the royal family. We cannot accuse him publically without admitting to Odin’s weakness, and now that he has proven his point, Odin cannot rule without wariness from advisors that before had been content to agree to his every whim. He has proven his superiority to me as ruler of Asgard, as well. Ultimately, this turn of events changes nothing in that regard; I do not want the throne.”
“Gooey,” Tony tells him. He squeezes Steve’s fingers, and Steve blushes prettily. He swallows, brushing his thumb over Tony’s knuckles.
“You’ll come before I fuck you,” Tony said, and Steve whined. “I want you nice and slick for me. I was promised breakfast, and I want you dripping for me-“
Tony laughs into his mouth, pleasure and delight wrapping around him as the muscle contractions make Loki curse, biting at Tony’s neck.
He takes a quick shower because Pepper hates waiting and touches up his goatee, taking extra time to gel back his hair perfectly. He puts on his charcoal Burberry because this meeting calls for Tony Stark, Merchant of Death more than Tony Stark, quirky robo-nerd. The only piece he keeps for himself is Natasha’s last Christmas gift; titanium bolt cufflinks, the centres inset with rubies. He buttons his waistcoat over a wine-red tie, then turns to stare at himself in the mirror.
So here they are, wandering out of the IFC, Tony pressed into the curve of Steve’s body and talking animatedly with his hands. Steve doesn’t want the night to end yet. He feels five years lighter, like Civil War never happened and he and Tony have only ever been best friends. Like he’s just found out that his two best friends are really the same, single, amazing man. Like for the first time, he can reach out and touch Iron Man and find flesh: Tony, warm and living under his heavy, calloused hands.
He follows Tony up through the Triskelion, mostly for lack of anything else to do. Carol’s waiting for him outside, and she puts a silent arm around his shoulders and escorts him through. The way that Tony slumps into her shoulder is painful to watch. Steve desperately wishes he could hug him, but he supposes if he could, Tony wouldn’t be so damn sad.
Stay safe and lmk if there's anything I missed.
“JARVIS,” he says, throat dry all of a sudden, “is Tony home?”
He drags Tony onto the empty court. The street is dark. It’s half gone midnight on Wednesday. The foot traffic is as minimal as it can get in Lower Manhattan, and Steve is deeply grateful for it, because he doesn’t want to share this moment with anyone. He watches Tony strip out of his suit jacket and hang it over a bench. He removes his cufflinks, tucks them into the inside pocket of his suit. He rolls his sleeves up to his elbows.
“You’re my favourite,” he tells him. It’s an old mantra, but Bruce grins anyway. They look at each other for a moment until Bruce turns, rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment and heading out the door. “Thanks for the breakfast!”
Steve closed his eyes obediently, slowing his breathing, adjusting to the scent of pack, of omega, of family. He let himself drift, and sink, until darkness descended upon him, and then he wasn’t aware of anything at all.
Rogers raised an eyebrow at him. “Alright, Stark, that’s it. Come on.”
As he made his way down deeper into the earth, the siren cut out suddenly, emitting a loud whine that made Steve’s ears ache before a soft clicking sound could be heard, then a voice.
“Yeah, probably,” Steve sighs, pulling off his pants, but he’s pretty sure he already gets the joke.
The man takes off his mask, and James Buchannan Barnes stares down at him, a familiar grin spread across his face. His eyes are empty, cold and clear as a fishbowl.
Tony hesitates to assume it’s bigotry or pointed cruelty, although whether or not that’s just wishful thinking remains to be seen. There’s something about Steve’s strung-tight demeanour that grates hard on Tony’s nerves. Tony shifts his weight, awkward, then steels himself. This is his workshop, damnit. He’s not going to let Steve’s…whatever the hell this is get to him. He marches into the room and settles down at the worktop, pulling up the x-rays from Grand Central.
“Hello, Steve,” Tony deadpanned, voice still broadcasting through the speakers via his earpiece. “Fancy meeting you here.”
“What happened?” Tony asks, starting forward. Bruce waves him off.
For a while they just kiss. Steve lets him do as he likes, fingers moving fitfully over Tony’s neck, shoulders, up and down his biceps. When Tony deepens the kiss he buries his fingers into Tony’s hair and moans for him, easy.
Steve quirks his lips. He readjusts himself in his chair. “You already know why I’m here,” he tries, smiling a little, but the professor simply studies him. He looks down at his hands, then glances out the window. Outside, a brunette woman with a shock of white hair chases a laughing student through the air. Both of them fly like they were born doing it.
“Stark,” Rogers slurred, leaning back into Tony’s chest. Tony let out a huffing breath, allowing himself to press his nose to Rogers’ cold temple. The man didn’t even have a damn coat on.
“Cap,” Natasha said, inclining her head, and Steve grinned at the scene in front of him. Thor was sitting on the back of the couch, dead last, brow furrowed as he bent over the controller. Clint was sitting cross-legged on the ground between Natasha’s feet, both she and Tony perched on the couch. The table was littered with the remnants of pizza and beer.
“You saw him?” Tony says, eyes alight, but it dies when Peter shakes his head.
“Yeah,” he says. “I do.”
Tony stared at him for a long while, then reached out slowly, as if to avoid spooking him. He took the very edge of the rolled-up towel with those graceful fingers of his, then stepped back again.
“It’s not that I’m not interested in being honest,” Steve says, slowly, pushing his errant thoughts aside. “I wouldn’t have come here if I wasn’t interested. But you’ve gotta understand, I grew up in a different time. Talking about this stuff…”
“I’m…yeah, I have CAH, but I mean, Steve is… he’s Captain America for fuck’s sake, I don’t-”
Cap looks like he's gonna burst a vein.
Steve considers this. He wants to ask if that’s how Hill feels now that her position at SHIELD is gone, or if maybe he’s misinterpreting her statement as meaning more than it is. He doesn’t think she’s just talking about the movie.
“Let me take the edge off,” Steve says, and then he’s trailing his mouth down, and down, and Tony tips his head back and submits himself to the warm ministrations of his mouth.
“I don’t need to walk when I’ve got the suit. Go.”
Steve’s chest is tight. His throat feels raw, and he puts the box of cookies carefully on the edge of the worktop to prevent himself from crushing it. He can hear Tony curse under his breath.
The laugh that emanates from the other side of the bed is rough, rumbling. “The only kind of military I feel like right now is a POW parched for water,” Steve deadpans, which, huh. Is actually pretty damn flattering. Steve lets out a heaving sigh. “Alright. Jeez, Tony.”
“The third floor of a nearby building was housing a delegation of humanitarian workers from Wakanda. There was an explosion, involving Moonstone and a doombot. I’m not clear on the details, and all the footage released online so far has been too shaky to clarify things. The Hulk was the only one on the scene.”
“Yeah,” Steve rasped. “I’m very jealous, and I need to claim you as mine. Now.”
There was a long silence at the table.
“So what,” Tony says, gesturing with the comb, “I’m a quick bang for shock value?”
“We’re listening,” Bruce said, and something in his eyes made Steve pause. He knew, Steve realised. Of all people, Bruce must know. He was probably the one who was providing Tony the medication, running his check-ups. Bruce must have known the whole time.
Tony startles, spinning around to see Loki standing behind him. “
“You’ll be awake soon, Steve,” Hank reassures him. He opens up the cryochamber, reaches down to gently touch the skin at the side of Steve’s neck with one large blue hand. “We’ll be monitoring your vitals.”
"Thor tells me you can't break a vow. Some sort of gods' thing, especially true for mages." Loki stills, and turns back to look at him. Tony rests his elbows on the bar. "We both want to manipulate each other. So let's put a little insurance in, shall we?"
“That’s no excuse,” Steve says, and Tony’s head snaps up to look at him. His eyes are focussed, gleaming with curiosity, and Steve finds himself blushing for no good reason other than that Tony’s looking at him. “We had, uh.” He clears his throat. “Gay people? Back in my day. Howard had the power to create and change the future. Just like you.”
“J, send a legionnaire down here to back me up.”
“He’ll fight you.”
“I can feel it when it happens!”
“I don’t like commands,” Tony bites out, because that-…well, frankly, is an egregious fucking lie 99% of the time. He’s no stranger to power play, and he’s more than happy to take commands in the bedroom, or give them besides. But still. He keeps himself pliant, enough that Steve can move him how he wants, and hopes that’s enough for the spell to be satisfied.
Usually, he touches inanimate objects without thinking. It’s when he’s trying that he can’t quite manage it, and he doesn’t understand why that would be true. He can’t figure out touching Tony at all. He’d think it was when his emotions were running high, but he’d tried to touch Tony in the car at his funeral, and he’d been plenty upset then. He has better success, he thinks, when he’s trying to comfort Tony in some way. But then, he’d touched Tony’s neck to catch himself in the cemetery.
“Doesn’t anyone care what happened to him?” Tony asks, but there’s no malice in it.
Natasha was watching them with narrowed eyes, but there was mirth easily readable in her body, the way her mouth moved when she reached for her cup of tea and blew across the top.
Xavier smiles wryly. “I’m sure they did. They had a use for you, after all. Or was it someone else who burned SHIELD’s headquarters to the ground?”
“Yeah,” Tony panted, lifting his hips, and Steve pressed a small kiss to his belly in silent thanks. He pulled Tony’s sweatpants and briefs off in one smooth motion, then swooped back down to nose gently at the side of Tony’s cock. “Steve.”
“I thought we were allies, at least,” Tony says, watching the counter. He broadcasts his voice to Rhodey’s helmet. “But I’m not so stupid as to trust him. Now!”
“Please,” Steve whispers, and Tony sinks into him at the sound of it. He presses a desperate kiss to Tony’s temple, holding him as tight as he dares. “Please, Tony. Just talk to me.”
“Okay what?”
Evan falters. “I’m not sure…he’d fit in any of Mr. Stark’s cars…”
Mercifully, Tony turns around to wash his hands in the kitchen sink. Steve glances over at Peter, who’s staring into his plate like it holds the secret of the universe in it. He looks…sad.
Steve was the urban dictionary definition of a service top. All he wanted was to give Tony exactly what would make him come apart, mindless with pleasure. So Tony had learned, with the delight of unwrapping a brand new toy, that on the days when Tony was feeling more aggressive Steve was more than happy to roll over and take it.
“Tony,” Bruce says, expression unbearably kind, and Tony lets out a rough breath. “What’s going on?”
They circle each other warily. The living room is a wreck. Broken dishware and the shattered remains of a wooden end-table line the floor. The glass top from it is spiderwebbed where the corner hit the slate tile that covers the communal floor, white lines racing up and through the square pane like lightning. Tony watches them, and winces when Clint tries to stand and puts his hand down into a pile of plate shards. He’s stoic as he attempts to lurch to his feet, pieces of glass and china still embedded in his knees.
“I don’t think I’ve come that quickly since I was fourteen, so I mean, good job,” he continues, because Loki has done nothing good for his tendency to mouth off in the face of danger of bodily harm. “A plus, that was hot as Pompeii on a bad day, I mean, Jesus-”
Tony smiles at him, leaning back against the counter and crossing his arms. He doesn’t have his bracelets, but he knows JARVIS is listening. “And why would you do that? I’m a big boy.”
Tony takes a deep breath, holds it. He can feel himself tapping on the arc reactor, that old nervous habit of his. He can feel his chest expanding under his fingers, the change in timbre in the clink of the crystal, the way his breath shakes in his chest.
“Hey now,” Tony says, but there’s no heat in it. Reed is as notorious for his tunnel vision as Tony is for his distractibility. It is indisputable: facts of their universe.
was the honey trap. And then, after the first time…” He winces, stops talking.
“Yes,” Tony hissed, and then his mouth was on Steve’s neck, and everything else fled from Steve’s mind like gossamer on the wind.
Steve pushes to his feet and walks over, perching one hip on the edge of the sleeping bench.
“Bring it, Tinman.”
"Sir, it's Captain Rogers."
, you should have a general idea of what that means, but-”
“This isn’t for us,” she explains, catching his look.
“Bruce.”
“You’re such a little shit,” Tony said, tugging painfully at Steve’s hair in a way that made him melt bonelessly into the couch.
“I see,” Loki says, expression serious, and Tony restrains a smile. “Thank you for the…new experience. I have preparations to make.”
“It’s just, after your runs,” Tony said, sounding panicked now. Steve frowned at him, watching as Tony took another step back, his hands splayed out in front of him. “I don’t want you to think I don’t respect you, Cap. I never meant to make you feel like you weren’t safe, or welcome-”
Steve could feel the ache of him like a missing limb. The pain of knowing his bondmate was suffering and being absolutely unable to do anything about it was a howling, shaking gale force of a thing inside his chest. Every day he woke up and tracked down Hydra agents in Eastern Europe, bashing in skulls with Thor while they waited for the brains and spies on the team to figure something out. Every day, he took a shower, and he shaved, and he moved with what felt like stones piling up inside of his chest. Every time he wanted to sit down and sob, he couldn’t, so he swallowed it. And every time, he could swear he felt the lump in his throat settle inside of him. He was getting so full of stones, soon his lungs would be full up. Every day that passed without news, Steve felt like it was harder to breathe.
“Oh,” Steve said, and it felt like his entire face had been lit aflame. He’d never seen Tony blush, but he looked just as embarrassed, his throat moving in a swallow. “
“Nothing,” Steve says, and Tony squints at him.
Tony fights him, knees weakening, but Loki holds him easily. He lets Tony sink to the floor, then protects him with his body, breathing slow and holding Tony as he tries to match him. “What the hell do you want?” Tony snarls, struggling again, but Loki only shakes his head. He rolls his skull back and forth along Tony’s, skin cool and dry.
Logan winces, and Steve laughs outright. “I like teaching combat, better.”
Tony lifted his glass, a wry grin spreading over his mouth. “I recall something about water into wine, wine into blood being a part of the good Lord’s word. Am I wrong?”
“Not like that,” he says. He laughs a little incredulously, because,
“Nah,” Clint says, and Tony drizzles a little more of Clint’s magic sauce over an apple layer before starting again. “Nat and I love each other, and I expect we always will. But she’s my best friend, you know?”
Steve is watching him, that observant gaze that has been the death of Tony’s posturing more than once sending his pulse skittering.
“I did,” he says.
“I guess I should go,” Steve said, and Tony flinched bodily away from him. “Tony?”
“What-“
They live together, he and Steve are best friends. They’ve memorized each other’s schedules. And while that’s great for Tony if he wants to make sure he’s not in the kitchen like he always is when Cap bounces in post-jog, flushed and sweating and unfairly gorgeous after having run something close to twenty miles, it also means that Cap knows exactly where to find him.
“Happy Hogan.”
me here?”
“Mine,” he whispered, pulling back just the barest breath, and Steve closed his eyes and tipped his head back in submission. “Fuck,
Tony sighs. “I’m sorry-” he begins, but Steve only hushes him again.
“Steve,” he says, tired, “don’t ask for what I can’t give you. Please.”
“Fine,” he says, grim. “I shall be happy to deliver bloodshed with my hands alone.”
They don’t run into anyone in the elevators, thankfully. Tony performs his nightly ablutions without much fanfare, and Steve watches him while sitting on the bathroom counter, his knee and shin flush with Tony’s side as he brushes his teeth, washes his face, puts all sorts of products on his olive skin that make it gleam in the warm pendant lights that hang decadently overhead. He follows Tony into bed when he climbs in clad only in clinging black briefs, doesn’t even bother to try to keep his hands to himself. Instead he cuddles up and around him, pulling Tony’s face into his neck and rubbing his hands over the firm, rolling planes of Tony’s strong back. He imagines having a body again, Tony underneath him, watching the muscles flex as Tony writhes in the sheets. It’s enough to make him inhale, shuddering and slow.
“Tony?” Steve tries.
“He told me to make nice with you.”
“I do, sir.” Tony clears his throat and swipes at his face again. “I’ve been given ample reason, over the years.”
“Any man who comes into contact with her is in danger of falling under her spell. She will remind you of your first time at the ol’ drive in, your lady friends, that one girl you had a crush on in kindergarten, and even your mother. You will not be able to hurt her because you won’t want to. I have seen her teleport, and I don’t know what other capabilities she has, but I do know she was a student of Loki’s.” There’s a few murmurs at that, and Tony nods, then shoots Coulson a look that he hopes efficiently communicates his desire for the man to say absolutely nothing in response to his next piece of information. “Now, we have a little magical backing of our own, an asset that Natasha Romanov and I are working to turn. Thanks to our asset, Clint Barton and I are protected from Amora’s magic, and as far as we can tell, it doesn’t work on women.” Tony pauses. “Actually, not sure about gay men or lesbians, there’s a thought. Or trans people. Or maybe Agent Romanov is special. We’ll find out.”
“Steve,” Tony said helplessly, and Steve leaned up to kiss him on the mouth. He ran his fingers over the firm ridges of Tony’s abdomen, inching his shirt up. Tony rocked back, pulling it off, and Steve leaned in and pressed a kiss to the centre of the arc reactor, the edge above his heart, his chest. He glanced up at Tony, stopping short of his nipple. “Yes.”
The first thing he did was take a shower. He used Tony’s body wash, needing the scent to ground him. He rummaged in the laundry and pulled out one of Tony’s ubiquitous band T-shirts, pressing his face to the fabric to inhale the sweet scent of musk and metal, of dying leaves in water at the height of autumn, of electricity and that sharp tang of something else that Steve hadn’t been able to place but always made him think of the reactor.
“Is that what I’m doing?” Tony asks, terror creeping over him in a prickling wave. “Oh, god, I couldn’t even manage one relationship with one of my best and oldest friends. And I was
“Where is Thor?” the woman snarls. Thick, blonde hair falls to her waist in soft waves, framing a beautiful, angular face and high cheekbones. She’s draped in lush greens and golds, a horned headdress framing her face, and Tony taps a metal finger on his chin. Behind him, he can hear footsteps, and he relaxes a bit knowing he’s no longer alone on the roof with a magic wielder. Again.
“No,” Tony says, but it’s not in answer to his question. That much is obvious to Steve as well, who looks a little like he’s going to be ill. “No, no, no, Steve! We are walking a knife’s edge right now! If your old buddy, an enhanced, shows up and kills someone-”
“Not Clint?” Steve asked, but Bruce shook his head.
“I want to apologise,” Steve begins, and Tony sighs and waves a hand at him.
Steve scowled at Tony’s teasing. He didn’t think that was very funny.
Every once in a while, Riri would chime in with an update about Tony.
“Because you love me?” Tony says, trying for a grin.
Still, he knows Cap’s biology. Maybe better than Cap does, even, and certainly better than the average doctor. This was Howard’s great triumph, and he knows what Cap’s metabolism, stamina, vitals should be. He knows that Cap has been well taken care of, physically; all the better to get the secret of the serum out of him.
Tony frowns. That’s probably not good. “Patch him through.” He stands, deciding that whatever it is that has Rhodey calling on the clock probably requires a drink. “Sugarplum! To what do I owe this pleasure?”
“I should stop messing up,” Steve mutters, and Tony snorts. He wipes his hands on a paper towel as he walks back towards the workbench.
“Steve, you despise politicians. You hate talking to them. You hate saluting to them. You hate going to meetings where everyone argues policy for two hours and nothing gets done.” Tony laughs, bitter and fond, a strange combination if Steve’s ever heard it. “You’re such a hypocrite, you didn’t even show up to the damn hearings post-Potomac. You had Natasha handle it for you.”
“I did not care for what I saw.”
“Sure I am. What, out of practice?”
“I want to touch you,” Tony says, and Steve freezes. A blush works its way across the bridge of his nose, over his cheeks. “Steve?”
“This alright?” Steve asks him, and Tony swallows. His fingers twitch on the controls, and he pulls them into his lap.
When Steve presses Tony’s wrist to his bonding gland, he keeps his eyes squeezed shut. Tony’s thankful for it, in a way. He doesn’t know what he would do if he had to look at Steve while it was happening. This is already more intimate than anything he’s ever done with anyone. He feels like his heart is going to crawl out of his chest.
“Can you…?”
They cleared the last two rooms with relative ease, although everyone was absolutely exhausted at that point. Steve felt like he was moving on autopilot, limbs hollow and made of lead.
“Caught somewhere half-between, huh?” Banner said, wry, and Steve spared him a chagrined expression. “I’m fine with it being Tony, but I think you all knew that.”
“Roll call?”
Tony just waves a hand. “It’s not that,” he says. “Ah, I forget how young you are.”
“Steve’s more sensitive than you,” Pepper sniffs. “Beth and I agreed, you’d never ask Steve out. You don’t think you’re good enough for him. Which is silly, by the way. You’re plenty good enough.”
Next (and final) chapter will be posted by the end of the week. Just finessing the ending.
The worst part of this stalemate with Pepper was that before this, Steve and Pepper had been something approaching friends. They both liked art and culture, and they both worried incessantly about Tony. They’d had some excellent conversations about Basquiat and Haring and other artists that Steve had missed. They’d even been to MoMA together with Tash.
“Miss Potts said to tell you that there will be a quiz.”
So Steve pulled back, moaning low and deep as he did, and swirled his tongue under the head of Tony’s cock in the way that always made him keen. Tony’s fingers pushed into his hair, grabbing hold as his cock began to pulse on Steve’s tongue, and he groaned in soft appreciation as Tony came in his mouth, swallowing him down. He reached a hand down into his sweats, wrapping one hand around his own dripping cock to give it a few strokes as Tony shook apart underneath him, thighs trembling from the effort as he gasped. When Steve glanced back up at him, still suckling gently at his cock, his eyes were wild, mouth red and shining and open. He looked decadent, and Steve just wanted to devour him.
Tony’s sitting at the kitchen island on Sunday morning, sipping something green and soupy and wearing a black button up and slacks. He looks tired. The bruise around his eye is dark purple, angry red at the corners. His lip is scabbed and swollen, and Steve freezes in the doorway and hovers there, unsure of how to proceed.
It was a long time before either of them spoke, Steve processing what Tony had said, realigning his understanding of the situation. He had wondered for a long time how no one had known, how someone as scrutinised as Tony had kept this a secret for all these years. Tony had made sure to kill every member of the Ten Rings that had been a part of his kidnapping, and the surgeon who had helped him in Afghanistan was dead. Knowing that he’d been groomed for this, that he’d been like this since he was a child, made a terrible kind of sense. In some ways, it was good for Tony, who clearly wanted to be stealth and had managed to stay that way for over forty years. Still, Steve couldn’t help but wonder how lonely he must have been. Had he been able to talk about it to anyone? Did Pepper even know? Did Rhodes?
Steve nods. He loosens his grip slightly, but the wild expression that overtakes Tony’s face draws him back in. He takes another unsteady breath. “Okay. So…”
“I know,” Steve grated out, and Clint stared at him for three long breaths before Natasha’s hand on his shoulder pulled him away. “Thank you.”
Steve opens his mouth, then closes it again. He takes a slow, deep breath. “I don’t want to be a burden to you while you’re working, Tony. If my being there would help you, I’ll come. But if I’ll just be in the way, then I don’t have to. I can’t tell what you want; you have to tell me.”
"I trust your judgement."
“I don’t know what you mean,” JARVIS says primly, and Steve grins for what feels like the first time in years.
“Shut up!” He glances around, peeking at the news cameras very obviously trained on Stephen. They can’t see Tony from where they are, but that doesn’t really matter. “We’re under the eye of the fourth estate right now, remember?”
“Told me what?” Tony asks, and Shuri spares him with a Look.
“Okay,” Steve says, embarrassment and dread curling in his stomach unpleasantly. “I…is this going to tell me something about Tony that I shouldn’t know?”
“Is that in conflict with my point?”
– Mary Oliver, “In Blackwater Woods”
“Almost there, hold on,” Hawkeye says, voice toneless and slightly out of breath.
Steve frowns. “This isn’t about sex. That’s why I’m asking. I told him that, so I hope he’s not thinking that’s-”
“You’re handling nothing. You’re being a bluenose yellow bastard, and you know it. It ain’t like you.” Bucky throws the towel back, catching him in the back of the head, and the razor slips against the pad of his thumb. Dull metal slices into the meat of him, and he pulls back, hissing and sucking at the cut. Fat drops of red curdle in the washing bowl, mixing pink in the cloudy water.
Tony closes his eyes, takes a breath. “I don’t know,” he admits. “I have to find out who else is on the council.”
“Do you know what Tony’s going to say to them?” Steve asked.
Tony gapes at him. “
“You…Tony, you have a soulmate! You Sight Bonded to
“I didn’t know we were taking our relationship here,” she says, and Tony barks out a laugh despite himself. Natasha’s body language softens, strangely, at the sound of it. She looks…relieved. “I assume you’re taking me downstairs.”
Pepper gapes at him.
“You didn’t notice him getting into bed?” Pepper asks archly, and Tony absolutely does not have enough of his bearing to process this situation.
,” Loki says, tone unreadable, and Tony cackles. “Not wholly unpleasant. The meat is sweet. Delicate.”
“You need help on Amora,” Tony says, glancing at the display. Sure enough, a magical bolt crumbles the edge of the roof just where Clint had been leaning. The elevator doors open, and Tony shoots down four hydra scientists immediately. Strucker is nowhere to be seen. “Too late, I’m here already.”
Tony swallows. Right. Okay. “Wait, just, one sec.”
“Stop thanking me,” Tony grumbles. “Jesus, Steve.”
Steve muses,
Tony’s expression is dubious, but whatever he might have said in response to that is forestalled by Strange arriving back in the room with a tattered black book, marked with symbols Steve does not recognise.
“Look,” he says, and Steve turns his attention back to the screen. “J, skip to where Cap orders me to let him take care of me.”
“We can’t take her. She was holding back because she’s not in charge and Loki was grandstanding, but if Amora lets her loose she could do some real damage. We’ll have to put Thor or the Hulk on her.” Tony sits down on a stool and pushes off the workbench, wheeling over to the display controls. He pulls up the battle footage. “Send this to Bruce, show him the suit damage. He can factor it in to whatever intel Loki gives him.”
“I won’t know until I draw up some bloodwork.”
Tony stops, then turns to stare at him. Loki’s face is placid, expression patient, but there’s something lurking behind his eyes that Tony can’t quite puzzle out. When he blinks, it’s been replaced by exasperation.
. It looks almost as if he’s sweating. A fine sheen of liquid dots his body’s brow. He’s being defrosted. The chamber is thawing out.
Steve winces, because he doesn’t have anything good to say to that.
When he was finally able to make it to the Google homepage, he still didn’t know if he was making the right choice. He shouldn’t have gone looking in the cabinet. It was none of his business what Tony was taking, and why, if it wasn’t integral to his overall health.
Tony blinks at him. “Did you…come? Already?” He takes a moment, fighting the broad grin that wants to break over his face. “Did you come from blowing me, because that’s honestly the best thing I’ve ever heard-”
In the end, Pepper never went back to the mansion. She’d developed what he would probably best categorise as a wary amusement towards Loki, like the way tourists looked at the tigers licking ineffectively at blood ice blocks behind thick glass at The Bronx Zoo. Loki had never stopped sleeping in his bed, and he and Steve had gone back to their regularly scheduled programming of sparring and light banter, although the UST was getting so thick Tony was pretty sure it was starting to register on JARVIS’ atmospheric controls. Steve’s first appointment was on Friday, and Tony had been putting off talking to Loki about it because he had no idea what the hell to say to him. Instead they’d just all continued on like life was normal, aside from the influx of Superbad left over from the Pleasant Hill outbreak. On Monday, Natasha and a handful of SHIELD agents had shut down a hostage situation of Marx Brothers proportions; two men, calling themselves The Brothers Grimm, had taken Del Posto in Chelsea. Something about magically being able to conjure weapons made from fairy tales. One of them had thrown an honest to god pie at Natasha, and apparently a horde of blackbirds had flown out and tried to peck her in the eyes. Thank god magic birds still died from bullets.
“You stay, too,” he says.
“A declaration! I’m touched,” Tony crows. He spreads his hands, takes that last step, lets himself fall backwards into the clouds. “Don’t wait up!”
“That would depend on the nature of the question,” JARVIS said, sounding more puzzled than anything else.
He thinks, possibly, they’ve both been idiots.
“He called me a jerk. If that’s not Steve, I don’t know what is.”
“Loki, what are you up to?” she says, touching her chest briefly. Then she disappears in a gaudy flash of pale green light.
“Thank you.” He touches Loki’s cheek with his nose, breathing in the scent of leather and pine and earth. “You’re uniquely suited to understand my position, and we both know it.”
Steve ducks his head to hide a sheepish laugh. It’s not very effective. “Yeah, I know you. You’re gonna be bringing this up in fifty years when we’re old and grey and sitting in rocking chairs.”
“It means I’ve got to go back to the workshop and dust off some analytic programs I haven’t had to run in a very long time.”
Steve worries at his lip, then types one last query into the computer. A slow, wry smile breaks over his face.
Tony grins, and lets himself be smug because that’s what Beth would expect. “He needed a shower,” he says breezily, waving a hand and walking back towards his work station. “All that lifting and carrying. He worked up a real sweat.”
“Which is why we ended things,” Pepper says, shrugging. “But you are mistaken if you still think that what Tony needs is a minder, like he is a wayward child that requires directing. You have learned absolutely nothing from this whole ordeal. What Tony needs is someone to remind him to be selfish. To take care of himself, not just physically, but also emotionally. Because if we let him, his guilt over what Obie did would have him tearing out his own damaged heart to hand over to the first person who asked for it.”
And then he got to one knee, and the screaming grew so loud that Steve’s ears rang painfully. Pepper’s entire face drained of colour, and she turned around and pulled her phone out, dialling and putting it to her ear. She was likely already on damage control. Hundreds of employees had pulled out their phones, probably livestreaming to the internet, but Steve couldn’t care less about any of that. (Okay, maybe he was a little sorry for Pepper.) He could hear multiple people yelling “is this real?” and “oh my god,” a chorus of joyful incredulity to buoy him.
“Steve-”
“And you won’t stop him. I got it.”
“Okay,” Bruce says, smiling.
“What-”
Well. Nice to see some things don’t change.
Steve doesn’t have anything to say to that.
“I love you. I could never hurt you intentionally. Or.” Steve stops, grimacing, because they both know that isn’t necessarily always true. “When I’m in control, I wouldn’t. And I’ll try. I’ll try not to get so mad.”
“Alright,” he says. “Alright.” He sighs, and wipes a tired hand over his face. “He was at Avery Yamashita’s parents’ house this morning. They live in Bansall, CA. He wanted them to know what happened to their kid. If he’s on schedule, he’s headed to Cape May, NJ now, visiting the Thomases. He took the suit. He’ll be back tonight.”
you would enjoy.
“Y’know,” Steve begins, a nasty twist to his mouth, “that’s pretty hypocritical of you, considering-”
Steve raises his eyebrows at him, and manfully does not make the obvious joke. Tony stares at him, then rolls his eyes, rocking back on his heels. “Really, Steve?”
“Um,” he said. “Sorry.” And then he turned and headed towards the elevator.
“A decade,” he whispers. “Over a decade.
And then, about half an hour later when Steve was helping SHIELD cart away a series of Hydra computer banks: “Tony says: watch the tech, Spangles. He’s planning to pick through it when he’s out of here.”
“I resent that remark, Ms. Cabe,” Steve says, but he’s grinning, and Tony throws his hands up and turns his attention back to cutting plexiglass into the hundreds of uniform rectangles that will make up the Empire State Building’s many windows. “Isn’t Watson the minder, and the detective the one who instigates all of Sherlock’s shenanigans?”
Steve lay in their bed on his back, breathing slowly. Absently, he reached up to touch the newly-formed bondmark on his throat. It was still scabbed over, raw and sore, but soon enough it would scar: a pale, shining seam in two parenthetical lines, small rounded bumps for each of Tony’s canines.
“Ah,” Tony said, and just like that, his face began to shut down.
“Great,” Tony says, clapping his hands together. “Here’s what we’re gonna do. Fill up my schedule. And I mean really fill it. Everything Pepper’s been desperate to get me to do, for the next two weeks, just fill it right up. Routine factory inspection in Bangladesh? Let’s go. Glad-handing for the Maria Stark foundation? Sounds fun. Can’t obey what I’m not around to hear.”
it to be my business who you sleep with in the future, so-”
,” Steve’s voice cuts in, and oh boy does he sound wrecked. “Tony, can you hear us?”
“You can’t keep me safe forever, Tony,” Bruce says. His voice is gentle, even as it strikes Tony to his core. “You’re just one man.”
“I don’t know,” Steve says, honest. No one’s ever accused him of anything less than that. “I should hope so, right?”
“Yeah.”
Loki puts his mouth on every square inch of his body in the shower, or at least that’s what it feels like. They’re both panting for it, so Tony blows him in the shower while opening him up with his fingers, then has him over the sink where their blurry reflection slowly clears to reveal Loki’s face, flushed red and gasping. When he comes for the third time, Tony comes with him, and then they have a long bath in the jet tub, just because they can.
“I’m afraid you’ve just missed him. I’m not sure where he went, or when he will return. I can call Doctor Banner from his lab, however.”
“Gonna offer me a glass of warm milk to sleep, too?” Natasha says, and Tony huffs a laugh. “I’m a big girl, Tony.” She approximates a smile, flashing a taunting curl of lip. “You might want to go and soothe Steve’s ego.”
And then he stops, and the lights dim. Blessed darkness covers the room, and Tony wipes a hand over his face, gasping in relief.
“How was D.C.?”
Pepper spreads her hands, and Tony scrolls through the intel she’s handed him, wincing at some of the more…conservative proposals being suggested.
A familiar tug breaks Steve out of his self-deprecating reverie, and he fights it a little, because that’s how he’s had the most success. He doesn’t know what else to do. He holds his ground, fingers reaching out ineffectually to try to grasp the bathroom counter and going right through.
“I kind of thought we were coming up here to talk about…us,” Steve says, a sinking feeling building in his gut, because he doesn’t think that’s what’s about to happen.
Tony can feel his brows rising, almost against his will. His tongue feels like lead in his throat. “Okaaay,” he says, dragging the word out. He has a bad feeling about this. “Cap, when do you think you’ll be cleared for the field?”
“I think we should go home,” she said, and Steve blanched.
“Was it…was it because of what Amora did?” he asks. “I know that I was a trigger for you for a while, but you came back here, to me, anyway. And I know Barnes-”
“Why?” Tony asks, frustration building up in him, and now it’s Steve’s turn to lean in. He presses a soft kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth, smoothing his hands over Tony’s sides. Tony’s head is pounding, now, a slow, steady throb of pain that means he needs to either take some meds and sleep or get to the sex sooner rather than later.
, the taste of him still lingering in Steve’s mouth. “Yeah,” Steve rasped, and it came out weak. “He is.” He cleared his throat, running a hand over his hair. “What can I do?”
“Sorry,” Steve murmurs, taking Tony’s face between his hands. He presses their foreheads together. “I’m sorry.”
“How is that sound not irritating the hell out of you?” Tony said, laughing, and Steve blinked confusedly at him. “The fridge?”
Tony shrugs. “Oyster?”
“I can confirm, sir was absolutely surprised after your last battle with The Wrecking Crew.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Calm down before you hurt yourself,” Tony snorts, and Steve chances a glance up at him. Tony’s using a dirty shop rag to wipe the worst of the oil off of his fingertips. He’s smiling, if only the smallest bit. “You’re just digging the hole deeper.”
"Sorry."
leads back to this: the fires
His dreams are the best they’ve been since he woke up in the future.
“Widow,” he warns, and Natasha smiles at him.
“Lock it down, JARVIS,” Tony said, walking towards him, and Steve couldn’t have stopped looking if he wanted to.
“Okay, that’s enough sharing time,” Tony says, gesturing with his now empty cup. Bruce takes it away and walks over to the coffee maker for a refill. “Er, thanks.”
“What?” Tony asks.
“Please, please,
“I triggered your latent childhood trauma,” Tony says, mouth curling into a self-deprecating smile. “Always knew someone who got beat up so much had to come out with a little more than a mean temper and a stubborn streak deeper than the Mariana.”
“Do you see how much come I’m covered in?” Tony demanded. “I am not about to sit here and debate your virility right now. You are literally engineered to be the peak of human perfection. Now get that smoking hot ass of yours up, and help me get clean.”
Tony pushes the button to start the brush cycle. “Tell me, then,” he says, gesturing with the toothbrush. “Tell me your side of the story.”
“No, no,” Tony says, but there’s something happening inside of him. Something bubbling up in his chest.
amount of kill assists.” Tony flashes a bitter smile. "I understand him. I was..."
The next time Steve wakes, it’s to screaming chaos. Everything is bright, and loud, a woman’s sobbing shrieks echoing through his skull. Pain and grief sweep through him like a sandstorm, razing every inch of his mind.
R.O.C. Tampa Branch Laboratory
Tony’s pulse is thundering in his ears. He can’t seem to get his bearings. Bruce takes a sip of his tea, then pushes his glasses up into his hair and pinches his nose. His eyes are pained and somewhat embarrassed when he meets Tony’s wide gaze. “Steve is a lot of things, but emotionally perceptive isn’t one of them, so you’re going to have to be the one to do something. If not, he’ll just keep wallowing until he falls for someone else. When that happens, you’ll be a wreck, and I’ll have to say I told you so. So don’t wait that long. For me.”
of his body.
“Tony!” Tony says, delighted.
“While I do…feel, in some ways, sir, I do not have hormonal changes. I cannot experience the reaction created by one being touching another. The gains you might receive from any romantic or physical relationship are unquantifiable to one such as myself. I can only measure your biometrics, and from that approximate some meagre objective measure of happiness by which to compare. Doctor Banner makes you happy, but you are not physically attracted to him. You are physically attracted to Agent Romanov, but she does not make you happy. Being with Captain Rogers makes you happy when you are not fighting, and you are physically attracted to him. The issue lies in how often you fight.”
Tony loses himself for longer than he means to. Steve is warm everywhere Tony is touching him, slick and wet and beading with delicious sweat. He wonders, idly, if perhaps octopodes are able to taste through their tentacles somehow, the way narwhals can sense salinity with their horns. He’s feeling things he isn’t sure he could describe in human terms. Everything, all around him, is Steve. Steve.
“You smell real good,” he burrs, his accent thick. His voice is the kind of low engine purr that Tony can feel in his skull, his throat, under his hands. “Tony.”
“Fuck you, too, buddy,” Clint snarled, and Steve burst out laughing. Tony tilted his head back with a bright grin, and Steve couldn’t help but lean over the back of the couch and kiss him. It was strange, kissing Tony upside down, but kind of nice, too. It made it easier to slide their tongues together, to taste the garlic and red pepper flakes on Tony’s breath, to slide his hands over Tony’s chest and neck and feel him purring.
“Paranoia doesn’t suit you, sir.”
“Cap, if Hasegawa makes contact, Tony dies, do you hear me?” War Machine says, cutting him off. Tony snarls a low layer of curses in Italian.
The corner of Natasha’s mouth twitches. Tony knows this smile: it’s patronising. Pity. Tony can relate. Sometimes, Steve can sound so naïve.
“Tony,” Steve rumbles, and Tony smiles, leaning into kiss him. He gets a sharp bite for his trouble, Steve sucking his tongue into his mouth and moaning like he was made for it. It makes Tony forget himself, his hips thrusting against Steve’s for one delicious, vision-blurring moment of pleasure.
“These are…is this what I think it is?”
Tony spares her a glance. She’s still on the floor, mostly motionless except for the occasional twitch. Tony limps around to get a better look at the machines.
Steve shook his head. “I don’t know. I could take some emergency suppressants, but…”
“Steve?” Tony says, turning to face him. Steve reaches out, brushes his fingers against his hand for the barest moment before his fingers go right through again.
“Hey,” Steve says, reaching a hand out. He closes it over Tony’s wrist, a streak of grey smudging over Tony’s skin. “You’re not a screw-up. And that’s not… You have triggers. I know that better than anyone. You’ve never lashed out like that at Bruce, or Natasha-”
.” Tony’s mouth twists into a bitter sneer, but he can’t help it. “
“Okay,” he tells himself. He cracks a small smile, tremulous and bitter enough to make Steve hate it. “Up and at ‘em, Avenger. That’s what you’d say, right?”
He unscrews the lube as he’s sucking, dipping his fingers into the container and sliding them together. The sound they make is filthy. Tony’s always loved that. Steve can definitely hear it, because he bucks his hips up in anticipation, begging, “Tony, please, come on,” and how can Tony say no to that? He presses one finger in, waiting for Steve’s body to get used to the breach. He’s tight, but the sound that Steve makes is desperate, his hips kicking up a little into Tony’s mouth.
, he thinks, and starts up the pace again. With every impact of his feet on the pavement, he feels it. I'm lucky. I’m lucky I'm alive.
“Aye.”
“Excuse me?”
“That’s also possible.”
A chill skitters over Tony’s spine at the idea of Hasegawa’s tech in someone else’s hands. “Strucker broke them out, I’m guessing?”
“Then I guess I better get reading.”
He’d been up late last night working on strategies to contain the fallout from the UN decision, drafting both scenarios with and without Loki hypothetically succeeding in his quest to have Gyrich removed from the committee. He’d pulled Pepper in as well, but she’d begged off at 1 o’ clock. She was exhausted, and she had to fly to Cali on Monday to take care of some things at SI’s HQ. Tony had considered bringing Natasha in, but he didn’t want JARVIS waking her up if she was sleeping. It had been a rough week, and the Avengers as a whole were equally tired and on-edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. They knew that the Nigerian government didn’t have the necessary infrastructure to contain enhanced criminals of the calibre that they’d been presented with. Tony knew that SHIELD had been in communication with the NIA, but ultimately that was a political manoeuvre that he had absolutely no position for negotiation in. Much like Steve, he didn’t trust SHIELD as far as he could throw the helicarrier, which was to say not at all. He wasn’t sure where exactly he wanted the Boy Scouts of Evil held, but he didn’t particularly like any of his options at the moment. It seemed better to stay out of it and let someone else deal with the problem, or worst case scenario, the fall when it all blew to shit.
“Nothing.”
“You’re right,” he murmured into Tony’s ear, pressing his face into hair damp with sweat. Tony smelled incredible, musk and metal and heat, and Steve took a deep breath, his exhale shaky. “I’m just a desperate omega for you, alpha. Just a hot, wet, willing place for your knot. Always. Any time you want me. Every time you want me-“
Tony tilts his head up, leans in for another soft kiss. He presses his forehead to Steve’s, brushes their noses together. “I’m really trying.”
Eventually, Tony had learned his triggers. Naps were one, surprisingly; Tony could go for days without sleeping and then crash, but interrupting a REM cycle was a surefire way to trigger a migraine. Acute pain was another, as well as excessive sleep. But every once in a while, they snuck up on him, sure and inevitable as an eclipse blotting out the sun. They had never been as bad as his mother’s: just pain, hyperacusis, photophobia, and occasionally nausea. But just like his mother, his sometimes lasted for days, and he was ever eager to avoid them when possible.
“Stark, come look at this,” Loki calls, and Tony goes, if only to prevent his mind from doubling back into another death spiral. He thinks of ants, and Pi, and significance. Then he shakes his head at himself.
At the last second, Tony shifts, going for the cheek. It’s the only thing he can do, because Steve didn’t specify a location, and he’ll be damned if he gets his lights punched out by Captain America in the middle of a garage surrounded by SI employees while they work on a goddamn Saint Patrick’s Day parade float. Steve turns with him, as though magnetised, and in the end he catches the corner of his mouth. It’s terrible, Tantalus’ fingers grazing the cool rim of the glass before it’s yanked out of reach, and Tony feels the breath punch out of him in a rush at the shock of it. Just that barest hint of chapped lips, and Tony can hear blood roaring in his ears.
“She wouldn’t run into a burning building to save someone,” Steve says, considering the question carefully. “She’d call the fire department.”
“Yeah, no. I’m out. Too much. I’m gonna break out in hives.”
“I didn’t!” he snarls, draining his glass in one go. The burn of alcohol down his throat isn’t half as satisfying as he wishes. “I was too caught up in my own shit with Cap and Loki and saving our own asses from the fallout of the lives we
“I’m a stealth operative, you can’t-” Widow tries, but Tony cuts her off.
“Tony, everything ok?”
“Too right,” Clint says, tossing a core and reaching for another apple. “When you get one layer down, pour a little bit of that mix over it. Use the teaspoon.”
Tony snorts. “So following that logic, we have a few days of shitty complicated feelings and sex and then I die tragically. Is that better?” Steve sits up, horror seeping into his mind as he remembers: Tony, bleeding out, Tony falling, Tony’s corpse lying dehydrated and lifeless in the sand. Tony ploughs on, oblivious. “Come on, you even saying that is proof that you’re not thinking straight.”
“Don’t think we’re not talking about this later,” she warns him, and Tony nods again. “I take it that Cap’s not coming back?”
’s favourite talking point.”
“I have been granted access to a file on Agent Romanov’s personal server, which at first glance includes classified documents from the KGB alluding to The Winter Soldier’s involvement in the Red Room program, dating back as far as 1954. I will need about half an hour to analyse and corroborate the data.”
"What is that crazy motherfucker up to?" Clint says, sounding winded. Tony catches sight of him riding a rappelling line down to a shorter roof with a water tower, tumbling to a stop and raising a bow to take out something going down a side street. There's an explosion, and then a plume of smoke.
“Do you think Sir unjust?”
“Because someone has to look out for you,” Stephen says, “and we both know that, when it comes to Steve, you won’t do it yourself.”
“And what of it?” Strange demands, spreading his hands. “If he is a ghost, then he is still dead. What could you possibly seek to accomplish? Do you wish to reanimate him? I’ll have no part in it-”
Soooo, I meant to write more for this chapter but I ended up writing a lot of smut? It’s way over the rating I’ve put for this story and includes some CNC, so I decided to shift it over to its own one-shot in the collection. If you’re into that sort of thing, consider this only half of the chapter and move over to the next part of the collection (I will add a hyperlink) where you can enjoy 5k words of filth. :D Comments, as always, greatly appreciated. I try to reply to everything but sometimes I miss one or two, so I’m sorry if that’s the case! Do know that I appreciate and read them all.
“Did something happen that you’re unhappy about?” she asks carefully, and Tony immediately shakes his head.
“He says to tell you he’s fine, but-” There was a crackle of static, then silence, and Steve sighed and ran a hand over his face. The speakers flared to life, whined loud enough that Steve clapped a hand over his ear, then settled again. “Are you sure you guys are adults? Jeez. He’s definitely got some busted up ribs. I think the rest is superficial, but I don’t know. He won’t tell me.”
“Yeah,” Tony says nonsensically, pulling out and adding a second one. He slips them back into Steve’s body, aiming for Steve’s sweet spot, and grins when Steve gasps and tries to bury his face in his arm. “No, I want to see your face.”
Tony smiles, all teeth. He leans down and presses a kiss to Steve’s temple. “Gimme a colour, baby.”
“No way you were a scout,” Minoru scoffs. She jabs an elbow into Stein’s ribs. “Let’s go.”
“Captain Rogers is leaving the cellblock.”
“So the issue is with Tony’s scent,” she hummed, and Steve turned to glare at her with a sharp, warning growl in his throat. She held up her hands, stepping back, and Steve settled.
, Steve thought to himself philosophically, that answered that question.
“Yeah?” Tony’s smiling at him, a little forced, a lot bemused. He’s trying so hard. It makes Steve’s throat seize.
“I am what you made me, Sir.”
Loki smiles, sharp and delighted. "Oh, he is his father's son, I see." His image shimmers for a moment, and then he bows. "I have been called Silvertongue, and Lie-Smith, and Trick-Skin, and even mistaken for Satan. But I suppose Laufeyson would be most correct, as it seems that would be the most important factor in your considerations, Master Jarvis."
Steve swallows and glances at him expression sheepish. “Well, uh, I have been. For the field, that is.”
Steve nodded, because he knew that word from his research. He’d identified with it then, too.
“Ohmigod,” Tony says, recoiling as though she’s slapped him. “Who are you and what have you done with the real Natasha? Is this a Loki trick? This better not be a Loki trick.”
good wine, Steve had to admit. “So if…if something were to happen to him, would you…?”
“Because he sought to kill you,” Loki says, because that much should be obvious. Steve certainly could have said that from the start, but it’s not the answer Tony’s looking for. He shakes his head slightly at Loki. “He saw my face. He was outside of my calculations. He had the potential to ruin everything I have sought to build for four years. What answer would best please you, Stark?” He flicks a lazy hand towards the portal. “Might I close this, or should we bring his equipment over for you to study?”
Tony turns, then, and Steve stumbles back, because he’d been so close. Tony’s face is right there, and Steve is having the kind of thoughts he thought he’d buried a long time ago. His mind is always a little dangerous around Tony. Steve has always prided himself on his self-control, but it’s hard, seeing Tony at his most vulnerable like this. He’s practically been living in Tony’s pocket, and it’s giving his traitorous brain the worst kind of thoughts. Thoughts that he knows are out of bounds, when he’s already violating Tony’s privacy so deeply like this. Thoughts he knows he doesn’t deserve to have, when he’d stood over Tony’s body and held the shield above Tony’s bloody face, and Tony had said-
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony panted, and then he was biting down hard enough to break skin and Steve-
“If you think I’m playing you for money, you’re a real spooney,” Rogers snorted, and Tony laughed. For the space of a breath, he let himself rest his forehead against the cool surface of the sheriff’s jacket, breathing in the musky scent of the man. Rogers was always so warm. His voice was soft when he spoke, fingers squeezing gently at Tony’s hip. “Come on, old boy. Let’s get you into the house.”
He didn’t mean to do it, but whatever Ben Ulrich has to say in response to that question is met with a roaring in his ears. To his left, Thor is looking at him with some concern, expression pulled tight as he stoops down to gather the ceramic shards up with his fingers.
“I don’t need a handicap to fight Captain Tightpants,” Luke retorts.
Steve is saying something, muffled into his collarbones, and Tony tilts his head to hear him better.
Steve’s looking down at his hands. “We’ll take a break. I can talk to a shrink about the anxiety attacks I’ve been mostly avoiding thinking about. Get a bottle of Xanax or something. You should probably talk to a shrink about the PTSD you pretend you don’t have, but your body, whatever. Like I said, this isn’t your fault, okay? You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re…you’re amazing, Steve. You’re treacle sweet. You’re unbelievably gorgeous. But I think we can both agree that what we’ve been doing so far isn’t working. Can’t we?”
“Shit,” he says. He turns around and clamps a hand over his eyes. “I mean-I’m sorry-”
“Haven’t you read the papers?” he hears Tony ask. “I’m the Invincible Iron-Man. A little building like this couldn’t drop me.”
The elevator opened up onto Clint’s and Natasha’s floor, and Steve took a deep, calming breath as soon as his Clint’s scent washed over him. Being in an enclosed elevator with Natasha had been stressful. He was able to fight his biology, even more so than the average omega with the help of the serum, but he knew that his endocrine system was wrecked right now. The only reason he wasn’t catatonic or caught in a fugue was the effects of the serum working to regulate his biological processes.
“Stark does not even think very highly of himself, in most ways,” the professor counters, chuckling. He turns his wheelchair, leading Steve back down the hall. It’s a Friday afternoon, and children are milling about with that unmistakable childlike delight at the weekend, climbing over the furniture and playing chase. They all duck around the professor with the ease of long practise. “Anyone who doesn’t meet his standards is easily dismissed, and so as you and I know, there are only a handful of people in the world who can actually meet his requirements for praise.”
Loki: Hey I made a huge dramatic declaration of loyalty so maybe could you talk to your workwife about the government trying to ruin your livelihoods? Or like, any of your friends and adoptive family? Which you still have, unlike some of us? Is that chill? It’s literally the only thing I’ve asked of you this whole time?
for the
“So, Pepper knows what he said,” Bruce says, and Tony pauses, gesturing at him with what’s left of his slice.
, he tells himself sternly.
“I looked up ‘Hokusai tentacles’ while I was in the kitchen,” Steve confesses, and Tony pauses in his ministrations. “What I found was pretty illuminating. This is another one of those sex things I didn’t know about before we started dating, right?”
, J. I don’t…I’ll have to rerun everything. God, is Pepper seeing this?”
"Like I'm gonna make you take a cab," Tony scoffs, walking with her towards the car.
There’s a pause, the AI equivalent of JARVIS clearing his throat. “I’m not sure I understand your question, sir.”
“I wouldn’t say that, no. But it’s nothing to be alarmed about.”
“You’re not doing anything wrong.”
JARVIS’ silence is smug.
“That he tried to give himself some version of Extremis,” she says, and Steve sucks in a breath. The facts fall down like dominoes, neat black and white dots and lines. Data points: Tony and Reed pouring near-silently over monitors together, trading things back and forth and speaking even more opaquely than usual for them. Tony’s almost desperate behaviour last night. The reason only Tony can see or hear or touch him. “It’s over, Ghost.”
Loki replies, approving.
Unbidden, he remembers his meeting with Xavier: the vision of the earthquake, of Tony’s battered body crawling up out of the earth like a Grecian myth.
“Sir, it is often difficult to discern when Agent Romanov is asleep or awake based on comportment. The best way to know was to ask.”
“Relax, Capsicle,” he says, and Steve frowns instinctively at the name. “You don’t have to pretend you didn’t know him.”
“Sorry,” Tony murmurs, but Steve hushes him.
And it’s stupid, because Steve has spent years and years fighting himself. He’d been desperate to keep the balance between them, to keep Tony not too close and yet not too far, near and dear while still professional.
“Or don’t,” Tony says, and Steve swallows. It’s showy. It’s mouth-watering. “I like this view.”
“Then what do you want?” Bruce prompts him. “This is what I keep asking you, Tony. What do you want? If you could have anything, what would you want?”
to,” he repeats. What in Tesla was going
“Of course.”
Steve furrowed his brow, fingers moving restlessly over Tony’s skin. They hadn’t even had BiteBlockers when he was- well, before. The thought hadn’t even occurred to him. The idea of unmated heat sex was still incredibly risqué when he’d gone into the ice, although not entirely unheard of. Now, it was a common object for omegas to have at home, the leading brand serving as the name of the object like Kleenex or Q-tips. Steve had sort of imagined that either they were going to bond, or he was going to spend his heat alone again. He’d forgotten there was another option.
“Actually sir, he’s on his way to you. He seems unsettled.”
“If you need help, JARVIS is almost as good as I am,” Tony says, winking at the nearest security cam. “You know your way around. I’ll be back in a few.”
Bucky snorts at him. “Oh, don’t be a girl. You’ll heal in a minute. Asshole.” He leans back onto Steve’s cot, kicking his booted feet up onto the end rail. A wry smile warps the corners of his mouth. “If you’ve got it, grab it. Don’t be stupid.”
“I want us to stop hurting each other,” Tony says, and he means every word.
“Nothing,” Steve says quickly, taking another sip of whiskey. God, this is the good stuff. “Anyway, that…I’m, uh, staying in my lane?”
, Steve didn’t say. He couldn’t say that he hadn’t been disappointed when he got to that part of the Wikipedia article on “Transnature Hormone Therapy” and found out that biological children weren’t in the cards, but that was alright. They could always adopt. Instead, he let Tony say his piece.
He disconnects Cap from the frankly alarming amount of tranquilisers they’ve doped him with, definitely magic augmented so they wouldn’t need to keep raising the dose as his immunity to the drug built. Then he has JARVIS poke at the supercomputer, careful of any booby traps Strucker might have left that could damage JARVIS’ integrity. They make the decision to upload the data to a quarantined server for later, destroy the DNA sequencer and all of the machines with Cap’s blood and tissue laid out in meticulous samples, letting the sparking metal erupt into flames. When Cap begins to come round, Tony pulls him off the heart monitor and all the secondary life support fail-safes. He thanks the science gods that Cap didn’t have his shield when he was abducted; the resulting pout at losing his baby would have been unbearable. He’s struggling against the restraints, muscles bulging, and Tony walks out from behind one of the machines with his hands raised, a camera-ready smile on his face.
“She had her moments,” Tony says. He glances up at Steve, a small smile quirking his mouth. “She was a lot younger than him, y’know? He needed an heir to the Stark empire. She wanted social mobility. It was an old fashioned kind of marriage.”
“You’ll need his help to convince Danvers.”
The snare of the curse is this: Tony wants to give himself to Steve wholeheartedly. He wants to lie bare and let Steve take him over, wants to be taken, wants to be
His first orgasm took him like a freight train, fast and loud and shaking with the force of it. He’d just been so wound up, and Tony was everything he needed, everything he’d been wanting for days. He buried his scream in the mattress because he couldn’t bite Tony in this position and he needed to bite down on something. Tony milked him aggressively through it, fingers thrusting brutally while his mouth made the most obscene noises licking up all the slick that spilled from between Steve’s thighs. When it became too much and Steve began to squirm away from overstimulation, Tony pulled them out, hooked his thumbs in, and spread him wide enough to press his tongue straight in. The shock of it made Steve scream, and then Tony was sucking and fucking into him and he was coming again, so fast on the heels of the last one that his muscles just gave out on him. He collapsed to the bed in a shivering wreck, but Tony just flipped him over like a hotcake and licked greedily at his cock, cleaning him up while Steve cried out and squirmed, overwhelmed. It was too much, but Tony wasn’t stopping, just lapping him up and growling low under his breath, like he was half out of his mind from wanting.
Steve, who had been mostly unabashedly watching Tony bite his lip as he scrolled through the movie selection, watches as Tony glances up from his usual perch on the couch. One of Steve’s arms is resting on the back behind him, fingers almost close enough to touch. He hasn’t quite worked up the courage to put his arm around Tony’s shoulders, mostly because he and Tony still haven’t had a chance to talk yet. It isn’t that he thinks he’ll be rebuffed, but more that he doesn’t know what it would mean if he did it and Tony just let him. Bruce is curled up on Tony’s other side, fingers combing absently through Natasha’s hair as he reads something on a tablet.
