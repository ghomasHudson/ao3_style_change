Loud laughter echoed from around the tree suddenly, and that booming voice was impossible to forget:
Deadpool loosened their hug, staring down at Peter. Why did that perfume have a familiar scent to it?
There was a piercing scream from the television. The baby had nearly caught the love interest's arm, but some other little monster had struck across the street, and now the crowd was in a panic.
“Deadpool? Sorry, we haven’t seen any costumed people here. That was the point, actually,” Steve replied, shaking his head.
“I do and I also know Peter’s, just for the record.” Daredevil watched Cap as he disappeared into the cabin, turning to Tony again and smiling. “So, the tabloids were right. ‘The playboy and the American dreamboat.’” The vigilante chuckled and shook his head.
“I’d love some,” Matt said, sounding a bit distracted when he turned his head in Tony’s direction. After a moment, he faced the fire instead.
“You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope...I have loved none but you,” Wade read under his breath, staring at the book curiously. “Oh my gawd. Love spells!”
“That was a disaster—just like the rest of this weekend,” Cap said, his hand slipping from Tony’s as he paced around the edge of the fire. “I wouldn’t blame Bruce if he never wanted to talk to us again!”
He sipped the latte again. It really was perfect. His favorite coffee shop back in the city was probably deeply offended, because this was a better latte than he’d ever had from there. Then again, Peter wasn’t exactly rich, and it was probably his own fault for going to the cheapest coffee shop he could find. Sometimes ‘coffee shop’ really meant ‘gas station that just had a little drip coffee thingy in the back’…
Clint was having a hard time now believing that Doom had never actually seen Wall-E, with a response like that. He still had no idea what the man wanted, though, which unfortunately meant that they had to keep talking to each other.
"Ha." The green eyed man turned away again, crossing his arms. "Only if you plan to kill him—I wanted to reserve that pleasure for myself."
"How exactly are you planning on catching Thor? I know you got Cap, but Thor's a little harder to hold on to. I don't know if you know this, but he's sort of a demigod."
Rolling his eyes at the childish saying, Clint slogged after them. The sooner they made it back, the sooner Clint could go back to not hearing about everyone’s dating life!
“Exactly. He told me that his friend Thor wouldn’t mind me joining the game, so I did. It’s as simple as that. And, since Thor is not here, I’ll leave you three to your family time.”
Deadpool was eating, perched on the top of Peter's house, legs slung over the edge casually. He had climbed up there while Spider-Man retrieved the bike—probably to stay out of range of Wolverine, who sat sulking below just around the corner of the house. "Hey, Spidey babe, you're on TV again. Aww man, Hulk was in town?"
“Sure is,” Peter said nervously, grabbing Matt by the arm. If Thor DIDN’T know, did they really want to be the ones to break it to him? Especially if Loki would be angry with them as a result? “Hey, uh, thanks for slowing the storm down and all. We should probably get back to the plan…”
Accepting the plate, Peter immediately started piling whipped cream and berries on top of a waffle. He sandwiched the other on top like Cap had done with his.
"Friendship. Sure, because that's all it is," he grumbled, unable to keep from sounding bitter. "We're in the only place Daredevil can't eavesdrop, and now you don't have anything to say? Really? I think we can handle sticking crayons in the sand and talking at the same time."
Okay, that felt like an opportunity to say something about how hot Tony was. All Clint had to do was say it. Just start the conversation rolling that way.
After a few more passes of the frisbee, Steve started peeling the label on his soda, clearing his throat.
"You will stay here until you prove useful," Doom grumbled, "Or until I tire of you." With that he stalked off into the shadows, his cloak swishing out behind him.
“Weird, I didn’t think you or Hulk could sunburn.” Clint started gathering up the cards and stacking them into a deck again. “I suppose it’s just more proof that you guys are totally different people.”
"Well he certainly hasn't been in his BED in the last 48 hours..." Jarvis was right back to droll again.
“Well, I’ve got some maps of the area from one of our fairs. If you don’t mind ignoring the little tents.”
"No. The fishing bores me to death," Clint corrected. "This...hanging with you...it's kind of cool. I don’t get to talk to you a lot." He fidgeted, glancing toward the ground.
A flash of red caught his eye, soaring high above. It looked like Thor carrying two normal people—one of which looked mostly naked from where Spider-Man was.
“Sure, okay. I’m sure the Avengers can handle a lake monster if they really have to, but some heads up would be nice…” Shoving his phone and the bag of trail mix away, Peter unzipped his hoodie and clicked his belt buckle. A big round red Spider-Man face lit up the cave in front of them, beaming out from the belt. Did he bring the entire gadget collection with him or what?
“I was actually here just to camp with my boyfriend,” he admitted, deciding to be honest with Loki. “I didn’t realize the Avengers were right down the hill from us, though, and our campsite kind of ended up getting Hulk-smashed, so we’re tentless.” He glanced around the very expensive-looking camp with its army of beautiful cabin tents and smiled sheepishly. “Your camp’s really nice, by the way. Thanks for inviting me in even though I just sort of…dropped by.”
“Did you find it? Come on, I have a shit ton of arrows!” Hawkeye grumbled from nearby, crunching through the underbrush. “Bruce?”
"Tony, are y-you alright?" Within seconds, he was at Tony's side, looking him up and down for damage. "We were starting to worry."
A third Hawkeye? Was there some Skrull factory in a warehouse somewhere, just making Hawkeyes to confuse them?
“Why don’t we try calling him again first?” Tony suggested, moving over to grab his phone from his and Steve’s tent. He did not let go of the blanket, Steve noted.
"You know Tony a lot better than me, Cap. Deep down, you probably already know. If you look at the team, the other person who really seems to be keeping secrets is Clint, though, so maybe..." He sighed. "Maybe that's what all of the over-the-top attention he's faking toward me is about."
"I said I was keeping watch, not running off," the Jotun growled, grabbing one of Bruce's hands. He was sure that using the one on his injured side would hurt like all hell. "I'll be right here. Go help Tony or something."
"I'll be fine." Bruce sighed and combed his hair away from his face with his fingers. "Why did you run from the Hulk? You know he likes you."
Tony looked like he was trying to keep a straight face as he assured both Peter and Matt, “Hulk said he showed up because Bruce had a run-in with a bear, so…not your fault.”
"He's my something," he replied awkwardly. "But I can't call him my boyfriend or sweetheart or anything when I've never asked him to be. That's just weird."
"Not good—somebody knew to turn 'em off," Tony said, just before his mask covered his face. "Jarvis, assemble anybody else who's available—we're gonna go on ahead."
"Clint. Don't do anything stupid, please? It's the weekend. Just cooperate if you’re really you." Carol sighed, crossing her arms again.
Maybe Doom had already gotten him? Would it seem weird for Cap to call him again? It was worth the risk. "Can I h-have your card, Clint?" He held a hand up to the SHIELD agent.
Wow, had he just went right along with Matt calling Cap and Tony his parents, just like that? He had.
“That’s neither here nor there,” Matt told them, pushing off of the car to meet Cap and Wade. “Wade, I need to talk to you. Now.” Taking Wade’s arm, he led him off to the front of the car.
Wade was making his way through camp, using Matt’s cane to poke his way through the crowd. Everyone seemed confused by him, but they jumped to move and let him through.
Bruce trailed after him, hurrying to keep up. The guy didn't even have his shoes anymore, and Clint knew the Hulk was the reason why. Did Bruce really think there was any other explanation, though? What exactly did he think they'd been up to for him to wind up naked with them both cuddled up together in the sand?
Frowning all over again, Cap watched as the cup slid from the table and landed in the dirt with a loud thunk.
“It got Hotguy!” Deadpool yelled shrilly, kicking his feet and dragging Peter along toward the mucky shoreline.
Almost reflexively, the wounded man put his hand on Bruce's. He looked over at him, feeling a bit dazed.
"You're right about Hulk, he's not a monster," he said, looking into Clint's eyes thoughtfully. "But he does tend to come out swinging when I change into him. It's just instinct by now--you have no idea how many times he's awakened to people shooting at him." He looked down at their hands, running his thumb over the back of Clint's gently. "I'm not actually that interesting, but if you want to get to know me better...well, I'm here all week."
“Uh,” Clint started, taking the offered pills. He didn’t have any water so he just tried to think of lemons. Yuck. As soon as he managed to get the pills down, he gave Bruce a nervous smile. “You okay there?”
“To his credit, Cap tried to. Lucky for me, he got distracted. Bet you scared the shit outta that bear,” he added, snickering as he managed to sit up.
Peter frowned and went back to the window. Opening it, he poked his head out and looked up toward the roof. The roof edge blocked his view and huge drops of rain landed into his eyes. Also blocking his view.
There was a sudden flicker, and the lights in the room all went out. The red glow of the taxi's big mileage counter mounted on the dash was the only light as the greenish glow extended out into the room...and a tall hooded figure approached the car.
Peter sighed and flopped onto the roof on his back, looking up at the pre-dawn sky. There were tiny clouds up there, and twinkling stars very far away. Skyscrapers were high enough to actually see stars, even in the city.
Hawkeye had believed he and Tony were an item. Perhaps Clint was just being defensive and had said it to make Tony uncomfortable.
"Uh right," Clint said slowly...and a bit sadly. He definitely picked up on Bruce's hesitation. He turned around and pointed to the door. "I think this is the basement." He tried the handle. It was unlocked so he opened it. It led to another hallway.
“Peter told me he’d be camping up here for the weekend with a friend.” Shifting his walking stick to the other hand, the man tipped his head curiously. “Tony and Steve…and Thor. I don’t suppose you’re Avengers?”
When he dropped his hand away, it was easy to see the tears in his eyes, even through all of the rain. Steve padded across the beach to him, offering his hands to Tony.
T’Challa had been in plain sight all day and had slept in the other cabin. He had no involvement with the box and would probably open it, investigate it, and put it back if he found it.
"That's not very comforting, you know," Peter sighed, taking a bite out of the naked hot dog again and chewing. It wasn't so bad when he looked out to the city instead of watching Wade watch him eat.
"Yeah, sorry, that would be for a DNA sample," Tony said drolly. "I'm looking at how a virus reacts with another virus in your bloodstream, and that kind of requires blood." He placed the tip of the needle onto Clint's arm...then paused, looking at it.
“Yeah, uh huh. So, anti-fraternization includes you two, RIGHT?” Hawkeye snapped, flicking a hand in Steve’s direction.
"You shouldn't really be moving around at all." Bruce sighed and began to unbutton his shirt. "I'm not even sure where Cap and the other Hawkeye went. We shouldn't split up like this."
“Yeah, I agree — let’s turn around,” Tony heard Hawkeye complaining from the back seat. “I forgot my exploding arrows!”
"Tony?" The redhead hugged herself and shivered, looking around quickly. The Iron Man suit was the most obvious red object that might be rushing around. Maybe it was Thor, though—the demigod wore a red cape.
“Happens all the time,” Matt told her, flashing her one of his charming smiles. Lola smiled back, her hand lingering on the redhead’s arm. Matt turned his attention to Thor. “Is there anything you can do to make the storm less crazy at least? I’m starting to wonder if we shouldn’t give up and go save them.”
Now Wade’s jealousy over Matt getting attention made even more sense. Whatever Matt said about it, it sure didn’t seem like Wade was okay with sharing if they weren’t with each other…
“Um, you’re very drunk,” Cap said quickly, patting Clint’s chest to push him back and give them some space. He reeked of alcohol. “I, uh,” Steve said, looking down at Peter. With a sigh, he got up and offered an arm to Clint. “Let me walk you to your hammock.”
When he opened his eyes, he saw Bruce get to his feet, carefully staying behind the couch to peer over the top at him.
"Hey, you alive in there?" Came a familiar voice from just outside the door. Clint came in, a tall cup of coffee in one hand and a large box of pink glazed donuts in the other. The donuts were encrusted with rainbow sprinkles, too, and their clinging sweetness could be smelled from the desk. "Hungry?"
"Spider-Man's not down here," the merc growled off to one side to no one in particular. "She made this motion." He did a 'follow me' gesture with his arms. "That." He said, waggling a finger. "Is because you're stupid." Having finished the one sided conversation he was having, he came over to look down at Iron Man. "Hey pops—can I call you that?"
"Or you could bash me in the head with something very heavy," Loki suggested. Thor could oblige, he was sure. Especially if he was hitting.
He heard Hawkeye cough and saw him drawing his bow. Before he could fire, he slid down to his knees. Whatever was in the gas affected him too.
Peter’s shoes slipped on the slick stone as he arrived at the top of a tunnel that sloped down. A steady stream of water ran out of a crack in the wall above it, shooting mist up into the beam of his light.
It didn't exactly send a "no we're not dating" message, but Peter patted the guy's back anyway. Wade was in the crosshairs because Peter had overprotective hero...mentor...parental unit...friends? Well, friends was definitely the wrong word.
Bruce stepped up next to the blond guy, who kind of towered over him, and shaded his eyes with one hand as he looked up at Clint.
"Top secret," he said at last, guiltily. "Not that I don't trust you, Cap. I-I'm just a little, um. Nervous. Yeah, nervous." He gasped as his marshmallow burst into flames, pulling it over to blow on it hastily.
"About that." Turning to look up at the lights, Steve cringed. "Tony r-rigged his heart to p-power the mansion."
“Both,” Cap said, turning to kiss Tony’s cheek before climbing to his feet. “I have to understand why he’s dating Deadpool. I just can’t wrap my head around it. But don’t worry—” He glanced back, flashing a smile. “—I’ll make coffee first.”
"Hey big guy." Johnny grinned. "We were just in the neighborhood and decided to drop in." He leaned to look around Thor. "Is the Hulk in there?"
"Whoa, okay then!" He smirked. "Wow...you sure you're not under s-some..." He paused to cough and wince, clutching his chest. "...G-god of mischief type magic spell or something?"
Steve knew his reasoning was completely selfish. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could NOT show how much he loved Tony.
"Banner is safely in his room, and Hawkeye is here as well," he said confidently. The sky grumbled overhead, and he added, "Please, join us! We were about to learn to make a Midgard dish using the Google."
“You know my last name? Wow.” That was sort of flattering. Matt could hear every word, he reminded himself. Wait, would Matt think Loki was hitting on him? Did Loki think that after the whole Jane Austen quote thing from last night? …Great, now, Peter was starting to blush.
"Be strong, my friend!" T-shirt Clint didn't have a chance to reply before Thor was crushing him in a big hug. "Stark, I wish to be imprisoned along with them. It is not right to be on the other side of the cell!"
“Oof! Thanks?” Tony had just been wrapped in a blanket by Thor as well, and the Asgardian was already moving to drape one over Matt’s shoulders, too.
He was tired. His stitches kept bleeding and his cracked rib was hurting and he had only had one cup of coffee and he had barely slept—and Wade would not shut up!
Even Bruce wasn’t as big of a worry as Peter, though. What in the world would they do if he didn’t accept their engagement? It would break Steve’s heart, Tony thought, turning to watch the handsome blond gliding through the water nearby. He didn’t want to admit it, but it would break his, too.
"Oh, you came back down from orbit," Tony commented, pulling a sharp turn and circling the Baxter building to take a closer look at the scene of the bombing from the day before. "That's nice, I was feeling lonely."
Loki couldn't think of any better excuse. He needed to be alone for a few seconds so he could muster the power to teleport. Then he could be gone without anyone knowing that he was ever there. Even the annoying computer was offline. The last thing he wanted was to be dragged around like a toy.
"Let's elope!" Wade shouted, standing up out of his seat to hug Peter around the shoulders. "To the land of hotdogs and women younger than your grandma there." He added, jerking a thumb at the house.
With a snort, the large man vanished back into the crowd. Deadpool had managed to give Wolverine the slip twice today; maybe something was wrong with Logan's nose.
Before Tony could muster a reply, the other tent’s door started to unzip and Cap took a long step back. Clint climbed out of the tent, yawning widely.
“Peter was really upset, Tony,” Steve said, frowning at him. “I guess the three of them have never really spent time together when they aren’t fighting crime. Peter just wanted a few more days with them and Matt wasn’t having it. So, I told him I’d take responsibility for Wade if they could stay for a few more days. Then,” Cap sighed, losing the frown. “Peter asked us all to do a boat race. I guess that’s why he wanted his friends to stay so badly. If you ask me, I think the three of them need some time alone to work all of this out.”
Bruce stood there gripping the pizza box tightly, listening to his heart thud speedily in his chest. It was just somebody at the door, he told himself, glancing that way very carefully.
"Hey, good morning!" The light, cheerful voice somehow still made Clint jump. Turning, he saw Peter walking up the beach from behind him, holding an assortment of small bits of driftwood, seaweed, and shells. The kid was in yet another borrowed outfit--a plain white T-shirt that had to be Bruce's and a pair of bright red shorts. Judging by the various kinds of beetles printed on them, the shorts were Hank's. There was something ironic about Spider-Man wearing beetles, Clint's uncaffeinated brain thought. "Uh, you in there?" Peter prodded, waving a hand in front of his face.
"Not that I know of...any chance your hands are free?" Steve wheezed, sitting up a bit in his shackles.
He rarely ever got to SEE Bruce either. When he was himself, he was spending his day fishing or pouring through boring technical papers. Clint usually dozed off before they got to talking.
"What? No! I've been fighting my way out of that warehouse!" Clint yelled, pointing off in behind him, probably at wherever he had come from.
“I used to hate the guy,” he continued, focusing on the coffee with a small frown. “We’d fight all the time and everything. Now that I’ve gotten to know him, though, I realize he’s different than people treat him. You probably get a lot of that, yourself, I’ll bet. People just assume you’re a crazy evil guy and forget there’s a person in there, and that most people need love.”
"I'm not gonna use the repulsors when I'm not flying," Tony replied, smirking a little despite himself. "Although if you're burnt toast, you can't die of poisoning, right? Bet it'd cure you." He nodded at the door to the medical room and stepped through as Jarvis opened it for him. "I like you better as a blond, though, so we'll figure something out, here."
“Captain, Stark!” Thor called, waving to them from the campfire ring. As they got closer, Steve realized that the campfire was lit and a messy-haired brunette was sitting beside it, bundled in a big blanket.
Bruce seemed to think so; he took a step away when Clint took a step toward him. Go figure, they had to get stuck in one of the rooms the Hulk hadn't already torn a hole through the other day...
"Press the button, wave it over the ground, listen for beeps?" Bruce suggested, looking down at the metal detector with a sigh. He gave Clint's hand a small squeeze and let go of it. "Clint, I hope you know I'm not trying to guilt you into spending time with me. It's okay, I've spent years alone." He held up his hands and shrugged. Who went on a group vacation and spent it away from the group, though?
“If you mean from ‘across the water’, then yes, I’m pretty sure that’s who he meant,” Bruce said, poking the first aid kit with one finger like it might jump at him. He glanced at Clint and then back at it, and for no apparent reason, his eyes were glinting green again. “Sorry I can’t turn back into Hulk so you have something more comfortable to sleep on. Steve and Tony made it sound really important for me to stay me all weekend.” He shrugged as if to add ‘I have no idea why.’
Clint noticed Thor stepping back over to Loki with a glass of water and a blanket. First he spread the blanket over his brother and tucked him in with care, then he offered the glass.
"Then we're d-down to the device that helps him take over the w-world." Steve coughed hard, laying his head back against the wall.
So, Bruce hadn’t been worried about him at all, the archer concluded silently, leaning back on the rock and looking down at the water, too. Worrying about him was a waste of time, anyway. Being bruised and achy was daily life.
The sun was sinking below the horizon by the time the second round of Avengers came home to their mansion. Loki stood patiently waiting by his fake ice cream cart, eying Hawkeye as he slid off of the Hulk’s back.
2: In this chapter, Captain America uses the term "queer". Please note that we are aware this word can be seen a slur for some people, and as an empowered retaken word for others. Cap is from the 1940s, and not in the know about modern terminology to refer to LGBTQA+ people (in EMH he wakes up from the ice and joins the team straight away, so he hasn't been awake for very long at all) so he's still using this term. In the 1940s, some people did self-identify as queer, so it's not necessarily just a name to call others. If you're curious,
Peter whirled around to see the way Clint was looking. The sparkling waters of most of the lake were visible from this high up, and it was a gorgeous sight. He just saw that, though—a gorgeous sight, nothing more.
“It’s alright Peter,” Steve assured him, pulling on a careful smile and extending a hand to Wade. “I’m Steve and this is Tony. What’s your name, son?”
“Huh? Tied up with a note is what I do with bad guys, Wade!” Peter gestured to Hawkeye. “He’s an Avenger, he’s one of the good guys—AND he’s hurt.” He paused, glancing at Clint nervously and shaking the pill bottle a little. “I don’t know, maybe we should turn back. A treasure hunt can’t be much fun when you’re bleeding everywhere.”
“Enjoy your piña coladas with your mortal friends,” he told the Jotun fondly, and took off flying into the now-blue sky.
“Mandatory relaxation.” The blond sighed, staring off into the sky. There were lots of puffy white clouds far off on the horizon, drifting along slowly like they didn’t have a care in the world. There was even a big gray one in there, but none of the other clouds minded.
“Why exactly would they be mad at you?” Peter went to cut the gauze, reconsidered after glancing at the old bloodied bandage, and started to wrap a few extra layers on. “I’m not your responsibility. Unless…” He frowned. “Did Cap send you along to keep an eye on me?”
Deadpool plunked down on the edge of the roof, slinging his feet over. He did a shush motion, leaning even further over the edge to look at Spider-Man.
“Great, the sun’s back,” came a long-suffering comment from down the beach. A glance that way told Peter that Dr. Pym and Janet were just walking up, both soaked to the skin and hand in hand. They must have been outside during all of this weather, Peter realized. Hank was definitely the one who wasn’t enjoying this situation—Jan looked like she thought it was hilarious.
"Most interesting," Doom said, unfazed by the transformation. He crossed his arms. "I had my suspicions when you did not possess an Avengers card like the Captain. What brings a 'god' like you to Doom?"
“Good morning!” The teen announced his presence just seconds later as he hurried around the bushes Deadpool had just burst through. Peter was wearing a white tank top and a pair of red and blue trunks that looked an awful lot like his Spider-Man suit’s colors. He had a blue backpack slung over one shoulder. “C’mon, Wade, they’re still having breakfast.”
"The lovely scent of MJ!" Deadpool said dramatically, still not moving, but fanning his hands from himself to Spidey.
"'Buddies'..." Bruce smiled and shook his head slightly. "Listen, if you want to spend time with him, feel free to talk to him when I'm...not here. Just don't try and make me go away, okay?" He turned and looked at the sandwich shop for the umpteenth time, like the hours on the sign might have magically changed since last time.
Peter was about to open his mouth and just explain the actual situation when a drop of blood fell from the arrow in Wade’s chest and landed on the ground.
Clint spun to look up at him, alarmed. Distracted by Spidey, he didn’t notice the Hulk starting his way.
“Stop this foolishness!” Thor was, Tony realized in bemusement, addressing both Loki AND Steve. He had just swam in front of Steve and was frowning sternly at his stepbrother. “We are not here to fight, and if you are then you are outnumbered. Can we not coexist with an entire lake between us?”
The rush of water was deafening now, and Peter spun through open air, trying to right himself enough to locate Hawkeye. He glimpsed the archer’s blond hair a split-second before cold water flooded over him. The lake! They’d just fallen into the lake!
Her black hair was back in a loose braid, which hung over her shoulder and was long enough to brush the middle of her thigh, ending in a tiny curl.
Clicking off his light, Peter was relieved to see that there was a faint glow of sunlight somewhere down the tunnel still.
"Iron Man is performing scans," Thor replied, sounding concerned. "Has Banner come to some kind of harm...?"
"Cap, America's changed, too. Being yourself is a-a really important example to lead with," she said frankly. "Besides, I-I know Tony's really into you. It's pretty obvious..."
It made a spot below just large enough for them to huddle together, but Steve resigned himself to laying beside it. The rain didn’t bother him and he was fairly sure he was lightning proof.
Tony Stark’s voice snapped Hawkeye awake from his well-earned and much needed cat nap. Something in Tony’s tone of voice told Hawkwye that it REALLY wasn’t as important as falling back asleep. He and Hulk had been out on a very boring patrol. Not even the bad guys wanted to do anything with the damned heat of the day. It had been above the mid-90s all day, sapping what little energy Hawkeye had.
"...Cap went to find YOU, Pepper," Bruce added quietly, going back to his chemical-mixing. "He knew you were outside. You didn't see him on your way, did you?"
“I am not an Asgardian, no,” Lola said at last, sighing and tossing her hair back over her shoulder. “And as Thor already knows who and what I am, I don’t think it’s any concern of yours.”
“We need to fix the whole Steve and Tony situation. It’s just getting worse. Look, we’ve been talking to them and trying to help them work out whatever the hell they’re arguing about. I noticed you’re kinda doing that too, so we thought hey—why not team up?” Clint explained, trying to be as quiet as he could.
Bruce glanced at him and fidgeted in his seat. He wished he had some papers or something just so that he could fidget with those instead—a better excuse than just wringing his hands.
Bruce settled onto one end of the couch, leaning on a cushion and watching Clint put the movie into the player.
"Hey, the rain stopped. Awesome." The waft of perfume was still strong. It still smelled vaguely familiar...
"Clint, your face is bleeding." Bruce pulled himself onto the rock quickly and turned to offer both hands down to Clint. "Here, come on."
Clint slammed into his back, growling at the impact. Holding his side, he stepped around Peter to frown at the little tunnel.
"This's nice," he told Tony uneasily, pausing near the door to glance at him. "Maybe I should sleep outside."
The blond’s attention was immediately moved to Bruce. Maybe he’d distract the scientist so Clint could get away?
"I sort of thought you were awake and would just—you know—feel it." Clint snickered. Ah ha! For once he’d managed to kiss Bruce and not wound up with the Hulk destroying stuff. He really needed to get some of those gas arrows Amora had...
"It's a clone or something. I dunno. They think I'm the clone so that's why Thor's been hovering around me all day." Hawkeye sat up, staring at Bruce over the blankets. "…You gonna just sit there?"
Leaving an illusion to tend the cart, Loki hurried over, donning a disguise that looked like a cheery college girl.
“…Okay, then,” Tony commented after they had disappeared down the trail. He adjusted the coffee pot on the flames a bit, listening to it start to chuff as the water heated enough to begin perking. “Guess that leaves you, Clint. Lake time with the team?”
"Apparently less than I thought," Tony grumbled, sipping his own soda. "Maybe we should just leave Clint and Bruce alone too, then, huh? What the hell, who cares if it's dangerous, what do we know? We're only the leaders of this team." He huffed and crossed his arms. "Oh, sorry, you probably don't want me saying 'we' like we're something we 'certainly aren't.'"
There was no way Peter wasn't up to something, Tony thought, smiling and waving at the kid as he and Cap paddled out into the water. Steve was so strong that Tony was really only paddling for show; the kayak was going at a pretty nice pace even with him paddling one-handed while he waved.
Hovering a hand over the shelf as he searched, Clint started to miss his bow. Improvising always made him think of his bow. Most of his arrows were based on something he had to improvise in a fight.
Tony arrived at the kitchen door, glancing over at Wade and Peter immediately before turning to Cap. Peter tried to peek at them out of the corner of his eye without being too obvious about it. Tony's hair had gotten really wet, so now it was kind of curly.
"Woah! Hey!" The man stepped forward, tucking away his swords. "Thor! He-ey buddy!" Though they hadn't met before, he obviously knew who the Prince of Thunder was. He looked the blond demigod up and down. "Wow. Looking...awesome." Pausing to stare for a minute, the merc suddenly shook his head and stuck his hands high in the air. "I come in peace!"
“No way! The night’sh young!” Clint told him, scoffing and hiccuping at the same time. He batted a hand at Cap, then stumbled off down the beach toward where the others were playing frisbee.
Just then there was a bright flash in the distance. Not lightning-—the shield flaring as something hit it. They couldn't see anything doing so from the outside, though...
What could they have to talk about that they needed to go off alone for, and why did it have to be in such a romantic setting? He cursed his vacation spot choice, and suddenly wished he'd chosen somewhere with snow. "Of course, I could be wrong and you see a side of our dear Dr. Banner that he doesn't show to the rest of us."
"Tell Bruce that this is for him." He leaned up and kissed the Hulk's cheek. Hey, it wasn't like he didn't already know...right? "Now come on, let's go make sure Thor's not being stupid. Again."
Peter hadn’t expected to go hiking today, but he’d been excited when Wade suggested it. They might be able to get back to the goal of this trip: some time alone in the wilderness!
"We could...go to your room." Clint shrugged a shoulder. "You know, just to relax. Maybe eat some more pizza. Stare at paperwork."
“Take a first aid kit,” Hulk said flatly. Aw damn it, was there blood running down Clint’s arm again?
If Matt got any more pissed off, Peter was pretty sure the Spider Sense would start warning him to get clear of the flames. How could they have gone from dating to being this bitter in under a week?
"You're welcome," he added quickly before turning back to the computer console and busily punching buttons. "Okay, Jarvis, scan him over and tell me the symptoms. Pay attention to his lungs, he keeps coughing."
“We need to inform the authorities. If this thing decided to go toward the beach, someone could get hurt. Maybe… Maybe Hulk or Thor could just throw it further out to sea?”
“I…wish I hadn’t lost that recipe card,” Steve began, awkwardly wiping at his eyes before taking Tony’s hand again. He kept his eyes low, staring off over Tony’s shoulder. “I had a w-whole speech planned. I never plan speeches, but I didn’t know how to say everything so I thought if I wrote it down, maybe I could just hand it to you and not have to do this. My words are failing me.”
"Both Deadpool and Spider-Man were later spotted near where the Hulk went on his rampage, angering the beast for fun! Citizens, I ask you—where are the Avengers to stop these villains? Where are the Fantastic Four? The X-men? But I know the truth! They are working WITH them!"
“Peter?” A voice called from far off. Hurried footsteps followed and a moment later, Cap came charging around the trees. Steve hurried to help Peter up and started checking him over. “We’ve been looking for you for hours! Are you alright? What happened?”
Tony peeked over the rock and out at the demigod. Sitting back down, he scooted closer and leaned against Steve’s side, hugging around his waist with one arm.
“I-I mean, I can tell, I mean do you think he’s SERIOUS about it.” Wade was not serious about much, in his experience. The guy also had a very, very short attention span. Peter was nervous to see what that meant relationship-wise. There was only one way to find out. “Never mind, it doesn’t matter,” he added hastily, patting Matt’s shoulder. “Um…what about you?” He probably should’ve clarified whether he was asking if Matt liked him or if Matt liked Wade, but honestly he was curious about the answer to both of those questions.
“Good morning, Thor,” Cap said, heading over to greet the demigod with a smile. “Anything to report?”
“Here you go. You know, the kid’s brilliant, but I hear he’s also really bad about turning in homework, so his grades probably don’t look so great to those colleges. That helping people part is more important to him than some math test, I guess.”
“You’d think with all of this tech, I’d be able to get some good reception out here,” Tony mumbled, as if to prove his point. It was tough to be too irritated with him, knowing the level of tech he was used to and comparing it to their tent and campfire setup here.
“I don’t know which I’m more surprised about, that you know about Wade or that you’re okay with ME.” The redhead smiled, toasting Tony with his coffee. “To not dodging rockets and shields.”
"Yes, I'm just checking something," Bruce replied absently, focusing on the computer screen. He did not turn around, and the clack of the keyboard actually disguised Loki's footsteps as he slipped away.
Bruce ran his fingers through his own hair awkwardly, explaining, “Not having it along turned into a good excuse to spend time with you instead.” Peter tried not to laugh at the look on Clint’s face as the scientist added mildly, “I didn’t exactly hide it, though. You just never thought to look for it in the trunk.”
"Oh, this can't be good. Well, this is the only recent explosion lately, so wherever Bruce is, he hasn't Hulked out yet." He gestured to the bombed building.
“Loki was reading Jane Austen?” Peter poked his head out of the nearest tent, pulling a familiar bright purple sweatshirt down over his head. Clint’s sweatshirt. “C’mere, Wade, I think Thor’s flannel would fit you.”
“I know because awhile back some tabloid assumed the same thing about Cap, and the Bugle was ALL OVER Cap’s reaction, which was complete disgust,” Peter said, wiping sopping bangs out of his eyes. “He made an official statement not to use him to promote hate. And then not long after that, Stark Enterprises made some gigantic donation to support LGBT kids. I didn’t really know Cap or Tony at the time, but I thought that was pretty awesome of them.”
Clint was determined to tell them to ‘get a room’ at some point and see if they gave anything away. They HAD to be dating. Nothing else made sense. From the outside, Steve was married to his job and strangely enough, Tony WASN’T dating a long line of women for once, no matter what the tabloids said about Pepper.
Seated beside him, Wade shivered, big arms hugging himself tightly. He seemed like he was really into the story, too.
“I’m having fun,” Clint sighed, finishing off his drink. Turning back to Tony, he tipped his head curiously. “So, you’re not mad that I’m dating Bruce? Like, that’s okay? Cool.”
"He's definitely not," Bruce confirmed. "I should have figured. This is Captain America we're talking about. But I used the idea that you like Tony to convince him to try talking to Tony for me and see if he can feel out whether Tony knows any of the other Avengers have feelings for him. I honestly hope Tony misinterprets that to be about Cap's feelings and breaks the ice, but that's probably asking for too much."
"Just curious. And bored," the other man sighed, giving Bruce a sideways smile. "I'm assuming by meditate, you mean...something a little private?" He gave the brunette a nudge in the elbow. "Or does that make you turn green too?"
Steve stared at the instrument, straining to imagine the great and powerful Doctor Doom playing Bach. No. That probably never happened. Maybe he could escape from here?
The vision down the hallway was like something from a nightmare: the hulking green monster, barreling toward him at high speed and the place lit like a slasher movie. Hell, there weren't even any flickering lights...the thunder rumbling overhead reminded him of Thor, though, and that didn't help things any.
"Uh, yup," he said, trying to look at the woman without, well, looking at her. That bikini left very little to the imagination. "Why?"
“New York, actually.” Loki propped a hand on his hip, shrugging. “And for your information, I made my reservation months ago. Too bad you’ve spoiled the view…” As he spoke his eyes drifted to Cap and he cracked a smile. “Though not entirely.”
"They haven't already?" Tony frowned. "Hey Jarvis, get the backups rolling, will you? They need to be working on a cure for Cap right now."
"I heard that popping sound," Bruce informed him, unconvinced. He didn't seem to be freaking out. Maybe the green eyes were from getting his heart rate up swimming? That, or he was freaked out and playing it cool. Bruce hovered his hands near Clint's face, adding, "Let me see."
"Listen, we think Doom might be behind this thing with the Fantastic Four. Well, the other three," Spidey explained.
"Or another robot," she pointed out. "I just don't get it. Why lead the Hulk peacefully back to his room? If it's really some kind of replacement Hawkeye, why not let the Hulk rampage around?"
“Get a name,” Cap whispered to Tony in passing. “Even if it’s just a normal name, maybe we can use Jarvis to narrow it down with what secret identities we DO know.”
"Jeez!" Thanks to hitting into the Human Torch, Peter went spinning on his piece of web, still in mid-swing. He quickly let go of that piece and snapped a new web string to the nearest building, splatting against it on his back and staying stuck there with his hands and feet until he got his bearings.
"That's not a good idea." Bruce frowned. "An Arc reactor at that size doesn’t replenish that fast. If it runs down, his heart will fail—and he KNOWS it, too." Steve was pretty sure not ALL of the green in his eyes was due to whatever hand stabbing he'd mentioned. In fact, his eyes were looking greener by the minute.
Counting how many push ups he did was a waste of Captain America’s time. Watching the carpet as it almost brushed his nose, the big blond man was lost in thought.
“Well that went great,” Tony commented once Clint and Bruce had both gone. Taking a seat in the chair Bruce had been sitting in, he leaned back and sighed. This was probably the first time they’d spent more than one day in a row with Bruce as Bruce, and it was underscoring just how little they’d actually gotten to know the guy. That, and the comment from Bruce about exactly that.
"Well, this is the medical room—" The purple clad man jabbed his twin back, near his injured side. "—oh hey, you need medical attention." With that, he headed out the door.
Peter took it and held it close enough to the fire for the marshmallow to start toasting. Inwardly, he was scrambling to come up with a way to not mention Wade's name while also not lying. Heck, saying ‘boyfriend’ was already lying, wasn’t it? He should've thought of this and steered the conversation away, but it was so easy to talk to Cap, and it wasn't like he was gonna come out to Aunt May or something, so really no guardian type figure had heard it 'til now.
Dropping the towel onto the bed, Cap flipped on his TV on his way to his dresser. That last fight in the sewers had left him smelling awful. It was kind of Thor to give him a chance to go home and shower off the filth.
"I-I wasn't going outside! I just wanted to go to my room!" The Jotun protested, wriggling in the Hulk's hand. "My bed is way more comfy than those stupid tables."
There was a long silence while Loki's mouth hung open in shock. He shut it and frowned suspiciously.
Rumors about he and Tony being together had been going on since the Avengers formed. Something about the way the two leaders worked together set minds aflutter. Tabloids and newspapers alike were trying to get concrete evidence either way. Peter had heard about it at work a couple of times, as some of his co-workers had camped outside the Avengers mansion with telephoto lenses last Valentine’s Day. As Steve started to sit out buns, he looked back at Peter.
Tony had gone strangely silent in the kayak as they paddled off into the water, but he offered a wave back at Peter. A wave and a knowing smile.
"NO, you stuck your hand down my shirt and asked if I was storing a tire for a Harley in there," Peter replied, annoyed and also sounding like he might be referencing a sex joke.
He was very tired. Amazingly tired. He hadn't been this tired in centuries. It felt sort of nice. Like he could fall asleep forever. Wait, that probably wasn't a good thing. Forcing his head back up, he shook it and pried his eyes open. "T-that sounds good."
“After rumors of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers secretly tying the knot over the weekend, new sources are saying that the honeymoon is over! Tony Stark was spotted outside of the Avengers mansion this afternoon, locking lips with well-known evil doer Loki.”
Tony ducked and stepped into the tent after him, and the sound of the rain went from outside pattering on leaves to nonstop muffled thumps as heavy drops landed on the tent fabric.
"Wow," Peter said drolly. "So that IS her perfume. Why are you trying to smell like my girlfriend?" Oh, man, that sentence just sounded wrong...
"Loki. Now is not the time for games. If your curiosity must be satisfied, then ask the Captain when he returns—do not torment my ally."
"Yeah!" Hawkeye gave the big green man a thumbs up. "Over and over again. And I'll shoot stuff with bombs too," he added cheerfully, stretching a hand out to pat the Hulk's stomach gently.
There was a groan from somewhere off in the underbrush, and then some rustling of leaves and branches.
"They're still gonna be in the same place everybody else is if we do that," Peter said worriedly. "I hate to say it, but I think they need to be STUCK somewhere together or they won't talk. How are we gonna do that?"
"Me?” Matt asked, quirking an eyebrow. “You know me. I’m very good at reading people. Wade’s all over the place, but he always has you on his mind. I say give him a shot. He’s not so bad. An acquired tasted, for sure.”
As soon as the door was open, Clint Barton was stepping through it, hand up to shade his eyes from the sun. He mumbled to himself and stepped around them, heading for the beach.
Taking the chance to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek, Cap led him to their tent. He knew for a fact that Tony had brought a couple of sweatshirts along.
"Yep," the agent across the room agreed. He was holding another arrow just like the first—slowly rotating it in hand and staring at it with disbelief.
"So this's kind of cozy," Tony said conversationally, watching the lights flicker overhead. The backup generators' reasons for being off were simple enough to explain. The fuel was all gone. HOW was a question that could wait for later; they needed to get Cap a cure right away.
"I managed to send out a signal in the taxi, but I have no doubt that Doom found it. I hope Tony and the others at least tracked it that far." Cap glanced up, examining his restraints. Any keyholes?
She sighted Iron Man flying down toward the front door to the mansion. Not far away, Spider-Man was just hanging upside-down on a piece of web, observing them all.
“You know as well as I do that seventeen’s legal in New York,” Tony told Matt, taking a deep breath. “Even eighteen’s still a teenager, though—and a high schooler. And if you know about the whole parental thing, why are you surprised I have a problem with that?” How much had Peter told Matt about them? Wait, did Matt know he was Spider-Man? God, was the Bugle really going around telling the world at large that he and Steve had been together for half a DECADE? Cap hadn’t even been thawed out that long…
"Of c-course," Loki groaned. He closed his eyes, sighing again. "Just get it over with so I can sleep."
"TRADE him?" Pepper looked up at him worriedly. "So HE doesn't want Thor, somebody has who he wants."
He still hadn’t said a word. Tony placed both hands in his without hesitation, trying not to hope the tears meant what he thought they might. Maybe Steve was mourning their friendship. Maybe he’d screwed it all up. Either way, it hurt to see Steve in tears over him, over his words. He felt a pang in his chest, and remembered a few past conversations from this damned stressful ‘vacation’.
"Well, she seemed 'nice'," Tony said dryly, turning to Peter as well. The teen gave them both a look of disbelief.
“My apologies. I didn’t think you wanted to do that,” he explained, looking away from Tony. “You’re right. The team would see right through us.”
“Here ya go. I thought you said you wanted to stay outside?” He added nervously. At least it hadn’t been Tony and at least Clint hadn’t LOOKED like he had been trying to sneak around.
"This is why I didn't want you to leave alone..." Bruce sighed, gently feeling around the arrow wound on Clint's side. "Never mind. I-I can fix this."
Unwrapping the very bloody gauze from around his waist, Loki curled his lip at the gruesome sight below it. What in the world did Stark make that arrow out of? He smeared off as much blood as he could. The little alcohol disinfectant wipes stung horribly and smelt awful. Dropping red soaked wipes back into the bag and placing a handful of gauze over the hole in his side, he started wrapping himself up again. It took a lot of focus for such a simple task. His head had that floaty feeling once more.
It was becoming clear that there was no way Loki could slip away unnoticed. All his plans for fun and games and not bleeding fell to pieces.
“Then why don’t you want to be seen together? Is he from a rival school? Are your teachers giving you trouble about it? I’ll talk to them.” Cap said sternly, then his eyes widened—but he kept whatever thought had caused that to himself.
Bruce shot him a smile in return, and Clint noted that his eyes were still soft and brown. No alarm at the kiss at all. PHEW.
He couldn't see Bruce in the water behind him--he must be underneath the surface. A wave washed over Clint, and the whole world seemed to sway along with it.
"Five. ALMOST five," Bruce said tiredly. "...I think this is how the laundry feels when you forget to switch it to the dryer." He combed his hair out of his face with slightly numb fingers.
"If he wakes up alone he'll just talk loudly and look for us," Peter pointed out quietly with a small smile. He started after Clint. "Where are we goin'?"
“That’s true, but… He really needs it, Mister Rogers.” Matt gestured to Deadpool, who was trying to use his fingers to measure the size of the hole in the kayak.
Well, there went that heart pounding problem again. Bruce turned to look at him and found himself freezing up a little. He was joking, right? Of course he was.
"Okay, well, we'll put it on the to-do list, kid, but right now Cap's kind of poisoned and we're working on a cure. I'm sure I can find out who did it by looking at the scene of the crime."
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he told the dark haired man, drawing him in for a kiss. “Really, I’m sorry this is going so poorly. We could just tell everyone and be done with it. I’m sure once the Hulk destroys the camp, we can convince everyone to go home,” he joked, smiling for Tony’s benefit.
"It's the only tower in town," he replied distractedly, focusing on getting them down to ground level. They could walk a few blocks—then Deadpool wouldn't have to be all cuddly all the way there.
“We were trying to keep that part quiet this weekend,” Tony admitted, “but yeah. Peter’s a good kid—photographed Cap for the Bugle a time or two. We had no idea he was camping in this same area when we got here. He’s out on a hike. C’mon, why don’t you come back to camp with us and I’ll see if he’s answering his phone again yet?”
What was wrong with him? He was going to make himself anxious at this rate, and that would be a stupid thing to do. He was too smart to do that, especially out here.
“That’s good, because I wasn’t talking to you, sour puss,” Wade shot back, gesturing to himself. “I was talking to ME.”
"I need to know what kind of arrowhead it was first," Bruce said evenly, glancing back at Hawkeye. "Did it have serrated edges? Barbs? Will pulling it out do much damage, or is it more of a sharpened point?"
“I don’t see Cap or Tony or anybody out in the lake,” he said. “Hopefully they’re back at camp…” Now they didn’t just have the monster to warn the team about, but Loki as well. Of the two, Loki was a lot more dangerous, Peter was sure.
“Well, kid, looks like you don’t have to ride in the trunk after all,” he told Peter. Peter laughed, coming over to where Hawkeye was downright scowling into the nearest car’s trunk, and waved into it.
"Oh, good," the redhead said, looking around at the cell roof again. She brought a hand to her mouth and raised her voice. "Tony's going to kick your butt!" Cue lots of coughing afterward.
The vest was shortly over their heads—much to a certain scientist's disappointment. Clint held it over them, shivering.
Standing at his side in her tiny gold string bikini, Lola seemed unbothered by the talk of magical weather-changing powers. It wouldn’t surprise Peter if she knew exactly who Thor was, since he was as well-known as any of the other Avengers.
“Wow, don’t get too excited, you’ll strain something,” Tony said sarcastically from against his side.
“Besides, the gay part isn’t the part I’m worried about!” Tony held up the newspaper. “Don’t you think Hawkeye’s dancing with death here? The guy’s not even super human. He’s a regular dude!”
“When do you think the power will come back on?” The question wasn't really aimed at anyone. He was tired...wait. Glancing down the cold pills still in his hand, he shook his head. He had completely spaced getting those or even taking them. The archer hopped down and went to find a glass of water. “I'll be right back, Bruce. You thirsty?”
"Ah, it's good to have you back." Hawkeye grinned up at him as they walked. "But I'm coming with ya!"
"That's not something to do casually," Bruce sighed, letting his arm fall to his side. For some reason, he was focusing on the fire hydrant again. Bright yellow. "I could wake up someday and find out the other guy KILLED you..."
Turning quickly, Loki spotted Tony Stark on the other side of the gate. The man was in leather sandals, red swim trunks and a white tank top. Clutched in one hand was a bright orange mixed drink with a little umbrella and his cell phone in the other. To top off his summer look, he had on a pair of huge gold rimmed mirror-lensed sunglasses.
"What?!" The red and blue clad hero exclaimed to himself, swinging a U-turn and heading back over to stick to the wall and listen to the report. As usual, Jameson's angry mustached face was taking up most of the screen.
“Look,” he said quietly, gesturing after Wade. “I’m sure you have a good reason—a really damn good reason—but you’re right that they won’t get it.”
Slinging his way in the direction everybody else couldn't wait to get away from, he spotted the Hulk's green skin right away. The enormous Avenger was currently smashing two cars together like cars were the thing he hated most, roaring all the while. There were sirens in the distance, a little metal bench in the middle of the rubble sat untouched, and—aha! A sandwich shop, right there not ten feet away from the Hulk.
“Yes, you know, 'tool' is the right word—because you used me to do your dirty work!” Daredevil grumbled. He puffed out a sigh. “Peter, Deadpool had me convinced that you were in trouble and I may have said something to your girlfriend. I’m very sorry. I should have known better than to trust this idiot!”
They appeared to be held on by some kind of energy, like an electromagnetic lock. That fit Doom's abilities with metal and electricity well enough to believe.
Distracted by these thoughts, Bruce let Clint lead him to the other door—the one Thor wasn't keeping an eye on—without any more protests.
It was that, or Steve could claim he'd rather sleep on the floor because he didn't WANT to sleep in the bed. Cap blinked up at him, fighting off a smirk.
"How long are we going to wait?" Sitting around among mortals was a waste of time if they were really just going to wait. They weren't the regular ones either, they were the kind he spent most of his time trying to get rid off. This way it was too easy for them to keep an eye on him. He needed to get one alone...
"And that's why I don't believe you when you promise things," he quipped, swinging over to stick to the wall and regard the black and red clad merc, who was now hanging upside-down. Comically, he still hadn't let go of the hot dogs.
A large stocky man pushed his way back to where Peter was sitting, a black baseball cap pulled down over his face. The man plunked down next to him, squishing him against the pole. The guy smelled like an animal as he leaned over toward Peter, tilting his cap back to reveal beady dark eyes.
Ducking back out into the storm, Clint barely had one foot out of the door when he ran into someone.
"Hey! You're the freak here, purple shorts! Now shut up or you'll attract the ghosts!” Deadpool shot back.
They had arrived at Steve's bedroom door. Tony waved for Jarvis to open it and helped the blond man inside rather than just dropping him off there.
Staring the man down, Clint wedged himself between Wade and Bruce, sticking a hand on the stranger’s shoulder to push him back. Bruce didn’t need to Hulk out.
From somewhere off in the dungeon, there was a faint groan, then some coughing. It sounded like he wasn't the only prisoner here. Maybe it was Clint.
Peter hardly paid any attention to the three of them walking away. He was wondering how he could possibly salvage the situation he was now stuck in with Wade and his sort-of-parental-figures all around the same campfire.
Tony glanced after him with a small frown, then snapped right back to making the shiny eyes at Clint. Peter was obviously talking to somebody he knew--it was more irritating that he had his phone on him at all.
Watching the two tall people with the gorgeous hair head off down the beach, Bruce sighed and shook his head.
"Um. Thanks." Loki took a deep breath to humor him. Why, of all the Avengers, did it have to be the most powerful one? Thor at least was foolish and easy to confuse. "Now, can I have a few minutes to think?" He wanted to add 'alone' loudly at the end of that sentence, but refrained.
"Why are you going to Detroit, anyway?" Peter asked it casually, slinging a web at the building across from them and pulling them over the edge.
"Outside...? I thought you wanted to practice somewhere with lasers and robots," Bruce said, blinking. As far as he knew, the only place to find those this time of a relatively peaceful night was to practice in the mansion's training room, which Tony had stocked with robot drones. Namely, the ones he didn't like enough to keep as his workshop assistants.
Cap and Tony, however, were seated on the couch at the back of the room and seemed to be completely ignoring the tale. They hadn’t said a word to each other since everyone crowded inside, though a thanks was mumbled from Tony when Steve handed out towels.
Bruce was still hanging around near the door like going further into the cabin would somehow make the Hulk appear and rip the roof off or something. At Cap's request, he fidgeted for a minute, glancing back outside at the bright sun, then stepped quickly off in the direction Clint had gone.
"T-then I'll go first," the blond said, closing his eyes. His breathing was still awful, but he managed to speak without too much coughing. "We've been f-friends for years n-now, but...I feel like I've never had s-someone I trust more." Gazing at Tony again with baby blue eyes, he chuckled. "If you were a w-woman, I would have asked you to marry me—but, uh." He shook his head, smiling. "The m-men I've fought alongside w-with, even Bucky...Tony, no one c-can replace you." He frowned suddenly. "So p-please don't d-die."
“Hey Cap?” Came a slurred voice. Hawkeye had come over to them, a now-empty tequila bottle in one hand. “You’re the besht dad I’ve ever h-had.” Growing misty eyed, Clint bent to give both men a hug, sniffing. “Thanksh for…” the archer mumbled, some words too quiet to hear, “...all the time. Don’t desherve it.”
As Clint absently wiped his cheek with an arm, he was suddenly reminded that he had a huge scrape there from the rocks—which was now bleeding. Thanks, sand.
"It's way overkill for the plan—he wouldn't make it this dangerous on purpose!" He called back, leading the way to the other cabin. "At least, I hope not!"
He sighed and took the turn his Stark GPS was indicating on the dashboard. It was exhausting thinking every day was going to be another brawl. Switching off was impossible for him, personally, but maybe if he put on enough of a show of relaxing and not worrying, the others might think it was a thing. Leading by example and all that. If only Cap would get that message, too.
"Look, it sounds like fun, but I actually need to sleep at some point. Criminals are like other people—they seem to move around more during the day, so I've gotta be awake during the day to catch them."
“Yeah?” Peter sighed, his shoulders slumping defeatedly as he shoved the backpack back on. “So I’m gonna ruin that, too. Great, I feel even worse now. Thanks.”
“I don’t think I should stay, Peter. I don’t want to get anyone in trouble and I’m sure that driver’s going to sue--”
"...Time to get these other cords out, I guess," Tony said, sounding tired now. "C-care to do the honors...?"
"We have to do something, though," Pepper said anxiously. "Hawkeye is..." She looked at the door the archer had disappeared through and bit her lip. "I really hope he has a plan besides just buying us time."
"Oh, come on," Tony grumbled as he climbed down from the hammock, turning back to face the redhead. "You can't tell me you have no reason to hang around Peter besides keeping Wade in line. Seems like that's a handy excuse for you, but we're not stupid--we both see the way he looks at you." He shot Cap a glance, trying to do like the blond man always did and be on-task when the conversation was about anybody else's problems.
"It's a pretty big scrape, but shallow--nothing too serious," he concluded, moving the other hand to feel the other side of Clint's face. It almost felt nice, if not for the fingers poking at his jaw and then moving to do the same to his neck.
The pizza smelled divine. Bruce would have liked nothing better than to grab a whole box and retreat to his room to devour it. Instead, he cautiously swiped two slices, being careful not to brush hands with Clint or look at him for too long or anything. If things seemed awkward now, he didn't want to THINK about how they would be if the others found out about the escapades he and Clint had been on all night...
This whole trip was a mistake, Tony thought fuzzily, trudging past the giggly frisbee players without a sideways glance. If Steve had been avoiding him before, now he wasn't even wanting to sit on the same side of the campfire. They hadn't exchanged a single word all evening. Meanwhile, Bruce and Clint were acting like incredibly dense newlyweds (Tony STILL couldn't tell if Bruce noticed Clint was hitting on him, even after the whole sunscreen thing), and Hank and Jan and Thor needed to get a room. Probably with the hot string bikini-clad woman they'd somehow roped into playing with them on the beach.
"So, uh, Wade. You mentioned talking to MJ about where I went," Peter began awkwardly. "I hope you didn't freak her out that I was actually missing or something. We're not a couple anymore, but it's not like she hates me or anything."
Oh, boy. Peter took a big, deep breath, painfully aware of the fact that Matt could hear his pulse racing. Yeah, that sure helped his nerves.
"Curing Cap's important, yeah," he said idly. Perhaps they would run into his brother and that other Hawkeye along the way to the cure. "So, uh. Where do you think that OTHER me is?"
There was a tiny splashing sound from the lake shore. The warm torchlights from Loki’s camp flickered off of ripples made by the rock Thor had just skipped out toward it.
"Don't fight in here," the scientist managed a bit faintly. The man was obviously trying to breathe deeply.
As the first blast of foam hit the fire, Cap came out of the burning building, a big man carried over his shoulder. They were both coated head to toe in black ash, but seemed to be in one piece. Steve sat the man down next to the woman and stood up, coughing into his elbow.
‘Loki and Thor, Brothers or Lovers?’ Red text blared on the screen. Quickly going past the title, Loki peeked around and found that the mortals were all caught up in their own business and were ignoring his handsome human form.
Well, the change in accent sure was weird. Peter paused a moment to see if his Spider Sense was setting off any alarms. It wasn't, though; there was no tell-tale tingle coming from the base of his skull this time. He wasn't usually this suspicious, but with Aunt May along he couldn't be too careful—especially since there was nowhere to change into his Spider-Man outfit inside a taxi with his aunt right there.
"Great. From one creepy dungeon to another. At least you won't get grabby like Doom," he muttered, scowling at the floor.
“Sure, why not? We’ll be the anxious phone damsel duo,” he whispered back dryly. “I wanted to have a chat with him anyway.”
"No harm done," Tony promised, for once not adding something sarcastic at the end. He looked up at Steve and fell silent, topaz eyes distant with thought. "...You okay?"  Tony asked, seeming bothered all of a sudden.
Both Clint and Loki paused to eavesdrop. The injured Jotun reached to place a hand on Bruce's shoulder, almost pushing Hawkeye away.
Hauling Bruce along by the arm, Clint was honed in on the scent of fresh coffee. It was drifting out of the camp as they got closer.
"That's...that's nice," Bruce mumbled, sounding distracted. He was also looking off to the side, and hadn't so much as blinked at the acid display across the room. The Hulk must have chosen now to speak with him.
“We’ll be fine!” Clint insisted, snagging Hulk’s arm and pulling on it to try and steer him away from camp. All he wanted to do was climb a tree and have a big green Hulk hammock to snooze on.
His voice cracked in the middle, and he cleared his throat, shaking his head. No, he couldn’t say it like that. Nothing sounded like the right way, but he had to—Cap didn’t seem willing to talk about this, so he HAD to.
"You haven't even seen him," Bruce told the blonde, sighing. "He's dosed up on morphine, don't take him too seriously."
"The other night Bruce talked to you the same time Clint was talking to me," he pointed out to Steve. "What did HE tell you about him and Clint? Because I'm pretty sure Clint was making up half of what he told me that night. Not sure why, but he was pretty keen on dosing me up with tequila, too." He sat the spatula aside and stepped away from the counter, running a hand over his face before sighing and rubbing at his eyes. They still kind of stung. "I guess it doesn't really matter. They're adults. As long as the Hulk doesn't demolish this beach then I don't care what they do. It's not like they're Peter."
Rather than sitting Steve on the couch, Thor went past the living room and headed for the medical room, where Bruce was still supposedly working on Steve's cure.
“What he lacks is power. Too bad we are not outside with your hammer.” Loki sighed, reaching out to press his fingertips onto Tony's hand that covered his reactor. His hand began to glow—an eerie green quickly traveling through Loki’s hand to Tony’s.
"Doom...? Victor von Doom?" Pepper didn't sound like she'd seen the man face to face like he had. Well, as close to a face as Doom had left.
Tony frowned and looked over his shoulder in the direction of the metallic sound since the voice was kind of muffled by rain. He didn't stop leaning on the car, though. The voice didn't SOUND like any super villains he knew...
"Apology accepted," he told Steve quietly, trying to sound good-natured about it as he gave the big blond a slap on the shoulder. "You know what, I should talk to Clint and Bruce too. Be right back."
"It looks worse than it is," he concluded. "If we go for a swim, the saltwater should clean it nicely and it'll be okay. You're up to date on your tetanus shots, right?"
“A-absolutely,” Clint stammered. Bonfires were a totally normal beach thing, but the idea that BRUCE wanted to make a bonfire was just plain…cute?
"Was last night the FIRST time you heard about my ex? Oof. Thought I mentioned him before, but maybe I got on the model talk train and chugged full speed ahead that way." He paused to sip his coffee, wincing slightly. "I'm not sure why you're whispering, but it's kind of fun. Carry on."
In retrospect, Bruce thought as he inched along the hallway in the pitch blackness, grabbing a flashlight from the medical room would have been smart. Unfortunately the medical room was about fifteen minutes and who knew how many feet of hallway away by now, and there was no turning back.
Peter sighed and glanced at him. WHY did he smell like perfume? Wait, was that MJ's perfume? He quickly looked back up at the sky, trying to think of a way to leave now that the obligatory hot dog eating had concluded.
“While the recent pictures have been proved to be faked, it’s hard to fake a videos from so many different networks!”
"Your bandages...I-I'll fix it, Clint, don't move." He looked and sounded pretty exhausted; Loki was pretty sure he was leaning on the couch, not just hiding behind it.
Somehow he doubted it was a proposal. That would be kind of priceless, actually. The blond man didn't finish his sentence though, instead leading Tony to the door.
"At least when the bad guys use science as a weapon, you can always science your way back out of it," Bruce said, nodding. "I mean, scientific things can be recreated. Well, most of them, anyway."
“Should we intervene?” Steve asked, glancing at Tony for help. There was no doubt in his mind that Loki would talk circles around Thor, especially if Thor was trying not to start a fight. Maybe Loki would behave himself once he saw Thor’s hammer.
"Come with us," Thor beckoned the beautiful green-eyed woman with him, taking her hand. Peter was half-leading, half-dragging Wade along, the blond still carrying the broken frisbee.
"Hey...there goes Iron Man!" The armored hero had, indeed, just zoomed past above. His jet trail was still there, sort of.
At the rate those guys were going, they were probably using the horrible weather as an immediate problem to focus on so they could avoid actually having an honest conversation about each other.
Steve was distracted. He found his eyes wandering around the medical room—in particular, to Clint's bloodstained side and the straps around his wrists. He couldn't shake off the thought that if he didn't know Bruce, this looked sort of like a scene from an old horror movie. A handsome man strapped to a table, a looming villain poised with glowing eyes. He snapped back to what Bruce was saying, nodding quickly.
In view on either side of the lot sat two mirror cabins atop small man-made plateaus. Each had a dark blue exterior, a white A-frame rooftop, and matching white framed porthole windows overlooking a carefully sculpted set of stone steps.
"I have already traced Captain America's and Hawkeye's last known locations through their Avengers cards," Jarvis responded. "The Captain activated his hours ago today, but it was promptly shut off, and now both are untraceable."
"Gee, which do you think?" Peter tilted his head, looking up at Deadpool. He tended to forget how tall Wade was. The guy bounced around like a jumping bean, and rarely stood still for a comparison.
Since he’d been pulling pretty hard, he realized the weight was gone a second too late. The result was crashing face-first into Wade’s chest, arms and legs wrapping around him like a koala.
"If you lock me in a cell, so help me god—I'm gonna shoot you when I get out,” Clint exclaimed loudly, pointing between the two of them.
"This is awesome," Peter declared, holding up the phone to show him and Steve the picture. They looked like a happy family, smiling in the sun with their sandcastle and Tony's shades reflecting the beautiful beach view opposite them. Tony had sneaked an arm over to rest on Steve's shoulder for the picture, and had been met with no resistance.
Peter would have grumbled about having to carry Deadpool around, but frankly the sooner they slung their way to this rumored place with "STEAK" printed on it, the sooner Wade would be shipping himself off on a self-imposed trip to Detroit.
“Ah man!” Clint groaned from behind them. He rushed in the middle of the gathered group, snagging the fishing box and shoving it back into the trunk.
"What?!" Bruce was startled enough by that to make both Clints jump a little. Tony glanced back at them quickly, too.
Bruce sighed heavily and combed his fingers through his hair, trying to get it to stay out of his face.
“No,” Cap sighed, looking over at Bruce. “It’s not that.” The captain struggled to come up with words for a moment, then he shook his head and braced himself on the door frame with a hand. “…I heard you two are together.”
"Oh, hey," he told Cap conversationally, albeit rather faintly. He gave a small, suggestive grin and added, "C-can't keep your hands off me, huh?"
"I don't think they're dating," he said frankly. "I don't think they realize the other is also interested, and it bothers them, and it looks like they're not getting along pretty often because of it."
"That's good," Clint said nervously, clearing his throat and dropping the pile of covers on the bed. "Wouldn't want you to be angry at me." He sighed, teeth chattering now that he was standing in the cooler air. "Maybe the sandwich place is open now, though. If you’re up for it."
Steve went over to Tony, hovering a hand over his back. The chance of lightning striking them had to be very low. Still, Tony was a normal person.
Tony's armor could fly him around faster than jets moved—he had to have seen the beacon by now, and was on his way, Cap told himself. Then they—and poor Clint—could get out of here.
Thor placed him on his feet carefully, keeping a hand on his back like he might topple over again at any moment. The thunder god didn't appear embarrassed at all by the situation, but he definitely noticed Loki’s form's flushed face, judging by his expression.
"And whatever you've heard about Daredevil, that's probably exaggerated too," Peter added, frowning. "He's a vigilante, but technically so am I. You realize that, right?"
Raking his hair over his shoulder to wring it out, he suddenly eyed the spot where Cap and Tony were.
No, he couldn’t sleep yet—he and Bruce had barely gotten to swim. Mustering all his effort, Clint pushed himself back up into a sitting position.
"Hey, uh, pretty night out," he said lamely, with a slightly cringing smile. "Oh, man, that sounds like I'm trying to hit on you!" He shoved his phone into the pocket of his borrowed jeans and then held up both hands. "There's not like a hurricane warning or something, is there? You're packing up like sirens are going off," he observed.
Clint was relieved that everyone seemed to be settling down. The medical room hadn’t seen so much action in...ever. Besides him and Tony, nobody really needed to get patched up a lot. It had gotten pretty quiet.
"Huh? You say something?" Peter glanced at him, making his eyes extra wide and blinking to feign innocence.
The usual robotic limbs came rising out of the floor and quickly stowed the pieces of the suit away, leaving Tony in his more ordinary slacks and dress shirt underneath. He knelt down and rolled Steve over, patting the blond's chest. "Seriously, are you gonna croak on me?"
"What for? I-I got him already. With that...s-super strength, you know it's gonna...be a FUN honeymoon, too..." He added a quirk of his eyebrows for emphasis.
A loud crash sounded from further across the street, and smoke began to pour from the windows of the building there. An explosion?
"Let go of him!" Bruce told Amora firmly. Loki or not, the guy on the ground looked like Clint...and an injured patient was an injured patient, right? It just wasn't right to leave anybody to this fate.
A moment later, Clint came out with his arms hugging a big blue cooler. He was talking over his shoulder at Bruce.
“I mean, that’s what you guys are doing,” Peter pointed out, shrugging. Wow, maybe he could get away with hiding the fact that he and Wade were dating after all if Cap and Tony thought that was all that was going on. Maybe if they thought it was a ‘just friends’ situation they wouldn’t go digging too deep into Wade’s history. Hopefully.
If he had, Hulk would know about it. Clint had dizzy memories of hanging out with his giant green friend last night after Bruce had gone to sleep. There was no way Hulk would have thrown the box out, right? Maybe he'd smashed it... Ugh, Clint wouldn't put it past his very drunk self last night to ASK Hulk to smash the box. Bruce had spent the entire day with him, pretty much, and even sneakily plotted with him about how to figure out Cap's and Tony's relationship woes. They made a good team. Clint didn't regret hiding the stupid box.
“Yeah… I’m more worried about what he’s planning to do with those people in his camp,” he said wearily, sitting down on his sleeping bag. Grabbing the corner of his camp blanket, he started to dry his hair off with it (and make it even more of a curly disaster in the process.) “Calling them ‘witnesses’ and ‘collateral’ like you guys described, that sounds like he won’t hurt them unless we try to stop whatever he’s up to. He can’t be up to anything good if he thinks we’ll try to stop it, though.”
Growing more serious, Steve stared over at him. After a moment of thought, he simply took a sip from his root beer and stared back out to sea as glumly as ever.
“W-we got kind of lost hiking,” he explained quickly, taking one of Matt’s arms and leading him back toward the campfire. “Sorry I’m all wet—we fell in the lake, too. And got rained on. And went through a cave. Wade knew a shortcut.” He glanced back over his shoulder to smile at Wade, carefully avoiding looking at Cap in the process. Arriving at the campfire with Matt, he asked, “Is Hawkeye okay, Tony? His stitches have been bleeding all over the place.”
“You sure? Okay.” Peter pulled out some more gauze on a roll and wound it carefully around Clint’s arm to wrap the piece he held into place. Tying the ends, he used a bit of medical tape to be sure it stayed put. Poor Hawkeye—getting dragged up the mountain by him and Wade couldn’t be much fun while wounded. “I’ve got some painkillers in here, if you want ‘em,” Peter offered sheepishly.
Crawling out of his sleeping bag, Tony stretched and shoved a pair of shoes on, grabbing the coffee pot. He stepped out of the tent and meandered toward the campfire, yawning. What time was it, anyway?
“Well, hello sunshine,” Tony quipped back, slapping the newspaper down beside Cap’s shield and pointing to it accusingly. “I’d ask what you two have been up to, but the press answered that for me!”
Pepper seemed like she was about to say something about it—again—when there was a little crackle of the radio in the Iron Man helmet on the floor.
“Don’t just blame the Hulk, either,” Tony said grimly. “Thor said you were in a bad mood yesterday, and you’ve been avoiding even camping near us all weekend. First their tent got flattened, then Matt’s cane and glasses disappear? No way that’s a coincidence.” He frowned, waving his hand at Bruce for emphasis. “Everybody has a lousy day once in awhile, that I get, but what kind of twisted person takes that out on the one normal civilian and DISABLED person around?”
"Not much of anything. Cap's off on patrol, who knows where everybody else is. I slept in late and it's been eerily quiet all day. Kinda bored." The archer eyed him tiredly. "Want to go on night patrol or something?"
Everyone in New York was convinced that he and Tony were together. Even some of the other Avengers had made comments and jabs at them being an item. After being around Tony for even a few months, Cap had started to notice the lingering thoughts about him. His smug smirk and biting wit. Those beautiful topaz eyes.
The blond let the thought pass by. It somehow felt way harder to ask Bruce out than a regular person. Either because he was the first man Clint was attracted to, or because he was a close friend—who knew. It just seemed like a daunting task, especially when Clint was hung over with sand under his tongue.
Tossing his hands up, Clint spun and plunked down on the edge of the balcony. It overlooked the beach, giving him a clear view of where everyone was.
As he reached the edge of the tree line, Peter looked out across the lake. The little shore spot where Thor had been sitting this morning was empty now.
“They’ll be sorry when he’s the next billionaire in New York. Peter’s a keeper. Between me and Wade, we barely get to see him around school and work. It must be nice to live in the same house.”
Great, he’d just be barging in on everybody’s vacation if he disturbed Hank and Jan, too. Resigned to being awkward, Peter turned and knocked on the leftmost door first.
Oh, right. Peter had been enjoying having them around so much he’d kind of forgotten that they hadn’t even arrived here with everybody else.
“I was jumping over a hedge. It was cut in an elephant shape or something.” Jumping back, he balled his fists. “You seriously thought that Hulk and I were sleeping together? Are you CRAZY? Pfft!”
“You said it yourself, the two of us had a whole day together, free from big green interruptions. Sorry buddy,” Clint added under his breath, swigging his drink.
“Silence! How dare you speak to ME in such a manner, mortal!” Their magical guest threw the bow aside. Raising his arms above his head, a glowing circle appeared at his feet—raising up over his head to reveal his true form. Loki stood before them, evil grin on his face.
"Cap? Th-they got YOU?" The woman coughed again, but when she spoke up louder, she sounded familiar. The next sentence clarified that quickly. "They didn't get Tony, did they?"
"Let me go. I'll help you find him," Clint offered her. He looked like he would rather be sleeping, too.
Stuffing his foot back into the hiking boot and lacing it as quickly as possible, Clint went to get up…and didn’t.
"Tony has no way of finding us!" Pepper put her hands over her face. "What's he going to do with us, Cap? There's no way out..."
"Yep." The merc nodded. "Let's just hope...it's not Chris's blood." After a dramatic pause, he suddenly headed for the stairs.
"You don't have to do that—if it's anybody's fault the papers are everywhere, it's mine." He frowned, adding pointedly, "You should take a hot bath or something—you got chilled out there."
The set of big blue eyes staring at him blinked, then Wade asked in a whisper, “Did I get shot in the head again? Damn, that always makes the hallucinations weirder.”
"Take a seat," Bruce sighed. "The couch will work, I guess." He sounded terribly unenthused with playing at being a medical doctor...probably because he actually wasn't one, even if he knew a lot about doctoring from years of unofficially practicing as one.
“It’s fine,” Bruce said uneasily, glancing at the chair. He didn’t move to sit down, instead sort of wringing his hands. “Why do we need to talk?”
"This's a lot cooler," he admitted to Clint, nodding. "Thanks. Are you gonna stay up here with the team, or...?"
"I learned that a long time ago, Miss." Slowing his pace he sighed again. "We both know that Tony isn't the marrying kind and I'm not even sure he's, er, interested in men," he said quietly, just in case someone was in the hall. “We're close friends. Is it possible that you're reading him wrong?”
"Bon voyage!" He called, trying not to sound as eager as he was to get them paddling away already. They needed this. If they could just have one honest conversation they couldn't run away from or distract themselves from, his 'dads' might return a real couple. What a thought.
“What does that mean?” Cap asked, clearly not amused by Deadpool’s nonsense so early in the morning.
Sighing, Bruce stepped into the room and shut the door. Dropping the clothes into his hammock, he started pulling his hoodie off over his head.
That was great to keep tabs on super villains, but made dating unsupervised kind of a problem for Peter.
"Why are you wearing a tracking bracelet? That's Tony's tech, isn't it?" Bruce leaned over close to him to see the device without actually grabbing Clint's hand and pulling it closer. He blinked.
"Jarvis, do y-you know if Tony is on his way back here yet?" Maybe Tony did take a detour. A long one.
"If a little poke hurts, the needle will definitely be worse," he pointed out. "I have to be sure before I stitch the injury up."
"I'll have a cure cooked up in no time!" He said a little too cheerily, patting Steve's chest a few times before going back to typing on the console. "Jarvis, compare that sample against the sample of the gas from the bombing and Captain America's normal stats. Put all of those readouts on screens 2, 3 and 4—and, you know? Scan Pepper and give me her stats while you're at it..."
"I mean, if you like it, okay. But if you change your mind, just let me know." He turned to Tony. "Want me to bring you some paper and a pencil to get started on that sandcastle design?"
"Owwww!" The merc groaned childishly. He sat back down into the seat, rubbing his head. "You aren't going to give the city a crawl? Maybe...bug the neighborhood villains?" Wade poked Peter's cheek playfully. "Maybe...maybe," he chuckled into his hand, as if his jokes were actually amusing, "swing by the Bugle?"
"Not gay. Got it." Pointedly sitting his hands on his knees, Loki gave Bruce a nod. "Let's just get this over with already."
“Think so,” Clint told him, distracted all over again from looking at Bruce. Brown eyes were nice, especially with Bruce’s face around them. “Hey,” he said, leaning to catch the other man’s gaze. “I’m sorry you don’t have your tackle box.”
He was disappointed to see through the open cabin door that Cap and his almost-kid were still hovering in the kitchen. They were chatting and making sandwiches.
“Our cabin,” Steve said from beside Tony, turning to look back at the building. Then he was looking at Tony. “You don’t think it’s…Peter’s friend?”
With a flick of his hand, Loki sent Wade flying out of camp, crashing head-first into the lake. Dusting his hands, the God of Mischief headed Peter’s way.
"If he's the impostor and can fake an injury, you could be an impostor and fake an illness," Bruce sighed, taking hold of the arrow. "Are you ready for this?"
“I dunno, Tony said this was a low-tech beach. There might not be airplanes,” Clint replied, matching his tone.
Why couldn’t Clint just ignore Bruce? Natasha was hot, and sometimes she even flirted back. That was close enough to a relationship. Kicks, winks and the very occasional kiss. Pft, who needed actual companionship, anyway?
"Whoa!" A familiar youthful voice exclaimed from the trunk. "Whoops, wrong trunk, this isn't New Jersey!"
Pushing open the basement door, Clint peered in. It wasn’t like he had his bow, so Bruce wasn’t really sure what he was planning to do.
“Imagine if we’d taken the entire team instead of just a few at a time,” Tony said drolly. He smiled after a moment, though, raising Steve’s hand up to kiss it. “I admit, I’d love to actually be able to wear our engagement rings. If we could sneak around for the last month, though, we can sneak around a few more days. Let’s do this right. Even if this trip goes up in flames, I still get you all to myself for the honeymoon.”
“Oh sure! In fact, we hang out sans the mask too,” Deadpool said, turning to flash Peter a cheeky grin.
"Wait. If he managed to lose Thor, then he wasn't here for Thor. Maybe Doom isn’t behind this." He looked over at Bruce for confirmation.
"Oh, no no, I'm not asking for..." Bruce actually held up his hands and waved them in front of him hastily, wide-eyed. If he was protesting THAT much... Clearing his throat, the scientist explained sheepishly, "I-I'm off limits, so I can't...uh, a-anyway, I just keep getting the feeling that a few people have something going on that they're not talking about. And since Tony is one of them and you know him so well, I wondered if you noticed."
“They know, why keep that form—I am certain they would dearly LOVE to watch you die!” He braced a boot on the injured man's chest. “But I suppose there is no need to hide my form either. That...metal golem of a man has failed us both now—but I will still have Thor!”
Behind Thor, not far down the beach, Peter noticed a gaggle of young kids racing with a bucket full of water carried between two of them.
"I think you t-take care of each other." He gave her a smile and stepped back a bit to give her some space. "We need to look this whole place over." He leaned on the wall again, moving along it to examine the place better.
“Banner, good morning!” Thor said brightly, waving him over. “The others are about to drink their morning coffee, so perhaps you and I can keep each other company since neither of us plan to partake.”
"As long as you're not both pretending to have fun just to make me happy," Peter replied worriedly. "No offense, but you guys seem like you're mad at each other." Tony opened his mouth to reply, then quickly shut it again. He glanced at Cap and frowned.
“Are you two serious? I know I’m not around as myself much, but you know Hulk pretty well by now, and he’s put himself into harm’s way countless times to protect civilians. You don’t know me, but I’m around all the time in Hulk’s head, and I know you. I know you wouldn’t joke about something this serious. What in the world made you think I did this?”
Thor strolled back into the cabin, golden hair soaking wet and hanging down around his shoulders. He grinned and shouldered Mjolnir.
The teenager sat on the rooftop cross-legged, pulling off his mask. It was still dim out, and up on a rooftop there was nobody to see, anyway.
"Okay, if this is about the models," he began, frowning, "I hope you're not saying looks are the only reason I'm looking at you. Because they're not."
“I did not,” Loki said haughtily. “I don’t know anything about a lake monster. I came here to camp.”
Peter would have rolled his eyes if Loki wouldn’t have taken it the wrong way. It was WAY too late for Wade to get away with not even being seen, here, and he had to know it. Denial would get him nowhere once they finally got to talk about this incident.
“Who are you? Show yourself!” Cap’s reaction didn’t help reassure Tony as he stepped back, poised for a fight.
“Yes!” Came the immediately response from Clint. They exchanged a glance and Clint frowned, his face flushing a bit. “…Why? Did he say something?”
Bruce cringed a little. The people who ran the place were still inside and everything! Gingerly, he placed his hands on Clint's shoulders and took hold of them, steering him away from the door.
“Thank you,” Peter said, hoping his nervousness could be passed off for ‘flattered and flustered.’ “Listen, sorry about Wade…uh, barging.” He gestured in the general direction of the lake awkwardly. “I hope your book dried out okay.”
"Sure, sure." He started out of the door, taking note of where the others were. Everyone except for Hank was already inside the cabin. The blond scientist was pulling a couple of regular-sized suitcases--that was to say, large-for-regular-sized--out of the trunk with a determined frown. Back at the mansion Hank had offered to shrink the luggage to make it super easy to carry, but Tony had known exactly what he was up to, and wouldn't allow it. No sneaking along a whole lab shrunken down small enough to pack. No conveniently having to bring along the Pym particle gun to resize the luggage and everything else. This was a low-tech vacation, and Hank would have to carry full-size luggage like everybody else.
"Soo..." Clint began, hand still firmly on Bruce's shoulder. "Do you think Thor's up there or is that just regular old thunder?"
“Oh, me neither!” Peter said hastily, holding up his hands. He mustered a nervous smile. “I thought maybe we could be not very good at it together, you know?”
When he was talking to Peter, it hadn’t occurred to him that maybe he was just nervous about his SCHOOL knowing he was dating another man. There was no helping that now, though.
"Fine." He stepped around the Hulk, going back over to dig in the medical bag. He had seen this done before. It couldn't be that difficult. His side was already stitched closed, so as long as none of those had been ripped, all he had to do was clean it up and bandage it. The blond picked up the small first aid pamphlet and thumbed through it. Disinfect, gauze and wrap.
Iron Man stopped and hovered in the air, ignoring the blaring readout in the corner of his helmet's screen about power outages back home. The mansion had backups, they'd be fine.
"I shall order the Chinese!" Thor headed over to the phone. "But first, I shall dial the 411 and learn what number to enter..." Before Jarvis could rattle off the number for the Chinese place, he was already dialing and listening to the receiver.
"Please, Wade, just tell Cap and Tony that we're not together," he whispered. "I'm begging you, here. The Avengers actually let me stay after crashing their vacation, don't mess this up for me!"
He tossed it to Cap, who flipped it like he often did with his shield, before throwing it over to Peter. Despite the joking tone, Wade looked a bit on-edge now.
Crossing the room, Cap easily pulled Tony under his arm to switch to holding him princess-style, then frowned at him. The weird spin had made Tony’s head hurt.
"Hey, you guys look cozy!" A loud voice said from in front of them. A red masked hero sat up from against the wall and headed their way. "Wait a sec. Didn't I just see you?" He pointed at Loki. "Only...you were purple. Do you remember me? I’m Deadpool. I’m kinda a big deal."
Had he walked up the hiking path all by himself? That was two miles! He had to have, though, there was no other way up…
“Why’d we have to come to a freaking hot spot? It’s like 90 degrees!” Clint moaned from the backseat, poking his head up into view of the rear view mirror. “I voted for the ski resort!”
"Sorry buddy." He suddenly turned and jabbed Bruce with it. Crackles of blue electricity lit up the hall as a lot of voltage shot through the small framed man's body.
Cap came back to sit a little plastic box full of spices on the counter, picking through them carefully while he read the recipe card.
"Like I said, Cupid, Banner's sleeping. Don't tell him I was here and he'll never know," he said confidently.
“Aye, the meatball subs of legend!” Turning hopeful eyes back to Loki, he lifted one of the lady Trickster’s hands and kissed it gently. “Please?”
Needles weren’t Clint’s favorite thing either. He watched the one in black offer his arm to Tony, frowning at the floor. Gee, somebody looked guilty!
As soon as he explained the plan, he cringed. No, no, no. That meant Bruce was talking to Cap—who he may have a crush on. Then again, if Bruce wanted to matchmake Tony and Cap, how serious could it be?
"Aha." He pulled out a small silver case. "I think these are them. I patched Cap up a few times." Offering them to Bruce, he smirked.
It was too early to think about it, he decided. Clearing his throat, Cap ducked back around the kitchen counter to check the waffle iron.
Steve gave him a smirk in passing, heading down the hall to where the website had said the bedrooms were located.
“I saw that, but I didn’t know what half the ingredients were,” Cap told him sheepishly. “I thought it’d just be easier to make some.”
"Huh?" Came the voice again. "I'm the one who...uh." Again, there was a pause as this Clint thought. "You know, I have no way of telling us apart. Did we do anything unique in the last couple days?" He asked slowly. "Uh. I'm the one who...uh...wanted to go get sandwiches? Unless the other mes did that too." A hand suddenly found Bruce's arm. "Hey, there you are."
Letting go of Tony’s hand, Cap grabbed the nose of boat and started to drag it to the water. It was then that he noticed sand in the bottom.
Bruce was used to smart people. Someone he could have a conversation with about…smart things. There was no way Clint had a chance at being smart or APPEARING to be smart, so he’d have to use something else.
Peter stuck a web to the ceiling and hung from it upside-down, narrowly escaping being hit by Thor's charge into the room.
Just as Steve was contemplating what in the room was round and usable as a makeshift shield, Doom's metallic footsteps sounded from the hallway. He was returning with a tray full of beakers? Because that didn't look ominous.
"It's okay, Cap, he's asleep right now." He turned the marshmallow over, examining it in the firelight. It seemed like he wanted to say more, but he glanced at Peter a time or two and only sighed.
"It's, er, it's after midnight," Bruce informed him awkwardly, pointing at his watch. The one he'd forgotten he was wearing when wondering about the time earlier...apparently he'd used up all of his brain processing power on those papers.
Hawkeye moved in, too. They paused a few feet away from each other, the original now dressed in purple and still shaking slightly from the cold.
"All of NEW YORK? Jameson's still here, he's on TV," Spider-Man said dubiously. "They probably didn't want him."
"I, ah, I might've gotten stabbed in the hand. It's nothing," he said quietly. "Hawkeye left to find you—did you see him?"
"...Later then," the armored Avenger added, turning and rocketing away toward the entrance to Castle Doom.
Bruce stepped over to help him up, looking worried. "Sorry to yell, Clint—I, ah, I thought you'd be halfway down the hallway by now," he said.
"When I last saw him, he was quite well," Thor assured Steve, leading him over to sit down right where he'd been sitting just a minute ago. Seeing the medical supplies on the table, he glanced at the others worriedly, wondering which of them the items had been used on.
"His...dads?" Pepper's brows rose. As far as she was aware, Peter Parker's only living family was his aunt.
“How about some coffee? You work at a newspaper, don’t tell me you don’t drink coffee,” Tony said, lifting the percolator off of the campfire. He’d gotten distracted by the conversations, and it was probably going to be some strong stuff. “Thor’s skipping it today, so there’s an extra cup in here.”
The fact that Steve was engaged was still surprising when he took a moment to think about it. They weren’t wearing rings yet, of course, but it all felt so surreal.
"W-well...good!" Tony grumbled, still wincing. "Because Tony Stark's...not the marrying type..." He was leaving? Really? Not only did he decide Tony wasn't good enough based on gender—something he was born with, c'mon—but now Steve was leaving? Nope, that wasn't about to happen.
"I'm fine," Steve sighed, watching the screens again. “Sat a lot in d-dungeons. Standing is nice.” There was a pause as Cap coughed wetly into his elbow, shaking his head afterward. “Carol went t-to get Bruce. I'm sure they're on their way."
"Why did we even bother with a vacation?" He asked Daredevil, mostly because he was the only person there to talk at. Without waiting for a reply, he added tiredly, "How exactly did you track Deadpool here, by the way? How well do you know the guy? Do you know his real identity?"
Peter actually did have his phone, Clint realized. His phone he had deliberately turned off to make it seem like the battery was dead.
“It took me forever to get down here! The train was PACKED and everyone was confused why I wanted to come here and Matt gave me so much SHIT about that homeless guy—he yelled at me for like HOURS! I told him you were, you know, MISSING, and we went to your school in hoodies and stalked your ex. But SHE didn’t know where you either, then I remembered the hot dog and I took the first bus out! Sorry I’m late!” He plunked Peter down on his feet, then hugged him tightly again. “Ah man, I miss you! You smell like waffles,” he added, sounding curious.
“Sounds nice,” Tony said absently, going through the motions of prepping the coffee pot without even really looking at it. Realizing they were alone again, he hopped up and moved over to slip an arm around Steve’s waist, smiling up at him. “You know, maybe after we butter Clint up with some coffee, it’d be a good time to sit him down and…you know.” Their goal this weekend WAS to announce their engagement to the team gradually, one person at a time, after all.
"Oh, that's cute. Th...the bad guy's knocking my love life. I'm the playboy, remember?" He pointed at Thor, adding, "A-and isn't Thor your brother? That's kinda gross."
This day was off to a peachy start. What kind of good news could Tony and Cap possibly have? If it wasn’t ‘we’re going home early,’ Clint didn’t want to hear it right now.
"Better watch out, we're doing so good they're gonna make us swap teams to even things out," he joked. A ways down the beach from them, the rival team of Hank and Jan were indeed looking kind of out of breath.
Wade still referred to Steve and Tony as Peter's dads, Tony noted with a pang of regret. Maybe he'd screwed it up. Maybe if he'd done things differently, Steve might have been interested somehow, or at least wouldn't have gone out of his way to say how they definitely were not together. Tony thought they were pretty compatible, if they could just have a few minutes ALONE to actually talk about things. Maybe tomorrow when everybody else went outside and Daredevil was safely on his way back to New York, or something.
"That...man. That has to be the least of our problems right now." Hawkeye came over to Bruce's side, putting a bloodstained hand on his arm. "You okay?"
"They have this one sandwich with ham, chicken, avocado and sauerkraut. It's awesome." Clint brushed a trickle of water off his cheek, still smiling.
“Let’s go. I’m sure the shark is long gone by now, and we can’t stay exposed to the weather like this.”
"Ugh," the archer grimaced. "Comprende—" He rolled back from where Thor landed, reaching for his bow—only to clasp his fingers around empty air.
"Huh? Bug genomes?" Peter asked, making Tony jump. When had the kid gotten back? He was wearing some purple jeans that had to belong to Bruce, a slightly oversized gray T-shirt with "Donutstravaganza!!! 1998" plastered across the chest in hot pink, rainbow-sprinkled lettering, and no shoes.
Peter stared at him, blushing despite himself. Jeez, he was talking like Peter was going to MARRY Wade or something.
"Well, this's unexpected," Tony commented, squinting up at the sky. Another bolt of lightning flashed across the sky, and suddenly the rain let loose, pouring down in sheets. Tony's hair was instantly hanging in his eyes, his red shirt plastered to his chest with the Arc reactor glowing blue right through it. "Oookay, let's get in the cabin, everybody." Thunder growled across the sky like it was answering him.
“Hey Matt! You should totally play frisbee with us!” Wade cut in excitedly. “Bugs’ dads are crazy good! I almost lost an eye!”
"Don't fight..." Bruce was examining the needle he'd been stabbed with unhappily. "Do you know if Tony has any other titanium needles? This one is a biohazard now."
"The Hulk isn't showing up, but I'll come watch YOU train if that's less boring. I need to get out of this room—it's starting to feel like prison."
They passed one of many huge umbrellas on the beach and Clint noticed a set of women’s feet resting on her lounge chair, gold toenails sparkling in the sun.
"11:15 PM, sir," Jarvis replied glibly. "And Ms. Danvers may be mistaken about Hawkeye being taken away."
“What if we did a boat thing? People team up, take a boat and go collect things? Or plant flags. Something like that,” Matt offered.
"Okay, okay, you got this. It's a silver lining, now you have a sec to plan what you're gonna tell him," he said, as if coaching people on this was something he'd done before. Maybe he had with some of his high school friends. "Step one, take a big deep breath. Step two--uh, do you plan to confess feelings at him or let him down gently? Because step two's REALLY different depending on which one of those you pick."
"I'll help you pick it u—" Clint sneezed suddenly, grabbing the counter to keep from falling over. He sneezed again and then sighed. "I'll help. I'm pretty good with making piles of paper—you can thank Shield for that one."
"Yeah,” Clint snickered. He sat quietly for a minute then looked over at Bruce again, water slinging from his chin with the motion. "Maybe we should go find a bus stop? You know, with a roof?"
“…Boyfriend?” Pondering over the word for a second, Loki sat back and wove his fingers together. “I thought I smelled romance between you two.”
“Of course I will, baby,” Wade said sweetly, pecking Peter’s cheek. “Riiiight after I show Matt to the door. And by door, I mean trail.”
“Boring isn’t the word,” Bruce said dryly, glancing up at him. He readied another piece of gauze, dousing it with alcohol and dabbing at the wound. “The Avengers lead amazing lives full of action and adventure. I’ve traveled the world, been to space, and even gone to the Negative Zone. Hulk really is a hero. I think he’s done a lot of good here, even if most people are still afraid of him. As for me…”
“I doubt that Loki will make any moves tonight,” Thor said, holding up his hand for Mjolnir already, “But I will gladly assist, of course!” The magic hammer came singing through the air to Thor’s palm. Catching it, he whirled it in a circle and took off into the sky, thunder rolling like his own personal special effects at that very moment.
What was he thinking? The team needed two leaders, not parents. As much as the Avengers liked to make jabs at him and Tony, it’d be easier on everyone if they kept their relationship professional. It was easier that way. They’d be focused on their work and not each other.
Thor looked at him in surprise and some kind of touched gratitude. He had just opened his mouth to reply when the door slammed open with a 'THUD' loud enough to make both of them flinch.
"Oh, please." Loki rolled his eyes. "I can handle myself." He continued up the stairs slowly. Whoever it had been was long gone now. Arriving at the top, he pushed the door open and stepped out into the hall, ashamed that he was panting. He looked both ways and turned back to Bruce. "This place is creepy at half power."
"Pretty sure the last few hours last night count as sleepwalking," Tony said with good-natured weariness, accepting the cup of coffee. "For me? Wow, what did drunk me even say to you?"
“I’ll head up the trail on foot,” he said, stopping at Tony before he remembered that he couldn’t give him a kiss goodbye. “Can you stay here with Matt? I’m worried he’ll try and run off,” he whispered.
"Right," Bruce said, all business. "Subtle sabotage, then. Maybe we could send them way out into the ocean on a jet ski and barely put any gas in it."
"I'm s-sorry big guy. I didn't do it on purpose," the blond told him honestly. He guessed even the Hulk liked a day off on occasion. They could all use one. "I won't try it again. Just, uh, go back to bed and I'll leave Bruce to his paperwork."
It was true. If Tony had had some secret fling, the Bugle would have found out about it somehow. If they had any idea Peter spent so much time with the Avengers, Peter would be permanently on "Stark and Rogers" duty, he was sure of it. Sigh.
"Let's just...not," Bruce said glumly, holding up a hand. It happened to be the one he'd tossed a bandage on after getting stabbed with the needle earlier. He probably should clean and dress it properly, but at the moment he didn't feel like it. Even if this Clint WAS the real one, after whatever ordeal he'd been through with Doctor Doom, romance was probably the last thing on his mind.
"I jest, my friends! Of course you're getting along well--I happened upon you this morning and you seemed quite amiable indeed!" With a little smirk, he turned and headed off down the hallway for the cabin door.
An eerie laugh that echoed over the water, bouncing between the trees and fading into the dark of night.
Muttering under his breath, Clint hurried to climb down from his perch on the rocks. Thor had gone way overboard with the whole ‘strand Cap and Tony’ shtick. So much so that Clint was unable to stay on his lookout point anymore due to extremely crazy gusts of wind. Never mind the downpour and the fact that he couldn’t even SEE their leaders anymore.
"Why? You..." Cap coughed, putting a hand to his throat. Taking a ragged breath, he managed to continue, "You h-haven't finished the t-trade." He reached out and gently pushed the goblet away with his hand. "Your word."
The other Hawkeye moved closer and grimaced, taking note of the needle. He reached over carefully, pulling Loki's hand off of Bruce’s.
"That would be sweet," Peter quipped, taking another bite of his graham cracker. He got to his feet easily even with Wade hanging off of him, then realized this might look a BIT strange to Lola since she didn't know about the superpowers thing, and pretended to fall right back over. "Oof! Wade, let's, uh, let's go see if we can do anything to help in the kitchen."
"I smelled waffles and came straight here from my hammock," Peter admitted sheepishly. "Which is yours, right? I really don't mind sleeping on the roof if you want to sleep there tonight, I swear."
Strong but gentle hands caught under Tony’s arms and he was lifted up to stand on his feet in the sloshing waves.
Shrinking away from the large green man, Loki just nodded. Where were the other two? Steve and the other Hawkeye were not there as planned. Maybe they went outside too? Whatever the case was, it made for a nice exit. But before he could celebrate too much, they heard the door to the mansion slam open and shut, then several pairs of footsteps headed their way. Loki turned on the couch to see who it was.
Tony took the spatula back grumpily. Of course Steve noticed the sauce was boiling and needed stirring. He was so good at focusing on whatever distraction--WORK was at hand, instead of thinking about their ongoing tangled mess of a relationship. Relationship? Friendship? No word really fit right now. What were they to each other, anyway? "Teammates" sure didn't cut it.
"She's talking about Thor," Peter supplied, hopping to his feet and giving the woman a smile. "Yeah, he left pretty early. I wasn't even awake yet."
“Whoa, whoa. Calm down. We just gotta have Thor adjust the weather! The last thing we wanna do is save them before they talk.”
"I didn't ask you to 'babysit' me," Bruce pointed out, looking tired again. "I honestly have no say in it, though. Maybe if you complained to Director Fury or Stark, something might change." He shrugged. "I can't be more exciting, if that's what you're trying to get at. I'm really pretty boring for somebody who doesn't like astrophysics and gamma radiation research."
"—abundant Chinese food and a garment as Hawkeye has described," Thor concluded to Jarvis. To the two blonds in the cell, he added, "Iron Man is tending to Captain America. The vile Doctor Doom has put him through many horrors, and I am told he is quite unwell!" His heart ached for Cap as he said it.
"Th-they gassed my office," Pepper explained, coughing again. "I feel pretty weak, but...I think I'm okay. Sounds like they got you, too..."
In all the time that he’d known Thor and Loki, he’d never seen them being so civil. No one had been hit by a hammer or flung around by magic yet.
“I’ll do my best, Bruce, but Tony and I had a…disagreement. I’m not sure he’ll want to talk to me. But I’ll try,” Cap told him adamantly.
Bruce should have been laughing by now. That would’ve made Clint sticking his foot in his mouth easier to pass off as a joke, laughter. Instead the brunette went super quiet for what felt like a painfully long time.
Taking a really long sip from his own cup, Clint looked across the bonfire as Bruce was playing with a marshmallow. Then he turned back to Tony and quirked an eyebrow.
“Good morning Peter. Is your uncle awake yet? I wanted to apologize for hitting his nose with that frisbee,” she giggled.
"That is the LAMEST excuse ever!" Deadpool groaned, getting up. "You sneak out all the time—" He paused to yell off to one side. "—Oh, yes he does!"
“Even he had to admit that it looked bad, Steve. I could buy Bruce happening to be around Peter’s camp when he Hulked out, but what about Matt’s cane and glasses? What about Thor saying Bruce was in a bad mood yesterday? How about the dozen trees knocked over up the hill? Come on, all of that adds up to an ugly picture!”
Hawkeye came over and looked more critically at the article, frowning and rubbing his neck. He gestured down to it slowly.
"Uh, yeah." Hawkeye took several steps back. Hopefully Bruce didn't mistake it for a heavier storm and crawl under a log.
"You're right," he said apologetically, "I just didn't want to interrupt his chat with that other guy that came off of the train. Everything been okay while I was gone? Need me to get anything from the grocery store on the way home?"
"Shall I order the Chinese?" Thor stepped over next to the cell and placed a hand on the clear surface, looking at his friends inside. It wasn't right to have to keep friends captive; he hoped they sorted this out soon. One of the Clints had to be false, but they both acted so much like him...
“What, while I wait here? I don’t think so,” Tony declared, resting a hand on his back. He sighed. “I know from experience, Cap, Thor’s gonna see them first anyway from the air. I knew I should’ve brought a suit, just in case…” He didn’t sound like he actually wanted to hop in the Iron Man armor for once, though.
“Hey, you wanna cheat on your obnoxious boyfriend, be my guest. I don’t think I have to tell you that he probably won’t notice.”
“Oh hell yes,” Clint breathed, leaving Bruce on his way to the offerings. Grabbing a couple pancakes and rolling them up, he looked around for a coffee cup while he stuffed them into his mouth.
"Yeah!" Clint agreed. "Let's go save Steve and...me." He rubbed his head. "The Hulk left town for awhile so I don't have to babysit him, right?"
“I really hope this storm isn’t a result of what Thor’s doing at this moment,” the redhead practically shouted over the storm.
He was actually grateful for the fish hook. It had kept him from putting his foot in his mouth about his stupid crush on Bruce.
"You talk pretty big for a guy who has no idea what he's talking about," Tony called after him. "You're telling me you never heard his heart skip a beat around you? I don't buy it."
“Nah, that’s bugs’ spot. I go all over the place! Hell’s Kitchen, Latveria, Japan—you name it, I’ve shot someone there!”
The demigod took a deep breath, thinking the idea over. Thor was in a relationship with that 'Jane' woman right now—would telling him that Clint had feelings for him mess with Doom's plan? That would be fun too. Mischief all around.
“Careful, Wade, he’s bleeding again,” Peter said, looking back at Loki on the surface of the lake. That green glow sure had looked like his magic…
It might have been his Spidey senses, but Peter got the idea from that look that MAYBE Cap was remembering their conversation about him having a boyfriend.
"I-I..." He trailed off dramatically, added a little whimper for effect, and clutched weakly at the front of Steve's shirt.
"We shall find him, friend! And I will keep most careful vigil over Hawkeye," he added to Tony solemnly.
"This isn't happening, then," the blond said. Slowly, he looked back at his friend, frowning despite himself. "Can't you...learn to meditate?"
Thor turned and headed into the mansion without a backward glance, leaving Clint to deal with the Hulk all on his own.
"Um, Tony? Is Miss Potts alright?" He asked, guilty that he had completely forgotten about her. Hopefully, she had gone home to her place and wasn't stuck somewhere in the haunted house that the mansion had become.
“I don't w-want to complain, b-but where is t-that cure?” Steve groaned from the chair he hadn't moved from since they had arrived. In all the fuss over Loki, it seemed like Tony and him had been forgotten.
Pressing a hand to Tony’s back, Cap led him up the steps silently. They couldn’t talk there and the cabin was about to have the entire team camped out inside.
"Bruce won't hurt Hawkeye or Hawkeye," Tony assured Thor, patting him on the shoulder. "C'mon, I need to go see if the person who took three of the Four left any forensic evidence. You'll be my bodyguard."
There went a little flicker of green in his eyes again. What, did straight people make him angry? Wait, was the Hulk gay? It had never occurred to Clint to think of him in a romantic context in the slightest…
Deadpool hopped to his feet, grabbing around Peter's waist from the back and raising a hand to the sky in a salute.
“Hey. We couldn’t just leave this one be,” he pointed out. “I know I sound like Peter when I say it, but we really ARE responsible for Matt while he’s here.”
"Your voice is nearly gone—drink," Doom said, annoyed by his hesitation. "As if DOOM would stoop to poisoning a weakened prisoner. If I want you dead, you will KNOW."
Despite what he'd said, he found himself looking at Clint's wrists in the straps. When he'd gotten back, there were marks on them. Bruce was all too familiar with those kinds of marks. Where had the other Clint gone, anyway?
He fidgeted a little, apparently recalling that neither his nor Steve's conditions could be recreated with science.
"Who is waving red flags?" Thor's deep voice made both men flinch. The big blond was, it turned out, sitting on the couch with a glass of some dark liquid in hand. Tony would assume mead, but he sure hadn't packed any of the stuff...
"You've been in there for days. Babysitting you is mind-numbing!" The archer sighed, moving closer again. "You sit, sleep, and read papers at your desk nonstop. Then if I try to talk to you, all you want to do is go right back to your papers!" The blond hissed, a hint of jealousy slipping into his voice. "I want to go smash up some bad guys. Shoot things. I don't know—anything other than watching you read!" Clint groaned, tossing his hands up for emphasis.
"Okay, but you owe me," Loki said, hissing under his breath. Deadpool followed them happily, much to Loki's disgust. Now he had two people around. But he was beginning to think that being injured could be useful. Despite all of his protesting, he still had a useful amount of control over Dr. Banner. It would be easy to get the Hulk to come out when he finally wanted him to.
“That’s not dumb, Peter,” Cap told him, chuckling a bit. He circled to Peter’s side of the castle and patted the teen’s back. “We can definitely take a picture if you like. It’d be nice to have something on the walls that wasn’t from 70 years ago.”
"You...don't," Peter mumbled, wriggling a little. It was the truth. Deadpool didn't really smell BAD, but it seemed like his distinction between cologne and perfume had been totally lost; he smelled like some lady from a Chanel ad. Weird.
"You're the one who woke me up," the Hulk noted, frowning at Hawkeye. "Banner's all quiet now. Hmph."
"Okay, I really hope he knows you're hitting on him now, or you might be creeping him out." He glanced around to check where everybody else was, and found that Thor had roped Hank and Jan into a two-on-one night beach frisbee game. Thor would probably win against both of them easily, but at least he didn't seem to mind being the third wheel.
Peter put his hands in his pockets, shifting from one foot to the other. He took a deep breath, trying to muster up the guts to pile more lies onto this dumb lie-filled situation, and he just couldn't do it. Cap and Tony had already seemed really sad and bothered by something before Peter brought his concerns in to worry them even more.
"Queensborough Community College," he said, giving Steve and Tony both pleading looks next. "I know it's not some big university, but I-I kind of wanted to stick close to Queens so I could check in on Aunt May, you know?"
“Oh, no,” the woman told him lightly, shaking off the blanket she had thrown over her lounge chair. Lola had tossed a lacy gold cover up over her bikini and had taken her hair down, leaving it to cascade in dark curls over her shoulders as she jammed the blanket into the top of the tote. Clutching the bag to herself, she turned and gave him a tight smile. “I’d hate to be in the way of the frisbee game. I don’t like it when people throw things at me.”
Gawking back at the brown haired man, Clint wasn’t sure what to do. He didn’t ever get to hear Bruce laugh, and he was pretty sure he’d only seen the man smile a grand total of ONCE—not counting the small smirks at irony.
"Secret—NO!" He shook his head. Wait. Wait. If this Clint man was as trampish as it seemed he was, Loki could really throw things up in the air if he led several Avengers on—no! This was Thor. THOR.
When the day had come when the Avengers had to pile into an SUV and try to RELAX, Steve Rogers was struggling with the idea. Tony heard the big blond man plead one more time for the Fantastic Four to call them for any reason before the man finally put the phone down.
“I know you heard most of that call with Matt. I’m guessing one of the reasons you’re here is to report stuff like that to Cap and Tony, right?”
Thor had crossed his arms, and was listening rather seriously to everything they said. He didn't interrupt, though.
“Look, I guess I better just come out and say it,” he said as bravely as he could. Ah, who the hell was he kidding? “I-I kinda like—”
“I’m sorry if I’m being offensive—this is a bit new for me—but I’m surprised how many people are queer around here,” Steve said in bemusement, going back to assembling a s’more. He stuck a marshmallow on a stick and handed it off to Peter. “Well, HE better be nice, then. What’s his name?”
As quiet as he had tried to be, he noticed movement--the redheaded guy rolled over in his blanket and frowned as the penny thumped off Peter’s chest.
As soon as it was behind the tent, Wade stepped over to Peter to take both of his hands, holding them tightly.
Clint stared down at his feet, a look of guilt on his face. Ms. Marvel stood nearby to keep an eye on him, in case he did turn out to be some kind of robot or clone, as she previously stated.
"We are not having a conversation, you pawn," Doom said haughtily, holding up a burning fist. "I am questioning you! If you truly are as WORTHLESS as you convey yourself to be, then there is nothing to do but dispose of you!"
Having spent all night in the cell, both Clints were becoming restless. The one that was wearing PJs kept fidgeting with his blanket, looking around the cell like he might be plotting how to escape. The other man, the shirtless one, paced up and down, arms crossed over his chest. The latter stopped and looked at Thor.
Besides, what was the point? Anyone Steve dated, he would outlive. Especially someone like Tony, who lived a very fast and dangerous lifestyle. The billionaire wasn’t queer, anyway. He was a known flirt and while he and Cap had one picture together in a newspaper, there were hundreds of pictures of Tony with random women.
Apparently, Cap’s frowning at Wade was too distracting to let him see the frisbee on its return flight—it hit him straight in the eye.
"Matt's our friend!" Peter called over, jumping up and sending the frisbee flying straight for Steve's chest.
"Uh, no. Just wondering what's taking you guys so long to check out an abandoned tower. What are you looking at over there? Security footage of empty hallways?" The archer sounded irritated and more than a little stressed.
Eh, Clint thought, smiling. Bruce didn’t have any jiggle and he was awesome. Too bad Clint was going to fall into the sky or he might have gone on a hunt to find his buddy.
“That sounds excellent, thanks,” Matt replied quickly, following the king to the kitchen. “I was starting to wonder if I was the only coffee drinker around.”
“Huh?” Wade turned to look at Peter too, his blue eyes widening with excitement. “Is that Matt?” Darting over, the blond practically bowled Peter over as he started shouting at the phone. “Hey double Ds! Miss you! Smoochies!”
“Well, our camp’s toast, but the sleeping bags should still be okay. Will you guys help me out picking stuff up while I move the tree?” He hadn’t been planning on lifting or moving anything that big while running around out of his Spidey suit, but it was dark right now.
"That was certainly fast! Pay the nice gentleman, Peter, and let's go inside." She stepped out of the cab.
There was a kind of hum overhead as the systems lost power...and the lights quickly faded to blackness. Tony's Arc reactor bathed the room in a cold blue glow, and he was slumped against the wall again, very still.
Loki noticed Bruce as he leaned on the back of the couch more heavily, looking over at Hawkeye to see if he'd found a blanket yet. Hawkeye had apparently tried the bathroom instead, returning with a puffy white towel in hand. He offered it to Bruce with a smile.
“Uh, he was moving kayaks last time I saw him,” Peter offered, looking at Matt curiously. Something was up with him. “How about you check the kayak area and Matt and I will go see if he’s in the house?” Even he didn’t believe that they would actually find Thor indoors if the Prince of Thunder was directing the weather to storm like this, but it gave him a moment alone with Matt to talk.
"Uh, it's n-not important," Cap said quietly, cheeks darkening. He glanced over at Tony shyly. "So, you're que—er, gay? W-what about Miss Potts? I a-assumed that s-she would be Mrs. Stark s-someday."
Bruce really had to wonder why he was doing so, but he stepped into the elevator as well. He moved all the way into one corner, though, and kept his back to the wall so that he could keep an eye on Clint.
"Thor cares about most of us like family, I'm pretty sure," Bruce assured him. He started to stitch the wound carefully. "Not me, but everybody else."
“Okay,” Tony’s voice replied immediately, the irritation in his voice clear for the entire team to hear. “Danger or no, when I say that, you’re supposed to all come charging to my location. Right? Right. That’s how teams work.”
"Race you there," Spider-Man shot back, web-slinging his way over Wade's head—and off through the town. He didn't know where the Hulk was, but usually there were lots of pieces of rubble flying when he appeared, so he was sure he'd find out soon enough. Why was the Hulk on the loose, though? Why weren't the other Avengers keeping an eye on him...?
"You really want the Hulk to go on a rampage again?" Loki didn't back down and simply shook his head. "Real me wouldn’t let that happen."
Clint just reached up and patted Thor's back. After a good long moment, Thor finally let go of him and sat back on the couch, turning his attention back to the movie.
“I could really use some help! I’m a blind dude and I lost something out in the lake, so would you be so kind, oh kind stranger, as to help me find it?”
"Oh, uh..." Bruce sat up and combed his fingers through his hair again. He probably looked like kind of a wreck...he hadn't stopped this project to shave in a couple days, either. And food? That hadn't even occurred to him.
Slipping into his room stealthily, Clint rummaged through his suitcase of clothes. He had purposely brought every loud piece of clothes he owned, with logos and colors so bright they burned the corneas.
Wiping at his wet hair again, Peter called uncertainly, “Sorry, is Thor in there? I need to talk to him.”
Usually this was the point where he would roll to his feet, pull his shield, and shout something heroic. As he slammed into the wall face-first, Steve reached for his shield only to realize that he wasn't wearing it. Giving up, he crawled to his feet to look down the hall, wobbling and coughing into his hand.
"You know, pneumonia doesn't sound that fun anymore," Clint said softly. "Maybe we should..." He trailed off.
Stuffing a handful of trail mix into his mouth, Clint stared at Peter, daring him to ask a question now.
Lola, who had followed Thor into the cabin and had thankfully put on her lacy cover up, was giving Peter her full attention with big green eyes.
Cap and Tony were right about him and the Hulk—them being together would be a STUPID idea. Idiotic and irrational and-and…kinda hot.
"He says whatever it is will be more fun than fishing," the scientist relayed with a sigh, brown eyes avoiding Clint's. He glanced over at the door like maybe he was planning to dash for it. "Usually he sleeps while I fish, but he can't sleep for a week, so he's not exactly broken up about leaving my tackle box behind."
"I think you mean 'day before yesterday.' You've been in there awhile." Clint reached over and tried to smooth out a wrinkle in Bruce's shirt, but it was in vain. The creases were probably permanent by now.
Steve didn't look at all well, though, and he had this really bad feeling from the way Clint kept looking at him that there was probably more to this whole thing than met the eye.
"He'll be f-fine," Cap told, crawling to his feet. "A distraction is just w-what we need. We have to buy time for Tony to find us." He looked at her with determination. "We can't let h-his sacrifice b-be in vain."
“Dammit,” Clint grumbled, sticking his fingers into the bloody spot and grimacing. “They don’t make stitches like they used to.”
Tony had to give the guy credit, he didn’t seem to be intimidated in the slightest by the Avengers co-leaders knowing he was dating their teenage sort-of-son. He poured two cups of black coffee and held one out for Matt.
Loki paused in his speech, wriggling his hands. He looked up at Bruce, who had burning green eyes. Loki had seen those eyes before!
"Okay, the signal's coming from the middle of the castle, probably down in some dungeon straight out of medieval Europe," Tony told Carol nonchalantly, hovering to point—as if 'middle of the castle' wasn't clear enough or something.
Bruce sat up from where he'd been kind of shoved to the side, still holding onto the pieces of gauze. He sighed and got to his feet.
"Aunt May, it's freezing cold out here," he said as theatrically as he could. "Let me call us a cab, we shouldn't walk home in the rain!"
"What? Are we a couple?" Thor looked a bit alarmed, and rather apologetic. "When you told me last week that I gave the best hugs of anyone, I had thought you only intended a compliment!"
"Yeah, and cooperation means telling me how you got the Hulk to visit twice in one night!" Tony added, smirking.
Something went clattering past his feet, spinning and washing away in the water. Just as Peter realized that it was Clint’s bow, the archer rocketed past him—also spinning.
Doom snickered in his sinister way again. Clint wondered if he always laughed like that. Did he laugh like that when he was a little kid blowing out his birthday candles, too? Or playing with puppies? ...Puppies were probably too scared to approach even a tiny Doom.
"Hey, don't hurt each other. This whole stitches situation started because you were fighting," he sighed.
"The Hulk went on two rampages yesterday—BOTH because of me." He stepped closer, shrugging. "He's usually under control, except for yesterday, when he was going berserk." The archer stared at him. "Is he going to throw me through a wall when he comes back?"
“Is the sauce done? The sauce is done!” Wade came barging into the kitchen, pulling plates down from the cabinets so fast that he almost dropped them.
Or his pulse could go up, and he could smash the sandwich shop before they got a chance to make an order at last...
Clint plunked down and held on, grinning at the sloshing waves as they broke over the Hulk’s massive form. The day wasn’t over yet after all. The air was cooling off and Hulk was finally around.
"Tch, fine," Hawkeye grumbled from nearby. Loki could almost feel the man’s scowl burning into his back, but the woozy lightness in his head made it okay.
“A splendid idea,” Thor said cheerfully, holding up his hand. Mjolnir came flying to it in seconds, and Thor wrapped an arm around Loki’s waist. “Now I can truly show you the sights of Midgard.” Whirling the magic hammer in the air, he called to the others, “We shall see thee again at the mansion, friends!”
Hawkeye sat shivering at the kitchen table, wrapped up in a long wool blanket. He looked to be wearing a pair of flannel black and gray striped pajamas, but was still shaking.
“WHAT?” The purple hooded Avenger laughed, glancing back up at the Hulk. “Are you SERIOUS? Come on, Tony! Like we’d ever…you know!”
Deadpool came bursting out of the bushes at the edge of the camp. He was dressed in loud red swimming trunks with an image of Spider-Man printed across the hip.
Reading the sign, Clint dropped a twenty dollar bill on the counter of the stand. The perky looking high school kid attendant hurried to get them a metal detector, smiling at Clint with big sparkly eyes.
"Y-you really kissed the Hulk?" Bruce asked quietly, smiling despite himself. "No wonder he's embarrassed."
“Bruce is gonna fish, and probably drag Thor into fishing. Think I’d rather catch up on my beauty sleep.”
"Which made sense, because when it got caught in the zipper, it hurt like hell," Deadpool finished, stepping in after her. He immediately turned to stare at Tony, going silent.
"It says Stark, Spidey! Why in the hell would it say 'steak?'" Deadpool snorted, waving his arms as he spoke.
"Ah, sorry." He continued on down the hall to the elevator, pressing the button calmly. Above the elevator door, the lights slowly ticked down from the mansion top floor. Clint sighed.
As Loki was about to reply, he noticed Hawkeye glance back at Thor, then dart away down the hall. Loki quirked an eyebrow, watching the mortal dash off before he turned his attention back to Thor.
"No I didn't," Deadpool said, rubbing his head again. "Really? Well that's just...stupid." He continued to himself. "Because it said steak the first time!" He told no one in particular, glancing to the side and waving a hand to dismiss the thought. "Tch." Seemingly resolving his one sided argument, he turned back to Peter. "Whatever."
Realizing both that Daredevil could probably still hear him and that he was alone in the room with Cap now, Tony turned and started rummaging through his suitcase for clothes that weren't pajamas.
"Twins. Neat. He went that way." Deadpool pointed off down the hall toward the living room. "And hot stuff went that way." He pointed back behind him, in the direction of the medical room. "Hey, you guys know where Spidey is?"
Thor felt too obvious, but it was certainly what the people wanted. Hawkeye was a waste of his time and the Hulk was just unrealistic. There was no way that monster had a mind for romance.
He put a hand over his heart like that might keep it from pounding as he thought back on their conversation on the bench. It was a good thing he was so exhausted right now—he probably couldn't muster up any adrenaline to transform at the moment.
"Geez, stop dragging your feet—I meant outside of the ROOM. How long has it been since you slept?" Clint led the way through the hall, hands tucked casually in his pockets.
The green giant offered no explanation; in fact, he downright ignored Loki's question and headed for the kitchen. Lightning sizzled above them, and there was a sudden deafening rise in volume as rain flooded down onto the roof of the mansion. Thor probably had something to do with weather this bad.
What a waste of a day, Bruce thought tiredly, balancing his dinner plate on one hand while he circled the couch to find an open spot. Why did the mansion only have two couches? Maybe it was because the Hulk kept throwing them at the TV when he got annoyed by commercials.
"Still. It had to be boring," Loki sighed. "Why are we going downstairs?" He didn't know exactly where the archer's room was, but he did know that it was upstairs.
Bruce glanced sidelong at the blond, trying not to look as awkward as he felt. Clint was definitely not acting normal...and he was beginning to put the pieces together.
Turning to Hulk, Clint looked up at his friend and sighed. It was getting dark and Bruce was probably going to insist that he and Hulk take off into the woods again. Clint hated the idea. Maybe he could convince Hulk to take him along and let him sleep on his back or something?
"Um. No?" Peter smiled sheepishly at him. "You have a whole recipe for these, huh?" He knew meatballs generally had bread crumbs or something in them, but he'd never made them at home. Wow, Cap really could cook if he had the recipe memorized!
"This's awful..." Pepper sat down on the floor, leaning against the bars and sighing heavily. "Do you think he wants Thor for the same...reason?" She coughed lightly.
He shrugged a little and sat back to pick items out of the first aid kit again. Needles and thread, medical tape, ointment. “I think you once said your bow’s more of an Avenger than me. And you’re sort of right. I certainly can’t take credit for Hulk’s accomplishments.”
“Actions?” Clint asked drolly, crossing his arms and leaning on the door frame. “We’re playing cards.”
"I don't know if I can," Steve answered without thinking, looking up at the hole as well. “It's not easy to save someone from themselves.” Turning around a corner in the hall, the blond man shook his head. “But now that I've thought about us being more—married, even—I can't stop wondering if it could happen.”
"Hm," Steve managed, already drifting off. His eyes fell closed. The blankets were very nice. But...wait. Why wasn't Tony checking on Clint? He had been there too. The archer had helped Cap pull everyone out of the building. Fighting off forming dreams, Cap forced his eyes open again, grabbing Tony's shoulder. "Wait."
"They're green again, aren't they. I-I'm not angry, they also do this when I'm...hurt." He combed his fingers through his hair a bit shakily.
With a roll of thunder, the rain suddenly went from ‘pitter-patter’ status to ‘downpour.’ Peter glanced at the sky as if it had chosen that particular moment on purpose and shook his head, trudging along with Clint. “You don’t think they’d have a problem with two guys together, do you? Because I know they wouldn’t.”
"You seem a lot less excited about this than you did a minute ago," he observed. With a small sigh, he added, "I know I'm not Hulk, but you'll get to spend weeks with him once we're back from this vacation. You're not obligated to spend the whole trip with me, either, if you don't want to."
Johnny, who had been quietly poking through everything in their kitchen, raised his head at the mention of pizza and gave Peter a thumbs up.
"I yield, I yield!" Thor laughed, dusting more sand out of the scientist's hair. "The battle was well-fought, and victory is yours."
1: In this chapter, Bruce says he's not present as himself often. This might sound like melodramatic exaggeration if you're used to MCU Bruce, who gets to be Bruce form very often, but EMH Bruce really isn't himself much. In the EMH cartoon, he actually has a deal with the Hulk to only be in Bruce form for one day per month, and to let Hulk stay in Hulk form otherwise.
"Tony said that he scanned magic on both of you," Bruce said, looking between the two of them thoughtfully. He was VERY calm now. It was actually a bit weird, he didn't seem to react to anything either of them said. He looked down at the arrow and injury. "For a stab wound, you don't seem to be bleeding much, either."
Tony smiled at her, encouraged that at least SOMEBODY was having the reaction people usually had to a gorgeous beach getaway and freedom from work for a full week. He handed her the key to the other cabin.
The rain had let up for awhile, turning to a light sprinkle. Clint held around Thor's neck, scanning the forest below them as they went.
The chemical smoke had a lingering effect; he could barely speak. Whatever was in that bomb, it must have been specially made to work on him, as no normal gas would. Cap looked around the cell. There was some dirt along the walls, otherwise it was stripped of anything useful.
"D-do you—" Steve stared down at her. “Do you think the public would be angry at the Avengers...if I asked Tony to m-marry me? I know that it's not the ‘40s anymore, but...” Trailing off to a mumble, he continued along the hallway, unsure what he thought he was doing.
“It’s not—” Steve began, eyes locked on the tiny card as it spun farther out of his reach. Resting a hand over one of Tony’s on his shoulder, Steve steadied himself. He’d already decided not to tell Tony how he felt. Handing him a letter felt easier, less wounding. As if Tony scoffing at his carefully written words would be easier to endure…
"Yeah, well one's got to be a fake," Tony said pointedly. "'Til we get the other back here and compare them, you've got babysitting duty—don't let him out of your sight while we're gone, got it?"
"Thank y-you." Sometimes it was hard to get through Tony's dodgy sarcasm, but he was the best friend Steve had had in the present century.
"Yeah. I heard he got out," Loki mumbled. Undoubtedly through some devious activities. Glancing up at Bruce shyly, he smiled. "Did my clone do it?"
