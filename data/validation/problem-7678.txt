‘Quiet, Sergeant,’ Rumlow snaps and glares at Bucky, ‘we’ll discuss this later.’
‘Oh save it, kid. Is it Matt you want to speak to or Daredevil?’
‘And Harry being?’
‘He’s out at the moment visiting the guys at the base Wanda does her demonstrations at,’ Steve tells him. ‘You could wait till after dinner to speak to him, or ask Tony.’ He detects a hint of sympathy in the Captain’s voice.
‘Ooo kinky,’ he laughs, ‘might I suggest you find some other use for my mouth then, my dear Captain?’ He can’t deny the heat that spreads through his body at Steve’s sharp intake of breath, and before he can register the fact they’re moving he’s on his back on the bed and Steve is leaning over him. ‘Nuh uh,’ he says, flipping Steve onto his back.
‘How can a shape be fun?’ Drax asks.
‘Don’t even think about saying that’s not where you were going,’ Natasha cuts off whatever Sam is about to say. ‘Because we all know you were.’
‘September?’
‘You’ve got a flight booked for tomorrow evening,’ Hill says, sliding a packet with flight tickets in across the table. ‘We’ve booked you into a hotel for tonight so you can rest and join the others tomorrow. Someone will meet you once you land and take you to where the team are staying during the talks.’
‘Well I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it,’ Wanda crosses her arms and leans against the wall next to the couple, ‘and if we’re so worried about age gaps how come no one’s saying anything about Steve being about sixty years older than Tony?’ Loki just about manages to stifle a laugh.
And of course, as always, here's your sneak peek:

‘Alright, we’ll try. You think you can manage it?’
‘Dr Banner?’
‘-Matt Murdock,’ he replies, taking her hand with no problem, Peter sees her raise her eyebrows in surprise and shares a look with Loki. ‘I believe you’ve been asking after me Agent Romanoff.’
‘Why not?’ he asks, then ducks as Wanda’s alarm clock comes flying towards the back of his head.
‘Stop acting like a dad waiting up for their daughter to get back,’ Bucky laughs as he checks his phone yet again.
Yes Wade…now please use your inside voice…
‘They said they did,’ he growls. ‘Scott do you want to stay here till we find him?’
Valkyrie looks to Thor and blinks. ‘Uh…that was easy? We need to finish our drinks first.’
look.
Before Steve can answer Rhodes raises an eyebrow at them. ‘Really? I’m going to pretend you didn’t ask that.’
‘Mr Stark, calm down,’ the Chinese representative cuts in, then turns to Ross. ‘Secretary Ross does not speak for the rest of us, he is merely expressing his own opinions. As for the agreement, it still stands as it was signed by every member here and agreed by the President. You must also understand that, when you come to us with a black eye, we have reason to question whether James Barnes really is going to be healed in the time you say.’
‘So, you two got on like a house on fire then,’ Hope grins.
need that drink in order to make this call, he grabs the phone from the table and flips it open. Bringing up the contacts he just sees one name.
‘She used to come visit a lot when I was younger,’ Tony replies, apparently talking to the table rather than any of the room’s occupants. ‘But we didn’t talk much after my parents died. The last time I saw her was at their funeral.’
‘So can I make a request?’ Peter says as he and Matt dodge some shruikens that lodge themselves in the wall behind them.
Sam realises Quill has fallen behind and turns around to find out where the space captain has gone. He sees him standing by a small tree, it’s rather sparse and is nothing like the ones they’ve been looking at before. In fact its more like the ones they’ve all simply walked past before.
‘Hey! Feeling offended here!’ Tony calls from the other end of the table.
‘When I stop looking like a nightmare
‘Then what-’
They continue to bounce ideas, some serious and some not, and Tony lets his head fall back against the sofa. He closes his eyes for a moment when they start to sting.
Loki laughs. ‘Neither was mine. Sleep well, Lorena. I am glad the first trip to Jotunheim went so well, I will admit I was expecting a disaster.’
‘You’re really not as subtle as you think, Happy.’
‘Uh, yeah no sorry I got syrup to watch,’ Peter points to the pan on the stove in front of him. ‘And I gave up trying to control his crazy side a
‘Not helping,’ he grumbles and moves to the table. Peter takes a couple of steps back and goes to lean against the wall watching the game, letting the two of them talk over the table. He’s pleasantly surprised at how quickly they do relax around each other, and by the time they’ve finished their game he’s not feeling quite so terrible at having ambushed Wade with the surprise visit from his super-sister.
‘Couple of days,’ Tony responds, ‘hence why Pete was staying with Ned last night. Meant he didn’t have to do the longer journey in to school today, apparently they also had a project due in and it meant he could go on patrol after school and still have time to get it done.’ He claps his hands and rubs them together. ‘Alright you three what do we need to do to celebrate Yule?’

‘Practical,’ and Tony swears he sees a small smile on Nebula’s face. He sees Wanda helping Mantis in a similar way, the alien is not quite so steady on her feet as Nebula is.
His response is a nod. ‘Ironic isn’t it?’
‘Tony? What’s happened?’ Clint asks.
And here's your sneak peek:
She wraps an arm around his waist. ‘Not letting us look out for you, little brother. And not thinking you’re good enough.’

‘That’s the best you can come up with? Care to explain why Spider-Man is walking around as an intern?’ the man growls. ‘You trying to sell me out to the Avengers? Was our invite just some elaborate plan to track me down? Because I told you before I’ve no interest in joining the superhero squad.’
Tony watches as if in a trance as the tyres are blown and the car swerves off the road; only dimly does he hear his father’s surprised question of recognition. When he sees memory-Bucky move towards his mother, however, he has to close his eyes. Yet through everything, even the sound of the gunshot that takes his mother’s life, he stands just behind the soldier, a hand on his shoulder. As the memory fades around them Wanda and Vision continue to work.
‘Where are you guys?’
‘I’m in the seats a few rows behind Tony next to Rhodey,’ Wanda responds.
‘I’m offended you don’t think I’m just looking innocent because I
‘Don’t worry, Nat. Me and Stevie just need a little heart to heart,’ he tells the spy, metal hand gripping Steve’s shoulder painfully tight as he steers him towards the balcony area outside the double doors.
They’re all gathering in and around the common area, laughing around mugs of steaming hot drinks and tucking in to snacks that have been placed on all the available surfaces. Peter notices Wade has stepped outside and goes to follow him when Natasha catches him arm and gives a small shake of her head.
‘He’s rigged the building!’ Bucky yells, trying to dash around the crates as Francis holds up a detonation device.
‘What time is it?’ Tony says, still refusing to move from his cocoon of super-soldier arms.
Natasha watches as Tony’s eyes go wide and he tries to struggle against the guard as he reaches down and rips the shirt the inventor is wearing.
‘NO!’ the raw scream that leaves Peter’s throat does nothing to stop his heart breaking in his chest. The teenager reaches them, letting the mask of his new suit fall away and looking at Tony with such a look of utter terror that makes Steve feel even more helpless. ‘You can’t give up now. Please,’ the teenager sobs. Then he looks up as Steve feels another presence near them. ‘Doc please get me a portal to the facility. I can get a spare reactor! We can save him!’
‘You alright, Agent Romanoff?’
‘Of course, it has. I leave nothing to chance,’ he responds, placing the file on his desk without reading it.
He opens his mouth to shout, and inhales warm water. Closing his eyes, he thrashes around, trying to throw off the ghostly hands that are pushing him down. Phantom sparks of electricity dart across his chest, reminding him to protect the battery. If the battery stops he’s dead from shrapnel. His hands reaches to his chest, but the reactor’s gone.
‘Because it’s entertaining?’
‘We knew the risks,’ Tony argues.
‘I agree,’ an accented voice says from the doorway.
‘And I told you,’ Tony says, landing between Hammer and Peter, ‘that if you even touched one hair on his head I’d rip you five new ones.’
? Why?’
Steve laughs. ‘Apparently this was only a part of the leftovers. It’s supposed to keep them going for the next week so they can spend time with family and friends and not have to worry about work.’
The man raises an eyebrow at him, and Steve would have sworn the guy was trying not to laugh at him.  ‘I work in R&D I’m sure I’ll be able to help, or at least speak to someone who can. Who are you anyway?’
‘It’s alright I need to see Mr Murdock,’ he says. ‘No offence meant, Mr Nelson.’
Bucky regains consciousness and he and Wanda manage to communicate with the team.
When they sever the connection Bucky looks over at Steve. ‘Buck? What’s wrong?’
A/N: Hope you enjoyed the double update this week. I'd love to know what you think about Wanda being the first member of the team to learn about the relationship between Peter and Wade.
parts of Peter’s life and accepts it. And he’s not going to do anything over PG13 until Peter’s of age.’
‘They drew,’ Steve laughs along with his best friend. ‘Never did find out what happened to Monty after he left the Commandos, but I knew he died before I was found.’ Bucky’s gone quiet next to him, rolling his water bottle between his hands. ‘Buck? What’s up?’
‘Sister Margaret’s? Peter asks.
She turns to him with an eyebrow raised. ‘Are you actually going to stand back and let me handle the technology?’
Rhodes goes to start warming it as soon as they get back while Vision helps Wanda take her things to her room. The two of them walk into the kitchen to Rhodes bodily throwing Tony out with orders to lay the table, and explaining his reasons to a giggling Wanda as they plate up.
‘Fury said he was from an alternate reality, right? Like Wade is?’ he’s very aware how desperate his voice sounds but he can’t help it.
‘But she doesn’t blame Bucky for that. I know her well enough to know she wouldn’t blame someone else for her actions without
‘It’s just Sam,’ the man chuckles, ‘I assume you’re the infamous Ned that Peter keeps talking about?’
‘You know most kids my age worry about spending their summer holiday either trying to find a girlfriend or hook up with some hot European girl. I get to wonder if someone’s going to try and get me to give them what my assassin cross superhero friend owes them. Wonderful,’ he sighs.
as well, Peter. And by trying to push it so much you’ll be telling him you don’t respect him enough to respect
‘Who was it?’ Steve asks.
turn up, and we want to know what’s bothering our teammate. You’re obviously spooked about something, which is one of the reasons you didn’t want Pete coming along, despite knowing he’s right and he would have been very useful on this mission. And anyway I know you’re not the type to start getting paranoid over nothing. If you think there’s something that’s potentially dangerous to him, don’t you think we’d want to know to help you keep him safe?’
When they’re settling down for the movie later Peter finds himself taking the seat next to Natasha instead of his usual spot on the floor next to Tony. Bucky just settles down on the floor next to Sam without a word and Peter can’t help but curl up against the red-haired assassin. After his outburst earlier he kind of misses when he and May would curl up to watch films, usually when he was missing his parents when they were on one of their business trips and Uncle Ben was out working.
‘No I’ve got something else I need to do before I see you,’ he says, heading towards the subway. ‘I might lose you, Wade, I’m going into the subway.’
‘Yes, Justin Hammer will be in the accused’s box. We will be seated with Mr Stark in front of the public benches, and we’ve made sure the first two rows behind us are reserved exclusively for use by members of the Avengers.’
Loki sighs and nods. ‘It…I honestly can’t remember what started it. The three of us were talking normally and then a comment was made by someone that I let a stray thought about slip through the link. Barnes then responded to it and before I knew what was happening we were trading insults through the link and,’ he pauses and looks down at the glass in his hands, ‘we weren’t being as careful as we should have been and were picking up on hints through the link on what could hurt the other. I…I made some references to his time with HYDRA and he…he made some references to my past as well.’
‘Buck we’ve been waiting ten minutes. Leave the poor kid alone.’
‘Are you telling me they hit on you?’ she demands, pausing as they reach the bottom of the stairs with her hands on her hips and a hard look on her face.
‘T’Challa!’ he hears Okoye shout. Looking over to see the king kneeling next to Nakia’s prone form as soldiers bear down on him.
Really it’s sickening how much Steve has him wrapped around his finger. He really should do something about that.
Strange sits up, eyes narrowing. ‘Did they find more than they were looking for?’
‘Sam and Rhodey are on their way back from taking Wanda and Vision to New York. Peter was on a video call to May when I left him to come phone you. Bruce is reassuring the Asgardians. Nick’s off doing whatever it is he’s doing right now. Wade’s still on his job.’
‘Yeah we’re still waiting for the next insect to appear,’ Bucky laughs, ruffling Peter’s hair as the teenager grumbles.
‘There you go then,’ Tony says as if they’ve just found the meaning of life. ‘I mean I wouldn’t have blamed you for shooting my dad, God knows I wanted to a couple of times. But you didn’t
‘Nice to meet you properly, kid,’ Steve says, holding out his hand.
Oh yeah that’s all he needs, the Winter Soldier storming his school to come find him. ‘Sorry Mr Stark, I didn’t mean to keep you wait-’
‘Well,’ Sam unclips his seatbelt and opens his door, ‘we’ve all got axes this time and we’ve got a
‘Not really.’
‘Well I’m not quite
‘Of course, Sergeant Barnes,’ the female voice responds and the workshop goes dim.
‘That and you just want to see him,’ he rolls his eyes, then takes out his phone when it pings with a new message.
‘There’s a sofa over there we can put him on,’ he tells Steve, pointing to a space behind him and walking over to grab a pillow and blankets. ‘He has it here for power naps.’
‘I think Rhodey’s working on him now,’ she says as Sam runs off to fetch his wings. ‘Here take a look at what we need to put up, we need as many fliers as possible.’
‘Ajax,’ Francis frowns. ‘The name is Ajax, little spider.’ Peter grinds his teeth at the nickname but says nothing. ‘And I want to make one little stipulation of my own.’
Rhodes shakes his head. ‘If I know Tony he’s still got it somewhere. But anyway, for much of his childhood you were his idol, his one way of being close with his dad.’ Rhodes looks sad and he sighs. ‘Then he started acting out as a teenager, getting drunk underage at parties, arguing with his dad. He just wanted some kind of attention from Howard that was all about him, I think, that was Howard acknowledging him as his son and wanting to spend time with him because of that and not because of a long-lost friend he was still desperately trying to find with every spare second he had.’
‘Panicked,’ Peter repeats. ‘What the hell did you need to panic for?’
‘Show no mercy,’ Loki answers for them, his eyes flickering between red and green. On hearing what had happened with Wanda the brothers had returned from the UN, apparently T’Challa had wanted to come but Nakia had convinced him it was better to continue the battle in the UN. According to Thor the king had not been amused.
‘Sure thing, Cap,’ he replies.
‘I can’t wash them,’ Tony says eventually, holding up his hands but still not looking up at Steve. ‘I can’t wash them, Steve, because if I wash them I’m washing the last bit of him away and I can’t do it.’
worry about getting everything rolling.’
Loki looks up at Thor as the blond sits next to him. ‘They are taking Bucky for another session, I need to prepare to bring him through to protect his mind, Thor. Can we have this conversation another time?’
‘No it’s fine, I’ll let him know I’ll pick him up from school.’
‘Of course,’ Wong agrees, ‘but what of the talks you need to have here?’
‘Aww, Peter’s in love,’ she cackles. Then calms down. ‘In all seriousness I’m happy for you,’ she smiles at him, ‘I haven’t seen you this happy talking about someone ever really. If he makes you happy then I’m happy. But I still want to meet him so he knows what’s going to happen if he hurts you.’
‘But there’s still a chance and, as we’ve proven already, all we need is one chance right?’
Laying the groundwork for his distraction to get Bucky out should the need arise. Which was looking more likely.
‘It’s not pretty, Baby Boy,’ Deadpool warns him.
‘That would depend on the content,’ Vision’s calm voice responds. ‘However I assume you are referring to a recording of this particular exchange, so I would say no more than twenty minutes.’
‘No,’ he says, ‘it’s not a boy.’
having this discussion,’ comes the firm reply. ‘I’m not letting Tony anywhere near something resembling work until he is out of the hospital wing, is that understood?’
‘Thanks, Jones,’ Tony says, gesturing for Steve to follow him.
Peter then moves to the war, not focussing too much on Steve’s transformation, but instead on the research he’d done on Bucky’s activities when he was in the army, up to being taken prisoner in Azzano. Then came the stories of the Howling Commandos, for once not focussing on Steve’s part in the missions, but Bucky’s; Peter doesn’t linger too much on the mission on the train, and tries not to talk too much about his time with HYDRA, talking about what was necessary but not trying to pretend that Bucky hadn’t been one of their best assassins. Steve is impressed though as, although everything that Peter says is factual, he manages to tell a sympathetic story, bringing in research he’d done on brainwashing and some of the methods used.
‘So mean to me, Baby Boy,’ Wade pouts again, then he reaches up and pushes his mask up to his nose.
Peter starts to open up to Tony about his new relationship, but they're interrupted by some unexpected visitors.
‘You going to tell me the story?’
together. You know what I mean?’
‘And what are you thinking about at,’ Steve pauses to look over at the clock, ‘half past five in the morning?’
‘Why don’t we play a game here then?’ Steve suggests, stepping towards the others.
‘Exactly like that. When the syrup is ready we lay them in a container and cover the fruit with it and leave it to soak until the feast. The taste surprisingly good for how easy they are to make.’
Strange fixes him with a hard look. ‘That was uncalled for.’
‘Would I?’ Deadpool asks, grin obvious beneath his mask.
‘Boss?’ FRIDAY cuts across them. ‘You might want to see this. News footage from London.’
of persuasion for the committee to allow it; and the two of them had had several conversations to make sure that any conditions put in place were only what she was comfortable with.
‘That’s…equal parts scary and impressive,’ Wade says.
now the Scarlet Witch.’
‘You know what I think?’ he muses after a couple of moments. ‘They say the people closest to you are the ones that hurt you most, because they know
‘When you’re ready, Wong,’ Tony says, firing up his chest reactor. ‘Pete how you doing with Strange?’
Bucky is genuinely surprised how easily the Jotuns appear to accept Loki as their king; though he thinks a lot of it has to do with the three who are at the facility so much, and the fact that apparently their last king was a bit of a tyrant. From what he’s gathered the previous king was almost forced into the ceremonial duel by the rest of his people as they were hoping both brothers would kill each other and they could appoint someone else as king.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Just like your story you mean?’ Fury counters.
‘Yeah, yeah,’ Tony waves him off, ‘you’ve already spilt most of it, Rhodey.’
‘Yay! Swing!’ Cooper laughs. ‘Higher! Higher!’
‘Rocket doesn’t manage to get me to join his schemes. Uncontrollable-stage Tony did.’
‘Merry Christmas, Rhodey.’
Bucky feels shame pooling in his gut and looks to the side, nodding. ‘Yes, and I’m sor-’
‘Why would I want to kidnap you?’ Steve asks, wondering who on earth he’s managed to stumble into. The guy is clearly a bit strange.
The man’s eyes narrow and he crosses his arms. ‘Ok first: how the fuck do you know Deadpool? And second: what the fuck would you want with one of our craziest bastards?’
‘Are you ready?’
‘Kid? Learn to take a compliment,’ Tony says from behind Wanda.
‘They’ll be fine,’ Sam reassures him. ‘Takes more than a couple of soldiers to bring down Tony and Peter.’
‘Well I see you chose America’s golden boy after all,’ Justin Hammer says from where he’s handcuffed to a table. They’ve kept him at the facility until they have all the information they need from him, and from the files they took from the complex. There’s a lot to get through.
reality?’
‘What happened?’ Rhodes asks, taking his glass. ‘I don’t think I’ve seen you this tired since the time you had a crazy puzzle decorating your neck.’
‘Kind of feel like I’d rather be on the battlefield,’ the soldier grumbles.
‘Let me guess you want someone to pick it apart with afterwards?’ Ned says with a smile.
‘Oh thank god.’
‘Come on, Guy in the Chair. Let me introduce you properly.’
‘As long as it’s a double,’ Tony replies, eyes closing, ‘and you got me a large order of fries.’
‘If there’s trouble let us know and we’ll come help. I’m hoping it’s just he’s been held up with unimportant stuff, but if they’ve been attacked again then call it in,’ Natasha calls as he walks towards the portal.
‘I didn’t say you’d get annoyed I said you wouldn’t be happy with what anyone else did,’ Steve interrupts him.
‘Be serious, Stark!’ Ross thunders.
‘What’s happened to Tony?’ Bruce looks worriedly at his friend.
‘She’ll come round,’ Peter shrugs, picking up some of the boxes, ‘she just doesn’t want to admit she’s looking forward to some fun.’
‘But it wasn’t his fault,’ Steve says, mouth dry as he forces the words out.
‘Pete, why don’t you stop flirting with Wade and get the doc a hot chocolate? He looks like he needs it,’ Tony says. The teen scrambles to do what he suggests, and then takes a seat next to Strange and brings him into a discussion about the Yule preparations, obviously trying to distract him from the pain he’s feeling.
Strange blinks at him, then looks down at the watch on his wrist. ‘Oh. Apologies I must have become more engrossed than I realised. Do take a seat.’ When Peter fails to follow the order he clears his throat. ‘Care to take a seat and stop staring at my library?’
‘You sure you ain’t just being paranoid?’ Sam raises an eyebrow at her. ‘I mean we have literally got the entirety of the world’s press here.’
‘No need to apologise. Here, follow me, the others want you to wait over here.’
He rolls his eyes and opens his mouth to retort when a voice behind him beats him to it.
Wade has a confession to make.
They teased each other, and Natasha, all the way through and sometimes the two of them would end up laughing so hard they couldn’t do any of the moves and Natasha would look at them with a mixture of fondness and exasperation until they’d calmed down enough to carry on. Wanda also found she was doing much better now she had someone to compare and compete against.
‘I’m not sure. As long as I can have.’
Peter looks between the two of them, mouth hanging open. ‘But…I…but…’ something snaps inside of him and he feels the tears pouring down his face, hot and shameful. He buries his face in his hands, fingers digging into his scalp.
‘Why not? You seem to be so worried about a bunch of school kids doing irreparable damage but it’s perfectly fine for you to hold back in training so then when we
‘Welcome to my world, Cap. Now you see why I’m getting so many grey hairs?’ Tony shouts. Steve’s response is lost to the game.
‘They’re arriving now,’ Fury confirms for her, and Bucky looks up to see several quinjets arriving and beginning to fire into the oncoming hordes.
The smirk on Peter’s lips tests every inch of self-control Wade possesses. ‘Think you can keep up?’
‘Too damn right,’ Steve growls.
Tony sets Steve down then flies towards Thanos. ‘Hey! Ugly!’ Thanos turns and knocks him to the side, sending him spiralling as he attempts to right himself. ‘Dammit,’ he curses as he loads up his repuslors. ‘Get off my friend you overgrown action toy.’
‘Well since you are practically vibrating with pent up energy,’ Bucky laughs, and Peter realises how much he’s fidgeting and tries to stand still, ‘why don’t you go suit up and go do some training inside while this lot is distracted? We’ll tell them Tony called you in to help with something.’
‘Hey guys this is my good friend Deadpool,’ he says as the red clad mercenary comes into view. ‘And he has never had better timing.’
to focus on,’ Rhodes is arguing, ‘you can’t keep him away from work forever.’
There’s a few moments of silence, and Peter doesn’t dare look up. He has a feeling he’s messed things up between them big time and he’s not sure what to do to fix things.
‘Peter?’ the teenager screeches to a halt and turns to look back at his mentor. ‘No more of the titles this holiday, alright? We’re all on first name basis.’
‘For the love of God put him through, FRIDAY,’ Clint says, ‘someone needs to calm him down.’
‘Sam apparently doesn’t trust me not to cheat,’ Bucky shrugs, ‘Rhodey said he’s already lost more than enough money at poker-’
‘I can’t,’ he says, zipping his bag back up and handing it to his friend. ‘I need to help the Avengers keep everyone safe. It’s my fault they came here, I need to help fix it.’
But he doesn’t answer, he just begins to drag her along the corridor and up the flight of stairs where he’s always disappeared from her sight before. Wanda tries reaching into his mind, to see if she can think of a way to get through to him, but what she sees terrifies her. There’s nothing in his mind except his orders.
‘I’m sorry what?’ Tony blinks.
Peter tries to blink away the tears under his mask. ‘Thank you.’
‘Ok then,’ Scott wonders if he’s hit his head harder than he thought during his flight. ‘So…what do we do now?’
The man stands up and studies him. ‘Tell me everything.’
‘You’re welcome, Thor,’ Steve says, clapping the god on the shoulder, ‘keep yourself safe and hurry back.’
‘You’re not allowed to leave for such a long time ever again,’ the man states.
‘Yeah but he deserves to be an internet sensation,’ he laughs, ‘especially since he put that together with no help from any of us. He didn’t even do a practise run through with me.’
‘I’m dreaming,’ Bucky mumbles, ‘I’ve actually lost it from all the meds.’
Tony sighs. ‘I underestimated him before and treated him like a little child, and it nearly got him killed. But he got through it on his own merits and, so far, has been making pretty mature decisions when it comes to doing things as Spider-Man. I’ll let him continue to prove himself,’ he sits back down. ‘Besides, FRIDAY will let me know if anything really bad happens. It’ll set off a warning from his suit and we can go get him out of whatever situation he’s got himself in.’
‘Patience my friend,’ he advises with a smile, ‘He will deliver on his promises.’
‘Do we want to know?’ Wanda asks with a grin, bursting out laughing as Peter blushes bright red and ducks back into the attic.
‘There are many more things to consider rather than my own hurt, Barton, political as well as-’
‘Now he’s working with politicians. A group of people he’s made it very clear he has no time for in the past. I just- he just-’
‘School trip to MOMA,’ his reply is cut off with a yell as the alien sends him flying to the side.

Peter scowls and shakes his head. ‘He’s my friend and he’s here at our invitation. Back. Off.’
‘And if,’ Tony smiles as the two children struggle to stay awake to hear the end of the story, ‘if by some miracle they made it past the Angel, then they had two more sets of challenges, and the next one was one that no one, not monster or guardian, had ever managed to face down. The next guardian was the Fire Lady and no one could withstand her fiery glare; there is not a soul brave enough in the entire

‘I can’t see them leaving more there, they’ll need a big enough force to get through to our flag,’ Quill agrees.
Thank you so much for all the wonderful support for this story; honestly all of the comments have just been incredible and I feel so lucky to have such wonderful readers enjoying this story.
‘Considering I’m CEO of Stark Industries, the company that

‘But Wanda didn’t do loads of studying,’ Lila argues.

‘I would have thought the imminent invasion was more pressing than the boy’s sexual preferences.’
‘Tony it’s the first today,’ Sam chuckles.
dancer- and she makes the most amazing stew I have ever tasted in the world. Then she’ll turn round and teach you how to take someone out with a napkin. Honestly? Best piece of advice I’ve ever been given was how to knock someone out with a napkin. One day I’ll teach you. Just…don’t tell your Mom alright?’
‘I’d be very grateful,’ Vision breathes a sigh of relief. ‘I shall look at the dates online and text you the best ones?’
,’ he mutters, leaning into the blond’s shoulder. ‘I didn’t think it was possible for him to get any more over-protective.’
‘It’ll all blow over as long as we keep it on the down low how much time he’s spending with us,’ Rhodes says. ‘Though if you’d taken down that video of him giving his presentation it might not have gotten to this stage.’
Natasha smirks. ‘Tony was watching when I was having trouble practising switching the functions on my bites because I used to keep them separate in my suit, I never said anything but a couple of days later he turns up with a new set that has easy to change functions on it.’
There’s a soft knock on his door the day before the party.
‘Babe,
‘So you could help to heal Tony’s chest?’ Steve asks.
‘I’m afraid I have no experience to correspond with this concept. However, no I would not want to be something that I had always thought of as being evil.’ Vision thinks he’s probably said the wrong thing again when the dark haired man only nods with an odd expression on his face and turns away to concentrate on changing his shape. He’s still not comfortable with what he deems emotional conversations as he still finds it difficult to understand how to navigate the intricacies and pitfalls. And there are so many pitfalls.
‘If you insist,’ Bucky says, firing the gun and taking down the man standing next to Hammer.
‘Clint can you buy us some time?’ he asks.
‘Then who-’

‘When was the last time you were here?’ Bruce asks, looking around.
‘You were thinking too loud for me not to,’ she fires back with a smile, then it becomes a little more forced. ‘I know you’re worried about what’s coming next, when we’re not all here with you and you’re not with us…’ she pauses as if trying to work out how to phrase the next part.
Natasha crawls forward to check on their driver but can see from the angle of his neck the answer to Bucky’s question. ‘Dead,’ she says, helping Bucky manoeuvre Sam onto the road. ‘What happened?’
‘No,’ comes the unconvincing reply.
‘Likewise, Ororo,’ he bows and kisses her hand, ‘I hope the next time we meet will be under better circumstances.’
‘I believe,’ Loki draws him out of his thoughts, ‘that I may have succeeded.’
‘Wasn’t your dad supposed to be the god of wisdom or something?’ Lila asks, curiosity apparently outweighing her awkwardness at the turn of the situation.
‘Is this one of the Christmas traditions?’ Mantis asks, joining Wanda at the kitchenette.
‘Heading to the Sanctum. Happy’s going to get Pete and take him up to you. Wanda and Vision are meeting us there. If this is Thanos or any of his lieutenants then we need to get to the people with the stones now.’
‘Yes,’ he answers, even more worried now than he was before.
against his armour and Tony looks down to see the Mind Stone glowing on the back of his gauntlet. ‘What the-’
‘If you’re not on your way up in fifteen minutes I’m coming down and throwing you over my shoulder.’
to make any more calls?’ Steve’s voice is pleading.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘No offense Frau Leibner, but I don’t want anyone with mind control abilities and unknown loyalties coming anywhere near the team; we’ve not exactly got a good track record in that department. As for Jessica Jones: if you think I’ve got an attitude problem wait until you meet her. She’s not going to be interested, I already put out feelers.’
‘You’re telling me,’ Natasha frowns at him, ‘that you suggested using the law firm and you knew Matt Murdock was Daredevil?’
‘Better than your attempts at making space for our legs apparently,’ he retorts. The top of the table is now flat and ready to be used once the sanding is finished, which is what Sam is currently working on; they’ve carved underneath to slide out enough of the trunk to make benches to sit on and space for their legs to go underneath the table, it just needs a bit of tidying up before it can be sanded down and then treated. Which is what Bucky is currently working on. At the other end of the table where they can’t get into too much of an argument.
‘Me too, kid.’
’ Bucky asks.
Please do let me know what you thought of this chapter. I'm sorry to any comments I haven't responded to yet, I will be doing them after I have finished uploading everything.
‘You got anything that needs testing?’ she asks, perching on one of the stools near the door. She’s learned the hard way it’s always better to stay as far away from Tony and inventing as possible if you don’t want to get singed.
‘Charming as ever, Wade, and you’re welcome,’ Weasel says as he leaves the two of them alone, closing the door behind him.
‘Wait. You’re telling me you’re from a different dimension? That has got to be the craziest bullshit I have ever heard come out of your mouth,’ Rhodey says, shaking his head in disbelief.
what to expect from us in the field it can be incredibly dangerous for them and for us.’
‘What are you doing?’ Ned hisses at him.
‘Will do,’ Wade pauses long enough to give him a salute and then returns to his knitting.
A/N: Hello everyone! I hope you've all had a good week and you enjoy this chapter. Thank you so much for all the support for the story so far, please do let me know what you think of it and if there's anything you'd like to see in the future. I'm going to be catching up with replies tomorrow as I've lost track of what I've responded to and what I haven't and I'm so sorry for that!
‘Natasha,’ Wanda calls.
‘You’d think sending the two strongest members of the team to get the tree was the sensible idea,’ Tony muses, ‘apparently it’s the- what in the hell?!?’
not as bad as you make out.’
trained me to do,’ he spits out the word ‘they’ so Steve can be in no uncertain terms who he means. ‘I felt like a monster and there was nothing I could do to stop myself.’ Steve remains quiet next to him and Bucky glances at him out of the corner of his eye. ‘No righteous speech for me Captain?’
‘What did I do this time?’ he asks, mentally running through everything he’s done in the past week.
‘From
Eventually he loses the fight.
There’s lots of shouting, lots of noise as he hits the ground. He rolls, the movement making the knife dig deeper into his stomach, pulling it across to rip more muscle. He thinks he hears a grunt and the sound of something hitting the ground, but he’s face down in the dirt.
‘Aw crap,’ he starts shovelling food into his mouth.
Bucky shakes his head. ‘That right there sums up why I am so happy I left my teenage years behind like, a hundred years ago.’
Thank you so much to everyone who is continuing to read my inane ramblings. Do let me know if there is anything in the future you'd like to see!
‘As I have already explained,’ Bucky rolls his eyes, ‘the point of a food fight is not to hurt people it’s just to get messy. The messiest person loses and the cleanest person wins.’
His mood darkens. ‘Sif realised Thor was keeping a secret from them and she hated not knowing everything to do with him, and she convinced him to tell her. She went straight to Odin and told him I’d hidden a monster in my room; we were caught bringing Fenris back in after taking him out for exercise and Odin ordered him killed. Mother tried to convince him to let us keep the wolf but he wouldn’t listen to her.’
,’ she argues.
‘Proxima Midnight,’ Loki curses.
Tony chuckles and looks up at the soldier. ‘As Wanda pointed out yesterday Steve, we can’t exactly comment on age gaps. You’re a good fifty odd years older than me, not to mention you were friends with my father; I think at this stage you’re the definition of a cradle-snatcher.’ He laughs at Steve’s frown and presses a kiss to his forehead. ‘Don’t worry babe, I’m
‘I don’t want your sympathy, Deadpool,’ he snaps, then turns and runs off the building, shooting a web and swinging towards home.
‘Dude, seriously, you need to
Bucky’s response is instantaneous, and his hands tighten on Loki’s waist, the metal ones digging in and he’s sure he’s going to have bruises there tomorrow. Loki surprises even himself by keeping the kiss gentle; where he’d left Peter and even Tony bright red with the passion he’d poured in, Bucky’s was different.
‘Hey Tony, why did Steve tell me I needed to put my mask on? I mean it’s actually really lucky I have one here that I could find easily because he didn’t exactly give me a lot of warning and-’ Peter breaks off as he reaches the bottom of the stairs and sees the person standing behind Tony. ‘Wha-’
‘Really? So why now? What is it that’s making him want to change?’ Peter can’t stop the blush that starts to rise at Ned’s question. His friend’s eyes go wide. ‘Oh no. Pete, tell me you’re joking.’
‘Right rules,’ Steve’s voice carries around the assembled group of superheroes as they prepare to start the game of Capture the Flag, ‘we’ll select two team captains who will then take turns to choose the rest of their teams. Generally speaking you can use your powers, however: Strange, no creating portals unless it’s within your line of sight.’
Tony nods. ‘Yeah I don’t think I would be able to answer questions right now.’ He looks over at Wade as the group starts to head towards the main doors. ‘You should stop by a couple of times, Wilson,’ he suggests, falling into step with the mercenary. ‘Be good for the team to get to know you a little more.’
‘Merry Christmas, Nat.’ Tony grins as Clint follows his two children into the common area, Laura bringing up the rear with Nathaniel balancing on her hip.
Steve decided to take pity on Peter earlier and took it upon himself to monitor his childhood friend. They’d gone to stand near the bar, even though neither of them could get drunk it was entertaining seeing the reactions to the amount they were managing to drink between them from the bar staff.
‘Technically I don’t want you to
‘You still cannot think it’s a good idea to just bring them all back,’ Aizama says after some quiet deliberation. ‘How can we know they won’t start another fight? And how are you going to contact them?
‘I’ll take Peter and Wilson back to the city,’ Natasha says, pulling her car keys out of her coat pocket. ‘Want me to fill May in on the situation?’
‘Can we leave him like that all day?’ Rocket asks.
‘He says it was the best thing in the galaxy so it’s got a lot to live up or this guy is giving up his flying privileges for a month,’ Rocket jabs a thumb over his shoulder at Quill who is looking increasingly frustrated.
Let’s be honest it’s not a bad deal here.
‘Alright…’ Steve wonders where this is going. Is Sam going to tell Rumlow what he’s planning?
‘Pete just come with me,’ Ned pleads.
‘As friends or…as a date?’
‘You’re older than me, you idiot,’ Steve retorts, against the laughter from the class. ‘Now we drop down, and make sure you’re out of the way of each other. It’s not fun when someone lands on you, especially when they weigh a ton like a certain James Buchanan Barnes.’ Steve jumps down and looks up at Peter and holds his hands up, gesturing he’ll catch him.
‘Err… no idea.’
‘Steve’s been doing some exercises with me and it’s working well so far.’
‘Definitely Aunty Pepper,’ Morgan yawns.
Next are Natasha, who lands gracefully next to the god, and Clint as he parks the quinjet and opens the door. Natasha holds out her glove, where the red stone is sitting, and Clint reaches up to his vest to remove the orange one, both placing them on the gauntlet Tony holds out. When they sit in his suit it makes it difficult for him to breathe, and he sinks to his knees gasping for breath.
‘Ok everyone stop. We are never talking about this
‘You are the one who made me believe I was more than a monster,’ he holds a knife to Bucky’s throat, pinning him in place against him. ‘I will not let you fall into the darkness you saved me from.’
He can nearly feel Loki’s smile.
Tony notices Peter’s made sure he’s sat next to Rhodes, someone he’s already familiar with, and Bucky has sat himself on the kid’s other side by dragging a chair over.
Thank you so much for keeping up with this story and leaving reviews and kudos. I hope you're still enjoying it. Let me know if there is anything in particular you'd like to see at some stage. I got a whole background story for this out of one request so please do send in some suggestions.
‘Err…he’s alive?’
Smiling he walks over. ‘Need a hand?’ he offers, gesturing towards the tree.
‘It was my fault,’ he eventually whispers as a tear drop falls onto the glass front.
‘You didn’t know him,’ Tony points out, ‘therefore you shouldn’t have made an opinion on him considering everything you’ve already heard. Bruce and Thor have already made their decisions; the only other members of the original team apart from me are Steve, Natasha and Clint. As Clint isn’t here, Steve and Nat are the ones that need to say. Or are we going to bring up everyone’s actions prior to joining the team?’ he raises a challenging eyebrow.
‘-so treating it the same way we would a bleeding wound might be our best bet,’ Bruce nods. Steve sees Peter’s face light up just like it does when any member of the team praises him for a job well done.
‘What do you mean?’ Wanda asks.
‘Good to know you remembered something,’ he counters, blinking through the tears. ‘They took me away from you,’ he tells her, and sees her stop, ‘because they had to wipe me too much when I was with you. You made me too human.’
Tony lets out a breath of laughter as the other two come down the stairs. ‘Yeah well I knew someone who once told the government to go screw themselves and it seemed to work out alright for them. Thought I’d give it a go.’ After a pause he adds. ‘And I’ve always been badass, you just never admitted it.’
‘And it’s somewhere no one associates with us yet,’ Sam points out, ‘so we’d have some privacy.’
‘Could really use the other guys turning up right about now,’ Tony sighs as he takes off with Wanda towards the lab.
‘How polite of you. Is all well? Any news of the mercenary?’
I hope you all enjoy this chapter, I thought a little more bonding time would be needed as things are really going to start kicking off in the next chapter. I have written up to Chapter 45, and there's about six more to write so I'm nearly done with writing the story. I'll be keeping updates to single chapters until it is finished though, just in case I get a period of time where I don't get chance to write and I lose all my backlog - meaning you'd have to wait longer than a week to get an update! Once I have finished it, though, I may start back with the double updates. So watch this space!
‘Yeah well I didn’t know about Loki being an ice princess before I gave that name to Bucky, so unfortunately Bucky is Elsa.’
I hope you enjoy this week's chapter, please let me know what you think.
‘Wait what about after Venom was taken out?’
A/N: Hi everyone! Hope you enjoy these two updates. Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos. Please do let me know what you think of them!
‘I don’t know he finally seems to have knocked some sense into you,’ she retorts. ‘Besides he went easy on you.’
The rest of the car ride is quiet, not through any lack of effort on the two men. Peter just wasn’t in the mood to talk. The three of them make their way up to the common area, Bucky carrying Peter’s bags and waving the boy’s hands away when he tries to take them from him. He feels his stomach sink when there’s no sign of Tony in the room, and both Natasha and Wanda are sat on the sofa chatting when they walk in.
can tell you Steve’s birthday.’
‘I’m ready when you are,’ he answers. They’ve stopped off at the facility to check on a few things, Steve and Sam are elsewhere and they’re due to leave to go back to the house at Long Island soon.
Peter takes Wanda to meet Wade at Sister Margaret's. Whilst there some people turn up looking for Wade, and Peter asks him a little more about his past.
‘Give it a bit of a run and I’ll pull you up,’ the blond tells him, reaching down a little but nowhere near far enough for where Peter is going to end up.
Peter had wanted to go as well, but Tony had left him in no uncertain terms that he was staying with the rest of the team at the facility.
When they finally break apart they’re both breathless. Neither says anything as Peter take’s the man’s hand and leads him through the facility to their rooms. When they part outside, Peter presses another soft kiss to his lips.
‘You say Bucky didn’t recognise her when he shot her. I wonder if he did though,’ he muses out loud.
Tony is currently sat in the back of a car with the kid, being driven back to his home by Happy and giving him a chance to cover up his trademark suit.
‘Sorry, who?’ Wanda asks, looking between the three men.
‘What the-’ Tony breaks off as a familiar form lands in front of him, the red light around the alien now easier to see. ‘Wanda!’
‘Natasha. She’s here,’ he repeats, trying not to grin at the other man being as bad at getting absorbed in his work as Tony.
that’s what he’d said. The humanoid hadn’t said a thing, just nodded and tucked the folder into his bag and left. He’d returned four days ago. Four days for Wanda to have given the folder to Steve and for the super-soldier to have read it.
‘You don’t have any broken bones. He went easy on you,’ Natasha’s tone leaves no room for argument.
‘Buck! You don’t need to give him internal bleeding,’ Steve scolds his friend.
‘Hey I said I was sorry!’
‘But-’
‘Oh wow. I’m surprised Steve wasn’t first,’ Peter says.
‘Why are we not just letting the monster tire himself out and return to normal by himself?’ Nebula questions as they walk through the forest.
‘Course I do! I was a champion boxer before the war, beat every bastard in Brooklyn.’
‘We might be lodging with the dust mites?’ Natasha suggests with a small chuckle. ‘I think it’s a genius idea, Tony.’
‘I bet she was,’ Bucky sniggers. ‘Does this mean our little Pete’s all grown up?’
Wakanda Forever!
‘Nearly seventeen,’ Tony answers. ‘His birthday is in a couple of months.’
Loki laughs softly. ‘Not even Odin was prepared to cross her.’
Before Ross can say anything else he storms out the door, Vision behind him, and they make their way back to the jet. Luckily the others are already there when they arrive and Natasha has already started firing up the engines.
‘On the shortest day of the year,’ Loki answers, ‘to signal the end of winter.’
‘The team of lawyers can update me and I can always use the suit to get back quickly if I need to,’ he cuts off whatever Steve was going to say. ‘Pete, Wade and Happy have just dealt with whatever the hell that was,’ he waves his hand towards the top of the screen where the news coverage is still showing on mute in a small window, ‘we’ve just had Hammer’s team reveal relationships within the team, and you’re about to reveal Ross’ involvement in HYDRA. We
Peter gives a shaky laugh and sniffs. ‘Peter?’ the boy turns to look at Steve. ‘Why don’t you go tell Nat and the others that he’s awake?’ The boy nods and, giving Tony a proper hug this time, runs from the room to go and find the assassin.
He’d heard Tony mentioning to Steve earlier he had to finish something for Natasha’s present and knew the inventor would most likely be leaving the workshop now. The workshop where he knew for a fact that Steve had hung a sprig of mistletoe in order to catch the inventor under it numerous times over Christmas. Those two were so sickening. If Loki were soft he’d find it sweet. Which he most certainly does not.
‘Hey leave the kid alone!’ one of the other hostages says, a middle aged man with a balding head.
‘Bucky?’ he says in disbelief.
‘Clint’s next,’ Bruce says as the mercenary takes his seat again, ‘idiot wasn’t pacing himself earlier.’
‘No mutiny from this side, Cap,’ Scott assures him.
‘You sound surprised to learn all of this, Captain,’ an emotionless voice says behind him. Steve spins to see Vision phasing through the wall. ‘Why is that?’
‘No worries,’ he says, and starts swinging them backwards and forwards.
‘Yeah course we will,’ he smiles at her.
‘Well…yeah?’
‘How about this?’ Loki interrupts. ‘He comes to Yule.
‘And if we let the two of you go to the one here,’ Ororo interrupts carrying some drinks for the three of them, ‘then we won’t see either of you for the rest of the
‘How come I haven’t seen him before?’ Bucky frowns, looking between Tony, Rhodes and Vision.
‘We’ll be having a vocabulary test next lesson Mr Parker, I suggest you get the list from one of your friends,’ his teacher says as he makes his way forwards.
‘Wait you remember his but you can barely remember everyone else’s?’ Rhodes demands.
‘She’s going back to Tony,’ he replies.
‘She was my hero,’ Rhodes says.
‘Hell yeah, it’s a free bar as well!’ Blake says, looking over Andrew’s other shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Watch it Buck, or I’ll make sure you’re in the running as well,’ Steve growls, then promptly moves the conversation on to what else would be entailed in the charity gala.
‘I trust Ross about as far as I could throw Hulk one handed,’ Tony states. ‘I wouldn’t put it past him to contrive a situation where one of us has to use our powers to defend ourselves and spins it as us attacking the general populace.’
‘What?’
I'm trying to get back on track with my writing so hopefully I can have a couple more updates up for you this week and we can at least reach the end of Yule before Christmas gets here.
She laughs and wraps her hands her mug. ‘Is this about Ross? You’ve got to be careful Tony, we can’t just try and take the guy out, it’ll ruin our relationship with the Council as well as the US Government.’
Unaware the rest of their team has been experiencing problems back in the US, the team at the UN are attacked themselves.
Fury raises an eyebrow. ‘Considering the first one of his you attended, do you really think that’s wise?’
to,’ Peter shrugs. He can see the very second the kid catches sight of the other occupants of the room: his mouth snaps shut and his eyes go wide.
‘Yeah,’ Steve’s voice is strangled. ‘Yeah we are, Tony.’
‘Well now you know there’s another person you can call to come help,’ he responds, passing Peter’s phone back to him. ‘Doesn’t matter when or where, Spidey. I’ll come help if you need me to.’
‘You only lose control when trigger words are used,’ Vision counters. ‘And it is very unlikely anyone here would know them. Even if they did they wouldn’t be confident enough to control you should anything go wrong. In addition FRIDAY knows everything that happens on the facility, so if you should run into any difficulties she will notify one of us.’
Tony watches the blond disappear, mind whirling with everything he’s just learned. He has a bad feeling about all of this.
‘Please tell me we’re not-’
Her eyes go even wider. ‘Really? Can you really climb walls?’
‘First off,’ Tony says, lifting his faceplate, ‘you were told to get out of the situation right at the start, but you decided to put yourself back into the middle of it. Not only that you called in a mercenary. Into a fire fight in a
‘Try it again and I’ll put you through the window,’ Peter’s arm are crossed over his chest. ‘Now is anyone else going to try and kill someone or can we get back to working out how to save the universe?’
‘I have yet to find a flavour to rival vanilla in my opinion, however caramel has come close.’
‘Yeah, why?’ he’s looking a little nervous.
Bucky blinks and seems to take in what’s just happened. ‘Oh yeah… that’s a very good point. You’re dead Wilson.’
‘You wound me with your unjust accusations,’ Loki puts a hand to his chest.
not for how much money your daddy has. Now why don’t you run along to your cronies and leave us to enjoy our dinner in peace?’
A/N: Hi everyone. I updated on Friday like I promised! So I know these chapters are a little slower, but next chapter will see the wrap up of Far From Home, and things will start to pick up.
A/N: Merry Christmas everyone! I hope you've all had a wonderful holiday and are now able to relax and recover from all the festivities.  I shall be updating as soon as I have two chapters to go up, and hoping to have this story finished by New Year. No promises though!
He lets out a small moan of protest when the machines start beeping in warning and Steve pulls away. ‘You’re not supposed to be getting excited,’ he apologises, pressing a kiss to his forehead and pulling away a little.
a sore spot after all these years? I know, why don’t we find a way to introduce your little spider to Vanessa huh? I mean she’s a bit different now to how you remember her, but then so will Spider-Man by the time they meet. Hey maybe they can compare notes on how you performed. Tell me do you let the little spider take you, or do you just fuck him into the mattress every night and just take what you want? Maybe I could even-’
‘Nice of you to join us,’ comes Tony’s tense greeting. Still keeping their eyes on the fight the two of them inch round towards him.
T’Challa chuckles. ‘Oh no he fought like a cub that doesn’t want it’s mother to leave for the hunt: making lots of protests but no claws to back it up. However the Council has signed the documents, and the President has agreed so there is little he can do.’
He notices Bucky’s grin during Meg’s song that’s directed at Steve and he can’t help raising an eyebrow in question. He only gets a shake of the head in response.
. No leads. Nothing. I can’t get hold of Venom quickly enough to be able to ask, so this is the quickest way.’
‘I’m not telling you which of your staff is spying on you,’ Hammer laughs.
‘Nice. Alright we starting from now?’ the archer asks.
‘Never,’ he promises her. ‘Not as long as we’ve got the team right?’
‘No cheating now, Barnes,’ Rhodes jokes, ‘I know you’re going to need all the help you can get but FRIDAY will know if you do.’
There wasn’t a more fitting phrase ever said about Peggy, Steve muses as he looks up at the woman’s face, with the small smile he knew so well.
Peter shrugs. ‘That’s just the way I look at it. I mean I know he took on a lot of Tony’s worst personality traits from that time as well, but I think a lot of those old influences also played a part in how he went about trying to follow Tony’s plan. I’m not saying Tony can’t sometimes be a bit overenthusiastic when it comes to protecting people around him, I mean I know that more than most people, and there’s times I thought he was a bit harsh on me. But that’s just the way he is, he kind of bulldozes his way through things when he’s scared, but it doesn’t mean he doesn’t care. Plus he’s much better now than he used to be back then.’
‘You taught me that,’ she snaps at him, stepping over him and continuing along the path.
bad were we?’ Tony asks the soldier.
Steve desperately wants to tell him, but can’t break his promise to Peter. ‘He had an accident with another kid and got some coffee spilt down his shirt, Buck leant him his hoodie so he didn’t have to travel back soaking wet.’
Tony chuckles, and Steve can’t help the answering smile. ‘I’ve never known two people get so excited about Christmas. I also didn’t realise how many Christmas films there actually were now, and not all of them are good.’
He decides to just roll with it. ‘Why don’t I teach you? We can do it down here where no one will see and no one ever needs to know that Captain America didn’t know how to dance before this gala.’
‘Thank you, Captain,’ the magician replies, reaching up to touch the pendant where the stone is currently sitting.
‘It’d be my pleasure,’ he replies smoothly.
‘Shit I forgot how smart you are,’ Peter tries to laugh but it comes out kind of strangled.
Yep. This was definitely his favourite training session.
‘Are they alright?’ Ned asks, voice shaking.
‘Tony-’ Rhodes starts.
Steve puts his friend in a head lock. ‘Buck, you keep on that train of thought and I’m going to let Tony put you on your backside.’
‘Thank you Dr Higgs,’ he nods, ‘make sure I owe you a holiday somewhere of your choice alright?’
‘I really wouldn’t do that if I were you,’ Deadpool’s voice is threatening, and Peter is sharply reminded that the man he’s brought into this with him is a killer.
‘Bullshit, but I understand if you don’t want to talk about it,’ the man says, walking over to him and putting his arm around his shoulders. ‘You know we’re all here if you ever do though, right?’
‘Boss you might want to pause the game,’ FRIDAY’s voice interrupts as they start the final lap. ‘Sergeant Barnes is bringing a visitor up.’ Tony sighs and pauses the game, causing a series of protests to emanate from the other players. They’re still grumbling when Bucky enters followed by Sharon Carter.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Looks like Carol’s got some company,’ Sam points to the small group heading towards the back door.
‘What?’ Wanda’s voice snaps from the other side of the door.
‘What do you mean by evil monsters, Morgan?’ Steve asks her, voice gentle.
‘Pepper darling, I’m on my way back now. But I need you to do a few things for me.’
‘Alright, fine. Just trying to help, man.’
Peter doesn’t even think before kneeling down next to the merc and throwing his arms around him.
From the looks of things the fight is not going well for Loki. The ice weapons formed at the end of his arms do not look as stable and solid as the ones Lautenus has, and there are several bleeding wounds on his arms and face; his breathing appears heavier than his opponent and he is certainly on the defensive, ducking and weaving under all of the attacks and barely getting any in himself.
Nat.’
She looks over at Bucky and he shrugs. ‘Seems like a good plan to me, and he is right: Fury wanted to use him to do this so it wouldn’t alert HYDRA to what we know.’
‘Seriously? Tony Stark you’ve corrupted him!’
‘Mr Stark basically wants to start a PR war with the Secretary General so we’re brain storming ideas on what the team can do,’ Peter beats them all to it, taking advantage of Bucky’s distraction at Pepper’s entrance to steal his bag of crisps.
‘Loki threw a diva tantrum,’ Natasha answers from the breakfast bar, reading over some notes.
‘Which is exactly why I need you to have my back.’
‘Because Peter can keep his mouth shut,’ she replies, then turns to him. ‘Come on, Pete we better make a move if we’re going to make it back in time for dinner. Wanda’s cooking tonight with Vision.’
‘Woah, woah, woah champ,’ Natasha laughs, grabbing hold of his arm. ‘You need to help out here first before you go running off. Mr Harris I assume?’ he extends her other hand for Peter’s teacher to shake. ‘I do apologise for Peter’s apparent lack of manners.’
He nods. ‘You mind taking the lead with this? I may not have actually gotten any sleep last night and I’m still too wound up to mention Ross without blowing a gasket. Vision and Wanda can join us when they get back.’ As she nods he gives her a smirk.
‘Still no lead on Tin Can?’ the merc’s voice is sympathetic.
Wade hops down and pushes the doors closed, then he and Natasha creep round the side of the van to stand near Bucky’s rolled down window. Wade stays standing, keeping an eye back behind them, while she crouches down and peers round the front of the truck.
‘-I agree to your terms. Face me and I shall leave this pathetic planet and your
He is not expecting the sight that greets him when he walks into the training room.
‘No we took out two others,’ he replies as Steve and Wong rejoin them.
him to go back. Damn stubborn kid. When we watched the others dusting he must have known what was going to happen to him because he…he was asking me to help him…he said he didn’t want to go and I…I couldn’t stop it, I couldn’t help him…and then,’ Tony’s breath catches, ‘he told
‘And what other name do you go by?’
‘Not just tonight,’ he mumbles, just loud enough to hear, and Tony swears his heart skips a beat.
Later losers!
‘Tony you can’t just leave them without anywhere to go because they won’t-’
‘Ok you’re rude but I like you,’ Shuri says and T’Challa groans. ‘And what are you talking about controlling the stone?’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Don’t get cocky, kid,’ Steve retorts, aiming another punch his way.
‘Do I get a say in whether I do it or not?’ Tony asks.
looker.’
‘Did Wanda by any chance get you to take her to meet him when she came to get you yesterday?’
. And when they’ll do, they’ll be coming to get more of us and get us under the same kind of control that they did Barnes way back when. And here’s another thing we haven’t considered yet: Beck.’
‘They asked me about our relationship when they were questioning me,’ Tony sighs, ‘just as a warning: it’ll be all over the tabloids by the morning if not before.’
Harry raises an eyebrow at her. ‘Seriously? They’ve literally
‘I’ll be alright,’ he promises the blond, squeezing his hand, ‘just give me a minute.’
Half way through the film, which they’re only half watching because they’re actually having too much fun gossiping about the rest of the team, Wanda gets a little quiet.
‘That’s not going to affect Stark Industries is it?’ Steve asks.
As always here's your sneak peek:
It’s only a little later, as Mama and May are in the kitchen with Wanda and Rhodes preparing dinner that Tony gets a chance to speak to Peter. He finds the youngster sitting looking out of a window with a thoughtful expression on his face.
‘We haven’t got a choice, Sam. You’re off doing your Avenger thing, you ain’t here to help all the time,’ a voice replies from the other end of the phone. ‘You don’t see what’s happening, what I have to do to keep it running.’
Pepper looks over at Steve and Rhodes with pleading eyes, ‘Please take your team home.’
Ok, ok. Honestly? I didn’t really do it for Tin Can or the rest of them. I didn’t even do it for you fucktards, or because the author doesn’t want to kill Tin Can (because apparently that’s too much… you know still letting Vision die is fine but Tony? Oh no we have to draw the line somewhere apparently).
It is going to be a slow burn with the relationships I’m afraid so do bear with me. Hope you’ve enjoyed this chapter.
‘We can’t be certain how much of his knowledge he shared with them,’ Fury goes on. ‘So, Peter is right, they could be hiding next door and we wouldn’t know.’
‘I am!’ he protests. ‘I promise I am.’
‘Until they’ve broken me.’
Love always,
Peter’s insides twist uncomfortably, remembering the last time someone had come to his school. Then he catches sight of the red-head a little down the corridor. ‘Natasha!’ without thinking he runs towards the assassin, seeing the worry tightening her features, and wraps his arms around her. ‘Please tell me he’s alright,’ he mumbles against her as she holds him tightly. ‘Please, please, just tell me he’s alright.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Francis’ grin turns even more satisfied and motions to someone in the shadows. Peter feels his stomach drop through the floor as the soldier they want him to fight comes fully into the light.
‘He did?’ Peter grins, the teen and the archer have been getting on really well and Tony’s slightly worried how many pranks are going to be pulled between them. Especially if he convinces Clint to forgive Loki and include the trickster in their schemes.
Tony laughs. ‘Clint’s got the better priorities,’ he agrees.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Clint,’ Rhodes’ pained voice comes through the fog of dust and Clint crawls towards it, finding the other man safe with two of the civilians having helped to drag him out. He now realises the hands that were dragging him must have belonged to the third person they’d saved.
‘…No?’
The Avengers wanted his help. With a mission.
Peter and Loki meet some old and new friends whilst Christmas shopping, and Natasha learns why Pepper doesn't let Tony write invitations.
‘Alright give me minute.’
She nods. ‘I think he would have liked you.’
‘Tony’s been taking the heat for all of our mistakes,’ he replies, hands curling into fists at his side in frustration. ‘He seems to think that everything that happened with the Accords is something he has to fix alone. But like Rhodey said we were all at fault and we all need to start doing something to help. We’ve been sat around too long, we need to speak to Tony and work out how we can manage this so we all play a part.’
‘Completely understandable in the circumstances, Miss Romanov,’ Mr Harris looks a little flustered. ‘Where would you like us to take the kids?’
‘You’re such a brat.’
‘Nuh uh,’ Steve says, clamping a hand over Tony’s mouth. ‘If I’m not allowed to have a say neither are you.’
‘How about I make us banana splits?’ he suggests. ‘Then we can find a way to put hair dye in Bucky’s shampoo so it dyes his hair orange.’
‘Any chance you can give me tips on how to still look fabulous even when tired?’ he jokes, heading straight to the cupboards and pulling out one of the largest mugs they own.
‘And Steve and Bucky are downstairs sparring trying to take out their frustration over Ross on each other,’ she finishes. ‘Tony did you actually get any sleep last night?’
‘Nick!’ Steve stands to greet the one-eyed director.
‘Does what you feel for Bruce feel like you can work for it with only the hope that he won’t leave again?’ he cuts across her, dark eyes challenging her.
would be in control of the body instead of
‘Oh shove it, Doc,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘You’ve just been annoyed we’ve been helping Loki impose the no magic rule. You’ve had loads of fun.’
‘Did you
‘Just come here would ya?’
What’s happened next? Oh yeah Peter got possessed by a killer alien, but he’s fine now. Kids these days will bounce back from anything. Even Covid.
Clint chuckles. ‘Yeah I hear you. Sometimes it’s nice to just sit and enjoy the quiet at home when the kids have gone to bed. Listen, Loki, about what Nathaniel said at lunch-’
‘I think it likes you, Reindeer Games,’ Tony laughs.
Peter lets out a sigh of relief. ‘Sounds good.’
The soldier smiles at him and presses a kiss to his forehead. ‘He did, honey. Now let’s go to sleep.’
‘So there’s an Ant-Man
Hope you all have a good week and thank you for sticking with my ramblings.
to be created, to break out from the sceptre, and he was influencing the people around him, kind of like what the sceptre did to all of you on the Helicarrier with Loki.’
Wanda’s power, combined with whatever power Carol Danvers appears to have, rush towards the gauntlet. It glows, brighter and brighter, and Tony can’t tear his eyes away from it, even when Thanos’ angry roar gets closer and closer.
Natasha laughs softly. ‘Just tell me what you need and I’ll find it for you.’
‘My thoughts almost precisely,’ Strange adds. ‘I’m going to guess that these are some of Thanos’ lieutenants, come to claim the stones.’
Peter snorts. ‘I’ll leave him and Rhodey do their ‘flying manoeuvres’ and that should keep them both off my back.’
‘Oh no,’ Bucky says before Peter can even open his mouth. ‘
‘Tony, he’s right,’ Steve sighs, and something in his tone has the inventor’s fingers pausing on the keyboard in front of him and sighing.
It starts as a black dot in the sky, then slowly grows into a smudge and, before they know it, the plane is gliding to a stop down the runway. Vision fiddles with the cuffs of his jumper and Tony resists the urge to smack his hands down. He briefly wonders if Pepper ever acted like that, then shakes those dangerous thoughts out of his head.
‘Literally or figuratively? Cause with him it could be either.’
stay in touch with the team at the same time. It’s one or the other with this version. So only use it when you’re on the flight back. Or if something goes really wrong.’
Tony laughs despite himself and gestures for the wizard to follow. ‘Come on everyone’s getting the stuff ready. I have no idea what to expect so don’t ask. It depends on how enthusiastic Thor is feeling and if Loki can rein him in or not as to how crazy it gets.’
‘Are you going to tell him about Deadpool?’ Ned asks quietly, finally closing his locker and the two of them head towards the front of the school. ‘Plus I’m pretty sure Mr Stark is the dictionary definition of making a scene.’
‘Especially when Loki is joining them,’ Wanda adds, there’s a round of laughter from the other students in the group.
‘Where’s Wade been hiding recently? I swear I can never get him to go away when I want him to, and over the past few weeks he just disappears for hours at a time,’ the soldier asks him.
Natasha looks up as another box is lowered down to her via Peter’s webs. ‘Is that the last of it?’ she calls up to him and Sam.
‘Not sure I’ll ever be prepared, but yeah let’s get it over with.’
‘I…thank you,’ the blue skinned woman sounds surprised.
‘Right,’ Natasha says, coming into the kitchen and putting her phone back in her pocket, ‘T’Challa’s confirmed that he and Shuri will be here for Yule, then they’ll go back to Wakanda for Christmas there and come back for New Year with Okoye, Nakia and W’Kabi.’
‘Just a bit of light reflecting off something, probably just from the window of a bus driving by or something,’ he replies. The waitress arrives with their drinks and interrupts any more conversation until she leaves.
Tony does his best to not fidget as the plane rolls to a standstill on the tarmac. Rhodes and Vision are standing either side of him as they wait for the passengers to disembark.
‘I’m still concerned,’ Sam says.
‘Just ignore him,’ Peter replies, ‘Sam said he’d be just down the street, let’s get a move on. Maybe he’ll get bored or we can give you a lift back.’
‘Tony you’re still healing, we shouldn’t be-’
‘So you’re all going to be in teams of five, as that’s what we normally split the agents into, and you’re going to see how well you can tackle each obstacle, bearing in mind that each one will need to be handled differently,’ Bucky says.
‘I’ve come here
He hears what he hopes is a breath of laughter on the other end. But that could be wishful thinking. Still the knot in his chest eases slightly. ‘I’m just surprised you got him to agree with you.’
‘No,’ he smiles in relief. ‘I like having a friend I don’t have to explain everything to.’
‘Bucky ma’am,’ he says, not wanting to hear his other name right now and offers his hand.
‘You’re trying to look innocent-’
‘Oh just go,’ Wanda sticks her tongue out at him as he follows the woman.
Bucky flips a switch and let’s FRIDAY take over on auto-pilot, then stands up and stretches.
Sharon’s smile of greeting turned into a frown. ‘Unfortunately not a general social call. I’m here to see him,’ she gestures at Tony.
Thank you so much to all my readers, and to those of you who leave reviews - I do love some of the discussions I've been having in response to some of these reviews. Honestly? The reaction to this story has completely blown me away: 154 comments, 248 kudos and 58 bookmarks! I honestly cannot thank you all enough, you are so wonderful!
‘Would it be better coming from someone else?’ T’Challa offers.
‘Right, on it!’ the teen responds, rushing after the Cloak that was flying Strange away.
‘Not now, Ned,’ Peter hisses, and pulls MJ back as a soldier comes crashing through the classroom window. As they turn another comes round the corner from where the sound of a fight, and Deadpool’s commentary, is coming from and grabs onto her, pulling her against him and pressing a gun to her head.
‘I’ll go get the others,’ Natasha tells him. ‘Do you want us to go in ahead?’
‘Yeah?’ Tony knows Peter’s only half listening as he has a half-frown on his face that he gets when he’s concentrating on something.
long.’
‘When did you get eaten by a polar bear?’ Peter frowns.
The Avengers wanted his help. With a mission.
‘Merry Christmas,’ she replies, then holds his face so she can look at him properly. ‘You’re carrying a lot of worries, young man, I suggest you find a way to lose some of them. You don’t need to be carrying so much at such a young age.’
‘Yo Cap! Mon Cap-e-tan! O Captain, my-’
and not himself right?’ she interrupts again.
Steve’s surprised to say the least. ‘You’re asking for permission to go after one of the labs? Why? Surely you would have just gone and dealt with it and come back before we’d even realised what you’d done?’
‘Since when can you drive?’ Peter asks her.
‘What do you mean?’ he frowns.
There’s a few cheers from the class as they pack away their books. Peter smiles at Ned as his friend comes over, he’s still not able to stop talking about how awesome the weekend was, and Peter can’t find it in him to disagree. It has to have been his best birthday ever.
‘Kid I swear if you ask me to give you the birds and the bees talk I’m sending you to your room.’
‘You’ve been thinking about this a lot haven’t you?’
I say it. Understood?’ He gives her a smile and nods. ‘Strange you ready to come now?’
‘Strangely enough, yeah. It has everything to do with the fight you two just had. Now normally I’d be all for staying out of it and letting you two sort it out yourselves-’
I got my powers, now there’s kids like Cassie wanting to be one without even having powers.’
Peter can’t help the blush that creeps up at Wade’s words. ‘I’m not some kind of girl that needs you to sweep her off her feet you know.’
,’ Bucky cuts off Steve, pointing a metal finger in Peter’s face, ‘you were supposed to tell us if that little shit continued?’ Then he turns to Harry. ‘By the way you are my new favourite person.’
‘Oh really?’ Steve’s tone is sarcastic. ‘Yeah because we all know how happy Ross is to admit when he’s wrong. I needed you to help me protect my childhood best friend, and you wouldn’t listen. Just like now!’
Bucky opens his mouth to add something when he hears it. His heart nearly stops.
‘We’ll look out for him, Bucky,’ Steve promises himself as well as his friend, ‘the two of us.’
'Yeah told you to go have a look. Might save you a phone call,' Weasel chuckles, then breaks off when he catches sight of Wade's face. 'Uh Wade? Wade!'
He hardly heard Agent Thirteen’s voice past the deafening hammer of his heart, voice muffled and unintelligible as if she were behind glass.
No, none of that for the morning. Last night’s bruises proved he needed to be more awake to calibrate repulsors. Another sip had Tony stopping before the lab doors, ushering himself in to clink mug atop a workbench.

“I don’t know a
“That guy you tagged. SHIELD.” Tony sniffed, hands resting delicately inside pockets. “Ever get the feeling you’re being watched?”
“Fifteen.” He agreed. No more, Stark.”
“I’m coming tomorrow, you hear me? Remember some pants this time.” Rhodey called back, fingers rubbing down his face. He hoped that mess of a man was heading straight for a nap - as for himself; he supposed he had one hell of a date with Secretary Ross.
The pulsing grew quicker, blue eyes worriedly looking towards the device. “I’m gonna get you out of here.” They were more for himself, carefully gathering Bucky into his arms. “Til the end of the line, pal. Isn’t that right?”
It really was a work of art, in its own way. The smooth angles of the walls, the high, open ceilings. Steve could admire it as a sculpture of sorts, even if it
Another distant rumble scattered his thoughts, gripping Tony tightly. “Stay here. I’m going to get Bucky.” Calloused fingers curled around his wrist, halting Steve in his spot. “Tony--” He began to protest, knowing exactly what was running through the billionaire’s mind--
“Deadly, Rogers. Now move your old keister and get up here.”
Steve backed off of Tony’s workspace, checking the time on the room’s clock. Nearly time for lunch. His mouth opened, about to suggest a break--
“I advise you to move inside sir. Structural integrity is at nine percent.”
Tangled limbs froze, lips slowly pulling away in an unfinished kiss.
Tony straightened his posture, turning so most of his body faced Steve. “What’s waiting for you back home?” He asked. There was no snark, no double meaning to Tony’s question, so Steve sighed.
for nearly seventy years.”
Perfect. Just, perfect.
“There’s something else.” He started, carefully removing a hand off his gun, and down to the keyboard. Steve watched as another file pulled up, one more recognizable than any of the others.
passes I don’t think about what those Accords did.”
Again. Tony rumbled the sweetest noise imaginable, filling Steve’s heart to the brim. Again and again they kissed, each closer, warmer, intoxicating. Tony tasted better than Steve could have
That break had come at a good time -- hadn’t it? He really thought the accords would set everything right -- bring everybody together again; arguably not in the same way, but
about the severed arm --
A gentle hand pulled him from his trance, rubbing his shoulder. “He’ll be there.” His words were soft, reassuring.
Tony was the good in Steve’s modern life. He was the reason Steve looked forward to waking up in an otherwise foreign world. His laughs instilled happiness, his smiles warmed Steve’s soul. The soldier would listen to him talk for
The rest unfolded in a blur. Gunshots sprayed across his shield, accomplishing nothing as Steve launched it towards the figures outlined by gunfire, narrowly escaping bullets with a quick tuck and roll. Steve counted three impacted grunts, jumping in time with the vibranium hum to clasp the rim and twist it back midair into the one still standing. All that remained when Steve’s feet hit the floor was the soft ring of vibranium on its return down the hall.
Tony scoffed, the beginnings of blood dripping off his brow, so conveniently obstructing his view. Another alien seemed to take the split second advantage, its intentions clear a second too late. Their armored claws extended, scraping down metal until they snagged a groove, roughly yanking Tony out of the air with a yelp. These things were a damn nuisance, but it was nothing a rough spin couldn’t solve, delighted to see centripetal force do its job and release the flightless Chitauri’s grip. Hello one-way ticket.
Also I like...almost never write fanfic smut so sorry about that.
The same couldn’t be said for the rest.
Eventually, Tony nodded through the coughs racking his body. “I’ll live.” Relief filled Steve’s heart, pressing gentle lips to his dirtied forehead.
dammit. It was clear he couldn’t fight them off alone.
“Do you want me to fix this or not?” Tony muttered, averting eyes back to circuits. If he tampered enough with the wiring, he could have Rhodey in a split — that’d be kinda funny—
“We get Bucky, and we leave.” Steve traveled down another flight, determined to find his friend -- and not die in the process. It was another reason he didn’t like Tony down here, but like
Tony mimicked his display, earning a smile from Steve. “Something tells me you’ve done this before.” He lightly teased, stepping closer again.
He sounded ridiculous verbalizing the elephant in the room. Time travel was only an idea, it was
“Playing dirty?” The soldier asked, settling on haunches as Tony advanced.
“I hear you’re an artist.” Steve was alone with Tony today, given time to discuss details that might further their study. He figured SHIELD recorded their session anyway, but one-on-one conversations felt much more natural, even if Tony’s were always a little out of the norm.
Steve scoffed, because really, he was right. “You’ve done so much for me, and all I seem to do is break things.”
Other than that — Steve had no clue what SHIELD was, or how they gained control over that number.
“It should’ve happened differently. You can’t control their choices, Tony—“
“C’mon, they don’t let
Not here? That wasn’t reassuring, distracting him from blocking blunt claws scraping across his reactor. “Cap, I could use some ground support.” He tried again, blood running cold as he watched the sky blacken with Chitauri soldiers.
Steve’s answer
He hurried to a window, eyes peering through the dense forest growth. “Someone else is here.” His conclusion stopped Tony in his tracks, hand outstretched for the door.
person to do so much for Steve, when he received so little in return. It baffled him, blew his mind, and all he could think to do was offer his thanks.
“Come get lunch with me. You need to get out of this place.” Rhodey was sure it only harbored bad memories.
plaguing his thoughts.
And returning to his proper time meant Steve would
“Zemo’s weapon.” Steve followed Tony out, taking a wide gander at the gigantic penthouse that opened before him.
He nodded again, softly kissing his thumb. Steve was beginning to think he’d already made it.
protecting people after they rejected them. One step at a time.
to hit
He didn’t know if he’d ever recover from that.
“I’m giving you the grand tour.” Tony’s response was simple, unbothered, and Steve was so desperately trying to find some weird, deeper meaning between the lines, but nothing came. Not until Steve caught sight of someone he’d seen two blocks back.
“--they’ll have everything they need.” Tony quickly finished, hurrying out the door and down the jet steps.
made it possible.”
“Seventy--” That tour guide told him Zemo had been dead for that long.
Steve ran a hand down his face, fingertips pinching the bridge of his nose. “So, you think SHIELD is using
“Fresh air? In there?” Steve inquired, but Tony didn’t so much as move a muscle out of line.
Coulson turned them down another hallway, and down a rather steep flight of stairs. “Captain, we believe
“What if he isn’t?” It was a fair question, an answer the distressed soldier needed.
Lunch with Tony was, nice.
It took Steve more than a minute to collect himself, find his words, but finally he smiled.
Wait--Steve had also seen them at the

Zemo’s weapon was eating the facility seconds at a time.
“Oh god.” Steve sank to his knees, sheathing his flashlight as he placed a gloved hand against their chest. Still breathing -- oh god, he was
manifested on these--
He continued, teaching him right and left hooks, the proper stances; Steve even threw in an uppercut, curious how far Tony intended on stretching this lesson.
Steve finally settled on words. “I should find that tape.” The sooner he did, the quicker he could shower and start his day.
Once Steve was certain no agents loomed ahead, he pulled a flashlight off his belt, extracted from an agent who no longer needed it. Brief scans along the larger rubble left him empty. No bodies, no blood, nothing. Nerves caught up with Steve, apprehensively adjusting his grip. Something wasn’t right.
are the anomaly.” Steve ducked his head the whole way down, shoulders brushing against the narrow walls.
The table groaned, unaware how tightly his fingers gripped the table. No. This was a mistake. Frantically he searched through the files, hoping something,
Steve wiped sweat beading down his temple, blowing air out slowly.
His eyes searched across the empty space, before the burning sensation became too prominent of a thought to ignore. He ran the scalded spots underneath water, eyes burning with the plea to sleep just a little longer. He wished he could.
Steve scoffed a laugh, “Prove it.” Tony popped a fry into his mouth, wiping hands with a napkin, ready to show how incredibly serious he was. Steve watched while he took another messy bite of burger, wiping his own napkin across mouth in an attempt from staining his mouth shades of red and yellow.
“My lips are sealed.” Steve returned the smirk, taking a spot beside Tony to better see what he was doing. “Don’t suppose you draw,” Steve said, eyes drifting across the amalgamations of numbers, figures and equations that made absolutely zero sense to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony wanted to smile, still caught in the aftershock of Steve’s untimely arrival, and the one-armed punching bag in his arms.
He growled, dividing his attention as best as possible. “Start talking.” He could be out of that door in seconds, fancy locks or not. Both held their positions, while Coulson strained a sigh.
“Hold on, hold on.” Steve couldn’t help but laugh, shaking his head at the billionaire. “I know you don’t

Steve’s eyes closed, the softest kiss imaginable brushing blonde hair. “Then we’ll find him.”
“I miss the team.” He finally forced out, heavier silence settling in the air. He could already see the corners of Rhodey’s mouth dropping. “Things are different now. Not a
The vibranium muffled the deafening roar of the collapse, but it couldn’t deafen the distraught screams. Steve felt the heat off Tony’s face burrowed against his neck, gripping him tighter with every impact taken by his shield.
Steve unzipped the top. “One, maybe two dozen vehicles. They didn’t park in the open.” If they had, Tony’s jet would have crushed them like a soda can -- but why hide? He pulled rumpled fabric out, draping it across an armchair.
Right up until he wasn’t.
“Tony--”
“It’s where I belong. I shouldn’t see the invention of smartphones, or self-driving cars. It’s way beyond my time.” Steve turned his head more in Tony’s direction, eyes dulling in their sheen. “You said it yourself. I’m a man out of my time.” He could tell Tony was thinking by the way his eyes glossed over Steve’s face, but Steve had given up trying to read his face by now.
claim my team and I are either dead or missing?”
“Yeah. In Nineteen-sixty something. Tell me, who of those bunch are still alive?” Steve frowned, watching Tony pop a handful into his mouth. “That’s right -- none. Agendas change when power shifts.”
Find Bucky.
No such rubble existed -- but two walls and a large chunk of the ceiling were missing.
“Tony--” Steve babbled, frozen in place. Caught red-handed. “I can explain--”
Tony walked towards a table, setting his nearly-empty cup down. “You’re right.” He said, motioning Steve for the boxing ring further inside the decently sized space. “It’s about time you taught me a few moves.”
super excited for this one guys! love to hear your thoughts!
It came as an order this time, sparking Steve’s compliance. They rolled until Tony laid flush on the mat, eager brown eyes and messy chocolate locks greeting Steve. His chest heaved, forehead beaded with sweat from their sparring, but a different scenario briefed Steve’s mind, the kind that brought people shame.
Steve swore his face burned a degree higher, nervously chuckling to avoid more stupid slip-ups. “Great. Glad we settled that.” His voice dripped with sarcasm, enough to have Tony lightly giggling. He could think what he wanted -- the latter meaning a compliment to his wardrobe, but Steve wouldn’t dare feed his ego further.
“One more flight.” Tony promised as they turned the tight stairwell corner. Shield at the ready, Steve stepped onto the landing, situating beside the exit door with an exhale. Gloved fingers curled around the handle, but Tony stopped him short, squeezing his hand. “Five agents. Two left, three right.” Eyebrows furrowed behind his helmet, straining beyond the thick metal door long enough to hear faint scuffs of boots against concrete.
“Any idea on numbers?” It felt like there was no end to them; Tony must have already killed more than a hundred, and yet he couldn’t find a visible break in the flow.
“Uh, and cook.” Tony added, fingers lightly clinking against his mug. “Do you know how sick I was of chinese takeout?” Steve smiled, lightly nudging Tony with an arm.
Steve had to trust that much.
you fall!” Tony snapped, eyes clouded with more emotions than he thought he had. “He didn’t slow down, he didn’t turn. He let. You, fall.”
Natasha stared at him a moment, and then smiled softly. “We are both new at being on a team, and we’re going to make mistakes, for sure. In any case—”
them, but they were an ‘emergency response team’ so conceivably they should have someone around in case something happened. Clint made a face, but seemed fine with it.
with Steve and Tony, like they were orbiting each other the way that Natasha did her best to orbit her super-secret girlfriend.
But there was no Tony this morning—just Steve, setting the counter up in slow, excruciating motions. Clint sighed.
Waves. Near the canal. Ste-Virn stood up, firmly ignoring Anotoni’s pleading whine, and made his way to where he knew the canal was located. It looked like it was solid rock—until he managed to get right up against it, and hear the hum of electricity and machinery behind one section.
public surfaces in downtown New York City) and staggered after Steve.
“Whatever you say, Colonel,” Natasha sing-songed.
Apparently, he wasn’t smart enough to do the same for himself.
Steve swallowed his distaste and nodded. “Yessir.”
“Yeah,” Clint drawled, and hoped the ‘prickling’ sensation of sweat at his hairline was in his head and not real. “Is that why you came here? To look for them?”
Tony’s face appeared around the corner, eyes shifting nervously back and forth between them, even as he paused on the outside of the room. “Alpha?” he asked quietly.
Barton craned his neck to try and look around the corner, and then he pushed his finger into Steve’s chest. “You make sure! You make
“It’s very kind, what you said.”
“Well, it’s not like you guys did anything to prove otherwise,” Clint grumbled, but he bumped his shoulder with Natasha. He knew making connections for her was hard—which was why he wasn’t prying too hard into her sorta-not-really-girlfriend.
He needed to figure out how to have Tony safely and normally interact with the team, especially since at least four out of the seven of them were enhanced in some way. He also wanted to figure out what drove Tony to join the military in the first place, particularly because people didn’t just
The omega’s—
Natasha had been stationed at the door, as befitting and proper as the SiC alpha in a military unit, and her eyes were wide, teeth clenched tight. Steve was fighting not to say a word, not to do anything that would upset the man—because this was Tony’s guardian. This was the man Tony’s father had chosen to take on guardianship and protect Tony from people who would treat omegas like meat, like open markets.
“I never met a bigger bunch of prudes until I joined your team,” Tony’s voice came, sounding bewildered instead of upset. “But you don’t need to apologize. Obie is… what every alpha is supposed to be like.”
“No, I—it’s fine. I’m fine. It’s all—everything’s fine. I like. It.”
Blinking, it took him a moment to really see what was going on. Clint was berating Steve, and Steve was arguing back—
He could probably put the Asgardian envoy here. It wasn’t huge, fit for a prince, but it was definitely bigger than the other ones.
Besides, the two of them probably wanted to…reacquaint themselves with one another. He didn’t need to be around for that.
The omega hesitated, looking from the room around them to the door.
Docking was easy; he didn’t need to hide behind his cover here, or invent reasons as to why he was on planet. Zhar was peaceful and had a decent showing in the Republic; all he had to claim was that he was a Jedi stopping for a rest from his travels back to Coruscant and he was allowed passage.
“I can’t sleep.”
Tony rumbled in his throat, and then settled down around Steve’s neck like a scarf, tail flicking against Steve’s cheek and legs hanging on either side of Steve’s neck. A steady tremor—a purr—vibrated against Steve’s spine.
A calming technique, that Saark had only started using when Ste-Virn had finally been removed from Jedi Kulsi’s care and given to Jedi Knight S’m W’Lsinn.
Steve nodded reluctantly. It wasn’t like he
Steve hummed to himself. “Honestly? Yeah, I think you deserved that. You talked disrespectfully about her, about the omega, and walked in as if you were top alpha. You’re not. I am. In fact, I’d even put her higher than you, because I’ve worked with her more often and I trust her more than I do you. I’m not going to try to pull alpha shit unless you try it first.”
“I’m alpha enough to put you
A soft exhale, and then he opened his blue eyes, squared his shoulders, and pushed open the doors to stride confidently and calmly into the circular room.
Barton’s eyes flattened, eyebrows popping up, and Steve fought not to show his wince. Even he could recognize that was very heavy-handed.
“You kriffing
Still…
than washing dishes had been. Washing dishes had been jarring, almost like he wasn’t actually there, that he was just watching his hands do something he hadn’t told them to do. Being at the front, learning the buttons on the cash register and how to operate the machine, he was more engaged, and it helped him focus on the world around him much more clearly than anything else so far. It wasn’t even that hard of a job—Clint hadn’t been kidding that there weren’t many people who showed up, and it was definitely manageable. He felt he was really getting the hang of everything.
“Did it work? Did your initiative work back there? Is everything fixed now?” Ste-Virn demanded—voice still low, so their pilots would not hear the two Jedi squabbling like Padawans.
“Hold up, back up,” Steve said faintly, thinking back to the four real battles they had as a super-powered team—and the fact that, three out of the four times, Iron Man had shown up after the battle had started, and left the minute the battle had ended.
“Did I ever tell you,” Saark said slowly, “why I was given to Jedi Knight Kulsi at the same time you were?”
“What the
The tension drained from Ste-Virn’s body, and he sat down on his bunk, relaxing for the first time in what seemed like weeks even though he’d only been four days on this mission with Saark. “Hey, Byu-Kyonn. B-Ky. What’re you up to?”
She didn’t need
“And I get it, sometimes people just don’t click, but you are hoarding this omega up in your room, you don’t let anyone else touch him—hell, Sharon is kinder to me than you, and Sharon hates my guts. You don’t get to pretend to be an alpha unless you can lead, and you’re not leading, you’re ignoring the duties of an omega, and how you should be treating your team.”
The elevator ride up to Tony’s penthouse was icily silent.
horrific method of controlling omega’s voices was a mechanism called ‘obridle,’ an iron contraption that slid over the lower half of the mouth and pinned the tongue down.
She snorted her beer, making Tony turn around to face them. For a long minute, he stared at them, and they could see his brain ticking over multiple different scenarios—what they were, Steve had no idea, but Tony’s brain was
) something for Steve and Clint (and ‘Tasha, because even if she pretended she was aloof, she was a sucker for Tony’s baked goods) before the start of the day. Whatever leftovers were there, they sold in the store. People had started coming early in the morning just for a taste of the pastries, because Tony really was that good at it.
me to sleep on the bed? Alpha?” Tony asked.
Rumlow flinched a little, and Tony mumbled in his sleep, curling up tighter against Rumlow’s legs.
The omega
Natasha’s phone rang.
Natasha shrugged a little, and they both stared at the stack of envelopes. “A lot of invitations, a lot of very thick letters and envelopes. Should we contact the guardian, set up a meeting? We can’t compromise the safehouse, but we could move to a different area. We could even go to the Stark Industries headquarters in New York City.”
“Look, you guys know—or can guess—what my last team wanted from their omega,” Tony said, voice bored and uninterested. “I didn’t know it wouldn’t be the same with you guys, so I figured if I offered first I would… I dunno, have some control over it. Some say. In any case. Yeah, I just—how much do you know about my dad’s… death?”
He shuffled his way down the pavement, hood up, sunglasses unnecessary at—fuck, at five in the morning—unnecessary except for the fact that he didn’t want to see anyone, didn’t want anyone to see him.
fucking ice,” Clint hissed, even as Natasha turned back to Tony to answer his question.
And Clint! He should have recognized that midwestern drawl. He should have realized. Hawkeye had been joking with him and it had seemed familiar—
He also couldn’t just force-bond with Tony. Not that he thought Tony would disagree—Tony was upsettingly agreeable when it came to being told to ‘behave like an omega’ and had nearly gotten into an actual shouting match with Steve when Steve had tried to explain how dangerous coming between him and Brock had been the day after that fight—but that he had a huge amount of power over Tony.
He stood up and knocked on the table with his knuckles. “Well, you overpaid, so you’ve got an open tab now, you hear? I’d love to see you tomorrow. You got a line of credit, now. You don’t get to say no.”
He hadn’t liked that Tony Stark was descended from Howard Stark. First, Howard Stark was an
Yes, he’d had to write up to Fury on
Well, that was true enough, at least. Enforced closeness created the necessary ties that made mediocre teams amazing and fostered trust and support. However—“Eight people, sir? You only mentioned six, with myself as the seventh.”
His master, S’m W’Lsinn, had told him that the biggest stumbling block was his stubbornness. That he had difficulty changing and being flexible, in the way a Jedi needed to be.
The thing was… the thing was, in these past two weeks, they had actually worked together well. As much as they could, of course—there were quite a few tense moments, and Saark
“We’ll be back in a few hours. And I’ve started looking into what you wanted me to look in on,” Natasha said, nodding at Sharon. “Hey, Sharon.”
Mrs. Qasim turned around to leave and then gasped. “
an omega.
Over the next two weeks, Steve learned that he had to be in the same room as Rumlow and Tony all the time, or Rumlow would get increasingly filthy with his words and Tony increasingly quiet. He also learned he needed to make sure Banner and Tony didn’t stay in the same room too long, because inevitably something would go on fire. Tony, apparently, was a scientific genius who always thought that it was important to try things before reading the safety instructions.
Steve could not help himself, not with all the willpower in the world. He reached out and scooped Tony up and pulled him into Steve’s lap, burying his nose into Tony’s hair.
Saark was going to sneak aboard one of the ships they suspected were stopping over here before traveling elsewhere. They had suspicions but no hard proof, and whenever they tried to subtly ascertain the cargo, through outright trespassing to subtle nudges to people who would know, they were stonewalled or blocked. Someone was expecting them, someone knew they were here, but they knew that shipping lanes ran in particular paths for a reason. The traffickers wouldn’t deviate from this planet because this planet wouldn’t ask questions about a ship restocking food supplies well beyond the standard amount, wouldn’t notice if a few more of the poor and impoverished disappeared (and they
“Eh. Tomorrow’s pushing it,” Stark said, and then he began to stand up hurriedly. “The counter—”
prince of the realm and had actual duties to complete—he looked at Tony, said the word, “Tiny!” and that was how everyone realized that Tony’s height was
He kept the light on, to give Tony light to see by when Tony came out, because while they were both cat shifters and therefore, most likely, could see fine in the dark, he didn’t want to assume and why make it harder than it needed to be, after all? So he stared up at the ceiling, waiting for Tony to come out, and wondering how awkward this was going to be. Steve was handsy in his sleep, he knew this—woke up curled around Bucky more than once, driving Bucky nuts because Bucky was a bear shifter and absolutely hated how Steve’s cat would wrap around him like an overwarm blanket—and he hoped Tony wouldn’t take offense.
“You’re on
It was shameful, how long it took Ste-Virn to puzzle through what Saark had been saying, what he had been implying. What Saark’s plan was.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “I can only say that it was a mistake. A poor one, and one that backfired, no matter how much I thought it would be a good idea at the time. I can think up a million excuses, but it doesn’t change the fact that I assumed I knew what was best, and I tried to do it for you. If there’s one thing I learned, watching you open up and watching you interact with the team, it’s that you can do things for yourself, and you prefer doing things for yourself. My fears and worries shouldn’t have interfered with that.”
And Ste-Virn? Ste-Virn held on tight.
Again, that startled bark of laughter—as if Stark wasn’t used to laughing. “Yeah, it would be an insult, wouldn’t it? A walking anachronism. Hell of a shot, though. Smartass bastard. Okay, I won’t pry. Unlikely he’d be hiding out in a café of all places, anyway.”
know what type of cat Tony was, just had that light scent underneath that was the feline musk Steve was used to identifying cat shifters.
So Tony went back to the café. It took him a while to get comfortable again, but they were going out of their way to welcome him, to be with him, to talk with him, and so he tried in return, and now.
But. Terrible cook. So here he was, doing the job he could remember doing smaller, slighter, fingers rough with the soap and water as he scrubbed and set to dry.
“Talking things out didn’t work all those years ago, why would it fix things now?” Ste-Virn snapped. “Talking never seems to matter, to you.”
Steve couldn’t help laughing.
It hurt, but wasn’t that supposed to happen? If you really loved and cared, you set the other person free and let them be happy?
“What the
Flapping a hand at the door, Director Fury dismissed Steve by saying, “Romanoff’s already prepped and ready. Pack up and head out with her—Banner will be joining you shortly. Rumlow is out on assignment, and Carter’s in New Mexico with our envoy. Barton will be waiting for you at the base. You may not like the assignment, Captain, but I expect you’ll be ready for anything anyway.”
“By now, anyone in that whole quadrant who has any level of money is trying to hire mercenaries to protect their children.” Saark’s eyes were bleak as he looked over the datasheets and datapads that were strewn across the counter as Ste-Virn took notes and shared information with Saark. “No more in-person schools for many of them; the spike in VR-schooling permits is staggering. It’s affecting the overall economy and though the kidnappers have spaced their taking apart erratically enough that there’s no pattern, families are living in constant fear.”

times you were unsafe,” Natasha said, but the corner of her mouth was lifted, even as Clint stared in shock at Tony.
Steve jerked awake, breathing hard, shuddering, and Tony’s light fingers brushed over his hair. “You’re okay, Steve, it’s fine. I’m here.”
“Okay, B-Ky. Thank you,” Ste-Virn breathed.
Now, it worried him. It wasn’t just that Saark was making himself a target—there were
Haltingly, Saark continued, “Jedi Kulsi would have been very good for you, because he did provide that stability. He was very level-headed. He and you were very much alike, in your black and white views. I… had too much of the grey within me. Too much mixed in with the white.”
Steve was suddenly there, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead, and Tony’s mind just—short-circuited. Stopped working.
—and then he slowly laid back down.
Steve smiled politely, putting his hand out and letting Obadiah Stane pump it up and down vigorously. He hated alphas that did that, tried to make a show of force for no other reason than that they could. Still, it was in fact the guardian of his team’s omega, so he would play nice and show this guardian that his omega was treated well and cared for by the team. Though he had to admit, seeing Obadiah Stane up close, hearing the way he spoke... He was having second, hell,
Master W’Lsinn chuckled, and then the transmission ended. Ste-Virn firmed his resolve. He would dock, and he would try to investigate.
But then the omega squared his shoulders and bowed his head before standing up. His feet were bare, and his fingers were twitching nervously against his side.
“Do I ever,” Byu-Kyonn chuckled, voice sparking. “A little hlel, if I remember. Wouldn’t stop snipin’ at you, or you at him.”
A soft huff—almost a laugh—and Steve realized he had said that already. Chuckling self-consciously, Steve rubbed the back of his neck and then reached out to open the door. “Yeah, I suppose I’ve said that already. I don’t know what Fury said, when he assigned you here. He—
Ste-Virn… knew he complained, to his friends, that everyone had an Anotoni Saark story, that everyone had done something with Anotoni Saark. He didn’t realize it classified as
Now, when Steve had seen that, it had been a surprise. Oh, it wasn’t because he was a prude or a purist—he’d seen worse, honestly, even in sexual contexts, while with the Howling Commandos, since two of the group had been omega themselves—but still. The area at the time had been a shared barrack where many alphas would all be in close quarters to one another, and alphas normally didn’t like showing off their Os to any casual alpha passersby. It created unwanted tension, jealousy, and friction, all of which was damaging to team dynamics. He had simply raised an eyebrow but kept on to his bunk.

, brrh?”
“Ste-Virn, the smuggler’s end, yeah?” Saark’s voice was slightly breathless—shorter than Ste-Virn, he almost had to hop to keep up with Ste-Virn’s long strides.
, and not a particularly likeable one at that (not like Bucky). Second, it felt like a part of his past that was accessible… only it really wasn’t. The files had been sealed, Howard’s son hadn’t recognized him for anything other than Captain America—him, who had worked hand in hand with Howard more than once, had relied on Howard more than once, and who, he had assumed, was the one who was looking for him nonstop. Supposedly, it was for the best. But it was just one more link to his past he was denied, one more loss he had to bear.
A moment’s hesitation, then the slightest movement of shoulders to indicate a shrug.
“We’re not,” Steve agreed—he was standing behind the counter, cleaning supplies out.
Swallowing hard and steeling his resolve, Steve turned around and faced the door. Cautiously, he opened the door and looked around.
Everyone knew Anotoni Saark. Everyone had a story. Everyone, that is, except the person who had actively shared quarters with Saark for nine months.
“Of course. I would like to hear more about which two of my suspects you recognized, and the nature of the kidnappings and ransom requests,” Ste-Virn said easily, entering the quarters and moving towards the kitchen. “Water?”
“You okay, buddy? I just want—”
nothing that you said to the Rodians tipped them off to our primary mission?”
Ste-Virn nodded absently. “Thanks, B-Ky. I think—I think I just needed to hear that.”
Natasha snorted.
“I know you were taken by your father to demonstrate weapons overseas. I know that you were captured, along with your father, and only you were rescued.” Natasha twisted fully in her seat so that it was easier for her to see Tony, her knees up on the driver’s seat so she was leaning against the back of the seat. Her eyes, though gentle with Tony, kept darting over to Steve, and that gaze was definitely
“He also had a grieving interim Padawan, one I had looked up to and admired before becoming a Padawan, and one that the Council thought needed someone to look after in the way you and Byu-Kyonn had looked after one another but could no longer do.”
Steve sat up in bed, eyes shifting to meet the dimness of the room until he picked out Tony, curled up on the floor, looking like a child with his knees pulled up to his chest.
“Eh.” Natasha smiled. “Better than others.”
If he pushed any farther, he’d push Stark away—he wanted Stark to come back, he realized very suddenly. He wanted to know what was bothering Stark, and why wasn’t anyone taking care of the civilian that had been caught up in all this. He was having a shitty time dealing with what he did, and he was an agent with access to therapists who understood the necessity of his job and worked with it, and with him.
Tony began shifting, and both Steve and Natasha immediately averted their eyes. Clint, busy tying his shoes in the front seat, didn’t say anything at all.
They’d get this sorted. They were a team, after all, and they were going to fucking act like it if it killed Clint to do.
Was Ste-Virn a Jedi, or was he not?
Saark lifted an eyebrow at him, but then shook his head and seemed to put aside what he was about to say. Instead, he nodded at the door. “Am I invited in?” he asked.
Ste-Virn walked past the practice courts, their training master of old’s voice ringing out, and shame hit him. He was being petty, and angry, and it would not be helpful to the poor people they were trying to save. He stopped in the middle of the hallway, ignoring the younglings that walked past, chattering, streaming out from the practice courts.
Following the tracker had been a nightmare and a half. It had zipped from one planetary system to the next, had almost disappeared entirely. Ste-Virn had ended up calling Byu-Kyonn again, since Byu-Kyonn was excellent with technology and could remotely figure out how to keep the signal tethered to Ste-Virn’s datapad.
With a low, long, agonized moan, the huge section of the wall was shoved to the side, crushed like a crumpled durasheet.
Interestingly enough, when complimented, Anotoni’s cheeks went a deep brown.
He swallowed, and closed his eyes. “And I was wrong. You had every opportunity to contact your guardian previous. You are of age. I shouldn’t have tried to be… overbearing, or controlling. I know and you know that you don’t need that.”
“Of course!” Ste-Virn said, but Master Kulsi was already standing and moving over to one desk that seemed marginally less busy than the others.
Ste-Virn found his teeth were clenched tight, and tried to force his anger to leave. A good Jedi did not hold onto the negativity—or the past. They strove to move forward, taking only the lessons with them into the future.
“I don’t—you don’t like me very much.”
He just had to hope that everything was fine.
“I don’t know,” Ste-Virn said flatly. “You never talk to
“N-yeah, I like, I like NASCAR,” Rumlow answered, voice hoarse.
“No one knows who or what it is, though, right? I asked Fury,” Steve asked, putting the other cupcakes on a plate and covering it with a mixing bowl to keep the frosting from drying out. “It appeared in Afghanistan, disappeared, and then reappeared around the world randomly. I think the alien thing was the first time Iron Man actively worked and appeared on American soil, right?”
Why did he decide to have Natasha set up the meeting? She told him that if Tony wanted to meet up with his guardian, he would have done so at any given point. She told him that Tony had the ability to write, to
“I’m—I’m fine,” Steve stuttered out, forcing the words past his lips, twisting his voice to make the sounds necessary to soothe the omega, because this wasn’t the time, this wasn’t the point, he needed to get himself under control.
Sharon turned on her heel and left the kitchen, leaving Steve with a still-leaking sink and dark thoughts crowding his head.
“Negotiating is how I have these two making the trip to Ryloth. The price is more than fair,” Ste-Virn whispered heatedly as he moved to follow the Rodian into the ship.
Duffel bag in hand, he walked up the steps to the front door and tried the knob. Unlocked. With a mental shrug, he opened the door and stepped in.
That poverty and rejection was showcased here, in the pilot and first mate that were scrawny, hard characters.
With a sigh, he made his way to the larger room and opened the door.
“Of course,” Saark replied, smiling, and he turned that smile on to Ste-Virn.
Steve put trays of the cookies into the display case, and turned to slide in the tray of brownie pieces.
“I know you think I mess everything up—” Saark began, hissing, shoulders tight and tense, and Ste-Virn had a brief vision of a much younger Saark, less controlled, more puffed up, hair ruffled like feathers and hands spread wide and eyes flashing, the room a mess, torn up from their fight. Ste-Virn would punch things, in his anger, and Saark would throw things. It was on that that Jedi Knight Kulsi walked in on, and stared in disappointment at the two young Padawans.
But before she could indicate one way or the other, Barton flapped his hand. “She always knows. She’s a spy, she’s got to know. No, I just go where my handler points me. He told me I was on a team long-term and I didn’t bother to find anything out beyond that Natasha was going with me.”
Steve opened his mouth and then paused. Considered his words, slowly and carefully.

Steve hesitated. “I—I was going to contact Fury, yeah, but—I’m not going to say that it made sense—look, I need you to think about people you’ve known in SHIELD. Then think about his behavior. Is it out of context that he is acting like that?”

Finally, he approached Clint one day as Clint was putting on the apron and humming to himself. “You need… any help in the front?”
Natasha stepped forward, taking Steve by the elbow and walking him away from the tree Clint was sitting beneath. When they were a decent amount away, Natasha said
a guy, Natasha,” Clint hissed, before smoothing his clothes down and saying primly. “I’m manning the front.”
Ste-Virn could… see the merit in what the Council was saying. Two Jedi working on the case would be better than one, and even if he felt a little proprietary since he had done so much work on this case, the other Jedi had obviously been working the same case from an opposing angle.
“I mean…” Tony trailed off, and then sighed. “Yeah, okay.”
“I was. I was, and I’d love to kiss you, now that you know who I am. I didn’t want anything hidden between us, not until—until.”
“My name is Steve Rogers, the head alpha of this team. Did Fury tell you anything about your role here, or your position?”
Steve smiled softly. “Well, we’ll find out soon enough, I imagine,” he said, rounding the corner to the parking garage and looking at the small car they had taken here. In the front seat was a towheaded Clint, scrunched over, and Natasha was talking to him from the driver’s seat.
…Maybe Tony’s old unit had
“Hello, Ste-Virn.”
Then she stood in the middle of her room and forced herself into stillness, remembering the Red Room, the punishments for any display of anger (of emotion of any kind, really, but anger was always the worst one to show). She slowed her breathing deliberately, forced her heart to slow down, calm down.
Ste-Virn almost flinched—almost, he knew he caught himself before he actually did it, but it didn’t seem to matter as Master Yoda stirred in his chair.
“Is he okay?” he asked.
He could.
Gravely, Natasha nodded. “I’ll set it up, and let you know when everything’s ready. But you know Tony’s almost at the point where he can be his own guardian, so it’ll be soon.”
“You aren’t a real alpha, and you know it!”
Those big eyes moved between them, and from the slight tinge of color against the green skin Ste-Virn could tell the money was the deciding factor when Orcantuur grunted and said, “Double, then. And we have a small storage room you can use.”
On Anotoni were restraints—far more heavy-duty than any other restraints—and he, too, was wearing the blissed out expression of a spice user. He also had, around the shell of one of his pointed ears, a complicated metal contraption, almost like a sheathe for the outer ear.
Pepper nodded and rubbed the back of her neck. “That’s—okay. I only say this because he’s been—he’s been so much lighter, with me, with Rhodey. He’s taking care of himself and having fun baking and I just… I hate to see him lose that.”
been disappearing—that much Ste-Virn and Saark had been able to confirm), and wouldn’t care about anything unless the Republic made them care.
to go down and meet the other members, and he hesitated, not sure whether he should instead decide to have the omega stay in the room, and then go consult with Natasha on how to handle team omegas in today’s world. He knew, overall, what to do, and if he was going to confide and look for help from anyone, it would be Natasha, who he had worked with before.
Fury sighed heavily and she could almost
Tony whirled around, and fuck, his vision was so blurry, he must have been hit harder than he thought yesterday, but he could make out the wavering form of Steve Rogers and he ground out—because this was fucking
They were ushered to a car, which drove them even further from New York City, almost to Albany, to a small little city called Coxsackie. They weren’t living in the city proper; more on the outskirts, with a three-story house and a wide yard that opened up into the woods. Better, Steve supposed, for those that needed the space to run and move.
It was way after dinner, and Natasha and Clint had taken Tony upstairs as they were settling in. Tony seemed more comfortable and open with Natasha than Clint or Steve, and Steve could be thankful for that at least.
A soft weight pressed against his thigh, and Steve turned to see a small cat, elegant, dark brown with darker spots, almost like tiger markings, pressing its head against his side. He shifted to make room, and the cat leapt up, light and gentle, into Steve’s lap before climbing—with sharp claws—up Steve’s chest and to Steve’s shoulder.
“Makes you grateful that we were raised here, yeah?” Saark said, really striving to match Ste-Virn’s pace.
Steve narrowed his eyes at the director. There was some game being played here—he could scent it. He may not be the best at manipulation, not in the way that Romanoff was, but he could hold his own in a chess game against her. “That doesn’t explain what we do during our downtime. Sir.”
“I was… not trying to let anyone know.”
If he couldn’t see Tony, Tony’s breed must be small—maybe not even a wild cat, but something domesticated. It was entirely possible, especially since Tony was an omega. Omegas rarely shifted into truly wild animals, and often into smaller, lighter versions of the truly wild species.
Steve smiled at Tony. Tony was curled up on the bench, asleep, and it was only five in the morning on the weekend but for the past… shit, almost three months now, Tony was a regular. He waited for Steve to finish his run, walked in with Steve to the café, and teased and joked and argued about politics and shit until he was blue in the face with Steve.
Then Steve went up the stairs and stared at the closed bedroom door.
Jedi Knight Filliph Kulsi was a nondescript humanoid that easily blended in with his environment. He was, in some ways, the spy master of the Jedi Order—and he had been the only nearby Jedi Knight who could take on a Padawan when Ste-Virn’s Jedi Knight Master died.
“Okay, hold up, hold up—for the slow people in the bunch, can you—repeat this? Make it make sense?” Clint asked.
“Why does Stark matter?”
“I know this is—well, that’s not fair,” Natasha said, cutting herself off. “I don’t know what this is like for you. But I came from Russia, which—while not exactly the same, it might be a little similar. I didn’t have any reference. Fury put me in something like this—not a café, but some type of little souvenir shop, in Texas. And it was the easiest way to practice relating to people, because these customers come in, and they will leave, and their opinion doesn’t matter at all.”
Even Master Kulsi seemed to realize that that was both the best he could expect from Anotoni, and that Anotoni was about to fall over. “Sit down,” he said tiredly. “Make sure you rest. He needs his detox pills; be sure he gets them, Ste-Virn.”
, with these two men?”
Topping off the extravagant and syrupy drink with a mound of whipped cream, sprinkling it with the salt and drizzling it with the caramel sauce, Clint stepped out from behind the counter and placed the drink in front of Stark.
Then Saark turned on his heel and exited their quarters.
“Tony, what—” Steve gasped.
(Seriously, they needed to find another way to communicate that did
of the Jedi Masters were revealing anything—and after a few heartbeats, he returned Ste-Virn’s nod. “You have been putting a lot of hours into this case. You’ve been prompt in your paperwork, and we’re very impressed on how thorough you’ve been. You’re on the verge of uncovering the network of slavers as well as their connection to the shipping company and mining company these slives have been selling to. However, after much consideration, we’ve decided to assign another Jedi to your case.”
Steve fought not to gnaw at his lip nervously. He
could he be?! He talked to them, he knew them, he had thought Steve looked suspiciously like Captain America but also he knew that there were a lot of buff guys with blond hair, and Captain America was all serious, he wasn’t a doofus like Steve—
Closing his eyes, balancing as best he could without putting undue weight on his ankle, he placed his hands upright before him, elbows slightly bent, and curved his fingers as he reached through the Force. Did it swing out, or swing in, or slide in a direction? He felt as best he could to get a feel for it, and then he breathed in deep, exhaled hard.
“So you’ll show up tomorrow?” Clint asked, already walking backwards towards the counter.
Saark trailed off, and Ste-Virn waited, feeling his heartbeat in his ears, wondering. What brought this on? What in the Force prompted Saark to reveal something so… so traumatic, so devastating?
Ste-Virn swallowed, hard, and then looked down at his feet. “I think I… jeopardized the mission, before we even reached Ryloth. I think I tipped our pilots off to the fact that there was something fishy about me, or Anotoni, or both of us. I don’t know. But we landed and we searched, long and hard, for any missing persons reports, any missing child of any missing family. We could not find anyone. None of the slavers who were supposed to be there were actually there. Then, Anotoni had… a vision, through the Force. Or a feeling. He asked me to trust him, and I did, and this was his plan.”
How the
“Yeah. Ah. There’s no fridge, anymore. There’s a cooler.”
That was true; Tony had not missed a single morning, had always cooked (
“Well, not the same time,” Ste-Virn said, because quibbling about technicalities was the only way he could really respond to such a drastic, whiplash change of subject. What had brought this on? He couldn’t see a connection, but Saark was feeling his way through his words as if he was trying to choose the ones that
Clint paused, cheeks full like a chipmunk’s, and he lifted one eyebrow at Steve before swallowing. “Do you think that’s gonna go over well?”
“That’s all I know for sure,” Tony said, and then it seemed like he realized that wasn’t a great answer, or a good one, because he bit his lip and looked down.
and he didn’t want to subject anyone else to that horrible pastry. Before Steve could reach out and grab him, he darted around behind the counter and into the kitchen.
It wasn’t much longer before Tony put the trays into the oven—it really did look like no one had
“I will,” Steve said quietly. “But I also know that Fury probably already knows. Probably put him here so that he wasn’t with that other team that treated him badly.”
ack, I'm sorry this took so long x.x;;
Then he jerked forward and gestured at the full display case. “But here… here I can make things, and it’s not another suit, so Pepper doesn’t get mad, and you guys don’t care that I’m a billionaire so long as I pay for my food, and I like to think I make you guys money, so I’m here. I think I’m gonna pass out now.”
If Steve didn’t think about how Tony clearly was waiting for some repercussions and expected to be treated badly, he might even take exception to that.
Natasha refused to even dignify that with a response. She walked into her room and began putting away her clothes into the dresser.
Steve opened the café door, trying to find a way to say casually, ‘oh, by the way, I’m also Captain America—the guy you think hates you, the guy you said was only special because your dad made him special, you know, that guy? Yeah, that’s me.’ How did you do that? It had been terrifying to admit to Tony that he needed help, but Tony had already… been vulnerable, if that made sense. It was something he could do, could say. It was something he could easily respond to, and respond with. But to just, out of the blue, admit that for three months they’d been talking and Tony had been talking to his entire team of Avengers, just not dressed up?

badly if the omega wouldn’t even voice
Either way, he was trying to stay a decent distance back from the ship, so that they wouldn’t pick up on his small, unassuming (unarmed) spacecraft following in their wake. How this was actually going to get them hard proof that the company was using slave labor, and how he was going to extract Anotoni from the ship, was still a mystery, one he was trying to figure out.
different. I’m sure you can see it too.”
She hunched a little under his gaze. “I got it, I know,” she mumbled.
He’d tell Steve, when Steve was healed enough to come down. Oh, speaking of which, he ought to take the food up to Steve before a random SHIELD agent stole from the plate he made up.
As he tried to convince himself this was a good thing, he caught Master Windu staring at him, expression almost… smug? Knowing, for sure.
“Do you want it to be?” Tony replied absently. There was flour, and sugar. Baking powder. Cocoa powder. Not a lot, but enough. A few eggs and some milk, too. Cream.
“The only thing, and I know it’s big, and I’m not trying to excuse it—but the only thing we lied about was our names. We love Iron Man. Iron Man has saved our asses more than once, has such a unique perspective and has helped us in so many ways, and maybe Iron Man had a lot of problems with the Avengers first, but it wasn’t like the Avengers were all that kind, or in all that great of a place.”
only makes it more surreal and harder to manage’?
“Ah—you guys aren’t open yet. Are you.”
Tony stared at Steve, and then looked around until he saw the sign. Without a word, he walked over to the closet that had been converted into the cooler.
Steve stared back down at the sudsy water.
Rumlow licked his lips and Steve snarled, yanked Tony back a step as he retreated, pulling the omega away.
But he was a terrible cook. He always had been—Bucky had been the one to manage to make something tasty out of half-rotted vegetables and hard, week-old bread. He’d been the one to keep them fed while they lived in the same apartment, and Steve had done the dishes and kept the place clean, and they’d had a good life, sharing an apartment. Until the war, and Bucky left, and Steve… changed.
And Natasha…
But she wanted to tell Pepper first—because she could guess that Tony, once told, would tell his best friends, and she didn’t want Pepper to hear it from someone else.
It felt, many days, like this wasn’t
But Tony was ready, and he knew already what he wanted to do, because he had
Sharon followed him into the kitchen and sat down at the table, even as Natasha poked her head in to grab a set of keys from a set of hooks on the wall.
All Steve had known had come from what he had seen about the tower—built big and brash with the man’s name literally stamped on the side—and the few snippets he heard from junior agents around SHIELD. Then he had met the man, the only one of the team hastily thrown together before the Battle of New York whose civilian identity was widely known, and so the only one with his mask off when they had their debriefing with Colonel Fury, and he had not improved his opinion of the man in any way.
Ste-Virn’s head popped up and he tried to straighten from his slumped over position. With a sigh, Jedi Knight Kulsi sat down next to Ste-Virn on the bench and stared forward.
“He’s an asshole, but he’s an observant asshole, and if he recognizes this as a SHIELD safe house it will no longer
Once alone, Saark moved closer to Ste-Virn. “I get the feeling that something’s not right here. There was no bargaining, no discussing a second person—there’s a bad feeling in the Force, here.”
It was fairly decent—very spacious, with the chimney from downstairs running against one wall, an attached bathroom, closet, dresser, and a large television against one wall. This would be a very warm room, and he considered long and hard for a moment about taking this room instead—he always felt cold, and he always hated it—but the omega was probably already settled into the largest room, across the hallway, and he didn’t want to upset her. Him.
Natasha disagreed vehemently, and so all she did was hum again, this time disapprovingly.
Those were old measures, measures that Steve was
“But you’re not—” Steve began, and then he huffed. “Fine. My back is the most cold.”
Tony blinked, and paused, some of the fear disappearing as he tried to parse out what Steve was saying. “Your… back? Is cold?”
, only Steve wasn’t sure what that something was.
“He’s in the back. I’m out here right now. What do you want?”
Pepper wasn’t resentful, that Natasha was projecting how she would feel on Pepper, but it didn’t change the fact that Natasha still felt that way.
“Thank you. Be safe.”
“What? No—” Steve said awkwardly, reaching down and catching Tony’s elbow. “No, come sit at the table with Natasha. That’s another one of the alphas that will be on the team, Natasha Romanoff. Have you heard of her? And that’s Clint Barton, another alpha.”
The trackers. Saark knew Ste-Virn had been putting trackers on him.
The words niggled something at the back of his mind, and he turned to look at Kulsi curiously. “Master Kulsi, Anotoni told me that he had asked to be added to my investigation. Then he told me that he had been as surprised as me that the Council paired us together. Which one is it?”
Saark bowed formally, Ste-Virn a beat behind him, and then the two of them exited the Council Chambers.
And he did, all that night and the next day, and the next. He worried at the idea like a dog at a bone, turning it over and over, because he might not be comfortable with the thought of interacting with people, but the whole purpose of this set-up was to get him comfortable with the modern world, to improve his ability to deal with the real world, to get him ready to leave and actually have his own place, not live in a tiny shoebox of a room above the café because he couldn’t handle ordering takeout, creating a bank account, using the subway, or any of the other myriad ways one had to function around society without freaking out or getting overwhelmed.
And that gave Clint pause.
He always strove to emulate his first and second Jedi Masters. The both of them had never so much as blinked, regardless of what the universe threw at them.
Clearly, they all needed to check up on Iron Man way more than they had thought.
Dazedly, Anotoni looked down at his hands. “I thought the spice wore off. Clearly, I’m still hallucinating.”
Steve looked at him, and Tony could
Rumlow’s face flattened out, became blank. “Look, you can’t control how teams treat their omegas—” he began, but there was no fire in it. No passion.
She tried not to fidget when Pepper finally came, and did her best to be forthright. To explain, that she had never meant to trick Pepper, never meant to upset or anger her, and that she hoped they could still… see one another.
“You don’t get to do that,” Tony croaked. “You don’t get to remind me of all the times you sat there and
Turning the corner to come to the kitchen, where Natasha was sitting at the table and Barton was perched on the island. Steve stepped forward, lightly tugging his arm away, and Tony released it instantly—and then began sinking to his knees against the wall.
“I know that I’m expected to be at your service, and be of service to anyone else on the team. I know that this team is entirely made up of alphas. I know that Steve Rogers is head alpha. I know that there will be a lot of downtime for this team, and many alphas in a small building, so I am to be available for all alphas, to minimize conflicts.”
Tony let out a weak chuckle and turned his face to press his bruised cheek against the leather. Clint tried not to wince at how that must feel. “Yeah, I guess everyone knows what a fuck-up Iron Man is, huh?”
“I don’t—” Tony began, and then he trailed off, not quite sure what to do or how to respond to that.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m… fine,” Tony forced out, a fake smile ghosting about his mouth and never reaching his eyes. “How are you? Out and about early, as usual.”
Natasha treated Tony almost… in fear. She seemed both intrigued by him and wary, and either was way too close to him or the furthest away. He asked, one time, the two of them sitting on the porch of the safehouse, bored out of their fucking skulls, watching warily as Rumlow was trying to challenge Thor to a cannonball diving contest of all things, while Clint and Sharon egged them on and Tony, all dark skin bared to the sun, wearing nothing but swimming trunks and sunglasses, lounged on the side of the pool.
Steve blinked. “You did?”
Still, he didn’t enjoy the idea that omegas were pretty much nothing but a warm body. No matter how well-behaved and respectful the alpha team was, the omega had little to no say when dealing with the alphas’ ruts, and their heats were almost never really taken care of properly. Omegas knew how difficult it was for them in the military, so omegas who joined were almost always the omegas who didn’t have family, or money, or options. Even with all the claims and contracts, abuse still ran high, particularly in all-alpha teams.
“You asked me to look up on Tony, see about him.”
Steve looked, panicked, over at Tony, who had pulled on his boxers and pants, and was working on his shirt. “I didn’t—the first day, Tony was just sitting in my room, that’s it, nothing—”
