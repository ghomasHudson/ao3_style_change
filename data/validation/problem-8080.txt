The Alurio = The Gata = Kats (and just presume that by the time we water down to simply putting the most simplistic form for "cat" in everything that we've progressed to the modern age, and you're offensive. Peachy keen?).
"Certainly not. I've known Anthony since he was a kit. I am suggesting that his handlers should be under scrutiny. I think we can all agree that Stark is an extraordinary boy, but he has a history of volatile, even destructive, behavior that can and should be curbed by his owner. This nation owes Anthony a great debt and we should have asked a long time ago why that isn't happening."
-Stanislov-
Rhuza, Master Stark. Rhuza Rhodes."
right when Tony’s contented purrs were rumbling in his ear drums and messing up Steve’s head. So the fact that Tony would look at him and think, that’s the guy I trust to win the fight and bring you all home in one piece, it kind of made Steve go a little crazy in the head.
They were calling it Oversight Protocol, borrowed aptly from a controversial piece of legislation that Tony had paid good money to keep suppressed, but was now being rushed through the House of Representatives. Stand Up Humanity was behind Project Oversight, and Simon Trask their pet expert had become the face of it. He’d appeared on more news junkets and on more chat show couches in the last twelve months than Tony or Pepper could possibly hope to combat, peddling the same message each time.
She was in love with her groom Thor was sure – she’d talked of nothing but the tom since her last journey to her home world and had whined incessantly at Mother until she’d approached Bastet about the union – and therefore was excited to begin her life as a part of a mated pair, but she would make that life far from the home she knew, among many strangers.
"Love wins 2014!" Kitty cried with a triumphant laugh smacking a kiss against Peter's cheek.
There are glittering parties full of chains and leashes, painted lips and diamond studded collars.  Everywhere they go there are cameras.
They'd been in the middle of fighting about it actually when another alert had gone out.
There wasn't anything Tony could do about it except pray not to get struck so he completely ignored the pieces of New York real estate falling around him and the screaming coming from below as he kept a firm grasp of control on the hover chair and spread his palms wide.
“Probably more than alright.” He teased, stepping close and winding his tail playfully around one of Steve’s legs when the blond wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist. “Hurts like a bitch, no word of a lie, but in the best possible way. My first time latching with someone I care about in a long time.”
“Fine.” He grunted irritably. He would
“Hey Steve, your ex-boyfriend is a dick.”
Steve’s hands tightened around hers, shock and anger ripping a growl from his throat and Natasha winced but met his angry stare with a stare of her own, hard and uncompromising.
"For the big U.N. meeting. We know."
The ground is shaking as the room continues to warp in and out. Tony brings his hands up, heart racing as he deflects the rapid slashes of the soldier’s knives. Steve and Natasha are there, under his skin, and he’s never more thankful for that as Natasha provides him with the skill he needs to block each strike with the armlets he wears, and Steve’s strength courses through his arms and keeps them steady as each forceful blow sends pain traveling up them and into his teeth.
Kate smiled, but it looked strained to Nyota.
Andre perked up as she entered, his tail twitching on the floor and Tony tensed, a growl building in the back of his throat. He couldn’t help the surge of protectiveness he felt. Princess was an intelligent young woman, but she was still an impressionably young fel from a very sheltered background. Andre was a pampered pedigree tom who knew his mommy would pay his way out of any unsavory incidents his tom-kating caused.
"Queen Anthony. I desire an audience with you." Thor all but bellowed as he entered the lab, deftly avoiding stepping on Dummy as the robot let out an excited stream of beeps and rolled off of his charging station, making a beeline for the Asgardian Prince with pinchers open.
"When you meet a compatible tom your mind begins building links and it changes much, including the chemical composition of your sweat. In essence you begin to smell more like one another. So you see I, as well as every unmated tom in this room, can smell that there is someone in your life. Likely as drawn to you as you are to him."
He's still a child in some ways. He is like Hansel, relying on cleverness to keep faith in an ideal that has already betrayed him in the hopes of one day returning home.
"Your job isn't to arrest helpful bystanders. Leave him alone."
He was aware of the fact that they both needed medical attention. Steve definitely did. He’d taken the brunt of the blast like an idiot. Like Tony was some sort of damsel in distress when he –
She heard Stone laugh, the sound echoing despite its softness.
To the ancient Egyptians the Alurio were children of the Goddess Bastet and as such they were honored as fierce warriors. They became protectors of the pharaohs and royal houses and an elite class of soldier in their armies.
“I’m not afraid.” They whisper against his skin, pressing kisses, biting with possession. “They can’t stop us.”
"Sir, Captain Rogers is asking for access to the lab," JARVIS interrupted, and the A.I. waited until their laughter had died before asking. "May I allow him in?"
Tony rarely conducted business from his office in Stark Tower, mostly because he preferred his workshop and if anyone came to Stark Tower it wasn’t his perfectly decorated office they wanted to see.
“No.” He answered. “You were squeaky clean. Little too clean. So naturally, I assumed you probably ran a Heat House when you weren’t punching out Hitler.”
A moment later Tony was pulled inside of the helicopter, and not that he had any real plan but he came up hissing with claws extended, but whatever fight he could have put up he'll never know because something crashed against the side of his skull and after a moment of blinding pain everything went black.
“Jaime was fine. It’s just hard on the kits when their parents are away for long periods” they try and verbally sooth Steve.
Tony’s smile turned into a full-blown grin as he chuckled, finishing the last page of the report.
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THEY ARE FREE AGENTS?
“You are a good man Tony.” Steve insisted stubbornly as the elevator doors opened on the familiar walls of the penthouse floor.
"I met Agent Carter you know. She told me stories about you. Never danced before my ass."
They are.
“Tony? Are you still there?”
He really didn't. There wasn't anyone standing there who didn't know what a game changer this could be. It could blow the game wide open.
“You did not sleep well.” Wanda comments as the three walk quickly back towards the apartment they are renting. This mission requires becoming natives of this city and aliases that will not be questioned if they should come under SHIELD scrutiny. Director Fury is not a man who takes security lightly, but he is out of his depth. He doesn’t know the enemy was already in his home before he bought it.
“Some would say our entire relationship is indecent,” he remarked dryly, curious what Mrs. Fujikawa had made of the news circulating about their relationship.
“Do you want to run some tests? There may be something we’re missing. Something that could help us with formula six.”
“I’m sorry I scared you. I don’t like people thrusting things at me either. That was stupid.” He apologized, slowly lowering the object, sure to broadcast loudly his intentions.
Chuckling to herself Natasha rolled her eyes, murmuring about how easy he was. And Steve was tempted to laugh, to forget his confusion and his pain and just allow himself to dwell in the comfort of her presence and the surprising softness of her scent, like clean cotton and the daisies his mother used to collect from the cast offs at the flowershop; but he needed to say it out loud. Wanted to.
So after that last one when Tony got a little hot under the collar (literally) and almost blew his own hands off firing one of those strange electro energy pulses out his palms, still in armor mind you, he'd thought that maybe Natasha had a point about becoming a liability.
"You're sure? Steve asked but Tony had already taken flight and headed upward through the hole in the ceiling. Sure enough he found similar holes blasted through the remaining floors all the way up to the the roof.
"I didn't invite him and I'm not sticking around to ask. Can you run?" Her voice was low and strained, sweat beading against her brow the only sign that she was in a severe amount of pain, but Tony felt it hammering against his mind. Even now he could feel the barriers that had always stood between them crumbling away, thoughts that didn't feel like his own whispering in the back of his mind.
Tony remembers the few days that follow with a golden sort of bliss. They trickle through his mind like honey, sweet and smooth. The Roman Torpedo is a thing of beauty and he remembers her like his first kiss, sweeter even than his first time.
"Stark hardly looked fragile to me. Some are saying his actions may have aggravated the strange condition that led to the unidentified woman's death. What do you say to them?"
“You figure out how you’re going to replace the controller you broke yet Minion?” the tom called out. Clint’s pet names for the kid included minion, Igorling, and mini-me. All not that clever (in Tony’s opinion) pokes at how the kid followed Tony around, because Clint was a giant child. Which of course meant the two got on well. Harley spared a moment to turn his head and stick out his tongue at the tom.
And though Tony was currently finding it hard to breathe and there were twinges of pain in his chest as he gasped for breath, mentally he recognized what the smooth flesh under his hands had to mean.
Yes, he volunteered willingly for the Avengers Pride project and he has absolutely no reservations about the potential expansion of the pride that the Resilience Reserve has opened up. It’s amazing that the shelter kats and others like them are going to get the chance to live out the rest of their lives in a peaceful and prosperous environment. Don’t you agree? (With a strong suggestion in tone that anyone who didn’t could just go ahead and find a bridge.)
“Tony, I’m here with Director Fury and Prince T’Challa,” she began poignantly and Tony’s gut clenched in alarm but he forced himself to continue taking his time and not show any of his discomfort or embarrassment. They were the ones who’d insisted on the urgent early morning call and fuck if he’s going to start playing shy just because the Prince of Lies happens to be watching.
“You think I don’t know my own child? It is languages today and I would be a poor father if I did not notice, that every time Teacher attempts to teach this one how to speak an any tongue but his own, he finds a way to disappear.”
“It means more than you know.”
“My thinky thoughts are but sage whispers Brucie, everybody knows that.”
Of course he understood how little power she’d had, just as he could see how powerless Jena Keener had felt in her own way; but he couldn’t forget that however she had felt, Jena had always had more power over her life and the fate of her son than Tony’s mother ever could have hoped to have, just by virtue of her birth.
~*~*~*~
"I don't need you to hold my hand Rogers." Tony spat, ears flattening defensively; because Steve was giving off that hyper aggressive pheromone charged fight scent that warned every other kat in the room that one wrong move and he'd have his claws buried in their ass; except Steve didn't actually have claws because he wasn't a real kat, just some weird superhuman pseudo hybrid cooked up in a lab. His scent glands didn't seem to know that though.
Tony paused mid-read, glancing down to meet the curious pair of yellow eyes belonging to… uh. Okay so Tony didn’t actually know the kids name, but to be fair there were a lot of kats at the shelter and no matter how important Maria’s House was to him, the reality of running a major corporation on top of the growing list of other things he managed meant he didn’t have a lot of time to put faces to names.
“Aye,” Thor grumbled, worry for MiKall twisting in his stomach. “Though my mother loves her as her own and anyone should be honored to align themselves with the house of Odin… the Kǫtrdýr do not approve of mixing blood. Not all compatible species create offspring capable of bonding and this is highly undesirable. A kit unable to connect with the Pride is an abominable thought to the Kǫtrdýr. It comes with much stigma”
After awhile though even Tony's high beams weren't cutting through it and he was in danger of flying into a tree George of The Jungle style and was forced to call a halt.
They decided that the "girls" are the ones who pop out the kits. These are actually fels and if we're talking X and Y chromosomes, gata biology isn't too bothered by either.
"You sure about that Mrs. Stark?"
Steve warns, but it has the effect Tony wants. The soldier stills for the fraction of a second, eyes wide and white with rage, before the ground beneath them heaves and he lunges at Tony with a garbled scream of agonized rage.
“Papa?” she asks as Tony kneels before her.
Coulson had gone to bat for him, and Clint had never been under any false impression that it hadn't cost him. Phil had never told him what deal he'd struck with Fury and part of Clint was grateful that he didn't know and couldn't add that weight to his conscience.
He is thinking of turning on his handlers and that is against his directives. He needs to be recalibrated.
“He said Resilience! I heard him. Did you hear him?!” Tommy demanded, his white ears flicking back and forth rapidly as he all but leapt three feet into the air from his seat.
"Can I get a copy of Space Odyssey please, for my boy?" he chirps, all innocence, twinkling eyes, and fluttering eyelashes. Kat’s can read now, so he probably didn’t need to tell Mr. Allen the book was for his boy, but people get funny when they know you’ve had some schooling. It’s safer all around if everybody thinks you’re just some dumb kitten.
“You’re just as stubborn as I am Rogers.”
"Nobody’s gonna believe that’s a real name." Anya scoffed from where she sat, perched upon the edge of the open tool box under the panel. She was passing up tools whenever Riri (who was helping fix the broken circuits along with T’Cael) called for them.
“Okay. Just like that?”
He'd gone deep under cover, starting with a fake name and a padded backstory on the steps of Maria's House. The backstory was the easy part because enough illegal breeding and selling of kats occurred on the black market that plenty of the shelter's residents had next to no paper trail.
“We are witnessing a marvel.” T’Challa announced, echoing Tony’s thoughts. “These youth are free Alurio. They have been trained in the ancient martial arts, knowledge that has been passed down from warrior to warrior and is now only practiced by the warriors of Wakanda.”
He defies his own code and tells them the story of the White Duck and many others. He teaches them to read even though he has no memory of how he learned himself, and holds their small hand as they learn to write (her) name in the dirt. He is cold and dangerous, like a man whose heart is made of ice, but they do not fear him. He feels like home the way that nothing else ever has. They know that they are his and that if he asked, they would offer their life to him.
Kind of like the sound his mother used to make when she’d been lulling him to sleep as a very small kit only much much louder, Tony thought, and he was so busy gapping at the woman wondering if he’d interpreted that sound right, that he didn’t even think to get out of the way in case it meant she was about to go on the attack; but Steve must have thought of it because he’d grabbed Tony by the arm and hauled him backward by the time the woman had leapt forward.
Tony sneered.
He went still when her claws jabbed into his tender skin in silent warning.
He’d broken the kid’s wrist and was going in for the kill, but then his sister had been there swinging a chair at his head in her red lingerie.
"Sounds like expensive property damage." Natasha countered with a small smile and Thor threw back his head and laughed.
There had been a lab accident. A gamma blast later and Bruce had what Tony like to call a 'rage monster' living inside of him.
Steve looked up, face blotched red and eyes wet with tears that only started to spill when he blinked at Tony in dazed confusion, expression caught somewhere between hope and hunger.
(See the end of the chapter for
He couldn't help flashing back to a time when he'd assumed the exact opposite of Tony and had been proven so horryifyingly wrong sometimes he still had nightmares about standing below, helpless, watching Tony disappear into the black of space. Sometimes it was watching him fall from the sky, too high for the impact not to be deadly, nothing to slow his fall. Steve felt a rush of anger and a strange surge of protectiveness as his eyes flew back to Tony, standing at the head of the room to give his speech.
"Just be careful Mr. Stark." Helen ventured softly. "He sounds like a dangerous man."
Though people didn't like to think of themselves as machines for some (stupid) reason, the truth was they just were. The human brain was made up of highly orchestrated sets of fundamental building blocks, computational primitives for constructing sequences - sequences which when experienced in constant repeat built what they understood to be life.
“A kink you haven’t tried Tony? I’m shocked.” Natasha jabbed from the doorway and Tony flipped her the bird as he pushed up into the kiss. Steve chuckled against his mouth.
“Only if you call me Steve.” Steve answered, taking the offered hand and shaking it firmly.  “Sounds like you lost a bet?"
“That was rescheduled for the end of the week,” Pepper pointed out sweetly, the traitor. “I put it on your calendar.”
“What’s in it for me?” the kid’s tone had turned mulish which didn’t bode well for not wasting time and Tony really wished the barn had been occupied by someone older for half a moment before he acknowledged that perhaps he wasn’t being as careful with this small being and his feelings as he could be. Literally anybody else would have been better equipped to deal with this than he was.
“He’s got a point. The nightmares, when I have them, are picked up from you.” He said, eyeing Natasha closely. She was sitting very still Tony noticed, but her returning stare was steady.
So there he was, heart hammering, coming to the awful (wonderful) realization that he might at that very moment be pregnant with Steve’s child, while the man in question had blushed a furious red, and mumbled some apology about getting carried away and not meaning to hurt him – like he thought Natasha and the others were worried because Tony was some sort of virginal milk maid, scared off by a bit of roughness in the sack. And that’s when it had hit them all. Steve had no idea what the so call mating gland was really for.
“Was last night the first time you’ve gone into a rutt?” he asked gently, lowering his voice despite the fact that everybody present had super hearing and would hear it anyway. “You didn’t seem all that surprised by the urge to sink your teeth into the back of my neck.”
“When did you start giving the orders?” he teased, even though they both knew he’d already accepted the plan because it was solid.
She tugged out of Riri’s grasp, moving across the flight deck even before she’s finished doing the calculations, remembering the man who was her papa but wasn’t explaining to them about how time and space aren’t linear, and how everything exists at once within multiple dimensions.
They were definitely back, and there were more of them this time. For reasons unknown they’d changed their MO and were openly attacking the public, or so the police reports coming out of the crisis area all reported.
There was a moment of hesitation. She’ll never lie and say there wasn’t, because it wouldn’t do it justice.
“His Highness and Charlies scariest angels would like to make a fresh start with us and have suggested the time honored tradition of punching it out. We do need their help so, I think we should consider it.”
“After that night I contacted Killian, he seemed impressed by Extremis even if you weren’t.” Maya was explaining. There was a light sort of bitterness in her words that hinted at old wounds. It wasn’t just the product of a one night stand that hadn’t gone anywhere, but the rejection of her ideas (her mind) and that was far more dangerous.
Hi, I have decided on a posting schedule of Sundays & potentially Thursdays if things stay this steady. With the holidays one never knows so, definitely expect a weekly update on Sunday and if there's time for a bonus you'll know by Thursday.
Tony snorted, minimizing her screen and waving it off to the side in order to enlarge the screens he had currently running multiple searches.
“Viastone has launched into therapeutic technology, Robert offered her a job in the hopes that something good could be scrapped from Ms. Hansen’s research, she is a bioengineering expert.” Ty explained.
"I know it's been a rough year for us, and particularly a rough couple of months at the end; but my promise to you is that none of you are going to lose your home here. In fact I've been thinking a lot lately about the rebuild, about all the ways that we can make this place less of a pit stop between where you're going and where you decide you want to go and more of a home."
YOU SHOULD HEAR THE SOUNDS YOUR SERVERS ARE GOING TO MAKE IN A MINUTE WHEN I UNLOAD THE PACK-MAN VIRUS.
Tony made a face at that and rolled his eyes for Luke’s benefit because somebody other than Tony should realize that his A.I. was the biggest worry wort in existence.
"Tony, come here bambino. I want you to meet my very best friend."Taking his hand she gently tugs him toward the woman who is beaming down at him, lips all a tremble like she might start to cry again. "This is your aunt Antonia."
(Don’t you deserve to be happy?)
Thank you for your continued support on this story. It means the world.
Dude turned and just looked at him, and oh hey, he’s got these weird spidery veins glowing all over his skin and his eyes look like a lava pit, and oh shit!
"Yeah Cap. Wasn't prepared to ride the big coaster I guess."
“Hey. Look at me.” She did, green eyes bright but confounded as if she couldn’t quite believe the words coming out of his mouth as he said, “Those people took something of yours they had no right to take. They were the monsters not you, and you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t struggle to come to terms with that kind of loss.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Part of it was coming from the fat lump of soft baby skin and sweet smelling red wisps of hair that was in his arms, white ears tickling his throat as they twitched, taking in every sound as the infant gurgled happily.
What happened as a result was hard to put into words. At first Tony only felt resistance like he was pushing uselessly against a wall. Then he felt a strange stinging sensation shoot across his sinuses – not overly painful, but enough to make him back hastily away. He swore he could hear the distant echo of laughter, as if someone floors up had left a television on.
“Steve, this is Airman Wilson. Wilson, this is Captain Rogers.” Rhodes introduced the stranger at his side with an expression that bordered on exasperated. It wasn’t considered proper for Gata to seek introductions on their own or speak first unless invited to do so by a master but Steve didn’t care. It said something about the guy though and Steve couldn’t help but smile a bit when Wilson extended his hand and didn’t wait before instructing Steve to call him Sam.
For a moment Ivan stares at the strange vision before him of a kat in an armored suit, wielding a large silver shield with red and blue stripes. There’s a strange design in the center of the star in the middle, triangular and familiar. He doesn’t know why that certainty hits him so strongly, but he knows he has seen this shield before. Or something like it.
“No. This was much needed exercise. I for one have never felt better.”
Tony's Island is roughly around the size of Nantucket MA, and geographically located in the same area. There isn't another body of land out there that size besides Martha's Vinyard but this is where we use our imaginations ;)
Tony closed his eyes, limbs shaking with fatigue, and grit his teeth.
to stop them no matter what, before they hurt people and that was all there was to it. But where would they go and how would they plan to escape with the building surrounded? He didn’t know. He didn’t know enough about his adversary to calculate their next move he realized, and without even questioning it he reached.
The stab of pain Tony felt, remembering Trask and that insulting exchange during the interview, was inevitable.  No matter how often he told himself he should be used to that kind of fuckery, he never really could.
“Awesome. So I know this is the part where you tell me it was for my own good and blah blah blah, but let’s skip directly to the part where I feed you back your balls. Here’s what I want.” Tony leaned forward in his chair, his smile still firmly in place. “I want direct contact with whoever is doing the negations between you and the King. You and the World Security Council are going to pull out all of your little feelers and leave me and my team to handle the negotiations.”
Ha, Tony thought bitterly. He didn’t acknowledge the blatant lie.
Tony deliberated for a long moment before answering.
“Well damn. Okay, easy fix.” Riri let out a long breath. “The SHIELD team is hunting us right? So we just got to lead them to Washington and make sure Steve’s in the right place at the wrong time. Just like before.”
"Is Tony the first fel you've seen go into heat?"
“Did you phone home already?”
“Fine. What are you doing in the kitchen that I bought but don’t
“You’re coming in loud and clear Cap, mostly loud.” Tony’s voice suddenly filtered through the comm and some of the tension in Clint’s gut eased. Tony was alright. For the time being.
“Steve?” Tony called gently, stepping forward slowly with gauntlet raised because it was way past time to intervene.
He reaches out, puts a hand to the surface. Traces web like cracks and tries to see past them to get a decent look at his own reflection. Who would he see if the mirror were whole?
Tony’s eyes were boring into him now.
Tony winced inwardly, feeling like a heel. If the kits were here it was because they’d been rescued from somewhere else, and after last week they had to be unsure of the stability of their situation.
“Bringing the floor down Cap, which means that when it drops you can’t be on the bridge. I’m going to need you.”
[laughter from audience]
The now deceptively simple looking metal disk continued its spin until it collided and rebounded off the door to the stairwell, and back into the silver clad kat’s hands.
This boy is their son. They still can’t believe they get to have any of this, let alone something so terribly precious. They’re still waiting for someone to take it away.
[Interrupts] I think the word you’re searching for is Pride.
"He's fine too.” Bruce quickly interjected. “I won't pretend it wasn't frightening when he started to go down but it stopped. Tony you stopped. You protected him."
“It’s fine,” Rogers immediately returned, though anyone could see it wasn’t.
“He can hurt me. I know Brucie.”
“I’d say the evidence is already pretty compelling,” Coulson pointed out, and Tony glared at him.
He didn’t look up but he knew it was Natasha even before he felt the prick of her nails against the back of his neck. Her steps were soundless and Jarvis hadn’t announced her because she was good. But maybe too good. She had a very distinctive way of moving that Steve was surprised to find himself tuning to the longer they worked together. Or maybe it was just the proximity coupled with the serum that made it so distinctive to him. Hard to tell.
It was always possible that it was just some sort of Afro- Gata pride thing, where it was just a fad to wear replicas from the legends of Alurian heroes, but Tony's instinct said that it was more than that.
“You were bonded with Barnes. And now you want to bond with me- ” Tony began and Steve gripped him tighter, pulled him closer and interjected, like Tony was trying to say they should just forget it.
“Who comes before the assembled today?” Bastet asked in a ceremonial fashion and all eyes in the hall were on the bride and groom. MiKall had chosen to dress in the Asgardian style and was decked out in the finest that his mother’s dressmaker could produce.
There was a crash and they both turned to find that Steve’s chair had toppled and the man himself was marching purposefully around it to get to Tony.
"Ah..." Ty hedged nervously away from Thor's looming figure, but he'd never been one to back down easily and that hadn't changed. "Then afterward. For old times sake? Don't you think you owe me that?"
Tony’s hand stayed raised, posed in wait to tap out the sequence of commands that would open up the files he’d dragged up from the underbelly of SHIELD and all that he’d collected on the Winter Soldier since he’d first realized Steve and Natasha’s inexplicable connection to him and the pieces of the puzzle had begun to rattle inside of his mind. Natasha watched, her eyes fixated on the unassuming holographic file.
"Dragons?" Tony looked up from the weapons table where he was unabashedly examining anything he could get his hands on. He was the only one of them who had been allowed to decline the offer to be suited up on account of already having his own armor.
Bruce like Steve was wearing the standard black tuxedo (Gata edition with accommodation for his extra limb in the back) but it hadn’t taken Steve’s observant eyes long to spot that for the first time in all the time they’d known each other Bruce wasn’t wearing any of his SHIELD issued tags- the ones with the tracking chip embedded in them that warned people about the HULK and let them know who to return him to if he was lost somewhere he shouldn’t be (AKA tried to run again).
“Yep.” She lied, trying for breezy but he arched a brow at her and she knew he wasn’t buying it. Huffing she sagged her shoulders and came clean, snapping. “Fine, no I didn’t. Happy?”
Their parents had fondly coined them all the brat pack because they’d all been born within a year of each other (that and they were complete brats). Kate was the oldest at thirteen and Anya the youngest at twelve.
"Whoa," Tony grunted as he collided into Thor's back. "Who are these guys, and why don't they look happy to see us?"
“Your mother worships Bastet?”
“I dug up everything I could about Winter Soldier. Every last bread crumb,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hands again and latching their fingers together. Steve kept looking into his eyes like he was at risk of falling off the edge of the earth if he looked anywhere else and gripped Tony’s hands tight. “We’ll find him. It won’t be easy but we’re going to do it, and if he can be helped we’ll help him.”
They bound through the trees at breakneck speed, the feet of his mount swift and sure.
“Oh but a bearded Christmas goat is not out of the realm of possibility?”
“Well then, here’s to the future.”
No, it wasn’t the possibility of being outpaced that made Tony so afraid. It was seeing his deigns in the hands of someone else and knowing the damage they could cause and how they could be used to hurt others. He’d vowed never to let that happen again after Afghanistan.
"Don't have to, Rogers. You gave a shit, and you tried. I can count the people in my life who have tried for me on one hand Steve, on one hand, and you bet your ass they don’t always get it right either but they mean everything. Pepper, Rhodey, Happy they're absolutely everything to me. I wouldn't be here without them. That's how I know he didn't blame you.”
Sonia’s pale eyebrows arched. Tony fully understood why. In the fight for gata rights two lines of thinking had emerged. Those who wanted Gata to be recognized as fully equal to humans and fully integrated into society. And those who wanted to recognize Gata autonomy, along with their right to live peaceably somewhere else, but naturally not their equality with humans.
And two, whatever friendship Tony had thought they were building was nothing but lies and he had no one to blame his stupidity on but himself.
"They will learn quickly not to underestimate her." Thor was sure. "Just as they learned today not to underestimate the both of you."
Tony thought back just to be a dick and grinned around a mouthful of fish at the blank stare she gave him in return. "Bruce, like the rest of us, has trust issues a mile wide. The chances of her not being connected to somebody within our bubble are small."
Nyota scowled. She stretched her back until it popped and winced at the soreness there. She was glad they didn’t have to go surface side for awhile. Having the Avengers show up at their sting at ViXon hadn’t been the most fun she’d ever had.
"Great. Merry Christmas to me." Tony grumbled and Thor looked at him, brow furrowing deeply.
His mouth curling into a slow smile Tony turned over, shuffling until he was facing Steve, their knees bumping.
He’d harassed Clint into joining him that afternoon because the archer needed it, and because Steve knew that out of all of them, being left out was hardest on him.
They’re excited now but wary of her teeth as they urge her to push.
“SIR, there is an incoming – "
Tony smiled winsomely at the man and leaned back in his chair.
"Tony." Natasha winced at the sound of Steve's soft entreaty. Tony stepped backward, as if Steve had tried to touch him and Rhodes shook his head firmly at Rogers.
They stagger from the jeep, gunfire and bombs exploding in their ears as they scramble for shelter. Their heart is hammering in their chest as their nose fills with the scent of blood and death. Smoke and sand cloud their eyes and a high whine fills their ears as a missile arcs through the air and dives into the sand not far from them.
~*~~*~
When Tony is two he asks his parents why he doesn't have any grandparents.
But fuck it, Tony went to the galas and the board meetings and all the charity balls for only one reason; because he wasn't going to let them take away what he'd fought for on a technicality (you'd be amazed at how many times those words mentally unfit have come back to try and bite him in the ass) and he won’t allow any of them to forget that Howard may have opened the door but Tony was the one to blast through the glass ceiling (because why walk through a door when you can fly).
“That’s heartwarming coming from you Stone. Is there anything else you or Ms. Hansen can tell us about AIM?” Rhodes asked and Hansen dug in her shoulder bag before extracting a small flash drive. She got up to give it to Stark but Natasha intercepted her, extending her hand with an acceptably friendly smile to ease the exchange along.
“It’s an interesting proposition, but this team you’re offering. Helen only works with Gata.” Tony explained flatly. He was intrigued by what T’Challa was proposing, to put it mildly (because, are you kidding! Collaborating with the leading minds in Wakanda might have literally been a wet dream of his) but in the game of negotiation the trick was to lay your groundwork early.
It’s too late she thinks as she backs away from the machine, that excruciating light assaulting her eyes, and the overwhelming heat singing at her skin.  She stumbled away from the machine and reached desperately for T’Cael, pulling him close in a tight hug.
Tony and the team deserted the celebration quickly, Tony only pausing to pull T’Challa aside and demand that he and his team follow them back to the tower as quickly as they could. Pepper wasn’t pleased with the turn of events but in this instance her anger wasn’t directed at Tony. She knew better than anyone how this turn of events could spoil their plans. She had damage control to do through the press, and the Avengers had to figure out what was going on at Oscorp and who was behind the sudden appearance of Gata mercenaries.
"So it was your call." Fury rounded on Steve in a way that suggested he'd found someone to blame and that's all he cared about, and Tony bristled but Steve wasn't exactly a wilting flower. He met Fury's hard stare with one of his own and answered with a stubborn set to his jaw.
She'd always liked the winter. The beauty of the ice and the prisms contained within at the touch of sun. It's honest. One of the few honest things in the world.
Tony's head was warm as it settled back in his lap, the warm muzzy scent of him was thick around them but pleasing, like a spiced drink wafting sinuously in his nose. Bruce couldn't imagine being angry about very much.
T’Challa and his three body-gaurds on the other hand had stripped down to their underclothes and were only outfitted in what small manner of weaponry they’d been keeping concealed on their persons. And yet T’Challa seemed at ease, as if Princes were seen in their long-johns every day.
He's nodding as above them a window opens and a woman pokes her head out with a gasp and a shriek.
Tony’s eyes flicked over to where T’Challa was standing with Nakia. It wasn’t just Tony’s technology he’d recognized in the security footage. The prince had remained silent through the debriefing, his expression even now stoic and unreadable, but it was in the eyes really. Those dark eyes with their flecks of color were soaking it all in, missing nothing.
Tony sneered disdainfully, turning toward her.
Tony respected Natasha’s choice to keep Ivan private and not to share with the others that he wasn’t as dead as she’d once thought. It hurt that she hadn’t trusted him enough to share it but, whatever, that was her prerogative. However, he wasn’t going to let it drop completely when this mystery could prove dangerous to her and Steve. That was where the line was.
"I hope you don't mind. Mr. Barton has been sharing stories of your exploits. You Avengers seem to live an exciting life." Luke explained and as the tom took another sip from his mug Tony sniffed, recognizing the rich scent of his best Columbian coffee. He turned and gave a grinning Clint the hairy eyeball.
Bruce took a breath, thinking of turning around and just continuing up to his own floor (he was pretty sure he still had some of the tea in his own cupboard) but Steve blinked, drawn by the slight movement and looked right at him. He smiled thinly in greeting and Bruce returned the gesture nervously, slouching past Steve's chair over to the cabinet where he kept his tea because it would have been even worse at that point to try turning around.
And while he could appreciate the cruel irony of losing Pride over a thing like pride, he wasn’t going to play that game either.
It wasn't unheard of, just rare. Even Howard, who had been wealthy enough that people might have looked the other way, hadn't bothered to claim Tony while he was alive.
“Hey there, Sleeping Beauty,” a tired voice called for her attention and then Tony was there leaning over her, his presence slotting some missing piece back into place and she sagged in relief, the fingers of sleep grasping at her. He should be on the cot beside her. He was blood stained, bruised and burned, but somehow he looked better for it. A dangerous beauty in the wildness of his look and smell. A rightness. There was something awake in him that hadn’t been before.
The guy's tail, having a mind of it's own like most, was trying to curl tightly around Tony's legs like an extra arm, the metal barbs catching on the thin material of his under suit.
While Tony had spotted more than a few kats on collars and leashes, there were plenty of bare throats in the room and the whole vibe was just... different. Warm somehow. It was just in the air he guessed, the air of people who had been coming here for years (in some case decades) who had seen good and bad times together, seen new comers come and go, and weathered all the changes just to come back to this spot. A safe place.
“Sorry Kiddo, looks like the funs over. Women can be awfully delicate Tony but you can’t fault them. Truthfully I wouldn’t have it any other way. That’s what we do as men, we protect them. It’s the most important honor, isn’t it, protecting your house?” Obi winks at Tony and ruffles his dark head of hair and says to Hughard without looking away from where Tony is working, his fingers black with engine grease. “He looks more and more like Isiah every day. They’ll see it too. But We can path his way. We've got to.”
"Why not both?" Tony mumbled around a forkful, gesturing for Steve to reclaim his position on the couch. Steve had even remembered to spoon extra capers into his portion of sauce so Tony figured a reward was in order and there wasn't a tom alive that didn't like a lap full of kitten.
Sure, even if she’d been crazy enough that night to drop the kit off at the local workhouse Tony could have found him, but the thought of Harley having to go through even a minute of that kind of trauma made him sick. So yeah, leaving him had never been an option.
She left it like that, like it was final and maybe someone else would have asked her how she was sure or tried to reassure her with some platitude about finding a tom of her own one day but it was so clear to Steve, in her finality, in the wound that she was allowing him to see. And she was
Tony began to smile.
“Mmh, well technically it’s platinum coated in gold alloy, but since it’s the cost I know that’s turning you that particularly pallid shade of disapproving, we’ll concede that point.”
Tony watched as JARVIS attempted to restart the device, the screen blinking through the seconds as they waited in anticipation for it to connect to the tracking device he’d slipped it onto Catman’s suit during the fall when the tom was sure to be nice and distracted by keeping them both alive.
“For you? Always.”
Hughard’s memory is full of words. If Tony could set fire to the perfectly impressed picture shows in his mind he would have set his brain ablaze years ago to burn out all of Hughards speeches and rants and cutting remarks. Quips and quotes and shouted demands.

"Of course, Ms. Romanov. Do you think a queen shares his heart and opens his house unless he is sure of absolute fealty? It is the way of man to befriend another in sunlight and betray him in darkness, but to bond in the way of the Alurio is to agree to walk in the shadow of another's heart where nothing can be hidden."
So it was fair to say that Cint liked him well enough as a person but he'd never loved Tony. Which was great, because Tony had never loved him either and Clint was with Agent now so all is well that ends well.
"Not even for being human?"
This really annoying kid Eugene Thompson had groaned and complained that Peter only wanted to go to Stark Industries because he was a Kat. Eugene’s dad said that Tony Stark was overrated, took credit for the ideas of others and thought far too highly of himself. That had made Peter really mad and he and Eugene had gotten into a fight about all the things that Mr. Stark had invented that absolutely nobody could take credit for, and their classmates had jumped in too until even Eugene had reluctantly had to admit that Tony Stark was pretty amazing. For a kat.
He could feel Bruce smiling against his lips as he kissed back.
The floor plates it was then.
He would not make the same mistake with his new friends.
That was enough to make Tony crack a smile. Natasha really was all heart sometimes.
Maybe a payment from TERROR R US, his inner Clint supplied and Tony hated himself just a little bit for having an inner Clint at all. He heard Clint yammering away in the kitchen even before he’d walked through the door but he came to a complete stop when he walked in and realized that their resident archer wasn’t alone.
T’Challa and the thunder god shared an intense moment of stare before he nodded magnanimously and answered loudly, likely for the benefit of their tense audience, “Of course. Such caution speaks well of queensgaurd.”
She saw now what Luke had meant, about the bonding being deadly, because there was no way she could get caught in that and break free. Tony would either take her in or take her down and she knew better than to put faith in his abilities just then, because he wasn’t in control of this. Maybe extremis was working in some ways. Maybe it fixed whatever was blocking Tony’s reach before, but now his mind might as well have been an open nerve. This was his subconscious grabbing at anything in reach, begging not to die alone.
I'm sorry this is so late. It's been a rough time. I'm sorry there's no T'challa in this. There was supposed to be a whole other segment but things being the way they are I decided to just post what I have done. The title is taken from Jason Mraz "I won't give up", which is a great song coincidently if you're having a rough patch. At this time, unfortunately, I'm not sure when the next update will be.
This medic was in Walmart clothes but he wore them like a king would. Easy as breathing.
When the door opened to Steve’s room he didn’t look up from the sketchbook he held clutched between his hands. He didn’t know how long he’d been in here, slowly flipping through the old pages. Could have been minutes. It felt like hours.
What he hadn’t expected was the smell that hit him as soon as Mr. Stark entered the room and the tingle that went up and down all over his body and itched in the back of his skull. It wasn’t bad. It was anything but bad. It was spicy and warm in a way that reminded him of Christmas and hot drinks before bedtime, but metallic and edgy too. Dangerous, like he was in the room with something wild, and it made the hair on his tail stand up.
he thought.
It hadn’t really occurred to Tony either (he isn’t without his own prejudice) but that wasn’t the reason he froze like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming semi. No, he froze because the handsome tom flanked by two frankly terrifying looking she-toms in sleek black body-con dresses was none other than Luke. Or (not) Luke he should say. Not Luke at all, because apparently, Luke just a lackey spy from Wakanda, was actually Prince T’Challa. Unless they had a completely non-western view of gender in Wakanda.
Tony and Harley hiked through the snow across a wide field to the back door of what some might have called a charming little farm house, but Tony just called an ageing dump in the middle of nowhere that didn’t look like it even had running water let alone a satellite Tony could rewire; but never judge a book by its cover and all that because peeling paint and rotting floorboards on the back porch or not, the house did get cable.
"I asked Isiah and he told me that if I'm my mother’s son, then I'm a Jew. If I am my father’s son then god help me." Tony snickers into his hands because the expression that had been on Uncle Isiah's face still makes him laugh. Over by the stove Ana chuckles and Jarvis clicks his tongue in disapproval at them both.
"Alright you wildlings!" A sharp whistle cut through the excited voices of the children who had crowded around the team, who were currently sat in the middle of what looked like a wrapping paper apocalypse. The gift giving had gone relatively smoothly, with only a few mild rebukes for grabbing, impatience, and attempted biting.
Rhodey had offered to come with because he’s a good friend, but Tony had declined, privately grateful that nobody he cared about was going to be watching on while he faced all his old demons.
"JARVIS  and I are on the hunt to solve the mystery of our cat-costumed vigilante. JARVIS did most of the coding himself for the audio defragmentation device. It strips the sample down to pure notes and then we put those notes through our algorithm which mathematically matches them to the closest matching digital sample, within a margin of five percent difference. Which is what allows us to also catch family members who may help us narrow the search. So in theory if Catman or any of his direct kin have ever so much as used a cell phone, we're going to find them."
“Who me?”
“Doesn’t that imply that tom-kats aren’t people though?” Steve questioned with an arched brow and a smile tugging at his mouth and Tony laughed.
Please don’t, he thought privately. Thankfully Sam didn’t seem inclined to ask, shaking his head with a chuckle as he teased.
So there was originally a scene between Tony and Thor in his workshop that I cut, because while entertaining and informative, that same information will be covered again in the next chapter and it was very different in tone from the other two portions in this one, making the chapter longer than it needed to be. But if you'd like to read fun times in the lab with Bruce, Tony, Thor and Tony's robots I can always post it as a separate piece.
While one corner of Tony’s brain was cataloguing everything he could, the other half was panicking because Clint had just taken a serious wallop and their quarry had turned to escape in another direction.
Today was going to be fun. He could already tell.
While Thor had never had his brothers gifts when it came to subterfuge he'd never resented or feared them the way that some had. Wars were not won with brute strength or numbers alone. It took a marriage between minds like his and minds like Loki's (like Tony's).
“It’s the way it has to be.”
That had been Howards problem. He’d never been able to handle the idea of falling behind, not even to his own son. Especially not then.
Stark two.
“His hair is longer now” she commented idly as if the man’s hair style were the most important change of note, her gaze softening with sympathy as Steve sucked in a shuddering breath.  “But that’s Ivan.”
M.O.D.O.K.'s fragile little body was heavily armored however and thus very well protected. But Tony had a few surprises left up his own sleeves yet.
Tony’s watch beeped threateningly, a warning from JARVIS scrolling through the screen that Pepper and Happy were waiting in the car. He somehow managed to get to his feet without stepping on a child and grumbled at the protest of his bones (because floors were for the young, ouch) and waded through the shifting pool of little bodies dogging his steps until he was standing in front of Bruce.
“And the nightmares. Have you had any more of them?” Tony prodded gently and the smile turned wan as Steve shrugged and glanced away.
“Don’t you know anything Tink? It’s obviously some kind of dinosaur.” Tubby said.
The tom blinked and his focus snapped back to Tony, those strangely enchanting dark eyes with all their different flecks of color and hints at gold, boring intently into his with purpose, and damn him but Tony couldn't help but feeling a bit like prey cornered by something wild.
"I didn't mean to offend you Mr. Barton. My country is very different from yours. You and your pride are very interesting to a lot of people. I'm only curious how it works."
“Yeah well you did kind of throw this dinner in his face.” Tony reminded and T’Challa chuckled again, nodding graciously in acknowledgement. He could afford to be gracious. He’d arranged for dinner to be catered by Carbone, New York’s finest Italian-American restaurant (which definitely didn’t cater to just anyone) and with the garden surrounded in fairy lights and the music softly drifting over the sound of the tinkling fountain wasn’t enough, the guy looked unfairly delicious over candle light.
RaTu noticed it as well but didn't comment, inclining her head in acknowledgement of the unspoken .
He does stop but he doesn’t move far. He stays pressed close, his nose an inch away from Tony’s while they both struggle to breath.
"You think he was hitting on me? But he's a -" Steve faltered, realizing belatedly that he still had no real idea what Sam’s designation was.
Shame, followed quickly by a wave of anger, flooded through Tony, recognizing the play for what it was, and when he met Natasha's eyes he could see that she was aware, and it just made him angrier.
“Alright, short-round.” Tony clapped a hand on the kids back. “I gotta talk to mom and you’ve got a lesson with Bruce. No more stalling. Hop to.”
So why do you call me Captain, but you keep calling him Tony like you’ve known him for years.
“Well, perhaps not all,” T’Challa conceded with a chuckle. “Definitely one.”
“I’ve never liked coincidences.” Natasha murmured darkly.
When it worked it worked beautifully, the two of them seeming to share the same mind. Tony anticipating his commands before he gave them, appearing right where he needed him as if by magic. That symmetry reflected itself in the rest of the team, until they almost resembled the way T’Challa and his body guards had moved together. Like one animal.
“Natasha?! Is it him… is it Bucky?” Her name seemed to punch its way out of Steve’s chest, and the fel blinked slowly at the sound and turned toward him.
“Well if we're hunting baby dragons I'm not going out there trussed up like an idiot. I’m good with just this.” Clint grumbled, shrugging out of the armored plates and letting them clatter to the ground. RaTu watched him curiously as he reached for the bow he’d set on the long table beside him.
little Nyota stuck her tongue out at Jaime, with a shit starting grin if Tony had ever seen one, who glowered at her and made like he was going to try and shove more sand in her face. The third kit, a shy looking boy ducked out of the way before he could be trampled in the middle of the squabble.
Ah, there was that teasing streak that Tony had been expecting. Not missing exactly, just expecting.
Steve and Tony are going to usher us through the Winter Soldier arc, and then Tony and Bucky are going to dance us through Age of Ultron, and finally T'challa and Tony are going to take us through Civil War. I really like what I've planned for Pride Avengers and Tony's development as a Queen through those arcs and of course hope that you do to.
But they quickly figured out that a few centuries of vigorous domestication does a thing to the body. None of the adult gatas they tried to train could develop aggressive behaviors or mindsets and the domestication drugs had fried their ability to grow claws, which I'm sure you can guess didn't fit in well with the grand plan.
“Thanks but I’ll pass.”
explosions of a rifle, and the sounds of returning gunfire. Quickly he righted himself, repulsors at the ready as he turned and dove back into the fight. The man wielding the rifle was big, clad in a hooded jacket open to reveal the armored vest full of knives that he wore strapped to his chest. He wore a black mask over the bottom of his face, dark pants and heavy combat ready boots with a series of strategically placed holes.
"Iron Man! Status?" Steve's voice snapped over the comm, tense with fury and worry and no clear winner between the two.
T’Challa’s smirk blossomed into a full-blown grin as the tom laughed, the corners of his eyes crinkling with mirth. Tony heard a purring sound a pleased thrill shoot through his belly, before he realized the sound was coming from him. As soon as he acknowledged the strange feeling, T’Challa’s gaze went just that little bit sharp, his whiskers twitching as his mouth curled into a fuller smile that reeked of smugness.
It was just a dumb joke. There was no reason it should hit her as hard as it did, when there were a million and one other reminders every day, but Nyota’s breath hitched in her chest, and by the time Jaime pulled her into a hug, the sob she was desperately trying to choke down broke loose.
Well then, Tony blinked at the unexpected turn. That was just fine, catch the stupid bird, get the materials and go home, except...
Tony was aware that what he was speaking to was a hallucination, dragged up out of Steve’s subconscious, but nothing had made more sense to him then the realization that this was what frightened Steve the most.
"You know, I expect this lecture from Fury, Coulson, hell Cap even, but you're the last person I expected to be all about team bonding. Fury must really give out an amazing Christmas bonus if you're willing to push this hard."
"Their numbers dwindled, their kingdoms scattered Namer called all of the clans together and asked who among them would be brave enough to journey with him into the heart of their enemies nest.
“You’re full of shit Rogers.”
“How does a guy without a leg work at a construction company?” Clint asked and Tony’s grin widened.
The amusement Steve felt at watching Tony talk circles around the table began to fade as something cold trickled through him. He couldn’t say what caused it exactly. Just a feeling of trepidation. Next to him Natasha had gone very still and was watching Tony very intently.
“What mark are you on?”
Jaime glowered at the young tom, looking like he was going to start an epic scold and Nyota snapped her fingers, drawing their attention back.
of Stark’s every reaction. He twisted and turned, keeping his opponent on the defensive with a bevy of tireless blows, each more forceful than the last. Iron Man held his ground as best he could but by design Ivan forced him back against the wall in increment steps. If it was a test of stamina Ivan would always win. The soldier had no limits. Stark didn’t have the same will power. It was easy for Ivan to see that he was holding back, defending his body skillfully against Ivan’s strikes but making no effort to harm him in return.
“That’s what Tony said. It really doesn’t hurt you when…?”
"That's what you're going with? Not very imaginative but I'll play along. Hi Ty, yes it has been. Not nearly long enough."
“She’s walking into the bookstore.” He announced nodding to where their target was walking into a store across the mall. “Get into your positions.”
“Of course, you are quite young. You might not know. That is alright. There is no shame in the searching Antony. That is why it is so important that I as your teacher ask what questions are stirring here…" he points to his temple, and then once more to the center of Tony's chest. “…and here. And perhaps as we explore them, you will discover what it is you are here for.”
"The fire giants are not the fiercest creatures on Múspell." The little tom rebuked with an angry flick of her tail. "The Kǫtrdýr have lived there for ages and we are neither so big nor so heavily scaled."
Oh right. They were going to bed. Which had made him think of sinking into a pile of soft blankets which had made him think of that day on the beach. Yes. On to bed. Amazing idea. Thor had all the best ideas.
There were still many limits to the types of jobs kats could do and still a lot of prejudice in the work place, but more and more industries were allowing them to work as assistants and aides. No organization had made greater strides than Stark Industries and the kats at the shelter held a special place with Stark. It was as close to an open door as anybody was going to get with a man as guarded as Tony.
"Ah so this is your hero is it?" Ana guesses, shoulders relaxing as her mouth tugs into a smile. Tony feels his face heat as the boy's eyes widen in question.
Gata are dangerous and they are everywhere. One day, they will turn on us, or be used against us by an enemy. What then? The only way to prevent that future was through strict oversight, and the restriction of privileges. No more work. No more school. No more confusing dangerous if useful animals with people.
“We’ll need your help plenty, but you have surgery tomorrow. You need your sleep. Doctors orders.”
“Yes. Tony what you said in Fury’s office-"
“I do not know what to say, since you seem pretty certain of this. Perhaps Captain Rogers brain works differently on account of his unique biology,” the tom murmured after a long moment, a pensive frown still furrowing his brow.
"Thank you for saving my journal," he tries anyway, beaming gratefully up at the older boy. "You have no idea all the work you just saved me. It took me ages to get this far. Course I remember everything but there's just
“Okay so the kid was sleeping, the house was quiet, and Santa had set out to deliver presents with the help of his cyber elf squad and had nearly broken the roof coming in for a landing, which you know could be avoided if Santa weren’t stuck in like medieval whatever still riding a sleigh around. What’s wrong with a jet? So Santa’s going to be in a jet from now –”
There was still time maybe, to stop Oversight and hobble its supporters. But not much.
"I'm sorry about all this. Thor's not sure when our minds will stop reaching into the netherworld, or whatever, to pluck out nightmare visions." Tony offered in apology, guilt twisting sharply inside his stomach as he thought of Natasha, no doubt lying awake in her room even now.
A flurry of shouting and rapid footsteps follow and then Tony watches as the woman comes flying out the door and envelopes his mother in the fiercest of hugs. They cling tightly to one another. And Tony watches with wide eyes as his mother begins to cry and laugh all at once as if the two urges are at war with one another.
“Observation. And after you ignored poor Mika for thirty whole minutes when you forgot you asked to see her yesterday morning, I thought I’d try a different approach.” The pretty young fel answered with a lazy swish of her tail. Tony took the cup from her because much as he didn’t like being handed things from strangers, Princess had felt like his from the first and that hadn’t mellowed over the weeks. It helped that she was also all the things he liked. Whip smart, sarcastic, opinionated and not willing to take any of his shit.
The Osbornes said it wasn’t proper. Aunt May said it was bullshit.
Tony hummed appreciatively, remembering well the bright soothing warmth that had flooded his body the last time he’d had the stuff. The grassy taste left a lot to be desired but it certainly didn’t disappoint in other areas.
"Are you sure? I'm really quite excellent at avoiding things."
"After the war I was going to get us a little house. Something with a big yard. Bucky likes to be outdoors. He wasn't going to have to worry about anything ever again because I promised him I'd take care of him." Steve's voice startled Bruce out of his contemplation. The captain wasn't looking at him, but there was a tension in his shoulders that Bruce thought betrayed his anxiety. There was a faint whiff of it in the air, but Steve was holding his emotions together tightly. "Coulson thinks I should see a shrink."
Unfortunately, the soldier is not inclined to answer. Tony realizes too late that the question was distraction. He misses any tell that might have been there before the soldier twists, out of the line of fire as electricity pushed from Tony’s hands strikes the place where he had once rested. He’s on his feet inhumanly fast, and is bearing down on Tony a second later with two knives in hand.
His broad back hides their view of the flames and they feel inexplicably safe. They know there is no arms so dangerous as these ones, but that also makes them the safest. Their eyes droop with exhaustion.
“Is he still communicating with you?” Steve asked neutrally. Way too neutrally to be anything but bullshit. The whiff of pepper Tony caught in his nose told Tony everything he needed to about how Steve felt about that notion.
Steve added and a kit with sun-streaked brown hair and indignantly flattened orange ears groaned like he'd just been ordered to his room without dinner until college.
“And I am the King of Sokovia.” Pietro rolled his eyes. “You’re not fine, and when Pierce and the others notice they will terminate you.” Or worse went unsaid.
"Wilson seems like a nice guy, but it never hurts to remind people what the score is." The fel murmured in reply. His scent had taken on a slightly possessive edge. Steve blinked in surprise and then barked a laugh.
“Is it made with tuna fish, Cap? Because I don’t think it is.”
Yes, okay Steve’s past lover wasn’t his favorite subject in the world but they could be adults about it. Barnes was a huge part of his past that he’d had next to no time to deal with. There was a lot Steve probably hadn’t dealt with. Tony was no therapist but he was pretty sure talking was supposed to be good.
"I didn't know you two were seeing each other".
“He doesn’t like being handed things,” Natasha spoke up from the seat beside him, steely green eyes fixed on the stranger in their midst. “You’re new.”
Whatever it is, the point is, Bruce is his friend and that's more important to him than the whole Pride thing, and for Tony  that's everything.
“But I thought they didn’t find you Jaime until after they brought Uncle Bucky back?” T’Cael asked, his brow furrowing deeply in thought.
Sometimes Mr. Banner will have friends over and everybody will be drinking and Becca will be sitting on his lap, lips curled around the mouth of a bottle as she tells the story of how Brian made her seduce some fancy tom. A tom who’d fucked her through her heat and given Mommy a near heart attack when he was caught balls deep in some back-alley trash like her.
Some of the liquor dampened his fine whiskers and he wrinkled his nose, resisting the urge to twitch the moisture loose. The less you reminded people you were different from them the better and sometimes restraint was the better option. The last thing he needed was Mrs. Kepple rushing over to coo at him some more.
“I don’t think I can eat.” Steve admitted quietly when they parted, staring down at him with wonder and Tony nodded in agreement. He wanted to be bonded with him. Yesterday.
It was one of Tony's new models, and it was amusing in its own ways to watch his eyes flicking over the sleek body of the aircraft, like a fretful parent before sending a child off on their first day of school. But she arched a challenging brow at him anyway, hoping to deter him from suggesting she take one of the older air crafts. She loved to fly, though she rarely indulged in it purely for pleasure's sake, and she did threaten her best friends life for a chance to fly the thing. It would be a shame to waste a perfectly good threat.
Actually Donny was kind of a bore, but he was a staunch supporter of gata rights so you took the good with the bad.
For the obvious reason, Sound Of Music is a very music influenced body of work. FIOT and I created several playlists just for our writing and brain storming sessions. In keeping with that tradition I created one for this story. When naming this fic it was a battle between the two songs that resonated most with Tony's journey and what I was doing: Memory, from the Broadway musical Cats and Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat. Obviously Memory won out but I am providing links to both as they are lovely and you might as well get the full emotional experience.
Some of the best parts of Tony weren’t in his head at all - his wicked sense of humor, the way he always threatened his bots and bantered with Jarvis. The way he’d built a tower fueled by clean energy and welcomed a bunch of rag tag hard luck cases in and made them family- and one of these days he was going to really hurt himself, and that really bothered Steve because…
Luke join him in laughter, and Tony was high on the thrill of anticipation, proud of what he and JARVIS had accomplished and happy to be sharing it with his unexpected new friend. True friends came by Tony slowly but Luke was shaping up to be one of them. And as seemed to be Tony's nature, he wondered if there wasn't some way to keep him.
Tony had wondered much the same and had a few theories.
“Depends. He’ll be looking for signs of where they might have taken me but you haven’t been dark long enough for him to think about looking for E.T.’s distress code… you’re our eyes on the facility and without being able to contact you it’s guess work. The could send someone as a scout on the chance that I was taken here. It’s what I would do.”
"Don't make the mistake of thinking he's just a brain without a heart Steve. Stark is going to die of empathy just like the rest of us. He expects to be standing alone when it happens."
“No buts. I need to take care of these guys and I can’t do that and worry about you at the same time. If these guys are still here when your mom gets home what do you think is gonna happen to her?” It was a low blow maybe, but the only thing he could think of to get the kid moving and make him stay where it was safe. Tony wouldn’t have in the kid’s shoes, not for anything less. Predictably Harley’s eyes widened with fear.
Maybe not. Except he had the sneaking suspicion that Tony didn’t really want that.
What had Tony said the guy’s name was? General Prokovic. It sounded Russian. Maybe it had something to do with Natasha’s past. He didn’t know, and he’d have to figure it out later because purposefully chosen distraction or not, the realization that Tony might be slipping into another heat definitely needed to be handled.
He drained the cup, smacking his lips and flashing the mouth T’Challa’s way just to appease him before setting it on the table with a clunk. Tony sank back into the couch cushions with a sigh, thinking what an odd turn the night had taken.
Indeed, Thor had a large bowl in front of him and was happily shoveling what looked like some sort of stew into his mouth.
“Minimal damage sustained Sir. The suit is still running at 100% capacity.”

"The trail is cold on the terrorists. The parts salvaged from the trucks traced back to a company in Tennessee that sells to just about everybody. Nothing to narrow down the list." She finally answered and Steve listened intently, rising to his feet.
That couldn't be true could it? Tony couldn't think he deserved to live less than they did, could he?
“Not nearly. Have dinner with me tonight and we can discuss it.” Tony murmured in answer with a cheeky grin, and Steve smiled back, but there was a distracted air to it.
"Tony, you met Aldrich at the party in Switzerland, the same night you met me." Maya went on, fingering the hem of her skirt. "I showed you my research but my formula was still flawed."
The trouble with humans and Earth before their parents had founded Resilience, was that all legal Gata residents were registered with the government and collared.  Nyota and her cousins had already taken care of the getting the collars part, no thanks to the Avengers who had shown up and made things twice as hard as they had to be.
But Thor had made him consider another possibility. If Tony's body couldn’t meet the new demands on its own, then it could use a hand, or maybe a couple thousand little helping hands.
"Hey stop! Theif!" He shouts, heart cracking in his chest. And even as he jolts, moving to run after the figure shoving his way through the crowd of startled onlookers, Yinsen has grabbed the back of his shirt to hold him back.
oh, let’s not be coy Tony. We all know General Ross would love to soup up a hundred more kats and send you all out to do his dirty work. He’s pushed for it for years, and the public has been the one to suffer each time some supposedly rehabilitated kat with a fresh set of claws shakes the leash.
Behind his closed eyes he keeps seeing the same face, crinkled brow, grinning mouth, blue eyes glittering with mirth, and a desperate sense of horrified guilt wells up inside of him that he can’t make sense of.
"Well the rest is deserved.” Tony assured, and then he slid his arm through Steve’s giving it a gentle squeeze. “You don't mind if I steal this guy do you?  Gotta talk to a man about a dog."
They sit poised at the beginning, ready for Tony to break down that barrier... but none of them want to entertain the notion that he possibly can't.
“I felt it prudent to seek counsel from Bastet on the chance there was anything else she might be able to tell us.”
“I know you’re not exactly in the market for taking his advice, but Luke did warn us that the risks of what we find in each others minds could be the reason the bond doesn’t take.”
Merry Christmas! I know it's late but the sentiment remains. Thank you once again for your patience.
“You both need a shower. I see you broke out the prototype for the F.A.L.C.O.N. program Clint. How’s she handling?”
Well, it couldn't be helped. Between being up all night in the lab, a morning full of meetings, and that disastrous appearance on Good Morning Manhattan, and now the crisis going on with the construction company over on the island, it was a miracle Tony wasn’t running later.
Light leaked through the fog and Tony was suddenly standing in a chamber, warm firelight bouncing off the bricks outside the pavilion, the light leaking through the silk that fluttered between the vine covered columns. The air was thick with incense and the low murmur of voices. The crowd gathered around a woman sitting in a painted chair in the center of the pavilion, holding her down and encouraging her as she grunted and groaned, struggling for breath. The lamps set the sweat that covered her dark skin till it gleamed like polished ebony. Her quivering hands clutched the swell of her pregnant belly as pain shuddered through her and she cried out. Beside her a man murmured unintelligible words of encouragement, and pressed a kiss into the wet strands of her white hair.
“Tony.” Pepper reprimanded without even looking up from her StarkPad and Steve’s neck flushed red. But Tony caught that brief flare of his nostrils, the way he took in Tony’s scent and the way his deepened just that little bit with arousal.
Would anyone believe it was
*~*~*
"He couldn't remember me because they scrambled his brain like an egg." She whispered into the dark. Her breathing had calmed and she was no longer so cold to the touch but fear lingered in her eyes when she looked at Tony. Fear and grief.
He was having trouble shaking last night’s dream. They were more memory than dream and they were coming almost nightly now that Tony had gotten inside Bucky’s head. Steve wasn’t a scientist or a psychic expert so he couldn’t really explain how he knew, but whatever had kept Bucky’s mind quiet all these years was peeling away, slowly but steadily. It wasn’t a surprise anymore to close his eyes at night and find himself pulled into some memory – impossible to tell whether the dream started with him or with Bucky. Steve always let them play out the way he remembered. He’d seen what happened when Tony woke the Winter Soldier too many times to risk Bucky realizing the dream wasn’t normal.
He gave it another twenty-four hours. Plenty of time to continue digging through what information was available about Zemo. Sokovian diplomat. Aristocrat. Considered by many to be the founder of the StandUp Humanity movement. Widowed – his young family killed during the Sokovian Rebellion ten years back. That explained his bleak outlook on Gata at least. Laws in many European countries were laxer about regulating domestication practices.
A troublingly low number when you considered Steve’s official status as team leader and the need for team meetings, training sessions, and the occasional debriefing.
Here’s the truly crazy part (the part Steve is probably going to flip his shit about). It had already occurred to Tony that besides connecting to machines, he was producing an excess amount of energy (energy his body wasn’t equipped to handle or contain that could have explosive results). Using himself as a power source was risky (okay yeah crazy) but it might just be enough to keep the kid safe and protect Natasha. Long enough anyway.
“Then why did you react that way, when I showed you what we could have?”
Tony turned slowly as Steve, battered and blood-stained marched toward him, Thor not far behind.
Even though Mama frets, each morning when Papa finishes his breakfast he wipes his mustache with his napkin the exact same way, and says to Tony with a wink, “Well I was hoping they’d send me a crack assistant, but I guess I’ll make due with you instead.”
“W-what?” Peter’s head jerked up. Tony knew he hadn’t applied. Then how –
“Last year it was Brad Pitt,” Fluffy said with a dreamy sigh, her fluffy brown tail swishing. She gave Tony a judgmental look as she muttered, “and he did voices!”
A glitch maybe? He was about to ask Natasha what she thought when they were both distracted by a humming sound over the commlink.
Except the bastard shot Steve. Steve who had come running even when Tony had told him to stay, and Tony couldn’t even say which one of them he was running for. Him or Bucky? Steve probably didn’t even know, or care to know what had driven him. But one thing Tony knew for sure was, Steve was going to be all kinds of upset when he came to and discovered that Tony may have given his ex-boyfriend brain damage.
“Are you comfortable? These cots are not known to be the worthiest of beds.” Thor hovered over her a moment until Bruce nudged him out of the way, instructing the pair of SHIELD medics who’d come along with Coulson to get her set up with an IV and barking for JARVIS to turn up the temperature in the jet. She tried to reassure Thor with her eyes, but it was a battle to keep them open.
“Yes I did.” Luke answered with a nod. “I can find no fault in either her research or her test subjects. The machine should work exactly as you expect it will.”
“What?” Steve asked, blinking kind of sleepily, like he was coming out of a daze. But his eyes were clear once more and intently focused on Tony as he asked, “Tony what’s wrong?”
"Steve and I aren't-" Tony began but the woman laughed again, interrupting.
"Yeah. Right. Of course whatever you say Blackbeard." Tony agreed, still seething quietly as he stood from his chair, though the reinforcement from the others had helped calm him so that he didn't quite feel like he was existing inside a pressure cooker. He wasn't quite ready to forgive Fury and he'd never fully trust the man.
Tony jerked at the sound of the unexpected voice, unintentionally slamming the back of his skull against the underbelly of the machine he was currently under, fine tuning some of the more delicate wire work.
“The king has two wives?” Pepper demurred. “That sounds like a handful.”
Her brow pearled with sweat that kept dripping into the darkened strands of her hair as she trembled and groaned, fighting for each breath and pushing with all her might.
He both loved and hated how amazing it made him feel. Loved the trust and the love he and Tony could share by exchanging something so precious between their hands, and hated how out of control he felt over his own body whenever his chest would swell and his fingers ache like the only thing to do now was grow claws and go slaughter all of Tony’s enemies.
Bullshit Tony thought. They were escaping in an aircraft, he knew it. He scanned the sky looking for any sign and cursing the fact that wasn’t light out when he’d have a better chance at it.
But in quiet moments he hears his teacher and reminds himself that there is no shame in the searching, even still.
His masters have never lied to him about his past. Why should they bother?
He wondered if T’Challa had heard those thoughts too, but all thoughts flew from his head as the prince considered him with a penetrating stare and one hand reached to gently grasp his, lifting it gently to his lips. The kiss he brushed against Tony’s knuckles was barely there, but Tony felt it, deep in the pit of his stomach, fluttering in his chest like a bird taking flight.
"How long have you two been coming here?" Steve asked and Kitty huffed a noisy breath, sending her bangs flying upward.
Bruce was coming to think being pride meant they all needed to find something in each other. Why else would the pull be so specific? Why these particular people?
would sweep into the nursery where Tony had been born and nursed by his mother (or attended to by Mr. Jarvis when Howard had better uses for her time) and would have some new puzzle for Tony to solve or problem to work out, each one harder than the last and the punishment for failure more severe. And of course, Howard somehow always managed to expect both failure and perfection from Tony.
A large kitten-bed had been set up in the middle of the lab because the plushy circle cushion would allow room for both him and Bruce to lay side by side and still be touching. They did not want to discount that physical closeness had played a hand in Tony and Natasha’s successful bonding. When the rest of the team had been settled in a loose semi-circle around the bed and the machines Helen and Dr. Salek had begun hooking them up to the various monitors and forms of life support.
He'd started to fall for him then, but since even Clint could admit he had the emotional maturity of a teaspoon, and next to zero trust in humans, he'd ignored it for another two years.
Panic slammed through Tony and his hands slapped to his chest in what would have been a comical fashion if he weren’t staring at the device that was supposed to keep him alive lying in a pool of his own blood like it had been cut right out of him.
And of course, there was the fact that physical exercise just helped clear Steve’s head almost better than anything else. Not as well as sex, some mocking voice whispered in the back of his mind, and he blushed thinking of the way Tony’s way too talented tongue liked to move when they kissed and the way his tail liked to curl around Steve’s nearest appendage all soft and insistent.
Not likely, Tony thought as he found the bypass codes for The Daggers security shields.  A warm rush flooded through him and there was a warning prickle at the back of his mind, like the beginning of a headache but it didn’t matter. He was in. He’d give it a few moments of rest before he began to dig. He wondered how far the ships computer could take him. Maybe even all the way back to Wakanda. The wonderful thing about computers was networking after all.
Tony woke as Bruce snuffled in his ear and right on que, JARVIS was there to help him great the morning, “Good morning Sir. The time is 12:30 PM in New York City. You are in your private quarters. Ms. Romanov has started a pot of coffee for you in the kitchen.”
