“Come to say goodbye to your old man?” he asked. Peter reached instead for an apple from the bowl of fruit on the counter.
“KATE!” he screamed. She turned and ran towards them.
“Still only ever kissed Peggy as far as girls are concerned, huh? And that one chick Peggy nearly shot you over,” Tony amended, vaguely recalling the story. Other Steve didn’t reply, just stared pointedly at his newspaper, his eyes not moving across the page and the muscles in his neck standing out. “How long have you been off ice again?”
“So with that—ready?” 3490 Tony asked.
,” he snapped. James did his best to swallow down his own anger. Peter was hurt. He was hurting. He was hurting all over the place and there was bound to be a casualty or two—and James had pissed him off earlier.
He’d spent so long wishing he wouldn’t be sidelined. He’d spent so, so long wishing he had powers, wishing he would one day join the rest of his friends and families in protecting the world and going on what always seemed like exciting adventures. And now that he had it, well, maybe it wasn’t exactly what he’d always pictured, but he was still so glad not to be sidelined anymore. It wasn’t a good feeling.
“And they

“No,” Pepper said softly, but her voice was steady and filled with courage. Steve had to admire her strength in the face of something that so clearly terrified her. After everything they had been through, Pepper Potts showed what she was really made of underneath it all: iron.
“I was taking care of something for Coulson before I came,” James said by way of explanation. He turned to the Alts, an apologetic smile on his face. “Sorry. I can’t say it’s never happened that I’ve shown up at the mansion to find skrulls masquerading as Dad and Tony. Or killer life model decoys. Or

It wasn’t like movies always said it was. There weren’t any fireworks. There wasn’t a moment of singular clarity, where Tony realized this was his
At first, people turned up who Steve and the other MCU Avengers knew, either in this universe or their own—Bruce arrived with his family with two green bean casseroles, Clint, his wife Bobbie and their several children showed up with an extra turkey and a few sides (one for each kid to carry, except for the littlest girl), Thor and Jane came alone with their daughter Torrun, Rhodey showed up with a chocolate pie because he didn’t like pumpkin and knew 3490 Tony wasn’t fond of it either, Sam Wilson brought more mashed potatoes and a bad joke, and Pepper, Happy, and their kids brought along a turkey as well. But then other people started showing up. Steve was happy to more formally be introduced to Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, otherwise known to Steve as the amazing flying woman who saved his and Tony’s ass. Reed and Sue Richards Steve didn’t know, but Tony seemed to know their counterparts and it didn’t appear they were the best of friends. They were part of a team called the ‘Fantastic Four’ and weren’t technically Avengers.

He emerged from below, opening the door over his head. He shut it and stepped away; some of Tony’s tech faded the door into the rest of the cement, looking as if it had never been. The great doors to the warehouse were open, revealing the dim orange light of the evening and the sunlit docks beyond, sparkling with reds and pinks and yellows in the sunset. He could hear the cries of gulls overhead, could smell the water and the pollution too—God, James hadn’t even realized how he’d missed these sights and sounds and smells, but now that he did he realized how much he hated the bunker, their tomb of safety. He breathed deeply even if the smell wasn’t pleasant, because it was something other than filtered air. He stepped through the empty warehouse, his foot splashing in a puddle on the ground from the leaky roof. He stepped outside into the bright sunshine and smiled briefly—but his smile was quickly cut short when he realized what he was actually seeing. He ducked back inside the warehouse, taking cover behind the wall. Out in the world of orange sunsets was a large group of AIM agents gathering. At least, James was fairly certain they were AIM. They didn’t wear a uniform or anything, but most of them had weapons, and they obviously weren’t SHIELD.
“S’that a science joke?” James asked groggily. Peter was glad he was still conscious. “Nerd.”
“Uh. I stick to stuff now. Like ceilings and glass and—anything, actually, I’m using atomic force—well, not

explained in part why Natasha could not feel comfortable in 3490. Avengers Academy reminded her too strongly of her own childhood. Perhaps it wasn’t fair to compare the school to the red room, but the result was much the same, wasn’t it? Children were trained for battle. Children were turned into efficient, ruthless killers.
Francis Barton understood Katherine Elizabeth Rogers better than ninety-eight percent of people. The two percent that understood her better included herself, her brothers, her parents, and no one else. Francis was her closest friend and had been for years. They were also something more than that, though. Francis knew that. He thought Kate knew it, too—but he’d managed to screw everything up. They hadn’t, after all, been terribly clear about the status of their unique
Suddenly, someone ducked and rolled, landing behind their car. Kate didn’t need to see the red and blue to know it was MCU Steve. He had his hand on his earpiece, and he was shouting.
“No, but given how much my old man wanted a son that wouldn’t surprise me. ‘Tony’ is short for—”
“Yes ma’am,” Steve spoke quietly. “I’m sorry.”
Kate still couldn’t contain a wince whenever she looked at the page. She was so used to seeing As straight down the page, and here she was, in her penultimate year, and she was getting the worst grades she had ever gotten. She considered, briefly, photoshopping a new report card (that would be easy) and sneaking into the office to stamp it with the seal (harder, but certainly not impossible). But no, there wasn’t time for that. Her parents
“No one is going to murder me in my own tower, Giggles. You can take the night off,” the Senator said.
. Tony found himself listening again, as did, he suspected, half the kitchen.
“Ok, but I can guarantee even though you can’t get drunk you can still get high,” Kate pointed out before drawing another. Steve began his sketch of the tree, trying to feign some disinterest in the girl. She reminded him solidly of his own universe’s Tony, and if there was anything Tony hated more than being handed things, it was serious conversation. So he decided he must pretend not to care, at least a little bit, and maybe she wouldn’t notice that she was having a serious conversation.
isn’t it? Vengeance is the central theme.”
“I think you all know exactly why I’ve assembled you here today,” Kate said over the crowd. “You’ve seen the news. You’ve seen the streets. You’ve been in contact with SHIELD as you wait for your school to reopen. You know what’s happening. The Avengers are dealing with other problems. And me and some of your other classmates are dealing with the leaks, with anything and everything that pops into existence from the tears in our universe. But we can’t do it alone. We’re getting pummeled. We have too few people to begin with, and we’re getting hit so many times a day none of us can keep up. At this rate, we’ll be dead by the end of the week. We were almost dead this afternoon. We can’t do this alone. So I’m asking you to join us. I know you’re not even eighteen yet. And I know you’re scared. I’m scared. But we have to do something before it’s too late.”
Steve didn’t even realize that the hall was collapsing around them until Natasha shouted at him, so busy he was with fending off the Red Skull again. It was pretty clear though, once she pointed it out, that they were all about to be buried by wood, mortar, and stone. He didn’t have much time to think about it though as the Red Skull swung at him and he brought up his shield to avoid the blow.

“Level Six access, or so they tell us. We have no reason to believe otherwise,” Coulson said. He used a slice of bread to obscure his mouth. “Level Six is hardly the deepest layer. It’s what they feel comfortable exposing.” He took a bite. Clint picked up his own wine. He took a sip—oh, 3490 Tony really knew how to get on a guy’s good side. They were certainly trying hard enough.
“Clearly this guy didn’t hear my gun lecture,” Peter yelled to his brother as he approached, coming from another side to kick this asshole off the rafter with both feet. But Peter impacted into nothing to his surprise—he ended up swinging right past the rafter where the sniper had been standing and landed on the next beam over. The sniper guy had

I think that we all—we all take for granted what we have. We let tiny, petty things get in the way. Or we let big things get wedged in the way and forget that, at the end of the day, what matters most is love. And if you love someone… if you love someone, you work with it if you can. I didn’t always do that. Tony didn’t always do that—we’re all just human, in the end. We forget lessons we’ve learned and end up learning them over and over again, sometimes.

Natasha Romanov was many things. She was who she was needed to be at the moment. She was spy, assassin, seductress, best friend, confidante, mysterious stranger, and a thousand other little things. Upon occasion, even Natasha could not see the truth of herself, could not parse fact from fiction. But one thing that Natasha had never been was a soldier. And yet, since Tony Stark built himself an iron suit, since Bruce Banner turned himself green, since an alien landed on earth and a national icon dead for seventy years had been revived, Natasha

He might’ve started vanilla but once you get him going…” She trailed off, grinning like the cat who caught the canary. But the grin vanished quickly and Antonella gave Tony an appraising look. She sipped her coffee. Tony eyed her suspiciously.
“Of course, of course,” Tony said, readily excusing him. He just nodded and then took his leave, never quite ridding himself of that lost expression. It was so difficult to remember that he was not her husband, difficult to remember that this was one Steve whose heart she could not repair. As he disappeared, Tony felt a bit lost herself.
, amidst the Avengers missions and late night paperwork, Steve had forgotten which lesson was the most important. It wasn’t honesty or integrity or respect or duty or responsibility or anything like that. It was love. Teach love, and everything else would follow in time. Did James even know that Steve loved him? He could tell him until he was blue in the face, but did he

Steve’s expression was one of pain, horrible pain. And Tony for a moment, through her anger, felt her gut twist in agony, because no matter how upset she was, this was still her fault, too. No matter how upset she was, she hated hurting him.
for that part—and in her father’s painting, that work showed. Her face, beatific, as she held the nutcracker doll and stood on point, warmed in the stage lights. She looked even younger than her age. She was the pinnacle of sweet innocence, everything she’d had to emulate as the character, and her father had captured it in his half-finished painting. The stage still wasn’t filled in, but the basics of
To James, it had seemed like the sun had finally started shining again when Tony put the gauntlet on. That was probably due, in part, to the fact that when he did, a great, blinding white light washed over the whole battlefield, and by the time James had finally blinked the light out of his eyes all the ominous, dark patches of space had disappeared from the sky. The atmosphere was nothing but a beautiful bright blue, filled with fluffy clouds and chirping birds. The Hydra agents—even the dead ones—had disappeared entirely. The grime was mysteriously gone from James’ uniform. And there, on his knees still in the suit, was Tony, the gauntlet having disappeared as well.
“Who?” he asked.

everything looks pretty damn dramatic—“
“The swelling’s going to be a bitch on that if you don’t ice it,” Tony pointed out. Peter turned around and nearly stumbled backward in his surprise, almost tripping on a stack of books on the ground. His room was littered with books. Books, comics, and little gadgets probably of his own design. It was extraordinarily messy, the kind of messy Tony’s own mother would have boxed his ears for.
“Maybe because you don’t live here? Just a thought,” Kate said. She glanced at the gun. “You know, one day you’re going to blow your dick off and I’m just going to laugh. Why are you packing heat, anyway, you expect to get jumped on the way here? I know Long Island is so dangerous in the peak of broad daylight—Brookville, especially—but I think you’re a big boy with super soldier genes who can handle it.”
He’d survived the fall from the train, a result of Arnim Zola’s experiments. He’d been found by the Russians and turned into a weapon, fitted with a metal arm to replace the one he had lost. He had been brainwashed and reprogramed, his memories wiped time and time again. Eventually, he’d ended up going head to head with 3490 Steve, who found a way to restore his memories. But, as Bucky had painfully explained, it had been a very rough road. Steve was filled with empathetic pain enough for 3490 Bucky, but the Natasha of his own universe gave him the worst pains—she

“I have things to do in town. I’ll see you this afternoon, Katie,” James said. He shoved Peter’s head down slightly. It wasn’t exactly painful, but it wasn’t comfortable, either. “Later, dork.” With that he exited the room. Peter just grabbed his bag off the floor.
“I’m not him,” Steve disagreed.
“Not since I was thirteen, Pops,” James said. Peter groaned internally. Every time he brought out ‘Pops’ instead of ‘Dad’ or even ‘Sir’ or ‘Commander’, it was a bad sign. It meant James was

They were silent for a while, silent except for the sound of Kate sniffling occasionally. She shifted around and put her head on his shoulder. Peter rested his head on hers.

“Our parents are taking care of that,” Francis pointed out.
James led the way through the deserted mall, his semi-holographic shield the only thing lighting the way. He’d run this path just twice as a child, once through a lit, empty mall, and once through the place completely crowded, but never in the dark. Yet still the way was ingrained in his mind, the memory accompanied by unadulterated fear having made every turn and twist unforgettable. He broke the lock on a service door with a well placed gunshot. The door led to a tiny little staircase down. He turned to the group.
“I don’t want to be perfect,” Steve admitted. “I just wish I’d been a better man.”

“There’s more, of course,” Natasha’s own double spoke. It always sent a chill down her spine to hear her own voice, aged decades and coming from someone else, like hearing her own voice on a recording from twenty years in the future. “We captured a few of the agents. We’ve tested their blood—they’re from
Peter realized belatedly, holding onto the beam with glowing hands before pulling himself right back up and jumping to the next rafter over, in retreat. Peter started after him, James matching his jumps from beam to beam. Thug #3 must have realized they were going to catch him; he pulled out a smaller firearm from a holster on his hip, turned and started shooting. He was a good shot, and James was having trouble avoiding the bullets. He nearly slipped off a beam, off balance.
In order to regain some semblance of control in his life, Steve decided to take a walk one evening out on the grounds. The grounds were beautiful, all perfectly well kept. There were patches of flowers and an area of carefully tended woods. The lawn was perfectly manicured and everything was taken care of with precision. Yet Steve never saw anyone actually
“It’s just for a while, Steve,” Bucky told him gently.

It was July of 1998. His birthday had been on Saturday, and Tony had insistently driven him up to her beach house on Cape Cod after throwing a surprise party for him on Friday at her mansion. He had been surprised when she had announced that she was dropping him off when they got there, giving him a weekend of quiet at the beach—he insisted that she stay. There had been a note of awkwardness between them that year, from the time he and Bernie separated all the way until their Christmas kiss. He knew that she knew that Bernie had suspected him of cheating on him with her, that Bernie had left because of his friendship with her, because it was all-consuming in many ways. Steve knew Tony felt horribly guilty. She had tried, in increasingly extravagant ways, to make up for it. Relatively speaking, a little surprise party with his closest friends and a weekend at the beach was tame.
It was Saturday of their first week when the 199999 had their first truly formal meeting. 3490 Tony was in her lab, 3490 Steve was spending the day with James, Peter, and Kate in the city, and so the house was empty aside from the 199999 Avengers and company. So they sat in the dining room, at the long wooden table, treating their meeting more like a conference than a haphazard get together.
“Ok. All right,” Steve agreed, taking a step away. “I just—you could have a concussion. Can I check, or?” Steve’s expression was so earnest and there was just the tiniest amount of hurt showing through. Tony felt his gut wrench again.
“Didn’t realize you preferred the first name basis,” Tony said. Steve rolled his eyes.
Kate woke up still exhausted. Her whole body was drained and aching, though part of that was probably due to the fact that she was still sleeping on the floor. Most everyone was still asleep, but Kate, though she didn’t know how early it might be, didn’t feel like sleeping anymore. She moved around the sleeping bodies on the floor and left the room, heading into the kitchen. She passed her sleeping father, passed out on the couch, and then into the kitchen area. Clint was already up and making coffee. She knew it was 3490 Clint just by the way he moved around. Kate took a seat at the table. Clint glanced at her, then poured another cup of coffee. He set the second mug down in front of her and took a seat as well.
“So, find the Red Skull, find the space stone,” James interjected from where he sat, sandwiched between Azari and Torrun. “No chance we have any leads on where he’s holed up?”
“But I don’t want—I want a chance to…to explain, I guess,” Francis said.
. It must not have dried quickly enough for it to harden and gain full strength. As James landed, a bullet, a bullet which would have hit Peter dead-on, maybe in the heart, went right through him. The pain, force and surprise was enough to knock James off balance—he slipped from the rafter. Peter yelled in shock and reached down with his web; he managed to slow his brother’s fall, but only just. James hit the cement floor with a sickening

“Well, I’m not entirely sure myself, Director,” her double said, looking around. “We’re tracking down the Ghost—heard of him?”

“Under the right circumstances? I don’t know, maybe,” Tony said, shaking his head. He took a seat on the bed as well, looking distraught. “Fuck, Steve. We can’t run. Even if we could plan it, even if we had the means—there’s no escape.”
yet,” Francis said. Other Clint was looking steadily more horrified and it took all of Steve’s willpower not to laugh because, of course, Clint couldn’t know that Francis was pulling his leg. Other Clint attempted to formulate a response while Steve rose from his chair. He had other things to worry about than Francis causing a bit of mischief with the Alts.

“Did you get ‘em good, Dad?” Peter had asked, and their dad had smiled, his gaze far away.
“You asked for it!” Steve shouted after him. Other Clint laughed his ass off, and Steve took his son’s place on the couch. “How about a round?”
“It’s going to be ok, Jamie,” his father said. But it sounded desperate. James’ gut twisted with horrible fear. It sounded like a lie.
“Wh-what? No, I just—I get hungry. Early. Woke up early. It’s—I—fast metabolism?” Steve tried to explain, cursing his twisted tongue. He was flustered. That he could admit to. He was

“Hey, Tony,” Steve started. Tony’s shoulders tensed—he was waiting for the fight, prepping for it. “Look I just wanted to say—I didn’t want to be—to be weird about what happened. I—I don’t want to let anything personal get in the way of our job again. We were starting to work together pretty well. And I respect your decision. I really do. No hard feelings. I’m sorry I—I maybe brought the personal into our professional lives. And I wanted to apologize for that. I mean I still—I still don’t think you should have charged in—but if it was anyone but you we probably would have argued for a few minutes and been done with it.” Tony was staring at him. Why was Tony staring at him? Steve fidgeted uncomfortably under his scrutiny. “Uh, ok? Are we…are we good?”
He trusted Tony. He understood Tony. He knew it was a mutual thing. And no matter what else happened, they’d gained that. They’d earned it.
Tony had made him
“Attack on New York was just over a year and a half ago. We pretty much ignored each other for six months after that, but we’ve been working together…on and off…for the last year,” he said. Tony blinked. The information was hard for her to comprehend. She couldn’t imagine going more than a week without her team now.
“Love you too, Dad,” Peter said, choking on a lump in his throat. Dad released him, put hands on Peter’s shoulders.
“Can I get you anything? Water? Crackers?” he asked. Tony shook her head. “Tell me what you need.” Steve hated seeing Tony like this. It reminded him too much of that awful year he had spent looking after her as she wasted away, dying. It reminded him too much of the cancer that had sapped her strength, sucked all the vitality and life from her until there was little left of his wife that was recognizable.

“Peter! Peter! Are you ok?” Kate cried out. She could hear Alt Steve behind her, calling out on the comms that Peter was alive.
“They’re beautiful, aren’t they?” 3490 Tony continued as if he hadn’t spoken. She reached out and touched a single white petal, but did not pluck a flower from the plant. “They’re Camellias. This one is Camellia Sasanqua. It’s nicknamed the Yuletide Camellia since it blooms so early. Still, this is early even for it. Did you know you can use the leaves to make tea?

It was nearly four in the morning. Doctor Banner grunted.
“So welcome to a not-exactly-typical-and-thank-God-for-that morning at the Stark Rogers household,” 3490 Tony said. “If you would like to leave your awkward excuses for how you were ‘totally not listening, didn’t hear any of it’ at the door, it would be appreciated. If everyone will finish up soon, I’ll show you to your rooms.” Leave it to Tony, in any verse, to break the tension of a moment. More relaxed and settled now, the Avengers and co of 199999 earnestly ate the remainder of their breakfasts. All but Steve, Tony noted, who sipped at his coffee and surreptitiously watched 3490 Tony, who was throwing dishes in the sink. Moments later, just as the Avengers were filling the alternate kitchen with their own boisterous conversations (Thor regaling Jane with tales of Asgard, Clint, Bruce and Natasha discussing the latest episode of

“And it didn’t really work here anyway, did it? I mean—things weren’t exactly going great for them, were they?” Tony continued, and Steve’s brain caught up with him. He was talking about Steve and Tony of 3490.

“Y-yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I’m…Can I just…have a few minutes to talk to you guys?” he asked. Mom put down the remote and they changed positions to look less ridiculous.
“What are you doing here, Natasha?” Steve asked. Natasha had a look of cold professionalism that he’d seen on her one too many times. It meant that she was pissed off.

They would make it through this battle. They would. Kate’s move had bought them a little extra time. But as the frost giants were pushed back and a new rip in the universe opened up, with more aliens pouring out, Natasha knew they could not keep this up forever.
“To gain our trust,” Steve said, nodding. “It’s pretty obvious. It might be naive but I don’t think they really wanted any of us not to see the light of day for a year. Partially that might be a safety precaution—if we’d managed to escape, none of us would have been happy about the situation, after all.”
“Yes?” Steve answered, a bit uncertainly. Peter nodded sagely.
“No,” he replied, just as softly. He sounded distant.
. Look at him! He’s a kid. He’s Steve when we met in 1990 for God’s sake. He might be a big war hero but he hasn’t adjusted to this century yet. Clouds his judgment.”
“Ok, Tony,” he agreed. Then he hesitated. “Is—is Dad coming?” Tony gave him a bright smile that he knew was forced, and he winced a little internally.

Halloween was often a busy day for SHIELD—plenty of mutants took it as the opportune time to reveal themselves, and they weren’t all wanna-be heroes and vigilantes. Not only was she keeping an eye on SHIELD operations, but the back of her mind was spinning wheels, trying to get a handle on the idea that her son, the

was usually all Tony Stark ever needed.
“Think you have me, Katie-Kate?” she asked, using Clint’s nickname for her, and something inside Kate snapped. Kate’s nose was bleeding—broken, if she had to guess. Her tailbone was too, if she had to guess, and even standing hurt like crazy. Her lower body felt like it was on fire. Kate pressed her knee into Jeanne’s back hard until the other girl slammed the rest of the way to the floor.
“You would have driven me to an asylum by now, had that been the case,” Double Pepper said, amused. “I think Happy and I make a better pair.”
“Hey, Uncle Bruce! Check this out!” Peter called. He was stuck to the ceiling again, but this time his hands and feet were free—he had removed his shirt and stuck there with his back alone. He had such an expression of glee on his face that Bruce recalled the time when he was six and the whole Avengers and all their family went to DisneyLand for the day. That same smile had never left his face. Bruce recognized that smile not just in Peter, but in all of the kids. Kate smiled that way when she’d told him proudly that she’d gotten the part of Clara in the
The routine never changed much for Steve. He had the shift from seven in the evening until four in the morning, at which point Agent Romanoff relieved him. If that time was not spent watching Senator Stark at work in his lab (and having to tolerate the music that drowned out every thought in his head), it was usually spent outside the senator’s bedroom. He had a new girl every few nights—or a new guy, on a few memorable occasions.
before running in front of the couch, putting it between herself and mature Steve (though, Pepper was wondering if she needed to rethink the moniker). She ducked to the left, and so did mature Steve. She ducked to the right, and he followed. They were playing a game of chicken, but it was pretty clear who would win out in the end.
,” Kate spat. She got up. There was nowhere to go in this tiny little place, not really, but she took off for one of the bedrooms anyway.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked. “I could grab something from the restaurant and we could eat on the helicarrier.” Tony grunted.
“Anything else?” their father asked quietly, running a hand through his blond hair. Was it James’ imagination, or was he beginning to get little grey strands at his temples?
“Because Fury never attempted ethical ones first,” Tony protested. “I’m not going to download my alternate’s brain and see exactly what he’s thinking. I’m not going to pry the secrets out of Fury with nanites if I can do it with
“Actually if we’re getting technical, that would be you,” James remarked dryly. Peter felt his cheeks burn. In all his sixteen years, James had never pointed that out before, and it made his blood boil.
“Well…can you tell me what it is? Or would that be…breaking her trust, somehow?” Steve asked. Tony didn’t know. This was all so confusing. When someone died, did they deserve to have their secrets die with them? Would she have even cared if MCU’s Steve knew? Tony didn’t think so. He probably wouldn’t, in her position, but they

The kids were not, however, the only lively ones at the table. Thor always made breakfast interesting, considering that he could drink a whole pot of coffee himself and eat as much in one meal as Tony did in several days. On this particular morning, there had been only one packet of strawberry PopTarts left in the cabinet. It created a crisis situation in which Kate crossed her arms and stared at Thor until he handed it over. It was obvious that, while he was happy to do the ‘honorable’ thing and give the PopTarts to the young girl, it pained him to do it. James and Peter had nearly engaged in a fistfight over the last piece of bacon (which Natasha then snatched whilst they were arguing and smiled as she ate it, as if

“You know how this goes, Captain. It’s very simple. You give me what I want—every safe house location and code, and every password to every electronics system (of course, Tony can crack them but it goes so much more smoothly with them). You do that, and the boy goes free. You don’t and—well. At least it will be quick. I could draw it out, but, frankly, I draw the line at torturing children. Have to have a line in the sand somewhere, don’t we? And you have two others, anyway,” 525 Steve said. “So, what’ll it be? The information or your little boy’s neck?” James knew that he was shaking like crazy now. He was surprised he was still standing. Tears flowed freely down his cheeks and he did his best to choke back his terrified sobs. Dad would save him. He would. But 525 Steve was met with silence. Prolonged silence.

the right thing to say?
“I think I can shimmy inside,” Kate said. The window was small, not meant for anything human to get in or out of it, but Kate was thin. The biggest danger would be her hips, but she figured she could manage. She yelled into the window. “Peter? Peter are you in there? Can you hear me?”
“There’s a difference between using violent tactics for what’s right and using them for personal gain,” his father said, and James could hear the steel returning to his voice. Suddenly, James knew,
“I had one like this,” 525 Steve admitted. “That wasn’t a lie. He was a good boy, a sweet boy. Well, when he was little, anyway. He got more troublesome the older he got.” James bit his lip as 525 Steve’s grip tightened painfully on his shoulder. He could feel his knees wobbling, could feel the tears prickling at the back of his eyes and the lump in his throat.
“James! James! Tell me—tell me why you forgive Dad,” Peter said, latching on the first thing that came to mind. “Talk to me, James.”
“Light punishment works well on a kid like Peter, but not a kid like Kate,” 3490 Tony argued. “Besides, name once that Peter has done something half as bad as sneaking out at night to go to a

“So to what degree do we think he’s lying?” Natasha mused.

James knew, in the moment following the uttering of that phrase, that his father would give no further interruption. He thought about running, but he knew 525 Steve would catch him even if he could slip out from his iron grip. He always caught him in their Nerf games. His air supply cut off completely. There were spots in front of his eyes. James screwed them shut.
“Peter! Peter! Oh, God—Peter, did you get Nicole? Nicole, is she still in the building?” Clint asked, grasping Steve’s son by the shoulders as a horrified expression suddenly came over both of their faces.
Natasha Romanoff was thoroughly uncomfortable and had been so for months on end. She had never been so uncomfortable, however, as when they were all shoved in that godforsaken underground bunker. At least here they had more access to entrances and exits. Of course, that meant more places to guard, but it was a relief to the assassin to have multiple escape routes, especially given their situation. Natasha trusted 3490 about as far as she could throw them. It was pretty clear that they didn’t mean them any harm, but she had no doubt in her mind that if it came down to the safety of them and their families versus the safety of 199999, they would choose their own safety. She couldn’t blame them for that, but it didn’t exactly instill confidence. But at least, now, they were freely sharing information. Usually Natasha would assume they were holding something back, but she didn’t think the Commander had the energy to lie or withhold information without making it obvious that he was doing so. Steve had never been a good liar, and his grief only made him worse.

“So did you write that out or was that off the top of your head?” Francis asked as they rode away.
“BLUE TEAM,” Kate half yelled and half gasped into the mic as she dodged yet another shot of blue light coming from the Hydra agents at their heels, “REQUESTING IMMEDIATE EVAC. SOUTH SIDE. GREAT HALL. WINDOWS…!”

Tony’s smirk faded, and her arms uncrossed, and then she was walking to him with more urgency, until she was standing at the side of the pulpit, close enough to touch. Steve didn’t move, except to turn his head to keep his gaze on her. He could smell her perfume.
The MCU team, weaponless and largely grounded, had obviously been given orders to help herd the crowd in the right directions, getting them out of the line of fire. James heard a moan and noticed a man on the ground, bleeding from his leg badly. He picked the man up and ran with him.
Oh, wait. That last one actually happened.
“Listen, Kate, I don’t want to get all

“You don’t even know her!” Tony said, exasperated.
“Director Stark has approved your entrance,” JARVIS told him moments later as Steve heard the click of a lock coming undone. Steve opened the door slowly, then descended the stairs. It was a bit dark and glum in the lab. The floor was a simple grey concrete, likely for easy clean-up. There were a few steel tables, littered with equipment and half-finished devices. In the back, Steve could see a couple of Iron Man suits, stationary but fully assembled. There was one small area cordoned off with a sofa, a mini-fridge, a microwave, and a TV. Well, that explained how 3490 Tony was still alive, at least. The woman herself was busy working at one of the tables, screwing something violently into something else. Her hair was up high on her head in a bun that was half falling out. She just wore a grey tank top, splattered with grease stains, and sweatpants. She didn’t look up as he came in.
“The Skull desires a much grander prize—with no insult meant, Steven,” the other Thor had spoken. He had set the gauntlet on the table before them all. Of course, if the Red Skull was going to attempt to make some kind of ‘new multiverse order’, he was going to need as much power as possible to do it. Although No one from the 3490 universe seemed at all convinced that a gauntlet could influence anything beyond its own universal borders.
“What’s the situation, Barton?” Tony asked. She had her best pair of eyes patched in through a secure channel as she sat in her office, reading through various classified documents, trying to piece together a mystery. There had been worrying energy spikes all along the eastern seaboard since before the alternate avengers arrived. They
“Gotta be deeper. More booming and commanding. ‘Fraid you haven’t got it down yet,” James offered.
mean time, we’re going to need everyone here on the ground helping with the leaks. Our team will largely be away from the city—we need to find the gauntlet, and we need to find the source of all this trouble—but we need you here on the ground to cover any trouble that will inevitably pop up.” The Commander turned his gaze to his own double. “Except you. I want James taking command of your team.”
,” Commander Rogers said emphatically. “Do you want to go? There’s the door, Stark. Walk right on out, I won’t stop you. None of you concern me unless you’re jeopardizing the safety of others. You want to leave, you go ahead and leave. Sure would save Tony and I on the grocery bill.” Commander Rogers stood, still looking monumentally pissed off. “I get that this whole damn universe must feel like a prison to you. But believe me, Stark, we want you gone more than you even want to go. If I could toss you all back where you came from today without risking a cataclysm I would
“We didn’t want to make things confusing,” MCU Steve offered.
“That’s what they
“Yeah? Hopefully I’ve gotten the ‘saving our asses’ thing down, too!” Kate yelled. Francis gripped around her stomach tighter as she took a sharp turn. He hoped she had, too. At the very least, she’d bought them extra time. Francis just hoped it would be enough. It had to be.
Kate had never felt quite so hopeful nor quite so afraid as she sat in the bunker’s living area with roughly two dozen other people—the Avengers of her world, the Avengers of the MCU, the kids she’d grown up with and trained with, and a handful of the Avengers Academy kids, too. They’d all gathered around Thor, some standing in the background, some of them crowded onto the couch and the armchair—Azari, Torrun, and James somehow all occupied the chair at the same time—and a bunch of the kids sitting crosslegged on the ground before the Asgardian, as if he were about to start telling stories for them in front of a fireplace.
“Good night. I love you,” their father said. He sounded mournful. He was afraid, James realized. He was afraid that this story would scare them away. He was afraid that they would see him differently. He was afraid that they would become James. Kate moved forward and gave her dad a hug and a kiss on the cheek. She was reassuring.
“Hey,” Kate answered dully. They’d won the battle. No one on
“Give me five minutes,” James said. Kate left the room and James quickly changed before meeting her in the hall. “So am I driving?”
“What?” James asked.
He’d almost killed his son, and here his son was, trying to comfort
But that was the extent of their conversation. At least, until the battle was over and they could both breathe a sigh of relief, knowing the kids and their own team would be returning shortly. Steve finally got up off the couch, ready to get some sleep. It was dark out—they would all need to get some shuteye.
“They’ve told us to stay behind,” Steve said grimly. “But I think in this scenario a little disobedience is necessary. Suit up—we’ve got to help them.” Steve turned to Tony. “How about you Stark? Any way you know of getting your hands on one of those suits?” Tony grimaced.
So Tony waited in the empty penthouse, cleared of furniture except for a long refreshments table near the back. Though it was empty, it was heavily decorated with all sorts of Christmas items. In years past, they would decorate the penthouse as a family, but as the kids got older they saved the Christmas decorations to doing the tree at the mansion and hired a decorator to take charge of the penthouse. There was also a tree in the penthouse, a truly massive one that was positively brimming with ornaments. Every year the Avengers would all spend the night in the tower and celebrate the holiday together in the morning—a remainder from the time when none of them had families of their own. They would open gifts from one another and then return home for their separate Christmas celebrations. It worked well, Tony thought. They were truly one big family. Only Tony didn’t much feel family oriented on this particular day. For the most part, she just felt drained. She looked at her watch and tapped her foot impatiently. 4:05. Steve was fashionably late.
“I’m preparing to hibernate,” Peter said. He licked a dollop of peanut butter off his fingertip. Alt Tony watched him, an eyebrow raised.
“But to non-powered people

universe you’re from, we’ll be able to send you back fairly promptly,” Tony assured her. She thought it was best not to mention that the whole process could take up to a year depending on the precise situation at hand. It was fortunate that she had another brain of her own to pick, but she figured that Other Tony was at two disadvantages—one, that he obviously was as confused about what was going on as everyone else, which meant that she would have to explain basic theory to him before he was at all of use, and two, that he was a guy. It was an inherent disability in Tony’s opinion.

He’d marveled at it some when they’d laid in bed afterwards, when his heart was racing with that sudden anxiety of

“EAT IT, EAT IT, EAT IT, EAT IT.” Tony moved around a bit until he saw a gap in the circle he could look through; some giant of a kid held another boy upside down, smashing his face into a plate of food. Tony felt relief when he realized it wasn’t Peter. Steve got out of the car, coming to stand where Tony was.
“Oh?” Tony asked softly. She didn’t see him, not really. She was still going through her e-mail.
comfortable before, given their circumstances, but now a weight settled on his shoulders as the very atmosphere felt subtly changed.
“No! We don’t need an assist! We’ve got this!” Tony said, just as a doombot bodily slammed into him, its flight systems failing. Tony got knocked off course but he managed to right himself.
“No it’s not,” Kate interjected. Both men turned to stare at her. She shrugged. “I’d rather this get taken care of before the mansion gets blown up. Again. I can get you a shield and you a suit. I’ll help you out, but you’ve got to promise me something first.”
“Funny, Pym never asks me that question. I think he’s getting old,” Francis said.
talk about. And now, every conversation they could have felt like they were dancing around land mines. He wanted to get rid of that.

In all honesty, he wasn’t sure even what topic he
