“Of course you are,” Clint muttered under his breath. Natasha elbowed him in the stomach, hard causing to cough incessantly, “Ow, Nat! What?!”
Thank you to everyone who has been with me since the beginning (you know who you are ;) ) Your comments and kudos gave me encouragements to keep writing this story to the end, and I love each and every one of you.
“I know right? Just when I thought I’m not interested in Alphas, I remember there’s Captain America and I’m doubting my sexuality once again.”
Just as Steve finished preparing the dining room for their dinner, he received a text message from Natasha telling him she and Bucky couldn’t take the kids for the night for shocking reasons.
Steve cleared his throat, and looked back to Tony tearing his gaze away from the blue lights of the holograph, “So how’s your head?”
“Of course you’re weird, Steve. Nobody in their right mind would have volunteered for human experimentation
“Yes, of course, Mr. Stark. Nice to meet you.” he shook Tony’s hand, “and hello, Ulysses.” he greeted the baby, who promptly turned shy and hid his face in Tony’s neck.
“I can see why you’d refrain from talking to him. It’d be weird if you were out there shaking your money maker with some other wahine after boinking him.That stink will follow you around anywhere. If he’s totally psycho, he might put a hit out on you.” Clint said.
Everyone in the lobby stopped what they were doing in favor of looking at the superhero couple. Unaware of the staring, or perhaps just ignoring it, Captain Rogers placed Tony Stark back on his feet and started to help him walk towards the doors.
Ulysses stared back at him for awhile, big eyes flickering back and forth on Thor’s face. There was a tense moment where everyone in the room seemed to be holding back their collective breaths until they heard a small voice said, “No.”
Steve gently kissed Tony’s forehead and gathered his family closer. Through loss and tragedy, they stayed together and grew closer together. Sarah Marie may not be with them physically, but she would always be remembered by those she left behind.
“Jim, you’re one of the best men we know.” Steve gestured to himself and Tony, “We think highly of you and we named Ulysses after you and my own best friend. We can’t think of anyone more appropriate to be his godfather than you. And Bucky, if he ever comes back.” Steve’s voice was a little subdued as he mentioned that last part. Tony placed his hand on his mate’s thighs in a comforting gesture.
“Could you guys please stop making out? Nobody wants to see that,” Peter’s complaints broke the moment much to Tony and Steve’s annoyance. Tony rolled his eyes at his son’s dramaticized complaints and sighed exasperatedly, pulling away from Steve’s embrace.
Tony closed his eyes in relief. They’d be okay, they got this. Steve wouldn’t let him down. He felt Steve tugged his pants down, and covered his groin with Tony’s jacket and knelt in front of him. “Okay, Tony, the next time contraction hits, you have to start pushing, okay? Ready?”
Tony leaned closer to him, resting his body on Steve’s, that precious bump cuddled close to Steve’s side. “Okay. Ulysses it is. Ulysses James Rogers. God, this baby is gonna be the most Irish baby to ever irished in New York City.”
Ever since their vow renewal ceremony, Steve felt like they’ve become those newly-mated couples, regardless of the fact that they have been mated for 18 years. They have always been a loving couple, kissing, touching and initiating contact with each other whenever possible. Their kids would roll their eyes and make gagging sounds whenever they went out together and saw their parents holding hands and kissing like a teenaged couple that just started dating. It was all in good fun, Steve knew, he and Tony just sometimes couldn’t resist pulling their legs with their innocent displays of affections.
attempts by implying that pregnancy was somehow affecting Tony’s ability to work and function normally. God forbid they ever saw a high functioning omega.
“Hey.” Steve greeted him, pressing a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead. He breathed in the comforting scent of Tony, once again noting a hint of sweetness that wasn’t there before. Steve scrunched up his nose in curiosity at the scent that has been lingering around Tony.
“Speaking of special, I met this blonde bombshell tax attorney down at Starbucks this morning. I told her you the kahuna if she wants to have fun on this island.” Clint waggled his eyebrows outrageously and took out a slip of paper from the front pocket of his work shirt, “You want her number? I got right here.”
And Jamie seemed to feel the same way if the glances, the smiles and the touches he gave Joe were any indication. Joe has been raised by his amazingly loving and supportive parents who never hesitated to show him and his siblings how much they loved their sons, his two brothers were his first and forever best friends, his gaggle of uncles, aunts and cousins completed the picture. Joe never lack of love in his life. He knew how it felt like for someone to love you unconditionally and support you no matter what. But the way Jamie made him feel, it was different. Jamie made him feel like he was the most precious human being on Earth, the only one who mattered to him and the only one that would complete him.
“A man was just murdered in the bathroom of your bar, and the only thing you cared about is when you can reopen for business, again.” Sharon squinted her eyes, unwilling to believe an omega, a species whose base instinct was to nurture, could be so callous.
“Tony,” he said reverently after they broke away from the kiss, “Like I said before, Bucky is my past. You and Ulysses are my future. I’m not letting go of you, ever.” Steve pushed their foreheads together, making Tony see the blue of his eyes, so bright and earnest with love and affection. “Never. You’re stuck with me, Tony Stark.”
“You know that’s not true. Steve needs you, he needs your presence. You’re just smarting right now because you think Barnes is more important to him than you are.”
“Yes, so uh, Clint, sorry but it’s just not bar material, you know. You understand.” Steve tried to get in a word edgewise in the face of Clint and Coulson making goo goo eyes at each other, and failing to do so.
Steve settled back in his seats, crossing his arms in front of his chest and debating whether or not he should fetch Tony and Clint from the bar, when Peter ran up to him looking panicked.
Steve was about to devour his first slice of the tomato pie when he noticed Tony not making any move to add food to his own plate. “Tony? Is something wrong?” his mate was covering his mouth with a hand, looking a little green. He looked like he was about to throw up.
“And what does my beloved want me to do to regain the affections I have so tragically lost?” Steve grabbed Tony’s hands and drew him closer to him, kissing his knuckles reverently and shooting Tony a mischievous look.
Damn, this girl is harder to shake than the others before her. What’s with brunettes and being clingy? Tony could practically hear Rhodey’s voice in his head exasperatedly telling him This is why whoring yourself out to horny tourists isn’t a good pastime,Tony
Billy Mays? Steve mouthed confusedly at Natasha. She just sighed the sigh of a person who was done with everybody’s shit and shook her head minutely.
“What does that even mean?” Steve’s brow furrowed in confusion. This all seemed like a recipe for disaster that would make him beholden to yet another dirty New York politician. And he was actively trying to avoid that at this point in his career.
“No point in praying for Thor. He’s already a god.” Steve smiled at his mate, taking the proffered orange juice. Tony, Natasha and Bruce were eating eggs benedict, no doubt cooked by their resident chef Bruce Banner himself. He took a bite out of Tony’s ham, relishing in the salty and fatty taste of the ham mixed with the egg yolk.
There was a resounding silence from the room. Everyone was staring blankly at her, including Steve, who apparently had no plans past asking Tony to renew his vows with him.
“Steve, come here,” Tony beckoned him, holding out his free hand for Steve to take, which Steve did. He sat down next to Tony and angled his body so Tony could lean back against him. “I’m okay,
It was not what Tony deserved their mating ceremony to be though. Tony deserved everything. He deserved the best. He deserved a mating ceremony where all their friends and family were there, celebrating with them and sharing in the joy. Tony deserved a party, a celebration. Not a shotgun mating ceremony at a DC courthouse with two city clerks who was disgruntled because they had a lot of paperwork to go through but was forced to volunteer as mating witnesses. And it still rankled at Steve even eighteen years later that he didn’t give Tony the mating ceremony he deserved. Eighteen years and three sons later, and the shotgun mating ceremony was still on Steve’s mind as something unresolved.
Come evening, Tony was so blissed out by the day’s events that he had a smile permanently etched on his face, it might as well be his new face now. After the pool, they went back to bed where they stayed for the entire day, making love and just spending time together. Now, they decided to take a stroll around the hotel. They still haven’t seen hair nor hide from their children or any of their families. It would be concerning if Tony could muster up any strength of will to freak out but he just didn’t. One look at Steve’s, looking so happy and carefree to have Tony by his side, was enough to push aside any concerns he might have had.
Tony settled down on the floor, back resting against the marble pedestal of the state and let out a groan as another contraction hit him. “Steve, you’re gonna have to help me deliver here.” Tony was sweating despite the comfortable atmosphere of the Tower lobby, his shirt was soaked through. His eyes started to take on that glassy tone Steve saw when he was in pain.
Which brought him to the fact that for the past two months, he has been wearing an adult diaper, which made him not that different from Ulysses. Tony didn’t know that his body was capable of shedding so much uterine lining or that one tiny person --that he loved with all his body and soul-- needed so many biological apparatus to stay alive. He and Steve hadn’t been able to have penetrative sex in two months and if he wasn’t feeling like a human disaster right now, he would be more upset. As it was, he was glad Steve couldn’t see him naked because his previously smoking hot bod was nothing more than a lump of flesh and atrophying muscles with milk squirting out of every orifice. Right now, he wasn’t feeling particularly sexy or desirable.
Steve leaned in and kissed Tony’s forehead. His arms, once again, enveloped Tony and he felt the all encompassing warmth and comfort he always felt whenever he’s in Steve’s arms. “Honey, what he has done to you, what he did to you, it’s not something that can ever be forgotten. You’re so strong, sweetheart. You’re a survivor. And I am humbled everyday that you’ve decided to share your story with me.”
“Handsome, war hero, living legend, and talented artist. If he wasn’t happily mated to Tony Stark, who is my role model and everything I want to be when I grow up, I would be offering myself up to him on a silver platter.”
“Perhaps because the murderer sussed me out as, you know, the type of fellow who’d be smart enough to get rid of it.” In unison, the two knelt down to peer at the gun that Bruce placed back in its initial location at the bottom of the speaker amongst the mess of wires within. “Obviously, he didn’t expect you to be here when I discovered it.”
Happy with today’s turn of events, both Steve and Tony decided to dance their own versions of happy dance while hidden behind the cargo van that separated them from each other’s object of affections. Unbeknownst to them, the cargo van pulled out of the parking space, leaving both of them in full view of the other. Tony recovered first seeing Steve right across from him as he was in the middle performing his “inventing dance” and gasped.
“Oh, it might have something to do with carrying her head around.” Steven explained, “I noticed that none of the gods know where to find her, so she might have some power that afforded her the ability to cloak herself from you. Seeing as her powers remain even in death, it makes sense for that ability to be extended to someone who’s been carrying it. To a lesser extent. But truly, I’m fine. No injuries whatsoever.”
But Steve wasn’t born under the best circumstances. He was smaller than full term babies were supposed to be, and had to spend 3 weeks in NICU after he was born. His lungs were not fully developed, so he had to be hooked up to a ventilator for the first weeks of his life. And in America, being sick was expensive. Steve almost used up his lifetime cap just on his first month of being alive. There was no way Joe and Sarah would be able to afford to keep him in NICU for longer, so they brought him and prayed to God that their son lived through the first year of his life.
“Say it louder why don’t you? I don’t think the people who hasn’t come to school yet heard you.” Joe grumbled at his little brother. He might look annoyed, but inside he was preening with happiness at Peter’s words. It’s still unbelievable to think that he and Jamie finally took the plunge and that they were boyfriends now.
“So wet for me, Tony,” Steve whispered, his eyes not leaving Tony’s slick channel eagerly accepting his finger. He thrust his finger back and forth for a few moment, then deciding Tony was slick enough, added another finger to prod at his Omega’s opening. Tony gasped and moaned louder at the feeling of Steve’s fingers inside of him, more slick started to leak out of him.
At the sound of Steve’s scream, the man started screaming too and jumped out of the bed. Noticing he was buck naked under the covers, the man grabbed the comforter on the bed to cover himself up.
It wasn’t the worst movie night they ever had. And hey, Steve breaking the coffee table kinda counted as an agility exercise for his hand, and Thor got to have Bruce’s attention on him for the remainder of the night. It was pretty much a win-win situation for them all.
“Mmm, that was so good.” Tony hummed. His body was sweaty and the sheets were starting to stick to his back, not that Tony cares. Steve was still trying to catch his breath and slowly lifted his face from where it was hidden in the crook of Tony’s neck to gaze into Tony’s eyes.
“Good. Put him on video call mode.” Ulysses’ confused face was projected on the holograph. Behind him a gaggle of students gathered around a station of laptops, egging each other on as the people typing frantically around the laptop took shot after shots.
“Anthony of Stark, crown prince of Aethiopia. And right now there’s a giant sea serpent waiting to eat me as a sacrifice for Poseidon.” Anthony gestured at the looming form of Cetus who had broken to the surface and was now fast advancing towards them. Steven seemed shocked, but moved fast, grabbing Anthony by the waist and rushed towards his flying steed and the next thing Anthony knew he was clutching at Steven’s waist whilst flying above the ocean astride the flying horse.
Jamie chuckled and flashed him a bright smile, and Joe just wanted to say for the record that his heart most definitely didn’t skip a beat.
His missions were nearing its end. He and the Howling Commandos have successfully dismantled HYDRA strongholds and disrupted their weapon supply lines, decimating them to utter destruction with no hope of rebuilding. They were so close to the finish line. The rest of their lives together could finally begin, something Steve coveted from the moment they met. He wanted it all. The quiet, peaceful celebrations. Building a family and growing old together. He thought of his mother’s wedding ring hidden amongst his personal effects, the one he held on to despite the sickness, hunger and poverty that plagued him, because he wanted to give it to the right partner. When the time was right, Steve would present it to her, asked her the question and spend the rest of his life devoted to her.
The pictures of him that Dad kept were the best things Tony had ever saw. He wasn’t ashamed to admit that he had his first orgasm while staring at a picture of Steve Rogers, looking so heroic like a knight in shining armor, ready to rain down hell fire and hailstorm on anyone who crossed him. Tony long ago accepted that he wouldn’t ever be able to settle down, because his standard for a partner was someone like Steve Rogers. And there was no one else in the world quite like him. And there was something inside him that wouldn’t let him accept just anyone as his significant other. Like there was a barrier between his heart and everyone else’s that prevented him from giving them the entirety of his love and devotion. Tony couldn’t be with anyone like that. It would feel too much like a betrayal for him and for the other person.
The next day, the photo Clint took was framed and displayed prominently in Steve’s studio and a holograph of the photo, scanned by JARVIS, would be floating in Tony’s workshop permanently.
After that day, they got closer together. It seemed having to guard Peter’s secret enabled them to finally break down that barrier that has been keeping them from talking to each other. Nowadays, Joe and Jamie could be found eating lunch together, chatting with each other in between periods or before the start of the school day and Jamie without fail would walk Joe to his classes.
looks, “You two are probably the only people in this whole school who don’t know that you like each other. You look at Joe every time he wasn’t looking and Joe looks at you when
And now, Steve seemed to be going the extra length to spend the day together with Tony, which Tony was totally up for. The last couple of days of their stay hadn’t exactly been stellar, to say the least. First Clint, Sam and Bucky managed to get thrown in jail for getting into a bar fight, then Thor and Bruce left Aurora in an elevator whilst busy arguing, losing her for a couple of hours which managed to get everyone up in arms, thinking someone had abducted one of their own. Then Ulysses got into a fight with some boys who were harassing Joe and Peter on the beach. Although the fight was for a good reason (Steve and Tony weren’t gonna punish Ulysses for protecting his brothers), they still had to halfheartedly give him a speech about words over fists (although Steve really,
“The only reason we’re representing the school was because Joe and Peter aren’t in the Science Olympiad team and would be in DC for the Decathlon.” Jamie elaborated.
“Nah. You have to learn to accept what you did, the only one who could tell if the self-flagellation is enough. And you’re the only who can absolve yourself and what to do to redeem yourself. What any of us think don’t matter.”
“How did you do it?” Tony asked again, “how did you forgive them so easily? You wanted to bring them back into the Union, forgave their crimes, their trespasses, after what they’ve done. They tore the country apart. They killed their own brothers and sisters, spilled their countrymen’s bloods and used it to color the earth red, all in the name of slavery. And you forgave them, wanted to welcome them back with open arms. How?”
For once in their lives, Tony has no solution to a problem and Steve failed to strategize his way out of a conundrum.
“I promise,” Tony solemnly replied and reached out with his hand to caress Steve’s left cheek. Steve covered that hand and brought it to his lips, kissing Tony’s knuckles reverently. “We’ll get through this, Steve.”
“Nope. Did you?” Thor’s tone of voice changed from the deep and foreboding tone to a more lighthearted tone, “‘cause until I get a specific answer to that question, my loyalty’s with you.” he finished, his index finger pointing at Steve to emphasize his words.
Ulysses lifted his from the counter to stare directly at his parents, “After prom. After we danced. She said that since we’re graduating and going to different colleges, it wouldn’t be fair for us to tie each other down with a high school relationship that was gonna end anyway. Said she wanted to get to know other people.”
“A tracking app. I’ve placed a tracking chip in the lining of Peter’s suit without him knowing it, I’m activating it now. Sort of like lo-jacking a car to figure out where it went.”
Sam perked up from his seat and looked around the cabin. Tony and Clint were occupying the three seater seats, sleeping soundly, the sounds of their snores filling the air. Peter was playing with Aurora, trying to distract the baby from the discomfort in her ears caused by the plane taking off. Steve was sitting in one of the chairs, Joe’s sleeping figure sprawled on top of him, Steve still loathed to let him go.
Tony, Bruce and Natasha were also there, eating brunch. Tony was still dressed in his workout clothes, a soft t-shirt and pair of yoga pants that framed his luscious bottom. Steve was torn between making him change so no one else could get a glimpse of his omega’s assets and wanting Tony to keep it on so he could keep staring at them. Tony knew that, that little tease, the smirk he flashed Steve as he sat down next to him on the kitchen counter told him as much.
“Hi,” he softly said, Tony moved from his side of the bed to trap Steve under him. Steve’s mate still looks amazing even after a long night of work. Steve could see the signs of exhaustion on his face, the dark shadows under his eyes that he would get when working too hard.
“You’re pimping me out to tourists again, Clint?” Tony sighed, but reached out for the number anyway.
“Tony Stark, why didn’t you tell me that you’re going into the witness protection program?” Stacy asked. She had spent the most amazing week she ever had in O’ahu. At first, Stacy was unenthused to be going solo on a vacation she supposed to be going with her then-fiance Greg. Greg, who got cold feet in the middle of wedding preparations, and asked for the ring back. Since the honeymoon trip had been planned, she saw no point in asking for a refund and went by herself in this trip meant for two. Meeting Tony Stark in a local bar was the highlight of her trip. The charming billionaire showed her an amazing week in O’ahu, both in and out of bed. Now their week together was over. Standing together at the harbor where they decided to take a walk after brunch, she asked if they could keep in touch but he dropped this bombshell on her.
When they arrived, the bar was empty as it was ought to be since they weren’t slated to open for business until later at 11 AM. Cop cars were surrounding the place and Steve didn’t like how that looked one bit. They pulled up in Tony’s fancy Audi and parked at the side of the bar.
The driver then stepped out of the vehicle, weapons at the ready, only to be shot down the moment she stepped out of the vehicle. Tony jolted in his seat at the violent sight. That was the first time he ever witnessed death at such a close range. His heartbeat ratcheted up rapidly.
“Cap had the strength to bash that guy’s head in against the wall. And you have the--” Coulson trailed off, gesturing to Bruce to continue.
Looking at a holograph of the globe that JARVIS has displayed in front of him, he wondered aloud, “Where do people usually go for some fun but without the added stress of paparazzis, J?”
“Whatever you say, boss.” Quill put his joint back in his pocket. Tony rolled his eyes at the man when Clint asked him “What are you gonna do then?”
Never able to say no to any of his family members, Steve graciously said, “Of course. I’d be happy to, Thor. Have fun with Bruce.”
“No, you’re a Midgardian?” Thor answered, looking unsure at the complete non-sequitur Tony threw at him.
His critics liked to point out that he funded all of those endeavour using money obtained by war-profiteering. Tony would like to rebut that claim by pointing out that he didn’t profit from war, his weapons helped protect American lives. And if those critics minded so much then they were more than welcome to stop eating the foods produced by the intelli-crops Stark Resilient produced, they were more than welcome to stop using medicine and biologics produced from research funded by the Stark Foundation to treat their headaches or psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, they’re also more than welcome to stop going to the doctors who operated on them using medical devices from Stark Med Tech. So far no one took Tony up on his offers.
Tony rolled his eyes and lifting Ulysses up from his high chair and set him on his hips, “What are you, five? I’m not pregnant. And once I prove it to you losers, what am I gonna win?”
” Joe jumped in the conversation, the holographs seemed to have disappeared in favor of teasing his little brother.
Steve kissed him on the forehead, chuckling lightly at the mention of Tony’s frequent borrowing of his socks, “Yeah, you’re here. You’re still here with me.”
“Hmm, I see your derivatives and raise it to differential equations.” Tony said, giving him a chaste kiss on the lips.
“Kaho’olawe at the Concierge’s desk gave me the keys. It’s his family’s church.” Steve answered curtly.
Breakfast during the weekend was always a spectacle in the Avengers household. Between two super soldiers, an Asgardian, growing teenagers and the Hulk, the whole affair wouldn’t be complete without at least a dozen stacks of pancakes or waffles, depending on who’s cooking that day, two dozen eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and anything else in between. However, during the weekdays when everyone had prior commitments or other activities, it was a quiet affair. When Peter got to the kitchen that morning, Babbo was nursing a cup of coffee in his arms, eyes bleary and half closed, which meant he just emerged from the workshop after a night of inventing. Papa was away in Michigan, in a show of solidarity with steel factory workers who were striking and demanding a pay raise. These days, Papa’s Captain America duties involved fights that were more of the equality and social justice kind and less of the punching-the-bad-guys type, though those still occur from time to time. Joe was eating his cereal, there were holographs projected all around him by JARVIS, and he would intermittently stop spooning more cereals into his mouth in favor of manipulating a projection.
That threw Tony so off guard, he started choking on his pasta. “Wha-- Nat, what are you talking about?”
“Ah! Ah! Ah! Steve, Steve…” Tony keened, his eyes shut close. The feel of Steve hot and like velvet steel within his core, filling up empty spaces Tony didn’t even know existed, completing him from inside out, was amazing. Whenever they become one like this, Tony swore he could feel Steve’s heartbeat as his own, his breath as Tony’s breath, the two people becoming one. Steve was hitting Tony’s prostate with great accuracy, sending jolt after jolt of pleasure coursing through his body. Tony felt his cock leaking and his hole producing more slick in response to Steve’s touches and he couldn’t hold it back.
At the sound of gun, both of the injured men looked up from the ground at Thor. Tony saw Steve was nursing a head wound at the side of his temple, but otherwise he looked okay. Just then a second sound of cocked gun hammer could be heard and then Bucky’s was behind Thor, aiming his gun at Thor’s head, “Wanna drop that?” while Sharon walked to where Steve and Sit Well’s brother was still sitting on the back if the truck. Thor disarmed his gun and reluctantly gave it to Bucky who took it with gratitude and Tony strode towards his mate.
“Steve, hon, we’re not in the paleolithic era anymore. I can totally provide for myself.” Tony countered, “our relationship hasn’t exactly been the conventional relationship society called for. For example, I, as the omega, am older than you, not counting the years you spent as a popsicle,” Steve gave him a look, “also, I have more money than you. I make more money than you or anyone else in our pack and our society always said that the Alpha should be the breadwinner of the pack, yet here we are with the omega breadwinner. None of these things ever bothered you before, so being sick for a little bit and having your pregnant omega take care of you for a change shouldn’t bother you either.”
They couldn’t leave until the jet was refueled, so now they were stuck at a gate waiting for the plane to be ready. Also, Bucky and Ulysses still hadn’t returned from being detained by airport security. They were all amazed at how fast Natasha escaped from questioning with none of her weapons confiscated. When asked what she did to get them back, she just grinned at them predatorily and said, “I made them an offer they couldn’t refuse.” There were no more questions raised after that.
Thor sputtered indignantly, “Steven, how could you? I really do want to have a ceremony. If we happen to set a Viking boat on fire, that is just incidental.”
Tony continued chewing for awhile. He stared wordlessly at Steve, knowing his mate was internally wringing his hands and mentally preparing himself for Tony’s complete and utter rejection at the prospect.
Tony decided to go back to the mainland to kickstart the new nuclear fusion reactor technology. It would be too hard for him to teleconference with his scientists and engineers all day. Plus, many nuances in the experiments weren’t easy to write down in a protocol and could get lost in translation. So direct supervision was the only way. He wasn’t even going to be gone forever, just for a couple of months. But from the way Lila, Cooper and Nate was looking up at him at the tarmac, it looked like he was gonna be gone forever.
“Okay, Steve, calm down. You remember the go-bag you packed way, way, way back in the day? You need to grab that and meet me back here, okay? We need to go to the hospital.” Steve ran to the nursery where he stored the go-bag filled with the necessary items for the major event of Tony delivering the baby, “JARVIS, call Happy would you? Tell him we’ve got an emergency. And while you’re at it, call Dr. Rosenberg. We’re finally gonna meet Mini Cap today. Also somebody needs to mop the floor. Soon.”
“We can have that ‘discussion’” Tony used air quotes on the discussion, because it was more of an argument than anything else when they talked about it before, “some other time. Also, do you really want me to pick a fight about this?”
“Yup. Plus there’s a cafe and free wifi inside, we can get warmed up for a bit. I hate walking around in these wet boots.” Ellie made a face at the soaked boots she was wearing. She should’ve spent that extra money to buy waterproof boots.
“JARVIS, do we have the ingredients to make spaghetti?” Tony asked, bouncing Joe up and down on his hips to entertain the baby.
They were ensconced in Natasha’s (their’s, to be precise) room in the barracks, drinking flat champagne and eating canned sardines Steve pilfered from the mess hall. It wasn’t the Christmas Eve celebration Steve envisioned or even wanted for Natasha, but they were in a war and beggars couldn’t be choosers. The fact that they were able to be together on this day was a miracle in and of itself. Steve would take what he could get. War has taught him the fragility of a moment and how easy it was for everything to fall apart.
“Whoever killed this guy had a key or was already in the club,” Thor continued, trying to outline his thought process to his boss.
Jamie said those words with such conviction. Joe could feel the love and affection in his voice, those violet gaze searing with how intense it seemed to be gazing at him. Joe was 95% sure that just one shift in their posture was gonna light the whole thing up on fire. But Joe was curious guy, his curiosity once led to him adding water to sulfuric acid even after he knew that it would cause a highly exothermic reaction that would flame up the acid. The resulting explosion was frightening, yet exhilarating, fascinating and left an indelible mark on him for the rest of his life when some of the exploding acid splashed onto his left arm.
“That’s not how it’s gonna go. We know how this is gonna go.” Bucky reached down, taking out his gun from the holster. Sharon cocked the hammer of her gun, trying to anticipate the shot from her partner. There was only one way this would go: Sharon or Bucky dead on the pavement. And neither was a good solution to the problem. Just then Tony stepped forward, firmly positioning himself between Bucky and Sharon, his back to Sharon effectively shielding Bucky from Sharon’s bullets.
Steve had confided in him about him and Aunt Peggy back in the day. How they had planned to go dancing once the war was over, and how Steve, even until now, had never learned to dance, because he was still waiting for the right partner. As Tony read that text, he was elated yet at the same time, he knew something was wrong for Steve to be sending this message out of the blue. It felt like a goodbye message. And his suspicions were confirmed when JARVIS informed him  targeting sensors at Avengers Tower was triggered and he saw all the intelligence leaks on the internet, courtesy of Natasha Romanov.
“I know,” Steve sighed, “you’re right. I guess I just hate feeling useless. You still have to take care of your work with SI and the Avengers, on top of taking care of me and the boys. I usually help you with those stuff and now I can’t.”
Bucky cut into Sharon’s questioning by informing them, “Blood coagulation suggested that he was shot between 1 and 3 AM.”
They had known each other all their lives, it seemed. They were in the same elementary and middle school together before high school. Joe didn’t know when he started looking at Jamie, all that he knew was that he became gradually aware of Jamie’s presence in his life and each year it grew. Their interactions were short and infrequent, composed mostly of nodding to each other as they passed in the hallway; Jamie helping him get a book down from the highest shelf in the library; Jamie executing a flawless play, zig zagging through hordes of ravenous football players seeking to stop him; Jamie winning a chess game against a classist chess Grandmaster that visited their high school for career day, looking down on them all the while for being educated in the public high school system, Jamie telling him solemnly “Thank you, Sir” as he checkmated the man. But what cemented Jamie’s hold in Joe’s heart and mind was his kindness and how inherently good he was. A long time ago, he defended Joe against bullies who thought he was too opinionated for an omega. Joe would never forget how Jamie stood up for him, those purple eyes shone brightly like potassium chloride set on fire with fury and indignation on Joe’s behalf. They were only nine years old then, Joe had just presented as an Omega and his whole life had just changed. From that moment on, Joe knew he had found the right partner.
Steve looked down at the sandwich, shrugged and gave it to him, “I just wanted to spoil you. Nothing wrong with that, is there?”
Jarvis was silent for a moment, then he straighten up and Bruce mirrored him. “You and I are not in collusion, my friend.”
Tony rolled his eyes. He thought Clint was about to say something profoundly deep and moving about their friendship.
?” Steve interrupted him. How was it so easy for this man to reclass a murder as a mere “unfortunate incident”?
Peggy nailed that right on the head. Steve tend to go overboard with everything that he did, especially with his feelings. He loved too hard, too much and too fast. And true to his dramatic flair, in his haste to build a relationship with Tony, he might have ruined their chances.
The world has the Avengers to protect them. The citizenry of New York, well, they have their friendly neighborhood Spiderman to count on.
Tony laughed and clapped his hands together. “Call Stockholm, J. I want my Nobel prize posthaste. And I’m not sharing it with anyone.”
Tony came to, realizing he has been standing in the middle of the sidewalk with people milling around and walking around him. A few people stared strangely at him, probably thinking he was one of DC’s homeless or drunks walking around the streets in search for more booze or drugs. So far nobody seemed to recognize him, which was all for the better. Tony didn’t think he would have the patience nor the sanity to deal with paparazzi catching a glimpse of what a mess he must look like right now. He stormed out of their suite, not caring whether he had worn the appropriate attire for a walk in the night out in DC. Fortunately the suit jacket he still wore was doing its job in keeping the cold at bay. As Tony took in his surroundings, he saw that he had walked far away from their hotel, and had ended up all the way in front of the World War II memorial on the other side of town. Gazing up at the white marble that built the memorial, Tony tried to imagine what Steve must have felt when he saw this memorial and all the other war memorials located around this place. World War II was supposed to be the war that ended all wars. But then again, that’s what they said about World War I. World War II didn’t end up being the war that ended all wars, rather it became the war that started more wars. Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraq War, and so on and so forth. Tony couldn’t help but wonder if Steve ever regretted plunging that plane deep into the Arctic when in the end his sacrifice to save New York ended up in more lives lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tony wondered if Steve would have approved of that.
“Officer, I think there’s been a misunderstanding here. You’re confusing my uncle with someone else who happened have the same name as him.” Ulysses tried to ameliorate the situation.
Jamie shrugged, “Just wanted a change in scenery. I was talking to Peter earlier in the hallways, and he told me something interesting, something that I very much want to pursue now.” Jamie’s violet eyes twinkled mischievously under the bright fluorescent lights of the cafeteria, locking with his own glacier blue eyes. His charming smile directed at Joe, and he realized that all this time he had been missing out on the full effect of what that smile would make him feel.
Everyone dutifully repeated “World Peace!” while Tony muttered “I’m not saying that,” under his breath.
Not really happy with this chapter. I had massive writers block after finishing up the Discussion section of my paper.
“Tony, if you were really heartless then you wouldn’t care about Bruce’s anxiety problems, or that time our insurance wouldn’t cover Clint’s hearing aids and you paid for them out of pocket. Tony, you’re the most caring, kind and selfless man I know. Heartless isn’t an accurate word to describe you. Passionate is what you are.”
Tony could feel himself blush like a schoolgirl. God, what was it about this man that get him, genius playboy billionaire, all twitterpated. “Well- that is- I’m just doing what anyone would have done.”
“Yes.” Steve answered on their behalf, then with his Captain voice, the one that never failed to make Tony wet, he said “Clint, get over here. It’s almost time for Ulysses’ nap and if you mess up his routine, you will be doing daily drills for the next 6 weeks.”
“Hmm, what else do you have up your sleeve? ‘Cause I think my well’s tapped out for today.” Steve just smirked kindly at him, eyes looking at something behind Tony, which prompted him to turn around to see what caught Steve’s attention. What he saw was something unexpected. At the courtyard, there was a white carpeting lining up the pathway leading up to a wooden gate that was decorated with soft white fabrics, plumerias and stargazer lilies, soft tealight candles decorating each sides of the pathway and marking them. There were white garden chairs on either side of the pathway, swathed in the same cloth that were decorated the gate, creating an aisle in the middle. It almost looked like a set up for a mating ceremony.
Taking a pregnancy test was a lark on his part. Tony’s already in his fifties, his heats have basically stopped. It’s been two years since his last one, so Tony was basically menopausal. And although he and Steve were still very sexually active (Tony would have to be dead not to be sexually active with a mate like Steve), the chances of them conceiving again was zero to none.
Downstairs, Tony was running like a bat out of hell to the Institute, rushing to get to Steve. When the concierge stopped him to ask what his business here was and whether he has an appointment he could only stammer.
He hadn’t told Steve anything about this project, because Tony wasn’t about to give him any false hope. There was still no guarantee that Barnes would ever come back, with him still in the wind, or that the device (he needed to come with a name for it instead of just calling it the device all the damn time) would be able to do what it was supposed to do. Okay, the second point was moot because of course it would do what it was supposed to do, Tony made it after all. He had finished all the final design and JARVIS just needed to fabricate the prototype. Tony decided he’d build it regardless of Barnes’ presence. It would be a good new gizmo to show off at the launching of the September Foundation at MIT, in any case.
“Ma’am, please empty everything out of your pockets,” the disgruntled TSA agent told Natasha through gritted teeth after the metal detector beeped for nth time.
“I mean,” Steve stammered, “this way you’ll be able to find someone new, someone who fit you better?”
“Well then, tell your dad happy birthday from me. And have a good time up at the Dole. I had a great time today. Thank you.” Tony said, moving towards his car that was separated from Steve’s bike by a cargo van.
“I may have been a little bit, a minuscule amount, a teeny tiny bit jealous of Barnes.” Tony managed to mumble out, his face smushed to Steve’s chest to hide his embarrassment.
“Be glad you’re a pasty Brit albino, Jarv.” Sit Well told him. Jarvis furrowed his brow at the non-sequitur. Fury exasperatedly rolled his eye.
“Nonsense. The baby ups my flirting game and desirability. Don’t tell me you don’t wanna kiss me when I carry him around?” Tony jostled Joe up and down in his arms, eliciting a giggle and a toothless smile from the baby. And damn if Steve wasn’t a sucker for those
“No, don’t be. It’s just that...the smell of grease and motor oil remind me of my father. He used to be in the Marine Corps’s Corps of Engineers. And he would go on tour of duty for years at a time, and when he comes back home I’d miss him so much that I’d hug him for at least five minutes.” Steve confided, his blue eyes softening as he remembered when he was young, when the smell of grease and motor oil brought comfort to him. He never thought that he would feel this sense of homecoming and ease from someone he just met.
“While you seem recovered, Captain, I do suggest you still keep with the agility exercises for your fingers and hands. Since you do a lot of hand-to-hand combat, it’s necessary to make sure that the new epidermis has been properly incorporated by the rest of your limbic system.”
“He’s the child of petulance,” Rhodey pointed at Tony, “and stubbornness,” then at Steve, “did anyone expect anything else?”
He supposed he could talk to Steve. Steve, more than anyone, would have understood what Tony was going through. Steve would listen, would lend a helping hand, wouldn’t push him to talk to anyone he’s not comfortable talking to. Steve would take it upon himself to battle Tony’s demons for him and that-- that was why Tony stayed mum about his problems. Steve had been adjusting beautifully to the 21st century. After the two year stumbling block when they were estranged from each other, Steve seemed to be keeping apace with the changes that was now part of his daily life. Tony liked to think that him being by Steve’s side was helping with his adjustment. Steve still had nightmares and bad days, though the frequency seemed to lessen as the months went by. He wasn’t the same Steve that Tony knew in 1942, the ice nap had ensured that, but he seemed happier, less troubled than the first time Tony saw him all those months ago on the Helicarrier. Steve seemed to enjoy this life that they have together, the easy coexistence they had, how they seemed to fill each other’s empty spaces, making each other happy and content with each passing day that they would wake each other up with loving caresses and kisses.
“Jamie!” Peter squeaked out, not expecting to see his schoolmate and his big brother’s forever crush standing in front of him. Nice Blond Lady was Jamie’s mom. Oh God. It was a small world, after all.
“I don’t think that’s true,” she finally said, “But I do think it’s time you joined the land of the living and go out for a drive. Didn’t you say you’ve been dying to take out the newly restored Camaro?”
“So I just want to say that just because James Barnes and I went on a couple of dates that are clearly not going anywhere, though he refused to admit nor accept it, does not mean I have to go to jail.” she finished, leaving Nick and Sharon floored at the new revelation. They turned to look at Barnes who was standing at the corner rubbing his forehead in annoyance.
“Happy to be of service, Winghead.” Tony answered, “And now a little evening stroll to finish the day. Perfect,”
“Anthony, listen to me. I want to, I really do. I just--” Steven sighed and ran a hand through his hair in frustration. How was he supposed to explain everything to Anthony? His whole life had been one bewilderment after another. Would Anthony still accept him if Steven told him everything? “I’m no royalty, Anthony. I’m the son of a fisherman from a small island
“Yeah, man. They’ll turn up, mission all done and demanding pizza and a Bacall movie marathon when they got home.” Sam added. “On that note,” Sam resumed the game and the music started again.
At Tony’s question, Steve broke. The fragile dam holding his emotions together broke open at the obvious pain and distress Tony was feeling. Subconsciously, Steve knew he should be strong one. He’s not helping Tony one iota by breaking down and crying in front of him. Steve shouldn’t be the one crying, he wasn’t the one who had to feel the physical pain of losing a child, to feel that bond breaking away and helpless to do anything about it but to just let it happen. And yet, it was him who was crying. It was him who was sobbing big ugly cries, his chest heaving uncontrollably in front of his mate who was miscarrying their fourth child. A little brother or sister for Ulysses, Joe and Peter, who was gone before their brothers ever knew they existed.
“Come here, babes.” Tony beckoned him, needing his boys close to him and patting the empty spot on the couch next to him. Steve obliged, arms slowly moving back and forth in a swinging motion to lull Ulysses to sleep and dropping down to the couch next to Tony. Ulysses’ eyes started to droop, satisfied with his latest meal. Tony immediately snuggled up to Steve and Ulysses, throwing his arm around Steve’s waist and nuzzling in closer to his mate.
“But he-- he’s--” Tony felt a lump in his throat, there was something blocking his windpipe. He reached out to touch Steve’s intact hand, needing to ground himself with his mate’s touch, but the med crew stopped him.
Joe walked back to the house, entering through the kitchen to find James doing reps on the kitchen counter. “What’s for dinner tonight, James?”
“He’s been running around the lobby telling people to kiss him because he’s Irish.” Natasha offered from her perch on the stool, “I had to drag him back upstairs before somebody filed a restraining order against him.”
,” Tony murmured to Joe, and kissed the boy’s forehead, “You too, Papa.” Tony gave him a peck on the lips, “Later.” Tony winked.
“Thanks, buddy,” Tony muttered faintly. His entire being hurt from being body slammed by Steve. Goddamn, it felt like a refrigerator fell on top of him.
“Nothing’s gonna happen, Tony. Because nothing’s going on in your workshop except you sending an empty suit to greet me when I come home.” Steve slammed the door of the workshop open to find Tony sitting on his work desk with a console that seemed to be controlling the Mark 42 armor that had been following Steve from the living room.
, like he was in the presence of a similar blue glow a long time ago, longer than he would be able to remember. The arc reactor hummed with energy, the chemical reactions happening within fueling the energy production, infinite and sustained. Right now, it only provided partial power to the factory, with the other half of the energy source a conventional fossil fuel powered plant. It made Tony’s skin itch just thinking about it.
However, there was something that was different from his previous pregnancy and that was the frequency of caffeine headaches he was getting. With Ulysses, once he reached the three month mark, his headaches disappeared as his body adjusted to not having the stimulant anymore. But now, he still get headaches in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon. So far, he’s been shrugging it off as his body not adapting as fast as it should, but somehow today felt different.
“I do renounce him.” Bucky said, holding back a chuckle as he placate Ulysses who was reaching for his prosthetic limb.
It probably said something about Steve that the only other time he felt alive in two years, aside from rediscovering Tony, was when he was fighting for his life against a horde of Loki’s alien army. Yes, there actually was an army from space. Turned out, Steve’s life could get weirder. Hey, if the love of his life could be reborn and they would meet again seventy years in the future after Steve just happened to be frozen in ice, then the appearance of an alien army in downtown Manhattan was just another day in the park.
“Have you guys thought of having a funeral?” Clint asked after everyone settled down in their spots.
Steve examined the baby in his arms with a solemn face, stroking the baby’s face, wiping away the mucus and afterbirth, before he put his mouth over the baby nose and mouth and inhaled over it. Steve spat out something Tony couldn’t see to the floor and lo and behold, their son took his first breath and started crying his lungs out. Everyone around them broke out in applause and cheering, it seemed that everyone was as invested in the labor as Tony and Steve was.
Steven nodded. “I remembered a time when I was a little boy when I was so sickly and frail. I contracted every disease in existence, there was never a time I was healthy enough to go and play outside with the other children. My parents thought I wouldn’t live past fifteen, she was already preparing my funeral pyre. But one of my siblings stepped in and healed me and at great risk to himself, because of Hera’s insistence that no Olympian interferes in any of her affairs lest they risk her wrath. So I was healed and I was able to survive to adulthood and now here I am.”
Just then, Sharon poked her head out from the hallway leading to the restrooms, “Hey, we’re ready for you.” Tony nudged Steve to walk ahead of him, not looking forward to seeing a dead body ever. He had never seen a dead body before. When his parents died, the police asked him to identify the body, but Tony was too distraught to be able to so he sent in a proxy, his dad’s business partner Obadiah Stane. Steve, though, he was in the army special forces. He was more than used to seeing dead bodies; he’s seen more than he’d prefer to. Now as they walked to the restroom where a dead body was waiting for them, Tony held tight to Steve’s arm, relishing in the comfort his mate gave him.
When Steve retrieved a black leather jacket from one of the compartments attached to the bike, Tony whimpered softly. Steve in a black leather jacket looking like some kind of avenging Hell’s Angel was more than his brain could handle in one day.
“Is this your way of saying I stink? I admit I haven’t showered since this morning and when I was feeding Aurora her lunch today she kinda threw her lunch on me. Apparently bananas aren’t worthy of Asgardian princesses.”
Before Joe could answer that and before Peter could get rid of more damning evidence of his identity as Spiderman, Peter’s door slammed open revealing Ulysses, wearing a Mets baseball jersey on the other side.
Steve needs to wake up. They are so close to starting something together. Something wonderful, and something bigger than themselves. As Tony sees it, they are the pin that brings the Avengers together. The way they seamlessly worked together during the invasion of Manhattan, despite never working together before, is more than enough evidence to know that they could be great together. He and Steve are the key. Tony has opened himself up to Steve, makes himself vulnerable as they gradually build their friendship, this friendship that is slowly morphing into love. All he needs is for Steve to wake up.
Ulysses giggled, seeming to realize his mission to make his Papa smile was accomplished and focused his attention back on his food.
owners and employees, “taken away from him by persons unknown who shot him in the chest, then hid it here thinking that Jarvis would find it, panic and throw it away because he’s, well, English.”
“Gotcha. Yeah, right.” Loki’s eyes lit up in amusement. It seemed the employees of this place knew one of their own were probably responsible for this man’s murder and were trying to cover it up. How interesting. Loki couldn’t wait to see how this unfolds. “None of us did. Very good. Murder most foul.” he concluded, winking at Coulson. The bartender placidly retrieve his phone back from Loki, wondering what he just got himself into.
“You know I wouldn’t say no to that, hot stuff. Definitely not gonna say no if you want to wear the Stealth suit to bed. Especially now that I’ve overhauled your whole catalog. The suits are doing your ass justice. ”
“Speaking of love, when do I get to see your beautiful face? I’ve been missing you, fella,” Steve turned to the armor, voice turning low and husky, “I really want to kiss you, Tony.”
Joe strode up to Peter who was already sitting at their usual table with Ned, eating his usual lunch for three. Ever since his transformation, Peter was always hungry. Joe theorized that his little brother now has the same enhanced metabolism as Papa. He wasn’t satisfied with the usual double portions at dinner, some days he could even out eat Papa and Uncle Thor.
“Much.” Steve tentatively moved back towards Tony, reaching his hand out for Tony to grasp. Tony did, and they settled back down to their previous position. In this dim light, it was easy to think that they were the only two people in this world.
Natasha sighed, “You’re lucky you’re pretty,” Steve shot her an offended look, “I’m just going to point something out here: we
“Tony was the only one inside the club.” Steve said. The two Alphas then became silent as the meaning of their discussions and what it implied hit them. Thor stared steadily at his boss. He knew Steve was processing the facts and what he knew so far about the situation. In the army, Steve had gained a reputation of being a master tactician. His ability to formulate plans and strategies was second to none. Steve was a natural born leader, and Thor knew this when he first started working for Tony and Steve. As another Alpha, Thor also knew that the instinct to protect and keep one’s mate were ones that couldn’t be ignored. In Thor’s mind, everything seemed to suggest that Tony had done something with the guy and Steve had murdered the man for getting too close to or threatening Tony. Thor wouldn’t blame him, if he were put in the same position as Steve, he would probably do the same thing.
“I’m fine, Tony.” Steve assured him, though Tony didn’t seem mollified by it. “I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?”
Steve’s laughter trailed after him as Peter sprinted to the kitchen to make sure that there was still enough biscuits and gravy for him. Suddenly he was so very very hungry, he could eat a whole horse. Heck, maybe the whole barn full of them.
“Smart and beautiful, what a specimen you are.” Anthony winked at him, Steven’s heart rate ratcheted up faster. “I’ve a blade hidden on my person. I was going to escape the chains and kill the sea monster before it ever has a chance to eat me.” Anthony unveiled the small blade he had been hiding underneath his ceremonial robes. He might have underestimated the size of the sea monster that he had to kill, “But then you and your flying horse came along and threw a monkey wrench to the plan.”
“I have instructed an intern to run to the pharmacy and fetch some home pregnancy testing kits for you, Sir.”
“We hit puberty at the same time, you dick. It was a weird time for everyone involved.” Jamie grumbled, “it’s for nothing anyway. What would he want with some middle class guy from a blue-collar family when he’s basically inheriting the most successful tech company in the world?”
Somehow, Thor managed to look even prouder than Steve for Tony’s pregnancy. Which was a feat in and of itself, considering Steve was the one who actually put the bun in the oven, so to speak. Thor kept insisting that his presence in the Tower was what made it possible for Tony to conceive as he was also known as the God of Fertility. Thor giving himself credit for a pregnancy not of his own making was only slightly weirder than Natasha giving him lactation soup.
“Oh honey,” Peter heard Papa said. There were unshed tears in his brilliant blue eyes that Peter always loved, “We are always, always proud of you. It doesn’t matter if you change the world in a blink of an eye, or if you fall flat on your face doing what you love the most. You, Joe and Ulysses are the best parts of your Babbo and I. You don’t have to do anything to make us feel proud of you but to exist.
Not to sound like the old man that Tony often accused him of being, but contemporary works paled in comparison to what he used to read. There were some that were good, but a lot of them were just not well written and full of cliche. But out of all the books Steve had read in his life he has a soft spot for one particular book:
“Steve Rogers?” Tony tried again, stopping in front of him, “Can I ask you a question? do you know who I am?”
“That’s it?” Steve peered closer into his eyes. Damn, having a perceptive Alpha who was also a master tactician was starting to be a hassle when it came to hiding secrets.
“More than,” Tony stretched languorously, his movement limited by the knot in him. He grinned satisfactorily, thinking he probably looked like a cat that got the whole gallon of cream. Well, judging by how he feel down there, a gallon of cream is probably not that far from the truth.
“Jamie, what was that all about? How come Spiderman knew our last name? And your name?” Mrs. Wilde looked at her son in confusion. Jamie was silent as he put an arm around his mother’s back and began to walk away from the alleyway and towards their house.
Anthony opened his mouth again to answer the man but the splashing sounds from the ocean reminded him once again of what’s at stake. “Look, I don’t have time to explain, but it is a matter of life or death. If you can help me reach that metal strip over there so I can get out of this bondage, I’ll gladly explain everything to you.”
“Well here we are, in this fantastical, floating island just the two of us. You’re the one who intend for us to get to know each other better, to court. So now, ask me questions. Get to know me so I can get to know you.”
“Steve…” Tony gasped out, helplessly. He could feel a rising wave of panic and anxiety building up inside of him. “Is he--”
“Thanks, Papa.” Peter said before Papa enveloped him and Babbo in a bear hug, Joe joining a few seconds later in their hug pile. Peter reveled in the combined scent of his family, imparting comfort and contentment all throughout Peter’s body.
Once finished, Clint turned his attention to Ulysses who was blowing spit bubbles over Tony’s shoulder. “Hi, baby boy!” he greeted, “Look at you! Look at those bug eyes!” Clint cooed at him, “Did you have breakfast yet?”
“There’s a lot to like, Dad.” Steve smiled softly, reaching for the pineapple and setting it on the table. It’s firm enough that it wouldn’t turn to mush when he baked it for the Upside Down pineapple cake he always made for Dad’s birthday, “since we’re not going to pick a pineapple for your birthday, promise me we’re going for Thanksgiving.”
”. Once that was done, Tony turned his attention to Ulysses, who had little Aurora perched on his shoulder, and was taking a selfie with Sam and Bucky with the beach as the backdrop,
“This is a travesty. I’m Italian and I can’t even stand the sight of meatballs.” Tony lamented, “this baby is too Irish.” he glared at Steve.
Steve just fixed him with an indulgent look. Steve didn’t mind one bit whenever he had to change diapers and Ulysses peed on him, much to Tony’s great amusement. Or that one time Steve wanted to bond with Ulysses and initiated skin-to-skin contact with the baby and placed him on his bare chest and Ulysses shat on him. Clint and Sam didn’t let him live that down for a week. Actually they still weren't letting down on that.
love. But that’s not the case. Someday, you’ll meet someone else, someone who, while they might seem like they’re different from you,” his eyes glanced up at Tony’s smiling brown ones, “turned out to be someone who complete your jagged edges. And someone who worked towards the same goals, just with a different approach. And that someone, they would stand by you no matter what. You’ll meet them someday,
Behind them, Sharon looked around as she took in the lively atmosphere of the bar. It’s as if nothing terrible ever happened here. As she started to walk towards the bar for a drink, Pierce approached her to whisper something in her ear. At his words, all of the pieces came together. She knew who killed Rumlow.
“And what do you propose we should spend the day doing then, hmm, without kids to run around after?” Tony asked him, shooting Steve what he hoped was a sultry smile.
Loki looked up at the bartender from where he was despondently nursing his glass of scotch, “Means nothing to me-- a best-selling pulp-crap crime novelist. I trade in death daily. Theoretically.” He downed his scotch in one go.
“Maybe if you had a picture of him alive? I’m good with faces, but only live ones.” Natasha replied serenely. “Perhaps you have a picture of him while he’s still alive.”
Tony still looked shell-shocked, sitting on their bed with his mouth gaping open, so Steve answered for him, “Yes, yes we will be able to go to Stockholm in December.”
Tony returns to his post by the side of the bed, glancing out at the window before returning his gaze back to Steve A subtle twitch from the hand that was in his hold startles Tony. He waits with baited breath as Steve’s eyelids start to flutter open. Those blue eyes he longs to see start to open, blearily taking in the situation around him. Tony smiled in relief.
“Mr. Stark, please. We have to move now. You can come and wait outside of the operating room.” then they hustled away, carrying Steve’s gurney with them and leaving Tony behind.
It was also a critical moment in the pregnancy. They haven’t passed the 10 week mark so the chances of miscarriage was still high. They haven’t told anyone yet, not wanting to give anyone false hope or unnecessary excitement if everything fell through. Tony placed his hand on his stomach, rubbing it gently just like how Steve did when he was pregnant with the boys, but somehow it didn’t quite have the same comforting effect as it did when Steve was the one who gave him the rub. Tony tried to shake off his unease and focused on his boys who are here with him.
From behind the two-way mirror, Bucky and Sharon watched the whole encounter with discerning eyes. “Still think it could be him?” he asked Sharon.
Steve and Tony were summoned again to the precinct where Bucky and Sharon worked. They had told the couple that they have identified their murder victim, and would like to share the new information with them. They were accompanied by Nick, as their lawyer, and the three of them were waiting in the interrogation room. The day’s events had left Tony feeling tired, more so than usual and he resorted to laying his head on Steve’s shoulder as they waited. Steve turned his head and pressed a kiss on Tony’s forehead, eliciting a smile from Tony as he looked up at his Alpha and pursed his lips for kiss from Steve, one that Steve gladly bestowed upon him. Steve breathed in the scent of his mate, noticing a subtle difference in Tony’s scent. He chalked it all up to the whirlwind of the day causing Tony to stress out a little bit and affecting his natural scent. After all of this was over, Steve vowed to take the two of them out of Brooklyn for a while for a relaxing vacation somewhere far away.
Tony had somehow unearthed more of Steve’s old stuff from God knows where. That morning they had gotten a call from Pepper about a Stark Industries warehouse in upstate New York. And Howard, despite Steve’s displeasure in how he treated Tony as he was growing up, was an excellent hoarder who happened to keep Steve’s belongings from his time in the European war theater. Which happened to include his battered copy of
Steven chuckled at Anthony’s barrage of questions. They were entertaining to say the least. Anthony’s never ending curiosity and his obvious delight at flying was mesmerizing to watch, “As far as I know that is what happened with Athena. Zeus had a splitting headache and he ordered Ares to split his head open with a Minoan axe to ease the pain. When Ares did what was asked, Athena sprung out, fully armored and holding this shield,” he pointed to the shield slung across his back, “as for Aphrodite, the sea foams were actually formed by Uranus’ genitals after it was severed and thrown into the sea.” Anthony made a face at the mention of severed genitals and Steven laughed at his expression, “and yes, Hera does hate all of us demigods and other Olympians sired by Zeus and his paramours. It makes for very interesting stories we tell each other when we meet. You and your cousins exchange stories about how your lessons fare, well my siblings and I share stories on how we survived Hera’s latest attempt to kill us.”
...only to see a strange man, who was apparently the one who greeted him, sleeping in his bed with him. Steve had no idea who he was, how he got here and what he was doing in his bed. So Steve did the only thing he could think of: Steve screamed bloody murder and jumped out of the bed.
“Well I’m telling you, you’re wrong. First, you’re as much as a dumb jock as yours truly, which is to say not at all. What kind of dumb jocks will be representing Midtown High in the New York Science Olympiad?”
Tony and Steve looked at each other, debating whether or not they should start explaining developmental biology and genetics to their 4 year old.
“Love you, too.” Tony kissed his palm and nuzzled into it. Steve leaned down to rest his body on top of Tony, taking care not to put his whole weight on top of his mate, wanting to be close to him and revel in the intimacy of the moment. Tony started stroking his hair, calloused fingers gently caressing him and Steve focused on feeling his touch and steady beat of his heart. Steve prayed that there never would come a day when he couldn’t hear the beating of Tony’s heart. His only hope was that when that day dawned upon them, Steve’s heart would stop too so he wouldn’t have to bear living in a world without Tony. He felt Tony pressed a kiss on the top his head, soft and loving, and Steve closed his eyes in contentment.
“Right. You know, tell HYDRA that unless they’re willing to kill me, it’s over.” Steve declared, “And one more thing, anything happens to my mate, it’s you I’m coming after.”
It was almost 5 AM in the morning when Tony Stark finally came home. His mate was sleeping soundly in their bed, but wakes at the sound of their bedroom door opening. He has always been a light sleeper, Tony notes. His years in the military taught him to wake at the drop of a hat. Tony took of his loafers and his black blazer as he enters the room, unceremoniously dropping them on the floor, then his slacks follows. His mate will probably grouse and complain at him in the morning about their room being an unkempt mess, but right now Tony has better things to do than worry about properly disposing his clothes in the laundry basket.
“What’s going on?” Steve heard and felt Tony came up behind him as his mate placed his hand on the small of Steve’s back. He was wearing Steve’s dress shirt , the one he threw into the laundry bag yesterday, and nothing else. Tony had a penchant for wearing Steve’s used clothes, he said it made him feel more comfortable surrounded by Steve’s scent. And also Tony knew how much he affected Steve by strutting around looking like he’s Steve’s in Steve’s borrowed clothes. But that didn’t mean Steve was okay with letting other people get a glimpse of Tony’s body.
“Well technically, Happy lives here. Clint and the squirts practically live here, they’ve colonized the sun room, the living room, the kitchen, the pool and everywhere else. Also, I gave you a room here, all you have to do is just use it. JARVIS is here, So are DUM-E, U and Butterfingers. See, not lonely. Plenty of people around me.” he answered.
Tony was starting to remember why even after eighteen years, they never had a family vacation together.
This was not in any of those pregnancy books Bruce and Pepper bought Steve, but he could handle this. One of his greatest assets was adaptability. He survived waking up seventy years in the future, Tony’s pregnancy eccentricities would have nothing on him.
Sam paused the game, causing the three of them to look Tony’s way. “Sam’s singing? I agree. But he insisted on singing.” Sam shot Bucky a dirty look and punched him on his fleshed arm.
“He still looks at you the way my parents look at each other when they thought the other wasn’t looking, so yeah it’s pretty safe to say that he still likes you.”
Peter laughed and self-consciously rubbed the back of his neck, “I mean, I didn’t exactly went out seeking superpowers, you know. It kinda happen accidentally. You remember that field trip to Oscorp?”
Joe just wished there was a way to get an answer from the Alpha. But short of just asking him point blank, he didn’t know how else to go about it. What if it was all in his head, and he was making something out of nothing?
Tony pondered for a moment. “Sometimes I wonder if he stayed because he felt guilty because his best friend turned out to be my parents’ murderer.”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re right. Jamie, would you mind--?” Joe gestured to Peter’s unconscious body, heavy in his lap.
“I learned a lot from reading Loki Laufeyson’s books.” Bruce nodded casually, side stepping Tony’s concerns that his friend just took the fall for a crime nobody among them committed.
Tony showed no signs of waking up, so Steve propped him against his body, hugging the armor to his body, bringing his face closer to Tony’s when the Hulk roared out in fury and jolting Tony awake.
“Everything’s gonna be okay, Tony. Everything’s gonna be okay. We’ll be okay.” Steve reassured Tony, still with a panicked look on his face and still unable to absorb the fact that their child was coming soon.
, Steve,” Natasha clinked their glasses together, it always pleased Steve whenever she spoke German, a sign that she was comfortable enough to share a remnant of her past with him, “Here’s to many more Christmases to celebrate with you.” Natasha looked beautiful tonight, her amber eyes warm with contentment. Brown hair tied back in a loose braid that she swept over to her left shoulder, wearing one of Steve’s Army issue shirts and lounge pants. She had been overworking herself, as usual, Steve thought ruefully, the bags under her eyes a testament to the fact. Steve had to carry her out of her lab, not that she minded, and promised her increasingly tawdry sexual favors to get her to take a break at least for the night.
Steve was a gorgeous, handsome man who loves his family, and probably little kids and puppies too. And Tony met him in some out of the way diner because one of his cars just happen to break down near the diner Steve happen to frequent. If this wasn’t serendipity then Tony didn’t know the meaning of the word.
So Natasha need clothes, and she liked to drag him all over Fifth Avenue to shop for clothes. Ostensibly because Tony has good taste (which, of course he did). During one of their many outings to look for maternity suits for Tony (being pregnant with badly swollen ankle was apparently not an excuse to get out of galas, according to Pepper) Natasha shared some of her backstory and the fact that part of her “training” had included a radical hysterectomy which obliterated any chances of her ever conceiving a child. She confided in Tony that not being able to have kids wasn’t something that bothered before. Her life was unsuitable for that, but now they have some semblance of normalcy and with Tony pregnant, those dark thoughts, as she liked to call them, started to loom.
“What do you want me to do?” Tony’s aware his tone has turned hostile by now. But it’s the last thing on his mind now. Steve’s breaking up with him! “Be some stupid chapter in your scrapbook and go on my merry way?!”
Bruce took the pregnancy news in stride. Tony tried to make him his primary obstetrician, which was promptly shot down by both Bruce himself and Steve. Really, who would be better equipped than Bruce to handle a superhuman pregnancy? The man has superserum running through his veins too. Granted, it was the fucked up form of superserum that turned him to a green rage monster, but still. The point Tony tried to make was that Bruce would be more than capable of being an OBGYN. But he kept insisting that he still wasn’t that kind of doctor and that Tony should go to an actual OBGYN for his monthly checkups.
Steve pressed a chaste kiss on Tony’s lips. “There’s nowhere else I’d rather be, Tony. If I have to go through everything again, I wouldn’t hesitate if I get to have you and our family in the end.”
He shook Tony awake, hoping to spare him the pain of nightmares. Tony woke up and with him waking up, the mark 42 that previously greeted Steve on his arrival home was suddenly in his face, grabbing his throat and pinning him down to bed, a sentinel guarding Tony against any and all threats.
It was the day after his twenty first birthday. After a night spent partying and drinking (finally legally), he showed up at the Stark Industries headquarters for his inaugural day as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Stark Industries, eager to leave his mark on the company, to lead Stark Industries out of the military industrial complex and on to bigger, better and frankly, more benevolent things.
“We should go,” Jamie squeezed his shoulder as he knelt down, “somewhere warmer so he could rest better.”
“Nope. He’d have taken credit and used it to scare your brother. He had nothing to do with Rumlow’s murder. Let him go.”
“Oh, well,” Bruce blushed and stuttered endearingly, “that’s-- I’m glad. It’s done, if you wanna have some dinner,” he gestured to the kitchen.
“Thank you, JARVIS.” Tony sighed in relief. He blinked his eyes again, adjusting to the dim lights JARVIS must have put on to alleviate Tony’s fear (no, not fear. Aversion) of the darkness. It was Winter in California, or whatever passed as Winter in a state like California, the skies were still dark outside, dark enough for Tony to make out some faint twinkles of the stars. Tony’s hand fell on the other side of the bed, untouched and tidy as the person who usually occupied it was away on a mission in South America.
“What’s for lunch, babe?” Tony started walking around the kitchen counter, poking at the cold cuts Steve pulled out of the fridge earlier.
Peter didn’t even know how it happened. One second he was taking pictures of the lab for the school newspaper with his new DSLR camera, a birthday present from Uncle Sam, and the next second he felt something painful on the back of his right hand. At first he just shrugged it off as phantom pains and went back to what he was doing previously, putting the whole ordeal at the back of his mind.
Tony got up from the couch to fetch himself something to drink. All the sugar from the orange juice was making him thirsty. As he walked to the kitchen, he could feel something in him shift. Dismissing it as gas (he’d been having a lot of those lately thanks to Ulysses) he continued his trek to the kitchen when a popping sound stopped him in his tracks followed by what could only be described as a waterfall of amniotic fluid gushing out of his nether regions.
“We won.” Steve told him after they broke apart, faces still inches away from each other. Tony’s amber eyes hazy and trained on his lips, “Alright…” he said faintly, “Hey, alright. Good job team. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Steve, baby, have you ever tried shawarma? I saw a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.” then he started rambling in the most adorable way possible and Steve was helpless to do anything but smile indulgently at him.
“Steve’s giving a keynote speech at a DSA event. He’d be gone the whole day,” Tony answered placidly, graciously leaving out the part that Thor knew about Steve being away for the day because he saw Steve leaving this morning.
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony said, stepping up to the cashier and giving his and Happy’s order to the man manning the counter and paying for their lunches.
“I know, sweetheart, I know you’re hungry.” Steve softly murmured to his baby, walking towards the couch. Seeing his mate and child approaching him, Tony sat up and flashed them a tired smile.
“That’s what babies do. They grow and change. In fact, that’s what people do. They change when you weren’t paying attention to them.” What the fuck, Tony. That was not how you were supposed to initiate this discussion.
Together, they tag teamed the necessary preparations for the day. First, Bucky got rid of the leftover pineapple upside cake that Steve made. Then, Bucky took the gray shirt and jeans Steve had been wearing today and put it in the washing machine. Then he went outside to the locked freezer and retrieved a pineapple for tomorrow’s birthday cake again. Once those were done, he went upstairs to Steve’s bathroom and refilled the shampoo and body wash to the level it had been this morning.
“Certainly, Captain.” then the elevator moved speedily up to the Penthouse of the Tower where they resided. As soon as the elevator stopped and opened its doors, Steve stepped out and walked to the nursery where Ulysses was currently sleeping. He gently opened the door, not wanting to wake the boy up and walked silently to peer into the crib. His baby boy was sleeping soundly, his favorite Iron Man and Captain America plushies clutching in each hand. He looked so peaceful in slumber, so different compared to the boy he was two weeks ago, in the throes of teething and constantly in pain.
Steve chuckled, “Been overworking yourself lately, Shellhead. We’re supposed to still be on a honeymoon.”
Tony’s lips underneath his went slack and his hand stopped stroking Steve’s cock. Concerned, Steve opened his eyes to look down at his mate. Tony’s eyes were scrunched closed tightly, lips slightly open. He didn’t look like a man who was enjoying himself in bed with his Alpha. He look troubled.
” Babbo relented, “JARVIS, will you please add my electronic signature to Petey’s permission slip and send it to Peter’s teacher?”
“Funny, ‘cause that’s what Joe says about you,” Peter cheekily replied, “Except he doesn’t call you pretty. You’re the ‘embodiment of High Renaissance male beauty ideal and that Michaelangelo’s
“Uh, just, you know, ask him if he wants to renew our vows and maybe spend the rest of his life with me, and then you know have a ceremony when we get back.”
“Flatterer,” Joe murmured out, his body warm with affection for the boy in front of him. They must have stared at each other like love sick idiots for awhile before Joe remembered why he was still here in the first place, “Um, so, I’m just waiting for Peter. He’s on patrol today,” Joe lowered his voice, cautious of prying ears and eyes though it didn’t seem he should be worried about it since they were the only two people left in the hallway, “But I’m worried. He should have been done by now. I’ve called him but he’s not answering.”
” Babbo started swooning dramatically, putting his hand on his chest and his eyes started fluttering dramatically, “I remember the days of feeling twitterpated and that other person was the only thing I could think of.”
“Wait, I see you sitting there by yourself, and so am I. Do you want to have breakfast with me?” Steve’s voice stopped him midtrack. Tony could feel his face breaking out into a huge grin, as he answered, “Oh, okay, sure.”
So, they couldn’t have been more different: the outspoken critic and the apolitical person. Yet, these never seem to be an issue in their marriage. Tony knows Steve has no issue with his light interests in politics, and Steve knows that it isn’t as if Tony doesn’t care. He just has other things to concern himself with like trying to help Bruce solve the acceleration of dark energy expansion of the Universe before those snobby astrophysicists at CERN.
Outside, they found Bucky and Sharon at a standoff. Nick and Pierce were standing to side, tensely watching the entire thing unfold. Steve felt Tony behind him where they stood by the bar’s back door. Sharon had her gun pointed at Bucky, who was standing across from her, hands held up in surrender.
“When did this happen? Where was I during all of this?” Steve was trying hard not to raise his voice, but he was starting to get upset by Tony’s duplicity.
, why did he choose to tell Tony now! They were so happy before. Why did he have to go and ruin everything!
Tony nodded forlornly, “Yeah. I’d spend the whole day with him and by the end of it we’d be together again.”
“She did. She would tell me stories about how they met and how they got married. Dad’s family settled in Boston, you see. He had a little sister, I think. I might still have some cousins up there, or maybe second cousins.” Steve told Tony.
“What?” Tony shrieked, “My baby is part spider!” he then rushed to Peter and hugged him to his chest, surprising Peter who let out a squeaking voice, “Wait, you said the spider that bit you was radioactive. What about-- did it affect you?”
Being the Avengers fan girls that they were, they immediately rushed to the tower. Once inside they saw the many, many tourists that had the same idea as them. There were a crowd of people in front of the Avengers statue, taking pictures and selfies. The appropriately named Avengers Café was packed too. Brianna and Ellie made a beeline for the statue, waiting for their turn to take a picture. From her position in the line, Ellie observed the statue, noting and observing the beauty and grandeur of said statue. The sculptors did an amazing job on this statue. By making the statue in the fashion of the classical Greek statues, they cemented the Avengers’ status as people who were larger than life, heroes and saviors, more legend than fact. A shiver crawled up Ellie’s spine as she gazed at the statue in amazement. It was so different than seeing it from pictures on the internet. If she wasn’t a fan of the Avengers before this, then she definitely was one now.
Tony had to nip that shit in the bud. He wasn’t about to invite General Hospital and Wendy Williams in to his Tower, okay? It would be detrimental to Ulysses’ early growth and development. So as soon as Dr. Rosenberg cleared him and Ulysses, he (made Steve) packed up his shit and booked it out of the hospital. Now he was home, back in his tower with his baby, his mate and his family around him. Pepper finally came and visit after weeks of overseas travel to SI subsidiaries. As predicted, she fell immediately in love with her new nephew. Ulysses was awake when she visited and she cooed endlessly at his gummy smile, his blue eyes, even the spit bubble he blew in her face.
“The victim was killed with a gunshot wound to the chest. Guns are loud and yet you didn’t hear it,” Sharon wisely chose to ignore Tony’s jab, choosing instead to question one of her suspects, “Either you weren’t where you said you were, or you were lying. So we can talk about this now and maybe it doesn’t go further, or I will pursue this line of questioning and it might be in a less than subtle manner than you’d like.”
“I did, Tony, okay? I gave them our calculations. They know better than the doctors at Walter Reed. Besides you’re in no condition to be walking.”
“Is that why you refuse to have a hair cut? So you can grow your hair out like Blossom?” Tony placed a plate of waffles in front of him, already cut up in bite size squares.
“Okay, what the hell is going on, Steve? You’ve been acting like a dick the whole time we’re here. Are you a skrull?” Clint demanded, his annoyance warranted as he and the rest of the pack were being locked in a church basement, because they had just been kidnapped for the most intense bible study session ever. Steve was looking at all of them with anger and annoyance on his face, his lips pursed and twisted like a petulant child and buff arms crossed in front of his chest.
Yeah okay, he didn’t handle it well at all. Hopefully he got lucky and Jamie decided not to do or say anything to him tomorrow at school.
“Please,” Tony scoffed, “no son of mine would ever be named Howard. One Howard Stark in the history of the world is more than enough. And now you made me say his name in our bed, ugh, Steve...”
Steve got home from the mission late that night. After briefing Maria at the upstate New York facility that Tony revamped for the Avengers’ new headquarters, he finally managed to get home. He sent Natasha and Sam back earlier, they needed the rest more than he did even despite Natasha’s protestations. Besides, as team leader it was his duty to brief Maria and gave the report. That was hours ago, and now all he wanted to do was go home to the Tower and cuddled up with Tony and Ulysses.
