Tony looks at Nat’s Widow Bite and sighs. He’s avoided this long enough. Also, it’s
to a word I say?
It takes him a minute to register, but when he does he can feel his eyes tearing up in pure joy: he recognizes the sweet, deep, beautiful voice of Miss Ella Fitzgerald echoing softly through the room, telling him to
Steve is trying to decide - or rather, overthink, as he usually does - whether or not to say those last words aloud, but Tony’s so close, and his breath is so warm and damp and it’s such a contrast against the icy wind around them. Steve knows he should move, he should pull Tony away. The smell of scotch is a constant reminder that the man in front of him is not in his right mind at the moment, but his lips are slowly parting on their own accord, unwilling to stop what’s going to happen.
“I won’t if you don’t want me to,” she approaches him and places a hand on his shoulder, “but ignoring the possibility that this was just Tony trying to substitute something he thinks he can’t have, doesn’t make it any less likely.”
A woman makes her way towards them. Steve backs away a little to politely make space for her to join them, as Tony awkwardly smiles, stalling while trying to remember her name but failing miserably. He settles for the ultimate life-savior: “Hey,
Tony finally turns around, his eyes gleaming in the dark, ferocious, and he howls. “Don’t give me that
. “When you and Sam barged in, they set off a bomb to give them enough time to make an escape. You were too close. Steve shielded you from the blast...”
“He’s not here.”
“Beg me. Beg me to fuck you.”
“So...” Sam whispers, “did you and Steve get a chance to talk?”
The mercenaries go in leaving two man standing guard outside.

Why?! Why did he have to have a stupid school-girl crush on Steve “I’m practically perfect in every way” Rogers? He was a grown ass man for Christ’s sake!
said. Luckily, he managed to pry it out of Tony before admitting to anything and immediately felt relieved. A drug-induced love confession wasn’t what he’d had in mind.
“Hey, you aren’t the only lady killer in the room,” says Bucky. “Back in the day I could woo the pan-”
“We’re a private facility that handles super-secret projects for the government. So, no. You’d just disappear,” says Tony.
The young tech laid against the console as the throbbing in his head grew more and more pronounced. With each pulse it felt like a bat to the head. Or a Russian bitch punching him in the face. He pushes his roller chair away from the computer and across the room to his bag. He rummages around until he finds his bottle of pain meds. The bottle keeps slipping from his hands as he struggles to twist off the child proof cap with two of his fingers in a splint. Just as he starts to make head way on the lid the metal door swings open and clangs against the stone causing him to jump. The motion sends the bottle flying.
Count Nefaria opens his mouth to retort before a boom echoes down the hall. They see a squad of armed guards run past the door seconds later towards the sound.
“Proceed away,” says Tony.
“Wait! I don’t think this is a good idea.”
“It’ll probably involve blowing up shit and shooting bad guys,” Clint says in a sing-song voice. “Some of which may be some form of Nazis.”
“This is Happy. He’s head of security,” Steve says.
“Like you’re one to talk.”
“Everything ok?” she asks.
“Not really…”
Tony glances at Mari. “Do the kids these days still like pizza?”
They resume their trek to the elevator. When they come up to the door Tony taps a code into a keypad next to it. The doors open and they step in.
Steve coughs. “Yeah we need to talk about that later…”
“Captain, you wished me to alert you when Miss Mari left her bed.” Jarvis interrupts.
“Daddy?”
“Yay.” She lays them on her bed and rushes in the direction of her closet. She stops short and freezes.
“Her exact words were ‘get your lazy butt down here before I come up there and drag you away by your self indulgent Hawkeye underwear’.”
Mari has a large, proud smile on her face when she turns to Steve. “I made them stop.”
She takes the bear back to hold it up to her ear. She nods as if she is listening to what the bear has to say. After a moment she gives a final nod. “Apology accepted.” In a blink her whole demeanor changes. She relaxes and smiles at him before climbing into his lap.
“So you’re the new Stark.”
He smirks and closes his eyes, giving her a little wave. “I feel your pain I really do.” He yawns and chuckles as he hears her mournful groan disappear down the hall.
Bucky is about to give her an amused reply when he hears the door open and Tony says, “Mari, what are you doing up? It’s way past your bedtime. I already let you stay up as it is.”
“Steve?”
This would have been up sooner but you can thank a certain AKACHAN FOR DISTRACTING ME. Anyway, enjoy the fluff.
“What kind of communication issues?” he asks, coming to look at the screens.
“I’m old and need to rest these creaky joints. Papa will push you though.”
“If we didn’t trust you, we wouldn’t have invited you. Besides, even if you did Hulk out, there is a whole floor of heroes up there, including Thor, which you would have to get through first. I’m not asking you to go up there and bounce her on your knee like Santa. Just say hi. Eat some cake. Have some punch. Make sure Clint doesn’t do anything else that’s stupid tonight.”
Steve glances up at being snapped out of his bubble. His smile grows slow and wide. He returns the pressure against his side and leans back into the arm around his shoulders. He nods to Mari across the playground. “Mine’s the fluffy one doing the field study of the frog over there.”
“That’s your own fault. If you hadn’t made so many Capsicle jokes she wouldn’t have come up with Popsicle.”
“That’s not what I mean. Give me back my phone.”
“We just haven’t talked about it.” Mari tugs at her hair and looks at her scuffed sneakers.
The doctor frowns at Tony a second more before plastering his sickening smile back on. He turns to Mari and holds out a brightly colored toy mushroom. “Marianna why don’t you explain the rules for when we’re in our trust circle.”
“Oh wait.” Tony says before he runs from the room then comes back thirty seconds later with her stuffed dragon. He tucks it in beside her.
Tony and Steve whip their heads back to her. Tony asks, “How are you holding up Kiddo?”
“She barely broke the skin. Maybe next time he wants to hurt other kids he’ll remember he’s not the only one that can throw a punch.”
Mari head flies up to glare at her. She snaps, “No! I just got tired trying to get people to believe me!”
Mari pouts and blows raspberries at her.
Steve quirks an eyebrow at him. “The Lieutenant?”
“Really? Do anything fun there?”
Tony arches an eyebrow and looks to the assassin. With a smirk he asks, “How do I get in on some of that action?”
“Mr. Stark! Ms. Potts is in the middle of a conference call! Wait outside!”
“A friend that has tried to kill you! On multiple occasions!”
The ring leader smirks and stands up. Mari has to crane her neck back to glare up at him. “What if we don’t wanna? Four eyes.” He flicks Mari’s glasses off her face.
“But it’s still out there! And I told!” She starts to bounce up and down.
“Clear.” Hawkeye says.
Tony is silent for a moment before he turns a glare onto Steve.
“Not friends?”
“It’s okay kiddo. Daddy and I will be just out there.” He points out to the balcony. “It’s just a little talk. Promise.” Steve kisses her head before heading towards the door.
“Woo! That was close!” she says, trying to catch her breath. After her chest slowly stops heaving she turns to eye the well-dressed man up and down. “You’re Tony Stark, aren’t you?”
“I asked her that. She said and I quote, ‘We have the technology’.”
“Ewwww.” She wipes at her face with her shirt.
“Smooth,” says Rhodey. “Real smooth. Hashtag it’s actually kind of lame.”
Tony takes a sip to wet his dry mouth. “She’s actually why I’m here.”
“You get shot and you’re worried about-“
“Very well Sir. I won’t warn you that Mr. Odinson is about to show the young miss the ‘thrill of flight’ by tying her to Mjolnir and summoning it from across the room.”
“Stupid brat!?!
“Just got a text from him a few minutes before you came out. He got her to go down for twenty minutes. Then he took her to the park in hopes that some fresh air would do her some good.”
“How is that possible?”
He walks down the hall lined with offices before strolling into the one he is looking for.
“Once you are satisfied that she’s happy with us.”
Bucky was going to kill someone. He had been experiencing fragments of memories for the last two weeks that he couldn’t make heads or tails of. And each time one showed up, it tore through his head leaving a headache behind. The only thing he could work out was Natalia was somehow involved. Bucky would glance over at her, or she would make a simple gesture and the pain would spike and he’d see a ghost image of a memory. Why she kept setting it off? He had no idea. When were they from? Fuck if he knew. He knew he had met Natalia before. He had a vague recollection of shooting her to get to a target. And then of course that whole SHIELD/HYDRA SNAFU. But he had no idea where they would have met up before that. Or in between. What did he know? And it wasn’t like the gestures setting off the memories were aggressive. Nothing was ever set off when he watched her fight. Nothing when she was weapons training. It was just domestic shit. Her leaning against a railing, her jumping onto the couch and knocking shoulders with Clint, her reading the newspaper. The closest he got to a combat flashback with her was one time when he saw her cleaning her gun.
“Wait, ‘still’?”
When she looks back at him he says, “We’ll do it together.”
Mari and Steve turn to smile into the camera and Tony takes the shot.
Steve shifts the strap on his sling and then shuffles the papers into the folder in front of him. Steve, Thor, Janet, Sam and Clint are gathered in a SHIELD meeting room finishing their debriefing for the mission.
“You mean Pops and Daddy.”
Bruce hands Tony a couple pain pills and holds out a bottle of water. He frowns when Tony ignores it and swallows the pills dry. He takes off the top and shoves the bottle in his hand anyway.
It breaks Steve’s heart. They should have done this sooner. Much sooner. He had thought she was doing well with them but by the looks of it, she hadn’t been as well as he thought. A fact that he thought was being addressed in her therapy sessions. That was next on his list.
Tony looks over his shoulder. Mari is sitting on the bed in the clothes she had picked out. They stare at each other, waiting. He turns his whole body towards her and tries to read her eyes for what she may want. She looks down at her feet and wiggles them at him. That is when he sees her laces are untied. He smiles.
“It also enhances the dreams.” Bruce brings up a study the Count did. “Makes them more real. Therefore the body’s reaction is more visceral.”
He smiled up at her and his trembling subsided as he saw her wide grin. “And then we met you.”
That’s when the bottom lip pops out in a pout again and he has to hold down on a chuckle when she glares up at him. “I’m smart. Explain it. I’ll understand.”
Mari stiffens and looks between the two. “Party? What party?”
“You should have seen all the onesies I had picked out.” Tony chases his lips and coaxes Steve’s lips apart with a slide of his tongue along the seam. Steve groans and lets Tony’s tongue slide alongside his own. Tony pulls Steve close and rubs at the stiff nipple pressing against the fabric of the thin t-shirt Steve has on.
“What about you Kiddo?” asks Tony. “You okay with going to another doctor?”
Tony jerks upright and looks at him with a confused look. “Her mother?”
“And as emotionally constipated,” Sam calls from the couch.
After a minute she slowly crawls out and Steve lifts her up onto the bed. He pulls the covers up and tucks them in around her.
“Because they wouldn’t let us.” Ben sits forward. “They were always moving her around, changing her social worker. By the time we received any information, if we received it at all, it was already out of date.”
Mari’s eyes widen and she throws the toy back at the therapist. She shakes her head and makes a small whining noise.
By the time they have the kitchen and dishes clean, the pizza shows up. They put on Alice in Wonderland as they eat the pizza. When it is time for another round of Mari’s dialysis they watch Tarzan before turning in for the night. The next morning, when Steve comes in to check on her after his jog, he finds her under the bed again. He pries her out from underneath it and massages the soreness out of the muscles in her neck. They have a quiet breakfast where the biggest thing that happens is Tony accidently pouring coffee into Mari’s orange juice and taking a mouthful. Steve laughed so hard at Tony’s disgusted and gagging face that orange juice came out of his nose. Later in the day Tony showed Mari his suits and how they worked. They ate leftover pizza for lunch and made mac n’ cheese for dinner. After a dialysis session they put Mari to bed. A few hours later, when Tony climbs into bed he finds Steve laying wide awake and staring at the ceiling.
Tony winks. “You just earned yourself an enthusiastic blowjob Big Boy.”
“Only when we try to cook anything more complicated than scrambled eggs, hamburgers, or steak. I know just enough not to starve to death and Tony…well he has a phone and enough money to hire a private chef.”
“Can I play?” she asks.
“I’m sorry, short stack.” He picks up a slice of french bread that has smoked salmon on it. He gives it a sniff and takes a bite. Not bad. He then ruffles her hair. “But don’t worry. You won’t be sick forever and when you get better you can have all the junk food you want.”
“Tony!” Steve pulls him back to look him square in the face and give a disapproving frown.
“Bruce, how long can someone go without sleep before…” Steve glances down at Mari’s face. “You know.”
Tony turns to Bucky. “We thought?”
“Pepper and Rhodey will be here at ten. Just like I told you five minutes ago.” Steve answers not looking up.
“I sure as heck didn’t think you would either.” Steve bends the rifle over his knee still in the bag. Then he hooks it onto his hover bike. “Are you with Hydra again? Did they get to you?”
Steve sighs. “Any questions relating to the Avengers and their duties?”
“Pepper your tablet please.” Tony holds out his hand and Pepper hands over the device.
Steve smiles as he watches her set the cup down and runs to Clint’s side. Tony jumps off the stool when she trips over her feet getting there. She pops back up off the floor and says something to Clint that has her mouth moving a mile a minute as she pushes her glasses back up her face. Steve relaxes when she shows no signs of being harmed. His eyes trail down Tony’s arm to the tight grip on the counter’s edge. He looks at his face and sees the faintest sign of panic in his husband’s eye.
“Anyone ever tell you you’re a pretty good lay?” Tony mumbles as he cards his fingers through blonde locks.
“I am afraid I cannot access that information sir. Something seems to be locking up all systems related to the tower.”
“Why don’t you show them your bathroom too so you can wash your hands before dinner,” Tony calls after her and tries to stifle a yawn. When Steve steps up next to him, Tony smirks at him. “So how does it feel to get a taste of your own medicine, ‘son’?”
“Sounds yummy.” Bucky takes a cube and pops one in his mouth. He fights against the urge to grimace.
“Yes. We’ve talked about this a lot and we want a boy,” says Steve.
“Wow, Steve. Glad to hear how petty you think I am.” Tony shoves past him and into the bedroom. He tugs off his under shirt with an angry jerk.
She yelps and almost slips off her chair trying to get away. “COLD! SO COLD! Saaam! Why?”
“What am I supposed to do? Teach her to do nothing?”
“Not entirely sure. Oscorp is pretty good at not airing ALL it’s dirty laundry besides, the good doctor wasn’t on our radar until his profile disappeared from our database. Repeatedly.”
“I know. But things always seem a little less scary when you have someone at your back.”
In an undisclosed location…
“Awwww. Oh by the way, your hobo friend is coming back up behind you.”
“Please?” she asks.
Steve turns his face into Tony’s neck to stifle his chuckle. “Not a single follicle.”
“I suppose that’s Pops’ problem,” Tony says in a dry voice and shoots a glare at Steve over his shoulder. “See you at breakfast grease lightning.” Tony gives Bucky’s shoulder a light punch before walking down the hall.
“You want to go?”
“Rhodey never told you what happened to the fish he asked me to pet sit did he?”
“Well why don’t I wait outside the door?” Steve said as he followed Mari.
“Get it out of here! Now!” The Captain orders. He brings up the shield just in time to deflect a bullet.
“Where did you get this?” he asks.
“What about an Ironlass suit?” Tony shuts off the water and jumps when the shower door swings open.
Bucky sighs and leans forward, bracing his hands on his knees. He looks Mari dead in the eye and says, "I grew up with
Bruce watches Tony out of the corner of his eye and sees the man’s face crumble. His shoulders drop and he takes an aborted step forward. After the syringe is pulled out, Mari’s sobbing quiets and she slumps against Steve’s chest with drooping eyelids.
“Do you want me to take care of the Iron Legion?”
“Use this! Use this!” she shouts over the shrill beeping, waving a salt shaker at him.
“What if they don’t like me…” she mumbles pushing her plate away.
“Ok. Ok. Um…I found out where Mari learned to hack.”
“He hired Chameleon. He already had a way in,” says Sam.
“Scoot your caboose Bennie.” Mae bumps him with her hip until he moves over. She pats the cushion on her other side. “Well come on, you can’t see them from over there.”
“Biggest coop in Harlem.”
As Steve continues onto a lecture about being a team and how to be a gracious winner Bucky leans over and asks, “He do this often?”
“Yeah. Good thing we’re famous, otherwise that could have ended much worse.” Tony returns the aviators and picks out a pair of glasses with thick blue frames and puts them on Steve’s face. “You should wear these. They bring out your eyes.”
“Yeah, sorry about that.”
“Then they’d buy some bug spray!” He jerks out of Nefaria’s hold and glares him. “Don’t get your cape in a twist! I reset the connection and I’m waiting for it to reconnect. Should be up in a while. With all your money you could have thrown a few extra bucks at your internet provider you know.” He walks over to the bottle and returns to prying the lid off. “How do you even know it’s offline? I thought I told you to stop hovering.”
“I’ll keep that in mind incase Count Nefaria’s dastardly plan doesn’t take care of her.”
“Still think there’s a monster your closet?”
“Yeah. A lot of people lost money on that one.”
“How was group?” Steve asks.
“I-I’m sorry.” He tries to sit up but his limbs feel disconnected from his brain. “Did I- Did I-“
“No, Barton and his viral plague carrying ass is the reason she got sick.” Tony sighs. “You think I could convince Steve to let me turn the entrance hall into a decontamination chamber?”
“She’s a little clingy,” he explains before trying to pry her off. “Kiddo we’re here because Aaron asked me to help him move some things. So while we’re upstairs I’m going to need you to kick back down here and be good okay?”
“We got her turned back! Eventually…”
“And which do you think he would rather be doing right now? Spending the rest of his vacation with you two or Clint and Thor in the quinjet the day after they had a food feast of chilies?”
“Good. Let’s round these-“ The Captain sways on his feet.
He watches as she seems to try and decide whether to go over and do something or go back to her games. Steve’s influence seems to win because she straightens her back and marches over towards the three bullies. The three bullies twice her size. And judging by the bruise forming on the little boy’s cheek, ones with an obvious mean streak.
“Technically Barnes did. But it still doesn’t really answer as to who. He’s a mercenary so anyone could have hired him,” says Tony.
Bucky knocks back. “Punk.”
“That’s right. I do. But I use it for other things too.”
“So I guess I’ll be doing the heavy lifting like usual hm?” Tony lifts his hips up and pushes back down in a swift slide. “Oh yeah, that’s where it’s at.”
“Sure. After we get you settled though,” says Tony.
“Is this a negotiation?”
“Marianna!”
“There’s a death ray?”
“You still need to tell me stuff like this. I’m your husband, her father, I need to know these things Tony.”
He gets a better grip on her hand and with that he curls his arm up, lifting her in the air. Mari squeals and her other hand latches onto his grip before she starts swinging her legs forward. He lowers her back until her knees bend. Then when she pushes off he lifts her high back into the air. He swings her up and down as the brownstone he was taking her to comes into sight. They come up to the stairs and he lifts her up over his head before lowering her to the height of the top step. She lets out a giggle as she kicks her legs forward. She stretches out a leg trying to catch the edge of the top stair with her toe. He leans a little forward until she catches and gets a steady footing. As he ascends the steps he keeps a grip of her hands until she’s upright. He knocks on the door and Mari continues to hang from his grip, using her feet as a pivot.
“She has an eidetic memory. Your statement will still be intact in a couple hours.” With that he nods for the medic to walk ahead and follows after.
Tony’s tense shoulders relax and he rubs her back. “I’ll buy you a new one kiddo.”
“Oh that fills me with so much confidence.” He turns away and goes to his dresser to dig through a drawer. “Don’t know if you remember this but last time you met he shot you.” He jerks out a pair of sweats. “Three times. In the gut. Then he beat the shit out of you.” He shoves his pants down and jerks his legs into the cotton sweats.
The two assassins circle each other around the ring. In a flash, Natasha darts forward. Bucky reaches out only for her to drop down. She slides against the canvas and uses his leg to spin around and kick into the back of his opposite knee. As that leg buckled he rolled into it and away from her next punch. A flash of pain rips through his head and makes him cringe. He just barely has time to catch her next kick. He stands and pulls her towards him so he can lock her arms against her sides. The minute she crashes against his chest though, there’s another flash. The world around him changes to an old home with snow outside the window. He’s snapped back to reality when she slams the heel of her palm into his chin. He swipes out an arm to punch her side but she dances out of reach. He goes to grab at her again and another flash. It was the same home and there was a young redhead in front of him. He reached out to her only for her to slip out of his grasp and laugh. A punch to his solar plexus and he’s back in the ring. He’s able to block her next few hits. All of her punches and kicks are aimed at his right side. She always keeps out of reach of his metal arm. He catches a spinning kick and gets a flash of the red head doing a pirouette in a tiny living room. The furniture pushed out. This time her face is a little clearer. He can make out vague features and piercing dark eyes. He blinks to bring himself back to the present.
“Hey Kiddo!” Steve pulls her into a tight hug. He winces when she puts pressure on his shoulder.
“Come on. This is a great opportunity to help you-”
“I spy with my little eye a grey octahedron,” Mari says playing with Steve’s hair.
“Oh nonsense. You two would have ended up together once you stopped dancing around each other. Now Mari why don’t you come sit and listen to an old woman ramble about the good old days while the boys clear out my attic. I bet you’ve never had a genuine tea party.”
Tony keeps an eye on him for a moment longer before turning back just in time to see Mari sneak another strawberry.
“I will beat you in front of these children. Just try me Barnes.”
Instead of the AI’s voice, he is answered with a garbled, distorted mess. Tony and Pepper share a confused look as he pulls out his phone and brings up Jarvis’ satellite uplink.
Mari nods before laying down on the couch.
She slides the laundry hamper in front of the closet and runs out of the room singing the meow mix theme song. “MEOW MEOW MEOWMEOW!”
“…ok so I shouldn’t be around kids. Sue me!” Clint goes back to his plate and Steve removes his hand from Mari’s eyes.
“Mr. Stark.”
“No. Her mother taught her.”
That seemed to jolt Steve out of his trance because he snaps his mouth shut and turns to Tony. “Were you aware that the team is betting on when our daughter will hit various developmental stages?”
“Huh. Slide that over here when you’re done.” Bucky pulls out a bowl and sits next to him.
He clears his throat and shakes his head.
Steve stops and looks at Natasha. “You’re joking right?”
“We’ve got a possible location. We’re going after them,” Nat calls behind her.
He hears heavy footsteps approaching him and then he is being gripped by his chest plate and dragged across the uneven terrain. He grunts when he is dumped on the ground. There is a crunching sound and five points of light pierce through the darkness over his face. With the sound of metal tearing he blinks against the flood of light. As the world comes into focus around him he realizes he is indeed in his suit and the face plate has been ripped off. The sound of shuffling feet draws his attention above him. A hulking figure with wide shoulders is looming over him. At first he thinks it is Steve but his husband’s hair was blonde and this man’s hair was dark and long and shaggy. Then he sees the face, or some of it. The man is wearing dark circle googles and over the lower half of his face and part of his neck is a black mask. Tony gulps and glances around him to try and figure out where he is. That was when he sees he is not alone on the ground. Steve is lying next to him, eyes unseeing and a hole in his forehead.
Steve rips open the package of bacon and throws the strips into the pan with a loud sizzle. Sam hands him another pack that he rips open to add to the pan. While they sizzle away he takes the bowl of egg mixture Sam hands him to pour in a separate pan and scramble.
“And they weren’t…because they couldn’t afford it…It was ruled as neglect…” He starts gathering the papers back into the folder.
“Um...thanks?” He takes the paper.
She clambers down from Bucky’s lap before running to wrap her arms around Tony’s leg. “But I was scared.”
Mari stops squealing and Tony looks back at the therapist to see him frowning. He lowers himself back down and folds his hands. “Continue.”
“You’re still here, aren’t you Peterdottir. Come out, come out where ever you are.” It punctuates its sentence by throwing the dresser across the room.
“You mean for making me think I was about to get lucky for the first time in a week or for suggesting we give up custody.”
Tony sighs and rubs at his temples.
“Who is coming?” Mari asks.
“I’d rather not go to one at all…” she says as she moves eggs around on her plate.
"No."
“She’s from New York Steve,” Bucky snipes. “Not Cali.”
He hears a sigh of relief before the plant moves again and a young girl climbs out of the pot and onto the bench next to him.
Just as the social worker and the little girl disappear around the corner Steve pops his head out of the nursery.
“It’s your shield. You beat up bad guys with it.”
He watches the fear on her face turn to hesitant resignation. As the stairs tip Mari launches herself forward and leaps across the drop. He reaches forward as far as he can and still keep his footing. She goes flying and as she starts to fall short, he gets a grip on her arm and pulls her to his chest. As he falls against the wall, the stairs on the other side fall away and down the eighty story drop. He slides down to the ground, letting out a long exhale. Mari sobs into his shoulder, shaking.
“I’m not making this about you! This is about us!” Steve realizes he’s yelling by the end but he can’t find it in him to care.
“Because I won the bet! I shouldn’t need a reason.”
“Yeah. Looks like it belongs to a lacewing or something. Here’s half of the other one I think.” Bruce slides a broken wing next to its counterpart. They were about an inch long and near translucent. Then he slides the remnants of some sort of processing chip over. “Do you know what it is?”
“Maybe you’d have less paper work if you stopped using top secret new tech as target practice.” Bruce arches an eyebrow at him.
Silence follows but Natasha continues to stare at him with a smirk. Tony tries to ignore her but starts fidgeting after a few moments. “You know I can get you an autographed picture if you want. It’ll last longer. Unfortunately it doesn’t get my hot smolder across as well.”
Steve looks at the list and frowns. “But normal people have more than just the basics.”
“No, what are you’re good points?”
“Jarvis let me in! I have more Wake Up Juice for Daddy!” they hear a muffled voice say.
“I should be but the system is so bogged down I can barely do anything. I need something with more power.” Tony stands. “We’re going to have to cut this short fellas. Good work, we’ll call you.” He strides to the door and out into the hall. He hears Pepper say something to the scientists before rushing after him.
“And she’s never said a word about this?” asks Sam.
“She taught you how to punch too right? That’s what it says at the museum.”
Steve slides his hands down Tony’s body to grip the meat of his ass. Then with a swift jerk he lifts him up so the inventor’s legs are forced to wrap around him. “Oh? That’s a first. I think becoming a Daddy is a good influence on you.” He walks them towards the bed.
“How’s your shoulder?” Tony asks close to Steve’s ear. He kisses Steve’s pulse.
She pouts. “I wanted to land in the sand.”
“Tony,” Pepper says. “I can handle things here and Steve can look after Mari while you get checked out.”
“Right.” Tony lowers himself down but is taken by surprise when he sinks right into the bag causing the foam pellets to make a large squeak and his knees to be shoved up against his chest.
“Since when is ‘I pulled a muscle’ the same as ‘I got fucking shot’?” Tony asks in a harsh whisper.
“She’s my little girl too and that wasn’t you Buck.”
“She’s doing well. She seems happy. Her condition hasn’t worsened but we’ve had to change to hemodialysis.”
Nowadays though, not all the chaos was unwanted.
“She’s not my wife,” Bucky grumbles.
“Oh! Um…” a voice yelps.
Nat ignores him and strolls up to the homeless man, pulling her leather jacket closer around her. She stops a few paces away and hunches in on herself. “Excuse me, my boyfriend works with one of the shipping companies here but I think I got a little turned around and well…can you point me in the direction of the incoming ships?”
Steve looks down and arches an eyebrow. “Mari?”
“No,” says Janet. “I can still get in contact with SHIELD and I even called Hank. Apparently everyone lost contact.”
All of a sudden, Steve hears music blare in the background and a voice yell, “GOTTA CATCH ‘E-“
“And which is your left?” Tony asks.
“No. It was funny.”
“I added sign language just for you buddy,” Tony says with a wide smile.
“Special guests I seem to be the only one concerned about.” Steve throws his arms up.
“She did?” Tony and Steve ask in unison.
“The one she was swatting at. Look, you need to keep a closer eye on your little family for the next few months. I caught wind of a hit put out on Stark’s kid.”
“No! I want to go home now!” Mari bursts into tears.
She leans in and says...something. It sounds like she is talking through water. He can’t hear what she is saying but there is a feeling niggling at the back of his head that he knows what the words are. He hears a deeper rumble answer back. She laughs and leans forward to kiss him. She pats his cheek with her left hand. He feels warm metal. As she gets up, he sees the glint of a ring. Just a simple silver band on her left hand.
“She’s certainly blind enough for them to work that way. Besides, she’s not using them right now.” He moves on to the chip. “No identifying marks that I can make out. Jarvis you got any observations?”
“HULK NO BREAK COUCH. JUST THOR’S FACE!”
“It’s just because Steve and Tony are so high profile. If anything goes wrong it’ll be all over the news so CPS is covering their butts.”
“Why don’t we go try these on?” Steve says as he turns. He stops and looks down when he feels her tug at the clothes he is holding.
Mari gasps in horror at the thermos holding the smoothie and grabs the apple juice.
“Where is he?”
” She gives him a firm, hard look that feels like a warning. “The guy
Steve tries, Tony struggles.
“There’s only one thing I want, Tony. And you’re gonna give it to me willingly.” ‘Steve’ pushes his finger in and Tony clenches his jaw shut. “Just like every night for the past few weeks. You’ve moaned while fucking me, telling me how tight I always am... telling me how much
Tony’s anger dies down a little, although there’s still a controlled, sad rage behind his eyes. He pushes Steve off with uncanny strength.
Punch
He turned around to find Natasha staring at him with a quirked eyebrow and a concerned look on her face.

what I mean’ look.
Steve looks at her, puzzled. “Wh- well, Tony wouldn’t have done what he did if he hadn’t been-”
“JARVIS, read vitals.”
“Okay, I may have asked Romanoff, who - unsurprisingly, may I add - had seen you take the fire escape stairs.” He throws his hands in the air as a sign of defeat. “But, in my defense, I came up with the fake explanation on my way up, so-“
Tony shivers. Not so much at the touch of Steve’s hand against the warm, pulsing skin of his cock but at the unfamiliar grin plastered across the blond’s face. There’s something about that grin... teeth showing, eyes dark and narrowed. There’s something exciting but at the same time unsettling about it. Tony can’t quite figure out what it is yet.
Both his and Tony’s StarkPhone ring at the same time. They know what that sound means.
. Please don’t call me Captain America, not... not when it’s just us.”
He resumes his work on Natasha’s weapon, stealing wary looks at the phone every couple of seconds, the frown on his face growing deep with concern.
But moments
She smirks proudly, closing her eyes and humming in agreement. Steve paces the room, trying to clear his head and
So he’s just standing in his - eighth? - corner of the night, hoping the event will be over soon because frankly, he doesn’t know how much longer he’ll be able to keep this up, when he spots him from across the room.
is taking a toll on the man you claim to love.”
“Tony.” There’s that look he hates. That big brother look, that ‘I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on and let me help you’ look. “Why are you acting like this? What’s happening?” His gaze quickly flashes towards his chest. “Are you-"
He walks the red carpet like he always does. Tony’s a socialite, he’s been doing this for ages, so it’s easy for him to just hide behind the clown make up and put on a good show. He turns slightly to Rhodey.
He looks at Sam, blinking in confusion that quickly makes way for a blood-freezing terror expression as his friend’s eyebrows go up and tilts his head forward. It’s a ‘you
He practically shoves Tony into the wall to free himself from the grasp, but instead of being intimidated by this, the smaller man clenches his jaw and pulls his chin up in defiance, staring right into Steve’s eyes with utter

, what if he just wants… well, you know."
Steve’s mouth opens slightly at the realization.
“You’re not a… that’s not what I-”
“Maybe he does. Maybe he doesn’t.” Then he leans forward to lock gazes with Steve. “There’s only one way to find out, though.”
“He won’t believe me. You should have seen his face--”
“Hmm-” Rhodes looks up at the ceiling, pretending to ponder that over. “Not really.”

. But every time he picked up the phone, something had stopped him. It felt intrusive somehow. Yes, they were closer now than they had been before - not that that was a big accomplishment considering where their relationship had started - but that didn’t seem like a good enough reason to just call him out of the blue to ask if something was going on. So he would put the phone down, clenching his fists, resisting his urge to check up on him. Until the perfect excuse had presented itself: Fury had called an Avengers meeting, something about debriefing them on new intel they had acquired on an important arms dealing organization they’d been tracking for a while now. It was short notice, so they’d figured they would just video call Tony.
“It’s relaxing.”
“How did he call it?” Tony narrows his eyes, trying to recall the conversation. “Oh yeah, a

“I asked if you had a good night sleep but given the fact that you’ve just literally spaced out for a minute and a half, I’d go with a wild guess here and say ‘no’.”
Comments are immensely appreciated. Thank you, xx
“Yes, you are!” She looks astonished, like she can’t believe Steve doesn’t get it. “All that strategic military thinking and you can’t see the obvious, vicious pattern you’ve both fallen into lately? You get close but not close enough, he tries to compensate with someone else because he thinks he can’t have you, you get mad about it, you fight.
“No, you’re the most stubborn of them all!” Steve quips, effortlessly holding the piece of metal. Tony is inches away from him and his eyes immediately follow the motion of Steve’s biceps as they flex.
Tony’s lips come in contact with his own, parted ever so slightly, letting both their breaths mix between their mouths and then Tony closes them over Steve’s lower lip, barely applying any pressure at all. As he pulls away, their lips come apart making a soft, wet, almost popping sound that travels like a warm stream through Steve’s body and pools at his lower belly, sending a jolt to his groin. The sound of their rapid, shallow breaths is deafening in Steve’s ears and it only adds to his arousal. It’s like he’s
that.” Natasha steps into the room and looks down at the mess, a sarcastic smirk on her face. Steve is careful to avoid her gaze while he grabs another bag from the floor so she takes that as permission to go on. “Are you gonna keep punching the shit out of those, or would you rather talk about it?”
For a split second, Tony can’t process. He can’t. He doesn’t
‘It’s Always You’ starts playing very softly. Steve really likes this one, Tony knows - and he
“Please, Steve... Fuck me, Steve,
he’s done that without giving too much away.
“Oh, I’m a changed man, Tony. I realize now how much I’ve been missing being so... uptight and righteous all the time.” He grabs him by both sides, sneaking his hands under Tony’s suit jacket, and forces his body flat against Tony’s. He hears his own surprised gasp when Steve’s cock rubs against his through the fabric of their suits. “Wanna have some fun, sweetheart? Looks like you do.”
“Stop overthinking, I can hear the gears in your brain turning.” Nat commands him softly from the couch, eyes still closed.
The blond smirks in amusement, lazily stroking Tony’s cock and palming his tight balls, tugging and rolling them in his other hand.
“What do you want from me?!” The gritty shout comes off muffled against the collar of Steve’s jacket, where Tony’s head is buried, and he can’t take it anymore.
“Call him.”
how hard this was going to be for him, and he
Steve winces at the words as if Nat had just stabbed him in the gut. “I don’t- I’m not pushing him away...”
A hand flies to his mouth to muffle him. From the corner of the eye, he can see the man above him leaning down to whisper on his ear.
, take it.” And then Tony lets go of his jacket and, to Steve’s complete
“Stop me, Steve.
, am I?”
Steve and Tony try to cool down after their fight.
His expression and tone of voice brings back memories from the battle at the HYDRA facility and Tony’s first reaction is to try to get up again. Rhodey quickly gets to his side, though, and presses a gentle but firm hand on his shoulder to keep him down.
you want to talk?” He shouldn’t be pushing this. He really shouldn’t.
“‘Cause I’m polite like that?” He smiles and lifts a cocky eyebrow.
“You’ve always been more than good enough, Tony.”
“You had no idea what I was talking about, did you?”
Tony’s bitter laughter is like a punch in the face.
Steve’s anger washes away all the sudden, his heartbeat going a thousand miles an hour. The air in the rooftop has stilled, he can’t hear the traffic anymore and he feels time has suddenly stopped. Tony’s just standing there, his back to him, unflinching, unmoving.
“I wanna see him.”
“I know, I know...” Sam nods and goes silent for a moment. “It’s just- he’s really having a hard time, you know?”
A pair of big, strong hands come up to his shoulders.
“Rogers? Rogers, what’s going on?” Nothing can be heard through the earpiece. “Natasha?!”
none of them are
, you pretentious douche,” he spits out, his voice full of anger. “And yeah, I guess I should have known you were cool with it since you were so nice about it the other day-”
He feels his abused asscheeks being parted wide open and a warm, thick liquid running down his crack and over his hole. He’s spitting on him, Tony realizes in disgust.
. That does wonders to calm Steve’s nerves. He sighs as he tugs on the hem of the jacket, straightening it out. He can do this. For Tony.
And so Tony does. By the time he’s in his boxers, he really does feel exposed. He looks at Steve, although he can’t really see the expression on his face, and grabs the waistband. He can feel the other’s piercing glare on him as he steps off of his underwear and stands there. He hears the quick breathing coming from the armchair and after a while, he begins to feel kind of uncomfortable, so he starts walking towards Steve.
A silent tear falls down as he slowly pulls back a little, bringing one hand to cup Tony’s bearded chin and tilt his face up. The damp, dark eyelashes framing a couple of unfocused chocolate brown eyes lift up as Tony looks at him silently.
Sam hums in consideration.
“He’s not just working, Sam. He’s actively avoiding me.” The blond closes his sketchbook and throws it along with the pencil on the bed, frustrated. He sits by the edge of the mattress, resting his elbows on his knees and running his hands through his hair. “How can I fix this if he doesn’t even get out of that goddamn lab?!”
The brunette doesn’t even turn around.
And Steve sighs. Deeply, like a child who’s just been held and told everything’s going to be okay. His shoulders relax, his muscles soften under Tony’s palm and the genius could have
Tony thinks, eyes wide as he looks at the phone in disbelief. The audacity!
“Hey, man. What’s up? I missed your cheeky comments on my morning run today.”
“Where is he?” Steve realizes his voice sounds slightly aggressive but he can’t bring himself to care about manners now.
Rhodey puts his hands up in the air as if to calm him down. “Ok, ok! So has he?”
Steve keeps rubbing circles on his wrist with his thumb and sending shivers down Tony’s spine. The honesty and the intensity behind his damp blue eyes is soul-crushing and he needs to look away, but Steve’s tongue travels between his lips as they part and his gaze lowers to Tony’s.
Tony didn’t know. He couldn’t think straight, too much information all the sudden.
He frowns when the blond lets go of his hand and leaves him in the middle of the room to sit in an armchair by the window. The lights are off so Tony can only make out the silhouette of the chair against the night city lights of New York.
There’s no way out of this. He’s hurting him and there’s no way out of this and he
“He left for Malibu.”
Tony nods and makes his way through the crowd. It takes him a good ten minutes to reach the other side of the room but he greets everyone politely and holds their hands, offering his best smile. That doesn’t mean that by the time he makes it to the bar he’s desperate for a glass of-

Tony had always had an irresistible charm and a witty sense of humor that had people wrapped around his finger in no time. This was no exception. He was pretty: blue eyes, strong features, broad shoulders and nice, toned muscles. Tony had to order more drinks every time what’s-his-face opened his mouth, though. Man, was he
“You’re right,” Steve whispers as he leans forward to rest his elbows on spread knees.
Tony opens his eyes and watches the naked body before him. He can’t help being slightly aroused at the sight. It’s Steve but it’s not
Steve knows Tony’s landed in the compound. JARVIS warns him, just as he explicitly asked the AI to do the minute Tony announced he was coming back.
He suddenly remembered the promise he made to Steve and smiles broadly. “Well, don’t you worry your pretty little head with that, I’ll m-”
He swallows thickly and his gaze falls to the ground. Tony finds himself rooted to the couch, eyes watery and fists clenched.
He sits back down on top of his legs and a shiver runs down Tony’s spine.
It had started innocently enough, he recalls, just some good old team bonding. But then Steve would ask Tony to this bakery in Brooklyn that had miraculously survived all these years, passing from generation to generation of owners. Then Tony would invite Steve to a baseball game - although he hated it, but it made Steve smile in a childish way that warmed his heart - and politely pretended to pay attention as the blond would talk about the Brooklyn Dodgers and how outraged he was when he found out they’d moved the team. Suddenly, they had inside jokes and shared complicit smiles across the table while the team had brunch on Sunday morning.
“Morning, Nat!” he walked past them and laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder and squeezed. “Tony.”
. Do you trust me?”
“Are you telling him to come talk to me, too? Because offering food and coffee doesn’t count as an apology for being a homophobic asshole last time I checked.” He grabs every mug, trying to decide which one to use, but
When the song changes again and Glenn Miller’s more upbeat
"You don't even like men..."
He sounds tired and sad, but Tony’s having none of that.
“You’re one to talk.”
Steve is deep in concentration hanging from the pull up bar, barely breaking a sweat, when he hears his voice.
Tony can’t stop himself from moaning. It’s Steve’s hands doing that to him.
. “I never liked bullies, Tony, and I sure as hell ain’t one of them.”
Steve lifts his gaze to the large windows of the compound and stares into the dark of the night. “I don’t even know where he is right now.”
She follows. “That’s because it’s true.” She puts the chairs she gathered on the rack as well. “It also helps if you have a good support system.”
Mari makes a small gasp. “I’ve always wanted to know, what are your wings made of? Is it some sort of micro-carbon fiber? Or titanium? And how is your suit powered? Do you use fuel or is it a self-sustaining energy source?”
http://mechinaries.tumblr.com/post/145527633299/sam-wont-share-the-cereal-so-bucky-drinks-all
Steve smirks before turning back to the tech who is watching him wearily. He thumps his hand on the machine. “Well go on. Tip tap. Hit a button or something.”
He nods and wipes at the sweat collected at his brow.
Her shoulders raised and fell with a sigh. Then she turned and joined him on the bed. She sat as far from him as possible. “We first met when I was still a trainee in the Red Room. You were on loan to teach us. Hone our skills. I was making the most progress so they had you focus on me. Had you train me hard until I was able to disarm you. Not long after that you got sent away. I progressed through the program. Got a few years of mission experience under my belt. Then you came back. They wanted us to do a mission together. It was a long haul. We had to live undercover as newlyweds in a small village. There was an asset we had to keep an eye on and eliminate if he strayed too far. Run interference on his missions. It lasted three years and ninety-six days. After a year you started to...I don’t know how to describe it. Thaw out? You started to develop a personality. You’d answer if I asked you questions that didn’t relate to the mission, you started reading the newspaper for more than just hidden messages. You even started to initiate conversations. I think that had been the longest you had ever gone without being wiped.”
“The nanny. Good day ma’am.” With that he turns and goes to scoop up Mari, only to find her gone. After a quick glance around, he sees she’s over by the original little boy. He has his toy back and they are talking. Bucky walks over and scoops her up. “Time to go squirt.” Bucky glances back behind him to see the woman jerking her phone out of her bag.
Steve opens his mouth to reply but is cut off by Callaghan’s return. “Sorry to interrupt but we need to put Mari under now. The sooner we replace that catheter the better. We’ll wrap her wrist as well.” She holds up a syringe of what Steve can only assume is anesthesia.
“You should really change your sync settings,” she says before going back to her work.
“I think I get it Kiddo.” He looks around and spots a disinfectant dispenser on the wall. He tosses the tissues in a waste bin and squirts some disinfectant on his hand. Ignoring the open elevator doors, he rubs the gel onto her hands, focusing on the one she had wiped her nose with.
Mari makes obnoxious snoring noises.
Fury coughs loudly and they turn to look at him. “As thrilling as it is to watch you two work through your sexual tension I do have an agency to run. Expect Agent Romanov to fill you in on the attack, she’s acting as liaison for the Avengers for this incident.” He turns and walks to the exit, his long leather coat billowing out behind him.
“Of course. We can’t wait to start a family,” says Steve as an excited smile stretches across his face.
Tony waits for Ben to move and after thirty seconds the man takes half a step back. Tony side steps in and walks in the direction Mae went. He steps into a small living room and stands awkwardly by an old overstuffed couch. He looks around and his eyes travel over the picture frames and small knick knacks. He sees one of a young couple holding a swath of cloth and steps closer. The man in the picture had wavey brown hair and thick glasses over brown eyes. He was standing next to a woman in a hospital bed with wild fluffy hair that was escaping the bun someone had tried to tie it back into. Her cheeks were pink and she had a pair of glasses over tired hazel eyes. Upon closer inspection he sees that the bundle of cloth was wrapped around a squishy pink face that resembled more of an angry jelly bean than a baby. He’d know that little scrunched up nose anywhere though. At first he thought he was mistaken because this baby had hair several shades darker than Mari’s and it had dark brown eyes. Tony knew Mari had blue grey eyes. But no, that little pout was one of a kind. He thought back to some of the baby books he had read when they were still thinking of adopting a baby boy and remembers that some said eye and hair color can change over time. Besides even though she was only five Mari was already starting to look like a mirror image of the woman in the picture.
“So imagine how much worse it would have been if you had hired anyone else.”
She looks at him confused. “But…you’re Captain America.”
The thrumming of motorcycles echo through the parking garage of Avengers Tower. Steve rounds the corner at a break neck speed and comes to a screeching stop in front of a waiting SHIELD agent. He gets off and nearly knocks a pale and slightly green Bruce off the back in his haste.
He decides to check in on her before he heads out. He cracks the door open wide enough to poke his head through and hopes he does not wake her. His heart drops to his stomach when he sees an empty bed.
“I think you mean physiotherapy and he’s a stuffed bear kiddo. After Uncle Bruce sewed him up, he was right as rain,” says Tony.
Steve kneels down and takes Mari by the shoulders. “It’s okay. It’s just another home check. We like Ms. Flander now right?”
A small smile sneaks onto his face as he glances at her from the corner of his eye. “Yeah well…I look good in anything. Especially the Mr. Mom look. It always gets the nannies swooning at the park.”
“No thanks. I’m a big girl.” She starts to flap her arms up and down and looks to Tony. “Which way? Which way? Which way?”
Bucky glances up at Nat. She just jerks her head to motion him in and goes back to the center of the ring. Bucky sighs and hands his jacket to Steve. As Bucky gets into the ring Steve says, “Be careful.”
Bruce sighs and glances down at Mari who is still fast asleep. He then takes her to Steve and Tony’s bedroom as instructed.
Tony frowns. Maggie. The woman that he could hardly find any information on. Tony was about to ask who she was when Mae came back with two thick scrap books.
She shakes her head and hugs her bear tighter.
“No, just his top scientists.” Tony leans back and gives him a tight smile.
“That’s why we have a balcony…” Tony grumbles.
She looks up at him hopeful. “I did?”
“As long as I can reach the keyboard I always have security clearance,” she replies in a petulant tone as it fades down the hall.
The guard ends up turning down a hall before he reaches them. The hipster leads Natasha into a large room with a huge super computer. He flips on the lights and sits in the roller chair in front of the machine.
“Yes.” She tilts her head and closes the folder. “Clint is showing me sign language. I’ve been learning Russian from Miss Nat.” She misses his flinch when she says Russian. “Would any of those help? I can do Icelandic but most people don’t know Icelandic, do you know Icelandic?”
“Well...I mean...it was mostly just me and Bucky.”
Steve, who’s backed up slightly and is looking at him with that annoying puppy eye look, holds up his hands.
“When I couldn’t find you anywhere I figured you wouldn’t have left, since that’s rude, so you might have gone for some air. You wouldn’t have used the front door since-” Tony hiccups and looks around, making an outraged face, like he doesn’t know where that awful noise has come from. “Since there’s plenty of press there. So… the roof.”
“Know what?”
“I mean it-” Steve's practically breathing over his lips at this point.

He feels every single ounce of dignity leaving his body and now there’s only pleasure. All he can think about is that huge cock breaching his hole, filling him up so much that there’s no space for thoughts of any kind. He moans loudly, throwing his head back on the pillow, mouth watering in pure pleasure. He’s chanting now, he can hear himself, far away.
Steve wants to laugh but he can only manage a lopsided smile.
Tony would have loved this with Steve. The
“This thing.” Steve has a worried look on his face, his eyes searching for Tony’s. “Where do you want me to put it?”
He’s not angry or hurt, he’s... playful. Tony furrows his brows. Steve’s been acting quite weird lately. He’d been sent on one of his SHIELD secret operations a couple of weeks ago and since then, Tony’d been noticing some subtle but certainly out of character reactions and comments that made something in the back of his mind itch uncomfortably, but he’d just dismiss his thoughts rapidly. His incessant paranoia was something he was fully aware of, so he tried to control it every time he felt it creeping up on him.
Tony, I made a fresh pot of coffee. Not sure if you have any left down there. Left you Fury’s files on those mercenaries we’ve been tracking. I hope everything’s ok. - Steve
. It’s not Steve because his cheeks aren’t covered in that adorable pink blush that always creeps up on him when he’s fully naked in front of Tony. It’s not Steve because his impossibly blue eyes aren’t full of love and adoration, but dark with lust and a menacing glint. It’s not Steve because there’s an evil grin where his sweet, shy smile usually is.
to stop what’s going to happen. Tony’s lips are so close Steve can feel their shape against his own even if they haven’t touched yet, a sort of warm weight on against the skin. Tony’s voice comes out harsh, in a whisper.
Darn it. Is he that obvious?
The lady quickly steps in and rudely grabs Tony by his forearm, dragging him away. Steve’s eyes follow the both of them as the woman loudly chatters Tony’s ear off and the brunette shoots him an apologetic look.
“Yes, I understand.” Tony whispers, eyes still closed.
that big blond oaf.
“Exactly,” Fury agrees, his eyes hard on Tony as a form of warning. “Captain, coordinate the team and ambush them. If we can take them in, maybe we can find out who they’re working for.”
Nat’s smug smile against her coffee mug as he ashamedly disappears into the elevator. Damn her and her silent but highly effective interrogation techniques.
trying!”. Well, he shouldn’t have been an asshole in the first place! That way he wouldn’t have anything to be sorry for, now, would he?
He’s not even looking at Tony, his gaze is sad and fixed on the floor between them. Tony thinks he’d rather have the punch than that, but instead of dialing things down, his smart-ass mouth moves faster than his brain.
He was Tony Stark, he always got his way.
“You have no idea.”
‘Steve’s hands leave him for an agonizing moment and he can’t suppress the disappointed groan. Tony can hear the sound of a lid snapping open but his head hardly registers anything other than the aching need in his groin. He sighs, relieved, when the hand wraps around him again, the hot feeling of the flesh against his length easing his mind. A finger slips into his tight hole and he gasps. He’s so ready, so ready for this.
“Yeah, sure. When hell freezes over, Rhodes.” Tony says angrily. “I will

The blond has his arm neatly folded for Natasha to hold and my
And that’s the last straw for Steve as he breaks down, silently crying, the tears finally running down his cheek. This doesn’t help Tony’s state, because he’s barely holding back his own. He glances at the bottle and his nose scrunches up, suddenly disgusted by the sight of it. He doesn’t know how to comfort him, what to say... because he knows well enough that nothing will ease up the burden of those memories. The only thing he can do is return the trust Steve has offered him.
it wasn’t him? What’s he going to think when he finds out you
Tony gasps, outraged at the blond, and narrows his eyes, a momentary distraction Steve takes advantage of to softly but firmly grab his arms and motion the piece towards his own chest.
“Ba- baby?” Tony tries to speak although he feels like all the blood in his body has gone to his aching groin.
Steve’s look is a mix between astonishment and outrage.
Also, bear in mind that the characterizations of Howard and Joseph are taken straight from the comic canon which do not match the MCU storyline.
“Hey, I’m gonna head to the bar, want something?” he says to Rhodey, turning around and forcing himself to tear his gaze away from the blond.
“I’m sorry,” the blond says. “Tony, you have to know-”
Steve purses his lips and furrows his brows sadly. “I’d be fine if you were around, though,” he says, half smiling and blushing a little, a hopeful expression on his face.
"It's called sex, Steve."
He brushed his teeth and threw cold water over his face, rudely ignoring his hard on and angrily wishing it away. He threw a clean black tank top and some sweatpants on and as he took the elevator heading for the common floor, he couldn’t help but reflect on last night’s dream.
“I have no problem with you being gay, Tony.”
Steve is painfully aware that if he acts hostile towards Tony, the other man is going to have absolutely no fucking clue as to what is going on, because the last time they saw each other they were having pot roast and sipping red wine by candlelight. It didn’t really make any sense for Steve to be suddenly pissed off at him, so he vowed to keep his cool.
Another cry escapes Tony as he feels a big hand land flat against the already aching skin of ass.
“Forget I said anything, really. It was- I’m sorry,” he quickly apologizes, turning the chair around, ready to resume his tinkering.
“On va voir.*”
compromised, Steve, so what are you truly afraid of?”
“Mm...” the taller man looks around, a little uncomfortable all the sudden. “It’s very impressive and-- uh, crowded.”
“I’ll tell you why you can’t think of any.” Nat cuts him off as she leans in, like she’s about to share a big secret. “Because there are
I’m not a dog you can summon, darling, so how about you get the fuck out?”
be bluffing, but then again, this is the man who blasted half of his Malibu mansion when he was being an ass on his birthday party due to the imminent threat of death by palladium poisoning...
Tony takes his hand off briefly to maneuver the wheelchair so he’s as close to the bed as he can be and resumes his position, hand lying softly over Steve’s arm. He drifts off as ‘Love Lies’ plays in the background.
He can’t see it, but he hears the smile on Steve.
The guy had quickly realized his mistake and walked away as Tony faced the screen again.
He’s almost too distracted, playing nice to some wealthy clown in an insanely expensive tux, and nearly misses the crowd going wild behind the glass doors. He eyes the entrance and spots his friends walking in. Sam and Clint look sharp in their suits, and then there’s-
“At Hydra we’ve successfully managed to not only recreate the serum... but the Captain himself. We made the switch in the last op he ran with his SHIELD team. Rumlow helped set it up.” He licks Tony’s earlobe and the engineer winces in disgust. “We have him now. I was to replace him and infiltrate the Avengers.” He sucks down on his pulse point and Tony has to bite his lips to prevent a whimper. “I must say it’s been
“Open wide, sweetheart, and suck it like you mean it.” The first thought in Tony’s mind is that he wants to bite it off and spit it out. ‘Steve’ must have seen it on his face because he adds “Oh, and I wouldn’t try any stunts if I were you. It might be the difference between life and death for your beloved golden boy.”
. Old Captain Dumbass
Tony is desperate. He needs to talk to him. He needs to apologize, to tell him- He doesn’t even know what he’s gonna tell him. He just knows he needs to be by his side and that’s when it hits him: this is the same feeling he got on the field that didn’t let him think straight. He takes a deep breath and leans back down on the bed, with a little help from Rhodey, who nods approvingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s already on his feet, his faceplate going down. Sam grabs his arm.
“Uh?”
. He smiles back and laughs sadly.
It's already on the tags and all but in this chapter, past episodes of domestic violence and alcohol abuse are mentioned and discussed so if this triggers you proceed with caution.
Tony turns in his chair, an astonished expression on his face, only to see Steve grinning wildly with his gaze glued to the sketchbook.
“Wilson, this is hardly the best timing for a heart-to-heart conversation.”
“He left for Malibu,” she repeats, confirming the fact. “And a few days later, we contact him and there’s a half-naked
Steve feels his heart skip a beat as he raises his head from his hands and freezes on the spot, locking a wary gaze with Sam. He must be talking about the whole homophobia thing, surely.
“I’m not ashamed, it just feels… pompous.”
‘Steve’ laughs out hard.
“A couple of days,” Rhodey says, dryly. He sounds both relieved and annoyed.
. He needs a plan, a strategy. He needs to calculate his options and the possible outcomes, consider how to best approach the situation…
Nat caught his gaze where it was fixed upon and smiled devilishly at Tony, mouthing a “oh” and winking at him.
“Fuck you, you
“I want you to love yourself, Tony...”
The concern in her expression only makes it worse.
"That's a very
When he wakes up, he’s in a bed at the compound. There’s an IV line attached to his left arm and every single muscle in his body aches. He tries to sit up and he groans as a blinding pain spreads through his chest side. He instinctively brings a hand up to were the arc reactor used to be.
Steve adds:
“Ugh. Ok, let’s get this over with.” He walks towards the super soldier, whose nose is wrinkled in disapproval. Disgust, probably. It hurts to see that look on his face, so Tony looks away. Swaying slightly from side to side, he finally stands in front of him and puts his hands up. “I won’t even fight back just-” he hiccups drunkenly, “just go for it. You want the jaw? Ribs are still not 100% there yet, I think...”
“He’s not here?”
“Come on, Tony.
He’s looking up at him, a terrible glint of victory in his piercing blue eyes. Fuck, he’s beautiful.
Tony had certainly not been expecting that.
“Next Saturday, I’ll take you somewhere nice,” Tony said, he wanted enough time to plan something special.
All those things bring Tony to where he currently is 6 months after they won.
“I’m an artist,” Steve said sheepishly.
“I was definitely correct in my previous statement,” Tony said after having taken a second to admire the art. “Steve, these  are fucking amazing.”
He felt bad for lying to Steve, but Tony had planned to surprise him by arriving earlier and taking him on a road trip for their anniversary and if he didn’t want Steve to suspect a thing he had to surprise him.
Entering his two bedroom apartment Tony went directly to his bedroom to pack a bag. He wasn’t planning on spending more than a night in Hinsdale so a fresh pair of clothes would do just fine.
After going through the living room and onto the second floor, Tony found himself in what was clearly Ana and Jarvis’ room. The walls were full of portraits of the two of them and some other people of which Tony could only recognize Clint, Nat and Bruce.
They said their goodbyes to Nat before starting their walk to Steve’s house. He had insisted that if Tony wanted to enjoy the town he had to do so by walking and not just go through it with a car.
“Well, I would like to try the Reuben sandwich,” Tony interrupted trying to cut the tension.
Inside, the walls were covered in paintings that Tony could probably guess were Steve’s.
It was actually a surprise to Steve that they hadn't asked before.
“Nothing,” Steve answered, avoiding his gaze. He clearly didn’t want to talk about it.
And with that Steve was left alone with Morgan once again until a pair of arms hugged him from behind.
The woman that had attended him, the same one who had called him yesterday to inform him about Jarvis, was very kind with him and made the process less tedious than what he had expected.
“What should we name him?” Steve said from behind the goat where he was checking that everything had gone well and both goats were fine. His shirt was covered in mud and what definitely appeared to be blood, Tony's clothes  on the other hand 𑁋thanks to some kind of miracle he suspected Steve had something to do with 𑁋  were pristine.
“Have you ordered yet?” Steve asked while grabbing the menu that sat in the middle of the table.
It suddenly hits Tony how young Steve really is and how much he has already lived while not enjoying the little wonders of life. It makes Tony want to give him the world and if he has been reading the past few months of night talks, soft smiles, and warm touches right, Steve might want the same thing.
“Hello,” he said once he entered the motel. Inside, the place appeared to be less rusty and more homey, with comfy looking couches at the entrance and a big painting in the middle right above where the counter was, behind which was a middle aged man with glasses and a soft look on his face. “Is there a room I can rent for the night?”
“Fan of KALEO?” Tony asks
Living at the Compound with everyone when before it was only him was a good change, suddenly the mornings stopped being cold and the nights lonely.
Worry started filling Tony’s mind, he had to do something with them, he couldn’t just leave them here all by themselves. Maybe some neighbor might be willing to take them in.
After finishing their meal Steve insisted on paying, claiming that he was the one that had invited Tony. Tony in retaliation left a tip large enough to cover for their orders.
It wouldn’t do him any harm to just check the damn thing, he thought .A few minutes wouldn’t make him miss his flight. Tony made his way to the red  barn, the door gave  a squeak as Tony pushed past it.
“Excuse me, Mr Stark. This is Lauren Watson working for the County Courthouse and I am calling to inform you of Edwin Jarvis’ unfortunate passing-”
"Thank you."
“Of course.”
Tony came back to himself with a shake of his head. “Yes, I am, sorry.”
The second half was the one he was most excited about, he couldn’t wait to tell Steve that he was officially going to move full time with him. He had been fixing everything for the past few months so that he could work fully from home and only have to fly to New York for trials.
“Of course, I’ll be there first thing tomorrow,” Tony said.
"No," Mary answered.
"You won't regret it!"
“Thank you,” Tony said before devouring the plate. He had been famished and just the smell of the blueberries on top were making his mouth water.
"What was that for?" Tony asked, smiling softly at him.
That seemed to do the trick and take Natasha’s focus off of glaring at Steve. Tony still wasn’t sure what that was about.
“I’m sorry, but part of Mr. Jarvis’ will cointans a clause where you are required to personally take over the properties,” Ms. Watson said, apologetically.
He wasn't expecting for the jolt of electricity that traveled through his hand once Steve had grabbed it, and if Tony wasn't reading wrong Steve felt it too from the way his head snapped up making him lock eyes with Tony.
plan, with everything he had lived and heard about the house from Steve,  there was no way Tony could sell or even worse, abandon the place Ana and Jarvis had loved so dearly.
As Tony went to bed on Friday he slept peacefully thinking that he had a good feeling about Steve.
Steve and Tony texted everyday for the whole week and Tony fell even more deeply in love with Steve if possible. They talked about everything and nothing and Tony had never been more impatient for the weekend to arrive.
"We want a puppy!" the three of them said simultaneously.
“I guess not,” Tony muttered to himself once they got the goat into a proper position.
While the talk he had yesterday with Nat and Clint had served him to lift his spirits about Jarvis passing, now he just felt sad again. He should have ignored his pride and at least called Jarvis, but now it was too late and he had only himself to blame for it.
And of course, out of the few people, FRIDAY allows inside without request, it has to be Steve. Sweet and kind Steve.
Of course Tony would let him be the bad cop and have the final say. But also, if Tony were the one having the final say the kids would probably be surrounded by mountains of things they wanted. That didn't mean he was a bad parent but sometimes he wanted to give them too much and Steve had to be there to stop him and remind him that their children loved him even when he had to set his foot down and say no to them.
She nodded and went back inside the kitchen. Tony took the opportunity to  look around at the people that were eating and talking amicably. It was a bit surreal how much people changed depending on where they were. It was hard to find a place in New York where people looked to be calmly enjoying their food and not rushing to get back to their work.
Another case won, Tony thought to himself as he descended the stairs of the court on his way to his car. He had been practicing for over 15 years and every time he won a case he still got the same giddy feeling of having accomplished his job. Not that going against someone like Justin Hammer was anything of a challenge.
At this, Clint appeared to be taken by surprise. “You don’t happen to be the Anthony Jarvis never stopped talking about, do you?” Clint said while leaning on the counter, clearly interested in the answer.
As if he had read Tony’s thoughts, Steve chose that moment to show up with his blond hair still wet (he had clearly taken a shower,which was totally normal and not something to fuss over), wearing a blue henley that did wonders to his eyes.
“Definitely have other things, if not I would have probably gone allergic to them by now.”
“I mean you could come to my place after we finish here,” Steve said so casually that Tony almost choked.
With that in mind Tony continued walking to the back of the barn.He wasn’t sure what he thought he might find, but what he hadn’t expected was to find a goat clearly in distress if the constant bleating was anything to go by. Tony definitely didn't know much about animals but upon closer inspection it looked like the goat was in the mist of giving birth and by the looks of it, she wasn't having a good time.
"Fine," Steve said, prompting the three children to jump in delight, making Morgan giggle around a mouthful of bananas.
“Please tell me if I’m reading this wrong,” Tony said in a whisper.
“Overruled,” answered the judge without missing a beat.
“I’m going to Hinsdale, I’ll try to be back before noon tomorrow.”
Tony woke up to the sound of the alarm on his phone. Last night he had set it for 7 am, right before he fell asleep, exhausted. The courthouse opened at 8 and he had wanted to be the first in line  to get everything done with as soon as possible. He still had a job in New York to go back to after all.
“Oh,” Tony said, he definitely hadn’t pegged Steve as the artist type.
“Enjoy your meal,” she said to both of them, dropping Steve’s plate with a loud clatter.
It was now obvious they had gone to him on purpose, he could admit he was the more easy-going parent. Steve would complain about him giving them too much leeway and spoiling them, but those were children and if he could he would give them the world.
“Pep, please tell me you have my coffee,” Tony was saying as he entered the car.
“Well, now I’m reassured,” Tony said dryly. He could admit that he was a city boy through and through but he wasn’t scared to get his hands dirty (
“No, guess I still have a lot to catch up to,” Steve says, a bit sheepishly like he has to apologize for not knowing everything.
Tony had opened the door to his car when he felt the phone in his pocket vibrate. There were only two people he cared about and one of them was overseas fighting a war so it probably left Pepper, his assistant.
“I paint, but I’m not super good at it or anything,” he added hastily.
“I’m sorry honey, I tried, but the judge moved the trial and I can’t do anything about it,” Tony said apologetically while he dragged his luggage through the airport.
“Thank you Mr. Stark and again, I am sorry for your loss.”
“Alright,” Tony said, accepting defeat for now. “Hey, you still haven’t told me what it is that you do.”
"Besides, you said we could ask for anything for our birthdays, so we'll unite our wishes and just ask this one thing," Harley added next to Peter.
“No, but I appreciate the offer. I’ll just go sign the paperwork and make my way back.” “Alright, please know that you can call me for anything. Stay safe Tony,” Pepper said, and Tony almost wanted to tell her to come with him, but he knew that if he wanted closure of some kind he had to do this alone.
Tony could only raise his eyebrows to that before digging in to his meal, he really was hungry.
"We wanted to ask you something," Mary said sweetly once she had rounded the table and climbed into his lap.
"I'm sure if you ask him as you did with me he'll say yes," Tony told them.
If someone would have told Tony that they were going to be able to save the entire universe just by fighting together he would have laughed at their faces.
Tony had to move his gaze for a second to gather his thoughts before he did  something stupid and embarrassed himself.
Tony was more than surprised about what Clint had said, he had never expected Jarvis to talk about him and less in such a fond way, if the way Clint greeted him was anything to go by. Just thinking about the way Jarvis never seemed to forget about him, despite the fact that Tony never made an effort to contact him, made his eyes sting and his chest ache.
Three hours later Tony finally parked outside of the diner, where he had asked Sam and Bucky to entertain Steve while he prepared the first half of his surprise.
Bruce took a few seconds typing before he answered. “You could probably check the diner one block away, Natasha and Clint, the owners, tend to work late until midnight,” Bruce said while giving his ID back. “One night would be 50 dollars.”
"Yes, we'll go looking at the shelter tomorrow," Steve said and took the opportunity to continue feeding Morgan while she was still in Tony's arms.
He dropped his head against the headrest.
“Of course I do, Jarvis never stopped talking about his son, the lawyer,” Steve said while laying down a blanket and motioning Tony to help him move the goat to a more comfortable lying position.
Tony thought with a smile on his face.
“Alright, then it’s settled,” Steve visibly sighed and glanced down to where Tony was still holding his hand.
“I’ll have blueberry pancakes, Natasha,” he finished saying once he had read the nametag she had on her apron. This was probably the Natasha Bruce had told him about.
“You come here often?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said hurriedly, “I truly didn’t mean it like that, it’s just that I have some of my art at home and you said you wanted to see them, but if you changed your mind it’s totally ok, I unders-”
Just an hour had passed before Tony was back at his car, papers signed and his last connection to Jarvis cut.
"Go on," Steve told his three children calmly.
Even Tony could admit that neither of them wanted to undo the embrace, so they stayed like that for what felt like hours until their teammates came to them celebrating the success.
Just by looking at the houses and restaurants he had passed Tony could understand why Jarvis and Ana had chosen this place to grow old after Howard and Maria passed. It was the typical town where everything was so close that you could be sure that everyone knew each other .
“Then it's settled,” Tony said, standing up and giving his hand to Steve for a shake.
“At what hour is your flight?” he asked. “If you have time then we could go to the diner, we kinda missed lunch time what with giving birth and everything,” Steve finished asking a bit out of breath, which let Tony know that he was nervous and actually meant the invitation.
Steve just looks at him in surprise, clearly having no idea what Tony is trying to do.
The second he stepped inside, the smell of bacon and pancakes filled his senses.There were a few people sitting at the tables off to the sides, so Tony decided to sit on a stool at the counter.
“Your honor, the state has introduced evidence that suggests that Mr. Walsh's former position is relevant to the case.” Tony answered already expecting Justin to object; the man couldn’t even pretend to be a little competent.
“I met them last night, they seemed like good people,” Tony said, actually meaning it. Both Clint and Nat had treated him like a friend despite having just met.
Tony still remembers how right after winning, all tired and disheveled, his first instinct was to check up on Steve and to his surprise and delight, Steve was already looking at him.
Thirty minutes and a lot of blood later, they had successfully delivered the cutest baby goat Tony had ever seen; it was full black with a white spot in the middle. Tony knew it was impossible but he would have liked to take the baby goat back to New York with him to raise it.
"Fine, but you can at least help us convince him," Harley said.
“I truly doubt that, but guess we’ll just have to wait until I see one of your paintings for me to make a verdict.”
But now, back in his car, Tony could admit that he did not want to leave Hinsdale just yet.
“No, you are amazing, accept it,” Tony said, emphatically.
“Guess you liked the song,” Tony says, a bit breathless.
Tony thought about the answer for a while. While it was true that that had been his original
"Nothing," Steve answered with a smile of his own.
"You hear that little miss, soon you'll have a little friend to play with," Tony told Morgan which made her babble incoherently.
After having spotted him, Steve made his way towards Tony.
Later on, once in the air,  Tony called Pepper.
After finishing the last bit of work he had, Tony called a cab for the airport.
"Of course!"
The inevitable happened and after all the celebrations, Steve wanted to talk and God did they talk. It was a really nice afternoon at the balcony of the Compound, totally perfect for some heart-to-heart talk.
"I take it the answer was positive," Tony said as he gathered Morgan in his arms, making her grin.
"Can we get a puppy?" Harley asked, and then added sheepishly, "please?"
His family could definitely be a little weird and exhausting at times but there wasn’t a thing he would change about them.
But some things never change and between those is Tony’s love for spending time working on new projects at the workshop.
Inside, the barn had wide doors with stalls for animals, and a hayloft at the top, where hay was stored. It was clearly well kept, like someone had taken care of it recently. There were some chickens to one side, three horses and some other animals. Now that Jarvis passed, Tony wondered who took care of these animals. Had they not been fed since Jarvis passed?
Two and a half hours later, the plane finally landed and Tony made his way to the rental car office. If he was spending a night in this place he was at least going to be able to drive himself.
"I love you," Steve said as he pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek.
Suddenly, a deep sense of nostalgia washed over Tony, he had missed most of their lives and now he would never get a chance to make it up to them.
Tony's smile only grows bigger at noticing Steve's parade posture, he looks a little like he is about to face an alien army, but the shy smile and blush on his face, clue Tony in that he is not just enduring for Tony’s sake.
"Not too fast,'' Steve said when they made to go running.
“Well, if those super-advanced glasses ever made can take a break, how about you join us for dinner?” Steve asks while grabbing a bench beside Tony and sitting on it.
“S-Steve...?”
“Why so formal, Cap?”
Steve feels a twinge of cutting pain, closing his eyes as the words slice through him like a knife. He could never think of Tony that way,
“We have to get him to the Quinjet,
“Sorry, Cap. Gotta go put on my noisy-as-fuck suit!”
guess, don't you think?"
Tony’s mind immediately fills with flashes from Afghanistan and a shiver runs through him. Rhodey can easily read Tony’s reaction, so he doesn’t go into more detail about that. “Also, he put himself between the armor and the blast so he took some pretty nasty blows.”
He turns around, startled at the familiar voice behind him, and immediately he can feel his body tense up. Tony’s there, by the door, gracefully leaning against it and contemplating the garden.
Hi, we missed you at practice today. Hope you’re ok. - Steve
“Gala?”
“Tony, wait.”
“Sure.” Steve’s smiling and he’s too close and too gorgeous. A little, almost imperceptible frown appears between his brows. “Just… please, don’t… don’t drink too much, okay?”
, Tony is desperate to know. He tells himself he just wants to hear his friend say that he accepts him just the way he is - wants him to say the words Howard never did. That’s what he tells himself, of course. Tony is actively avoiding giving the other explanation a second thought.
Tony stopped walking, frozen on the spot. Ok, that’s definitely
“Yes, Sir.”
you do it, but you can’t keep hiding here. You’ve missed training, you’ve missed debriefings and you’re barely eating anything at all.” He walks towards the elevator and he only turns around after he’s pushed the button. “He’s not Howard, Tony.
“You were angry. You
She gets out of her hiding spot and easily climbs the facility’s east wall, setting into position right above one of the guards. Steve circles the west wall and whistles. One of the guards walks over to inspect the noise and Steve wastes no time grabbing the man in a choke-hold, cutting the air off and leaving him unconscious, while Nat drops over the other guy and does the same with her legs. They drag the bodies out of sight, then Steve uses the code JARVIS has given him to open the door.
He jumps in the air like a cat when he feels a big hand tap on his shoulder. When he turns around, he can’t believe his eyes.
“Tony…” Steve glances around, like the walls of the compound could provide assistance in making a strong argument. “He’s complicated, Nat.”
“Are we going back to the comp-”
Rhodey half smiles like he knows
She narrows her eyes like she’s finally found something. “What are you
“No, I want to… I want

“Hey Tony, d’you mind if-”

“How many times-” Steve starts complaining with a tired sigh, extending his arms in an attempt to take it from him.

“Ok, what the absolute
“If you
“I tried. He won’t answer.”
He doesn’t want to think about it. Yet it’s all he’s been able to think about since this morning’s meeting.
His friend sighs next to him and nods.
Then he’d been apologizing over and over again for not being able to give Tony what he wanted and Tony had spent what should have been a perfectly good night of endless sex comforting Steve instead of fucking him. He swore to himself he would never ever bring it up again. He loved Steve more than he’d ever loved anyone and if he wasn’t comfortable with something, then that was off the table and he wouldn’t love him any less for it.
“Well,” Tony lets out a sarcastic laugh, “apparently the good old Captain has

His friend nods and his characteristic lopsided smile settles in his face. There’s just something so endearing in the way he keeps his head a little bent forward, like he’s expecting to get petted for being a good boy. Tony has to shake that thought away because it makes his mind go
He looks down and breathes out heavily, his hands flying to his hips. “I guess I screwed up…
, you know?” Tony whispers and Steve can see his eyes are suddenly a little brighter in the dark, something glinting in them. “I believed that…”
“Pretty impressive, isn’t it?”
, starts undoing his belt. “Do it, come on. Bend me over,
, Steve?”
“Yeah, and this isn’t Colonel Rhodes,
‘Steve’ swirls the digit around until he finds the bundle of nerves and Tony practically jumps off the bed.
“Steve!”
“Well, I’m not
“Yeah, I do.” She looks down at her nails, inspecting them. “How many one-night stands have you seen Tony bring to the compound, though?”
Tony reads his movements well enough and runs after him, catching him right before Steve can open the access to the roof and violently shoves him against the wall, using his own body to pin him down. Steve could easily break free but his mind is blank.
man, who let the sadness and the alcohol get the best of him, and that turned into a bad man. I don’t want to see that happen to you... and that’s why I hate that bottle glued to your hand. I hate it
“Coward!”
He’s leaning onto the bar, in a more secluded corner, happily chatting with a very handsome young man. He sips his scotch gracefully and grins a cocky smile at the guy, lifting a cocky eyebrow - his signature seductive move. The young stud closes in a little and places a soft hand on Tony’s forearm and the genius laughs out loud.
“You could at least put on a robe, Stark,” Fury had said, unimpressed by the fact that Tony had answered the video call in only a tank top and underwear, sitting on the side of his bed.
“You know Tony swings both ways, Cap. He’s hardly one to give you a hard time about this-”
! It’s been... forever!”
he was there.
. To be perfectly clear, Steve remembered what he’d been
“Huh?”
To Steve, it had felt like the whole compound had suddenly started shaking. Time had stopped and so had his lungs. It felt like diving into extremely cold water: a harsh, crippling sensation of pain and an inability to move a single muscle. Tony had just turned around slightly, his expression barely registering any change at all.
The whole team gathers in the conference room, Tony making sure he’s sitting as far away from Steve as he can. Fury’s hologram comes up along with the screens showing the data while Maria hands over StarkPads. They’ve been tipped about an imminent operation; the group of mercenaries they’ve been tracking for a few months are going to attempt breaking into an old HYDRA facility.
‘Steve’ grabs his head with both hands and starts ramming in and out of his mouth, as if Tony was nothing but a warm, wet hole for him to use.
“I’m afraid not.”
Tony can’t help the tears of both anger and pain fall down his cheeks. He keeps his gaze fixated stubbornly on the wall on top of him, while his mind is works at a fast pace going over all the possibilities. He could try kick him off of him, but he’s literally a replica of Steve, so he’s way too strong for him. He wonders if he could call the suit, but he can’t motion properly with his hands cuffed to the headboard. And even if any of his plans worked and he managed to get away from this man, there was still the threat upon the real Steve’s life.
Sam’s head pops up from the space between the door and the frame.
“This isn’t a game, Stark.” He tightens his grip ever so slightly to make his point. “I will
The second Tony looks down and sees the blond dipping his head down to lap at the head of his cock, he loses it.
‘Steve’ grows tired of his silence and slaps him hard across the face, making his head turn to the side.
“Well, he tried to come down to the lab that same day- with the ridiculous excuse to bring me food or something.” Tony was starting to feel the anxiety building up in his chest, as he brought a hand up to tap where the arc reactor used to be, absentmindedly. “I mean, can you believe that clown?”
fade. And so does this one.
But Steve - he winces at the thought of his name alone - hadn't stopped him.
He places his hands on both sides of Steve’s head as he deepens the kiss further, tongue exploring the welcoming warmth of Steve’s mouth, breathing heavily as they kiss. Tony can’t fucking believe it when he feels Steve kiss him back, a little shy and tentative, his hands running delicately but firmly up Tony’s back, like he’s holding onto him for dear life. He can feel the heat of Steve’s palms through the thin fabric of the shirt and,
Steve goes stiff as a board as Nat sweetly kisses him on the cheek and turns to leave the gym. He shakes his head, willing the thought away.
He had managed to keep it together, if he said so himself. Tony had gone back to Malibu for a few days. “You can call me in if there’s an emergency” he had said, gotten into his armor and flown away. No explanations, no additional information on his sudden decision to leave. Steve had been preoccupied. He had wanted to call him, text him,
like the whore I am, and then leave me the fuck alone!”
” Rhodey is looking at him in disbelief, a grim in his face. “What did he say?

He looks terrible. Dr. Cho has taken him off the sedatives, so now it’s only a matter of time before he wakes up on his own and the serum is healing his wounds faster than any human body could possibly recover, but still…
, you’ll get a chance to see your precious Stevie again. If you try anything or scream for help, he will die and it’ll be on you. Do you understand?”
Steve grabs his wrists to stop this madness and Tony reacts violently, trying to shove him off, free himself from the blond’s iron clad grasp and punching him in the chest, grunting. Steve feels his eyes water as he forcefully envelopes the smaller man in his arms and Tony finally gives up and starts sobbing.
Tony returns to his chair, trying to hide the wince of pain as he sits down. “Hey, by the way,” he adds casually “I already told everyone else in an e-mail but since I know you’re still stuck in the stone age...”
Tony reluctantly gives up the ‘fight’, feeling a sharp prick inside his chest, and carefully hands the object to Steve.
Steve even if his stupid body couldn’t tell the difference.

Tony grunts in annoyance. He can’t have this conversation without having had his coffee yet.
He finished his expensive scotch in one sip and looked around. He saw a guy through the crowd and his intoxicated mind linked the image of his broad back and blond hair to the sight that had greeted him in the compound’s kitchen a few days ago, so he marched down to the bar.
“Ngh- no!”
“Relax, shellhead, I’m pouring you one too” she said, grabbing two mugs from the cabinet.
“Wow! Careful there, genius!” Steve puts an arm around his waist, picking him up a bit off the floor like he weighs nothing. “Wouldn’t want that valuable head of yours cracked open, now, would we?”
Steve sighs and turns to Nat, who’s sunk into the couch and is taking off her high heels.
“Hi, Nick,” he had greeted them with deliberate fake enthusiasm. “I woke up this morning with a strange feeling in my stomach. At first I thought it was the hangover, now I can see it was my body trying to warn me about this...” — Fury narrowed his eyes in warning — “...pleasant surprise.”
. And it hurts to hear him say it. “No…”
feels like a punch to Tony’s gut and he feels a little lightheaded and nauseous all the sudden. He blames it on the booze, not the fact that Steve sounds incredibly sad and disappointed. He considers apologizing for a split second, but then his drunken mind tells him
“I thought you wanted me to give you a hand?” Steve reprimands him, “What good am I around here if you don’t ask for help?”
“I look ridiculous.”
and he’s getting angrier by the minute. Curse his stupid OCD. “I can’t believe you’re all taking his side!”
“A wise decision, Sir.”
Nat could barely breath from how hard she was laughing.
"I think we've established we don't know each other as well as we thought." It's more of a whisper than anything else but Tony's mouth parts in surprise and Steve is
off of me,” Tony whispers, chin up and ready to pick a fight.
but look after all of you-” his voice breaks. Steve’s color drains from his face as Tony tears his gaze from him and angrily walks away.
Steve had been okay with RSVPing yes to the Maria Stark Foundation Annual Gala since it was like… a month away. But November 12 came around a lot sooner than he’d thought.
“You look,” she smirks, “dashing,
Steve’s hand travels from his side to his belt, working on it with an uncharacteristic lack of nervousness.
He’s trapped.
He’s gonna do everything in his power to avoid the bastard because he’s pretty sure if he runs into him, he’ll Captain-America-kick his tiny, irritatingly round ass into oblivion and he’s not sure how he’s going to explain
“What?” he blinked, not sure of how he got from the elevator to the kitchen in the first place.
He mounts him, still fully clothed, and starts kissing his back. Tony lets out a content sigh. He feels Steve’s mouth traveling lower and lower, kissing and licking, massaging his sides with his strong hands. Tony lets out a moan when he feels Steve’s knees squeezing his legs together tightly, his lips over his lower back and then...
He watches Natasha approach him from behind in the reflection. She looks stunningly elegant and graceful, as usual, in an impossibly tight fitting red dress. “You look far from ridiculous. Everybody loves this look, Rogers.”
Please
." Tony can feel his eyes tear up as a shiver runs through him. He feels naked and exposed for a brief moment. "I don’t think my father was a bad man, Tony. I think he was a
Now he’s standing in front of the mirror, looking at his own reflection and wincing.

be so oblivious about it? Jesus Christ!
close now. “You can still walk away, Tony.”
“It could be,” Sam says, then falls silent for a second, but Steve shoots him a ‘don’t bullshit me’ look and he laughs loudly. “Okay, it probably won’t be, but at least you could be honest with him, get it out of the way...”
“Look at me.” Tony reluctantly lifts his gaze, blue piercing pools looking down at him. “That’s it, baby. I wanted my last night with you to really be
, and it’s a wanton moan and
So here they are, back in the workshop together. Steve has his sketchbook with him as usual, and The Clash plays in the background at an acceptable volume for the super soldier. He’s insisted that Tony plays his music - or at least, the soft ones - because Steve wants the man to enjoy himself as much as possible, given the fact he’s still nursing broken bones.
He has to admit to himself Rhodey isn’t completely
Tony flinches like he’s just been stabbed in the gut. When Rhodey leaves, he’s left standing in the middle of the workshop, angrily tapping his foot against the floor. He remembers sneaking up to the kitchen, stomach roaring in hunger, and seeing the pot roast sitting there in the tray. Something warm had briefly spread through his chest but was quickly drowned by the anger he still felt.
. It’s been over a week. We need to talk.”
Sam frowns and his smile fades away slowly. “And you do a great job at that, Steve. Nobody would ever respect you any less because you like men.”
“No, I mean about the other day, in the gym.” Steve feels good, he feels ready to come clean. His head is flying high in the clouds… it weighs nothing at all… this feels
Rhodey
“Huh?”
“Steve, if it’s not something you feel comfortable doing, that’s just fine. You don’t have to.” Tony’s smile is long gone and he’s looking at his friend with a firm, serious expression on his face.
Tony is in temper tantrum mode and Steve finally opens up to Sam.
Tony walked over to the kitchen table and dropped in one of the chairs with a sigh. Nat soon stood next to him, handing him the mug full delicious brown fuel that to Tony smelled like paradise and peace and happy puppies. He took a sip and his body immediate relaxed, paradoxically.
Weeks passed as Tony slowly recovered from his injuries - much slower than Steve, obviously. The super soldier was already out of the compound’s hospital bed and beating up punching bags in a little over a week. Tony, on the other hand, had to refrain from heavy lifting and any kind of exercise for four to six weeks and he was going out of his mind by week two.
Tony frowns in confusion, his mouth falling slightly open in disbelief.
“Just because he likes fellas doesn’t mean he likes me, Nat. What if- what if I tell him how I feel and he just laughs in my face? Or
“Oh, you do. You want it bad.” He speeds up his ministrations, relishing on the way Tony trashes around and pulls at the cuffs that keep him strained to the headboard. “Will you scream his name when you come on my cock, Tony?”
, he got mad because he thought Tony deserved more than meaningless sex? He frowns, eyes glued to the blond’s face and the small, alleviated smile there.
for so long… And suddenly it’s nothing to worry about. He doesn’t have to pretend, he doesn’t have to fake it to be respected and taken seriously. A part of him feels amazing about it, but the other doesn’t really know what’s next, because he’s never been in this situation before. He feels his eyes tearing up a bit with the weight of it all and he’s mortified. His mind automatically screams
“Very well,
.” She steps closer and lies a hand on his shoulder. “And I bet I won’t be the only one to notice.”
Tony swallows hard, eyes wide open in surprise and confusion.
"Meaningless sex, yes. What if he just wants me to be another one on the list? And then just go back to being friends and nothing else?" Steve looks down at his feet and shakes his head, defeated. "I can’t do that.”
It’s been a few days already and after battling Helen ad nauseam, he’s been finally allowed to get on a wheelchair and let into Steve’s room.
“I’m sorry, didn’t really- I didn’t feel like running today,” Steve answers, trying to sound casual, although he already knows that’s not going to work with Sam.
He opens his eyes slowly, the left one hurts a bit. He can feel the IV line on his arm as well as something warm and heavy enveloping his hand. When he looks down his heart skips a beat and the weight on his chest lifts a little. Tony’s sitting on a wheelchair, head slightly tilted to the side in what must be a very uncomfortable position for his neck and he’s…
“You know,” her soft, slightly amused voice startles him much less than it should, “that’s not gonna help.”
There’s a loud sound and he feels his body go off the ground and hit the wall. Everything goes dark.
To his surprise, the blond just laughs harder and squeezes his side.
Steve’s head flies up, jaw clenched tightly.
Tony’s working intently on an upgrade of Widow’s Bites - S.H.I.E.L.D tech,
, he thinks, but as usual the words die unsaid in his throat.
“...You’re very annoying when you do that.”
He looks at her as she sits down in a nearby bench, carefully, like she’s facing a scared animal that could run away at any moment without warning. She knows Steve keeps everything personal - especially feelings - to himself because he has the ‘I’ll deal with my own stuff because it’s nobody’s business but mine’ kind of attitude, so this has to be approached cautiously.
“Are you sure?” She hiccups.
Five hours later…
Bruce does as he’s told and watches Tony flip them open to examine the head closer. It looked like there were little barbs all along the nose of it. “Are you using those as a magnifying glass?”
Pepper presses the button again. “I’ll go down myself.”
Thor smirks. “Megingjord.”
“No idea. But maybe you can ask his friends. I just overheard him call in a team to intercept you. Switching to satellite. First sucker is coming in on your three o’clock. Need me to come in?”
“Anything you want Kiddo.” Tony sniffles before taking out his sunglasses and sliding them on his face. Steve does not miss the moisture that had gathered around his eyes. The super husbands each take one of Mari’s hands and they exit the building. They end up talking Mari into shaved ice instead and Mari tells Steve about all the things her and Tony did. Including getting her fit for glasses. Tony had gotten worried when she kept running into the clear glass walls and had to lean in close to read text. After a call to Bruce she had been diagnosed with being, “blind as a bat” and Bruce informed them that worsening eye sight was not uncommon for people with her condition. When Steve and Tony see paparazzi start to gather outside the shop they collect Mari and go back to the tower. After settling in Mari went to playing with her erector set and Steve and Tony watched her from the couch. Tony turns on the TV to the news and curls into Steve’s side.
No one answers as Steve starts running up the steps.
“Five please.” She starts taking off cookies.
“I’ll start clean up.” Steve says as he moves to throw out the charred remains of their evening.
“Why?” Steve asks with a suspicious frown.
“Now?” he asks.
“I’ll take you downstairs. Make sure we validate your parking.” Tony opens the door.
“NO!” Tony watches in horror as parts of the stairs crash down past them. Tony goes to the railing and looks up. The explosive blew off parts of the stairs a couple flights up. “Mari!?! MARI!?!”
“I had a feeling you’d say that which is why I wanted to make a proposition.”
Steve zips up his jacket as he walks down the hall to head out on his morning run. As he passes Mari’s door he stops and stares at it with a small smile. It was still hard to believe that this was happening. Steve could still remember the painful squeeze in his chest when he had been plummeting toward the ice and realized he was not getting the future that he and Peggy talked about. Then the sad resignation when he had woken up seventy years later and found his world was gone. Even when he had gone through the awkward courting that Steve and Tony called their dating life he had accepted that kids just were not going to happen for him. But when the self-proclaimed playboy had surprised him with a proposal he had begun to entertain the idea again. Finally, things were working out for him. Not in quite the order he had planned but like his mother always told him, beggars cannot be choosers.
“Yay! I like him better anyway.” She huffs and kicks her legs to be let down which Tony obliges. Tony arches his brow at the mess. He glances at Steve who’s only answer is a tired, “Don’t ask.”
“Oh so you do listen to me after we’re patching you together from going off halfcocked.” Steve grimaces as the words leave his mouth. Now was not the time to rehash that argument. They had it often enough and Tony’s sharp glare confirms his misstep. Steve speaks in a softer tone. “I know you’re terrified about becoming your father-“ He stutters to a stop when he gets a face full of cloth.
“Yes. Like kissing on the mouth.”
“Go get patched up. Pepper and I can handle everything here. And if you don’t go I’ll just keep pinching you until you do.” Natasha says, ending her sentence with a pinch to his side.
Over an hour earlier…
“Which is why they're in the shake.” Tony turns on the blender. When her hands fly up to cover her ears against the loud whirring he covers her hands with his. Once the mix turns into a thick liquid he switches it off and pours it into two cups before screwing a lid onto the smaller one. He hands her the smaller cup and holds his up. “Salute.” They tap their drinks together before taking a swig. He chuckles when her face screws up. “Don't like it?”
“How could you have possibly heard that?” Tony asks. “You were off at story time with MC Hammer.”
“I’ll handle this. You handle that.” Tony nods towards the balcony where a fidgeting Bucky is looking around.
“I won’t,” he answers and watches her leave with a thoughtful frown on his face. He sits back down, thinking over the nagging feeling in his gut.
“I don’t know…it had lots of names and departments…”
“Why are you fighting me on this?” Steve asks.
“She doesn’t have her glasses on, it’s not like she can see me.” Clint turns back to his plate.
“She wasn’t a problem,” Tony said as he stood from the bench.
“Great. You mind picking me up a smoothie on your way back when you find nothing?” Hawkeye asks.
Steve pulls out a slip of paper and shows it to him. In familiar chicken scratch is a note reading, “Had a bonergency. IOU Barton.”
Tony’s frown drops and he looks taken aback. “What?”
“No way!”
Ms. Flander sighs. “I thought we were past this dear…”
“I’ll order some pizza,” says Sam.
“Is everything okay?”
“The guy may still have a hard on for Tony. He did get his ass handed to him pretty hard. I guess that means we have a who now.” Sam walks towards the table to look over some of the files. “What were you looking into the Count for?”
“A little rough housing doesn’t justify bashing his face in! Or biting a chunk out of his hand! He is going to have a scar!”
Mari is already shaking her head before he finishes talking.
As she speeds toward them they pull out firearms and batons. The ones leading the charge open fire and she swerves, leaning down to pick up the sniper’s fallen gun. As she returns fire she sighs, wondering where mercenaries got their marksmen training nowadays. They just don’t make killers like they used to.
“No. That man hasn’t been around for a long time.” He puts the last crayon in the box and hands it back to her. When she takes it he stands and steps away. “Now go on. Get on back before he realizes you’re gone. And make sure he gets that folder.”
“I stood up against a bully and won!”
“Breakfast of Heroes.” Sam smirks as he grabs the box and pours himself a bowl.
“Why?”
“Um…” she looks between the two heroes with wide, scared eyes. “Um…MEOW!”
“Of course I can get through it. The Count only hires the best and the best I am. He wants a way to get at Stark, I’ll get him a way. No doubt about that.”
“That’s impossible…” Tony looks around and pats himself down.
“Talk about the blind leading the blind,” Sam mumbles.
“I might split the cash once in a while.”
“What about the girls? Think any of them would be a good fit?”
Sam nods in agreement to Bucky's remark.
“It can’t be that bad. Steve looks like he’s having the time of his life.”
“Nothing?” Nat asks. She doesn’t show anything more than mild curiosity but Clint takes note of the “I’m-Black-Widow-fear-me” face.
“Coffee works for me. Tomorrow.” He rests his forehead against hers.
“We’ve got hostiles coming out from the surrounding forest. Two of the prison transports got out but they downed the one with Strucker. Agents are trying to get it in the air again. Hawkeye and I have it covered but we could use some back up,” Wasp says.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks and reaches a hand out to steady her. He looks up when Ms. Flander sighs again.
“Like…real ones?” she asks, uncurling herself.
Mari giggles at that. “Ok…I think I can try…”
“You mean aside from the fact that I just got schooled by a kindergartener? Yeah. Everything’s peachy. Oh, by the way, we need a new microwave and tv remote…”
“Well if you ever change your mind, as a former playboy, I am more than happy to offer my contacts.”
“Greetings young Marianna. I am Thor. Son of Odin. God of Thunder.”
“I’m heading him off.” Natasha pulls off from the group. “Send him my way.”
“For holding our memories for us. Could you...share some with me...eventually…”
Mari pulls away from her Aunt and Uncle and tugs on their hands. “Come see my room. It has all this neat stuff. Come on.”
“Well I don’t want to alarm you.”
Sam stands and grabs their plates. “For the record, just because my uniform has wings on it doesn’t mean I’m a bird enthusiast.”
Steve turns to Bucky with wide eyes.
“She’s not being nice,” Mari mumbles.
“Clear.” Janet says.
Steve sits beside him and reaches an arm around his shoulders when Tony says, “Distract me.”
“I’m sure she will forgive me if I steal you away for a couple hours to get some important work done. Right Mari?”
“And form conclusions based on that evidence,” Mari finished.
“No. Something is overloading the system. And corrupting other parts…”
“Da minn og frændi eru íslenska. Þeir sögðu mér sögur allan tímann.” (My Da and Great Uncle are Icelandic. They told me stories all the time.)
She passes all the closed doors until she sees one that is open at the end of the hall. She peaks her head inside it when suddenly the door behind her flies open causing her to jump and yelp. She turns and releases her breath when it turns out to be a young blonde girl. The preschooler skips out to stand in front of the full length mirror halfway between the two sides of the hall. The girl has platinum blonde hair rolled into ringlets and is wearing a white canvas shirt and pastel floral pants. She had started making poses and kissy faces at her reflection.
They turn to see Nat walking towards them with Sam and Clint behind her.
“Check your phone,” Nat says.
Mari stares at him with a blank expression.
“I DON’T KNOW! WHAT FIVE YEAR OLD KNOWS WHAT A SECURE SERVER IS LET ALONE HOW TO HACK ONE!?! UGH!”
“And none of those oatmeal ones.” He pauses by the doorway.
“MUTE! MUTE! FOR THE LOVE OF ROBOTICS MUTE!” Tony shrieks.
She takes another sharp turn at the end of the alley and speeds down the street. Bikes burst out of the alley ahead of her and open fire. She is forced to swerve and shoots down another road between two warehouses. She swerves, barely missing a bullet that comes from above. Another soon follows the first, then another, and another. One hits her back tire causing her to swerve. She leans into it and uses it to roll behind a dumpster. More bullets rain down around her getting close but none have a good enough angle. She pulls out a grenade and a compact mirror. She then listens for the shots and watches the pattern of the bullets. She then lifts the mirror over the lip of the dumpster and angles it up towards the windows of the surrounding warehouses. She gets a glimpse of two muzzle flashes before the mirror is shot out of her hand. She pulls a pipe out of the box next to her and gives it a once over.
“You heard of not being a little chicken shit?” Steve glances at the pocket holding his phone when the curse alert goes off.
“Divide and conquer.”
“Go treat yourself to a coffee. No need for you to wait around here for us. I’ll text you.” He gives Happy a nod before making his way toward the distracted artist.
“Tony? Tony, where are you?” Tony hears Steve’s muffled voice.
Steve glances back to see her snuggle under the shield and close her eyes.  He leaves and goes back to join Tony.
He looks over and sees Thor begin to swing his hammer around by its strap. He groans as an uneasy feeling settles in his stomach. Despite his apprehension he steps closer and wraps him arms around Thor’s neck. “Why did we have to live in a tower…?”
“The schematics and research we pooled had a wide range,” says Bruce. “But most of it had to do with neurology, sleep, and dream studies.”
Tony takes her wrist that has the watch he designed and presses a couple buttons. When Mari feels a needle prick at the inside of her wrist she yelps and jerks her hand away. He pulls it back again. “Let me see...your iron levels are low.”
“HULK! DON’T DO IT!” Clint shouts. “WE PROMISED WE WOULDN’T BREAK ANOTHER COUCH!”
“It’s no problem really.”
Steve pauses in pouring Thor a drink to look at him. He opens his mouth to speak but is cut off by a high pitched yell of, “Thooooor!”
They all pause to look at him.
Steve smiles and kisses a quick peck to his husband’s lips. “You know, sometimes I wonder if you agreed to have a kid with me just so you had one more person to dress up.”
“There’s nothing to worry about Kiddo.” Tony says. “Here, watch this. Jarvis, run a scan. How many biologicals are on this floor?”
“Why do you need potassium iodide?” Bruce catches a whiff of their scents and scrunches up his nose. “And why do you two smell like butane lighters?”
She pouts. “Okaaay…”
Due to some information that will be dispersed in this chapter I feel the need to make a disclaimer so...
“You already have everything she owns.”
Tony leans in even more and makes fish faces. “That’s not how hashtags work Rhodey. Come on. Give me your bitc-“
“It’s not real. It was just a very bad man.”
“Why!?!” Steve turns back to Mari. “Why would you hit other kids?”
Tony snorts and peeks his head over the door to the shower. “Why?”
Looks like it was gonna be one of those days.
dating advice?”
Tony shakes his head and sets her down. He pats her back. “Come on lets start our day too.”
“No and I’d like to point out that I can easily get a job where I don’t have to suffer verbal abuse from you or physical abuse from Russian super spies.” He jumps as the door rattles in its frame.
“I was worried you’d be angry at me for letting Mari get hurt.”
Steve rolls his eyes at Tony’s attempt at a deflection but says, “We’re parents now Tony. We know everything.”
“But no.”
“Neither do I…” Mari mumbled.
“Always a businessman first.” He winks and stirs the slush into the punch.
“You don’t need to bite my-“
All sound coming from the room stops and the shadow disappears from under the door. Mari purses her lips and glances back at her door before taking a deep breath and going up to open the door to her parent’s room. She looks around and is surprised to find the room in disarray. Clothes are hanging over the edge of drawers, the paper work from her father’s brief case is scattered around the floor, and the decorative box her mother kept her jewelry in lays on the floor with its lid ripped off. She turns to her parents who are lying in bed, still.
Steve flinches at his harsh tone. “Is that what this is about? The fact I’ve been out looking for Bucky. You don’t have to be jealous pip-“
“Have you been awake this whole time?” Tony asks in a soft voice.
He reaches round and pries Mari out from behind him. He walks over to kneel in front of her and sets Mari between them. “Peggy, this is my daughter, Marianna. Mari, this is Peggy Carter. She’s the woman your Dad and I have been telling you about. She’s the reason we got together in fact.”
“Of course.”
Mae nods rapidly and scoots to the edge of the couch cushion. She turns to her husband and speaks in a stern voice not looking away from the man. “Ben and I would be VERY happy to join you. Won’t we dear?”
“It was Icelandic,” Mari explains. “My Da and Great Uncle taught me.”
“Yeah but you remember last year!?! That was one wild party and you know there is gonna be a mountain of cool ass toys this year! This is gonna be unlike any Christmas she’s ever had!”
“You promise?”
“You’re right.” She turns back to Tony and Steve. “Grandbaby. Now.”
Aaron steps aside to let them in. He leans down and waves to Mari who stays clinging to the back of Steve’s thigh. “There’s some tea and biscuits in the sitting room for you. All kidney friendly of course.” He directs the last bit to Steve.
“I lov-“
Tony turns to the others. “Ok, so the other day I showed Mari some project files we’ve been working on. I won’t go into too much detail but they do represent a large investment for the company. So much so that we added a few layers of security, which include a shi- a boat load of encryption and a virus that infects any device that’s not logged onto Jarvis and sends out a pulse with the location of where it is being accessed.”
“Yeah, yeah.” He kneels next to Mari and twists the cap off her juice for her. “Now we are just going to be downstairs. If you need me go to the elevator, down five floors or ask Jarvis, and you’ll see me in the conference room to the right or just press your panic button.” He takes her wrist and shows her the button on her wrist monitor.
Tony glances at him before looking to Bruce with a furrowed brow. “So what? He’s looking to wreak havoc by scwary nightmwares? If he’s trying to ruin my sleep schedule jokes on him. I already don’t sleep.”
“So our marriage...it was just a cover…”
Mari buries her face in the back of his leg.
The Count shoots one last glare before folding his arms behind his back and turning to the tech. “Are you at least close?”
Sam takes a spoon and slips it under her shirt to press the metal to her side.
"I'm trying out some new faux cuss words that don't make me sound like a white suburban dad."
The Captain marches forward. “You’re on my shit list Count.” He grabs him by the collar and lifts him from the ground. “Let’s not make this more painful than it’s going to be for you.”
He was just going to close his eyes to get a few extra minutes of sleep. Just a couple and then he’d be ready for the day. Next he knew though he was staring at that god forsaken portal. He had seen this particular view enough times to know that he was dreaming but seeing it slowly close in front of him still had his heart pounding against his chest. He spins around trying to locate his suit on the desolate rock but it was nowhere in sight. His head snaps back up to the portal in time to see it shut with a pop. His heart feels like it is about to burst as he tears his eyes away and back to the landscape. Well, at least his team mates were not littering the ground this time.
The Captain throws his shield again. He hits an agent and dodges another’s fire. He catches the shield on rebound and rushes him. He checks him. He throws his shield and ducks. The shield hits an agent to his right and an arrow whizzes over the Captian, hitting a HYDRA agent behind him. He rolls and grabs his shield. He sees Falcon swoop down and takes out a row of men. A sharp boom echoes and Thor bursts into the sky. The god throws his hammer into the thick of the enemy creating a crater and throwing the men to the ground. That’s when the jet with the prisoners roars to life.
“Well look at that, someone who actually wants to cooperate.”
“But I had it-” He shuts his mouth at Nat's glare. “Come here Kiddo.” He waves her over and sits her in his lap before trading her drink for the controller. “Ok. Here are the controls…”
“Everything you need to know is in that folder.” Bucky rolls Steve off him and scrambles away only to be jerked to the ground again. “God damn it Steve! Let go of me!”
“Not everyone who works for Osborne sold their souls to the devil.”
“Why would I be mad at you?”
“Yeah but how many bilingual five year olds do you know?”
She stills with her hand over the tray. “Six.”
Steve laughs and helps Bucky sit up. “How about you ask her out to coffee first Buck.”
“She is a lively one,” says Thor. “But she has trouble staying on her feet no?”
“With him being deaf and all. The explosions don’t bother him much.”
When he rears back she knocks the gun from his grasp and connects the junction of his neck with the end of the baton, flipping the electric shock on. He spasms and falls to the ground as another guard rounds the corner in the alleyway behind her. She dives behind a dumpster as he fires at her. While bullets impacted into the metal and trash, she draws her own gun.
As they escape the playground, Bucky tugs a tissue out of his back pocket and tries to clean up her face. “Your parents are going to kill me.”
“No but why wouldn’t you? Ooof!” Tony rubs at his ribs where Steve elbowed him. “You know you don’t do that as gently as you think you do.”
“SHIELD let him in! He had a forged badge and ID and let a virus into the system when they scanned it! And then he proceeded to Pep’s floor where he knocked out Valencia and hacked into Pep’s computer.”
“Phones still work. It’s just everything that was connected to Jarvis that seems to be down.”
“You’re supposed to be heart broken,” Tony whispers in her ear.
“Tony, wake up.” Steve whispers into his ear. “It’s okay. You’re home. You’re safe. Tony. Tony!”
“Don’t worry about it. I guess this was going to happen eventually.”
“Hey! Knock it off!” Steve says as he walks over to the table with Mari’s porridge. “You want me to put you two in the naughty corner? Cause I will!”
“Okay, everything seems to be in order with the home,” says Ms. Flander as she comes back up the stairs to the lab with Tony. “May I speak with Mari for a moment alone?”
Steve takes the mug. “You have a problem.”
She tilts her head. “No.”
“Don’t worry Thor. You know how we fight. We always make up.”
“Oh. You're home,” Clint says as he dangles from his perch.
“No. I want this now,” he grunts out as he prepares himself with rough thrusts. “And I want it hard. You got it soldier boy?” It takes a while but once Tony is able to thrust four fingers in with minimal resistance he jerks them out and swats Steve’s hand away from his erection. As soon as Steve’s hand is out of the way he is impaling himself on his husband’s eager and twitching cock.
Bucky can’t help but chuckle at that.
“Does your wife know you are teaching your daughter to be a thug?”
Steve sighs and retracts his hand. “No. We didn’t find him. Got some intel on Chameleon though.”
She glances over at Steve. “It doesn’t seem like a good surprise…”
“And it’s Natasha.”
Thor’s hammer comes down on it and makes a reverberating ringing sound. Captain America winces as fire rips through his shoulder but holds his position. The reverberations widen out and blast the remaining men away. The Captain surveys the area and puts a hand to his shoulder.
Mari glances at each of them before pulling the top book closer and flipping through the pages. She pauses halfway through and turns the book towards the two adults. “This one.”
Steve looks up to frown at him. “I wasn’t suggesting we give up custody.”
Mari gives a small wave before going back out onto the playground. She looks to the bench and sees Steve standing in front of it with his sketchbook abandoned off to the side. His eyes are scanning the equipment when she sees he is not alone anymore.
“We both had heightened senses Buck. We weren’t gonna let some Nazis get the drop on us. And it wasn’t like it lasted that long.”
“Don’t ask,” Steve and Tony say in tired voices.
Thor nods and makes his way to Captain America, tossing agents out of his path. He gets to the Captain and raises his hammer. Captain America raises his shield and braces himself. He hears a bang behind him, then feels a piercing pain through his left shoulder which is followed by the sound of a bullet bouncing off Thor’s armour. There is a repeated clicking sound. They both turn to look behind the Captain.
“Daddy?”
“Do you like these?”
“Be-Because he was a bully. And you said that the only-the only thing that lets bullies win is for good people to do nothing, so-so I did something.”
“Your kid hasn’t been removed from our system yet. Neither have her great Aunt and great Uncle.”
“No need to be so formal. You can call us Steve and Tony or something else if you want. We’re going to be family now. No Misters needed,” says Steve.
“Do you ever stop talking!?!”
“Because they didn’t find any evidence of that.” Ms. Flander moves closer and takes Mari's hand. She gives it a squeeze. “They combed the house for any evidence they could find. The evidence shows that it was just a home invasion.”
“Clint also says the tooth fairy is real and that’s-” He pales when he sees her jaw drop and her eyes widen. “ANYWAY, we’re picking out schools for you.”
“You’re late,” says Happy.
Tony glances over at him with his mouth in a firm line.
“What cuss jar!?!” Clint demands.
“I’m sorry sweetie. But sometimes...sometimes the bad guys are just normal people who do bad things to good people.”
“Arms out,” he says to her as he holds up a scanner wand.
Tony and Rhodey say, “War Machine.” At the same time Steve says, “Iron Patriot.” They look at each other.
Tony thinks to himself in a panicked rush.
“Screw that!” Tony swings up and presses his husband down into the mattress. He sticks two fingers in his mouth and coats them in saliva before pressing them at his hole.
Tony looks and sees a kidney pump imbedded in her stomach.
“Oh come Steve, let the kid live a little,” says Bucky.
“It’s okay Papa. It’s only dry erase. Daddy said I can do it. We’re doing derivatives.”
“I know you agree with me.”
“Some things still need to come first.” Steve reaches a hand over to the night stand drawer and digs around.
Steve groans. “It’s been a while since I’ve done anything to you.” He lifts Tony’s leg and wraps it around his hip as he drapes himself over the smaller man. He presses desperate kisses to Tony’s mouth as he grinds and gyrates their hips together, smearing pre-cum along both their stomachs. The warm slide causes pleasure to shoot up and down their spines and their kissing soon turns to gasping.
“And then we’re the assholes keeping her from her real family!” Tony spins to face him, his voice raising with each word.
The street is dark and all the lights are off in the house at the end of the lane. All is silent. No crickets, no animals scurrying in the nearby nature preserve. Inside the home a little girl lays curled up in her bed clutching to her pillow. Her chest tightens and her face scrunches up at the uncomfortable thump of her heart against her ribcage. She buries herself further under the covers so only a tuff of wild brown hair can be seen.
Bucky turns to watch Tony storm out onto the balcony with Steve close on his heels. They start arguing again before the glass door completely shuts. When the glass closes their loud voices turn to soft murmurs. Bucky sighs and runs a hand through his hair. Just as he contemplates slipping out before they notice he hears a small shuffle to his left. He turns to find a little girl glaring daggers at him with a teddy bear in her arms. Great. Someone else who has a reason to hate him. He waits for her to say something but she just glares at him.
“There are too many bread crumbs that lead to this district and we have nowhere else to look. I’m not leaving until I find something.”’
“Yeah I got that from the damn dossier.” Tony flinches when Mari grumbles and snuggles her face against his shirt. He says in a quieter tone so he does not wake the child sleeping against his chest, “Why would Barnes give us a file on this guy?”
“Hey!” The Count shouts. “What are you doing!?! Stop it you spineless, figlio di putt-”
“Yeah we did. We were going to get married.”
“Distract me.” He lifts his head and reveals the panic in his face. Steve tightens his arm around his husband as Tony’s breathing becomes faster and shorter. He feels the man begin to tremble. “I need you to distract me.”
“Have you been watching us?”
“Hey, calm down. Everything’s okay. You don’t have to tell me anything. Um…” He gives her head a stiff pat but bites his lip when she continues to rock back and forth in her seat. He wracks his brain trying to think of how to calm her.
"HYDRA wouldn't be interested in a hit," says Nat. "They'd want to knock Tony off no doubt but if this is them it's unrelated to what Nefaria is doing."
When she leaves Steve turns back to Sam and Bucky who are trying to clean the worst of it off themselves. “Guys, I know you didn’t sign up for this whole kid thing but I need you to be on your best behavior when she’s around. She looks to the adults in her life to learn how she should act, how she should treat others. How she should expect to be treated. We are her examples. She’s learning from us. You never know what she might pick up.”
Steve’s head shoots up and he glances at Fury before he meets Tony’s eyes. Tony reaches over and lays his hand over Steve’s, giving it a gentle squeeze. Anything involving the super soldier serum seemed to always go to shit for those involved and Steve never could explain the feeling of guilt that came with it.
“Nothing too dangerous,” says Steve in an assuring voice.
Ms. Flander waits. “Mari... how have you been sleeping?”
“Let’s just keep the pda to a minimum please?”
She turns at the sound. Her grumpy expression turns to a smile when she sees him. “Papa! You’re back. You missed snack time.” She pouts.
“Just help Mari clean the windows please.” Steve returns to removing all the fingerprints and smudges from the stainless steel surface on the oven.
“When I was her age I was fumbling together circuit boards. She’s hacking into complex security systems. We need to make sure that brilliance is harnessed so she can reach her max potential.”
“How am I supposed to eat the food when he keeps walking around with the plate?” Clint demands.
“It’s okay. It’s just a flesh wound,” he says, not missing the deep frown on Tony’s face. “But look at you! Did Tony give you a makeover?”
“But I wanna hop!”
She looks to Tony and he nods. She settles for that and pulls the covers further up.
“They’ve been fighting the decision ever since she was taken away. If they had the money they’d probably go to court. Letting them close will only give them an opportunity to find a way to have our custody revoked.”
Steve turns and looks at the soggy kitchen and blackened food. “Well, I think dinner is pretty much ruined.”
Tony pries Mari’s hands off his shirt and hands her over before taking Bruce’s seat. He gathers the bits of metal, then picks up what’s left of the head.  Without looking up he holds out his hand and says, “Hand me Mari’s glasses.”
Beware, google translate approaches.
“I am in fact married, you know. To Tony Stark no less. That implies
“Really, really.” Steve nuzzles her nose.
Steve blushes a couple shades darker. “I DO NOT-” He snaps his jaw shut and looks around. Then he leans over to whisper, “You remember Howlett?”
“Daddy has kissed lots of girls on the mouth.”
“Oh. No, sorry. Jarvis unmute.” Steve says.
Despite the hand clasped tightly across her mouth a squeak escapes.
“Want me to deploy one of the suits? I can put it on sentry mode. That might make her feel better.” Tony asks.
“How many friends did you have when you were young? Not the Commandos and Peggy. I mean when you were a kid.”
“I’m her father, I think Steve will understand.” He takes another step forward only for the agent to step back again.
Mari puts a finger to her mouth and shushes Tony. “No phallic toy no talky.”
“But Dr. Banner says there’s a switch.” Mari’s shoulders drop and her excited smile drops into a frown.
“That was an investment. For when we had kids.”
“…child services case was…shaky…at best.”
“Sorry to interrupt sir,” says Jarvis over the speaker. “But systems have been restored to the tower.”
“You,” Tony, Sam, and Bucky say at once.
“We could never connect her with anything solid, but I have my suspicions.”
“Then get that ass moving.”
“Can Bucky be on our team?” she asks Sam.
“Now hold on,” says Clint. “What would Nefaria need with SI personnel files?”
“No. What is it?” Steve asks.
“The chicken was pre-seasoned. I just put it in the oven.”
“TONY! LANGUAGE!” Steve turns to Mari. “Don’t ever repeat that!”
“Eh, I only shoot the stuff they shouldn’t be making in the first place.” Clint turns to the read outs in front of Bruce. “Speaking of being naughty, what are you guys looking at?”
“Then which floor? I want to see what you’ve been doing with that data you stole.”
“You don’t know that,” says Steve.
“Вот дерьмо,” Nat curses as she rubs the bridge of her nose. (Oh shit.)
“No.”
Ms. Flander scoffs and says, “I wouldn’t leave her alone with any of your computers if I were you.”
“Diamond for your thoughts?” Tony asks flopping face down next to his husband.
“Howlett…?”
"Language," Steve says in a dry tone.
“A five year old human child! Although the human part is still under review. I’m starting to think maybe she’s an android in disguise.”
She frets at her hair a little harder. “So you’re not mad at me?”
“Him again?” Tony groans. “I thought the Maggia would have kicked him out when we kicked his butt. Why are they still letting him use their resources?”
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
What's this? Some semblance of plot?
“He wouldn’t dare,” Steve says against Tony’s neck but he can feel the cold dread seep into his stomach.
“Is that really all we have waiting for us? This eternal shit hole we call lives?” A woman with a prosthetic leg asks.
in his sleep.
“I’m-” he backs away even further, horrified. “I’m sorry,” Tony says, avoiding his gaze as he shoves a very confused, very paralyzed Steve out of the way and rushes through the door.
Tony growls and runs his hand through his hair.
“Not to mention the--” he feels his face contorting in disgust, “the
“Tsk, tsk, tsk. You gonna behave and be quiet, doll face.”
“Stark, can you get us that code?”
“Stark. STARK!”
She’s using that socratic method he profoundly hates because it’s always very effective. He knows there’s no fighting it though, Nat won’t leave it alone.
She can’t be right. She just can’t.
Steve notices his own nostrils flare and his hands turning into fists. He has to leave this building,
The blond rolls his eyes as he lowers down the metal over the workbench. “You’re hysterical.”
Predictably, and much to Tony’s amusement and delight, Steve’s cheeks turn a bright shade of pink as he laughs and walks back to the couch. There’s a short silence as Steve settles back in his spot and Tony goes back to work, but then… “I guess it is.”
“I know you miss me terribly but you have to learn to control your urges, honeybear.”
“Strip.”

Steve wants to cry. He can feel the burn behind his eyes and the tingling around the nose area.
“I should
“Wha- who are you? What have you done with him?”
“You’re an idiot,” he finally says.
“What do you mean?”
Tony’s half-way through a bottle of scotch, splayed out on the sofa, the warmth of the booze spreading nicely through his body and numbing his brain. He needs the numbness now. He hopes that if he drinks heavily enough, the alcohol might be able to wipe out what had happened on that roof tonight. It's not just that he doesn't want to think about it, he needs it to be gone, erased from existence.
Sam makes a face and waves a hand dismissively in the air.
“Oh, Tony... no safeword is going to make me stop tonight.”
Steve can feel every muscle in his body tensing up, like he’s waiting for a metaphorical blow that’s taking too long to land. When he finally speaks, his voice comes in a low whisper of disbelief.
“And neither does Tony. That’s why I always see right through him.”
“Tony?”
He punches the bag again, relishing on the burn in the skin of his clenched fist.
“So...” he casually walks over to the coffee machine and opens the cabinet above, looking frantically around the room as he goes. “You enjoying some alone time? Quiet breakfast?”
“What can I do for you, Tony?” he says coldly between pull ups.
The elevator doors of the Stark Tower penthouse open and they stumble into Steve’s floor, laughing their asses off.
Steve groans and picks up the pace to get to him and when he does, he takes him by the arm and turns him around. Tony tries to get away, an outraged look on his face, so Steve grabs his shoulders and traps him against the wall, blocking him with his own body.

, and then sucks at it. Tony can’t help a yelp of surprise and pain mixed with pleasure.
Tony doesn’t really want to talk about this. He wants to move on, leave the whole thing in the past, but the question leaves his mouth before he can help it.
Another hard blow lands on his ass. Too rough, too close to actual pain to be pleasant.
“Are the rest here yet?”

“Good question,
He roughly withdraws his finger, making Tony pant in discomfort and easily grabs him by the hips, turning him around. The chain on the cuffs twists at the motion and pulls at his wrists and Tony winces, now looking up at the ceiling of Steve’s bedroom.
Tony forces himself to look away and turn around. “Of course I’m feeling okay. Don’t be such a mom, Rogers. I’m
The blond gives him one of his clenched-up-jaw looks, fuming, and Tony mistakes its meaning.

there's something else." Steve sighs and closes his eyes, like he’s getting ready to blurt something embarrassing out . “I don’t want- I don’t want to be like other fellas.”
“Good. Because this isn’t pity.” Steve’s getting closer by the second, his eyelids are slowly shutting and Tony wonders if he’s hallucinating and he’s actually passed out on the couch from all the booze, having some sort of fucked up wet dream.
Steve.
“Such a dirty mouth!”
Tony yells in surprise when he feels a set of teeth dig into the soft skin of his right cheek while a hand roughly grabs the other one, hard enough to bruise.
Tony leaving for Malibu, the guy in Tony’s room, the argument in the gym. Returning to the workshop, the talk by the bar, the guy at the party, the fight on the rooftop. He sighs, something heavy pressing onto his chest. If he could only be honest…
help all the time,” he says childishly.
Tony’s nowhere to be seen. Sam and Nat have tried to keep him company, but Steve’s figured out when there’s a couple of them together, people only spot them faster. Especially if Natasha’s around, she’s a frickin’ magnet in that glorious red dress.
Steve winces. This is going to be a lot harder than he’d thought.
Steve nods and Fury’s hologram vanishes. Maria explains further details about the facility’s location and its structure, as well as the surroundings. Steve eyes the data, already coming up with a strategy and instructions for each team member, taking into consideration their abilities. Hawkeye will be up high and provide a large visual, Widow and him can sneak in after the mercenaries and slim the group down in stealth. They need to be careful and let them approach whatever it is they’ve been ordered to retrieve so they can get their hands on it first. He can’t have Rhodey, Tony or Sam flying around and blowing their cover, so he figures they should wait outside for his word. When the time is right, Tony and Sam can barge in and join him and Nat. Someone should stay with Clint in case things go wrong and Rhodey’s suit is heavily armed, he can also cover them if they get unexpected company. He warns them, though: minimum casualties. They still need these guys alive and taken into custody.
“If you so much as
He can hear the man’s nervous laughter behind him.
When Tony finally emerges from the workshop, he’s in desperate need of a shave. And caffeine. It’s around eight in the morning so he knows Steve is probably on his morning marathon - why does he run so much? He doesn’t even need it! But that’s beside the point: Tony needs supplies and this is a safe window of opportunity to get them and not run into the super soldier. He carefully tip toes his way into the silent kitchen, mentally crossing his fingers, and his entire body relaxes when the only thing he can spot is the back of a red haired head.
“Look at you... I knew you had it in you, you pervert. You’re loving every second of this.”
